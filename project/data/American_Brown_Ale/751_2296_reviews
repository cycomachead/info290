"4/5/15 (Bottle) - Dark brown pour, thick generous tan head, minimal carbonation. Roast malt aroma with a hint of caramel. Very smooth and pleasant beer to drink, nice roasted malt taste, not very high ABV but nice kick. Very good offering."
""
""
""
""
"Maybe I'm just not really into Brown ales but every time I have this beer I like it a little less. Super bubbly and large head. Dark brown color. Very malty. Very very roasty. Almost a burnt ash-tray kind of finish. Has a pretty smooth mouthfeel. It is pretty drinkable but not totally impressive."
""
""
"Absolutely delicious, drinks like soft chocolate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Definitely good for a round or two!"
"Very smooth and easy drinker. Not much hop to this brown but good malty caramel flavor. Great mouth feel and never to much carbonation out of the bottles"

"Keg of moose drool drank."
"A very decent brown ale."

"I really miss this stuff from my days out in Big Sky country..."
""
"A tasty English Brown. Would definitely recommend it. Slight smokiness that really makes it shine."
"Very weak pour with little head and no lacing.  Decently sweet, malty aroma,  Flavor has a respectable balance between toasty malts and hoppy bitterness."
""
""
""
""

"Ultra dark brown beer with a nice tan head....large bubbled.  The smell is malty, some roasty notes, and no real fruit.  Taste has a melanoid flavor..lots of converted sugars and roasty flavors.  Some malt.  Bitter balance, but the hops ar not a real factor in the taste.  Full in body. Mall idly good."
"Similar flavours, sweet bready malt, some light toasty characters."
""
"O - A decent, but not exceptional, beer.  Tastes good, drinks well.  Just not the most robust or nuanced brown I've enjoyed."
"Great taste, right up there with Black Butte Porter.  Not too heavy, good for multiple draws!"
"O-  I was kind of disappointed.  Not a very complexed beer, however I haven't had many good browns."

"Easy drinking beer. A little on the lighter side but a very nice finish. Very disappointed with the smell. Did not really engage the senses."
""
""
""
""
"Root beer color, earthy, malty sweet smell.  Sweet cola flavor.  Watery mouthfeel. An inoffensive intro to brown ales, or craft beer. It's okay."
""

"Great brown ale. Good beer to have, if you plan on drinking more than a few"

"O: Unoffensive everyman beer."

"Very bland not much flav"
"I've enjoyed Moose Drool in several incarnations, in several settings from Yellowstone to Whitefish to my basement. This sampling is out of a can ($6 for a sixer) picked up on our way home from Montana. Moose Drool pours nicely - a burst of tawny head that gradually disappears. It is a rich ruby color (I think - I am color blind after all). The nose is chocolate and caramel, the taste full of chocolate and happiness. This beer is creamy, smooth and generally delicious."
"I was mauled by a moose, but at the last minute he drooled into my mouth. I was fine with it from then on"
""
""
"This is ok. Kinda plain. Shiner bock is a notch or two above this. Too bad. I love Big Sky's IPA."
""
"Winter beer. Wonderful. Smooth. Homey."
""
""
""
""
""
"Underated beer was a pleasure to try!!"
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a straightforward and drinkable brown ale, albeit lacking in nuance and complexity.  I’m hardly a brown ale connoisseur though, so take this review with a grain of salt."
"Dark brown , smells malty with roasted nut . Coffee taste , maybe a little chocolate. Not as rich as a stout though. Very tasty"
""
""
"Not bad, but not my thing."
""
""
""
"So good. I haven't had this in years, but I remember it being a fantastic experience."

"This brew is very much like a number of English brews I'm familiar with. It seems pretty true to style in that sense. It makes for a good beer, but certainly one of subtleties and light flavor and aroma. 3.5"

"Toasted, nutty malt, with caramel and light floral hops form the aroma. There's a hint of chocolate and an almost smoky character. Flavor is herbal, smoky, nutty, with a hint of fruity specialty malt character and cola. The finish is dry and a touch bitter. A fairly even heel brew without any stand-out characteristics. The smoky notes are unexpected."
""
""
""
""
"M: Pretty soft, would say creamy except its a little too thin"
""
"Starts with a malty nose with more lightly roasted grains than chocolate with a hint of sweetness. Pours brilliant chestnut brown with a 1"" fluffy light tan head that dissipates to a thick film. The palate starts between caramel and chocolate over light roasted nuts moving more to chocolate then a hint of coffee before finishing with a lingering nutty chocolate finish. Very creamy with very fine soft carbonation with a medium body. Everything is very nicely balanced with out a trace of harshness. There are just enough hops on the finish to balance the malty sweetness of the beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"T: Promise of the nose seems underserved in taste which is fairly one-note and can be summed up as all NUTS, not chocolate-covered malt balls, just NUTS. It's like they squeezed nuts to a max. You taste walnut, yadi yadi yada, and you get the earthiness of the shell and the bitterness of a walnut that has been juiced. Some dark German black bread quality adds to the earthiness and gives the body some stability. Nary any sweetness, which would actually undermine it's drinkability and strength."

"Creamy taste with a smooth finish"
""
""
""
""
"Pint enjoyed on tap at the Grand Union Hotel in Fort Benton, MT. Arrived a dark reddish brown with a light film of creamy tan bubbles on the top. Aroma is robust, dark, and appropriately hopped, with some roasted peanut shells and a glimmer of hazelnut as well, dry cacao powder, light molasses, and brittle toffee all asserting themselves along with some earthy, slightly floral and grassy hops. A tinge of smoke? Palate is medium roast coffee melding with the nutty and sweet elements on the nose. Moderate body, just approaching thicker climes, with low to moderate carbonation and a notably hoppy finish, grass, earth, and vanilla perhaps. A smoky note emerges over time but remains low key. This is a solid take on an American brown, old world hops providing some bitterness to complement the roasted and nutty elements, although the sweetness is never defeated outright."

"Overall (4.42) : If you can't tell already, this beer is making me glow with enthusiasm. There's not much more to say other than if you haven't tried this glorious brew yet you need to ASAP. Unless you hate black licorice or brown ales all together, then you may not like it. Send it to me!"

"Final Thoughts: All off-flavors aside, this is just an okay beer at best. I brewed a clone of this beer a few years ago and even that was better than this is, and it takes a lot for my home-brews to impress me. Not labeling a date as either 'bottled on' or 'enjoy by' is a cardinal sin in my book. Although, due to the lack of malt flavor I suspect it wouldn't make a difference how fresh this beer is. However, as always I would give this beer another chance. Would I drink it again? Yes, if the head brewer handed me a pint."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 3/13/2014. Pours crystal clear deep reddish brown color with a 2 finger dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big caramel, chocolate, cocoa, toast, toffee, brown sugar, nuttiness, light roast, herbal, and toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and light earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, chocolate, cocoa, toast, toffee, brown sugar, nuttiness, light roast, herbal, and toasted earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, chocolate, cocoa, toast, toffee, brown sugar, light nuttiness, light roast, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and light earthy hop flavors; with great robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and fairly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice brown ale. All around good robustness and balance of dark/roasted malt and light earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."
""
"The beer is dark chestnut with a thin beige collar. Malty aroma with notes of dark fruit, brown bread. Smooth and pretty light bodied on the palate. A mild sweetness throughout, finishing with a delicate hop note. Pretty good."

"Pours a dark reddish brown with a bit of a light brown head. Smells predominately of caramel, chocolate and malt. Those follow to taste, along with a bit of plum and raisin. Just a little hops bitterness. Medium light mouth with some carbonation. A nice beer. Nothing wrong with it, but fairly unremarkable."

"Overall – Not the greatest brown out there. Just OK."
"Flavor: rich caramel, dark chocolate, cocoa, some hops in the middle and finish leaves a lingering bite."

""

"Very dark in color, but not overwhelmingly dark in taste. Little to no head when poured. Warm, roasted malt aroma. Strong barley flavor with very little hop bitterness. Very smooth, as is expected with a Brown Ale. Aftertaste continues with the roasted malt feel. Great after-dinner beer."
""
""
"Pours a dark brown with red highlights and a frothy chocolate head that fades fast. Smell is malty, chocolate, sweet, and a hint of smoke. Big malt flavor comes through and stays throughout the sip. A nice smoky aftertaste that lingers with different sweet notes hitting throughout. A almost heavy mouthfeel, mostly smooth, lots of carbonation. Overall a nice beer, almost stout like. Easy to drink and a good combination of flavors make this a quality beer. Worth checking out."
""
"Very dark beer with about a once inch head when poured into a glass. This is a great heavy beer that you can enjoy in many places across the United States. It doesn't have the typical ""dark beer"" taste that you would expect. The only thing is that it is hard to find!"

"Poured a nice rich brown with a one finger tan head. It looks quite nice and inviting. Scents of bready malt, caramel, brown sugar and slight alcohol. A very sweet aroma for a brown ale, high in the sugary aromas but still with a nice hit of bready malt. The alcohol was surprising, but overall not a bad aroma profile. Flavor begins with caramel, toffee and brown sugar flavors that carry throughout. In the middle undertones of nuttiness and toasted malt appear which are nice, but not as apparent as they should be in a brown ale. The finish is sweet, but with a more overt presence of the nutty and toasted flavors as well. Aftertaste is nutty and toasted malt. A very sweet flavor profile for a brown ale, quite malty but not as bready, nutty and toasty as I like. Still not bad. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and stick with moderate carbonation. It's a good feel that compliments the malty nature of the flavor profile quite well. Pretty good. Overall this is a good American Brown Ale. It's got a nice bready, malty nose and a sweet, malty flavor profile and mouthfeel that works in the flavor's favor. I just wish there was a touch more toasted malt and nut-like flavors, but otherwise it's a solid brown."
"Delightfully malty, and delicious. have enjoyed it on tap and from the can. Of course, the tap is better, but the can is available in my home! Clean and crisp tasting. Pours nicely into glass, serves well. enjoy saying that I am drinking moose drool, but more importantly I enjoy the taste"
"Chocolate and nuts in the flavor are really good. The mouth is a little thin, but not as badly as some failed brown ales. This was a refreshing, enjoyable beer that I will definitely grab in the future."

"Definitely close to a brown ale but could almost be something else. While the color is very dark, it has some amber hues to it. Very malty yet still noticeably hoppy. The chocolate and malty notes are very obvious but seem to be distracted by the Willamette hops which cause a somewhat watery mouthfeel. The smell is very malty but again dispersed by the hops which are not expected by a brown ale."

"This ale is a beautiful dark caramel brown, but the head doesn't last very long after pouring, and I wish it were a bit creamier. The taste is lovely, light on the hops and spices but a robust ""ale"" flavor. The smell suffers as it lacks hops and spices to be very aromatic, but if one suffers over another, the taste better be there for me. Mouthfeel is nice and hearty, and leaves a crispness on the tongue -- not at all bitter to my tastebuds."
""

"Pours a very dark brown, almost black in color with about a 1-finger beige head. Some spotty lacing was seen with each sip. Perfect carbonation. The aroma is of dark malts with a hint of caramel and cocoa. The taste is actually even better than the aroma, which was a nutty malt, coffee, chocolate and caramel. Very pleasant and goes down easy. No bitter finish for this one. One of my favorite brown ales."
""
""
""
""

"O: Fantastic brown ale. It's nicely balanced and has some bitterness that adds to the flavor along with the sweet characteristics that the beer has. A little filling but great nonetheless."
""
""
"Pours out really dark brown/black in the light. Has a nice two-finger, beige head with good retention and some nice lacing. Smell is LOTS of malty sweetness with caramel, dark malts, from the nose with really no hop presence that I can find in the nose. This smells quite unbalanced but not bad. Taste is fairly sweet and I can get everything I could smell from the nose but there is really no hop presence that I find at all to balance anything out. Just a little too sweet for the style IMHO. Mouthfeel is decently thick for the style or even more so than I expected but I like a thicker beer. Overall this beer just seems really unbalanced for the style. It's possible this is an older bottle and the hops have faded but no date means no way to tell. Brewers date your beers please. Just not the greatest beer for the money."

"O-Having attended college in Missoula more than ten years ago, I have had the good fortune of drinking many Moose Drool, but this review was first Drool in a year or two. I know my palate has changed since college, but I recall the brew being heavier and more flavorful than it was this evening. I could have used a little more malt body and some hops to add character...pretty entry-level stuff here."

"From my tasting notes: It poured a nice dark brown that looked like a cola. The initial taste was a big malty chocolate flavor with a full mouthfeel that was truly satisfying. As it warmed it had a slight bitterness on the end that kept it from becoming too sweet, but the malty chocolatiness kept coming through. The Moose Drool was a wonderful Brown Ale I will gladly drink again."

"O: Turns out this isn’t just a beer with a ridiculous name – it’s a balanced, well-made brown ale with a ridiculous name. In fact, it’s one of the most traditional American browns I’ve come across, with a grainy, no-frills taste and a mouthfeel that’s just creamy enough. I can’t believe how surprised I am at how much I like this beer…I guess either the sort-of gimmicky label or its wide availability gave me the impression that it wouldn’t that good. No hard feelings, Big Sky; I’m impressed."
"O - Was very unfamiliar with Big Sky Brewing before this, so this was a good find for me. Excited to try some more of their stuff."

"On tap at Selmas Chicago pizza. Deep mahogoney almost black. Creamy head that stands up well after the first few pulls and laces nicely down the glass. IBU of 30 is goldilocks for me. Not too bitter but has enough to make it interesting and stand io tl food. Really good session beer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this promised more than it delivers. I like the aroma, and I like how it looks, but when it comes down to it, it's a little bit distracted and rather pedestrian. It would be fine to drink without thinking about it, but it doesn't really stand up on its own under scrutiny."

"I've been drinking this for a long time, and had to get past the name, because I honestly don't find it all that appealing or evocative (good thing!). Overall, I would say this is a pretty decent beer for the style and is also pretty cheap. Hop heads won't like it, but I think the underplayed hop profile fits the style better."
""
""
"It's just as good on tap. This beer is a great go-to beer...flavorful enough for the darker/roasty beer fan but not too strong for the lighter beer drinker. This is simply a perfect beer! Kudos to Big Sky Brewing Company."

"Overall - I like how Big Sky choose to name their brown ale Moose Drool, call me a sucker but I find the naming convention an example of simple creativity. The beer itself is an easy drinking beer with enough flavor to be enjoyed yet light enough to enjoy a few at a time. While It looks great and it is well balanced, it could use some more oomph (body)."

"Definately won't be buying anymore of this."

"O- Great overall, balanced brown and the alcohol is more present than I remember from the last time I enjoyed this ale. Cheers."

"The Moose Drool Brown Ale is an indispensable safety item and can be found at most grocery stores. It can be identified by its dark and deep ruby color that has a steadfast foam head. The smell gentle, reminiscent of young barley on a Spring's morning. The brew tastes much better than drool in reality, with subtle coffee, hoppy, and barley flavors that balance the palate nicely. I definite must for Moose huntin'."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass, coded bottle date. This pour a clear dark brown with a large tan head which has okay retention and doesn't leave a lacing. The smells are of a little nutty toffee caramel. The feel is medium to light. The taste is okay, a little caramel and toffee and perhaps coffee, but something is missing."
""
"Overall- I thought I remember this beer being much ""bigger"". It has good flavor but no sustain. I would have more of these because they are so light. It could be my new brown ale session beer, if i was looking for one."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A very easy to drink brown ale."
"My absolute favorite ABA. The clarity is absolutely impressive with a deep amber; reds and browns, copper when held to the light. The aroma is of raisins, dark toasty malts, some baking chocolate. Taste is complex and appealing; sweet coffee, unsweetened dark chocolate, roasted malt, no bitterness. Mouthfeel is thin side of medium. Carbonation is light, more so than a newcastle but only slightly. One of the best ABAs around."
""
""
"Typical brown ale. I'm not a fan of brown ale otherwise this would be an above average beer. Taste has depth to it with a caramel taste and a chocolate malt finish. One of the better brown ales I have had. Would not stock my fridge with it because of my own taste in beers but good to have some around for company that does."

"Did not get much aroma, very roasted as it was a pretty sweet beverage, was expecting more of a nutty or coffe flavor taste but got more of a soda pop feel to it, but overall nothing i can complain too much about, still trying and learning more and more about beers but it was a solid test"

"O: I love this beer, not only for its flavor and overall characteristics, but also for the memories it conjures. I prefer it from the can, and out in the middle of nowhere, as opposed to in from a bottle on a random Saturday night. I saw someone compare it to Newcastle, but, in my opinion, they aren't even close. This would make a great dessert beer."

"Pours a dark brown in the glass but still somewhat opaque. Not the biggest head but some remnants will linger. Smell is average - smell is malty but not really distinct. Taste is very good - body yet still light at the same time. Vanilla and chocolate notes. A beer I've looked forward to tracking down again after first trying a few years ago."
""
""
""
"O: Pretty good beer."

"A solid brown ale, gaining popularity and for good reason. Newcastle is the standard brown ale in most American bars (I can only imagine its presence in England), but I've started to see Moose Drool at least offered as a second option at larger bars or replace Newcastle altogether. It's a much better beer. Medium body that's almost creamy and a nice nutty profile to it make it a much richer option for the same price. It's not a mind-blowing brown, but it's good."
"Not quite sure why I've passed on trying this beer up to this point. This one has a nice nutty tone to it. The body is a bit thick, so there isn't a lot of room to deliver flavor character. It's consistent though. And I can dig it. Won't be a particularly memorable brew though."

"Very dark brown colour with nice lace. Smells with ginger, cloves and molasses. The smell seemed to blossom as it warmed in the glass, very enjoyable. Taste is rich toasty malts and chocolate with a hint of warmth to it and a smooth finish. It is a medium mouth feel which is perfect for this style. Overall its a very enjoyable flavourful beer."

"Like I said, we couldn't get this beer in Indiana… and it is readily available here in Arizona. Good thing, because this is is a tasty beer. I have been getting into darker more malty beers lately. I still prefer an IPA, but nothing beats a dark, chocolaty malty brew. The label might not be very appetizing, but the beer sure is. Bottoms up!"

"Pours a clear super dark crimson brown with a 1 inch foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, vanilla bean, and some nutty aromas. Taste is of toasted malt, toasted nuts, and vanilla bean on the finish. There is a mild roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel but it's a bit thin body wise. Overall, this is a good brown ale with some nice flavors but I just wish the body was beefed up a bit."

"12oz bottle. Pours an almost black dark brown color with a half inch of head. Minimal lacing. Aroma is chocolatey and earthy. Taste is alot like the smell. Chocolate and earthiness with maybe hints of citrus hops. Caramel. Orange maybe. Has a good amount of flavor considering the style. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, but its to be expected. Hints of coffee at the end. This would be a great Autumn beer. Overall, one of the best Brown Ales I have had."
""
"Highly recommended, very sessionable. Smooth milky and delicious! Rate beer to style, people! This is a top notch Brown!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall for an american brown ale this is slightly above average. This would be good on a nice fall night. As the beer opened up the citrus flavor definitely made itself known which made the beer above average for me."
""
""
""
""
"Enjoyable enough, the brown ale doesn't do anything to provide a thumbprint or signature than makes it distinguishable from a lot of other well made but timid brown ales. Unfortunately is kinda forgettable."
""

"O: Very solid, mass produced brown ale. Big Sky has the recipe down and they shouldn't change it. Could drink a few in one sitting."

"Poured into a pint glass, this beer has a beautiful dark amber body, is crystal clear and has some mild carbonation. The amber body is topped off with a nice thick off white head that’s fluffy and creamy and sticks around for a while. I picked up some hints of malts, light hops, caramel and citrus fruits. Its sharp when it first hits your tongue, but is very smooth and slightly tart when it hits the sides of your mouth. I can taste some orange zest, mild hops and wheat along with slight grapefruit aftertaste that’s slightly bitter. There’s some good lacing going on too…"

"Although I picked this up in Yellowstone last summer, it can actually be purchased at our local grocery here in New Mexico. This is an excellent brown ale all around with enough hops to back up the delicious chocolate malt notes. Simple and satisfying, this I would certainly pick this up again as an easy drinking session beer."
""
"O: Extremely easy to drink and very sessionable - I could easily see myself knocking a few of these back in a single session."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This dark fellow really brings a nice cream colored foamy head to the party. Just a bit of lacing remains with the fizzy film that can't hide a nearly opaque brown ale. Nice bit sweet maltiness on the nose that compliments the taste of sweet yet bitter roasted malts. The hop presence only peeks in with the bitterness and perhaps a shot of earthiness. Finish is largely absent of much aftertaste, as the only real lingering impression is similar to toasted marshmallow. Very easy drinking and uncomplicated this is."
"O- really good brown ale, which it was distributed around here"
"pretty average brown ale here. pours a semitransparent weak coffee color with a minimal cream head. smells like sweet chocolate and caramel malt, even a touch of brown sugar. flavor is sweet and roasty, but lacking much of the complexity that i have come to appreciate in this style. feel is a bit watered down, and the sweetness hangs around in the mouth long after the swallow. overall a decent beer, but nothing special. sessionable but standard."

If I had access to this on a regular basis, this would be a solid go-to standby in my beer fridge on a rather regular basis..."

"Overall I liked this beer and I thought that it was a good American Brown Ale, it had all the flavors that you would expect from a good Brown Ale and the nuttyness added some balance to all those malts. This beer had good drinkability, I could drink a couple of these in a sitting since the flavor held my attention and it goes down really smooth. What I liked most about this beer was the aroma and flavor they were both spot on for a Brown Ale. What I liked least about this beer was the prickly carbonation and the lackluster head, if those were tweaked this would be a great beer. I could see buying this again when looking for a good brown ale, and I would like to try ordering this with a meal. If Brown Ales are your thing, then this beer is for sure worth a try. This was another good beer from Big Sky, they are really showing me that they are one solid brewery and I am interested to try more stuff from then, I wonder what some of their bigger beers are like. Good job guys, this is one proper American Brown Ale."

"Moose Drool brown ale by Big Sky Brewing pours a dark brown with copper highlights and a lighter brown head that provides steady lacing. A sweet and toasty nose of malts greets you before notes of chocolate, coco, and light amounts of caramel become noticeable. A strong malty presence is out front, followed by a slight hoppiness that provides good balance. Hints of chocolate syrup, toffee, nuts, and a little spice play together nicely in a medium body with very little carbonation. A pretty good American attempt and an English brown ale."

"This is a nice brew. The chocolaty cocoa flavor is nice and well balanced."
""
""
""
"Medium-dark brown in colour with no head. Big malt flavours of chocolate and roasted grain with a hint of caramel. Spicy and herabl hops provide a balancing bitterness and counterpoint to the malt, but not a lot of hops flavour. Finished drier than one would expect. A nice pint."
"Pours brown with a small tan head that leaves very minor lacing. Light hop aroma, with a slight toasted note. Body continues similarly. Not a bad beer, and likely a great eyeopener for newbies, just nothing great here. Very drinkable, just not a beer I would reach for when given other better micro options."

"Back in 2009 at a dark diner in Montana, remember it a bit 'hopsy"" , i don't have much of a nose for phenol like things, it was not thin, it had some substance, adequate head. I was attracted to the name, yes, i would try it again, i prefer dark beer/ale , cheers"
"Moose Drool pours a dark shade of brown. Thin head lingers. It's definitely similar to other Brown Ales I've had. Good flavor, not too overwhelming. I would recommend this beer if you like other Brown Ales. I would drink this one again."

"O - Fairly decent session beer. A beer that could have a few of. The beer is kind of light and could use more flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium bodied with good carbonation, this beer would be great on a lazy summer evening or fall day. The body seems slightly light at first but is noticeably heavy during the swallow. The carbonation is only slightly fizzy when the beer is held in the mouth but really pops during the swallow. This combination between the body and carbonation makes this beer very drinkable while not adversely affecting the flavor."
"O: Overall a very drinkable and pleasant beer with much flavor and aromas to be enjoyed over and over again."
"Overall Drinkability - Enjoyable as a session beer, but not a very flavorful tasting beer."
"Poured a deep, clear brown with a thick tan head leaving much lacing. Smell was sweet, nutty, and roasted, with emphasis on the latter. The smell was complex and delicious, but I felt those 'roasted' notes came through overbearingly in the taste. It bordered on a burnt flavor, which I found less than ideal. Wasn't too heavy, so points for mouthfeel and drinkability."
"Pretty solid brown ale...tasty and easy to drink. Nothing exciting, but this style rarely is."
"Moutfeel was medium. Creamy with only a little carbonation. Does not linger long...palate isn't wrecked at all by this one. Very yummy brown ale...I'm glad I got to try it."
"O: I like this beer. It's simple enough to drink with ease, but the flavor profile is complex enough to keep it from being boring. This is a good beer for cool, not cold, weather."
"I can see where this is a cult beer in Montana - fits in a lot of situations."
"Overall: I really love this beer. It is everything I expect out of a brown ale. Wish I could get it in Ohio."
"overall, it's what i'm looking for in a brown ale."
"Aroma is nutty, caramel and almost earthy. Maple brown color with thin dissipating head. Taste is extremely nutty with a hint of caramel as well as malty maples. palate is medium bodied, slightly creamy, soft carbonation fills the mouth. Overall i enjoy this beer a lot. It is one of my favorite browns"
"12 ounce can. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a brown color with an inch and a half tan head. Head retention is decent, and there's a good amount of lacing. Aroma is toffee, chocolate, nuts, and some caramel/bready malt. The brew tastes like coffee, chocolate, bready and caramel malt, and a bit of nuts. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit velvety with good carbonation. It's smooth and goes down easy. Not bad for $8.99 a 6-pack, it's a solid overall brew."
"Out of the five Big Sky beers I purchased during my trip to Oklahoma, I saved this for last. After all, I only knew about the brewery because of this beer's ridiculous name. Unfortunately, some of that creativity may have been better utilized for the actual beer. I'd be happy to drink this again, but I won't be trading for it."
"O - A nice, above average brown ale. There are better options around for complexity and depth of flavour, but Id happily drink another one of these in the near future. And gotta love those Big Sky Brewing labels."
"O -"
"O: Very good brown ale and especially good for cooler fall nights."
"Overall: An awesome brown ale that is a staple in my fridge. A nice blend of flavors and a smooth drinking beer."
"Overall - If you like Brown Ale, this one is a bit on the strong side. But it is an improvement over something like a Newcastle. I really wish I could say more, there is a bit more complexity to this, but my mouth can't read this Brown Ale worth anything."
"O: I liked this beer, you know its nothing super special but its like a said relaxing."
"Overall: not a bad tasting brown. Definitly very drinkable."
"Besides the taste, this beer is fine. Too bad that taste is central to a good beer. It was not undrinkable by any means, but it tasted like a watered down brown ale. Maybe grab some for an athletic drinking event since it goes down easy."
"Overall, not a bad brown ale. Sweet and nutty is how I would describe it in both taste and aroma. Nicely balanced. Not the best brown ale I've had, but a solid choice none the less."
"O - This was a little sweeter than most Brown Ales that I've had before and I'm not complaining...I would rather have my Brown Ale finish sweet rather than dry...lots of nutiness with layers of roasted and sweet malt flavors"
"Surprised this is not rated higher, really."
"overall, just too weak, too hard to really pick any good flavors out. the sixpack will definatly be an easy kill, but not something i would ever buy. kind of a lackluster style IMO, but even so there are many better examples out there at the same price."
" Overall I thought this was a solid brown ale, I would not hesitate to drink this again."
"Pours a clear ruby hue which leaves a two finger creamy head and clingy lacing,the smell is sweet malts,earthy hops and toffee,the mouthfeel is light bodied and lacks for my liking with tastes of caramel,sweet toffee malts,ripe plums and finished with a mix of brown sugar and earthy herbal hops and overall i was expecting more cheers."
"Moose Drool poured an almsot blacked color with very little head. The smell was very weak, but a bit of a smokey order can be picked up. The taste was lite, but had a little bit of a smokey flavor, a malty note can be picked up. The flavor was a bit too weak, and watery. overall this isnt a bad beer, it can be enjoyed, but it does have a weak flavor."
"Overal a solid brown ale I would enjoy again."
"O- I really enjoyed this beer, I've had a few brown ales in my day and this one is among the best. Would certainly recomend it."
"Pours brown with reddish orange hues and a rocky sand colored head. Smells of brown sugar and caramel with a hint of chocolate. The taste is kind of like burnt chocolate and treacle with a hint of coffee. This beer is medium bodied and smooth with low carbonation. This is a solid brown ale with a nice roasted flavor."
"D - Not bad; pretty good for a American Brown Ale, probably one of the better ones out there; I would definitely recommend this to friends and other beer drinkers; solid roasted and nut malt profile"
"Poured a dark amber color with a small tan head that receded quite a bit and left some patchy lacing behind. Aroma of toasted biscuits and cocoa. Bready taste, toasty, some cocoa bitterness, mild sensation of earthy hops. Light-medium body, moderately carbonated, and fairly drinkable, though I'd say one glass/sample is quite enough."
"My impression is that this is a nice, characterful yet still casual brown ale, definitely above average. I get the feeling its true character is more accurately revealed bottled though. Still, on-tap it's a pretty good choice."
"Thanks to woodychandler for coming through with yet another canned beer. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a dark brown color with a 1 inch head. Smell is of malts, caramel. Taste is also malty, caramel, a bit of nuts. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is a good quality beer."
"Pours a rich brown color with an off white cap. Aromas of caramel, toffee, biscuit, and alittle floral. In the taste, nutty maltyness, caramel, chocolate, brown sugar and enough hop bitterness to keep the malt sweetness in check. Medium bodied brew, ample carbonation and pleasant all around. A solid malty brew worthy of sessioning."
"O: I found this beer tasty enough, and would like to try it on tap."
"O- A pretty good brown ale. I love that they come in a can for when I go fishing. I like the thickness in the beer."
"O- A very good brown ale for the price"
"Poured from the can into my Geordie Schooner. Brown color reminiscent of a drooling moose. One finger head dissipated into a light tan ring. Toasty aroma, mostly malt. Toasty, roasted flavor, once again heavy on the malt. Mouthfeel was easy drinking although the carbonation went away pretty quickly as the brew warmed."
"Tried this one in Oregon only because people always ask for it on the east coast. It was a descent brown, soft and malty. Had an ok grainy crispiness. Finish was fairly weak. Ovrall it was just an ok average brown beer for a little more flaverful summer style."
"Overall impression: Although there are some bolder American Browns, this one is classic and a trail blazer. It has a nice malt profile but a little under-hopped by today's American Brown standards. Still, worth trying."
"As for the overall quality, I think ti was a decent beer, and not something that will turn people off. I don't know if any of you wanted brown ales to have a bit more roasted characteristic in the flavor profile."
"Greatly balanced. On the malty side, but full of rich character and hop balance. Very easy to drink with rich flavors throughout. Awesome beer."
"From several other occasions, I believe Moose Drool can be better, so I'd say it's average on drinkability, even though I didn't care for this particular bottle. And if I have it again and have a better bottle, I'll revise my other rankings."
"O - Certainly not a great beer, but a pretty solid brown ale. Not my favorite style, but this is pretty enjoyable."
"Took a chance on this one and was glad I did. Pours very dark, smells smokey and malty with hints of chocolate and spice. It tastes pretty much how it smells, it has a very smooth mouthfeel and the chocolate, malty, and caramel flavors really come though, with a little bite from the hops in there as well. The finish is chocolate remnants and malts, not much of a bitter aftertaste, which is fine with me. Very good colder weather or holiday beer."
"Overall this is a great brown to seek out when on an adventure to the west. I would buy again if given the opportunity."
"This one’s fast becoming one of my favorite go-to brown ales!! Sporting a thin creamy head (1 to 1.5 finger in thickness) and a deep brown mahogany color body. Hints of coffee and chocolate scented with notes of honey and warm butter! This is one fine smooth drinking beer."
"Huge fan."
"Moose Drool pours out clear and ruby/mahogany brown, with a nice head that gives way to nice lacing. The aroma is light, but is predominately sweet toasty malts. The taste is very smooth and – despite its deeper coloring – isn’t overpowering with its taste profile. The initial flavor is of toasted grains with a dry cocoa taste on the finish. There are some bittering hops there to balance the sweetness of the malts, but the bitterness doesn’t linger. This is an extremely balanced and clean finishing beer."
"Overall- A tasty brown ale. Brown ales are about my favorite beer style so I might hold them to a higher standard and this one is a little better than average but thats about it."
"D: A very good drinking beer (session!) Good for food (BBQ, bar food, meat). Nice all around. Not outstanding but sessionable to a degree."
"O: Wow - a very delicious and satisfying brown ale. Not a style I frequent, but this is great stuff! Glad I've got one more stowed away in the fridge... Don't know when I'll get it again -"
"I really liked this one and may not be rating it high enough."
"Overall I would make this my session beer if I could get it anywhere close to home. My neighbor bought me two cans on a flight back from Alaska and I am much appreciative."
"O: A very easy-drinking, pleasant brown ale. Does not have the complexity of a world-class beer, but this is a nice brew. Will definitely buy again."
"Pours an opaque chocolaty brown with a thick, fairly persistent pale tan head. Strong, malty aroma has tones of yeast, toffee and caramel. Lively flavor is yeasty and malty with a toffee undertone and even a smoky hint. Texture is quite fizzy, leaving behind a strong and persistent tingle. I'm glad I found this one!"
"Poured this American Brown Ale into a pint glass from a 12 oz bottle. This beer poured a dark walnut color, very nice clarity. It produced a nice thick tan head. Average head retention. The aroma was very nutty and smelled of fresh baked bread. The beer is medium bodied. There is a taste of deeply roasted malt, nuts and fresh baked bread. Overall, I think this is an average American Brown- I don't know what all of the fuss is about?"
"Moose Drool is the 1st TGIF beer of the night!!! The Drool was poured into a pint glass and the appearance is good. The color was a deep amber with creamy off-white head. The smell included malt and caramel. The taste was good, would like a bit more body. The definite malt/bread taste was tinges of sweetness. The mouthfeel was good and this is a good session beer."
"Medium bodied and highly carbonated with a heavier roasted character than expected.  Toasty and slightly burnt tasting with hints of deep roasted nutiness, caramel, toffee andtoast.  Slight sweetness underneath.  Dry finish.  "
"Very versatile brown ale, I would drink this year round, but crave it in hot weather."
"O: This is better than I expected. It's a very smooth, sweet brown ale. Flavor could be a little more pronounced but this is very drinkable and I could easily put down a 6pk."
"I expected so much more out of this beer rather disappointed."
"The color is a dark nut brown that is almost opaque but shows ruby highlights when held into the light. The nose is malt forward and has a strong hazelnut presence. The taste is malty and very nutty. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a nice carbonation. Tasty brown that is super drinkable and readily available."
"Pours a brownish purple with a huge bright white head. The aroma is woody and malty, with toasted nut, dark caramel, and rye bread. The aroma is smoky with molassas and dark rye toast and a surprisingly sweet hop sting at the end. The mouthfeel is fairly thin, with a long, woody bitterness finishing it out. Drinkable and easy."
"O: A good beer that makes me want to try more of big sky's styles, unfortunately this has been the only one I've found where I live so far. I would definitely recommend this to anyone that likes a sweeter beer with thickness. Hell, I'd reccomend it to anyone actually."
"O: Very impressed with this beer. Wish I had a case of it laying around."
"Had this on tap at my local pub, im a fan of brown ales and who doesnt love a moose?!. Well sadly that was the end of my enjoyment with this ale, It was black in color and had a plesent smell but the taste was far too nutty for me. Every gulp made me regret asking for it but as a lover of beer i had to finish it. I still love brown ales but moose drool was not for me."
"This is one of my favorite beers. If you are a fan of brown ales then this is a must try. It's very affordable, and a pleasure every time I buy it. It's sweet, smooth, dark, and extremely enjoyable- great as a dessert beer. The only drawback is I would not recomend drinking a whole bunch of them. The first one or two are great, then the taste gets kind of old. It would be like eating a ton of ice cream. It's good tasting but I dont think I want to eat the whole tub."
"O - This is really easy to drink and I will continue to crush moose drool by the six pack on hot summer days and in the shower. Though it leaves a bit to be desired, it's a great intro brown that does the trick."
"I'd drink it again, won't set out to acquire it, but if presented to me I wouldn't turn it down."
"Not bad. I wasnt too impressed upon first pour, however, this beer did come around and produce a good mix of malts with just enough bitterness. It does fit the wide scope of an American brown ale"
"O - a decent brown ale but there are others in the style that I'd prefer over this one."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, crisp, a bit fizzy, and moderately dry. This is a highly drinkable brown ale that worked well on a rainy night."
"D/O- Drinkability is huge although there are better brown ale options available at most places. Would recommend to someone trying to get into the style."
"Drool pours a dark ruby-tinged brownish amber, with a gigantic, long lasting, creamy tan head. My first thoughts when smelling the beer is of dark chocolate, almost like bittersweet chocolate. Chocolate gives way to some hints of raisin and plum. Taste is surprisingly fruity, chased by delicious notes of toffee malt sweetness. Chocolate from the nose fails to really stand out, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Light hop bitterness finishes. Medium body and decent carbonation, maybe a little bit on the high side. Over all this is a pretty solid example of the amber style, and at 5.3% ABV, it's also pretty close to being sessionable."
"This beer poured very nice, with a decent head and brown color that was releiving since I wasn't sure what to expect of this beer given the name. It was a malty smell that hit me first, then some tin. The flavor was very good, malty and slightly sweet with just the right amount of hops. It was a bit thin and watery for such a nice appearing and tasting beer, but not too shabby. Overall a good beer to have if you're ever throwing them back in Billings with the locals."
"Overall an absolutely incredible brown; I could see myself putting away a sixer while either grilling in July or sitting in front of a fire during brutal winter months. Affordable and easy to find, this is definitely a must have."
"This is GOOD stuff."
"Moose Drool is a well respected brown ale and it deserves the reputation. It is a solidly made and very drinkable American version of the style. This is my second time trying it and I think it will certainly be considered the next time I am in the mood for a brown classic brown. Not ground breaking by any means, but quite tasty."
"Overall: Solid for a brown. Nothing special, but definitely not one I would avoid in the future if I get the chance to pick it up. Moderate ABV clocking in at just over 5% certainly helps it out; also not overwhelming to the palate and it doesn't sit heavy at all. Much like the smell, just plain ol' good."
"A very clean tasting and solid brown ale. I love the name as well."
"My new favorite brown ale. I think though that the can can't be beat."
"Overall:"
"My first experience with Big Sky Brewing, this is a pretty good introduction."
"Opinion: I am really enjoying this beer and think that it may be my favorite in this style. I knew that I always really enjoyed it when I was in Montana. Now that I can sit down and review it, it solidifies that I will be drinking this beer regularly."
"This was a good beer, but without and dryness at the end, it felt very unbalanced. I probably wouldn't come back for more."
"Overall not bad, but not super impressed. It's an easy drinking beer, but not super exciting. Pretty average."
"Very easy drinking."
"o - pretty enjoyable brown ale, definitely worth drinking again"
"Overall not a bad beer but certainly not something I'd write home about, maybe a good gateway for my friends?"
"A wonderful brown ale. I'm not a big fan of brown ales, but this is almost as robust as a porter. Very rich and nuanced. It reminds me of Goose Island Mild Winter, and it just as good. I will definitely be buying this again. Very easy drinking. Will likely become a new favorite as it's readily available and decently priced. Highly recommended."
"O- I don't think I will buy this beer anytime soon. I tried it a few years back, though I don't remember much of how it went. To be honest, and if I remember correctly, the only reason I bought it in the first place was because I liked the name. A friend brought a six pack over a couple nights ago and so I gave it another go - above is what I think now."
"M/D: Slightly thicker than medium mouthfeel. Slightly creamy, but smooth and enjoyable. Very drinkable, sneaky thick and filling, but a solid brew."
"I know that this beer had some good reviews, but when it comes to an American Brown Ale I think I'll stick with Short's, Bell's, New Holland and even Leinie's."
"i'm not always in the mood for brown ales, but when i am, moose drool is often where i go. nice sweet hazelnut nose, bit of vanilla in there too. taste is malty and nutty, slight bitterness comes at the end with some acidity at the finish. i like how this is not too sweet. it's dry and balanced."
"The mouthfeel was fairly thin. Which makes this ale pretty easy drinking as well. Just nice and solid and easy to drink. I love the label on the bottle. Now that I would rate a 5."
"M & D - easily drinkable. Not overly sweet, decent nutty and earthy aftertaste. Decent overall."
"There were also some roasty chocolate flavors for good measure, as well. It finished dry and made me want another sip, but with just a bit too much carbonation in my opinion. I can see why this is considered one of the finest examples of a less hop forward version of the style according to the BJCP."
"On-tap at Peoples...wasn't really impressed by any aspect of this beer. Kind of surprised People had this on tap considering their other decent selections. Yes, it is in fact a brown ale, but not a very good one. I'll skip this in the future to check out some of their other tap selections. Great name, average beer. Disappointment."
"The CPJ"
"D - this is a pretty good brown ale. Nothing uber complex or too simple. Nice flavor profile and low abv could make this a really nice six pack to take down. Thanks to websherpa for the chance to try this one."
"The taste brings the malts just as it smells with some nutty notes and smokey sweetness like toffee and perhaps a tad of brown sugar. I drank this with some Moose's Tooth Santa's Little Helper pizza. Yum!"
"An enjoyable, drinkable brown. It's nothing I would go out of my way for, but I'd put away a glass or two if it was put in front of me. Horrible name, though."
"Good beer."
"Review from my notes."
"Drinkability: It's a great session beer on a warm summer night or a welcome treat to end a perfect powder day at the local hill. I love this beer. Nothing world class, but it's a standard here for a reason."
"D- Overall an enjoyable brown. I would definitely drink this. It does have a slightly odd character though."
"This beer pours a dark brown color with a slight amount of tan head with little lacing. The aroma is strong with roasted malt and some alcohol. The taste begins very malty, with hints of roasted malts, but still fairly generic. The taste ends with some rough alcohol taste. The mouthfeel is ok, not too overcarbonated or anything. Overall an ok brown ale."
"D) A delicious brown ale. I would definitely drink another one!"
"The beer has a brilliant presentation in color and aroma. The color is an amber brown and smells a bit of fired wood and chocolate. The beer does not however live up to expectations. It is rather dry and light and has an excess of carbonation. The head was also excessive. Not a bad beer, I would recommend sampling before buying a 12 or 6 pack, as this beer is definitely not for everyone."
"Final thought - The soapy flavor and smell make this beer awesome. Everything else makes this beer not awesome"
"Poured into my Newcastle Geordie Schooner glass - light beige head quickly fades atop a ridiculously crystal clear brown ale...hints of red glow through in the color. Smells nutty with some dark fruit; caramel and sweetness as well. Taste is very smooth and creamy...light chocolate, caramel and almost like sweet molasses up front. Flavors of roasted and black malts work their way into the palate as the taste evolves, accompanied by a nice hop bitterness to battle the sweetness. I like a little heavier of a mouthfeel than this offers, but the lighter feel is not surprising considering the crystal appearance. While I'm sitting here enjoying this beer inside during the winter, I can just as easily imagine this being equally as refreshing outside on a hot summer day."
"D: The slightly sweet, nutty personality of this brown ale would be appealing enough on its own, but is confused somewhat by the detectable acidity in both taste and smell. Still, it is able to survive its mis-steps enough to be regarded as one of American brewing's modern classics."
"D - Not as high as some."
"D -- Goes down smooth and satisfying. A nice, lightly robust beer for those times when you want something substantial, but you may want a few. Very nice."
"Drinkability-I only bought one of these but really liked it and I could easily drink more than one"
"CHEERS!!"
"D- Pretty good. Nothing overly special, but a tasty sessionable that is worth trying."
"Served in goblet at refrigerator temperature. Received as a gift- apparently it is not easy to find in this area (Detroit). Pours with a thin, light head which fades quickly to a slight lacing. Aroma is as expected for a brown ale with a moderate to strong carbonation. No off flavors are present; flavor is primarily of roasted malt with subtle hop balance. This is quite a pleasant brew for a bottle with such a silly name; it is definitely recommended."
"It's real light on the palate but I'm sure I could sit down and put back a few of these at the bar."
"Drinkability: The transition between flavors was fairly smooth, but I just was not blown away by the flavor overall. Too much cocoa I think."
"The body is closer to full then moderate. Carbonation is light and enhances the mouthfeel. Overall a pretty nice malty beer that is easy to drink."
"Moose Drool is a moderately complex yet, very drinkable dark ale."
"Too metallic to be pleasant, which it just might be without the high level of metal."
"Drinkability is key. This one gets my vote for a good American Brown Ale. Definitely 2 for 2 with Big Sky Brewing. No complaints here."
"d 3.5 i could wish for more nuts, for a creamier body. this isn't the best, but it's tolerable in a strightforward way."
"Drinkability: I would definitely have this again and wish I had another. I recommend this to those seeking a solid brown ale with a unique mid palate profile. Another great session brew from big sky brewing."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkabilty: Body is very light with quite a bit of carbonation. Not the smoothest brown ale out there. Overall, this beer really epitomizes an 'average' brown ale. Not a bad beer, but quite a bit that could be improved."
"D: Very drinkable beer! Understand why this is their flagship. Of the Big Sky beers, this is the evident standout for the price point in their lineup."
"On tap at Blazing Onions Burgers in Mill Creek, WA. Served in a regular pint glass. Light brown color. Foamy white head that faded quickly, but a lot of lacing on the glass. Nice bready smell, like pumpernickel. Taste was a bit sweet but also very malty. Only pitfall is that this beer is quite thin for a brown ale. Would love to see a bit more body for this beer. That said, it is a smooth beer to drink and on the low scale for the abv. A nice session ale."
"Pours a dark chestnut brown. Not much head from this pour. Sweet maple syrup aroma with hints of roasted nuts and cherry. Heavy malt flavor with hints of raisin and chocolate. A welcome slight booziness. Crisper feel than would be expected for the sweetness. Mild carbonation. Solid brown ale. Could definitely go for a few."
"Not a whole lot of aroma. Brown and clear like a lager with an oily tan head. Body is thin and watery. Flavor is like a eeak brown malt. Could use a little more body and aromatic malt to give it a little more flavor. Good training beer if you're trying to work up to the more flavorful stuff."
"D: Very drinkable, especially for a heavier beer. This one used to be one of my favorites, but tastes expand. Still, a solid choice for a brown ale, though far from the best out there."
"Drink- Ok brown ale, not my favorite, have had many more MUCH better browns. worth a try, but don't go out of your way for this."
"The beer pours a brownish color with a white head. The aroma is fairly complex for a brown ale. I get some chocolate, caramel, toffee, hazelnut and roasted malt. The flavor is toffee, chocolate, toasted malt and some earthy hops. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A very easy drinking, flavorful brown ale. Definitely one to try if you get a chance."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew is a dark brown color with a 1 finger off white head with an aggressive pour. There is a slight amount of lacing as a very thin cap settles. This brew has a sweet molasses and brown sugar smell with slight chocolate and burnt malts. A little thin tasting with moderate carbonation. There is almost a sourness to this but notes of chocolate and burnt malts are present. Nothing to speak of for hop presence. Really this is just a plane old brown ale."
"D-I'd say this is an all around good beer minus the head and DMS. The mouthfeel could have been a little more firm, but at the same time this beer is only 5.1%abv. Oh well. Cheers, Big Sky!"
"Finally gettin' down to reviewin' this here brew. It pours a lovely clear ruby mahogany topped by barely a finger of light ecru foam. The nose comprises caramel, light chocolate, light toffee, and graham crackers. The taste doesn't deviate from the smell, with some extra wheat and a touch of very light raisins and figs thrown in for good measure. The body is a light medium, with a light carbonation and a slightly watery feel. Overall, this is one of the best widely-available browns I've ever had. It's pretty tasty and exceedingly drinkable, not to mention uber-affordable."
"Very easy to drink, a good introductory craft beer."
"Drink- Smooth and very sessionable on a cold night."
"D: A very drinkable brown ale in the Northern English style."
"D: Great beer to relax with. Well worth a try."
"D. Complex, interested, and yet still super drinkable. This is my favorite brown ale to date (or at least that I can recall). I found a clone recipe and will attempt to brew this on a 10 gallon AG system this weekend."
"The aftertaste is full of hops bitterness and the body is medium. It's sort of clean and crisp, but I have had crisper and cleaner in this style. It's easy to drink and with what I consider a low ABV, many could be enjoyed in one sitting."
"This was a fine brown ale: smooth, nutty, and balanced. I ordered a second."
"When poured this beer, i was really loved how it looked. Perfect color for a brown, and great head with some lacing. Really nice. The smell dropped off a bit, being dominated by a biscuit smell with bit of roastiness under it. nice, but nothing special. The taste is better than the smell, with a bit of coffee, nutiness, and a bit of caramel. There is also a bit of a bitterness in the back of my mouth. Good light mouthfeel with lively carbonation which complements the lighter flavor profile."
"Definitely do not judge a book by its cover: couldn't be a better beer considering the nasty name."
"D: Very good drinkability, the flavors aren't overpowering enough to keep you from having many of these. Glad i picked up a sixer of this."
"It is most defiantly super drinkable it is perfect for winter or anything to do with being outside when it isn't the warmest out."
"This beer pours a nice deep mahogany brown with little head on it that fades to a little lace on the surface. The smell is very caramel in nature, lots of cocoa, bit of orange in the back. It all seems rather faint, but it's not all that bad. The taste is quite cocoa-y has the slightest of bitter bites on the back-end. There is still a wateriness that is part of this beer that I really think dilutes the flavor and makes its taste rather mellow in nature. It drinks really really nice. A good beer, especially for the price."
"Moderate carbonation with a light, creamy mouthfeel. Solid malt backbone with mild flavors of nutty toffee and caramel. Just a slight hint of hop bitterness on the finish. No knock-out flavors, but very refreshing and easy-drinking."
"12 oz. bottle with some inkjet code. Brewed to 13 P with pale, caramel, chocolate and black malts, and hopped with Kent Goldings, Willamette and Liberty; 5.1% on the label, 5.3% on their website. Pours a deep, dark amber, with abundant carbonation and a finger of crackly khaki head. Mild chocolate malt and a vinous aged quality in the nose. The flavor starts with the same vinous note mixed with papery oxidation. Toward the end, a hint of sweet caramel tries to ride in on a mild hop bitterness. Light, with lots of carbonation and a very dry, almost watery finish. Easy enough to drink, but there are some major problems with this bottle. The body is too light, it tastes long-aged, and while it is true that this bottle is several months old, there should still be no papery flavors at its age. I will re-review if I receive a better bottle."
"D: Nothing too strong to keep you from having many, many of these on an autumn day."
"Beer is medium bodied with some sweetness up front but the first impression is a mild bitterness at the back due to roasted malt. Not a lot of aftertaste but the finish is a little dry. Overall its OK, the sweetness plays well with the bitterness, its a decent beer."
"easy drinking with good flavor. sessionable beer."
"This is a beer that must be had from the tap. Don't waist your time or money buying it from the bottle. Please don't review it from the bottle. Drink cold Moose Drool after spending 4 days hiking in the mountains. I recommend while eating a grizzly burger in Roscoe Montana. Moose Drool is one of the best year round beers in the world. Enjoy it!"
"you know, it's not anything particularly special, but yet, it's a real nice brown. toastermm sent a sixer !!. i'll be enjoying this one a couple bottles at a time."
"Pours a medium brown color with an off white head. Nose brings through a good amount of roasted brown malt paired with caramel and a nice nutty scent. The taste swirls between roast and sweet caramel along with faint hints of chocolate. Medium body with a good amount of carbonation. A nice brown ale and quite tasty overall. If Big Sky starts distributing further east, this would be a really nice fall camping beer, especially now that it's available in cans."
"Mouthfeel not bad. A little thick and heavy, but not too hard to drink."
"Nothing about this beer is especially good. Yet, it's a decent beer."
"Drinkability: this is a nice, refreshing beer; as I said, it's very autumnal. Its round maltiness made a good reprieve from some of the hoppier beers I consumed at Saturday's football game, so I certainly found it drinkable in that context. Tonight, it's still pretty quaffable, so I give it good marks in this category."
"Another canned beer, so I was looking forward to giving it a try. Poured into the glass a nice medium brown color, with a pretty decent amount of tan foam. Aromas of nuts, medium chocolate and lightly roasted malt. Somewhat thin on the palate, with more roasted nuts, milk chocolate and a little caramel."
"D: Very drinkable. Moose Drool is an excellent example of how a beer can have low ABV yet pack a tremendous amount of flavor and still have a substantial mouthfeel. Well done. I look forward to try more of Big Sky's offerings."
"Crisp and bright but certainly stands on its own two feet as a brown ale. Rather light to medium bodied for the style however. Finishes semidry and somewhat effervescent. A decidedly solid and drinkable brew."
"Drinkability is ok, roastiness hurts it a bit, but definitely can drink a few."
"Moose Drool pours a deep brown with a nice off white head that lingers. The aroma is sweet, nutty caramel with some nice chocolatey roasted malt. The flavor is perfectly balanced sweet dark malt with earthy hops. The finish is dry with lingering toasted malt and herbal hops."
"D - Eh, I guess it's drinkable, but it just tastes bad so I don't want to."
"Taste is fairly simple but full-bodied and well-rounded with slightly sweet-sour, earthy, nutty, and caramelly sweetness with a faint hint of chocolate. It has very little bitterness to balance the light sweet-sour character. The feel is pretty full, almost silky."
"A: There is a medium layer of compact head over the surface of the beer, a little spotty lacing appears as the beer drops, a very clear medium brown in color - 3.50, S: Thick aromas of malt, lots of toffee and Tootsie Roll, a heavy dark sugar like sweetness, faint hint of some citrus on the nose, it seems pretty dead on for the style - 4.00, T: Flavor has strong chocolate chip and caramel malts, mild to medium citrus hop bite, ashy sweetness - 3.50, M: Medium mouth feel, faintest burn on the tail of the beer - 3.50, D: All around a quite drinkable beer, possibly a touch more hops than I recall which was a bonus, goes down very smoothly - 4.00"
"Mouthfeel is on the low to medium level with a higher carbonation. I would prefer a fuller mouthfeel with less carbonation. Drinkability is high, this is a easy to drink unoffensive beer that I can see appealing to a massive amount of drinkers."
"Had this on my father-in-law's recommendation - certainly a solid, respectable American brown. Hits all the marks, with a fairly light chocolate-malt flavor with some fruitiness to it, and a mild but nice aroma of caramel malt. Highly sessionable, if not particularly interesting."
"Bottle. Pours a nice mahogany brown color with a nice 2 finger head. Nice aroma of chocolate, sweet malts, and slight hops on the nose. The taste is very nice balance of sweet darker malt and hops. Light mouthfeel. Not a huge brown ale drinker but this one really surprised me as being better than I thought it would be."
"Overall a decent brown ale."
"It had a balanced dryness that created an interesting balance to the sweetness of the malt. This balance gives it great drinkability."
"Overall - A pretty standard but good brown ale... worth a try..."
"While I don't always enjoy browns, this is a pretty decent example of the style and could easily accompany a cool autumn evening."
"I have had this beer on tap before but never reviewed this I wasn't ever too impressed with this beer on tap or Trout Slayer on tap but trout is a wheat beer so it was kinda bland. This is the first time I have had it out of the bottle and I more impressed by the beer still an easy drinking brown but it doesn't taste as watered down as it did on tap much better flavors appear. this beer is better bottle conditioned I guess. recommended I think I will try to make a home brew recipe of this"
"Overall this is a beer that you can drink and enjoy all year round not just during the fall and winter months when darker beers tend to be more popular."
"Drinks easy, but a touch more body would help, better than draft, but about the same as the bottled version if memory serves me"
"Atmosphere is very nice. Really solid appearance, and a nice full, robust nose. Flavor has some really nice components. Very full flavored, nice combo. Overall, this is a really nice quaff."
"This is my 200th review on BA, which I'm more than pleased to announce. Thanks a million to anyone who actually reads these, or anyone who has had to put up with the social awkwardness of me reviewing these with them in bars."
"The flavor is nutty with a nice malt backbone no hoppiness at all. The color is a nice deep amber with a sweet nutty smell on the nose. The mouthfeel is very nice a little watery so it's very drinkable you can drink these all night long without getting to full this is one of Montanas best in my opinion."
"An average brown ale, nothing special, got in a sampler pack so I'd get it then, but that's it."
"An enjoyable brown ale, big like moose. Good enough to make me salivate a bit, I suppose, but not quite drool-worthy..."
"Medium bodied, lots of flavor and complexity. I'm glad I gave this beer another shot."
"Final Notes: A great session beer or to drink against a hearty meal. One of the better brown ales I've had."
"No hops, very smooth, good amount of sweetness, maybe molasses to this. Gets watered down on the back 9, de-evolving (devo!) into another brown ale out there. Price could be better. Could use more carbonation. My thing is this: every beer they make is better than this."
"D- This is a solid beer, a well made brown. Not my favorite, but never one I would turn down."
"D- Pretty good beer overall. One of the better brown ales I've had in while. Who knew Montana would make a good beer?"
"Medium body, with moderate carbonation. Fairly smooth, and easy to drink. Good brown ale, but wish the malts maintained their presence through to the finish. Here, they kind of fade out into the aftertaste."
"Moose Drool is in every store where I live and often finds its way into my fridge during the summer. They go back easy and are well suited to standing at the barbeque."
"m - light carbonation mixed well with the beers flavor, mostly smooth and malty"
"Drinkability is fairly high. The flavor profile is pleasing and the beer is quite sessionable. I think I like it best on draft though."
"Drinkability is good. I'll certainly buy another sixer of this stuff, at it's affordable, overall rates pretty good, and leaves me wanting a second beer, which is good because I've got five of them left!"
"Pour this into a pint glass, got a thin head with not much retention. Color was a dark brown as expected. Got a little bit of a hop aroma at first which was a little pleasant surprise. The taste of this beer was mediocre. Some chocolate and roasted malt flavors. Thought it was a little watery personally and didn't taste those hops i smelled earlier. The mouthfeel was pretty mild with little carbonation. It wen down smooth but didn't have much taste so I would not drink again."
"D - Very very drinkable, I could go for a six pack on a day off, which says enough. I really enjoyed this Brown, the appearance was inviting and taste was very well balanced with a nice citric hop edge. I'd definitely buy this one again, and I'd recommend it. Cheers!"
"Drinkability is high because of the light body. After a few sips, the hops took over and the malt fell more and more to the background, For a brown ale, that isn't what i'm looking for. A decent beer none-the-less."
"Fairly easy to drink."
"D-this is a tasty brew especially with the low abv. very drinkable with a great balance and strong hop presence."
"D - This is a perfect example of what a good brown ale can be. Lots of nuances swirl around to create an interesting but incredibly drinkable beer that can easily be sessionable."
"D: Not particularly flavorful, so I really would not want to drink this one again."
"Super drinkable, definitely a great session brown ale if you're a fan of the type. This is one that I will definitely try again as well as recommend to people who like something like new castle."
"Chuggable drinkability - refreshing and a little tangy in the finish."
"This beer was my introduction to the style, so I definitely have a soft spot for it."
"First drink of Moose Drool all I thought I had was a bottle of pure sugar; it is very sweet. A light flavor of coffee, nuts, and weebit of dark fruits. Very light alcohol bites the tongue in the aftertaste. Fairly drinkable beer, and at only 5% ABV its easy to drink two or three. Not my favorite but still a good brew to have around."
"D: Very good. It's certainly sessionable."
"D- With good flavor and a nice body, this one goes down nicely. A plus that it now comes in a can, meaning it now makes for a good tailgating/camping beer."
"Really enjoyable and easy to drink--good roasted and sweet flavors while light enough to have a few."
"Mouthfeel is fine, nice carbonation and light body."
"I really enjoyed this and I'm not much for brown ales. The appearance was very inviting - big tan head with dark brown colored liquid. Spicy aroma with coffee, chicory, and cocoa - really complex and good. The taste wasn't quite all that the nose promised, but was still good. Mouthfeel was fine, but if a bit creamier it would have elevated this brew substantially. Drinkable and enjoyable. I really did like it and can see why this is such a big seller in MT."
"Overall, Moose Drool is quite the solid brown that maintains all the right elements. I have no idea why this is a B from both the Alstrom Brothers and from BA reviewers in general."
"highly drinkable, good session brew."
"A classic American Brown that falls right in the middle of the style. I'd like to see more browns like this available."
"Faint aroma has hints of cocoa and maybe citrus if I strain. Moderately tall, froathy, tan colored head fades slowly to a film. Dark brown colored beer has ruby hues. This brown ale leans a little more to the malty side with moderatley strong cocoa and bready malt flavors. Faint floral hops pop in towards the end. The finish is barely bitter with a light astringency, and a pinch of lactic tang. Moderatley carbonated with a medium light body. Besides the faintly sour finish I'd say the beer falls somewhere between descent and good."
"Would I buy more of it? - this would definitely be my go to brown ale in a can. I really enjoyed this beer and wouldn't mind having a six-pack in the fridge from time to time."
" Big blast of chewy sweet malts, moderate hop bittering to balance...the finish has a distinctive char from black malts and a bready after taste. Nice ale...don't know if I'd class it as a Brown ale...more like a sweet geordie porter....but very drinkable"
"A pretty tasty brown but definitely not my favorite. If a moose was really drooling this, you could park me under that moose's mouth all night In reailty, I would rate this as a strong candidate for a solid brown ale, but I was let down just a little bit. There are better browns out there, to be sure, but this is a quality example of the style. Again, it was part of a mixed 12 pack and probably the best of the bunch (it's fighting with the IPA for tops), but I expected just a little bit more out of this one. Being that Montana has cold, cold winters, I was figuring on a more imperial level out of this one, but I'm not complaining. It was darn tasty and recommended to my beer brethren. A good brown from a cold place. Surprised?"
"Decent sized tan head over a clear reddish brown body. Head retention is pretty nice. Sweetness is well balanced by the hops. Fruity and somewhat tart up front, but finishes with an earthy bready quality."
"D- I remember having this some 8 years ago on a road trip out West and thinking it was pretty solid at the time. It's kind of a ""no frills"" American brown. A catchy name, good marketing, and being new to Michigan probably help with sales. It's a nice option in a can, though with more and more micros offering cans it's not as big a deal. I'd say it would go well as a fishing/beach/tailgate sort of beer when you want a canned beer that's a little more substantial than the old standbys."
"This is a fantastic brown ale. It offers rich flavor without being overly sweet as some tend to be due to excessive chocolate flavors added. It is very smooth as well. Availability is my only complaint. It is sold over most of the northern midwest and in some of the southwest. However this is mostly bottles. I spent two summers in Bozeman, MT and this became my favorite drink out there. It goes perfect with some pizza for dinner, fly fishing, or just floating down the Madison. I'd also recommend going to a hot springs that allows you to bring bottles and enjoy one during a soak. Alas, I am back on the east coast again and outside their distribution range."
"D - This is pretty average when it comes to brown ales, prolly wouldn't try it again, but glad I got to try it."
"D-This beer was one of my gateways into craft beerdom, and its smooth flavors and ease of drinking, spurned by a lighter body and clean finish, are certainly evidence of why that is."
"Easy drinking, nice solid session brew that could easily see rotation at my house. Another well crafted beer in a can. One of the few brown ales that I actually enjoyed."
"I can definitely drink these like nothing. Overall a decent brown ale. Not too shabby."
"The chocolate and coffee tastes are pleasant enough although a bit overbearing making it a good but one dimensional brown ale."
"This beer started out looking good. Poured into a glass a 1+ inch head was formed leaving nice lacing about the glass. The smell was mild but present including a sweet aroma of nuts and chocolate. The taste was not nearly as impressive as the look, however, as the nutty aroma was replaced by a more burnt taste and bitterness. The mouthfeel was watery and had considerable carbonation. I probably should have just finished this beer while it was cold, but I let it warm a bit and that was my mistake. I then found this beer to reveal more of a tobacco taste and that was it for me. I finished about half of this beer and had to stop. To some this review may sound unfair of this beer, but I haven't had to pour a half a beer down the drain (voluntarily) in a long, long time. In the end, I found the name of this beer quite fitting. Thank goodness I only bought one to try it out and I hope the Big Sky IPA I bought at the same time saves my opinion of this brewer."
"D- Well balanced and enjoyable. Not an all-star beer, but it makes for easy drinking."
"D: Not a terribly interesting version of the style, but it goes down easy and inoffensively."
"D: this one goes down easy, but does so with very little flavor or character...nothing too exciting here, perhaps a good gateway craft brew"
"D: A nice find and an above-average brown ale that is well done. More body and this would be a real winner."
"Notes: A nice local offering that shows the diversity of craft beer production in the US. Glad to find it on my travels around this region."
"I'd like to try this again, fresh and on tap."
"D - Moderate drinkability - a bit filling is a downside, due to its fairly potent carbonation. ABV is manageable. Flavors are not overwhelming. A session beer to a point."
"Big Sky is somewhat of a novelty as one of the few Montana brewery products available any distance from Montana."
"A very easy drinking brown. Color was nut brown, but a little light for my taste. Aroma had soft nutty, caramel notes. As it warmed up a little chocolate peeked through. Nice mouthfeel and a very text book brown ale. Good nut and cocoa flavors. Went very well with my burger. A good overall experience."
"Color is a dark caramel color allowing some light through. About one finger think cream colored head that sticks and leaves very nice lacing throughout the drink. Smell is of dark malts, sweet and appealing. Taste is nutty with flavors of dark fruits, earthy and a smooth malty finish. Medium body. A very good beer and I enjoyed 2 of them with my burger and fresh cut potato chips. Beautiful."
"D: Drinkability was decent, definitely good for 2-3 with some bright moments but was a bit sweet overall.Drinks more like a standard fruity ale rather a brown, but all goes down the same."
"D: Highly drinkable, Big Sky continues to absolutely impress."
"Overall this seems to be a good representation of the style. It is an open ended style so I find it unfair to compare this to some other that have a more extensive inventory on their ingredients list. If you are looking for a good roasty, fruity, brown ale then this is your best bet. I think this is a great beer and is under rated because of the idea of extreme beer in America."
"Enjoyed on tap at the Yrd House, Scottsdale. Very dark brown a little head, it was promising. It had some stouty qualities with licorice and chocolate malts but it was too sweet, and not so drinkable.Average mouthfeel.Its popular as a beer, and maybe a root beer substitute. Had nearly 3 years later and getting licorice with a bit of astringent finish."
"I had heard so much about this beer from friends who were traveling in the Big Sky area. Anyway, light and pleasant malt aroma, with a slight hop background that strengthens the longer it sits. Brown in color and full head that lingers. Not a strong flavor but the hops are there in taste but not a dry finish. Thin mouthfeel with low carbonation. Kinda like the name suggests, although I love the name."
"Once served in a tumbler glass. Look: Opaque black color and red hues, thin foamy head, brown and very bright, acceptable lacing; Smell: Roasted malt with chocolate and prune; Taste: Roasted malt, roasted coffee and chocolate, lightly spicy hops; Mouthfeel: Subtly dry, high bitterness, medium body and high carbonation; Drinkability: Just good, taken on 25 january 2010, day when Salvador Cabañas was attacked, come on chavagol, you still have many goals to score and tournaments to win."
"Moderate to heavy body. Solid brown ale."
"Drinkability is good. Its hard to find a decent Brown Ale, they are far and few and this one really hits the spot for a brew thats tastes good and is easy to enjoy."
"2.0 D: The taste is all but gone by the time I got the to bottom of the glass."
"D: not the most flavorful brown ale, not particularly thick, but also not exactly refreshing. This brew doesn't do any one thing great, but rather delves into all aspects of the beer realm. It is somewhat the Jack-of-all-trades of the beer world. I can't quite see what all of the hype is about."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable and hits the spot on a cold winter night. In all, a good beer and I'll brink more."
"Good brown. Also good to cook with."
"Nice look, good slightly tan head. I wouldn't drink more than one for fear of becoming a chocoholic."
"Crispy brown appearance. Sweet, brown, bready malt in the nose and candied nuts. A sugar crusted loaf of sweet bread, mild chocolate and toffee notes are present in the taste. Mouthfeel is crisp, mostly dry and malty in the finish. I will say it barely earned the above score. Another decent offering from Big Sky."
"Dark brown copper color with a creamy dense head and surprisingly sticky lace. Smells straight up brown ale....slight coffee, caramel. Taste is heavily roasted, slightly burnt. Mouthfeel is soft and a touch flat. Drinkability is limited by the burnt roast. Not one for me, really...there's an acidic aftertaste that's staying with me. I won't stay with it, really."
"D - The light mouthfeel does lend to a nice sessionable ale. Nicely drinkable. Probably not something I would have again, but mainly just because of style preference."
"Average, fairly easy drinking Brown Ale. Not bad."
"Very dark reddish brown with a thin tan head, ok retention. Smells of sweet caramel and roasted matlyness. Flavor is good, very small hints of caramel flavor, some hopyyness, but seems a bit weak and has an almost watery mouth feel. It is fairly drinkable, but mouth feel is a bit disappointing."
"This was quite drinkable and pleasant, on the simple side, but I'd have it again."
"D: Definitely a beer you could drink all night long. No to cloying or filling."
"Drink ability was good. Very sessionable beer, solid brown ale. Cant really stand up to DFH Indian Brown Ale, my favorite in this style, but it was worth a try"
"D - The odd vegetable smell and flavor are a bit distracting and definitely limit the drinkability of this one. Alcohol is low making this sessionable strength. Had this one last about 15 years ago - was a favorite then, but I think my tastes have definitely changed. Glad to have the opportunity to try again and see how my palate has progressed over the years."
"Pours with a nice, rich brown hue, decent head and lace. Flavors of toffee, banana, roasted hazelnuts, and caramel. Yum! Finishes rather crisp with good grip, balanced tannins, and a nice nutty aftertaste. One of the better brown ales I have tried lately. Just taste next to Newcastle if you don't believe."
"This is a nice beer. It's nothing fancy or all that impressive, but it was nice to drink. It's something that I wouldn't pass up, but I wouldn't go out of my way for. The flavor could have been more impressive."
"Drinkability:I've had plenty of these on many occasions and will probably do so in the future due to price and availability. A pretty good sessionable brown ale."
"Brown color with a frothy head. I have had this in a bottle, but recently found it in a can and decided to review it again. It was about where I remembered it, with the novelty of having come in a can to actually get me to buy another six pack. Its not bad, but not one that I keep stocked at home. Nice malt structure in the nose with some touches of grain and hops. Some sweetness about the nose. Nice thick mouthfeel is like a mild syrup. The attack is mostly sweet malt flavors, but there is a strong presence of grain. Some sweetness manages to cover the flavor and leave me describing it as sweet. It seems like some of the punch is missing from this beer as it just doesn't have the zip or ""it"" factor to be rated any higher."
"D- All in all, I'd say its okay. Not good, not terrible. I think there is room to improve this one to be pretty darn good. I'd like a more interesting and potent aroma to accompany a more interesting and potent flavor. I just seemed to lack something..."
"well, this is not my favorite beer would be an understatement. I was quite a bit disappointed. it tasted fine and had decent flavor but.. Had a good feel though but just didn't sit that well and not very drinkable whatsoever. i am rating this beer low"
"A typical brown ale that's not overly sweet or overly bitter but perfectly balanced. It's pretty ordinary but sometimes you need a regular beer."
"D- great for the style, although I usually only get it about once a year (usually late autumn as a transition from fall to winter beers) it's always satisfying. I can see why this is one of my dad's all time favorite beers (although in recent years he's leaned more towards the decent yet overrated Mac and Jack's amber)"
"Taste is just mildly sweet with a toasty and hoppy bitter finish. Not as much depth as the nose indicates and a bit thin in the mouth, but it is a pretty nice beer and quite drinkable. I can see why this is Big Sky's most popular."
"A solid Brown Ale to be had here, very drinkable. Without a doubt it's a good pick when it comes to Brown Ales."
"Bartender told me it is also available in cans??? Anyone know if this is true and if so where it can be found in Chicago?"
"D: This is a good brown ale. Very simple, tasty, and smooth. Very easy to drink....the first one went down very easy."
"Nothing groundbreaking here but this is just a solid Brown Ale with quality flavors and a good sessionable feel about it. Portability in cans is a plus!"
"I have had better brown ales but this one is very good choice for the style if you're looking for a good example."
"This was a decent brew, yet lacked a few things which kept it from being a good beer. Almost seemed like a work in progress."
"D: The low ABV on this makes for a good session beer. The flavor is pleasant, if not exciting. Overall, a good social beer to share with friends."
"Drinkability: A very sessionable and smooth brown ale. This beer is not too light, not too heavy. It strikes me as a perfect camping beer. I will look for this again."
"I have to say that I am a bit partial to this beer as it is brewed so close to home and is a staple of me and my brothers camp out diet... Nuf said"
"D- Filling. 1-2 beers with a nice piece of poultry would be perfect. I would drink this again for sure."
"D-Easy to drink, heavy sweet nutty flavor."
"Drinkability - Extremely drinkable. Not surprising, a brown ale by definition should go down smooth and easy."
"mouthfeel is balanced. a little dry on the palate but overall good drinkability."
"had this at burger Jones in uptown..pours a deep brown color with some crimson edges nice 1/2 head.. the smell is nutty earthy with toffee and caramel smells the taste is roasted malts and hops with a nutty caramel backbone this one is very drinkable and a good brown"
"D - Great. Near perfect for sessionability."
"D - This a nice take on a classic style; however it's a bit sweet for my taste to consider it a session beer. Very nicely crafted and well worth a try."
"I am impressed with this beer. It is surprising dark for the style, a deep almond color. The taste is very rich and full without being full bodied and maintaining a good drinkability. I was blown away by the complex and smooth nutty, roasted flavor. It is almost like an oatmeal stout in terms of flavor and complexity. Hops provide a mild bitterness that keep it balanced. What a great beer! I even like the name. Definitely worth trying!"
"Smooth mouthfeel and a pleasure to drink."
"Pours a clear dark ruby red, almost looks a bit purplish in the light, very thick tan head forms, slowly fizzes down to a medium ring around the glass, a couple streaks of lace stick. Smell is nice, very sweet and malty, caramel, quite nutty, some raisin, dark fruit, light chocolate, almond pits, almost a bit port like but that could be the age, smells nice. Taste is nice, dry and biscuity, caramel malts, nuts, raisin, dark fruit, a little bit toasty, a touch of chocolate milk, touch of roast right in the finish, quite nice. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low to medium carbonation. Not up there with the big boys but I would certainly drink this if regularly available. Thanks Eric!"
"Nice big mouthfeel with a lot of chewyness and even a bit of coffee. Quite good, worth seeking out."
"Mouthfeel had up front zip with a smooth finish. Medium to light body."
"Happy to see this appear in cans. Pours dark brown with red highlights. Large light tan head that has high retention, though it does dissipate eventually. Good amount of lacing too. Good looking beer. Smells of some sweet malts, slightly nutty, a bit of roast thrown in there. Doesn't taste like a traditional brown, there is the malt but there is some roast and some hop bitterness that makes for a crisp finish. Less malt complexity than I expected, but good tasting, crisp, nice session beer no doubt. Medium bodied with lovely medium carbonation that hits the spot, slightly silky feel. Very drinkable for a brown, again, great candidate for a session beer, and good to have this in cans. Surprisingly refreshing since it well avoids cloying. Good stuff."
"Certainly not what I expected, and I mean that in a good way. The appearance was a copperish color. I wasn't getting much aroma from this, just some roasted malt. However, the falvors were quite big - roasted malt and chocolate balanced out by a mellow hopiness. I really enjoyed this beer and will certainly have it again."
"O: it doesn't seem like a big beer. I can see drinking a couple of these. it was enjoyable."
"(D)- An interesting beer with an even more interesting name. A good departure from your run of the mill browns or ambers."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable."
"One of my favorite brown ales, and sampled often when I lived back in W. Montana. Good body, excellent taste, excellent smell. Fits well with my philosophy that if you can see through it, it ain't beer. Nice, slightly smokey flavor, but not an annoying aftertaste. Regarding the smokey flavor, my true Montana story: Playing cards at a friend's house, whose inlaw's were Staunch Baptists (a preacher) and death on alcohol in any form. To avoid offending them, we slipped Drool into Coke cans so we could surrupticiously imbibe. (By the way, my friend was known to chew upon occasion.) While our attention was focused away, his dad picked up the coke can and took a drink. (We both saw, but had no opportunity to intervene.) His expression was priceless... he recovered and realized what he was drinking before spewing it out... but we almost died trying to suppress our laughter..."
"This is light bodied, dry, with some sweetness to it. The carbonation is just right. This would make a nice session beer."
"Bit watery, but decent mouthfeel."
"D: A very nice Brown ale. One of the better, if not the best, Big Sky beers I've tried. Easy to put back a few of these in an evening, as the roasted flavor is pleasant but not sickening."
"Drinkability - For the most part, an excellent beer. And sometimes one of the few good beers available if you're stuck in unenlightened portions of the West."
"D: Very easy to drink. Like 12 oz. of caramel colored goodness."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, Moose Drool is a deep amber, almost brown color with a tan-brown head which moves as a solid mass in the glass. The nose is primarily malt forward; caramel and mild chocolate notes come to the forefront, a touch of smokiness and a faint whiff of hops. The flavor is also malty but the burnt, acrid taste comes through a little more strongly. A bit of caramel and burnt toast, hops to balance. The mouthfeel is on the watery side and the carbonation is subdued but slightly creamy. Overall, a drinkable beer, decent brown ale - probably better than actual moose drool (I hope) but nothing outstanding. ."
"Basically this wasn't good in the bottle and still isn't good in the can."
"Moose Drool lends itself to be very drinkable -- a delicious, yet not-too-heavy brown ale that provides a wealth of flavor at a reasonable ABV."
"D - Quite drinkable yet I always get swayed into buying something that stands out more."
"This beer pours a deep mahogany color with a two finger of tan bubbly head that leaves wispy lacing. Nose is of grains and toasted malts, slight toffee and caramel. Taste is of grains and malts up front, middle is filled out with a nice deep caramel and chocolate base and a bit of a smokiness to the taste faint but there. Medium body, medium carbonation, feels somewhat thin but crisp. This is easily a nice sessionable ale!"
"The smooth body was also typical for the style, as was the drinkability. These go down smoothly and easily. It's been a few years since I've had a Moose Drool, it tends to get lost in the crowd of great beers in the PNW, and I'm very glad that I've revisited it. Worth trying and a solid go-to brew."
"D-this is just a great brown ale. I could have this over and over again, full of flavor."
"Beach/Shore: Oh, yeah! I would be the envy of all around me, opening a Montana beer at the Jersey shore. Bump Ten Fidy yet again."
"Not great but really not bad. Had this in las vegas and knew nothing about it. I knew the brewery but not the beer. I don't like brown ales a lot but this one is good. Good carbonation, not too much malt, alcohol or thickness.. One to try if you're compelled to have a brown ale."
"O- Overall is pretty good."
"Drink a very drinkable beer that I wanted more of. A very good beer to have 3, 4 or even more of"
"It just doesn't have the complexity I hoped to see."
"D - I always used to buy this beer shortly after I got into craft beer and nothing better was available. I always enjoyed it but now having it years later and many tasty brown ales later it is not as good as I remember but still a solid brown."
"a nice mild smoky brown ale. of a deep deep amber with a poor head and not much lace but a good density none the less. nose of malt and apples pie and palate of that but with a nice smoke to it very mild. mild sweet bitter finish.. but not much of a track of fruit other than the apple. pretty damn good either way though."
"I've had this one from bottles and cans and I must say this is one I definitley notice a difference in. Maybe the bottles I continue to get are somewhat old, but I think the cans just have a much more in your face, full flavor. Regardless, this is a great beer for just drinking."
"EDIT: Like others have mentioned, I am tasting a little difference between the bottle and canned offerings. The canned one has a little bit more of a yeasty flavor to it that I've also gotten in the Ska canned ESB. It's not better or worse, just slightly different. It could just be a slightly different process needed to can something. In general, I prefer this on tap, then bottles, then cans...however the cans are oh so convenient."
"Could have been better balanced in my opinion I think I would rather drink a newcastle over moose drool. My first Big Sky offering thanks to Tedpeer! Hopefully I can try some other Big Sky beers in the future."
"Had this one a while back but took notes. Poured a burgundy/brown color with light tan head that faded quickly and left very little lacing. Smelled of malts, raisins, and toffee. Tasted of big malts and fruit. Felt smooth and well carbed, but just took a lot for me to finish it."
"Drinkability ~ High, this is an almost elite brown ale. Good for the price and quality."
"D - Very drinkable. Could easily be my session beer."
"D- Very good brown ale with a high drinkability."
"If not for the slight medicinal off taste, this might have stood a chance of becoming a staple in my fridge. As is, I certainly won't turn one down, as they go down smooth and easy."
"Carbonation is perfect, it has the right weight and has a smooth texture. However, there are times where it seems lacking, perhaps watery. A decent brown that doesn't go away too quickly."
"D= great. Brown ales might not get much better than this. Its a great beer from a somewhat boring style."
"D- Very easy to drink."
"12oz bottle poured into standard pint glass. Pours a cola brown color with a thin off white head with great retention, faded to a thin bubbly film, great lacing. Smells caramel, nutty, a little funky. Taste nutty, hazelnut. Medium body. This is a great example of a nut brown, not a fan of the style but this is a good one."
"I'm surprised that the canned version seems different from the other serving types of this beer. It doesn't make any sense. I say, avoid the can and stick with bottles and draft."
"Smells rich, nutty. Tastes like a brown ale should. Woody, clean; coffee favors are very clear and strong. Creamy mouthfeel, not very thick, the favor lingers for a short while. Suble caramel favors. This is my second tasting of of Moose Drool. Seems to get better the more I try it."
"Drinkability: Really quite high. For something called Moose Drool, I'm actually pretty impressed. It's refined and subtle. Nothing big or bold, but it's solid, flavorful, and drinkable."
"Overall, not a bad offering. Has enough flavor to make a decent session beer."
"D - This is average for a mild. The flavors should meld together, but they just didn't. It was a bit complex and would advise to reduce the ingredients used in the grain bill."
"Poured like a brown ale, very dark brown with some ruby if held to the light. Nose of toasted hazelnut and vanilla. Tastes of hazelnut, vanilla and a slight bitter finish of hops. Feels light in the mouth with a little tickle of carbonation. Drinkable but not a session beer. All in all its an average brown ale that is worth a try."
"Happily, the beer became a worthy brown of average drinkability."
"Dark brown with a modest off white head. Fair amount of lacings. Aroma is nutty roasted malts. Taste is nuts, bread, cocoa, and good support from some mildly bitter hops. Slightly dry and astringent on the palate. Carbonation is a bit much for an English Brown but normal for the US tongue. This is an average ale in many ways but with no bad character and the 5.1% abv you could drink this all night. First time I have seen this in a can. Tastes fine."
"I do give it higher marks on drinkability because of the lower 5.1 ABV that this beer has. I do have to commend Big Sky on making beers with lower ABV than most. Nice to sit back and relax with an average beer on a hot summer night and not have to worry about getting canned after drinking a few of them."
"D - We did a blind tasting of 7 browns, and this beer was the worst."
"Pours a dark brown color with a one finger off white head that leaves some lacing down the glass. The head pretty quickly get reduced to a thin layer but stays around for a while. The smell is pretty good. Smells a bit of roasted malt, a little nutty and bready. Taste is good. Kind of nutty and bready like the smell. I also think there is a hint of some chocolate in there. Pretty good overall. I like it. I've been interested in trying this one for a while so I""m glad I did. I like it, I'll get again sometime. It's really drinkable and pretty good."
"Conclusion: Simple (perhaps a bit overly) but quite tasty and drinkable brown ale...this is quite a bit better than many American brown or amber ales. I had this with some dry figs and it was pretty good. This would be a nice quaffer of a pub ale."
"Light and creamy mouthfeel, but on the thin side, with an astringent feel coming in toward the end of the glass. Easy to drink, flavorful, but doesn't command my attention, and as such would be a good session beer. Another solid entry from Big Sky."
"D: Easy session beer, I can, and have drank this stuff all night long, many times. Tasty beer, and definitely one that I try and keep on hand."
"Light body but hard to fault this as a drinker. Picked up a sixer - should be well through it by the end of the night."
"drinkability is good for a full flavored beer of only 5.1%abv"
"I spent about two months in Montana drinking this. I really enjoyed it then (three years ago now), and enjoy it now. I was surprised and pleased to see this in the liquor stores in Tulsa, OK. Recommended."
"This is a pretty good brown ale, nothing really special just a nice drinkable and well balanced beer. Easy to enjoy and nice to have in the fridge."
"This is a good American Brown, not to be mistaken for an English brown in any way, shape or form. Drink this one next to a Newcastle to see what I mean. It's bitter, roasty and chocolate, but never ventures into porter territory. That's hard to pull off, yet Big Sky does it well. Glad this made it to Kansas."
"M -Tasted watery at the get go but the finish offered a subtle brown sugar hint and toasty malt."
"Drinkability: Overall, a very nice example of an English-style Brown Ale, but there is something about it that keeps me from really wanting another."
"Not too bad of a beer. Didn't feel right in the mouth but the flavor was fairly rich."
"Pours a dirty coke a cola color with a large bubbly, tan head. Lots of visible carbonation, looks like soda pop. Smells sweet, light malt in there somewhere. Some very faint nutty notes as well. Tastes sweet right away, followed by some roasted malt and a hint of bitter chocolate. Very balanced. Mouthfeel is bleak, kind of watery and not enough carbonation. Drinkability is great, and now I can get it in cans!!! bonus"
"D: It wore on me, the aftertaste was a bit sweet for me to consider this as having good drinkability."
"Short thin flavors go to short weak finish but with a bit of burnt toast back palate. Not something to go out of your way to try. Just my opinion."
" ~ This is the best brown ale I've ever had. Thanks to my friend Alejandro Ysquierdo."
"Pours clear, ruddy amber color with a lighter amber along the edges. An inch an a half head of a pale tan color. Good retention and lacing. Smells of sweet malt, slight roasted malt, grass, and slight biscuit aroma. Fits the style of an English Brown Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and slightly thick with a low carbonation level. Tastes of roasted malt up front, sweet malt, and then hops come through, a muted toffee flavor is present, along with a slight grass flavor. Overall, really sweet for my taste, but the blend of flavors besides that is pretty good. A really drinkable ale that is more refreshing than filling."
"Mouthfeel is thin, but typical for brown ales (I always expect a fuller beer based on the smell). Leaves me with the same aftertaste I get after finishing a dark chocolate, tongue coated. A good sessionable drinker."
"NOTES: BBCSD-0903-Danielle"
"Mouthfeel is a little weak for my liking. A bit too watery. Oh well. Flavor is nice and chocolatey. Mouth is full of warm breadiness as well. Finishes on the sweet side. Not bad. I'd drink this again for sure. Drinkability is high. I downed this fairly quickly with ease. Recommend."
"This one looks and smells great but the taste and mouthfeel are probably a tad less impressive. Still, a decent brown ale."
"Overall Impression: A solid beer, the toasted/roasted malts are not my thing."
"D - This is a really well made brown ale with tons of the smoky old-cabin in the woods notes that I love. The balance of nuts and fruit reminds me of one of my favorite combos... peanuts and raisins. I'll be back for more of this one!"
"All-around good brown. Malty and sweet taste and smell appropriately balanced with hops without hops flavor or aroma to speak of. Smell is a bit too sweet for me and almost stale (cardboardy?) even though the bottle is fresh (according to bottle date). Easy to drink and very refreshing after a bike ride on the beach. Good drinking and well worth the price, but not the best brown I have had."
"EDIT: I tried another bottle of this and I got the same flavor, I am officially done with this beer. I suppose I may have gotten 2 bad bottles, but quality control is just as important as the product itself and something is wrong here"
"D-Again just happy to be able to get Big sky here now and will be a regualar in my fridge. Smooth and very easy to drink"
"A very sessionable English brown from Big Sky. And refreshing enough to enjoy in the summer months."
"mouth is medium and not viscous. Smooth with a lingering but pleasant aftertaste. This beer drinks very easy and is really enjoyable. It might be the best brown ale <%10 that I have had. Jewbelation 12 would be the only exception."
"D: A nice enjoyable brown ale, low ABV makes having more than one nice and easy."
"Here's an extra tasty brown ale. I've had several of these over the years; I really like Moose Drool. I bought this six pack at a local grocery store; I paid $7ish at Ridley's which is an Associated Grocery member in Blackfoot Idaho. So....Moose Drool is a dark pouring brown ale. Very nice brew with plenty of pop. This one, like all the others that I've had in the past, pours with a nice head, more that you'd probably expect, but it goes to a mere lacing relatively quickly, within 10 or 15 minutes. Moose Drool tastes a bit more boozy than a 5.1%, but the mouth feel is great and not too lite. This is a really nice and nutty brew. A brew to savor. Cheers!"
"D=Medium carbonation and not too filling, like I said one of my favorite beers, so I could drink plenty of these."
"This is a decent brown that is very filling & oddly acidic. I could drink a couple of these in a session but no more."
"This beer poured a blackbody with a hint of amber hidden in the light. The head seemed to be of good size but the bubbles appeared rather large for my taste. It sets off a smell of bitter chocolate and coffee with a hint of alcohol. I found what I smelt is exactly what I tasted in this beer, A good molasses/chocolate/coffee/alcohol. The mouthfeel seemed a little heavy on the carberation, but all in all I really enjoyed this beer."
"Thanks again to donkeyrunner."
"Dark but translucent mahogany/ruby brown. 1"" off-white thick head. Nose is toasted malts and dark fruit (plums, black currant) mixing with fresh scents of almonds and nutmeg. Very nice! Taste is malts and vague nuttiness. Mild but solid. Mouthfeel is average."
"I like brown ale. But I'm not a big fan of Moose Drool. It's not terrible, and it's my favorite of the three Big Sky beers I've tried so far. Maybe I'm spoiled by how good Newcastle Brown Ale is, so that any other brown ale fails in comparison. But it's not a bad beer - I'd drink it if one was put in front of me."
"It's not quite like sitting under a moose and monkeychugging warm twiggy marshwater, and in some ways thats dissapointing. but what it is, is a good solid brown ale. Incredibly easy to drink, and i tend to refrain from more than one brown because they're too sweet, this one is not. It could defnitely be sessioned... give it a try"
"via colts9016"
"Overall-solid drinkable brown ale, I can see why this has become a favorite, it's by no means knock your socks off fantastic but it's a fine beer and I give credit where it's due."
"Very smooth and balanced with a few sweet notes here and there. The carbonation is moderate and the finish is dry...kind of like a stout."
"mid body. adequate carbonation. good beer. i like the offering i have had from big sky."
"Drinkability: Would be a good session beer, although 5.1% might be a bit high."
"Even mouthfeel, moderate carbonation, feels pretty full in the mouth. Very drinkable, tasty and sessionable beer. Thanks Eric."
"It is medium bodied, not very carbonated and has decent drinkability. I could certainly see people enjoying putting quite a few of these back. Not the best brown ale out there but certainly not the worst and def. worth giving a try."
"Pours a dark brown with deep amber highlights,and a thick bubbly tan head.Aroma is nutty with sweet caramel,and toffee notes.Flavor is sweet and malty.More of the caramel and toffee,some nice light chocolate notes with a bit of a spicy hop finish.Nice lacing,medium to full body,just enough carbonation to keep everything feeling crisp and light,very sessionable. A nice beer,fun to try"
"Quite a sweet aftertaste left on your tongue."
"I remember a few years ago my dad was traveling through montana and he called me to tell me about this funny named beer - moose drool. He couldn't bring it back and I'd pretty much forgotten about it until my wife surprised me with a package of states I was missing and lo and behold there's a bottle of moose drool. I had this at dinner which was a nice salad with spicy jalepeno cheese and chicken. A great looking caramel, earthy hopped brown ale worked perfectly for me. A nice session brown ale."
"Poured the color of cola with a one inch tan head that dissipated to nothing fairly quickly. Nice looking brown ale otherwise. Weak aroma was nothing special - maybe detected a little malt. Taste was good, though. Nice balance with a little taste of chocolate and roasted malt. A hint of coffee on the finish. No noticeable taste of alcohol or warming. Medium body with medium carbonation. Very drinkable beer."
"pours dark dark brown, mouthfeel is watery, taste is pretty good though, slight bitter hops, not too much though. little raisiny, quick finish, not getting a whole lot of flavor, but it does have a nice nut finish. I had higher hopes, but overall its drinkable, just not one i would seek out by any means."
"Overall not a bad brown ale. worth a try."
"Easy to drink, but a bit boring and average."
"Like single malt scotch, this is one drink that is individualized, not universal; some will love it above all, others won't."
"I think this may have been an older or just bad batch. There is no date anywhere on the packaging."
"D: Full flavor, but not filling. Moderate abv make it fairly drinkable."
"As the sips continued, the maltiness gained favor with my buds of taste. The beer had a very good feel in the mouth and the maltiness was not accompanied by the slug of bitterness like that of a stout or heavily hopped porter. The beer was quite pleasant to the taste and a nice deviation off the path of most other ales I've had. Subtle sweetness finally manifested as I got down to the bottom of the glass. This was really quite nice."
"Poured into a pint glass and is very dark clear appearance with a nice head. Smell is enticing and very appealing but I can not say exactly what it smells like. I mean I can not smell any grapefruit, bannana, chocolate, caramel, or floral or pine but that is what I like about the smell. It smells like Moose Drool! More importantly is the taste is excellant. It is like a battle between the sweet malt at first which gives way to the slight bitterness aftertaste then goes back to sweet, then again to bitter aftertaste. I like this beer more than Newcastle brown or Sam Adams Brown. This is my new favorite brown ale! You gotta love the beer if not the label! :)"
"6/4/7/3/14 (3.4/5)"
"D: not a big fan, has a big malty presence and soft sweet side. Still, it is worthy of getting a hold of and chugging one down"
"No complaints in drinkability, but nothing great either. A solid beer that I'm glad I got the chance to try."
"D - Yummy and not filling and not too expensive. i love this stuff"
"M/D - Light bodied and easy drinking. A nice session brew that I wish i had more access to."
"Mouthfeel is a bit light, with much carbonation and a lightly oily finish. A very drinkable, highly available brown ale."
"Notes from 06/30/04."
"I also rather enjoy the thought of drinking ""Moose Drool."" The novelty of it puts a smile on my face."
"Overall: It was a good beer not great. The finish is clean and refreshing"
"Drinkability is good. Overall, a very nice and sessionable brown ale."
"I think this one falls short of the mark. I don't like the subdued nose and taste. It also feels a little like you drank dust after its all said and done. Not a bad brew but also not great."
"Drinkability is pretty high, a satisfyingly robust American brown that's not to big, a very well done example of the style."
"D- Good session beer. Great with a home style chicken pot pie."
"Medium body, with lower carbonation. A very easy drinking session beer."
"Not a bad brown ale, definitely has a bit of complexity in the somewhat light taste, but nothing I will probably think to purchase in the future."
"I had heard good things about this beer, and I must say I was definitely not disappointed."
"The mouth is smooth and silky. I could session this one!"
"Appearance has a dark brown amber with a thin head. Smell is of roasted malts, coffee with a smokiness to it. Taste seems slightly watered down having a light smoke flavor thats nutty with the coffee and roasted malts. Mouthfeel is medium going down slick with good carbonation."
"I really like Big Sky. Their beers seem to have a little more character than the typical American Microbrew."
"(EDIT: kgotcher's review, which I read AFTER I reviewed this beer, seems to echo my thoughts exactly. Nice review kgotcher!)"
"D - I could drink this beer all evening long, with it's relatively low ABV of 5.1%, and perfect mix of sweetness and slight hoppiness. Great brown ale for the summertime. Not too filling at all. Great brew all around. It was definitely worth the shipping cost."
"I have found Big Sky beers to be on the Malty side which I really like. This is no dissapointment although there is a nice hop bite at the end."
" Moose Drool Brown Ale was deep mahogany in color with good clarity. It had a tan head with decent retention and left some lacing behind. The aroma was sweet toasty malt. The taste was roasted malt with some cocoa and some bitterness towards the dry finish. It was medium bodied with good carbonation. Drinkability was good. This is a decent brown ale."
"overall its a good beer that is relatively easy to drink."
"D - Overall I found this beer to be better than expected. Not life changing, not even a great example of the style, but not offensive, and a solid intro to craft beer for many of those macro drinkers looking for something more."
"Overall a very good beer and one of the better browns I've had recently."
"Medium body, smooth creamy feel. I like this brown's drinkability for sure. I had a second and would have had another had my group not decided to move on."
"D- very sessionable and enjoyable. i could go for more than one of these anytime. a really good beer that i wasnt expecting much out of. check this one out if you get the chance."
"Would gladly have again. I personally prefer a little more hop bite. But this is a fine example of the style."
"I'm not a big brown ale fan, and I guess this one tells me why - just not alot here to float my boat."
"Medium body, medium effervescence, slightly crisp and tingly. A decent beer but a little hoppy for a brown ale."
"not a bad beer overall - glad i tried it - won't go out of my way for it again."
"Drinkability: A very drinkable brew, good session beer, should the mood stir me. Hyped by one store beer geek, given an Seinfeld so-so shrug by another. I'm leaning toward the second... forgettable."
"Drinkability- This could make a decent session beer. It goes great with most meats and food in general."
"I enjoy this beer and love having it on-hand. My preference is to have it on its own or with a snack food."
"Pours a cola brown with ruby/amber highlights. Good two finger head two start that recedes to a tan filmy foam. The aroma is a mediumd roasted malts giving off notes light chocolate and pumpernickel bread. The taste starts with a dark toasted malt, then to a light roasted chocolate malt. The finish feels a bit chunky with a chocolate brownie bitter finish. Pretty nice English session beer from Montana. Love the name too."
"Deep mahogany color, with reddish higlights when held to the light. Light tan head slowly shrinks but never disappears and leaves some thin lace on my Moose Drool glass. Smells of malt and some toffee or caramel. Flavor is mot quite as strong as the aroma, slightly toasty and caramel malt. There is a bit of yeast finish. Some floral hops. Dry finish, medium body, not alot of carbonation. If it was available locally, would be very drinkable."
"Drinkability- I like this beer with food."
"I love the name and it really kind of tells you what its all about. My thought on real moose drool is that its thick and heavy. This is much like the beer. It's fairly good but a little to heavy for my pallet. My wife and I 1st tried this in a great place, which slips my mind, in fiddletown, CA. More of a novelty beer for me."
"Smooth dry, nutty taste. Got some creaminess that makes it really enjoyable to just let it sit in your mouth for an extra couple seconds before you swallow it. Pretty dark for a brown ale. Lacks the caramel sweetness of your typical brown ale - almost a crossover porter. Very satisfying, yet so good you'll want more than one. Highly recommend this one."
"d: I was on vacation at Glacier National Park 5 years ago when I was first getting into craft beer. I had several of these at the lodge during my visit and I loved it. After all these years, I still think this is pretty damn tasty. Thanks to JohnGalt1 for the trip down memory lane."
"D - Very easy drinking beer."
"I'm more of a ""red"" fan but this brown actually ahs a somewhat creamy feel to it. Not much carbonation or aroma, but the flavor has a bit of a kick at first, which mellows out in the middle, then has a heavy-medium after feel. Another reason for me to stop in at Fareway."
"Overall - Recommend trying this beer. Very enjoyable for a couple but not a session beer."
"$5.50 for a 25 ounce mug anytime at Kelly's Korner Tavern in Placentia, CA. Bargain!"
"This was a surprise I found in Tucson, Arizona. It was a very dark brew with a great head. It was it served in a pint glass. I was surprised of how thin the body was. When this beer was served to me it was not very cold, I wonder how this affected the characteristics of the body."
"I'm pleasantly surprised. This would be a nice session beer or something I'd be happy to find in one of those middling bars with nothing great on tap. And then I get to say ""Moose Drool", too. Win/win. Nice beer."
"I would probably drink another one, but not my favorite brown ale. Less acidity would have made this a more drinkable brew."
"Overall, pretty easy to drink, though I wouldn't go out of my way to search for this one."
"Pretty good brew, a little sweet for my tastes but well worth picking up."
"Notes: Decent brown, will drink again if in front of me."
"Simple and smooth."
"D: A fine enough pub brown ale from up in Montana, I've had better browns though."
"This brew pours a brown color, go figure. The head is white and rather large, but disappears within seconds. The aroma is outstanding. Nutty, creamy, and very strong. The taste isn't nearly as pronounced as the aroma, but is still ample and refreshing. It is nutty, and malty. The mouthfeel is a shade ligther than medium bodied, and there is a lot of carbonation. Overall, this is a damn good brown ale."
"Poured into a tasting glass. The color is dark reddish brown with a very slight tan lace head that disappears quickly. The nose is roasted malty sweetness, what you would expect for the style, but some chocolate notes are prominent in the background. There is an astringent character to the taste from the highly roasted malts. It is also a sweeter beer think, ""Very light porter"" in terms of flavor. The taste is unique given the style of the beer. The mouth feel is light, and the finish is quick and dry. This is a pretty drinkable beer, if you love roasted malts and sweet beers."
"Not my favorite brown, but it is still well crafted. This is a must if you prefer a nutty, dry brown ale."
"D: Roasted flavor takes away from the drinkability for me. Not quite as sweet and mellow as brown should be."
"Good beer...will drink this beer again. Wifey seasoned some hamburger with Curry powder and fresh onion and then I grilled them over the fire. This beer went along like it was made to! This beer goes well with beef over an open fire."
"Pours an amber tone that is closer to red. Predominant caramel and toffee aroma. A very full side of medium bodied and drinkable brown. Doesn't come off like a Nut Brown though. Extremely hard to come by on the east coast and worth it if you find it. Come on Montana...learn how to distribute!"
"Quite smooth and drinkable. A little too dry for the style but at least its not sticky either."
"Like a really silky, playful porter, this is way more fun than 99% of brown ales. It packs quite the punch of flavor, too, considering its modest ABV."
"Drinkability - better than expected, kinda had a low expectation for some reason (maybe the name), it's a drinkable beer but not one I would request or pick up again"
"M/D - Good carbonation and very smooth. Not my favorite brown, but still a good beer."
"Appearnance is a deep dark brown color, almost no head. Smell is light, some malt and that's about it. I'd heard about this beer from several people and I can't figure out what the big deal is. Taste was very average--some malt and carmel flavors, but very one-dimensional. Not a whole lot going on, and not enough carbonation. The whole thing tasted just a bit flat. It was OK to drink, and I could have have another with no problem, but I'd have preferred a better beer if given a choice."
"Mouthfeel and drinkabnility arent really here on this one. Not bad, but not great."
"I don't have an incredibly descriptive way to put it other than this Brown Ale is the best I have ever tried. There may be another out there that is better, but I have yet to find it."
"Notes: Had this beer on tap at a ski bar in big sky, montana. great dark color - darker than any brown i have ever had. As far as browns go, this ones pretty good. Full bodied with a nice, creamy mouthfeel. Hard to drink more than one of these, though. Not my favorite beer from the breweries out here in montana, but im glad i tried it."
"Dark brown rich colored pour with a nice tan head. Smells of light to medium roasted malts, light coffee notes and a touch of metal. Taste is tart rich roasty maltiness, but relatively thin bodied. Not a bad brown. Has a nice flavor but would like it to be a little thicker. Sort of cold coffee like."
"I poured it into a pint glass, it has a beautiful brown color, not too dark, with a dark tan head. The beer cascaded nicely as I poured it. There is a gentle hop aroma, nothing big. The taste is wonderfully malty, but not too sweet. This is a dark brew that I could drink a lot of, but that's why we get married."
"Drinkability is easily the strong point of this beer. Moose Drool just hits the right harmonies to make a beer that I just call damn good. This is one of those beers I could drink all the time or be deserted on an Island with and be happy. One of the easiest beers to drink that exists."
"Beer poured brown with red undertones. The tan head disapated farily quickly. Nose is lightly malty with slightly sweet undertones. Taste is of chocolate malts that are slightly toasted with light hopping in the finish. Mouthfeel is lighter than I would expect from the style but it is fairly smooth. Overall drinkabilty is good. There is something about this beer that keeps me coming back. It is very enjoyable and easy to drink!"
"Overall, i really enjoyed this, its a very good sessionable beer that I will be purchasing again"
"12oz. bottle: This one pours a clear, slightly ruby tinged darker brown. There was a bit of an off-white head on mine. The aroma is a bit lighter, but good. Fainter notes of chocolate and toffee. Some sweetness to the nose. Lightly sweet notes of chocolate and some caramel. Not enough hops to be noticeable, but enough to balance the beer nicely. I could drink quite a few of these."
"The only down point to this beer is the smell. Other than that, a really nice beer."
"I am going to make this my baseline brown ale from this point forward; I've enjoyed it too many times to count, and Moose Drool is one of my goto beers when I can't decide on anything else... Big Sky makes some very good beers.. Love their bottled brews and am a huge fan of the stuff that they only sell at the brewery."
"Pours dark brown with streaks of red upon close inspection. Head fades quickly with the lacing not far behind. Smells of dark chocolate, coffee, malts and nuts and is typical of other browns, albeit a little more aromatic and bold, which is a plus for me in regards to this style. Tastes of caramel, some syrupy sugars and a good balance of malts and hops. Drinkability is superb, and is deceptively light-bodied, almost feeling thicker than it really is, a fact I attribute to it's tastiness. I haven't tried a brown ale in a while because I became disappointed with the somewhat weak feel common to many brews of the style. This one bucks that trend. A true winner I will revisit in the near future."
"Chestnut in color with a tan head and alittle lacing. Taste was molasses, and nut predominantly. A little thin on the body but overall not a bad brew, consistent and middle of the road for the style . Wouldn't turn this down and when i'm in the Denver area next Oct. i'll seek out more from this brewer."
"Drinkability: I usually avoid craft brews with clever names because the actual product is often substandard. I got this one after someone dropped a six-pack and the survivors ended up in the singles bin at my local liquor store. This is actually a good brew with a clever name. I was pleasantly surprised."
"Decent, but not exactly something I will be trying again."
"Not sure if anticipation was different, but just thinner than I expected but could easily put down many of these in a night."
"Pours a watery dark brown color with a off white, light brown color 2 inch head. The head is a very nice fluffy texture that builds up well inside my pint glass. The once and beautiful head dies down to leave a slim layer on top of the brown nectar. Smell is a sweet malty aroma followed by some hazlenut and vanilla, and brown sugar, and molasses. Taste is of a muted arrangement of the aroma, followed by a tiny tinge of hops. Watery texture at first followed by a smooth, and silky finish."
"One of the best brown ales I've tried in awhile. For the longest time I'd avoided this beer because of its name. Well, don't judge a beer by its label. This is a really nicely done brown and and a great drinker."
"Pours a dark reddish brown with a big tan head but very little lace. The aroma is more what I would expect from a porter with notes of raisin and molasses, maybe a little smoke. The first taste reveals a surprisingly thin bodied, somewhat watery brew but it has a nice flavor dominated by charcoal. There is a subtle nutty undertone, a nice bitterness and very drinkable. Not very complex but enjoyable. Mildly carbonated, sort of refreshing for a dark beer. It finishes somewhat dry with that bitter aftertaste. Not bad, recommeded for a try."
"So easy to drink - great session beer - flavorful but not too complex or aggressive. I am not a huge fan of brown ales, but enjoyed this on."
"Even though Iam not the biggest fan of this style of brew I enjoy a good quaffing brown from time to time thats why I grabbed this when given the chance.Poured into a standard pint glass a deep chestnut colored brown with 1/2 finger slight off white head that held good retention,unsweetenend chocolate and earth stick out most in the nose not sweet by any means wich is nice.Starts out with chocolate presence on the palate more of a lightly sweet chocolate not much sweetness a little nutty but not overly roasted either finishing earthy.A solid quaffing brown with just enough sweetness to make it a little interesting,a pretty good session brown here."
"Overall an okay beer. Not great, but okay. I have had better browns. Would drink again but not seek it out specificaly."
"Drinkability: Part of a mixed 12 pack. A very nice brown ale that may be making its way back to my fridge in the form of a six pack. For overall enjoyment this beer was my favorite of the Big Sky mixed pack."
"Typical of the style, and certainly better than some others of its ilk, but like so many brown ales, so insanely hard to get excited about. Maybe they're just not my thing, but I love the name and label!"
"D: Quite drinkable. Maybe I'd get tired of the malty sweetness after awhile, but I'd love to put that to the test. Too bad I can't get it in OKC."
"Drinkability: Still in the search for my favorite brown ale,this is not a bad one,can drink again if i found it."
"Pours a molasses color with minimal head. It leaves very little lacing as well. A minute or two later it looks completely flat. Don't doing too well so far. The smell is better. Roasted malt, nuts, and a little coffee come through. Very pleasant. The taste is the same with the malt dominating. Get a bit of a coffee aftertaste. It feels relatively thin for a brown ale and it is an inactive beer which doesn't help. I would of like a little carbonation and hops in the beer."
"Comment: Its a good (not great) brown ale with a low alcohol content that remains well hidden."
"This is the only area in which this brew is lacking. Carbonation is right but the body tends toward watery. Still, this brew does nothing to detract from my love of brown ales and this would be a fridge fixture if readily available."
"The taste has some chocolate malt notes and some nutty flavour and a very mild hop presence in the background. It finishes on a fruity note and the aftertaste is short. Medium carbo and a good mouthfeel for the style. Here's a good transition beer for those who may be a bit timid about trying something new. I think it's a good example of the style."
"Would have again, but nothing I would go out of my way for"
"drinkability is good for a brew with this much complexity. for the flavors, the mouthfeel is a bit thin, but a couple of these would do down easy. cheers!"
"Pours like a brown ale, very dark brown with some ruby if held to the light. Smells of toasted hazelnut and vanilla. Tastes of hazelnut, vanilla and a slight bitter finish of hops. Feels light in the mouth with a little tickle of carbonation. Drinkable but not a session beer. All in all its an average brown ale that is worth a try."
"This is a pretty dark brown color, with a thick, kaki colored head. Aroma is a little nitty, and some hoppy notes. Taste is very plesant, very smooth, chocalety flavor, with a nice finish. I like to have some of this in the fridge, and nice beer, that is very easy to drink."
"The taste has a good roasted nuttiness about it. Coffee and chocolate notes are here, too, but too slight to earn high marks, even for an English Brown. The mouthfeel is refreshing, but a bit flat on the tongue. The aftertaste is a plesent reminder of the malty flavor. The drinkability of Moose Drool is great, especially on a hot day in Montana. It could stand to have a bit more complexity, but nevertheless, it's a fantastic session EBA."
"Curiosity finally got me to try this. The appearance was decent, an opaque brown hue with very little foam from the tap. Maybe it was the surrounding environment, but the aroma was very faint and difficult to pick up. But when it came to the taste ... whoa ... starts with a chocolatey, malty, bready taste, and finishes with just the right touch of hop bitterness ... Excellent job. will definitely add this one to the beer rotation."
"Drinkability: Very very drinkable, especially for its apparent heaviness. Great sessionable brew. If I'm ever back in Montana I'll definitely pick up another sixer of these, and perhaps something else fro Big Sky. This is quality stuff that I may even try to have shipped out to me."
"I'm glad I tried it and may try again if I come across it. I won't be seeking it out though."
"altogether a tasty, well crafted brew."
"Notes: This beer has quite a nostalgic effect for me. It was the first beer that got me into craft beer."
"This is a obviously a well-crafted beer, and I look forward to tasting more of Big Sky's offerings, if I ever come across any!"
"Poured a solid, dark brown color, with only a little head, and carbonation bubbles dancing around. Smelled rich and nutty. Tasted like a cross between a Brown Ale and a Porter. Flavorful, with a full malt character that gave way to tastes of roasted nuts and burnt coffee. Leaves a wet lingering taste. A heavy mouthfeel, but a bit too carbonated. I enjoyed this beer, and I would recommend giving it a try, but I doubt I would get it again."
"Semi dry finish with a metallic edge leaves a little to be desired, nothing much remains in the mouth. Sessionable beer."
"This Moose Drool from Big Sky Brewing Co. could be my next go to brew. Smooth, pleasant, and very thirst quenching If I start to drink this brew, Big Sky will have to add a second shift at the brewery."
"Appearance was good; a nice dark brown with a very industrial looking head of consistantly sized tiny bubbles. Flavor was good; a light chocolate roastiness and some very faint bourbon notes. Flavor was more good roastiness, but contained some sour notes that I really didn't feel belonged in the beer. Not bad, but not highly recommended."
"a very solid brown. rich in color with a hint of ruby, half inch head that leaves a nice lacing. sweet nose, malty. nice flavors, nutty and malty and a bit biscuity. medium in body with a nice bite of carbonation. a good session beer and a welcome suprise to see at a gas station."
"I'm not a big brown ale guy but I enjoyed this one just fine. Love the name too. ark brown body had a thin tan head that retained well and left nicely patterned and wispy lacing. Not much aroma really but malt aroma was earthy and inviting. Excellent balance with smooth malt dominating. A touch of tart hop rounds it out. A very enjoyable and drinkable ale."
"Nicely done brown. Good balance and easy to drink. Nice session beer."
"D- great American brown, sessionable, complex, try a session"
"This is an old fav on draft here - very easy going and well balanced. Served with a light head, almost no lace. very dark brown color, Roasty, malty, toffee nose. Flavor's easy. Very drinkable. almost no hops. Nice finish. A lurking dryness that isn't so obvious. But it adds to the overall appeal and make it work so well. Great beer!"
"Poured into a kitchen glass. Poured a nice dark brown that was mostly opaque in the middle, but you could see through the edges. Had a 1/2 inch head that was large bubbles that lasted most of the beer. Smelt like brown sugar with hints of oats. Tastes like brown bread with some sweetness. Mouthfeel was ok. It was a little thin in the mouth, with the bubbles from the head tingling in the mouth. Taste was solid, however the bubbles definately took away from the enjoyability of the beer."
"Not a bad brew, but certainly not my favorite."
"This was a very nice beer when I was first exposed to it on tap at the downstairs pub in the Nugget Casino (Sparks, NV). However, when I it on tap at Red's Old 395 Grill (Carson City, NV) it tasted much more watery and not near as flavorful. I'm now wondering if the Nugget's keg has not sold well and it has aged in the process. If so, this beer is far better aged. I based my review on the beer as I first encountered it in Sparks, NV."
"D: The ale is a pleasing drink, nutty enough to really stand out in a crowd."
"Id have no problem sitting down with a sixer of these on a spring day."
"Shipped back from Denver. Poured from a 12oz bottle with no obvious dating system (some laser stuff on neck but didn't look like a date) into a pint glass. Was dark brown and slightly mahogany in color. Had a 2+ finger head that was light beige in color. It settled into a thin foam with good lacing. The smell was malty with some sweetness but generally weak as I tend to find in the style. The taste is good and solid. It won't knock you off your feet but has that can't stop drinking it quality. This would make a great session beer. Overall, I really like it and could drink several at a time. If available here it would be in my session beer rotation. Recommend. (4, RR, T, Y)"
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability: Nice, actually a bit heavier than I might like a brown session ale to be, but a good, if somewhat off-style, flavor."
"Overall I am glad I tried it, but I feel they need to push this one a bit, bring out more of the flavors that are there to the front and let it shine!"
"Poured into a pint after letting it warm up for 5 min. Dark brown in the glass, and ruby red when held up to the light, nice frothy tan head. Smells of toasted grains and dried fruit. Nice and malty sweet, but not cloyingly so, with just a whisper of hop bitterness on the finish for balance. Smooth and creamy going down, this beer makes me want to have another right after. Delicious and balanced, great for a session."
"This beer is fantastic. I'll be buying more and recommending this one often."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a nice chewiness. Plenty of carbonation that works in well with the beer overall. Drinkability is pretty high here...would be a nice six pack to bring to a party. A tasty brown ale and the first Big Sky brew I've sampled...I will be on the lookout for this one again and more of their lineup as well!"
"More of a stout than a brown ale I think. Still, not bad."
"D: Tasty, goes down easy, not too filling, its a good beer to stick with if you want something flavorful but easy. I have to admit that Im starting to like this style more and more, even though I usually prefer more of a kick in the ABV department."
"Dark brown and copper in color with a quarter inch beige head. Smells of grains- barley, and malt. Slight hint of hops. First taste is sweet and malty with a coppery/ metalic finish. Actually, the more you have, the smoother it becomes. The last bit of the glass was definately better than the first. A drinkable beer with a cool name. ? The first of the FC Holiday reviews."
"This one is decent, but, for me, just fell shy of being anything really ""good"". Just a little too astringent. A little too sweet, a little too restrained. But, I did like the cocoa/chocolate hints and it's not at all bad."
"I got this from my VP as his brother sends him a case or two every year around Christmas. I wouldn't mind at all if this was local. Thanks!"
"The beer poured into the glass a dark brown with mild orange highlights. It was topped by a thin fizzy head that dissipated quickly into the glass, and left no lace. The nose is dominated my malt. Dark caramel, mild fig, a light hazelnut quality. There is a mild citrus character on the finish. The flavor echoes the flavor. More of th dark caramel, a light touch of walnut with just a hint of citrus bitterness on thee finish. The mouth feel is thicker than I anticipated. It's slightly smooth and rich. Very easy drinking beer, and certainly better than I expected."
"Overall, a tasty quaffing balanced brown ale. It deserves the great rep. Reminds me of tree bark. Tasty tree bark."
"Drinkability/notes: Very pleasant and drinkable, a fine example of the style."
"D - A good brown ale to enjoy in the evening. I actually had mine with a grilled cheese sandwich...worked well together! If you see one of these around, I'd suggest trying it."
"Drinkability: One of the most adorable labels I've seen lately, but nevertheless this beer didn't leave much of an impression on me."
"The pour was a nice deep chocolate color and a thick tan head with great retention eventually leaving a very nice lace. The aroma was a nice balance of malt and hops. The flavor was a very nice mild malt with just enough hops presence to tone down the sweetness. The mild carbonation and well balanced flavors make for a comfortable mouthfeel and very good drinkability. Overall, this brew will always have a spot in my fridge."
"This beer is chocolate brown in color with an extremely creamy texture. It's malty beer with just enough hop presence to keep it from being too sweet. The aroma mostly comes from the malt with a hint of spice added by the hops. This beer has caramel, chocolate, whole black malts; and hops."
"I'll just have to get a horse, just about this big, to go along with my dental floss ranch. (Frank Zappa reference. Listen to ""Montana"".)"
"I have to thank our own personal Rhode Island Santa, Beerguy for bringing this one back on one of his excursions. Definetly the best brown ale i have ever had in my life. Chocolater Brown in color and with a nice head. YOu could really smell the chocolate and caramel malts. Had such a creamy texture. Would love to try again."
"N- I really enjoy this beer. Just an all around great brown ale. I'd grab a Moose Drool insted of a Newcastle any day. Good beer to drink on a nice hot summer day."
"Awsome beer, the only problem I have is that I probably wouldn't want to drink a lot of it. But I would love to drink again."
"I got this beer from my girlfriends mom. She had taken a trip and brought this beer back with her. I really enjoyed this beer. Only the second brown ale i have tryed. The first being New Castle. I have to say this beer had a better flavor. To me the flavors were more complex, in a good way though. I have to say i am new to the beer advocate scene and i hope more brown ales taste like this."
"Poured more red than brown, but had a real nice head with good retention. Smell was nice and malty, smells of nuts and some dark fruit. Smell was appetizing, taste was rather weird. I kept getting a rather dry green bean taste. I don't think I've experienced that before, especially in a brown. Mouthfeel felt overcarbonated and light in body. Not very good, but I might have gotten a bad bottle. Started out promising, finished not so good."
"malt and the bitterness is what made me want more than just one moosedrool."
"I like the combination of flavors in this brew....a surprising brown."
"Notes: Compared to other browns I've had this is much more in your face with the toasted grains. Interesting enough to find my fridge again, but nothing to hunt down."
"Slainte!"
"The beer poured a deep, dark mahogany color, just a little too light to be classified as black. I could tell that the beer had a nice body by the way it poured; it came out of the bottle in a nice thick stream. The head of the beer came up to be about a half an inch thick, keeping its form for about a minute. It had a luscious tan color and a rich consistency. After a minute of keeping its form, the head eventually dissipated to a thin film in the glass. The beer smelled of strong bittering hops, toasted caramel malts, two-row barley malts, molasses, and brown sugar. Overall, it was an inviting smell, a little bitter at first, but once the nose acclimates, it has a wonderful smell. The smell, at first, made me a little uneasy about the beer, but once I tasted it, my problems were resolved. The smell had a bit of an off aroma to it; perhaps it was the bittering hops. The taste did not reflect the initial smells; in fact the beer tasted almost sweet. The toasted malts came out nicely, as did the molasses and brown sugar. The hops played a nice role initially in balancing out the brew so it did not become overwhelmingly sweet on the tongue. The aftertaste is particularly pleasant; it is very reminiscent of sweet dark bread. This taste holds true for about two thirds of the glass, when the brew turns a little hoppier. At this point, the beer becomes a little bitterer, and different malt flavors come to the forefront on the tongue, namely caramel malts. The mouth feel remains the same, staying thick but smooth, almost chewy. At the end of the glass, some of the flavors from the beginning come back, leaving the finish smooth and sweet."
"D: I've had this many times before and I remember it being better than this. This is the most popular beer probably in all of Montana, but probably my least favorite from Big Sky. Proof that having a catchy name sells beer."
"Looks nice with good head retention and a pretty good lacing. Color isn't so much brown, but it is dark. Sweet and raosty smell made me think this would be a good brown ale, but not so. Taste is green beans(?), roastiness and slight chocolate malts. It's off-putting. Mouthfeel is bad, just not very good. Overall this scared me and I wouldn't have another."
"Medium bodied beer. Mouthfeel is slightly thinner than I prefer, but very nice overall. Clean mouthfeel. Well balanced. Very easy to drink. Highly sessionable. Not very complex in flavors, but a nice tasty brew."
"Aftertaste is pleasant although not my preferred, overall. Still a very drinkable beer for a few with a good beefy or beany meal. Coincidence that we're watching Brokeback Mountain, I should have cooked something other than sausage to eat with this good Montana beer, however."
"The beer pours a deep brown color with hints of red and a light lacing. It has a toasted malt smell. The taste starts with a toasted grainy malt flavor with hints of chocolate and finishes with a crisp nutty bite. The beer is clean and refreshing. It has a nice bite and a fresh after taste. In all the beer is smooth and well blended, very drinkable."
"The smell is strong and pleasing. Nuts, toffee, and chocolate add to a nice deep malt base. The taste is smooth, with mostly malts up front. Nuts and chocolate take over through the finish. The mouthfeel is somewhat light but still solid."
"I put some classical music on, sat on the couch and poured into my pint glass. A deep ice-t brown with a solid half inch of oatmeal colored head filled my glass. Pleasant scents of roasted malts and nuts waffed up to my nose. The taste was of a faintly bitter, somewhat nutty roasted malts all in harmony complimenting each other. A good all around flavor. Nicely carbonated, smooth with a medium mouthfeel. Quite easy to drink. this was a pleasnt surprise."
"Moose Drool Brown Ale is a very good bridge between a brown ale and a stout. Its appearance is that of a dark brown, like that of fine antique furnature. The beer has the bitterness in the after taste that is familiar with a stout, however it has the more complex presentation of flavours that comes from a brown ale. Think of it as a black and tan, but as one beer. The bitterness in the after taste is delightful at first, but as I got closer to the bottom the glass, it became more and more prevelant and almost undesireable to drink. Unfortunately I was not able to sample this beer on draught, only in bottled form."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is medium bodied. The beer doesnt really go to any extremes in smell or flavor. This is the kind of beer you could drink all day long."
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle to a dark brown color with hints of red, thick tan head and good lacing. Aroma was very much a nutty malt. Chocolate and caramel malts dominated the flavor. Had an okay finihhs, but nothing spectacular. I had a friend from Montana highly recommend this, and while it is not my favorite beer or style, it wasn't bad for a Brown Ale."
"Pours a deep, dark mahogany, with a frothy tan head which settles quickly and leaves minimal lacing. Fruity on the nose, cherries and plums, a bit of pineapple and plenty of friendship cake. Carbonation reminds me of fizzy soda. Tangy, a bit tart, but ultimately rather sweet and maybe a bit uninteristeng to me. I've had this beer numerous times on draught and in bottles, but I'm tasting something new this time. Bitterness is very well restrained, but more prominent than I remember, which is a good thing, as this beer has always struck me as sweet and one-dimensional in the past. Mouthfeel is light but smooth, and works well with the tanginess. For whatever reason (is this an old bottle?) this beer seems to have come into its own, either the recipe and brewing process has been stableized and become more consistent or I'm just in the mood for a tasty British style brown ale this morning, but this is really working for me. Not my favorite in the style (I certainly have other favorite brown ales on either side of the style spectrum) and I know it ain't right to hold a grudge forever (Moose Drool had a Fat Tire-like word of mouth a number of years back, causing me some consternation at retail), so I'll have to give Moose Drool credit where credit is due: it's a solid, tasty brew."
"Drinkability: while winding down an evening outside my hotel room enjoying the sunset over the central Washington mountains, I drank a few of these without pulling out an alternative from the cooler. Just as simple and enjoyable session beer that goes down easy."
"ABV 5.3%"
"Overall- An easy beer to chug! Nice flavor and feel. Not a BIG ale here but a nice easy 1."
" A good all purpuse soild go to beer. Damn i've had ton's of west coast brown's lately and this hold's it's own. Nothing to seek out, just another solid brown ale."
"D: Not flawed, but not the best brown ale I've enjoyed, either. Wouldn't refuse one if offered, but wouldn't seek one out. Worthy of a try..."
"D - Drinkable. A nice tasty brew."
"D- get one and then get a different one to catch up"
"Pours with some nice carbonation and a decent head that quickly subsides. Supple, inviting and deep brown body. Toasted and vienna malts in the nose, along with warm, spicy yeasts provide a classic brown ale aromatic profile. The palate opens up with zesty carbonation and a slight brown ale sourness, then moves to a metallic tinge and then a sustained grainy note that hangs onto the tongue for a long finish. Mouthfeel is full and round and quite substantial for a brown ale. Highly drinkable and, I would think, an excellent food accompaniment."
" It was a real treat to be in the region and get a couple of really fresh pints on tap. Don't pass up a chance to try this one on tap. Quite a treat."
"This is a very drinkable beer, and I would certainly have it again. I think Moose Drool would be especially good as a winter beer. Its tasty, has a nice combination of flavors, and robust but smooth mouth feel. Very nice."
"Very sweet malty aroma is breadier than many Browns and almost touches on the Malt aroma of a Malta pop. Brown with amber hues and a quickly diminishing tan head. Big chocolate/caramel/malt powder punch in the fore. Some fruity apple notes in the middle and a mildly dry nutty finish. I just had the Deschutes Brown Ale and along with this one it gives me hope that there are still very good Brown Ales being made today."
"Simple but nice, easy drinking session brew."
"Drinkability comes straight from taste, and based on my rating of the taste, don't even think about drinking this one."
"Da solid brown ale. Easy to drink and could be a good session beer"
"Ruby brown color. Malt accented aroma, with tiramisu hints, mocha and hazelnut, nuts and caramel, and spicy hops, though light. Herbaceous and medicinal flavors with toasty accents and coffee and chocolate flavors. Light hop contribution and a fairly creamy and full body. Maybe it isnt all in the name."
"Drinkability: Certainly an enjoyable brown with enough flavor to make it interesting"
"I was a bit skeptical about this beer at first because I have never been very fond of brown ales, but I have to admit that I really liked it. It poured out to a nice mahogany-brown color without too much head and little lacing, and the mouthfeel was delightfully in between too thick and too thin. As Goldilocks would say, just right. The taste was nutty and earthy. Very easy to drink and I can imagine it as a good substitute for your typical party beers during the cooler months."
"Dark Mohagony color with a thick Tan Head. Decent lacing and head retention. Not very much aroma at first but as it warmed Earthy Roasted tones arose. Taste had a mild flavor of Roasted Malts but needs more. Warm and smooth going down. Easily drinkable."
"Pours out a deep brown color with a head slightly less than 2 fingers. It smells a little sweet and nutty. The taste is a little sweet as well. The hops are subtle. It has a nice chocolate and roasted malt flavor. It goes down smooth and crisp."
"This would make a good beer to introduce to someone whose idea of a dark beer is Newcastle. The slightly hoppy contrast might actually get them to move on to more adventurous beers. I'm relatively surprised I haven't reviewed this before, as it's my regular brown ale (which is not saying much, since I tend to only drink browns occaisionally). One could do a lot worse than this."
"Taste had an initial bite then a nice smooth chocolate/coffee flavor with some molasses and roasted malt. Then the hops hit again. Nice finish."
"I often have a hard time on beers with cute names, but I'm really glad I got around to trying this one - it's quite good!"
"Taste; this pretty follows the smell. There's a slightly roasted nut flavor, with chocolate malts. The finish has a bit of hop bitterness going on. Mouthfeel is a bit thin but not bad, and is an ejoyable and very sessional beer. Thanks to bditty187 for picking this up for me."
"Dark brown body with a half-inch of head, some lacing. Smell is a little weak. Aroma of dark malts. Taste is sweet with notes of brown sugar, molasses and roasted malts. Not a big tasting beer, fairly simple, but very well done. Tastes good, goes down nice, the key elements of a nice session beer."
"Good thirst quencher, and dessert too. I'm smitten by this uncomplicated by well-made beer."
"The taste is light and has an up front soft sweetness that quickly picks up notes of lightly roasted coffee. The finish is quite lone and makes me think of brown, richly toasted malt that lingers on the tongue with a slightly astringent quality to it. This beer is quite the easy quaffer, tasty enough to be interesting, but light enough to be a session beer. This is really an enjoyable beer, perhaps a tad simplistic, but sometimes that is what really hits the spot."
"Enjoi"
"Had it again later, this time from the bottle and it lost a bit of its charm but that's to be expected."
"Drinkability: Goes down easy, but holds your attention. A very pleasant brew."
"Overall I was slightly disappointed, mainly becasue it was talked up before I had it. Also with a name like Moose Drool you want it to be awesome"
"I will buy this next time I see it! Quite a tasty beer!"
"Wicked-cool aluminum bottle with an image of a moose holding a fishing reel. Obtained from Thompson Valley Liquor (Colorado)...thanks, Clint & Jeff! Pours a one finger tan/light brown head over a crystal clear dark brown liquid with some ruby character. Smells chocolate. Dry chocolate with an underlying malt sweet. Partially buried are hazelnut and caramel. Tastes wet sweet with a dry chocolate malt and a hint of sourish grains...almost caramel-like. Some hop bitter comes across as a nice grassy counterpoint to the chocolate and sweet. Aftertaste is dry chocolate that persists evenly for a lo-oong time. It's a nice brown ale, not a beer that knocks my socks off. Very enjoyable. Md-light body and modestly carbonated. Minimal lacing on the inside of the glass."
"Overall: A nice English brown, but when you pour a pint for a friend be sure to give 'em the bottle."
"Bottle: Poured a very dark brown color ale with a medium foamy off-white head with better then average retention. Aroma of molasses is quite dominant. Taste is also dominated by this strong molasses feeling, which doesnt do it for me. Tasted like bad extract homebrew kit. Cant see why this is rated so high"
"Body is a hair below medium, with a smooth creamy mouthfeel. Average drinkability. Probably better on tap."
"Overall this is a great brown ale, another one of those wonderful beers that is so hard to find in New England."
"Drinkability: Despite the unpalatable name (:P) this is a decent, drinkable brown, worthy of a try."
"A nice beer- I like this! I bet it's really good sitting the pub!"
"Overall, decent but nothing to write home about. A solid backyard brew."
"This brew pours a brown color, go figure. The head is white and rather large, but disappears within seconds. The aroma is outstanding. Nutty, creamy, and very strong. The taste isn't nearly as pronounced as the aroma, but is still ample and refreshing. It is nutty, and malty. The mouthfeel is a shade ligther than medium bodied, and there is a lot of carbonation. Overall, this is a damn good brown ale."
"A dark brown beer with deep ruby highlights. Has a small light brown head. The aroma has a malty sweet character with some earthy notes and a light nutty background. The flavor starts with a perky sharpness. Then the sweet malty character takes over with carmel and hints of coffee intermingiling and a light roasted malt bitterness on the finish."
"not amazing, but tasty nonetheless. perhaps too much hop presence for an english?"
"Pint at Dotty Dumpling's Dowry in Madison, WI."
"Similar in flavors with little complexity from grain bill. Powdered chocolate follows a sweet caramal start. Light bodied and underhopped (IMHO) with weak bitterness in the finish. A brief but sharply astringent bite in the aftertaste-seemed out of place."
"Poured a mahogany brown with garnet highlights and a small off-white head. Quite nice to look at. Smells similar to Newcastle, but perhaps a little spicier and a little nuttier. Flavor follows suit, strikingly similar to Newcastle, my old favorite, but subtley spicier and nuttier. Flavor is really quite mellow and along with the smooth mouthfeel makes for an easy-drinkin' summer session beer. Didn't blow me out of the water, but was enjoyable nonetheless."
"Had this on-tap at the Silver Dollar in Madison while waiting to play shuffleboard. It looked good, dark brown with a creamy, tan head. I've had this in the bottle before, but not lately, and was surprised by how spiced it smelled, almost like a witbier. As opposed to disaster that was the Angelic Nut Brown, which I had earlier that night, this departure from the typical brown style was subtle and appreciated. Flavor had a nice sweet/bitter balance, with some really good chocolate hints that kicked in as it warmed. Pleasant to drink, thick and coating. Very solid brown."
"D-Very nice brown ale with some good American hops. This is a well put together beer and is good to style."
"Overall Impression: Very rich and full for a brown ale. Good flavor, great nose, solid beer. That paper note really distracted me from enjoying it fully."
"Pours a very deep mahogany color, nearly opaque with a tan head. Toasted grains dominate the nose. Very simple and forward with a medium-body featuring dark roasted malt notes while not becoming at all bitter. Very nicely balanced. Highly reccomended."
"All in all, it's a nice beer. Other than the slight metallic taste I really have nothing bad to say. It just doesn't excite me all that much either. Personally, I think Lost Coast's Downtown Brown is a better English Brown, and it's brewed a few blocks from my house so it's always fresh. But I would'nt turn this down, either."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" tan head above the reddish brown brew. Head holds its own, and laces well. Aroma is almost all nutty malts, with just a touch of hoppiness. Taste is excellent, nutty malt agains, with a slight fruit finish, and a kind of crisp hop close. Mouthfeel is spot on for a brown, and drinkability is excellent as well. Nice one here."
"I really enjoyed this brew. The pour was fantastic with a great dark brown color that left a huge head and great lacing. The scent was not too powerful but I could detect notes of sweet malts and nuttines. The taste of this beer was great as well with some slight smokiness to it along with a nice nutty malt flavor. The hops snuck in there a little bit but not much. This is a very drinkable beer and one that could be sessionable if it were not so costly here on the west coast!"
"Pours a tremendously dark brown color with a big head depending on the pour. Smell is burnt, like hops and coffee. The taste is similar.. the first is of burnt hops almost like a stout then the nuts come in and wash it down. Defininitly takes a few sips to get used to as the taste is pretty unconventional, but well worth the money."
"Nice dark color, with just a hint of maroon tinted light shining through. Head is large at first, 3/4"" but fades to a respectable 1/4"" and stays there. Roasted malt in the nose, milk chocolate and hazelnuts. Taste is rich and full, sweet but not cloying. Good chocolate presence, and slightly nutty, hops finish is also up to, if not better than, par. Full yest slick mouthfeel, with fairly high carbonation levels. A solid brown ale that I haven't visited in a very long time, and that is good despite the cutesy name."
"12 oz bottle with no freshness date. Pours clear, dark, ruby-brown. Frothy two-finger head that is gone by the time the beer is, but leaves sticky lace. Nose is sweetmalt, grains, a bit of caramel, suggestions of black molasses. Nice. Taste is sweet dark malt, nicely offset by hops. Nuttiness and hints of chocolate, then nutty, slightly astringent dry finish, but not unpleasant at all. Lightly carbonated, moderate mouthfeel. This drinks rather easily."
"This beer pours a dark amber. The head is light tan. It fades rather fast. It leaves very few laces. It smells nutty. It also smells of caramel. It is also slightly malty. It also had a very slight smokey aroma. This beer is nutty tasting. It tastes sweet and malty. It has a caramel taste to it. Also, maybe a slightly coffee taste. Thia beer is very smooth. It leaves a nutty aftertaste that is appealing. It is carbonated just right. This beer is a gerat session beer. The alcohol content is low. The flavor is mild and smooth, so it dosent get old. I think this beer is under rated. If you ever get a chance to try this beer, you should. Until recently, it was unavailable in Southern California, but now, I will probably buy it quite often."
"I've seen this beer for years, even before I was into craft brews, but never picked it up. I'm glad I finally did, because it's a nice brew!"
"Pours a light brown color with a small head that dies off quickly and leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma has a lot of caramel and nutty character. The flavor is mostly comprised of a mixture of the caramel malts and the nuttiness. Not overly interesting, but still respectable."
"12oz. bottle poured into a snifter. It pours a deep ruby-brown color with one finger of head. There is just a little bit of lacing. The smell is fairly light, but has some good caramel aromas and a slight nuttiness. The taste is very sweet and has lots of roasted malt character. There's lots of caramel sweetness, and not too much else going on. The mouthfeel is decent, and the drinkability is good too. A fairly nice brown ale."
"This beer has been waiting in my cellar for a long ass time. It pours a very dark amber color, bordering on brown. The head is pretty much non-existant. There is a small ring of foam along the top of the beer. The nose is rather catholic, some sweet caramel tones, a slight nuttyness. Just sort of there. The flavor is a little more nutty than the nose. There is a slight butteryness in there as well. I want a little more roastyness. The feel is just a slight bit shy of moderate. Just a little bit of watery character. Overall, this is a pretty average beer. At least the name is fun."
"An interesting brown ale. Definitely drinkable, and enjoyable, but there are plenty of better American browns out there."
"Decent brown ale but didn't quite come together for me."
"Felt very smooth and went down very easily. Was sweeter and more syrupy than I would expect an English Brown Ale to be. The smell did prove indicative of the initial taste, although where I expected it to give way to a somewhat hoppy finish, a thankfully subtle coffee flavour kicked in instead. I detest coffee, but this was subtle enough to be tolerable."
"Not a bad brown ale by any means and is quite palatable."
"Overall impression: Nice solid brown ale. Nicely drinkable - good for making it through those Montana winters."
"I sampled a glass bottle not a aluminum bottle. What were they thinking? It pours a dark reddish color and had a small head that dissipated quickly. The aroma is sweet, yeasty and buttery. The body is quite full and the flavor is a sweet and malty and has a dry nut-like character. All in all it's a pretty decent brown ale and worthy of being paired with a good meal."
"Moose Drool's clear, very deep mahogany body reveals glowing ruby higlights when held to the light. Its creamy, light tan head drops steadily; but it does leave some minor lace about the glass. In the nose, malt dominates with a lightly cocoaish and toffee-like character. Some mild yeasty fruitiness lends it a bit more character; and a swirl of floral and perfumey hops rounds it out. Smooth and lightly creamy across the palate, it's medium-light body and restrained carbonation level lend to it's malty character and help to boost its drinkability. All that the nose suggests and more is found in the flavor. It's maltiness is subtly toasty and toffee-ish with a sprinkle of cocoa powder. The yeasty fruitiness works its way through mid-palate; and then a cusp of roastiness and some mild grassy and floral hops appear in the finish. It's delicate, and therefore lightly balanced by a restrained bitterness. It finishes dry with some lingering malt and floral hops. Very nice! This is a surprisingly satisfying and drinkable beer that probably deserves more attention for its flavor than it gets for its name and aluminum bottle!"
"Got this one as a gift. It came in a very strange aluminum 14.5 oz. bottle that is evidently limited edition. Makes you curious at the least. The body poured a deep brown that has reddish tints. The head is quality, thick and consistent. The odor is enticing, highly malty and very nutty. The overall mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, quite a delight. I really love the great subdued nut flavor, its not overwhelming at all. Surprisingly, it was not dry at all in the finish, considering you usually get that feeling with a nutty tone. A high quality offering and certainly recommended."
"The beer itself was creamy and smooth with just the right amount of carbonation. The taste was malty sweet with a strong carmel taste that is offset by a hop flavor that keeps it from being to sweet. The finish is mildly dry. A great beer IMHO"
"Drinkability- Very drinkable beer. Have one left in one of those funky aluminum bottles. Good brown ale. A nice thirst quencher."
"Pours a deep, dark chestnut with a foamy, sugar-sparkling head that leaves snowdrifts of foam down the inside of the glass. The aroma ingratiates itself immediately after popping the bottle cap, and it's wonderful: sweet, roasty, with maple syrup and nut flavors. The taste of the beer contains all these elements, plus a light smokiness and some brown sugar flavors. The beer is much more robust than your traditional brown ales and even approaches American doppelbock territory, but in the end it is contained by a stern harness that keeps all the flavors in check. In fact, a little more blossoming flavor would be welcome here, as the end result is squeaky clean, even a bit watery. Still, the beer's big flavors are present without being cloying or overwhelming, and drinkability is high. A very pleasing beer and one of the best American browns to have wide availability."
"This is a terrificially balanced, smooth brown ale and also very drinkable."
"This beer pours a dark brown color with a tan head. The beer has a creamy malty flavor to it with traces of black malts and chocolate. Its some what bitter for a brown ale. But all in all it is a very good brown ale. I would have this at an outside cookout."
"A great session brew."
"The funny name and label disguise the fact that this is a decent American Brown Ale with a full bodied flavour. A sweetish malty midbody has just the right finish to make this very drinkable. I remember years ago getting on tap in Point Roberts and the memories were of an easy pint which is a good thing for a brown ale. This also works well with BBQ."
"I've heard good things about this beer. Cola colored w/ an off white head. Mild hop aroma mixed with sour roasted malt. Malty flavor, toasted, no hop flavor and slighty astringent taste, with a thin viscuous mouthfeel, which I would expect with a brown or mild ale. A good example of a brown ale."
"I didn't enjoy this beer quite as much as I enjoyed Big Sky's Scape Goat Pale Ale, but that probably has more to do with style preference than anything else. Although Moose Drool doesn't crack my brown ale top tier (and isn't really drool-worthy), it's still a worthwhile effort that is deserving of respect."
"I much prefer the dryer Northern style of Browns but this beer is not without merit."
"Over the past four years I have traveled and worked in Montana on Numerous occasions. Since my first trip there I have been hooked on this beer. The name itself is a turnoff for some but for others it makes it a must try. It pours a dark rich reddish brown with a thick foam. It has clean sweet smell followed with a sweet toasted taste. It is not too thick in the mouth and goes down quite smooth. After returning from Missoula a few weeks ago with only a twelve pack, I was ecstatic to find it being distributed just north in Wisconsin. A feild trip and four cases later this has become the staple of my household."
"I was recently in Montana for a friends wedding and I was able to have this beer on tap on several occasions. It pours like a cola with a foamy head. Flavors vary from a small amount of bitterness to roasty and sweet. This is one of my favorite brown ales. A well ballanced beer that doesn't over do it in any category. You are left with a satisfying after taste as well. Goes great with the cool Montana nights. Also look out for the aluminum bottles. They are pretty cool looking."
"Other comments: Plays off like a ""light"" Porter. Nice roast flavor and aroma. However, also a bit one-dimensional. This bottle was Purchased in Oregon. Want to know a ""secret""? The Moose Drool that is sold on the West Coast is actually brewed by Portland Brewing Company. When I was on a brewery tour there, the guide pointed to the palate filled with Moose Drool boxes and mentioned in hushed tones that beer was brewed there."
"The aroma is evidently coffee (black). The taste is also coffee-like and malty with a very slight hop flavor. This is a very good brown ale. Liked it a great deal."
"Taste is a roasted nutty malt. Kind of caramally and burnt. A lingering bitterness in the back of the tongue. Mouthfeel is above average. Beer gets better as it warmes but the overall impression is a little wattery for my taste."
"Drinkability: A very decent brown ale for all year long and, seems to appeal to me more now in the summer."
"Moose Drool, only a Montana based brewing company can come up with such a name. I can only say if Moose drool was this good I would have a tub under a moose out back. Glass is a dark colored brown with a creamy head the spreads up through the glass. Smell is of malts and hop flavor, some maple syrup tone with accidic tones. Taste is dark and rich, creamy, almost like drinking a maple syrup beer, full bodied goodness that feels good in the mouth with every gulp, very drinkable."
"An old favorite from back when I was just learning about good beer in Bozeman. Pours a root beer brown with a small light tan head. Smells of sweet, nutty, grapenut malts, with minimal hop presence. Taste is lightly sweet, with roasted nuts, molasses, and hay/oats (think horse food). Yeah, and I liked it. Finish is lightly bitter with lingering sweetness. Doesn't taste at all like moose urine, scat, or drool."
"Bold flavor with malty aftertaste. It was a smooth pull with very little head. Burnt brown in color. It has a strong hops and malt flavor that lingers on the tongue. For its name, I was expecting a much stronger taste, almost close to repulsive. Glad I was wrong because I was pleasantly surprised when it was palatable."
"The beer pours a dark brown color with a thick tan head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice ""brown"" scent that seems to be acheived through the use of roasted and crystal malts. The taste is decent. It has a musty flavor that is surrounded by nutty, brown notes. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a decent brown ale, but it has a few downfalls. I could really do without the musty aftertaste."
"Drinkability: Quite drinkable. Great name, somewhat forgettable taste."
"Fair enough, I guess."
"Appearance: Pours a chestnut ruby brown with a nice cream colored head big bubbly head that is, leaves behind some scattered lacing. Aroma: Herbal hop profile and chocolate along with some toasted malt characteristics, very mild scent to it. Taste: Toasted malts send some mild coffee tones but there is more of a chocolate flavor with some grassy herbal notes, not really flowing together for me. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied ale with a decent flow of carbonation, nothing to impressive here. Drinkability: I could go without seeing this one again, however it's not horrible I am just not into unhoppy brown ales they don't do anything for me, and this is one of the more mediocre versions I've tried."
"Clear, dark red hue, strong brown color in the middle, the beige head was served at a half finger in height, very foamy. The retention was wonderful! But it did not lace at all. Is the bars method of cleaning the glasses to blame? It is a pleasant beer to look at nevertheless. The aromas are solid in potency, sweet maltiness upfront with a wall of hops to finish the nose, ends clean. Inviting enough, more explanatory than welcoming. The palate displays more depth, chocolate and roasted malts upfront, idle sweetness in the middle that fades quickly and a slight hops bitterness moves in but the stay is brief as well because roasty chocolate malts end the taste nicely. The afterglow is very long and pleasant with maltiness dominating. This is a well-made brown ale, a catchy name doesnt help sales either! Medium in body with perfect caressing carbonation, the mouthfeel is ordinary but admirable. This is a highly drinkable beer. Perfect to session with, low enough abv, a nice match with steak or stew. Well worth a quaff particularly if you enjoy a non-hoppy brown ale... like I do."
"A nice beer with plenty of flavors that wash over the palate. The high carbonation helps the essence spring to life, just slightly though. A slightly above average beer, with high drinkability. A beer good enough to have a few of as you enjoy the company of your friends."
"Drinkability  I enjoyed this sweetened interpretation of the style, and the hop compliment was just enough to balance things out. Well done!"
"Pours a dark brown with a sticky,fluffy caramel head that kept very well. Nice, deep aroma of nuts, malts and hops. Taste of more nuts present with a malty middle and slighlty hoppy finish. Nice balance throughout. Drinkability is along the line of most brown ales, but a bit more texture and complexity than some of the larger brands."
"This beer can fall in the ""all purpose"" category. From pizza to steaks, to roasted chicken to perhaps even a hearty pasta dish, this beer will withstand and compliment a plethora of flavors."
"The head is a decent size, doughy, tan. Nice looking beer: dark brown with red highlights. Some thin sheets of lacing. Sweet, dark chocolate caramel in the nose, with an underlying layer of milk-gone-bad sweet. A bit of fruit joins the chocolate in the front, with a tangy, sourish middle. The finish is bitter, with some chocolate and slight grain. There's a cheesy, not very pleasant aftertaste. This is a strange brew. It's bitter, but not quite a good bitter. It's not awful, and the strange bitterness tames as it warms, allowing some cream to show through. It's actually reminiscent of Great Grains (without the patented GG infection)."
"I found a two cases of this in Medford Oregon and took it home with me! Happy days!"
"Brown Color, medium head. Aroma is malty. Medium bodied brown ale. Malts are nutty and slightly sweet. Hops are slightly bitter. A light, smooth, and mild flavored brown ale. Nice smooth malt flavor. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is malty, slightly bitter."
"Pours a dark mahogany color with a thick and creamy light tan head that sticks all over the sides of the glass. Nose is dominated by chocolaty malts with some faint underlying notes of raw grassy hops. Moderate in body and very smooth in texture. Taste is fresh cocoa and bitter-sweet dark chocolate followed by some dry hops that help to balance out the beer. A pretty nice brown ale with an, um, unusual name. Thanks to my friend (and hopefully future BA) Sasquatch for the sample!"
"Overall, this is a solid brown ale. I'm not much of a brown ale fan, but this is one I enjoyed."
"Overall a slightly better than average beer."
"Maybe Im just not a Moose Drool guy..maybe brown ales are not my ""stuff"" oh well"
"Flavor of this deeply brown and haxy beer is of long chewy caramel strings leading into a finish that is heavily dried out by a intense mineral character to the water accentuating the hop bitterness and a salty flavor like movie popcorn."
"Bullwinkle in a bottle... Originally sampled on several occassions while vacationing in Montana. This is a very nice brown ale. Not as good in bottles. I'll rate the tap version: great chocolatey, malty taste. I could definitely have a couple of these. If you're in Montana, have some."
"Fruity aroma lies on top of a sweet, nutty maltiness. Raisiny and an almost unmistakable smoke aroma came through from time to time but were fleeting. Poured a clear mahogany with a very persistent light tan head that left some nice lace. Sweet malty nuttiness hits the front of the tongue and gives way to fruity and a dry roastedness in the back of the mouth. Had a medium-light body with a slickness to the palate. Beer was quite complex and the malt and hop profiles were kept in a nice balance. A very enjoyable brown."
"Pours a nice brown color, initial aroma of caramel and a bit nutty. This is followed with a wonderful roasted caramel taste and just a slight chocolate aftertaste. Seems to be one-dimensional, not too complex as some of the bigger brown ales, but this is an underrated brown ale, an awesome brew, very smooth and creamy, enjoyable!!!"
"Good color of brown with brick red highlights, head was standing awhile sort of thick. Nice roasted malt aroma with some dried grainyness. Taste is good, balance of hops and roasted malt flavors but a little to tangy and leaves a hint of cocoa. Felt of medium body but something was missing from this brown. I expect a good smooth feel to a brown with nut like flavors, but this had to much hop and tang for this style. Thats just me I guess. Finishes dry with a hop bite and some wood flavors like a toothpick. Its drinkable, sure, but I've had better, but if offered a Moose Drool... I wouldn't turn it down. Slightly above average."
"Notes: A nice solid brown ale, very non-obtrusive just easy to drink. Went well with the mild cheddar I had with it."
"Excellent on draft, though this review was based upon a bottle..."
"clear dark ruby in color. huge foamy head which leaves a good deal of lace. active carbonation. hardly any malt aroma in the nose, but definite earthy and grassy hops are detectable. choco, caramel and burnt toffee malts are quick to assert themselves in the taste. a medium to light mouthfeel, with an effervescent mouthfeel that gets in the way of the full malt flavors. i prefer my browns to be fuller and malt driven, and moose drool comes close. finishes with another mouthfull of malt flavors and another earthy hop kick. a slightly above average brown...tastes good but not great."
"the first time I tried this I was on vacation in West Yellowstone 1999. I had finished snowmobiling about 300mi and ready to start the evening with my wife dining out. We tried a number of different local beers before I was ""introduced"" to Moose Drool. It was love at first sight/smell/taste. I don't know if I have had a better Brown Ale since. The appearance was of a warm maple syrup coming out of the tap. The smell consisted of fresh cracked walnuts and toasted coconut. I would liken the drinkability to sitting down at home to a good movie with say, a bag of doritos. Half way through the movie you look down and all the chips are gone, you pause the movie and search for more. This goes hand in hand with mouthfeel. I don't particularly like hops showing up at the end of a smooth consistent beer. Nailing my olfactory senses in the face is inconsistant with the overall story would humiliate the beer. This beer doesn't dissapoint. The conversion of these storylines ends in a happy ending. This was among the last beers I enjoyed that night. I thought my taste buds were swayed by the previous enjoyment of the evenings beers. I confirmed my enthusiam and review of this beer the next two nights just to make sure my assesments were correct. They were. I do have to say that 400 mi and packaging does indeed make a difference. We recieved a shipment of MooseDrool, Slow Elk and Powder Hound (all from the same brewery) at our local beeraceutical store. The anticipation of having this brew in town was tainted with high expectations and low returns. This beer bottled and shipped to our location registers a meager 2-2.5 rating for this reviewer."
"First of all, you got to love a beer called Moose Drool, well thats if your weird like me at any rate. Translucent ruby red color on the pour with an impressive head and delicate sheets of lace to Drool down the glass! The nose is nutty sweet malt, also clean and fresh, sweet at the start and the top middling in mouth feel. Finish is perkily acidic, the hops a tad to light for me with the aftertaste dry and lingering, but pleasant to quaff nonetheless."
"I have been waiting to get my hands on this beer for awhile, just because of the wacky name. The fact that the beer was pretty good was just icing on the cake. Pours a dark brown color with a medium thin beige head. Aroma of nuts and light caramel. Flavor was smooth and malty with a nutty finish. Although a little uneven compared to the Sierra Blanca Nut Brown I had before it, this is still a decent beer."
"Great beer for winter sipping, or with pizza. One of the better brown ales in the region. Filling though. (the beer that eats like a meal) Try the other beers from Bik Sky Brewing. Fun name and label to give to visitors to Montana, I get comments on it years later."
"rich and bitter kind of malty.It had an afftertaste that was like ""MOOSE DROOL"""
"Moose Drool pours to a medium-brown color, with a light brown head that lasts.  There is a roasty, malty aroma emanating from this beer.  The flavor is one of roasted-nuttiness, with hints of chocolate.  The hop flavor is detectable, but takes the back seat to the roasted malt flavors.  Overall it is a tasty brown ale with a pleasant roasty nose and flavor."
"Light brown in color w/ excellent clarity.  The thick initial head settles into a dense and tight layer that leaves lace.  The aroma is comprised mostly of caramel malt sweetness, w/ just a hint of chocolate malt.  A damp flower - like Kent Goldings nose is there as well.  It's a bit thin in malt body and complexity. The malt profile consists of lightly toasted malts, generic caramel malt sweetness, and subtle roasted notes.  The hop bitterness is a touch shy of balancing malt sweetness, and leaves this brew a bit sweet overall.  There aren't any surprises in the sweet and lightly roasted finish.  Moose Drool is a decent brown, but is a bit too sweet for my tastes.  More malt backbone would've been appreciated."
"I found this an interesting beer to try in part because someone is promoting it significantly ( I can find it at virtually any beer store I frequent regularly).  Anyway, light and pleasant malt aroma, with a slight hop background that strengthens the longer it sits.  Looks like a brown in color and big full head that lingers nicely.  Not a strong flavor but the hops are evident in taste and the dry finish.  Malt noted in sweetness and slight richness.  Medium to thin mouthfeel with moderate carbonation.  Not a bad example of style, just not a favorite style for me.  Certainly better than the name suggests."
"It's brown and it's an ale.  Not much else to say about it.  Had a slight chocolate/roasted malt flavor but I don't know where those hops are that everyone is talking about.  Served its purpose in making me really appreciate the Hopdevil I was about to drink."
"It's got the typical brown color with a good head with staying power.  Hops are noticeable and pleasant.  As others note, it is a bit thin for a brown ale but it has a pretty good flavor with hints of chocolate and roasted flavors.  All in all, it's not a bad effort."
"Dark reddish-brown color (what else??). Faint head, medium carbonation.  Some maltiness, but hops are apparent, especially in the finish."
"This beer pours clear dark ruby.  Little head.  Some very slight chocolate and roasted tones on the nose.  Nice subdued chocolate and roast tones on the palate as well.  Good maltiness.   Medium to full body.  Good tasting easy drinking brown.  (Although I do prefer a little more hoppiness and bitterness in a brown.)"
"This is a great brown ale.  Too many browns these days overdo the malts and do not let the hops shine through.  Moos Drool is nice and dry with a crisp light bitterness.  Very like Offshore's brown ale.  One of the best."
"I'm not a huge fan of the Browns as a general rule though my first taste of Drool on tap during a trip to Bozeman impressed me with a friendly smoothness...typical sweet hearty malts but not a bad amount of clean hop imprint for the style and a clear winner over Pete's Wicked to me..."
"The much fabeled ""Moose Drool""..a beer I had heard a lot about...I'm not a big fan of Brown Ales (Not a lot of flavor) but was excited to give it a shot.  On me first tasting I came away unimpressed.  I have just given it a second tasting after playing two hours of hockey...It tastes much better...there are some definite chocolate notes to this easy drinking brown ale...It has some character to it, and is considerably better than the Pete's Wicked Red Rush I just tasted.  This is not a bad beer at all...I wouldn't seek it out but if I was at a restraunt and they offered this as a beer on tap I would jump at the chance to try it...Above average but far from outstanding..for a Brown Ale its above average and very solid.."
