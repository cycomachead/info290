"Overall: Excellent.  Very quaffable.  Will be buying again (If I can get my hands on it here).  Very easy drinking; among the best American brown's I've had."

"This is a very classic american ale with flavor, body, and taste. I really like this in the winter because of its darker flavor components, but it is still smooth and light enough to have a couple. The flavor is really well balanced and nothing is overpowering in this beer."
""
""
"This beer has a hearty malt flavor and exactly as the label states BROWN. A medium brown color. There is a hint of chocolate flavor with minimal presence of hops. a hint of light roast coffee and a mild bitterness in aroma. not one of my favorite beers but also not the worst."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a fantastic brown ale. Smooth malty goodness."

"O- Very good example of a brown ale. Well suited for a late fall bon fire. One of my favorite Shorts brews."

"The way that some people talk about Short's Brewing you'd think that getting your hands on a bottle would warrant running through the street naked in celebration. But in my experience their beers aren't *that* good (and the readily available stuff is rather pedestrian). Nonetheless, all the ones I've tried have been well-made and true to style - and worth buying."
""
""
""
"The body is on the lighter side of medium, and the prickle of the crispness on the tongue prevents it from being as smooth as it could be. Otherwise, there's pretty good depth in the feel."
""
""
"I feel this brown flirts as the beginning of a good porter. A splendid brown to say the least."
""
""
"Beer was drank out of a Samuel Adams perfect pint glass. Cloudy appearance but the beer tastes great. If you like brown's please don't hesitate to try. Has a coffee like undertone but Definitely not to strong. I like beers that finish light this time of year and this beer delivers. Could also be enjoyed as a cold weather favorite."

"O: While this is dramatically different from my favorite browns (DFH Indian Brown and Smutty Old Brown Dog) which tend toward the hoppy side, I really, really like this beer. It has a unique flavor profile that suggest bourbon barrel aging to me. I know it wasn't (if it was, I'm sure they'd pump that up) but I do wonder if they threw in some barrel chips, or otherwise infused some bourbon flavoring. That would explain the slight sourness and the whiff of boozy brown liquor I caught in the aroma. Just a theory. In any event, I highly recommend this brew."

"o: A brown ale quite suitable for warmer weather due to its light qualities, yet with a solid flavor. Enjoyable to the last sip. Wish now I had bought more than one. Would even be nice as a light breakfast stout in summer actually drunk at breakfast or brunch time if one were so inclined."

"Overall one of my favorite brown ales."
"overall: A highly drinkable brown ale, probably in my top 3 for the style. I could drink this all day."
""
""
""
"Overall, the most enjoyable thing about this brew was its flavoring. The look started things off nicely, giving good color and a nice head. The aroma is where we lost points, as it lacked general robustness and let the malts fall too far to the back in their inherent aromatic contributions. To contrast, the taste showed every side of the grain, with bitterness, bready sweetness, caramels, roast, and earthiness, giving a little something different at each turn, and with each sip. The drying roast on the feel was the icing on the cake, helping to keep that nice flavoring flowing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Excellent Brown!"
""
"Overall: A very enjoyable beer that I'll definitely have again. (Curious to see if the sourness in the aroma is characteristic of this beer.)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Meh - not brilliant, although the aroma gives the impression that it could have been. There are some nice malty hints that suggest a decent brown ale lurks underneath the acidic off-notes. Not sure what happened here; the sourness is quite clean, almost like yoghurt. Bacteria perhaps? Or maybe it's just age - without a BB/bottled-on date it's impossible to tell. Oh well, I review it as I find it (though I'll re-review if I get a fresh one someday). Disappointing."

"Taste: Awesome beer. The taste has a wallop of malts, but also consists of chocolate and coffee notes in there as well. The finish has a dash of spice and a tiny bit of bitterness, but it's just about perfectly balanced against the sweetness. The feel may be the beer's highlight -- very smooth but not too thick or cloying, and satisfying. This may just be my favorite ""drink anytime"" Fall seasonal, and my favorite ""normal"" beer from Short's overall."

"O: A good brown ale, but nothing that really blew me away. Enjoyable overall."
""
""
"Malt heavy flavor. Toffee on the nose but once it's in the mouth the flavor becomes less refined - a more lightly burnt caramel swallow. While mentioning those flavors, however, the beer is arguably more drinkable and a bit more clean than the standard brown. The sweetness, which is prominent, is not overpowering. And while my personal taste favors a stronger hop presence (especially in the finish), this beer is a favorable version of a malt heavy brew. Overall, and particularly if you're a fan of browns, try this beer! (As always, Life is Short's.)"
""
""
""
""
""
"All these beers I've had by Shorts keep advertising all the wide variety of ingredients they are putting in each beer. The label on this one reads: ""A classic American brown ale."" There's nothing wrong with sticking to the traditional, but there's nothing wrong with making it better through your skill and know how."
""
""
""
"O - A solid, easy drinking brown. If you are in the distribution area, I recommend grabbing a six pack for a full flavored session beer."
""
""
""
""
"Medium in body but watered down. Not much carbonation which leads me to think that this beer is past its prime. Oh well, that's why breweries need to put some dating info on the bottle. So it goes."
"o - one track mind brown ale. doesn't mess around. really tasty."
""
"D/O: This ale is a mediocre effort from a brewery that is known for putting quirky and unique twists on traditional beer styles. Although the texture is unconvincing in general, it is the early acidity that holds this beer back from being a better example of its style."
""
"Not the most exciting of styles, but this was an above average brown ale for sure. A great nuttiness and toffee taste, medium bodied, with nice dark brown color.. this been finished clean and smooth and was more tasty than most for the pretty generic style. Won't knock your pants off, but definitely worthy of a try."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall this is an excellent, local brown ale that is not too pricey and is easy going and is great for fall drinking."
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"355ml bottle. Tumbler glass. From my notes (mar´11). Light reddish brown color. Close & lasting crown. Light aroma profile: toasted malts & herbal hop touch. Sweet upfront. Medium body, watery texture. Quite flat & boring. Smooth bitter finish. Unexpected from Short´s."
""
""
""
""
"D- very hearty brew that begs for burgers and other grilled food. Good drinkability."
""
""
""
"Poured into a pint glass, the ale was dark with a a certain degree of cloudiness in the brown coloring. It had only a slight head that disappeared quickly. In the aroma, the ale was tart and perhaps even vinegary. It was not the most enticing aroma. The first sip was a dry chocolatey taste with notes of prune and a delightful hint of chocolate covered cherries. The tartness largely overshadows the sweet notes which is appropriate for the style. In the big picture, it combines to demonstrate elements of a sour ale. The aftertaste was dry, which continued the initial impression. The ale left a nice dark chocolate coating on the tonuge, allowed to linger by the modest level of carbonation. This is a very drinkable beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A deep, rich mahogany that falls just short of opaque, the beer has little scent, but what there is smells a bit nutty. There’s plenty of flavor though, with the nuttyness being the least of it. Surprisingly sweet for a brown, it tastes almost like a lightly sweetened mocha latte. Not bad."
""
""
""
""
"Overall I quite like this. Brown ales are typically one of the more plain styles, and while this one didn't venture out and do anything crazy to the style, it nearly nailed all the texbook characteristics of a classic American brown ale."
"Aroma is more subtle than I'd choose, with only a hint of the roasted chocolate malts that are so well presented in the taste. Caramelized malts and nuttiness are well balanced, with a delightfully spicy and lingering finish."
""
""
"M- Medium bodied, creamy with good carbonation."
"O= Overall a average beer there wasn't a lot going on in it. I just basically had it in a mixed six pack so it was worth a try not something I would seek out."
"O - This is solid as a beer comes. One of Shorts' best selections (among many) and I will keep this in my regular year round repertoire. A classic American Brown."
""
""
"Overall, decent brown but nothing out of the ordinary"
""
"DRINKABILITY: Easy to drink and repeatable, this is a nice brown ale, well suited to Michigan's cooler temperatures. It's a good session beer with an agreeable price to value ratio. It has an interesting malt-hops balance, though it seemed a little more bitter than I thought it would. It would make a nice beer for sitting around and watching a football game with friends -- always a good thing."
"O: Light bodied, too highly carbonated, lacking complexity. Not something I will seek out again."
""
""
"Cocoa flavor with a touch of sweetness. The body is relatively thin with an above average carbonation. There's a brief sourness in the swallow. The aftertaste is brief."
""
""
"Overall not a bad brown ale at all! I got very mild flavors and hops so I assume my bottle might have been over a month old but it was still very tasty and drinkable being malt forward. Tasty stuff guys!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O – A different brown that I’m not fond enough of to seek out again, an above average beer I probably won’t have again 3.5"
"12 oz bottle to pint glass. The beer pours a translucent deep brown color with a nice 2 finger light head with good retention and lacing. The nose is very nice with a mix of mildly bittern chocolate, roasted malt, chocolate, earthy hop character. Nice. The flavor starts off with a toasty cereal malt flavor mixed with chocolate. Very creamy. The earthy hops provide a mild bitterness and complement the malts very well. Finishes smooth and dry, very easy drinking. Lighter bodied with good carbonation. Overall, this is one of the better browns I've had, very easy drinking and creamy and delicious! Recommended"

"D - Very drinkable. Nice rich and sweet malt profile that avoids becoming cloying. The molasses flavor and feeling linger for quite a bit afterwards."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, too sweet and thin. An OK brown."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall a very drinkable beer and would have it again."
"Overall: a fair brown ale, perhaps a bit weak on taste and mouthfeel, but decent enough to drink again."
""
""
"D - I'd certainly have this one again. Complex, nice flavors, and it's drinkable to boot."
""
"Overall: It's probably a little old (dated 1/17/11) Not something I would otherwise revisit."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I think I am 2 for 15 with Short's bottles due to refermentation issues. There are no such issues here, but this beer really does not do much to impress me either."
"12 ounce bottle, bottled 10/04/11. Pours crystal clear reddish brown color with a nice fairly dense 2 finger light khaki head with good retention that reduces to a fairly thick lacing cap. Some bits of lacing cling to the side of the glass as well. Aromas of caramel, toasted malts, bread, brown sugar, nuttiness, and a good amount of spicy hops. Fairly nice aromas with good strength. Taste of caramel, toasted malt, light chocolate, bread, nuttiness, light coffee, and spices. Decent amount of bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, caramel, and spicy hops on the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy mouthfeel that drinks smoothly. No alcohol noticed at all. Nice balance of flavors and bitterness. Overall a very nice and tasty brown ale that is a good representation of the style."
""
""
""
"o - not really sure how i feel about this one. easily drinkable, but with an odd flavor profile. certainly extends the range of the style."
""
"The beer tastes fresh enough, so I don't think it's an old batch. I might try another of their beers in a mixed six pack, but this beer doesn't make me want to run out and get more."
""
"a pretty good standard brown ale. pours a cocoa colored semi-tranparent with a one inch cream colored head. smells a bit like a cup of coffee, with some good roasted characteristics and a sturdy malt vibe. tastes a little nutty, almonds? mouthfeel is well carbonated and right on medium. nothing makes this beer stand out to me, but it is well balanced and drinkable. will look into some more shorts brews"

"O - It's a solid brown ale."
"Bellaire Brown is probably the most simple, straight forward beer I’ve had from Short’s Brewing Company. That’s not a bad thing. It actually works pretty well. For a Brown Ale, it isn’t quite as malty as you might think. It actually features a nice interplay of malt and earthy hops. I like it. It would benefit from a little more body and perhaps a stronger nose. Good stuff though. Recommended."
"Overall-I am pretty disappointed. I have had a couple of other Short's beers and loved them. Brown ales aren't my favorite style, but I do enjoy them, and this isn't a great example. Not sure if the sourness is intentional or not. If so I will give them credit for trying something different, but it doesn't float my boat."
"O: Trying to review by style even though I am definitely not a fan of the style. This is one of the better browns I've had but not one that will make me purchase again."
"O: Short's Bellaire Brown is, literally, one funky brew. Either they're intentionally brewing one off-the-wall brown ale, or this is slightly infected. Either way, this wasn't my cup of tea, and was quite happy to have shared the rest of these with unknowing friends."
"12oz bottle from a mixed sixer. Dark brown color, good head. Smells like a malty brown, nice. The flavor is like an English brown ale and even has this odd touch of vinegar that I always detect in good English style brown ales, maybe its just me? Overall, I liked it and felt like it was true to style but what do I know?"
"Overall a really nice brown ale. This is a style that is perfect for the season and really doesn't get enough attention from American brewers. Nicely done Short's."
"I think this would be a good beer for a non-beer lover to try. It does have a bit of hops, but the interesting sweet and malty flavor of chestnuts might be appealing. Not my favorite style, but I have to give Short's credit for juicing up the flavor."
"Overall: A good beer all around."
"D - pretty solid brown ale. More sweet and cookie-ish than other examples I have had of this style, but it worked well. I could see myself having multiples at a bar if it were available."
"Notes: Quite the tasty American brown ale one of the more unique ones. Cheers."
"Very easy to drink and perfect for the cooler temps that Michigan offers. This is a great American Brown ale and one of the better ones I've found out there. Delicious."
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a decent beer to drink for a while but there are other in the style that I would pick first."
"O: Short's just needs to get their act together."
"O: All in all, this beer kind of blows. This one is ok, but nothing worth buying again. Don't bother with this brew. Not a good representation of the style and not a good beer. Rethink this one Shorts."
"O--This was an ok representation of the style, but it wasn't my favorite. It felt a little too watery in the mouth for me. I think I would have preferred a more balanced, and fuller beer."
"O: Overall the lingering taste is good and prolonged, the body is great for style. This is a solid Shorts offering, with a great hit at a classic style, not going over the top with the unique additions."
"On the lighter end of medium bodied with a decent balancenof sweet and roasted malts. Toasty with hints of caramel, hazelnut and toffee complimented by some zesty spice notes, especially cinnamon and brown sugar. The hops provide a nice dry, bitterness that balances out the sweeter notes and linger into a dry finish. Nothing out of the ordinary but pretty quaffable."
"O: good"
"Overall, this was a decent beer. I would drink it again, but it just blends in with a lot of the other browns I've had. Nothing overly special about it."
"A decent beer that's good but nothing, other than the sourness, really stands out about it."
"Overall pretty good for the style, but strangely not drawn to it compared to other makers of this style. Can drink no problem no complaints."
"For one of the few times in reviewing brew, I find the mouthfeel really detracts from the overall enjoyment of this beer. Very unique version of the style -- glad I found a bottle and was able to experience this."
"Taste starts with biscuity maltiness, tannins and some fruit in the middle, with a lightly biting hoppy close. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth, and drinkability is alright as well. Not all I was hoping, but not a bad brew."
"Overall, a plain example of a brown, which I find a bit surprising coming from Short's."
"Overall a great brown. Don't drink browns too much but if I had access to this I would buy it often."
"Beer is medium in body with a mild flavor of sweetness up front, some ashy bitterness at the back and some plain mild tobacco in the middle. It is decent but not great. I'd have it again if I were in the mood for a brown."
"Decent sessioner, brown ales always work as the base of a marinade..that the best I can say about this one..."
"I wasn't impressed by the smell, but the taste was actually very nice. Could easily have a couple of these"
"O - One of the most unique brews I've ever had. I would love to have this brew around all the time! I wonder what would happen with age...?? Brew is off style, but great nevertheless. A great brew in a great trade."
"Overall: pretty good beer, not over priced. Pretty cool bottle and cap. It wont blow you away, but its worth a try."
"Overall: A solid sessionable brown ale. Nothing too over the top, but one to sit with. I would pick this up again, but there are several other Short's beers I would grab ahead of this one."
"O: Great example of a Brown Ale, one of the better I have had recently. If I got more of this as extras I wouldn’t be upset. And if they had this at my local shop I would have this on had for guest that usually drink Newcastle."
"7.1/10"
"If brown ales were little children in a swimming pool, this one would bob at the comfy, safe shallow end, afraid to move for fear of... of... I don't have any idea. It just seemed like a good metaphor for this beer. It's nice and safe, not too bitter, not too sweet, not too smelly, not too tasty, not too much of anything; yet it still manages to be pleasant to drink. It has the round non-grapefruity citrus zing of a good UK ale, which I find appealing, but it doesn't have much else. Brown ales need not be as dense as a stout or a porter, but they ought to have more umph than this."
"Thanks duffextracold. A good beer to wash down a long mountain bike ride."
"Thanks to funkyaudio for the extra. Poured from 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Pours clear deep mahogany that wears the thinnest head. That brown ale remains rather subtle on the nose, deploying its creamy nuttiness and soft roast whispers over a caramel and thinned out molasses foundation. Warming up, it opens up a bit and develops a mineral fruitiness possibly from its hops, but while slightly flowery, those feel quite tired and tamed down. The beer did taste a little syrupy. Definitely picking up roasted malts, caramel, and brown sugar throughout. Medium bodied and light carbonation which was a little disappointing. Yet, this was one of the better brown ales I've had!"
"Mini hop snap on the finish. Glad I only picked up a single of this beer and not a 6 pack."
"O- I am not a huge brown ale fan, though this is the one I normally grab when I am in the mood. Has plenty of tasty qualities and if it is fresh, it is hard to beat. It is nice on a cold day or after a coffee."
"O: A Short's beer that wasn't that sour. Hooray! Actually... I've grown to dig some of their sour weirdness. However, this one was played straight down the middle, and I appreciate it for that..."
"This pours a dark mahogany with a two finger cream head that leaves traces of lace. On the nose there are roasted and chocolate malts, toffee sweetness, and maybe just a pleasing little bit of husky grain. In the mouth there stand slightly sweet caramel and toffee notes, with the roasted malt fading a bit further in the mix. I'm not getting much in the way of bitterness anywhere here, which combines with a medium thin body to provide very little in the way of a finish. For me, that's really the only knock on this beer. This is something that people who don't know they like beer might like, but has plenty going on for people who do like beer. Big thanks to my sister for getting a mixed 6 with this and a bunch of other great stuff in it."
"Not a bad ale, but mediocre overall - Short's can do and has done much better..."
"Decent, but a too thin and light for me considering the style."
"The beer is more thin than medium bodied, has a sweet underneath, slightly floral, overlaid by a bittering leafy hop, some acidic notes, a touch of soury cherry. This is a Brown Ale that's barely hanging in there and is more typical of other styles. I'm not sold on this beer. It's a decent beer, but it is just not a creamy, roasted, chocolatey and nutty type Brown that I'm interested in. The acidic notes, the cherry tartness, the leafy hop just make this an odd ball for the style. It's not bad, but not what I had my mouth set for either."
"Overall, this is a very solid brown ale and one of my favorites to date. DFH Indian Brown still takes #1 for me but I would put this solidly in the 2nd tier along with Rogue John John Hazelnut and Sweetwater Sweet Georgia Brown. Highly recommended."
"o - Solid 3.5 across the board. Nice brown ale, better than average, but nothing crazy. Enjoyed the taste, but not one I'd seek out when looking for a brown ale. Kind of plain, a bit boring."
"The feel of this beer is pretty smooth with a nice medium body. There is a nice drinkable feel that goes down easy."
"O- im kind of on the fence with browns but i liked this one. good beer."
"O- A good Brown ale. I like the use of malts in this beer. Seems to drink easier than most Browns while maintaining that rich overall flavor."
"Medium bodied, higher carbonation, a bit dry on the tongue. Drinks smooth and easy, solid flavor, although nothing too unusual (especially for Shorts)."
"The CPJ"
"Drink is decent, bit of a sweet almost sticky finish, but not too bad, sessionable essentially, smooth and malty, nothing overbearing, balanced well, and I'm surprised to hear myself say this (in my head) that it could maybe even use a bit more American hops."
"Very drinkable and clean. Solid."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, it had some nice malty flavors to it and was a pretty easy drinking beer. It had more cocoa and chocolate to it than most brown ales and the fruity, tart notes seemed odd in the aroma for the style, but it was a pretty decent beer overall."
"Maybe I got a bad bottle or something, it was kinda weird tasting at first but nice when it warmed up. I am a fan of brown ales and this one, even warmer, wasn't great."
"Overall Bellaire brown is a nice, quaffable brown ale that has some good things going for it, but falls a bit short for my taste. The aroma is pretty nice, but the flavor is a bit more boring and lacks that nice nutty character that I love in brown ales. This is still a quality beer though and if you are ever at Short's pub in the city that is this beer takes its name from, you may want to have a pint."
"The beer starts off fine, pouring a moderate brown color with a pretty good off-white head with a bit of lacing. The nose is slightly sweet with some dark fruits along with a bit of an acetic character in the background. The taste is just downright awful. This is essentially vinegar at this point and really disgusting. Not much else to say about it. The mouthfeel is puckering and sour, burning my throat. Drain pour to the max."
"I enjoyed this beer for its smooth, crisp, and flavorful qualities, and high drinkability. For an american brown ale, this beer has some unique elements to it. Further, this one seems like a worthy candidate for a session beer. I will buy this again. That's the long and Short's of it all :)"
"Pass."
"M/D. A nice smooth feeling beer that is on the thin and watery side. Another reviewer said that is to be expected from Short's Beer and I will agree that most are thin and watery, but that also makes it a nice drinkable and enjoyable brown ale. If I did not get the quote or remark from the other reviewer exactly than sorry about that, until next time enjoy your favorite Short's Beer."
"This quickly became my brown ale of choice. I could, and have, drank this all night."
"Very easy to drink with no trace of alcohol. Just a pleasant but nothing special brown ale."
"D:Pretty easy going and interesting drink all around. A roasty and nutty taste dominates this brew, they say this is a classic american brown ale but I think its the next step up to what brown ales are going in the craft scene"
"ive never been able to drink alot of any brown ale due to the sweetness of most, but this i could probably make an exception for. not bad."
"Drinkability: A pretty decent brown ale, though I don't care for the nutskin bitterness in the aftertaste"
"Reviewed on 6/29/2010. On tap at Shorts. Pours a dark brown with a small white head. Aroma of super sweet malt and raisins. Flavor of very sweet malt, almost juice-like due to the sweetness, with a thin palate. It was a pretty disappointing brown ale."
"D: Yes. This is quite enjoyable. Nicely made, simple and tasty."
"Went perfect with the 5 course Italian dinner I had it with, and as it warmed it just got sweeter and better, something that is a little different then a traditional brown but is a winner in my book."
"Overall this is a pretty well done brew, different then most browns, but shorts is a different kind of brewery so i never expect the norm from them. There is for sure room in my fridge for this beer."
"Bellaire Brown has an oily mouthfeel. I'm not a big fan of brown ales but this a better one. Would be great in late October or winter time."
"Pours a light translucent brown color with a small 1-finger light tan head that left little to no lacing on the edge of the glass. Smells slightly nutty with notes of caramel sweetness and some citrus. the taste is that of roasted malts, some sour notes, sweetness, citrus, and a little hint of chocolate at the finish. There was no hop flavor which seems odd to me since the last brown ale I had from Shorts was quite hoppy. the mouthfeel is pretty good. This beer goes down pretty smooth, and is pretty creamy. It's body is on the lighter side, and it has nice carbonation. I would say that this is a pretty drinkable beer. There's not much that really stands out in this beer, but I still think it's nice."
"D: Overall a bit scattered in all areas. This leaves me wondering where this one was when it was fresh. Still drinkable."
"Drinkability: Interesting taste of peanut butter here, but all in all, nothing special. Won't revisit again, based not only on its overall mediocrity but also its lack of availability."
"Big thanks to enelson for including this as an extra in a trade awhile back! Served from bottle into a Stone nonic. Poured dark reddish brown with a two finger off-white to tan head that subsided to one finger slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of roasted malt, sweet malt, chocolate, and nutmeg. The flavor was of slightly roasted malt, chocolate, and caramel. It had a light feel on the palate with low carbonation. Overall this was a very nice and smooth borwn ale for sure. Had a very nice flavor with a decent aroma. The aroma could have used a little work though in my opinion to make it stand out as more of a brown ale. However, this is a must try for any brown ale fan out there."
"Flavor mirrors the aroma closely, but adds a medicinal/shoe polish note to the finish reminiscent of a good English ale. Hops are again veggie-like, and the malts are where they should be with toasted chocolate and caramel. Solid mouthfeel to the medium body: slick, creamy and nicely carbonated with a hop bite on the dry finish. Overall, I found Bellaire to be a play-it-safe Brown Ale that still manages to get the job done. Worth seeking out at least once."
"D: Very high. I'd order a second and definitely buy six. A good go-to winter beer."
"Thanks Nate!"
"All in all, not my favorite brown ale. Decent and fairly drinkable, not near as good as the SN Tumbler or other brown ales out there, and definitely not one of Short's best offerings. Doubt I would purchase again, but wouldn't have a problem drinking this either. Fairly average."
"very drinkable at 5.2abv"
"Overall this one smelled like it would be amazing with a very nice balance of malt and hops but the flavor profile didn't quite pull through. Still, it's a very nice beer that's worth a shot."
"D: A nice lower-alcohol brew with enough brown ale flavors to keep me content."
"Bottle. Pours a cola like brown with a slight tan head. Nice collar. LIght roast coffee and malt flavor in the nose. The taste is light roast coffee, vanilla, and some nuttiness. Medium mouthfeel. Pretty sweet up front with some mild bitterness for the roast and hops in the end. Decent brown."
"Nabbed one o' these out o' my buddy's fridge during our Fantasy Football draft. It pours a mostly clear ruby brown topped by a finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises cocoa, toffee, caramel, light coriander, and some seemingly random miscellaneous florals. The taste is pretty similar, with notes of cocoa powder, toffee, brown sugar, sugar-free maple syrup, and a more decisive orange zest, leaning toward Mandarin-style (light syrup, of course). The body is a heavy light, with a light moderate carbonation and a smooth feel. Overall, a very nice brown, indeed. Gimme more, honey!"
"D_Very drinkable. Very enjoyable."
"Decent enough chestnut brown color. Nutty and caramel like aroma. Flavor is just like the aroma-very nutty with a definate caramel flavor to it. Nice solid malty flavor. Decent hop bite in the end. Good mouthfeel-very smooth. An enjoyable beer all around, maybe a hair away from being really ""good""."
"Medium brown color that is slightly translucent. Two fingers of head that had good retention before settling to a thin cap. Just a little lacing is left on the glass. Good aroma of chocolate, nuts, and caramel. There is a little acidity lingering in the background but it is barely percepatable. The flavor follows the aroma but does not pack the same power. It is nutty with some caramel. The chocolate seems to have disappeared. Again there is a little acidity. Bitterness is very low and hops are not detectable. This could be an English Brown with what I can taste. The body feels a little thin but carbonation keeps things positive. Very easy to drink and I guess that was the Brewer's objective. I would like a little more flavor and body but otherwise a good brown."
"Drinkability -- Rich and roasty with good balance and phenomenal mouthfeel. This may give Flossmoor's Pullman Brown a run for my favorite brown ale. In any case, this is a brown ale that cannot be missed."
"Notes: Not the best brown ale I've had but is worth trying, I'll probably drink it again, but there is nothing that separates it from the pack and makes it great."
"Overall: I did not enjoy this brew very much and i like brown ales. Sorry but i'll pass next time."
"A pretty drinkable brown ale overall. I could easily kick back a few."
"D: More lightly hopped than some American Brown Ale's I've had but wonderful toasted malt character throughout. Another impressive brew from Short's."
"goes down ok. a bit subdued all around, but without much enticing subtleties to keep me looking forward to the next sip. not great."
"Overall, not the best brown I have had. It seems to have an off flavor to it. Somewhat drinkable."
"Pours a rich, warm, dark brown with an average light tan head. Strong, malty aroma has an overtone of molasses and is somewhat sweet. Lip-smacking flavor is malty with a strong molasses component, and sweet without being cloying. Texture is smooth and lightly fizzy."
"D- easy to drink and a great example of a brown ale. something i wish i could buy more consistently in my area. shorts rarely disappoints, and this is no exception."
"D: This goes down ridiculously easy. Nice flavoring, nice kick, well balanced. This is most definitely a sessionable beer."
"This beer is sweet, but drinkable. I wouldn't put this on my top ten session beers though."
"D - I could drink this all night long (and probably will very soon). I'd recommend this to someone who loves fat tire and wants a beer with more body and a richer malt character."
"Received as an extra; my first Short's beer. Pours a nice nutty brown color, with a decent amount of off-white head. Aromas of dark fruit, chestnuts and maybe gingerbread? On the palate, this one is nice and malty, with brown sugar, cocoa powder and milk chocolate. A nice introduction to an interesting brewery."
"Average sessionability"
"D: A well thought out brown beer. Quite tasty."
"Granted, bitter dark beers are not my favorite style, but this one really let me down considering the reputation that Short's has. I'm looking forward to trying the rest of their lineup soon."
"Easy to drink with some nice roasted flavor, but the flavor is really lacking at times too. Not a bad brown ale, but nothing spectacular either."
"Nice, creamy mouthfeel and good carbonation. This goes down easy and is a very sessionable brown ale."
"D: Pretty solid beer. Really like what is going in with the sweet and toastiness of the malt bill on this beer, well balanced in the hop department but malty enough to keep from drying you out but hoppy enough to keep things from getting too slick and sloppy."
"All right as a session beer, or something to drink with a game of 8-ball (I'm stripes)."
"Ok, this is pretty good. I wish I had gotten to it sooner."
"The beer pours a medium-hazy brown with a cream-colored head. The aroma is caramel and toffee. Almost smells like an English Brown Ale. The flavor is a nice mix of nutty, caramel and toffee with some hop bitterness at the end. Thin-medium mouthfeel and low-medium carbonation."
"D - I buy this semi-regulary and it is my favorite American Brown Ale for sure, definitely easy to drink at 5.2% and I think if you can try this you should."
"D: Highly drinkable, a well-done brown ale."
"D: Pretty low - can't say that I'd try this again."
"Drinkability: I really can't get past the flavors and their unpleasantness. Like I said at the beginning of the review, I would gladly give it a shot again and edit this if it comes out better."
"Body is just shy of medium, with ample carbonation. Solid beer, and my first from Short's."
"drinkability is good. nice balance. great malty depth and complexity. the light hopping works well."
"D: This beer is very drinkable with it's nice flavor and smooth mouthfeel and finish. This is a very good representation of a brown ale. I am pleased that I decided to pick this beer up to try."
"Poured very dark caramel brown. Could not see through my glass. Slightly hazy look. Sweet malty smell...and taste. Just a little hops bitterness on the finish. Very drinkable considering its sweetness. Lack of carbonation makes it finish a little thick."
"*Note: tasting notes from 8/3/09"
"Clear medium chestnut, a bit on the reddish side, with a one inch cap of dark beige foam. Smells great. Malty and toasted with some mild chocolate and roast notes, biscuity. Not much in the way of hops, but that works here with such a rich aroma. Moderate bitterness with a distinct orange sweetness from the hops. Malt character was basically the same as the aroma and contributed significant malt sweetness in addition to the toasted, chocolate and slight roasted flavours. It finished a bit nutty with a balanced bitterness. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation, nice texture. Quite tasty and a solid brown ale."
"Overall, a nice brown, if fairly mild flavor-wise. Probably the least-impressive Short's offering I've had, which is saying something about the rest of their brews."
"Another fun find from the Ohoove cellars this one is a very dark brown brew with a fair light tan head and fair light lacing. The aroma is light evergreen malt, decent and pretty full. The taste brings mildly bitter coffee with a hint of chocolate sweetness all in a swampy bath of tingly but somewhat watery brew. I do get a touch of citrus hop that confuses into the coffee. It's plenty drinkable and a decent option for the style but a bit thin and not particularly memorable."
"Solid beer all around and something I wouldn't mind having in the fridge on a regular basis for an easy-drinker."
"A beer that is easy to drink, fulfilling in taste, and readily available. A very nice beer."
"D- Easy to drink and enjoyable. Not my favorite style but well worth it."
"Drinkability? It didn't take me long to finish the 12oz so it is rather drinkable and I guess that's what Short's intended; still, I couldn't see myself drinking more than 1 at a sitting. A little more ""grabbing"" power in the flavours would sovle that. ;^)"
"After California, Michigan is my second favorite state when it comes to craft beer. Short's may not be Bell's or Founders, but they're pretty good in their own right. Bellaire Brown's label reads 'A classic American Brown Ale'. I couldn't agree more."
"D: a great example of the brown. Worth a try."
"This beer poured a cloudy dark brown color and formed a light tan foamy head that left latticed lace as it subsided. An aroma of malts, chocolate, and bourbon. The flavor was of malt, coffee, caramel and a hint of chocolate. The body was medium light and the finish slight astringent and bitter."
"D: A pleasure to drink, good balance, flavorful, session-worthy strength. Nice surprise as an extra (thanks, Seb!), a solid choice and among the better American Browns I've tried."
"M/D: Really good mouthfeel and drinkability; it is a brown ale so not too strong, but not as weak as other browns such as newcastle. This is my favorite brown ale."
"Nice color, fairly clear, though a bit of yeast falls in at the finish. It's kind of a reddish brown, not like a brown on the blacker side. With a kind of thin head, about a cm or so, and it looks pretty loose, doesn't leave much lacing. Smells pretty good, like some burnt caramellized sugars, a hint of chocolate in the background, and a very nice clean sweetness in the beer. Nice and grainy I think, this fits the bill of a nice brown ale. Nothing excessive, everything in nice balance. The taste has all the things from the smell, with a tiny bit of sweet coffee thrown in there too. Starts on a nice little roasty, toasty note, comes in a bit grainy, like raw grainy, then it gets a bit sweet, with the nice burnt sugars, and a bit of bread too. All of the flavors kind of blend in nicely in the end, with some good cleanness. I like the taste, but it's not a standout, one of the beers you could drink often, but I doubt if I would crave it. The body is kind of thin I think, with a burst of carbonation at the start, and it disappears quickly. It's quite alright, but nothing too great. The drinkability is probably the best part. Nice and interesting, not a heavy hitter, nice balance, and despite the lighter body, is satisfying and enjoyable. I would reach for another if I didn't have something else to drink."
"It pours out a deep rich beer-bottle-brown color with a quickly dissipating tan head. Smells great. Chocolate, carmel, toffee, roasted malt... I detect all of these with the nose. Tastes just as it smells but with a buttery note and a creamy, almost milky texture. Light carbonation and no unwanted aftertaste to speak of. Slightly heavy but an easy drinker. Good beer."
"drinkability: good"
"Very nice mouthfeel to it, a most definite easy drinker."
"D: Satisfying, well brewed, but not awesome. It's that brown ale thing again that never thrills me."
"A very good dark brown ale almost tastes like a black ale to me. Nothing to flashy but for sure gets the job done. Would definitely take it over a newcastle and it is a dollar cheaper and has more alcohol content which makes it a little more hearty. Not amazingly good but pretty good."
"Overall, an excellent example of an American brown ale. I have had the opportunity to sample three beers from Short's that my Dad brought back from a fishing trip up in Michigan...and each one is quite remarkable. Looks like a brewery trip is in order."
"D- This is a really drinkable session beer that has great malt flavor and depth to it. I would love to try his on cask but it already has great qualities in the bottle."
"Deep mahoghany tone with billowing foam and some random spotty lacing. Toasty malt and nutty aroma. Rich and smooth, verging on porter but not as roasty. Very sessionable. Mild wood and nutty flavor with a low level residual bitterness. The silky smooth body feels like it has a lactose element there that lends fullness. Finishes dry and toasty. The yeast adds a touch of dried fruit to the nutty toasted malt flavors that dominate. Again very sessionable with a distinct fullness for a brown ale."
"Definitely tasty....another winner by Shorts."
"This on is light to medium bodied and very drinkable. In fact I will make sure to stock up on this for football season. A great session beer and with fall approaching a brown ale like this will be a great one to keep around."
"D: This beer is a great example of an ABA. Bring Short's to IL, please!"
"4.5/4.5/4.5/4.5/4.5"
"D- Fantastic session beer, wish I had picked up a 6 pack instead of just one. Cant wait to see this local."
"Poured a dark and oily as a stout. Smelled like a stout. Tasted like coffee like a stout. It was pretty good, but it was by far the darkest brown ale I've ever had. I was expecting something lighter and nuttier, but maybe I just don't know what I'm talking about. Not what I expected at all, but tasty nonetheless."
"One of my favorite brown ales and one that I often recommend to people who enjoy malty beers."
"expectional brown ale with a complex malt arangement without the heaviness. toasted nose of apples. smokey, some earth. dark fruit... palate is a wonderful malt character with sweet caramel and smokey malt blend without make acidic conflict. good amount of black currant. mild porter fruit. earth but bright... if possible. alcohol is not detectable. pepper dry finish with a great body. simple but hits all the bases exactly without any fuss."
"Silky smooth beer just flows down nicely just a nice mellow sippin beer. My favorite of short's offerings."
"D - As far as basic brown ales go, it's pretty good and would make a decent session beer. However, this particular offering isn't going to replace Bell's Best Brown at the top of my list anytime soon."
"This is definitely one of the better Brown Ales that I've had in a while. Nice balance between the American hops, roast, and sweetness, and the feel and drinkibility of this was great. I need to bring back sixers instead of singles next time I'm up in Michigan."
"D: Pretty tasty. One I would choose to session with if I did not have Maduro brown in my back yard. That being said a wonderful core beer from Shorts!"
"Poured a translucent, reddish brown, with decent head retention. The aroma was sweet tangy chocolate malt, almost exclusively - like a bag of semi-sweet chocolate morsels. Taste - CHOCOLATE. A small bit of espresso, some lactose, but mostly chocolate. I love it - very drinkable and satisfying, although a bit one dimensional. The mouthfeel is gorgeous - thick and luxurious, this is a lot like a chocolate milkshake. Very fine carbonation, silky, did I say thick? Not the most interesting brown ale in the world, but very tasty and incredibly solid. Enjoy without reservation."
"Blipped ""Legend of Pat Brown"" by the Vandals"
"Poured a very nice dark brown with a light brown, creamy head. The color is so dark it almost appears murky but upon closer inspection is actually sparkling clear. The Belgian lace is well formed and attractive. Rich malty notes with hints of toasted cereal, chocolate and nuts. Smoky? Restrained, yet balanced hops. Layered flavors. Lighter body than the color suggests. Highly refreshing. Rather moreish."
"A decent drink, but perhaps a little too run of the mill to be a repeat purchase."
"Talk about flavor! Initial sip is a big bold mouthful of malty goodness. Lots of toasted malt flavor, more brown bread and coffee. This has to be one of the most flavorful brown ales I've had, so much packed into each sip. Wow! As it warms the flavor just improves even more, I am really, really impressed by this beer. Brown ales tend to be a style that really doesn't blow me away since most times they taste relatively similar. Not this, its on a different level."
"a very easy going brown ale that is not too light and not too strong. low ABV makes this one easy beer to drink."
"The bottom line: If you're a brown ale fan then this should be on your try list. Short's has put together a smooth, enjoyable take on the style that will likely please fans of the style."
"D- I would seek this beer out again. Just a good all around beer to drink when I'm not in the mood for the hop bombs. Just overall a mighty fine beer."
"Chestnut-brown ale with a deep red hue in the right light. Carbonation seems a bit off; not much head is created with the pour. The aroma is outstanding though; with lots of complexity. Roasted coffee might be the predominant smell, but underneath that there's hazelnut and a musty, woody character. The taste is quite complex, too, with vanilla, oak, nuts, caramel -- there's all sorts of stuff going on here -- everything except hops. Overall, a very complex ale that is malt forward without being too sweet; The maltiness is offset by a dry finish. Although this isn't as good as the last glass I had on tap at the brewery, it's still a good beer and I'm enjoying it quite a bit."
"Pours a lightly hazed dark reddish brown, some orange highlighting, thin off white head forms, quickly settles down to a decently sized collar, few spots of lace stick to the glass. Smell is nice, chocolate milk, very nice toastiness, biscuits, touch of caramel sweetness, oats, lots of nuttiness, maybe a hint of dark fruit/raisin, but mostly very clean and malty. Taste is similar, very nutty, caramel, toast, biscuits, raisins and a bit of fruitiness, very bready, really quite earthy, nice chocolate malt finish, very dry and enjoyable. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with medium carbonation, leaves something to be desired but is pretty drinkable and tasty stuff. A pretty nice brown ale!"
"Tasty and easy to drink."
"I must say I'm a huge fan of this beer. Pours a dark brown with a nice tan head. Smell of chocolate and roasted malts. Tastes absolutely great. Caramel and chocolate coming right through, with a tad smokey finish. This is easily one of the best brown ales I've had. Could drink this for forever."
"Bottle. Light to medium translucent brown color with minimal head. Smell is sweet: fresh brown sugar, root beer, and mild hops. Taste is caramel and brown sugar, very sweet and refreshing with only slightest hint of hops for balance. Very clean and refreshing and a great summer beer. One of the best brown ales I've had and probably my favorite sampling from Short's so far."
"Overall one of the best brown ales I have ever had, and I have no issue with that at all. This is a must get and something I will keep as a staple in my fridge."
"Drinkability- Definitely a solid solid beer. This is probably the best American Brown Ale that I've had since Surly Bender. It just doesn't have that extra ummpfff that Bender does but it definitely tasty. I'd drink this damned regularly if I had access to it. Thanks Sean!"
"D- A great drinker. Full-flavored, yet not overwhelming. Tasty and unique enough that I'd seek it out again when I'm in the mood to go with an American Brown."
"A clear dark reddish brown color boday with a thin off-white head, light to medium carbonation. Aroma is toasty,nutty,sweet dark caramel with a chocolaty note. Flavor is really clean, roasty a bit of smoke,caramel,toffee,and just a hint of bitter chocolate, lite spicy hop tones,clean crisp mouthfeel,light to medium body,very quaffable, I seem to be gulping this down pretty fast. A long malty finish,. A solid Brown Ale."
"Nice example of a brown ale with no frills."
"Amazingly drinkable, this has to be my favorite or second favorite brown ale ever. Definitely a real treat."
"Pours a nice clean/clear dark golden brown color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy tan head, not much sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, nutty, with some caramel. The taste is malty, sweet, nice little bitterness, with some caramel. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is a very tasty brown ale."
"Such an easy drinker and a solid beer. Very good stuff."
"12oz bottle bought in Detroit this week. The beer is dark translucent reddish brown with a thin tan fine-celled wet foam. The aroma is sweet and malty, maybe just a little fruit or esters. Very inviting, and the taste is much much richer than I expected, a sweet malt bomb with a long lasting ester flavor. Thicker than your normal brown ale, this hits the spot in a way I didn't expect. May be the best brown ale I've ever had, completely worth it."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a sturdy malt profile. Good carbonation helps it flow down easily. A refreshing and easy drinking brown ale overall. I would enjoy a sixer of this over the course of a weekend for sure. Another solid beer from Short's."
"Overall, one of the better brown ales I've had, and well worth a try."
"Great beer, I was glad to have the chance to try this."
"This beer pours a hazy brown color with a nice creamy offwhite head. Smells of roasted malts and brown sugar. Tastes follows the smell with caramel malt and hints of chocolate. The mouthfeel has full body and is nice and smooth. High drinkability and a great session beer. Overall, a fine offering from Short's"
"Another good impression from the bottles coming out of Elk Rapids."
"HV"
"Mouthfeel is light bodied and highly carbonated, refreshing."
"All-in-all I'd say this is one of the top brown ales that I've had. I'm usually not seeking out this style, but I could make room for this every so often as it's a tasty brew. I'd put this up there with Surly Bender."
"not bad, but not my favorite from shorts"
"D - Nice flavor, well hidden alcohol, low carbonation - a very sessionable brown ale. I just happen to prefer the hoppiness of Bender..."
"Best beer I've had from Shorts. Loved it."
"D - I would not be able to drink a ton of these in a sitting as it is not my favorite style. However, for those that do enjoy a good brown ale I am sure that it would be an instant classic."
"D- An enjoyable brown. It doesn't have any of those annoying flavors that I often seem to find in this style. I will be getting this again."
"Notes: This beer has and will continue to convert the uneducated masses."
"Flat out well made beer - Shorts does it again. I'm generally not a fan of brown ales, but this is terrific, perfectly balanced and enjoyable. Thank you Shorts, for bottling your terrific beers!"
"D: This is remarkably enjoyable, one of the better browns I've had"
"Good dose of toasted grains and spicy hops up front. Cookie dough and caramel sweetness follow. Earthy licorice and spicy hop bitterness into the finish. Doughy malts linger. Pretty damn good! Medium body with good carbonation levels. A very nice sessionable American brown ale. Oh, and congratulations to the Short's gang for getting bottles out! I will definitely be buying more of this."
"Notes: great brown. this is now my third and final shorts brew (for now), and honestly my favorite. just a delicious dark beer."
"This is one of my classic favorites from Joe. Rich malty american brown style with a bit of a larger body than you might expect. Great hop bite with a wonderful balance. Poured a nice dark malty body. Beautiful head and a nice lacing. This is one of those beers that I could enjoy any time!! If you haven't had the chance, search out this or any of the Shorts beers and try them!!"
"This pours a dark brown color that initially put me off as I usually do not like darker beers. However this beer was amazingly easy to drink and appreciate. I rate this as the best brown available. It has subtle hops and almost a faint nut quality. My mother in law (who is not a beer drinker loves this also). I will still go for the pale ales but this is in the rotation."
"A nutty entrance leads to flavors of sweet toffee, caramel malt, brown sugar, maple syrup, and floral flavors. A hop backbone balances nicely."
