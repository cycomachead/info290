3.78,3.8,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 10/22/2014. Pours hazy deep reddish brown color with a 2 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of caramel, brown sugar, toast, toffee, plum, fig, pear, apple, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of dark/bready malt, earthy hop, and fruity yeast notes; with decent strength. Taste of caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, brown bread, cocoa, plum, fig, apple, herbal, grass, light pine, light nuttiness, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Light earthy herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, brown bread, cocoa, plum, fig, apple, light nuttiness, and herbal/toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice robustness and complexity and dark/bready malt, earthy hop, and light-moderate fruity yeast flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, fairly creamy/bready, and slightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good brown ale. All around nice complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt, earthy hop, and light-moderate fruity yeast flavors; and very smooth to drink for the ABV. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 02, 2015"

3.46,-4.9,4,3.5,3.25,3.75,3.5,"Bottled on 10/14/2014: Pours chestnut brown color and almost looks like watery caramel with a huge looking foamy 2 finger tan head that faded slowly and left good spotty lacing going down the sides. Smells of caramel, toasted grains, brown sugar, wet wheat bread, metallic yeast funk, light piney hops, dry crackers and what I perceive as allspice; the spicy notes at the end give it the “festive” holiday aroma. No nuts in the nose, but all the malt of a brown ale. Taste is very similar but it has more hops which seem floral to go along with the pine cone taste, and it has additional spices like cumin and cinnamon which make the flavor way more winter seasonal. The toasted grains and malts are strong and work well with the hops and spices, but I’m not a huge winter warmer type so I was hoping for more brown ale basics but should have expected the spice rack in the mix. Mouthfeel is light and almost watery, with a lighter body, and a sweet malty finish that leaves a mix of spices like potpourri. Decent holiday beer, more winter warmer than brown ale IMO, but still decent overall yet not my cup of tea or favorite style (winter warmer aspect).","CHickman","Feb 09, 2015"

Flavor reveals underpinnings of that fruity malt character, with a toasted, nutty, harshly bitter and woody finish. There's a bit of pine that emerges late. That fruity character just clashes with the bitterness, reminding me of medicine, and the nuttiness is borderline burnt.","barczar","Dec 05, 2014"

The palate starts creamy and chocolaty supported by dry grain flavors then mild fruit cake and dark dried fruit flavors emerge then drying slightly by the finish with a does of herbal astringency moderated by a touch of residual sweetness. Mid-palate offers a smidgen of vanilla, light caramel, and a hint of anise or cardamom.  Very fine soft carbonation and a body slightly above medium.","pat61","Nov 29, 2014"

The taste is decent for a strong brown with a hint of yeast in the taste to add complexity and balanced well with semi-toasty and fruity elements which fit the style well -I could drink this frequently-very enjoyable American Style brown ale","Slatetank","Nov 24, 2014"

This one pours a murky ruby-sienna topped by a finger of glowing off-white foam.  The nose comprises maple syrup backed by mild pine resin and mixed greens.  The taste turns the tables, leading with the pine-led greens and backing up with the maple syrup.  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish.  Overall, this isn't a bad brown, really, but I, for one, feel the overt hoppiness hurts things in general.  I won't have another of these, as far as I can see, but I also won't dissuade someone from having one, either.","TMoney2591","Nov 23, 2014"
