"Was expecting a lighter, thinner brew.  Turns out it was quite thick and the taste was approaching an Russian Imperial Stout.  While not a bad beer, I felt it would have been more apt under the Russian Imperial Stout style.  Ah yes, the brew hid the alcohol well, and tasted better as it warmed."
"Cocoa and coffee on the nose mixed with roast malts with a good balance between the added aromas and the malt driven aromas. Pours brilliant deep dark brown under a 2” persistent, rocky foam cap that produces fine lace. The palate closely follows the nose with malt derived coffee and cocoa flavors well balanced with the added coffee and cocoa nibs all pulled together in the finish with a bitter hop accent supplementing bitter notes from the roast malts and the added flavors. There is a fine ribbon of sweetness throughout which recedes during the finish with a grainy, coffee, cocoa dryness and hop bitterness. Medium full body and medium carbonation."

"Muddy brown with ruby edges.  Sweet and nutty nose.  The flavor profile is unfortunately infiltrated by a funny floral taste on the finish that does not quite mix with everything else."

"Interesting beer. A brown ale that plays like a porter or a stout"
""
"Great beer, I loved the coffee back taste. It was just enough"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Feel: Again, feels and drinks more like a porter/stout that what I am used to as a brown ale.  Good carbonation."
""
""
""
"This is a good Brown Ale. With the addition of coffee and chocolate, I might have guessed this was a porter. Good solid beer but not great."
""
"One of my favorite browns along with Rogues Hazelnut. Good coffee flavor"
""
""
""
"Poured from a 22 oz. bottle, into a Belgian tulip glass."
""

"M - medium bodied with medium/high carbonation. Finishes medium dry."

"Overall: Board Meeting is a really solid brown ale, however I think a lowering of the level of carbonation and a little less bitterness would be a big improvement. 3.75"

"The genius here is instead of using a lot (or any) roasted malts, they brewed an imperial brown ale and kept it fairly dry and quaffable, but used the cacao nibs and coffee to give it the flavor of a robust porter or stout. You would think an 8.5% dark beer would be a sipper, but I found it very easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
"O: recommended for coffee lovers"
""
"Solid brown ale. I'm used to these types of flavors in porters and stouts but not in brown ales until now. I'm glad Port Brewing has ventured out and taken my taste buds where they haven't been yet."

"Aftertaste is bitter coffee with a hoppy edge. From the 22 oz bottle purchased at Ibis Market in Mission Hills."
"O: This is a nice full flavored brown ale with good flavors and decent complexity. It hits all the right notes and has solid balance."

"On tap at Cannery Row Brewing in Monterey. I had no idea this was 8.5%, but it was immediately clear this was a delicious brown ale. The body is relatively light for the weight, I figured this wasn't more than 6 or 6.5%. Isn't of a brown ale's usual slow rolling notes, this beer had pointed notes of cocoa and coffee, dark toasted bread, a couple touches of dark berries, and then more coffee. Easiest one of the biggest brown ales I've ever had. I want more."
""
""
"O - Good brown the alcohol is well hidden in this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer does a great job of featuring its additions and is quite tasty as such. That being said I feel it could use a bit more hop/alt support for balance as the additions are almost all I taste. That would take it from very good to great. Overall a very well made beer & I enjoyed it"

"Coffee-forward with notes of dark cocoa and sweet roasty malts. Has mellowness and fervor with a noticeable alcohol peeking in. A great morning ale, for sure."

"Overall, pretty good, but not the top of a brown ale class. I would have again but not searching out to find this as a brown ale."
""
""
""
""
""
"All the ports I've had, had been of the IPA style so this porter is a refreshing change of pace. And is equally up to task."
"This is probably the best brown ale I have ever had. The beer pours a nearly opaque deep rich brownish amber. The ecru head is thick and frothy and is leaving a very nice lace. The smell is rich with earth, peat, espresso, alcohol and chocolate. The taste has almost a tiramisu flare....bread, with mocha balance. The first few sips also carried an alcohol push. The mouthfeel is full bodied with smooth carbonation. Overall this is an excellent beer and should be loved by all who favor brown ales."
""
""
""

"Overall this is a delicious beer! There are not a lot of imperial brown ales out there so jump on this if you come across it!"

"Bitter roasty coffee, dark blend with plenty of char, unsweetened dark chocolate and cocoa as well. Intense coffee that packs a punch. Dry and roasty aftertaste that lingers. Smooth and slightly creamy, though a little thin bodied. Easy drinking, and a pleasantly powerful coffee infused brown ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a good winter type brew. Very heavy tho, I could only have one. Just a giant coffee bomb to make a long story short. Very nice."
""

"Board Meeting is basically a two flavor beer. But gosh, both flavors are impressive. First comes a butterscotch/fudge combination and following after is the big roasted coffee note. I thought that I would be drinking something to jump start your day, however it's tasting more like a dessert with a squeeze of booze. Coffee lovers will definitely be all over this, as well as those who want something to pair with their tiramisu."
""
""
"O: Great coffee beer! Most coffee beers i have had just have hints of it but this one brings it front and center! Great mix of coffee chocolate and dark fruit also sets this apart and keeps it from being a one dimensional coffee beer! Little disappointed at the weird thinning as warmed but still a great brew!"

"Poured from a 22oz bomber into a pint glass. Pours a brownish black with a two finger head. The first note to hit the nose is the cocoa. There is hint of coffee in the background. I like that it isn't over whelming. There is a nice amount of malt that enhances the flavor going down. A very good brown ale. I will be drinking this one again."
"Slightly viscous and full bodied with a really nice roasted coffee flavor.  Great roasted espresso/coffee flavor without being burnt or acid.   Creamy with lactose and a silky chocolate malt backbone.  Fudge/dessert-like cake, sweet cocoa, caramel, toffee and hazelnut.   One of the better coffee beers I've had recently.  "

"Poured from bottle into a treehouse snifter. Dark brown with a nice 2-3 finger head. Good retention and decent lacing. Smell on this beer is very good. Chocolate comes through like crazy with a nice coffee backup. Taste is strong chocolate also. My issue was with the coffee, kinda weird, not sure what's causing the off taste. I normally love big bitter coffee taste, but not here. Maybe it's just from being shipped of sitting in the fridge for a couple weeks. Maybe fresh is best here."
"O: This was like a chocolate hazelnut flavored coffee. I could drink this for breakfast. The sweet/bitter balance is awesome. I recommend this for everyone."
""
""

""

""

""
""
"O: Impressive from the first sip. The coffee flavor is prominent without being overpowering. Alcohol content is masked impressively."
""
"Much better than I was expecting, deeper in flavor and more coffee than I expected, while the base beer is a bit richer than your average brown ale. Pours very dark brown, with a thick, cafe and cream colored, creamy head. Lots of rich coffee in the nose as well as a touch of brown sugar and cream. Really nicely balanced tastes of coffee, cream, roasted grain, brown sugar, some earthy hop bitterness, and chewy chocolate notes- like a really good chocolate chip cookie. Still, it drys out a bit at the end. Overall, quite a package of flavor. This sat neglected in my fridge for too long- a very nice beer."

"Rather lightly bodied for the amount of alcohol in it. Medium bodied with brisk carbonation, body stays consistent, a little thin upfront, but otherwise pretty rich without being overbearing. Bitter sweet cocoa up front with hints of dark chocolate. Subtle fruity nuances underneath it all. Finishes with a creamy coffee flavor and a very faint bitterness that balances the sweetness. Coffee and cocoa flavors linger. Would make an excellent breakfast beer except for the abv. Very deceptive with it's abv as well. Tastes and drinks like an incredibly complex yet drinkable and flavorful american brown."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a nice take on an often hard to make style."
""
""
"Overall - a solid Brown Ale worth trying."
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is very flavorful among brown ales. I liked how you could still smell and taste the nutty malts that are typical of the style and how the coffee and cocoa nibs made the taste a lot more interesting."

"O - well rounded dark brown porter lstyle beer with coffee overtones"
"Drinkability- I thought it was pretty good. I would have it again but I usually don't drink brown ales. Very good for a brown ale though"
"Overall, I enjoyed this beer a lot. I think I would prefer the carbonation slightly dialed down because I believe this should be a digestif but that is my only complaint."
"Medium body, slightly milder carbonation, smooth and chewy on the tongue. An interesting beer that tip toes down the lines of brown ale, imperial brown ale and stout."
"overall, decent. it looks beautiful upon pour. the smell is nice and the taste definitely follows. has a good abv. not my preferred style, but very good regardless..."
"Definitely tasty, if you like a good coffee/cocoa combo it's hard not to enjoy this - though the flavors are a little tolling/one-note it is pretty solid overall. I'll probably purchase this again sometime."
""
"Overall-Excellent beer. One of the ones I bought when I was at the brewery in San Marcos last month. Definitely a standout in the Port lineup."

"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 2/4/2013. Pours nearly pitch black dark brown color with a 2 finger dense khaki head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of chocolate, roasted coffee, cocoa, caramel, biscuit, toast, toffee, nuttiness, light floral, and toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark malt, cocoa, and coffee notes; with good strength. Taste of chocolate, roasted coffee, cocoa, caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, nuttiness, light floral, and toasted earthiness. Lingering notes of chocolate, coffee, caramel, cocoa, toast, toffee, biscuit, nuttiness, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of malt, cocoa, and coffee flavors; with nice robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent imperial brown ale. All around nice balance and complexity of dark malt, cocoa, and coffee flavors; and very smooth to drink for the gravity. A very enjoyable offering."
""
""
"O: A pretty fine beer. The coffee isn't great, and whatever is up with the slight sourness worries me a bit. I will probably not be drinking this again, but couldn't fault someone for choosing to do so."

"Overall: This beer, like the Palo Santo Marron by Dogfish Head, both have an identity problem. Palo Santo is closer to an Imperial IRS and whereas this one could have been easily labeled a Rauchbier. It is a pretty solid beer nonetheless. I would buy it again at $5.00 but it's too expensive for $8.00 !!"
""
""
"Overall, an interesting brown. I think it's a bit to heavy handed with the coffee, but it's still quite enjoyable."
""
""
"Impressive. Good on ya port, maybe my second favorite beer after older vis."
"Even with the cocoa nibs and coffee, it remains a Brown Ale without transforming into a Stout. A great value at around $7 / 22oz bottle. Super-solid (Imperial) Brown Ale."
""
"What i mean by this is that it is missing an accent flavor in there somewhere. Something subtle but notable. Coffee is the only strong presence and some might be put off by it and call it a one-trick-pony. I enjoyed its darkness though. Deep coffee flavors and light carbonation."
""
""
""
"A big brown ale that rolls right to the line for porters and stouts. Delicious. Nice reminder that Port can do more than just terrific IPAs (not that I am not eager for their Anniversary Ale any day now). I almost overlooked this. Don't make that mistake."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall not bad, but get a little too harsh as it goes, coffee starts nice but everntually gets overpowering, harsh, slightly bitter and acrid even. Hard to drink much of it either."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Dark brown color. Smell is nothing extraordinary, as an the taste was a very strong coffee. Mouthfeel was very smooth, and not overly carbonated . Only complaint (just my opinion), is the coffee flavor was a bit more than I would like. Otherwise a good choice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- very complex layers of flavor while still staying within the realm of a brown ale. This style usually isn't my thing, but this one stands a level above all of the others I've had of the style. Highly reccomended"

"I’m drinking less and less cream and sugar with my coffee and replacing it with beer these days. Board Meeting is a new (released February of this year) and delicious brown ale from Port Brewing. This beer is brewed with coffee from local San Diego coffee roasters Ryan Brothers and cocoa nibs from San Francisco chocolate makers TCHO.What makes this beer great is the perfect balance of these high profile flavors. It pours dark- it could be confused with a stout. The aroma is a perfect prelude to the taste as the taste is very predictable and inviting. It’s as if the excellent craftsmanship of the beer corrals the strong coffee and chocolate notes and soothes them to subtlety. The slight dry bitterness at the end finishes even more smoothly. ABV is 8.5% and is sold only in 22oz (so far). One bottle is just not enough so grab two!"
""
""
""
" The taste is very good with plenty of dark malt toastiness and some light vegetal tinges from the cacao with mild roasted bean taste and gentle tannin in the middle with relatively clean yeast and light bitterness earthy qualities of hops and the coffee/cocoa come through with a nice toasted grain backbone in the malt. I thought this was very drinkable for an imperial brown and the added flavors complimented the base very well -I recommend this to fans of the style."

"o: pretty good, though if I closed my eyes I wouldn't know it was a brown. this is a real nice drinker. reminds me of something like a palo santo maron"
""

"O - An excellent brew. Digging this one"
"Poured on-tap and served in a shaker pint, the beer is a dark chestnut coloring with a low profile, filmy, light tan head. Decent lacing as you drink. Aromas of roast mocha and hazelnut, with a touch of smoke. Flavors are rich and roasty, with a nutty sweetness like Nutella and a touch of bitter coffee in the backbone. Very balanced. Smooth and rich in mouth, with a roasted sweet aftertaste. Clean, creamy finish. Great brew."
"Overall a very tasty coffee brown slash porter."
"D - I really liked this. Split a bottle three-ways and it went down shockingly quickly. Will definitely be buying this one again, as it's a winner. Glad to see Port Brewing making something new, as it's been a while since Mongo."
""
""
"This might be better described as a Porter, but even there, this is a helluva beer--extraordinarily flavorful and easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Once again a good beer from Port Brewing. This brown ale highlights all the flavors very nicely, but the coffee does seem to shine moreso than the cocoa nibs when it was cold(ish). As it warmed to just under room temp, the cocoa really shined. Great drinkability, and would definitely buy again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

"O: This is an awesome brown ale. It reminds me a lot of coffee bender but honestly it's better. Coffee isn't overpowering but is still quite nice. Chocolate adds nice complexity and competing sweetness. Very drinkable and goes down easy. Great job, Port Brewing."
""
""
"Overall I really enjoyed this Brown. A lot of flavor for a relatively cheaper $6-7 bomber with fun session to behold. 8.5% gives it some meat, but overall a bomber consumption was perfect. Very nice creation from Port."
""
""
"This is one super-fantastic Brown Ale. I love coffee and chocolate in my beers and this delivers. Very rich and robust, somewhere between a Porter/Stout and Brown Ale. Yummy!"
""
""
"Pours an extremely dark brown color, almost black...with a large tan head that goes down rather quickly. Scent is better than any brown ale I've ever had (from what I can remember off the top of my head). Dark and roasted malt with some nice nuttiness. Packed with coffee and chocolate, it still keeps it's nutty, brown-ale profile without entering the porter/stout domain. Taste on the other hand is a different story. Cocoa up front. A ton of chocolate cocoa with a good amount off fresh ground coffee. Vanilla lingers on the palate, along with a hint of allspice and cinnamon. Lots of rich, dark malt flavor and nuttiness. The flavor is definitely stepping into porter/stout territory. Mouthfeel is full bodied, creamy, and ABV is well hidden. Drinkability is high. Overall, this is probably the best brown ale I have ever had. In a blind tasting, I could see this mistaken for a coffee porter or coffee stout. Outstanding beer, no matter what you wanna label it as."
"O - Drinks like a porter more than a brown; thick and roasty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Bought it on a whim, and holy shit this is good stuff. Only my second offering from Port/Lost Abbey and this is really good stuff, very impressed."
""
"Overall: this is a superb brown ale with loads of flavor and is nicely drinkable despite the higher ABV. This is one of the better brown ales you will have."
"22oz bottle $6.99. Description sounded pretty good and I've found Port beers to be more consistent and affordable than Lost Abbey so I gave it a shot. Dark brown, definitely a brown ale not a porter. Smell is decent cofffee, not bad. Flavor is more coffee, I get no chocolate nibs, pretty meh overall. I would not purchase this again and it was a little too strong to boot."
""
"Pours a very dark brown. Opaque. Looks black in a full glass. Big head of light brown foam. A thick blanket of fine bubbles. Good looking beer. The aroma is all coffee and chocolate. Some roast and a bit of caramel in the background. It smells like a mocha made with dark chocolate milk. Mild cola, a little molasses and some light floral hoppiness. It sort of has that nutty brown ale flavor, but I would have guessed stout if I'd been handed this beer blind. The taste has lots of toasty malt below rich coffee and chocolate. The taste seems closer to a strong brown ale than a stout, but the coffee and chocolate additions mask that somewhat. It's fairly sweet. Very rich with flavor. There's just a ton of chocolate and coffee to the beer. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy and does wonders for the beer. Good nutty, coffee finish. Excellent addition to Port's lineup."
""
"O/D-This must have caffeine in it right!?"
"Pours a deep brown with a huge overflowing mocha head and nice lacing. A fantastic aroma; the brown ale is definitely there with some nice sweet breadiness and nuttiness, then there's a mild coffee offering some nice roastiness, and the cocoa nibs offering some rich milk chocolate. The coffee was kinda mild in the flavor, but definitely not so in the flavor. Huge coffee flavor on top the nice malty brown ale base with the cocoa closing things out. Flavor definitely came out as it warmed up some, big difference. A medium bodied, creamy mouthfeel. Overall, great beer."
""
"Overall its a very good tasting beer."
""
""
"O - This is a really, really good brown. Balance is off the charts and can easily see myself buying these in bulk for around $5 a bomber."
"I'm not really a fan of brown ales but this is one of the few that I'd drink again any time. A rich, creamy, malty treat."
""
"Overall: I was impressed by this one, though I would say it drinks more like a porter than a brown ale. The coffee is definitely the star of this beer, so if you're not a fan of coffee forward beers you may want to stay away. Otherwise I'd definitely recommend picking up a bottle."
""
""
"Overall: Smooth, creamy, yet the carbonation was right where I wanted it to be. I've encountered many, many brown ales where the motivation behind it and final delivery were zero-minus, but, not here. I quite liked it; a top-notch brown ale."
"Mouthfeel is lush and inviting. Not too thin, not too thick. Quenching but rich at the same time."
""
""
"Fantastic brown ale and all around beer. I love that the coffee and chocolate are there but are not dominating of the beer. The roasty goodness of some of the great coffee stouts/porters in a more light-bodied (still hefty) ale"
"Pours an almost opaque crimson-brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. A foamy latticework of lace coats the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, roasted malt, and lots of coffee bean aromas. Taste is much the same with huge coffee flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with some great coffee aromas and flavors."
"When I thought I had already had the ultimate chocolate/coffee beers... This comes along. What a wonderful, yet hearty experience this is to drink. It totally shows what a beer can become depending on the quality of ingredients added to it. I still can't get any classic brown ale characteristics here, but it is pretty delicious overall. It makes a great dessert beer for sure, and pairing it with TCHO chocolate could be even better. It's not the most balanced beer in displaying all of its ingredients, but it still was easy and pleasurable to drink. Recommended."
"Overall this one is better than the sum of the parts. Super smooth and tasty ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Really enjoyed this and easy drinking. ABV well hidden. Would have again."
""
""

"Overall, what a fantastic brown ale. It's a great example of a brewery doing something different yet successful with a style."
""
""
"(I have to think that Gwen had her hand in this beer! I've never met anyone who knows more about flavor profiles and the science behind them. I'm guessing on this but I wouldn't be surprised if she helped ""push the envelope"" a bit on this one). Nice drink!"
""
""
""
"NOTE: In growler 9.1.13. Much richer. Would have rated it higher."
"O: This is a very good big brown ale with a lot of flavour, just wish it didn't cost more than a bomber of Old Viscosity."
"D: Drinks more like a rich coffee porter. Has that intense fresh coffee flavor but without the heavy malt bill that a stout would carry. Coffee is forward and tends to drown out the characteristic brown ale qualities but really nice balance overall with good session ability. A nice offering if one is into coffee beers. Works well for me. I would take this over Surly Coffee Bender."
""
"Nice looking beer - nice chocolate body, sticky layered mocha lace. The ingredients list namedrops some pretty impressive purveyors of beans and nibs from SoCal - the beer showcases them nicely. Nice and rich - layers of well integrated coffee, creamy chocolate, roasted malt. A really nice coffee brown - roasty, lower bitterness, creamy and rich. Would definitely grab more of this."
""
""

"High B"

"Overall, I'm very pleased. I would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys coffee stouts and porters but wants a seemingly lighter and easier to drink beer."
