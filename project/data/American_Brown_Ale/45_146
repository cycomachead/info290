The hop-heads will no doubt hate it, but for those who prefer things a bit maltier (ie. people like me) this isn't bad at all.

Boom! The rush of liquid into my glass was fascinating, creating a big, rolling pseudo-cascade as I watched. Like most males, I am a very visual learner and I was transfixed by the creation of two-plus fingers of dense, light-tan head with great retention. I held it up to the naural light of the day to behold and I was not disappointed. I fully agree with ""mahogany", but I might substitute ""garnet"" for ""ruby"" (SRM = > 27, < 34) as I need to put my own stamp on this review. Otherwise, I might just do a cut 'n' paste and call it a day. Did they mention clarity? No. I will classify it as ""button-bright"" and leave it at that. The nose was malty, sure, but cut with a minty, grassy hoppiness. Remind me, why have I not reviewed this until now? Mouthfeel was full and creamy and the taste was like Baby Bear's Brown Ale - just right! The malt was present, but not cloying and the hops were in the mix, but not overwhelming. I have had English Brown Ales that were sickeningly sweet and American Brown Ales that caused me to wonder if the brewer knows when to take his foot off of the gas when it comes to hops. Finish was smooth, semi-dry and eminently drinkable. I do not often drink Brown Ales, but when I do, Brooklyn Brown is my choice. Stay crazy, my friends.","woodychandler","Jul 01, 2014"

More noticeable coffee and chocolate notes that I have tasted in a brown ale before and a great heavy dose of the malt. This sounds more like a stout, but Brooklyn made their ale more drinkable with a background of hops, a reasonable alcohol content and a mouthfeel that is certainly full-bodied, but not overly thick and exclusively wintery. A solid brown ale in my book.","juanny","Jun 19, 2014"

3.85,6.4,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,3.75,"Brooklyn Brewery has yet to go wrong in my book, with some solid lagers and pale ale family offerings tried to date. Here we try the brown ale, a reddish brown brew with a few fingers of frothy tan head, poured from the bottle into an English pint glass. This one has a nice malty aroma, brown crust, light molasses, and dark fruits with a fragrant cola-like brown spice, herbal licorice, and hints of citrus zest. The palate is also malt-forward, fruity, and spicy, with some orange and grapefruit rind from the more aggressive American brown ale approach to hopping. Tastefully done. Starts with some chocolate chips and light roast coffee, after which a plum and raisin-like fruitiness emerges, followed by cola and a tannic astringency like black tea. Moderately chewy but dries out the mouth a little, finishing long, earthy, and spicy ... Reminds me of an English pale ale or IPA in this regard. Well below a porter or stout in terms of roasted flavor but I appreciate the fruit and spice notes receiving top billing here. Brooklyn has a real knack for combining tactful but assertive flavor hopping with some great old world malt flavors.","CalgaryFMC","Feb 26, 2014"

This stuff pours a clear sunset russet topped by a finger of pale khaki foam. The nose comprises toasted malts, thick toffee, a hint of cocoa powder, and a vague sense of light greens. The taste brings in more of the same, along with a bit of vague breadiness and a touch of dry molasses. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a nice little brown ale, nothing all that special, but something I could see drinking again (though Moose Drool remains my go-to).","TMoney2591","Aug 28, 2013"

Now I tried it from a bottle served in a pint glass so I will would try it again off a tap (if I could find it in indiana), but until then I would not suggest this for a bottle purchase.

Pours crystal clear reddish brown color with a nice 1-2 finger dense khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty foamy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of chocolate, caramel, biscuit, toasted malt, roast, light coffee, toffee, herbal, and light dark fruits. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity. Taste of chocolate, caramel, biscuit, toasted malt, nuttiness, toffee, roast, light coffee, and light herbal spiciness. Slight herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, caramel, biscuit, toffee, toast, nuttiness, and light herbal on the finish for a bit. Very nice flavor balance, complexity, and robustness; zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very creamy and lightly slick mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with pretty much zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice brown ale! Nicely robust and full of balanced flavors; and very smooth to drink. Really enjoyed this one.","superspak","Dec 08, 2012"

3.63,0.3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"a good beer, but thats about it, servicable but nothing stand out. the pour is a clear copper to bronze color with a short white head. the nose is plenty of european malts, caramel, pale, and something a little darker. not much hops, but a little sweetness and some earthy tones. flavor is quite good, very wintery, with the sweet form the malt taking center stage in front of a mild english hop backing. not sure what the alcohol is, but i can taste it a little, especially in the finish. still a drinkable brew though, with great carbonation and only just a medium body. i think i like this because its a bock without all the sugar, and not as heavy as some of the spring bocks, its perfect for the season. not the star of the winter 12er, but a beer i will happily consume again.","StonedTrippin","Nov 30, 2012"

3.16,-12.7,4.5,3.5,3,2.5,3,"Very odd beer from a usually reliable brewery. I think it looks fantastic, just like a brown ale should -- a very dark mahogany brown with a creamy head that lingers. Unfortunately the nose is just routine: some cherries, some chocolate reminiscent of very rich sweet milk chocolate, a whisper of hops. The flavors are even more restrained than the nose -- chocolate malt and some hops, mainly, with a very light cherry finish. This beer is interesting in that I think the problem lies in a criteria I usually blow past when I do one of these things -- the mouthfeel. I think the beer is so disappointingly light because I think the mouthfeel is too light, like most brown ales it does better with a heavier mouthfeel (to support the stronger flavors). Not Brooklyn's best.","dougbassett","Oct 13, 2012"

Coffee, dark chocolate, and caramel comprise the aroma. Dark chocolate, coffee, caramel, and a strong herbal hop presence. Medium-bodied with low carbonation. Not bad. Reminds me a lot of some of the older craft beers and of the brown ales I used to drink when I lived in Maine years ago. Delicious.","MrHurmateeowish","Sep 21, 2012"

3.88,7.2,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Poured from a bottle and served in a tumbler pint, the beer is a vibrant, slightly translucent ruby-brown coloring with a short stacked, off-white, light head that quickly settles down into a filmy coating with a ring of bubbling around the edge of the surface. Aromas are rich, roasted, and nutty, with a touch of toffee throughout. Smells sweet, but not overpoweringly so. Flavors are blended well and smooth throughout, with a roasted nut backbone that has touches of hazelnut as well chestnut and peanut characters. Sweet buttercream highlights keep all of the flavors playing along together, leading to a light, creamy aftertaste and a quick, clean finish. The increased carbonation and light body keep the beer from becoming cloying or overpowering. Very easy to drink with a very decent flavor profile overall. Tasty.","GarthDanielson","Apr 28, 2012"

3.94,8.8,3.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,"Overall I liked this beer and I thought it was a good example of an American Brown Ale, it had some nice complex aromas and flavors that were more robust then the average American Brown Ale and that made this beer stick out a little and made it memorable. This beer had pretty good drinkability it went down pretty fast and smooth and had enough flavor to hold my attention, I could see drinking two or three of these in a row if I was in the mood for a Brown Ale. What I liked most about this beer was the aroma, it was really nice, roasty, and complex, I thought it was really well done. What I liked least about this beer was the slight tartness on the finish of this beer, it just seemed out of place, and it was unnecessary. I would buy this beer again if it was available, but since it's not I doubt I will be having it anytime soon. If you like American Brown Ales I for sure recommend giving this beer a try. This was my first beer from Brooklyn Brewery and I have to say that I was impressed and that it made for a pretty good first impression for this brewery and I am interested in trying many more beers from this brewery, there are more then a couple that I have my eye on. Good Job guys this is one solid American Brown Ale.","StoutHunter","Apr 10, 2012"

Taste follows the nose and is a straightforward ABA with a little coffee and nice blend of hops and malts. Easy drinking and refreshing. Feel is silky and creamy with good carbonation and medium body. Overall- I'm a big fan of Brooklyn and think they did a good job on their ABA. It's not out of this world, but it is very solid and is a good interpretation of the style. Solid blending of malts and carmel, good feel and I will be hitting a few more of these-","TheDinger","Apr 01, 2012"

Nicely nutty with some nice mild caramel. Definitely tastes more English than American to me. Mouthfeel is good and smooth. About medium with low carbonation. Very nice.

3.61,-0.3,4,3,4,3.5,3.5,"The appearance of this beer is a nice dark brown with red/mahogany highlights. The head was big and lingered slightly for a long time. The smell is sweet caramel and toasted grains, but very mild (although the beer is a little colder than I would like it to be.) The taste is syrupy sweet with an accent of hop flavor and bitterness in the middle and then blends into a smooth mocha finish. The mouthfeel is creamy and full bodied. This is a pretty good brown ale, but I think the flavor either needs more malt flavor and backbone or a bigger hop profile. It is seated right in between and while it is good, it is not amazing.","jifigz","Dec 09, 2011"

There's an aroma of toasted bread and chestnut, leaning towards more nuttiness. The flavor is a bit more powerful, and adds a healthy swirl of caramel to the nutty notes that carry over from the nose. Almost chocolate-y. There's a sweet, cream edge to it, adding definition and form. Lightly carbonated, but is enough to keep the beer from turning syrupy. Better than most browns I've had, but it does represent more of an amber than a brown ale. Definitely can drink this several times.","alee42","Nov 26, 2011"

The nose is just a little bit weak, but there's still the aroma of toasted bread/biscuits, as well as a distinct nuttiness. The flavor is a bit more powerful, and adds a healthy swirl of caramel to the nutty and bready notes that carry over from the nose. A little bit more roast in the form of chocolate or coffee notes would have really topped things off nicely. The body is appropriately sturdy for an average sized brown ale, with a nice creamy edge to it. Carbonation is barely there, but it is enough to keep the beer from turning syrupy.

This problem might be solved if I drank it at a temperature about ten degrees warmer, so I will have to review it again at that temperature and see.

The color was a deep rich brown amber with white head that laced well. The nose had a hint of brown sugar or molassis. The taste was a little sharp, but decent. Certainly had rich malt subtle sweetness. The mouthfeel was good thank to the light ABV. This beer is worth a taste and definitely a SESSION!!!","WoodBrew","Apr 23, 2011"

The taste is considerably hoppier than the aroma. It is full of citrus with the roasted malt and toffee backing up the hops. Bitterness is moderate. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a velvety texture, and moderate carbonation. Overall, this is a really nice beer. I am usually not a fan of hoppy brown ales, but this one works for me.

Even a little dark chocolate and some earthy hop flavor, balancing out the caramel and molasses. The metallic element is a little more evident in the palate. It's not harsh, but not pleasant either.

There is an odd balance with funky lemon/bitter hoppiness blended with roasted malt, and stale prunes (if that's possible). It just doesn't quite work. Dry, metallic, sour, a bit watery.

A bit of hops - just a bit - add a sorta-floral, kinda-herbal, ever so slightly soapy aroma like lavender or lemon thyme. Thin on the palate and perhaps unnecessarily well-attenuated, with vivacious carbonation and a crisp, dry finish that almost comes across as harsh. It does no favors to the flavors, which are all toffee and walnut and resin and mocha and require a bit more viscosity and a little less fizz to really express themselves.

The nose consisted of caramel, hazelnut, milk chocolate, and coffee, with a hint of herbal hops as well. Definitely a sweet, nutty, malty balance throughout, with a hoppier than expected essence as well. While some may find fault with the latter, I think it actually worked nicely; especially in mixing with the sweet finish.

I guess I was anticipating more malty and roasty character, but this beer has quite a lot of grassy, herbal and slightly lemon hop flavor. Malt is definitely there, but it is not the star of the show, more of a supporting cast with its malty, slightly roasty and brown sugar notes. They flavors definitely go together, but it seems somewhat blah overall. Mouthfeel is medium with a subdued, yet prickly carbonation and a finish that is slightly dry but with a lingering sweetness.

What I mean is-I have had quite a few browns lately that while more complex-stray a bit into other styles adding flavors that weren't originally associated with the style back when it was first brewed. This Brooklyn Brown goes back to the old school and tastes like the Belgian Brunes. Caramelized brown sugar, molasses, dark fruits and roasty malt sweetness.

Taste is very much the same, slightly roasty, chocolaty. Seems a little watered down though. Goes down very easy, I guess by definition this would be a good session beer. I found it's best when you have two at a time! Honestly, I was a little disappointed this didn't have more kick than it did. I like Brooklyn's beer and I felt they kind of phoned it in with this one.

It smelled great, I tend to have a tougher time smelling the hops in brown ales, but no problem with this one, had a nice hoppy smell as well as the caramel malts. It tasted nice as well, starts with the malts and a nice hoppy aftertaste. Full bodied and full of flavor.

There is a little bit of malty sweetness and little bit of bitter hops, but not much of anything and not very exciting. Very, very carbonated and a medium body.

The label says it's ""richer and hoppier than its mild and malty English forbearers"" - well, I beg to disagree, as a hoppy English brown ale served on cask could be more all the more lively in all departments and still smoother and balanced than this filtered (and pasteurised?) bottle can offer.","wl0307","May 14, 2009"

I sense nuttiness, specifically walnut. The mouthfeel really is overly light and nondescript. There is a sticky feel from the drink. However, the beer goes down smoothly enough.

The taste starts off with roasted caramel malt which is cut by a lime-like acidity. A mineral water presence runs throughout. There is some light nut flavors towards the end as well as some stale hops. The feel is moderate with fizzy carbonation; it finishes kind of sour and bitter from the lime presence. Not the feel I expected from a brown ale, I expected more of a smooth malty feel. I was disappointed in this brew, definitely not my favorite Brooklyn brew.

Average amount of foamy tan head falls away pretty quickly but leaves fine sheets of light lace. The nose is predictably malty but, like the appearance, has more character than expected. Caramel and lightly toasted nuts give the malts some complexity, and fruit and hops round things out nicely. These notes all carry over into the taste, where the hops are actually more pronounced. Starts firm and malty, with more fruit and hops in the middle, and a dry, lingering finish. Nicely drinkable, though I would like the mouthfeel to be a bit heavier, so the flavors would linger more. This is a pleasant version of a style that I typically think of as middle-of-the-road OK.","BitteBier","Jun 24, 2007"

The aroma is a bit muted. Some malty, chocolate, cherry notes, but all very dulled. It tastes much like the aroma, but a bit more forceful here, in a pleasant way. Malty, with a nutty coffee and chocolate presence. But it also presents a nice fruitiness as well as it finishes with a hoppy cherry taste. Some slight hints of banana aftertaste.

There were hints of coffee, chocolate and nuts in the taste as well as a bitter punch to start off but all of those were drowned out by the caramel and malts. Fairly high carbonation smoothed it all out a bit by distracting the tongue. The aftertaste was equal parts sweet and bitter, but, again, poorly blended and overpowering. A pretty simple beer with some promise, if it could just be toned way down.","greebsnarf","Sep 02, 2006"

Taste is good, but its hard to find anything about it that really sets it apart from other browns.

First taste was that of hops, bitter on the back of the tongue moving to a carmel malt taste. The hops(as you can see I can't get over) seemed to overpower what I thought was going to be a great Brown. The mouth feel was lighter then that of a Brittish Brown, not one bit creamy.

The taste really surprised me because i dont normally expect much complexity or layers in a brown ale but this one is definately not your average brown ale. The taste starts with a caramel malt flavor as well as some dark fruit flavors maybe prunes, currants, grapes or raisins as well as a hint of roasted coffee and ends with a bittersweet dark chocolate like finish that lingers in your mouth for a few seconds.

I don't know if it was a bad bottle or what, but it had a funky blue cheese smell to it. I love ripened cheeses, but not when they are eminating from my beer. It was about as attractive as a big piece of spinach stuck in between a woman's teeth. Luckily this beer had some redeeming flavor to combat the off-putting aroma. The flavor is sweet wiht alcohol flavors up front followed by a soft, smoky, and almost Belgian malty flavor. That blue cheese did creep into the flavor a bit though. Too bad.

4,10.5,4,4,4,4,4,"This beer poured a mahogany brown color that when held to the light it showed hues of ruby. It was crystal clear and well carbonated. The head that was produced was a mix of light tan and beige colors, fairly thick, dense and fluffy at first pour, then fell to just a ring on the edges that seemed to be fairly thick as well. The lace that was produced was a sheety consistency. The aromas that came from the glass started off with a plum/berry fruit like aroma mixed in with a sweet malt, then it dried out and scents of ash, cocoa powder and some roasted coffee became noticeable, it finished with a hint of grain on the end. The flavors that I tasted began with roasted malt with tads of sweetness, in the middle it waived with some dry ash and sweet fruit, close to the finish cocoa powder, light hops and coffee and it finished with a barky leafy grain taste. (Hard to explain, as it warmed the finish became a mix of the 3). The after taste was of roasted malt and light hops. The body was on the medium side. This is a clean crisp, complex and at times dry beer. As it warmed the flavors became more pronounced and complex. They melded together well and was a pleasure to drink.","Jarod","Nov 12, 2003"

A thick, somewhat sticky lace eventually forms on the surface and also lingers for quite a while. The beer pours a clear dark copper brown and has a medium body with not too much carbonation. The aroma is nice and malty sweet with notes of caramel and chocolate. Hops are in the aroma also, but are much more restrained. There is a smooth malty start in which the caramel and chocolate notes from the aroma are quickly noticeable on the pallet. Some roastiness is also noticeable towards the end. Again, hops are fairly subdued, but noticeable in the finish, yet the malt base is still strong with a smooth end. The lingering aftertaste is of both hops and roasted malt notes.

Aroma consists of pine cone like hops and a slightly burnt malt character. The two aromas blend fairly well, to form an overall pleasant aroma. The taste is a bit worn by the age, but I can still detect a slightly vinous grap character blended with a mild chocolate/coffe tone and the hop bitterness works well together.

3.48,-3.9,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"One of the first things that struck me about this brown ale was that it looked almost predominantly red, rather than brown. The actual combination of these two colors makes for a rather impressive appearance, along with the small but consistent head. A sweet, alcoholic odor mixed with a subtle roasted fragrance. The same sweetness, coupled with a caramel or toffee flavor comprised this ale's particularly complex taste. Bitter hints were also present, along with a bit of a yeasty or grainy taste towards the end. This ale could have been fuller, however, especially to complement the more complex taste. Nothing beyond average in the mouthfeel of this beer, unfortunately. Overall, the Brooklyn Brown Ale had a good, sweet, somewhat roasted taste that allows for a continuously pleasurable drinking expereince.

Certainly smells like a well-hopped beer, I'm getting hints of earthy and leafy hops. Chocolate malt makes itself known quickly, combining very well with the hops. A bit of grainy malt character is detectable under all of this. As for the flavors, it looks like we've got a winner in this department too. Hops are really leafy throughout, hitting their peak in the middle of the palate. Chocolate malt is the major player on the sweetness side, making itself known best at the front and back. Rind-like hop bitterness balances things out. Crisp, dry finish. Nice medium body, but flavorful. Not much complexity, but this is a good, solid beer that will satisfy your palate well.

Starts with a sweet caramel malt, develops some chocolatey notes mid-palate, then gives way to a satisfyingly bitter hop finish.

The flavor displays a gently fruity, lightly toasty, and toffee-like malt that's well backed by bitterness and a light piney hop flavor. The finish is dry and lingering with hop bitterness, chocolatey maltiness, a soft roastiness and a light nuttiness reminiscent of wanut or almond.
