4.54,18.5,4.75,4.5,4.5,4.75,4.5,"Is this a typical brown ale? No. It is rather an extrapolation of the style. I must admit myself suspicious of the term 'double' applied to a brown ale, but this certainly justifies the term. It remains Brown Ale-like, and does not spread into the real of porter or strong ale. Nutty, malty, gorgeous. Yum.","Czequershuus","Mar 20, 2015"
4.25,11,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Appearance: Brilliant mahogany, chestnut, 2” light tan tinted white foam cap dissipates to thick film, excellent lace. Smell: aniseed, thick dark bread, fruit cake, faint chocolate. Taste: Starts rich and malty and then dries out and gets espresso coffee astringent and lingers in the finish. Mouthfeel: Creamy smooth with an astringent background that rises in the after taste. Medium carbonation to medium low – carbonation is very fine, very soft and very well done. Medium full body.","pat61","Mar 20, 2015"

4.02,5,4,3.75,4.25,3.75,4,"Pours a clear, brown producing 2 fingers of frothy, moderately lasting, tan head that leaves a nice sheet like coating of lace. Aroma is malt forward as expected with nice floral hop presence, dark, toasty bready malt,  roast & nuts with bittersweet chocolate. Taste is deeply malty, toasted pumpernickel with roasted nuts, bittersweet chocolate & brown sugar hints with an unprecedented, brown ale hop bitterness. Finish is toasted maltiness, bittersweet in a wash of pepper. Afrertaste is an even more bitter version of the finish with a heavy taste of char. Mouthfeel is medium-heavy bodied with moderate carbonation, a little prickly, nicely thick & chewy but creamy. Totally out of character with brown ales due to the hoppy profile I feel it deserves a style designation all it\'s own. Touche\' Clown Shoes!","mothmanscott","Mar 06, 2015"

It pours nicely with a frothy head that leaves no lacing. I didn't get much aroma from it - a bit of burnt sugar and faint hops. However, when this beer hits your taste buds, it comes into its own. There is plenty of chocolate and dark roast coffee, with a lovely hop finish. Carbonation is minimal, which lends an extra level of quaffability to this brew. I'll be seeking out more product from this brewery!","Bunman3","Feb 01, 2015"

3.84,0.3,3.5,3.75,4,3.75,3.75,"Bomber poured into a mason jar mug. A dark reddish cloudy root beer brown with a light ring of beige bubbles rimming the glass. I don't mind the label either. Aroma of dark lightly roasted malts with some bitter baker's chocolate, sarsaparilla-like herbs and spices, cherry, brittle toffee, instant coffee crystals with whitener, and faint floral hops. I've seen better looking beers but the aroma is solid. I dig the notion of a "double brown" and this does deliver some rich nutty malts roughly congruent with the nose ... Plus some light molasses, raisin, malted milk candy and a wee bit of drupe fruit perhaps. Rather sweet up front but gets bitter during the tail end, albeit not harshly so. Floral hops combine with dark malts to yield a tobacco-like vibe, sweet pipe tobacco as opposed to cigar. Sturdy medium-heavy body with more carbonation than expected but this does not detract. Finish is bitter chocolate plus lightly resinous hops, which oddly enough works quite well. I am an inveterate Clown Shoes imbiber and this is an essential part of the canon. Hits most or all of the different dark malt notes without going overboard on the roasted elements like a stout might, and has a more hefty body and flavor than do lesser brown ales.","CalgaryFMC","Oct 18, 2014"

The first beer from Clown Shoes I bought was this for nothing other than the artwork on the bottle but I became a big fan. The appearance is a dark brown with an off white head which sticks a bit to the side of the glass. The smell was very sweet with hints of chocolate and walnuts coming through. The taste was more subtle with roasted malt and barley coming through with a nice clean finish. The only thing I'm not a giant fan of is it's a little thin but easily overlooked. I love this beer because it's the beer that got me into Clown Shoes as a whole.","WhiteHillsStore","May 04, 2014"

4.03,5.2,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Overall I thought this was a pretty good beer, and very nice example of a hoppy brown ale, it had pretty much everything that I look for in the style and it kind of reminded me of Short's Good Humans, which is a good thing. This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, clean, not too filing and the taste did a good job at holding my attention, I would have no problem drinking a bomber to myself and if I was really in the mood for this style I could see myself drinking a couple of bottles without getting tired of it. What I liked the most about this beer beer was the balance, it was pretty much prefect and no aspect was too overpowering. What I liked the least about this beer was that the nutty flavor didn't come through a little more, but it wasn't that big of a deal, but I think it would make it a slightly better beer. I would buy this beer again, It wouldn't be something I buy a lot of but having a bottle in the fridge for when I'm in the mood for a hoppy brown ale would be a good thing. I would recommend this to anyone who doesn't mind their Brown Ales on the hoppier side. All in all I was happy with this beer, it was just what I wanted it to be and I thought it was pretty enjoyable. Good job Clown Shoes, this beer was just what I needed, keep up the good work.","StoutHunter","Nov 06, 2013"

Aroma has herbal and citric hop notes, with bready caramelized sugars, and mild yeast dough like character. Flavor upfront herbal, pine, and citric bitterness coats the palate and doesn't really let up much, big imperial brown ale for sure. A bit muddled especially as I poured the last of the beer in, this beer is dry and would benefit from a touch more malt base. Mouthfeel is medium bodied slightly slick with hop oils, well deserving dry finish from the boat loads of hops these guys threw into this brew. Overall I wanted it to love it since the label is top notch, but it's just okay for me this go around.","WVbeergeek","Oct 19, 2013"

Poured with a thick, dense, off-white foam that slowly reduced to a thick cap that leaves a ladder of sticky lacings on the glass. Roasted malt and powdery dark chocolate aromas with floral hop, nutty, and roasted coffee notes. Feel is on the heavier end. Big malty feel that's bolstered by rich, soft, carbonation from front to back. Roasted and dark caramel malt flavors up front. Dark chocolate and floral hop flavors build through the middle and transition to roasted coffee and pine hop bitterness to the end. Finished with dark roasted malt, earthy floral and pine hop bitterness. This takes a fairly unextraordinary style and reinvents into something worthwhile. Not the first time I've had this and not the last. Hope it gets switched to the 12oz format like other Clown Shoes offerings.","IronLover","Oct 11, 2013"

Damn nice balance and complexity of hop and dark malt flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy, crisp, and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent hoppy brown ale! All around great balance and complexity of hop and dark malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink.

The aforementioned triumvirate of dark chocolate/coffee/toffee hits you in sequential order, each of them permeated by a sweet caramel tinge that many others have noted. The nuttiness found in the aroma is present throughout the entire brew, and it reminds me of a pecan at times in the way it complements the overall creaminess of the beer. As the beer warms, a spicy hop presence becomes increasingly notable, much like the Tramp Stamp ale. Body is actually pretty light, and there's little to no carbonation to offer a bite on the tongue. Finishes incredibly smooth with a slightly "wet" mouthfeel; I could drink this all night.","Tomhet","Dec 31, 2012"

Smells really nice. Very fruity and hay like, almost reminds me of a well hopped pilsener oddly enough. Slight "brown" aroma as well. Toasty and roasty. A bit of cold press coffee there. Hops at the vanguard. Citrus, floral and grassy. Well defined. Fruit contribution seems to come from the yeast. Subtle apple/pear esters. The "brown" is mellow. Faintly roasty. Shit, I've had black IPA that was roastier than this beer. There is a caramel character in there that's adds a nice layer to the hops. Transitions into a wonderful bitter, estery finish. Great body, carbonation and mouthfeel. Just perfect. This is one hoppy brown ale and I'm glad I picked it up.

The flavor follows with a neat marriage of sweet chocolate malt and funky cabbage-pine hop bite. Really interesting and tasty with a creamy feel, medium bodied with subtle carbonation.

The mouth feel is rather light and dull, but the carbonation is very present. The flavor is mild overall, sweet, bitter when it hits the sides of your mouth and it fills your tongue with roasted coffee bean (mildly) roasted malts, very mild hops.

Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt and nutty aromas. Taste is very much the same with a medium amount of bitterness with each sip. This beer has a very high level of carbonation that is just too much. Overall, this is a pretty average beer as it stands and I think there may be a slight infection issue with the huge head and extreme carbonation that this particular bottle has.","UCLABrewN84","May 28, 2012"

The taste brings in more of the same, though the coffee is a bit more powerful, the cocoa is darker, and the grass has morphed into some earthy cilantro-like greens. The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a somewhat creamy feel. Overall, a very nice brown, something I could easily see reaching for again.","TMoney2591","Jan 30, 2012"

It has a chocolate and coffee aroma with a good dose of citrus, grass and perfume. It's pretty full bodied, super silky and smooth. The finish is soft and delicate. It leaves the mouth feeling almost a little tingly, like after eating a mint. It has a nice, full, well-blended, well-balanced flavor. It's very chocolatey with some dark roast coffee. The hops provide just enough bitterness to zip the taste up and keep me coming back for another sip. It tastes a little wooden, but not resiny. There's a hint of lemon peel. There seems to be a hint of mint at the finish. Wow, I don't know if I've ever had a brown ale like this before. This is straight-up delicious.

Smooth, mellow carbonation, rich, creamy profile with each sip having to be savored time, and time again.

Pours a medium brown color with a thin light tan head that quickly dissipates leaving little lacing. A nice mix in the aroma; coffee, roasted malt, and citrus hops are all present. Definitely a solid hop presence, making for a very inviting American Brown. Aroma lends itself nicely the flavor, with a sweet malt backbone supporting the delicious citrus flavors from the hops. Rather light mouthfeel, and seems pretty highly attenuated. I really enjoyed this beer, as I am really warming to American Browns in general.

4.45,16.2,4,4,4.5,4.5,5,"O - this beer is beyond what I think of an average brown ale. It takes the drinkability of your brown ale, and adds in complexity, and layers of flavor. I would have this again in a heartbeat.","abecall98","Apr 18, 2010"

3.76,-1.8,4,3,4,4,4,"The beer is pretty hoppy. There are Columbus, Goldings, and Amarillo hops present. There is a spicy and herbal hop presence, with some estery bittering and grassy hop coming through as well. The spicy malt and caramel and slightly charred brown sugars add a bit of balance to this rather full bodied affair. There is a bit of ABV in the finish. The beer is not all that smooth, but it is much more than a prickly sipper of a beer, that's for sure. I'm also getting some crystal malts in the beer and brown sugars as the beer settles in a bit. This is a good beer with a rather limited distribution, for now.","albern","Mar 09, 2010"
4.05,5.7,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,"The balance is great and I could definitely drink a few of these. The sweet malt and hoppy taste blend together well and then fades at the end so as not to overpower your taste buds.","neophilus","Mar 05, 2010"
