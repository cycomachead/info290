Very smooth and pleasant beer to drink, nice roasted malt taste, not very high ABV but nice kick. Very good offering.","dukeandduke","Sunday at 07:55 PM"

4.25,14.9,,,,,,"Starts with a malty nose with more lightly roasted grains than chocolate with a hint of sweetness. Pours brilliant chestnut brown with a 1"" fluffy light tan head that dissipates to a thick film. The palate starts between caramel and chocolate over light roasted nuts moving more to chocolate then a hint of coffee before finishing with a lingering nutty chocolate finish. Very creamy with very fine soft carbonation with a medium body. Everything is very nicely balanced with out a trace of harshness. There are just enough hops on the finish to balance the malty sweetness of the beer.","pat61","Nov 04, 2014"

It's like they squeezed nuts to a max. You taste walnut, yadi yadi yada, and you get the earthiness of the shell and the bitterness of a walnut that has been juiced. Some dark German black bread quality adds to the earthiness and gives the body some stability. Nary any sweetness, which would actually undermine it's drinkability and strength.","orcrist_cleaver","Nov 02, 2014"

3.8,2.7,3.5,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Pint enjoyed on tap at the Grand Union Hotel in Fort Benton, MT. Arrived a dark reddish brown with a light film of creamy tan bubbles on the top. Aroma is robust, dark, and appropriately hopped, with some roasted peanut shells and a glimmer of hazelnut as well, dry cacao powder, light molasses, and brittle toffee all asserting themselves along with some earthy, slightly floral and grassy hops. A tinge of smoke? Palate is medium roast coffee melding with the nutty and sweet elements on the nose. Moderate body, just approaching thicker climes, with low to moderate carbonation and a notably hoppy finish, grass, earth, and vanilla perhaps. A smoky note emerges over time but remains low key. This is a solid take on an American brown, old world hops providing some bitterness to complement the roasted and nutty elements, although the sweetness is never defeated outright.","CalgaryFMC","Oct 13, 2014"

I brewed a clone of this beer a few years ago and even that was better than this is, and it takes a lot for my home-brews to impress me. Not labeling a date as either 'bottled on' or 'enjoy by' is a cardinal sin in my book. Although, due to the lack of malt flavor I suspect it wouldn't make a difference how fresh this beer is. However, as always I would give this beer another chance. Would I drink it again? Yes, if the head brewer handed me a pint.","JamesMN","Jul 23, 2014"

4,8.1,4,4,4,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 3/13/2014. Pours crystal clear deep reddish brown color with a 2 finger dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big caramel, chocolate, cocoa, toast, toffee, brown sugar, nuttiness, light roast, herbal, and toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and light earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, chocolate, cocoa, toast, toffee, brown sugar, nuttiness, light roast, herbal, and toasted earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, chocolate, cocoa, toast, toffee, brown sugar, light nuttiness, light roast, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and light earthy hop flavors; with great robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and fairly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice brown ale. All around good robustness and balance of dark/roasted malt and light earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jun 28, 2014"

3.74,1.1,4,3.75,3.5,4,4,"Poured a nice rich brown with a one finger tan head. It looks quite nice and inviting. Scents of bready malt, caramel, brown sugar and slight alcohol. A very sweet aroma for a brown ale, high in the sugary aromas but still with a nice hit of bready malt. The alcohol was surprising, but overall not a bad aroma profile. Flavor begins with caramel, toffee and brown sugar flavors that carry throughout. In the middle undertones of nuttiness and toasted malt appear which are nice, but not as apparent as they should be in a brown ale. The finish is sweet, but with a more overt presence of the nutty and toasted flavors as well. Aftertaste is nutty and toasted malt. A very sweet flavor profile for a brown ale, quite malty but not as bready, nutty and toasty as I like. Still not bad. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and stick with moderate carbonation. It's a good feel that compliments the malty nature of the flavor profile quite well. Pretty good. Overall this is a good American Brown Ale. It's got a nice bready, malty nose and a sweet, malty flavor profile and mouthfeel that works in the flavor's favor. I just wish there was a touch more toasted malt and nut-like flavors, but otherwise it's a solid brown.","Auraan","Mar 28, 2014"

The smell suffers as it lacks hops and spices to be very aromatic, but if one suffers over another, the taste better be there for me. Mouthfeel is nice and hearty, and leaves a crispness on the tongue -- not at all bitter to my tastebuds.","ThisLadyLovesBeer","Jan 17, 2014"

The aroma is of dark malts with a hint of caramel and cocoa. The taste is actually even better than the aroma, which was a nutty malt, coffee, chocolate and caramel. Very pleasant and goes down easy. No bitter finish for this one. One of my favorite brown ales.","BeerWithMike","Jan 08, 2014"

3.2,-13.5,3.75,3,3.25,3.5,3,"Pours out really dark brown/black in the light. Has a nice two-finger, beige head with good retention and some nice lacing. Smell is LOTS of malty sweetness with caramel, dark malts, from the nose with really no hop presence that I can find in the nose. This smells quite unbalanced but not bad. Taste is fairly sweet and I can get everything I could smell from the nose but there is really no hop presence that I find at all to balance anything out. Just a little too sweet for the style IMHO. Mouthfeel is decently thick for the style or even more so than I expected but I like a thicker beer. Overall this beer just seems really unbalanced for the style. It's possible this is an older bottle and the hops have faded but no date means no way to tell. Brewers date your beers please. Just not the greatest beer for the money.","NeedBeerHere","Jan 05, 2014"

I can’t believe how surprised I am at how much I like this beer…I guess either the sort-of gimmicky label or its wide availability gave me the impression that it wouldn’t that good.

Newcastle is the standard brown ale in most American bars (I can only imagine its presence in England), but I've started to see Moose Drool at least offered as a second option at larger bars or replace Newcastle altogether. It's a much better beer. Medium body that's almost creamy and a nice nutty profile to it make it a much richer option for the same price.

Smell is of toasted malt, vanilla bean, and some nutty aromas. Taste is of toasted malt, toasted nuts, and vanilla bean on the finish. There is a mild roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel but it's a bit thin body wise.

This beer had good drinkability, I could drink a couple of these in a sitting since the flavor held my attention and it goes down really smooth. What I liked most about this beer was the aroma and flavor they were both spot on for a Brown Ale. What I liked least about this beer was the prickly carbonation and the lackluster head, if those were tweaked this would be a great beer. I could see buying this again when looking for a good brown ale, and I would like to try ordering this with a meal. If Brown Ales are your thing, then this beer is for sure worth a try. This was another good beer from Big Sky, they are really showing me that they are one solid brewery and I am interested to try more stuff from then, I wonder what some of their bigger beers are like. Good job guys, this is one proper American Brown Ale.","StoutHunter","Mar 01, 2012"

A sweet and toasty nose of malts greets you before notes of chocolate, coco, and light amounts of caramel become noticeable. A strong malty presence is out front, followed by a slight hoppiness that provides good balance. Hints of chocolate syrup, toffee, nuts, and a little spice play together nicely in a medium body with very little carbonation. A pretty good American attempt and an English brown ale.","phishsihq","Jan 25, 2012"

4.02,8.6,4,4.5,4,4,3.5,"Drool pours a dark ruby-tinged brownish amber, with a gigantic, long lasting, creamy tan head. My first thoughts when smelling the beer is of dark chocolate, almost like bittersweet chocolate. Chocolate gives way to some hints of raisin and plum. Taste is surprisingly fruity, chased by delicious notes of toffee malt sweetness. Chocolate from the nose fails to really stand out, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Light hop bitterness finishes. Medium body and decent carbonation, maybe a little bit on the high side. Over all this is a pretty solid example of the amber style, and at 5.3% ABV, it's also pretty close to being sessionable.","eclaycamp","May 15, 2011"

3.86,4.3,4,3,4,3,5,"Poured into my Newcastle Geordie Schooner glass - light beige head quickly fades atop a ridiculously crystal clear brown ale...hints of red glow through in the color. Smells nutty with some dark fruit; caramel and sweetness as well. Taste is very smooth and creamy...light chocolate, caramel and almost like sweet molasses up front. Flavors of roasted and black malts work their way into the palate as the taste evolves, accompanied by a nice hop bitterness to battle the sweetness. I like a little heavier of a mouthfeel than this offers, but the lighter feel is not surprising considering the crystal appearance. While I'm sitting here enjoying this beer inside during the winter, I can just as easily imagine this being equally as refreshing outside on a hot summer day.","jimbus","Jan 29, 2011"

The flavor starts with the same vinous note mixed with papery oxidation. Toward the end, a hint of sweet caramel tries to ride in on a mild hop bitterness. Light, with lots of carbonation and a very dry, almost watery finish. Easy enough to drink, but there are some major problems with this bottle.

This brown ale leans a little more to the malty side with moderatley strong cocoa and bready malt flavors. Faint floral hops pop in towards the end. The finish is barely bitter with a light astringency, and a pinch of lactic tang. Moderatley carbonated with a medium light body.

There are better browns out there, to be sure, but this is a quality example of the style. Again, it was part of a mixed 12 pack and probably the best of the bunch (it's fighting with the IPA for tops), but I expected just a little bit more out of this one. Being that Montana has cold, cold winters, I was figuring on a more imperial level out of this one, but I'm not complaining. It was darn tasty and recommended to my beer brethren.

A catchy name, good marketing, and being new to Michigan probably help with sales. It's a nice option in a can, though with more and more micros offering cans it's not as big a deal.

Availability is my only complaint. It is sold over most of the northern midwest and in some of the southwest. However this is mostly bottles. I spent two summers in Bozeman, MT and this became my favorite drink out there. It goes perfect with some pizza for dinner, fly fishing, or just floating down the Madison. I'd also recommend going to a hot springs that allows you to bring bottles and enjoy one during a soak.

The smell was mild but present including a sweet aroma of nuts and chocolate. The taste was not nearly as impressive as the look, however, as the nutty aroma was replaced by a more burnt taste and bitterness. The mouthfeel was watery and had considerable carbonation. I probably should have just finished this beer while it was cold, but I let it warm a bit and that was my mistake. I then found this beer to reveal more of a tobacco taste and that was it for me. I finished about half of this beer and had to stop. To some this review may sound unfair of this beer, but I haven't had to pour a half a beer down the drain (voluntarily) in a long, long time. In the end, I found the name of this beer quite fitting.

Nice malt structure in the nose with some touches of grain and hops. Some sweetness about the nose. Nice thick mouthfeel is like a mild syrup. The attack is mostly sweet malt flavors, but there is a strong presence of grain. Some sweetness manages to cover the flavor and leave me describing it as sweet.

Doesn't taste like a traditional brown, there is the malt but there is some roast and some hop bitterness that makes for a crisp finish. Less malt complexity than I expected, but good tasting, crisp, nice session beer no doubt. Medium bodied with lovely medium carbonation that hits the spot, slightly silky feel. Very drinkable for a brown, again, great candidate for a session beer, and good to have this in cans. Surprisingly refreshing since it well avoids cloying. Good stuff.","vacax","Sep 28, 2009"

Fits well with my philosophy that if you can see through it, it ain't beer. Nice, slightly smokey flavor, but not an annoying aftertaste. Regarding the smokey flavor, my true Montana story: Playing cards at a friend's house, whose inlaw's were Staunch Baptists (a preacher) and death on alcohol in any form. To avoid offending them, we slipped Drool into Coke cans so we could surrupticiously imbibe. (By the way, my friend was known to chew upon occasion.) While our attention was focused away, his dad picked up the coke can and took a drink. (We both saw, but had no opportunity to intervene.)

Smells of dark chocolate, coffee, malts and nuts and is typical of other browns, albeit a little more aromatic and bold, which is a plus for me in regards to this style. Tastes of caramel, some syrupy sugars and a good balance of malts and hops. Drinkability is superb, and is deceptively light-bodied, almost feeling thicker than it really is, a fact I attribute to it's tastiness. I haven't tried a brown ale in a while because I became disappointed with the somewhat weak feel common to many brews of the style. This one bucks that trend.

3.93,6.2,3.5,3,4.5,4,4,"The beer poured a deep, dark mahogany color, just a little too light to be classified as black. I could tell that the beer had a nice body by the way it poured; it came out of the bottle in a nice thick stream. The head of the beer came up to be about a half an inch thick, keeping its form for about a minute. It had a luscious tan color and a rich consistency. After a minute of keeping its form, the head eventually dissipated to a thin film in the glass. The beer smelled of strong bittering hops, toasted caramel malts, two-row barley malts, molasses, and brown sugar. Overall, it was an inviting smell, a little bitter at first, but once the nose acclimates, it has a wonderful smell. The smell, at first, made me a little uneasy about the beer, but once I tasted it, my problems were resolved. The smell had a bit of an off aroma to it; perhaps it was the bittering hops. The taste did not reflect the initial smells; in fact the beer tasted almost sweet. The toasted malts came out nicely, as did the molasses and brown sugar. The hops played a nice role initially in balancing out the brew so it did not become overwhelmingly sweet on the tongue. The aftertaste is particularly pleasant; it is very reminiscent of sweet dark bread. This taste holds true for about two thirds of the glass, when the brew turns a little hoppier. At this point, the beer becomes a little bitterer, and different malt flavors come to the forefront on the tongue, namely caramel malts. The mouth feel remains the same, staying thick but smooth, almost chewy. At the end of the glass, some of the flavors from the beginning come back, leaving the finish smooth and sweet.","KingNoonan","Sep 13, 2006"

3.39,-8.4,3,4,3.5,3.5,2.5,"Moose Drool Brown Ale is a very good bridge between a brown ale and a stout. Its appearance is that of a dark brown, like that of fine antique furnature. The beer has the bitterness in the after taste that is familiar with a stout, however it has the more complex presentation of flavours that comes from a brown ale. Think of it as a black and tan, but as one beer. The bitterness in the after taste is delightful at first, but as I got closer to the bottom the glass, it became more and more prevelant and almost undesireable to drink.

Fruity on the nose, cherries and plums, a bit of pineapple and plenty of friendship cake. Carbonation reminds me of fizzy soda. Tangy, a bit tart, but ultimately rather sweet and maybe a bit uninteristeng to me. I've had this beer numerous times on draught and in bottles, but I'm tasting something new this time. Bitterness is very well restrained, but more prominent than I remember, which is a good thing, as this beer has always struck me as sweet and one-dimensional in the past. Mouthfeel is light but smooth, and works well with the tanginess. For whatever reason (is this an old bottle?) this beer seems to have come into its own, either the recipe and brewing process has been stableized and become more consistent or I'm just in the mood for a tasty British style brown ale this morning, but this is really working for me. Not my favorite in the style (I certainly have other favorite brown ales on either side of the style spectrum) and I know it ain't right to hold a grudge forever (Moose Drool had a Fat Tire-like word of mouth a number of years back, causing me some consternation at retail), so I'll have to give Moose Drool credit where credit is due: it's a solid, tasty brew.","Chaz","Jul 27, 2006"

The palate opens up with zesty carbonation and a slight brown ale sourness, then moves to a metallic tinge and then a sustained grainy note that hangs onto the tongue for a long finish.

Partially buried are hazelnut and caramel. Tastes wet sweet with a dry chocolate malt and a hint of sourish grains...almost caramel-like. Some hop bitter comes across as a nice grassy counterpoint to the chocolate and sweet. Aftertaste is dry chocolate that persists evenly for a lo-oong time.

3.88,4.9,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Moose Drool's clear, very deep mahogany body reveals glowing ruby higlights when held to the light. Its creamy, light tan head drops steadily; but it does leave some minor lace about the glass. In the nose, malt dominates with a lightly cocoaish and toffee-like character. Some mild yeasty fruitiness lends it a bit more character; and a swirl of floral and perfumey hops rounds it out. Smooth and lightly creamy across the palate, it's medium-light body and restrained carbonation level lend to it's malty character and help to boost its drinkability. All that the nose suggests and more is found in the flavor. It's maltiness is subtly toasty and toffee-ish with a sprinkle of cocoa powder. The yeasty fruitiness works its way through mid-palate; and then a cusp of roastiness and some mild grassy and floral hops appear in the finish. It's delicate, and therefore lightly balanced by a restrained bitterness. It finishes dry with some lingering malt and floral hops. Very nice! This is a surprisingly satisfying and drinkable beer that probably deserves more attention for its flavor than it gets for its name and aluminum bottle!","NeroFiddled","Dec 25, 2004"

The body poured a deep brown that has reddish tints. The head is quality, thick and consistent. The odor is enticing, highly malty and very nutty. The overall mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, quite a delight. I really love the great subdued nut flavor, its not overwhelming at all. Surprisingly, it was not dry at all in the finish, considering you usually get that feeling with a nutty tone. A high quality offering and certainly recommended.","Hhawk06","Dec 08, 2004"

The aroma ingratiates itself immediately after popping the bottle cap, and it's wonderful: sweet, roasty, with maple syrup and nut flavors. The taste of the beer contains all these elements, plus a light smokiness and some brown sugar flavors. The beer is much more robust than your traditional brown ales and even approaches American doppelbock territory, but in the end it is contained by a stern harness that keeps all the flavors in check. In fact, a little more blossoming flavor would be welcome here, as the end result is squeaky clean, even a bit watery. Still, the beer's big flavors are present without being cloying or overwhelming, and drinkability is high. A very pleasing beer and one of the best American browns to have wide availability.","Thrasher","Nov 02, 2004"

It is not too thick in the mouth and goes down quite smooth.

Is the bars method of cleaning the glasses to blame? It is a pleasant beer to look at nevertheless. The aromas are solid in potency, sweet maltiness upfront with a wall of hops to finish the nose, ends clean. Inviting enough, more explanatory than welcoming. The palate displays more depth, chocolate and roasted malts upfront, idle sweetness in the middle that fades quickly and a slight hops bitterness moves in but the stay is brief as well because roasty chocolate malts end the taste nicely. The afterglow is very long and pleasant with maltiness dominating. This is a well-made brown ale, a catchy name doesnt help sales either! Medium in body with perfect caressing carbonation, the mouthfeel is ordinary but admirable. This is a highly drinkable beer. Perfect to session with, low enough abv, a nice match with steak or stew. Well worth a quaff particularly if you enjoy a non-hoppy brown ale... like I do.","bditty187","Jan 19, 2004"

The finish is bitter, with some chocolate and slight grain. There's a cheesy, not very pleasant aftertaste. This is a strange brew. It's bitter, but not quite a good bitter.

Sweet malty nuttiness hits the front of the tongue and gives way to fruity and a dry roastedness in the back of the mouth. Had a medium-light body with a slickness to the palate.

I expect a good smooth feel to a brown with nut like flavors, but this had to much hop and tang for this style. Thats just me I guess.

4.92,33,4.5,5,5,4.5,5,"the first time I tried this I was on vacation in West Yellowstone 1999. I had finished snowmobiling about 300mi and ready to start the evening with my wife dining out. We tried a number of different local beers before I was ""introduced"" to Moose Drool. It was love at first sight/smell/taste. I don't know if I have had a better Brown Ale since. The appearance was of a warm maple syrup coming out of the tap. The smell consisted of fresh cracked walnuts and toasted coconut. I would liken the drinkability to sitting down at home to a good movie with say, a bag of doritos. Half way through the movie you look down and all the chips are gone, you pause the movie and search for more. This goes hand in hand with mouthfeel. I don't particularly like hops showing up at the end of a smooth consistent beer. Nailing my olfactory senses in the face is inconsistant with the overall story would humiliate the beer. This beer doesn't dissapoint. The conversion of these storylines ends in a happy ending. This was among the last beers I enjoyed that night. I thought my taste buds were swayed by the previous enjoyment of the evenings beers. I confirmed my enthusiam and review of this beer the next two nights just to make sure my assesments were correct. They were. I do have to say that 400 mi and packaging does indeed make a difference. We recieved a shipment of MooseDrool, Slow Elk and Powder Hound (all from the same brewery) at our local beeraceutical store.

The malt profile consists of lightly toasted malts, generic caramel malt sweetness, and subtle roasted notes.  The hop bitterness is a touch shy of balancing malt sweetness, and leaves this brew a bit sweet overall.  There aren't any surprises in the sweet and lightly roasted finish.

Not a strong flavor but the hops are evident in taste and the dry finish.  Malt noted in sweetness and slight richness.  Medium to thin mouthfeel with moderate carbonation.
