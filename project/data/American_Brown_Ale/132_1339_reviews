"Big hazelnut and banana bread smell taste as you were drinking a thin hazelnut coffee very good"
""
""
"Too hazelnut forward and watery on the down swing. A little too sweet as well. Just not to my liking as much as it is to the rest of the bell curve."
""
""
""
""
""
"Very nutty and smooth. Very good brew!"
""
""
""
""
"Medium dark beer with easy drinkability but has a bit of a sweet tone to it"
""
""
"More hazelnutty than expected. Not necessarily a bad thing, just unlike anything I've ever tried before! Light feeling and very drinkable. Definitely a dessert beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Unbelievable brown ale, achieves things in its class no other brown is trying...my all time favorite in the category. If you appreciate the flavor profile, it won't disappoint!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Something tastes like vanilla extract towards the end. A tad too sweet and could use a little more carbonation. Now that I'm done nitpicking have to say this is a great beer. I think most beer lovers of any style could appreciate this one. You could drink this year round. At $14 for a six pack it's pretty steep but I'll definately be buying this again. Easily one of my favorite beers now."
""
"Hazelnuts? Where? Other than that, it's just an okay Brown Ale. Wouldn't bang again!"
"Nice nutty smell but the body is weak and the flavor fades fast"

"Bottle of hazelnut nectar drank."
""
""
""
""
"Like breakfast in the night. Epic"
""
"Drinks smooth is lightly carbonated and has a medium body."
""
"What ever.  j-eez.  Drink this beer at the end of a long night if you want to barf."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Weird (wet dog), smell...more like hazelnut after it warmed up, tea color with light body.  This was just OK for me?"
""
""
"Smooth finish. Goes surprisingly well with most foods."
"it was very delicious... recommended for sure"
""
""
""
""
"I am a fan of brown ale, so I approached this with a raised eyebrow. The pour was a good sign - nice tan head, not overly carbonated, so far so good. This is a great smelling beer, if you like hazelnut. The taste is very nice, reminiscent of hazelnut flavoured coffee, which so popular in the early 1990s. This is a good beer, for sure, but I'm not sure if it is any better than other traditional Browns like Moose Drool."
""
""
"It has a very good aroma"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Look- amber, typical for a brown ale, but nice hues. Smell- terrific, roasted hazelnut, such a warm aroma I love it. Taste- very good, light, not bitter, very malty, nice hazelnut flavor goes with aroma, real good stuff here. Feel- good, a tiny bit watery, some warmth, not extremely carbonated. Fairly refreshing for a brown ale. Try it for sure"
""
""
"Very smooth delicious beer.  I'm constantly surprised by the mellow aftertaste.  Many beers of similar color have bitter finishes, this one is much more polished."

"Pours a hazy deep mahogany in color with a good 1-2 finger foamy head that finally settles down to a 2mm or so layer. Some spotty lacing is seen when sipped that leaves some small 'circle' spots that stick to the glass. The aroma is of roasted malts, hazelnuts with some brown sugar. Bit more going on with the taste as the hazelnuts and malts are right up front with the sip followed by some light caramel malts. Lots of flavor and goes down easy.. A very tasty brew with lots of great flavor. medium-bodied with perfect carbonation. Great job Rogue!"
""
""
"Overall: Fantastic brew. Nice sweet flavors without being overpowering."
""
""
"Smooth & delicious beer! Can't get enough."
""
""
""

"Very smooth very tasty treat after dinner. Will be drinking again."
"one of my all time favorite brews. Have been to Portland twice for vacation and visited the brewery many, many times. Was lucky enough to catch a ""garage sale"" there where they were selling kegs and boxes of the 22oz bottles of various rogue ales for great discounts! I picked up 3 cases of the 22oz hazelnut brown nectar while there and was set for beer outside of bars all vacation. This is the beer that got me in to craft beer and my love for brown and nutty ales."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is outstanding! Very smooth and detect no alcohol.. A Tasty treat!"
"The taste is superb!! My all-time favorite Rogue!!"
""
""
""
"Very nice smell of hazelnuts, but too much carbonization, what often bothers me with Rogue ales."
""
""
""
"Some artificial flavors on the nose, but overall a tasty brew for a cold December evening"
""
""
""
"Overall, I say this was a decent American Brown Ale. I might have this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not the biggest fan of brown ales, but this one is different. Very smooth taste, nice thick khaki head and feels great on the tongue. The hazelnut aroma is intoxicating but the overall taste and finish of this beer lacks. Like i said overall good just nothing amazing."
"O: excellent beer. thoroughly infused in hazelnut but not too sugary or roasted. a robust and complex balance of flavors."
""
""
""
"I've heard so many things about this beer, all positive, all completely spot on! Amazing brown ale!"
""

"Drink-ability: a different take on the brown ale which was quite pleasant and quaffable. I would purchase again, though I wouldn’t go out of my way to find this beer."

"Pours an amzing deep reddish brown color with decent head and lacing, not a lot. Aroma is not exceptionally strong, but the nuttiness and male sweetness comes across quite well and subtlely. Taste has a bit of bitter kick to it, but balances pretty well with the roasted malts and nuts. Good brown ale that is drinkable and not overpowering."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O. Very good I enjoyed it very much. The down falls of this beer is that the mouth feel is very watery. Definitely try this one."

"05/09/12 On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. Tried as black & tan w/Rogue Chocolate Stout. Called a ""Snikers"" it had plenty of hazelnut. Not bad. Now I need to taste it au natural"

"O: Overall this beer wasn't bad, but it also wasn't anything too special. The smell was unbelievable, the taste was ok, but then I was let down by the mouthfeel. Maybe I'm used to drinking beers that are a bit more full bodied, or maybe I'm just not a huge fan of this beer; I don't know. I would drink it again, I just wouldn't be in any hurry to do so."
""
""
" An imperial Xmas version of this would be rocking. Some spices and higher abv... Rogue are you listening?"
""
""
""
""
""
"Had this beer on tap at the Yardhouse last night.Very light and easy to drink with a strong nutty taste to it.It had a fruit taste to it although it`s hard to identify what it is.I have to say I like it very much.I have had a couple of Rogue beers with mixed luck but I would say this is Second best to the Chocolate Stout.At 6.2ABV I would say its a Semi-functional beer.Give it a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a pretty tasty brew—sweet, but with a very mild hop character appropriate for a brown. That said, I feel like I could probably grab any decent brown, add a little hazelnut extract (which, as they state on the bottle, is how they get the hazelnut flavor) and end up with basically exactly this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: [3.75] There is no sense of alcohol (I would guess ~5.5% ABV).  This is a sweet and mellow bodied beer.  It has a unique flavor profile.  The flavor is robust and caramelized.  I really liked it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Smooth & light with a nutty, sweet taste"
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice smooth beer.  Tastes well...refreshing.  I would feel pretty good about giving this to my friends at a party.  It's not the best beer but will holds its ground."

"Clear mahogany pour with a one finger beige head with decent retention and nice lacing.  The nose is earthy and nutty with hints of caramel, brown sugar, hazelnut, and subtle cocoa.  The taste is toasty and nutty with hints of brown sugar, caramel, hazelnut, coffee, burnt toast, vanilla, tea, and subtle cocoa.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied with slightly elevated carbonation, but a bit thin for the style.  Overall, flavorful and very drinkable and worth revisiting."

"Haven't had this one in over five years so it's as good a time as any to return. Beer pours a dark color with a thin fizzy tan head. Nice nutty aroma, with hints of coffee. Sweet flavor on the palette but not too sweet, nutty caramel and toffee flavors. Smooth and unobtrusive mouth feel. An outstanding beer in an under appreciated style, would definitely recommend anytime, but especially as a lighter desert style beer."

"A personal favorite of mine. The appearance is a dark brown with a very thick head. The smell is great with sweet notes from the malt paired with the earthy tones from the hazelnuts. The taste is great, with such a delicious combination of sweetness and heavy nuttiness. It works well as both a desert beer as well as something to drink with spicy food. The mouthfeel is just the right thickness for me, has a big body but is not syrupy. Love this one."

"Pours a dark brown color with a one finger tan head and great lacing. Aroma is hazelnut and chocolate. Taste is a basically the same as the aroma. Great mouthfeel. This beer is a little on the sweet side, but overall, I really enjoyed this beer and will definitely buy again ."

"Overall-Very good beer thats perfect for those with a sweet tooth when it comes to beers. Personally this is too sweet for me to frequently have, but it certainly will be a top choice for a dessert beer in the future."
""
"Not a bad drop but expected more from a rogue beer after tasting their chocolate stout. Will definitely be buying more of their beers just not this one."

"If you like hazelnut coffe, or happen to like hazelnuts in general, this is your beer. It has a very clean looking appearance, medium brown color with a sweet and flavorful head. It is very nutty, the hazelnut flavor doesn't start or finish the beer, it is the beer. A very sweet beer, if that 's not your thing look elsewhere. Not bitter at any point, smooth, nutty & sweet throughout. This is an amazing beer, could have one with your oatmeal or your pork chops. Delicious."

"Dark amber in appearance with a short lived head. Nose of cooked sugar, RC Cola, dark fruit like figs and dates. Nutty flavors apparent, with roasted character and caramel notes up front. Hop flavor is muted and mild with a very clean bitterness showing up at the end. Thin bodied and mildly carbonated."

"Pours a nice brown with a thick head. I for the life of me can't detect any hazelnut smell at all. Although the taste is good for a brown ale I can't detect any hazelnut taste or flavor at all. Although it's highly rated here I'm not sure why. The big letdown for me is the lack of any hazelnut."

"Pours dark brown with a light tan head. Smells of Hazelnut, malt, hop, and light cocoa. tasting the beer the first thing that strikes me is the hazelnut and malt. It finishes with a hop and malt taste with a good mouth feel. A really good brown ale and I would buy again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Probably my second favorite brown ale. The hazelnut favor is very prominent both in the smell and on the pallet. It might be a little on the sweet side for some people, but it's a great brown. A nice honey flavor can also be detected. As always let it warm up a little from ice cold and it'll really blossom in flavor and smell. Love the mouthfeel also, a nice level of carbonation and a flavor that doesn't stay forever in your mouth."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: At first sip this one was surprisingly plain, but as it warmed up the flavour came out and I quite enjoyed it. I don't know that I will pick another up in a bottle, but I would like to give it a try on tap one day."

"Best finish, best brown ale. I have had it on tap and bottle. Rogue just makes great beers. The finish on this beer and aroma stick with you. Some brown ales can be quite bland. Not the case here. Smooth beer I could buy a keg of this daily drinker. The nut flavor is just right."

"Mouthfeel is light, slightly gritty. Overall, this is a pretty solid beer."
""
"12oz bottle poured into pint glass, aggressively. About 1-1.5"" head that didn't especially retain. Lacing there but on the minimal side. That might just be my opinion based on how hoppy the beers I have been drinking recently are. Dark brown, this ale is not translucent in the slightest. Didn't get much on the smell. However, the taste I remembered being not quite as delicious as this the last time I tried it. The hazelnut is coming through really nicely, and for not having enjoyed a beer this dark in a while, I am pretty happy with this one. Malty sweetness with the hazelnut flavor is just divine, and its backed by a nice hop presence. Carbonation was meh, no freshness date on this bottle, probably the only drawback to Rogue. A great ale. Can see why it is so popular"

"The taste was extremely pleasant. A later of sweet coffee/hazelnut/vanilla with a touch of caramel. None of which were overpowering. However, for a brown ale the body was a bit thin."

"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was its feel and drinkability. While the aroma and flavoring were both nicely inclusive, rich in depth, and agreeable, what really stood out was how quickly it disappeared from our glasses. All of the notes you would expect to be there are easily found, with sweet and sour brown malts, chocolate roast, and rich hazelnut extract. These are found repeatedly across the spectrums of both aroma and taste, and are consistent throughout the tasting. Then the slurp hits you. It is velour, popping like cotton, pulling each sip further down into bubbly ease and happiness. This helps to make up for slightly lesser explosiveness in the aforementioned arenas, keeping it flowing and extremely drinkable. This is a great, easy beer for the style, and one we’ve really enjoyed."

"This is a very distinctive brown ale and will appeal to anyone who likes sweeter beers."
""
"The deep ruby brown brew carried hints of a buttery nuttiness on the nose that followed into the flavor. This was a simple full flavored beer that melted on the palate rather than attack it. Rogue created a rich and rewarding Brown Ale that mixed perfectly with the toasted buttery Hazelnut flavors. There is nothing huge or complicated about it, but it is a smooth and wonderful concoction that earns the right to be call itself a Nectar."
""
""
""
""
""
"Hops are relatively low... well, basically nonexistent, actually. That's fine, though, as I don't think they'd add much here. The body doesn't quite match the flavors - I'd like things to be a bit thicker, but maybe I'm asking for too much from a 6.2% ABV brown ale. Not a bad beer, but not a very good one, either. Even minus the oxidation, the flavors weren't working for me the way they seem to be for others. Would've liked a touch more hazelnut and a bit more sweetness. I'd like to try it again, unoxidized, but I won't be rushing to get another."
"Overall: I didn't really know what to expect from this one. it had a good idea, but i am not the biggest rogue fan. turns out its pretty decent. wish there was more roasty malts and less coffee"
""
"Overall: A very tasty and drinkable brown ale here from Rogue. A lot of their stuff seems to be hit or miss, but this is one worth trying."

"Overall: A nice quaff that utilizes molasses, bready, and hazelnut flavors to deliver a very drinkable and delicious drink. An interesting beer to pair with food because of nutty/sweet/bready flavors."
"Taste wise, though, it starts out sweet, nutty, with a taste of honey, but turns bitter more like an ESB than I would care to have with such a malty start. There is a little puckering of the tongue at this for mouthfeel, but overall it doesn't suit my tastes."

"A winter seasonal with 180 calories per bottle and 6% ABV. 2011 & 2012 Gold Metal Winner at the Americas Beer Festival under the Specialty Beer Category. I really enjoyed the color, the brown ale style, and the compliment of the hazelnut flavor. This would be the first I tried with the hazelnut flavor and had mixed opinion at first, but after trying I would highly recommend and definitely keep my eye-out to try again. This is a great beer to keep an eye out for as a winter seasonal. I would highly recommend and buy again."
""

"Leftover bottle from NHC award banquet. Pours clear brownish amber with nice head & foam that clings to glass. Smells & tastes of hazelnut. That much is nailed. Tastes has add'l sweet malt character. Very nutty with even bitterness. Feels about light to medium. Overall, an excellent spice, or whatever, kind of beer you classify this. Great tasting and well balanced all around."

"D- Outside of the initial appearance, this beer has it all! It is full flavored and very well balanced with the hazelnut flavor at just the right amount, the alcohol is essentially non-existent, and is so sleek on the palate. I will most definitely purchase this again and highly recommend this beer! Rouge has put their spin on the brown ale style and more than hit a home run with this!"

"Overall, I'm starting to think i must not like Brown Ales in general. I tasted the same gross ""green"" taste in BBC Nut Brown Ale, Newcastle is very average, and I can't remember having any others."

"T- First strikes me with balanced malt and the sweetness of the caramel, with just a hint of earth. Nice woody after taste. Mid palate there is nice dark fruit, fig or plum? After my first couple of sips I thought it might be too much for a bomber, but it surprisingly drinks very smoothly. This was a fun beer to run into, so earthy and malty. I keep looking for hazelnut, however even without it this is a killer beer. Very impressive!"

"O- good beer but not what I was expecting"
""
"I am really disappointed with this one. I love me some hazelnuts (aka filberts) and browns are a favorite style but I know Rogue is a crap shoot when I bought it. Been drinking their stuff for 10 years or more. I had Voodoo Maple Bacon again last week (SO GOOD!) and I've got a bomber of Voodoo Chocolate Peanut Butter Banana chilling for a couple of weeks from now. The Shakespeare, FestiveAle, Chocolate & Double Choc. stouts, Dead Guy and Glen were great, too. The American Amber, XS Imp. Porter were very far from. The rest are middling offerings. But with such high ratings from over 2000 people I expected better from this one. I've two more bottles sitting in the fridge. If they prove better I'll gladly amend this review (like always) but if your still looking at this in Sept. 2013 or beyond, they were just as bad."

"O: a very nice brown ale - the hazelnut isn't overpowering, cloying, or sweet - it fits well with the style and is a seamless blend. I'm not a big brown ale person, and the feels and tastes of the style are not my typical preference. That said, this was a very enjoyable beer that appealed in all areas. A fan of the style would no doubt enjoy this beer tremendously."

"O: Good beer overall, should get one more"
""
"22 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, no bottle dating. Pours slightly hazy deep reddish copper color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense cream colored head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of big caramel, hazelnut, chocolate, toffee, brown sugar, toast, brown bread, light floral, and toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of the malt notes with the big hazelnut presence. Taste of big caramel, toast, toffee, chocolate, brown sugar, hazelnut, brown bread, light floral, and toasted earthiness. No bitterness on the finish; and lingering notes of caramel, chocolate, toast, toffee, brown sugar, hazelnut, and brown bread on the finish for a short bit. Nice balance and complexity of malt flavors with only a moderate amount of hazelnut; not nearly as robust in flavor as I expected from the aromas; and no cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and lightly slick mouthfeel that was good. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very good flavored brown ale. Good balance and complexity of flavors; and very smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering. May have been an old bottle, but there is no way to know for sure."
"overall: a pleasant surprise, this is well crafted and tastes of smooth hazelnut with sufficient malt. will buy again"
""
""
"I will be having this one again."
"Poured from a bottle into a Pint glass, nice medium brown color with a small tan head. Aroma showed a hint of hazelnut and sweetness, the taste was the awesome surprise as a huge blast of true hazelnut comes through and then mellows on the taste bud into a nice full brown ale. Creamy and nutty with mild sweetness for the mouthfeel, overall an awesome brew....I would grab this again anytime!"

"Served in a standard shaker at The Saucer. Pours a deep, pretty brown color with some ruby hues and limited light penetration. It lacks any head to speak of and leaves no lacing to the glass. The nose is a good strong, sweet malt with some woody, earthy hops undertones. It has a strong smell of toasted cereal and just a hint of that hazelnut. The flavor is just too much hazelnut to me. The hops do a good job of cutting down the double whammy of malty sweetness and the hazelnut, which in this case tastes almost like Starbucks hazelnut syrup has been added. Finishes dry with a pretty good palate feel. I hesitated to review this beer due to my growing distaste for hazelnut purely because I'm sick of all the flavored syrups at coffee bars. Therefore, I really tried to review this one with the style in mind first of all, and my palate second of all (which is what I try to do no matter what). I even when back for a second round just to finalize my thoughts. I really think that overall, the hazelnut was just too much and overwhelmed the natural malt goodness of a good brown."

"Hazelnut Brown Nectar nicely melds hazelnut and brown ale flavors. It's a bit pricey for a bomber, but once you crack it open, it's hard to stop drinking until the bottle's empty."
""
""
"O: Overall the beer smelled good before tasting but after tasting the cloying hazelnut flavor became overbearing about four sips in. By 1/3 of the way through I found the unrelenting concentrated nut flavor to be somewhat nauseating. Sink poured the rest. Was expecting a lot more given the hype. Really seemed to lack subtlety in favor of ""HEY WE PUT NUTS IN THIS BEER!"" Would consider giving it another go but not anytime soon and not over $7 a bomber..."

"i dont know what the fuss is about this beer this does a major nothing for me i like brown ale but even the crappy browm ales has more taste then this and it sticks in the back of your thoart so i dont see why this isa good beer what a disappiont here"

"O: Not particularly likable aside from the aroma; I'm glad I only bought a single of these and wouldn't buy it again. Having said that, it's a good choice for hazelnut lovers - because let's face it, the flavor is nothing BUT that. If this and Frangelic Mountain Brown have taught me anything, it's that hazelnut beers give off great aromatic qualities...and not so great flavor profiles."

"Being a hazelnut lover, I tried to ignore all the reviews slamming this beer's ""artificial"" hazelnut flavoring. I really wanted to enjoy it. I did anyway. I thought it was a good beer....a nice dark amber with the slight feel of a porter and a hefty hint of hazelnut. Artificial or not....I will drink it again."

"Ooured from bottle into pint glass. Very nice amber/copper pour with a generous 2 finger off white head. Great lacing and retention throughout. Smell is a blend of carmel, brown sugar, roasted malts and nuts. Very inviting. Taste follows the nose and adds a level of complexity that makes this beer special. The carmel notes on the front give way to a nutty, coffee, roasted malts flavor that is spot on. A nice hop finish and this one is tough to set down. Feel is spot on as well. Creamy, silky on the tongue and the perfect level of carbonation. Overall- One of the best, if not the best brown I have had. Great combination of malts, nuts, carmel, sugar and hops. So easy to drink, very sessionable and a great effort from Rogue. A must have-"

"Bottle from the shop poured at home. Pours medium brown color, slightly clear, with a small white head. Smell is nutty hazelnuts, hint of chocolate. Dryer than expected, but very good hazelnut notes pairing well with the very light chocolate. Not particularly bold in the flavor, but not completely watered down. Finish lingers in a way that I don't like. A bit of a stale aftertaste. Overall a decent brown."

"A very predominantly nutty brown ale. The unique roasted nut note is pretty much the star here, reducing everything else to faint hints. The flavor is to my liking but I found it just a tad too dominant. I would've love some more balance here. Nevertheless, a good solid brew. It's a good substitute for coffee beers, sipping one away amongst intelligent conversation"

Finish is a nice sweet hazelnut, nocciolo flavor with a bit of chocolate malt and light bitterness. Overall a nicely balanced flavorful and enjoyable brew."

""
""
""
"22oz bottle. Pours a cloudy dark brown with a half inch of tan head. Lots of lacing. Aroma is really nutty with some caramel malts, hazelnut and hints of coffee. The flavor is earthy and nutty. Almost has a bit of a caramel popcorn taste to it. Hazelnut is more present at the end. Coffee finish. Creamy mouthfeel. Pretty nice twist on the style. Overall, one of the better Brown Ales out there."

"O: Not the bold brown that I anticipated, but that’s just fine. This was unique, nicely executed and a pleasure to drink."

"Overall, an extremely enjoyable beer and one that would be great with dessert. It's great that it is not too sweet with the presence of the chocolate and hazelnut. One I need to have more often."
""
""
""
""

"Wow, let me repeat that, wow. I have just found the same experience that I had when I first bit into a piece of toast with Nutella on it. For a fan of the hazelnut, this is the equivalent of a finding dark brown gold in a little 12 oz bottle. If you like a beer with a distinguished nut taste, look no further. You will not find a better beer. Did I mention this beer is good."
"My taste buds liked Hazelnut Brown from Sam Adams, so I decided to try this one out, and I couldn't be happier with that choice ... suddenly one of my favorite beers. I don't think I could drink more than one pint in a session, but good lord this is fantastic for ""desserty beer"" fans."
""
"This is jam packed with hazelnut. Good change of pace in the world of brown ales."
""
"Bought a bottle of this from M & R Liquors in Manchester, CT. Poured into a Baird pint glass. Mysterious cloudy brown hue. A playful hazelnut and maple syrup nose hints at the powerful hazelnut and hop flavor in the brew. Silky smooth caramel aftertaste with a bit of bitter toffee as well. This is an amazing fall/winter brew that matches with the changing leaves outside, making me reminisce on the whole experience. As far as brown ales go, this is one of the best i've ever had, not being overly hazelnut-driven and definitely sticking to its category. Definitely a recommendation!"

"O- Great mouthfeel and some really good flavors, but also some off-flavors. The aroma on this beer was pretty foul too. If you have ever spilled beer on the carpet and waited too long to clean it up, that aroma comes through in the flavor and aroma, kind of stale, stinky beer character"

"Drinkability is very high for the entirety of this 16 oz pint but I don't think I could solely session this all night as the sweetness would overwhelm me eventually. Otherwise, absolutely delicious."

"Review from 7/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours an interesting dark red-orange amber with a moderate head and lacing. Strong hazelnut and malt start and middle with some astringent hopping and dry finish. A bit more sweetness wouldn't hurt, but still a pleasant nutty brown ale. Nice."

"When Rogue nails it, they really nail it. This is a totally unique, totally fantastic beer. The hazelnut smell is strong, but the flavor is well-balanced and light (in a good way). As such, it's an all weather beer that stands alone. One of our local pubs has a constantly rotating tap, but this one has stayed on as long as I've been going there. It's a flavorful beer but because it's not overwhelmingly bold, it's a great beer to pass off to your friends, especially those who often reach for a Newcastle."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Maybe it's just my palate because this beer got really good reviews, and I DO really enjoy the aroma and flavor but I just think this beer would be great if it were bold all-around. I wish it had all of the nose, taste, and mouthfeel except intensified a lot. That said, brown ales and stouts are kind of mah thang. I recently had DFH Palo Santo & Indian Brown which are both HUMONGOUS browns in body, flavor, aroma (and booze)..I would almost call palo santo a stout--so I might just still be in a different element. But yeah, this just needs some thickening."

"This might actually be comparable to CCB Maduro. Very translucent brown body. It smells dry and full of hazelnut. slightly sweet smell. The taste is just right for a brown. Light and sweet. Slightly dry, but only enough to even things out. Light hazelnut flavor which hides the sweet base. Finishes nutty and sweet."

"This beer pours a light bodied chestnut brown in color with a one finger creamy off white head. The nose is somewhat sweet and malt with a touch of nuttiness, almost in a syrup type of manner. The flavors are a big improvement. It's malty with hints of caramel, toffee, and light butterscotch with a lot of hazelnut. The hazelnut even flows into the after taste and doesn't leave for a couple minutes. It has great, great flavor for the style. It drinks light and sweet with a subtly dry finish. This is one of the best brown ales you can find in my opinion. This beer may be an acquired taste but if you like coffee or nutty flavors this beer is for you."
""
"Overall a decent beer, but not a standout. It goes down very easy, and would be nice on a hot day, I would juts like a bit more fullness in the flavor. Worth a try, a nice variation on a brown ale."

"this beer is all over the place. pours a see through light brown M&M color, with a lacey off white head and an absolute ton of carbonation rising in the glass, looks like soda. smell is amazing, nutty and sweet, notes of vanilla, roasty english malt, and an earthy sort of hop vibe. flavor is a touch on the sweet side for my liking, its sugary in the mouthfeel too. the hazelnut flavor is great though, and it adds a great element to the beer. feel could be improved, a little less carbonation and a little more body and this would be world class, because its got everything else. overall one of my favorite brown ales, but stil room for improvement. excellent with gourmet pizza."
""
""
"O - This beer looked and smelled good but seemed a bit lacking in taste and mouthfeel. For a brown ale, it just didn’t seem like there was enough malt. The flavors didn’t shine through right away, and it just felt watery. Still a tasty beer, but I’ve had better brown ales."

""
""
""
""
"Let it sit. The warmer this beer gets the better. Fresh out of the fridge the smell and taste leave much to be desired. As it warms, malty notes of honey and hazelnut move to the forefront, however, not quite to the strength I'd desire. I enjoyed mine in a tulip glass. Not sure I'd purchase it again but worth the few dollars I spent at my local Trader Joe's."

"Color is dark brown; the tan head is well developed at first but fades quickly. While the scent is a bit muted, hazelnut is definitely noticeable. The taste is very nutty. Hazelnut is prominent, with a slight sweet and roasty malt flavor and a touch of floral hops bitterness. The mouthfeel is the weak point of this beer - it's quite thin and watery. I can see the strong nut flavor of this beer pairing well with desert."

"I will definitely be stocking this one in the fridge regularly now that it is not relegated to bombers. Hey Rogue! How about some four-packs of the Double Chocolate Stout? Please?"

"I was very pleasantly surprised when I first had this brew from a bottle, so I jumped at the chance to try it on tap. Served in a tumbler pint, the beer pours an amber-caramel coloring with a low profile, filmy, small bubbled head that clings to the edge of the surface. The nose is just as amazing as I remember it being in the bottle, with a creamy, buttery blend of rich hazelnut, caramel, and an overall roasted quality. Flavors are a light, smooth blend of Nutella and a biscuity backbone. It almost tastes like caramel popcorn soaked in a hazelnut blended coffee. Super smooth flavors that remain light, and the crisp body make this a ridiculously easy drinker. The aftertaste is nutty and sweet, with a sugary kiss at the very end. The finish is subtly sweet, with a sugary and rich hazelnut linger that entices the palate to continue drinking. This is a tremendous beer, and one of the better Browns I've ever had."

"Overall, I REALLY like this one. Its a great stand-alone drink with the flavors it has, and its mellow enough to go well with food or dessert. It may not be the best brown ale I'll ever have, but its one I could drink anytime. Highly recommended to try."
""
""
"O- I like this beer but its not as good as some of the other brown ales I have had like bells best brown. I think this beer needs to be a bit bigger in feel and along with that, a more intense flavor. It just felt a little watered down to me."

"Just hit the top of my brown ales list!"

"This review was from the bottle version but if I get it on tap again this will be redone and likely will increase."

"D - My first Rogue beer, and this thing did NOT disappoint. It was just an assault of unrelenting malty goodness. I'll admit, brown ales are far from my preferred style, but this exceeded all expectations and then some. A truly great beer from Rogue, and one I'll be having many more times."
""
""
""
"This is really really good. I scoffed at the high price of the six-pack at first, but it may be worth it."
""
""
""
"O- This is a solid offering from Rogue. Though, I am not a big fan of this style, this is my favorite brown ales. For easy to drink with big hazelnut. Nice job."
""
""
"Overall, I would gladly have it again. Reminds me of the Bohemia Chocolate Stout (but only because I had this one first) but better in every way. Leaves you with a pleasant aftertaste in the back of your mouth wanting another one, which is possible thanks to its ABV and flavor."
"O - Tasty take on a brown. Combined a nutty caramel sweetness with refreshing complimentary bitter. A nice dessert pick. Would buy again at the right price."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall its a really nice beer to drink. Its a bit expensive at 8 bucks but its worth it. Give it a try."
"Overall - This was tasty but not what id call worldclass. Much like most rogue beers, its just a little to light and mild for its only good. The hazelnut addition adds a excellent flavor and is enough to set it apart from the rest. Maybe a little more malt and hop woudl be nice cause this beer still is 6.2%, so its not like its a light 4-5% so a little more kick would work well."
""
"Pours a medium brown color with a cream head that stands 2 fingers tall in my duvel tulip. Head recedes to a film with a ring around the edge of my glass. As I drink it leaves some rings of lacing in my glass. Smell is of bread, toffee, hazlenut; not particularly roasty smelling, but smooth and malty without being too sweet. In the taste I get the hazlenut flavors and then a clean pop of caramel. The end of the taste has a slightly deeper, darker malt profile, maybe a tough of chocolate in there. Only a touch of roasted flavor comes out. Body is on the thicker side, just right for a brown ale, and the carbonation is not too agressive; making this a very smooth beer. I really loved this, I think it has become my favorite brown ale."
"I poured this beer into a pint glass, it has a nice dark mahogany colored body with a very little tan head, that quickly dissapears to a thin lace. The smell is nutty and malty. The is of hazelunt up front with some roasted malt. A little bit of hop come through on the back of the tongue. This has a great mouth feel, well balanced. Overall this is a really good brown ale."
""
""
""
""
""
"The body is light with good carbonation. Overall not bad. I was excited to see this in six packs. But lets be honest here, I'm still going to pass."
"O - I love the nose of this beer. The taste runs a course from sweet to malty. I like how this is not overpowered by the hazelnut. There is plenty of it there but other flavors balance it out."
""
"O. A decent beer that was pretty easy to drink but nothing I need to revisit."
"Overall a great twist on the American Brown Ale with a flavor punch without being too sweet"

I wouldn't say this beats their Chocolate Stout in my opinion, but this is a very solid and tasty beer, amazing quality and it's been a wonderful experience to try this for the first time. I will buy this again and I will be recommending this beer with pleasure."

""
""
"O- A very nice brown ale with tons of hazelnut flavor."
""
"A very well done brown ale. The hazelnut definitely came through as advertised, which I appreciated."
"O: One of my favorite beers and now that its offered in 6 packs make me a very happy person. It is a bit of a one dimensional beer, it's definitely hazelnut-centric, but that one focus is done well and is of a flavor that I love."

"Overall- A nice flavoured brown ale from Rogue. The flavours balance quite nicely and makes for an easy drinking brown ale."

""
"O: A fantastic ale. Would highly recommend. Very glad I had the opportunity to have this on tap, will seek it out in bottles as well from now on."
"This pours a nice dark copper color with a creamy brownish head. Nicely carbonated. A good looking beer. This has a sweet caramel smell, nothing that knocks me out, but nothing off putting either. The smell actually gets better as the head settles. In a word this tastes nutty. It's just a hair on the bitter side. I'm not a huge fan, but I've had worse. This is obviously a personal preference, so I'm not going to dock it too much. It has a nice feel to it, almost a little creamy. The texture and the ABV lead to a highly drinkable beer. I couldn't, again the style isn't just for me, but I think everyone should at least give this a shot."

"The beer is brown with an inch or so of head. Smells of hazelnut, nuts, malt, vanilla, sugar. Pretty sweet, so one pint is plenty. Nice flavor. I'm a huge fan of hazelnuts / hazelnut flavor, and this beer delivers. Well balanced and tasty, although a bit sweet. Still, a solid effort, and I'm a sucker for hazelnuts. I enjoy having this every now and again."
"O: Well-balance, not overly sweet, and quite pleasant."

""

""
"o - Overall a pretty good brown ale. I liked the taste a little more than the nose, due to more vanilla/cream. Was pretty easy to drink a whole bomber, would have it again."
""
""
"O - I love brown ales, and was eager to try this, but overall I would have to say this is a misfire from Rogue. Lack of carbonation, off flavor combinations, and too much hazelnut (and not much else) left me scratching my head. I wont be buying this again. Give me a Breckenridge Mighty Brown or a DFH Indian Brown Ale anyday."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A knockout."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A pretty decent brew. Not really what I'd go for normally, but as of yet, I haven't drank a Rogue beer that I haven't liked. It's worth a junior-college try."

"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a pint glass. A vigorous pour gives a nice thick off white to tan colored head. The color is brown but on the lighter side of brown. The smell is sweet with hints of chocolate and toffee. The taste follows suit with a basic Brown ale character low to no hops. Semi sweet with a hint of chocolate. The mouthfeel is medium with good carbonation. Overall a good beer but not as good as Sam smith and dfh"

"The beer sits light on your tongue, not heavy or overbearing by any stretch. Overall quite a pleasant experience; one of the better examples of a flavored beer, for sure. If you're a brown ale type, and have a thing for hazelut in other beverage arenas, you can't pass this one up."
"O- Very nice beer! Certainly I will have it again."
"This one is pretty strange. At first pour it looks amazing; deep reddish amber, small head, tight bubbles, great carbonation. Nose gets a little weird; biscuity, malty, and hazelnut... which doesn't seem to quite fit. Taste is very malty, syrupy sweet with hazelnut overtones. Sweetness lingers. Overall a nice effort, pretty much as expected."
"Overall - Really a solid brew from Rogue. I can see why this one is so highly rated. Very interesting aroma and flavors going on with high drinkability add up to a great option in the brown ale arena."
"O: Quite impressive. Brown ales aren't generally my ""go-to"" beer, but I'll most definitely be tracking this one down in the near future. Outstanding."
"Overall: smooth, robust, a ""sitting by the fire"" sipper. I've never had a taste like this before. The hazelnut really makes it pop . I see why it's so recommended. Would love to try on tap."
"Very focused flavors here. Delicate yet refined. Good texture and very enjoyable on any occasion."
"This is a very exceptional brown ale. Very well done."
"It poured a clear amber with a light, welcoming aroma. I didn’t get anything resembling a hazelnut on the nose, although I’m not sure I’d get much of a hazelnut aroma from an actual hazelnut either. This beer taste great. It has a sweetness to it without being overly malty or syrupy, and a finish that I would describe as hazelnuts on parade. Not your typical brown ale but oh so good."
"O: This is a good beer! Great flavors and balance."
"O - a very good brown ale. It has the characteristics needed of a brown ale to make a person know what style it is while also going a different direction with the unique hazelnut nectar giving it the tools to be seperate from others. It's just a good home brew style recipe that gets the credit it deserves. Like a mad scientist taking a classic style and turning it into his own world class piece of art."
"Overall: I am in awe how delicious this brew taste. Reminds me a little bit of raisinets. Everyone at the table (4) loved it!It's creamy, seet, hazelnut and a great malt. It is not too heavy or too light. Love it! Love Rogue! Cheers!"
"O-really nice beer for dessert"
"Notes: On-tap at Sanctuary. Quite sweet and lots of hazelnut. I enjoyed it for what it was and it makes for a nice dessert or just kind of a sweet nightcap."
"O- Love it. I think it's seriously a great beer."
"O - I'm surprised I liked this one so much, but then again the Rogue brewery do conjure up such magnificent brews! Love it."
"Overall a great brown that I wish I had tried sooner. Even though I can get a local six pack for almost the same price as a 22 oz bottle of this, I’ll surely pick it up again."
"Overall: Not a bad Brown, but much more potential. I feel like hazelnut is the perfect nut for this style, and it wasn't showcased enough. Still, I won't turn this down if offered, and I might buy it again."
"overall i like this beer a lot, great rendition of a brown ale. not my favorite, but tasty and not too filling."
"Rogue has done it again. What a unique fantastic brew and extra points for adding an ingredients list. Why don't all beers do this? The look is pretty basic brown and decent head. Where this beer shines is in the excellent malt base and perfect pairing of hazelnut. Nothing extremely complex and brilliant because it lets the balanced hazelnut taste be the star. Beer candy."
"Overall - It’s easy to agree with all of the awards and accolades this beer has earned. It’s an extremely well-crafted beer that hits the promised mark - hazelnut “nectar” - and avoids all pitfalls, such as being overly sweet, overpoweringly nutty, and so on. It’s a pleasantly complex beer with all the comforting qualities of a brown, as well as being unique (without being strange) and refreshing, in its way."
"not blown away by this one but still very easy too drink, if you like hazelnut this ones for you"
"This beer is really good, and one of the better brown ales I've had. Great malt base, sweet and with nice dark fruit presence. The hazelnut works really well with the rest of the beer. Delicious."
"O: This has always been one of my favorite brown ales and is definitely my go to when I'm in the mood for this style. Only ranked #9? WTF?"
"This is one solid beer. Even without the hazelnut, the mouthfeel, density, taste and smell are all spot on with what you expect from an American brown ale. Then the twinge of hazelnut mixes with the toasted malts giving a medley of balance and flavor. Upon hearing the term nectar one would think this would be a sweet or heavy beer. It's not."
"O: What better to accompany a Sunday brunch than some Hazelnut Brown Nectar. Pancakes + Breakfast Scrambler + Hazelnut Brown Nectar = Win"
"So with everything I've babbled on about, go out and try it for yourself and write your own review."
"I drank the whole bomber watching football. Great sipping beer with junk food."
"Overall: A very easy drinking brown ale with a lot of flavor. Rogue surely nailed the style with this beer. If I'm going to drink a Rogue beer over 6% ABV my preference would still be Dead Guy Ale."
"O: very unique within the style. Sweeter and more distinguished than any other nut brown ale I've had, which admittedly isn't all that many. I'll be buying this one again and I'd recommend you give it a try."
"Overall: This is a something I'd want as a session beer and openly proclaimed such, but it needs to be about 2% lower in ABV for that to happen. I wonder how much was missed out on from the draft pour. It was excellent in flavor and feel. Definitely a beer I'd go back for - probably the best American Brown Ale I've had."
"Overall: Excellent beer overall. The hazelnut really adds a nice character to the brown ale style. I'd recommend giving this one a try."
"Overall: Great beer to start my night; well-pleased with an outstanding beer from Rogue. Can't speak for the bottle, but if you get the chance to try on tap, it's a must-do!"
"D: different for a brown considering the lack of roasted malt, but still very delicious brew. it's light drinking body makes it very quaffable."
"Unique and enjoyable overall."
"O - Good brown ale, but i was expecting more thanks the advertising behind the beer. I would try it again, but its not my favorite."
"Perfectly medium body and flavor. A substantial presence but still very drinkable. Just a bit too fizzy to be great. I could drink this all November."
"O: This is a brilliant example of an American Brown Ale. Sweet-tasting, lots of personality, well-balanced - everything you want."
"Initially, I will admit that I was hesitant to try a brew with hazelnut flavors--I kept imagining the overly-syruped coffees at the local java joint--but I was pleasantly surprised to be dead wrong. Overall, I find this to be a wonderfully complex brew, with many layers and nuances to explore."
"Overall - An amazing twist on a brown ale, you could down more than a few of these."
"Maybe I got a bad bottle."
"O: I really like this brown ale. The hazelnut is nice and subtle, not off-putting at all. It sets this one apart from other brown ales. One of my new favorites."
"o- I liked this beer a lot. I have not tried to many Rogues beers, but saw this in a local six pack shop and decided to take it for a whirl. It is a bit on the sweet side, but I think it adds lots of character to the beer. It is not too sweet like other beers I have encountered. It is also not too bitter. I would reccommend this beer to anyone, if they do not know much about beers or are looking for something new to try. I had mine after dinner and it felt like a very pleasant dessert."
"O: What Rogue advertises, they do; I’ll give them that. They don’t sell this as a porter, a stout, or even an imperial ale; it’s a brown ale or a “nectar,” as the bottle puts it. While this may not be the thickest, most jaw-dropping beer you’d ever have, they do work the flavors out really well. It’s a very pleasant drinking experience, especially as a accompaniment to food; if you need something sugary enough to satisfy your sweet tooth during a meal, but light enough to be refreshing, this beer’s for you."
"It was not particularly complex but good and balanced. It wasn't as full bodied as the Samuel Smith's nut brown ale and I'd say probably one notch below the Samuel Smith overall."
"O: Well done beer. Not much of a Rogue fan, but this is good stuff. I recall having this several years ago and really digging it, but didn't think that memory would serve consistent. Right on."
"O - There's a reason this is top rated. If you have access to it, you'd be doing yourself a disservice by not grabbing several bottles."
"Very nice tasting beer. Highly drinkable."
"Overall, this was a great beer. The hazelnut was definitely the main focus in nose and taste, but did not overwhelm the senses. What a great change of pace from the typical brown ale. I would be willing to trade my next cup of specialty coffee for this any time."
"O: Thoroughly enjoyable albeit not fantastic. Glad I tried it once, and I would go back to again if I needed something nutty."
"This one was a treat. Poured darkish brown with a fair bit of tan head. Smelled nutty with malts and caramel in there as well. The taste is much of the same, the caramel, hazelnuts and malts definitely shine but there is some hop character present, although very subtle. The flavor is very complex, but not overtly so, a delight to enjoy! I was very pleased with this beer and it is now one of my favorite brown ales."
"Delicious and flavorful brown ale, the hazelnut really adds a lot. I had never thought about that as a potential flavor in beer before, but it works great. Otherwise, it's just a generally above average brown ale, decent strength makes it not quite sessionable but not overpowering either. The hazelnut takes this from just good to unique, though, and that's the reason to try it and the reason I would come back again. Wish it didn't feel so thin though."
"Overall, a good beer. Would be greatly improved with a bigger body. Still, definitely a nice one."
"O: If this beer was thicker it may have added to the flavor profile. But I believe the consistency peels the flavors apart."
"Cheers!"
"Overall a good beer, much better than any brown ale i've had before."
"I"
"A tremendously delicious brown ale--perhaps my favorite within the style. A lot of varying, relatively complex flavors, come together for an extraordinarily drinkable and highly delicious beer. I can't help but gulp this."
"Overall, very nicely balanced and easy to drink. Delicious."
"M&O- pretty drinkable. Well balanced. Lightly carbonated. Flavorful."
"really this is a great craft product"
"This beer was my first favorite and is still a go-to for me. Perfect when you want a robust, rich brown ale that's not too complex."
"M - Thin-to-medium body with good carbonation. Slightly watery but with a sweet, syrupy finish."
"Nice carbonation sting gives way to hazelnut followed by a faint honey flavor. Finishes dry, woody, and nutty. Plumb is detected as it warms. A very solid, tasty brown ale."
"This beer poured out as a nice rich brown color. The head was a light tan color with some light lacing. The smell of the beer was big with hazelnut, kind of impressed actually. I didn't expect it's aroma to be so prominent. The taste of the beer was sweet at first and then finished with a nice bitterness at the end. The mouthfeel wasn't bad really it was decent for the style. Overall it's an interesting brew and worth trying for sure."
"O: I really do like this beer, it's smooth and extremely drinkable, there are no dominant tastes, everything is well balanced. I would drink again, a nice flavorful, light feeling beer."
"This was a good brown ale, and very true to its style, but I was honestly hoping for more of a novelty beer (a candy-bar in a bottle). The brewer went for balance here, but I think it would have been interesting to go for richness instead. I don't think the hazelnut flavors complement the hops very well, but they do complement the malt. Combining hazelnut with a sweeter, richer beer that has more residual malt would be interesting. Still, this was a very nice brown ale and should be enjoyed by anyone who likes this style."
"Let me start off saying that is by far the best brown I have had hands down. Poured out very brown, almost like a wood stain of some kind, little head that tried to hold on till the end but left some lacing. Right off, the smell sucked me in, it was very sweet, nutty, chocolate, coffee and some malt. You can definitively tell there is hazelnut in there...the first sip was astonishing. Sweet, but not too much, lots of hazelnut with some chocolate and coffee. The thing that made this beer stand out is that it was paired with a final bitterness that didn't cover up the sweetness. But rather complimented it just enough so you knew you weren't drinking an iced mocha morning shit, but a BEER! I wouldn't go as far to say it was a dessert beer, but it definitively is a treat."
"Would I buy this again? Not sure... I would try it in the bottle, even though I have much love for taps :) Would I recommend it? Yes, due to it's oddness and creativity!"
"O-Very happy with this beer. Different from any other porter i have had. Not to sweet not to bitter, just right."
"O: Overall it's a good beer. I would drink it again. It drinks a lot like a mellow, much weaker coffee stout. So, if you want something not as powerful, this is your drink."
"It was a great decision for Rogue to distribute this beer nationwide. It is the best Brown that I have had, and I continue to enjoy this flavor."
"O - this is one fine brown ale and definitely worth checking out. its everything it says it will be."
"Overall: Quite good. Better than I would have expected. Very drinkable, and a nice way to cap off the night."
"hazel nut wow....it def has that aroma and taste in this beer...and thats about all you really taste....i wish the hazelnut wasn't so watered down....don't get me wrong the hazelnut is def. prominent in this beer....the taste is pretty nutty....its not bad...actually the nut is starting to come more out since the beer is warming up....i'm really a big fan of this beer"
"O- Not the most drinkable beer because the hazelnut taste gets old. Not executed as well as I feel it could have been, becvause I think the idea is great but too sweet and extracty for me. I love nut brown ales and hazelnut seems like a perferct addition or showcase but please tone down the extract to let the other flavors shine more. I think it would really help the beer out"
"Poured a dark tea brown with a small off-white head that settled to a thin ring of bubbles. Toasty malts in the aroma, and not much else; slightly nutty. Taste: it's a brown ale. Malts and...malts, some caramel, a bit of nuttiness, brown sugar, and some coffee bitterness. Not really hazelnut though. Medium body, somewhat drinkable, but pretty bland I thought."
"After this beer warmed more it got smoother to drink and the carbonation was much less offensive. The flavors also came out more, but only by a little bit. The taste got better, but now it's just closer to a 4 than to a 3, but still a solid 3.5."
"Atmosphere is great. Rich brown body, a really thick frothy head, and very persistent lacing. Nose is a great combination of very softly done nut and fruit. It kinda' makes me think of freshly baked banana bread. Flavor is bittersweet malt and subtle sweet notes, with a thick robust body. Overall, this is a great quaff."
"Wow I was not expecting this beer to be this good this is fantastic, this is almost like drinking dairy creamer it's so good."
"Overall a finely crafted beer. good drinkability on top of great flavor. I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoys rich, sweet chocolately beers."
"My wife swears by this beer, and while I wouldn't kill for it the way she would, I would definitely injure for it. Huge hazelnut flavor announces itself through the nose. The strong flavor sticks with you via aftertaste, but in this case, that's a good thing. More of a desert beer than an everyday drink, but it's a damn good one."
"O: Every time this beer blows me away. Its so drinkable and every drink is enjoyable. Nice light sweetness mixed with earthy nuttiness. Highly recommended."
"O - This was a nice surprise, I'll definitely pick this up again, perhaps to pair with a dessert."
"Poured a nice rich clear medium to dark brown with an average sized light brown head that was mostly diminishing leaving just a little residue hanging around allowing for good lacing. The aroma was of a nutty caramel malt and a doughy yeast with a nice note of hazelnut, brown sugar and a ever so light touch of coffee. It tasted lightly sweet with hints of caramel and coffee in the beginning. Then it matured into a very malty-nutty flavor with the hazelnut being the most pronounced at the finish, although the flavor could of lasted a little longer on the taste buds. Mouthfeel was medium in body and creamy yet slightly watery in texture as alot of brown ales can be with the carbonation being ever so perfectly soft. Overall a very nice malty nut brown ale, this happens to be my favorite style and this brew fits it very well indeed."
"I hate to say this again, but Rogue stop charging these prices for your beer or at least stop bottling everything in bombers! At 7 bucks a bottle I can’t see any reason to ever come back to this beer unless on tap. This is a good brown ale and certainly worth trying, but the price truly hurts it. Good but not great and not worth the money."
"O: This beer becomes light as air to drink and is excellent in the winter, and probably would be a great summer beer as well."
"An interesting beer and a good use of hazelnut flavour. The nut character is a bit much for some but I think it works."
"Taste is very sweet right away. Interesting. I get the nectar label. It's very sweet not in a cloying barley way but almost in a juice or dessert way. The hazelnut is obvious but subtle and adds a nice accent to a solid brown ale."
"overall; pretty good, a tasty treat, highly recommended."
"overall - i just keep liking this more and more with every sip. sooo good."
"A memorable beer that I highly recommend."
"O: well put together, and the hazelnut isn't as prevalent as I had feared."
"Overall - An excellent example of the style with the right abv and ibu, I wish it came in smaller bottles as its biggest down side is the 6.99 for a bomber. That said go grab one and see for yourself."
"Pours a clean deep amber to brown in color with a small light tan head. In the aroma, sweet to dry nuttiness and a sweet malt. In the taste, sticky-sweet nuttiness and a sweet malt. A small bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry, sweet nuttiness in the aftertaste. Sticky sweet that can be a bit much when it gets warmer, but mostly enjoyable."
"O: The hazelnut flavor is great. Definitely gonna pick this one up again."
"overall - for the price, not the best value (~$6 for 22oz), but a good beverage worth trying"
"The mouthfeel is perfect, it's not too thick and has just the right amount of carbonation. The drinkability is top-notch as well, this is actually a beer that I'm glad is in large-format bottles, because drinking all of it isn't an issue at all. A seriously great brown ale that I highly recommend."
"O- A good brown, with the hazelnut well added. Good to see a flavor addition contribute positively to the beer. A lot of people criticize PacMan yeast on these forums but I think it worked well here. Tasty throughout."
"A nice medium brown color with ample tan head. Chocolate and hazelnut aroma with a touch of caramel and perhaps some roasted malt. The flavor is all hazelnut, with some chocolate and a touch of caramel. I didn't really get much hops in there other than a pleasant bitterness that helped to balance the intense hazelnut. Medium body but a bit thin mouthfeel. This was a good beer and I like hazelnut but I thought this had just a bit too much."
"Rogue Hazelnut Brown Nectar is a clear, red-brown ale with a yellowish white head that vanishes quickly. It has a nutty aroma that's a touch sweet. It's light and lively on the tongue. It leaves the mouth a little chalky and numb. It has lots of hazelnut flavor, not sweet nor dry. There is just enough bitterness to make it drinkable. There's a huge hazelnut aftertaste. It really delivers the hazelnut, but it's quite a stretch to call it a ""nectar"". This is OK, but mildly disappointing by Rogue standards."
"O: A great brown, truly hard to match. I would love to try it on draft!"
"Overall: Definitely a solid brew. In terms of a"" Hazelnut Brown Nectar", they definitely portrayed it nicely. Tons of nutty flavor and a solid finish. Would drink again for sure."
"Rogue Hazelnut Brown Nectar has an amber brown colour and a 3 mm head that fades quickly. The smell is all hazelnuts: sweet and earthy. The taste is slightly sour with earthy maltiness. The finish is a little sour too. This beer has a decent foamy texture. Overall, a very nice and interesting brew."
"Fantastic beer. Enjoyable breadth of flavors so everyone will find something they enjoy in there. I'll be back for more."
" Upon drinking this, it was a blend of Hazelnut, brown sugar, malt and maybe a hint of spice thrown in. The aftertaste had a short stay. This was a very subtle kind of beer for me as I'm used to much more stronger flavors being in your face, but this is something I can really take a liking to. Light bodied and medium cabonation."
"Pours a very nice-looking, clear ruby-brown. Lace the color of the tan on the bottle art patches the glass sides un-sparingly. Smell is fresh, light roasted brown malts, with a bit of mineral and chocolate. Taste is clean and subdued. Hazelnut at the beginning, a bit of sweetness throughout. Finishes slightly bitter. Feels a bit tannic from the nuts and malts. Drinks good. A calm, easy-going brown ale."
"Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth with a tiny bit of carbonation. Very good because more of that CO2 acidity would really distract from the flavors. The beer has a some weight to the body and is very satisfying to drink. A very fine beer from a brewery I've almost always been disappointed with. Tasty and worth keeping around."
"Lots of carbonation in this one, finding it to be a bit to fizzy but still retains a bit of a creamy texture. Overall not too bad but not quite as nutty as I would have liked it to be."
"D - Extremely drinkable beer, either as a session or on its own."
"D - A nice ABA and recommended"
"DRINKABILITY: This is a good beer to start the night with and is mild enough to have more than one if you wish. It's not easily forgotten and I'd definitely buy it again, and again. The aroma of this beer is one that kept me going back to sniff because the scent was so good. Highly recommended."
"I love hazelnuts so when I saw this on my bars MBA beer list I figured why not. The beer did not fail to deliver, it was a nice dark brown. The smell was amazing to me there is no better smell than roasted hazelnuts. The nuts weren't very forward, to me i got a bit of maltiness first then came the hazelnuts. The beer was quite smooth not overly carbonated. I could easily drink this everyday possibly with chocolate as a dessert beer?"
"Pours a medium dark brown w/ a very thin caramel colored head that quickly disappears. Looks good- wish the head was a little better. Smell is that of Hazelnut, chocolate, malt. Taste is good, but it feels a little thin to me taste-wise, I'd like the body to be thicker. Not much aftertaste, it kind of just evaporates into nothingness. Drinkability is decent. Maybe I've been drinking too many big high ABV beers lately, but this one is just above average in my book. A good session beer. This is a good beer, and I'm glad I tried it."
"The only negative I can see others having about this beer would be the strong scent of hazlenut. I believe one bottle of this or a couple of pints is just perfect. I'm very happy with this beer."
"Pours a dark brown with medium off-white head that disappears quickly. Scent is very malty with some almond aromas...very nutty. Taste is TONS of hazelnut. I also get almond flavors with vanilla, roasted malt, and caramel. The hazelnut profile in the flavor is so unique and delicious. Mouthfeel is smooth, full bodied, and somewhat thick. Drinkability is very high."
"I just love drinking this beer. And I'm not even a huge Nut Brown Fan. Great beer."
"The CPJ"
"D- It drinks as advertised, a nice nutty brown ale with plenty of sweetness. It's as easy to drink as you'll get, but one pint was enough due to the extreme aroma and sweet taste of the hazelnut."
"Interesting beer with plenty of character, but not my preference."
"D: The beer goes down very easily; the hazelnut flavors are well incorporated into the overall taste."
"T: Sweet flavor with a lot of hazelnut, milk chocolate and brown sugar flavor without being too sweet. This is probably my favorite brown ale and a go to on tap."
"D: Delicious and somewhat mellow flavor compared to other ""robust"" brews. Only thing that would slow me down is how filling it is. A top notch brown ale."
"Overall it was good tasting but the hazelnut was just a little over powering for me."
"D - Very easy to drink - but it's not a Guinness."
"I really enjoy Rogue, but I wish the flavor was a little more intense as the thin mouthfeel kind of diminishes the overall impact. Buff up the body and taste and you'd have something great -- but still, without a doubt a very good beer."
"Drinkability - This is a pleasing and proper brown ale. Wonderful aroma and flavor. Very easy to drink. It could be drunk year round. The fragrance of this beer is the star of the show. I kept sniffing it because it smelled so, so good. In my opinion, this is how a Brown Ale should smell and be compared to. More than adequate in other categories also. Most definitely one that I will pick up again."
"This was a pretty decent brown ale, lots of good flavor and very drinkable."
"This really ended up drinking more like an English Brown - medium-light body and clean. Still, certainly not as weak as say a Newcastle. Take away the nut and you have something like a slightly chewier Sam Smith Nut Brown. Nut bad (okay, I meant to write ""not", but I'll leave it, a-ha!), definitely sessionable."
"Easy to go down, tasty, and a good one to start the night with. Not sure about food pairings, but this was a good first pint."
"Recommended to all coffee lovers, it is very easy to drink."
"D- awesome. A little sweet for my palate but definately drinkable. Tasty well balanced and nothing too bold."
"Very deep brown in color with dark red hues. Phenomenal rocky brown head. Excellent retention. Sticks around for a long time. Good amount of lacing as well. Not too much but a noticeable amount. Very aromatic nose. Extremely nutty and toasty. Sweet caramel and natural grains notes make an appearance. Brown sugar also comes to mind. Taste is caramel coffee like with some nutty undertones. There is a slight bitterness in the middle but sweetens up a bit with and almond like alcohol taste in the finish. Very good. Mouth feel medium bodied with a smooth velvet finish. Hell. This is one awesome brown ale. Drinkability is 10 out of 10. Very aromatic and tasty."
"This beer opens up with a maltyness which turns into a sweet, then nutty flavor. Its more of a sweet caramel-ish flavor than nutty. It has a certain crispness to it from the dry finish. Its an interesting flavor, not as nutty as I was expecting but still very good. The carbonation is pretty sharp, but this beer is still very drinkable and easy to put down."
"Sweet beers are right up my alley, so I was looking forward to indulging in this beer. Unfortunately, it was quite a disappointment in almost every single way. The taste is far too mild to be truly enjoyable and it's just way too thin. Makes for easy enough drinking, but I don't think I'll be revisiting this brew any time soon."
"One of my favorite beers ever. Dark brown color with a small 1/4"" white head that laces the glass. The smell is sweet and nutty and mimics the actual taste of the beer. Tastes of light coffee up front, but sweet caramel and almond on the back end. It is tough to stop at just one of these, and got my normally non adventurous travelmates addicted as well (sampled at the Portland airport)"
"Mouthfeel lacks in depth as it's noticeably light as well. Thin feel with a small carbonated presence, though it's very easily drinkable overall. Just wished it was a bit more substantially bigger in flavor."
"This is a damn fine brew. A fantastic brown ale. This is some serious sessionable stuff here. My wife stole half my brew. Brew is great in every aspect. Another top shelf brew from Rogue."
"Drink Ability: I could drink this all night. Not filling. Delicious tasting. No booze taste at all. I wish I bought another one so I could drink some more now."
"In conclusion, this was a pretty good beer. I definitely see myself trying this again on a day where I crave sweets. I would not recommend this for anyone who enjoys fuller bodied beers, or hoppy beers for that matter."
"D: Overall, it was decent, but not for $5.50/22oz bottle. If I'm paying that much for a beer I expect it to be something that I can sip slowly and enjoy. I was unimpressed."
"O – The hazelnut in this beer is incredible. The toasted character is warm and soothing, with soft edges that are noticeably absent of burnt notes."
"D- Just too sweet for me. I don't think I'll have this one again."
"Drinkability- 3 out of 5. With some smoked barbeque or some German chocolate cake, this would be awesome. In the absence of complimentary cuisine, however, it's a bit too strong to drink more than one 22oz bottle-- even I had a hard time finishing it. It was a good experience and not a bad drink by any means, but barring a drastic influx of pork and cake into my diet, I won't be picking up another. It would be great to split with a friend or two after dinner."
"D: Amazing brown ale! This is my one of my favorite brown ales and I could definitely have more than a few of these delightful brews."
"D: Great drinkability, I'd definitely have a bomber along with desert any day"
"D. A really good brew I expected the sweetness however I wasn't ready for the bitter finish. Great balance and a good brew."
"This would probably be a must-try if you're crazy for brown ales. Otherwise, you're not missing much if you pass."
"This beer pours an aber color with an off white head, like a light tan color. The aroma of this beer smells of rich in malt, there is also a hint of nutty aroma. The taste is strong with nutty sweetness to it. Classic brown ale taste to it. There is a hazlenut sweetness to it, although you can tell its extract. The mouthfeel is medium, and is a drinkable beer."
"Picked this up very exciting to try another rogue beer. It pours a very nice dark reddish color with a slightly off white head that was very creamy. about 2 fingers. The nose is very very nutty with some malt. The only thing I get in the taste is a bunch of nuttieness. Maybe a slight bit of malt. The nuts overpowers the taste way too much. It is also way too sweet. It has a decent mouthfeel but not a great bit of drinability just because its way too sweet. Im a big fan of rogue, but this is the only beer by them Ive had that I would not recommend drinking. Way too sweet, not very complex. I was disappointed to be honest,"
"As a side note, i tried mixing this with the chocolate stout on the advice of a local Rogue rep and it was awesome!"
"Has a amber-brown appearance with a decent tan head. You can definitely smell the hazelnut and it carries through into the taste. Smooth and malty with little bitterness. It was easy going down and not overly carbonated. Altough not one of my favorites, I definitely enjoyed it and would order again."
"Not sure I would have again on it's own, but perhaps paired with the appropriate cheese or something it would be worth revisiting."
"Drinks: like one of the better browns out there. It's smooth, balanced, and dammit, I loves me some hazelnuts."
"D- Very unique flavor, I think Rogue probably accomplished what they wanted to do with this beer, but I found it to be a little too sweet, and while the flavor was good, I can't see myself drinking multiples or going back for this one again."
"Very complex for a brown ale, yet very drinkable. Truly one of my favorite."
"Notes: I love a good brown ale and this one just shot toward the top of my list."
"The malt and hazelnut appears and finish together. It is smooth throughout very well put together. The crystal malts and the hazelnut are lite but are wonderful. This is perhaps the best example of how use of ingredients outside the 4 can make a wonderful beer."
"D: a little more sweet and a little less sour woulda done it for me. Lacked the malty richness I expected."
"It looked brown, tasted like nectar would to bees (consider we are human) very smooth. I could drink this for a substitute of juice for breakfast any day. The only complaint is the bottle should be bigger or come in six pack of cans, cause I could shotgun about 6 of these bastards."
"D - Very smooth and drinkable brown ale. I love hazelnuts so this beer really hit the spot for me."
"Pouring dark brown with a thin, brown head that recedes to a ring rather quick. This is decent. The nose is just a little disappointing. Caramel and some brown sugar are noticeable, but what jumps right out are soggy corn flakes (unsweetened). Initially, the hazelnut is REALLY strong, but it gently fades, bringing a some of balance. The palate opens lightly sweet, with caramel, brown sugar and quite a bit of hazelnut flavor. Again, I get a strange soggy cereal flavor, rather off-putting. Mildly sweet on the finish, this is medium-light in body and has moderate carbonation. I don't know if this bottle is off, but this isn't all that enjoyable."
"I can see why some would really enjoy this, but it just isn't my cup of tea."
"D- ok the good part... I can slam this! Very drinkable and tasty at the same time. Not the best depiction of the style but still very good"
" ~ I'm not a huge brown ale fan. However, this beer is very drinkable and offers a unique complexity not often found in the style. I was not a huge fan of the style because I had not tried this beer before today. The character of this beer is for what other Brown Ale brewers should strive to meet."
"So overall I really like this beer. It's great, and its different. I really think they pulled off the whole hazelnut thing, which I was very skeptical about at first since I don't really like hazelnut coffee or anything like that. This beer is an exception though, it is just delicious. Good job rogue, just don't trick me again!"
"drinkability: I gave lowmarks for the residual slight aftertaste; a quaffer, not a sipper!"
"Pours a nice chestnut brown color with a big foamy head that sticks to the glass as it recedes. Just a little bit of haze to the body of they with some red hues coming through. The aroma is unreal on this brown ale. Big time hazelnut aroma like fresh toasted hazelnuts. A bit of honey and brown sugar on the nose also. Pretty much the best smelling beer ever. The flavor drops off for me a bit as it's extremely dry and get a hint of astringent flavors. Really nutty and malty with very little hops. Also a bit thin for me. Nice lingering sweet flavors of roasted hazelnuts but the carbonation is a bit high for me and this really would be better if it was creamier or had nitro. Drinkability is good and this beer is delicious. Worth the 4.99 a bomber and would really open up with some roasted pork or a steak sandwich."
"Worth a try, but only once. Despite my harsh feelings towards hazelnuts, I liked this."
"Carbonation is a little high."
"It's unlike anything I've had before to be honest. The hazlenut is as pronounced here as you'll find it anywhere, and this is about as sweet of a brown ale you'll find."
"This is one of my favorite beers, I believe this was my first craft brew years ago. Brown in color, with an intense hazenut smell. Big nutty flavor, smooth malty finish. If you love hazenuts you will love this brew. The beer brings to the table exactly what it describes."
"One of my first brown ales and one that I still visit quite often."
"Notes: Judging from the high reviews this beer has gotten I am guessing I got an old bottle. Does anyone know when this beer is brewed so I can get a fresh bottle?"
"A unique and very enjoyable brew. I really like hazelnut and the flavor definitely makes this brew stand out."
"D = big fan! well-balanced, just the right amount of hazelnut, had it with homemade chocolate ice cream and it was like drinking Nutella"
"Cheers.."
"Brown Nectar is one of those beers I get excited about no matter how many times I've had it, and whether it's coming to me from a bottle or on-tap. Every time I have this beer it's like a pick-me-up, my mood goes from whatever to great in a matter of sips. Strong hazelnut flavor, from a rich translucent brown body with medium carbonation and foamy head. I highly recommend drinking Brown Nectar in a bathtub or in the hot sun, highly refreshing, crisp, sweet, nutty taste. From my experience this seems to be the case with Rogue, they don't make any crazy zany beers of experimental styles or in the hazy realm of deep palate tasting notes. Rogue makes good-ass beers, in whatever department they chose. They may not be the craziest, or the finest, but DAMMIT they're the beerest (coining that phrase, btw.)"
"Nice and creamy, medium bodied and well carbonated. Very drinkable so long as you want a nice sweet brew. Certainly one of the best brown ales around."
"Very drinkable. Not too sweet, not too thin or thick, very rich flavored. Not your traditional brown ale, but it's something you won't find from other nut browns. Very solid beer from Rogue."
"This might be one of my favorite accessible brown ales of all time. With each and every sip, I just crave more until the bottle is finished. Great value and great taste for sure."
"Cheers..."
"I don't like most brown ales because they typically have a sticky starchy sweetness. But thankfully this isn't like that, it's more crisp."
"D - Very good brown ale with a dominant nutty character and sweet flavor accented with a mild hop punch. Good stuff."
"D- A nice take on the style. The hazelnut aspect brings is a welcome addition to a brown ale. It is tasty, but a bomber seems to be a bit much- at least tonight."
"Hazelnut brown nectar poured a dark amber color, with almost no head. It smelt of pure liquified hazelnut. THe taste was rather similar; very strong hazlenut flavor, was expecting a much stronger ale flavor. Easy to drink, and very unquie, a one of a kind. Overall a pretty good, never had anything like it. Worth a try."
"D: Superb drinkability. Order one to accompany your last course or to *replace* your last course."
"This might be one of my favorite accessible brown ales of all time. With each and every sip, I just crave more until the bottle is finished. Great value and great taste for sure."
"MF/D: medium to full-bodied. A good tasty drink, but 1 glass was enough. A little too sweet to have a ton of, but a good brown ale. I might like this better in colder weather or with dessert."
"Very easy drinker, maybe a little heavy for warm weather"
"D_Perfect brown ale. Could drink well into the night."
"The beer is very clean and fresh and obviously brewed with expertise; the finish is exceptionally quenching with soft nuts again and chewy malts. There are no traces of alcohol or off flavors here, and overall you are left with a satisfying nut brown which is excellent on its own or with meaty dinner dishes. I actually love this beer in the summer in the sun. It is great with a picnic filled with hearty sandwiches, dark breads, cheeses and fruit."
"D - This is overwhelmingly drinkable. If they weren't as costly as they are, i'd be downing these more often."
"Go easy on this one - it's 6.2% ABV in a very big bottle. Good for a dinner party, especially if your dinner consists of beef."
"m/d-leaves a full feeling sweetness in your mouth that just leaves you wanting more. thoroughly enjoyed this beer, unfortunately so did my wife and she drank the majority of it. I recommend this beer to anyone."
"A great brew which people should be paying more attention to."
"Overall, I find Rogue can be a little hit or miss, but I really like this beer. Definitely one of my new favorite brown ales. Definitely glad I picked one up."
"Taste: smooth medium body with loads of sweet nutty flavors."
"I was given a bottle of Morimoto Hazelnut Signature Ale at a dinner club, but we didn't get to it so I ended up having it myself. This brown ale has a luscious brown color and fine carbonation. The smell is toasty like a freshly baked loaf of dark rustic bread. The roast malt flavor melded well with caramel and biscuity malt in providing a full flavored and bodied beer. Hazelnut was apparent in the aftertaste and helped to make a well rounded beer."
"I would recommend this beer. I can envision myself drinking these during the cold winters I am snowed in."
"When I saw this bottle with Chef Morimoto on it, and knowing my wife loves hazelnut, I figured I'd pick it up to try. Poured from a 22oz into three glasses that are probably better suited for pilsners, a nice one and a half finger foamy head erupted on top of a nice burnt amber, red highlighted body. My nhose picked up vanilla, oak and malt. There was very little hazel-nuttiness about this beer until I tasted it. Strong hazelnut in the back with not much else going on. I feel the smell was more complex than the actual taste of the beer. It was medium-bodied with medium carbonation and that warming alcohol sensation in the back. It's a kind of nice beer, but not my thing, not something I'd get hooked on."
"D: very drinakble beer evn though it was a little on the sweet side but went really well pair with some crumb cake."
"D=this is very drinkable. goes down easy. very refreshing for a nutty brown ale. Impressive"
"Taste is hazelnut up front, then joined by some sweetish toasty maltiness and light earthy bitterness to balance. It's balanced, neither too bitter nor too sweet, pretty drinkable, and the character is, as said, clean and firm. However, the hazelnut definitely dominates, and too much in my opinion, rendering it rather one-dimensional, so I doubt I'll actually buy it again. Hazelnut to me can be good in beer if it is a slight additional element adding to complexity of a beer that does not overall taste like hazelnut."
"This is alright as a change of pace, but the bomber was too much for me. It just got too sweet and fake tasting."
"Would absolutly love to try on draft."
"22 oz. poured into an Arrogant Bastard pint. 33 IBUs. This brew pours a deep and definite brown with a small layer of head. The aroma is magnificent: dark malts, caramel, brown sugar, and roasted nuts. The taste is even better: loads of brown sugar, toffee, maltiness, caramel, and yes, delicious hazelnut. What a delicious dessert!"
"Beer is medium to light in body and has an almost ash like backward flavor it. Carbonation in the mouth is minimal but the beer is quite drinkable. No aftertaste. All and all its an average uninteresting beer."
"Do your like hazelnut iced coffee? You will like this beer then. Had it on tap at the B. Brown smooth rich and creamy. These unique beers really blow my mind. Its really showing off in a good way and I love it. To brew a beer that tastes like an iced coffee is pretty cool. Skillz... so bold and tasty. For what the brewer is trying to accomplish, I really can't imagine better results. I still have yet to have a Rogue beer I did not enjoy."
"D: At first I thought, ""I don't really think I like this one."" The aroma was far to sweet, and it didn't bring enough nutty flavor to cut through the malt. The longer it sat, though, the more I was able to discern the rest of the flavors this beer has to offer. I would love to see this in stout form with darker malts. It would be like Ferrero Rocher in a glass."
"D - Its medium sweet and not over carbonated. I would call this a great evening beer but not quite a session beer unless you are really into browns. A little sweet for that perhaps."
"D - great. I won't have any problem putting away this bomber. Best brown I've had, I think. Not my favorite style at all (though now I want to try more), but I'd definitely drink this again when the mood strikes."
"Nutty and malty, but not overly thickening. Thinner than the appearance. Kinda tastes like it has oats even though the ingredients say no such thing. Chocolate nuts. Very slight chocolate. A real malt bomb without being thick. Not for hopheads. Always pricey when it comes to these guys."
"This is an extremely quaffable beer and a nice option for a ""bigger"" (while not BIG) beer that allows you to down a few. Nicely done."
"This one is now in my rotation in fridge. Soo good! Kicking my self for not trying it sooner."
"I did enjoy this beer, I would get this if I am in the mood for something darker and flavorful, but doesn't really classify as a big beer for me, in that I could have a few of these and still be ok with it. Very solid."
"The aroma is definitely my favorite aspect, solid Brown Ale overall."
"Pours a brown-amber color with a 1 finger off-white head. The aroma is great. A strong hazelnut rush and a hint of coco. The beer follows the aroma. Rich hazelnut malt is the showcase in this beer. There are also secondary chocolate, caramel and vanilla malts present. Great rich and creamy malts throughout. Light hops show near the finish, but it finishes sweet as the malts take over again. Great creamy mouthfeel and a good drinkability."
"Very good beer. Extremely drinkable brown ale."
"D: A very nice offering from Rogue. Not really suitable for the humid and sweltering day that I drank it on, but it would be a great fall beer."
"D - Very smooth beer, because of the low carbonation is is easily drinkable, the only problem is how sweet it is making it slightly less drinkable, but that isn't too much of a detriment. Could still easily have a few bottles in a sitting."
"D - Pretty drinkable. I could enjoy a few bottles. Very nice take on the nut brown ale with the inclusion of hazelnut extract."
"This is one awesome beer. Very drinkable. Similar to Newcastle Brown and Robert the Bruce. I love this beer. Very good Hazel Nut taste and very smoooth! One of my favorites. Don't let the funky label keep you from buying this beer, it is awesome. Label does say it won an award for best Brown Ale World Champion, and I believe it. A+ rating."
"I'll have it again."
"I enjoyed drinking this beer. It's a dark redish color with tan lace. Very creamy. While drinking I notice a nutty, particular hazelnut taste with a very malty smell. Not too much carbonation. Very sweet, perfect compliment for a dessert. Would definitely drink it again...and again!"
"Final Notes: This beer just isn't really doing it for me, for some reason. I probably won't be buying it again, but it's not a bad beer either. If you're into hazelnut flavored stuff, you'll probably like this beer."
"If not my favorite style, a very nice example. I like what the hazelnut brings to the table."
"a medium to heavy mouthfeel which is what i prefer. this is probably one of my top beers and i could drink this stuff all night every night great job rogue brewery"
"and because of this smell you really expect the beer to have a really sweet taste but it doesnt however it does have a slight sweet taste"
"Drinkability - Very drinkable."
"medium body but very smooth, w/ just a touch of astringency in finish. mild to moderate carbonation gives tingle, lift and creaminess."
"To tell you the truth, I was a little skeptical about this beer. Firstly, I am not a huge fan of hazelnut, and secondly, I thought the beer was going to be to sweet. Since a friend of mine offered it to me, how could I refuse free beer:) Pouring it into a tulip glass, a reddish brown color appearance to fill the glass. Putting the glass to my nose, the aroma was very nutty. I took my first sip and before I knew it, it was also my last sip, because I drank it all in one swig:) It was that good! I was pleasantly surprised because of my previous misconceptions about this brew! This beer will be a mainstay in my frig for a while!"
"Fo me, this would work as a dessert beer or night cap, but otherwise the flavor is a bit too much."
"Dark brown pour with a foamy, 2-finger, off-white head. Lots of toast and nuttiness in the aroma. There is definitely a distinct note of hazelnuts and some floral clover and honey sweetness along with a bit of caramel and hay. The hops add just a touch of spice and pepper to the nose. The flavor again has lots of hazelnut character with hints of toast, cocoa, straw, clover honey, wild flowers, and caramel. The body is a bit thinnish with a little too much carbonation but drinks very nicely."
"This is a great offering -- one of my favorites from Rogue. Nicely complex, it keeps you coming back for more without growing too sweet or heavy. The hazelnut flavor can sometimes tread close to ""artificial", which keeps this one from earning a perfect score on taste."
"D: All a bit too much hazelnut, detracting a bit from the ultimate drinkability of this one, along the same lines as their Chocolate Stout."
" Front side of this ale is a chew on big malts then a blast of roasted hazel nut and black malt roastiness is off set by a judicious amount of woody hopping...finishes lightly drying slightly bitter in a nutty-malty ambience.that lingers into the after taste. This is a nut brown with nuts...or at least nut extract!"
"Carlos Davila"
"Worth a try if you're on a brown ale quest as I have been."
"Drinkability is very good. Great beer that goes down easily."
"D: Very appealing, not too filling, i could drink quite a few of these."
"D - This is a very good beer. I had it with a hickory smoked bacon and blue cheese butter burger and it was a fine meal indeed. I would definitely get this one again."
"Overall, Rogue's Hazelnut Brown Nectar is a very rich and complexly flavored brown ale that is definitely worth trying."
"D - Good. This is a good American Brown ale. Certainly not the greatest, but the ""hazelnut"" component definitely did not disappoint and met all of my expectations."
"I love this beer. I definitely owe the otherwise clueless waitress that suggested this the first time I had it (on-tap). After being told my first choice was no longer available, I went with this because, as she put it ""alot of people seem to be ordering this for some reason"". Not quite as good from the bottle, but still outstanding. This one's a keeper."
"Medium bodied, not much carbonation, and creamy. Good drinkability. I especially like the aroma of this beer. The 6.2 % abv is also a nice change of pace from some of the big beers I have had lately."
"The best part about this beer is when you add other food flavors. I have always enjoyed this beer on it's own but then I addes some buffalo wings for dinner and this beer jumped to an increadiable level. I have now done that with a french dip sandwich as well. Try it you won't be disappointed."
"D- Love, love, love this beer, but I could only drink it occasionally as it's very heavy on the palate. If I got another of these I'd like to have someone around to drink it with to make sure it would be appreciated (and finished!)"
"D - easy drinking ale. Complex and flavorful but not over powering in the least. Solid brew."
"Drinkability: With a good level of complexity and balance, this is a great niche beer in the brown ale category. Definitely worth looking for on a regular basis."
"From the 22 ouncer with no date, lot code, or other identifying note. Sampled on March 12, 2010. The pour is a handome mahogany brown color with decent clarity. The head is silky and tan and about a half-inch thick. The hazelnuts in the brew are evident in the aroma and because of that, it is one of the more unique aromas I have tried. Other than hazelnuts the overall characteristic is sweet and sugary. There is a nice full-bodied texture followed by a prodigious mix of caramel malts, hazelnuts, bread, and maple in the flavor. Bitter hops make a faint appearance but they are overpowered by the sweeter sensations. Rather good."
"Overall an outstanding example of the style."
"D- Great. Gulp, swallow, gulp, swallow...."
"D: This is definitely a nut brown and has qualities that make it unique and worth trying. The flavors really open up, and I would recommend allowing them to do so because the get much better."
"And this beer goes down so smooth and sweet, it makes me want another. Very nice offering indeed."
"D: Hell, yes, this is drinkable. Probably the best American Brown I've had, and you can bet I will have this beer again."
"Pours a light but solid head, a dark brown, caramel coloring. The head dissipates rather quickly, leaving a think layer. Has the smell of caramel, malts, and maybe something like a raisin aroma. Upon tasting it has an excellent, light, solid, but not overbearing nutty brown, malty, caramel flavor. Very satisfying. Enough subtlety to not scare one off, but enough flavor to know its good. Very solid, yet not heavy mouthfeel. More of a sipping beer because of its complexity and quality, but go ahead and put a couple back."
"Pours a clear brown color with a tan head. The aroma is toffee and hazelnuts. The flavor is caramel with hazelnuts. There is also some chocolate in the flavor as well as some light hop bitterness at the very end. The aftertaste is nutty. Medium, semi-creamy mouthfeel and low-medium carbonation."
"D - I may not have it again since I can think of a couple of nut browns that taste better but this one crosses the 6 percent ABV so that might have affected the flavor"
"Pours a clear, brown color. 1/3 inch head of a pale tan. Decent retention and decent lacing. Smells of sweet malt, slight roasted malt, slight chocolate, and grain. Fits the style of American Brown Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, hops, slight roasted malt, slight chocolate, and grain. Overall, a rich and complex beer. Cloying aroma but a nice addition of hops cuts that affect in the taste. I didn't get a lot of nut, but still very good."
"The mouthfeel is silky smooth, and the carbonation is low. I paired it with food, but I think it would have been better on its own. Still, this is a unique, delicious brew. Nice job Rogue."
"Drinkability - Loved the beer, but would have loved to had more detectable aromas. I would wager a second go around would correct this (hopefully) exception to the rule. 4.0/5.0"
"D: Definitely one of the best brown ales I have had. Very drinkable."
"Rogue is my favorite brewery from the USA, I think they do everything right and I think the don't follow trends, they just stick to doing what the do best. Make great beer with an awesome balance. And balance it´s really hard to get in this days, when brewers want to impact dramatically at all costs, sometimes."
"Highly recommended"
"D - Very smooth and pleasant. Easy to go through several pints of this."
"Nice and drinkable. I didn't find the sweetness excessive like some other reviewers, that's just me. A nice comfy brew from Rogue!"
"D - Excellent brew, very drinkable. A great example of a beer that is innovative yet true to the style."
"D/Overall - It's a great beer for sure, but I couldn't do it too often. I'm a hazelnut freak, and I seek out hazelnut ingredients in everything I consume, but this is too sweet to drink all the time. Don't get me wrong, the sweetness is very well balanced and I enjoy it thoroughly, but I'm afraid it could get old over time. Still, this is a great beer for special occasions and entertaining."
"Medium-bodied, maybe a little on the sugary side but not sticky. A real treat, but one is plenty."
"I have experienced some variability in this offering; some are very hazel-nutty, others reveal only faint hints of hazelnut but are significantly more roasty. All were good in any case."
"D: I usually like American Brown Ales, but there's something extra special about this one. The big hazelnut taste only adds to a beer that goes down really smooth. Buying another bottle of this on my next beer run."
"Overall, I was immensely looking forward to this beer and in some respects it disappointed. The charred flavor left an unpleasant bitterness on the tongue with the malt and nut character being overwhelmed. I'm usually impressed by John Maiers exploits but this one was a letdown."
"rogue nation!"
"D - Very high with lower ABV and light body"
"This is simply a wonderful beer. I knew that when my conservative family failed to praise the beer that I had an obvious winner. They just don't know the difference between what is good and what is bad. I am generally not a nut brown fan, but this changed by mind about what could be done. Based on recollection, this one won an award. Deservedly so!"
"D: Every time I drink this I remember why it's such a popular pick. A wonderfully easy drinking beer and great flavors that the beer geek or casual drinker can appreciate."
"excited to try this one. when i had the money to purchase a dessert like beer and i was in the rogue section, hands down im buying the epic chocolate stout, so i was happy when this was brought to our sunday beer taste. appearance was a cloudy dark brown, not too appealing. nose of sweet hazelnut and a grain cereal. taste is crowd pleasing, about what you think in a good way. sweet honey, malt, toffee, walnut. great balance and mouth-feel. can't wait until it's around again"
"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Dark in the room so I'm skipping right to the aroma and taste of this beer. The tastes and aromas are in tandem so I'm reviewing by simply by saying that the malts and hazelnut flavor of this beer are perfect. Not too over the top. Just perfect enough to satisfy and keep you yearning for more. The hazelnut flavor is beautiful. Simply beautiful. Makes me want to buy a bagel and load it with hazelnut cream cheese for a perfect pairing. Exceptionally tasty and easy to drink, sooo smooth, just a really amazing and delicious brown. Awesome."
"Pours to a deep red brown. Aroma is of hops and bits of nutty and caramel notes. Flavor is of alcoholic hazelnut and caramel. These flavors come through other nutty undertones that are not consistent with hazelnut. Really good to drink. Nectar is a good word for it since it is rather godly."
"Final Thoughts: A good beer worth trying, despite it's flaws. Really, I think this would go good with sweeter foods as strange as that may sound."
"Drinkability: At first I thought this would be a drain pourer, however the second sip was better. I will not be buying this beer anymore, however I enjoyed the experience. I love hazelnut however I think it is a bit misrepresented in the beer, almost artificial."
"Very nice stuff."
"All in all, this is my hands-down favorite brown ale. Surly's Coffee Bender is a solid second, but it's absolutely behind this Rogue. Cheers!"
"Drinkability: This is a nicely drinkable beer and easy to finish. Each sip leads easily to the next and I'll be happy to have more. This seems a well made brown ale that goes well with beef or on its own as a dessert. It is also a nice change of pace from run of the mill brown ales that don't have a little something extra to set them apart. I'll be having this one again."
"Mouthfeel was ok, if a bit thin. Carbonation was ok."
"D - It would be a good fall brew, but it's a little too light for fireside sipping during the winter months."
"Yet another flop from what has to be the most overrated brewery in the country. I suspect that Rogue would be out of business if it didn't have such cool bottles! Just my opinion."
"i had the of these bombers this week simply delicious."
"D- It's certainly a dessert beer. Still though I found the last bit of the pint a little tough to get through. I think the sweetness started to get to me."
"I had been holding of on getting this at the store until it was closer to the holiday season. I just wish this looked better, it wasn't unappealing, but it certainly didn't look like something I'd dive after."
"Btw, it is very good with roasted meet..."
"D: Too much bread for me, but an interesting take on the American Brown Ale."
"D: I could drink this one all throughout the day and night. I can see sharing this one with people who don't normally venture much out of the beer aisle of your local grocery store. A nice gateway beer into more greatness out there. Rogue shines again."
"D: Interesting concoction here. It could use some strong flavours besides hazelnut though. The hazelnut flavour does come off as if it was just a flavour shot which is a little off puting."
"Drinkability: A malty beer with an interesting twist that compliments the beer very well; the hazelnut could have been overdone or underdone, but it is well balanced with the brew. I could drink this all day and highly recommend it."
"Drinkability: A really nice brown ale. Pleasingly complex. Another win for Rogue."
"D - i'm not a huge fan of hazelnuts. but this one was better than i expected."
"If you like hazelnuts, then this is a winner. It is a very nutty brown ale, sweet and rich with a good, long finish. Rather one dimensional though. =)"
"D- I've had their hazelnut nectar which I remember loving. I am not sure if this is the same, but I love this Morimoto. Going to try pairing it with food."
"Pours a deep saddle brown with a frothy head that does not stick around. There is visible carbonation and a good amount of sediment floating around, awesome! Caramelized malt is the first aromatic with softer tones of nuts, honey, and alcohol. A very diverse boquet. Creamy goodness across the pallet. Nice and quiet bitter finish to a nutty and sweet sip. The nectar and the nuttiness are all pleasantly present in this aptly marketed brew. The understated flavors in this brew from the coffee to the nuts to the sugars are all in perfect blend and lead to a very modest yet over achieving effort. Great wintertime brew to be eaten with my steak and squash."
"Rogue's Hazelnut Brown is a perfect example of why Rogue is a great brewery. Hazelnut Brown pours a beautiful chocolate brown in a pint glass and fills with the aroma of toasted hazelnut and subtle notes of chocolate and brown sugar. Each sip is a dessert and begs you to have another. A champion beer."
"Not the explosion of sweet nuts that I had hoped for. Still a good brown ale."
"Nutella, this ain't, however, the hazelnut extract offers a nice uptick to the decent base brown ale, in proportions that make it actually quite drinkable, as evidenced by my rapidly emptying glass. Oh, and good thing that I prefaced this all with that disclaimer: I do indeed freaking love hazelnuts, so it's a tad unfortunate that this offering is pushing 10 bucks a bottle 'round these parts."
"Other notes: not much head develops, but what little does, stays for a nice lacing"
"Drinkability: This is a good, complex brew. It's too sweet for my tastes, but a great beer to try on a nice day in San Francisco. I asked the bartender if it was a brown ale, and he said it was. However, this is a style all it's own; a subgenre of brown ale."
"The only other issue I have with this beer is it's price. If it was something truly special, sure, I can see $6.15 for 650ml. When I can get La Fin Du Monde or Maudite for $5.40 for 750ml, I'm having a hard time making that choice."
"other that that it is a very drinkable beer. I've never had a beer like this before, and would probably have it no more than a couple times per year."
"Drinkability: I could see myself buying a bomber of this once (maximum) per year. I can't say the beer is bad, but the sweetness, thin, watery aspects leave a little to be desired. One bomber was enough."
"650ml bottle. Pours a very dark red amber. Smells and tastes of hazelnut. Not bad, not great though. Easy to drink, but nothing special once again. After finishing the last of my bomber bottles of this, I grew more and more disappointed. Won't be buying this again."
"Drinkability is just right. Just the right mix of ingredients allows you to sip on it for hours."
"Overall, an excellent brew from Rogue. They never seem to let me down. Salivating inducing smell coupled with great taste and excellent balance. Despite its higher price, I would definitely buy this one again.. and again."
"taste is creamy and smooth, burnt toffee, brown sugar, nuts, some cocoa, and a little spice, ends tangy, and slightly bitter."
"Another great beer from Rogue."
"-- I don't know if they re-formulated this beer for us Ontario LCBO customers - but this seems a little overrated. Samuel Smiths is much better and cheaper in my opinion."
"Very drinkable and tasty. A great example of a typically tasty style."
"Drinkability: This is a pretty good beer but it could definitely be better, think a bigger Guinness type beer. For the price, taste, and ABV this is only a slightly above average brew but worthy of a drink."
"Solid drinkability on this one, despite the incredibly bold flavors. A bomber of this is definitely enough, but it goes down very easy. This is a very nice brown ale, and a must try for hazelnut fans."
"Drinkability/Overall Review - I love this beer, delicious, I will definitely have this beer again and it is officially one of my favorites. Rogue has done it again!"
"This beer is fantastic and worth every penny. World-class, this is an instant favorite of mine."
"I have to make a slight revision to my review: It's delicious, to be sure, but I found that the sweetness actually got to be a bit overpowering towards the end. I was thrilled at first, but afterwards it began to feel like more a novelty to me. I'm really torn. Can you fault a beer for tasting too good?"
"This is by far my favorite brown ale. I can assure you that you have not had a brown quite like this. Very unique and special. I can't think of one bad aspect about this one. It stands out from the other Rogue big beers to me, along with the Chocolate Stout. SOLID. I also really like the label, mine has the guy raising his fist as if to say ""Hell yes"" unlike the one shown here. One of my favorite Rogue labels."
"I first tried this beer at a fest and was really impressed, as I normally don't go for brown ales. Finally got around to buying a bottle and I still like it. Nice and malty but not overly sweet. Tasty stuff."
"Drinkability: Yes, yes, a thousand times yes.If you're a fan of malt, but not a fan of hops, this is the perfect beer."
"A bit too sweet to make an evening out of. Theres a ton of flavor going on and its very entertaining to sip. Just a bit so sweet that it gets a bit uncomfortable on the tongue after a pint."
"This beer was enigmatic for me. Not a true to style brown ale since it had characteristics common to porters. Overpriced compared to other beers of similar quality. Seems Rogue is trying to be Oregon's answer to Stone Brewing. I vote Stone."
"Cheers!!!"
"This beer pours a dark mahogany colour with average carbonation that leaves a one finger fast vanishing head with subtle lacing,it has strong aromas of hazelnuts and some roasted malts,it has an average mouthfeel with a nice hazelnut,chocolatey taste to it with the hops playing second fiddle in this beer i mean u can taste them but this beer is so perfectly balanced out that nothing in this beer is overpowering yet u can taste everything which makes the drinkability for me high,im so glad i tried this beer and will buy again."
"D: As is obvious, I didn't care too much for this one. Luckily I handled it better than the wife who almost dry heaved on it. This beer reminds me of some watered down, malty version of Frangelico. However, if you like nuts in your mouth, this beer is for you."
"Rogue always has to put their spin onto any beer style and it is no different with the brown nectar, although this is still a fairly approachable beer. Sweet, deep, rich nutty malt flavors are the driving character behind this brew. Aroma's of nuts, particularly hazelnut, as well as light roasted coffee are ever present. A creamy, mouthfeel with so much flavor, yet it is surprisingly refreshing and quaffable as well, a great session beer, even though the ABV is a bit higher than one may like for a session brew."
"Dark brown in color with slight cinnamon head. Aroma of cinnamon, malt sweetness, toffee, brownies, spices, toasted raisin bread. Tartness in a lumberjack match with hazelnut, coffee, and spices. Light carbonation and light mouthfeel. Very sessionable and tasty."
"The mouth is crisp, yet smooth. This is crisp, but it goes down mellow. You can definitely pull the hazelnut out of this beer. Very nutty at the start, but finishes very sweet. Tons of vanilla, syrup, and toasted sugar all over this beer. I like my browns to have a subtle sweetness, but this was a bit over the top. A decent dessert beer, but not my everyday brown."
"Overall - A very nice brew that does exactly as it says on the bottle... recommended.."
"Not outstanding at first impression, Rogue Hazelnut progressively grew on me until it was gone and I wish I had bought more."
"Drinkability: I would definitely have another while hanging with my buddies."
"This is the penultimate beer to have with cheese."
"Unique stuff, one of my all-time faves.."
"Not too complex, it tastes like one would expect Pacman to do with brown and dark malts, but a very drinkable and good beer. Does what it should. Great for a rainy August day in Newport. I'd definitely try it if I came here from out of town."
"D-Great representation of what it says it is. I would have this with vanilla ice cream if I was to pair it with something."
"I'm not a big fan of brown ales, but this is a very easy drinking, pleasant one - especially if paired with the right foods. Enjoyed mine with a terriyaki marinated tilapia, and roasted asparagus."
"Overall, I was shocked to discover this beer had such a strong hop flavor. It was definitely different than your everyday Newcastle, but much better."
"Medium bodied with a somewhat creamy mouthfeel. This is a real treat on tap, very enjoyable and easy to drink."
"d - i could drink ten of these a night if my body would allow it. this is becoming a hands down favorite. dangerously smooth and rich."
"Pours a clear mahogany with 2 fingers of foamy head that settles after a while. Immediately hazelnut hits the nose thanks to the hazelnut ""nectar"" added to this brew, along with plenty of malts. Taste is more of the same with hints of chocolate complimenting the nuttiness. Some bitterness shows up at the end to give a nice balance and keep it from getting sweet. Creamy mouthfeel, and no alcohol is detected. Definitely an approachable and drinkable style that could make for decent recommendation for the less experienced beer drinker. A nice english style nut brown with a little extra going on for a change of pace."
"D- Would have liked a little more hazelnut flavor. Good beer, but nothing that pushed the envelope."
"Scrumptious!"
"The taste? Wow. I'm a hit-or-miss type of guy with nut browns. Many throw an alcoholic taste on the tongue I just don't like for a lighter ale. This beer had no burn in the mouth and went down very easy. Great thirst quencher with a mix of nut and malt. At 6+% alcohol, this is a dangerous beer as it is too easy to drink."
"Pretty good, but I honestly would prefer a Troegs Rugged Trail Ale, which is sweeter and easier to drink."
"Drinkability: this would be a great session beer; I imagine even better on tap."
"This beer poured a dark brown with a very pretty red tinge when held up to the light with a single-finger off-white head. The smell is lots of malt with some nuttiness and candy sugar. The taste is about the best I've seen in a Brown Ale. It's a mellow ride that starts with some caramel malt that gives way to some hazelnut in the finish. The mouthfeel is slightly thick and creamy with a moderate amount of carbonation. This is a very tasty beer with no problems in the drinkability department."
"Drinkability/Final thoughts - Man was this brew drinkable! I wouldn't mind having 3 pints of this wonderfully chocolaty brew on a chilly evening, ahhh. I didn't pick much up besides chocolate covered almonds with hints of hazelnuts in this brew, I definitely would have appreciated more hop character, not so mellow & subtle, and more lively Co2 in the feel. Appearance was lacking as well, leaving no notable lacing, all in all though it was still a good beer, with a low enough ABV to enjoy 2-3 without getting all buzzed out. I recommend it. Cheers!"
"there is a decent chance of this. Will revisit."
"A truly excellent, delicious and uniquely fun beer. Drinkable as long as you can cope with the insane sweetness."
"Not bad but not a fan of the hazelnut beers."
"Drinkability: I could have this again and may. The hazelnut is very prominent and I love the gentle bitterness. The biggest problem I have with this beer is the high carbonation which distracts from a spot on taste. If they mellowed the carbonation some, the drinkability would be higher."
"Mouthfeel is nicely full, very slick. Holds the flavour well. That is an intense beer, so sweet and toasty, so many nice, insane and non-beer-like flavours. Great taste but I certainly couldn't drink that every day. I'm already diabetic but a daily dose of this would make me double-diabetic. Wow."
"Tasted very consistent with when I had it on-tap. It impresses me when this occurs. Especially because the on-tap version(of any beer) usually tastes better to me. I would say pretty much all the same things I said before in my review."
"Taste is super! Nuts pushing through a veil of malts with a chocolate, caramel hint."
"The nose was malty sweet, but not distinctive to any degree. The taste is loaded with roasted malts and the very clear and convincing hazelnut came through from start to finish. There is an ever so slight lightish coffee taste in the background, lots of nutty flavors, with the hazelnut the most pronounced. In what should be the standard among brewers, the bottle lists the ingredients to the beer and there are tons of different malts with two hop varieties present. They even comment on the water used. If only other brewers did the same. The beer is modestly carbonated and slightly light and watery and a bit less substantial than I would have assumed. The mouthfeel is quite light with not much of an aftertaste in either case. This is a good beer, a change up because there aren't that many clear hazelnut varieties out there, but it isn't brilliant, and part of the problem may have been the lightness and watery consistency that left me wanting something more dense and thoroughgoing."
"D - Definitely not a session beer, I could easily put back a few of these."
"D - Oh yeah! There is no trace of alcohol in this beer. It's easy drinking and very tasty. One of my favorite brown ales."
"a brown amber with a nice head and a nose of 'oak chips'. nutty, vanilla with a nice body and mild sweet. quite a simple beer. could see this one being popular with a mild bourbon vanilla style to it. but balance and not excessively sweet candy rich. mild apple acid finish with some bitter. as it gets warmer but not much."
"Strong nutty aroma, not as strong nut flavor. Taste did not jump out at me, and didn't linger either. A little higher carbonation than I prefer. Overall pretty decent though, and I would drink it again if offered. Probably won't be on my shopping list though."
"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass it pours a deep brown/dark red color with a really nice one finger white head. Leaves very little lacing down the glass however. Looks pretty good. Smells pretty good, more nutty than I was expecting but it smells great. Smells nutty, kind of a roasted smell. All together I like it. Taste is fantastic. The nut taste is very apparent but not overwhelming which I think is great. It's not bitter at all and is almost a little sweet. Also has a little roasted taste to it as well. Has a faint roasted/coffee aftertaste too. Very good taste. Mouthfeel is decent, not great but not bad either kind of just right in the middle. Drinkability is good, I could sit down with this one all night. Overall another great beer from Rogue. Probably one of the bes Brown ales I've had."
"The head is close to two fingers of big bubbled, dimpled foam, made from larger bubbles so it dissolves somewhat swiftly, lacing clings well. Clear mahogany brown with red and orange inflections, the thick and full beads easily visible. Extremely nutty nose with, duh, raw, uncooked hazelnuts as well as brazil nuts and cashews, very dry with little room left for the dried orange peels, yeast and powdery dark chocolate, overall if there's a thing as softly textured bitterness here it is. Light to medium-bodied, the carbonation isn't overactive but it is very persistent throughout. Mineral water feel to it, helps keep the nuttiness fresh and raw. On the dry side, any sweetness in the brown sugar, molasses, caramel or dark chocolate more inherent to the definition than immediately expressed. Mutter of apricot, peach fruit. Smooth enough, nowhere as sour as in the nose. The intensity of the nuttiness is interesting but that's it."
"Poured a dark, rich brown with a very thin off white head. Nose is malty, nutty nose with hints of chocolate. Hazelnut upfront and then some maple notes. Mouthfeel was very thick. Excellent brew and so smooth. I love it."
" i am not a big fan of browns, but this one is beyond any usual brown ale. for anyone who knows 'filberts' and enjoys a nice glass of beer, this is a must try."
"A little darker, stronger, and perhaps more bitter than a traditional English Brown ale, though without the hop-presence of most American Brown ales...the prominence of hazlenuts would seem to make this a speciality ale? Delicious however you want to categorize it (unless of course you don't like hazlenuts)."
"D - Not bad at first, but I found this beer to get old pretty quickly. Slightly too blandly sweet and syrupy to drink more than a glass of this at most. Some interesting flavors in there, but I will probably not be returning to this one."
"D- This is a very drinkable beer. A little different than most of my brown ale experiences but in a very good way"
"D - The drinkability is definitely there...but not a session beer...would make for a good dessert...the best Brown Ale I've had to date"
"Drinkability: very drinkable - I highly recommend - not too rich/not too sweet."
"The aroma and flavor on this beer really sets it apart."
"D: I think this bomber will do me, but not bad..."
"D - Just great even as I remembered having it in the bottle before, the nut flavor of the hazelnut makes this one of the best flavored browns.Rogue deserves praise for this -a top notch brown ale, highly recommended."
"Notes: Skip the dessert and grab a bottle of this instead. A great hazelnut brew that makes you smile. I shared this bomber with a couple of friends, and they agree it is a great beer."
"This is a very interesting beer - I've never had anything close to it in terms of nuttiness. It was very enjoyable, but a little too ""nuts"" for an everyday beer."
"This is drinkable unless you don;t like hazelnut."
"Due to the light feel and balanced flavors, drinkability is very good."
"D - A nice sweet brown ale. Nothing to get overly excited about but something I'd drink again."
"This is a great brown ale and makes a fantastic dessert beer as well as being quite drinkable."
"D: A very good brown ale, probably one of the better ones that I have had."
"D- very easy IMO"
"Had this last night while out at a local pizza joint with a buddy. The pour was a nice imperial pint very thin light colored head, nice lacing on the glass as it was drank though. Very nice deep reddish brown color and very clear. The nose on this beer isn't complex at all, mostly malt sweetness no real hop aroma. The flavor of this beer is also toward the sweet side no real hop flavor or bitterness only enough to balance out the malt. Mouthfeel for this right where it should be not thin but not think either. All in all a real nice totally drinkable beer that you could sit and have a few pints of. I will be drinking this again."
"It's unfortunate that my recognition of this flavor is from crappy 7-11 coffee. Overall it's pretty good but not something that I would go seeking out again."
"Medium brown or dark amber in color. Wispy head with some prickle. Mild malt nose. Hoppy attack with a smooth flavor. Reveals a sweetness towards the finish. Almost a caramel like flavor that pops out. Very fresh and hoppy attack but a smooth and malty finish. Very complex for a beer as it has enough going on to be a complex wine. Some sour notes."
"A world class nut brown ale!"
"Nice carbonated light brown, with relatively minimal head. Smells nice and sweet, with caramel, toffee and honey dominating the scent. Taste largely reflects the smell, and is light and a little malty. A little bit syrupy, but tremendously drinkable and a wonderful session brew."
"The mouthfeel is light and esay to put away great session beer."
"D- The texture and subtle but great taste makes this very drinkable. Fantastic beer, one of my favorites from Rogue."
" Sitting in the Portland airport after a visit with my brother, I felt blessed to have a delay and a Rogue bar by my gate. I enjoyed a tall glass of this nectar and decided to get a growler to take home on the plane. I've always enjoyed this particular brew, but that moment at PDX solidified it as a favorite as th beer and I merrily bonded."
"I generally don't like brown ales, but I could find myself getting this again."
"This is a world class beer, especially if you like nut browns."
"I don't know where to place this beer, it's sweet, thick and very nutty. I like this a lot but wouldn't have it too often, it's simply too rich. I will however enjoy this growler till the last drop!"
"Drinkability: An interesting take on a Brown Ale, but the nuttiness is completely overwhelming and just didn’t work with the style. Maybe if you like that sort of thing, this beer might work for you. I really can’t recommend this beer, and most likely will not try it again."
"The feel is so dry and thick, like a light milkshake. Perfect consistency for this style. It's a great, sweet (but not saccharine) beer. Bready and confectionary. Wonderful and nutty."
"Pouring into a pint glass resulted in a nice mahogany colored beer with a very thick, long lasting head - about 3 fingers worth. Very nice, light smell of malts and hazelnuts. Taste was of hazelnuts, not too light, not too strong, with a hint of honey. Was very smooth and disappeared all too quickly from my glass. Would definitely not mind picking up a few more of these"
"D - It's finish is satisfying but a little too sweet to be something that's constantly drinkable."
"Poured dark brown color with medium light brown head that diminished slowly with good lacing. Full hazelnutand roasted malt aroma. Medium to full body with smooth texture and soft carbonation. Good flavor of hazelnut, malt and caramel with medium sweet finish."
"It packs a few surprises and has character. Wouldn't pair with foods so much as leave for drinking after I've eaten. Very refreshing. I've come back to this one, and will again."
"D - Moderate to low drinkability. I find the flavor profile to be somewhat repetitive and the carbonation heavy on the palette. ABV is manageable."
"D: Overall, this is a fantastic beer! It is the complete sensory experience. This is definitely a libation I will keep on hand in the fridge. Highly recommended!"
"The taste, mouthefeel, and overall drinkability make this a must-try. Damn good stuff. I could rifle these back all night."
"The drinkability of this is superb, and the flavor is very rounded. There is little aftertaste left in the mouth, yet an urge to drink more."
"D: A thin-bodied sipper that offers more than adequate character without filling you up."
"purse a beautiful dark brown color with an equally good looking head. really looks good. smell is very unique, strong hazelnut dominates everything else, but has a small cocoa aroma to it. taste is really really good, i mean good. has an earthy taste to it, just rally damn good. easy to drink, im going to be buying more of these"
"Drinkability: Too much sweetness for me to call this one drinkable. On top of that, body is beefier than I'd like. This is a great beer to try, but I wanted to be done with it after half a pint."
"A nice dark brown color withy a big thick light tan head that lasts quite a while. Aroma is slightly sweet,nutty,malty,some maple or maybe brown sugar. Flavor is a nice nutty malt type roast,some toffee,chocolate,hints of grass and vanilla,sweet but not too much,you can even taste that ""free range coastal water"" just right,nicly balanced a very good brown,quite drinkable."
"It's drinkable, I could enjoy a few of these. Not too light, not too heavy. Not porter smooth, but that's not what I'm looking for with a brown."
"Overall, a pretty decent beer. I'm not a huge hazelnut fan, but if you like hazelnut then you'll love this brew. True to the namesake."
"For some unexplainable reason this triggers in me thoughts of autumn. I'm not promising it will do the same for you but with every sniff and every sip comes to mind the harvest, colourful foliage, cooling winds, shortening days and all the comforts of going back inside again. Any beer capable of conjuring this kind of sentimentality certainly impresses me."
"D: This beer has pretty good drinkability if you don't mind the sweetness and, at times, the awkward bitter notes. Not my favorite brown, but I'd recommend it/have another!"
"If I didn't have any anticipation for this to be the best thing to ever grace my tastebuds, maybe I would be rating this higher. Unfortunately, I found myself sorely disappointed that this wasn't actually a Nutella-flavored beer at all, but rather middle-of-the-road brown ale with a hint of hazlenut flavor. Objectively (If it was still possible for me to think of it that way), it's still a quality brew that is worthy of trying. You just have to pretend that ""hazlenut"" and ""nectar"" aren't in the name of the beer."
"M + D + notes: A 'sizeable medium' body, moderately carbonated, just right for this brew. I tend to ignore Rogue with some idea in my head that I'm not a big fan of their brews, though I think their bottling is clever and I don't believe I can name a specific beer they have made that I reviewed poorly or can recall not enjoying. Strange idea, because this is quite nice and certainly recommended."
"Phenomenal drinkability. I wish they had a sixer's of this that I can get locally, it would be a regular in my beer fridge for sure."
"D - Easy to drink, not much to tire of."
"Taste is incredible, love the mild hazelnut flavor but really wish there was more of it. This brew keeps me wanting more, I will definitely be revisiting this one again in the near future...[fifteen characters short] :)"
"A nice easy drinker, lots of nuttiness, some light caramel - almost no hops presence. Smooth drinker, actually a good beer to bridge with for non-BAers; something a little different, well made, and not too bold. A good solid, all around beer."
"After pouring I noticed a nice white/brown head that settled to a thin lace around the drink.The scents coming from the beer were mostly the hazelnut and then some sweeter scents like caramel. The taste isn't what I expected I was looking for something more solid but found this to be a little average. It is a good beer but from the reviews its had I was expecting better. It isn't too strong so you could enjoy this one for awhile. Cheers!"
"EDIT: I'm bumping up the ""smell"" score. After a while of having the bomber out, slowly making my way through it, the room smells absolutely wonderful! That's a plus, for sure."
"Taste is lightly sweet malts, nutty, light cocoa, some earthy hops. Mouthfeel is average, drinkability is very good. Nice medium dry bittersweet finish. Very nice pour highly recommended beer."
"Even @ 6.2% ABV I could drink more than one pint of this nectar any day I could lay my hands on it. A must try brew."
"D - One bomber is plenty. Would be a great pairing with some kind of caramel-coffee type of dessert....or, pair it with a burger or a steak. Doesn't surprise me that Morimoto would affix his name to this, as this appears to be a very versatile food beer."
"EDIT: On tap this is even better because of the silky texture. Not sure how common it is on draft, but the Yardhouse in Scottsdale, AZ had it."
"This one has been on my list to get for a while but though it is readily available I have passed on it but was able to give this one a try the other day on tap. Brew was poured to a nice medium dark brown clearish (guess that is not a word but I am going with it!) brown color with a smallish (not sure how long this has been on tap but Mahars usually has pretty good turnover) light tan head. The aromas where inviting, roasted malt and chocolate came to the forefront with some roasted nut (hazelnut I suppose from the title) aromas present. The flavors seemed to be a bit more chocolaty than hazelnut but a nice mix. The one knock that I guess I would have against this brew is it seemed a little watery but over all I did enjoy it, easy going down. Would get it again."
"A great nutty beer!"
"The creamy thick head and deep brown body truly is a work of beer art. The smell is rich and nutty with hints of toffee and a slight alcohol bite. The taste is smooth and nutty with yet more hints of caramel and shares many characteristics of hazelnut flavored coffee. The finish is remarkably clean. The aftertaste has a bit of bitterness and slight alcohol that leaves the palate clean and ready for more."
"There's quite a bit of heft to this beer, which makes it a little less than quaffable, but it is a pleasure to drink. Tasty stuff."
"Fairly drinkable, but the rich flavor combined with the lighter mouthfeel lefe me wanting more of a lasting impression."
"Although it is a dark-colored beer, I imagine it as a good summer thirst-quencher with its strong citrus taste."
"D: Not bad. If not for the slightly off puting fake flavor it would call it good."
"Overall, I really liked this and will buy it again and again."
"Nice smooth creaminess. The contrasts are excellent. Like I said before, perfect balance. I think this is a phenomenal brown ale."
"Pours a black/dark brown colored body, with nearly no head, tan in color. Chocolately, nutty aroma, and slight coffee. Has a taste of chocolate, nuts, coffee. Coffee aftertaste. Kind of watery. Reminds me of a porter."
"Nice, solid brown body with a one-finger off-white head... hardly opaque, with the faintest light at the glass's bottom... light, almost nonexitstent aroma--some malts, but otherwise nondescript--on purpose? mellow, softly nestling effervescent in the teeth... presence is substantial... chewy, definitely nutty... surprsingly 33 IBUs as the hops are not up front... pleasantly flavorful with a malty breath late... ""Pacman Yeast""? I love a beer that proudly displays its ingredients... having had a run on browns over the holidays, I had to sample this, and the results were as expected--solid with a twist of Rougish flair, hazelnut coffee evoked..."
"This is pretty drinkable, and at 6.2% almost sessionable. Well worth a try for fans of brown ales. It would be fun to try this against Fat Squirrel from NG. Glad to have had a chance to try this, it is certainly something that i will look forward to revisiting."
"Flavor is like the smell... malty nuts. Also get some caramel. Really nice smooth and somewhat creay mouthfeel. I would say this is drinkable but due to the heaviness it would be more drinkable in the colder months for sure."
"D: this is too sweet and too much hazelnut for me to really drink more than a bomber, a tasty beer, and a definite dessert beer, but that's really about it for this cowboy."
"A really good offering from Rogue once again. Not something I will drink all the time, as I prefer several of their other beers, but definently worth the price. Very well made."
" This is easily one of the best Versions of a Brown ale I've had, only about a handful of Brown ale's really stands out in my mind and this is right near the top."
"body is thin, but with a nice aftertaste, decently drinkable, but I have to say just ok for a brown"
"Pours a very nice deep brown color, with some good initial head, but almost no lacing. Nice deep scent, very malty and earthy, a slight nuttiness to it as well. Excellent taste, rich and malty with good hop undertones, a nice earthy flavor with a nice little bit of hazelnut to it. Goes down very smooth, a wonderful Ent draugth."
"Mouthfeel is extremely smooth, light bodied. Has somewhat of an oily character to it. This beer is drinkable, yes, but only to a certain extent. It begins to wear very sweet towards the end of the glass (for my tastes) and it's much less enjoyable. That's basically the only complaint I have for this brew. Aside from that, it's delicious, refreshing, and perfect to sip on for dessert."
"Not as good as I remember, but refreshing nonetheless."
"Very nice offering, but not the best session beer for me."
"I'll definitely be revisiting this beer (hopefully whilst it is a bit chilled)."
"D- Very good, however I had a 22 ounce bottle and I think that may be enough. Not a beer I would ever want to session with, but definitely a great dessert beer"
"The first thing you notice whether you're getting this on tap or pouring your own from a bomber is that huge smell. I grew up in a town with a lot of filbert (hazelnut) farms and this thing takes me back to my childhood with that aroma, nothing else permeates the smell. The mouthfeel is sticky and creamy and very sweet but not annoyingly so. This is the best brown ale I've ever had, and I am super craving one at this very second."
"7/4/7/4/14 (3.6/5)"
"D - This was a great beer by Rogue, and a key addition to a style which I love, a great beer in both the bottle and draft"
"Mouthfeel - Although rich in flavour the beer is light and feels thin / watery & smooth. Lightly carbonated."
"The smell really makes this beer, not just the pleasantness but it is quite strong and the most powerful characteristic of the beer."
"D: I liked it, but didn't think it was remarkable. However, my brown ale palate is underdeveloped. I will definitely try it again and see if my appreciation changes."
"The flavor of this beer is unreal. Sweet malt, sugary, vanilla, caramel and all things delicious. I don't normally like brown ales but this is probably the tastiest beer I've ever had."
"D-Absolutely wonderful. Not overpowering, not too sweet. It suits me as a desert type of beer that I would have after a hearty meal."
"Draft at Yard House San Diego. Pours dark, dark brown with no head. Aroma of coffee and hazelnuts. Taste is smooth and sweet, with the obvious hazelnuts. Backed with coffee and roasted malts flavors. Tastes like a carbonated coffee with hazelnut creamer. Decent enough to have again."
"Pours a nearly opaque chocolaty brown with a thick, fine-bubbled tan head. Strongly malty aroma has undertones of chocolate and molasses. Rich, thick flavor has a firm tone of molasses and hints of unsweetened chocolate and roast coffee. Texture is smooth and thick, almost like fizzy milk. Excellent!"
"Drinkability: While I like the taste, I don't think I could drink much of it. I'm splitting the bottle with my friend and I think that's enough for me. Too much nuts to drink in excess."
"Good starter beer for the novice ale drinker, but not for someone who enjoys hops."
"Overall has to be one of the best nut brown ales I have every had a chance to wrap my lips around."
"Overall a great beer. Drink on!"
"you have to seek this beer ..worth a try"
"Flavor - Same hazelnut flavor as aroma. Good malt backbone. Hops take a back seat. Medium carbonation and medium weight. This beer has good balance between the flavor components and is very drinkable."
"Pours a nice chestnut brown with an almond colored head. Aroma is dominated by the hazelnut but also has a nice amount of maltiness and other nuts. This is one of the smoothest drinking beers that i've ever had. The sweetness of the hazelnut made me want to guzzle this beer down but I took my time as best as I could. There is a nice amount of maltiness and a slight hoppiness added to th wonderfull sweet hazelnut flavor. A slight watering down makes this beer not quite perfect. Otherwise, absoluelty delicious."
"Mouthfeel is slightly creamy. Substantial without being heavy. Well carbonated. A highly sessionable ale. Wish I had another bomber."
"drinkability is good. nicely balanced, with the alcohol hidden very well. the nutty character compliments without overpowering. i've had this a few times over the years and just finally got around to reviewing it. good stuff that i've always enjoyed."
"This beer poured a deep brown with a 1-finger, tan head. It smelled like caramel, hazelnut, and a hint of caramel. The taste was all malt with hazelnut and chocolate notes. No bitterness here and hard to detect hops. Felt a little thin, but I'm used to thicker beers. Definitely a drinkable beer. Not so high in alcohol, and not filling. There's enough going on with this beer to keep your interest."
"This is one of my favourite brown ales. The complex flavours and aromas keep you guessing while you're drinking the beer, and this is better than most English and Canadian browns that I've had. I'll be buying this often over the winter."
"Smooth, nutty. Malt start, then the nuts followed by a short hop finish. A very well-rounded nut ale. Medium-bodied."
"One of My favorite Brown Ales. This was the first Rogue beer I had the pleasure of tasting. This beer has a fantastic aroma - hazelnut, caramel, chocolate. Very smooth nutty flavor and a clean malty finish. A very well balanced brew. If you are a fan of Brown Ales you must try this one."
"The only reason this review was so late coming was because I couldn't think of enough good things to say about this beer it is my all time favorite out of all the brews I have drank and the list is probably 350 plus beers (not bragging)just stating the truth I always return to this because it is so good what can I say out of 1-5 this is so over the top it s a 10, try it and you will seee, nuff said!"
"Hazelnut has always been one of my favourite sweeter flavours, so there was never any doubt that this would be a winner for me. Rogue do carry it off with aplomb though. They have made sure that this is not simply a one-dimensional beer, and they have crafted a mouthfeel that is excellently suited to the flavours that they're serving up. This is perhaps an ideal follow-up to a savoury dinner, although it is good enough to stand on its own. Another winner."
"Tasting Notes: Some light hop character, hazelnut tones, as well as some light hints of chocolate. Maybe a dash of maple. Came highly recommended by a colleague of mine. Extremely drinkable."
"One 22oz is enough for this one though, good flavor, glad I tasted it, not something I would drink on a regular basis."
"This beer pours a deep brown with a huge tan head, head retention is pretty decent. There is also heavy lacing throughout. The scent is semi sweet with a little nuttiness and some chocolatey notes. The taste was of light chocolate and a semi-bitter/hazelnut finish. A mostly light bodied beer with a smooth creaminess in the mouthfeel. This is a very good brown ale, and was perfect for a crisp autumn evening. I could sit down with this for session!"
"Nectar might be the exact word I would use in describing this beer. A chocolatey, maple syrup, ""nectar"" that tastes very similar to a Porter. Head definitely follows the two-finger rule and shows a brownish-yellow color. Appearance in the glass in dark brown and lovely looking. The taste is great. Maple, chocolate, and hazelnut with a sweet coffee tasting finish and after taste. It is very smooth and easy to drink. My only problem would be drinking a lot of this beer. It is very rich and a little too sweet. However, I am drinking a 22 oz bottle and it is just what the doctor ordered! I couldn't choke down much of this beer because it is soooo thick. Very good beer though."
"D- brown ales haven't always been my favorite, but combined with hazelnut and some good solid hops, this version really appeals to me and would kick some serious ass when paired with anything containing toasted nuts or seeds. or even chocolate for that matter."
"All in all, this is a pretty good offering by the guys from Rogue brewing. I like this brew a lot better than the Dead Guy ale, although the little skeleton on the Dead Guy ale does look cool and remind me of Mictlantecuhtli..."
"The hazelnut is distinctive but is accompanied by its friends; honey and smokey. The hop oils dominate the experience, but each sip sneaks in another element to puzzle over."
"D- I could drink this for breakfast lunch and dinner. I love this beer"
"I really wanted this to taste fantastic and was disappointed, especially with the price factored in. I wouldn't buy this again."
"This is a fantastic brown ale. This will continue to frequent my fridge. Rogue is making it harder and harder to decide which bomber of theirs I will walk away with at the store."
"Light brown, with orange/tan head. Sweet smell. Maple syrup or molasses maybe. Taste is a bit of the same. Some sweetness and a little of the spices that I associate with fall (pumpkin pie, etc) Caramel as well. I bought this from a store whose stock I have found is usually a bit old. That might be the case here. It is still drinkable and smooth, but not exceptional."
"A great beer, definitely a worthy addition in your beer fridge."
"D: A very drinkable beer. A great, smooth taste with a pretty complimenting mouthfeel. I would bet that this beer would be amazing on cask and hopefully I will get to experience it one day."
"D - Odd tasting combination. It's ok, but not something I would recommend."
"Drinkability is excellent! It goes down very easy, does not taste very alcoholic at all. The flavor is just complex enough to keep you interested, but easy enough to slam a pint at the same time. This is the third or fourth time I've had this beer, and it is quickly becoming one of my staples."
"Very good drinkability. Doesn't seem to get to be sweet and the hazlenut is a nice change of pace. My girl absolutely loves this beer."
"D - All night and all day"
"Notes: This is a heavenly Brown Ale."
"Thin mouthfeel, an easy drinking beer, I don't know what all the fuss is with this beer, I thought it was an OK brown ale, that's it."
"With its liquor-like sweetness and great melding of hazelnut extract with a balanced blend of sweet-roasted malts and s bit of spicy bitterness, this is one world class brown ale. Very nice."
"It is extremely cool to get a pronounced chocolate taste from a lighter beer like this. Extremely good, best on the menu in Philly. Matches very well with the middle and end of the meal, just enough flavors to be complex, but not enough totally dominate the palate."
"This is a fantastic beer. Sweet but not cloying at all, like a deliciously indulgent chocolate desert. Its packed with flavor."
"I tasted this with a buddy during a brew session and we both agreed on this as a 5.0. It's widely available always good and very unique. You have to try this one! A job well done by the folks @ Rogue! And thanks to CurtDoggYo! for the tasting sponsorship!"
"D- Nectar, this is. And it drinks like a nectar. Quite refreshing"
"Great new take on the English brown ale style. Not the most complex brew, but really tasty. Try some now."
"A leather brown body with hints of ruby tints when held up to light. Good carbonation leads to a two-finger head that dies ever so slowly and leaves some sticky lace. Great malt smell, mostly sweet, with hints of toasted malts in the back. Medium-bodied and ever so creamy, this is one damn smooth and sweet tasting beer. It slides over the tongue and gives off all kinds of sweet malt flavors like hazle, chocolate, maybe something like caramel or honey, and it has a nice, dry roasted malt backbite that is subtle. Hops not really noticeable but it doesn't matter. This is a great beer."
"I think I could grow to like this. Not an every day beer but certainly fitting now that the cooler weather arrived. If you haven't tried Rogue yet - keep an eye out as this one won't let you down. I guarantee towards the end of your drink you'll be thinking only two words: yum, yum."
"Very drinkable, even with all the flavour I can drink a few of these."
"This is a fine, fine beer from one of my favourite brewers."
"Wow what a nice surprise. Something different and enjoyable. This tastes a bit like hazelnut ice cream to me. It's sweet but not sickly I'm an instant fan. I wish I could find this on tap locally. A thick creamy head and a delicious flavour. I am in love with how smoothly this goes down. Sadly it will probably not come back to the LCBO once this shipment is gone."
"Drinkability- This is excellent and drinkable and it is a pity that I never see this on tap anywhere with the amount of tap handles I find around here."
"The nose on the beer is really sweat chocolate, like the taste of a chocolate wafer. There is also a small presence of the usualy maltiness from a brown ale. The beer is a very dark red/brown, with a good sized head and decent retention; a bit of lacing as well. The taste of this beer is like a beefed up version of the nose. It has the awesome chocolate wafer flavour mixed with a some more bitter chocolate flavours. The taste is quite sweet, but the bitterness balances it really well. The beer is middle of the road for mouthfeel, could be a bit thicker to go with the flavour. Somewhat drinkable because of the sweetness."
"Overall it's another solid beer from Rogue. Worth a shot."
"Very unique beer but not one I would drink much of. Great for tasting diversity in beer."
"Tastes nutty, sweet and malty. There's a element of spice in the background. Mouth-feel is a bit creamy and medium-bodied. It has a perfect thickness to it that leaves it drinkable, yet hearty. The carbonation is pretty active and keeps things lively throughout the life of the drink. I am in love, and cannot believe I have waited so long to ask this beauty for a dance."
"Mouthfeel is very very good. Low-ish carbonation, no acrid zing. There's a definite nuttiness to it, nicely accented by sweet dark malt and baked bread flavours and some medium roast bitterness. Light floral hops in the background. Very very mellow, almost no bitterness. This stuff is dangerously smooth and easy to drink."
"D: Tasty if you're ok with the sweetness, goes down easy, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, this is a nice beer to drink if you want a brown ale with some extra flavor than most have."
"Poured a very light brown, even close to an amber color, with a big, tan-colored, fluffy head that took its sweet time bubbling down, plus thick waves of carbonation running up the side of the beer. Looked tasty, smelled tasty too. There was obviously the hazelnuts, but there was also some other roasted dark malts in there, maybe some chocolate or coffee, plus a soft touch of sweetness. The taste was excellent: as you would expect, there was plenty of nutty taste, but the beer was overall very well balanced. I could pull out dark, roasted malts in addition to the lighter nut flavor, plus toffee sweetness, and a splash of bitter hops. The beer was creamy and smooth. I drank a large bottle and still wanted more. All around a solid beer that I would recommend as a notch above most other brown ales out there."
"This is the first time I have had this from a bottle, I like it from the tap better."
"This is probably one of my favorite brown ales. The hazelnut is a great touch. Recommended."
"I'll look for more of this."
"D- Haven't really had this kind of hazelnut in a beer before so that's unique. At 6.2% it's not terribly sessionable, but I could maybe have it again."
"I love this beer. This was the first time that I had it on tap. It was a very dark brown color and almost seemed a little hazy to me. The scent is delicious with a mildly sweet and flavorful burst of hazelnut. The taste is superb with a hazelnut; it doesn't have the artificial flavor that accompanies too many brews with added flavorings. My only complaint is that as you drink more and more the velvety hazelnut loses some of its sweetness."
"Very drinkable, a little different, but it works."
"Anyone who wants to understand how American microbreweries reinvent styles should look at this as Exhibit A. Samuel Smith's Nut Brown (which is basically the standard-bearer for the style) is clean, crisp, and balanced in every way. Conversely, Rogue's interpretation of the Brown Ale is sweet and unrefined. If it's slightly less successful, it certainly gets points for being much riskier."
"D: Perhaps a tad sweet to go over a 4, but it's still pretty darn quaffable. The last few Rogue beers I've had have really knocked my socks off--I'm ready for some more!"
"D - Man, I could easily knock these down one after the other. It drinks so easy: great flavor, light body, abv isn't too high...A very tasty, very sessionable brown ale, to say the least."
"Drinkability: Where had this Brown Ale been all this time? I'm sorry I passed up on this beer so many times. I won't do that anymore. It's nothing short of a great chocolately nutty beer. This is one of the better Brown Ales I've had so far. If you like hazelnuts, chocolate, and a little coffee in your beer, then you'll want to try this winner from Rogue."
"D- a good tasting American Brown Ale and well worth a try."
"Extremely smooth, lightish-medium bodied and savory, this fine brown ale has terrific drinkability and feel."
"Pours a dark brown, with zero head. I thought the beer would be completely flat. Smell is of toffee. Taste is malty, with hints of coffee, cola, citrus, and of course hazelnut. The aftertaste leaves a minty, earthy hop aroma. There is also a somewhat interesting sourness to the beer. Mouthfeel is somewhat thin, carbonation levels are surprisingly high considering the appearance. Pretty drinkable, but I probably wouldnt drink more than one bomber at a time. A good brown ale in the American style, that I would buy again."
"drinkability - Easy drinking beer, would drink it again....maybe with a donut this time lol."
"D: Good. I like some bitterness, even in my Brown Ales, but the sweetness never approached cloying territory."
"D - Great with or for dessert."
"Poured into a pint glass and got a thick white head that was pretty thick and covered a dark crystal clear amber body that had some mild carbonation in it; the head eventually thins out, but maintains a thin even carpet of bubbles with some thick lacing. It has a strong brown sugar and caramel smell to it, along with some wheat and sweet bread smells to it; there is also a very slight tart smell of raisins to it. It has a smooth semi-bitter taste and is sweet all around; there is some mild hazelnut and hops mixed in as well as some maple syrup flavors and a hint of coffee in its aftertaste and some prunes too. It has a medium body that's very satisfying."
"D - Easy to drink several of these"
"This beer pours a cloudy red-brown. The head is beige, thick. It smells strongly of hazelnut and there are obvious hints of caramel and malts. The taste is prominently nutty with an ample flavor of toasty hops; somewhat sweet with a slightly bitter aftertaste. The mouthfeel is thick, buttery, and smooth. This is a drinkable beer but is rather thick and rich. Overall, delicious."
"Not too excited, but a good beer. Not my style, so this will probubly be my only one."
"22 oz bomber. Really great amber-brown pour settles into a dark brown, slightly amber drink. Patchy lacing on the sides and overall creamy head. Aromas had a sharp, icy hints of chocolate, hazelnuts, cinnamon, toffee. Really rich and enjoyable to sniff. Taste is as good as it smells with a sharp aftertaste of the above ingredients. Good carbonation gives it a dry finish mixed in a creamy, milky-like texture. Overall, really, really good."
"The taste is very balanced on the tongue. The mouthfeel is a bit creamy, elegant chocolate, sweet sugary nuts, with a crisp carbonation that leaves you wanting more. This is a great session beer solid and very balanced."
"Looking at some of the other rankings, I feel like I'm doing this brew a disservice... I truly enjoyed it and thought the scent and taste were excellent, but a little subdued... I wish the scent and taste would have had a little more punch to it... That would have put it over the top..."
"D - It's a medium bodied beer that goes down smooth and it's very enjoyable. I imagine that I could probably drink a couple of the 22ozs. with no problem."
"D: A fun and tasty beer to drink. Easily drank this bomber and looking forward to more. Nice flavors."
"RJR"
"D: Incredibly enjoyable and very pleasant to drink. A fantastic example of what a brown ale should be. Highly recommended."
"MF&D - Smooth and creamy. Easy drinking for such a medium/full bodied ale. I admit, I'm a huge brown ale fan, and this one is top notch. Due to the sweetness of this ale, I'm not sure it would make a good session drink, but then again I only had 1 bottle and it went down with great ease. I definitly need to get some more, much more of this stuff."
"D - Wish I got to drink more. Too bad though..."
"D: This is an AMAZING beer to go with food. The rich, big taste will hold up very nicely against many dishes. I am not sure that it would make for a good ""session"" beer, since I had a hard time finishing a 22 oz. bottle in one sitting. However, I will be drinking this in the near future, probably with a good roast chicken and mashed potatoes dinner."
"Very impressive hazelnut character, mild and unobtrusive but inarguably present, it's a very nice piece of balancing work done by Rogue."
"Really enjoyed the beer and it made an impression on me. Normally stick with darker beers but this went well with food and alone as a desert beer. Recommend."
"D - very good. This is one dessert beer I could drink all day. It's truly unique."
"Nice nut brown color with a tan head. You can definitely smell the hazelnuts in it. I was floored by the hazelnut and roasted malty combination. Slight maple syrup flavor as well. all of this is ballanced with some nice noble hops. I had given up on brown ales as being to boring, but now I an prompted to go out an brew one for myself."
"This beer smells like liquid nutella when it warms up. The nuttiness also comes through in the finish which has a hoppy dryish finish. This is a solid brown ale that has some real nuances in its flavours. Would love to have this with some BBQ or some baked beans."
"Really a nice brown ale from Rogue. A unique version of the style well done."
"Definitely recommended."
"One of the most nutty nut browns I have tasted. Can't chug it, but wouldn't want to. The bomber is enough to share, but, again, wouldn't want to. This beer is deliciously nutty and I will gladly polish it off."
"D: Sorry to harp on the word 'smooth, 'but this is one easy drinking, tasty brew. I could easily take down a bomber or two of these puppies. Among the best brews from Rogue, hands down. Right up their with the three stouts and double IPA (which freaking rocks on tap, btw)."
"D: Good end of meal beer. It's like that amaretto aperitif. I think the hazelnut would wear me down if I had more than one bomber in a seating."
"D'ability - Might be a bit too sweet, but an extremely smooth, pleasant beverage."
"notes: good brown ale with pleasant hazlenut smell and an excellent appearance."
"D: One of the better bottled ales from Rogue, in my opinion, definitely one I'll have again at some point."
"D: It is mighty tasty. You can get in over your head like my buddy did during last years Magic City Brewfest. He never left the Rogue vendor and almost got sick off the combination of sweetness and the heat. Still a great beer, but not meant for heavy drinking. Savor this one, people."
"Our table was fairly evenly divided over this one -- either loved it or hated it. I gave it a robust ""Good Lord!"" upon first sip. It definitely drinks stronger than the 6.22% ABV that it is. Flirts with the possibility of being too sweet, but the folks at Rogue yet again pull off something that otherwise shouldn't really work."
"D- I think the drinkabilty is pretty high, I usually only have one or two at a time so I haven't used in a session. I think its a rather interesting beer and try to pick up when I can."
"Notes: It could be a tad less sweet,but other than that no complaints."
"Motuhfeel is great, smooth and crisp. But it's a hard one to keep drinking."
"MF/D: Decently solid, nice carbonation. It's not the greatest beer to hold in your mouth, certainly not the worst. But it goes down beautifully, and is extremely drinkable. Very well balanced, and a must to try. (For an interesting beverage, ask for a black and tan with this and their chocolate stout!)"
"I will also mention that it is a perfect accompaniment to my Sunday afternoon Italian sausage with peppers, onions, and lots of mustard."
"D - Extremely drinkable and easy to spend an afternoon with a case of the stuff, nice."
"This poured a dark hazy brown with almost no head. It had a unique scent of malt and hazelnut, with a flavor to match. It had a little hops bitterness and tasted a bit dry in the aftertaste from the hazelnut. It had a decent texture with no carbonation, but nothing else to it. This was an interesting and unique beer, and overall pretty good."
"A very drinkable brown ale. The roasted charcoal flavors are well balanced against the caramel flavor, and bitterness is low. A nice brown ale, that would have again."
"Mouthfeel is a lighter and creamier body than what I would expect. Nice surprise there. Not my favorite for the style, but a pretty good one none the less."
"I really like this beer. A smooth and great tasting beer. I highly recommend this one."
"I've only been trying ""microbrewery"" beers for about a year. However, this is one of the best I've had so far. A definite must try!"
"D-A superb ale with a great all around flavor. I will definitely be buying this in the future."
"Poured into a pint glass from a 22oz. bottle. The beer pours a dark copper, forming a 1 inch thick creamy tan head, and light spots of lace on the glass. Aroma is completely dominated by the hazelnut and roasted malts. Nothing else is detectable. The taste is the same, and just as delicious. Roasted malts, coffee, and tons of hazelnut flavoring. Smooth thick mouthfeel. Exceptional flavor, not too high alcohol, and smooth finish amount to a highly drinkable brew. Overall, I have loved this beer ever since I had it on draught at the Flying Saucer. Incredible and unique flavor. Irresistable!!!"
"Review from notes. Poured into my Rogue pint glass. Dark brown body with a beige head. The aroma has an obvious hazelnut note drifting above sweet and roasty malt. Flavor is much the same, with roasted barley and chocolate setting the foundation for a rich nuttiness that is thankfully not overpowering. Dry finish, smooth on the palate. Really easy to drink."
"D: Good drinkability, perhaps best as a desert style beer. As a brown the hazelnut offers extra layering and complexity delivering a sweet extra something that works perfectly with the malting. Very worthy try."
"I'm naturally suspicious of brown ales - that they will be thin in both body and taste (not to mention spirit), but Rogue's inspires me to keep the faith. Hopefully more American brewers will take on the brown ale challenge."
"22oz. bottle from Manny Brown's Bensalem - Wow....love this beer. the Hazelnut flavor is perfectly balanced in this american brown ale. I reccomend this beer to people who are afraid of trying darker beers, and it has always gotten a good response. This is a brown ale that I rarely get tired of..."
"A smooth medium bodied Brown, that is as sessionable as any ale could be....a must try for this style."
"Verdict: Very nice ale. Smooth, drinkable and the hazelnut is a nice perk. I can't believe I waited so long to try this one!"
"If you like dark beer and Frangelico liqueur then this beer will do you right. Pours to a thin off-white head and hazy, dark brown color. Aroma is sweet and nutty. Flavor is a complementary blend of hazelnut essences and a well-made brown ale: Starts with chocolate and bittersweet (hop contribution?) malt notes fading to a nutty aftertaste that reminds me of Frangelico and cocoa. Finishes roasty and nutty. Really good choice for hazelnut fans."
"Dislikes: limited availability :)"
"Overall this is one of my favorite brown ales. Thanks Rogue."
"Overall drinkability is pretty good, a well rounded brew, very well balanced. Unfortunately, I was hoping for a distinct hazelnut taste, and I felt it was a little underwhelming. But still quality."
"Served in a nonic. Pour was a translucent mid-colored brown with ruby highlights when held up to the light. Quarter-inch head settled into a thin skim of foam almost immediately; zero lacing present during the tasting. Strong scents of hazelnuts and brown sugar out of the bottle, but mellowed considerably in the glass. Flavors similar to nose, but much less intense. Hazelnut flavor detectable at finish as well as a hint of wheat. Well-balanced mouthfeel with a touch of carbonation and a smooth finish; alcohol was well-hidden. A solid session brown, but there are better examples out there."
"Maroon brown pour with a light tan head. Slightly transluscent but hazy. Smell is definitely big on hazlenuts with a lot of sweetness, and milkiness coming in as well. Smells like the hazlenut coffee creamers. Nice slightly thick body on the beer, smooth, and sweet nuttiness. Perhaps a bit overly sweet, but the big nutty flavor was welcomed. Nice for a brown, and pretty easy drinking."
"Smell has sweet caramel note with nice mix of hazelnut and roasted malts. Taste is at first nutty, transitions to a brief note of dry hops and finishes with a strong roasted malt backbone--lacking in complexity though. Smooth with a nice mouthfeel. Another strong showing from Rogue."
"D- Superb drinkability, well balanced in the caramel/toffee notes with the roasted, wholemeal flavours.A superb brown ale!"
"After smelling this beautiful lookiing dark ale, i was taken abit aback by the strong beer smell. The chocolate on tap was overpoweringly chocolate, this hazelnut is faint, beer overpowers it. The color is great, nice dark rich brown and oddly clear. I have to say i was a bit dissapointed in the strong bitter taste and mild hazelnut flavor. Unfortunately, the burnt taste i was afraid of was here. Id give it another shot, on tap if i can, or maybe a more fresh one. I suspect that the place i got it, not only overcharges, but may not sell alot of them."
"This Beer pours a dark brownish Red tinted dark color. Very clear no haze, with a light brown head, almost no lace. Very wood like chocolate tastes hit me right away with a wood/coffee finish. Delicious and smooth. I really enjoyed this beer. I am fairly new at this but so far hands down my favorite Brown Ale so far. Medium Body & feels pretty light. The sophisticated flavors make this more of a beer to savor but still very drinkable. Maybe Not a session beer. But what Great beer is?"
"That being said, this beer is extremely drinkable for a rather complex brew. I wish this would come in a six pack, I'd have no problem paying 13-14 bucks for it."
"This beer pours a beautiful dark brown color from the bottle with a nice thick tan colored head that laces the sides of the glass moderately. The aroma is strongly of raosted malts and hazelnut. The roasted malts have an almost chocolatey flavor that is behind a big bold hazelnut flavor that is really enjoyable. The mouthfeel is excellent with the right amount of smoothness to it and the drinkability is also very good. Definately worth a try."
"Rogue Ales Brewery really knows how to brew a good beer. I have yet to be disappointed from them. This beer has an almost overwhelming aroma and flavor of hazelnut which finishes with lighter flavors of coffee and chocolate. No complaints about this brew."
"overal, thnis is a truly great beer"
"Overall a a great beer and cant wait to pair it at my next beer tasting. Thanks Rogue."
"will definitely have this one again"
"Picked up this bomber @ Albertsons of all places. Poured into a snifter a dark brown color, light tan colored head, light lacing. Some aroma hops are easily detectable, as is the expected hazelnut smell. Taste is, as you would expect, very nutty, much like a latte with hazelnut syrup added. Some choclate & coffee notes accentuate each other nicely. Smooth mouthfeel, a bit dry on the finish. Very well rounded and solid ale with a unique flavor."
"Without a doubt, one of the better brews that I've sampled from Rogue... Their Hazlenut Nectar is everything an American Brown Ale should be and more... Great dark, ruby-red, brown appearance with minimal frothy head... Smell was what was expected, full of nutty, bready, aromas, with dark nuances... Terffific toffee flavor, with a distinct hazlenut, dark-coffee, dried-fruit, fig, nutty flavor that really hit home and was very powerful and pleasing without being overbearing or cloying... just about perfect taste with an exceptionally smooth, velvet mouthfeel, very creamy, nutty, and rich, near-perfect drinkability, went down like sugar-water, no bitterness or alcohol essence detected, just a wonderful nutty flavor... another winner from Rogue, certainly one of their better brews... Definitely recommended, one of the best depictions of the style..."
"Lovely appearance, delicious malty nose, a nice leveled sweet brown without being obnoxiously sweet. Hops are held back from taking over on this beer. I like how the Hazelnut is not overbearing. I dig. Not carbinated as much as one would think it should be, but I kind of like it that way."
"Pours a rich, dark brown color with a nice white, fluffy head. It has strong aromas of hazelnuts (obviously), roasted malts and bread. The taste is also strongly of hazelnut...this creates a great twist on a brown ale. Overall, awesome beer, well done."
"D - a tasty sample of a brown beer, good drinkability."
"This nectar pours a slightly hazy Red brown. Little head fades fast. Nose almost doesnt exist but some malt. Taste is malty, brown clear nutty tones, but seem kind of false or phony. Would like to see more malt flavors in this. slight hop bite (very slight) The mouthfeel is a wee bit thin. Drinkability is pretty good, a great session ale."
"The beer was a reddish broen color with a nice tan big head. Head did not last very long but lacing was good. The smell was a little nutty and the taste was very slighly nutty toasted just about right. I had great wxpectations of thisbrew as it is suppose to be the same recipe of the first winner of the Long Shot beer competition back in 1993. I drank that beer then and have looked for it ever since. I id not think this beer was as good but then too I'm relying on a memory from long ago. It seemed there was more of a Hazel Nut taste back the, but who knows. This beer is very good and I was happy to find it and will continue to buy it."
"Deep amber color with a decent off white head that doesn't really leave any lacing. Smells of sweet malts. A little nuttiness. Not all that fragrant. For the taste, sweet chocolaty maltiness, hazelnut and a little hop bitterness on the finish that lingers. Not bad at all. Very drinkable."
"This Rogue is dark brown with hints of red and a prominent head. The aroma is not surprisingly of nuts (hazelnuts?) and chocolate malt. I'm a little disappointed in the taste - it seems a little thin, as if it is too reliant on the added hazelnut flavor. It's good, don't get me wrong, but lacks the dimension of Samuel Smith's Brown Ale or other Rogue brews."
"D: Speaking as a fan of Brown Ales, this beer is fantastic. After just one bottle, it might have just jumped to the top of my list."
"D - Very drinkable on tap, have had mixed quality in 22oz. bottles but all in all is one hell of a brown ale."
"Yet again, Rogue delivers. The hazelnut comes with a dark brown/red color with a one finger head. Nose is light hazelnuts. The taste at first is lighter on the nut, but I found as time went on that the flavor was more pronounced as it stayed with you. This wont be my all-time favorite by Rogue, but it still is very, very good."
"Poured from a 650ml bottle with no dating info into a pint glass. It was a deep reddish brown color. It had a small head that quickly dissipated. I've had this several times before and usually has a more robust head so this one may be off slightly. The aroma was awesome - malty with a great hazelnut front. Gets your mouth watering right away. The taste is perfect. The hazelnut adds the right amount of flavor and sweetness without being cloying. I imagine without the hazelnut this would still be an awesome beer. The mouthfeel was nice and solid. Overall this is one of my favorite beers and I end up being it quite often. Highly recommend. (Heavy rotation)"
"M/D: Carbonation is a little high on this but the beer seems to benefit from this. Medium body is more toward the light end, but it holds up well. Drinkability is really good on this one as well. A solid beer all the way around."
"D: This is my favorite nut brown ale, and a terrific ""regular"" beer to have around. I could be stuck on a desert island with only this and be content"
" O.K. or I'll just slam the thing."
"God this guy is delicous. I used to drink the hell out of some newcastle but once i discovered this kid i haven't had one since. Definitely my favorite brown ale i have ever had. It goes down smooth and fast. The only real problem is that they only sell 22-ounce bottles and not six-packs. Hopefully this will change in the future."
"Really wonderful concoction from Rogue, not to be missed."
"An intresting brew albeit one that sends me mixed messages, something seems unbalanced....However, the more I drink the better it gets...@ 6.2%ABV and 650ml, that would be expected.. 2 or 3 of these suckers and it could be the finest brew in the world. At least it isn't sicky sweet."
"Dang, I was hoping for more out of this."
"D: The low ABV did not appeal to me. A bit higher ABV could have left the palate cleaner after each swig and given this beer a bit more of a warm presence. As such it is a very fine brown ale. I will definitely be back to have more...and more...and more."
"M/D: Clean on the palate, despite the malt sweetness. Light and refreshing...I could see enjoying this just as well in cold weather, as hot."
"I very clear, red with a nice head that dissapears quickly. Smell is very sweet and sugary. Taste is kind of nutty, but definately vanilla. Mouthfeel is a little on the light side. Needs to be thicker to be a better ""brown"". I wouldn't call it a clean finish, but not that long lasting aftertaste either. I would buy and drink it again."
"D - I think I could do a few, but the sweetness definitely causes a hit here. After a while it becomes a bit taxing. Overall a pretty decent brew, it was worth a try."
"A nutty brown colored beer, as you might expect. It smells mildly of the hazelnut within, which can be deceptive because of the taste to follow. This beer is extremely drinkable, goes down smooth, and has a slightly sweet taste of hazelnut worked perfectly into the brown ale (no syrupy chemical taste whatsoever). The aftertaste is pleasant with almost no bitterness to speak of. Definitely a good beer and well-priced at ~$5 for 22oz."
"My first drainpoor on BA."
"Very low carbonation, however, the mouthfeel was very think, almost watery. The flavor of this beer totally makes up for it."
"D-Overall this is tasty but not the best brown ale I have ever had. A tad more hops would be welcome"
"good brew; certainly some novelty appeal, as well"
"D - Just about the best brown that I've even tasted. A little to sweet for a session brew, but perfect as an after dinner drink with desert! A really unique and expertly crafted brew."
"Brown in the glass with burgundy edges, a bit of cherry colour too at the sides. The head was not very well developed although a ring remained around the glass. Lightly carbonated. The aroma was very nutty alright with some milk chocolate association. The taste reflected the dryness of the hazelnut, malt, a nectar-like silky mouthfeel. This beer had some body to it with texture and density, with a plum or prune influence alongside the persistent nuttiness. The finish is again hazel or brazil nut dry, bitter, some astringency, but again the nuttiness dominates with malted-milk yeasty backdrop. I love Rogue beers, what a pleasure as usual."
"D: Pretty drinkable. A little harder to put down than some of their other offerings though."
"D- This is a nice offering from Rogue. A great twist on an English Brown Ale-the hazelnut character matches the mildness of the style to take it one step farther. One I will definitely have again."
"Pours a beautiful brown color with a generous off-white head that lasted a while. Smell is both nutty and chocolatey. Taste is fabulous. Nutty and tastes of chocolate. Very well balanced. Mouthfeel is great. Drinkabilty is good. This is one fine beer."
"As far as drinkability goes, its a very very good brown, in my opinion and I'd definitely recommend it to people who enjoy this type of beer."
"Got this on tap at the Yardhouse in San Diego, CA. Was served with a thin white head, that last about a minute. Cherry wood color in the body. Mild woody smells. i couldn't pick much else apart because i think i may have had a cold. Creamy frothy feeling going down with the post mouthfeel being dry. I would say the drinkability on this one is pretty high. They didn't go overboard with this one. Perfect for a brown!! Too many beer companies just go to the extreme just for the sake of being extreme. It was nice to have a regular great tasting beer for once. Was sweet till the last drop."
"This is a good brown ale with some nice character. Well rounded and not overpowering. Rather, soft and malty and very quaffable. I don't think I could get tired of this, it's a solid brew."
"This is well worth picking up."
"I highly recommend this to those who haven't tried it. It's become one of my favorites."
"Nice deep, almost purple brown, a finger of smooth bubbles. Nose is crazy spicy, caramel malt. Taste is lots of toasted malt, bitter. Sweet, spicy malt, a touch of very light hops. Light dried fruit, prunes. Light sourness. A tasty beer, with toffee and roasted hints, with fruitiness as well. As you can see, this one's got tons of different tastes swimming around in there. Smooth body, full and creamy with fairly low carbonation. I really liked this one. One of my preferred beers from Rogue."
"D - As easy as breathing in air."
"Worth checking out, maybe wait another month or two"
"Poured a dark, dark brown, with a tan head that quickly faded, leaving the beer looking rather dull and flat. But it smelled rich and nutty, and the taste is rich, creamy, almost like molasses. Very good. Too rich to have much in the summer, but probably great on winter nights."
"D- I could drink a few of these. Very easy going down and very tasty"
"D - This is certainly a beer that I could have more than one of and enjoyed each sip"
"Pours a medium brown color that is transparent most of the way. A bubbly tan head forms at the top of the glass. Smell is a nutty presence but mostly seems a bit off with some grain and corn type aroma. Taste does remind me a little bit of peanut butter. Mouth feeling is strange since this one is kind of watery and little carbonation."
"A- medium to dark brown color with a tan head and slight lacing S- nutty , nutty , nutty , definite peanutbrittle ( no, I didn't steal that from Durge ) , a little chocolate and toffee , toasted malts T- refer to smell M- watery yet a consistency that was smooth and oily but light? D- would love to try this with some Chocolate peanutbutter pie- very drinkable . Be sure to savor the smell , it is quite striking."
"A dark copper brown color brew with a full tan head and thick lacing. The smell is unbeilevable. A deep sweet peanut brittle just billows out of the glass with buttery highlights and a touch of chocolate detected. A beautiful smell that is good enough to eat. There is a touch of malt hidden in there too but it doesn't present itself much like beer. It just smells good enough to skip the drinking part! The hazelnut influence seems more apparent in the flavor of this brew but there is still plenty of that peanut brittle phenomenon. Sweet butterscotch and malt come through and there is a slight charcoal finish. Although there is a slick feel to this stuff it kept bugging me that it was pretty watery. These kinds of flavors demand more creaminess and body, and more carbonation would have helped as well. You could drink this pretty easily because it is fairly thin stuff but it is probably too sweet to get carried away with. It is a unique and tastey beer but I almost feel like it was a shame to drink away that great aroma, sort of how I feel about pipes/cigars. Anyone who is tolerant of, or enjoys sweet brews should try this. I would like to have it again sometime for sure."
"D - I could drink one or two. I really liked the taste but would prefer switching to another beer after a short while. I've had this from a keg before and 2 was my limit."
"Decently smooth beer. Not too strong w/ the hazelnut taste or smell but nice even hints of hazelnut throught the beer."
"Drinkability is good. A unique take on a brown ale. Not necessarily the best out there but Rogue did a good job with this one."
"Came with low carbonation, but that made for a super smooth experience. There was big hazelnut in the aroma. If I closed my eyes, I would have sworn the nuts were floating in my glass. The flavor was a little more mellow and didn't rank as rich as some of my favorite browns. This there was a nice, sweet cocoa, maple syrup and nutty mix to the taste. Worth trying on tap, typically a better deal than buying a bomber."
"Pours clear reddish brown with thick head that dissipates quickly to 1/8"" thick and eventually to a thin film. The smell is strong malt with a definite nutty overtone that comes across as an extract - so much so that I looked on the bottle ingredients and noted that they use almond extract. I feel that this is a little overwhelming both in smell and especially in flavor. The initial flavor is strong malt with notable hazelnut oil flavor. The malt is complex enough, but the nut flavor is a little over the top, in my opinion. The mouthfeel is medium to full-bodied with active carbonation. This is an interesting beer, but I prefer browns that are a little mellower and smoother. Rogue's is worth trying, but if I wanted a beer with this much flavor I would crack a different style altogether."
"Overall this was a pretty damn fine brown ale. I have had better, but this is pretty damn good. Definatly worth checking out if you havent already."
"from a 22oz bomber into a pint glass pours a dark brown color with a with a very small brown head. smells very nutty, malty and slightly sweet. upfront tastes of hazlenut and roasted malts then has a nice balance of spicy hop bitterness, a very tasty brew. mouthfeel is medium-bodied and very smooth. this is a very drinkable beer, definitley pick one of these up if you havent tried it yet."
"Pours dark brown with shades of amber, brilliantly clear with a thin head that lingers. The aroma is very nice malty, sweet, nutty with very little hop aroma coming out very characteristic of a nut brown ale. The aroma is complex but melds very well together no one element overpowers another. The flavor is very sweet up front, almost a little cloying which is why i docked it a little in the taste category. A lot of malty, bready, toasty notes in the flavor, also some roasty flavors come out in the back of the mouth. Medium bodied with some good carbonation to scrub the palate with the low level of bitterness. With all that said a very nice brown ale probably one of the best I've had, very complex only complaint is that it's a little sweet."
"Out of a 22 oz. bomb, I got a very dark, amber color with a tan head that recedes rather quickly but laces well. I'm picking up malts and some nutty earthy tones in the smell. It tastes of nuts, caramel, toasty malts and there is a small bitter hop flavor at the end. Mouthfeel is decent, it is quite thick, about what I expected for the brown ale. Rogue has some better ones out there, but this isn't one to write off either."
"poured this one right into my frozen mug as a dark brown amber with a caramel colored head that, despite what others say, stuck around for a bit then left a nice lacing. smell of a chocolate / hazelnut / coffee mix with a caramel hint. The taste of this was quite pleasing to me with a complex caramel / hazelnut flavoring and a sweet malt flavoring. Smooth and creamy and a nice crisp lightness to it lead me to almost want another had it not been so sweet. a decent brew for after dinner or dessert but not an everyday drink"
"The texture it much the same. Very syrupy and thick (especially when let to sit and warm up a bit). Worth a try, but certainly not Rogues best effort."
"I found this to be OK, but too sweet. After one glass, I had enough. The sweetness was too much and the hazelnut became cloying. Not bad, but one was plenty."
"Pours a deep brown with hints of caramel coloring. There is very little fizzy head that dissipates quickly. Smell is very sweet with a nutty and toffee edge. The taste is different than the smell lets on. Sweet, as was expected, but there is a strong nutty taste that hits from the second the brew touches your lips. It finishes very smooth and slightly bitter leaving hints of hazelnut taste on the pallet. It is carbonated fairly highly and I personally think this takes away from the mouthfeel. I would have enjoyed this style more with less carbonation but regardless, it was thick and smooth. This is a great beer to enjoy as a desert or to taste but I couldn't see myself drinking more than a glass or two in a sitting. Regardless it was a delicious brew that i thoroughly enjoyed."
"From the tap, it's dark brown in color with some red hues mixed in that's crowned by a nice head. Lots of toffee and other sweet stuff in the smell, but that's just a sneak peak at the taste. Wow! Does this count as dessert? I first noticed some espresso-fumes and cream, then hazelnut, then butterscoth, then toffee. A splash of hops come in to keep this from being too sweet. A very well-made brown ale with plenty of flavors to choose from."
"Quite light, its nutty and sweet. Hazelnut Brown Nectar is a flavored ale based on either a robust Northern English Brown or a light American Brown. Its balanced and delicate."
"Poured with a minimal off-white head and with minimal lacing, almost to the very top of the glass. Very clear and a coppery medium-brown in color, with average visible carbonation. Nose offers up indistinct fruit, along with broad strokes of hazelnut (natch) and vanilla. No hop presence on the nose (and minimal hops throughout), and a very light touch of diacetyl. Big notes of vanilla, hazelnut, and cocoa across the palate on the first sip. Root beer notes, and some light butterscotch. The indistinct fruit on the nose is about the only fruity quality I detected here . . . maybe light berry notes? Sweet, rich, and not at all dry . . . it's a bit fuller-bodied than an English brown ale, too, leaning more towards a robust porter. Alcohol is fairly buried by the hazelnut (extract?) in this one, and at 6.2% is pretty firm, so given that fact the drinkability is quite good. Body and mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, which is to be expected from a Rogue brew in good condition (fresh), this leans toward full-bodied due to its higher level of sweetness / dextrose. And when I say sweet, think confectioner's sugar, cane sugar, treacle . . . marzipan. A bit of spiky, oily hop would actually improve this brew in my mind, but I prefer balance in a mid-strength brew. A bit too sweet for me overall, but with good drinkability nonetheless. Definitely a dessert beer and one to pair with desserts and sweets. Served chilled (tap-line cold) in a tumbler."
"I'm not usually a Brown ale drinker, but I love this beer and Rogue has been consistant with this one for years now. A little on the sweet side, you can taste the Hazelnut (or as Oregonians call 'em, Filberts), but it's not too much. Very clean and drinkable beer. I had one on tap at the brewery a while back and I'd say it was even smoother. Always a good choice to pair with a meal."
"D: Very drinkable beverage. Smooth going down and worth having time and again. One of the easier drinking beers from Rogue."
"Guy on the bottle reminds me of my father during the early 80s so that's sorta weird. Price is a bit steep but shouldn't be a problem seeing how I would only drink one with a nice meal."
"No problem putting this away, regret waiting so long to try it."
"Wonder if I paid more to get this ""Signature ale"" anyway, this good looking bomber releases its contents smoothly into my tasting glass, seems prety highly carbonated with alot of bubles rising and sticking tot he side of the glass. Floats a LONG lasting medium tan, tiny bubble head, that eventually leaves a sh%t load of tiny bubble sticky sheeting. Nose of sweet malt, some slight soapyness and perhaps a metallic note..hmmmm, any way this one is smooth enough, notes of some caramel and nutyness in the finish, but I do pick up some funky off notes, more soap? Slightly off and a rip at $7.49...oh well, Rogue used to be one of my favs..."
"It's a dark mahogany, with a thin tan head that faded fast and left slight lacing which had no retention. It smelled damn good, like hazelnut (obviously), vanilla coke, prunes. I thought it tasted artificial, though. Too sweet, it could have used some more of those bitter flavors that Rogues was famous for. Everyone's saying that this is a dessert beer -- I don't find that acceptable for a brown for some reason. It's got a full body, but I think that its finish should be drier to balance the heavy roasted malts and sweet hazelnut extract. One is enough for me."
"Overall: I gave this a second try and liked it more than the first, but still not very much. The undercarbonation was odd and makes it feel too thin, and the chemical, extract flavoring is off-putting. I still contend this is one of Rogue's worst beers."
"D: A well crafted brew. Good balance for a brown ale. One serving is plenty as this beer is very sweet. An after diner brew. Recommended."
"D- Low abv and delicious aroma makes this a great choice for a post-dinner/evening drink, I could get plenty of mileage sipping and smelling this tasty quaff, but several pints in a row would not pose much of a problem"
"Bomber into pink glass. Pours a beautiful deep brown, very little head quickly recedes- no lacing. Smell is big hazelnuts, earthy dark malts. Taste is hazelnut up front with dark earthy malts coming in. Just a touch of spicy hops in the finish adds some balance. Hazelnut is present and powerful throughout and adds a delicious lightness to this brew. Mouthfeel is medium. Pretty drinkable although very distinct. A nice dessert beer."
"drinkability: Nice brew to have with a dessert. One is enough for me."
"Nicely done. It's like a soft hazlenut liqueur. Delicious. Very good for a malty, ""something different"" brew."
"A satisfying drinker, and the nutty character is never overdone or overexpressed. Short of the 6.2% ABV, it would make a delicious social beverage for repeated consumption."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied and smooth. Low abv makes this extremely drinkable. I'd be happy to drink two or three bombers. Overall, this is a very good beer. It's definitely unique and well-done. Definitely recommended."
"Rich brown in color; not quite dark brown but not an amber. To achieve any head at all requires an improper pour. Mouthfeel is ok; has a good flavor but not much complexity. Reminds me of a typical dark domestic macro brew. Has a pleasant nutty, yet watery aftertaste. Yes its very drinkable and light enough to drink more than one. The problem with this beer is it probably won't appeal to dark beer drinkers nor the pilsner drinker. Good allaround beer, best described as the Jan Brady of Rogue beers."
"Poured from a 22oz bomber into pint glasses. The beer was milk chocolate brown color, looked and smelled quite a bit like Newcastle brown ale. Actually I expected a hazelnut smell but didn't get it. The flavor was mostly sweet, hardly any bitterness at all. Very easy to drink, a ""session"" beer."
"Yes it's good, but I wouldn't say great. Maybe my expectations were too high, but this Rogue didn't blow me away. The glass has a nice transparent brown hue and it doesn't smell like much of anything. The taste is enjoyable, but a little too sweet for my liking. The carbonation, color and flavor all resemble cola in a weird sort of way. I like cola so I enjoyed drinking it, but it's not the Rogue experience that I am used to. Is it REALLY 6.2% ABV? I would have guessed much lower (it is also available in South Carolina where we have a alcohol cap on beer at 6%... shhh. don't tell anybody)."
"Served a dark brown with absolutely no head. The aroma was of dark malt and strong roasted nuts. The taste was a great balance of dark malts and a variety of hops doing their jobs in the background. There was also a very smooth hazelnut flavor. The beer was light and smooth and very enjoyable. A great brown ale."
"Drinkability is only so so. I can only see drinking this again when I want a VERY dry beer with food. Probably the best beer in the world for eating with Nutella on bread."
"Overall one of these a night if your feel a bit weird and want something that stands out."
"I actually had to review this beer because so many people loved it and I'm now wondering what I'm missing. First it poured a deep reddish brown, slighty murky. Moderate head retention with some nice lacing. Ok, it smelled good, really it did, I WANTED to like it. It smelled like a bakery, caramel, toasted nuts, all that good stuff. But the taste? eh. It was a bit one-dimensional for me. Definitely very heavily presented toasted nut and oat flavors. But something was off, like I was looking at the tap and THINKING hazelnut but really I was tasting some horrible nut extract with a heavy emphasis on walnut/pecan. Oh yeah, some vanilla and even a little cocoa. But I wanted it sweeter and more balanced. WAY more balanced. but hey, maybe it's just me."
"Drinkability: Awesome brown ale, it's a top notch ABA with a hazelnut sweetness that is just delicious. After work, with a sugar cookie, it was amazing."
"D - Very drinkable nectar if you are looking for this type of brew. It wasnt over powering at all smooth, chocolate and hazelnut treat"
"Served slightly chilled in a pint glass from a 22oz. bottle. Poured a very deep ruby reddish brown color when held up to the light. About one finger of tan colored head formed in the glass and dissapeared quickly into nothing. Very sweet raisin, brown sugar, along with a little nuttiness and molasses in the nose. Plenty of flavor here. Brown sugar, hints of hazelnut, sweet fruity flavors with a nice malty finish. Very drinkable. Some carbonation, and no noticeable alcohol present. Pretty solid brew and definitely worth a try."
"Will try again based on the overwhelming majority of positive reviews, but I've got to call it like I taste it for now."
"I could have a few of these and be a happy camper. Definetely a nice brew."
"Medium body, with a slight chewiness. Well balanced, very drinkable."
"Bit of a weak finish with a slightly watery mouthfeel and dull aftertaste."
"I haven't clicked with most Rogue Beers, even the well-regarded Stouts - maybe it's the novelty character, maybe something else. But I love the Hazelnut Nectar - my favorite Rogue, one of my favorite brown ales, and even a favorite beer. Definitely works with a dessert, with nutty cheeses, or even to complement some mild foods. If it were a little less expensive it would be even more of a regular for me!"
"A pleasing brown ale, but nothing exciting either. I guess I was expecting something a little different, and I thought the hazelnut extract would be more pronounced."
"Beer poured out a very nice deep brown, slightly hazy, with light head and lacing. Beer smelled nice and sweet, with some chocolate and hazelnut aromas. The taste was not quite what I was hoping for, sweet, with some malt and hazelnut. Mouthfeel was too syrupy, but perhaps that is to be expected with a ""nectar," also seemed very flat. All in all, very average I thought, somewhat disappointed from Rogue which is usually so good."
"Hazelnut Brown Nectar is one of the best brown ales I've ever had. It pours to produce a light tan head, with a cloudy and dark brown body. Thin lacing lasts a good while. Gives off a slight chocolaty aroma and tastes chocolaty, but with a vivid hazelnut sweetness."
"Drinkability- Pretty damn good in moderation. I'm enjoying a 22oz bottle now but no way I could handle any more than that. Terrific desert beer or delicious when following a Brutal Bitter :)"
"Dark brown brew with a head that did not last long ..Smells of hazelnut & coffee . This was bought to see if this would surpass my nutty love for the Coffeehouse Porter by The Berkshire Brewing Company . It did not . It is not bad but I would have liked a little more bite/ body to make me happy . Still it is a jolly good brew by Rogue . Will have again"
"Hazy brown, strong hazelnut flavor that following their chocolate would be a great dessert. This also like many of Rogue's other offerings has a noticeably accentuated taste, flavor and experience tasting it on tap as compared to the bottle. While Rogue in the bottle is usually very good, tap just makes the beers sing."
"Poured out a chocolate brown, failry clear, with a thick creamy tan head. The nose was sweet, full of hazelnut, creamy, with some mild spicing. The taste was a little watered down for me, nice hazelnut flavor, kind of sweet, but not enough body or malt backing this guy up. Instead of being a nuance, the hazelnut was the main attraction here. A decent effort, but this needs to be bigger. The hazelnut is a bit too cloying for me."
"Have Another?: Definitely! The best nut brown ale I've tasted hands down."
"If you love hazelnut coffee, you will love this. Actually, if you love good beer, you will love this Brown Ale. A nice dark color to it, which is blood red when you hold it up to light. Smell is of hazelnut and malt. Still can't believe how good this was. I don't want to say too much, you just need to go out and try it. My ratings say it all."
"Excellent brew. Great drinkability. My only regret is I bought only one of these. I will be stocking up!"
"Like many of Rogue's offerings, this beer is unique and enjoyable. A very drinkable brew that I return to regularly."
"Very drinkable."
"I got this brew at Tank's Taproom in Tampa, Fl. It poured a deep brown with two fingers of a light brown head. The retention was medium to fast and produced little if any lacing. The smell was a very sweet hoppy smell. The taste was pretty malty, almost giving the drinker a woody sense (as in trees not the other thing). This brew went down very smooth, and was a good purchase. Don't drink and review."
"Drinkability? Right on.... a very drinkable beer. I finished off the rest of the 22 oz immediately. Left me wanting another."
"I had this beer last night at Redbones. I've always wanted to try it, so to see it on tap was rather nice. Since it was dark in the room, it was hard to judge the color, but the heading was pretty nice looking. In the smell was plenty of chocolate, honey and sweet sugar. Taste...woah! this one was really sweet to the point of being a bit too sweet. Having said that the nectar side of the beer gave it a nice presence. Mouthfeel was about medium I would say. One was more then enough for me for no other reason but that it was just too sweet for my palate. Maybe i'll pick up a bomber of it to see if there are any significant differences. Cheers"
"Pours a dark brown with a reddish tint. Head is thin and dissipates quickly and doesn't leave much lacing. Roasted malt and hazelnut is present in the scent, a hint of chocolate, and a bready smell from the malt. Taste is bready and roasted. Full bodied and not very carbonated. Easy to drink."
"Drinkability - Definately, though this is not something I would want to drink all night as it is fairly heavy, but I could definately sit down and easily finish a six pack."
"Drinkability - this is rich, hearty, and excellent, and it's very sessionable."
"Drinkability: Yes, please, several more."
"Pours a deep mahogany brown - dark ruby and nutty brown. Foamy, dense head sticks around for a while. Smell is very sweet and nutty, with some hop presence. Taste is very good - nutty & molasses-like sugary sweetness with enough bitter hop to counter if not balance. The addition of hazelnut nectar is well placed in this brew. Mouthfell is a little winey - maybe due to sugars added to maintain the sweetness?"
"An appealing reddish-dark brown, like a rich sherry or molasses. Plenty of roasted malt, toasted almonds, and caramel in the nose. Tastes of chocolate and hazelnut flavored coffee, without cream. Medium finish. I'd like a touch more depth, but it's darn tasty stuff. A bit too bubbly at first, but a smooth finish. Very easy to drink."
"d -- the heavy mouthfeel and abundance of sweet flavors keep this from being a session beer (as many browns are), but that's not really a complaint. this is a very nice dessert-type beer, great to have occasionally."
"Note: The quality control on this beer (Much like the Roque Red) leaves something to desired. Try it. If you don't like it, wait a few weeks and then get another bottle from a different store."
"Ala cuisine!!!"
"Oh and the guy on the bottle looks just like my brother."
"Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a cloudy brown with a small off-white head. It smells like nuts, roasted malt, and some caramel. It tastes mostly like chocolate and hazelnuts, and there's also some caramel and malt taste with a small bitter finish. The mouthfeel is light/medium, and a little bit creamy. This is pretty easy to drink too, I wouldn't have many problems drinking 2 or 3 bombers of this. This is a pretty good beer, but then I don't think I've ever had a bad beer from Rogue."
"Drinkability: Very luxurious and tasty, yet complex and easy to drink. This may be my favorite Rogue brew yet."
"The hazelnut comes through strongly in the taste and smell, especially in a fresh batch like this. Roasted malt, caramel undertones, subdued hoppiness. Very dry stuff, especially in the finish. It's on the lighter side of medium-bodied, with pretty light carbonation; very smooth and refreshing. This stuff is infinitely drinkable."
"A nice drinking, refreshing beer."
"A 750ml bottle purchased from a small packie. Was a little dusty so it age may be why it turned out to be a disappointment. Inital pour was impressive; nice clear caramel brown color, good head, and excellent aroma. Distinct hazelnut odor, along with caramel and sweet malt aromas. My expectations were dashed once I tasted it though. Initally sweet, the beer lacks any aftertaste as well as any hazelnut or any kind of nutty undertone. The head quickly dissipated and it ended up tasting very flat. Again, it may be caused by an old bottle. Worth trying again, but don't get your hopes up."
"Another from the PDQ Market. Pours a attractive dark brown. Smells lightly like sweet malt. Tastes quite nicely of sweet malt, some nutty bitterness and some toasty malts, a bit like some porters I've had in the past. Overallit's different from other brown ales I've had and probably what a brown ale is supposed to be like. I like it and recommend it."
"A great beer that I will definitely purchase again."
"Note to Self: Ranked the #9 American Brown Ale, need to have it again!"
"Pours to a dark brown color with ruby tint, and a thick off-white head that lingers for most of the glass and leads to good lacing. Nice, sweet, malty aroma of roasted nuts and hints of chocolate. Flavor is more of the malty sweet roasted-nut flavor. Some alcohol blended in nicely at mid-glass, all which contributed to a good long finish. Im normally not a fan of brown ales, but I really enjoyed this one."
"Drink at cellar temperature for best flavor."
"It's cloyingly sweet, but not unpleasantly so. Certainly not something to pull out of the fridge during the ballgame. An event beer? Company's coming, let's get a bottle or two of Hazelnut Brown Nectar for dessert."
"D - this is alright, no my cup of tea. The hazelnut is a bit sweet to me so I can't imagine drinking much of this."
"Thick, creamy mouthfeel, though a little sticky. A bit too sweet for my tastes, however, so I'll take my time finishing this one off. I'll definitely buy again, but I doubt I'll ever have two back-to-back."
"Can't drink this again. Nothing there to hang my hat on. From Rogue? Hmm...maybe this was a bad bottle."
"D- Awesome. Drink it as much as you can."
"The mouthfeel is slightly syrupy and full, but also well-carbonated. This is a pretty drinkable beer, assuming that you really like hazelnut. If you don't, well, then one glass will probably be your limit."
" Wavz"
"Overall- A nice Brown Ale. This 1 is a perfect dinner beer."
"D - Umm, wow?! This is fantastic - the flavor is very complex. Each sip brings out a different aspect (nutty, roasty, sweet, bitter). This is the first brown ale I've had that brought all my tastebuds to life! Just looking at the beer makes it looklike it'll be too heavy to drink (damn those TV commercials), but my God did Rogue surprise me! I HAVE to get another one of these beers! It's just a shame the smallest packaging for HazelNut is 22oz and not 6packs. Anyway, way to go Rogue - sensational brew!"
"Slainte!"
"The mouth is light to medium, a little bright on the front, dry semi-dry and nutty on the finish. It's drinkable, but after sampling it both on-tap and in the bottle, I doubt I will give it another taste. I think it was better overall in the bottle--better carbonation and complexity. But it failed to knock my socks off in either format. I would suggest looking elsewhere in the Rogue catalogue."
"Overall: Nicely balanced and not too sweet."
"Poured a very deep , dark brown , with a medium sized head. Aroams is of musch malts , some nutty/hazelnut smell , mildly roasty. The taste is mainly of roasty maltiness , with a bit of nutty/ hazelnut flavor in there. Bit of creamyness to the texture , the hop bitterness works its way in there though. A very quaffable brew indeed. Nice american brown ale."
"This is a great brew. I could see myself drinking a few of these at one sitting. The guys at Rogue have it going on."
"D - Another great Rogue product. And a great brown ale."
"Definitely the best brown ale, from any country, that I've had to date. The flavors are very complex, with an excellent nutty character to the beer. A superbly smooth and wonderfully carbonated mouthfeel make this beer a definite repeat-pleaser. A must have once, or twice, or three times...you get the point."
"What a treat. Rogue definitely hits off a balance of flavor with this one, bouncing a number of matching notes off the malty side of this brew. A 22 oz. bomber is a great way to cap off the night."
"Opinion: This is a pretty good beer. I have been rather shy of Rogue's beers that aren't Stouts because they are often IMO undrinkably bitter and linger like you ate a piece of chalk. This beer is pretty well balanced and actually lets the malt take a shot at the lead. I have enjoyed this beer, and I would drink it again. So there you have it!"
"D-Hopefully I just had a bad bottle. The metallic taste and smell was pretty overwhelming. I can see this being a good regular beer to have on a average night. Goes down quite easy."
"I have been a sucker for hazelnut beers after falling in love with Rogue's hazelnut ale. The smell of this beer is mostly sweet, like artificial sweetener with a hint of alcohol. The taste is light, and doesnt really take shape til about 3/4 of the way through. It has kind of a syrup-like consistency, but that sweet hazelnut taste adds such a wonderful kiss to the brown taste. It is basically non-existent for the majority of the mouthfeel, but after the beer goes down the aftertaste is totally dominated by it. Quite a special beer."
"*note* Since I reviewed this beer I have been drinking one of these almost everynight! It's damn addictive and damn good, I had to jack up some of my points because of that."
"My only complaint is that the body comes off as a bit heavy sometimes, but this is a very tasty, very good beer. Thank you Rogue for coming the GCBF!"
"Flavors are similar to smell with a very slight hazelnut finish. It is remarkably smooth, fitting for an Iron Chef. I enjoyed drinking the beer and it was unique for the style, if not for the hazelnut than for the smoothness."
"Not too bad. The smell is really the highlight here."
"D: refreshing"
"22 oz poured into a pint glass. This looks amazing very dark brown in appearance with a nice fluffy brown head that leaves some lacing on the glass. Smell is of roasted malts with a bit of sweet coffee and also some yeasty bread with a bit of sweet honey. Taste is amazing it honestly to me taste like a weaker imperial stout, very similar in taste just not with that alcohol bite. I can taste coffee, roasted nuts, bread and a bit of hop bitterness in there. This was the first time I had this fine offering from Rogue and I believe I just found my new favorite from the Brewer's on the Bay, simply amazing."
"D - Very drinkable. This is an awesome brew from Rogue, highly recommended."
"Bottle: Poured a dark brown color ale with a foamy dark head with average retention. Aroma is nutty from the hazelnut flavour and malty with some roastiness. Taste is quite enjoyable with the hazelnut easily identifiable and roasted malt balancing everything else. Overall, I would say that this is a very good session beer."
" It is drinkable, but seems to lack direction. Had it been maltier or hoppier or even had a more pronounced hazelnut signature I would have enjoyed this one more. This was the first and only time I have been underwhelmed by a Rogue product."
"Overall: A great beer overall, well balanced and enjoyable. Recommended."
"A touch rich for me to drink all night, but easy going down nonetheless. An interesting and enjoyable beer, striding the line between sipper (from the sweetness rather than ABV) and a session beer. Id drink it again, but wouldnt choose it over other Rogue brews Ive had."
"Another winner from Rogue. This beer is very drinkable and hides its ABV well, I was surprised to see it was over 6% after tasting it."
"Cheers2Beers"
"I was impressed by the appearance of this beer as it poured darker than I expected with a dark brown body that was a little ruby when held to light. Light nose left me unsure what to expect out of the taste, beyond the expected nuttiness. The tase was very malted with nut taste predominant and fruity nuances. Enough hops to balance the smoky, nutty early tastes. All in all this was a very enjoyable beer that I will visit again. Can't sing too many praises about Rogue that haven't already been sung."
"tasty, tasty, tasty."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink and a definite improvement on the typical brown ale"
"This beer poured a dark brown color with a nice cream colored persistent head. It definitely smells nutty. You can also smell caramel and malt. The taste is sweeter than most beers and the nut flavor is pronounced. The mouthfeel is thick but smooth. I would consider this a very drinkable beer, especially if you are a fan of nut browns (which I am)."
"The mouthfeel is fairly creamy. Dessert, anyone?"
"Drinkability: The complex and friendly taste make this beer incredibly quaffable. I hope to try it on tap soon."
"Best Brown Ale thus far, definitely a divine nectar."
"A really wonderful brew with a unique flavour profile. Trust Rogue to put out a world class specimen that doesn't quite fit the style profile exactly, but projects excellence none-the-less. This would be a regular in my fridge if it was available here."
"Pours a dark brown maple color with a tan head. Smells sweet with syrup and hazelnut, not too much else except sweet notes. Taste is similar, a light body, good carbonation. A very sweet nut brown with some malty aftertaste. The mouthfeel has a good balance of taste, carbonation, and smell. A well rounded beer that is very easy to drink. I would recommend this to all, especiall nut brown lovers, this is a good beer. Enjoy."
"Poured out of it's 22oz bomber into a pint glass. Pours a dark brown with mahogany hues when held up to the light. Pour produces a light tan head that quickly turns into a thin lace on top. This is a deliciously smelling brew! Nose is nutty with sweet roasted malt with a little cocoa as well. Taste begins sweet with roasted malt and cocoa that finishes with a dry nuttiness and just enough hop bitterness to clean the palate. Mouthfeel I feel is a little to light for a Brown. Overall this is another good offering from Rogue!"
"I feel dirty."
"Drinkability, if you are a brown ale fan, should be quite good."
"taste: a proper extention of the smell. chocolate, coffee, nuts, currants. Malty and sweet, but not too sweet since i was drinking it for dessert. May be too sweet for dinner..."
"Cheers!"
"This beer came to the table as a black beer with no head. The smell was nutty with a strong hazelnut scent. The taste was similar with a good malt backbone. The mouthfeel was pretty moderate and smooth. Of the nut brown beers, this is probably the best I've had. I've never been a fan of the style, but this beer may change my mind. Now if they could just sell this stuff in 12 oz. at cheaper prices."
"Medium bodied. I wont get this one again, but because of the hazelnuts  did I mention I the hazelnuts nauseate me?"
"This was a pretty one-sided beer, not much going on with the hops at all. A nice offering from Rogue, although their bombers continue to be a bit overpriced."
"Dark reddish copper with a medium-small, pillowy, light tan, slowly diminishing head. Like the bottle says, theres lots of nuts in the nose. Moderately sweet-smelling and malty, with aromas of chocolate, juicy hops, a little spice, and a bit of dark fruit. The taste is sweet and all about the hazelnut. Supporting cast of bready malts, light cherry and wood. It has a medium body, VERY smooth texture and soft carbonation. This is an impressive easy-drinker. And interesting little twist on the style. Certainly worth trying."
"Aftertaste slightly hazelnut extract but the hops makes for a pleasant drying that makes you want for another sip."
"D- Most beers that try to have a nutty flavor just never pull it off. This is one of the few that does. It has a nice complex malty flavor that is still a full-bodied session beer. It is almost a desert with the slight sweetness, big creaminess and nice nuttiness all it is missing is a big alcohol taste and you have desert in a glass."
"Pours a lovely deep reddish-brown with a tall and thick creamy tan head that lasts and lasts and leaves some nice lacing. Smell is rich and nutty, with a hint of chocolate and some roasted malts rounding it out. Wonderfully warm and inviting. Taste is malty up front, with lots of lightly roasted chocolate and spices being overtaken by the nuttiness that builds a finish that goes on and on. A touch of hoppiness livens up this nicely complex ale. Mouthfeel could be a bit thicker, but is well carbonated and warming, and drinkability is very good, though the richness and complexity makes one want to slow down and appreciate it fully. Just a great beer, certainly my favourite brown ale to date."
"About what I expected from this beer. Ive had it built up and it did not disappoint."
"Cheers!"
"This one displays a dark brown body with ruby highlights showing through all over the place. No head to speak of. The aroma is quite sweet, with extracted vanilla and a lot of nuttiness coming through. Tasting this, the first thing to leap out is some pinprick carbonation on the tip of the tongue, along with a typical nut brown sourness at the back of the palate. Then a smooth, hazelnut, vanilla and sugar sweetness comes through. The finish is on the smokey side, and the mouthfeel is quite silky and smooth. Overall, this beer isn't my cup of tea, but it's still quite good, and would make quite a good dessert beer I'd imagine."
"Wow, this is sweet! This dark brown beer with the slight reddish tint and decent tan head has a smell that only hints at the toasty caramel/toffee liquid candy goodness that is Rogue's Hazelnut Brown Nectar. Smooth malts and nuttiness anyone would be hard pressed to beat. Drinkable? Quite, if you like your tongue to dance from the sweetness. Rogue, I pump my fist in your honor!"
"This is a great beer if you want one as a nightcap, and I think it would be a great dessert beer. Also might be good to break in a non-BA with. A very good beer."
"My third beer from Rogue, and after the Mocha Porter and the Chocolate Stout, I am looking forward to this sweeter and less roasty offering. 650ml, tasted at cellar temperature. Poured out, wow, quite dark for a brown. A nice, solid-looking deep tawny chestnut. Held to light it shows some nice near-ruby, light purple hues. The head is oatmeal-coloured and left full but fast moving lace. A definite beauty of a brown ale to look at. The first aroma...mmmm...butterscotch and creamy hazelnut. Sweet and big on the caramel malts, almost like coffee flavouring, vanilla and hazel. The prominent notes here are the toffee, butterscotch and caramel, and it's really quite delicious to smell. Better than the Chocolate stout and Mocha porter for me. It really reminds me of a flavoured coffee, because it does have a milky, almost buttery profile as well. The malting is strong and balanced, and the hops are really hard to find behind all the sweetness. Other sweet notes: candy apple, chocolate raisins, prunes, some rummy sugariness, and even a little spicy phenol. A real pleasure to inhale. Taste? Rummy sweetness and butterscotch on the tongue right away, a bit mild but sweet in the middle, and leaving with, yes: hazelnut and more coffee flavour than the nose suggested. Light chocolate and a less full-flavour than the aroma might have led me to believe, but this is still extremely tasty. A lovely aftertaste that lingers full with nuttiness and caramel, vanilla and cinnamon bread. Very creamy, with coffee-flavouring. A brown sugar flavour here too that (almost) reminds me of some Belgian dubbels. A ton of toffee-candy sweetness. Awesome. The mouthfeel is the only nitpicking territory. I found it a little weak and watery at the finish--it could use just a tad more body, because the lack of it adds a hard-water flavour the beer could do without. Low carbonation. I could drink these all night, and give me this over their Chocolate stout anyday. Solid."
"Dark brown in colour with medium carbonation, but poor head retention. Strong malty aromas, along with the typical Rogue pacman yeasty touch and a bit of roasted malt. Initial flavors of munich malts and a bit of soft fruit give way to the more drying chocolate malt and nut flavors. I think its more sesame than hazelnut, but the nut element is definitely there. Theres a bit of a sour twang (not from infection) on the finish that I didnt really like. A bit of a disappointment."
"I am impressed. I expected to like this, but it has surpassed all expectations."
"Overall, this is a nice beer, but i have to be in the mood for it to enjoy, so sweet. a friend of mine recommended it to me a while back, and i bought one. i liked it then. Well, he passed away a few months ago, so i always think of him when i see this one, and his words when he described it, ""soo tasty."" Very enjoyable beer though."
"Drinkability is, for me, not enough to go out and buy more, but enough to wait until I feel the need or craving again and the opportunity arrises."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is medium bodied. The beer is nicely carbonated with a creamy touch. This is a nearing perfect balance between sweet and spicy bitterness. I really enjoyed this beer treat. Sadly the beer was departing my glass to fast. I wish I had purchased a few more of these goodies."
"Dark brown with a red hue to it, has a almost tan colored head that leaves no lacing. Smell, as expected is very nutty, hazelnut and I thought maybe even a cocoa smell to it. Taste is definately full of hazelnut and I notice the cocoa more in the taste than the smell, with a hint of coffee in the finish. Light in body and highly carbonated, this is a good beer that I can see myself having again."
"This beer tastes amazing. It starts off with a very light roasted bitterness that splashes right into a deep nutty flavor before going to molasses flavors that can even have some chocolate tones. Creamy-ass mouthfeel. Nectar indeed."
"Pours a very pretty brown with supple but swiftly receding head. It smells nutty. The taste starts with chocolate malt, and finishes with a kick of hazlenut. It is not syrupy, but the hazlenut finish is a bit dominant for my liking."
"D: This beer leaves me not wanting another one. I don't think I could suggest this to a friend at all."
"Served cool in an imperial pint. Has a big brown head to begin with that fades quickly, kind of expected from a brown ale. Very deep brown in color with very little lacing. hazelnut is the overwhelming aroma here. The flavor is absolutley amazing. chocolate, caramel, and toffee malts are all present to begin with, and then you are hit with an amazing wave of hazelnut. very thick and rich in the mouth. Incredibly drinkable. This is a great dessert beer, although you could drink this all night. This beer definitely deserves the number one spot for brown ales. Definitely a must have brown ale for anyone."
"I was slightly dissapointed. Overall bitterness and clouds the nuttiness and I feel like there are better versions of Brown ale out there for similar prices. In a pinch I'd reach for this one again."
"Ruby-copper color with a medium off-white head that dissipates quickly. The aroma is of caramel and toffee elements, candy-sweet. Kind of reminds me of Saranac Caramel Porter. On the palate, sweet caramel candy flavors appear first, followed by a nutty, roasty malt element. A firm bitterness prevails from mid-palate through the finish, with the aftertaste being highlighted by a hazelnut element that heretofore had manifested itself to varying degrees throughout the palate. I'm quite impressed by how the caramel and hazelnut flavors work in concert with the pleasingly firm bitter and astringent elements. Bravo."
"This is a great tasting beer but I feel that if it had a thicker body I would appreciate it more. No knock on Rogue though, as this is a top-notch session beer; the 6.2% is completely unnoticable."
"Beer poured a deep mahogany-brown with little head. Nose is of sweet malts with a hint of nuts. Taste is heavy on sweet maltiness but is offset nicely by a subtle dry hop to finish. Mouthfeel is outstanding, very full for the style and just enough carbonation to make it nice and lively. Overall drinkability is very good. This is an enjoyable beer and a nice representation of the style."
"A top three beer for this month's beer club meeting. very dark with a crimson tinge. looks about as i would think a hazlenut flavored ale should. sweet, nutty odor. tastes like a milkshake, chocolatey and nutty. hazlenut is very tame. overall very sweet (which i didn't actually think was a good thing) with a hazlenut finish. a bit thin for the milkshake-like taste. too sweet for drinking a lot of this. reminded me a lot of rogue's choco-stout. both are sweeter than i'd like."
"Dark brown/ dark copper in color with a half inch beige head. Rich nutty smell with notes of malt and barley. Wonderful taste. Good carbonation and well balanced beer with a disticnt nutty finish. Incredibly smooth and easy drinking. A good standard for a brown ale, would love to consume a few if I found it on tap."
"Drinkability: Drink up bitches"
"I received a nice pour with a short off white head. The beer appeared to be lightly carbonated. The beer's color apeared an incredibly deep, clear brown. Big malts with overtones of - the name hits it - Hazelnut rides through the nose. The beer itself tasted sweet, perpetually teetering near the edge of being overly so, but never becomes too sweet for my taste. The beer is big on the slightly roasted malt flavors along with the nutty flavors. The low level of carbonation aids in giving it a rich, full mouthfeel too. A slight, nice bit of bitterness comes at the very end as the beer roles of the mouth. This is like a nice dessert in a glass. It's a drinkable beer even with it's sweetness."
"Another winner from Rogue"
"Drinkability  Rogue made a simple style into a big beer. Great flavor, high drinkabilty."
"This beer pours a nice dark brown with a thick head from a brown 22 ounce bottle. The aroma is malty, nutty and even smells a bit sweet. I really like the taste of this one, hazelnut is definitely prominent and makes for a nice addition to this brown ale. This is one I revisit from time to time and I'm never disappointed."
"Drinkability: Excellent and unique! Very easy to drink. Sweet, but not too sweet. A very tasty brown ale!"
"Too sweet and fake to be drinkable. Feels like I am drinking some sweet ass coffee. Yuck."
"I wasnt sure what to think when buying this beer cause amber nut browns are one of my least liked styles. Im really glad I did. As a result of not being to fond of the style, I though this was a great beer. The deep amber color is complemented by a milky thick body of tiny bubbles. Ive never had an amber be so complex. It has a strong caramel taste and I get hints of smoked bacon. This would be great with a ham. The nose has a strong sent of brown sugar. The finish leaves a great sticky smoky brown sugar taste in your mouth. Mouth feel is very impressive. It feels a lot lighter then it looks making it go down maybe a little too quick. This is the master of nutbrowns."
"Sampled at Brick Store Pub with the Atlanta B.A. crew. Hops and added flavour. Are browns needed? If I am going to have this, it might as well be on-tap. Colour-brown. I can see it appealing to some people and transitioning from coolers. A bit too much on the sweet side for my palate."
"I wasn't overly impressed by this brew. Pours out to a medium dark brown color with a small head of foam. No lace. Aromas of nuts, light malts, vanilla. Taste wasn't all that great for me. Some nuttiness was overturned on the palate with an array of flavors; vanilla bean, herbs, caramel, touches of leather. Too much going on, and not enough standing out. Mouthfeel was typical for a Brown Ale, rather calm with some syrupy element about itself. Fair drinkability. Worth a try."
"I've had this more than a few times recently on both draft and from bottle. This beer is fabulous. What a funky appearance. Very dirty looking brown with smoky attributes throughout. This is one fine and easy drinking brew. Tastes of what else but hazlenut, toffee, caramel, nice malty sweetness. Good beer to get your ""domestic"" drinking friends to try. Not sure how you couldn't like this one."
"I've revised this review after my second bottle months later, because that second bottle seemed much rounder and fuller than the first. No real complaints, and I'm glad I gave it second chance."
"Drinkability: will have more again in near future."
"Mmm. Donuts."
"This beer is really great. I would look at it as a desert beer. A very different beer for me and excellently made. I could go for this and a big piece of tiramisu or coffee cake. Delicious!"
"drinnkability: not sure that i could do more than a bomber of this. leaves you feeling kinda full somehow. like a piece of cheesecake."
"D - I really like this beer. Unfortunately a 22oz bomber goes for $5.50 so I won't be buying this too often. No ABV listed but it doesn't seem too high... or at least I can't taste it. This beer would be perfect with a nice steak."
"Fantastic."
"Smooth, light and creamy. I don't care for brown ales but I'll have this again."
"Overall: this one definitely does the style justice, and in my opinion is worth a taste if you've never had it. The bottle recommends serving with beef or pork, but I think this would make a much better dessert beer, ideally with a huge slice of chocolate cake."
"I like Rogue well enough, but this beer is just too fake. Please, please don't add anything to your beers, especially not syrup. It kills the carbonation and makes this taste totally unlike beer."
"Mouthfeel- A little rich, but nothing to overpower the palate. Very nutty, but a veryy good nutty :)."
"22 ounce bottle. Hazlenut Brown Nectar has a dark brown color with a small off-white head. Delicious aroma of toffee, chocolate, and nuts. Rich, malty flavor. This beer is sweet, but it never comes close to being cloying. The sweet chocolate flavor gives way to a toasted malt flavor in the middle. This is accompanied by hazlenuts. Very slight fruity flavors. The finish is a little hoppy, but overall this is mainly about the malt. Medium mouthfeel. Good drinkability. I'm very impressed with this beer."
"I'll admit, I've not always been the biggest nut beer fan, but this one changes my perspective. The hazelnut is a wonderful acompaniment to everything else this beer has to offer, and it delivers a blended, distinguished flavor for your trouble. While it could almost be seen as a varietal beer, I think it could be enjoyed any time, as drinkable as any beer of its type. I'm not going to say I will become the biggest nut beer fan out there, but I will certainly be willing to visit the realm more often, and that's because of this fine example."
"Drinkability: I could sip this all night. I chose it as my post-finals celebration beer, and what a good choice! I just wish I had more."
"D: One has to be a fan of roasted nut and coffee flavors to enjoy this beer; the essence of these two foods dominate its makeup. That being said, this is an eminently drinkable beer that, while not proper for a session, would be enjoyable throughout the day with its rich aromas and moderately complex taste profile."
"Poured into my pilsner glass. Pours a caramel brown color and leaves a tan head that did not stick around for too long. Smells of nuts, caramel, and malt. Nice taste of hazelnut and brown sugar. Nice mouth feel with good carbonation. I love this beer. It puts Newcastle to shame. I recommend this beer to everyone, its delicious!!!"
"It pours a dark amber brownish color hue with a decent head that hold fairly well but does not lace very well. It smells wonderfully nutty and sweet. It almost smells like hazelnut coffee. It tastes a hint of peanutbutter but roasted hazelnut malts dominate the overall flavor. It holds decently in one's mouth but it could be a little more forceful. Overall It another great brew from Rogue."
"Overall, easy to drink, but could use a bit mroe bitterness to fill in for some sweetness."
"Pours a dark brown with ruby red highlights. A thin wispy head crowns the top. I can smell this beer with out even holding it to my nose. Not suprisingly it smells of hazlenut, but it smells oh so good. My tongue is pleased with the flavors of hazlenut, coffee, toffe, hint of chocolate and a nice sweet malty finish that stays with you for awhile. Feels very crisp, fresh, thick and syrupy in the mouth. Hazlenut is so drinkable my macro swill drinking friends crave this. This is the one craft beer that they like."
"Brewed with hazelnut extract, this deep ruddy ale is a welcome diversion from straightforward maltnhops beers. Trivia fact: Oregon grows 98% of Americas hazelnuts."
"A uniquely flavored Brown Ale. A true Rogue in consistency and novelty. A great brew!"
"A great beer, but certainly one I only crave once or twice a year. If you have a sweet tooth and are tired of boring brown ales give this a shot."
"Notes: I feel like a broken record with Rogue. Mouthfeel is off the charts once again. I've yet to come across a beer that wasn't near perfect from this company. Good thing that samuel smith's nut brown is in a different category or they would have a run for their money. The two best brown's in my opinion."
"In my humble opinion, when compared to other Rogue beers, this one is a miss, although I love the creativity. Hazelnut flavors and aromas make this beer palatable. It's just that it could be so much better."
"Taste is also very malty, more toastyness, with a bare hint of chocolate. Sweet, but not overly so. Hazlenutty, obviously, but I also got a vanilla extract thing going on in there. Pretty easy to drink, though I'm not sure I could have more than one of these. Interesting, a nice dessert type beer."
"Im not a big fan of Brown Ales, but for the style this one very good. Another winner from Rogue."
"Overall = After drinking this beer, so far, I've come to the undeniable conclusion that Rogue is the greatest brewery in the USA. This beer is a masterpiece of taste, and I greatly recommend everyone go out and buy it."
"I surely drank too much of this one. I wouldn't drink it all night, but splitting a bomber for a dessert would work fine. Not sure about matching it with chocolate."
"(22 oz. bottle)"
"Excellent with marzipan."
"Poured from a bomber bottle into my new 24 oz mug. Nice pour, head rises quickly up to a couple fingers high seems smallish in comparison to being poured into a 12 oz mug. Dark brown in color with nice deep red edging in the light. A very nice beer in the glass. The smell is faint, a bit nutty but not what I had expected, sweet with more hop presence than I had expected. This one tastes very good, sweet and creamy up front with a lot of malt, the nuttiness shows up in the middle, toasty. A nice hop balance in the finish with a little more of that creaminess sneaking in....very nice and full taste....the creaminess that I speak of billows over into the mouthfeel, if not a little on the watery side this beer is quite full, good cabonation gives a little bit of bite. I really liked this one, probably not my favorite from Rogues but a nice drinker none the less. Try it, you will like it."
"Rogue is super consistent and you can add this to their list of impressive beers. This is a hell of a dessert brew."
"M,D,N Great taste beer. I often look at brown ales as sort of a novelty. Not sure why...this beer is a reminder of how good they can be. Review was a bit short becasue I lost the first review in transisition."
"Smell is sweet, with hazelnut and some doughy malt. Taste is malt, a touch of chocolate, and hazelnut. Very sweet but not excessively so. Mouthfeel is decent--a little thicker than average with light carbonation. Since I like sweet/malty beers, I could drink this for a while, especially with a little something to munch on just in case. It's a real bummer that there's no head retention or lacing; this beer taste good and I wish it looked good too. I'm not sure it's a bad bottle, since the taste is good, so I'm confused, given other people's reviews."
"Had this on-tap at Brewgrass and bought another bottle today. This is one of the best smelling beers I've had. The first thing you notice when you have a drink is the flavor of the hazelnut. It also has a kinda caramel taste to it. It is a deep brown color with minimal head. I thought enough of this beer that it is the first one I sampled at Brewgrass that I went out and bought. Rogue brews some mighty fine beers. I'll certainly buy this one again."
"The Rogue Hazelnut brown had very dark body and little to no head. The aroma was very impressive with chocolate, brown sugar and nutty hints. The mouthfeel was clean and very smooth, and it had a wonderful sweetness, characterized by chocolate, toffee, caramel and nuttiness. It finished excellently with a sweet smoothness I rarely find in browns. I highly recommend this to people like myself who are constantly unimpressed with browns."
"Very tasty and complex this one. I'm not a nut-brown fan, but maybe i am now. This had a good medium body and could possibly pass as a porter... subtley complex if that makes sense. I will definitely serve this on the holidays and keep a bottle in my refrig."
"This is a very complex, yet well-balanced American take on the brown ale. I wasnt sure what I would think about the hazelnut character, as Im not a fan of hazelnut coffees, but it complements the other flavors well and does not seem out of place here. Serious props to the fellas at Rogue for this one."
"overall: excellent american brown. i didn't think i'd have much better than the india brown by dfh the other night, but i think i have. aroma is better here, and taste and balance is the slightest little bit better as well. two thumbs."
"This brew pours a dark brown, almost black, with a small with head that recedes within seconds. The aroma huge. Chocolate, nuts, more chocolate. The taste is chocolaty too, with roasted flavors as well. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with ample carbonation. Overall, this beer seems like a cross between a brown ale and a porter. Whatever it may be, it is damn good."
"Drinkability: The was a wonderfully drinkable beer. In fact I stopped by a local shop to pick up several of the ""20-oz bottles"" on my way home. A $5.30 price per bottle is a bit of a kick-back, but only slightly. Others have said this would be a good ""dessert-beer"" and I agree, however it worked well in a ""chips and salsa sitting around a table talking"" format as well. Was a good pairing with the queso dip actually."
"A real dark reddish brown color,very nice,but the head is smallish.This has a real nutty,hazelnut,and chocolate aroma.I don't have a great nose,but this is very strong.This tastes great!! A real strong nutty,creamy, chocolate flavor.This is delicious. This has a light/medium feel for a brown ale,very drinkable.Another awesome beer from Rogue."
"Pours a thick, dark brown color with a dense tan-colored head that has excellent retention and a soapy density. I smell roasted malts along with toasted bread and smoked/burnt nuts. The taste is incredible! A blast of coffee, nuts, brown sugar, and sweet malts. Rich and complex and yet not intimidating. The finish is bittersweet with a hint of semi-sweet cocoa. An excellent beer that can be had over and over again with ease."
"After dancing around this beer for some time, I finally got arround to trying it. Smells like a really good nut brown ale. Lots of barley malt, almonds, hazlenut, chocolate and roasted malt with a fermented sour to the nose. Looks almost opaque and dark brown. Lightly headed with a tan lace. Tastes like a big flavored brown ale with ameretto mixed in. Flavors of hazlenut, cocoa, barley malt, and caramel remain strong into the finish. The beer wears a bit grainy and astringent, but not to deterring levels. Finishes a bit thinner than the initial sip. Could be a bit creamier. Still-good beer."
"Can you tell that it's one of my favs? ;^)"
"22 ounce bottle. No freshness dating."
"The only reason I dont give the drinkability a 5.0 is because its a bit sweet, as a desert beer should be.... but really, I could drink a whole lot of this beer, and the abv isn't so high to make that a problem. A must try in my book."
"Had this Rogue variation on tap. I think it might be the same recipe as the Morimoto but it definitely has a different flavor profile on tap. I like the bottle version but this stuff is really good on tap. Dark brown, hazelnut, color. Nice creamy tan head. Moderate lacing. Aroma is coffee with hazelnut and more nuttyness. Flavor leans on the sweet side with caramel and toffee malts. Nutty base. Lots of roasted hazelnut flavor in here. Creamy. A bit of coffee in here. Finish is somewhat dry but lingers. Mouthfeel is excellent. The flavors transition and work with each other quite well. There's a nice all around thickness to this beer. Better on tap than bottle imo."
"Taste was some chococalte, hazelnut, caramel, with a sweet malty finish. Color me crazy, but this reminds me somewhat of a dopplebock when it gets a litte warmer. This one goes down very smooth, with only a touch of bitterness."
"The aroma got my attention, but the taste (which has a smooth mouthfeel) keeps me contemplating the overtones each time I taste this deep mahogany brew. The initial frothy head didn't stay as long as I'd like and lacing was marginal after inital pouring of the brew. I would have expected this beer to be really sweet and not very drinkable, however there is a nice hop balance at the finish. Not too heavy in alcohol so I was able to open another ""bomber"" to share with the wife as the evening chill set in tonight. A very interesting offering indeed."
"Good amount of hazelnut flavor and more detectable in the after taste. Good smooth beer that is great for a after dinner drink."
"Overall: A very nice sweetened brown ale to drink as a dessert or at the end of the night."
"Definitely a highly drinkable beer worth your $$$. This is easily the best brown ale i've ever had."
"The taste is truly delicious. Malty bitter chocolate goodness with hazelnut undertones that are most easily detected after the post-sip exhale. The rich, smooth feel makes it extremely drinkable. Very good beer."
"Overall: A solid Rogue offering and a great after dinner beer. May be too malty ""sweet"" for consumption anytime but after dinner. Makes for a nice desert beer though and I enjoyed the infused hazelnut-in taste and aroma."
"Deep brown, caramel around the edges. Good, very fine lacing. Does smell faintly of hazelnut, more like chocolate though--kind of like cake icing. Taste is too malty upfront, but has a nice roasted, nutty finish. Too much unbalanced sweetness. Not as good as I had remembered."
"This is a very drinkable beer. Where this one lacks in nose it makes up for in flavor. I highly recommend this beer."
"Drinkability: I couldn't finish the glass. Didn't want to finish the glass, and my wife didn't finish hers. I'd say that out of the 22 ounces in that bomber, we drank maybe 8 combined, and it was 8 too many. I seriously don't know how people can drink this. It's painful."
"Taste is malty no real noticable hops here a bit bitter on the finish. The head dissapears fairly quickly with minimal lacing. A medium bodied beer but very tasty. The taste of the nuts really explodes in your mouth. A good desert beer. If I can find this brew again I will buy some more for sure."
"Thanks Jason and Jenifer."
"An interesting beer, but a bit too much in the hazelnut category for me."
"I might sound crazy but I could see this going very well with waffles or french toast. Very sweet and full-flavored yet, perhaps a bit much. I'd probably have to switch it up after a glass or two. Still, you have to respect Rogue for not creating your typical brown ale."
"The tastes blend together amazingly. + I also don't think the beer is too sweet at all, though it is very sweet. This would be great with desserts, in fact great as a dessert. This beer is now one of my favorites."
"Poured a crystalline dark brown with a thick frothy head that held, laced well. The nose smells of caramel candy, perhaps sweet chocolate. The nose ~feels~ weird too as you can tell it's fizzing away. Tons of malts, perhaps a bit overly matled, a bit roasty, pleasantly smooth though. The carbonation was good and it already had a thick feel to it. Reminds me of some cold coffee concoction you might get a Big Bucks."
"Pours a rich deep reddish brown with a light brown head. Smell is wonderfully rice and full of hazelnuts. Notes of caramel and chocolate are noticed too. Taste is great. Every bit as good as the Morimoto was, maybe a bit richer. Almost like drinking a less chocolate laden nutella. Very rich and a bit sweet. Makes a wonderful after dinner drink. Mouthfeel is smooth and silky. Drinkability is good, but perhaps a bit rich for every day consumption. Might even go well with a roasted pork or game dish if it featured nuts."
"Pours a dark brown with some orange tint. A 2 finger head and very good lace. A nice rich malty smell but not a heavy roasted smelllike a porter or stout. Maple and nut aromas are abundant. A slightly roasted malt dominates with flavor with strong maple and nut flavors. A slight coffelike bitterness hits in the aftertaste. Slightly buttery with medium carbonation and good drinkability. A nice session beer."
"Medium brown color with mild orange highlights. The beer was topped by a decent tan colored head that receded quickly back into the beer. The nose has a lot of caramel malt with a finish of toffee The taste is more sweet than I expected. Over the top on caramel, it comes close to chocolate. There is a little fruit on the finish in the form of pears and apples. This beer is well rounded, why cant all brown ales be like this?. Smooth, very rich mouth feel. Extremely high drinakbility. Wow."
"Gas 'n go: If there is a better brown out there , I'd be curious to try it. That being said, this is a good brown but on dimensional and cloying. I won't try this again, but it was cool to try. Forgetable, but not regreatable and edible."
"This is definitely a dessert beer albeit a good one. Definitely worth a try. Cheers."
"D&N: Nothing special here. I'll give this beer another go in a few months. The Wilhelm smell is just creeping me out. Shame to say, but the rest of the bottle in the fridge has a date with the sink."
"Appearance is a deep burnt sienna with ruby trim, beige foam and lace. Aroma screams MALT! along with a scent of mixed nuts and plums. Initial taste has sweet roasted malt, hazelnuts blending into leafy hops and burnt chocolate. There is an understated hint of dark fruits. Medium body and good carbonation. Perfect with something sweet."
"deep opaque brown color with a thick tan head that faded fast. lacing slid back down glass into the brew. roasty malt smell that was sort of singular but faint. roasted hazlenut taste with sweet malt and some chocolate notes - very rich. bitter hops tail wrapped around sweetness in the finish. smooth yet substantial mouthfeel. well-balanced but i would drink it more as a treat than as a session beer. would be good paired with sweet foods i bet."
"very very enjoyable. I'm sorry I waited so long to give this one a try."
"This is my favorite Rouge offering that I've had."
"Poured from a 22 oz bomber picked up from Riley's here in Madison. One bottle left so I had to give it a try. Looks beautiful out of the bottle, a deep roasty brown with a big tan head with some staying power. Smell is very subtle, roasted malt with some nuttiness. Taste was subtle as well with roasted coffee and sweet malt flavors with a nice hazelnut finish. Mouthfeel is rich and velvety. Definitely a good session beer, could have drank it all night. Was a little more subtle than I was expecting, but overall a tasty brew."
"A great dessert beer."
"Very dark brown, nearly opaque with cherry highlights. Thick, foamy, tan head. It smells of wood and alcohol with a vague sweetness. Upon tasting, you get a blast of sweetness: perhaps dark chocolate. Then, there's a nutty taste which is quickly drown by alcohol taste. Fades into a grassy finish. Very drinkable in taste, but the alcohol content was too much for me to drink too much of it."
"Not much head that's yellowbrown. Beer is dark brown. Nose gives hints of the mentioned hazelnut but is mostly sour& carramelic/choclate. Some hops and litle roasty. Taste is very dry and sour, roasty, portlike hazelnut liquor with dry andlightbitter aftertaste. Good brew but mouthfeel misses fullness& body of malts that darkbeers normally have. Easy drinkable."
"Nice solid beer to have once in a while, though it may be a little hard to pair with things."
"This is a very easy to drink beer, I often buy at my local. For some reason its the only Rogue they sell. Pours a deep amber, the nose is very fruity. This beer tells me to relax. Nice and malty, I have tis beer close to me when I need it. Good brew."
"Pours a dark amber/brown hue with a thick tan head that dissapates quickly. Aroma is hazelnut, milk chocolate and toffee, very appealing nose. Taste is very malty, flavors of hazelnut, milk chocolate, caramel and a light hint of hops bitterness. Finish is slightly sweet and nutty, mouthfeel is creamy, smooth and moderately carbonated. A huge brown ale from rogue, highly drinkable but complex."
"Drinkability: I could drink this with some nice, Texas barbecue or chocolate cake. Im almost ashamed that I didnt have any of either on hand when I had this. It turned out to be rather drinkable, though. I didnt have any problem getting through the bomber."
"Pours a porter-like dark-brown from the bottle. A few fingers of nice tan foam and relatively good head retention as well. Smells quite sweet and malty, with nice smoky and nutty undertones. The flavor doesn't really live up to the aroma unfortunately. Starts off well enough; malty, nutty, smoky, and strangely refreshing. As the beer warms, however, it develops a sticky sweetness that begins to overpower the palate. The hops are essentially missing-in-action, so there's not much here to balance the sugars. Sticky and medium bodied in the mouth."
"so long as you like hazelnut."
"Overall a great beer. I would love to have this in my fridge all the time."
"Id return to the Hazlenut. Its certainly a unique brown ale."
"Pours a nice reddish-brown, producing a nice foamy head. Very distinct teriyaki smell and taste. Just a hint of hazelnut. Mouthfeel is very smooth with no bite, but it is still a little thin for my tastes. Good spicyness. A little coffee-esque like most brown ales and stouts. I'll drink this again sometime. It might be better if it's a little colder."
"Served out of a 22 oz bomber. Pours a deep mahogany with a thin tan head. Smells great--hazelnet, toffee, caramel, and honey--very sweet smelling. Taste is very sweet, hazelnuts with a hint of chocolate. The mouthfeel is medium bodied but very creamy and smooth. The sweetness never gets too cloying, so I think I could have a few of these."
"Interesting beer. Appears a nice dark brown, some light coming through, with a substantial head. Smell is great; nice and nutty, hazlenutty that is, with nice creamy chocoloate and coffee accents, though not overwhelming. Taste is much the same. This is almost a bit too ""tasty"" for a beer, if that makes sense. The taste is of course great, don't get me wrong, but it's almost like I'm drinking a cappucino. A little too much artificial flavoring if you ask me. I like my beer a little more beerish, with more emphasis on the malts and hops. However, there's a great smooth mouthfeel to this. If they reduced the cappucino flavor a bit this would be a classic beer, although as of now it's a bit wimpy due to the flavoring."
"Taste is semi sweet malt at first, a wave of bitter nutty, hop feel comes into play then a sweet hazelnut finish. There is smoothness in the flavor that is pleasant to the taste buds. Not too sweet or bitter and very flavorful. A great example of a Brown Ale"
"from the bottle. poured a mahagony with a nice tan head. witch some nice lacing. aromawhat else but hazelnut, honey, brown sugar, malts, a nice nuttyness, plums and raisins. flavor unfortunately they were weak, but did get some hazelnut, honey and just a touch of coffee."
"Tastes of rich caramel malt. Nutty. Lots of hazelnut, almost overwhelming at times. Milk chocolate sweetness. Velvet smooth but just a touch thin. Take the hazelnut out and it's a top notch brown ale. With the hazelnut in, it can be a bit too much and offputting. Not bad but not a favorite."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" tan head over the slightly cloudy dark reddish brown brew. Frothy head lasts well, and laces well. Aroma is creamy, malty, and a bit nutty. Taste is sweet, husky brown malts with a hazelnut finish. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both good. Enjoyable brew."
"This beer pours an auburn, dark red color. The head is tan and fades rather quickly. Like the name would suggest, it smells of hazelnuts. It also has a slightly malty smell. There are faint scents of cinnamon. It tastes very sweet. The hazelnut flavor is apparent. It has a lightly toasted maly flavor. There is also a slight chocolate taste to it. This beer is creamy and smooth. It is carbonated just right. This beer is medium bodied. It is a very good beer. As with the Morimoto Hazelnut Signature Ale, this beer might not make the best session beer due to the very sweet flavor. If you can find this beer, it is definately worth your time and money."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass that yielded no head or lacing. Clear, dark brown in color. Hazelnut and some dark malt with a bit of hops in the nose. Hazelnut and the prickley carbonation were the first two things I noticed in the first sip. I think the hazelnut was a little bit overdone because it was in the forefront with the maltiness, carbonation and hops battling to show up. Relatively moderate in body with a bit too much carbonation. Overall, not that impressed. Not bad but I don't think I will spend another $5.00 for another bottle."
"Body is a ruby red brown with a small tan head. Some clumps of lace were left as the head stayed afloat. Aroma was simple but appetizing, caramel malt and a fairly strong nuttiness. A little on the sweet side. Flavors of caramel and the nuttiness combine for the majority of the flavor. Some notes of toastiness. Ends on a bitter nutty note. A bit light in the mouth, this is smooth and goes down easy. Complements the taste very well. Drinkability is good with the only knock being the sweetness would be a bit much after a few. A nice tasty and easy drinking treat."
"Smooth and creamy, medium to thick bodied, with fairly big carbonation. Goes down nicely, and rather drinkable. Sexy."
"Good stuff nonetheless."
"What a ridiculously drinkable brew! Pours dark dark ruby from a 22oz bomber. Smell is unreal... hazelnuts, cinnamon, maybe a little creme brulee? Taste is smooth, satisfying, creamy, definite hazelnut notes with some subtle spicing and a slightly chocolatey creaminess. Very very easy to drink. Mouthfeel is rich and you can definitely swirl this one around a bit to get all the relevant flavors."
"Overall a nice take on the brown ale and dessert beer categories, I wouldn't hesitate to pick up a bottle of this again."
"Drinkability is great for this style and can be a session beer for some."
"Pours a beautiful ruby color with a few brown highlights. Nice head and head retention, about a 1/2 inch head that settles down to 1/4 inch. When you swirl it in your glass, it clings to the glass and gently falls down the side. Aroma and taste go well together with some nutty flavor and aroma as expected. I don't like hazelnut coffee, but I do enjoy this beer. Good, but not exceptional. Very clean and balanced toward the malts, but not something I'd go out of my way for."
"Rich chocolate color with a great tan head with thick lace. The taste was sweet at first, with a huge thunderclap of malts that followed. Only a little twist of hops, then a lingeing, sweet and oily hazelnut aftertaste. Easily one of the most creative beers I've ever had that was actualy drinkable. It is pretty rich though, almost desert-ish."
"Drinkability: Highly drinkable. Not cloying, the hazelnut extract flavors melds nicely with the natural beer flavors. Id definitely have another if there was one around."
"Very drinkable and yet another good beer from Rogue. A solid beer from a quality brewery."
"All in all a very tasty brew and one I'll certainly be seeking out again. My biggest fear was that this would be a novelty beer: ""Oh, look! We put nuts in our nut brown ale!"" but those fears turned out to be unfounded. The hazelnut extract was a good compliment to the brown ale and was in appropriate proportions so as not to be overwhelming or distracting."
"This rates as the best brown ale I've ever tried, hands down."
"Pours a deep brown colour, with a creamy brown head. Wonderful aroma of hazelnut, toasted notes, chocolate and grain. Smells like hazelnut chocolate. By far, the best brown ale I've had. The hazelnut flavour is insane. Shots of hazelnut flavouring, rich, nutty, balanced by a good bitterness. Wonderful, easy drinking brown ale. Enjoyed by all of my friends."
"Such complexity. Such balance. This beer is truly one of the kings of its style."
"The beer pours to a nutty brown color (imagine that?) with a slight red haze when held to the light. The head could have been better, but it was enough to keep my beer fresh from the stale air without being too much. The smell is also quite bland compared to the explosion of sweet caramelized malty goodness paired with hints of hazelnut, chocolate, coffee, and hops bitterness. I am hard pressed to think of a tastier brew, especially after having polished off a few bombers of this at my friend's house just a moment ago. I would recommend this to anybody, regardless of their preferred style."
"Drinkability: This is a great dessert beer. Not overly sweet or strong, but suited for drinking with sweets. It paired really well with a slice of chocolate pecan pie."
"This beer departs the bomber a rich brown color with a small head that calls to coat the beer. The nose is very nutty, some roasted and a slight chocolate character. The flavor follows suit very well. Full flavored chocolate covered nuts. More flavor than I remember in any brown ales I've had recently. The feel is very creamy and smooth, moderate to thick on the feel. Nice nice beer. Thank you Rogue for making this one available. I think that this beer could easily become a standard for every season. Not too thick or thin, dark or light. Just balanced really well with a vey nice flavor. Bravo."
"Totally refreshing and full flavored. Can't think of many things that I would like to relax with more than this. Bring on the next one!"
"One of my favorites from Rogue and definately drinkable, now to only find it on tap somewhere..."
"overall, one of the better beers in the rogue series. surprised it's not a seasonal- perfect for the holiday months."
"Drinkability- Better than average brown ale IMO. Would definitely try again. Almost like a stout/brown ale mixture."
"Another screamer from Rogue!"
"Overall Impression: I enjoy the smell a bit more than the taste. The nut flavor is a bit artificial tasting but not horribly so. I think Id like the unflavored version of this brown ale. To me, its very close to the other Rogue Hazelnut. A touch sweet for a session and the bomber is probably best split with friends as a dessert."
"Definitely a good session beer."
"Another of the dark rich beers had during the day,pours a deep brown with some amber highlights thr out a nice creamy looking head that leaves a light amount of lace,big rich aromas some sweet cream and vanilla with only a light hazelnut note.Taste up is of dark roast coffee going into a light mocha flavor with that hazelnut flavor coming thry late and even more as it warmed.A rich flavorful brown ale somewhat sweet but not cloying a good dessert beer I would think."
"On tap. Dark brown cloudy liquid with a very thin off-white head. Small amounts of lace on the glass. Smells slighty roasty, with a nuttiness. Big malty flavors, not quite dark roast. Nutty sewwtness. Dry finish. Not much bitterness. Medium body, low carbonation. There is a lot of flavor in this brown. Easy to drink. Good beer."
"Appearance: Dark brown chestnut with some mahogany highlights with a dark tan head forms nicely dwindles at a good pace, much obliged to imbibe on this brew. Aroma: Chocolate roasts syrupy hazelnut goodness partially baked cookie dough what a freakin beer. Taste: Haszelnut sweetness standsout once again what can I say a true classic creation touch of herbal hops pac man yeast is evident definitely more toward a dessert beer. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied slightly stickey at times even carbonation no complaints from this compadre. Drinkability: Damn near excellent in my opinion just so worth the price five bucks for a bomber I'm loving it."
"A deep brown pour with a huge tan head. Semi sweet nose. A little nuttiness and some chocolatey notes. The taste was of dry cocoa, light chocolate and a semi-bitter and hazelnut finish. A mostly light bodied beer with a smooth creaminess in the mouthfeel. The finish lingered nice and long and had a good combo of malty, hop and nut. A very good brown ale."
"Very good and very easy to drink. I wish we could get kegs of this more often"
"This beer is a pleasant surprise. I'm a Rogue fan, but I wasn't expecting much after being disappointed by Morimoto Hazelnut. The secret, I believe, is that this beer is first and foremost a quality brown ale and the hazelnut flavor is complimentary in the best possible way. I should never have doubted. For my penance, I'll purchase a few more bombers as soon as possible."
"This is a tasty beer for after dinner, while not nearly as filling as many beers I would call ""dessert beers," this is definitely too sweet to be a session beer, at least for me. It was perfectly agreeable in a bomber-sized amount, however"
"Medium bodied and smooth, would taste good poured over vanilla ice cream. It could have been a lot better."
"The malts combined with the hazelnut provide a deep, rich flavor with notes of hazelnut, coffee, cream, nuts, chocolate, fruit and caramel. The hops are spicy but overtaken by other flavors. A unique brown ale. Very tasty."
"thanks tony for bringing this all the way from oregon!"
"Pours a clear cola brown under a two finger off white head that is quite think and fades quickly without leaving any lace. The nose is marvellous - strong and sweet of caramel and hazelnut. The mouth is quite prickly, light and clean. The taste is intense - nut and caramel, but more than a bit on the sugary sweet side. The taste reminds me of root beer. There is just the slightest hint of hops, but the finish is sweet, the aftertaste is sweet, the entire impression is sweet. Definitely disappointing."
"Drinkability: A 4, only because it's rich and thick. A couple of these bottles would probably be the most I could put down, even though I would yearn for more. An exceptional beer at every level, and I will be on the search for more Rogue styles to try in the upcoming days."
"I was really looking forward to trying this. Thank God, it was already chilled so I didn't have to wait at home. It poured an attractive brown with a decent head but nothing amzing. When I smelled it I cought something that I thought for sure was soy sauce, it might have been the marraige of the hops and the hazelnut, I don't know, but that's just what I smelled. When I tasted it though it was absolutely awesome! So was the mouthfeel. This is a beer I could drink a lot of. Hopefull they will put this in sixers (I've only seen the big 22 oz bottles). I definitely recommend this beer to anyone. Domo arigato Morimotosan!"
"Extraordinary drinkability for a brown ale. I can't recall rating an American brown ale higher than this one. Rogue has served up a full plate with this one. Loaded with quality malts, strong essence of nutty hazelnut, and a hops character to balance it all into a supremely drinkable brown ale. Well done!"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass from a 22 oz. bottle. Cola-esque brown color with a thin head that is retained throughout. The smell here is quite remarkable -- caramalized brown sugar and some definite nutiness -- it just smells like a candy bar. Then the first sip -- and I'm a little disappointed. It's good, it just doesn't live up to the aroma. The brown sugar is there momentarily up front, and the hazelnut flavor is alos apparent, but this quickly dissolves into a relatively thin and astringent finish. This actually makes the brew a bit more quaffable than your average brown ale. I suspect this would be better on draft, and would welcome a pint in the future."
"Pours a very deep browninto a sam smith tulip, with subtle maroon highlights at the bottom of the glass. Smells of brown sugar, and yes, hazelnut, with some light chocolate tones in the background. Taste is purely from the sweet side. Very chocolatey, a lot of hazelnut flavors. Finish is dry, from light hops. An above average beer, not rogue's best, but very good."
"My new favorite brown ale, happy to have had the chance to sample it in Vegas. Came in a 650 ml brown bottle, with silk-screened wrap-around label. Pours out with a clear sexy ruby chestnut body, creamy off-white head. Toasted malts, sweet nuts, and mild chocolate on the nose. Chocolatey malt flavour, with toasted nuts and a light hop finish. Slight mocha coffee rounding out the finish as well and melding into the aftertaste. A light mouthfeel for such robust flavour. Still, this has become a definite favorite of mine, a fantastic brown ale, it could easily become a daily standard if it were so easily available."
"I also paid $4.49 for a 22 Oz. bottle, which is a little too much for a college student such as myself. Still, it is fun to spring for stuff like this every now and then. Appearance is a very dark brown with a creamy, light brown head. Smell is nutty, fairly strong, but not overpowering. Taste is mildly nutty, however I was expecting it to be a little more intense from the aroma. Note: Let this beer warm up a little to unleash more nutty flavor. This is nicely balanced which adds to a nice drinkability. Still, I wish the nutty flavor was stronger. Overall, this is a really good beer, but lacks something to be an all-time great."
"I am very glad I picked this beer to try. This is the best beer I have tried so far in my short time with the BA site. I will be sharing this experience with all the beer drinkers I know."
"Pours a dark mocha brown with ruby streaks, the lightish tan head is a nice thickness at first then settles to average. Lacing is average as well. The smell is strong on chocolate covered nuts, the hazlenut is noticable but not overly offensive. The taste is very caramel/molasses, slight traces of nut but doesn't throw off the sweetness, a slight bitter hop blends the beer into a solid creation. Medium to almost full bodied, smooth and rich, very good dessert beer."
"I didn't know what a hazelnut tasted like until I took a drink of this. I like hazelnuts. The choclateyness really works well with the nuttyness. This medium bodied beer seems to stick around in you mouth for a while. Man this is good. Probably the best Rogue ale I've tried so far."
"Overall - Good beer with a great initial richness that is more apparent as the beer warms. Not the best example of a Brown Ale, but one that is certainly worth tasting."
"Drinkability: Moderately drinkable beer, nice and smooth but the sweetness would have me looking for something else after two"
"This is a nice beer with a well balanced flavor. It would be great with a chocolate dessert."
"This beer pours a not too dark ruby red with a big head that disipates quickly. Smells of fruit, peach/plum and very seet malty aroma. The taste is complex with a nutty/plum taste mixed in with chocolate undertones. The mouthfeel is thick and and almost reminds me of taddy porter, but I may be halucinating. This beer is very drinkable, however I couldn't do more than two bombers in a session. Good job Rogue, however I did expect more seeing as how Morimoto is endorsing this beer. I am a big fan of Iron Chef."
"Overall a pretty interesting, fairly aggressive brew. Admittedly hard for me to judge because I have had very little experience with brown ales. In any case, very drinkable, wish I had another."
" Slightly sticky body, but overall very nice. Couldn't drink more than one of these in a session, but who would want to? It's a wonderful, unique beer. Great companion while watching Morimoto battle it out on Iron Chef."
"This to me is a desert beer. Tastes like ameretto to me. By the end of the glass it's almost barleywinesqe in it's warming affect. If you like things a little sweet, give this beer a shot."
"An excellent ale... I look forward to trying their Morimoto Hazelnut beer."
"This brown poured a clear, dark chestnut color with light brown, creamy foam that settled. The smell was of dark caramel with a very light nutty aroma. The taste had caramel and faint hazelnuts with hints of coffee and toffee. There was a very light sweetness followed by a very light bitterness in the finish (hops, tannins?). The mouthfeel was dry and smooth with medium-full body and modest carbonation. The flavor lingered nicely. This was a very flavorful and enjoyable ale! Delicious on tap -- I will have to try it from a bottle someday."
"22 oz. bomber with a silkscreened smiling Chef Morimoto inspecting a mug. Pours dark brown with reddish highlights. A small tan head quickly fades to a lasting thin foam ring. Smell is malt with hazelnuts. It smells like it's going to be really sweet... but it isn't. Taste is toasted malt with hazelnut flavor and a bit of coffee and dark chocolate. Smooth, hoppy finish with just a little bitterness. Light to medium body. A little alcohol warming in the throat as the beer warms. This is a good beer to sip over the course of an evening. Went well with a chocolate brownie I had for dessert!"
"I dind't think this was awesome in the bottle, but this past week on tap at Redbones...it was delicious. Pour was dark brown with reddish highlights. I thought it had a roasted nutella smell to it. Taste was nice flavors of hazelnut, coffee, and chocolate all rolled up...I sorta got Tootsie Roll flavor off the beer. A flavorful beer that was in good shape, and if I saw on draft would get again, it beat the bottle version."
"I suggest you try this beer from the bottle unless you live on the West Coast of the United States. Otherwise the beer may not live up to its -- deserved -- fantastic reputation. When it's good, it's hard to beat. But this pint I had was just a bit too dull. It was average when it should have been excellent."
"Surprisingly good, Morimoto-san. It pours a chocolate brown in color, with no head and no lace. The hops are even throughout the beer. The first hint of hazelnut comes in the aroma, but it is not as strong as I thought it was going to be when I tasted it. The hazelnut flavor was pretty subtle inbetween the earthy hops. A great beer for a tasting or to sip slowly."
"Sampled 3/20/04"
"Pours with a one-finger head that fades quickly to a ring leaving no lace. Deep, clear amber color. Low carbonation. Nose is a light malt. Light bodied which is surprising for a brown. Starts malty and then the hazelnut kicks in - very nice. The ABV is 8.8%. $4.60 for a 22oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"Notes: This is a solid brown. The nuttyness keeps the burnt flavors at bay, and makes the finish a bit smoother than some browns."
"A nice beer that is definitely worth trying again. Along with their chocolate stout, Rogue knows how to make dessert beers that aren't too sweet or gimmicky."
"I smell sweet caramel with a hint of raisin. I taste hazelnut, caramel and a bit of smoke. Lotsa fine cloudy bubbles dive down the gullet, leaving behind a winey finish, like port or cream sherry."
"This one is definitely session-worthy. No harshness with a very interesting flavor. Would go great with dessert too. The nuts provide a twinge of sweetness without going too far."
"It is a dark brown, darker then your normal brown ale, but as dark as a porter, it looks velvety and you cant see much light shining through. Smell is hazel nut, obviously, general nut smell as well as vanillia and a little bit of coffee. There is a bit to much of hazel nut flavor for my taste, if it it was a bit more subdued i would like the taste more. There are definate nut/vanillia coffee taste to it. Mouth feel is great, thick and creamy. It ranks low on drinkability due to the overbearing hazelnut flavor. A good overall beer, not something i could drink all the time, but could go very nicely as a desert beer, though the bottle has a picture of a cow and a pig, i assume suggesting to be drank with those two meets, but for me i could see it going real well with coffee ice cream with hot fudge on and nuts on top. ,aybe a beer float with some vanillia ice cream, the thick texture would lend well to that."
"The beer pours a deep dark brown color with a thick frothy light tan head that slowly fades. The aroma is exceptional. It has a nice malty core littered with dark cystal and chocolate malts as well as a wonderful hazelnut aroma. The taste is good. It has a smooth brown ale flavor with a darker malt feel. It has a creamy nut finish that is quite tastey. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn fine brown ale. It has tremendous flavor and aroma; a good sessions brew."
"Medium brown color, moderate head. Hazelnut, vanilla and caramel aroma. Taste is a blend of the hazelnut that greets at the onset, caramel and a grainy, malty, body verifying character swirls around in the middle, vanilla finishes it off. Malted milk balls come to mind. A gentle swirl regenerates the head and releases a fresh waft of the unique bouquet. Body light-medium, carbonation level is smooth and unobtrusive. Best consumed at cellar temperature. Rogue gets thumbs up on this brew and deserves credit for their creativity."
"Poured out a dirt brown color with some carbonation that is visible. Smell is very malty. Lots of roasted aroma is noted as well. Some caramel and plums can also be detected. Taste is where it's at. Malts come in the beginning along with some roasted flavors as well. Hops are in the middle, but quickly flare out and let's the sweetness take over. Chocolate undertones are there along with the sweetness. Not too thin and not too big. Perhaps one of the best Rogue brews out there."
"Pours reddish brown with mild carbonation. A nice head that quickly dissapates. Smells of nuts, coffee, and malt abound. Nice balance of carbonation, roasted malt, and coffee. Very tasty brew overall. I would agree with others that this is a nicely balanced beer."
"Overall, you get a terrific sense of balance when drinking this beer."
"Drinkability - very nice session beer if you're into the hazelnut flavor and all, but the concept is kinda gimmicky to me, even though I like this a lot. Maybe it's my predisposition, close-mindedness, I dunno. Anyway, it disappeared from *my* glass in a hurry. Not an everyday beer, but an outstanding treat."
"Wow. So much going on here ... i'll be back"
"Same beer as the regular HazelNut, so I am providing the same score. Kudos to Rogue for not making a run-of-the-mill Brown Ale. Pours a dark brown color with a medium light tan head. Nice spidery lacing. Huge caramel aroma along with the telltale hazelnut. Somewhat rich with a nice mixture of malt, nuts, caramel and hops in the flavor. The finish is rich and nutty. I like this one."
"The mouthfeel was smooth. Dry finish and the nutty flavor lingers on the tongue. Nicely drinkable and quite enjoyable."
"The mouthfeel was lighter than expected but full of flavor. It's nicely drinkable as well."
"Taste is super smooth, rich full chocolate, and nutty sweet carmel flavors. Sidewinding shots of hops, and that rogue flavor finishes up. I was afraid the hazelnut would either fade too much, or overpour but stayed true throughout. Easy drink, very good throughout, another winner from Rogue. Not sure what the difference between this one and the Hanzelnut Brown Nectar is, I had a couple years ago."
"This is a black brew with brown around the edges. Small tan head. The aroma is dark malts, chocolate, nuts. The taste is mainly roasted chocolate malts with nuts dominating the scene. Creamy mouthfeel/taste. A little thinner than i would have expected, not quite on par with the other rogue brews ive had, less than impressed."
"Taste / Mouth / Drinkability: Mmmm. First sip is smooth and rich, but not full. Sweet malts give way to a clean mouth and lingering aftertaste of hazlenuts and earth. Faint bitterness in the finish, light hops shine through as the beer warms and the sips are held longer. Incredibly smooth. Wow. This is the ultimate session beer. I'd guess a low abv, as nothing comes through to stop this from sailing back down the hatch. 22 ounces disappeared before I knew it. Really, very good. I wonder what the Iron Chef would pair this with? I think its so easy drinking it could go well with anything, but might do really well with sashimi."
"Hey, do a specially-flavored brew, do it all the way, that's what I say, and that's what Rogue does here!"
"Murky concoction with a brown color and rusty accents reminiscent of apple cider. Decent-sized tan head breaks down quickly despite persistent carbonation. Nutty, caramely smell is striking and pleasant but rather unidimensional. Chocolate-covered almonds; that's what it reminds me of. Nectar indeed. The smell translates cleanly to the taste--nutty, caramely malts dominate. Aftertaste is particularly pleasant. Exceedingly smooth, though a bit too watery. This is quite drinkable but too much of a one-hit wonder to be a staple in my refrigerator."
"Pours a dark brown color with ruby highlights and a tall fluffy light tan head that slowly fades into a ring of lace. Nose is buttery toffee and caramelized malts along with some fresh brewed coffee. Medium in body with a milk chocolate silky smooth texture. Taste begins with toffee and molasses followed by a bit of hazelnut liqueur and dark chocolate. Some mild hop bitterness comes across towards the end leaving a rather dry finish. Pretty nice brew but Rogue has many superior beers."
"Head is medium-sized, coarse, bubbly, tan. It tracks scant spots of lacing. Color is deep, deep red/brown. Clear and dark. The smell is a tangy toffee, with some molasses. Nutty, chocolate hazelnut in the front, with a thick, toffee, sweetish, caramel toffee middle. Some milk. Finishes with more tangy toffee, hazelnut and dark chocolate candy. Bitter aftertaste. This is a good, toffee, dark, tangy beer with a big bitter finish. Nice enough."
"A very nice nut ale, something to buy again, but the brown nectar is a bit better in my opinion."
"It pours a ruby-brown with a light brown colored head. There is a strong hazelnut presence in the aroma as well as some sweet malts. The body coats the mouth well. There is sweet malts with some caramel flavor as well as a nuttiness. There is some slight choclate that comes through in the finish with the hazelnut reminding me of praline."
"Notes: It is a nice solid brew, but not what's expected from a brewery of this caiber. That said, it is quite drinkable. Cheers!"
"s.d."
"Drinkability/notes: Absolutely superb, raises nut brown ale to a new level of excellence. Not to be missed."
"Sweetness takes the drinkability down a notch."
"Notes: This one was ""crafted?"" by Morimoto. I have no clue who that is, or why he would be good at deciding what a beer should taste like. He is some chef or something. This was slightly complex. Like all Rouges, it was fun to drink."
"Deep brown with nice reddish-orange highlights. Rising 1/2 inch tan head, leaves ample lace in big ropes. Lots of aroma, malty with chocolate, spiced cinnamon, and the impression of flavored coffee. Smooth mouthfeel, restrained and moderate carbonation. Hops are not noticeable. A light sweetness closes the beer, dryly semi-sweet chocolate the the finish and into the aftertaste. In comparison to the close (if not almost identical) Hazelnut Nectar, I got less of a cloying character in both mouthfeel and overall sweetness in this bottle. Still, a little gimmicky, but a well-done beer here."
"I couldn't tell much difference between this and the other hazelnut brew Rogue makes except it seems to have more extractness to it. Nice solid dark brown color with some dark orangey glowing edges, thin but firm creamy dark ivory head, faded off slowly, lace in small spots. Smell is light roasty chocolate and a big time hazelnut extractness to it, some wiffs have more hazelnut then others where others were nearly empty. Taste is about as smooth as the other hazelnut beer with some lightly favorable chocolate tones and hazelnuts, slightly roasty and a touch of quick sweetness. Nice airy nut-like dryness in the finish, yet stays sweet. Perhaps a bit too much in that regards. Again with some sips the extract is more evident then others. Seemingly off a bit comparingly to the original. Still, a nice creamy medium body encompasses it while it maintains an overall smoothness and drinkability. Good, but the extract stood out a bit too much then what the original portrays. However, it is quite nice and wouldn't turn it down for nothing and; albiet it's a bit one dimensional."
"This beer pours a gorgeous dark brown, but when viewed at different angles, it's a sexy ruby red. The head is a nice sweet tan foam that falls and makes a thick ring of foam at the interface between the glass and the beer. The nose is sweet and malty, and then a roasted smell comes through. Not floral at all. The initial taste is very malty, low bitterness. It really is pretty nutty. Then you get roasted malt and chocolate flavors. The finish is nice and dry, so dry you feel it creeping up the edges of the inside of your mouth. However, you're also left with a clinging, cloying thick feeling in your mouth. It feels like the beer actually crawled up your palate and sat there, and you have to muster up saliva and your tongue to wipe it down before the next gulp. It's strange because it's a little thin in the beginning, but it ends up so thick..."
"mostly soil colored brown with hints of a ruby red at the bottom of the glass. small cream colored head dissapeared to nothing...no collar or lace to speak of. disappointing appearance. strong hazelnut aroma in the nose. medium bodied with ample carbonation. soft roasted flavor with sweet and juicy hazelnut notes. sweetness seems right on point as it never gets too much. lightly hopped for balancing. more like a desert beer, nevertheless, i enjoyed this one very much. an excellent twist on the brown ale."
" As it warms I detect more hazelnut in the nose.The head thins out yet remains.Now more dark malt has arrived and the finish lingers a bit longer,with some more hops on the scene. Very nice this one.An easy to take relaxing beer.Morimoto san should be happy to have his name on this ."
"A nice dark amber with a nice chunk head and decent lacing. A rich hazelnut and malty aroma is very inviting. The following taste accents the rounded hazlenut taste. Mouthfeel is light to medium with an initial sweet flavor with a decent lightly bitter finish. Smooth and drinkable. An unusual flavored brew but an interesting change of pace."
"Clear and deep auburn appearance. Head is airy and fluffy. Retention is pretty good. Lace is sticky. Aroma is chocolatey, nutty, malty and a little spicy. The taste is smooth and nutty. Hazelnut is definitely there, but there's also a very appealing cocoa powder presence. The bittersweet characteristics of the chocolate/roasted malt/hop blend is pretty nice. Lingering dry cocoa and roasted nuts leave you yearning for more. The body is about medium full and the mouthfeel nicely carbonated."
"Nice brownish red ale with a small, cream-colored head that leaves in a hurry. Decent lacing. Aroma is immediately sharp and tangy before moving into sweet, nutty notes of chocolate and espresso. Taste is marvelous, with an immediate nutty sweetness that finishes dry and with an unexpected bitter bite. Mouthfeel is great: perfect for a Brown Ale and wonderful with a hearty meal. Drinkability is just fine, though I imagine that the unique taste would get in the way of mass consumption."
"I found it to be a smooth drinker, with the best part coming at the end of the sip. Starts out nutty, with no 'beer' taste, no trace of hops or malt, and then goes through a mild coffee flavor, then a bit of chocolate, ending at last with a hint of vanilla. Very pleasing. I would have given it a 5 except for the first touch to the taste buds struck me as a wee bit alcholy. But really good stuff, and a new favorite."
"Beef Notes: I like this a lot more than Rogue's Hazelnut Brown Nectar. There is much more of the promised Hazelnut flavor in this one. It's not something that I would drink all the time, but it is very unique and one I can certainly enjoy once in a while."
"Deep amber hue, thin tan head, great lacing. On the nose is a nice aroma of coffee beans, hazelnut and plums. Twangy up front, has the sweet/sour thing going on; caramel notes, bordering on medium bodied. A bitter, clean palate, with a thick malty based backbone, nil for hop detection, yet some nice nutty flavoring. A fine effort, but low on the drinkability level."
"A great sipping beer!"
"Deep brown with traces of ruby-excellent pillowy and long lasting head with clumpy lace. Aromas are nutty and malted. In the mouth the beer is crisp, refreshing and easy to put down. Good depth of flavor-reminds me of the French Chocolate with hazelnut called Rocher-I think that's the name. As time goes on though the nuttiness gets to be a bit of a bore personally, and I want to move on to something without nuts-a Michael Jackson (the singer mind you) kind of brew. I'd like to see what the Iron chef serves with this one. Worth a try in any case."
"Pours with a fizzy light brown head. Head reduces to a smooth layer of fine bubbles. Body is clear dark red, almost garnet, in color. Malt aroma is light, yet is still a bit toasty with notes of caramel. Hops are quite light, but noticeable. Smooth malty start with light caramel and nutty notes. Hop notes pick up towards the end, but are mild. Chocolate and roasted notes follow and linger alternating their influence with the hops. Seems to have some cream soda notes that come in from time to time. Very drinkable. Ive had this one a couple times already, and have enjoyed it each time."
"Overall, it was a delicious beer experience."
"ng"
"Brilliantly clear tawny bister hue. Stiff, burly light beige head leaves sticky, sparse lace. Hazelnut coated burnt chocolate cookie dominates the smoothly sweet, dessert like aroma. Becomes richer as it warms, with butterscotch laden, Werther's Original hints surfacing and adding a candy like complement. Seemingly more intense aromawise than the original Hazelnut Ale. Melted, buttery toffee in a pot of hazelnut infused liquid chocolate is the dominant malt impression. Malt sweetness is well integrated and controlled, and is of a stately, simple dark lovibond caramel nature. Hop bitterness is mild and serves only to taper residual sugar to prevent cloying sweetness. Trace minty noble esque hop flavor jives well with the obvious cocoa and hazelnut presence. Subtle, inobtrusive, brown malt derived singed biscuit tones arise as the beer warms. Medium bodied at best, with a mouthfeel ample in dextrins, but shy in proteinaceous viscosity. Finishes buttery with lingering carob and oil roasted hazelnut hints. A very tasty brew, yes, but seemingly not quite as balanced as its predecessor. It's more of a dessert beer or ""beer cordial"" now, due to the lower perceived bitterness. A fine brew, regardless."
"I do believe that this is a reformulation of the original hazelnut brown ale - and I prefer the latter version more. Same nice brown color. Hazelnut aroma was not as distinctive in the aroma. The flavor seemed a bit more tart and acidic than the original, and the hazelnut was not as noteworthy, almost more of an aromatic than a flavoring. Also, the hazelnut was more of an extract note than the more rich, roasted hazelnut flavors I recall in the original. A good beer, but the Iron Chef has not improved upon it."
"The beer disembogues a transpicuous deep ruby color with a Bunyanesque sized head that is spumescent in texture and a beauteous tan color, as it ever so slowly transmogrifies the lace forms a thick and glutinous sheet to meld with the glass. A sweet nutlike malted aroma dominates, hints of vanilla, quite fresh and clean, start quite sweet with the top a bit thin for my liking. Finish is moderate in carbonation with the hops personable in their spicy bite, quite dry aftertaste with a lingering bittersweet flavor, drinkable as all Rogue beers are, but certainly not their best Whatever the name."
"Another well made and tasty beer from Rogue."
"Very deep brown body with a perfect 2 inch tan head, rocky, with small and regular bubbles, fine lacing and lasting. Sweet nose, chocolate mainly with hints of maple and coffee. The taste is pretty malty, sweet, surprisingly very fresh with loads of nice flavors among which none really stood out, but honey, chocolate, milk, nuts, toffee, caramel, coffee, maple, rich cookies. Soft, creamy and chewy palate. Tremendous malt/hops balance, more on the malt size, but hops is noticeable, especially toward the finish where I noticed a woody/herbal hops flavor and a roastiness that added to the complexity. Great bursting vanilla aftertaste. Lovely beer which I'm frightened I won't be able to get a crack at near often enough living up here:( Two thumbs up to JoeT for this great desert."
"Had a nice head, and a deep brown color. Nice nose of nuts and, toffee and chocolate. Taste followed suite with sweet nutty goodness and of coarse hazelnut. Finish was semi dry to cleanse the palette. This review seems remarkably similar to my Hazelnut brown nectar review, same beer?, will we ever know..."
"A brown color with a two finger tan head. I really like the bottle. The smell was very nutty. The hazelnut smell is the perfect way to begin a good tasting experience. The taste was nutty as well, but the hazelnut wasn't overbearring like some other hazelnut beers I have tried in the past. It was well balanced with the slightest bit of toffee. A very good beer I will surely buy again in the future."
"My reaction to this beer vacillates between ""interesting"" and ""gimmicky"". By the time I'm finished I'm leaning pretty heavily toward ""gimmicky"". The sweetness is nearly bludgeoning in its intensity; the sourness is actually necessary to counteract it! It's certainly interesting enough to be worth a try, but I doubt I'll be coming back to it."
"Bought it for the bottle of course. Silk screened label featuring Chef Morimoto. How can I resist buying that? Pours a brown-cherry color with a quickly dissapating head. A good brown ale. Not to much bitterness, mostly sweet and malty with a distinct amaretto character. The addition of hazelnut is definately appealing."
"Garnet and brown colored with a thick light tan head. Nutty aroma atop a nice brown ale. Smells slightly hoppier than an English-style brown. Deep hazelnut flavor, almost like doing a shot of Frangelico chased with a hoppy brown ale. I like the complexity of this beer, a lot of different flavors going on- Kona blend coffee, toffee, cocoa... Slick on the tongue, very enjoyable."
"This is a treat for me. This pours a nice dark brown with an off white head. Little retention and virtually no lacing. Sweet nutty nose. Hints of bitter chocolate and a light hops profile. A hint of hops up front, followed by bitter chocolate and bready malts, then, at last, back back back back waaay back in the aftertaste, roasted hazelnut. The roasted hazelnut flavor just clings in the mouth. Excellent. Very smooth, full bodied brew. Creamy. This was my second brew from Rogue to ever try. I just had the new Hazelnut from them the other day, I thought it was excellent, in fact I thought i liked it more. Now that I'm drinking the original, I'm glad I bought several bottles to store. I had forgotten how awesome this brew is. Excellent."
"very darm ruby brow colr with a pretty thick tan head. when cold it gvies off a fairly strong grassy hops smell. when warmer the hops mello and the smell is almost all a pleasant coffee hazelnut. the taste of this changes a lot with the temp of the beer. When cold from the fridge it is pretty crisp with some pronounced hops flavors, somewhat fruity with the chocolatey hazelnut in the background. when it warms a little the hazelnut comes through big with chocolate and coffee flavors, the hops linger behind these much stronger flavors. in both cases there nuttiness to the taste with smooth sweet malt flavors and some fruity hops. thicker side of meduim mouthfeel that makes this a very tasty drinkable beer that doesn't sit too heavy despite a pretty rich taste."
"Note: This beer is tasty cold, but really shines as it warms up a bit. I recommend pouring the first glass direct from the fridge and letting the bottle sit out while you consume it. Unless, of course, if you dump the whole thing in a big liter mug : P."
"Great beer, not hoppy like most Rogues, but almost perfect. always a favorite."
"Beautiful cloudy brown color with a decent tan head that leaves a nice lacing in the glass. Chocolate and hazelnut aromas, chocolate and nutty flavors as well with a nice nutty sweetness, medium bodied with a smooth and creamy mouthfeel, finishes with a lingering sweetness."
"Nice looking brew. It's a deep clear mahogony red color with a light tan head that sticks around nicely. Aroma is good & malty, some what bready and slightly spicey. This is not a huge explosion oftaste, but pretty good still. Starts off with a mildy sweet nutty chocolate taste and a velvety mouthfeel, then dries up on the back end with a good dose of hops. Finishes with a slight burnt coffee taste. Very balanced brew. As it warms the tastes start to come through a bit more. Perfect amount of carbonation and a solid head make for a great mouthfeel. Easy drinking. This is what I would expect from rogue. Nothing over the top, just a good beer with my RDA of hops."
"A good solid beer for when you want something ""different"" but don't want anything too crazy. More flavorful than I remember the Hazelnut Brown Nectar being."
"Brown beer, very clear. Thin Tan head that does not last long. Not over the top Hazelnut flavor, but it does kick in in the finish, a nice subtle note. A bit of the Hazelnut note in the nose as well. I like that the sweetness in this beer is very subtle, I hate when these beers are over-sweetened. The front taste is malty, and I can't pull out any taste of the hops, which I was not really expecting to."
"An excellent job here, as far as flavored ales go, and I look forward to trying Rogue/Morimoto's Soba Ale."
"$3.49 a bomber."
"Drinkability  This is a fair rendition of the style, although I thought the hazelnut could have been a little more subdued and the ale better balanced."
"$5.00 in Omaha."
"Not entirely sure what to make of this one. A little gimmicky, but at the same time tasty - the h-nut is in good balance. Not overpowering like the Chocolate Stout. Decent."
"From a 22oz bomber, this one poured a deep clear ruby brown with an inch of tight tan head withplenty of lace. The nose is a healthy dose of malt and balanced hops with hazelnut and roasted notes, very alluring. The taste is heavy n the malt with roasted hazelnuts, hints of maple syrup, and earthy hops. the finish is rounded out with malts and slight hop bittering. This is really quite a fine drink, smooth and rich mouthfeel with medium carbonation that goes down easy. I had it solo, but could imagine this pairing with a number of different foods from appetizers to desserts.. well done.."
"Outstanding! I love this beer. What a terrific taste. The hazelnut is prominent, and the bitterness is just right. Once you've sampled hunderds of beers, it's hard to find one that's truly unique, but this one is. Only a somewhat thin body drops it below an absolute classic. Not a beer to drink more than one bomber at a time (IMO), but I will definitely will be revisiting this beer again!"
"Saw the Morimotos thinking they were different from the normal Rogues, but they aren't. Regardless, I've not had the normal Hazelnut. Pours a dark amber color with a small, thick head that sticks around for quite some time. I could not find the hazelnut in the aroma, but I did find some chocolate hints along with some sweet malts. The flavor really showed the hazelnut much better than the aroma. Other flavors were chocolate and roasted malt. The mouthfeel was a little thin and bitter, but a fairly decent beer overall. There are other offerings from Rogue that I will probably try again before this one."
"Pours dark varnished brown, thin head less than one finger. Smells of chocolate. Taste is nutty, yes on the hazelnut side. A undertow of chocolate. Mildly bitter. Like a nutty stout without the roasted flavor. Of the two Morimoto ales I've tried I prefer the Soba to this. Slightly sour aftertaste."
""
"Just when I think I'm over my seemingly endless worship of Rogue breweries, they hand me something like this. They have once again, as they have a thousand times before, managed to impress me."
"Poured a deep dark brown with rootbeer edges and a decent tan head. The aroma was very deep and rich - sharp coffee and chocolate malts, and maybe just a hint of hazelnut. The taste starts off with the same coffee from the smell, then kicks in a good dose of hazelnut that comes through the most in the aftertaste. Hints of chocolate also leave to thirsting for the next sip. The mouthfeel was a little thin but I did like the way that the carbonation fizzled in my mouth - it seemed almost like a hazelnut soda. Very good brew, nice and unique. Rogue truly rocks!"
"22oz. bomber poured into a pint glass. It pours a deep brown, almost black color with one finger of head. There is a fair bit of lacing left on the glass. The smell is a sweet malt and hazelnut aroma that is very strong. It fills the nose well. The taste is also filled with sweet hazelnut and a bit of caramel. Just a hint of hops on the finish. The mouthfeel is nice and strong. The drinkability is also very good. Probably my favorite nut brown."
"Served from (what else) a bomber. The good chef is on the label hoisting a glass. It's brown with a bit of amber and a tan head that disappears quickly. Although the hazelnut comes through minimally in the smell, it really dominates the taste. The overall flavor is a bit sweet and subdued. Unfortunately, not being a big fan of hazelnut in any form, the taste didn't really capture my fancy. It's a nice beer and I'm sure better than most ""flavored"" beers out there. The mouthfeel is right on and it does drink well. I guess I'm one of the few that preferred the Morimoto Soba to the Hazelnut."
"I found the Morimoto to be a bit smoother and less robust than the Hazelnut Brown Nectar, although they're pretty much identical. Looking at the ingredients on the back, they appear identical. Based on a back to back sampling, I'd say it's very close, but perhaps some small changes in malt ratio, with a touch more hazelnut flavoring. Almost so close it could be passed off as a slight inconsistency between different batches. Good stuff."
"Drinkability: I likes me some hazelnuts, and I hope the new Morimoto verson of this ale is not much of a recipe change. Not and everyday drinking beer, but not one to save for special occasions either. You'd better like nuts if you have this. It's not overly nutty, but it definitely informs the flavor profile."
"Dark brown color. Medium head. Aroma is nutty and malty. A medium bodied brown ale. This is a very nice nut brown ale. Nutty and malty, smooth and sweet. Mellow and very drinkable. This is a beer that is complex enough for the experienced beer drinker, yet simple enough to wean someone off macro-swill. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is malty sweet. Etched/Painted beer bottle"
"Overall better than average but I will not buy this again"
"This is a wonderfully smooth beer and is a bit nicer IMHO than the Hazelnut Nectar, but I hope that is still offered. They different in taste and smell even if the ingredients are the same. Both great."
"Overall: Very nice  is this really going to be replaced by the Morimoto Hazelnut Signature Ale?? I only wonder, because I think that this original, actually has the edge on the newly reinvented version. Ah, but what do I know?"
"this is apparently the hazlenut nectar repackaged, and yeah, it's got the same ingredients, ibu, aa, etc, but my bottle still tasted a bit different. there's still the nice deep amber/ruby colour, but the smell and the taste are more chocolate than nutty this time. seems to have a slightly fuller body as well, yet it was still smooth as hell. not much more to say. i'd still give it a try if you've already had and enjoyed the hazlenut, as you clearly won't be disappointed."
"An exceptionally drinkable beer..gets better as it warms."
"The trademark Rogue head action is definetly there in this one. A thick head formed immediatly and subsided to a 1\4 inch head that is thick and sticks to the glass leaving a little lace. Nice red color that is so dark as to appear brown. Aroma is of a coffeeness blended with sweet dark carmel and a distinct nutty aroma. Flavor is smooth and thick with very little malt bitterness and more of a sweet coffee flavor with a very obvious nuttiness that could never have come from malt. Hops are present but are here just to balance the malt character. Body is very heavy and goes well with this beer as there is little bitterness from hops or malt so it dosen't linger too much. Smooth flavor is very refreshing and is a nice break from the usual Brown ales I have tried. The only thing i have to say after drinking this beer is that if you want to try it be prepared for an unnaturally strong nut flavor. This beer is very very close to the Original Hazelnut Brown Ale Rogue does and i would like to know how Morimoto gets credit for this recipe."
"Pours out a redish dark brown with a small tan head. Big nut malt flavor. A touch of the fruity with quite the hazelnut makes this a very drinkable brew. Hops are present enought for the balance to stick. Overall a solid brew worth drinking. A bit sweet."
"A vigorous pour yielded only a thin yet creamy and condensed tan head atop a cloudy deep amber brown body. The head thinned out even more to but a slight film. Aroma is malty, nutty and with noticable hops present and hints of coffee and chocolate. Mouthfeel is very smooth with a creaminess to it. Flavor is reminding me of Sam Smiths nutbrown yet definately more bitter. Finishes a tad dry. Overall would be better if less bitter in my opinion."
"Another fine offering from Rogue, although I fear for nostalgic reasons that I will miss the Hazelnut Brown!"
"Thank you Jackson, Wyoming. I have now had a hazelnut beer though I still haven't eaten a real hazelnut all by itself. Weird. This beer poured a rich, rootbeer/ebony brown with a creamy tan head. I was amazed by how the aromas were detectable from three feet away! Luckily the smell was complex and inviting; mostly molasses-sweet/nutty malts, with a hint of roasted coffee. The sweet and nutty malts were there all the way, followed by an acidic, slightly tart, nutty, dry finish. Very well balanced. I have not had many nut browns, but this is bound to be one of the best (and most unusual?)."
"When poured out of the bottle the color produced was a clear dark brown with some tan foam and nice lace from start to finish. The smell of roasted malts and hazelnut was very appearent. The taste was of roasted malts, hazelnuts and a hint of chocolate. Well balance on the sweet/bitterness of the hops to make this ale a very pleasant tasting beer. I bought it at the brewery and was wondering if I could purchase it other than their. Oh well, just gives me another excuse to travel to Newport, Oregon to visit Rogue Ales again!"
"I really like this offering from Rogue. It is very unique to say the least. A beautiful glass of beer that is dark brown with a very thin, lacy head. Smell is very nice...yep, hazelnut, and just an overall 'nutty' smell. A fairly strong aroma. Taste is again 'nutty' and very malty as well. A somewhat carbonated mouthfeel, but its not too much. I'm actually reviewing this from my notes of a couple of days ago, and I had a question mark beside my 3.5 mouthfeel rating. I was comtemplating going a notch higher, but decided to leave it as is. I'll certainly be having another, and if this rating changes, I'll update it. A very drinkable, complex, and 'different' Rogue that is very enjoyable."
"This brew pours a creamy small head of light brown bubbles and a semi transparent dark brown body. With a mild malt aroma, this brew has a taste of caramel and spice with just a hint of coffee flavoring. It goes down very smoothly yet leaves a slight dry lingering after taste of the coffee flavoring."
"All this talk about hazlenut brown lately made me decide i should try it out, since it's been in the fridge for a month. I poured the entire bottle into a 1L glass, and it produced a deep hazy brown color, topped by a deep cream colored that shows good retention. Very nutty aroma that is comprized of hazlenut, caramel, nice roasted malt, some earthy hops and a bit of chocolate. The taste is a lot like chocolate covered hazlenuts, and it even has that slightly sharp nut aftertaste. Good coffee notes and some chocolate as well. Not as sweet as I expected, but still very good. Lack of sweetness probably actually helps the drinkability and the overall enjoyment of this beer. The mouthfeel is solid, but not as rich as some other browns. Still good though, as it is by no means thin. Drinkability is pretty darn good. Not sure where this ranks in my overall browns, but I'd guess a little behind Avery, DFH and Troeg's. A very solid beer."
"Overall Impression: If you read some of my other Rogue reviews, I was pretty disappointed by their lack of balance. But I've kept trying more of their beers because I they are a highly respected brewery. This is the third one I've found that I am happy with. Nicely balanced, tasty, unique. I can now safely say that Rogue is a capable, diverse, respectable brewery. Not all of their beers are hop-bombs."
"I feared that the hazelnut extract would be overpowering. Instead, it complemented the nuttiness of the malts. All around excellent, but the bitterness from Cascade and Saaz, two favorites of mine, clashed slightly from what should have been a very smooth and rich ale of the dessert kind."
"There's almost no head at all. The beer is an intriguing color... very dark brown, but there are some other colors hidden in there. Wonderful aroma - mostly toffee. It really tastes like hazelnut coffee. Toffee taste is in there, too. Some caramel as well. Strange brew, to be sure, but very good. Creamy and very drinkable."
"Personally I could drink this beer just for the smell, but I think I will have to drink it sparingly. It goes well as an after dinner beer."
"A strange one. Tastes like a Vanilla Coke/Newcastle Brown shandy with some hazelnut syrup and a touch more malt. Very odd, and unevenly balanced. The flavours don't blend well at all, really bad, especially when i had such high hopes. Another good reason for me not to like brown ales. Odd."
"Originally sampled on 30 January 2002. I am writing this review from my notes. This pours nearly clear, root beer brown w/ a slight tan head. Slightly sweet, nutty (duh) taste on the palate. This is a very enjoyable brew, thx beerguy101 for getting it to me"
"If you like 7-11 coffee bars, you will like this beer. It poured a nice dark brown with only a fairly thick white head. The lace disappeared soon after beginning to drink. The aroma was nearly nonexistant. Malt and hops were supposed to dominate the taste, but I only tasted the hazelnut. I was particularly surprised that the hop characteristics were not more evident. The mouthfeel was medium light and not really exceptional. I would drink this beer again but because of its unique flavor, I think I would limit my intake to one pint."
"Just altogether weird tasting. I dont like hazelnut coffee or hazelnut beer. The sweet malt and sweet hazelnut are not in harmony with each other and the hops dont really effectively counterbalance the overwhelming sweetness. This tan colored beverage with a fading beige/tan head has a hazelnut and sweet syrupy aroma. The thick oily body and sweet nutty taste, and hint of vanilla is just too much. The light lemony bitterness seems to be an afterthought. Do I detect a faint cappuccino flavor? An odd mealy mouthfeel begs for a chaser to wash away the sweet sludge. Have I mentioned sweet?"
"This brew poured a medium tan head with fine-small bubbles into my glass. It had fair lacing on the sides of my mug. The body was brown in color. This brew in my opinion has a coffee flavor to it which I enjoyed. There was no bitterness to this brew which is to my liking. It had a slightly sweet aftertaste to it that was not overwhelming to me."
"-F"
"This tastes more like a stout or a porter than a brown ale. But I like this beer a lot."
"It's no shock that a speciality beer branded for a Sushi chef would taste good with fish - but I have to admit I was surprised at how well a Hazelnut beer worked with fish. This is a good example of the style and a pleasant while perhaps not extraordinary in any way beer."
"Had an easy slightly oily mouthfeel that aids this beer's excellent finish. In all, it was a surprising delight, and could go very well with fall and winter foods - it certainly went well with my toasted wheat bread sandwich of peanut butter and honey (poor country boy snack). Calm and easy but so understatedly complex and excessively easy to drink. English brown ales tend to be boring or unappealing  this one is instead stellar for its style."
"It's a dark reddish brown with a foamy light tan. Hazelnut is noteable in the aroma along with some cocoa-ish notes from a softly sweet malt. It's medium bodied and the gentle, natural carbonation caresses the tongue. It's sweetly cocoa-ish and lightly fruity upfront, followed by a distinct hazelnut note in the finish along with a light, mildly roasted note in the aftertaste. It's well-balanced with a median bitterness that leaves the sweetness of the malt up front, but drys out the finish. Quite enjoyable and very drinkable."
"Measurements: 14 degrees Plato, IBU 33, apparent attenuation 73.6, Lovibond 36."
"My first review. I couldn't resist reviewing this one. This beer is such a treat! Nice thick tan head by the time I poured the second glass (first was a little too cold I guess). Began with a nice mild chocolate malt taste, very creamy, smooth, full mouthfeel, and finished with a little bit of hop, but just enough to keep it interesting. Left a hint of coffee and maybe toffee taste in my mouth. Wow, this is a great beer. If I could only have one beer a day I could live on just one of these a day. I'm really impressed with the Rouge beers so far."
"Very nice dark brown color, but where's the head? It's nowhere to be seen. Great aroma of vanilla and chocolate, and hints of coffee, but I'm not getting hazelnut, nor any hops. Flavor closely matches, but also has a hint of marshmallow. Overall the flavor is too sweet, and the mouthfeel is decidedly slick and oily with low carbonation. The body of the beer is not appealing to me. I would not choose this one again."
"So far, I've found Rogue beers to be good, not great, and surprised by the hype and aura attributed to this brewery by other BAs. They ARE, however of good quality, and very drinkable. If you've been curious about the fuss, you shouldn't be wary, as they are deserving of at least some of the accolades. Worth seeking out, at least to see and taste for yourself!"
"The hazelnut extract really shows. Overall this beer is quite nutty and also coffee-like. If you're into hazelnut coffee this one is a must find."
"It was hard to review this beer, at first it was hard to drink because of the large amount of hazelnut. Of course I was expecting it to be hazelnutty but the first few sips were a little bit too much. Once the palate settled down the true flavors came out, revealling a sweet flavor with a mild bitterness that is masked by the hazelnut flavor. The first part of the sip is sweet with a light hop aroma that eventually becomes bitter as the beer hits the back of the mouth. Great color and taste. Overall a very good beer!"
"Pours a deep mahogany color with a medium sized off-white head. The froth quickly fades down leaving a light lace on the glass. The nose is full of different aromas, such as hazelnuts, coffee, molasses, and roasted malt just to name a few. The taste is just as complexit contained many of the same properties as the aroma, with a hint of bitter hops at the finish. This is a very smooth and rich beer, its excellent to drink on a cold winter day."
"A bit thin in the mouth, but it's nice to see how many flavors can be packed into the beer nevertheless (especially for those of us who are accustomed to flavor coming only from thick, heady beers). Nice tip of tongue hops burn, a slip of honey down the middle, and a nutty aftertaste that adds wonderful character. So easy to drink... smooth and just complicated enough to inhibit gulping!"
"I could not pick up much in the nose, probably due to the smoke in the bar. There was the obvious slight nutty aroma, with a bit of coffee as well. The beer was a dark shade of brown with a thin tan head on top. The taste is quite unique. A roasty bitterness arrives at the start, followed by hints of toffee and a mild hop bite, and ends with an overwhelming nutty finish. The nut flavor is somewhat sweet, but certainly not overpowering, and is delicious. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy...reminded me of a cask conditioned ale. This is a great ale from Rogue, and a very interesting one at that."
"Ahh I love bombers. This brew poured a very deep brown color with a very creamy tan head that lasted for almost the whole brew. The lacing was in thick sheets around the glass. A good looking brew. The aroma was mostly sweet malt with some toasted malt as well. There was also some chocolate trying to make itself noticed. The taste was just as nice. Sweet malts is what hit me first being pretty sweet but not overdone. The middle has a sort of buttery taste, what is that Diacetyl (sp?). The toasted malt is also very noticeable in the taste. The aftertaste has a bread flavoring and maybe a little bit of chocolate. This beer has great balance to it. The mouthfeel is medium and goes down easy. Overall I really liked this brew. It's the type of brew I could drink all night as it is not very filling. Next time I'll have to grab a couple of bombers."
"Good beer, or maybe it just hit the spot. Either way, it's a good beer that I will buy again."
"Pour is dark brown, with a thick tan head that quickly settles to light lacing. Aroma is strong on the hazelnut, backed up with lots of roasted and toasted malts. Flavor is overpowered with the hazelnut, quite sweet (maple syrup?), with a hint of the roasty malts peeking through at the end. Mouthfeel is full, a bit sticky."
"The first thing I thought when I tasted this, was Newcastle Nut Brown Ale. I guess the only thing different, is that it is better! Sure, I really like the Newcastle, but this is a level above. For one, the taste is a little more complex. It is light, but at the same time, it has a stronger taste of roasted nuts. It's also a little bit lighter on the alcohol taste, so it doesn't overpower your tastebuds. Has a little bit of a dry taste in the end, but it's not too dry. All in all, it's a good ""ittle"" brew. Could this be the nectar of the Gods? Nah, mead is."
"This one just isn't doing it for me. After having two excellent beers from Rogue (Shakespeare stout and Dead Guy ale), this comes as a bit of a disappointment. The appearance is a very rich dark brown with no head at all. The smell has a very astringent quality to it mixed with the hazelnut extract. The flavor is of dark roasted malts, hazelnut coffee, and dark chocolate. The hops provide a nice dry aftertaste. Normally the flavors I've just described would have me foaming at the mouth, but the body of this beer is so thin, the roasted malt and coffee tastes seem more suitable for a porter or a stout."
"Tastes like an infusion of chai, chocolate, and beer -- three of my favorite things. Little hop bitterness. Very sweet but very tasty."
"Pours a mahogony brown with ruby highlights. A caramel colored head fades fast to a thin collar. Sweet malty aroma with a hint of (surprise) hazelnut. I smell mollasses and bitter chocolate. Very smooth. The usual Rogue bitterness isn't there, very little hop bite. It tastes like a decadent dessert, nutty & chocolaty. A little thinner than I had hoped with carbonation fitting the style. I will by this beer again. A real treat!"
"The drinkability of this beer will make me a repeat buyer of this beer, highly recommended."
" The taste is impressive and complex. The roasty dark malts hold the reigns for the most part, but the hazlenut also has a nice kick. The finish is dry and almost everything jumps in at the end including nuts, chocolate, and coffee. It is smooth and rich, and i can see myself getting this one many more times. This is one brew i would not be happy without."
"Another great success by Rogue."
"Decent head - settled pretty quick. Malty nose. The balance of Hops and malt in this one gives it a very unique nutty flavor that makes this one (In my humble opinion) the best Rogue I have tried. This is a real interesting beer to drink. The flavors seem to change as you drink it. The beginning was shockingly good with that wonderful nutty flavor being the first and most prominent flavor. Toward the middle of the beer the flavor seemed almost like pure hops and got rather bitter on the palate. As I finished it though the nuttiness returns to have a sweet finish. I highly recommend this one."
"-Oelergud"
"Nice toasty notes on the nose...pours dark brown with minimal head..a bit of a syrupy texture, but definitely one of the richest browns I've had..Hazelnut is very very subtle compared to Longshot Brown of about five years ago..You get the hazelnut on the long finish more than anything..nice smooth rich brown ale but I wish I could smell and taste the hazelnut more.."
"Poured with a slight head that dissipated quickly. Muddy brownish red in color, fairly opaque. Distinct nutty aroma. Nutty flavor comes through in the taste, and is followed by a twinge of hops. The maltiness and nuttiness combine nicely. Smooth, very nicely balanced. The mouthfeel is a bit thinner than I expected, but good for a brown ale. I especially like the fact that it's not overly sweet either. An excellent brew."
"As you place the glass up to your mouth, even before your real first taste, the scent gets you and want to drink deeply and greedily. You do, but you stop yourself to enjoy the full taste of this beer. Wonderfully smooth and seductive, nutty, balanced, perfectly hopped."
"The bottle proclaims this to be the ""World Brown Ale Champ."" Impressive claim, though it doesn't specify the awarding institution. Ayways, it was enough to whet my curiosity. Pours ruby in color with a medium-tan, creamy head. The aroma is enticing -- roasted malt and hazelnut. Not too strong, just enough to increase my excitement to taste the beer. And wow. The taste. First thing that struck me was the incredible creaminess of this beer. Hazelnut lingers in the background behind a chocolate malt body. Decent hop bitterness to the beer, but very unassertive. Just enough to keep the finish from being cloying. Hazelnut reasserts itself in the aftertaste to a very pleasant effect. All in all a terrific beer -- sweeter than many browns but complex and well-balanced enough to keep it interesting all the way to the bottom of the botle."
"One the best, if not the best, brown ales I've ever encountered. A very worthy competitor to Samuel Smith's Brown Ale."
"An excellent brown ale.  The aroma is fantastic.  Pours out to a dark brown in the glass with a light brown head.  Taste is indeed nutty, with a perfect blend of hops and malt.  It got better as it warmed up. This brewery knows beer."
"Deep brown color, with a large beige head that settles into a thin sheet on top of the brew. Generous amounts of lace all the way down the glass. Hazelnut aroma, along with sweet and earthy scents. Mouthfeel in a bit thin, taste causes you to expect more body, but it is still rich and creamy. Starts malt sweet, and then the slight hops come keep the malt in check. Finishes with a delicious hazelnut taste. One of the best aftertastes I have experienced. Very easy to drink, a real treat."
"Deep brown... almost opaque, with a thin tan lace.  Aroma of coffee, bread and hazelnut.  Flavor begins with bread and coffee, ends with hazelnut and a some hop bitterness.  Crisp, with a medium body and medium to high carbonation.  Rogue does it again... very tasty!"
"While there is nothing objectionable in the aromas or flavors, it does seem that that the ingredients of the beer stand out obtrusively. I take it as a cardinal rule of cooking, as well as brewing (or any art for that matter,) that if you can sense the conscious work of the producer, then they added too much. Call it ""contrived."" Bam! chocolate malt. Bam!, hazelnut extract. There is very little integration to this beer. No zen. No bliss. Nevertheless, for anyone craving overt stimulation, this is a sound beer, and entertaining. In a loud bar it might be completely appropriate. While it does nothing to hurt Rogue's deserved high reputation, it doesn't help either."
"Deep, dark brown-amber with a creamy tan head that pours big but settles quickly to about 2 or 3 cm, then disappears after a while. Wonderful rich nutty aroma, hazelnut of course, along with creamy malt aromas, mostly with roasted character. Kind of a nutty coffee aroma. ""Delicious"" is a good one-word description of the taste, but is also an understatement! Excellent hazelnut and roasted malt flavor with a small but easily detectable spicy hop backbone. Chocolate maltiness also plays a big role (originating from the chocolate malts used, of course). Just a touch of wood flavor as well. Medium body, but with all of the flavors it doesn't matter. Creamy mouthfeel that makes your palate cheer joyfully, and a dry, nutty finish. So drinkable it's gone before you know it. 22 oz. is almost not enough! Excellent and truly worthy of the word ""nectar", my only wish for this beer is for the head to stay all the way through."
"Here's a unique offering that most everyone can enjoy. The pour from a 22 oz. bomber appears dark brown with a full tan head. The smell is of caramel-ish malts with a dose of hops and is rather sweet. This is a tasty brew. Notes of sweetness - hazelnut, caramel and that subtle touch of hops - are present. Mouthfeel is quite smooth, and this is an easy drinking brew. A definite must try for fans of the brown ale style."
"Opaque, deep ruby in color with an aroma that is all nuts.  The flavor had a little coffee aftertaste and slight malt, but they were way overpowered by the nuttiness.  It was very smooth and full of flavor, and they certainly achieved the desired result of hazlenut, but it was too simple for me.  More malt and less hazlenut might have made this a more balanced beer.  Not a bad beer, just not one of my top choices."
"This is alright as a change of pace, but the bomber was too much for me.  It just got too sweet and fake tasting."
"Notes: A full flavoured brown ale with the nice addition of hazelnut extract. This is my kind of dessert beer, give me a square of tiramisu or molten chocolate cake and I’d be in beer heaven."
"The Nectar pours a deep dark reddish brown with a thick, creamy tan head.  Unfortunately, the head fades pretty quickly, leaving only faint traces of lace on the glass.  Rich aroma of hazelnut with coffee and chocolate.  Faint spicy hops also detectable when you 'look' for them.  Amazing taste - rich hazelnut, chocolate & caramel malts, with just a bit of hops for zest.  Rich and creamy brew, yet another winner from Rogue.  I'll have to try this one with breakfast some time."
"""Eat, Drink, and be Merry!"""
"I first tried this on tap and greatly enjoyed it; the bottled version less exciting. Soda pop-like effervescence, head fizzed, then fizzled like most sodas. Reminiscent of root beer or cream soda, especially in mouthfeel. Some nice caramel malt flavors accented by the hazelnut, with hints of coffee, cream, and chocolate -- but in all honesty, that's about it. Little in the way of hops which is good for this brew... but there's just not a lot going on here. Still pretty tasty, but sadly flat in my glass. Like a soda that sat out too long. I bet you could use this beer in some interesting recipes."
"Man, everything I expected this beer to be!  The brew was beautiful with a deep brown colour and heavy brownish head.  The scent was of sweet caramel and a shade of coffee (hazelnut perhaps?).  A rich, nutty and caramel flavor swirls around in a velvety coat.  The only drawback is that its richness, nut flavors and nearly-heavy body make it one to savor in moderation and as an everyday thirst-quencher.  Regardless, another great brew form Rogue, they always do you right!"
"This beer poured out a nice very dark amber color with a tan head, that did subside with some lace.  Nice faint malt smell to it.  Slight hazelnut smell to it, some coffee aroma to it.  The flavor is what hits you.  Because of the hazelnut, you would have to put this not only as a brown ale, but a spice beer.  The hazelnut taste was very good and quite pronounced.  It was so heavy with that taste, you wonder if that adds to the body to it as well as the mouthfeel.  Good flavor, but the strong hazelnut and carmel aspects to this might throw some.  Worth checking out."
"This dark brown ale is very different that one expects from Rogue in a couple respects.  Rogue makes a lot of great brews, but generally they are hopped to high heaven.  This beer has a gentle bitterness and distinct caramel nut malty flavor which is introduced strongly by the aroma.   Nice medium body and sweet aftertaste.  Great desert beer for everyone."
"Yoohoo flavored beer! Pours a thick, greenish-brown head; deep reddish-brown color; chocolate flavored and thick, milky mouthfeel from the crystal and chocolate malts. Hazelnut flavor comes through at the end and is not artificial tasting. This must be one awesome beer on tap......someday I will get out to Portland to sample this from the source."
"Pours a nice brown with a tan head and a nice lace.  Sweet chocolate, slight hazelnut coffee, caramel malt, and some subtle hops dominate the nose.  Chocolate and caramel roasted malts are the first to hit the tongue.  Some nice slighty spicy hops are just enough to balance.  The finish has a great hazelnut character to it.  Very smooth and creamy and extremely drinkable.  Yet another great brew from Rogue.  They just can't seem to make any bad beers."
"This is an excellent beer. Rich coffeeish flavors with the nice hazelnut hints make it one of the best dessert beers I've ever had. This beer also has less hop presence than the typical Rogue brew, but I don't think a lot of hops would match the rest of the flavor in this beer."
"Smooth, dark amber, full bodied brew. Malty roasted nose. Sweet malts, particularly chocolate, comprise the backbone. Nutty with a good dose of bittering hops. Riding a fine line between a brown ale and a porter Rogue does it again with a quality beer."
"This stuff really is nectar. On draught it's even better with a more pronounced hazelnut character."
"WOW!!!  The deep-brown color with its smooth tan head make you want to drink this beer.  Then the hazelnut and chocolate aromas hit the nose and only the strong of heart can resist.  Tasting the beer is truly a religous experience, hazlenut, chocolate, coffee, brown ale...paradise.  The only negative is that the beer body is a little thin for the style.  Otherwise, find it and treat yourself to one of the very best.  Buy two, one to savour the other to quaff quickly as your senses will beg it."
"One of the best uses of ""flavor"" ever brewed. A staple of mine in college. Yeah, I went to school, what of it? But serious now, what a nice beer. I think I once drank four 22s. if i didn't, I wanted to. Er, should have. Harder to find down here in SoCal, but I found two places that sell it. Menaing I'm twice asa lucky as you. A surprisingly delicious brew that you and everyone you know will love. Go get it!"
