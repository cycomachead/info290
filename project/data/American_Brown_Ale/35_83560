Gorgeous dark caramel color with hints of red and brown. The smell and taste matched perfectly - a distinct odor of hazelnut, a distant taste of cedar or something woodsy, and a smooth mouthfeel making it go down faster than it should. Overall, it was more than outstanding. I'll have to go out and order a specific six pack of this stuff to enjoy during the holidays.","jjamadorphd","Nov 22, 2013"

Mouthfeel is good with medium thickness, moderate carbonation, and just a little stickiness in there. It's not as intricate or tasty as it could have been, but it's a solid addition to the mix pack.

Very subtle smell and flavor of the hazlenuts balanced well with the roasted malts. Tasted a lil chocolate as well though the coffee tastes as advertised eludes me. Hits all the right notes and I look forward to it getting a little more cooler so I can enjoy a few note of these.","Jekyll","Aug 01, 2013"

It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew.

It's a big mouthful of hazelnut that's out of balance with the rest of the beer. I found it hard to finish, as much I wanted to enjoy it. The aroma is nice - like a cup of hazelnut coffee. A decent try, no harm in trying it in the seasonal pack, but I'll keep turning to Rogue for my hazelnut fix.","TheRealBigC","Oct 14, 2012"

3.85,7.2,3.5,3.5,4,3,4.5,"Pours a clear reddish brown with a thin light tan head. Smell is mostly hazelnut, and maybe a little chocolate. Taste is initially very sweet, with some strong hazelnut flavor after that. Next is some toffee, and then some light espresso. The finish is slightly nutty and earthy. Mouthfeel is average. Overall a very interesting beer, I hope they keep it and have it again next year.","tronester","Oct 14, 2012"

The flavors of hazelnut and caramel malt hit the mouth right at the start. It's mildly sweet and very nutty. The nutty character from the hazelnut remains in the aftertaste.

The nose comprises roasted hazelnuts, light maple syrup, very light roasted malts, and a kiss of earthy hops. The taste lowers the hazelnut presence a bit, allowing some residual sweetness from the maple syrup and roasted malt flavors to come through. In the very deep recesses of the background, a vague sense of rubbing alcohol barely makes itself perceptible. Odd, but thankfully it's nothing but a passing notion, which is then overcome by a lasting expression of nuts. The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a more-than-fluid feel. Things are just too thinnish, too almost-watery, for my tastes. Overall, a decent little brown ale, but one that just comes off as an experiment into how much hazelnut they can make come through. As things progress in the glass, I feel like I wanna drink less and less of this...: it just gets kinda tiresome after a while, is all.","TMoney2591","0"
