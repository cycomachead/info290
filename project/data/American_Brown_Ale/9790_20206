I am going to be frank here and say that due to its overcarbonation, I was irritated and impatient, neither of which are conducive to a positive review.

The beer pours out a beautiful, clear ruddy brown with a nice cap of creamy tan head. It clings to the glass and leaves nice lacing. Aroma-wise this one is spot-on. Dark caramel and roasted nuts play off each other with just a little hint of earthy hops to round it out. Flavor-wise, this one is great. The hops take a more dominant role but the balance becomes much better and enjoyable. There's a little bit of fizz from the carbonation but it has a nice weight to it and is mostly smooth on the palate. An under-appreciated style, frequently butchered. This is just about perfect.","delta490","Jun 30, 2014"

The huge tan head lasts a long time, fading to a disc by the end, and leaves quite a bit of lacing. Scents of coffee and citrus were detected upon opening, but a bit on the weak side. Hops dominated the taste - a slight malty cocoa up front, which quickly changes to floral and grapefruit rind notes. Not overly bitter, but quite flavorful. The mouthfeel was noticeably lacking - really quite thin and watery. Enjoyed the taste, but this could be a much better beer with improved mouthfeel.","DeltaGolfSierra","Aug 01, 2011"

A slightly bitter taste with a mixture of sweet gourmet mocha coffee. Much more character and spunkiness than your typical brown ale and a bit heavier too. I must say that this is my favorite local brewery and 99% of the time they can do no wrong but also it is a bit high priced. You should not have to take out a loan to buy a six pack.

The flavor is much better, caramel and biscuity malts, with just a hint of roasted chocolate. Grapefruit from the amarillo is a wonderful touch on the back end, and a brief spicy flourish from the Saaz closes things out nicely. I had worries about the carbonation given the mountainous amount of head that foamed up from my pour, but it was surprisingly restrained. The body was just a little bit thin though.

Medium-bodied, the carbonation has it cresting early in the mouth but isn't disguising any flaws or such. Caramel, milk chocolate, carob, coffee bean, dry and dusty but deep.

It smells just the way I want a brown ale to, roasted malts and a little chocolate, not so much of the hops from the label ("hoppy and beautifully bitter"). The beer tastes much hoppier than it smells. The spicy hops (maybe saaz) are a nice counterpoint to the rich malts, very well done. I'd like more sweetness from the malts, but they present more with roasted bitterness. A nice lingering bitterness in the aftertaste, more from hops than malts I'd guess.

The smell is chalky NECCO chocolate and roasted malt. Adequately carbonated, the mouth feel is medium bodied. The taste is nice, but on the edge of being overly roasted.

3.95,6.8,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,4,"No secrets here, per the label "Hoppy and beautifully bitter". That may be a nice escape from the typical English style brown ale. Appears a deep chestnut mahogany brown hue with a light khaki head form fine bubbled even layers of lacing as it dwindles. Aroma has a big nutty chocolate tone with caramel and toffee blended in as well, but a strong air of herbal and earthy hops is provided as well. Flavor was raw with hop bitterness earthy herbal hops was right, those nutty dark chocolate tones are overshadowed by the wave of alpha hop bitterness giving the flavor a really dirty muddled flavor overall. Sharp acidity with a back end of sweetness finishes very dry in acidic, carbonation level is soft on the mouthfeel but body is medium with a slight level of oily hops. At this point just brew an IPA if you want to keep it a dark beer go black with your IPA, but compared to Terrapin and DFH's versions of a hoppy brown this one goes a bit overboard. Drinkability is kinda hurtin' due to the lack of cohesion of flavors, abrasive hops within a traditional brown doesn't work to well.","WVbeergeek","Jun 29, 2009"

It is in the flavor where the surprise comes - it is at once thin and mouth-filling, with a deep bitterness that develops slowly on the back of the tongue. The foretaste has chicory, wood, coffee, dark caramel, but then the flavor dies off quickly - at first I was disappointed, thinking the beer was weak and inadequate. But moments later, that rich, spicy bitterness comes up and spreads across the tongue. It tastes like the hop bitterness of a good IPA, but with a slightly harder edge and some of the burn of of an exotically spiced Middle Eastern or Indian dish.

There's also the slightest bit of a metallic smell which I'm not too fond of, fortunately it's not strong enough to overpower the other excellent aromas. Taste starts off with sweet caramelized almonds and and toasted malts. Midway is some earthy and piney hops with some cane sugar. Aftertaste is woody and a bit dry. Medium body with a creamy feel.

Brashly attacks the tongue with first sip with crisp backed green apples and strong raw biscuity spice mingled with a bitter sour feel. A long dark burnt malty feel stays long on the back of the tongue. The raw mineral laced bitter bite almost has a nutty feel.

Out of a bottle, the ale reeked of strong, dark malts. Upon tasting, the flavor, in terms of sheer strength and persistence, nearly knocked me out of my preverbial socks. The dark chocolate and nutmeg malts are ever-lingering and almost hard to notice anything over. The other characteristics of the beer I feel are masked by the absolutely intense malt flavor. Hopping is decent, but not marked when compared to malt flavor side by side. Carbonation is decent, but somewhat high for what I like to see in an ale of this type. Drinkability is slightly below par to me. I would not want to have more than one at any given sitting. Nothing stuck out to me about this beer past its over-pronounced maltiness and unrefined hoppiness. I would probably not purchase again.

What hits the nose first is a very fresh and raw hop aroma, courtesy of saaz dry-hopping. Underneath this is a backbone of malty aromas of brown sugar, chocolate, and a hint of maple. Flavor starts off with a sweet mix of nuts and caramel with a back note of roast malt. The hops kick in with some lemon rind and a very herbal/tea-like presence with some floral jasmine rounding it out. Finishes dry, bitter, and with a lingering hop presence in the mouth. I'm so used to coming across overly sweet brown ales made in the US, that this is one incredibly refreshing example. Mouthfeel is moderate, without any real residual sugar left on the tongue.

Pretty nice beer, but there are just a few things that take away from what it could be.

Big, bright, and juicy blood orange and grapefruit notes pop out all over the front of the palate with a slight mineral bite amongst the bready flavors in the middle, becoming earthier near the end.

There is an initial smoky note, light, but distinct that starts things off. A modest roast malt picks up and leads into the bitter, but complimentary hop bite. Equal parts roast malt and bittering hops, there is a pleasing long roast bitterness in the finish that lingers at the corners. Medium body with plenty of carbonation, it has a round feel to it.

Roasted malt aromas mixed with a metallic scent and a dash of campfire ashes. Flavor has an upfront bitterness to it, followed by a sweeter middle of caramel and chocolate.
