Palo Santo Marron comes across more like an imperial doppelbock than a traditional brown ale.  It wouldn’t be hyperbole to say this tastes very much like a barrel-aged Celebrator.

I've recently begun to step back back a bit from the big stout/porter beers that beat you about the head and neck regardless of how much I love them (see my review of Avery's Mephistopheles for where I stand)... Nevertheless, this brew is up there on my charts. Thick, big and black; it is a force to be reckoned with (keep your smartass racist/phallic interpretations to yourself). This is quite a departure from what I've come to expect from the guys at Dogfish, for sure. Definitely worth a try if you're thinking of a brute of a beer on a cold winter night.

I've never had a 12% beer taste so smooth. Hints of toffee, caramel and chocolate all imparted by the Palo Santo wood. It's such a dark beer you forget it's a brown ale and not a stout. A ton of respect for DFH -- it cost them $140,000 to make the vessel made from Palo Santo Wood. Yet, this is the ONLY beer that's made in that vessel and it's nowhere close to being their top selling beer.","Coffdaddy","Jan 30, 2015"

It basically took oak taste, and removed some of the aspects of that taste which I didn't like, thus making an even better wood taste. I love the dark, opaque appearance, something that most brown ales lack. The feel of this beer in my mouth was incredible as well. So smooth and creamy, with just the right amount of carbonation (almost). Definitely recommended. I will definitely be picking up more of this in the future.","mchegash","Jan 26, 2015"

4.64,11,4.5,4.25,4.75,4.5,5,"OVERALL:  I can’t believe I haven’t reviewed this beer earlier because it has always been one of my favorites from DFH.  It surprises and delights me every time I come across this treat.  Being unique is great, but to be this different, yet still so well put together is exceptional.  It is not every day that a year-round offering from any brewery deserves a 5 in any category, but Palo Santo most certainly does.  It is greater than the sum of its parts.","StoneTSR","Jan 14, 2015"

Not only was it super unique, it was very well crafted... what else should I expect from Dogfish Head? I'll be snagging a bottle of this next time I see it so I can try it again -- it is definitely something one-of-a-kind and special.","Alextricity","Jan 11, 2015"
4.03,-3.6,4.75,4.25,3.75,3.75,4.25,"As with many brews from Dogfish Head this is a very unique beer with a unique after tasted that is highly impacted, almost dominated, by the high alcohol content (12%). It has an array of flavors and the after taste comes across as almost tart, certainly more than most brown ales. From the look of the beer as you pour it you expect a very full mouth feel as the beer appears very dark and thick, but surprisingly it has a rather light to moderate mouth feel. I personally really like one bottle, but would not enjoy drinking multiples at one sitting.","lyonbg","Jan 11, 2015"

Smell is underwhelming, but I pick up fig, raisin, malty sweetness and alcohol.  Medium thick and creamy mouth feel with flavors that blend so well it's difficult to single out any one in particular.  It tastes like the Philharmonic orchestra sounds.  Definitely hides the 12% ABV well, but to me this seems like more of an imperial stout.  Someone likened this beer to Oskar Blues Ten Fidy, but this would be like the caramel raisin brother to the chocolate charred coffee that is the Ten Fidy.

The taste is also lots of dark fruit, vanilla, followed by dark chocolate and some coffee. The alcohol is pretty well masked up front, but really stands out in the back end, along with some nice oaky type flavors- very complex, but nicely balanced with no one flavor overpowering the others. The beer has a medium/thick mouthfeel, just enough to linger on the palate nicely. Overall, this is an excellently made beer- very complex, but nicely balanced.","timontheroad","Oct 19, 2014"

Oddly, and delightfully, the taste isn't boozy at all. Nice warm taste of sweet fruits like plum. Raisin and caramel too. Would have given it a 10 for taste if it was a little more carbonated, but I understand high abv beers have less. Nice warm mouth feel. Makes you smile when you sip it. Would be a great sit in front of the fireplace on a cold day kind of beer.","kkleu357","Sep 04, 2014"

The smell of the wood and the alcohol are easy to find and then come forward at the first sip. In the middle and end you get all the little nuances. The earthy tones, mostly nuttiness, from the brown ale compliments the overwhelming wood flavor. It's a filling beer that coats your mouth from the first sip.

I get a little of that style, but it is it's own beast. Honestly it tastes similar in many ways to Bourbon County Barleywine, but kind of comes across as a strong, dark Belgian and stout too. Very unique. Has a booziness to it, but not that would indicate 12%. Wouldn't have been able to tell you that till I was done. Smell is awesome. I get molasses, fruit/fig, brandy/wine, some other shit I can't even begin to describe so I'll go with ""complex mo fo"". Taste follows all that jive. Don't even know what the hell kind of wood Palo Santo is but I may have to build a bourbon cabinet out of it. A very unique and fantastic beer.

You get some awesome dark fruits, a ton of milk chocolate, some bourbon, vanilla, and toffee. You can see how the wood they used adds a great amount of soft sweetness. The flavors goes deep down into your taste buds. I am confused as to why this isn't rated a 100 on here, but it is definitely an easy 10 beers for me. WORLD CLASS BEER.

This beer hit you right in the mouth as soon as you open it. It has a hint of vanilla and almost a coffee stout aroma. The first sip is almost like a porter with a blast of hops. Its mild carbonation makes it very drinkable for a 12% beer. It has a unique aftertaste that is hard to describe other than that of a oatmeal porter with a hop mix. Overall a great beer that needs to be tried.","BeerSlut87","Jan 23, 2014"

Nose is dark fruit, super-malt, and boozy. The bottle indicates there should be some vanilla and caramel notes. I get the caramel, not picking up on the vanilla, but definitely some dank wood. Flavor is like liquefied raisin, and boy is this thick. So good, and the vanilla really comes through in the flavor (maybe as it's warming), as does the wood, giving it real winelike character. The mouthfeel as I said is thick, alcohol level is up there with a wine and gives a similarly tongue-numbing sensation, and low carbonation. Overall, completely badass. Now going to chase this with something a bit lighter. I honestly can't see drinking more than one of these at a sitting, two tops. Awesome, awesome beer.","BeerWizard","Dec 22, 2013"

The opal color and rich, brown lacy head make an excellent presentation. On the front end you experience strong wood flavors with notes of licorice and prunes, then you go through a warm alcohol mouth feel, finishing with a carmel-like, chocolate/coffee surge from what seems to be a good amount the darker crystal, chocolate and roasted malts. Hoppiness is moderate but some drinkers could confuse the complex malt profile for hop bitterness. Its an extremely well crafted sipper. If there is a down side, it would only be the burn from a 12% ABV and waiting for that to clear to experience the depth and complexity? Worth the wait.

Obviously DFH tweaks it in a major way by doubling (or more) the abv level from a traditional American Brown and introducing the palo santo wood, but it still has enough of the recognizable brown characteristics.","LambicPentameter","Jun 04, 2013"

I feel like this would almost be better off as a bomber or 750. Regardless, this is a smooth sweet beer with a moderately complex and very nice flavor profile.

The taste is very similar - kind of syrupy chocolate in this, pretty bitter but with a coffee molasses sweetness. Feels very this for a 12abv beer, amazingly well hidden in every way.

In fact, it forfeits most distinctive brown ale qualities, instead coming across as interchangeably Baltic porter/imperial Russian stout. It is not an especially delicious version of either due to cloying alcohol and acidity that diminishes its smoothness.","beagle75","Mar 16, 2013"

Pours almost pitch black color with a small foamy dark tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the small head. Aromas of big caramel, brown sugar, molasses, raisin, fig, toast, dark bread, roasted malt, light char, wood, light vanilla, and roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt and wood aging notes. Taste of big raisin, fig, molasses, brown sugar, caramel, toast, dark bread, wood, roasted malt, light char, light vanilla, and roasted earthiness. Lingering notes of dark fruits, molasses, brown sugar, toast, dark bread, wood, roasted malt, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice balance and complexity of very robust dark malt flavors with fruitiness; and hardly any cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and thick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent imperial brown ale. Very nice complexity and balance of flavors; and quite smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 03, 2013"

After tasting I don't think I'd call this a brown ale, imperial all the way in my opinion. Smells of vanilla, touch of booze. Taste is creamy and smooth. A little woody, definitely barrel aged. Delicious. Body is heavenly. Lightly carbonated but a heavy full mouthfeel. Booze is amazingly hidden for 12% ABV, noticeable still but well masked. Love this, recommend for sure.","Braz","Mar 01, 2013"

4.76,13.9,4.75,4.25,5,5,4.75,"Poured this American Brown Ale from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. This ale poured a midnight black color, produced a deep tan color head, great retention and left an outstanding amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma of this American Brown Ale was pleasing, full of dark roasted malt and chocolate malt. Full bodied, like most Dogfish offerings, this American Brown Ale was heavy on roasted malted grain. That super malty foundation set the tone for the rest of the session. Perfectly balanced, there are not alot of complex flavors in this brew- and that is just fine with me- its everything a craft American Brown Ale should be,...Heavy on the Malt, super smooth, full bodied...well balanced. There are some suggestions of caramel and vanilla but they are faint. I can't say that I can honestly detect the Palo Santo wood- either from the aroma or the taste- but I also wouldn't know the aroma or it's flavor if it were right in front of my face. In this case I will just chalk up the San Palo experience to this...This is a damn good American Brown Ale- If South American San Palo wood refines this beers character, then so be it- If it doesn't, it is at least a great story and exemplifies all that Dogfish Head Craft Brewing is about- Off centered Ales for off centered people!

In terms of American brown ale this is one of the best and has a bit of everything for the snob who appreciates complexity and a unique high abv brew.

The malt sweetness and the vanilla come very close to becoming cloying, but just in time the toasted grain, wood, a smooth booziness, and a few hints of dark dried fruit join in to add balance and complexity.

Fair retention throughout. Aroma is warm, with hazelnut, chestnut, and vanilla. A faint amount of caramel comes through. I would say the predominant flavors are nutty, vanilla like, some smoke and bitter chocolate and honey. Alcohol is present for sure especially on the finish. Full bodied to match the full flavor, but finishes well and is nicely attenuated. Again there is alcohol on the finish. Overall this is one of my favorite dogfish head beers, if not favorite. Its a great sipper and an interesting take on a brown ale.","pmlondrigan","Nov 01, 2012"

Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of roasted malt, caramel, vanilla, slight soy sauce, wood, and alcohol. Taste is much the same with an alcohol kick and a mild roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that has some nice flavors and aromas but it's quite strong and definitely something you have to take your time with.","UCLABrewN84","Oct 11, 2012"

Nose is super woody with notes of vanilla, figs, chocolate, heavy roasted malts, slight booze and something sticky like molasses and burnt brown sugar. The taste is soooo damn smooth. I haven't had a Palo Santo in a while but I don't remember them drinking like this. Amazing what 20 months will do. There are some fruity notes right up front like dates, figs and maybe some plum. There are heavy tones of wood, it has notes of burnt sugar, dark chocolate, raisins, booze, molasses, some dark cherries and vanilla all wrapped up with a sweet (but not too sweet) finish. The carbonation is really low, the mouthfeel is silky and surprisingly light for this beer. A couple of years took an already amazing beer and made it even better. Now I need to find another 4 pack and put them away for even longer. Great dessert.","DonDirkA","Oct 03, 2012"

This happened to be one of their only beers I didn't particularly like, so after drinking 3 bottles, I stashed the last one away until now. I remember specifically not liking the flavor the wood gave to the beer, but now it's fairly subdued. With four years on it, it resembles more of a barley wine or old ale than a brown ale. Unfortunately, I've never been a fan of dark fruit flavors in my beers, so it wasn't really for me, although I'm sure many others would really enjoy it.","Vicirus","Sep 22, 2012"

4.33,3.6,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a thick, obviously opaque, brown with very little head. The smell is that of Home Depot or a cedar tree. VERY woody. I like that, but I'll admit it's a bit excessive. But that's just the smell. The taste is fantastic. The wood is present in appropriate amounts to add some serious complexity to what is otherwise normal, boring unfiltered brown ale. The unfiltered brown backbone of this is not something I'm generally a fan of. I feel like the thick oiliness of the lack of filtering can actually hurt the flavour of a brown ale sometimes by making it too thick and masking flavours that can present themselves in a thinner concoction. However, this particular ale is fantastic. It takes that thick brown, malty ale with all the stuff a beer can have crammed into it and it adds a nice woody texture to make it a VERY interesting beer. Sadly, the unfiltered yeast covers up A LOT of the alcoholic bite that should be present in a 12% beer, but most people reading this will probably like that. It's still got enough bite to keep me interested, but it is VERY disguised. So, be prepared to be hit hard. The complexity here is not as amazing as a good quad or a Samichlaus, but it's not far off. I will continue to be enticed by anything aged in wood. Such beers have yet to disappoint me.","ElCommodoro","Jul 10, 2012"

Quite a bit of heat to this one that flows into some nice sweetness of vanilla, there's some woodiness, and some sugared breadiness. Not much activity, a nice fuller body.

Kudos to Dogfish Head for barrel-aging a beer other than a stout or a sour. You know it’s different as soon as you pour it. This is definitely a sipper due to the presence of alcohol throughout. I bought another bottle for my friend who loves brown ales and I have a feeling I’ll have to give him a heads-up before he cracks this one open. This seems like a nice introduction to barrel-aged beers for him.","BlackBelt5112203","May 16, 2012"

4.41,5.5,5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"12oz bottle, pours dark chestnut with an oily but creamy tan head that holds good retention given the massive ABV and leaves some chunky lacing on the glass. Aromas are oaky with vanilla, caramel, brown sugar, molasses, and a nose full of booze. Tastes are boozy up front and tremendously sweet with complex notes of burnt brown sugar, caramel, oak (Palo Santo wood, but it resembles oak), vanilla, and roasted malts. Mouth-feel is creamy, smooth, and boozy enough to leave a peppery prickle on the tongue. Overall, this has always been a favorite of mine. Always love going back to it every once in awhile. It is a sipper and can be cloyingly sweet at times, but still very enjoyable.","barnzy78","Mar 12, 2012"

I can't think of another beer with this ABV that goes down quite as smooth as this. It is a bit pricey, but I suppose that is the cost for such a unique, barrel aged brew. Bonus points for the groundbreaking vessels they made to age this brew. I don't give DFH as much credit as they deserve, but they continue to impress me with great beers. When I am looking for a delicious, smooth, sipping beer, it doesn't get much better than Palo Santo Marron. I highly recommend it.","NoLeafClover44","Mar 10, 2012"

Head is tan, stands 3/4in tall after a fairly aggressive pour. Retention isn't great, but that is to be expected. Smell is of sweet caramel malt, vanilla, roasted malts. Taste is relatively comples, from the malts I get a nice smooth sweetness. I also get some dark fruit, vanilla, woody flavors. I can taste just a hint of alcohol, but wouldn't have guessed that this was 12%. Body is thick, with subtle carbonation, this is an enjoyable beer, pretty drinkable considering how big it is.

Pours the darkest brown ever, with a huge 3 inch head, that slowly settles into a nice eighth of inch of thick foam, with very attractive minimal amount of lace. Smell is pungent vanilla, burnt brown sugar, prunes, molasses, and booze. Taste is not as powerful as smell. Huge vanilla, wood, and alcohol, are most dominant. Body is massive like no brown ale I have ever had, good amount of carbonation for large abv, not overly dry, and a slow sipper for sure. This is a beast, but very unique and really a special beer. Don't let the first sniff scare you off, because not nearly as scary as the first impression.","SawDog505","Jan 02, 2012"

Smell is not the most prominent feature of this ale but the taste is great. Nice and woody and malty flavor with sweetness like maple or honey smoothing the throat. Very nice mouthfeel. Very thick like eating a meal. Overall a great version of brown ale but don't try to session this. Two beers is like polishing off a bottle of wine on your own. Cheers!","jhtipton","Dec 18, 2011"

3.68,-12,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Overall: Very complex; its wine nose is followed by a very sharp biting first sip that manages to evolve to creamy when held on the palate. Fairly well done. While it is the most complex Dogfish Head beer I’ve tasted, the balance leaves a lot to be desired. The nose and taste are very alcohol-forward, and leave little room for the bitterness and softer cream, oak, and smoke that should be at the heart in this beer.","Autoeros","Oct 26, 2011"

It's a bit sweeter than I remember, I'm not sure if it was like that the first time I had it or if the two years of age brought it out a bit. Still, insanely drinkable for 12%, a bit of alcohol heat but if anything, it's the sweetness that would be the limiting factor for this beer.","nhindian","Oct 11, 2011"

It’s right up there with World Wide Stout and Raison D’extra as my favorite DFH beers. Plus, for some reason, this has given me more motivation to homebrew than I’ve ever had; I guess it’s just because I’ve seen the brewing process for this beer, and tasted how awesome the result was.

Very little tan/brown head developed, and what did appear dissipated back to a ring of bubbles very quickly. Smells of light woods (cedar, pine), alcohol, dark fruits, cane sugar, caramel, and faint vanilla. Tastes of the aforementioned woods, caramel, vanilla, sugar, date, plum, and a touch of grape. Not any kind of sour grape, just a faint red grape flavor. It’s balanced quite well, with only a subtle alcohol presence in the very end. Mouthfeel is great, with the carbonation cutting through the otherwise viscous fluid. I was surprised to notice the carbonation after watching such little head development in the beginning.

3.97,-5,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the stark woodiness. Not only did the nose explode with notes of a unique woody character, but the taste correspondingly lived up to the nose’s name. What we were presented with was an epic “brown ale” which looked, smelled, and tasted more the part of a fatty stout. This being said, this was a great beer, but it seemed a little out of proportion for the style. Again, this doesn’t really matter, except for classification’s sake, but this was quite a surprising beer, and a robust one at that.","TheBrewo","Aug 25, 2011"

The aroma is also kind of sweet smelling and rich with brown sugar I think. The taste of the beer is a big, it's got some of the biggest flavors I've ever had from a brown ale. There is the wood flavors, some dark fruits and a touch of coffee in there. The mouthfeel is nice and thick, decent carbonation and oily.

The wood aroma is somewhat balanced by caramel malts with little hop odors and a overpowering booziness. Taste is overwhelming boozy, not any balance at all. Pretty full mouthfeel with little effervescence, significant alcohol heat. I didn't like this at all and won't have any in the future. One of my least favorite beers I've had the entire year. Perhaps the issue is the Imperial Brown category, not a big fan of this, lacking in balance and nuance. Evidently I'm not an Off Center Person. Avoid.","jdense","Aug 11, 2011"

The aroma is fantastic with the aged wood really standing out along with hints of vanilla. The taste picks up right where the aroma leaves off with the warm malty flavor with a high alcohol kick.

This is much better, and progressing at an impressive rate. Right now it's hard for me to assess what the potential cap of this beer could be, and at 12% abv, it could be quite a while. The complexity of the Palo wood is going to take this to new and exciting places; I anticipate that mellowing the alcohol with the wood will take this to incredible heights.

I saw on the description that it was a Brown Ale but even though I've had some of the other DFH brews, the 12% ABV made me just grab 1 bottle. I was prsently surprised that it was syrupy, almost like a porter. Sorry I bought just one. Pricey at about $13 for a 4 pack. Will definitely pick up some more. Good long finish.

Raisins, dark fruits and earth notes. Hints of chocolate and burnt coffee. Flavor is a boozey mix of some coffee, raisins, and earthiness. Vanilla as well. The finish is a mix of alcohol along with the vanilla and caramel flavors that come from the wood barrels. The high ABV and the overall boozey flavor to this one hurt its drinkability but all things considered you can still drink it at a decent pace. This beer has similar flavors and qualities to it that some of the other high octane DFH beers have, like WWS, Olde School, etc. Overall, its a solid beer and a nice twist on the style.

4.22,1,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,"An aggressive pour yields only a half-finger creamy mocha head. The beer is a dark, opaque chestnut brown. Wonderful aroma, full of vanilla, hints of warming alcohol, sweet toffee and dark fruits--much like a stout but heavier on the dark fruit and a lighter roasted character. This sure comes as a shock to my IPA-laden palate--layers upon layers of malty goodness. Roasted/nutty malt is much more apparent in the taste with some chocolate as well. Lots of caramel/vanilla sweetness, the wood aging seems to be doing great things. Warm finish with the alcohol helping to dry it out. Aftertaste is highly reminiscent of a nice rum. Full-bodied, low carbonation, this is a unique beer that deserves to be slowly sipped and treated with respect.","MattyV","Jun 12, 2011"
4.3,2.9,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"I just tried this for the first time at new local hot spot “La Birreria at Eataly” on 6.11.11. Served in la birreria’s signature chemistry beaker-esque wine glass, this yields the darkest brown color, crosses into black, and sits under a light cap of tan foam. The nose carries a solid aroma of deep dark roasted sweet caramel malt, fresh brewed espresso, vanilla cream, and alcohol. Mouthfeel from start to finish is a crisp and complex malty one with well pronounced and pleasant notes of dark roasted cocoa, caramel and what I suspect to be the “holy tree” wood accent of the Palo Santo. This has Dogfish Head written all over it with its deceivingly hidden abv and friendly finish.

It is a big and bold Imperial Brown ale that can hang with some Imperial Stouts. Wonderful aromas of plums and raisins and black cherries. The sweet fruits smell delicious.The carbonation is low and the mouthfeel is medium thick.  Flavors of blackberry and burnt cherry are immediate along with dark fruits and chocolate and hints of expresso and malt. Dark and sweet fruits go back and forth and lay down the flavor profile. This brew is amazingly complex with a slight licorice and bitter black coffee finish.

Taste is similar, with now some caramel and some astringent oakey dryness. Other than this, the oak is not at all evident. A nice medium-full body with a fitting high carbonation, with some but not a ton of heat.

It was thick brown/black, like 10W30 oil, with a head that once you got it out was a cap. The smell was powerful good, something from a wonderful beer dream...forget the fizzy lager smell you associate with beer and take a giant whiff of this potent mamma. Roasted malt and alcohol were present, along with what seemed like dark fruits. The flavor was also roasty with a warming alcohol, and finished with a long lingering burnt sugar. Very thick in the mouth and down the gullet, not something you'd want to (or be able to) have a 6'er of anytime.

I had it on tap a few weeks later at Howie & Sons, and it tasted pretty much the same as it did in the bottle.

It reminds me more of a porter than a brown ale. It has heavy chocolate and fig overtones with a slight hop finish. I have never tasted anything like it. It is not too sweet and not all too dry. There is a strong alcohol presence but not in the least bit over powering (unlike the strong Bastard American ales, of which I am not a big fan). This is a great beer and one that is definitely worth a try.","beck2008","Apr 25, 2011"
3.95,-5.5,4,4,4,3.5,4,"It pours very dark and thick into the glass. The smell is a strong liquorice and leaves a mocha foam that dissipates quickly.

Interesting and well balanced.","jonB","Apr 25, 2011"
4.18,0,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall I thought this was a very good and unique brew, really different from your typical American Brown Ale, I never see one this strong. From my experience it seems like Dogfish Head has a thing for making unique and extreme Brown Ales, you usually don't see much creativity with this style. To me it seems like Shorts and Dogfish Head are leading the way in making unique browns, I like it. The taste of this beer was pretty good and complex, the Palo Santo wood imparted some nice flavors that I liked and I thought they worked very well with this beer. For being 12% this beer is dangerously drinkable, they did a great job at toning down the booze and making this seem much lighter then it really is. I would buy a four pack of this too keep in the fridge. If you like browns but want something bigger and unique, give this a try, you might be surprised. This was another great beer from Dogfish Head, you guys keep on impressing me.","StoutHunter","Apr 22, 2011"

I really want a few fresh bottles to compare with these that have some age on them because the alcohol seems to completely have mellowed out.

That said, I really do love it, and I'm tempted to buy some from time to time just to have it lying around. Still, it's a little too strong to really be enjoyed to the fullest (in my opinion) and I can't see how aging it even longer would change the flavor/make it better.

A beer that is overpowered and buttered with Palo Santo wood is one that attacks the palette. Not a fan of the hints of sweetness here either. Mouthfeel was average, but feeling over carbonated for this suite of flavors. Overall a disappointment for me. The 12 alcohol on top of all this just makes this whole brew seem like a marketing joke.

Flavour has more bitterness than I expected, though the wood seems to dominate the aftertaste. Nice thick mouthfeel.

3.97,-5,3.5,4,4.5,4,3,"A dark brown brew with a fair light brown cover and modest lacing. The aroma suggests a light citrus hop over malty licorice. Nice. The flavorm comes on with much the same in addition to some very definitive raisin. It's pretty intense with malt and an almost minty licorice idea with a vanilla alcohol edge. It's near full bodied, somewhat cloying in its intense combination of sweetness and tasteful bitterness. Carbonation is mild and drinkability is marginal due to the thick character and alcohol presence. There's a slight peaty, almost seaweed-like base in the malt side of this quality brew. A real tasty treat but not something for the sessioning.","Durge","Mar 08, 2011"

Smells like booze - the alcohol comes through in the smell as much as, if not more than, it does in the taste. Ultra malty beer with maybe a touch of caramel. The label mentions something about vanilla, but I think that gets quickly picked up by the more molasses-y tastes. Sweet leather, that might be a good way to describe it. Maybe not.

Aromas of bourbon and booziness are prevelant, smells like the inside of a barrel maybe? I don't know but the tastes like it was aged in a bourbon barrel and after the initial alcohol-y pow you get from it, there is a delicious barleywine with booze covered dried fruits. Definitely an alcohol driven beer at 12 percent. Thats true for most good barleywines of course though. Creamy mouthfeel backed by mild carbonation and an alcohol twinge.

Medium to full mouthfeel, slightly creamy and a nice amount carbonation.

Small rose color in the bottom of your glass when held to the light, small one finger tight off white head that laced for most of the beer. Smell is roast malt, wood, dark fruit, cofee, chocolate hint of vanilla and a lingering warming alcohol. Taste is fantastic complexity, warm bittersweet chocolate with a bite of wood from the san palo wood, coffee and roast malt mix with sharp hops that fade into more roast and a sweet big malt bill finish.

Thhe taste was along the lines of dark fruits, mellowed by the wood they were aged on. I didn't pick up many wood notes, but my palate might not br adjusted to those.

The slight warming sensation from thew alcohol folds in very nicely with the notes I'm getting from the herbs and spices from the hops (and possibly the wood). Palo Santo Marron is just as rich as I'd expect a 12%, all malt driven beer to be, which is extremely so. Carbonation is spot on, enough to cut through the heavy body, but still restrained enough to let the malt shine. Dogfish Head's beers are sometimes hit and miss for me, but fresh Palo Santo is in the running for my favorite of their beers.","axeman9182","Jan 07, 2011"

The aroma is raisin and plum with a fair bit of booze in a rich almost wine like way, not like the cheap vodka booze aroma you get from many high gravity beers. This blends well with the whole bouquet and compliments the notes of vanilla and aged rum. The flavor is nutty and a bit spicy, quite a good bit like the spices in anchor Christmas ale (woody, zesty, potpourri like in a way) As the glass progresses dark fruits show up with some nice roastiness and a good bit of heavily toasted French oak.

The taste is very, very woody. It tastes like it's a cedar aged American strong ale. It has good smokiness as well. It's very Beer Geek Bacon like in everything but body. It's definitely thicker. It's exceptional really. Two years have done this bottle well. It drinks so well. It is exceptionally smooth and has a good, full body to it.

""Dark"" comes to mind in both fruit and malt. Definitively sweet, but with a rich, mocha dessert-like taste that really compliments the complex woody qualities.

There is toasted malts, berries and alcohol present in the taste. The sweet malts are right up front hinting to you flavors of berries. Then the alcohol comes in and dominates, then ends with a nice toasted coffee finish. Has a smooth mouthfeel. Its a little thiner than i anticipated but not bad. Carbonation is just right, not too much not too little. I don't think i could drink more than two of these. Its a delicious beer but at 12% wow. This is a big beer. Its a sipper for sure.

The booziness is pretty noticeable in this beer though, which isn't necessarily always a bad thing to me...but I would like this one a bit more well-balance with the rest of the tasty flavors.

Loads of chocolate, some coffee notes, roastiness, and some dark fruits. Maybe a slight hint of smoke? Some vanilla and wood flavour lingers on the tongue, as the alcohol pops his head in to say what's up. Mouth is silky and smooth, full bodied with some moderate-low carbonation.

A nice smokiness to it with a good amount of hops that balance it out a bit. Not as thick as it first seems, but still has very little carbonation for a brown ale. Alcohol is well hidden.

Notes of coffee and dark chocolate come to mind. Alomost an iron taste to it as well, not sure where that is coming from. Woody and earthy too. The alocohol is surpisingly not that noticeable in the taste. This could be an IRS judging by the looks, so dark with a slight head.

4.2,0.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Poured from a 12oz brown bottle into a St. Bernardus goblet. Bottled on date of 12/28/09. Palo Santo Maroon appears a very dark brown color with some redness around the edges when held up to the light. The head appears less than a finger strong with a creamy dark brown color that retains quite well for such a high abv. Lacing appears and sticks in spots about the glass. Nose has a strong dark sugary aroma much like a mix of molasses and brown sugar. Some nutty date-like scents come into play as well along with some noticeable alcohol. As the beer warms, the nose indicates some previously hidden scents of caramel and vanilla. The taste of this brew has some bold malt character coming across much like the aroma indicated but not as sweet as the nose suggested. Flavors full of dark sugary notes riddled with alcohol and a contrasting bitterness of dark grain slightly chocolatey. The finish of this brew leaves a lingering taste of woodsy flavors much unlike the usual contribution of oak. It is peculiar with a flavor I never experienced before but very much enjoyable. For such as high abv brew this is a chewy full bodied brew but very smooth in the feel and quite drinkable considering. At times the alcohol comes across a bit astringent but understandable so. Wow I bet some age would make this taste even more wonderful.","stakem","Jul 04, 2010"

Smell is big wood and the major alcohol punches you in the nose. Surely smells like a big ass beer. Also tastes heavily of the wood. The alcohol warmth of this is crazy. Almost has a bourbon characteristic to it. A very unique tasting brew, unlike anything I've ever encountered. Feel is light and smooth for such a monster beverage, burning sensation on the way down, though it is a good burn. I have to rate the drinkability of this a bit low, due to the heavy booze content.

The hearty malty aroma is striking at the front, that blends to sugary fragrance and ending with a soft woodsy scent. The malt gives off a sugary taste, with a caramel sweetness; a touch of brown sugar is in there as well. A woodsy and earth flavor takes over halfway and finishing with a mild citric and earthy bitterness. A thin syrup feel is at the start then it thickens up and finishing an oily slickness towards the back. Wow, a unique take on a brown ale; the sugary and hearty malt flavors and aromas are almost like candy. The dark color is inviting, along with the sticky and slick feel make this a beer to savor.

Raisins, roasted coffee, caramel and vanilla. The alcohol comes across smooth not boozy for the 12% ABV. I am impressed to say the least.

Has a woody scent due to the barrels it's aged in. Lots of molasses and a touch of roasty expresso. Dash of chocolate is present. It has a nutty flavor w/ some vanilla tones. Very creamy!

3.7,-11.5,4,4,4,3,3,"Pours a very dark opaque brown, almost like a stout. Light carbonation and no head, though I did start pouring on the side. One sniff and you can tell that there are some crazy notes added by the palo santo. I smell brown sugar, maybe some gingerbread, caramel and also some earthy notes. Also get a whiff of alcohol. Taste is very complex. Lots of brown sugar/molasses with wonderful earthy tones and some toffee caramel notes. Really can't perceive much bitterness. You get the warmth of the alcohol in the finish as well as a very pleasant, slightly roasty and woody aftertaste. I would say this beer is somewhere between medium and full bodied with a fairly smooth mouthfeel, and quite sticky sweet finish. Definitely one to savor. Not my usual cup of tea, but a well made and intriguing beer.","zoso1967","Jan 18, 2010"

4,-4.3,4,4,4,4,4,"The pour into my pint glass revealed a very dark beer with tan head. As I took a whiff of the beer I noticed a port like smell which lead me to expect a very sweet wine like taste. The first taste that I took, I got the initial kick in the teeth that a 12% beer gives. But after the initial alcoholic burn gave way, I started to taste a depth of flavor...vanilla, woody, slight roasted-ness. It ain't yer average beer. Especially as the temperature of the beer warms do the flavors really start to come out and the initial burn of the 12% starts to mellow greatly. 3/4 thru the pint the flavor of this beer is really popping and there's such an earthiness to it which really masks the potency; hardly any semblence of a high octane beer here. It's a very full bodied beer with layers of flavor profiles. The mouthfeel is obviously on the full bodied side but isn't like syrup. This leads to the drinkability of this bad boy, despite it's high percentage of alcohol, this beer is very drinkable as it warms in temperature. The balanced complex flavors and undaunting mouthfeel make this beer worthy to frequent consumption however moderation should be taken into account. A good beer and a very nice surprise for a beer which on paper seems very eclectic.","PretzelsNBeer","Nov 01, 2009"

It's like if sam smith's took its imperial stout and aged it in wood barrels and made it twice as drinkable with a bit more flavor. This has wonderful coffee and caramel smells with vanilla and chocolate in the background and an ever present wood smell that makes it all come together. Taste is more of the same with a bit of burnt sugar and raisins added in. mouthfeel is a bit syrupy but extremely smooth with a slight carbonation and a pleasant bitterness on the tongue.

Smell is pretty crazy: a bit malty, dark fruits, some vanilla, spice, and a couple other things I can't label. All this is accompanied by an almost harsh woodyness. The beer does a good job on the wood flavors, with the sweet fruits on deck, followed by some lighter ideas of chocolate and malt. The beer has some bite too it, but not because of the alcohol, although it does have a warming effect that is enjoyable. The mouthfeel doesn't stray far from the style, maybe it's a bit heavier that other brown ales I've had, but that lines up neatly with the other characteristics of this beer. A nice brew to enjoy once in a while.

This is just a good beer. I am very impressed. I would love to sip this all night, but I fear the alcohol would sneak up on me.

Nose is strongly of vanilla, alcohol, and chewy malts. Reminds me of bourbon stouts, etc. There also seems to be something spicy/Belgian smelling in there. Heavy bodied feel with initially sweet taste, caramel comes out quite strongly. Second taste brings out the Brazilian wood. Wow. Nice complexity with a bit of single barrel bourbon coming through. Mouth feel is much more like an imperial stout than a brown ale, but I wouldn't expect anything else from Sam and the guys at Dogfish Head. Finishes much sweeter than I anticipated with a strong taste of wood, vanilla and nice, roasted nutty caramel goodness. Great beer.","cdpike","Jul 08, 2009"

The taste is a little maltier than the aroma, but there is still a large and pleasing perfume presence. There is a significant alcohol presence in both the taste and aftertaste. The finish is all wood, and perfume. Again, like the aroma this I can't find anything here to improve upon. The mouthfeel is full bodied with light carbonation fitting this style, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is a great beer. It is utterly and completely unique. Not only is it an extreme beer in that it is twice the strength as other brown ales, it is an extreme beer in that it is aged in Palo Santo wood.

Light can not shine threw and the head takes a little bit of work but can form nice. The aroma is very powerfull and full of scents. Firstly a roasty mollasses aroma with a hint of coffee and dark fruits hits your nose. In the background for some reason I get a smell of cherries, though in the background still strong. The taste it's self is very interesting for a brown ale. The brew has that ale taste to it with the dark fruits but the mollasses and others make this brew more of a stout imo. The consistancy is pretty thick also for a brown ale. The mouthfeel is very smooth and welcoming. 12% alcohol is strong and when you finish your first glass you should probably have only one more afterwards. This drink hits you hard after you finish me.

The taste is chocolatey malts and some hop bitterness, alcohol (not unpleasant), and coffee. This beer is delicious.

The taste of the alcohol isn't strong, but the presence and mouthfeel of it was there after each sip went down. It didn't detract from the beer at all since everything is very well-crafted here. I'm not sure when this would be good for, as I tend to drink Brown Ales in the fall, but this has to be the best one available in this part of the country. Worth a try if ya like your beers smoky, full-flavored, and solid top to bottom.","JerzDevl2000","May 09, 2009"

Very powerful scent of chocolate and some sort of sweet rum. Lots of complex flavor. Supposedly flavored with the palo santo wood. This was a definite sipper for sure but definitely worth the effort.

Taste is as full as a beer gets, strong woody taste, almost like chewing on wood chips, in as good a way as it can ever be, slightly bitter finish. Really complex, sweet to bitter taste. Feel it balance out and get so smooth from the wood againg and feel the alcohol come out of your nose and warm your mouth. Very nice. Feels so smooth and great, what a beer.

This was one of the ""woodiest"" beers I've ever had, the whole wood/oak flavor really comes through in the taste. Also notice the vanilla, caramel, burnt grain, and dry malt.

At 12ABV, the beer is in the drivers seat - not the poor fool who is sipping it. You have to give it a try. It's one of those beers that makes you re-evaluate what beers are and can be.

This is yet another great beer from the definition of American Breweries, Dogfish Head. The initial almost over barring flavor of burnt sweet wood hits the tip of your tongue.

It is an extremely dark brown/red. Almost no head at all, what did form was very thin and dark. Pours thick. Smell is pleasant,- I detect an undestated smokey malt scent, although not overwhleming. I expected more woody aromas, especially considering the hype around the wood tanks I read so much about. Taste, to this drinker, was very similar to a porter- earthy, malty, but you defnitely get some wood flavoring and a subtle spice on the tongue and throat. Mouthfeel was suprising- very complex- almost oily, with light spice, sort of coats the mouth and hangs around- the taste lingers a long while. Drinkability is not high, at least not for this beer guy. While this is a very well crafted beer, I found it very tough to drink more than 1 in a sitting. It's got a strong personality.

I still think they're a great company but over the years I kind of got sick of the 90min, the 120 and WWS and all their zany ingredients in general. I guess I was feeling anti-extreme, and I just wanted a well-crafter beer with 4 ingredients. A friend recently suggested this beer to me again and it's renewed my interest! Pours a thick-looking opaque brown with head of small bubbles. This beer has so much character. Initially sweet and malty with brown sugar and licorice notes. Not much bitterness to this beer at all, but it's rounded out by a very bold and robust woodsy-ness imparted from the Palo Santo barrels built specifically to make this beer. This is the main attraction here. Carmel, nutty, and almost a bit smoky. Lush and smooth on the palate. A really interesting beer that I tend to drink towards the end of the night. Quite relaxing.

Other scents I get include sweetness, almost like an orange, and vanilla. When I taste this, it's very reminiscent of a very strong sweet stout. The sweetness compliments the alcohol very well.

4.42,5.7,4,4.5,4.5,5,4,"Poured from the bottle into a snifter glass, beer is darker than I was expecting from a ""brown ale", looks more like a porter or stout. A very dark brown on the pour, appears black in the glass with a thin, effervescent head that quickly dissipates to a thin bubbly ring around the rim of the glass. Nice lacing as I gently let the beer slide around the snifter walls. The smell is very apparent and complex. Underlying sweet malt comprised of dark fruits, black licorice, star anise, bourbon, and roasted notes like bittersweet chocolate and lightly toasted coffee. The alcohol is there but not in an offensive fusel alcohol way. The flavor matches the smell and then adds a whole new layer of complexity. The dark fruit component is represented by dates, figs, raisins and anise. Once you get past the initial sweetness, there is a good bitterness balance but no hops are evident. The bourbon-esk flavor produced from the wood is apparent. The finale is a big hit of alcohol that really wakes you up and reminds you that you're drinking a 12% abv beer. The ethanol tends to linger as well as the dark malty flavors but in a much more subdued role than the alcohol. The mouthfeel is what you might expect from a beer this big - full bodied with a creamy, rich carbonation. There is a definite warming effect from the alcohol. Overall, a very drinkable beer from the aspect of being likable but definitely one you would want to sip and enjoy. Also, for nearly $16 for a four-pack you may be encouraged to drink it a little slower anyways!","gmfessen","Mar 14, 2009"

Aroma is sweet and roasty, with notes of bootshop (more on this below). Mouthfeel is something to write home about... thick and creamy. In wine tasting I've always heard the ""Leathery"" descriptor, but this beer is accurately described as ""leathery", and I mean that in the best way possible. The wood they age this in must be magical. Gives a tannic pinch to at the end of the swallow. Drinkabililty might not be high due to the alcohol, and how thick, rich, and complex this is.

Nose drips black, golden raisins, dates, rum cake, pan-seared molasses, very boozy, malted milk balls, sticks like glue to your nostril pores, some notes of sharper green apple, thick enough texturally that you enjoy it more just getting steamrolled than trying to pick this apart from that. Full-bodied, as in the nose you feel the warmth of the alcohol but no burn nor bite. All about roasted coffee beans, dark chocolate, molasses, rum, and French vanilla ice cream flavors. Green grape, fig, raisin, date, plum fruit alternate between freshness and dried fruit sweetness. Carbonation is sneaky strong, anything which can stir this brew has muscles.

The one point I would state against it is that there was a whiff of something solvent-like nailpolish remover that was a bit off-putting.

3.7,-11.5,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Big, sweet, medicinal, woody. I'm a little put off by the sweet medicinal flavor in this beer. That's my main thought, but I probably had too high of hopes for this one. Palo Santo Marron isn't a bad beer, but the unique woody flavor suffers from its sweetness for my palate. There is some dryness from the wood, but the mouthfeel is still fairly cloying for me. The flavor is complex, and there are some good notes in there. It's just all a bit too much. The alcohol is a bit forward for the sweet syrupy feel. I enjoy the beer, but at the price, I probably won't buy one again soon.","popery","Jan 21, 2009"

Woody and soaked in vanilla in a complimenting fashion, not overwhelming by any means. Caramel, chocolate, nice coffee presence that becomes more apparent as you drink. Sweet and lightly tart fruit, cherry being most apparent and possibly even raspberry. Very tasty, here. Surprisingly low level of heat for such a monster of a beer. Wide range of flavors and well balanced. Nothing is distracting or in your face. Woody character becomes a bit more apparent, imparting a slight dryness to the beer. Personally, I'm enjoying it. A moderate sweetness compliments with vanilla, caramel, and coffee most apparent. Fruit here still also. Damn, this is great. Mouthfeel is fairly creamy but again has a dryness to it thanks to the wood. A little tingle on the tongue after each sip. I easily finished a single 12 oz. serving. Might consider two. Intriguing beer, as are many that DFH tends to put out. Thankfully, this one works well. Might be time to pick up a 4-pack and set a few aside. Recommended.","ncvbc","Jan 20, 2009"

The taste is floral hops, heavy black fruit, caramel, vanilla, and an acrid woodiness, again hard to describe. The carbonation is quite low, and the finish carries on the heavy woody sweetness.

Strong alcohol presence and body has prominent flavors from the wood, light dark fruit flavors providing a little bitterness, some vanilla and light roasted malt. When you let it warm up and sit in the mouth a stronger nuttiness and almost spicy, hot peppery flavor starts to come through. Very nicely balanced, and alcohol is certainly present at 12% but not overwhelming. Comparing this to traditional brown ales is kind of pointless.

Strong at 12%, but pretty well-hidden and smooth. I think the Palo Santo wood aging has something to do with the smoothness of this brew. But as for woody flavors I'm not detecting a whole lot. There's some spiciness though. This beer is really an Imperial Brown Ale, which makes it pretty darn close to an imperial stout, though I guess not as roasty or bitter.

Leaves a nice lacing down the glass that dissipates over time. First smell, so many different notes that I have to take multiple sniffs. Aroma is of roasted coffee, vanilla beans, ginger, lots of wood, nuts. With a scent like this I can't wait to taste it. First sip... very malty, a bit sour, lots of brown ale taste and some toastiness of a porter in there as well. Sweet notes, and a lot of spicy ground pepper feel on the finish that leaves the mouth a bit tingly. This is a fantastic experience. Going in depth with the flavors... Lots of sweet ginger, toasted woody malt, roasted coffee, chocolate, some hop bitterness there as well as I get acquainted with this beer... Fruit notes- plum, raisin, other dark fruits that I can't quite put my finger on. There is so much to talk about, this is by far the most complex beer I've ever had. The kicker for me is the spicy finish along with the severe alcohol warming effect without any semblence of an alcohol bite whatsoever even at 13% ABV. This is a superb, perfectly made beer. I have yet to try one better and it will probably be some time until I will. This beer is as close to perfect as I've ever tasted. I can't gush enough about this beer.","Vendetta","Dec 14, 2008"

I'm just going to stop reviewing this strictly as a brown ale right now and base my rating of this mostly on my enjoyment of this brew. The aroma is complex, unique and wonderful. A deep, perfumey alcohol character is what I detect first but vanilla and an assortment of spices are very prominent. There is also a distinct caramel sweetness and a heavy dose of vinous fruits. There is also a very unique character that I assume must come from the time spent in the Palo Santo wood vessels. Taste is fairly sweet. Healthy doses of caramel and molasses that dominate throughout are complimented by a more moderate vinous character and relatively restrained spice flavors. Theres lots of booze in the taste too. It's not overwhelming but is noticeable and an important flavor component. Very full bodied, slightly syrupy, quite sweet. Carbonation is moderate and alcohol presence is strong and warming. Drinkability is a bit above average. I don't really know that I need a whole 12 oz.of this brew. That being said this beer was still incredibly complex and enjoyable.

Very complex on the palate as well living up to the aroma; caramel, vanilla and toffee sweetness first hit my tongue followed closely by the Palo Santo wood flavor, some alcohol heat and some hints of charcoal fading into coffee and bittersweet chocolate. Nicely balanced and impressive in new ways as it warmed up. For a beer as potent as this one was I was amazed how approachable it was.

4.33,3.6,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Looking for something along the lines of a slow drinkable I stumbled across this gem upon the advice of the storeowner of Wine Palace in West Bridgewater, MA. It's an unfiltered brown ale that the brewers at Dogfish Head age in handmade wooden brewing vessels. Right away you notice distinct caramel and vanilla. Dogfish Head says that's partly attributable to the exotic Paraguayan Palo Santo wood that the brewing vessels are made from. The beer is as dark as they come; there's no light getting through this one. It's not burnt or heavy in any way, but rather the highly roasty and malty brew is bursting with flavor and extremely drinkable. At 12% abv you absolutely ""smell"" the heat at your nose and sense the alcohol on your tongue, but it's not overpowering by any stretch. If you're not accustomed to extreme beers then this is not for you. However, if you have a penchant for big flavor and drinkability then the Palo Santo Marron should be on your list of must haves.","Acochran","Aug 30, 2008"

This was above a deep, dark -brown beer with ruby highlights and light penetration only at the edges of the glass. The nose had a very organic scent, like fresh-cut wood intermingled with bananas. Mouthfeel was medium with flavors of anise, chocolate, and caramel on the tongue. It may seem like this would be too sweet for a self-avowed hophead, but it was actually more bitter than sweet and with a subtle alcohol heat interwoven into the flavor. It was on the finish that I got the vanilla that the label mentioned, as well as a banana flavor.

Interesting that while some of the flavors are a little intense there is absolutely no alcohol noticed, which I got in the aroma. One of the easier drinking 12% brews I've ever had.

The smell very inviting. Onto the best part... This is a velvety, medium to full-bodied beer with a rich combination of complex flavors. Much like nose, the most dominant flavors in the taste spectrum include thick vanilla, banana, spices including nutmeg, pumpkin and/or cinnamon and hints of chocolate.

And what a flavor, the strong alcohol in the nose dissapears on the lips leaving a sweet vanilla begining, a delicious maltness, definate caramel presence and a soft enveloping earthy finish.

4.42,5.7,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"For being a brown ale, this one pours a deep dark black with a big three finger dark brown head. Nice layer of webbing left on the sides of the glass as this one falls. First whiff I get is maple syrup, chocolate, vanilla, and sweet caramel. Very complex, malty smelling brew. Taste begins nutty and sweet with big caramel and butterscotch notes. The wood emerges midway with a touch of booze and molasses as well. Vanilla and cane sugar round out the moist aftertaste, this is a damn fine tasting beer for sure. Full body with a thick and chewy feel. Carbonation is very subtle but fits in well with the beer. I have no idea how this beer is 12%, I could put this down just as easy as a normal brown ale and that's just scary. Dogfish beers have been pretty hit or miss with me, but this one is definitely a winner. Wow...","BeerTruth","Aug 09, 2008"

This guy pours dark and brown - real dark with little head retention and gives off a woody, kind of chocolate smell. The taste is a strong malt body with a slight nuttiness and heavy on the chocolate and malevolent fruit rounded off by the aged wood it was stored in, and has a full, thick mouthfeel. I didn't feel too loaded down after one of these but I would enjoy the adventure of making a session out of it.","smilingPolitely","Aug 06, 2008"

4.67,11.7,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"2008 vintage malt beverage aged on Palo Santo wood. This poured like an imperial stout, an opaque black with a bit of dark brown head. It smelled strongly of oak and mocha and licorice, with prominent alcohol. It tasted very strong and complex, like oaky cooking vanilla, barley malt, and mocha bitter-sweetness. It was quite thick with no carbonation, and had a lasting bittersweet aftertaste with alcohol warming. Overall this was totally unique with lots of elements that were well blended and balanced. Its wonderful flavor and body kept it from being too difficult to drink, despite how bold it was, and the complexity of the boldness was great to sip and contemplate.","Pencible","Aug 03, 2008"

The body is dark and does not allow light to get through. Aroma is very, very nice. Very penetrating. Rum soaked berries and rich malts and chocolate and barrel properties and figs and raisins. The flavor is pretty rich and decadent. Vanilla and caramel mingle with boozy rum notions, maple syrup and treacle. Almost like a jacked up milkshake. It's boozy, but it's 12%.

Roasty, cherries, vanilla, burnt caramel, figs, very apparent alcohol bite and extreme warmth in the chest. Lots of hoppiness in the finish as well. Very heavy bodied, inky, good carbonation, finishes pretty dry. Very enjoyable brew from DFH as would be expected. This one is definitely a sipper.

Flavors were very intense with slight port wine flavors mixed with bitter dark chocolate and a smoky aftertaste.

Reminds me more of an abbey or stout color. Nutty, licorie, and malt are all on the nose. The taste is much the same as the aroma. The difference comes from the slick oils that coat the mouth from probably the hops. A big brown ale, but the taste reminds me more of a stout.

Its got a coffee like flavor that shows up at the back of the mouth. There's a hidden almost prune like flavor hidden there among the hopless oaky flavors that deveolp mid glass. This is a very complex beer with many many layers of flavor dancing around the high octane base. I wasn't sure what to expect. I've never seen anything like this.

Wood really adds to the flavor. Silky smooth, almost creamy, chewy with a nice long finish that starts to show a bit of the 12% abv.

(IMO) *This* is the kind of beer I like to relax with shortly before bed. Heavy. Thick. Almost oily. Perhaps the second week of July in Ga. isn't the best time for this one; perhaps the second week of November would be better.

The some hops mix wth a little coffee and bananas with a big dollop of vanilla cream wit some very exotic woody undertones. The palate is a complex, yet silky smooth with a well integrated and balanced alcohol content.

Vanillas and caramels out front with good bitter roastiness and slight alcohol burn. This is like the Dogfish Indian Brown Ale gone to college. It lost some of that hoppiness and gained a whole lot more depth. Mouthfeel is great, silky smooth and full, none of the thinness that similarly alcoholic beers have.

I shared a sip with some Japanese friends who described it as tasting like boiled konbu, which is a thick, dark-green seaweed used for making soup bases and sauces. this is definitely a sipping beer that i think would be nice on a chilly night beside an open fire.","getalife2k5","Jun 01, 2008"

It's dry and roasted with hints of vanilla and a sweet crystal malt finish. The wood mellows the 12% abv. and adds another layer of compleity. The mouthfeel is perfect.

It's super strong and the 12% alcohol is definitely apparent. If I didn't know it was a nut brown ale of some sort I would think it was a sweetened imperial stout. Very dark. It's almost like the alcohol separates itself from the rest of the ingredients as it swishes around in my mouth. I'd better subtly sip this one or I'll be a goner in no time.

Even with the massive alcohol content, the head lingers and laces well, probably due to the addition of wheat. The aroma is quite potent with caramel and molasses like sweetness dominating rounded off by a bit of chocolate and mysterious spice. Sipping the beer, it rushes forth with a massive sweetness. Again flavors of chocolate, caramel, and brown sugar are present, but the wood has added its own spicy, earthy characteristic unlike any other wood aged beer I have had. Alcohol is present in the finish, but provides more of a warming sensation and does not bring down the drinkability. This may be due to the smoothness that Scotch Ale yeasts tend to impart. The beer displays a full body and smooth carbonation. Amazingly, this beer is easy to drink considering the 12% ABV. While this is massively sweet and malty, it is pleasant and balanced. Oftentimes, Dogfish Head will put out incredibly interesting beers that I feel compelled to try once and then never return to. This beer on the other hand is one I would certainly get again, and considering the alcohol, I just might do that and age it a few years.","MSchae1017","May 20, 2008"

There is a strong oak flavor and my only guess was a Oaked RIS but with a twist. I liked everything about it but would have never guess it wasn't a RIS.

Aromas are signature DFH, sweet, sticky candy and fusel alcohols! Digging deeper, I can get some slightly roasty malts, chocolate, vanilla, and yes, some oak; but it's not overdone. It's a very fresh cut wood smell like you would get in a carpentry shop, really nice. On the palate, this beer just blooms. Flavors are much more brown like. There's just a touch of roasted malt, not unlike most American Browns, some caramel, fruity esters with a slightly watery finish. Despite the ABV, this beer is quite drinkable. DFH often struggles with these high gravity beers, but this one truly shines. The finish is more roasted bitterness and just shy of being dry. Carbonation is low and mouthfeel is quite heavy. It is really an extreme beer and I can't wait to see what DFH has in store next. I would like to see some more oak character, I felt it was rather lacking for a beer that stakes its name on it.","dreadnatty08","Apr 01, 2008"

3.58,-14.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Another of the unusual formulations to come out of Dogfish Head, Palo Santo Marron poured out closest in looks to a Porter. The body was dark brown coming out of the bottle, but in the glass, it looked pretty black. The head was quite large and settled down to a three plus finger layer of craggy foam. The smell was quite nondescript for a beer with such a complex origin. All I could smell was a little toffee, chocolate, and chicory. The taste was much more typical of wood barrel aged beers than the smell. I got a dash of vanilla, some sweet gummy flavors, a little chocolate, and a sour finish. I was somewhat disappointed that the alcohol was not hidden at all. I think this has some rough edges still which beg to be smoothed out by more aging. The mouthfeel was creamy and oily and the body was a little thicker than I was anticipating. Not a bad foray into wood aged beers, but more time is needed to mellow this baby out.","rajendra82","Mar 30, 2008"

Some chocolate and roasted malts coming through, and they come much more to the forefront on the taste. I didn't really get any sense of the woody taste, not really sure what to look for. Enough hops in here to balance out the sweetness. It tasted good, but not really very unique. Mouthfeel was medium, not quite full enough for the beer at hand. Drinkability is good, but not great. Maybe i am just missing this one completely, i don't really get what everybody sees in this one, and I love dogfish head.

Even swirling brings only a bit of it back. Aromas are most heavily of sugar and wafts of auslese like alcohol that I have come to associate with big DFH beers. Drinks very smoothly, with no evident carbonation. Smokey tastes coming from this one, along with burnt carmel. Some coffee notes as well. Remeinds me more of a stout than anything else - Great Divide Oak Aged Yeti comes to mind. However, this is sweeter - not at all cloying though. Bitterness provides a balance, but that is all. Alcohol remains in the background. Another tastey over the top beer form DFH.

The nose is very sweet with alcohol creeping through. Some fruity notes also appear. I had this in the fridge for a couple of days, but the aroma really started to shine when it warmed up a bit. Very roasty and chocolatey on the first taste, with a nice warming feeling due to the high alcohol content. The brew has a fruity after taste that sticks around, but is quite pleasant. For being so incredibly dark of a beer, it wasn't as heavy as I was anticipating.

Odor is of strong fermented molasses along with raisins dates a little bit of smokey wood. Taste, at first, is a combo between a wee heavy and a sweet stout, with sugary, almost watery peat flavors. smokiness and vanilla comes through next, drying out the mouth. A definite alcohol presence, but tempered somewhat by the smokey flavor. Comes out overall more like a porter than a brown ale, imo, but it also sort of isnt trying to be any one style, i dont think. Wood gets a bit tannin-y and bitter towards the end, but not too badly. Medium bodied, surprizingly so. The first of these big dogfish head beers i've had that wasn't cloying and syrupy and all together hard to drink. Actually its hard to pick out all that alcohol in here. quite a nice drinking beer.

Nice to see the decision that I yearned for, that is to turn it into a production beer. Looks deep dark mahogany with barely any ruby highlights when held toward the light large mocha tan head forms thick and takes it's time dying down even with double digit abv that's good retention not too mention the lacing that forms in even thick patches with each sip. Aromatics are full of raisin tartness with a sharp sweet brandy note about it, complex as all hell with a lively herbal incense like quality sweet brown sugar caramelized and drizzled over it all. Maybe just a touch of anise or some other herbal quality arising from the hop profile. Flavors blend so well with smoky, earthy, and woody tones all playing off one another. Mild medicinal alcohol presence but sweet dark roasted malts and caramelized sugars dominate the flavor base, deep fruit accents round it all out with more exotic spiciness kicking. Completely original nothing else to compare this brew to an experience every craftbeer drinker should try to obtain. Body is full with sticky residual sugars given it a light syrup texture even slow churned carbonation bubbles arising, really finishes with a smoky cigar box like note. Drinkability is excellent your 	12 oz portion will be gone before you realize it, yes I know 12% it's hard to tell really blended well and aged to perfection here. I can't wait to try more brews aged in the new wooden tanks. This beer really helps regain Dogfish Head some of the credibility that it had for so long.

You can taste the alcohol in this beer, but it is balanced with the malts and the smokey aftertaste. I get a nice warming sensation as I drink it. It also gets easier to drink as it warms.

The wood aromas leap out of the glass. Initial taste impressions are suggestions of caramel. licorice, a hint of chocolate and dates. And big roastiness at the core. But the overall impression is more of an ""imperial brown ale," with those great, and yet not overpowering, wood flavors. The alcohol makes itself noticed in a lingering dryness at the end.

Our homebrew club recently brewed an Imperial Brown and aged it in a Four Roses Bourbon Barrel for the '08 NHC. Interesting to compare the differences. This beer surely qualifies for a Double Brown without loosing any balance, falling into Porter or Stout territory. A nice chocolaty, nutty flavor with a hearty helping of malt, sweetness, and berry-like esters. Good hopping rates give the beer a grassy, piney flavor while offsetting the heavy sweetness. The wood gives a well-roundness to the flavors, but don't give a whole lot of wood flavor or astringency. Quite delicate in it's balance, despite a dominant alcohol (ethanol)taste and slightly harsh textures, but does thin the weighted brew a bit.

The initial taste was of sweet caramel malt, thick and viscous, transitioning into a very full-bodied toasted malt and alcohol finish - very ""stout-ish"". Very smooth and balanced for a 12% ABV brew - possibly the smoothest high alcohol beer I've ever had.
