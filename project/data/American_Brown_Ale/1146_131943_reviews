"This was a good beer overall. I'm not totally sure about the metallic taste, but otherwise this is a decent brew that I would be willing to drink again."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 10/22/2014. Pours hazy deep reddish brown color with a 2 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of caramel, brown sugar, toast, toffee, plum, fig, pear, apple, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of dark/bready malt, earthy hop, and fruity yeast notes; with decent strength. Taste of caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, brown bread, cocoa, plum, fig, apple, herbal, grass, light pine, light nuttiness, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Light earthy herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, brown bread, cocoa, plum, fig, apple, light nuttiness, and herbal/toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice robustness and complexity and dark/bready malt, earthy hop, and light-moderate fruity yeast flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, fairly creamy/bready, and slightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good brown ale. All around nice complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt, earthy hop, and light-moderate fruity yeast flavors; and very smooth to drink for the ABV. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"Bottled on 10/14/2014: Pours chestnut brown color and almost looks like watery caramel with a huge looking foamy 2 finger tan head that faded slowly and left good spotty lacing going down the sides. Smells of caramel, toasted grains, brown sugar, wet wheat bread, metallic yeast funk, light piney hops, dry crackers and what I perceive as allspice; the spicy notes at the end give it the “festive” holiday aroma. No nuts in the nose, but all the malt of a brown ale. Taste is very similar but it has more hops which seem floral to go along with the pine cone taste, and it has additional spices like cumin and cinnamon which make the flavor way more winter seasonal. The toasted grains and malts are strong and work well with the hops and spices, but I’m not a huge winter warmer type so I was hoping for more brown ale basics but should have expected the spice rack in the mix. Mouthfeel is light and almost watery, with a lighter body, and a sweet malty finish that leaves a mix of spices like potpourri. Decent holiday beer, more winter warmer than brown ale IMO, but still decent overall yet not my cup of tea or favorite style (winter warmer aspect)."

"Another nice brew for the holiday season."
"Overall: Pretty good beer for a cold night."

"Very surprised by this one. I usually don't care for much from them (except BCBS :P ) but this was pretty damn good."

"DATE TASTED: December 28, 2014... GLASSWARE: Barley Creek pint... OCCASION: the end of another losing football season in Believeland... APPEARANCE: a dark brown, opaque body that anchors a creamy tan head; tracings are significant and spacious... AROMA: aromatic berry and earthy malts combine to entice, with some scotch-like peat; suggests a hearty ale... PALATE: earthy, big presence with a creamy, frothy, warming impact; finish is a bit dry and lengthy--alcohol trail is a bit of  a turn-off...TASTE: big and malty, with enough tickling in the teeth to suggest hops; fruits range from strawberry and cherry to apple and pear; at heart, a brown's earthiness... OVERALL: at home as a winter warmer, the fruits candy the ale into something of a middling experience, but one that uplifts the usual brown ale and its often-predictable genre..."

"Not a bad festive brown ale, though not one I would reach out for a sixer of. Had on draft in a Downtown loop bar and grill. No discernible spices here, though this does hint at having some orange peel in there and candied fruits. Decent enough but I would pick out many other seasonal winter warmers or brown ales over this."
"The scent is reminiscent of a nice Madeira, or possibly a port; some sort of dessert wine, the taste though, not so delicious"

"poured from bottle to wine glass. can smell banana mixed in with the malt. really  good seasonal"
"Feel: medium body and carbonation."

"Caramel, and dark fruits. Overall a nice creamy and toasty brown ale ."
"I wouldn't necessarily buy this again, but it was tasty for what it was."

"Creamy and malty with slightly bitter finish"

"Clearish ruby with a very creamy, yellowed head that leaves sheets of lacing behind.  Aromas of mellow spices, raisins, toffee, and floral hops.  Flavor is bolder, but well-rounded and balanced.  Nutty caramel malts, earthy hops, dates, tobacco, and a hint of cinnamon.  Creamy, plush mouthfeel that dries out a bit.  Pretty damn solid all around."

"O:  This is a very tasty beer.  It may be a bit closer to a Belgian dark than an American Brown though.  Great flavors and a solid complexity without any apparent faults.  A very enjoyable drink from Goose Island and it certainly isn't Christmas Ale under another name."
""
"Not quite as full-bodied and malty as last year's offering but delicious nonetheless."
"This wonderful Ale is sweet and fruity. I generally like the Hoppy IPA's so this is definitely not my usual fare. But ....I love this ale. The aroma is reminiscent of a cordial, warm and welcoming. The substantial alcohol offsets the sweetness beautifully. On tap this is a winter gem."
"Overall: Has a sweet caramel malt taste.  This beer is very smooth with a semi-thick body. A very solid take on a brown ale.  Definitely a Winter Ale everyone should try."

"Overall: A pretty solid take on a Brown Ale. Good toasty malt notes with some really nice dark fruit undertones"

"Other than a cut of alcohol, when cold and a bit too much bitterness I found this to be very well done."
""

"Kind of an odd one here, not really falling in love but not dismissing this guy altogether either."
"O: A solid holiday-time brown ale with plenty of maltiness. It is able to keep the sweetness down to a point, but it could definitely get a little cloying after a couple. Might be better in a 4-pack, but that's just my opinion. Worth a shot if you're into browns"

"Didn't like at all! Not a fan o fruit in beer should have read the label better."

"This beer is slightly spiced and thin.  The head is 2 fingers and lasts.  The color is an amber brown that is transparent.  The taste is good.  Spicy brown with nutmeg and some clove.  Feel is watery."

"Worked as part of a chicken marinade as pretty much any brown ale does"

"O: Decent, but underwhelming for a brown ale. The taste profile seems too reliant on a hoppy sort of spice for my personal preference."

"Pours a four-finger light tan head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Murky opaque brown color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Light nutty nose and flavor is burnt malt and bitter earthiness, no caramel or dark fruit as brewer suggests. Lingering bitter aftertaste. Bottled 10/14/2014, $1.99 for a 12oz bottle from Bert's Better Beers Hooksett, NH."

"This offering is a basic brown with a touch of chocolate.  It is a bit astringent on the finish with an alcohol dryness that seems unnecessary for a beer that only clocks in at 7.7%"

"Chestnut brown body with a thin khaki head. Bready aroma with a hint of vanilla. Dark toast flavor, mild sweetness, present alcohol. Medium bodied with lingering fruity esters. Average."
""
"Aroma is nutty, toasted, and fruity. There's a bit if soft cherry reminiscent of cough syrup, and perhaps a touch of citrus. Flavor reveals underpinnings of that fruity malt character, with a toasted, nutty, harshly bitter and woody finish. There's a bit of pine that emerges late. That fruity character just clashes with the bitterness, reminding me of medicine, and the nuttiness is borderline burnt."

"For a brown ale this was to bitter for my liking.  The spice in it was good though.  Interesting but I probably won't ever choose to drink it again."

"Has a fruit cake and dark dried fruit nose. Pours bright brown under a 1” light tan foam cap that is fairly persistent and lacy. The palate starts creamy and chocolaty supported by dry grain flavors then mild fruit cake and dark dried fruit flavors emerge then drying slightly by the finish with a does of herbal astringency moderated by a touch of residual sweetness. Mid-palate offers a smidgen of vanilla, light caramel, and a hint of anise or cardamom.  Very fine soft carbonation and a body slightly above medium."

"12 oz bottle.  Pours hazy brown with fluffy, off-white head and nice lacing.  Aroma is of caramel malt, coffee, cherries and herbal hops.  Body is medium and tangy.  Caramel malt, herbal hops, ripe cherries and spices fill the mouth.  Finish is long and dry.  Very nice winter brew."
"Easy drinking and subtle spices make this a good winter ale."

"Goose Island Festivity Ale -----3.5/5"
""
"The taste has a dark cocoa and slight fruity taste with mild raisin and currant accent with slight earthy taste verging on woody with mild caramel smoothness and toasted malt in the middle with slight spice from the hops to balance with gentle alcohol as it finishes more dry than sweet. The taste is decent for a strong brown with a hint of yeast in the taste to add complexity and balanced well with semi-toasty and fruity elements which fit the style well -I could drink this frequently-very enjoyable American Style brown ale"

"Well, gotta wait for the bus to get here, so let's stop off at WB and grab a pint or two, eh?  This one pours a murky ruby-sienna topped by a finger of glowing off-white foam.  The nose comprises maple syrup backed by mild pine resin and mixed greens.  The taste turns the tables, leading with the pine-led greens and backing up with the maple syrup.  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish.  Overall, this isn't a bad brown, really, but I, for one, feel the overt hoppiness hurts things in general.  I won't have another of these, as far as I can see, but I also won't dissuade someone from having one, either."
""
"Overall: Really tasty and unique. Loads of brown sugar and spiced apples."

"This is a solid brown ale. They seem to really stay true to style, but just amped up the ABV. It's not a mindblower, but it's cool."

"Overall-  Coming from Cleveland Ohio we have the legendary Great Lakes Christmas Ale.. Which is amazing dont get me wrong but its alittle on the expensive side.. This holiday brown ales stands at a stout 7.7% abv with 50 IBUS and is less than 10 bucks a six pack WHAATT.. now the 50 IBUS is puzzling to me because I  dont find it that bitter others may but that is why there are 100000000000 beers in the world right? take caution when drinking and driving especially this one it will sneak up on you..  I hope you liked my review.. we need this beer in the 90's.. GOOSE ISLAND MAKE THIS YOUR STAPLE WINTER ALE"

"Pours a hazy reddish-mahogany in color with a thin beige head. Some ring-like lacing is seen after each sip. The aroma is of roasted malts and spice. Bit more going on with the taste as there is hints of dark fruits, oak chips, nuts and even vanilla. Pretty smooth and creamy. No bitter or harsh aftertaste. This brew is for the cooler months as you can tell by the higher alcohol content. Overall a tasty brew."

"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Mason Jar shows a wonderful reddish brown color with a small light tan head, the aroma is slightly hoppy with some roasted notes and sweetness. The taste is spicy with malt and hops present as well as a bitterness that works all the way through the process of sample, mouthfeel is light to slight medium with everything working very well. With the cold weather and Holidays coming this would be a great beer to have around to share with Family and Friends...if they like a solid beer. I like Goose Island products and this is a winner!"
