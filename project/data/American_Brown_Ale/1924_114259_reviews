"Great brown ale. Du Claw puts out some very delicious brews. Rich flavor with a sweet aroma."

"O: [3.75] I really like this beer.  It is just a mass of different candy flavors.  Maybe this isn't for everyone - but I really like it.  At 5.8% I didn't expect a massive body so I wasn't surprised it was a little thin."
"O: A nice after-dinner beer, almost dessert quality. It still has a connection to its brown ale base, but the coconut and cocoa flavors take it in a new, enjoyable direction."
""
""
"Overall: I really like this beer. It's a thin bodied beer...a bit watered down...but it has a great flavor and aroma. I would recommend it especially if you're a fan of coconut, and the chocolate adds a nice finishing touch."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The flavors of coconut, vanilla, and chocolate overwhelm the flavors of the base beer which is unfortunate - I wish they were more complementary rather than dominating. Additionally, the coconut flavor is slightly artificial. Not sure I would grab this one again."
""
""
""
"Lots of coconut, chcocolate, caramel and vanilla!"
""
""
""
"F- high carbonation is nice, especially given the heavy flavors."
""
"Overall:  A very interesting and quite good beer.  I like the earthy aromas and flavors.  I’d certainly get it again."
"Only my second  Duclaw beer I have tried.Pours a russet brown with a creamy textured light beige head atop that leaves an almost full ring of lace as it settles into a frothy mass.Toasted coconut stands out in the nose along with mild milk chocolate.Although not a fan of coconut it's pleasant on the palate and goes well with the chocolate notes.Again not a fan of coconut so much but this is a pretty darn good beer."
"Very tasty beer! Seems like there is a coffee taste as well to me."

"Look is quite lackluster in the glass with minimal head and body color that is kinda brown/purplish.  Has a very nice vanilla and slight coconut sweet smell.  Taste is that of a very typical brown ale though.  Nothing really noteworthy here and a quite bitter finish as well along with some burnt roasty notes.  Body and mouthfeel is quite thin.  Overall, this is just a very pedestrian brown ale and not the most enjoyable.  Good but nothing really making me want to revisit."
""
""
"As I am not a fan of coconut, please take this review with a grain of salt. Feel like I am drinking Tropicana suntan lotion and would prefer not to..."
"Well it certainly is an interesting little freak.  You pick up some coconut in the smell along with what seems like chocolate.  The vanilla is faint.  The flavor is interesting, reminds me of the old sno ball cake by hostess, which I was not a fan of.  There is also an off taste on the finish that does not seem like a bitter.  Overall, interesting, but not very good."

"a beer that taste like an almond joy  wow  its a hit a spot  a diffrent spot then the other beers you drink but if you enjoy brown ales you will like it  a diffrent taste with each sip"
""
"Overall: Really interesting right up front. Great coconut, toasted coconut, and caramel/fudge flavors. Balanced and drinkable. Additionally, I think this would make a great dessert beer, and it would probably make for some great, unusual and unexpected food pairings. For straight-forward drinkability, however, the coconut ultimately becomes the main component, overshadowing the base malts, and it's not really compelling enough to want a second within any given session."

"O-this was the last one in my six pack and it was a good try....worth purchasing more than one of."

"Poured into tumbler. Medium brown color like a darker iced tea. Smell is toasty malt with caramel, sugar and coconut. Taste is light mouthfeel but not watery. He first sip was good but got to be sickening. I drank the first but left the rest alone for months before dumping them."

"O:  An alright beer, overall, but a bit watery and fake tasting without much going on.  I like chocolate and coconut, but this just tastes like a mediocre beer with a shot or two of coconut syrup."

"Enjoyably flavored beer, but perhaps a bit strong (flavor, not ABV or feel) for some."
""
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle. Has a cola color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of chocolate, some coconut. Taste is like a mounds bar, yummy and tasty. Some alcohol is present. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a unique beer worth seeking out."

"mouthfeel is good and overall a good beer."

"by far the best thing ive ever had from them. really really well executed."
""
""
"Love the combination of coconut, chocolate, and caramel.  This one is like drinking a beer version of Almond Joy.  I could have several of these."
""

"On draft at DuClaw in Bowie, MD. The beer is chestnut brown with some russet highlights and a half inch of soapy, tan head. Aromas of brown bread, coconut, chocolate, chewy caramel candies, brown sugar, toffee. Coconut and toffee are the dominant flavors, followed by notes of chocolate, malt, caramel. A dessert type beer, though not overly sweet. Bready and medium bodied. A fun and interesting beer."

""
"Overall – A decent brown ale overall, but the feel and bitterness at the end of the taste actually took away from what I was expecting in this one. Just alight."

"O: Overall a sweetly caramelized malting similar to a scotch ale, a sweet brown ale that may be a bit much in multiples but is interesting for a take."
""
""
""
""
"I'm usually a pretty big fan of the bottled Duclaw beers, but this one misses the mark for me."
""
"Overall, this is another interesting beer from DuClaw. Brewed with roasted malt, chocolate, coconut and caramel, how they worked together was pretty impressive. This is another winner from this brewer from Baltimore,MD and definitely a good craft gateway beer."

"Overall this is a winner what a great experimental brew. I had my doubts with this since most beers they make are rather lackluster but this may be the best beer I had from them to date. I have never experienced such robust coconut flavor in a beer so if thats your thing BUY THIS NOW!"

" The taste has a good amount of freshly roasted coconut with a supporting taste of cocoa/caramel and malt with a more toasted but not bready flavor. Overall this is a nice brown if you enjoy coconut. The flavor is pretty much dominated by the adjuncts which is fine if that is how you roll - I would prefer those flavors simply compliment the base beer instead of overwhelming it -I won't order this again."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This beer is the sum of its parts. A lot of average to above average parts make it a pretty good beer. A bit gimmicky, but enjoyable and tasty. A 12oz glass is enough, though a pint may also be enjoyable as I'm sure this beer is different as it warms."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This brewery is definitely hit or miss with me, and this one was a hit. loved the chocolate stout feel and loved the little bit of coconut that came through with all of the chocolate. A pretty good offering, you should check it out....drink between 45-50 degrees. don't drink too cold or it will mute a lot of the flavor."

"Easy drinking and pretty damn close to a Girl Scout cookie."
"O: Decent. I suspect this will become somewhat popular due to the name, advertising and marketing behind it, just like with Sweet Baby Jesus. I'm steadily going through their stuff so that I can give them a fair shot, me living/being from MD and all."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Sweet Baby Jesus fans will love this and should buy/trade for this immediately. To me, it's a bit too chemical-tasting to be a great beer...but dat aroma! Oh, dat aroma. All in all, it isn't bad at all - certainly not a stinker like Old Flame or Serum was."

"D - A unique marriage of beer and desert... The aroma is dynamite, but the overall flavor profile struggles a tiny bit... This one gets an ""A" for effort, but a ""C+"" for execution... Another funky offering from DuClaw, a brewery who's experimentation really impresses me time and time again... However, the experimentation doesn't always work... Recommended for the curious and those who want to see what the outer boundaries of beer look like... However, not sure this is something I will seek out again on my own..."
