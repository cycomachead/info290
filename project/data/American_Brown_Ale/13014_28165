It's rare, regardless, to try a brown that coheres to stylistic constraints and simultaneously refreshes the palate, but Surly hits that svelte mark.","OrestesMethuon","Feb 10, 2015"

If you're a bit down on brown ales, try this one out, because it's certain to show you just what the style is capable of. The price of $3.29 for a single can is a bit high, but it's 16oz, and of great quality -- so keep that in mind.","Alextricity","Aug 28, 2014"

Malt-driven aroma, toasted bread, cocoa, herbal hops. In the taste, caramel malts, pumpernickel, herbal/floral hop notes, nutty, with hints of cocoa, mineral, earth. I'm not a big fan of brown ales, but this one is much more complex than most. Medium body, average carbonation, and overall pretty drinkable for the style.

I expect a bit more chewiness. The scent, like the taste, is fine - a bit of coffee and a slight toastiness - but not overpowering. Seems like an easy-drinking, summer version of the style.

The nose comprises mild graham cracker, grass, flowers, and a touch of Oreo. The taste focuses on the grass, flowers, and mild lemon peel, all to the detriment of the grain-y, biscuit-y base. Basically, they took the ""American"" label stereotype and ran with it, over-hopping what may have been a nice enough brown ale. A shame, really. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slick-ish feel. Overall, this brown just didn't sit right with me. It's too hoppy for its own good, and those grains mentioned in the blurb above don't come through at all. I wanted to like this stuff, especially given my love of Coffee Bender, but I guess I'll just stick with the coffee-infused version for the duration.","TMoney2591","Mar 24, 2014"

I get some grass hop edges and taffy sweetness along the lines of Circus Peanuts! But it's all quite tasteful and makes got a classic American Brown Ale.

Oily feel up front with assertive carbonation through the middle and a bit of a the thin, watery finish. Dark roasted and burnt malt flavors up front with chocolate flavors beneath.

There is also a nice biscuit malt flavor. Overall, very nice beer. Mouthfeel could use a bit more body, but for a 5% beer the lightness is not really too much of an issue.

Smells of caramel and chocolate mostly with some vanilla, a hint of nut and a bit of earthy hop presence. Taste is caramel and toffee mostly. Hints of butter, alcohol, and a slightly earthy citrus hop flavor seems a bit out of place. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet watery mouthfeel. I didn't enjoy this one as much as I had hoped I would. The malt bill has a distinct English esb meets dark mild feel to it while it also seems heavy on the American hops for a brown.

(4) S: Bread, cereal, coffee, cocoa, hints of grass. Nice subtle hazelnut tone. A little sweet. Nice. (4) T: Interesting, nice and bready again but with some dry nutty notes and a little bit of a sharp yeasty character. Finish is long and soily. (4) M: Thin with hi carb (a little too hi) and a dry finish. Would like a little more body or a little less carb to make this a little more palatable.

4,-2,4,4,4,4,4,"O- Bender is a fine offering from Surly in the Brown Ale catagory. Easy drinking, tasty, it's got a nice hint of hoppiness to it, which I find unusual for the style, but quite complimentary. I'd have this one again without hesitation.","Sideswipe","Nov 06, 2011"

Nice deep garnet darkish color. It smells of toast, chocolate, malt, coffee all at the same time. Man it is complex. Tastes what it smells like with a hint of vanilla. The head brewer, Todd Haughty is genius for putting this together. My first Surly beer I had in their first year of business and it remains my go to.

4.4,7.8,4,4,4.5,5,4.5,"This is an excellent brown ale, it really adds a dimension to a style that has always seemed a little bit 1D to me. Pours a deep almond/amber brown with a 2 finger tan head. Very ""chewy"" aroma, oats, toffee, caramel, faint citrus/plum like hop aromas linger. Tastes complex for a brown ale, oats and malt caramel form the backbone, strong cocoa notes, faint coffee, vanilla, and plum like hop character. Excellent medium weight body, chewy, just love to let it sit on the tongue. At ~5% this is a serious session brew, perfect for the transitional seasons on a crisp cold fall day or warm spring day.","manitouman84","Sep 06, 2011"

4.25,4.2,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Bender pours a brown so dark that it borders on black. Spotty cherry highlights shine through when the beer's backlit. The khaki colored head tops out at about two fingers of foam. Head retention is solid, and there's a thick ring of lacing marking the beer's apex. Subsequent lacing is a bit spotty. The nose is carried by sweet coffee and a touch of milk chocolate. There's just a little bit of lightly citric and fruity hop notes present as well. It could stand to be a little more potent as well. The flavor similarly bases itself around a sweet coffee maltiness. Here though, the taste of roasted nuts steps in and supercedes milk chocolate in terms of secondary sweet flavors. That light pacific northwest hoppiness is still there, but not as noticeable as in the aroma. Oats were a wonderful addition to the beer, I'm surprised I don't see them utilized in more brown ales (though I suppose other breweries might just not advertise their use). Whatever the case, the end result is a body that's a fair bit creamier than it feels like it has a right to be, given that it's not particularly full. It stops short of approaching watery though. The carbonation is just a touch higher than normal, it cuts through the malt and then there's just a little bit more, so each sip has a little bit of excitement to it. Surly Bender is one of the better American Brown Ales I've had, and one that would be in my fridge regularly if Surly was distributed here.","axeman9182","Aug 18, 2011"
3.95,-3.2,4,4,4,3.5,4,"O - Overall this is a pretty enjoyable brown ale. It gets better as it warms. This is the only brown ale I have ever had from a can I can't complain. I think it is balanced well. Could be a bit more complex.","wscaffe","Aug 15, 2011"
3.83,-6.1,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Not going to go too deep into this beer. Pretty much an oatmeal stout with a brown ale body. There are some really nice vanilla, and even a little bit of coffee coconut notes. A very good brown ale but probably not worth going out of your way to get.","Klym","Aug 14, 2011"

3.68,-9.8,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Pours a dark brown with good clarity and thin-light tan head that is partially well-retained. Fills the nose with powdered cocoa, caramel, and brewed coffee. Darker roasted malts. More cocoa coming through in the flavor backed up by some sweeter caramel-like notes. Moderately bittered bit an herbal hop presence. Medium bodied with a moderate level of carbonation.","BrewerB","Jun 30, 2011"
3.16,-22.5,4,3,3,3,3.5,"Poured this American Brown ale from a tall boy can into a pint glass. It poured a clear brown color and it produced a small amount of head however it did have very good retention. The aroma of the beer consisted of roasted malt and floral hops. The taste of the ale was interesting. There was a base of roasted malt and dark chocolate. The beer seemed to have oily hop start, which gave way to a chocolate and then coffee finish. The finish was dry- medium bodied beer. Overall it is an interesting spin on an English Brown Ale- which is why it is classified as an American Brown Ale. i would drink this again.","GossageBrewery","Jun 30, 2011"

Smell is of toasted oats, brown bread, and citrus zest notes. Taste is of oats, bread, nuts, and a citrus zest taste on the finish. Mild bitterness on the palate fades after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation that makes for a smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good brown ale and I am glad I got to try this one.","UCLABrewN84","Jun 29, 2011"

4.28,4.9,3,5,4,4,4.5,"Pours an impenetrable brown, two fingers of off white fluffy foam which mostly dissipates within a few minutes. Not much lacing to speak of. Smell is subdued, at times primarily honey, at times vanilla, sweetness, with a solid backbone of roasted and caramel malt and touch of oatmeal. Wow, really nice complexity... a lot going on here. Taste is roasted malt, a little honey and smoke; doesn't quite have the same complexity as the aroma, but on par with the style. No hops in either the smell or taste, but there is an ever so slight tinge of bitterness on the finish. Carbonation is good, medium-light body. overall, this is very sessionable with an incredible aroma, and which pairs well with food.","pmarlowe","Jun 18, 2011"

This ale's got more roasted and chocolaty elements than a lot of porters I've tried, without being pushy or out of character.

Overall, what I would expect out of a brown ale! The taste is toasty with hints of coffee and chocolate with just a bit of orange zest from the hops in the finish.

Taste is a little more aggressive than scent dictates but still under control... a nice blend of the above mentioned flavors where neither over powers the other, a nice floraly and bitter hoppy finnish on this as well. What makes it is the rediculously creamy body, makes this unique and such a great beer to drink, my only gripe here is that its a touch undercarbonated.

The flavor falls in between the bracing brightness of an IPA and the robust char of a porter. Either way, the bitterness is there and it leaves a significant and long-lasting aftertaste. I happen to love it. Malt notes from caramel, Munchen-type sweetness mix with the coffee tone, while the hops bring forth tobacco earthiness and a hint of menthol and pine.

Thin head, but retains nicely, and leaves a bit of lacing. Smell is average. Not much nose, a bit of dark malt is all. Taste is a whole new ballgame. Up front, a balance of sweet malt with dark malt. Then the oatmeal smoothness begins to kick in, along with some coffee/chocolatey stouteyness. It almost is like a stout that is flavorful without being harsh and burnt. Smooths out to vanilla, and a healthy dose of hops on the finish. Just enough hops to be interesting without overwhelming everything. Perfectly carbonated, super creamy, flavors blend and linger on the palate. Perfectly sessionable and very drinkable. If this were available in MA I would drink this all the time.

Taste is outstanding for a brown, loads of oatey malts, but a great hop bite makes for an exceptionally crisp beer; I'm no expert on brown ale, but this beer seems unusually clean and brisk in a category rich in sweet and mellow quaffers. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, pretty rich, with the hops clearing things out nicely, without the sweet sticky residue some brown ales leave behind(again, I'm no expert).

There are some dark fruits mixed in the sweetness and not much of a hop presence at all. The mouthfeel is creamy and this seems bigger than the 5%. Drinkability is great!

An earthy hop presence is noticeable in the first few sips, and even more later into the session.

Mouthfeel is pretty standard, but still good, with a medium-light body, gentle carbonation level, and a short-lived lingering bitterness on the finish.

The bitterness develops moreso as it nears the bottom of the glass... the taste & mouthfeel go through stages as the temperature rises.

Very dark brown, with a tan medium sized head, and ruby hues towards the bottom of the glass. Nose has lots of earthy spice, hops, light powdered chocolate, definite herbal tea smell, and just a little bit of coffee. Taste starts off on a very earthy hoppy note, followed by a nice round, roasty coffee/tea edge, and finally ending on a bitter note. Mouthfeel is medium, full of flavor, and leaves the palate without much of an aftertaste. It sort of comes in, hits you with a ton of fllavor, and then leaves as if it were never there. Usually I don't find darker ales to fall within the realm of session beers, bit this one might be an exception. A bit more body on this one, and you might be venturing in to Porter territory. Surly continues to impress me with this offering. If only I lived in Minnesota...cheers!","jamie2dope","May 16, 2008"

Smells like citrus hops with caramel malts and a pleasant nuttiness underneath. Tastes very interesting. First there's bitter, resiny hops. Then the malts kick in with a nice breadiness, and a little caramel. Mouthfeel is right in the middle and smooth. Drinkability is massively high, as this beer goes down extremely easy.

Deep, roasted malt starts it off. Interesting lemony hops show up later and linger. Make sure to drink this one warm; otherwise you're missing on the real fun. Interesting roasted feel to the hops, how the two elements mix themselves together. Some light fruitiness in the taste as well. Body is full and delicious, creamy and with a perfect spicy carbonation. Overall, a very tasty beer.

It is a medium/full bodied beer with near perfect carbonation. This a very good drinking beer. It's a wonderful example of the style; great taste and aroma.

4.45,9.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a barely translucent dark brown with mahogany hues and a nice foamy tan head that resists fading. It leaves good amounts of sticky lacing patterns behind. The smell is really nice. The aroma is primarily sweet malty chocolate and brown sugar. There's something else there also that I can't put my finger on, not molasses, but it's sending ""thickness"" signals. A nice tingle of carbonation, full bodied mouth feel with pleasant creamy texture that finishes with a gentle note of hops. Full of flavor, the mouth complements the Tootsie roll chocolate mixed with 'malt shop' something and Malted Milk Ball...what-ever-it-is. An easy drinker and the 5.1% ABV makes it one of the best sessionable things going on...and I bet it's lo-cal too! Also want to thank Pitmonkey for the recent trade. Highly recommended.","jjayjaye","Feb 29, 2008"

Nice mouthfeel. Smooth, creamy and perfectly carbonated. Flavor is nice for a brown. Not intensely flavorful, but nice and malty, with some roastiness and oaty creaminess.

Poured a dark brown with a creamy head that fades away to athin cap that sticks around. Excellent lacing. The aromas are spicy and malty up front, almost prickly, and then slightly sweeter and more roasty on the finish. There is a slight sour graininess at the end as well. Almost porter-like in its aromas. The taste is very smooth and the flavors are a little lighter than expected from the nose. Light chocolate, light roastiness, fresh cream, and a light grainy flavor at the end (rye?). Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with some light grainy tannins on the finish. A good effort if not speectacular. Goes down real easy.","Georgiabeer","Jan 20, 2008"

3.96,-2.9,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Thanks to Pitmonkey for the opportunity. Pours an impressive black that is actually a deep amber/brown when held up to the light. An off white 1/2 inch head meets the top of my imperial pint glass. The nose seems kind of weak, but I do enjoy the presence of the hops in there, as I do in most beers. Maybe I have it too cold but all I can really pick out is a light presence of some roasted chocolate. Taste is much more complex. Nice bitterness up front that transforms to a bitter chocolate that moves onto a subtle roasted sweetness and silky all the wayh through. A very balanced and layered beer despite my 3.5 in the ""smell"" category. Would make one hell of a session beer.","timbro81","Jan 13, 2008"

Poured out a deep, dark brown that had some garnet highlights. Almost two fingers of thinnish, bubbly, tan head. Decent retention on this one, leaving some thin streaky lace on the glass. Nose was a bit fruity, hoppy, and malty with an almost woody aroma tucked away nicely in the background. Taste was quite malty with a bit of plum in there. Just a tiny bit of noticeable hops in the taste. Even a bit of underlying coffee, brown sugary sweetness, and a thick nuttiness. Mouthfeel was medium bodied and smooth, with just enough carbonation.Very good drinkability.","jaxon53","Jan 06, 2008"

The flavor had an upfront hop presence with toasted grains and a slight sour finish. The mouthfeel was a little off because of a lack of carbonation.

Clarity looks good and there is almost no carbonation seen in the brew. The aroma is light roast with a mild nuttyness with caramel sweetness throughout. The flavor is more forceful than the aroma. Initial flavor is nuttyness with nice roast hitting behind that. It then goes to a caramel and nut again finishing with a mild citrus and pine hop and bitter. Mouthfeel is moderate with a minimal carbonation. This one is tasty. It brings a lot of flavor and is a nice brown ale. I would have this one again for sure.","kmpitz2","Aug 14, 2007"

It starts with a light hop bite then the malts kick in with a great slightly roasted bitter finish. Had a great balance. This would make an excellent session beer.

3.13,-23.3,3.5,3,3,3,3.5,"I'm surprised to see this is a ""brown ale," because I had it on tap and it looked and tasted like a stout. As such, it was a good, solid, hearty stout, but without much complexity. The aroma and taste had plentiful roasty malts with some distinct coffee notes. It had a relatively clean finish for a stout (but I guess that's because it's a brown ale). I probably wouldnt go out of my way for this, but its good choice when its available","Flyer","Aug 05, 2007"

Aromas of pine, caramel, toffee, and lightly roasted malts dominate. Some fruit character, a bit figgy. Maltiness was reminiscent of old ales. Stiff bitterness throughout, quite strong in the finish. Toffee and caramel sweetness provide some balance and light pine/floral hops round things out. Medium body and carbonation, some creaminess and a little dry. This beer definitely shows some aggression, but it's really quite nice. I'd love to try this on tap. Recommended!","DrJay","Jul 20, 2007"
4.23,3.7,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"My first taste of a Surly Brewing Company brew. Turns out, it was worth the patience and the hype. The sound of the beer hitting the bottom of the glass promises malty richness. The appearance is a meduim viscous, dark brown with ruby highlights. A 1"" head never fell. Aromas of solid barley malts, semi-sweet cocoa, and bold coffee notes blended well with complementary caramel, toffee, and a touch of fermented roasted malts. The flavors closely resemble the terrificly balanced aromas but show impressive intensity, strenth, roundness, and without compromising the balance. The cocoa flavors portray mild bitterness and solid richness. The coffee is very Columbian, and the hop bitterness balances the bitterness found in the cocoa and coffee. A mild lacto-sweetness rounds out the coffee acidity well. As the beer falls into the finish a firm nutty (pecan) flavor intensifies and carrys the beer into the finish. Very clean and bitter-balanced in the finish, allowing a soft, coffee / chocolate lingering. Not sure if this is the best Brown that I have ever has, but I am certain that I have had none better.

Taste starts off with a quick subtle hop bite but is then taken over by a smooth flakey oatmeal goodness. Flavor ends with a sweet coffee/cream like taste that lasts forever on the tongue. Mouthfeel is fairly full bodied with a good amount of carbonation, very smooth going down. Drinkability is great, could easily be a session beer.

Pours a touching florid mahogany, with blood red fringe and a soapy tan head, creamy. Nice lacing. On the tongue, a robust kick of malty sugars and roasted malt. Begins with a salty sea oat sweep and then slides into a coarse and grainy tooth of grain, orange peel, toasted almond and sweet honey. The oat brings in great character to this brown. Not overly hoppy, in my opinion, a nice balance with some floral and resin bitterness in the back end. A rather quaffable and delicious brew. Nicely constructed.","CharlesDarwin","Mar 10, 2007"

3.9,-4.4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Pours cola-brown to the eye, and a deep dark amber when held to the light. Good clarity and carbonation looks about right -- a can-conditioned beer? Sure, that's a step in the right direction. Uniform tan head settles after a good couple of minutes after a medium pour from the bottom-open can (I collect these things, folks!) Good lacing. Very good aromatics on the nose, merging 1 part of the straight-up malt sweetness I'd expect from a brown with 2 parts hop (bitter, aromatic) and 2 parts very good dark malt qualities: I'm catching notes of ripe red apple under some cherry tartness, as well as toffee and light cocoa. Poured this cold, but let it warm a spell. Light on the tongue upon the first sip, with big toffee and cocoa notes. Great aromatics, a definite marriage of porter and brown ale. Slightly tangy, with the cherry tartness from the nose coming through, and supple hop bitterness helping to balance this. Not as sweet as a lot of the brown ales, but on-par with most of the better ones for drinkability. Fairly roasty malt qualities here ala a porter, but with more dryness than many porters . . . an accomplished blend of the Brown and Porter styles. Alcohol comes through at times, but fairly unobtrusively. I can't really find the APA-derived stylistic tendency in here apart from the hopping, and again I find this more in line with a West-coast American Porter - tomato - tomahto, eh? Excellent drinkability, but I'm personally torn: as I drink it I look fo the malty sweetness (and yes, even some of the diacetyl) of a couple of my favorite American Brown Ales, but halfway through I get the drying hop bite and a rather quick finish. Mouthfeel and body are a wee bit on the thin side, but in fact this does nothing but improve drinkability - no disrespect intended, but I see this as a great ""style cheater"" to a nitro stout ala Guinness Draught. I have enjoyed Bender served fresh from the tap on several occasions and it's been very good each time, and this can follows suit, in fact it may even be better than the taps! Great consistency, great local availability, and great packaging too. So when is Surly gonna bring these great canned ales to the rest of the (non-beergeek) world outside of Minnesota? That's the $10,000 question. I'll bet the craft beer-drinking Midwest is waiting for Surly with open arms. . . . Bring On The Cans!","Chaz","Dec 26, 2006"

Personally this beer reminds me more of a scotch ale rather than a brown ale, maybe I'm dumb though. Very tasty and I could definitely sit down to a session of these. I can't wait to try this on tap.","RobertDwight","Oct 25, 2006"

4.9,20.1,5,5,5,5,4.5,"Pours a nice rich brown hue with a rocky tan head on it that lasts almost through out the whole pint. Smells of roasted malts with some subtle sweetness to it. It tastes of roasted malts, a subtle sweetness, caramel, chocolate and a small hop character in the finish. A medium bodied beer for the most part that has a nice slightly carbonated mouthfeel. Overall a beer with some great malt character with small subtle hints of other great flavors. This beer has a nice complexity to it with suprising character that is very pleasant.","ryantupy","Oct 10, 2006"
4.67,14.5,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Wow! This beer has manages to strike the near-perfect balance between originality & tastiness. Very dark color with a tan, pillowy head. Citrusy, toasty aroma. Taste is of toffee & coffee, toasty oats & much more, it seems. A lot going on in there. All the complexity of a porter with a hoppy character worthy of a pale ale. Very satisfying mouthfeel and definitely leaving me wanting another. Though after that 24 oz draw I was feeling it a bit & chose discretion...","hylton44","Aug 25, 2006"

4.2,2.9,4,4,4.5,4,4,"D- This beer has some nice dark malt flavors but they are supported by lighter malt flavors adding a nice complex taste with a very nice smoothness. Those big malt flavors are well balanced by some big hops flavors with good complexity also.","rhoadsrage","Jun 08, 2006"
4.25,4.2,4,4,4,4.5,5,"A tasty, tasty fresh brown ale with an excellent chocolate aroma and dark brown color. I'm struck by the smoothness of this medium-bodied ale. It drinks very easily, but has enough complexity to be savored as well. The malt flavors suggest darker fruits (figs?) and citric hops blend well with caramel malt sweetness. A roasted coffee flavor surfaces towards the finish which has the right smack of hop bitterness. A very tasty brown ale.","marcobrau","May 31, 2006"
4.32,5.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"This beer is somehow light yet, rich, balanced and complex. So easy to drink, you could enjoy it without ever noticing how well made it really is.","xymyl","May 26, 2006"

4.23,3.7,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"A brown ale with balls. So much so, I dont even know if its really a brown ale. Dark brown, the color of a porter, with great tan lacing. Slightly roasted and sweet malty aroma. Taste is complex with roasted and chocolate malts, american hops, and maybe even oatmeal. I think I tasted oatmeal. Very smooth beer, kind of thick, but very smooth. Give me another.","tempest","Apr 24, 2006"
4.33,6.1,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"I had not even heard of this company until I had one of these as part of the ""Hometown"" mini tour for Old Chi Town, and I have no idea why. This was an incredable beer. The waitress said it was a brown ale, and I thought she was mistaken when she set it down, it is basically as dark as a porter. It's more than just brown ale, it blends a lot of styles and darker malts, but remains suprisingly refreshing. They add enough hops so that i initally would say this was a porter by taste, but that is one of the great parts of this beer, everyone can find something they like about it. And it's only 5% ABV, so it's good for sitting down to have a few.","dfried","Apr 19, 2006"
4.55,11.5,4,4,5,4.5,4.5,"Slightly syrupy consistency. I am usually not a big fan of Brown's. This one is by far my favorite and I would even chose it over other beers I enjoy.","corporatejim","Apr 13, 2006"

4.62,13.2,4,4.5,4.5,5,5,"Bender pours a nice ruby-brown color with a creamy, moderate head. The aroma is sweet and caramel and chocolate come to mind. The flavor is full sweet with caramel and malt and subtle notes of chocolate and vanilla. The beer seems to jump back and forth between being a brown and a porter and since that was their intention, I'm cool with that. Mouthfeel is nice, balanced and silky. Very drinkable, if nothing for its complexity. A very nice and very welcomed beer in the Twin Cities. I want more.","bucko","Mar 22, 2006"

Im not very good at writing reviews to begin with and my review really doesnt do it justice. One of the best beers out therecongrats to Omar and the ""short, taciturn man"" on a job well done!","hanco005","Mar 19, 2006"
4.77,16.9,4,4.5,5,4.5,5,"What an introduction to Surly, I loved this beer. Dark body, impressive creamy tan head. Smell is rich and roasty, chocolatey and slightly sweet. Flavor was fantastic. Malty and chocolatey to start, black cofee and strong hops finish this one out very bitter and enjoyable. Enjoyed on-tap at the Triple Rock in Minneapolis. A fantastic place for my first Surly. Great work, keep 'em coming.","TastyTaste","Mar 11, 2006"
4.64,13.7,4,5,4.5,4,5,"Dark crimson/auburn tone. Creamy nicotine stained tan head. It sticks around for a little while and leaves some sparse and spotty lace. Really great aroma for a brown. Great chocolate malt tones and I get some nice fresh baked bread yeastiness that adds a real nice touch to the aroma. And I notice some hops on the nose as well. The mouthfeel is lightly carbonated. No signs of EtOH. Pretty creamy and smooth overall. Medium-full body. Bready malt base on the buds is layered with a nice roasted malt quality and some citric hops as well. Nice roasted malt bitterness lingers on the aftertaste with a lilttle hop bitterness added to the picture as well. Great flavor. And damn fresh!! I could drink a lot of these in a sitting. And if it were available in bottles, it would be a staple in my fridge at home. Not only is it good by itself, but I would imagine this would pair nicely with a lot of the common foods I tend to eat at home with the family...burgers, steaks, roasts, chops, etc...","Bighuge","Mar 09, 2006"
4.38,7.4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Here's a brown ale you can drink, and which makes you think. Rather than pass the time in between gulps of a light, uncomplicated sweetish brown brew, it grabs your attention and your palate and makes you wonder a bit about it, and ponder on what makes you like it so much. It's an excellent introductory brew for this upstart, as people can reach for it again and again over a night at the bar,(""another Bender", you say to the barman, and pretty soon you're on one!) and still ponder on it's quality and taste, and come back for more the next night.","feloniousmonk","Feb 04, 2006"
4.38,7.4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Welcome and Congrats to Surly for standing the test of times of starting a micro brewery in the MN metro. A very nice start. I'm sure, more is to come...","tavernjef","Feb 03, 2006"
