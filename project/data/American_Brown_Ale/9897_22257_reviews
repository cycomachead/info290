"Blend 10 -- 14.Dec.2012 -- The more I drank, the more I wanted to drink."

" I swear this beer is way more sour on tap. It is probably a difference in age of batch. I cannot make out the bottling date or batch number. The stamp is partially missing. i never had that problem with the stickers. Anywho, this is another quality beer from Jolly Pumpkin. They rarely disappoint. I was hoping for more sour, but I still like it a lot."

"A pretty tasty sour, authentic, but doesn't surpass the top of its Belgian counterparts."
"...not sure what category they should move this too, but this is in no way an American Brown Ale...."
""
""
"Prost!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a reddish brown with a thin off-white head. Smells sweet, yeasty and of wheat. Tastes sweet, copper, chardonnay, and a moderate sour bite. Medium body, light carbonation, sour and light wheat aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not your typical brown ale. Sour and just gross. I questioned if it went bad."
"Not one of my favorite JP beers but it definitely is interesting. Plenty going on in this one. The most I could give this is 4 stars, for the time being. 3.75-4. Definitely would like to try this again in the future and give it some more attention."

"Mildly cloudy copper pour with an airy off-white two-finger head. Nice sour fruit and funk aroma. Slightly sour cherry and citrus taste upfront backed by light spices, grain and sweeter malt. Finishes with a mild lingering tartness. Medium bodied."

"This beer is really sour.  Beer pours a rich amber with white head that is leaving a nice lace.  The scent and taste were primarily sour dough. The mouthful is medium in body with good carbonation.  Overall not for me."
""
""
""
""
""
"Another tasty treat from Jolly Pumpkin. Definitely recommended of you're like me and find most brown ales boring."
"On no planet is this a brown ale---it's definitely a sour, and a merely average one at that. Very thin mouthfeel, faint smell of orange, and overpowering sweetness, almost nutra-sweet-y. Cannot taste the cacao at all. Really pretty beer with a great creamy head, though."

"O. This is a very straight-forward, lightly sour ale. I usually pass on browns, but this is not your typical brown. This is a sour, no doubt. This has session written in BIG LETTERS. I go for this every summer, but this can be enjoyed any season."

"Not yer standard American Brown Ale (it does say 'special', right on the label), that much is certain right off the bat - the yeast and guest spices taking that bow of mea culpa.  However, it all seems to slowly work towards a common goal of good taste and whatnot, as the cocoa and spices blend into the base brown ale more or less behind the scenes, and the funk slowly, but surely trails off by the end. As usual, this brewery's beers are pretty hard to categorize or pigeonhole, and, well, all the power to them."
""
"This beer has a wonderful balance of sweetness and bready malt with its funk and tartness on the finish."
""
""
""
"Thereâ€™s a tartly sour aroma on this. The flavor has notes of dark cherries and some tobacco leaf. Great finish, with a Bretty character than hangs out for a chat. Interesting brew, much more inspiring than this review!"
""
"As a wild ale, this is a not overly sour, yet a nice beer to drink. It is sour enough to think sour, yet is fall on the lower spectrum of acidity (sourness)."
""
""
"Poured a auburn tinted brown body with one finger head and lace patches. The aroma could be summed up in one word, sour, but there are other minor notes that one can detect like wood, tart apples or cherries, and a touch of sweetness. The beer has a mix of these sweet and sour notes and I tend to gravitate towards these rather than traditional sour ales so this beer was mighty fine to me. Sour, tart cherries (still think I picked up apple) along with a touch of sweet malt balance together and go down smooth in a woody, oaky body. All in all an interesting and easy to drink beer."

"this trip down memory lane of revisiting all the jolly pumpkin beers has been time and money well spent. all of their stuff is awesome, maybe none more unique than this one, a tart brown ale with orange peel, cacao, and cinnamon, all of which are subtle but definite. hazy light brown ambery glow, heady as can be, bone white and patient. the nose is just like the finish, an odd relationship we don't often see, but its loaded with orange peel, citrusy, tart, acidic, yet dry, very clean and refreshing. this one may be a bit light for winter, even as a brown. i taste powdery cocoa chocolate malt, buttery cacao, zesty citrus fruits, wild yeasts and brett all over the shop, and only minimal cinnamon, just enough to make it puzzling. very light malt flavor, but there is a lot of body in this, made luxurious on the palate by tiny tickling bubbles, similar to other beers from jolly pumpkin, but rounder and softer from the cacao. all orange in the finish, a bit of brown malt, and a memorable zest of refreshment. a summer brown i think, but maybe more versatile with the cinnamon. their yeasts kick butt, and so does this beer, can't recall anything even resembling this one."

"A good funky beer that is probably a tad too old to show what it was originally made of. Still can imagine a underlying strong Belgian ale. More of it would do it good. Still pretty complex."

"Pours out a light brown/amber body with a thin head. Smells of funky Jolly Pumpkin house yeast, brett, and light toast. Light chocolate and caramel in the nose. In the taste: toasty caramel malts and funky brett and yeast. Finishes dry and very tart. Toast towards the end. Spicing is subdued. The chocolate comes out more in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is rather thin and light. Lively carbonation slowly builds in the mouth. Overall this is a tasty beer, but definitely not Jolly Pumpkin's best."

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 11/30/2010. Pours lightly hazy reddish copper color with a nice 2-3 finger dense and fluffy light khaki head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of tart apple, cherry, lemon, orange peel, pepper, clove, cinnamon, toast, cocoa, hay, grass, leather, funk, light vinegar, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt, spice, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of tart apple, cherry, lemon, orange peel, cocoa, toast, pepper, clove, hay, grass, cinnamon, leather, funk, light vinegar, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of earthy/spicy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of green apple, cherry, lemon, orange peel, cocoa, toast, pepper, clove, cinnamon, hay, funk, light vinegar, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of malt, spice, and yeast ester flavors; with a great malt/spice/tartness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a fairly creamy, crisp, and slightly acidic mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent wild brown ale! All around great balance and complexity of malt, spice, and yeast flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"Another damn fine beer from Jolly Pumpkin, this is something that could be thrown back, beer after beer after beer. You must understand however, this is far from an ""American Brown Ale"". It may have started as a brown ale with some caramel and Munich-type malts, but the oak barrel aging and wild yeast strains have turned this beer into a full-fledged American wild ale... funky, dry, and mildly tart - characteristic of many beers being churned out by Jolly Pumpkin."

"(O)- Honestly, this is not my favorite by Jolly Pumpkin, however I think I want to give it another try and track down a much fresher bottle to compare"

"O - Went with this $8.50 small pour at the prohibition taproom for my first beer during PBW. Should've went with the Obscura for price, but still an ok beer. Different take on a brown ale with the ""sour"" part."
""
""
""
""
""
"Once I smelled the beer I though I was in for a real delight, but unfortunately the beer did not deliver as I hoped. I might of been disappointed if I payed full retail for this."
""
""
" The taste is sweet at first with tangy fruit and gentle sour aspect and some wild yeast flavor with mild toast from the malt with woody dry and mild moist raisin in the linger with hints of spice but cacao and cinnamon are hard to pick up out especially over the barrel and wild yeast acidity. This is a decent brown with sour flavor but feel and aroma are slightly better than the taste with decent drinkability but alcohol is noticeable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: An interesting beer to say the least. I was unsure about this from the first taste but as it warmed it began to grow on me. Funky and tart but not as spiced as I expected. It's not a fantastic beer but I like the approach Jolly Pumpkin took on this. Probably wouldn't buy it again considering the price."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall-Not a ""drainer""...but I Would not buy again. At $16 for a big bottle...not worth it. Much cheaper sour beers with more flavor out there."
""
"O - certainly not a bad beer, but it's probably one of my least favorite Jolly Pumpkins. That isn't a diss, because I've liked all of them quite a bit. The taste was a bit weak upfront, but it had a pleasantly spicy, citrusy aftertaste that lingered nicely."
""
"Beer is with carbonation levels of medium-high intensity. This leads to a mouthfeel that is slightly fizzy at first, but quickly becoming smooth and foamy. Closes semi-dry, slightly puckering, with little residual stickiness on the palate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This brew couldn't not fit the style more, but it's absolutely brilliant! I feel bad about grading this one on a curve. As a brown ale it sucks, but as a WILD brown ale... it's crazy good! I will be getting more of this immediately, drinking some, and cellering a few."

"Overall an enjoyable brew nice brett notes on brown ale the orange was a nice addition. Hear Jolly Pumpkins all taste the same as a knock sometimes. Myself I enjoy the funky notes in all there brews."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O I really enjoyed this beer. I liked it more while it was cooler and the brett was subdued so the other characteristics could come out. As it warmed up and breathed it became much more dry and brett heavy. I enjoyed it cool so I cooled the rest down after my curiosity was sufficed, to bring back some of the other flavors. Great beer, pricy but worth trying since I cant get it back home in TX..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - very nice. I would get this again."
""
""
"O: A must try for the Belgian Brew Advocate who thinks he's/she's had all Belgian brews available. Not as strong as I would expect, abv wise but the flavor and experience is there. A must have for those Jolly Pumpkin fans, especially on tap."
""
""
"Overall, I'd say this is one of my favorite JP brews I've tried. Would definitely order it again. A great seasonal."
""
""
""
""
""
"It smells amazing but the flavor didn't back it up. Fairly bitter for the style."
"Overall a excellent beer but to little on the brown ale charactor and slighty more wild than normal... but hey whats normal? Cheers!!"
"Single finger head with excellent lacing on a murky copper body. Aroma of tart dark fruit, caramel and toasted malts, breads and candied citrus. Flavor follows very well with caramel, candied fruits, brown sugar and bready malts. Light to medium body, oily and light to medium carbonation. Almost has the sense of a brown blended with a sour beer. By the time I finished this one I loved it and wanted another. A very nice and complex brew. It's just a little too thin for me."
""
""
""
"I can't help but call this a weird beer, its labeled as a brown ale, yet it is sour and brewed with cacao and cinnamon. This is not a introductory beer because it would take a strong palette to appreciate the complex flavors and depth of this one. I almost don't feel worthy to appreciate all that this beer is made of and am greatful to have been able to get a bottle in Texas where it is not distributed (yet(hopefully))."

"Bottled on 12-01-2011"

""

"A light brown color with some auburn notes. Quite a bit of foam and carbonation, as it wanted to foam out of the bottle. Smell was really neat, with sour beer tang, a bit of spice (maybe cinnamon) and some richness from the cocoa and brown malt. The flavor is equally complex, with a fair bit of sourness and a pretty dry finish. Some pineapple notes in there, too. Mouthfeel is pretty light and zippy. Overall a neat beer. Very interesting ideas that really came together well."
"Overall: As always, itâ€™s another weird, wild ride from Jolly Pumpkin."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a really interesting beer. The fact that it says ""Special Brown Ale"" on the bottle is something that should be noted. It is definitely not your typical brown ale. It almost reminds me of a sour helles bock, who knows. Regardless, it's a really tasty beer."
""
"O - I think I was too jazzed to buy this beer for a celebration than I was actually paying attention, hence the old bottled date. Regardless, Maracaibo Especial is pretty fantastic, shining with deep, rich malt complexity, funky yeast, and a twist that puts a unique and welcome spin on a fall classic. I'd love to find this fresh and compare it's cinnamon spice and cacao additions to the aged version, though."
"OVERALL: A complex sipper worthy of being sipped and savored. Would pair well with stronger cheeses and fresh meats."
"Overall: I like this beer quite a lot. I think it is misclassified as a simple brown ale and needs to be set up as a sour ale or wild ale. Still, I like sours so I like this beer."
""
""
""
"Bottle with dinner at home. Pours light brown with heavy carbonation and a big fluffy white head. Sour aroma with hints of toffee candies. Light in the mouth and a great sourness, light vinegar, pairing with an interesting toasted flavor in the malts and ever so slight spice. There is a crisp finish that I assume comes from the orange peel and spices. This is light and airy with heavy carbonation. Went AMAZING with saurkraut and roasted pork. One of my favorite JP brews."
""
"Really nice tartness to it, and also a sour taste. It has a great complexity of both a sweet and sour side to it which I really appreciated. We also believed that it has a slight lactic taste to it as well."
"O: This is an excellent sour, one that is reminiscent of a dubbel, an American brown ale, and a Flanders oud bruin all at once. For fans of sour ales, I highly recommend Maracaibo Especial. It is definitely one of Jolly Pumpkin's most unique and interesting efforts."
""
""
""
"Six of us attending a beer tasting that I hosted in my man cave pub gave this beer a score of 8 out of a possible 30 for and an average score of 1.33 It ranked dead last out of the 12 beers we tasted. The group of six were divided evenly, 3 that favored IPA's and 3 that favored Stouts. It actually was so bad that no one even finished the 5 oz pour, and a good portion of it was dumped down the drain. It had a very vinegar taste. Maybe it was a bad bottle, I still have another one un-opened. But do I dare try it!"
"O: Well, definitely not a brown ale, that's for sure. Quite sour and very little brown ale character. Judging by the other reviews, this is supposed to be sour and not a brown ale. Ah well, should have read them before I wasted my money on a miscategorized brew."
""
""
""
"Have a big, thirsty towel handy when you open this - the sample I opened fizzed like a bottle of champagne in the locker room of the team that just won the World Series. It pours a hazy mahogany with a VERY thick light cinnamon-tan head that settles down after a bit. Aroma has a strong overtone of sour apple with a little pear mixed in and a malty hint. Flavor has a malty core, a strong overtone of sour apple, and a woody undertone. Is this a Belgian, or a Sour? Whatever, itâ€™s tasty. Texture has good tang and fizz, though body is a bit on the thin side. Lovers of sour ales should enjoy this one."
""
""
""
"O: This beer is really very interesting - very unique combination of flavors and smells. I like the sourness and the barrel flavors in the beer but it is not the easiest to drink. Good beer for sipping and the alcohol is well hidden."

"I'm not sure this beer should be classified as an American Brown Ale. The barrel-aging, spices, and wild yeasts may take some by surprise if they come looking for a mild, malty beer. This is a mild, acidic beer. An American Wild Brown Ale. Definitely something new and different. It reminds me that I still have much to learn."
""

"O: A great introductory sour beer, very complex and highly enjoyable."

"I've heard a great deal of good hype about Jolly Pumpkin, but my first try at one of their offerings was a complete disappointment. I will certainly try another of their beers, but I will certainly not believe the hype again until I taste the proof."
""
""
"PS-- this was the 2011 vintage. At our upcoming tasting we will try a 4 or 5 year vertical... So I'll update with my favorite!"
""
""
"Beer is a little chocolatey and a little lactic forward. It is fine but doesn't blow me away. I might have it again in the future but this isn't my favorite from this brewery."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The flavor has a bit of dark cocoa. There's a bit of light oak and earthiness toward the back. Not nearly as much going on as other Jolly Pumpkin beers; this is more ""normal."" It's a pretty good brew, but there's nothing there to take the complexity to the next level."
""
"Served in a 9oz. snifter, this beer poured some kind of orange-brown-pink hybrid color that I can only really otherwise describe as ""imperial topaz;"" hazy, with a thin cap of delicate bubbles on top. Aroma was a bit subdued: tart, but actually pretty mildly so, with soft notes of wood and leaves. Taste of cherries, orange pith and apple skins, again, like the aroma, tart, but not overly so, sour, but not lip-puckering, oak and leafiness, tannins, citrus, and light spice with the lightest dusting of cocoa powder. Very nice and complex. Medium-bodied, very drying, very easily drinkable, but nice to sip on slowly."
"This is kind of a miss for me. Nothing bad at all, and quite enjoyable. Though not one of JP's better offerings IMO."
"O. A good sour, with a tart finish and body. It was very delightful to drink. Lots of bold flavors and a wonderful finish. I can't wait to try more Jolly Pumpkin offerings."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: [DRINKABILITY] All of Jolly Pumpkin's offerings are supremely delicious and easy to drink - and Maracaibo is no exception. The light sweetness that rides out the palate helps to maximize this beer's drinkability. As always, masterfully done."
""
"O - The weak palate hurts this beer more than I would like. Good beer that has great other qualities."

"O: I don't agree with categorizing this as a Belgian strong dark. Granted it has some Belgian influence but lacks the major hallmarks of the style. It is an interesting brown ale with a Belgian twist and for that it isn't bad."
"I don't know what the person who wrote the label description was drinking, but it wasn't this beer. There's cocoa nibs in there? Could have fooled me. Not good at all, especially considering I paid $16 for the bottle. No thank you!"
"O: A decent shot at brewing a brown ale with Brett yeast but I'm left wanting more. This is my first JP and it's really an eye-opener for what this brewery is doing with beer."
"The beer orange hued with a thick, tan head that leaves copious lacing on the tulip glass. The aroma brings more funk and yeast - I would expect nothing else from Jolly Pumpkin. The flavor introduces more than was presented in the aroma. Cocoa emerges, along with some tasty spices. Really smooth feel with a nice, lingering funky aftertaste. Good stuff. I would have this again."
" Pours a nice brown/amber color w/ orange highlights when held to the light. Great two finger cocoa head which sticks around for a long time. Somewhat cloudy w/ good carbonation and great lacing. Nose is that of yeast, malt, cinnamon, orange, some funk. Very subtle nose, but really nice and balanced/complex. Taste is similar, although the cocoa makes an appearance, and the malt/funk really come out more. Very nice. Feel is fairly carbonated, with a battle between the funk and malt. Overall, this is a really unique and excellent brew. I would definitely buy and enjoy this again."
"An interesting wrinkle on the style, but not a beer I'm crazy about."
"O: bought this by accident I do like it but really meant to pick up the Madrugada Obscura stout."
"Odd, but I love its unexpected twists and turns. It's unique, but more than that it's really lovely and drinkable as well. Superb."
"Notes: I'm not normally a huge fan of sours, but i can appreciate them. This one is nicely balanced in its approach. The sourness is there, but it's not overwhelming. None of the more subtle flavors are lost on its account. If anything, maybe just a bit too much orange peel."
"Overall this is a tough beer to decide how much you like or don't like. It's very different. My tasting buddies and I went back and forth about it if it's infected or not. I liked it. But definitely didn't love it. Would not have to get this one again."
"But, as I said, every new Jolly Pumpkin is a joy, and I genuinely love the subtleties and intricacies of their different funky brews. This one ends up cleaner and way lighter than I expected on the palate, but still has the classic, exciting funk that makes every Jolly Pumpkin beer unique. There's a reason they're one of my very favourite breweries."
"O: This was not was I expected at all, but I came away with a very positive experience. there's more interesting stuff going on here than I could have ever hoped for. There are some very daring notes in this beer, and it all comes from a very balanced yeast profile. This beer is not too funky at all, but the funk paints a most complex picture over somewhat familiar sensations. This brew the work of an alchemist. The yeast is the star, where everything is influenced by its presence. Is that a familiar sweetness I taste? No, it's stewed tomatoes. Oh a nice salty sensation from the yeast, or is that green Olives?...wait, I mean Black? Ugh. That's how this beer goes. A wonderfully controlled chaos of complexity."
"O: This beer grew on me hugely in the course of drinking this. I wouldn't recommend this beer on the basis that it's simply delicious (not that it isn't), as I would many beers, but rather that there is enormous complexity in this. If you're looking for a beer to savor and ponder, this is it. Jolly Pumpkin is really catching my attention after this."
"Reviewing this as a BSDA is kinda weird as it is rather funky. Very carbed big puffy billowing slightly off white head. Actual puffy lacing on the glass. Deep amber red to brown color and it is opaque. Nice lactic sourness married with some spice and earth notes. Little bit of wood barrel is present too. The flavor is very unique, a blend of spice and sour. I can pick out the cacao, and maybe some allspice, and others which blend with the typical JP sour notes. Again I can detect some of the barrel flavor. Nice deep malty base backs all these complex flavors up well. Even for a well attenuated beer Maracaibo has nice body. Again not what I expect from a BSDA, but I knew what to expect as it is JP, pretty damn good beer, just not a BSDA. I'll have it again."
"I think the thing that stands out the most for me on this one is the particular version of this style feels incredibly refreshing for such a dark sour. Very impressive beer."
"Bottle labeled ""Blend 4 11-19-10"". Poured a light brown with some deep ruby red showing through in the light into a tulip glass. Two fingers worth of good head. Who doesn't like good head? Aroma has some Belgian funk/sourness, although this one is from Dexter, Michigan. Flavor is a little sour too, not in a bad way per say, just hoping it does not dominate. And it does not for long. As my palate gets used to the sour and/or it warms, the complexity of this brew starts to come forth. The spices, etc make for an interesting and enjoyable mix with the sour back drop. Thoroughly enjoyed this one on the deck grilling some chicken. This was my first offering from Jolly Pumpkin, looking foward to more."
"Overall: This was different, complex, and very enjoyable. I will definitely order this again. Even a while after drinking it, it keeps popping back into my mind as a beer I would like to go back to soon."
"Overall a tasty brew. These aren't cheap so don't think I would buy this but it was good to try."
"A little bit coarse on the mouthfeel but a really nice light body. Really an interesting beer. They really take some unique flavors on this and come up with a pretty enjoyable brown ale. This one is a bit yeasty after a while, but that's not enough to break the deal."
"D- A very interesting take on the style and being such a big fan of saisons, I probably like it more than the style should allow"
"Generally a decent bottle. but a bit underwhelming considering the other reviews. Truthfully the bret is a little stong- moderating it out with ped. and other sour bacteria would do it wonders in terms of balance."
"O - Certainly an interesting beer and my first try of Jolly Pumpkin. If you like belgian strongs this is worth a purchase because of the unique complexity."
"Overall good, and interesting. Quite unique."
"Pours a hazy dark red/brown with orange edges, big cream colored meringue head. The middle of which settles to half an inch leaving a ridiculous 1/4 inch thick sheet of lace on the glass. Smell: a lot of spices upfront, sort of peppery but also pie spices - cinnamon and something else? A whiff of cocoa, brown sugar, slight lemon rind component. Not quite hay/barnyard but you can tell it's going to get funky...warms a bit and you're there. Taste: barnyard funkiness, citrus rind, a bit cidery, cinnamon, brown sugar. Sweet, heavy on the spices, a bit funky with a light sourness. Nov release so has about 6 months on it. Interesting and would be a huge step up from the usual slate of spiced and pumpkin beers that come out in the fall. Batch 349."
"O: Boy was this interesting. The spices are incredible and dominate the overall flavors, but it's a nice drink. And it's pretty smooth if you let it sit."
"O- This is a solid sour that is worth the money. This is my third beer from Jolly Pumpkin and it is just as good as the others I have."
"This beer is tasty, but it had a pretty hefty price tag associated with it! It was a great celebratory drink, sour with Belgian spice and funk. I shared the bottle with someone as interested in good beer as me and heard great responses. I would love to try this brewery's other beers, but only when i'm ready to shell out $15 for a pint and a half."
"overall - easy to drink, tasty, and strong enough to keep you happy, will have again"
"Drink- Nice beer but for the 1st beer I have had from Jolly Pumpkin, I was a bit let down. I wanted more sour and felt the taste was a bit tame. Probably wont come back to this one."
"O: This is the second ""sour"" that I have ever had. It is quite different than the first and I have to say that i like it. It is very different than other belgian strong ales but at the same time, so musch the same. I am digging it!"
"Overall, this isn't quite as complex as the bottle made it sound, but it is a very drinkable sour beer."
"Pours a copper-amber colour with incredibly huge white head. Lots of lacing around the glass, great head retention. Smells quite spicy with some barnyard funk there too. Some sour vinegar flavour and I think I get some more fruitiness in the aftertaste. Really big carbonation level. This is a nice beer, fairly sour and yeasty."
"Pours a reddish brown w a good three fingers of head. Head is thick and quite persistent. Smell starts off with some sour notes, particularly green apple. This is followed by some nice bready malts and a decent amount of funk. Very pleasant smell. Taste starts out with a bit of mustiness, followed by tart green apple. Also got a bit of cocoa on the aftertaste, which was interesting and perfect for fall. Taste also includes some definite breadiness and a bit of orange as well. This is easily one of the more complex tasting Jolly Pumpkin beers I have had. Mouthfeel is nice; pretty light and highly carbonated. This is a very good beer overall, though the complexity of the flavor profile eventually caught up with me, making a 750 a bit too much."
"Very nice offering."
"Cheers!"
"Serving type: on-tap in a 23oz beer glass"
"Overall, I enjoy this for its unique take on a Belgian Strong Dark Ale. It's been aging for awhile both on the WF shelf and in the closet, and I hope it hasn't lost too much potency. But, a funk bomb it is and a wildly exotic one at that."
"This beer pours slightly cloudy with a reddish/brown color and a two finger, off white foam that remains for a good amount of time. The aromas immediately conjur memories of Belgian strong ales I've previously had. Bold scents of sour and spice warm my nose. As I drink a moderate amount of lacing follows the beer down the side of the glass. The sourness from the nose is accentuated by touches of citrus and tart. The beer is thin and smooth but not watery. The bitter, sour and citrusy flavors linger at the back and sides of my mouth. Surprised that the cacao was almost absent from the beer, as it was highlighted on the bottle. Could be that I was expecting something I shouldn't have been from that description. Overall a pretty good beer that grows on me as I continue to drink it."
"CHECK OUT THIS BEER!!"
"o: this may be one of my favorites from J.P. (and I really like all of their beers that I have tried). very very nice. I may have to find a bottle or two to lay down for a while. I'm sure it would continue to improve."
"D: interesting, I'll give it that. I've never had a sour brown ale, but this seemed like an amalgam of styles that somehow all worked together...or at least for the most part. I'm glad to have tried but I don't think I'll be buying it again, though I am interested in trying more from this brewery."
"O - not a bad beer at all not at all what i expect from the label and description on the front but quite pleased.... not pleased however if you take in the price on this thing. bit on the expensive and im not sure why side."
"D - This has good drinkability. It goes down easy and has a great and interesting flavor. I think this is a very easy going beer. I would recommend giving this one a shot. I really enjoyed it"
"O:Pretty good. I like Jolly Pumpkin's selections. The Old Mission brew pub is beautiful and I'd gladly go back to try something else. This was bought local, but I always look around!"
"glassware: tumbler"
"O: This beer is very easy to drink with all of the interesting flavors, but it's really easy to drink because any traces of alcohol are well hidden."
"I'm not sure how much I really like this beer. I definitely like it a lot, but part of it may be because of its uniqueness."
"A good tasting brew, very interesting. Very strong malts in there with a spiciness from the yeasts. It has notes of nutmeg and cinnamon with the roasted and bread-y malts. It has a mild sourness to it that is somewhat dominated by Brett and Pedio."
"D- this bottle was easy to finish. looking forward to trying it on tap at EBF. i really love jolly pumpkin ive decided. check out this beer from a relatively under appreciated brewery."
"Notes: Hmmm, subtle at best around those cacao, cinnamon, and sweet orange peel insinuations. Not a bad brew, lower tier from those IÂ´ve tried from Jolly Pumpkin though."
"D - Pretty good. Not too bad, I liked it but I think it would wear me down over the course of multiple pours. Not the best I have had from Jolly Pumpkin but far from the worst."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - Very different tasting from other Jolly Pumpkin beers, although the appearance and nose are similar. This beer has the most complex spice structure I've ever experienced. Very drinkable and would be nice to drink on a cool fall night."
"Not too sour, especially once acclimated. This is more of an earth, nutty brew."
"750 ml bottle, Blend 5, bottled 11-23-2010. Served in a DFH Signature Glass, the beer pours a ruby red/brown color with an inch tan head. The head sticks around for a long time, and there's a good amount of lacing left on the glass. Aroma is dark fruit, cinnamon, pears and some funk. The brew tastes like peppery spice, tart lemons and pears, orange peel, dark fruit and yeasty funk. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a little bit creamy and sticky and is also well carbonated. The soft carbonation helps make this beer smooth and easy to drink. I think this is a good brew, it's nice and enjoyable."
"myself and a friend were on a beer excursion hitting local places to try new beer. this was one of the highlights of the day. delicious."
"Flavor is nutty and sour, with done green fruit and strong spices. Green apple dominates throughout with a cinnamon spice flavor on the finish and a light pervasive, prickly sourness. Finish is a little musty and bready, detracting from the otherwise enjoyable and unique body. Body is medium thick with strong, fine carbonation. Pleadsant overall but unremarkable by JP standards."
"Blend 11. Bottled 12/14/10. Pours a hazy amber-brownish color with a big cream color head that hangs around for a bit. A beautiful looking beer. MMM Gotta love that signature Jolly Pumpkin scent... Some sour notes with a lot of funk and spice. Some fruit notes as well. As the beer warms I pick up faint aromas of cinnamon too. Taste is very Jolly Pumpkin like as well. I get a lot of citrus and orange peel as well as tasty spices. I get a lot of pepper in the finish. There is some nice barnyard funk to this beer as well, along with sour Brett flavors. I didn't know a beer that was slightly sour and very spicy could taste this good. Although not an extremely high ABV beer, the alcohol definitely makes itself known in the taste. Mouthfeel is full bodied and flavorful with high carbonation. Drinkability is fairly high, as the alcohol flavor takes it down just a bit. Another tasty beer from JP!"
"Great beer. Jolly Pumpkin makes exquisite, creative and wholly unique beers."
"Drinkability is quite high on this, as with most offerings from JP. Plenty of interesting aroma & flavor, and smooth going down."
"Lighter medium body, spritzy on the tongue, pretty dry throughout. Drinks nicely, the cherries are a nice touch and the alcohol is invisible once again. Not my favorite JP offering but another tasty one for sure."
"Pours a lightly hazed burnt sienna color with moderate cap of bubbles, gone quickly. Scent is bolder than many beers from Jolly, notes of carmel malt, nuts, bitter cocoa and bread mingling with the tart and funky notes. Taste follows scent and likewise is fairly bold for Jolly, there is a nice underlying beer below the funk and tart and those qualities actually take a back seat when they usually star in their beers. Medium bodied, again a nice moderate level of carbonation not found in their bottles. A nice beer which seems to do a couple things outside of the normal Jolly Pumpkin range."
"Drink is good, not much abv and the tartness is balanced well with light sweetness and bready malts and light funk, the lacto and flemmy take away a bit."
"Mouthfeel is good with just enough carbonation. Finish is perfect. Fairly dry with just enough sweetness. Flavor stays on the palate making it real easy to enjoy this one for a while."
"My first review..and my first try of a Jolly Pumpkin offering. I'll review this beer for what it was, not what JP claims it to be. It's definitely not a Belgian Strong Dark Ale. The funk and tartness make it an American Wild, and in that context, it was wonderful. Having looked thru the JP website after trying this beer at the Peekskill Brewery (a thumbs up for that place!!), my impression is that JP is really pushing the envelope. They appear to be true non-conformists and are exploring some really extensive boundaries with their brewings. I'll be trying many more of their beers and recommend the Maracaibo without reservation."
"This is NOT what I was expecting when I bought this beer. I was expecting to taste more cacao and spices and brown ale qualities at the very minimum. After a glass, I can't seem to find any of that, only sour apples. It's funky. Too funky, and nowhere on the bottle does it say anything about being a saison or farmhouse ale. It's supposed to be a brown ale with cacao and spices, inspired by the monastic brews of Belgium. Instead, it's a bombastic brew for a brown ale. It's sour. I'm not getting any cacao, nor any spices..it's sourness is overwhelming to me. I don't like saisons or farmhouse styles, so, this is especially disgusting to me. $12.00 for the bomber, and only one glass. The rest goes down the drain. No more Jolly Pumpkin for me."
"Overall I had been anticipating this beer for some time but I was let down a bit. The flavors are interesting and meld together well however nothing was robust enough to make me want to try this again. Worth a shot if you enjoy JP in general."
"D - This beer is quite delicious and funky with some nice Belgian yeast notes that make the beer refreshing and drinkable."
"Update: on my very last sip, when the beer was warmer I did get some cocoa notes!"
"Overall a fun beer, very different. Not sure I'd seek this out again. Seems like more acidity would do this beer well"
"Very satisfying and very noteworthy, this is another very good reason why Jolly Pumpkin is one of the best breweries in the state."
"Drinks: Jolly Pumpkin does this to me all the time. I want to like their beers more than I do; I just need MORE. More flavor, more tartness, more something. Maracaibo is a nice, well-balanced brown. It's just a little subtle for my palate. It did pair nicely, however, with some balsamic-doused salad. The astringent character of the vinegar brought out flavors in the beer I hadn't noticed before."
"D - This has alot working for it. This killer head, creamy mouthfeel, and the nice tartness coupled with your typical strong dark ale flavors. Hard to believe this is 7.5%, as it drinks much lower. A really tasty brew from Jolly Pumpkin!"
"M/D: Medium bodied, carbonation is slightly high but feels right. Drinkability is good, crisp body helps this. Overall, another solid beer from JP."
"d - A pretty good dark ale. I wasn't expecting the taste to be quite as sour, but it was still enjoyable. Would try again."
"D: Good not great for me. Maybe with some time and a building brett character might be better for my palatte."
"Poured with a smallish, light tan head that quickly subsides and no lace. Color is a clear orange, medium amber. Aroma has just bare hints of the ingredients in the description and some malt and a little earth. Flavor is big on the tartness that is JP's trademark and kind of trumps the other qualities that are similar to the nose. Body is dominated by the carbonation and I think could have maybe used a little more density. Finish is like flavor. Another good appertif. One and done. If you can share the big bottle or maybe cook with the leftover."
"It's not really a Belgian Strong Dark, it may have been before going wild. But that bridge was burnt. So I'll not review it as a BSD because it would do poorly. As a wild it's refreshing."
"This is a very distinct and unusual flavor; not at all what I would have expected from the description on the bottle! It isn't bad, but it is a bit odd - like a Belgian strong dark blended with a sour red with a bit of spices added in. A nice ale to try, but the flavor is just a bit odd for me (even though I like those flavors individually)."
"Bottle pours a dark ruby brown with a decent amount of foam. Glad this one did gush everywhere. The taste has a sour spiceyness upfront, but its not overwhelming at all. Dark fruits like orange and green apples linger through out. This goes down quite smooth and the second glass is drinking even better. Pretty solid beer overall. Glad I got to try this one."
"D: It may take me a while to get used to this, but I can see how you can easily acquire a taste for these type beers. It certainly makes me want to get another Jolly pumpkin for comparison, but at this stage, this will be a slow sipping beer for me and I may have trouble getting through the entire bomber."
"This is a great beer. If you like a slightly sour brown beer. Nicely balanced in that I can't actually identify any of the extra ingredients but can tell this is a different beer. I can taste some Brett L and Lactic flavors that make this very interesting to drink. I'd like to see more of this on american shores!"
"Â "
"Drinkability: Not too shabby and another great offering from JP. Nothing is going wrong with this beer, and the sour/funkiness from the Brett is actually fairly mild in this offering so it's pretty good for someone who doesn't have tons of experience in this area of beer."
"D - This is one of the most delicious brews. End of story."
"D: Goes down easy, nicely balanced, funk and sour are present but not overwhelming. I could enjoy a few glasses of this beer."
"Drank by itself but probably better with food"
"Thanks Eric for bringing this one over!"
"Pretty nice beer from JP, would gladly drink this one again and am interested to see how a fresher version might integrate the spicing in a little more. Fairly light and refreshing, yet complex. Thanks Eric!"
"I enjoyed this beer so much, that I got a bottle to-go for later. Bartender informed me, that she preferred the bottle vs. the tap."
"One of the best beers I've had yet, I bow to you, Mr. Jeffries."
"Mouth is a touch light, but good, refreshing, drinkable beer."
"A bit puckerish, and I need it to be paired with some food."
"D - I'm a total sucker for brews like this - I could drink this all night. So rich and dynamic to quaff and drink by itself, and so many possibilities for food pairings - I'd drink this with charcuterie, a slightly sour, semi-firm cow's milk cheese, or with a whole roasted chicken. This beer is yet another reason why I love Jolly Pumpkin..."
"The nose on this beer was interesting with all the promise of a good sour beer, the clarity and mouthfeel were nice, but when it came time to drink it...The bitterness was overwhelming with little malt to balance it out, making the beer almost undrinkable. I like most sour beers, but in this case it seemed like the beer was overly bitter and then the bugs ate all the residual sugars leaving the beer with an inhospitable bite in the taste profile."
"As I essentially state in all my JP reviews, I really enjoy these beers and for what the brewery is going for. I always come into these beers with an open mind free of bias so I can enjoy them to their fullest. I am about to go pair this with some cheese and crackers which I'm sure will be amazing. Cheers!"
"Overall, a nice sour. The spicing is overwhelmed, but I like the tart sourness and the brett. The only downside is the watery mouthfeel."
"D: Another interesting offering from Jolly Pumpkin. Certainly not my favorite, but I'd definitely give it another try and I'd like to see how it might develop with some age."
"A really interesting complex beer unlike any brown ale I've had before. Lots going on here - chocolate, orange peel, cinnamon & an overall sour flavor. The cacao lends a dry, bitter finish along with the orange peel. Thoroughly enjoyable. Highest recommendation."
"a very interesting offering. wish it was distributed to MA."
"I'd been holding off on this one because it was $15 but then I found one for $12 so that was easier to stomach. This was clear, amber, and didn't have much of a head at all despite the massive foam building inside the bottle, maybe my glass was not clean enough. The smell was quite buggy, suggesting sour as well as brett funkiness. The taste was very strange, at first it was like a sour, cherries but then there would be flashes of what I recognize as a brown ale as well as a little bit of the cacao but no other discernible spices. This was interesting but not something I would buy a second time."
"I enjoy this beer quite a bit. I find it easy to drink with a pleasant level of complexity."
"D - Easy drinking and very interesting. Makes you want more."
"Pour this baby SLOW!! Coming out of the bottle into my Duvel tulip it created a ton of head. Nice deep brown color and some sticky lacing. Immediately get whiffs of brett, but that's not really surprising coming from a Jolly Pumpkin bottle. Other aromas include low alpha acid hops and a subtle coffee undertone. Complex variety of flavors including Lemon, orange rind, ginger and chocolate. The flavors hang out in my mouth a while after swallow and has some excellent carbonation. The more sours I taste, especially from JP and Russian River, the more I like them. Starting to be a devout worshiper at the alter of sour."
" Smells sour more than this beer really is... but good, actually really good. Wow very complex coco, spice, funkyjammyfruityeast. Very effervescent and light on the mouth. I found this to be really tasty, similar to their beer de garde only replace hop with bittersweet chocolate. Very good and very complex, a must try product. I got mine at a beer bar in seal beach for 23 bucks (750ml), and am feeling like it was a steal."
"taste starts off with a mix of cherries and other fruits, some chocolate in the middle with apples, finish has a big wood presence with a mild but luring tartness, some dryness in the aftertaste, tart, fruity, and dry mouthfeel, medium bodied, high carbonation, could drink the whole bottle, light and complex, alcohol is hidden well and not too strong to begin with, smooth for a Jolly Pumpkin brew, would drink again, worth trying"
"D - Like the other brews from Jolly Pumpkin has that funk barrel taste that I love worth trying sometime"
"really amazing... really... something not american... tasted like a 'surly bird' by De Proef... that is if you can find a good bottle. good luck."
"Drinkability's so-so, but it is a sour/funky beer, so that's to be expected. the mouthfeel does a lot to make it drinkable even though it's a palate-challenger in some ways."
"D - This is the kind of beer that I have come to expect from Jolly Pumpkin, a very flavorable and unique beer that was great to try, something that you cannot drink sessionably but once in a while"
"Drinkability: Incredibly drinkable for its complexity. No perceptible alcohol, again."
"And I'd even say that perhaps this is not that compelling in comparison to some of their other beers that are more full-throttle, but this one is certainly more balanced in some way."
"On that note, the beer is neither cheap nor easy to find, so if you don't like wild, funky ales then simply don't commit yourself to a whole bottle. I hesitate to say don't bother because I really consider the work of Ron Jeffries among my favourite of America's artisan brewers; Jolly Pumpkin is an experience for everyone to have, at least a little, at least once."
"This is my second spin with this beer. It had a greater impact on me the first time around (at a BA tasting of dozens of excellent beers)."
"I think it would be beneficial for reviewers to put the batch number and the year if possible for this beer, as it is aged longer than most of their other beers."
"D- This is a nice sipper. Overall, this is a pretty interesting beer but does not live up to the high standard I've come to expect from Jolly Pumpkin Beers. This is probably my least favorite of the breweries lineup. It's definitely worth a try though."
"An ""interesting"" sipper here. A spiced brew that goes towards Oud Bruin, with less maltiness. Different - a fine sour and spicy sipper, that doesn't fit into a particular ""style"" per se. Not as rich as I was hoping it would be, but certainly worth having as a ""something different"" brew."
"Overall an interestingly complex sour ale that is relatively accessible. I would have preferred some more malt character."
"Overall, another great offering by Jolly Pumpkin. While the combination of brown ale and various other ingredients was interesting, it did lack a complexity that I have seen in other great beers of this style. Still a solid brew."
"I love JP beers, and this is no exception. Highly recommended."
"D - Another nice beer from JP. As with all of their products it is hard to attach a style to this beer, but it is complex and refreshingly sour. Somewhere between a Flemmish red and a acidic, Fantome-style saison; which is a combination that suits my taste quite well."
" This beer is complex in its simplicity"
"Light brown with a medium manageable head. The woody chocolate flavor takes center stage. The signature Jolly Pumpkin funk takes a background note. This Jolly Pumpkin taste is a bit sour with some alcohol in this beer. The basic cocao flavor is very hard to place but it reminds me of a piney as in pine tree flavor dominated by chocolate."
"Pours a cloudy chocolate brown color with tan head. Sour aroma that consists of chocolate maltiness, oak, dark fruit and citrus. Flavor very similar with lots of oak, vanilla, chocolate malts, candi sugar, dark fruit and orange peel. Very tasty!"
"Drinkability - This a really easy drinking beer. Very well crafted - not over the top. It has just enough sour funkiness to make me want to keep sipping. But it is so damn good that I don't want to finish it. I am not a huge fan of the whole ""orange-chocolate"" things in general, but Jolly Pumpkin really makes it work with this brew. Good stuff."
"Bottle labeled as Batch 254"
"An hour into this beer and there's still that zombie foam on top... unreal... this is weird stuff and you should try it."
"Side note, this seems like more of an American Wild Ale or a farmhouse ale to me than a BSDA. No matter - the more I drink of it, the more I like it. Just one of those beers...it might take a glass and a half under your belt to begin to really ""get it."""
"Overall a a nice beer, probably not my favorite Belgian Strong Dark, but nice for a change of pace."
"Drinkability- I'd pass on this if offered again. Wasn't really bad., but just not my cup of tea."
"D: I liked this beer, but it didn't really impress me, hoping for more chocolate and spice. Would have again for sure if offered, but whouldn't shell out the $12 for another bottle."
"D: A true and rich delight."
"Poured from a 750ml bottle and served in a tulip. This beer poured a murky brown with a sustained head of fluffy tan foam. Solid lace encompassed the entire glass. The aroma of the beer was made up of caramel, mild citrus, cinnamon, and also an oaky, vinous note. The flavor included lightly sour cherries, orange, spicy yeast, and an almost hidden trace of roasted malt. Mildly funky, but the taste seems to be muted by this aspect. The mouthfeel was medium-bodied with light carbonation. This beer definately has the house characteristics you'd expect from a JP beer, but not much else. Still fairly enjoyable though."
"I could tell as soon as I popped the cap that I was in for something special. There is a wonderful nose on this beer. Plenty of spice, tartness and funk. The taste is incredible. The taste has a nice dose of cacao. The mouthfeel is full and creamy and just the perfect amount of carbonation. This beer is a real treat."
"Bottle courtesy of Kryptic: Poured a hazy brown color ale with a bug light brown color head with great retention and great lacing. Aroma of funky yeast with some brett-like aroma with some sour and tart notes. Taste is also dominated by sour notes with loads of oak and barnyard-like notes. Minimum filtration with great carbonation and no apparent alcohol. I really enjoyed again the wild taste of the JP beers but cannot say that I detected much cinnamon or cacao."
"Overall it is a very pleasant easy to drink beer."
"A disaster on many levels."
"Notes: Excellent stuff, one of the better JP offerings I've tried."
"Overall it's very clean and crisp, with a light feel despite the somewhat medium body. Carbonation adds some brightness. Swallows very clean. Drinks well overall, with a nice somewhat unique taste. Lacking depth for the style, with the tea flavor become somewhat taxing."
"Not a favorite of mine..."
"D: Sharing a bottle between three was perfect."
"In a bottle purchased while dining at Stone. Batch 253. Poured a fairly clear medium brownish red, generous airy head. Smell was mildly to moderately sour but a bit sweet. The taste was tart with the standard Jolly Pumpkin woody barrel taste. It's like a wet toasty wood is the best way I can describe it. A light-medium body on this, I didn't get any of the cinnamon or orange peel but perhaps some slight chocolate character. Very good, my favorite JP beer so far."
"Poured into a chalice a nice golden amber color, very nice carbonation, very nice one-finger plus creamy tannish head, lots of nice creamy sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, tangy, bourbon, slight spice, plums, figs, raisins, and some caramel. The taste is malty, pretty tangy, some bourbon going on in there, some spices, dark fruit, and caramel. The alcohol is hidden fairly well. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is an awesome brew, highly recommende, slight twist on a BSDA."
"PS - this bottle was from Batch 254."
"Overall, this takes the cake for me in terms of Jolly Pumpkin beers. Bam Biere is probably the best day-to-day drinker, but this is #1 for overall awesomeness."
"Poured from bottle at PP bottle shop into small pilsner glass. Poured a chestnut brown color with foaming off white head. Smell is sour funk mixed with hint of spice and cacao. Taste is malt sour with a nice tartness on the front followed by cinnamon and cacao on the finish. Carbonation is ample with a medium body mouthfeel. I like this beer very much and think is a great drinking belgium brown with a few twist and turns."
"D- Amazingly smooth beer, unfortunately the flavor falls short of the fragrant aromas, this is an intriguing seasonal from JP that has a lot of promise but doesn't quite deliver"
"cheers"
"D- Another delicious brew from JP. They really can't do any wrong. Get some."
"This may only be my second Jolly Pumpkin experience, but god damn they make some fantastic beers. Amazingly unique, a style all their own. These beers greatly remind me of good funky wines. These are perfect to serve to any wine aficionados you may know"
"Drinkability is good, but the sourness is intense."
"Wow, what an original brew. Very odd, I've never had anything like it before. To be honest, I'm still not sure if I even liked it or not. I need to try this one again to wrap my head around it."
"The mouthfeel was very smooth, creamy texture without any sweetness, hops are basically non existent. There is the presence of sour fruit, possibly cherry; it's very dry with an intense cinammon-nutmeg sharpness and quite spicy. It seems there is a balance between the sour fruit and the intense spice but no hop presence or bitterness that I missed. Still, this is a beer to savour, the delicate interplay between the sour and the spice, with a tart finish, is very enticing and a taste experience. Very dry too. The alcohol gives it a bit of a liquer-like aftertaste, warmth in the mouth, while preserving an overall positive drinkability. What a nicely crafted beer, thanks to biegaman for suggesting I pick up a few Jolly Pumpkins and this one in particular."
"Drinkability is exceedingly high for any beer, sour ale, brown ale, whatever. Very complex but rounded and understated. I can easy drink a few of these, a perfect thanksgiving beer."
"Jolly Pumpkin Maracaibo Especial pours a clear brow with a creamy off white head that fades to a thin layer. The aroma is sweet caramel and dark fruits with a nice tart undertone. The flavor is at first sweet but then very tart, almost sour with tons of fruity flavor, orange, cacao and others. The finish is tart and more astrigent than bitter."
"Pours a deep amber brown color with a tan head. Aromas of cocoa and tart fruit. In the taste, sour upfront with cocoa undertones, and a nice alcohol presence. A sour fruit mouthfeel with a sour alcohol aftertaste. The coca was nice mix with sourness. The alcohol held it together. Is Jolly Pumpkin the Fantome of the USA? I think so!"
"Ultimately, I was unable to finish a glass of this beer. There are too many other great beers in the world to try to choke down this."
"Pours a reddish brown color with an adequate white head that sticks around for minimal show before heading for the door. Not much lacing. The aroma is very nice. The brett character reminds me of a flanders red. The taste is interestingly unique. There's a slight sourness accompanied by hints of cacao and hop bitterness. Background sweets accompanied by a light orange flavor and a touch of clove or maybe cinnamon. Nice carbonation and overall mouthfeel. This is a subtle brew, and if there was one knock, it would be that the taste is kinda hollow. Like there's something missing. I guess I'm looking to be smacked in the face with cacao or something, but all I get is restrained balance. But, you can make a case that it was intended that way, and I'd bet that it was. Very drinkable. Another awesome beer from JP."
" The kind of beer my closest friends and I love--real crazy wild yeast ""Belgian"" flavor!"
"Maracaibo Especial (and the rest of the Jolly Pumpkin lineup) strikes me as 'no compromises' kind of beer. It seems as though the brewer has a particular vision that he doesn't care to deviate from. Hey Ron, would it kill you to ease off the funk and to allow some of the malt sugars to make it to the end product?"
"In the glass, the beer is clouded red-brown. Only a scant 1/3 inch of head, but what's there is an impenetrably dense cream that sticks to the sides of the tulip. Smells like a Flemish sour ale laced with oranges, black pepper, a bit of powdered cocoa, and dusty yeast notes. The ale is fairly sour in on the tongue, with nice orange, lemon, and pepper notes that build to a rather dry, earthy and powdered yeast plus cacao finish. Don't expect much chocolate flavor, as the spicing tends much more towards orange and lemon except in the after-taste. Body is medium-rich, with plenty of carbonation. Quite drinkable as an after-dinner treat. Lovers of sour Flemish ales will find this enjoyable."
"Pours a translucent ruddy, glowing brown with a nice, thick, sustaining head. Rich aromas of a classic Belgian sour ale. The taste is complex and contradictory: earthy but not malty, with bitter cinnamon notes, and fruity qualities that are at once sour, tart, and dry. I can't really detect the cacao and I might not have noticed the hint of orange peel if the label hadn't mentioned it, but there's still a lot going on here. It finishes with a nice, sharp, tartness. Excellent."
"Pours a cloudy orange/brown, roasted pumpkin looking, small tan head forms, leaves some nice lace patterns, solid ring. Smell is typical JP, vinegar, wacky sour funkiness, cocoa, spicy yeast, bready, very nice. Taste is cacao, sour funk, caramel, spices, full rich yeasty bread, buttery, sour finish. Mouthfeel is medium to light bodied with medium carbonation, very nice. JP never lets me down!"
"A fine, flavorful taste, rich in spiciness...a combination of fruit and spice with a touch of yeastiness...no hoppiness or bitterness whatsoever. Belgian-like yes, but with a unique spin."
"Pours a light brown with serious amber/tawny highlight. Short mocha head. Even after letting this beer warm a bit, I am only picking up cocoa in the nose, not in the taste. Also some nutmeg spice. Taste is a somewhat sweet tartness, markedly different from their other Brown Ale offering, Fuego. Mouthfeel is somewhat thin and airy, like most if not all Jolly Pumpkin beers. Drinkability is damn good too. Alcohol is not an issue at all. The only issue is how much sour can you take?"
"A 750ml bottle poured into a tulip glass. Red/brown color with a tiny head. Citrus aroma, cinnamon/clove spiciness. Taste followed suit: citrus, spice, cocoa, all nicely tied together with a pervasive, but pleasant, sourness. A light, easy to drink beer that belies its 7.5% ABV."
"Pours a dark redish brown with a good head and good lacing.The smell is lemon, spice, and some dark malt aromas. The taste is similar, with a delicious moderate sourness up front,followed by a spicy creaminess and fairly deep cocoa finish. Very nice. Mouthfeel is fairly light and refreshing but with a nice creaminess as well. Very nice beer as are somany of the Jolly Pumpkin brews."
"D - More of a dessert or sipping beer due to the intense sweetness. Hard to pair with a meal because of this reason. If you can handle the belgian spices and sweetness, this makes a nice beer to share and enjoy."
"Drinkability - this is one I'd get for a beer tasting with some seasoned palates. The sourness would be too much to push on the macro crowd, but for those who have entered into the craft scene it would get a better reception."
"It is a well made beer. It has good small bubbles, a decent medium body and as a sour brown it makes sense. I don't like sour brown. Call it sour and I have no problem. It's true to style but who knew...True."
"An excellent beer, I wish my scoring in the drinkability category was higher. Unfortunately I cannot see drinking more than a snifter of this because of the bitter spice finish."
"Drinkability: It cost a little more than the usual Jolly Pumpkin offerings, but I really don't care. I'll pay a little more for this one. Is it a Brown ale like the label stated? No, but I honestly don't care what they call it. I don't care if it was labeled a ""Special Pale Ale," It would still be good either way. If you like sour beers like I do, then you'll like this Jolly Pumpkin offering too. I forgot to mention that if it wasn't for fellow BA Pepeton, I wouldn't have know that the name means Maracaibo's (Venezuela) Special in Spanish. Thanks Pepeton!"
"Wholly different experience, for me, from an American brewery. Not sure I am a sour fan, but want to try more from this brewery."
"I picked up a bottle of this as well as the Bam Bier after hearing quite a few positive comments about this brewery. This one poured a cool rasberry color (light for this style) with a small white lace heading. In the nose were smells of tart rasberry, gummi bear and faint chocolate. Taste was puckering on the palate like a Belgian Lambic. Specific tastes such as rasberry and sour apples come to mind. Mouthfeel was medium in body. I probably will end up finishing the bottle of this. The sour notes are there, but not too overpowering. This might be the most out there interpretation of this style to have crossed my palate yet. It definitely has Lambic traits, yet is also like a Belgian dark ale in the chocolate notes. Whoever said this brewery was good was not lying. I want to try all of their beers now. Brin on the Bam Bier."
"Drinkability: I would definitely revisit this beer if given the opportunity. Again, a taste for sour beer should be had in order to enjoy this one. Because I have that, I will drink plenty of this and other Jolly Pumpkin brews in the future."
"Cheers!"
"Pours a cloudy brown color with a tall head that fell slowly and left plenty of lacing on the glass. The aroma had a lot of sour notes along with some spices as well. The flavor was very sour compared to what I expected - not quite puckering, but just right. Lots of fruity and spicy flavors to go along with the sour character. As it warmed, more flavors appeared - very complex flavor. The mouthfeel was medium and the drinkability was good. This is definately a beer I'll seek out again."
"Effervecent and envigorating without overwhelming the tongue. Much lighter than the appearance would lead you to believe and it resembles many other Belgian-style ales in this regard. Maybe not everyone's cup of tea but I find it to be immensely drinkable and the alcohol is hardly noticable. Quite good."
"D - Seems like more of a spiced sour brown ale to me but it is very tasty. A nice take on the style."
"Off the first sip I can say this is my favorite Jolly Pumpkin beer I've had the pleasure of sampling. Mouthfeel is full and rich. Dry bitter cocoa shows through tremendously on the mid palate and long bitter finish. Earthy loam, big and chewy. Sour bing cherry, rasisin, very spicey. This is a dinner in a glass. Malt balances the brett tremendously. Overly drinkable and absolutely delicious."
"Pours a golden cinnamon with a pulpy haze, lots of little bubbles scurrying up to the dense, creamy, dirty sand head. Nose has that unmistakable wild sourish Jolly Pumpkin twang. I love it too. Behind the zesty funk lies caramel and butterscotch malt, some baking spice, a hint of anise, and maybe some light banana. Lovely. Taste starts with acidic blasts of sourish citrus, Brett, and vinegar. Light toasted malt, cookie, and some caramel notes mid-palate. Sour, drying zest never goes far. Finish features light tropical fruit, herbal bitterness, and, of course, tart acidity. Medium-bodied, with a lively, bottle-conditioned feel. Dry finish, very appetizing. Very nice."
"This is an interesting foray into beer, that I wasn't expecting at all. I love some of the other beers from Jolly Pumpkin, but this one, not so much. I can't tell if this is exactly the way the beer should taste, or if the bottle was infected (as evidenced by the geyser of foam, and horrendous mess). I'll have to re-review this if I ever get my hands on another bottle."
"Huge, foamy brown pour with a massive tan head and tons of lacing, even in a plastic sample glass. Powerful aroma, strong and yeasty, like unbaked bread dough. Taste is more fruity, with sour apple, orange or tangerine rind, and some chocolate malt backbone. Solid mouthfeel. Tasty and different!"
"ThereÂ’s a lot going on this ale, despite the rather mild-mannered first impression it first gives. I cellared this bottle for over a year, and it was damn good. IÂ’ve had it fresh, but it was long ago, so my memories are unreliable to non-existent. Definitely an outlier for the strong-dark style category. It seems like more of a dubbel/strong-dark hybrid, but whatever you call itÂ’s a tasty ale."
"Poured into my Duvel chalice from a 750 ml bottle...appears a deep ruddy amber hue with a large beige foamy head dwindles leaving behind fine lacing evenly around the glass. Aroma contains perfumey oak notes with tart lactic brett funk, spicing is evident but hard to pick apart and I'm not sure what type of sweetness cacao brings to the mix. Flavor is incredibly complex yet finishes in a combonation between the oak barrel aging effects and the funky wild yeast notes very barnyard with a diverse mix of sweet, tart, and bitterness very interesting brew. Jolly pumpkin beers all share common characterisitics for sure, but this one is somewhere in the middle of how well all flavors are expressed. I'm a fan but Oro and La Roja kick this one to the curb so far I've tasted Luciernaga (favorite), La Blanche, Bam Biere and this one is in the middle. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with somewhat effervescent carbonation and really sticks around with a dry finish a bit ciderish with the tartness. Drinkability is nice like I said I dig what Jolly Pumpkin is doing, and this is just another great beer."
"Originally reviewed on June 2, 2006.Aroma is a flow of light sour wooden oaked oranges and brown sugars, with floating esters, touches of flaming warmth, lechees and hints of cinnamoned pears. Delicate, enticing and all around fantastic. Pour of lightly hazed ruddied mahogany with a creamy soaping head of off-white. Flavor is a concentrated heavy cheese of oak and tannins. Dusty. Tart lemons over dusty horsebarn. Sour in a good way, but not really possessing the gentle coconut or pineapple. Stalks of green rhubarb coated with white sugar and eaten raw. A husk of faint chocolate. Flavor develops as beer builds. Tounge develops resistance, then follows new path, with a run of sliced green apples and monterey jack cheese. Spice with a hint of ginger and light lime peel. Body is impressive, with good levels of sweetness, but not too attenuated. Perfect level of drinkability. A kick of light dry hopness on the backend for balance. Not really a Dubbel in my book, more suited to a Brett Belgian Ale. Unfortunately, itÂ’s as if they took a very nice spiced Dubbel or Brown ale, then ruined it with Brett, but the Brett still tastes good."
"I was surprised on how sour this was. I know the brewery is fooling with wild yeast strains, but this was gushing white. Lambic aroma vinegar. The others who shared the bottle gave great reviews so I am pressing ahead with my impressions. Hypnotic effect for those used to sour beers in terms of drinkablility, it wasn't a cantillon but the sourness overpowered the spiciness."
"drinkability is good. very interesting beer. spiced a little higher than i generally go for, but still enjoyable."
"on tap- MI brewerÂ’s guild fest, winter-06- Dark brown pour with slight haze and a thin beige ring atop. Yeasty spice aromas are first and foremost, with smoked brett and dark cherries. Sour cherry flavours with spices and an earthy yeastiness. Tart finish with some sweet malts towards the very end. Good!"
"Not recommended."
"A winner from JP..."
"D- This beer has a dark and subtle complexity that is reinvented with each sip. It has notes of wild ales but not a big Gueze bite like many lambics. There are flavors of brown ale and a very faint cocoa hint in the finish that I wouldn't have picked up on without reading the bottle first. Very mysterious."
"Mouthfeel- One of the dryest dark Belgian beers I've ever had. But still very complex and different."
"D: I'll get this again if I can find it. Really tasty the alcohol content is masked by the flavors. Overall I would suggest trying this for a unique experience. A great complex beer."
"i am"
"This one starts with the typical fruity keg-o'spice and then languidly ends with a gradual fog of descending cacao cloudiness. Not how I prefer my darker beers to be but this one tricks the palate into believing that there are actually two beers at work here and really in essence there are: the standard fare high quality super mofo Jolly Pumpkin brew with a russet echo."
"Beer is good. Happy RR beering."
"This is a very drinkable beer. Definately pick some up if you see it."
"Taste; starts out with the sour apples and tart cherries, with a little bit of chocolate and cinnamon thrown on top. Molasses and caramel malts follow behind the fruits, and then the baryard funk starts really come out. There's some old hay, horse blanket and vinegar in the finish. I thought the finish was a bit harsh at first, but it smoothed out a lot after I let this warm up a little. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, medium bodied with moderate carbonation, and suprisingly drinkable with all of the sour and tart flavors."
"Not a beer I can really recommend here. Below par Belgian Ale."
"Not sure if lengthy aging would help much, as sourness of this magnitude does not fade significantly over time."
"Medium mouthfeel of bready malts are clensed with a tart funky rush that keeps the palate wanting more. Highly drinkable if one were interested in a bit of funk"
"Drinkability: pretty good. Worth picking one up."
"My wordÂ… this is a wonderful beer. Jolly Pumpkin seems to be the Russian River of the Upper Midwest. My JP virginity was popped with this beer. I am quite happy. After quaffing my 750ml bottle I could ramble on in some drunken rampage about the virtues of its drinkability but I will restrain myself. Every aspect of the palate fits me perfectly. It is malty good with Belgian spiciness and enough funk to keep George Clinton happy. Did JP brew this beer for me? Because this is exactly something IÂ’d create (if I homebrewed (and could brew something like this)). In summary: Yummy. Thank you very much RedHaze, this beer was splendid! Highly Recommended!"
"Nice even natural carbonation, very drinkable and nice. Although I love the new sour beer direction of Jolly Pumpkin, this brings back fond memories of their early days."
"D: Very sweet. I would recommend splitting this bottle with someone as an entire 750ml of this beer would become very cloying after a while."
"The first thing I notice upon sipping is a nice mellow mouthfeel. Real bright and spicy up front, which was sort of surprising after the smell. The taste also confirms the nose with an orange/spicy flavor. Dark fruit (plums or raisins perhaps) are also present. Not as much oak flavor as I would suspect from the nose. Very sweet up front, and sour towards the end. Toward the end it takes on a sour apple feel. Although I've not tried it, I bet a year of cellaring would make add to the complexity of the flavors. Not sure what you'd call this, not really an Abbey ale I don't thinkt, but a good take on a Belguim ""sour"" ale all in all. A good value at $9.45/ 750 ml bottle. Try it!"
"A very good beer but not one I want too often."
"Cloudy toffee colour with a short, light brown head. Some lacing, excellent retention. Pleasant aromas of malty toffee, nutmeg, and tart fruit. The flavour has a rich fruit character, with a bit of apple and sour cherry to add depth to the tartness. Toffee is also evident, as well as some bitter chocolate. Medium bodied, medium/high carbonation with a creamy texture. This is very drinkable and well balanced. Another winner from JP."
"Drinkability & Notes Â– The only thing standing in the way of me drinking this quickly is the high carbonation, other than that the light body and sourness makes this one rather refreshing for 7.5% abv. I wish it was a bit sweeter and a bit fuller, other than that its an interesting, well crafted beer to be sure. Not at all what I was expecting from this Â“Special Brown Ale Brewed with Cocoa Nibs and Spices,Â” more of a Flanders Oud Bruin than a Dubbel in my opinion, so thats what I'm treating it as."
"Beautiful, tight head. Cloudy, reddish-brown. Tart aroma yielding to leather, coriander, vanilla, cherry & toffee. Firm, soft structure from bottle condition. Malty flavor lingers on, demonstrating lightly roasted malt, spices, and dried fruit. Very long, wonderfully complex finish. Tremendous balance & restraint, beguiling complexity. Wonderful beer."
"Aroma is very spicy with some citrus and funky notes and a sweetish malt base beneath. Red tinted brown in color with a firm, thumb thick tan head. Fore is very spicy..almost hot with a rich and sweet..almost creamy..maltiness. Mild chocolate notes..stronger caramel notes and some citrus and winter beer like spices. Has a vinous quality that is more feel than flavor. The body has a very pleasing texture. Also has some toasty notes and some Baltic Porter raisin and plum notes. Just a ton going on flavor wise, but meanwhile the overall flavor doesnÂ’t strike me as a flavor bomb...itÂ’s mellow except for the finish which coats the tongue in the added cacao. It very much reminds me of a cross between StoneÂ’s VE 03 and 05. Ron has brewed up another beer that challenges the drinker."
"750 ml bottle. Pours a murky brown color, with a solid 2-3 fingers of head over top that really has staying power. Very dense foam. Clarity is okay, slightly hazt but light still makes it through. Carbonation is not apparent. Nose is very nice. Solid notes of brown sugar sweetness laced with some musty and sour to acetone sweet notes, with a healthy Belgian spiceyness to round it out. There is a lot going on, but nothing really dominates, letting the whole spectrum shine through. Flavor is very nice. Definately has the Jolly Pumpkin character that I am a fan of. Initial sip brings just the slightest pucker that moves to a full on sour tinge after swallowing. This is followed by a slight mustyness. The beer itself then starts to appear as a light brown sugar and light raisin with tons of spice that really lingers into the finish. I really like the interplay of the sour and funky start to the beer and the solid sweet and spicey finish. Its a very interesting dichotomy. Feel is moderate with a light carbonation of find bubbles. It does not have a whole lot to the body, and I could handle just a bit more, but its not bad. Drinkability is pretty good. I really enjoy letting a little time go between sips, as I think it lets the full range of flavors come through. This is an excellent brew. I liken it to a cross between a Dubbel and a flanders red and an oud brune."
"Rich burgundy. Low level, filmy head. Spicy, floral nose with an enormous barrel contribution giving a strong cocunut character, combined with a touch of rose petal, cinnamon, orange peel and light yeast. Flavor is full of fruit and spice. This seems to be a bit overly spiced, and the cocunut barrel aged notes really toned down throughout the session and it was very fitting initially. Fairly light in body as well. Still very unique and very tasty, and it demonstates the Jolly Pumpkin house character very well."
"This is quite the tasty tipple, it is a bit rich and satisfying, with lots of malt character to round things out. The balance that this beer has is what really sets this beer apart; all of the flavors just integrate so well, with none dominating over the other. The mix of funky Brett character, light tartness, sweet malt, fruit notes, and integrated spicing just works so well here."
"Pours a five+ finger light brown head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Deep red/amber color, ton of yeast in bottom of bottle. Strong carbonation and medium bodied. Alcohol and sour apple nose. Starts and finishes with a sour apple flavor, malts in the background. Alcohol is slightly noticeable, not your usual American brown. $8.20 for a 750ml bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"I really wanted to like this after I smelled it, but it's way out of balance and overall offensive. This will at least get me to try some more of Ron's beers."
"Drinkability: Average. I'd have another, but it is not at the top of my dubbel list."
"edit: gets much better as it warms and is given time to breathe. I think this is the best Jolly Pumpkin I've had after having drank more."
"This poured with a very nice, thick, deep-tan head that evidenced decent retention throughout. The color was deep brown with garnet highlights. The nose had a light brett-driven mustiness overlain with a chocolaty smell such as what hangs over Hershey, PA on a production day, only lighter in this beer. The mouthfeel was full and thick, bursting with effervescence. I got a cocoa-like flavor on the tongue and the same on the finish, but accompainied by brett in the latter. Man, I am in love with the Pumpkin!"
"Typical of Jolly Pumpkin in that they take a terrific style of beer and improve it. What would be a solid Belgian-style Brown Ale, became a balances sweet/tart, malty/vineous, woodsy/clean Sour Brown. Spicy and sweet from the right from the start, but quickly evolves into an under-rippened berry tartness, shrarply acidit and with dusty must with Flander's Red-like acetic sourness, toasty malt, and peppercorn bite. Lightly hopped for added bitterness and earthy grass notes. Amazingly holds onto a light toast (almost cocoa) flavor and firm creaminess despite the alcohol and modest astringency. Another true challenge for the tastebuds. An amazingly well crafted Sour Brown ale that draws inspiration from Belgium but made in America."
"Another winner from JP, am I underrating their beers? I still can't figure it out. I must get more and see!"
"This is the second offering from Jolly Pumpkin, I've tried, and I gotta say, it keeps gettin' better! Pours a dark amber color with a huge fluffy, tan head that fades quickly. Lots of delicate sticky lacing all around the glass, beautiful! Strong aromas of fruits and cider. This brew also has a sour, woody smell to it. Taste is great, fruity, sweet, sour and some tartness. There is alot going on in there. Finishes slightly dry. Full bodied brew with plenty of carbonation. Easy to drink, with the perfect amount of alcohol. Jolly Pumpkin continues to amaze me with their offerings! I'm so lucky to have this brewery so close to home. I must pay them a visit soon! Great job!!! Highly recommended!"
"Drinkability is good. Once again this brewer has produced an easily drinkable and interesting beer. Quite worthy of a try."
"Overall, another interesting artisan beer from Jolly Pumpkin. As I said above, I think the flavour is unique and depthy but too abrasive. That said, I like it when breweries try to nudge up against the line that is established norms, and I applaud this beer on those terms though I personally feel that they were off the mark on this one."
"Mouthfeel is good with a slight creaminess and smoothness from the laid back carbonation. Being not overly heavy it makes it quite easy to drink and each sip has me coming back for more. I think I could drink this damn near all day! Another winner from Capt. Spooky and JP. Easily one of my favorite Michigan breweries..check this out if given the opportunity! Kudos to marburg for the treat."
"Taste: The first Jolly pumkin ale I sampled didn't do it for me taste-wise, too boozy, this one was a lot better. It did have plenty of alcohol that started to get a little harsh towards the end, but the vanilla flavors, along with the roasted grain and candy sugar gave it a velvetty, almost buttery taste. The dry, wood-aged hard liquor finish reminded me of Marc de Bourgogne, the french equivalent of scotch (grapes used instead of barley)."
"Deep amber pour, topped by an off-white cover offering slight lacing. Intense spicy scents punctuate the candyish and cocoa induced, yeast cake. Interesting toasted malts come out in full sweet mode, combining with the yeast to offer banana esters and marzipan plus peachy flavours. Considerable alcohol shows through in mouth, in a rather vinous way. More toasted oak and chocolate character appear well distributed, but the pairing with the alcohol is a bit heavy at this point. Barky, rooty, could use a few months to mellow. Light-medium bodied, extremely soft and smooth, comfortable texture, typical of JP, though obviously thinned by the barrel sojourn. Highly diplomatic barrelling flavour disposition, acting as a soft, pillowy complement, perhaps adding a vanilla touch."
"Jolly Pumpkin scores a winner here. Totally quaffable brew. Poured out to a cloud brown color reminiscent to apple cidar. A small, thin layer of brownish cream foam covers the top of the glass. Aromas of fruit, sweet yeast, mild roasted malts and some pepper and spices. Nice. Taste is complex and nearly perfect; flavors of unsweetened caramel, malt, sweet yeast and bread, raisins and dark fruits swell in the mouth and blend wonderfully. Mouthfeel is smooth and mild, like a nut brown ale. Goes down very easy. Very good drinkability; this brew is a must have for windy fall nights or mild winter eves. Recommended."
"Drinkability...f'in great. I love this beer. Again, this is one of my favorite breweries out there. All hail Michigan!"
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a frothy 1 1/2"" light brown head over the very murky burgundy brew. Head lasts excellently, leaving super-heavy foam fully coating the sides of the glass. Aroma is spicy and fruity, with some woody notes lurking about. Taste pretty much follows the nose, with the oak and alcohol contributing to warmth at and after the swallow. Mouthfeel is especially creamy, and drinkability is nice as well. An interesting brew that deserves revisiting."
"Thank you to the brewery who have given a sample of this beer to my buddy!"
"Warm, cocoa, dates, fruit, wonderful nose. An American Belgian Style beer that is unique. A dubbel that is warm and fruity with exotic ingredients. I know this was made in the usa, but my tongue is telling me different. This quality craft brewed beer is another wonderful product from Jolly Pumpkin. Ron is my brew idol."
"from the bottle. poured a nicce copper brwon, with a light tan head. aroma cinnamon, raisins, orange, malts, fruity,. flavor, what a nice blend of flavors, I tgought this was a nicely balanced beer, I think this is my favorite Jolly Pumpkin so far, got malt raisins, some hops, orange peel,dark fruits."
"SlÃ inte!"
"jolly pumpkin seems to be a real one trick pony, but this is one of the times when that pony executes its trick perfectly. id like to see JP expand away from the wood (this dubbel would be good on its own) but ill take more maracaibo, for now, any chance i get."
"Malty & sweet. Subtle notes of chocolate, somewhat nutty. Touches of spicy cinnamon & fresh plums. Just a hint of orange with a dry finish. Medium bodied, moderate carbonation. Soft, smooth, & very enjoyable."
"This beer has tremendous potential; it's distinctive if a little unpolished. One of the best I've had all year though."
"Jolly Pumpkin beers are such a gem. I feel lucky to be able to get beer this good so close to home."
"From a 750ml bottle. Pours caramel in color and develops a large head that fills the glass. A whole hand's worth of head stays on top for minutes afterwards. Smell is sweet of caramel and chocolate. A slight grassy aroma. Taste is sweet with a high amount of alcohol flavor. Reminds me of some Unibroue products. Alcohol is numbing on the tongue. Like a burgundy wine. Tastes more like a wine or liquor than beer. A slight bit of bitterness that counteracts the sweetness. I don't detect much of the cacao nibs flavor in this. A fair amount of bourbon flavor perhaps from being aged in barrels. Once the bourbon flavor is discovered it becomes very noticeable. Bitterness seems to rise through the course of the glass. I wouldn't call this highly drinkable. I wouldn't expect to sip on more than one."
"This is a real treat. I could see myself taking down a couple 750s of this over the course of an evening. Complex, balanced, damn tasty and an abv that isn't so high you have to limit your enjoyment. Highly recommended."
"A fine, fine ale. Jolly Pumpkin will be the Midwests' Allagash. Thanx Tim!"
"EDIT: Wow, a few months later and this beer is already getting better, rounded with a larger and deeper malt presence with little spice interference."
"Jolly Pumpkin's dubbel influenced ale is another winner. There is quite a complexity of flavor, but a lightness of body. For a beer of 7.50%, there is little alcohol heat. It's quite drinkable. Don't drink it too cold, be patient and let it warm a little. Distribution is limited, so hit up your friends or drive to Dexter. It's worth the trip for me. Ron's a personable guy who brews some fine beer."
"Medium bodied and well carbonated, this goes down fairly easily, and the 7.5% is well-hidden. The dryness takes away a bit, I think. I've got one or two more of these for myself and will re-evaluate, of course: I love dry beverages in general, but this seems like it could use just a bit more malt sweetness. Another solid effort from JP though to be sure."
"((Thanks for the parcel, marb))"
