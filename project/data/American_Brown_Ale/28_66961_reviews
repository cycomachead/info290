"Overall - Although I stated I am not much of a fan of amber or brown beers, this is a really good example of the style. I am very impressed with this beers flavor, balance, and complexity. Overall a very solid brew, I think it is a bit underrated."

"This brown ale is fantastic. It's a very malt forward beer, but it has a smooth hop aftertaste."

"Anchor Steam dark.  Much more bitter than the beer Anchor is famous for.  Darker color, but same weight and mouthfeel."

"Wow, quite different from other brown ales I've had and very enjoyable. Single hopping with Citra really helps to set this beer apart. Pours a deep brown with a large tan head. Aroma is malt forward, sweet chocolate and some citrus fruit, which prepped me for big things on the palate. Toasty, nutty and chocolate tastes are there, typical things I expect from this style, but enhanced with the citrus fruit characteristics of those hops, has a bit of a zest or tang and some slight bitterness is noticeable. Overall I really enjoyed it. Maintains everything one wants from a good brown but that fruit character helps to make it unique among it's peers."

"Above average creamy soft carbonation, medium body, very drinkable."

"Overall:  This a good, very good brown ale.  Nice flavors of roasted malt and brown sugar, nicely blended with some pronounced, slightly bitter, but not out-of-balance, hoppy bitterness.  I like it!"

"This is malt perfection. Exactly what I look for in a brown ale-rich, malty, balanced with hop bitterness that cuts down on the sweetness, but is not the main presence. Don't even consider Newcastle, this is the way to go. I won't even pair it with food because it is so good I wouldn't want any other flavors to interfere with it."

"Color is garnet brown, clear but dark, with an initially large tab head. Aroma is sweet floral, fruity green apple, buttery dough, and abundant caramel toffee malt. Creamy malts, toasty, and nutty. Taste is fruity, bright, yeasty with some brisk hop over caramel, and some smoke/roastiness. Mouthfeel is thin feeling, very liquidy, and seemingly not dense enough to hold up all the flavors. Pretty juicy actually. Overall not bad. Easy to drink fast and interesting aromas and taste."

"Overall, I'm not a huge fan of brown ales, but this was one of the best I've had. It paired really well with my teriyaki pork tenderloin and sauteed greens-stuffed mochi."
"Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Very easy to drink. Has a bit of a nutty caramel and toasted malt aftertaste. Well worth trying."

"I am very disappointed by this beer as I am a big fan of Anchor Brewing. Glad I only bought a single bottle."

""
""
""
""
"Overall: not particularly memorable. But pleasant enough. Very drinkable, and pretty satisfying but not quite filling. Not sure if I'd rush to buy as a six pack but is a welcome componant of an anchor multi pack."
"7.99 a sixer"

"Overall a very good brown ale, an aged fruity flavor and lighter notes of toffee and chocolate."

"Comes with a dark brown color and a very small tan/dirty head. The aroma is sweet along with some maltiness. There is also some chocolate which is very gentle, but without the roasted aroma often accompanying it. Taste is bitter, roasted and bitter, although not so much so in the finish. The bitter aftertaste stays with you for a long time. All in all, a nice brew, not strong and very drinkable."
"Overall - A pretty standard but decent brown ale... worth a try..."
"I believe this is only available at one store in my town of around 30,00 people in the backwater of Butte, Montana. This particular fine food and beverage emporium charged about 10 dollars for a six pack, which is probably too much, considering browns of similar quality can be had for about 25 percent less- this beer is simply one with a sparser distribution, and appeals to those few of us who crave variety. In other words, I wish we had more variety and more competition, though it is getting better...."

"This one is nuanced, but not too ornate for a brew you'd have regularly. Almost too sweet, but the different facets make up for this. Solid."
""
""
""
"The feel is very easy with a slight watery taste. Love to see a more full robust feel as I think it would lend to a fuller taste."

"O - Very drinkable beer, but seems to miss the mark as a brown ale. I'm a big fan, and this is the first I've seen this beer in NE Florida. A bit of a letdown, and not my favorite from Anchor."
""
""

""

"A brown ale made with Citra hops? Why yes please, what a joyous experiment. Pours dark brown with ample mocha foam, much like a porter. Aroma is a juxtaposition of strong citrus/tropical fruit and dark malts. Amazing complexity in the form of citrus (orange, blood orange, lime), mango, passion fruit, papaya, peach, and brown bread, almond nougat, chocolate, coffee, and brown sugar from the malts. Some body and residual sweetness coupled with a dry bitter finish from the hops. Really quite an aggressive brown ale that captures the malt aspects of the style but obviously experimental in the hopping. I like it but maybe not every day."
""
"This pours a medium brown color with a slight, beige head. The aroma is very malty. The taste is very sweet from malts and burnt sugars. Also in the mix are molasses, caramel, and a slightly bitter finish. This is surprisingly very good yet a complex brown ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"OK, though nothing special. To be fair, I've never been particularly enamoured of brown ales. This one looks nice, with a lovely colour when held to the light. However the aroma and flavour, while malty, are quite bland and plagued by an undesirable harshness. Body is par for the course. It meets expectations, though the taste could be cleaner and fresher. Worth trying, but no need to seek it out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, even if this is almost two years old, this is still a good beer. I think the roasted malt flavors would be more rominent in a fresher beer, but this is an interesting flavor either way with the brown ale flavors as well as the hops bitterness."
"O: Solid. NIce aroma and taste; there is nothing wrong with this beer."
""
"O: I kind of like the idea of this beer: put Citra hops in a brown ale and see what happens. The problem is that it doesn't quite work. The hops fight and ultimately overpower the malt flavors here and this is difficult to miss, as this beer is so light, slick, and heavily carbonated. Probably one of the most turbulent brown ales I've ever had, I kind of think this one should be treated as a unique experimental brew and rated as such. In the end, I do not find Brekle's Brown to be bad at all, but I do not find it to be all that appealing either. I kind of don't know precisely how I feel about it. I suppose I can say that if you are a fan of the style, it's worth trying once, though I doubt this is the kind of brown ale fans of the style will reach for on a regular basis."
"O- A pretty nice brown ale with too much burnt malt character for this to get a higher score. Overall, a pretty complex and easy drinking brown ale."
""
""
"O- a nice smooth drinking Brown Ale. The 6 pack I bought went quickly!"
""
"This is decent quaff from one of the West Coast's pioneer craft brewers and one of America's greatest breweries."
"Not a bad beer this one. This one is pretty standard fair with quite a lot of fruits and sweetness with a nice mix of malts at the start. The mouthfeel and the soft carbonation of this one made it a clean, easy one to drink, although that being this one isn't anything special."
"Well, if Brekle likes it... This stuff pours a clear dark sienna topped by a finger of off-cream foam. The nose comprises toasted caramel (nearing burnt), light roasted malts, and a light kiss of what seems like orange peel. The taste brings in more of the same, with the orange, more present and powerful, doing battle with the even-toastier caramel, leading to a confused clash of flavors that doesn't sit all that well on the tongue. There's a sense of cedar in the background, as well, mucking things up even further. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slick-ish feel. Overall, the hopping of this brown just didn't do it for me, unfortunately."
""
""
"O: Perhaps a bit too sweet, considering the style, but Man, I loved it! It's like the love-child from a Doppelbock impregnating an ABA."

"O: A very drinkable 6% brown ale... Not the most robust one out there, but still tasty and different. Don't know if I'd seek it out - will probably stick with Anchor Steam! Still good, though."
"O: Enjoyable beer, goes good with the holidays."

"Overall this is a little more hoppier version of a brown. Not a bad interpretation of the style and would do again if available."

"12 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a brown/copper color with about an inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both good. The brew smells like caramel malt, nuts, apples and dark fruit. It tastes like caramel malt, nuts, citrusy hops (grapefruit), apples, dark fruit, and some molasses. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's creamy with moderate carbonation. I think this is a good brown ale, it's certainly worth a try and I know I'd buy this again."
"This is a malt centric beer. There is mostly malt in the nose and taste, very bready. It reminds me of when my dad used to brew beer and I would eat the malt... Carmelly sweetness. It has a decent finish with some slight bitterness. Very roasted flavoring. Pours a beautiful brown copper color though."
"O: definitely a treat for those who are connoisseurs of brown ales (such as myself)...wish I'd taken a crack at another.... I'll just keep an eye out around town"
""

"2.74/5.00"
"solid brown, perfect session beer."
"Pours a clear reddish brown color with a decent sized tan head that persists for a bit. The aroma is quite sweet with lots of darker sugars and light and dark fruits and a touch of alcohol. Little to no hop aroma. The flavor is sweet like the aroma promised, lots of caramel and brown sugar with apples and cherries being dominant and lending to a slight fruity tartness. Little to no hop flavor or bitterness evident. Medium body with a light to moderate level of carbonation and a sweet syrupy mouthfeel. Overly sweet and lacking that light chocolate aroma and flavor that I typically associate with a brown ale. I'm thinking one and done here."
""
""
""
""
"An easy drinking and approachable take on the style. Very bready with some deep sweetness. Lost a little as it warmed and just never really let up with the malt sweetness."

"Sourcing: Purchased at Spec's in Texas in March of 2013 for $7.99/six-pack."
"Notes: It's rather unique with it's hop forwardness there is some sweetness from the malts but it's still a drinkable beer. Cheers."
"The beer poured a wonderful dark cordovan with a tan head, that had orangish highlights. The aroma was a bit medicinal with some hints of sweet malt. The taste is rich and malty with hints of dark fruits. The feel is light and just on the dry side. I really enjoyed this beer, it's a good malty brew. Quite a treat with all the hops out there to get something that is just a strait beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I thoroughly enjoyed Brekle's Brown and will definitely be working it into my regular rotation. I've been digging pretty much everything I've tried from Anchor recently, and this was no exception. I think it's about time to book me a brewery tour..."
""
"O: Good drinkability. Refreshing. Anchor quality"
""
"Not the best brown ale ever, but a sturdy, serviceable example."
""
"Comes out of the bottle thick- tried agitating it to get some head, but none formed. Next comes a strong- sickly sweet candy smell. Sure enough cloying malty sweetness hits me hard. It feels as syrupy as it looked coming out of the bottle. This is my 3rd time drinking this, and once was as a blind test at my home brewer's meeting. All three times wound up with the same thoughts about cloying syrup. I am sad b/c I generally have great respect for Anchor's beers."
"O: Pretty likable, I must say. I'd reckon one bottle is enough for me; move up to two and it would become pretty cloying. Still, a solid example of a style I don't really care for."
""
"Overall- A bold and flavourful brown ale that can please many palates. Very well balanced and easy to enjoy."
""
""
""
""
"I have to credit Anchor for having the coolest labels. Fortunately, the beer is good as well."
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice chestnut brown color. Mild caramel sweet aroma. Toasted pecans. Smooth and slightly sweet flavor. Mild hazel nuts and pecans. Brown sugar and caramel. Perhaps a tad sweet but I like it. Just enough hop bite from the Citra in there. Decent mouthfeel-between the lingering nutty sweetness and hop bite it all falls into place. Have not had a regular decent brown this well done in ages. Anchor keeps it simple. Nice!"

"O - Not the idea of a brown I had in mind. Others may have a different experience."
""
"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a vibrant, rich, ruby-highlighted brown coloring with a thin, filmy ring of white head on the surface. Aromas of a malt bomb, with a dark sweetness leaning towards brown sugar and hazelnut, with a some dark fruit sweet highlights of fig and date. Flavors are rich and malty on a light, crisp body. The effervescence keeps all of the nutty sweet and candy flavors from being overpowering or cloying on the palate. Very tangy sweet aftertaste, with a woody and nutty blend that is carried off the tongue and out of the mouth rapidly by the smooth, thin body and carbonation. Clean, slick finish with only a slightly sweet linger. Very solid, easy drinking brew."
""
""
""
""
""
"Tasty brew that is on the bolder and tastier end of the style. A little sweet but has a bit of counteraction from the hops. Nice creamy body with kick of citrus."
""
""
""
""
"It's like a marriage of a brown ale and an IPA. Enjoyable."
""
""
""
"The malt and yeast character are classic Anchor, which I love. Very enjoyable and highly recommended."
""
"Overall: This is an interesting beer…the flavor stands out from other browns that I’ve had…it’s a candied flavor with tons of sugar and dark fruit sweetness…the citrus hops snuck up on me after a couple sips then lasted the longest on my palette…very unique in many ways…it’s worth trying and I do plan on buying another to cellar, but it’s not something I could drink more than one of in a sitting…maybe I’ll get one now and try it in a year or two to see what happens…the alcohol is high and I’m sure the sugars will only sweeten…(3.5/5)"
""
"Overall a good brown ale, a little roasted that reminds me of a porter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I only had one of these in a sitting but the alcohol was spot-on and didn't detract from the easygoing nature of this beer. While it wasn't on the level of Anchor's other offerings that I've had, this was a decent Brown Ale that was a slightly offbeat take on a style that tends to be pretty conservative. Certainly worth a go for anyone hooked on Anchor's hops and fullness."
""
""
"Overall: this is a decent beer, but it's flavor just grates on my palate a little bit. I like the creamy, fruity, sweet aroma and those components of the flavor, but there's also a sharpness that detracts a little bit for me. I could see myself having this again in a pinch, but it's not my favorite brown ale."
""
""
"A surprisingly odd flavored brown ale that doesn't conform to style. I have to say that this is the one brew from Anchor that I have not really enjoyed. Flavors just don't seem to go together at all. A bit of a let-down for me from a normally solid brewer. Just my opinion."
"The beer pours a stately brown color with a few centimeters of creamy foam above. The aroma is of deeply roasted malt, caramel and a component of dark bread. This ""browness"" continues on the palate with nutty malt and a slight tinge of fruity sweetness coated in brown sugar. An earthy bitterness rises toward the end. This is a well balanced and drinkable beer."
""
""
"Anchor makes good quality beers and this is a nice brown ale."
"A decent Brown Ale from Anchor Brewing. Interesting use of Citra hops here."
""
""
""
"The Brekle's Brown from Anchor is a very good brown ale...at least in my opinion. The beer pours a nice clear brown with creamy off-white head that is leaving a lace. The smell is bready with hints of malt and sweetness. The taste is a good balance of malt that gives a bread/biscuit flare which is quickly balance by finishing hops. The mouthfeel is medium in body with good carbonation. Overall this is a great beer."
"O- an enjoyable brew. These smell is awesome and i thought i was going to love it, but the citrus and acidic after taste just didn't do it for me. How rich the smell was, i was hoping for an equally rich and creamy mouthfeel, to no aval. A good session and i wouldn't mind sitting at a pub somewhere and drinking a couple of these."
""
""

"A very nicely done brown ale with sufficient hopping to place it solidly in the American Brown Ale category. Chestnut brown pour with a hint of ruby at the edge. Roasty caramel aroma. Up front a touch acidic, melding quickly into a slightly herbal hop bite. Sweetish caramel malt with restrained roasted notes follows and the finish hints at brown sugar."
""
""
"sweetness, and a hint of brown sugar. The flavor is dominated by that same brown sugar sweetness, almost one-noted unfortunately. This beer is malty sweet with a thin body—the light body saves it from being overly cloying. Brewed with Nelson Sauvin hops, although I really couldn’t tell."
""
""
"O: I really like this beer, the hoppy fruitiness goes very well with the malts, a very distinct beer and a nice take on the style. Why doesn't Anchor get more love? Recommended for anyone looking for something a little different."
""
"O. I'm not 100% sure I got a fresh brew, as it kinda tastes a bit skunked. But going on this beer, it's not what you would look for in a brown ale. Will try again to be sure in the future."
"O: A good brown ale, but I'm not sure the Citra hops were the best choice for this style."
"Unique for the style and worth a try."
""
"On tap at The Cannery Row. Totally brown coloured body with some bubbly head. Slight roast and malty aroma. Lacey. Opens fruity and then Licorice mid sip, a little nutty,fresh, balanced and decent drinkability. Toffee, some spice.Above average for style."
""
"Poured from bottle into pint glass. Nice deep brown, opaque pour with a generous 1+ finger tan head. Nose is of rich carmel, toasted oats, nuts and perhaps some molasses. Taste follows the nose with the nutty, oat front end that gives way to the citra hop for a pretty nice finish. Love the heavy carmel/nut/malts forward taste. Feel is pretty thick for an ABA. Silky on the tongue with decent carbonation. Overall- A really good, unique spin on the style. Really enjoyed the carmel/malt hit and the balance of the citra. A very easy sipping brown that at 6% ABV is hidden well. Not incredibly sessionable as it is on the thicker/heavier side, but one I will be hitting again in the near future. A pleasant surprise-"
""
"Overall (4.0): I like the simplicity of this beer. No adjuncts, and one hop variety used."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a decent beer.... OK at best, but not the best out of Anchor, and definitely not something I'd purchase again"
""
"O: This is a killer brown ale. The use of only citra hops and all-malt really showcases the great craftsmanship and experience of Anchor. This is a great beer for any time of the year, and worthy of a regular purchase. Well done, Anchor!"
""
"An easy beer to plow through, even if you don't like it. Goes down smooth. A far cry from Anchor's best products, but a worthwhile try."
""
"O: A hop heavy brown with clashing charachteristics. I was hoping for a bit more sweetness and cohesion. The combination of flavors are somewhat confused and lack harmony which is the hallmark of a great brew. I love that this brew takes a chance with the citra hop notes but overall needs a bit more work to attain greatness."
"Not really what I would consider a Brown Ale, but not a bad beer. Pours a reddish amber, good amount of head that lasted several minutes. Considerable lacing on the glass. Smells somewhat of malty sourdough with citrus tones. Initial taste was fairly bitter for a Brown Ale, very hoppy, but this quickly gave way to a malty taste with a bit of a metallic aftertaste. Lingers on the palate. Looks better than it tastes. I wanted a good Brown Ale, and I didn't get it with this one. I would have probably liked it more if it was more like I was expecting and in the mood for."
""
""
"O: Totally great brown. I'd buy 6 and order another. Thanks Anchor!"
"O - This beer is both special and limited becuase of how simple it is. If you like a malty brown ale this is a pretty solid choice. But that's really all it has to offer."
"It has a predominantly smell of aromatic hops. And it has a sweet biscuit taste from malt, with dark fruits and some nuts. All under a smoked base and plenty of hops. Another interesting brew from Anchor. Worth it a try."
"Overall, a decent brown ale and a solid brew from Anchor."
""
"Overall - The citra hops really makes Anchor's Brekle stand out in its class. Not the most sophisticated or even balanced Brown Ale, yet it still is remarkably drinkable and not too heavy on the palate. Although I still enjoyed this beer, I would not go out of my way to look for it again. Perhaps one day when I feel like reminding myself of this ale, I might pick another one up. Overall, a lighter-bodied brown without much character, aside from the great use of citra hops. But still a fun one to try!"
""
""
""
"O-A poor beer, I am disappointed in this one, was expecting a lot better from Anchor."
"This is an incredibly hoppy brown ale. The hops come through first followed by a typical brown ale maltiness. It's sweet and citrusy which is a bit odd for the style . It's complex and highly drinkable and ultimately enjoyable if not a bit strange and unique. It's worth a try."
""
"O: No beer have I tried in the last year has generated more ""back and forth"" activity than this one for me, but due to its low drinkability, I'll just say, ""Drink with an open mind."""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not a fan and an Anchor disappointment"
"High C+"
"Pours a nice cinnamon brown with some etched surface foam that is oat colored. Smells of toasted oats, some malt syrup, smacks cereal, and bit of cardboard. Smells sweet. Flavor is toasted and sweet oats, some cola, some bakin soda flavors. The body on this is surprisingly empty with carb and an off dry finish. I’m not impressed ewith this beer."
""
""
"Overall - This is a really, really good brown. Fairly bold. Good balance despite the citrus hop character being hidden at colder temp. I'm not big on browns, but I'd definitely buy this one again, several times over."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this just once again proves I do not like the flavor profile of dark malt and hops, dark beers should be malty, light ones should be hoppy. There is nothing that can change my taste preference on that so take this for what it's worth."
""
""
"Sweet malt nose under an unimpressive pour, albeit nice brown color. Taste is classically roasty nutty sweets malts (although not a bit tacky or cloying), but balanced with plenty of citra hop zing for great drinkability. I like it, as an IPA drinker who dislikes sticky sweet beers. Great for a brown afficionado on a summer day when quaffability is desired, in my estimation."
""
""
""
"O - The sweetness feels way out of balance, even with an aggressive lemon acidity."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a pretty easy drinking brown ale, for me. There isn't any real deviation from what you initially get. It stays fairly consistent and smooth, though a bit heavy on the malty sweet side. I can appreciate this one. A well done brew that isn't really trying to be too much."
"Mouthfeel is very light and smooth, almost crisp, with a medium body, mild carbonation and a slightly bitter finish. Decent enough beer and an average brown ale, but not a beer I’d be in a rush to buy again."
""
""
""
""
" Feels medium bodied and well balanced. Feel: 4/5 Nothing takes over as, thankfully, this isn't over-hopped (which tends to be the prevailing characteristic amongst American brown ales). Overall: 4/5"
"The Rest: A unique brown that's well worth a taste. The aroma and initial taste was very atypical, but then the finish brings it back to a more typical brown ale."
"Chipotle anything"
""
"O - a little more than just average for the style."
""
"never really been a fan of anchor steam but trying the nut brown ales today and gave it a shot. the others i had today were superior to this one, but it doesnt taste too bad."
""
""
""
""
""
"When all else fails, I always go back to anchor, just simple solid and delicious."
"Carbonated more like a porter, it's fitting though."
"O - rich without being heavy, well balanced, easy drinking, this is an easily sessionable brown ale"
""
""
""
"O: This is a solid, likeable, easy to drink beer. One the better brown ales."
"This is what a Brown Ale should be: not hugely complex, but flavorful and somewhat sessionable. It is dangerously drinkable at 6% ABV. Even as the ale warms, it maintains its refreshing character. Considering the three digit temperatures today, I considered drinking a wheat beer. I am glad I chose this one instead."
"Poured into a standard pint glass meium brown with amber hue, a thinner but well formed off white head atop.Aromas were fruity, with bitter chocolate,molasses,earthy,and lightly roasted nuttiness,alot going on for a brown ale.A little sharp in the feel if it smooths out it's really top notch.Flavors are mildly sweet upfront with some brown sugar and fruity tones,a big drying earthiness really takes over into a nice finish.I really like the flavor profile of this brown,it's American to the hilt with it's big earthy hopped up finish.Tweak the body and this is really top notch."
""
"O- I'd do it again."
"O:  I'm not a huge fan of brown ales but this was quite good. The malts worked well with the citrus hops to develop a balanced flavor. It's not something I will frequent but I'm glad I tried it. This is probably my favorite brown ale so far. "
"O- I quite like this beer and will definitely seek it out again in the future. It has a great blend of rich flavor, creamy yet easy to drink body in any environment, and I think it's a unique take on the Brown Ale style."
"Poured into a glass mug. Pours chocolate brown with a tall, light tan head. The head dissipates slowly, leaving some lacing on the side of the glass. The beer smells of dark roasted barley malt, caramel, and chocolate. It smells like a traditional brown ale. The beer is sweet and malty. There are flavors of chocolate and some hops to balance the malty sweetness. There's a mild citrus tang as well. The body is light to medium with adequate carbonation. The beer is creamy and smooth. The drinkability is very high. Overall, this is an excellent beer."
"The beer has some phenomenal flavors and complexities that sing the praises of the adopted brown ales. Supreme dryness, higher bitterness, and pronounced citrus flavors seem just a start."
"Pours a cola looking brown with a 3/4 thumbs width mocha head. A sweat, earthy aroma of brown sugar and cherries alongside a little soapy grass. Flavor is very interesting for a brown with the inclusion of the cherries alongside brown sugar, grass, and closing out with a touch of roastiness. A kinda thin, active mouthfeel. Overall, an enjoyable brew but not necessarily the most memorable or best brown ale. I'd happily drink this again but definitely glad I found this as a single rather than having had to buy a full sixer of it."
"Overall, a very citrusy example of the style. The hops sort of clash with the bitterness of the roast malt, though. A little more malt complexity in the flavor would improve the experience."
""

" The taste is pretty decent with some light tangy fruit from the yeast adding to the slight tea-like elements from the hops which have some spice and pine notes also. the malt is very good at keeping a solid foundation and is nice with some caramel and toasted tinges with subtle alcohol in the background. My takeaway on this is another solid offering from Anchor, one of the Nations elder statesmen of craft brewers-definitely worth having again."
"Brown murky mahogany red body, with a big thicket of deep tan head forming thick large bubbles flowing up from the depths of this dark brown libation. I smell a beautiful expressive hop profile with more citrus and earthiness than anything else. Complemented by candied malts with mild layers of roast, caramel, and nuttiness. Very faint tartness arises within the glass as well this is a balanced single hopped single malt brown ale. Super drinkable effortless, really. Pronounced nutty, dark chocolate, roasted malts with caramelized maltiness. Very good depth in the malt department with an earthy herbal hop note that lasts in cohesion with malts throughout each sip. Mouthfeel is velvet, silky smooth on the palate graces my palate with ample carbonation. Even flowing slick full malt profile sticks to the sides of palate with a lingering herbal dry finish, really perfect balance with little to no alcohol peaking through on the palate. Overall impressive brown quite possibly my favorite I've tried in a very long time, some people are scared of this style since it's hard to nail, but Anchor did just that out of the park fuckin' homerun!!!"

"Brown ale with a bite. Good beer."
"O - Well nothing surprised me about this beer. I liked the smell and the flavor profile, but I did feel that the cloying cocoa and brown sugar combo was a bit too much for me. I think the mouthfeel could be a little crisper as well. Overall I'd definitely drink it again, but I prefer other Brown Ales, like Moose Drool for example."
"Lively in the mouth but not as much as the appearance led me to believe. Solid brown ale, no fuss, balanced and very approachable."

"a very nice english/american hybrid brown ale. pours a thin light chocolate brown with a similarly thin off white head comprised of large bubbles. smells almost tart from the yeast, but tempered by some sweeter english malts and some fairly aggressive american hopping, which is exactly what you get in the flavor. love the malt complexity in here, its sweet and bitter and roasty at the same time. hops really only come out on the back end. feel is pretty good, a little thin for an american brown, but its a very very sessionable beer, and well made like all anchor brews. i will buy this again."
""
"Overall: The smell is disappointing but everything else is fantastic. A satisfying beer done the true Anchor way."
"Geez, almost great. Served a bit cold, with very nice, large, tan, foamy, frothy, thick, creamy head that slowly settles and plenty of lace. Color is a pretty, clear mahoganey with many tiny bubble trails. Aroma is banana up front, then malt, roast, toffee, fruit. Flavor's like nose and is fruity up front too; then there's the classic brown ale flavors. Oddly, sweetness is muted at first and comes in later finishing along with the bitter and tang. Body and carbonation are good. Finish is like flavor, ending to a not altogether pleasant bittersweet slow taper."

"This is a pretty nice job by Anchor to come up with traditional brown ale with just the right amount of flavor and touch of hops, yet still suitable to the style."

"O: I'm pretty underwhelmed by this beer. Looks, smells and feels great, but is definitely lacking in the flavor department. Not to say it's bad by any stretch, but compared to the other brews, I'm not overly impressed."
"I'll do this again with my second bottle soon. If nothing changes, I'll call this a decent beer that I'd be happy to drink if you served it to me but which I would bypass buying myself in favor of more interesting options."

"Pours dark, translucent burgundy in color with an ample, caramel-colored head. Aroma smells of fresh grapefruit and caramel; quite nice. The flavor matches the smell, but I fear the Citra hops may be overbearing. The caramel malt is still there, but it's well overshadowed by the citric flavors. I'd normally prefer these hops to most if they weren't so dominant, but the balance just isn't there. I'm also tasting a slight metallic twinge on the finish. Not at all what I was expecting from a brown ale. Maybe worth trying if you're looking for something different, but not a brew I'd seek out for pure enjoyment."
"Super toasty and medium roasty bread crust. Full on malt through and through. Chalky, powdery palate. Dry, but easy to drink."
""
"Fairly low in carbonation but very quenching. Some nice hopping up front before the heavy caramel and mocha flavors more or less takeover. Relatively balanced in finish and overall very easy to put down. A slightly sour brown ale with some character."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled 11/9/2011. Pours slightly hazy reddish brown color with a nice 1-2 finger dense khaki head with great retention that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Some slight spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of caramel, biscuit, molasses, toasted malt, herbal hop, pine, and light citrus. Some ok aromas, but there is some chemical-like off flavor noticeable. Taste of big caramel, biscuit, roasted nut, toasted malt, molasses, herbal hop, pine, and light citrus. Light bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, roasted nut, biscuit, citrus, and herbal on the finish for a short bit. Nice flavor balance with a good malt backbone. Medium carbonation and body; with a nice and fairly creamy mouthfeel. No alcohol warming noticed at all; very smooth to drink. Overall this is a fairly nice and enjoyable brown ale. Nice malt backbone as I like in brown ales; and very smooth to drink."
"O- I'm amazed how much I like this beer. Would buy again."

"Light-mid body, ample carbonation. Drinks easy, maybe just a tad watery. Would get again."

"A decent beer, the mineral character was a bit much for my liking."
"Overall: Normally this goes for $10 a six pack. Purchased this on sale for $8.50. This is a good, quality beer that I enjoyed and would readily purchase it again for $8.50, but $10 is a bit steep to make this a reagular purchase."
""
"The beer pours a medium brown color with a tan head. The aroma has a mix of toffee and some pine from the hops. The flavor has quite a bit of pine and resin from the hops, as well as some light bread and toffee. There is also some cream in the flavor, but what really stands out is the hop character. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."

"Overall I wasn't impressed with this beer and I thought it was a pretty middle of road Brown Ale that sure was unique, but I found that malts seemed to clash with the hops. This beer didn't have that good of drinkability, I drank one and wouldn't want to drink another, too sweet, and the flavor doesn't do it for me. What I liked most about this beer was the way it looked, the color and head were on point, if this beer drank as good as it looked it would be pretty good. What I liked least about this beer was the aroma and taste, I didn't care for them that much and I thought they could have had much more balance to them. I wouldn't buy this beer again since I didn't enjoy it and I don;t recommend it, there are tons of better browns on the market for the same price. I had high hopes for this beer but it for sure didn't live up to them, I thought that the malts were just way too sweet and not that flavorful and the hops didn't work well with this beer. I am going steer clear of this beer from now on, but I am still down to try more of their beers, but this one didn't to it for me, better luck next time."

"Deep ice-tea colored body with a small tan head. Aroma of malt, alcohol, earth, caramel, pit fruits and nuts. Medium-bodied with a creamy finish. Pungent nutty flavors with caramel, a touch of dryness and some light hop finish. Aftertaste is mostly about the malt and nuts here with some very mild earth and dryness throughout. Overall, a nice brown, but a little boozy when warmer."
"not what i was expecting at all.. i think my beer tastes depends on my mood... this was way to hoppy for a brown and fiished with a strong after taste... i didnt really enjoy drinking it... finished it pretty fast to get to the next beer of the night... if you like hops go for it!!"
""
"Overall: A very nice take on a brown ale. More hoppy than you would expect from a brown but still well balanced."
"Overall a decent brown ale, not the best but solid nonetheless."

"Overall: B+/A-"

"D ~ Citra in a Brown Ale? I'm there. It's a perfect combination. Supreme drinkability here. No heat, tastes great, & the price is very right. Please check this out."
"This is a good example of a brown beer. I would probably only put it second to the Smuttynose Brown Dog (my favorite brown)."
"A more than solid American Brown. The Citra hops are a great contrast to the silky, caramelly, nutty malt. Light fruit from the yeast finishes it off nicely. Again, the subtle tropical and resiny hop notes let you know this beer is All-American craft beer. One of the better and more surprising beers I've had lately, and it's nice to see Anchor step up and do something new."
"Pours perfect brown with a nice oatmeal colored head, however I was expecting a old brown ale malty taste, but a subtler mild malt flavor.  Citra hops for a brown ale, huh... Maybe not my first choice, but cheers for a good try."
"Balance is good though but oddly there's some detectable alcohol as well. Lots of toffee and roasted malt. A big robust and malty for such a smaller beer which makes sensesince it says ""all malt single hop"". Hops manages to balance the beer though making it not overly sweet. Caramel tootsie roll like after taste. Good but not something I can drink more than one of unfortunately. A malt masterpiece that just needs something more?"
"Overall – not a bad tasting brew at all, and decently interesting to think about while tasting."
""
""
""
"O: I think this is the best beer I have had from Anchor. it has many levels, and is nice. I would suggest it for a person who loves hops and has been turned off by the maltyness of other browns."
"O – Can’t think of a tastier American brown right off the bat. Glad I purchased this one as a typically do not lean towards Brown Ales."
""
"Overall: Starts off like a fun twist on the traditional brown ale but the taste just isn't there. A disappointment to me."
"O: This beer has excellent drinkability and can be considered sessionable because it isn’t very filling."
""
"The palate, though, is a little disappointing. Quite thin, there's flavors of toasted bread, caramel and a little toffee, but there's also a little bit of a grainy, cereal-like character that I don't care for. This does ease up, though, as you keep drinking it. While the hops aren't noticeable up front, there is a prominent hoppy bitterness, especially on the finish. Dry, grainy bitterness is also present, mildly husky and astringent. There is, however, some citrus, mildly juicy, to ease things up a bit. Light in body with moderate carbonation, this is decent on the palate. Ultimately, though, this beer isn't terribly enjoyable."
"What is it with this brewer and me? Things start off so well, in each instance, but quickly go to shit - the off-flavours always an acute surprise. Here, we have a nice hoppy brown ale, which turns unpleasantly into a phenolic mess all too soon. Sigh. 5 more bottles to pawn off."

"O: unusual, easy-drinking, and flavorful, with interesting and well-balanced flavors that change from the time this hits the tongue until the lingering aftertaste slowly fades away."
"I'm not upset I have a 6er of this stuff to drink, well concealed booze might slow down the process but I'm not very scared"
"O: One of the best brown ales I've had. The style doesn't lead to much complexity, but I could drink multiple bottles of this and not get bored."
"A ruby-ish brown beer, very clear, and deep. The head was thin, but it's appearance is enticing. The smell is a nice balance of roasted malt, with a background of hops (orange rind and flowers). The taste is really good: Balance, with a smooth malt sweetness. Roasted malt, but not burnt or overly done. Firm bitterness in the finish. Fruity and fresh. Medium in body and very smooth. This is a drinkable brown ale."

"I really dig Anchor beers, but my issue with this beer is the mouthfeel, it's just too thin for my liking. I expected more. Nevertheless, this is still a quaffable brown ale."
"This seems more English styled to me, that or I have an old bottle. Not a bad brown ale, but not upper crust by any means..."
"O: Solid malty flavor and layers of complexity with a boozy sweetness. A big drinking brown."
"O: I think this is a very tasty beer. It is easy to drink and has a nice amount of flavor. There isnt anything that blows me away, but still a nice, easy beer."
"Overall I thought this was a decent brown that is a bit different than many out there. However, it was really nothing to write home about. If I am looking for a cheap and widely available brown, I will still seek out some SN Tumbler, or some local offering."
"Not really very good."
"O: Not a terrible beer; it has some nice roasted notes, but it has an over powering boozy finish that hinders it's drinkability. I love Anchor Porter and Steam, but this is an average offering."
"3.5 D: Strange, but tasty beer that has a damn good mouthfeel."
"O- This beer has a big fizz that scrubs away a lot of the flavor and the malt is already a bit faint with some odd notes to it. The hops are a bit overpowering and heavy on the bitter side with an odd citrus note to them. This beer could use a bit of balance to it."
""
"O- Overall this is a good beer. Smooth beer and lots of malt flavor. Wish they brewed this one more."
"O- Brekle's Brown is a decent American Brown ale. I find it a little too bitter, but this qould easily fit the needs of anybody who likes browns or light-bodied American Porters as well. Could be a bit sweeter, and a little less bitter in my opinion."
"O: A very malty brown ale that has a big flavor. It is a bit on the sweet side, which some may not like."
"O/D-Not a fan of this beer. Two separate parts of the taste (the odd initial flavor, and the metallic flavor) are unappealing to me. Glad I only bought a single of this."
"I was exceedingly surprised by how good this beer is. It's unique, and doesn't taste like any other beer I can recall. Dark and brown ales are rarely my favorites, but this is one really, really good beer. Wow."
"Overall / Drinkability: An interesting brown ale. Strikes me as a beer to go with food rather than drink by itself as I enjoyed it more when I was drinking it with my meal (refried bean and rice burritos) but that is not to say I didn't enjoy it when I finished it off after the meal. It grew on me quite a bit by the end of the glass which tells me the drinkability is quite good, as I wanted another one when the glass was empty. Does have a bit of a window though of temperature for drinking though - too warm and the roasted malt flavor gets a bit acrid, too cold and it's too bitter. So just right, and indeed, it's just right. I think a good addition to the Anchor family of beers."
"O - This was a very interesting beer, and I really enjoyed picking it apart. The flavor is unconventional, but enjoyable. I can see myself drinking this again."
""
"The mouthfeel is pretty much on the light side of medium, with a strange sensation that beer feels warmer than it is once in your mouth. Hard to explain this and I've only experienced this a few times. Not sure what causes this. There's a slight tingle from the alcohol but no heat."
""
""
"O: Off the wall according to style. Use to English hops which give a mild characteristic compared to an intense citrus taste more accustom to pale ales. I love the change up and definitely an eye opener to Anchor Steam being not too familiar with their product offering."
""
"A decent American brown ale but I think I would have enjoyed it more with Cascades hops instead of the Citra."
""
"This beer pours a clear brownish red color. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes slowly into a small cap of foam. The aroma is of caramel, toffee, and citrusy hops. The taste is of caramel, and bright citric hops. It has a less depth than the aroma, but is still quite pleasant. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, and a smooth texture. Overall, this is a nice beer that I would drink again."
"A few days ago we were lucky enough to bring you a little bit of Anchor Brewing Company's history through their flagship brew, Anchor Steam. Today we will let Anchor bring out some more of their history, with an eye on the future as well. Anchor's Brekle's Brown ale is named after a German immigrant, Gottlieb Brekle, who opened a brewery in San Francisco that would 25 years later be named Anchor Brewing. In tribute to Brekle, this brew features a classic all-malt, single hop recipe (old) that makes use of a new hop variety, Citra (new). Brekle's Brown pours a reddish-brown with a frothy, off-white head that leaves a good deal of lacing. Slightly sweet malt rushes into the nose, with dark fruit, caramel, brown sugar, and trace hop notes lingering. Sweet malt is again in the foreground, this time well balanced by the new hop, hints of coffee and caramel come through on a sweet and lasting finish. The brew features a creamy light to medium body with good deal of carbonation. Nothing too fancy here, just an honest to style brown ale from a brewery that seems to be able to brew nothing but good beers."
"O: this one disappointed me I must say. Citra hopping did not show up in the end and there is a surprising amount of negative alcohol flavor for a beer listed at only 6%."
""
"Most likely a repeat buy. I'm a sucker for really well made beer, where the ingredients shine and the mouthfeel is perfect."
"I can honestly say this is the single best beer I've every had from Anchor Brewing! It's smooth yet flavorful, refreshing yet satisfying: I'm legitimately impressed! This is a brew that we'll definitely be adding to our selection as soon as our distributors make it available to us. If you've never tried the Brekle's Brown, I'd suggest stopping in for a try."
"Smooth and creamy mouthfeel medium bodied. Sometimes feels a little watery but it's clean with a lingering hop bitterness that offsets the sweetness of the malts. Unique."
"Taste is bitter citrus and pine up front followed by a good sting of carbonation which gives way to a slick malt backbone. It finishes dry with coffee and caramel notes. A very good and interesting ale, but it tastes a little watery in spots."
"This brew pours a deep brown with red highlights. Head is fairly small. Aroma is good, sweet malts and a bit of nuttiness. Big caramel aroma here. The taste is very good, this is quite the interesting brown ale. It might seem like it's going to be a cloying sugar bomb when it first hits your tongue, with huge amounts of caramel and sweet malts hitting the tongue. However, there's a fairly substantial amount of hoppiness (for the style, that is) that comes in the finish, along with a touch of roastiness that really helps to balance things out. The mouthfeel is perfectly substantial and well-carbed, and the drinkability is very good. Overall, yet another winner from Anchor. I find Anchor are really one of the most underrated breweries. They really don't do anything ""extreme," but I've never had anything less than a great beer from them."
""
"deep amber in color with a nice head. wonderful aroma and taste of roasted malt. for me not a great beer but a good beer none the less."
"O - Not the most exciting, but a pretty solid brown ale. I was watching the Prohibition documentary from Ken Burns recently, and all the still photos from the '20s and '30s with people holding dark beers in hand made me wonder what beers were like in America before the adjunct lager took over. While I know bocks were pretty popular back then, I couldn't help but feel like I was drinking a historical beverage while downing this one (minus the Citra hops, of course)."
"Overall, somewhat nice, somewhat a disappointment. I think Anchor could make a truly tremendous brown ale (the yeast is born for the job), but this isn't it. Scrap the Citra, dose up the brown and chocolate malts, and bring it again."
"Overall a nice beer, perfect touch of hop bitterness, nice brown malts, good stream lager flavors, soft with plenty of flavor and very drinkable."
"Brown ales in general are not my favorite, and I don't really enjoy this one either. As far as brown ales go, I don't think it's very good. I'd rather have Bells Best Brown, Moose Drool, or Goose Islands Winter mild, which are much much better."
"Really needs a whole lot more done to it. It's bland, in spite of the hints it displays of bold flavours."
"O- A unique take on the style. Although there are a lot of flavors, I feel that this is rather simple- which is not a bad thing. Nice for something different."
"Overall... pretty solid offering from Anchor. Tastes like a brown version of the classic anchor steam brew, which I've always been a big fan of."
""
"M: decent with a bit of metallic bite in finish that subdued over time"

"A malty brown ale made with Citra hops, a good beer as a one off but not one i'd select on a regular basis, having said that it goes down well and is worth checking out. Good but nothing earth shattering."

"Reddish brown color with a tan head. Clear as can be. Caramelized sugar with a hint of chocolate in the aroma. Not very strong but pleasant. Taste very similar to smell, awesome dark sugar flavors but not grossly sweet. Couldn't tell you what hops are in here, notable bitterness but not a very distinct hop flavor. Clean yeast, fairly neutral in taste. Smooth and drinkable, with a light acidity at the end of the sip. Not my favorite style of beer, but this beer is very impressive. Delicious and remarkably balance."
"A solid enough beer, and a well-made one. But while it has no obvious flaws or faults, it just not that damn exciting."

"Large cinammon-colored head leaves a shattered glass (windshield) lacing and sits atop a dark plum body. Head dissipates rather quickly and it appears filtered (no sediment). Has the typical Anchor dark ale smell (at least to me) of dutch chocolate, toffee and minty herbal-ness. Taste wise I'm getting a lot of phenolic flavors, which are not abnormal though is different for an American brown, and hay, though not miller light hay, I'm talking fresh, grassy hay. Also in the taste is German low sugar chocolate biscuits. Mouth is light and crisp and not heavy, like the label suggests. Overall an interesting American Brown and while this is still not nearly my favorite style, this one is a little more interesting than some, though more phenolic-like than any other."

"i think as far as the available Brown Ales go, this is a winner."
"Definitely worth a try and comes highly recommended to those who enjoy brown ales, especially those with a higher nutty profile."
"rich and almost chocolatey...certainly caramelly. hops are there enough to stave off the cloying. mouthfeel is well robust for a brown ale (an Amurrican one, no less), though i can't say i dislike it--the better to taste you with! that said, a BA should be quaffable and this might be too sweet for that"
"Overall: a very sessionable brown ale. Very simple but satisfying beer."

"O: Coming from somebody who doesn't particularly like malt-forward browns, I think this is a great alternative. Could be a real winner with some more balls, but interesting as is because of the earthy-herby thing."

"Poured a 3"" tan head with moderate last. Hazy umber brown color, but of course. Smell is sweet malt all the way. Taste is one of the sweeter browns I've had in the long time, creamy and satisfying, almost like an oatmeal stout with a lighter body. Taste is primarily malt, I don't really pick up the single hop. Decent."
"This is different than most brown ales that I've had, and I don't think I like it quite as much as the top ones I've imbibed. I really enjoyed the aroma, but the taste seemed like the component flavors were a bit disjointed from each other, and the mouthfeel is quite a bit drier at the end than other browns I've had. This is a good beer, but just not quite a top brown, in my opinion."
"Drinkabilty: This is a very drinkable brown ale to say the least, not only does it have great balance, the mouthfeel really sets the tone by being lighter then your usual brown ale, making this alot easier to quaff then other beers in the bunch. I do wish this beer was a tad bit more chewier in the mouthfeel to really make it a beer you'd enjoy in the colder months, but I can't take away points seeing as this beer would stand up nicely year round which is great. Overall a very nice offering from one of the original craft breweries."
""

"Aroma has strong fruity, floral, caramel, horehound and hoppy notes. It pours a clear mahogany with a fairly thick and fluffy pale tan head that leaves some decent lacing. Flavor has a nice mixture of caramel, fruit, malt and herbs, rather lip-smacking. Smooth, firm-bodied texture has some fizz and leaves a fruity, malty, slightly hoppy, slightly syrupy and slightly floral finish. Recommended!"
"I liked this, as that character from those Citra hops (mainly that juicy fruit and herbal flavors) really played nicely off the sweetness and roasted qualities that that base Brown Ale brought to the table. This was a unique take on an American Brown and I really enjoyed it."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is a nice beer to drink for a while if you’re in the mood for the style."
"O: I really wanted to like this beer, but I really don't. The hops would be nice in a pale ale, and the malt would be great with different (but equally prominent) hopping, maybe something piney or earthy."
"Pleasant fruitiness, dry and lightly bitter finish, fairly subtle flavors. Some toastiness lingers, and bitter grapefruit rind also. Soft carbonation, medium bodied but it drinks fairly light. Citra hops don't seem to dominate, and compliment the brown ale base with a nice fruity element. Easy to finish the 22 oz. bottle."
"Overall: Not well balanced, at all; chalk up the combination of the citra hops in a brown ale as an interesting idea that probably shouldn't be tried again"
"A good beer, worth picking up off the shelf. Just don't expect an out-of-body experience."
"o: Very good brown ale bordering on a new-fangled black IPA."
"D-Very nice, easy drinking, and sessionable beer. Would love to have this one again."
"Hmmm. I really wanted to like this beer, but although I like the idea of it and some of the elements are nice, I think that something is a little off kilter here. Primarily, the use of Citra hops here in a brown ale doesn't really work for me. The hops add a note of zingy citric sourness to the roasty, malty notes of the ale, and so are evocative of the grainy sourness you sometimes get in a brown ale. Not the flavor I'm looking for. In a hoppy brown ale, I much more appreciate herbal or pine notes that play up the roasty notes rather than work at cross purposes to them. The beer does have a nice color to it, a toasty, reddish brown, but the head fades relatively quickly. Quite citrusy in the nose, with a pleasant sweetness and hint of roast. If the taste more closely emulated the aroma, I'd be sold. A shame, because the body is solid as well. An interesting experiment, but I'd try it again with another hop profile."
"Overall, this is one of the more style appropriate American Brown Ales you will find. I think I paid $4.50 for this, so it is one of the best values you'll find in the 22oz category."
"Decent bitter American brown, but there wasn't much nuttiness/depth in the roast."
"D - Interesting beer. Makes me think this is how beer used to be made and tasted."
"O: This is one of the better Brown Ales that I have had. Not overly complex, but with nice flavor."
"No specific flavours or aromas, fruits or really anything"
"O- Meh. Not worth the price- an enjoyable brown but not worth the price."
"One comparison that came to mind was the Sierra Nevada Porter. Both beers seem to share that distinct herbal / Belgian yeast quality and roasted malt character."
"Overall: While definitely not the boldest brown on the block, it's fairly refreshing and pleasant enough, though a notch less alcohol would be appreciated. Still pretty good, though."
"Why pitch the Citra if it's not going to show up? Earth takes over from sugary start to make a nice enough brown ale with some complexity. But doesn't hang together somehow."
"Overall, not bad, but not great. Off balance, but not past the tipping point. Hit and miss. Not something I'd chase but while it exists on the market, nothing I'd refuse."
"Great brewing!"
"Taste is juicy, citrusy but with rich toastiness, hint of wine, great balance and nice complexity, toasty, nutty character with hint of grapefruit but not too much. It is excellent and very drinkable. I had it on the warmer side, cellar temp."
"Pours a deep hazy brown with a huge, dense fluffy tanh head that lasts and lasts. The aroma is sweet and sticky, with brown sugar and molasses and a little hop on the end. The flavor is very brown - bread, molasses, caramel, and brown sugar, all the things you'd expect from something brown. There is a nutty malt in the middle and a bitter bite like brown rum on the finish. There is a lingering burn that emphasizes the blackstap rum effect."
"O: at $4.59 a bottle, a fine brown with a warming sensation. If you like the anchor steam stuff, this is up your ally."
"O: it is good, somewhat one dimensional but there is a little depth. I think as much as I don't like my local brown I like it better than this."
"Meh, not sure what the point of throwing citra hops in a brown ale. They just don't work here."
"O: 7/10. a very good brown ale. malty and rich but not overpowering."
"Overall: Reminds me of a bad homebrew, not particularly professional tasting. Way too much sweetness for the style with nothing to balance it out."
"overall:It was ok I had a lot of Malt taste almost no Hops it did not taste like a brown beer to me.this would be a good light beer to drink ain the day time relaxing"
"O: I got really excited when I saw that they bottled this. I’ve had a taste of it at a beerfest and regret not being able to review it as I love all things Anchor. It’s a solid brown ale, and I would not be sad if I had to drink this again."
"O- I owed it to Anchor to buy at least one of these considering it was Anchor's Porter that got me into the craft beer scene. That being said, I didn't quite love this beer as much as I would have liked to. It's refreshing and enjoyable, but I'm not going to be seeking this out like I once did with Anchor Porter."
"Clear garnet colour with a short cap of fine tan/brown foam. Lots of lacing, good head retention. Notes of caramel and toasted wheat bread with mild grain character in the aroma, light grassy/citrusy hops, slight apple fruitiness. Much the same in the flavour, but with herbal bitterness and more fruit. Breadiness was scaled back, but it still had considerable sweetness. Medium bodied with relatively soft carbonation and a hint of husky astringency. Overall, a decent offering with characteristics that are a little out of the ordinary for a brown ale."
"From notes. Sampled during SF Beer Week 2011. Pours a nice, hearty brown with a nice light beige head. The aroma is citric hops, caramel, nuts, a touch of tin and mild roasty fruitiness. For me, the hops are pushed too much in the aroma and taste. It's also a bit dry for a brown ale. More caramel and fruit in the taste. Mouthfeel is a bit thin. It's a good beer and a somewhat interesting take on the style, but I would have preferred to see Anchor go a different direction for both a brown ale and a new beer. I just like brown ales that are easier to drink with less (clashing) complexity."
"M: Yes, it felt like a slight electrical current running through my mouth on the finish with the mix of hops, alcohol, and heavy carbonation. Also, I think I had this beer at just the right cold temperature. Feels very smooth if you let it sit in the mouth for a fe seconds and foam up."
"O: For a take on a traditional brown it's spot on. It' a great session beer and seems to have versatile food pairings. The style will never impress me like an imperial stout or barrel aged sour, but what are you gonna do."
"I keep hoping Anchor will use their pedigree and expertise to make some actually interesting beers. This one seems like a step in the right direction, after the unpleasant bock, small beer, and grainy over-spiced Christmas ales. This is what makes beer good, a surprise that keeps you tasting."
"Overall a mild and tasty ale."
"The taste is more sweet than the smell suggests. But the hop provides plenty of counter-balance. There are elements of a low alcohol barley wine, but it is also like caramelized pale ale. Good body with a high carbonation level."
"Pours reddish brown with fluffy off-white head. Caramel, brown sugar, toffee, toasted grains in the nose. A bit on the sweet side. Caramel, toasted grains, citrus and rind comes through as well. Medium bodied with light carbonation. A tasty session that is crisp and a hoppy brown. Balanced and clean."
"I have to say I liked it overall. Nothing special, just an easy drinking brown ale. The Citra hop works nicely. Would rather it be in 6-packs than a big bottle just for price sake though. Recommended."
"Flavor is good and slightly enticing. Bit of roast, touch of carob and some dark cherry in the background. Flavors linger moderately, softening a bit over time to offer a touch of sweet dark chocolate. Feel is smooth and offers a touch of dark chocolate in a spice sense. Light to medium in body and easy drinking as a result, sweetish but not too viscous. Been a while, but this comes across as a somewhat subdued version of their Porter....will have to check back on that..."
"Pours a moderate brown color with a good off-white head and a bit of lacing on the way down. The nose carries a bit of caramel and toasted grain plus some mild roast. Faint hoppiness is there as well. Nice blend. The flavor has a bit too much roast and hop, coming together to create a strange bitterness that really affects the taste and feel. Medium body with average carbonation. All the components of this one didn't really come together for me, though I did enjoy the nose."
"Pours a clear dark brown with a 2 inch tan head that fades to a thin cap. Random streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smells of brown malt, light fruits, and some wood aromas. Taste is of caramel malt and fruit like apples or grapes. There is a woody zing flavor that I am getting as well. Some nuttiness is present too. This beer has a low level of carbonation with a smooth and slightly flat mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good brown ale from Anchor but nothing amazing. I am glad I got to try this one after I read it was going to be bottled."
"Though it got a little fruity for me at the end, Brekles is a damn fine brown and a great addition to Anchor’s legacy of solid brews that stick to style standards. It’ll be great for the cooler fall weather."
"Mild taste, smooth, sweet but not overly, enough substance to it to ride it out. No hops. Could make an Oktoberfest fan happy I bet. A little toffee in the mouthfeel, seemed par for course. Might pick up a 6 of it if I ever see it bottled, simply because its a nice agreeable beer to have around when people come over to the house empty handed."
"Beer is medium in body and surprisingly bitter. It is sweet with a nutty midpalate flavor and an overall pleasant feeling. It is not super easy to drink. There is a lot of beer in here and it gets a little rough throughout. I didn't dislike it but I don't think I""ll have it again."
"Overall, a decent brown that shouldn't offend, but doesn't offer anything new."
"(22oz bottle from Total Wine Desert Ridge). Pours a clear dark brown--red color with a creamy tan head. Carbonation is almost like seltzer water. Aroma is very interesting: I’m getting some light caramel and cocoa, but also something like a peach jolly rancher. I like the smell, but its a bit weird. Taste is sweet malt, but not cloying at all. That peach is in the aftertaste. Thin bodied with slick texture. I’m not sure what to make of this beer. I don’t know too much about the Citra hop so I just looked up some info and the resources I saw mentioned a fruity aroma like melon, papaya or mango. Well, this is an interesting beer and one that might grow on me more or turn me off completely. Definitely worth a revisit."
"Not bad."
"Drink- Too far away from what i was hoping. Probably wont come back to this one."
"Overall: I don't drink many brown ales, but this was definitely a plesant surprise. Will never be mistaken for Newcastle."

"Brekle's Brown Ale is a fine addition to their brew portfolio that includes the legendary Anchor Steam beer, a sublime Porter, and my personal favorite: Liberty Ale."
"O: Seems so strange. I love Anchor's beers but this was just awful. I'd be willing to give a bottle a shot, but Beachwood is a top bar, so I don't think it's any fault of theirs. Gave my glass to a couple other people to make sure I wasn't imagining things and consensus was that this beer tasted terrible."
"O: A real nice new effort from Anchor. Solid drinking beer, not much more to say."
"This is a lightweight brown. Flavors are pleasant. I could probably drink a few. I'm glad I rode my bike."
"Draft at Zeitgeist. Clear amber-brown body topped by a fleeting white cap. Lot of fruitiness on the nose, dates and stonefruit, bit of raisin and brown sugar, mild toasted malt. Very estery for a brown ale. The palate is more toasty, but still heavy on raisin and date flavors. Body is a bit thin. Finishes with toasted malt, a mild bite of herbal hops and licorice. Leaves a lingering earthy, slightly vegetal note. Pretty good and easy to drink, but nothing terribly special."
