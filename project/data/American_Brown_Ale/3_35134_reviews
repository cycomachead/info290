"O - Nothing remarkable; the best part are the smells when drinking, everything else is simply average; I didn't get the pecan nut flavors that I was expecting, which was a bit of a let down"
""
""
"I was a nervous excited to try this, knowing I don't love pecan flavored things, but that this couldn't possibly taste like only  pecans, and I was relieved to see that it didn't. There's enough of a hint to know it's a strange brew of sorts, but plenty of your typical beer ingredients to remind you this is just a fun experiment that you'd want to drink again."

"2.73/5: Why is it that every beer brewed with nuts taste so artificial???"
"Just south of Okay.  Kinda thin and watery and ""green"" tasting this year.  Lazy Magnolia Southern Pecan is way tastier."

"I would not seek this one out and purchase again. Would drink again if available though, just would not go out of my way for. There are better options."

"Pours a very appetizing amber color with a cream head. The smell is sweet and earthy with almost a bit of salt on the end. The taste was a bit more subdued with some malt and hop flavor coming through, but not nearly as much pecan as I expected. It was nice but I just wanted more earthy nut flavors to make this beer really stand out."

"Copper. Bready nose and the flavor follows the nose with the addition of some nutty notes.  Not getting a distinct pecan flavor, however.  Looks like a bitter, tastes like a brown."
"Pours a brilliant clear orange with a thin layer of white head that lingers and leaves nice lacing. The smell has a nice presence of pecans. I'm actually surprised at how well the essence of pecans are contained in the aroma. Not much else comes through on the nose. The taste unfortunately does not feature the nice nutty nose the nose has. Instead, I get a bland and fizzy flavorless liquid. Almost adjunct lager flavorless. This is disappointing as the nose is quite promising. Up front I get watered down malt, this is followed by a tinge of nuttiness and a hint of sweetness. No hops to speak of. Mouthfeel is light and fizzy. Overall this is a let down."

"This beer surprised me.  I was fearing it'd be some overly-flavored concoction, kinda like many flavored coffees.  It wasn't.  As another reviewer noted, I didn't detect much, if any, nuttiness in it.  But it poured in a manner my unsophisticated self doesn't have words for; a fantastic, solid-cloudy color I don't know what to call.  Decent ""ale"" flavor; not too overboard, but not washed out like some seem.  Definitely drinkable and refreshing.  Maybe it benefits from my very low expectations for it, but I liked it well enough to rate it higher than most.  Won't seek it out, but would chose it over some other stuff if given choices."

"This beer is not spectacular. Its kind of a one note wonder. I don't really get a lot of the pecan in there. I detected maybe some nuttiness to it, but it was thick and sweet and that is about all you get. Its a nice looking beer. Has a good aroma of caramel, the slightest amount of nuttiness, I assume that is the pecans. It had a lot of head that really never tamed down. I was interested in trying this one. I have seen it for years, but its not one I would drink regularly. Its too sweet for my taste. If you like your beers to taste like a stuckey's pecan roll, then go for it!"

"O: Easy to drink and definitely a beer than reminds me of fall - it is a little on the lighter side of what I would prefer (slightly fuller body and just a touch more pecan flavor) but I can see it having wider appeal because of that... Not bad but just not too exciting."
""
""
""
""
"little to no pecan flavor when tasting. disappointing"
"a  brown ale the doesnt taste like a brown ale  or look like a brown ale i wanted this to be wonderful but its just plain nothing to write home about"
"Very light weight for a harvest ale."

"Overall:  This is a pretty good beer.  Great aroma, but not as good in flavor.  Good malt presence, but a bit too much hops bitterness for me to really like.  Worth a try once though for malt fans and I’m sure that hop heads will like this beer."

"This beer is a great example of what a pecan flavored brown ale should taste like. The smell and taste is of smoky, roasted walnuts with a nice malty backbone. It's not overly sweet but is well balanced and flavorful. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Nice, clean finish. Overall a great fall beer option; glad I gave it a shot."

"This is by far the best fall seasonal beer that I've ever had. It's a cross between a Nut brown ale and an Oktober fest. When I first saw it in the store I wasn't sure that it would be good brewed with Pecans but this is a very tasty brew. I just hope that start to make it year round."
""
""
"Taste/feel: Quite a lot like the smell. I read some things about this beer before having it, and it's what I expected almost exactly. The pecan and caramel is there from beginning to end, and that's it. There's no other dimension of flavor. There's not much of a bitterness. It's not bad by any means, but it's very, VERY one-note. Carbonation is quite high, and the feel is pretty low. I don't love it, but this is actually a very solid, sessionable brew. If you're looking for something to send your taste buds on a ride, this may not be it, but it's still a decent beer."

"Overall I thought this was a good beer and a pretty good example of the style, the pecans showed up nicely and they worked well with the malt base. This beer had good drinkability, it was very smooth, not filling and the taste did a good job at holding my attention, I wouldn't have a problem drinking a couple of these. What I liked the most about this beer was how true to it's name it was, it was just as advertised. What I liked the least about this beer was the mouthfeeel, I thought it was a little thin and watery. I would buy this beer again as a nice fall time beer and it was priced nicely. I would recommend this to anyone who likes nutty beers. All in all I enjoyed this beer and I think it's one of the better Abita beers that I have tried so far. This is a pretty nice fall time beer, good job guys."

"O: Overall I feel that this is a fantastic beer. I highly recommend it. I will be looking for this beer again. My favorite part of this beer, is that it has a light nutty flavor without being artificial tasting or over the top like pecan pie. It really does taste like a pecan bread. I wouldn't say it's a perfect beer but it is outstanding."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A respectable, brown, just not one I'd buy again, much like most Abita products"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall –The body and flavors are a bit weak which takes the brew down a step or two, but it does have decent (but very light) flavor with some nuttiness. An alright brew but nothing special."
""
""
""
"With notes of caramel and pecans this beer does not disappoint. As I drink it I imagine the pecans being added in the brewing process as I taste them. This is a great beer that will have your mouth wanting another. Abita has hit the nail on the head with this beer and I wish they sold it here in Wilson, NC."

"This beer did not disappoint, but it also did not exceed my expectations. It was easy to drink and had a clean finish. I would definitely drink it again and would have liked to try it on tap. Overall, I would recommend it to others wanting something different, but Abita does have better options."

"Based on the aroma, I thought this one was gonna turn out better, but the flavor was just so vapid and mind-numbingly underwhelming. The sad thing is, the flavors were/are actually pretty decent, but they unfortunately become an afterthought to the watered-down nature of this American Brown Ale. Started solid, finished mediocre."
"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 1/22/2013. Pours fairly hazy orange amber color with a 1-2 finger dense cream colored head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of caramel, biscuit, toffee, toast, brown sugar, nuttiness, floral, and light fruitiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of malt notes. Taste of caramel, biscuit, toast, toffee, brown sugar, nuttiness, floral, and light fruitiness. Lingering notes of caramel, biscuit, toast, toffee, nuttiness, and floral on the finish for a bit. Nice and well balanced malt and nutty flavors; a little mild on flavor, but very pleasant; with no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a slightly creamy and very smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a good amber ale. Nice balance of flavors and very smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"Poured this American Brown Ale from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. This ale poured a brown/red color. The pour produced a small tan head, retention was poor and produced only a light amount of lace. The aroma consisted of roasted malts and caramel. Light in body, there was a foundation of roasted malt and nuttiness. Overall, this is very average."
""
""
""
"One of Abita better tasting brews."
""
"O: Readily recommended as a budget nut ale. Excellent with guacamole and should be great with cheese."
""
""
"This beer pours up a gorgeous beautiful crystal clear copper with one finger of off white head, not much retention, and a moderate amount of lacing. Smell is fairly strong but one dmensional. I mostly detect notes of pine. Taste is an initial small amount of sweet malt, follwed by a bigger amount of pecan flavor. Mouthfeel is average with a mild but not unpleasant aftertaste. Pass on this one unless it is FREE!!"
"Overall: Slightly dissapointed by this one, been looking for it for a while. Not bad, just won't be buying this one again."
""
""
""
"Light bodied with below average carbonation. Simply not a good beer. I will avoid this in the future."

"O- a decent seasonal, sweet and malty, but I found myself looking for more pecans. They were there, but just a trace."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a disappointment. It intrigued me enough to buy it, with hopes of a nutty and/or sweet ping to it. Neither was there. A good beer for summer, maybe, easy drinking, but not much to it."
""
""
""
"Overall - I was hoping for a more assertive brew, but with Abita I should have known better. The flavor that's there isn't half bad, but it feels like half a flavor. Won't buy again; there are plenty of better browns with more to offer."
"i dont care what anyone says, i like this beer. not too many brewers use straight up nuts that i am aware of, and this beer features the pecan pretty well. the pours is that of an english brown ale, caramel brown, not too dark, with a foamy off white head an inch or so tall. the nose is real woody, not like oak, but like a two by four. really. some sweeter malts with a good toast on them as well as a touch of sweetness also add to the aroma. flavor matches well with the smell, its really dense and woody tasting, with the nuts obviously contributing more meat than sweet here. a little sugary in the finish, but hardly offensive. the mouthfeel works, bigger body but it remains pretty easy drinking with its vibrant carbonation and smooth finish. i put a 6er of these down pretty quick, and recommend this beer to anyone who is up for something a little different."

"O- Kind of reminds me of Turbodog light. Easy to drink but not enjoyable unless in a party setting where the flavor of the drink takes a backseat to the social aspect."
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Pours a clear amber color with a large white head. Color really reminds me of roasted pecans and fall. Aroma is fairly mild, there's a slight nutty and malty sweetness to it, as well as a slight earthy note. Taste was pretty mild as well, earthy with a little roasted character. I think maybe I get a little nutty pecan flavor, maybe I'm just imagining it. Fairly highly carbonated and a medium body. It's a pleasant, easy drinking beer. Mouthfeel is rather oily, it feels like my mouth is being coated in oil with every sip, not very pleasant. Overall I was really disappointed with this beer, it looked so promising from the poor, but it just went downhill from there. Nothing spectacular about this one, and the oily characteristics just don't work for me. I won't be having this beer again."
"I decided to try this because I like Turbodog and Southern Pecan. Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. All around, this beer is pretty mild. In the nose, I get a slight hint of a sweet caramel flavor and a hint of the nuts. In the flavor, I think it is basically a less complex and milder form of Turbodog (though similar) , but I get a little more from the nut flavor. It also pours a lot lighter color (light brown) than most brown ales (especially English brown ales like Turbodog) but is very drinkable. This beer still has a lot of flavor though and it is definitely worth a try, and I would say it is a good example of the style."
""
"Not a whole lot to this beer. The scent of pecan is there and there are flashes of it in the taste, but that really is about all. The beer does look nice however, pouring a golden orange with a nice head, but as far as the other components I was disappointing. It really is too bad because the pecan flavor itself does taste nice and fresh but it needs to be paired with something to make this beer shine. Whether it be cinnamon, chocolate, or roasted malts anything would have really enhanced the flavoring but this was not the case."
"Poured into a pint glass. Pours amber with an off-white head. The beer appears to be well-carbonated. The head retains very well. Some lacing is left on the side of the glass during consumption. The pecan aroma comes through in the smell, adding a complementary subtle nuttiness to the sweet and bready malts. There's an earthy aroma present as well, which is a product of the Willamette hops. The flavor is of nutty pecan with the roasted malts up front. There's some mild sweetness in there from the caramel malt and some back end hop bitterness. The hops bring some of those earthy flavors I picked up in the nose. The body is light to medium with strong carbonation. The beer is smooth with high drinkability. This is an excellent beer."
""
""
""
"This beer is a honey-amber colored, clear liquid. The head is modest but leaves an enticing lace. It's aroma is enticing....nutty, sweet, slightly malty....a little toasted bread. Some caramel and honey. The flavor is balanced, but not really dovetailed with the smell. A little oily, some pale and toasted malt taste. Not really sweet, but no serious bitterness either. Nut flavor is present, especially in the hind-taste. Medium, trending light, in body. It could be more full in flavor and mouthfeel. Still, I imagine that this is a difficult beer to craft, and it is nonetheless very well done."
"RJT"
"O: Could have been nuttier and more complex, but this was overall very tasty and drinkable, and I think it would pair well with a bunch of foods and baked goods that I like: smoked meats, maple foods, pancakes/breakfast foods, shoofly pie. Not a bad breakfast beer."
""
""
""
""
"O: I wasn't expecting a lot from this beer given the average scores, but I am a fan of brewing brown ales with nuts so I gave it a shot. However, Abita really needed to step up the malt bill and nut profile on this beer. I will have great nut brown someday, but not this day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A very good, sessionable pecan ale. This beer gets a bad rap for some reason I cannot identify. I'd drink it by the liter. In fact, I think I will."
""
"Overall- Pretty good and easy to drink. I would like a little more pecan flavor other than just a nutty taste. I think with a little tweaking this would be a great beer."
""
""
""
"Overall this was good and worth a try. Wouldn't get just for pecan flavor, but good for what it is."
"-Overall 3.0: Just OK. Nothing spectacular. I honestly did not taste anything that reminded me of pecans. I think that if the brewmasters at Abita tinkered with this one a bit, say by letting it age in bourbon barrels or some such, they would really have a winner on their hands. As it is, this brew is not greater than the sum of its parts."
"O: A disappointment. Lacking in flavor and complexity. Should be so much more."
""
""
""
""
"This is a smooth, sessionable beer with a decent flavor profile. It's nutty and malty without being too much. It's worth a try."
""
""
""
""
"The brew poured with a half a finger of white head on a clear, mahogany body with moderate visible carbonation. The nose has definite notes of pecan nuttiness with a hint of almost maple sweetness. It smelled really good. The taste was not quite as good as the nose. The taste had a lot of the nuttiness that was apparent in the nose with a bit of sweetness. But, the body was a little watery and there was very low carbonation on the taste. The finish was quick with a bit of nuttiness. Honestly, this is my least favorite Abita beer so far. It was a little too watery and boring for me. I wouldn’t have this one again."
""
""
""
"Pours a clear dark orange with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, toasted nuts, and some slight caramel aromas. Taste is much the same but there are more burnt flavors than toasted flavors. There is a mild burnt bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty average beer with a promising nose but a somewhat disappointing flavor."

"O: Darn. I was excited to try this one out, but it just was unbelievably lackadaisical. I could see this being a keystone beer if they went back to the drawing board and actually did to the beer what the label says."
""
""
"I had no idea pecans were a major thing in Louisiana. Shows what I know about American agriculture these days. Anyway, this stuff pours a clear sunset auburn topped by a finger of off-cream foam. The nose comprises toasted biscuit, light honey, light toffee, and a vague sense of nuttiness (I can't say with any certainty that I'm smelling pecans, but it's definitely some sort of nut, anyway). The taste brings in more of the same, along with a hint of brown sugar-cinnamon. Unfortunately, everything is now watered-down, slightly blander than before. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a nice little beer, nothing special, but something I could see drinking again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it has a nice odor, but taste is really just average."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I was exited to try a pecan beer, but this was not well executed."
"Overall I'd say for me this is a one time buy. I'm glad I got to experience it, since it is quite different, but it isn't giving me that WOW! sense that I get with other beers that try different things."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - overall this one misses; not solid enough on the pure beer side of things, and the pecan doesn't really add much for interesting character (doesn't really match the text on the label)."
""
"Overall I seem to remember enjoying this beer more in the past, but this is not a total letdown by any means."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - pre-game warm up beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I was not a fan of this beer, to me the mouthfeel resembles a fermented cider. The color is beautiful however and the smell reminds me of fall. This was interesting to try, but I won't be having it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Better then I was thinking it would be. I am not a big fan of pecans but it compliments the beer quite nice. Would have like the malt to be more of a player in the flavor. All in all a good beer session beer though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - After taking a whiff I thought this would be a great beer. After I drank it I was left a little disappointed with the lack of flavor. I think it could be a great beer with some bigger flavor."
"Pours out a light amber-orange color with minimal head that quickly recedes to a few white lingering bubbles. Nutty aroma with lots of caramel, hay and oats seem to scream out at me. Taste is nutty with burnt pecan and pecan shell bitterness, slight malt and caramel sweetness that is barely noticeable, some citrus notes make their way out towards the finish, very mild hop presence throughout the sip. Mouthfeel is light, but refreshing and smooth with average carbonation. Overall, this is a good beer, not too complex but an interesting addition with the pecans that made for an enjoyable brew."
"'m not huge fan of pecans in general, but I had to try it. In general it was solid but unexciting. No real noticeable flavors. The pecan was there, and not overwhelming (which is always a plus in flavored beers). Overall I'm glad I tried it, but I probably woulnd't get it again. Abita always has good beers, but this was not their best."
"I have to give it up to Abita. This is a very surprisingly good beer. When the bottle is opened you immediately smell the pecans, and thats a good thing! The beer pours a brownish color with minimal head and lace, just the right amount. The beer goes down smooth and leaves a nice aftertaste on your pallette. The strength of this beer is definitely the uniqueness and goes down as more than a novelty beer. This is a worthy beer by any means."
"Overall - I do like this one. It does lack refinement here and there, but it does it's purpose. The touted ""real pecan"" flavor really does come through. Minimal hopping and a seemingly bland amber malt profile do provide a good backdrop for flavor. A good seasonal."
"I noticed that many reviewers reported a cloudy pour with little pecan flavor, I wonder if it is a matter of freshness?"
"picture a pecan oktoberfest, and youve got it. Needs some backing flavors. Like maybe pecan pie spices."
"O - This was just okay. I think it would be better with some pie-like spices."
"Overall, not particularly bad, but does through as being light and not particularly tasty."
"Really, not a very good beer. Too bad because their Purple Haze rocks."
"O- This is my favorite offering from Abita that I have had. Really drinkable beer that is great for the fall. One of the sweetest and most sugary beers I have ever had."
"Notes: This my first offering from Abita I thought the beer would be good which it was. It's not bad but decently drinkable. Cheers."
"Overall: A balanced brew which is very subtle. I smelled a lot of pecan but it didn;t transfer over to the taste. Still a good brew to drink and enjoy. Cheers!"
"O - A good different brew for sure. Would definitely drink more."
"O: I've had this before and don't recall liking it this much- I'll have to pick up more as I bought this as a single, but it would be a great beer to sip a couple watching football on a crisp fall Saturday."
"O: A great fall session-ish beer. For the price it's great, I'm a big fan of this beer. Choose if you like nutty beers or just want something tasty to sip on while sitting on the porch on a fall day or after a hot day in the sun even. Would go great with some pecan crusted fish and rice."
"O: This was kind of a let down, yet it is very easy drinking and very sessionable. Flavors are extremely light and watery but what is there is very pleasant tasting."
"O - I like the Pecan Harvest, but it's not without its flaws. It doesn't have a particularly strong smell and the mouthfeel is off. It's a too thin, which is disappointing because I would love the pecan and caramel flavors of this beer to linger. I would drink again, but it doesn't live up to its potential."
"Not bad, but also didnt blow me away. Smooth and easy drinking fall brew. A bit to light though."
"I'd buy it again."
"Pair this with turtle dessert or possibly a pot roast with mashed potatoes and turnips and I could see this shining a bit more."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Pours a clean, see-through brown hue with a thin wispy head. The smell is pretty nondescript. Was hoping for a nutty introduction to the first sip, alas, none to be had. The taste too, fails to deliver on any distinguishable pecan flavor. It's a little sweet with some some caramel and vanilla notes,with a decent helping of maltiness. This is a nice light, refreshing beer, I gotta say that. It goes down real easy. The mouthfeel is real thin, and leaves very little behind except a tinge of bitterness. Overall, this is a decent beer. I don't know if it's something I'd crave, or go out of my way to buy again (more a product of constantly wanting to try new things), but if it was offered, I'd certainly drink it without a fuss."
"Mouthfeel was middling and slightly under carbonated in my opinion. As I said, a fairly solid brown ale, but there are better varieties available."
"You could probably drink a bunch of these in a row and really enjoy yourself. That said, none of them is gonna blow you away and you won't hurry out to get this again. Still, I've been parceling out this sixer over the last week and have enjoyed each one."
"overall - not impressed - no roast no chocolate - not an american brown"
"O: Interesting beer. Flavorful, drinkable and balanced."
"I've only had a couple beers from abita, but they've all been pretty good and the pecan harvest ale is right in there. The color of this beer is a nice golden brown with a slight cloudiness. The smell is caramel with a little earthiness and malt. The taste is caramel, bitterness with earthy and nut flavors. There is a woodiness here that makes for an interesting brew. Over all this is a pretty unique little beer. I didn't know what to expect when I bought this- and it surprised me. I kinda thought it was gonna be sweet more like pecan pie but it has a more earthy nutty taste and it works that way."
"The mouthfeel is just right. It have a great body and feel when you drink it. I'd have to say that it's not one of my favorite brown ales. It's not a bad beer, and it will make many people happy, but not for me."
"aramel color brown with just enough light getting through to give it a sort of off reddish tint. The smallish tan head quickly faded and left behind only traces of itself. The aroma itself was lightly smoked almost, full of roasted malts and a touch of caramel. The flavor was light bodied but nicely roasted with a touch of a bittering finish and a flavor full of earthy grain like tones. A nice subtle bread like base was quaintly masked underneath. Overall this was a decent brown ale. It was nothing spectacular, but I do not think it was designed to be, but rather it was a very nice interpretation of the style"
"O – Not bad but not great either. Middle of the class. Worth a shot for sure. Would have loved a bit nuttier taste to it."
"This one pours a bright and vibrant, cloudy amber in color with a light white lacing around the glass. The aromas are very malty, slightly sweet, with a light and oily nutty essence. Still, for a ""pecan ale"" it isn’t very nutty. It tastes of sweet malts, perhaps some brown sugar or cinnamon, oily pecans and has a light and bitter finish. While drinking you actually eventually get more of a pecan pie type aftertaste which is interesting. It’s solid. The beer drinks pretty light and leaves some nice flavors behind. It’s a very sessionable beer and is interesting enough to drink a couple of them in a sitting. Solid beer, but at least different for a amber/brown ale, whichever this one is considered."
"O: I would call this a nut brown tasting amber ale. But not a brown ale. Amber in color and mouthfeel."
"Pours a copper/ burnt orange color with a filmy off white head. The smell is mainly toasted pecan with some roasted malt aroma as well, there is also some butter and caramel in there. It tastes a little lighter than the aroma, I tastes some buttered pecan and toasted malt. It's medium bodied with moderate carbonation and a wet finish. This is a solid brown ale I thought the addition of pecan went really well."
"Overall, blah."
"Pours a slightly hazy copper body with one finger of off-white head with decent retention. Very enticing aromas of candied pecans and toasted malts are extremely inviting. Flavors are also good but lack the depth necessary to score a 4 in my book. Toasted malts dominate the front and mid-palate, with hints of pecan coming through but not as prominently as on the nose. The finish is a bit hollow, with nothing interesting either developing or lingering. Overall this is an interesting beer, one that I'd happily recommend to friends willing to try new things but not to serious beer geeks."
"O ~ not bad..had hoped for more of the pecan presence..."
"O: Back to the drawing board with this one. Good pecan beers can be done, but this isn't a good example at all."
"Very light hops and malts, typical of a standard ale: think of a slightly more flavorful version of a Bud. Abita, however, has infused this brew with the natural oils that come from pecans, and this extra layer gives the beer a nice, very subtle nutty flavor. It's by no means overpowering; in fact, if you didn't know the pecan layer was there, you probably wouldn't be able to pick it out. But it does add an allure that the ale would otherwise lack."
"The beer pours an orange-amber color with a white head. The aroma is full of toffee and bread malt. I get a little bit of nuttyness in the aroma but there is nothing that screams pecans. The flavor features some light pecan notes as well as some toffee malt. The beer is fairly dry overall. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"It's an excuse me subtle brew, but flavorful none the less and well done. I would buy again when I was in a similar midsummer refreshing mood lkike I am today."
"It's an enjoyable amber colored ale with substantial notes of pecans in the nose and throughout the taste. The hearty pecan presence is balanced by caramel, roasted malt, and a hint of brown sugar. At an ABV of only 5%, it’s quite easy to drink, and recommended to anyone looking for a flavorful session beer,"
"This poured out as a very light brown color, it had a thin white head on it that didn't last very long. There wasn't much lacing at all. The smell of the beer had a faint nutty aroma with some caramel malts backing it up. The taste of the beer is rather bland, I can't seem to get much of the nut flavors from this. The mouthfeel is probably the only decent thing about this beer. Overall not impressed really, I expected more for some reason."
"O - Okay version of a nut brown ale. Not a huge fan and will probably not return. Nice attempt, but I still am yet to find a nut brown ale that impresses."
"Mouthfeel is almost waterlike nothing like a beer should be."
"Pours an iced tea orange-brown color. Virtually no head. The smell is straightforward; sweet & malty with a touch of nut. Initially strikes the palate as very malty and sweet with a moderate mouthfeel. Medium-high carbonation but a disappointingly thin body. There's a simple sugary sweetness throughout, resembling honey at times. A subtle herbal taste lends a bit of complexity on the front end, but the beer shines when the nutty pecan character develops toward the back of the tongue and in the aftertaste. Overall, the beer could use more complexity but delivers on the ""pecan beer"" concept well enough. Surprisingly refreshing, too."
"Drinks less than average. Drinkable, but not something I'd seek out."
"D- This beer was drinkable but not enjoyable. A good malt bomb I suppose but only if you like the sweet caramel malts just rushing at you. I would like to see more pecans or nutty flavor to this beer and I think it would work out nice. A overall drain pour if I hadn't have split it with a friend."
"D- one and done. Very light for a brown ale and little to no nut flavor"
"This one challenged my taste buds! Poured from 12 oz bottle into a dimpled mug. Poured a pretty clear coppery amber with a thin white head. It seems to have pretty low carbonation. It smells wonderful--very nutty and a little fruity. It feels medium-bodied and it's flavor is just as wonderful at the smell! You can really taste the pecan and it finishes very smoothly. This brew really offers an enjoyable experience--I'll definitely buy this one again and I highly recommend other to try it."
"Average alcohol and no offensive flavors, not a great beer, not a bad beer."
"D: The beer is very drinkable, but I don't think I would have more than one of these in a sitting because the flavor isn't interesting enough to hold my attention."
"I don't think this beer should be categorized as a brown ale though. Due to the color and lack of any roasted smells o flavors. I had to rate this beer on what I though about it overall, not within a style guideline."
"Comes out of the tap a very appetizing coppery-golden amber with a decent pale tan head. Aroma is strong and malty with a definite nutty undertone - must be the pecan. Flavor is mainly malty with a nutty undertone and just a hint of molasses. Texture is fairly smooth and quite tingly, leaving behind a decent and persistent fizz."
"Thanks Nic for bringing a bottle of this one over that night. Poured a medium orange color, with a smallish cap of off-white foam. Aromas of pecans, caramel malt and a hint of cocoa powder. Light to medium bodied, the palate follows the nose with bready malt, caramel and pecans."
"D- Very easy to drink, but not overly nutty as the name leads one to think. Nicely balanced, but nothing that stands out."
"This is a beer you wouldn't turn down but I won't be buying anymore."
"Drinkability - The drinkability of this brew is not bad. The smell was a bit disturbing to me. The taste was predominantly bland. I doubt I pick this up again. I went in thinking this brew was going to one thing, but it turns out to be another."
"M - Light bodied, imperceptible ABV, good CO2, pleasant drinkability."
"M - Light body with a very slight chew. Lightly carbonated."
"This is a decent brew."
"A very unique beer that im glad to have tried but not something I would buy a six pack of again unless im in the mood for pecans in beer form."
"D - this is a pretty good beer. This was the first beer I have had brewed with nuts"
"D/M: Crisp light and flavorful with a good carbonation."
"Poured a goldish brown body with decent head that died quick. A minor hoppy aroma with minor sweet malts but not as malty as expected. Has a bit of yeasty sweetness but is more or less bland and dry and there is minor hopping taste on the backend. Just a vanilla-type beer for the masses that I tried and I can live w/o trying it again."
"On a side note, BM me if you have an Abita beer you think'll blow my socks off please!"
"D: If you like the pecan flavor, this one will be very easy to drink for you."
"D - great. At 5% ABV, could easily have a few. Good thing I have the rest of a sixer in the fridge. It's a solid brew, but definitely not my favorite brown, as I definitely like mine a bit heavier. I'd still get it again though, probably."
"D: Goes down easy. Sessionable for certain. Simple, nice easy drinking flavor and nothing inhibits that."
"Upon pouring, this beer has a beautiful brown color and is topped with a good off-white colored head that turns to a light lacing throughout drinking it. On the nose you get a nice clean nutty pecan aroma that also come through in the taste. As well as the nuttiness of the pecan you get yeasts and crisp acid that would stand up well to some down home Creole or Cajun cookin'; and would probably lend its self very well to anything made with a black-as-night Creole roux and a dash of spice- like a flavorful Gumbo or Etouffee. This brew is perfectly balanced; enough sweet, enough bitter, with just the right about of nuttiness and great carbonation, boasting a medium body. I could see myself drinking a whole few six packs of these when they come out next year!"
"This is an extremely drinkable beer and I found it to be quite refreshing and thirst quenching. The pecans seem to add a nice toasted and nutty quality without the need of darker malts that would also add roasted and chocolate notes. This is a pretty interesting beer and a nice fall offering."
"A decent light bodied easy drinking nut brown ale if that's what you're looking for. I prefer heartier nut browns like Goose Island Mild Winter."
"O: Good beer, probably best for a warm fall day, not one that will warm you on those colder fall days as the leaves are falling."
"This beer pours a crystal clear orange color. It's slightly off brown, almost a honey color. There was no head at all. Just a small foamy tan ring around the outside of my pint glass. The nose is almost nonexistent as well. Only some bready and malty notes tickled my senses. It taste thin and the only pecan I get is the scratchy feeling on the roof of my mouth. The finish is dry and light. It is extremely easy to drink. Simple yet affective. It's not bad there just isn't enough to it."
"Hey, many people say they like nuts or nutty but don't bother to get too specific about it, and plenty of beers are nutty, but in this case you really do get a roasted pecan flavor. Pretty cool. Poured a 2"" head. Rich brown color (uh, pecan brown). Tastes of pecans, pralines, coffee, malt. And it really had a pretty lengthy finish. Thoroughly enjoyed it. Even the lady of the house who seldom eats nuts thought this was a tasty beer."
"Drinkability: It's okay. Went allright with a meal (meatloaf) but not well with that meal. I think I could drink it alone - but I lost interest after awhile. I prefer brown ales with a bit more malt forward flavors. An okay beer."
"drinks ok. nothing off-putting, but very tame in all aspects producing a very forgettable beer with little nut and little brown ale characteristics."
"Overall, nothing to blow your socks off here. Subtle interesting flavor with the pecans, easy drinking and pleasant. Would make a fine session beer."
"Would drink again but not in my gotta-have-it arsenal."
"D: Not a mind-numbingly bad beer, but certainly not a good one either."
"Pours a clear, copper color. 5/4 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of sweet malt, hint of earthy malt, hint of hops, hint of grain, and some nutty aroma. Fits the style of an American Brown Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, slight earthy malt, hint of hop, hint of nut, and a hint of pale malt. Overall, good blend and appearance. Not outstanding, but better than its current rating."
"Drinkability - I went into this tasting with some skepticism due to being such a fan of Southern Pecan, but this is a pretty decent brew. I'd like to taste them both back to back sometime to make a fairer comparison. Complex enough in its taste and a pretty good-tasting brew."
"I've had many nut brown ales with nuttier flavors than this beer, which actually uses pecans. Pecan nut oil lent more of a bittnerness than nut flavor, more akin to the tannic flavor of the shell. Overall, thin and uninterestng, which is too bad, as the beer sounds great, in theory."
"Thin mouthfeel and easy to drink just not a lot of flavor."
"Overall- A fun beer if you dig nuts, though they arent too overwhelming. Would definitely be a boring beer without the nuts! Smells good but a bit thin for an American Brown Ale. Average drinkability, though I am happy I only got one! Its worth a try, but a whole 6er might be tough to take on."
"Solid two fingers of cream white foam, good density, mainly micro-bubbles with a few just ""small"" bubbles here and there, rentention is above average, thin lacing at best. Light amber to copper orange in color, good consistency throughout until some more yellow at the edges, transparent, no meaningfully visible bubbles. The nose offers a coating of molasses glaze to the base of roasted pecans, nothing very pushy or dominating here, not bready more like scones or hard biscuits, more pepper spice than and flowers or other softer element, maybe caramel, it's a toss-up but, overall, probably more malty than hoppy. Medium-bodied, sets itself in the mouth firmly, carbonation has strength but rarely exercises it. Sweeter in the mouth was upfront caramel, toffee, maple syrup notes, maybe even orange peel. The pecan component is middling, never absent but no star of the show either. Less general roastiness than expected. Oil, stream water, grass than something like banana and bubblegum, little by way of apricot, peach fruit. No glaring defects nor anything to piss you off, just not much going down."
"D: This beer sounded good, but its just ok. Generally it's pretty bland with only subtle hints of pecan. I think the brewer missed the mark with this one."
"would not get again didnt care for the mouth feel would have liked a nutty taste overall disappointing"
"Drinkability was pretty good."
"Drinkability- I thought it was pretty good. Definitely mostly pecan. If we had it here, I might possibly buy it again."
"D - Very drinkable, almost like a Newcastle (but it actually has flavor)."
"Pours a moderately dark chestnut brown, on in this instance, I suppose pecan is more apt. Nose is slight caramel and doughy malt along with a slight hint of pecan, although not too much. Pecan comes through a bit more in the taste. Comes through decently enough, just not a particularly great flavor and not much backing it up. Mouthfeel is quite thin; would have expected much more body from a brown ale. Drinkability is fairly poor as the novelty wears off after a few ounces."
"Drinkability: This is an interesting beer- pecans could definitely lend some real unique flavors to beer and this one proves that. However, this relies too much on the pecans and there really isn't much more than that. Interesting: yes. However, depth really lacks in this brew."
"Drinkability: Of all of the falls beers, I was very disappointed with this one. The beer had a watery texture in my mouth and the flavors were not in balance with the nose. It instead left a dry bitterness and with the almost no hop characters present in the nose, I was a little lost at this finding. While it did have a light mouthfeel and I am used to drinking hoppy dry beers, this beer would have had an easy drinkabilty yet with its unbalanced flavors I had very little desire to do so."
"D: The yummy sounding title of this brew may be tantalizing, but the realization of that idea presented here is not good."
"This ale pours a crystal clear amber color with an off white, moderate head that leaves some lacing. The aromas of malt and nuts are pronounced but not in your face. The flavor begins with nice biscuity and slighly yeasty malt flavors, which give way to the distinct but not overpowering flavor of pecans. This is a very light and highly drinkable beer that delivers exactly what it promises. A great choice for a change of pace in the fall or winter."
"Too thin and watery, though."
"A says 'barkey', which I have noticed with slightly underripe pecans but might just be suggestion."
"I really didn't like this beer which is unusual for me though. I like the Abita beers but this one was too bitter and had nothing in the way of interesting flavors to redeem itself. I wouldn't buy it again and I wouldn't drink it if it were free! Not one of their better efforts. Purple Haze and Strawberry Harvest are both must better beer."
"Overall, an OK beer that's worth a try, just don't expect to be blown away."
"D - Pretty good. A bit bland but if you can get past that then it's ok. 3.5"
"D - Pretty good stuff. Nothing to write home about, but its a nice easygoing brew that's a little too much on the sweet side to really have session potential. Worth a try for the novelty of a pecan infused brew, and as a good brew from the craft brew-deficient southern states."
"D: I can't say I was let down, because I've never been impressed by Abita, but this started out with some promise and then crashed and burned."
"Forget this one."
"You can pack these away pretty quickly - not a bad effort at all even if my bottle isn't super-fresh."
"Overall it's a little bit too light on everything. It's pleasant enough and what's there is decent, but I really want more - more character and more flavor."
"Drinkability: If you're a home brewer, this taste like a nut brown ale's wort, a one and done for me. I recommend this to one who wants to try what a carbonated wort taste like with little ABV."
"D: A pretty good Brown... the pecan flavor is a little over the top but not to bad.... makes it a little different than most Browns I've had. Hey it is an Abita! so you know it is going to be pretty good and this is not bad. Not overly complex but is smooth sweet and nutty. Give it a try."
"I really wanted to like this beer...and I do, but I am not excited about it...would I buy it again, maybe, but I probably will not remember anything about it in a few weeks...other than it's mediocrity."
"D- an ok brew, and a literal 'nut brown ale'. it's seriously whetting my appetite, perhaps the high point of this experience along with the aroma but without the pecans, this baby would be very substandard. a good beer for beginners."
"Poured into a shaker pint. Dark amber with a bubbly head that hangs around. Laces somewhat. I am reviewing the beer I am currently drinking but I had this a year ago and really loved it, that beer was full of pecan sweetness it was very enjoyable. I went back to the store for more and they were sold out. I eagerly picked it up again this year and frankly there is nothing special about it (bad pecan harvest). Slightest of hints of a nutty aroma but taste is kinda flat. Not bad tasting but not what I had last year."
"Verdict: Rather straightforward, but tasty enough Pecan Harvest Ale is solid little beer. Perhaps not as unique as the others in the series, but still worth a try for nutty brews."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a caramel color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts and pecans, a tad sweet. Taste is good, malts, hops pecans, it's all there and just a touch of sweetness. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this is an interesting and tasty brew."
"D- I see no reason to drink or buy this beer again. It wasn't bad, just uninteresting and not really worth spending any more time, money or sobriety on."
"Blipped ""Pecan Pie"" by Golden Smog"
"Overall a worthy session, but not impressive enough to seek out again. Nothing really stands out, kind of weak and muddy."
" D- The biscuit malt seems to dominate with the only real pecan is on the outside of the bottle."
"It's an OK medium bodied beer that is easy to drink, but I had hopes of an even better taste from my first pecan ale."
"D- An interesting beer. The unusual sweetness to it makes me reluctant to try again."
"D: Quite drinkable, recent Abita offerings have been quite solid."
"It poured a light amber with a shitload of head that I thought would overflow my perfect pour glass. The aroma was very light with a bit of nut to it. The taste is VERY light, slightly smoky. If the pecan is there I couldn't find it. It left my mouth a little dry afterwards to the point of being annoying. No me gusta..."
"The flavor really lack any depth and never makes it to the next level."
"An average brew."
"This is pretty darn drinkable and would make a decent session beer. Fits the season nicely and surely a good addition to any Thanksgiving day table."
"12oz bottle at NOLA in Palo Alto, poured into a clear plastic cup, which is all they had (think they expected me to drink from the bottle, which if I did, I might have had to commit ritual suicide afterwards since I would have disgraced myself and my entire family by doing so). I'd call this more of an amber ale than a brown ale if anything. Pours a mostly clear amber color with a creamy one-finger white head. Aroma is caramel malt, pecan' and spice. Flavor is somewhat mild but pleasant with caramel malt, pecans, bread, and some earthy hop bitterness. Medium-light body with a fairly smooth palate and soft carbonation. Drinkability is high. Not too exciting, but pretty good overall."
"D - Easy drinking abv. Somewhat filling, driven by the hefty carbonation. Flavors are light, not overwhelming. Overall, I don't find this beer to be a great session beer."
"pours cloudy amber with a frothy white head that lasts and laces... aroma is something I can't quite put my finger on... smells nutty, but also some sort of funky smell underneath... mouthfeel is a letdown, very thin, was expecting something richer from what I guess woudl really be a nut brown... flavor is dry, but there is an unsweetened candied pecan flavor to it... not bad, but not sure that it was great either... Interesting, but I'm not sure that it all works together as well as I had expected."
"This is not one Abita's best brews, but it is well balanced and sessionable as a seasonal offering for something different. The tastes & flavors seem fresh and authentic."
"Notes: Unfortunately it is quite forgettable. Abita maybe does not feel like a top-notch brewery for most, but they sure can do better than this. However, this one is not a brew that does them any favors..."
"Go Lazy Magnolia Pecan."
"Drinkability: The pecan flavor is obvious but not cloying. The overall beer is not too impressive, but isn't off-putting in any way. It could be one of the best Abita beers I've had."
"D) Pretty good. 5% ABV, a fairly average brown ale with a little bit of a twist with real Louisiana pecans. I actually would have liked a little more pecan flavor. Nothing I'll be rushing back for."
"Other than that, the beer pours a clearish cloudy orange with a thick, retentive head and some sweet, light brown sugar, light hops, and an oily sesame taste. Balance is a bit off, with the backbone and nut flavors battling it out for supremacy. Decent drinkability, but nothing special."
"Not a bad beer, but not quite what I expected."
"D: Abita makes a great product, and this one is no exception. Try with good cheeses, Roux soups, game, duck, or Thanksgiving dinner!"
"The taste is a bit overly processed. There is a nutty taste to the beer, it is slightly watery. There are some odd notes on the backend. In the mid section the beer is a bit too clean, some dryish notes, with some mediocre tasting ale highlights. I guess I'm tasting some pecan, but it really isn't defined that well. This beer I can do without another. The mouthfeel is adequate, not much aftertaste, a bit watery, not a keeper."
"Simple, pleasant but not extraordinary beer."
"12oz. brown bottle served in a shaker pint. Poured a slightly hazy reddish gold with a thin whitehead. Nice aroma, this is where you get the most pecan character. Light to medium bodied. Plenty of caramel malt. Slight hop bitterness in the finish. Very easy drinking and sessionable beer. Good idea to use a seasonal, local ingredient."
"D: A great ale to relax to and enjoy. There's nothing too offensive or challenging about this flavor."
"Glad I gave this a try, and I'll be sure to grab more."
"A pretty good beginning leads to some disappoinment at the end. Oh well. This is pretty decent enough as it is."
"So not an everyday beer, for sure, but a nice beer and one that I think, in that one instance, will shine."
"Overall impression: Better than I expected, this was drinkable with some interesting flavors."
"The mouth is silky smooth and creamy. It could stand a bit more of a carbonation kick, but it's decent. This is a very buttery beer. Tastes of buttered bread, and some mild pecan flavor. I was expecting this to be a bit more nutty. Finishes bready and a little drying. This wasn't really what I expected, but it was decent nonetheless."
"M&D- Smooth, light medium body that I could see a lot of Abita fans really digging and drinking quite a bit of. For me, one or two and i'm done."
"D: I would say this one is a keeper. The higher than expected alcohol content encourages me to enjoy one per session. But this is one that I will keep in my rotation of fall seasonal beers. If you get a chance to try it, go for it. It's worth it."
"If I drank this without knowing it, I don't think I would figure out it's supposed to be a pecan ale. The funky zest and aftertaste mar this one a bit as well. There's a sturdy malt back, but I'd never get this one as a specialty ale."
"A clear amber color pour with a two finger white head, medium carbonation , a good amount of jagged lacing left . Aroma of light sweet malts, yeast , brown sugar and a faint note of nuts . Flavor is quite subtle, nutty as promised , some light hops , and more brown sugar , no single flavor stands out , quite balanced but not as malty as I had hoped . Thin body , slightly oily mouthfeel , with an almost dry finish leaving a light hint of roasted pecans. Drinkable but not sessionable for me , a good brew but nothing special."
"Pours a hazy reddish orange, with a medium tan head. Not very brown in color at all. Smell is of pecans that went bad. Taste is a bit better, tart malts up front, thin middle, with a hint of pecan in the finish. Also an unusual bitterness that does not seem to be coming from hops. Finish is also very dry. Mouthfeel is average, average carbonation levels as well. Drinkability is not the best, this beer is ok, but the pecans give it a wierd taste that I don't like too much. I do not like eating pecans as it is, so that might be part of it. If you are a pecan lover you might like this beer, otherwise its just ok."
"D-Very drinabkle. Love the sweet nutty flavor. Could be contructed a bit better."
"Poured from a stubby 12 ounce bottle into my nonic Imperial pint glass. The ale appears a clear medium chestnut color with about a finger of light ecru foam. Nose and flavor are dominated by none other than nuts. Pecans to be more accurate. Notes of toasted bread and caramel are also present as well as a touch of earthy bitter hops. About medium bodied and amply carbonated for the style. A simple, but tasty nutty brown ale."
"Interesting. You can really taste the pecan. Hell, you can even smell it! But does it fit in with the beer? I'm not sure, but I kind of like it. It's weird, but good. It replicates a caramel-coated pecan. It doesn't really interfere with the beer. It's just an odd-twist. But is an odd-twist enough? I'm thinking to myself right now, out at the bar, would I have one of these? Maybe. And if I did, would I have two? Probably not. But I'd definitely have one at home. Two in a row? Probably not. On the other hand, and I've said this about many beers before, I think this is an excellent beer to have with Thanksgiving dinner, or something else along those lines. And, although it's not particularly rich or sweet (it's actually really well balanced with just the pecan nuttiness added into the mix), I think this would make a great beer to relax with on a spring, summer, or fall evening on the back porch as the sun goes down and the stars come out. Interesting. Charming. Worth trying."
"Overal a decent drinker, though a bit on the sweet side. Nothing impressive."
"Overall-a quality beer that had a flavor that just wasn't to my liking, sometimes it is that simple."
"Dark,pumpkin orange with a solid finger of creamy light tan head that leaaves decent lace on the glass. Smells of roasted pecan nuttiness and biscuit malt. Tastes nutty and unique with a good roasted malt backbone and lots of pecan. Smooth and slightly pecan oily on the palate with smooth carbonation. A real suprise that tastes better that I thought it would, also not really close to a traditional brown ale."
"Pours a light copper with a standard 1/2 inch head that quickly settles to a fine ring fed by a good amount of carbonation. Smells of an oily nutty maltiness with a hint of roasted malts. Light to medium mouthfeel with a slight amount of oil that slides around the tongue. Carbonation picks up a bit once inside. Bittering hops balancing things out well. Finishes with an afterthought of nuttiness. Quite a solid little beer, seems to be somewhat sessionable. Worth checking out if its available."
"(D) A decent beer, but the hope for Pecan taste left me wanting."
"This is just a so-so brown ale from Abita; drinkability is just average."
"Overall this is a fine beer, and I believe the first I've had with real nuts. Good job, Abita."
"this brew pours up a murky copper color with a nice big, frothy off white head. the nose is subtle sweet malts, pecans, mild fall spices, earth. I taste sweet pale malts, subtle crisp hops, mild spices. a very crisp and clean beer. This would make a solid session brew. I dig it..."
"This one was decent, certainly not offensive, but it just lacked any real character. I could see this pecan idea being pretty good, but in order for that to happen it needs a better base beer."
"D-Extremely drinkable, goes down easy"
"Mouthfeel was medium in body and texture."
"Pours a good sized head, white but very quickly diminishing. Amber orange colored fizzy body. Very fizzy soda smelling aroma. Syrupy maltiness along with some nuttiness, maybe pecans too. Very grainy aroma. Grainy malty pecan taste. Very carbonated. A little dusty. Has that unique Abita taste to it, maybe it's the water. I like the pecan, but not the Abita taste."
"Mouthfeel is light, light but fizzy carbonation, tiny bit watery."
"Drinkability: I like it, especially as a seasonal fall ale. It has an interesting taste..I could easily session this."
"This is a good beer; if I am in the mood for pecans and Southern Pecan is unavailable, this will more than satisfy."
"O- A drinkable beer. The extreme pecanness could detract from the overall drinkability of it after about 2 beers, but if you're really into the pecan flavor you will dig this."
"I really thought I remembered this being better last year...not by much but still...Very refreshing initially but halfway through, it just seemed forced. The appearance was really good...its almost like it enticed me to drink, but when I did, I almost wished I hadn't. The appearance and the ""pecan"" name made me get my hopes up but smelling and tasting left much to be desired. Worth trying but nothing I would actively seek out again."
"Decent overall. Has a bit of a watery diluted feel, but a good taste. Pretty mediocre atmosphere. Does have good drinkability, though. Since it's only out for a short while, worth picking up a sixer. Solid quaff."
"Maybe the pecans add to the nice smoothness of this beer or maybe the word pecans just helps sell this one. Either way, its worth a shot if you're into trying new things."
"Pours medium translucent brown with a tall foamy head, a tiny bit of lacing but otherwise just a swirl after the first few minutes. Nose is a little nutty and sweet, but not as pecan-y as I was expecting. Taste is a little bitter up front with some pecan flavors. Not as deep pecan-y or buttery as I would have expected, it was a bit thin."
"Overall- It's a very run-of-the-mill beer. The pecan harvest name gave me really high hopes for a nutty flavor and really ""raw"" feel. Not a bad beer, just a tad uninspired."
"Edit 2009: I would like to add that this beer is a nice beer to have after a couple of pale ales or IPAs. I notice the pecan taste is a bit stronger making the beer a bit fuller. Still, a good beer to buy from Abita when you have the chance."
"Nice beer, though all aspects are muted and light. Very easily quaffable though, I could drink many."
"D - This was a good example of a Brown Ale, and as a Southerner that loves pecans, I was excited that a company decided to blend the two. However, I would have like the pecan to shine more in this beer, as Rogue's Hazelnut does for them."
"The aroma is mostly malty, earthy, only a slight sign of pecans or nuts. The appearance is very attractive, a nice reddish/brown, clear, carbonation bubbles, decent off-white head, lacing on glass. The flavor is definitely pecan, nutty, some sweet malts, honey, molasses come through. The finish has a slight hop bite, starting as the beer heads for the back of the throat. Clean finish. The mouthfeel is medium thick. Nice enjoyable beer, but not a great Brown Ale by any means."
"This is not a bad beer, flaw-wise, but I can't see drinking more than this bottle that was given to me. It would, however, be a great addition to all kinds of dishes from barbecue to desserts as a reduction/glaze."
"Overall: As nut ales go, this one's quite good. Just enough nut character without going overboard. I would look for this again."
"Drinkable brew."
"D: Light body enhances drinkability, no doubt, but the flatness of the flavor profile limits the overall enjoyment of this beer. As far as I know, this is the only pecan ale besides Southern Pecan. I'll stick with Southern Pecan--it has more body and flavor. Still, this is worth seeking out for anyone eager to try a pecan ale."
"The beer pours a dark amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a sweet crystal malt scent along with a nice nutty character. It also has a complimentary bisquity aroma. The taste is decent. It has a dry, bisquity flavor with a bit od crystal malt sweetness. It goes dow easy and finishes thin with a subtle nittiness. The mouthfeel is decent as well. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a pretty good beer, but it's too thin in the finish and it has some metallic off flavors."
"Notes from 3/6/08"
"The aroma does have some pecans but it seems somewhat strange. Not bad but odd in a paper kind of way. There is some malt though. The appearance is orange and the head thin. The flavor is like the aroma with a bitter nutty finish. The palate is thin. It's a nice try but not great."
"Drinkability: This one is interesting, sort of a novelty, but not much more. Sort of like a watered-down pecan pie, but it's really not one I'd see myself returning to."
"Mouthfeel is a little thin, but better than average drinkability."
"The beer is light to medium bodied. The sweetness at the start is short lived followed by a prolonged bitterness from the hops. There is a slight nuttiness throughout."
"D: This is a nice, light, sessionable brew. The taste falls a bit short of expectations given the phenomenal smell. I would not turn one of these down, however."
"12 ounce bottle, best before 2/11/2009. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear orange/copper color with about an inch off-white head. Lacing and head retention are boht average. Aroma is sweet and caramel malt, pecans, and some toffee and butterscotch. The aroma is also a bit light. Unfortunately, the taste is lighter than the aroma is. What I can taste isn't bad (because it's similar to the aroma), but it's just not strong at all. It also has a slight bitter finish. Mouthfeel/body is light, it's smooth but a bit thin and watery with decent carbonation. Drinkability is OK. For the price ($7.79 a sixer), I wouldn't pick this up again as it's not a good value for the price. But if you find a single bottle of this anywhere, it's worth a try."
"Very fresh tasting and highly drinkable. I bought two six packs and am liking my decision more with each one of these I drink, and I'm not really an amber ale fan. I would buy this again, fo sho! Well done, Abita!"
"D - Looks and smells great, but slightly dissappointing in the taste and mouthfeel departments... Respectable and original, but not remarkable..."
"Drinkability: Pretty high. The carbonation makes it go down smoothly, and the alcohol doesn't bite at all."
"Drinkability is very good, it went very well with dinner, mock tender steaks and potatoes. Like the few other brews from Abita I've tried this is a lighter style than might be expected from a Fall harvest release, but it seems very suited to Southern climes and foods!"
"Goes great with grilled burgers. Easy to drink."
"Pours a crystal clear amber with a thin creme head. Nose is like peanut butter. Flavor is a bit tangy, but carries a full enough amount of pecan to be noticed. No great complexity, but it's nice. Smooth liquid feel. Carbonation is mid range. Nice to drink. It's smooth enough and a pretty drinkable nut brown. I bet this would be nice on cask."
"Poured a pretty clear coppery amber with a thin white head. It seems to have pretty low carbonation. It smells wonderful--very nutty and a little fruity. It feels medium-bodied and it's flavor is just as wonderful at the smell! You can really taste the pecan and it finishes very smoothly. This brew really offers an enjoyable experience--I'll definitely buy this one again and I highly recommend other to try it."
"Very drinkable, but not as breathtaking as I was hoping. Being from the South, pecans have long played a role in my diet (my home is on an old pecan plantation, and I have pecan trees in my backyard). Sadly, they just don't seem to play much of a role in this ale."
"Overall: had to try it, im in the south and pecan seasonal beer.... I mean come on. It's pretty good definitely worth trying for the originality of it."
"D - I'd share this at a seasonal gathering without feeling like it's out of place."
"I was really excited to try this brew, especially after some of Abita's other great beers. However this beer was a huge disappointment, and I knew it the minute I saw how lightly coppered the pour was. The head was nice but disappeared quickly. I didn't notice even one hint of pecan smell or taste throughout this creation. The mouthful is extremly light and crisp, but leaves you hoping for more. You could very easily drink alot of these but I wouldn't want to. Not a complete failure for Abita, but not nearly as good as some of their other products."
"Abita Pecan Ale pours a hazy copper color with an off white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. There is a nice malty aroma, I can't really smell any pecan though. There is a medium mouthfeel. The flavor is quite malty, with a bit of nutty flavor, which I couldn't really attribute to pecan, but it's pretty good in any case. There really aren't any hops that are noticeable, but that's appropriate in a brown ale. Definitely decent, worth a try."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Fairly thin mouthfeel, but pretty refreshing going down. I think this could make a great entry level beer for your bud light friends. I always buy a few of these when they come around every year."
"This is a pretty boring beer. I assume it's labeled a brown ale because of the pecans. It's really not; more like an amber ale with pecans. Nice nutty aroma, but not much to it at all. It's not bad, it's just pretty mediocre. No thanks."
"T + M + D: Light, subtle maltiness with a dash of bitterness on the tongue. A little nuttiness going on. A sweet edge, a little tinny in some ways. Thin, light, and inoffensive. An easy drinker without totally giving up flavour. Kinda numbing...great to drink back without thinking about it too much."
"Light-bodied and refreshing with a spritz of carbonation. Not something I'd want to drink all the time, but a nice change of pace"
"Not a heavy-hitter but nice just the same. Try it with a big bowl of sausage jambalaya --- the sweet will compliment the spice."
"D- Goes down pretty easy, but nothing special."
"This beer poured a very light reddish brown that was highly translucent. The scent was actually very pleasing for such a light looking beer - it was rather sweet with a certain nuttiness. The flavor was very light, but caramel malt was clearly present. This beer certainly didn't prove to be very complex, but it certainly is a very drinkable brown. You could almost think of it as a 'light' brown ale, in my opinion. I was pleasantly surprised considering I usually don't care for Abita - this could make for a decent session brown."
"Overall a pretty refreshing brown ale."
"Mouthfeel is pretty average; slightly carbonated, a bit watery, but not bad. Overall a mediocre brew that probably wasn't worth the price."
"Very average. Pecan ale? No. Brown? Not even. I don't quite know what Abita was going for here, but to tout about using real pecans in the brewing I've had plenty of beers with more nutty flavor than this...and they didn't use nuts in the brewing."
"Great overall beer. Poured a clear brown color with thin white head. Smelled of nuts. Tastes of nuts, good malts, caramel, and there is a smokey flavor too. There was never a bad moment in the aftertaste, it kept me wanting more. Goes down smooth. I had 3 and that was probably a good number, not sure if I wanted another. I would glady buy this again, I recommend it for any beer drinker."
"Appears clear dark copper brown hue with a large bright off white head leaves behind fine intricate lacing as it dwindles down. Aroma has a nice peacan roastiness about it with caramel accents. Mild herbal hop additions come through as well very nice balanced nose to it. Flavors have a reserved nutty character ala the pecan additions. Moderate sweetness with caramel malts surrounding the roasted pecan flavors ample bitterness this is a nice fall beer that I will be willing to drink again and again. Motuhfeel is light to medium bodied range a bit of residual sweetness adss some extra texture to it, moderate carbonation. Drinkability is solid easy to drain nicely doen additive, pecans were very natural with earthiness proving there was no extract to creat a cloying mess, nice brew."
"Drinkability- very good, nice and light albeit a tad sweet."
"Alongside its light mouthfeel, the crisp and refreshing - if, unfortunately, somewhat watery - nature of this ale does make it eminently drinkable."
"Drinkability- Not the greatest beer ever but good and worth a try."
"Not bad, although certainly not your typical American Brown ale..."
"Mouthfeel is quite light, and very carbonated. makes it easy to drink and appropriate in character for the hot, humid days in the south. I can see how this would be a popular brew in that part of the country. For me, I think either more pecans, or less carbonation even, would make this a better beer. I wouldnt seek this one out again."
"Pours pale copper into my glass, the beer settles in as filtered pale copper with a big fuzzy head at first before slowing receeding. The aroma is pleasant, toffeeish, and nutty; the pecans are worked nicely in the nose. In fact, the pecans are worked nicely in the taste as well. It's light enough for the sub-tropical weather from where it hails, but flavorful enough to keep you interested. Toffee and nuts prevail on the palate, with a hoppy note lingering on in the aftertaste. Certainly worth a try."
"Poured from a bottle into a pilsner. This beer poured a slightly hazy brown amber color with a 1 inch off white foam head leaving behind speckled lacing throughout the glass. Not much to smell but picked up slight hints of malt and nuts. The taste was decent with definite nutty flavors coming through although the malt was more predominant. No pecans to speak of but similar to a nut brown ale. Good carbonation finishing crisp an fairly clean. Not a bad beer similar to a nut brown. Wouldnt go out of my way for it but worth trying once."
"Low carbonation, a bit syrupy, which hurts the drinkability a bit in my opinion. Otherwise, quite tasty, something a little different and worth trying once."
"D: A decent nut brown ale, but probably only average as far as brown ales go. I probably wouldn't seek this one out."
"Had an orange honey color with an inch of head that quickly diminished to what can't really be called a sheen(Emilio Estevez). As hard as I tried to smell Pecans they were not there and neither was anything else for that matter. Tasted crisp and light with a minor nutty finish. I expected more Pecan, but they were not there. It's an OK beer I suppose but not what I had hoped for."
"Easy to drink, but don't get this beer if you're looking for a flavorful pecan experience."
"D - A little lack luster compared to what the smell suggested. Not bad but would definately like to try a fresher bottle."
"Semi transluscent amber pour with a short lived off white head. Smell is light caramelly malt, with at times slight hints of pecans. Not very noticeable, but I think I smelled pecan pie at times. Taste is pretty much a simple malty amber with mild bitterness, and no real hop flavor to speak of. Notes of pecan in some sips, but faint. A touch boring, but not bad."
"A very solid offering from abita. Thanks to barefootbrewer for the sample (I think). I'm not sure. If that's wrong let me know."
"Give it a shot, just dont expect too much and you will be fairly happy."
"Solid brew - I believe the pecans should be noticeable, but in the background as this one presents. You don't want a pecan husk in a glass to drink."
"Pours a nice semi-cloudy golden brown color, nice carbonation, nice small creamy tannish head, which leaves some nice sticky lacing. The nose is malty, slightly tangy, very slight nutty/pecan tone, and some caramel. The taste is malty, slight tangy/bitter, and caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, not too bad, but would not buy if it was in my area, but glad to have try it."
"Notes: A decent to below average brew."
"d: Interesting, but as far as Pecan Nut Browns go, I think Lazy Magnolia's Southern Pecan has it beat. An interesting beer, but I won't seek it out. Goes down pretty easy, but nothing special."
"D: Not terrible but I certainly won't get this again... especially with a great local brewery(Mt.Carmel) that makes a nice Nut Brown."
"D: I wasn't impressed, but it is worth a shot to see what the Abita brewery can do."
"Made with real Louisana pecans. Props for trying something unique and different but the aroma and lackluster flavor falls short here. Pours a clear golden-orange color with a light off white head. There is some muskiness on the nose with light pecans and fresh bread. Flavor is light malt with an earthy bittering hop bite, perhaps a tad bit to much with a touch of nuttiness and citrus on the fade. Flavor is moderate at best, the pecans really do nothing to make it stand out or give it some character. Mouthful is very light and watery. Drinkability is moderate at best and wouldnt recommend it, if not just for the sake of saying you had a pecan beer."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, decent representation of style, its not a bad beer, but it certainly would be the first that I would choose, even within the style."
"Overall- Creamy smooth and tasty. A tad subdued on flavor but easily drinkable."
"Likeable, unusual taste, and more of a bitter, hoppy vibe. The pecan oil infusion is subtle but distinctive, and Abita's beers are usually pretty classy and unique. This is no exception. There are tastier specialty/novelty beers out there, but I still give Pecan Harvest high marks for creativity."
"Pours out a still maple syrup with a thin ""head."" Smells of toasty malts with faint fruity esters and nuts. There's a hint of manure in the nose. Flavor is of toast, faint fruit, just a hint of nuts (probably some kind of ""placebo"" from knowing that there are pecans in this), and a dose of graininess. Really, the only thing remotely pecan about this is the ending astringency much like after eating a pecan that still has some of the less-edible parts attached to the nut. Body is solid, oily, and has stinging bubbles. Pretty disappointed in this one and was hoping for more of a pecan character."
"D: Well, that was a let down. I was really hoping this was going to be full and flavorful. Instead, its watery and boring. Shucks."
"Presentation: Packaged in a short twelve-ounce bottle with a twist-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"Let this brew warm up! Nothing at all wrong with it, just a little underwhelming. I was hoping for more nuts.... I would still buy this at least a few times a year if I had access to it. Cheers Dave, and thanks again."
"D - Not bad but a little bland...would like something a bit more bold. Nut notes come through but barely."
"Overall, not a bad beer but not one I would seek out. Whatever Abita intended the pecans to do, they need to boost it a lot to get it across better."
"... which makes the beer a little less drinkable than it could be. Tone down the bubbbles, ramp up the flavor and add a touch of sweetness and we'd be in business."
"Single bottle bought at City Wide in South Bend. Pecan beer....um..ok. Label description has too mnay nut-related puns on it for my taste. Pours red and brown with yellow hints. Thin white head with weak lacing. Looks kind of oily. Smalls nutty, somewhat. Also has a kind of gross old garbage odor and malt-liquory alcohol notes. Not much flavor in the attack. Some bitterness and caramel. Pecan rises briefly along with a reasonable maltiness in the middle but that fades to a memory and all I'm left with is an ethanol tang like i just took a big old swig of Colt 45. Mouthfeel is thin and oily. It occurs to me as i drink this that Abita needs to take advantage of their brewpub when they get the urge to brew a beer with Pecans or some other crazy thing. Brewpub patrons love to get something odd and off the wall, even if it doesn't taste very good. But apparantly they decided they would bottle some of the brewpub beers. Bad move. This beer is a muddled loser of a drink."
"Poured into a pint mug, this beer is an orange-amber color with the slightest of heads. It's a bit hazy, also. Nose is malty, with a pleasant nuttiness. Tastes quite a bit similar to the Abita Amber, with a slightly toasty, nutty malt (not identifiably pecan to my taste buds), enough bitterness to offset any sweetness and dry out the finish a bit, and a lightly fruity yeast character. Nice well-carbonated but creamy texture."
"Drinkability - could be better. Kudos to them for actually using nuts instead of an artificial flavoring but I'm not enough of a fan to recommend it."
"A good effort but needs retooling in my book. It's almost llike they started with the nuts and tried to build a beer around it instead of the other way around. Back to the drawing board."
"All in all I enjoyed this beer. Different for sure, and that is great for the beer world. Nice job!"
"Slightly watery although the carbonation is not overdone. Overall, a highly drinkable if uninteresting offering from Abita. A neat idea, though."
"Drinkability: Comes across as a true ""harvest"" fall ale. Would drink again."
"D - Not something that is extremely drinkable for me. It is more of a novelty and an experiment gone wrong. Not sweet like a pecan pie, just kind of off in flavor and feel. The smell and taste remind me of musty foot odor if I had to pick something to compare it to -wet basement."
"Overall this was a pretty decent beer, I did like it much better than the amber that Abita puts out, I could not really taste the pecan taste but it did have a nut taste to it. I was pretty impressed with this one as before the Amber was okay, it was a last resort type beer. Overall this did make me want to try the other beers that Abita puts out."
"Stay away from this one."
"Dont drink and review."
"When poured out, this beer was dark brown in color. The head was weak probably due to the high amount of oils in this beer. The aroma was very nutty, which tended to mask any trace of malt or hop aroma, if present. The taste is initially nutty, but quickly fades. The beer itself felt very limp on the tougue, suggesting a light body which probably explains the dry finish and overall flavor. A beer is always supposed to have you want to drink more, and I just did not have that with this brew."
"Really nice treat. Pours a golden/orange, and quite surprisingly cloudy...alomst like a wheat! Very nice smell, of...whatta you think?...nuts. Tastes much like a handful of pecans with a nice smooth ale added to the mix. Very smooth, tasty, and highly recommended, especially for the time of year. This is a one-shot treat, brewed just once, so I'd say give it a try. I don't think you'll be disappointed! Nice one, Abita! Cheers and SAAAALUTE my BA friends!"
"Overall a tasty and easy drinking brown ale."
"Overall, I think the complexity of the beer makes it worth a try. Although, I probably would not go beyond that."
"With all that being said, I'll say that I still think this is a pretty quaffable beer. The thin body makes it go down pretty easy and that pecan taste is pretty good if your into the nutty tasting browns thing. I personally think that you could do worse during this Fall drinking season."
"This beer poured with a translucent copper brown body and a two inch off white head that dissipates quickly leaving no lace. The smell is faint with toasted malts a slight roastedness and hints of nuttiness. The flavor is a combination of caramel malts and toastyness with hints of nuts that are presumable from the pecans. Overall, I find this flavor more enjoyable than the average brown. The mouthfeel is a bit thin with sharp carbonation but a decent body. It is a nice brown, Certainly drinkable, but it would seem as if my taste buds lend me more towards the hoppy and nutty browns."
"D: The back label raves about this beer being ""wonderful paired-up with both red meats and seafood - and...with nuts, too."" Seeing as we have three more bottles, we'll give it a try paired with food next time. As is, it's a mildly interesting, though ultimately underwhelming brew. Worth a try."
"D- Very drinkable, but would you want to? Worth a try."
"D: A good beer, glad I tried it, certainly something new, but at $8.69 a six-pack it's a little pricey, probably won't go back to it unless I can find a single."
"Taste is a not very sweet malt, a nuttiness that almost gives it a bitter flavor and a slight caramel/molassas taste. Pretty aggressive carbonation and a full mouthfeel."
"It was actually called ""Abita Pecan Harvest Ale"". It poured with about 1.5 fingers of a foamy, tawny head with decent retention throughout. The nose was malty-sweet with a caramel-like quality to it. The color was a lovely deep-amber with NE-quality clarity. Mouthfeel was medium with a good bit of sweetness on the tongue. The finish had a definite nutty/bitter characteristic. I was glad that I did a the label directed and cracked one open."
"Scored a bottle of this while in Mass. Poured a nice reddish-amber color. Aroma was strong and malty but I could not detect any hint of pecan, despite the label's claims. When I tasted this ale though, it started out nutty and finished with a nice bitter aftertaste. Sometimes smell is not enough. Regardless, this ale is definitely drinkable and I look forward to sampling other beers from Abita."
"This is interesting stuff to say the least. Literally a ""nut"" brown ale. Not bad."
"An ale brewed with Louisiana Pecans, sounds interesting. 12oz twist-off bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a medium colored amber with a large off-white head that leaves a great deal of lacing around the edge of the glass. The aroma is dry and nutty with some toasted malts. The smell is perfect for a nice autumn day.The taste starts out smooth and malty and finishes with a dry and nutty finish. Overall, this is one of the better Abita beers that I have tried."
"MK"
"A pecan harvest ale something different to try,poured a beautiful rich amber/brown with a tight formed well sustained 1/2 white head very nice to look at.Very muted aromas a little of the nuttiness imparted from the pecans and a touch of caramel not much hop presence to be had,mild but ""nice"" flavors a little nutty and on the drier side with some biscuit qualities a bit of residual earthiness in the finish.Nothing remarkable about this beer but its food friendly and has a little flavor."
"D-This is a tasty drink. Better than the fallfest."
"Mouth feel is sort of creamy...not too thin and not too heavy. Pretty much appropriate for an American Brown, not giving itself into becoming sticky and cloying like you might expect from something that reminds you of praline candy."
"Beer is a nice amber color. Slightly off white head. NO trace of lace again."
"Drinkability: Altogether dull and dreary. I've gotten stronger nuttier flavors from non-nut beers. Even as I finish drinking this beer, the thumb points... down!"
"When I think about a Pecan Harvest Ale, I think of a maltly nutty rich favor to mix with my turkey dinner. I'm still looking for the malty flavor. This beer starts beautifully, with a pour that bring a nice head to light. The head fades much too quickly to become a shadow of itself. The nose is non-descript. The body is light to go with a beer charterized by a the right look of a fall leaves, in tones of orange/reddish colors. The flavors are only so-so, lacking the warmth I expected, and the mouth feel is that of an over carbonated finish with a ""slight' hop aftertaste. Let's go back to the drawing board."
"A light-bodied, refreshing brew that achieves it's goal of a pecan brew remarkably well! Fresh pecans with a bittersweet backing. Unique - nice to see a well-beer made with local character!"
"D: This is a decent beer. It's as I scored it - completely average. Drinkable, absolutely. This would likely make a great session beer."
"Drinkability: a nice offering from the usually tame Abita beers we are used to drinking. This was a simple pleasure - easy to drink and flavorful. Get some of this."
"Drinkability: OK, but worth a try just due to its unusual nature; not something I would seek out again"
"D: Extremely drinkable and not surprisingly wonderful with a handful of salty peanuts and hazelnuts- would have even been better if pecans were available."
"Pours copper with a thin white head. A bit of retention,and a decent lacing. Smell is sweet and buttery. Nice,but a bit weak. Body is medium and carbonated. Taste Is of bread,and butter,with a hint of carmel,and nut. Again,nice,but a bit weak. Still worth a try."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and kind of slick. Goes down easily. An interesting brew but ultimately doesn't really grab me. Worth a try on a single though and a cool concept as I always like to see something different."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Crisp and alive, becoming smoother and foamy as my glass reluctantly empties. This is an unbelievably rewarding tasting, as I have just discovered possibly the greatest session beer currently available in the U.S. today. This drinks so effortlessly, and it's got everything a great social beer should... probably a low ABV, a soft, round flavor profile, and exquisite balance with a dry finish. I *love* this beer."
"Poured with an attractive copper color that didnt have much head and did not retain it for very long. Aroma is not very strong, but earthy, with faint nuttiness to it. Did not leave much lacing on glass. Taste is also earthy with slight pecan flavor. Mouthfeel was good and despite average flavor, this beer is very drinkable."
"d - very high and i really like this one a lot. could become a go to fall session beer for me."
"Pours a copper to light caramel brown in color, clear, with a small off white head that quickly fades away. Aroma is subtle with hints of sweet brown sugar maltiness and grassy notes and freshly cracked nut shells. Taste is a light caramel malt sweetness with nutty tones riding with it, this is cut by a good sized grassy drying bitter bite. Nice pecan flavor in the drying aftertaste. Mouthfeel is light to medium, nice hop presence in the aftertaste. Good marks on drinkability, the nut flavor that is present is quite light but is very pleasant and is just enough to differentiate it from other browns, hop balance keeps it nice and refreshing. Thanks Ding for the opportunity."
"This one is not bad overall, the pecan notes that are in the mix make for a nice twist on the style, and even there this one seems to fall a bit in between the brown ale and amber ale styles, although it certainly leans more toward the former. Worth a shot if you see it."
"Easy to drink. A solid beer - Not going to blow you away, but good flavor and nicely balanced. Good session brew."
"single bottle from Whole Foods Raleigh"
"I poured this beer from the bottle to a 50 degree tumbler. The color was kinda orange with a fine bubbly head that decayed pretty fast. The looked slightly cloudy to me and I thought the smell was terrible and can't quite describe it other than it stunk. The beer had a slighly nutty taste but not overbearing. I thought the beer was actually pretty good and would like to try one on tap."
"Pours a clean orange-ish copper color with an off white head. Aromas that start sweet, and a dry nuttiness. In the taste, sweet brown sugar and it tastes a bit nutty. A sweet mouthfeel, with a dry nutty aftertaste. Tastes more like a brown ale, yet a bit too sweet, but ok."
"Pours amber with small white head which disapates quickly. Flavor is a mix of pale and amber ale notes with mild malt, a little toffee and a nutty, toasted biscuit center. Real pecans give it a nice nutty sweet finish. Very well balanced, the light hopping compliments the smooth malt taste perfectly. A great autumn beer."
"This beer isn't going to knock your socks off with tons of malt or a huge amount of flavor from the pecans, but it is a very well balanced and very enjoyable offering from Abita."
"The mouth is pleasantly thickish. Easy enough drinker. This would be an easy beer to pair with cheese & crackers and of course nuts."
"Youd be nuts not to try this one out!"
"This is not a bad beer. Certainly a fine alternative to all the oktoberfests on the shelves right now (although, admittedly, I'm a sucker for oktoberfest beers). I like to see a quality brewery like Abita venturing out into the lesser known styles. This is a fine addition to their annual repertoire, in my opinion. Cheers."
"A different beer and completely different than what I envisioned. Not sure if it's a good or bad thing, either way it's an easy drinking ale. Thin mid palate leads into a flavorful finish. Pecan shows nicely on the finish and is very smooth with moderate carbonation. Dried berries aren't to be found as the nose suggested but there is a tine bit of praline. Nearly bone dry with what I'd suspect to be less than 1% RS. An easy drinker that impressed more than I though it would"
"As is this is a run of mill ale with some very interesting pecan undertones, but I think it could be much more..."
"A rather straight-forward brown with less pecan nuttiness than I had hoped for. Regardless, it's a drinkable brew that would be a sessionable choice for a fall seasonable. Worth a look, especially as an alternative for the tsunami of pumpkin beers that are flooding the shelves."
"Recommended"
"As far as browns go, its pretty good. No real pecan feel or flavor in this one. Maybe I was expecting too much. I think the six I purchased will quench my thirst of this one, but I dont think I will revisit this one after that."
"This beer poured a burnt orange/brown color with a thick head  tight bubbles. It had an initially sweet smell with a bouquet of nuts in the background. The taste is malty and sweet with the nut flavor apparent. The mouthfeel is medium bodied. Also, the carbonation is quite noticeable. Overall, this is an easy drinking beer and it leaves no doubt it is an Abita (I grew up in the area, and there is just something in their beer that is common to them all  you know it is theirs)."
"Drinkability- This wasn't a bad beer. It was way too close to their Abita Amber though so I wasn't impressed that much. They should have down a pumpkin beer instead. If it was anything like the Strawberry harvest it would have rocked."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: A little too light on the palate for my taste, just feels like tonic water on the flat side. Leaves a slick feeling on the tongue. This beer is easy to drink, however I'll probably not be buying this one again. It doesn't stand out, nothing special about it. Sure I'd drink one, but I don't think that I'd pay for a pint of this."
"A new find in the Central Kentucky region. Although catagoried as a Pecan Ale, Brown Ale; the lable calls this brew the Pecan Harvest, and is probably more accurately placed in the Fruit / Vegitable catagory. The beer opens with medium intensity Amber Ale notes, with perhaps a more pronounced emphasis on rich nutty character and a hint of butter pecan. The look is a bright golden / copper color that lands on the 'brown' side of balance. Tastes also very Amber Ale-ish with the same mild hint of buttery nuts. Lightly hopped and moderately malted, the beer lacks to standout with any distinguishable qualities. Feels a touch light on the palate, leaving way for a mild astingency to come through (may come from nut flavor additions). Light diacityl on the toung with a light buttery note. Finishes with an increasing bitter bite and a medium sweet feel. Not bad but I was hoping for more pecan flavor and character."
"Overall, a decent beer, but nothing special. It has a nice flavor, but is not adventuresome as i would want in a limited beer. It just tastes too much like their others, and frankly boring. Worth trying though."
