The stamp is partially missing. i never had that problem with the stickers. Anywho, this is another quality beer from Jolly Pumpkin. They rarely disappoint.

However, it all seems to slowly work towards a common goal of good taste and whatnot, as the cocoa and spices blend into the base brown ale more or less behind the scenes, and the funk slowly, but surely trails off by the end.

The aroma could be summed up in one word, sour, but there are other minor notes that one can detect like wood, tart apples or cherries, and a touch of sweetness. The beer has a mix of these sweet and sour notes and I tend to gravitate towards these rather than traditional sour ales so this beer was mighty fine to me. Sour, tart cherries (still think I picked up apple) along with a touch of sweet malt balance together and go down smooth in a woody, oaky body. All in all an interesting and easy to drink beer.","clayrock81","Apr 28, 2014"

4.1,3.5,4,4,4,4,4.5,"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 11/30/2010. Pours lightly hazy reddish copper color with a nice 2-3 finger dense and fluffy light khaki head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of tart apple, cherry, lemon, orange peel, pepper, clove, cinnamon, toast, cocoa, hay, grass, leather, funk, light vinegar, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt, spice, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of tart apple, cherry, lemon, orange peel, cocoa, toast, pepper, clove, hay, grass, cinnamon, leather, funk, light vinegar, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of earthy/spicy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of green apple, cherry, lemon, orange peel, cocoa, toast, pepper, clove, cinnamon, hay, funk, light vinegar, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of malt, spice, and yeast ester flavors; with a great malt/spice/tartness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a fairly creamy, crisp, and slightly acidic mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent wild brown ale! All around great balance and complexity of malt, spice, and yeast flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Beers"

You must understand however, this is far from an ""American Brown Ale"". It may have started as a brown ale with some caramel and Munich-type malts, but the oak barrel aging and wild yeast strains have turned this beer into a full-fledged American wild ale... funky, dry, and mildly tart - characteristic of many beers being churned out by Jolly Pumpkin.","tectactoe","Aug 21, 2013"

This is a decent brown with sour flavor but feel and aroma are slightly better than the taste with decent drinkability but alcohol is noticeable.","Slatetank","May 18, 2013"

Taste of cherries, orange pith and apple skins, again, like the aroma, tart, but not overly so, sour, but not lip-puckering, oak and leafiness, tannins, citrus, and light spice with the lightest dusting of cocoa powder.

I would have this again.","Huhzubendah","Sep 05, 2011"

Somewhat cloudy w/ good carbonation and great lacing. Nose is that of yeast, malt, cinnamon, orange, some funk. Very subtle nose, but really nice and balanced/complex. Taste is similar, although the cocoa makes an appearance, and the malt/funk really come out more. Very nice. Feel is fairly carbonated, with a battle between the funk and malt. Overall, this is a really unique and excellent brew. I would definitely buy and enjoy this again.","jayhawk73","Sep 03, 2011"

There are some very daring notes in this beer, and it all comes from a very balanced yeast profile. This beer is not too funky at all, but the funk paints a most complex picture over somewhat familiar sensations. This brew the work of an alchemist. The yeast is the star, where everything is influenced by its presence. Is that a familiar sweetness I taste? No, it's stewed tomatoes. Oh a nice salty sensation from the yeast, or is that green Olives?...wait, I mean Black? Ugh. That's how this beer goes. A wonderfully controlled chaos of complexity.","Cavery","Jul 11, 2011"

4.08,3,5,4.5,4,4,3.5,"Reviewing this as a BSDA is kinda weird as it is rather funky. Very carbed big puffy billowing slightly off white head. Actual puffy lacing on the glass. Deep amber red to brown color and it is opaque. Nice lactic sourness married with some spice and earth notes. Little bit of wood barrel is present too. The flavor is very unique, a blend of spice and sour. I can pick out the cacao, and maybe some allspice, and others which blend with the typical JP sour notes. Again I can detect some of the barrel flavor. Nice deep malty base backs all these complex flavors up well. Even for a well attenuated beer Maracaibo has nice body. Again not what I expect from a BSDA, but I knew what to expect as it is JP, pretty damn good beer, just not a BSDA. I'll have it again.","pmlondrigan","Jul 08, 2011"

Who doesn't like good head? Aroma has some Belgian funk/sourness, although this one is from Dexter, Michigan. Flavor is a little sour too, not in a bad way per say, just hoping it does not dominate. And it does not for long. As my palate gets used to the sour and/or it warms, the complexity of this brew starts to come forth. The spices, etc make for an interesting and enjoyable mix with the sour back drop. Thoroughly enjoyed this one on the deck grilling some chicken. This was my first offering from Jolly Pumpkin, looking foward to more.","AngusOg","Jun 15, 2011"

The middle of which settles to half an inch leaving a ridiculous 1/4 inch thick sheet of lace on the glass. Smell: a lot of spices upfront, sort of peppery but also pie spices - cinnamon and something else? A whiff of cocoa, brown sugar, slight lemon rind component. Not quite hay/barnyard but you can tell it's going to get funky...warms a bit and you're there. Taste: barnyard funkiness, citrus rind, a bit cidery, cinnamon, brown sugar. Sweet, heavy on the spices, a bit funky with a light sourness. Nov release so has about 6 months on it. Interesting and would be a huge step up from the usual slate of spiced and pumpkin beers that come out in the fall. Batch 349.","babaracas","Beers"

This is followed by some nice bready malts and a decent amount of funk. Very pleasant smell. Taste starts out with a bit of mustiness, followed by tart green apple. Also got a bit of cocoa on the aftertaste, which was interesting and perfect for fall. Taste also includes some definite breadiness and a bit of orange as well. This is easily one of the more complex tasting Jolly Pumpkin beers I have had. Mouthfeel is nice; pretty light and highly carbonated.

The aromas immediately conjur memories of Belgian strong ales I've previously had. Bold scents of sour and spice warm my nose. As I drink a moderate amount of lacing follows the beer down the side of the glass. The sourness from the nose is accentuated by touches of citrus and tart. The beer is thin and smooth but not watery. The bitter, sour and citrusy flavors linger at the back and sides of my mouth. Surprised that the cacao was almost absent from the beer, as it was highlighted on the bottle. Could be that I was expecting something I shouldn't have been from that description.

The head sticks around for a long time, and there's a good amount of lacing left on the glass. Aroma is dark fruit, cinnamon, pears and some funk. The brew tastes like peppery spice, tart lemons and pears, orange peel, dark fruit and yeasty funk. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a little bit creamy and sticky and is also well carbonated. The soft carbonation helps make this beer smooth and easy to drink. I think this is a good brew, it's nice and enjoyable.","bluejacket74","Feb 19, 2011"

Taste is very Jolly Pumpkin like as well. I get a lot of citrus and orange peel as well as tasty spices. I get a lot of pepper in the finish. There is some nice barnyard funk to this beer as well, along with sour Brett flavors. I didn't know a beer that was slightly sour and very spicy could taste this good. Although not an extremely high ABV beer, the alcohol definitely makes itself known in the taste. Mouthfeel is full bodied and flavorful with high carbonation.

Taste follows scent and likewise is fairly bold for Jolly, there is a nice underlying beer below the funk and tart and those qualities actually take a back seat when they usually star in their beers.

The funk and tartness make it an American Wild, and in that context, it was wonderful. Having looked thru the JP website after trying this beer at the Peekskill Brewery (a thumbs up for that place!!), my impression is that JP is really pushing the envelope. They appear to be true non-conformists and are exploring some really extensive boundaries with their brewings.

It's supposed to be a brown ale with cacao and spices, inspired by the monastic brews of Belgium. Instead, it's a bombastic brew for a brown ale. It's sour. I'm not getting any cacao, nor any spices..it's sourness is overwhelming to me. I don't like saisons or farmhouse styles, so, this is especially disgusting to me. $12.00 for the bomber, and only one glass. The rest goes down the drain.

It seems there is a balance between the sour fruit and the intense spice but no hop presence or bitterness that I missed. Still, this is a beer to savour, the delicate interplay between the sour and the spice, with a tart finish, is very enticing and a taste experience. Very dry too.

Background sweets accompanied by a light orange flavor and a touch of clove or maybe cinnamon. Nice carbonation and overall mouthfeel. This is a subtle brew, and if there was one knock, it would be that the taste is kinda hollow. Like there's something missing. I guess I'm looking to be smacked in the face with cacao or something, but all I get is restrained balance. But, you can make a case that it was intended that way, and I'd bet that it was.

Smells like a Flemish sour ale laced with oranges, black pepper, a bit of powdered cocoa, and dusty yeast notes. The ale is fairly sour in on the tongue, with nice orange, lemon, and pepper notes that build to a rather dry, earthy and powdered yeast plus cacao finish. Don't expect much chocolate flavor, as the spicing tends much more towards orange and lemon except in the after-taste. Body is medium-rich, with plenty of carbonation.

I can't really detect the cacao and I might not have noticed the hint of orange peel if the label hadn't mentioned it, but there's still a lot going on here. It finishes with a nice, sharp, tartness.

This one poured a cool rasberry color (light for this style) with a small white lace heading. In the nose were smells of tart rasberry, gummi bear and faint chocolate. Taste was puckering on the palate like a Belgian Lambic. Specific tastes such as rasberry and sour apples come to mind. Mouthfeel was medium in body. I probably will end up finishing the bottle of this. The sour notes are there, but not too overpowering. This might be the most out there interpretation of this style to have crossed my palate yet. It definitely has Lambic traits, yet is also like a Belgian dark ale in the chocolate notes. Whoever said this brewery was good was not lying. I want to try all of their beers now.

Lovely. Taste starts with acidic blasts of sourish citrus, Brett, and vinegar. Light toasted malt, cookie, and some caramel notes mid-palate. Sour, drying zest never goes far.

4,1,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured into my Duvel chalice from a 750 ml bottle...appears a deep ruddy amber hue with a large beige foamy head dwindles leaving behind fine lacing evenly around the glass. Aroma contains perfumey oak notes with tart lactic brett funk, spicing is evident but hard to pick apart and I'm not sure what type of sweetness cacao brings to the mix. Flavor is incredibly complex yet finishes in a combonation between the oak barrel aging effects and the funky wild yeast notes very barnyard with a diverse mix of sweet, tart, and bitterness very interesting brew. Jolly pumpkin beers all share common characterisitics for sure, but this one is somewhere in the middle of how well all flavors are expressed. I'm a fan but Oro and La Roja kick this one to the curb so far I've tasted Luciernaga (favorite), La Blanche, Bam Biere and this one is in the middle. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with somewhat effervescent carbonation and really sticks around with a dry finish a bit ciderish with the tartness.

3.7,-6.6,4,4,3.5,3,4,"Originally reviewed on June 2, 2006.Aroma is a flow of light sour wooden oaked oranges and brown sugars, with floating esters, touches of flaming warmth, lechees and hints of cinnamoned pears. Delicate, enticing and all around fantastic. Pour of lightly hazed ruddied mahogany with a creamy soaping head of off-white. Flavor is a concentrated heavy cheese of oak and tannins. Dusty. Tart lemons over dusty horsebarn. Sour in a good way, but not really possessing the gentle coconut or pineapple. Stalks of green rhubarb coated with white sugar and eaten raw. A husk of faint chocolate. Flavor develops as beer builds. Tounge develops resistance, then follows new path, with a run of sliced green apples and monterey jack cheese. Spice with a hint of ginger and light lime peel. Body is impressive, with good levels of sweetness, but not too attenuated. Perfect level of drinkability. A kick of light dry hopness on the backend for balance. Not really a Dubbel in my book, more suited to a Brett Belgian Ale. Unfortunately, itÂ’s as if they took a very nice spiced Dubbel or Brown ale, then ruined it with Brett, but the Brett still tastes good.","CharlesDarwin","Dec 07, 2006"

Very sweet up front, and sour towards the end. Toward the end it takes on a sour apple feel. Although I've not tried it, I bet a year of cellaring would make add to the complexity of the flavors.

4.35,9.8,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Cloudy toffee colour with a short, light brown head. Some lacing, excellent retention. Pleasant aromas of malty toffee, nutmeg, and tart fruit. The flavour has a rich fruit character, with a bit of apple and sour cherry to add depth to the tartness. Toffee is also evident, as well as some bitter chocolate. Medium bodied, medium/high carbonation with a creamy texture. This is very drinkable and well balanced. Another winner from JP.","DrJay","Apr 27, 2006"
4,1,4,4,4,3,4.5,"Drinkability & Notes Â– The only thing standing in the way of me drinking this quickly is the high carbonation, other than that the light body and sourness makes this one rather refreshing for 7.5% abv. I wish it was a bit sweeter and a bit fuller, other than that its an interesting, well crafted beer to be sure. Not at all what I was expecting from this Â“Special Brown Ale Brewed with Cocoa Nibs and Spices,Â” more of a Flanders Oud Bruin than a Dubbel in my opinion, so thats what I'm treating it as.","OldSock","Apr 24, 2006"
4.82,21.7,4.5,5,5,4.5,4.5,"Beautiful, tight head. Cloudy, reddish-brown. Tart aroma yielding to leather, coriander, vanilla, cherry & toffee. Firm, soft structure from bottle condition. Malty flavor lingers on, demonstrating lightly roasted malt, spices, and dried fruit. Very long, wonderfully complex finish. Tremendous balance & restraint, beguiling complexity. Wonderful beer.","ktel","Apr 22, 2006"
4,1,4,4,4,4,4,"Aroma is very spicy with some citrus and funky notes and a sweetish malt base beneath. Red tinted brown in color with a firm, thumb thick tan head. Fore is very spicy..almost hot with a rich and sweet..almost creamy..maltiness. Mild chocolate notes..stronger caramel notes and some citrus and winter beer like spices. Has a vinous quality that is more feel than flavor. The body has a very pleasing texture. Also has some toasty notes and some Baltic Porter raisin and plum notes. Just a ton going on flavor wise, but meanwhile the overall flavor doesnÂ’t strike me as a flavor bomb...itÂ’s mellow except for the finish which coats the tongue in the added cacao. It very much reminds me of a cross between StoneÂ’s VE 03 and 05. Ron has brewed up another beer that challenges the drinker.","Jredner","Apr 11, 2006"
4.25,7.3,4,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,"750 ml bottle. Pours a murky brown color, with a solid 2-3 fingers of head over top that really has staying power. Very dense foam. Clarity is okay, slightly hazt but light still makes it through. Carbonation is not apparent. Nose is very nice. Solid notes of brown sugar sweetness laced with some musty and sour to acetone sweet notes, with a healthy Belgian spiceyness to round it out. There is a lot going on, but nothing really dominates, letting the whole spectrum shine through. Flavor is very nice. Definately has the Jolly Pumpkin character that I am a fan of. Initial sip brings just the slightest pucker that moves to a full on sour tinge after swallowing. This is followed by a slight mustyness. The beer itself then starts to appear as a light brown sugar and light raisin with tons of spice that really lingers into the finish. I really like the interplay of the sour and funky start to the beer and the solid sweet and spicey finish. Its a very interesting dichotomy. Feel is moderate with a light carbonation of find bubbles. It does not have a whole lot to the body, and I could handle just a bit more, but its not bad. Drinkability is pretty good. I really enjoy letting a little time go between sips, as I think it lets the full range of flavors come through. This is an excellent brew. I liken it to a cross between a Dubbel and a flanders red and an oud brune.","kmpitz2","Apr 10, 2006"
3.83,-3.3,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Rich burgundy. Low level, filmy head. Spicy, floral nose with an enormous barrel contribution giving a strong cocunut character, combined with a touch of rose petal, cinnamon, orange peel and light yeast. Flavor is full of fruit and spice. This seems to be a bit overly spiced, and the cocunut barrel aged notes really toned down throughout the session and it was very fitting initially. Fairly light in body as well. Still very unique and very tasty, and it demonstates the Jolly Pumpkin house character very well.","Crosling","Apr 09, 2006"
4.42,11.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"This is quite the tasty tipple, it is a bit rich and satisfying, with lots of malt character to round things out. The balance that this beer has is what really sets this beer apart; all of the flavors just integrate so well, with none dominating over the other. The mix of funky Brett character, light tartness, sweet malt, fruit notes, and integrated spicing just works so well here.","Gueuzedude","Apr 08, 2006"

4.55,14.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"This poured with a very nice, thick, deep-tan head that evidenced decent retention throughout. The color was deep brown with garnet highlights. The nose had a light brett-driven mustiness overlain with a chocolaty smell such as what hangs over Hershey, PA on a production day, only lighter in this beer. The mouthfeel was full and thick, bursting with effervescence. I got a cocoa-like flavor on the tongue and the same on the finish, but accompainied by brett in the latter. Man, I am in love with the Pumpkin!","woodychandler","Feb 24, 2006"
4.42,11.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Typical of Jolly Pumpkin in that they take a terrific style of beer and improve it. What would be a solid Belgian-style Brown Ale, became a balances sweet/tart, malty/vineous, woodsy/clean Sour Brown. Spicy and sweet from the right from the start, but quickly evolves into an under-rippened berry tartness, shrarply acidit and with dusty must with Flander's Red-like acetic sourness, toasty malt, and peppercorn bite. Lightly hopped for added bitterness and earthy grass notes. Amazingly holds onto a light toast (almost cocoa) flavor and firm creaminess despite the alcohol and modest astringency. Another true challenge for the tastebuds. An amazingly well crafted Sour Brown ale that draws inspiration from Belgium but made in America.","BEERchitect","Feb 14, 2006"

Lots of delicate sticky lacing all around the glass, beautiful! Strong aromas of fruits and cider. This brew also has a sour, woody smell to it. Taste is great, fruity, sweet, sour and some tartness. There is alot going on in there. Finishes slightly dry. Full bodied brew with plenty of carbonation. Easy to drink, with the perfect amount of alcohol. Jolly Pumpkin continues to amaze me with their offerings! I'm so lucky to have this brewery so close to home. I must pay them a visit soon! Great job!!!

3,-24.2,4,4,2.5,4,2,"Overall, another interesting artisan beer from Jolly Pumpkin. As I said above, I think the flavour is unique and depthy but too abrasive.

3.62,-8.6,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Taste: The first Jolly pumkin ale I sampled didn't do it for me taste-wise, too boozy, this one was a lot better. It did have plenty of alcohol that started to get a little harsh towards the end, but the vanilla flavors, along with the roasted grain and candy sugar gave it a velvetty, almost buttery taste. The dry, wood-aged hard liquor finish reminded me of Marc de Bourgogne, the french equivalent of scotch (grapes used instead of barley).","Goldorak","Nov 06, 2005"
3.85,-2.8,4,4,3.5,4.5,4,"Deep amber pour, topped by an off-white cover offering slight lacing. Intense spicy scents punctuate the candyish and cocoa induced, yeast cake. Interesting toasted malts come out in full sweet mode, combining with the yeast to offer banana esters and marzipan plus peachy flavours. Considerable alcohol shows through in mouth, in a rather vinous way. More toasted oak and chocolate character appear well distributed, but the pairing with the alcohol is a bit heavy at this point. Barky, rooty, could use a few months to mellow. Light-medium bodied, extremely soft and smooth, comfortable texture, typical of JP, though obviously thinned by the barrel sojourn. Highly diplomatic barrelling flavour disposition, acting as a soft, pillowy complement, perhaps adding a vanilla touch.","Rastacouere","Nov 03, 2005"
4.33,9.3,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Jolly Pumpkin scores a winner here. Totally quaffable brew. Poured out to a cloud brown color reminiscent to apple cidar. A small, thin layer of brownish cream foam covers the top of the glass. Aromas of fruit, sweet yeast, mild roasted malts and some pepper and spices. Nice. Taste is complex and nearly perfect; flavors of unsweetened caramel, malt, sweet yeast and bread, raisins and dark fruits swell in the mouth and blend wonderfully. Mouthfeel is smooth and mild, like a nut brown ale. Goes down very easy. Very good drinkability; this brew is a must have for windy fall nights or mild winter eves.

Head lasts excellently, leaving super-heavy foam fully coating the sides of the glass. Aroma is spicy and fruity, with some woody notes lurking about. Taste pretty much follows the nose, with the oak and alcohol contributing to warmth at and after the swallow. Mouthfeel is especially creamy, and drinkability is nice as well.

3.76,-5.1,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"From a 750ml bottle. Pours caramel in color and develops a large head that fills the glass. A whole hand's worth of head stays on top for minutes afterwards. Smell is sweet of caramel and chocolate. A slight grassy aroma. Taste is sweet with a high amount of alcohol flavor. Reminds me of some Unibroue products. Alcohol is numbing on the tongue. Like a burgundy wine. Tastes more like a wine or liquor than beer. A slight bit of bitterness that counteracts the sweetness. I don't detect much of the cacao nibs flavor in this. A fair amount of bourbon flavor perhaps from being aged in barrels. Once the bourbon flavor is discovered it becomes very noticeable. Bitterness seems to rise through the course of the glass. I wouldn't call this highly drinkable. I wouldn't expect to sip on more than one.","mjohn27603","Jun 24, 2005"
