"Dark brown in color with a fingernail of beige head.  Brussels lacing.  Aroma is of hazelnuts and amber malt.  The flavor is strongly comprised of hazelnuts and amber malt.  There might be some piney hops but they are overwhelmed by the hazelnut and amber malt intensity.  The mouth is very dry and crisp."
""
"Wanted to like this one but its too malt forward, more like an east coast IPA.  The nose is nice and has a nice nutty finish."
""

"Heres to 21 years of delicious beers and to 21 more..."

"This beer ironically was a 21st birthday gift. Brown ales have never been a favorite. Smell of coco, choclate, coffee and rich dark fruits. Decent mouthfeel, the hops are subtle but do complement the malts. Overall fair beer."
""
""
""
""
"No real standout flavors and seemed a little bland...mostly nut, burnt caramel and a faint coffee and even a little tobacco...good hop / malt balance but overall pretty flat, needed one of the flavors to stanc out more."

"This one defies categorization. ""Imperial India-Style Brown Ale""?  Imperial, yes.  Brown, very!  Not so sure about ""India-Style," except for the pic of the Taj Mahal on the label.  Nevertheless, a sturdy malt backbone with enough hop zing to beg repeated sips all the way through 22 ounces of a very interesting brew, quaffed from my trusty Southern Tier tulip.  Thank you, Avery, and Happy 21st Birthday!"

"Overall, a solid drinkable brew. Glad I am having this one on a cold winter's eve, it is pretty warming!"
"Had a 22 poured into my usual mug, my second review of an Avery beer. I found the color to be lighter than others, more of a chocolate brown with a lighter head than I would have expected. The taste was a mix of spices, rye bread, mad slight toffee notes. The flavor was actually fairly mild, which was surprising given the alcohol content. Pretty good, I guess I was expecting something a bit more robust."

"Imperial brown ale - a triumph. Plenty of malty bite with a hop twinge."
"Now Avery can order an Avery at the bar.  Anyway, this stuff pours a dark midnight amber-sienna topped by two fingers of khaki foam.  The nose comprises dry caramel, fig, dark bread, musty grapes, light treacle, and a vague mix of spices.  The taste mostly brings in more of the same, though the treacle is now bitterer, and there's a bit more stonefruit notes.  Not sure where any of these came from, given the style, but whatever, I guess.  The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish.  Overall, an interesting beer, to say the least.  Rather than a hoppy brown (I ain't callin' it an ""India Brown"" anything, daggummit!), I got something akin to a brown spiked with a healthy Belgian yeast and some spices.  Weird.  Not too bad, though..."

"O:  Probably a little too heavily hopped for a brown ale but this beer has it going on.  Even after almost seven months this beer still brings a lot of hop flavor.  There's still some solid complexity and the flavors are good as well.  Avery's yeast doesn't seem to attenuate very well so there is still a good amount of sweetness to this beer."
""
"Finishes with a dry, crisp, even bitter finish.  Not a bad beer and at times it was an enjoyable hoppy beer, but the malts and hops never really come together and it's just an alright beer."

"Overall a superior dry, hoppy ale."
""
""
"Overall: Avery makes my favorite Imperial IPA , Maharaja, and this anniversary beer is just as good...actually, it's better. It's very similar to the Maharaja, but with some hearty toastiness that brings more balance to the sweet and tangy, and also makes it perfect for colder weather or a cozy indoor evening. Ready to buy another bottle!"

"3.0 D:  Can't say I'm a fan of this.  I'll give it that it's better than most black IPAs, but it's still a grouping of flavors that don't work together."
""
""
""
"Overall: Monster of a beer, would buy it again as long as I can find it. Adds a twist to what a DIPA or Brown Ale should be and is especially a special hybrid which i will always carry in my heart. Cheers and enjoy... Salud!!"

"O- Just about every anniversary beer from these guys is awesome and this is no exception. Great malt/hop contrast.  Highly recommended."
"On tap at the Lark in East Northport, NY; pours very dark brown color with 2 finger foamy tan head that faded slowly and left really good foamy lacing and rings as it went down. Smells of molasses, brown sugar, piney hops, grapefruit, caramel, cocoa powder, roasted grains and coffee beans. Nice mix of malt and hops with good balance and roasted notes coming through the sweetness of the malt and hop aroma combo. Tastes like it smells, with molasses, toffee, brown sugar, piney hops, grapefruit, orange peel, citrus hops, caramel, cocoa powder, roasted grains, coffee bean, leafy spices like tea leaf and pepper. Very tasty, smooth and easy to drink, this was a lot more hoppy than most brown ales yet still maintained the nice malty base and rich sweetness that makes for a solid brown ale. Really good brew and very above average for the style."

"O - a very nice imperial brown ale. It seems American craft brewers have all but solidified the massive brown ale and made it their own yet keeping in tact the roots of what a brown ale is all about. This is a nice anniversary offering from one of my favorite breweries. Just a nice big imperial brown ale."

"This pour a nice brown/amber red color.  It's not porter level darkness.  Smell starts with citrusy, grapefruit hop flavors and then adds some roasted dark toasted smells, like you'd expect from a Brown.  The flavor is an intriguing mix of caramel, roasted nutty brown ale flavors with bright citrusy hops and bitterness.  It's not dissimilar from ""black IPAS"" or certain ""RED IPAs"" and really lands somewhere in the middle as a flavor profile.  It's a nicely made beer I would be happy to enjoy again."

"Deep brown color, good off-white head. Great hoppy aroma with notes of roasted malt. Roasted malt , citrus , grapefruit and strong bitterness in taste. Full body , medium carbonation. Long hoppy bitterness in aftertaste. Good black IPA."

"Not a bad beer for a big brown anniversary ale. Nothing other-worldly about this one, but tasty enough for a dark ale. Perhaps a little too tannic and astringent; a bit more malt sweetness may have really smoothed things out some, but it's still worth a visit."

"Reddish brown body wasn't the most attractive color for a beer, as it veered a little too close to a muddy Belgian Dubbel at first.  The head atop was however nicely proportioned at two finger thick, and the overall look grew on me in a short while.  The smell was a mix of chocolate, toffee, hops, and almonds, and was very inviting.  As anticipated, the taste was closely derived  from the smell, and I could get a complex medley of chocolate, some coffee, burnt toast, toffee, cherry, and then was hit with a load of hops mid palette.  It was more like an imperial porter than any kind of IPA derived brew, but whatever you call the style, it had a delicious flavor.  The body was surprisingly hefty for the ABV and the style, and the mouthfeel was  somewhere between silky and chewy.  The beer was different from what I expected, and better."

"Overall, I enjoyed it, and I could see drinking more than one of these in a row (but not two, because the strength will get to you). Nicely balanced! Worth seeking out before it's gone."
"overall - an interesting beer.  they didn't go crazy with the hops which in my opinion is a good thing."

"D: This was an ok brown ale, but the scent and taste and body were all not more than mediocre. The finish was a bit harsh, so it wasn't the easiest to drink. Disappointing for an anniversary brew."

"This starts with toasted malt flavors and no sweetness. The swallow draws out the aforementioned charred wood. The aftertaste is a combination of dark cherries and alcohol, almost like a cherries jubilee without any sugar. Fine bubbles in an otherwise thinnish body."

"Appearance is a dark brown with goilden edges and a finger of film that quickly receded down to a thin film resting on top of the liquid. The nose is both bready and hoppy. The flavor profile is tasty with a pleasant blend of bready malt and hop bitterness. However, the body on this offering is slightly light for the style."

"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 5/13/2014. Pours crystal clear deep reddish brown color with a 2 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, Aromas of grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, caramel, chocolate, toffee, toast, nuttiness, brown bread, floral, grass, light pine, and floral/toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of juicy citrus hops and moderate dark/toasted malt sweetness; with good strength. Taste of grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, caramel, chocolate, toffee, toast, nuttiness, brown bread, floral, grass, light pine, and floral/toasted earthiness. Fair amount of pine/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, caramel, chocolate, toffee, toast, nuttiness, brown bread, floral, grass, light pine, and floral/toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice robustness and complexity of juicy citrus hops and dark/toasted malt sweetness; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, lightly creamy, and fairly sticky/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice imperial brown IPA. All around good complexity and balance of juicy citrus hops and dark/toasted malt sweetness; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"This is delicious! All of the nice qualities of a Brown Ale, just bumped up a few abv points. I know this could be just as good with less alcohol but it IS an anniversary so I'll let that slide."
"Overall: A pretty good and interesting twist on a brown ale. Big toasty malt taste with an equally big hop presence. Tastes a lot like an imperial black IPA."
"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a very dark mahogany brown with a one finger light brown head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of dark malt with light toastiness, nuts, hints of chocolate, light citrus hops. Flavor starts with the same lightly toasted dark malt, nuts, a bit earthy and develops a strong lupelin flavor with light piney and citrus elements, finishing with strong hop bitterness. Medium bodied with a hint of creaminess in the finish. A nice earthy, toasted malt body, but it is overwhelmed by the bitterness of the hops, which seem to be all about alpha acids; very bitter, but with light herbal or fruit flavor elements. Perhaps a brown ale malt body is not sufficient for intense hopping, although some CDAs pull it off well. I did like this intense imperial brown ale, but there were moments when the hop bitterness was a bit aggressive. Interesting and a bit challenging. As I got used to the hopping, this grew on me quite a bit and I looked forward to the hop / malt interactions."

"O: An offbeat brown that ended up being pretty tasty. Very drinkable."
""
"This pours with a hearty deep brown hue and a thick almost cream like head. Light coffee nose, some chocolate malt but I get a strong cilantro, herb and hemp aroma. The flavor was described as ""herbaceous"" in the beertender notes and I have to agree. Some elements of a brown exist underneath ie coffee, chocolate malt, roast. The herbal notes are just too strong and spicy for my expectations of an Imperial Brown Ale."

"Pours a clear orange-brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. A foamy curtain of lace coats the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, burnt nut, caramel, and herbal hop aromas. Taste is much the same with burnt nut, caramel, herbal hop, and earth flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of hop and earth bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a low level of carbonation with an almost flat and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that has interesting burnt and earth qualities all around."

"O: This is a very hoppy brown ale - it's like a hybrid between a brown ale an IPA, except that the IPA-like hop bitterness wins out in the taste."
""
"10 ounce pour on tap at the West End Tap House on Tennyson. Dark brown color, short head. Smells hoppy, but of malts, definitely not an IPA though. Flavor was exactly what you'd expect: highly hopped brown and even though the ABV was high it was not noticeable at all really."

""

""

"O: High ABV is partilly hidden. Worth seeking out."
""
""

"Worth checking out- another solid beer from Avery."
"Resin dominant aroma, with notes of pine and grapefruit adding hop variety. Malt sweetness is more evident in flavor, fairly nutty, with contrasting onion, sharp citrus, and a lightly bitter, resinous finish. Decidedly hop dominant, the malt is fairly overshadowed. I'm not a fan of onion hops, so it's not my fave."
""

"O - Amarillo and Simcoe hops add a nice citrusy hoppy kick to this brown ale. Hopped up and tasty as hell. Try this one!"
"A delicious looking tan froth contrasts perfectly with the dark brown body of this brew. Caramel, brown bread and earthy hops flow even to the nose. Rich and creamy at the beginning with a dry finish that follows a palate pleasing profile of caramel, brown bread, fleeting notes of cherry and a hit of dark chocolate followed by a balancing hop bitterness. Medium bodied and tastes warm and inviting despite it's ABV. A real winner that will have the redcoats either running for shelter or joining the Continental Army."
"Toasty-dry in finish, the dark ale retains a moderate sweetness to balance the lightly roasted acidity and strong grassy, piney and citrusy bitterness. With mild alcohol warmth assisting to dry, the toasted elements overshadow any residual sweetness with ease."
""
"Overall: Great beer. Love a well done hoppy brown."
""
""
""
"Overall: For those vehemently demanding a bit more hops in their browns."
"I liked this, not sure it's a life changer, but this works as well as most black IPAs do. Well worth a go; drinks easy"
""
""
""
""
""

"D: overall a big hoppy brown that needs some refinement around the edges. the malt profile isn't married exactly with the hop bomb that this is, which is probably my biggest problem. not way off, but could use a little work, IMO."

"on tap at the kitchen in boulder, some sort of double ellies brown ale recipe, but this is next level stuff from avery. deep soilesque brown in color, rich and solid to light, frothy in head, tan, but well carbonated. looks gorgeous. the nose is a sweeter side of the dark malt, less roast, more marshmallow and molasses, a nice twist. sturdy beer, must have been a big mash. i pick up an almost corn sweetness too it, amongst all the earthy malt. shockingly dry though, really highly fermented, minimal residual sugar for the sweet nose. beautifully full body, rich enough for something like a rare lamb burger, but not zoo dominating that a bowl of creamed spinach soup cannot be appreciated. it takes a lot to find that feel in a strong dark beer. this shows no booze at all, and may be the crowning beer in this anniversary series, which has been nothing short of stunning on the whole. perfect food beer, burnt sugars in it make it a dessert in its own right, but something special about the feel. bitter enough, gorgeous."
"Overall, a decent hoppy brown."
"Overall: Something just isn't working for me with this beer. A bit disappointed by this beer, wouldn't recommend, not because it bad, just because there are better options for the price. I would recommend dogfish head's indian brown over this beer."
"O-This beer is a little odd, but I mostly enjoyed it. If you are expecting a nutty, chocolatey brown, you're in for a surprise because this thing is a hop bomb. That being said, the sweetness from the malts provides an interesting balance to the hops. An interesting mix of styles, but like a lot of hybrid beers, this one is fun for a while, but not a world-beater."
"O - Although I would not buy this again, it was a pleasant experience. This beer gives you the best of two worlds; the hoppiness that I've come to know from Avery and a malty, brown ale that I rarely drink. Well worth trying if you come across it or like this sort of thing."
""
"overall: Not overly excited by a ""barely"" imperial Brown but this is one finely crafted tasty brew."
""
""
"Overall a solid effort but nothing exceptional. A style hybrid that doesn't quite deliver on the imperial part of the billing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's kind of a hybrid ale with great traits of both hop-forward and malt-forward beers."
