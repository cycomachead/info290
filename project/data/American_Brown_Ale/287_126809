Taste is toffee-caramel lightly toasted hazelnuts, milk chocolate and earthy faintly chocolate milk sweet.  Hop keeps this malty dog dry and not overly sweet. Medium mouthfeel is quite creamy but at the same time bright and nearly effervescent, it holds together well. Well I'm glad I re-entered the planetary fray!  I had bowed out after the Venus debacle but hey, this is a great brown ale. 8% ABV!  Not a hint of that.","JackieTH","Mar 27, 2015"

Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a hazy chestnut brown color with about a half inch light tan head that stayed around a long time.  There's a decent amount of lacing.  Aroma is nice, the brew smells like chocolate, toffee, roasted malt, and some light floral hops.  I think the taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some dark breadiness and herbal bitterness noticeable too.  There's more bitterness than I expected, but that's not a complaint.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit coating with moderate carbonaton.  I think it's a nice brown ale, I liked it.  $12.99 a 6-pack.","bluejacket74","Mar 05, 2015"

Aromas of caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, brown bread, light cocoa, light nuttiness, herbal, light pine, and toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and light earthy hop notes; with decent strength. Taste of big caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, brown bread, light cocoa, light nuttiness, herbal, light pine, and toasted earthiness. Light herbal/roast bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, brown bread, light cocoa/nuttiness, light pine, and herbal/toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt and light earthy hop flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, creamy, and slightly sticky/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice imperial brown ale style. All around good complexity and robustness of dark/bready malt and light earthy hop flavors; and very smooth to drink for the ABV. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 28, 2015"
