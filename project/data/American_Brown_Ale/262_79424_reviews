"I was not a fan."
"Not my fav brow ale"
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is on the light side, with slightly below average carbonation, a smooth watery feel and a bitter grainy finish that has too many earthy notes to make this tasty. It was average, nothing exciting overall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Eh Not great. Was def looking for more."
""
"Dark mahogany in color, very slight head, minimal lacing. Smell of sweet toasted malts, Taste is roasted malts, coffee, nutty. Fairly carbonated, a bit watery perhaps but overall a decent brew."

"Mouthfeel: Light and very drinkable."
""
"Overall: The focus on the malt complexity could be balanced, and even improved upon with some hop, or other flavor additions. The brewing-fine-wrong aroma is light, but still distracting. A good beer when all is said and done, but not one I'd go back to."

"Pours a very dark brown and really close to being pitch black. A thin beige head is seen along with sheets of lacing when sipped. The aroma of roasted malts, caramel malts and fresh baked brown bread. Very pleasing. Taste of malts, light hint of coffee, chocolate and caramel with a hint of hazelnut(?). Very easy to drink with a (but not over powering) slight hoppy finish. Overall, a good brew."

"Bottle poured into a tulip glass. Nice look, Dark mahogany brown, nearly black, with orange-red highlights and around two fingers of rich creamy light tan head. Aroma is decidedly malty, light roast coffee and milk chocolate, caramels and lightly toasted breakfast cereal. Hops are low key on the nose but show up as a floral/woody undercurrent on the palate. Tastes like English hopping to me. I am getting ample caramel malts on the palate, which is sweet, mellow, and very smooth. Think less nutty and more ""black tea with sweetened condensed milk"". Dark fruit (raisins) and vanilla peek out from time to time. Any citrus from the Cascade hops is well masked. I am getting just a touch of burnt toast and singed grain late. Brown spices? Very cool. Little of the more aggressive hopping one can expect from American browns but this is not really a complaint. Low to moderate carbonation and the body has some heft without being thick or sticky. The finish is rather dry and roasted although the complex malt bill lingers through to the end and I do think that's a hint of gooseberry right there. There's the hops! Quite a solid brown ale that offers some interesting twists and turns. This brewery has yet to let me down. Perhaps it speaks to (a portion of) my roots."

"O: the bottle wasn't at 100%, but most of what one would need to know came through... all-around standard, East Coast American brown... hits all the right spots... wouldn't go out of my way for it"
""
""
"Still, a decent beer overall."
"O: 3.75 Pleasantly surprised with this. Wondered if it would be sweeter than I prefer. Well balanced and interesting.  Notes say 5.5% ABV however the bottle says 5.2. This I would purchase again!"

"Taste more roasty and nutty. Hint of citrusy hops follows, and this one drinks very smooth, without too much cloying sweetness as can be the case with some brown ales. Smooth and easy drinking. A non-craft beer friend accompanying me had the same beer, and he also enjoyed it. No problems here with this solid and faithful nut brown ale."

"I was slightly anxious to get started, so my pour was nearly inverted, which does not work well when dealing with a bottle. Once things slowed down, a great pseudo-cascade took place, resulting in two fingers of dense, light-brown head with good retention. Color was a deep-brown with garnet highlights (SRM = > 27, < 34) and NE-quality clarity. Nose smelled of chocolate, coffee, tobacco and caramel. Mouthfeel was medium and it was not as sweet as I had girded myself for, based on the nose. It tasted more like cocoa than outright chocolate and the tobacco taste helped to also reduce some of the inherent sweetness of the style. Finish was semi-sweet and left me with an unusual dried tobacco flavor in my mouth. Not bad, but just not really my bag."
""
""
"The flavor is an improvement because the flavor is dryer than the smell indicates. Strong crystal and caramel malts. The swallow features a very good hop presence, more than most brown ales. The body is also above average."

"Kickass nut brown. Among my favorites."

"For the price this is excellent, $1.79 a bottle, but you can't help but see that this needs a bit more umph to make it excel."
""
"The bitterness is more pronounced than in most examples of the style. Good malt character. Metallic aroma was slightly offputting."
""
""
""
""
""
"In true American-ized fashion, the drier, toastier and hoppier influence makes the style beg for food- anything from barbecue to cheeseburgers to stews- its simply an all-pourpose ale."

"This brown ale is unbalanced and can't decide if it wants to be sweet or roasty, and both qualities get muddled, neither complimenting the other. This offering is one that can easily be skipped."
""
"Overall, This is a decent brown ale. Very drinkable, but not crazy about this. It really lacks flavor in my opinion. Ive had a few other Nut brown ales that are way better then this. You need to check out Rogue's Hazlenut Brown Nectar....same style..but drink them side by side. you will see what i mean."
""
"O: My first bier from this brewer. Very good. I look forward to having more."
"Very taste nut brown ale. You have to try it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Fair head, and some decent lacing. Pecans, chocolate, and fresh tea. Bready, earthy texture, bittered with some dark chocolate. Overall, this is a pretty good quaff."

"The flavors became bolder when this beer warmed. This is an offering that should be enjoyed at or near room temperature."
"Excellent easy drinking beer."

"Overall not bad, typical nut brown style with a nice hop touch, drinkable and pretty tasty, but nothing spectacular."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Ok beer, I like the roasty filling quality, but not the beer altogether."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a nice, rich, full flavored brown ale that is easily drinkable. It has all of the right notes for a brown ale. This is definitely a beer worth checking especially if brown ales are your favorite style."
"Not a fan."
""
""
"overall, if ease of drinking is a category, it's a 5. nice and easy, smooth.... very nice. taste is not especially great, but very easy to drink."
"O - overall good. Nut browns are are not usually my favorites, but this one at least stood out a little."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A tasty beer that is very sessionable but not the ultimate example you can get in the brown ale category."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A tasty brew. I recommend for those seeking an easy drinking brown with a bit of a bite and a good smooth finish."
""
""
""
""
"Brown in color, with red highlights and a thin head. Dark, but mostly clear. The smell is muted, malt, bread, a touch of hops, but not very intense. Some roasted sensations. The flavor, however, is great. A nice balance of sweet malt and some toasty notes, backed by a mild bitterness. Full and enveloping mouthfeel. Great drink ability."

"I actually like the chocolate/ nutty flavor of this brew. Sweet. It has a small bite of a hop finish, yet in the end feels lacking overall, somewhat. It's nothing complex, but i like what basics are in here. Dryness in my mouth after sipping this. Of beers i know that are brown, It made me wish i were drinking a Celebrator instead. The fact something in the ingredients of this decent brown ale even reminded me of a great doppelbock tells me i liked this beer more than I expected to."

"Poured from a 355ml bottle. Pours a nice cola brown colour. There are light aromas of chocolate and smoke on the nose. Not very bold or pronounced. There are flavours of chocolate and toffee with a dry, slightly bitter finish. This is definitely a session beer, something that goes down easy and won't fatigue the palate over the course of an evening."

"Overall: A good brew. Fits the style rather nicely. The malts were the definite star of the show. With just enough bitterness to keep the sweetness in check, the flavor profile was really good."
""
""
""
"Not bad just an average brown ale."
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is quite chocolaty compared to other nut brown ales. It is also rather easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"This was one of the best beers I've had in a long time. A nutty, toasty aroma and appearance with a malty, thick taste and mouthfeel. The appearance was deep, dark brown with minimal head, but the taste was very refreshing and relaxing. I will definitely purchase this beer again soon. It was one of the best I've had ever, and I am looking for more beer crafted by the Shmaltz brewing co."
""
""
""

"Drinks smooth and clean and is apleasure to drink, though it drinks lean and thin."
"A decent beer, not amazing, seems to have a lot of promise but could hold it together better. Still a pretty good session ale that I wouldn't necessarily buy again but wouldn't turn down either."
""
"Just wasn’t really digging the taste. I don’t think I’d have this again."
"O: richly flavored brown ale with nice nutty flavors"
""

"o - solid beer but definitely not in the top half of brown ales i have had in my life."
""
"Smooth and rich for the style with ample sweetness and a sharp tannic, hop bite at the end. A well thought out recipe on this one as the flow is terrific with the yeast, malt profile and notable hop presence all play nicely together. One of the better brown ales I have had in quite some time."
""
""
"It's only fitting I be drinking this stuff here at Jon's. If only he were here... Anyway, this stuff pours a very dark sienna topped by a finger of glowing khaki foam. The nose comprises light cola, very light nuts, and a vague sense of toasted/roasted malts. Things sorta resemble old Coke that's been left out by a basket of peanuts. Something like that. The taste holds notes of light walnut, light dried maple syrup, mild toffee, and light toasted biscuit. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda watery feel. Overall, a weak little brown ale, one that just doesn't step up enough for me."
""

"A very dark brown ale with a thin off-white head. It had an initial aroma of sweet malts & hops, fresh baked brown bread. Taste was lighter than I expected, great balance between the malts, hops, and carbonation. Flavors of caramel, chocolate, coffee, and toasty malts. Very easy to drink."
"Overall this isn't a bad brew but there are better nut browns available locally for me."
"O- A great brew, can almost pass as a porter. Not only is it full of nutty goodness, cocoa nibs and bitter dark chocolate make a strong appearance. Smell and taste are one in the same, if it wasn't for the somewhat watery flavor and metal after taste, it would have gotten a better score."
"Served 11/10/12 poured into a glass from Old Chicago in Madison, WI. This pours a dark brown color with a light beige head. The scent is rather mild with hazelnuts. The taste is bold and nutty with a great blend of robust malts, caramel malts, and nuts. The texture is smooth and is an overall pretty good beer."
""
"O: Good example of the style, I would like it to have a bit thicker/creamier mouthfeel."
""
""
""

"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a dark, slightly hazy mahogany brown. Fine one finger light tan head with good retention and good lacing. Aroma of sweet dark, lightly toasted malt, nuts and a hint of caramel. Flavor follows aroma, with light toasted and sweet caramel malt and nuts, finishing with light nuts, chocolate and hops. Medium bodied with good carbonation. On the light side of flavor, but very pleasant, well integrated taste. Left me wishing for more intensity, but enjoyed this well made, light brown ale."
""
"Overall this is a decent example of a brown ale, a bit on the hoppier end of the spectrum but it's appropriate for an American Brown ale I guess, I just usually prefer a little less in my brown ales. Not bad, worth a go."
"Overall – The taste is fairly nice; roasty, lightly nutty and bitter, but the other characteristics, mainly the mouthfeel take away a bit. Overall not too bad, but nothing spectacular either."
""
"Poured this American Brown Ale from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. This ale poured a dark brown color, produced an average tan head, poor retention and left little lacing on the glass. The aroma consisted of toasted malt and some mild nuttiness. Medium in body, the foundation of this ale is of toasted malt, caramel and roasted nuts. Overall, this is an average brown ale, better then most, not as good as some. Decent session beer, its worth a try."
"Might Make"

"A tasty enough brown ale, the inherent nuttiness showing some commendable staying power - the flavour does not let up to the (not so) bitter end. Not a smack in one's keister, but at least worthy of seeking out more, methinks."
"Poured a 3"" beige head with good lifespan. The body in masstone is really quite dark - a burnt umber brown. Held to the light it reveals a clear mahogany. Probably the darkest nut brown ale I've seen. It smells mildly of malt, cocoa, and coffee. The taste is very mild, even milder than the smell, and it's kind of like and ultralight porter. Medium long finish. A nice enough brown ale."
""
""
""
"O: A decent brown ale. Glad I tried it. I'd rather have more malts than hops on the finish."
"This is one smooth beer. It pours a deep mahogany with not much head and no lacing. The smell is very subtle but I mainly pick up nuts. Mouthfeel is rather average. The taste is smooth. I really don't get a lot of overly sweet notes and the finish is a little bit of coffee. I'd drink this again."
""
""
""
"Overall, I thought this was an outstanding brown ale. I wish it was just a little bit maltier, but still one to seek out if you enjoy this style."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - its a solid tasty brown ale, no real wow factor anywhere, but worth a try as usual with Shmaltz"
""
"Overall - A little too sweet and sugary for my tastes, but then again most browns are. Decent, but forgettable in the land of average browns."
"."
""
""
"Overall, it's a bit dull, but not bad. It's light, obviously designed not to overwhelm the palate. It succeeds there, at least, but there are much better beers that do the same thing."
"A decent brew. A bit more roasted than some other brown ales I've tasted, but it doesn't disappoint."
""
"Pours out a very deep brown (for the style, at least), with a finger of fluffy head. The aroma is malty, nutty, and a bit watery smelling. The taste is much better, providing a nice rounded roasty maltiness along with a nice nut flavor. Bitter and delicious. The mouthfeel is very smooth and medium-bodied, and the drinkability is good. Another solid brew from Shmaltz. I'm really finding that a lot of their smaller beers are really overlooked, the Coney Island line has some real stunners in it as well as long as you can find them fresh."
"Pours a clear but super dark brown with a 1/2 inch foamy khaki head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt and some nutty aromas. Not too much going on in the smell department unfortunately. Taste is of toasted and almost burnt malt, toasted nuts, and slight caramel flavors. There is a mild roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good brown ale with some nice toasty and roasty flavors."
""
""
""
""
"Another solid brew from a ""novelty"" brewery that appears to be not-so-novelty after all."
"Dark brown beer, ruby red at the edges when held up to light. Some lacing on the way down but not that much head after my pour. Smell is pretty faint, smells like malts and mollases. Tastes slightly sweet like maple syrup. Nutty. No hops to speak of. A thin mouthfeel with a dry finish and slightly chalky residue on the tongue. A below-average beer. Not hard to drink but not exceptional in any way, and I'm not a fan of the mouthfeel."
"I'm not too impressed with this one. I've always liked brown ales and I'm a sucker for ""Nut Brown Ales", but this one just didn't do anything for me."
""
"Overall with it's ""limited"" release and availability it's really not going to be in my fridge again any time soon. Hopefully the dry hopped session ale will be better."
"O: This beer has some good attributes, but never rises above the average."
"A towering head with nice lacing. Dark off white. Brew itself is clear and a dark cola. Smell sweet malt with a nice healthy breadiness. A good nutty character to the nose. Flavor has a nutty malt core with lots of roasted grains and a light sweetness, mostly Caramunich malt. Flavors of faint chocolate and coffee. The finish is dry and mostly earthy with a light leafy hop and oil lingering. A touch of bread and earthy hops as it fades. Feel is medium weight and a crisp tingly carbonation. A really good nut brown/American brown ale."
"Dark chestnut in color with an amber hue and good clarity. Poured with a rich, light being foam that slowly dissipated. Sweet dark and toasted malt aromas with hints of brown sugar, molasses and dark fruit. Medium bodied with rich, aggressive carbonation. Caramel and toasted malt flavors up front followed by ripe fruit and molasses. Malt and fruit flavors fade in the middle giving way to a brief nuttiness that immediately transitions to lightly bitter floral hoppiness that carries through to the end. Finishes semi-dry with a dark molasses and light bitter hop aftertaste. Overall this has nice character and was on the sweet side."
"Served from tap into a sampler shaker. Poured a reddish brown with a half finger khaki colored head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. There was no lacing evident throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, grape, and fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, grape, fruit, and apple. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. I have to be honest that I was quite hesitant on this one as I have not found a Hebrew beer that I like yet. So I was a little afraid to try this one. However, this one wasn’t too bad. I think they made a good move making this one so simple as I think that’s where they lose me on their other brews I’ve had. This one was easy to drink, which was a nice change. Worth trying if you get the opportunity."
"Malty aroma has caramel and fruity notes and a hint of molasses. It pours a dark, slightly hazy cola brown with a fairly thick, fine-bubbled, pale beige head. Mouth-filling flavor has a malty core and caramel, nutty and apple tones plus a hint of - cola? Rather tasty and enjoyable. Smooth texture has average fizz and body. Worth a try."
