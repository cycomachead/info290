"A nice brown ale. I would love to try it on draft."

"This is a great brown ale. Very nice use of maple syrup. Well done. Recommended."

"Meticulously crafted with pure maple syrup and the highest quality chocolate and crystal malts. With it's big, malty and complex character, it is a strapping, bolder version of their wildly popular Maple Nut Brown"
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I have to say, I really think they've nailed what you would expect from an imperial nut brown ale with maple syrup. The finish may seem a bit astringent, but I personally don't mind this as the front and center are bold and fruity with plenty of nuttiness and semi-sweet roastiness. Interesting and potent, give this one a try."

"O- this surely doesn't drink like a 9% beer, the maple works well with the nuttiness of the malt.  Easy drinking beer that will definitely catch up with you, overall good   4"

"Ruby brown in color with good light tan head, good lacing, and a thick collar. Aroma is dark molasses, nutty and earthy. Taste follows pretty much identically. Mild hop bitterness in this one. Medium-light body and medium carbonation. Definitely my favorite of the three beers I had at the brewery."

"Pours a very dark brown in color with a small tan head. Lots of lacing is seen with each sip. The aroma is of sweet maple syrup and grassy hops. Actually brewed with maple syrup. Nice aroma. The taste was actually very smooth with that high alcohol content unlike other 9% brews. Smooth rich flavor that was pretty tasty with no harsh aftertaste."

"Lots of flavours, lots of alcohol. But not as sweet as expected. An OK after dinner ale."

"Mouthfeel: syrupy, but not too much so; light carbonation"
""
""
"I bit too big for me, I think. Nut browns shouldn't be imperial, I've always said."
""
""
""
"Overall: A nice beer, but more of a sipping beer. Probably wouldn't want to drink more than one of these at a time."

"O: Good experience and good winter brew."

"But I probably could only drink 1.5 servings because its just too bitter. Def worth a try cause at least you'll be feeling good."

"So, apparently, Tommyknocker and their new labels have entered the Chicagoland market. Okay. This stuff pours a clear russet-garnet topped by a half-finger of ashen khaki foam. The nose comprises rich caramel, sweet coffee (imagine sniffing the air at the mall right at the edge of the food court where there's a coffee ""store"" and a candy store right next to each other), mild cashew, and a hint of cocoa. The taste holds notes of fusel alcohol (up front and in-my-face), burnt nuts, toasted malts, and bitter coffee. Things took a turn from the pleasant and sweet to the unexpectedly crass and bitter. Shame, really. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda drying finish. Overall, what could have been a solid beer (judging by the smell) instead allowed itself to succumb to the Dark Side, with a flavor combination that made me harshly grimace with every sip."

"overall: Nice. I'm a sucker for good brown and this is bit unusual in a good way. A little water body, the nose is extraordinary."

"O: Excellent imperial nut brown ale. Love the maple syrup!"
""
""
""

"Medium bodied and surprisingly hop forward for the style. Some dry bitterness complimented by a complex malt bill and maple sweetness. A bit more roast than expected but nit overly dry or acrid with hints of coffee and toast. This is cut by the maple sweetness as well as some subtle spice, caramel, toffee and hazelnut. Decently balanced and the high ABV is well masked, but there's an odd lingering aftertaste that hurts drinkability. Not bad but I don't think I would go for this one again."

"Ok. A brown ale, maybe my first, on a trade. I slipped this in to my tumbler, so nothing on the head and I don't care either; and looks dark like a stale cola, or neglected coffee, or warm prune juice, or an oil change. Smells like this will be a malt bomb too, as it should be. Taste is malty, and dry, and slightly bitter, with ripe fruit and prune and late cherries: but I'm not detecting the maple. Seems a wasted carbohydrate to add to the vat...it all turned to booze. And I know what I'm talking about, having had my maple trees tapped, and I'm semi-addicted to the stuff: There doesn't seem to be any maple here, but I'd be walloped too if there were any, thinking that beer might be the surest way to kill the subtle flavor in maple. And nuts...don't detect them either. For nine percent booze, doesn't seems that alcohol forward. Malty not being my thing, and bitter more than anything is what I'm after, I can say this was a serviceable beer only, and not really the beer for me--meaning the style more than the brewery."

"This beer pours a beautiful mahogany with a hint of red. It pours up with a full two finger head and leaves delicate spider-web type lacing on the glass. The smell is sweet and subtle. Mouthfeel is a little thin. Taste is very sweet (as expected with a lot of malt character) but the alcohol is just too overpowering on the finish. A little more hops and less alcohol and it would be awesome!!!"
"Overall / Drinkability: I think the normal version of this beer is the superior one. It's far more flavorful and aromatic, and to boot, it's a lot more sessionable. This one is good, and is a great slow sipper with the malt bomb it is, but it doesn't wow me like it's less boozy cousin. So drinkability is one and done. Don't get me wrong though, flavor is great and right up my alley, but somehow the overall package (especially the appearance) was underwhelming compared to the other. Still, worth a try and glad I got it - I just will probably reach for normal strength when offered."

"O: a really good American Brown Ale. Like their Maple Nut Brown on steroids."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I had this after having tried Founder's Frangelic Mountain a couple of weeks ago, and I'd say it is easily on par, and lacks some of the more ""artificial""-seeming flavors of the FMB; this was good and enjoyable beer."
""
""
""
"Was surprised by the thinner feel, but good flavors and drinkability add a huge plus. A good high abv brown that is reasonably priced. Certainly worth picking up again. Good stuff."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best by 9/17/2012. Pours fairly crystal clear dark reddish brown color with a good 1-2 finger dense cream colored head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Some pretty good lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of caramel, biscuit, molasses, maple syrup, roasted nut, toast, toffee, raisin, and light herbal; some alcohol appears as it warms. Some pretty nice and well balanced aromas with good strength. Taste of caramel, toffee, molasses, toast, biscuit, raisin, roasted nut, earth, herbal, and light maple syrup. Lingering notes of caramel, molasses, raisin, toast, and nuttiness on the finish for a short bit. Flavors are pretty good, but they arenâ€™t as robust or balanced as I was hoping; hardly any maple flavor in the taste. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel. Feels a bit thin for a 9% beer, but it is good enough. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a pretty good imperial brown ale. Some nice flavors with decent balance; and quite smooth to drink for the alcohol level."
""
""
"Not super drinkable; this was my only beer of the night. Drinks bigger than the ABV. Not a big fan."
"Overall- Surprisingly nondescript. Flavors are pleasant and well done, but are overpowered by the alcohol. I'd also like a bit more body, as it is it comes off like light syrup. That being said, I haven't had another beer quite like it- Tommyknocker has the maple ale thing pretty well figured out, and it sets them apart. I might give it a go again if I decide to whip up a batch of beer-fortified pancakes."

"I recommend checking this one out, it is a good one!"
""
""
""
"Quite drinkable, especially for a beer of this size. Certainly check it out if you're a fan of the style, the non-imperial version, or maple syrup in general. In fact, just check it out anyway, and appreciate the work gone into crafting this brew."
""
""
""
""
""

"O- the alcohol is hidden extremely well, but the maple turns this into a wholly different beer than I think they were trying for"
""

"Light carbonation. Overall it's a sweet and sticky sipper."
"{revised July 2013}"

"The best thing about this brew is the appearance. In a glass is has a decent head and laces teh glass nicely. It looks like it woudl taste better than it does. I anticipated it being a little heavier and creamier. The malt is just right though. I think I would prefer if it was a bit creamier. It has a slight bitter hint despite it being a malty brown. That makes for a nice balance. The mouthfeel is what you would expect from an imperial ale. Overall this is a very good imperial brown. I haven't had many imperial browns and would order this again at the taproom."
""
""
"Pours a dark, somewhat transparent cola-brown with a very thick and rather persistent light tan head. Strong, malty aroma has an overtone of molasses and a hint of maple syrup. Malty flavor has a sweet, syrupy overtone and woody, nutty and caramel notes. It is on the sweet side with very little hop bitterness, but still pleasing and tasty. Firm, smooth texture has just a little fizz, but you feel it going down the pipes. Overall, a worthy brew."
""
"A good beer, that I was surprised got such low ratings. Maybe I'm biased because I love maple syrup. A nice sweetness that is complemented by the chocolate and caramel malts and nuttiness."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is excellent. It goes down too smooth for 9.8%. I mean seriously, be careful with this one. I have been caught in it's snares. Excellent beer. I recommend one for dessert."
""
""
""
"This big complex and malty offering weighs in at hefty 9% ABV, and pours a rich dark brown, borderline black, with a quickly disappearing beige head that leaves a light ring around the the glass. Aromas of coffee, nuts, roasted malt and some slight alcohol notes create a rich bouquet. Chocolate and nuttiness are featured quite heavily on the pallet with a slight alcohol twinge in the finish. A medium body is met with a good amount of carbonation. Definitely a BIG beer, with much more subtleties then the Maple Nut Brown."
""
""
""
"Beer is sweet, medium bodied, bitter finish, mild roast, overall a nice little beer. I'd have it again although I wasn't blown away."
""
"O: Good brown ale, sweetness isn't as cloying as I thought it would be. Worth a try."
"I didn't care for this one as much as the brewer's standard Maple Nut Brown Ale (which is a nice beer). The other beer is easy-drinking and has a nice, mild, malty sweetness (not an alcohol sweetness). For me, this one is boozy and syrupy and kind of gross. However, don't let me detain you. I encourage you to crack one open and try it yourself."
""
""
""
""
"This is an enjoyable sweet, maple-y sipper!"
"overall I like this a lot."
""
""
""
"edit: this does really well with some age on it. the maple aspect really develops, the alcohol mellows, and the whole thing just gets better integrated. very tasty now."
"The maple is a clever touch, but they could've dialed back on it -- or let the hops speak a little more -- IMO. Sure the latter would've taken it in less traditional brown ale territory, but you're already brewing a +9% brown ale, so I'd say convention already went out the window. As it is, good but not great."
"Overall - A decent beer, but one I will probably not buy again. The sweetness was nice but the aftertaste put me off."
""
""
""
""
"O) A nice effort here. I liked the maple syrup. I'll probably just stick to my old standards as far as brown ales are concerned, but this imperial was a nice change of pace, and worth a try."
""
""
"D - Drinkability is very high, excellent nut brown, the best I've had in this style"

"Good flavors, but honestly, nothing that new or spectacular."

"Overall: It's been a good, long while since I last tried INBA. About 6 (six) years by my guess. I fully recall not digging it then, and I'm just not really digging it now."
"Poured a dark brown color, moderately hazy, with a decent cap of off-white head that left a bit of lacing. Woody aroma, nutty, and a little soapy, some booze. Taste of roasted malts, nuts, a little much on the boozy side, with just a hint of maple sweetness and brown sugar. A bit on the harsh side, and somewhat watery. Might have been better if, well, it wasn't a brown ale. Medium mouthfeel, and overall just a bit lacking in flavor, due to the general blandness I usually experience with brown ales, and with the alcohol thinning it out too much. I probably wouldn't want to drink this again."
"This isn't really a looker, a deep brown with a tiny head that doesn't hang around for long. The aroma is pretty good though, a nice roasty, alcoholic malt smell, with a bit of nuttiness. The taste is pretty good, a nice roasted malt with a bit of nuttiness, which leads into a strong finish with alcohol and nuts. The mouthfeel and drinkability are both solid, if unexceptional. Overall, this is a pretty solid brew from Tommyknocker, you could do a lot worse than this if you're looking for a nice nut brown."
"Overall- This is an interesting beer that tastes more like an RIS than anything. It certainly doesn't taste like any brown ale I've ever had. I know I'm harping on it, but the alcohol is masking what could be a much better brew."
"Overall I thought that this was a pretty damn good American Brown Ale. This beer can definitely hang with the other higher alcohol Brown ales like Palo Santo Marron. This beer was much better then their Maple Nut Brown Ale, the imperial version did a great job at making all the flavors from the original more robust and tastier, the maple syrup actually stuck out in this beer as opposed to not being able to find it in the base beer. What I liked most about this beer was the taste, I liked how the maple syrup flavor showed up and all the other flavors made for a pretty complex beer. What I liked least about this beer was the aroma, it wasn't bad, it was just very sweet and not nearly as complex as the flavor. This beer had awesome drinkability, there was a little alcohol warmth, but it was pretty low and not that noticeable, I could probably drink two of these in a sitting, which is pretty good for a beer over 9%. I will for sure be going back to the store to buy some more, for $1.79 this beer is a steal, with the combination of smoothness, flavor, and price, this may be my go to Imperial Brown Ale. I highly recommend this beer, if you are starting to get bored with all the average American Brown Ales, give this one a try. I wasn't all that impressed with the original beer, so I really didn't know what to expect with the imperial version but I was pleasantly surprised with how well it turned out. So far this has been my favorite beer from Tommyknocker and I would say it's right up there with Palo Santo Marron as my favorite Imperial Brown Ale. Good job Tommyknocker, you guys really surprised me with this one, keep up the good work."
"Overall: This is the first maple beer that I've actually enjoyed. It seems like such a good pairing, but there area lot of bad executions of the idea."
"Overall - I honestly didn't know what to expect for an ""imperial"" brown ale. This was a style that always struck me as a low-alcohol, drinkable session-type beer. This is definitely more of a sipper, but they still managed to catch a noticeable nutty flavor amid the booze and maple."
"Pours a deep chocolate-colored brown with very little head. The smell of bread, nuts and a slight whiff alcohol is present. The most noticeable taste is the maple syrup, but there is a strong malt profile here as well. Alcohol is hidden rather well in this one, but you get a slight alcohol burn in the finish as the beer warms. This is a solid effort from Tommyknocker that quickly ranks among one of the best brown ales that I have tasted in some time."
"I really like the viscosity and carbonation level in this beer. Its got a substantial thickness to it but its not completely flat; just the right amount of carbonation."
"This smell is nice, maple syrup, caramel malts, nutty, this smells very rich and sweet with little hops to back to balance it out, I expect a malt bomb. Feel is thick and somewhat syrupy, very nice. The taste is a little lacking (while everything else is so great). First the ABV isn't well hidden at all, I get plenty of alcohol taste on the finish (more than anything else), this isn't quite the malt bomb I expected (although it has plenty of malts), I get some maple and caramel, perhaps a little toffee, its good except for the very dominating alcohol after flavor lessens its appeal, its still good but I thought it was going to be so much better from the pour and feel. (It is something I'll buy again when I'm in the wee heavy type of mood)."
"The smell was rich and sweet. Predominant aroma was a caramel with a touch of an earthy malt. A light feeling was released by this, so you really did not think you were going into anything too terribly heavy. As it warmed you could pick up a roasted or burnt smell coming though as well as a touch of a hop note rounding out the back. caramel that you caught right up front along with a burnt or roasted wood flavor. Almost had a touch of oaked flavor in it. Some hoppiness in the finish, but nothing distracting from the primary notes. A good solid brown ale flavor as best as I can describe it. Finish was a little nutty and dry"
"Overall Drinkability - Decent beer. Rating it in style, it's pretty good, but I haven't had many."
"The beer is straight brown with a thin filmy light brown head that left lacing. Smell is a bomb of caramel, nuts and maple with some earthiness. It tastes the exact same as it smells but it also has an alcohol bite and an earthy bitterness. The beer is incredibly smooth with low carbonation and a dry finish. This is my first Imperial nut brown and I thought it was very good, I would like to try more from this brewery."
"Mf: full bodied and syrupy. A little difficult for a summers day, but has great potential for a winter warmer!"
"O: The alcohol is hidden quite well. Sweet, roasty and earthy tastes dominate the palette with a decent bitterness in the finish. This is a nice sipper but not really sure if I would revisit this again in the future."
"The aroma has a notable amount of maple along with some toffee. The taste is even better. Lots of maple and some extra sweet malt. The flavor is prominent but not overbearing, very enjoyable. It's quite smooth and I teared up a bit when it was finished."
"Meh. Not bad, nothing special. After being spoiled by Cigar City's and Surly's browns...this just doesn't compare. Thanks to TATURBO for the Tommyknocker tick."
"O: Great nut, heat cuts back a minuet bit on the overall ""drinkability", for lack of a better word, but it would be great on a cool fall day on the deck."
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle. Has a dark brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts, alcohol, a touch of maple. Taste is the same, alcohol is definatly present, some malts and a touch of maple. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a pretty good beer."
"Not bad. I was expected a little more sweetness from the malts."
"Opinion: This is an OK beer, but the alcohol is high for what all else it has backing it up. Having about 4x the carbonation would definitely help bring this beer to life. As it is, it is strong and sweet and hits the palate rather hard, yet there are no off flavors or palate sensations. It is just alcoholic with low carbonation. It would probably be a lot better to try this beer on tap where the carbonation would be more. Either way, this is a pretty decent beer, and I am glad that I tried it. I wish it was a little fizzier, but as it is...it is still worth a shot."
"Poured into a pint glass, rusty orange to light brown in appearance. Little head, but what little there was left a trace of lacing in the glass. I could definitely detect the maple syrup in the aroma, but also some notes of sweet malt, chocolate and caramel. Taste was quite similar to smell, although the maple wasn't too overpowering as i feared it might be. Just enough to make a tasty presence. It finished with a nice alcohol warmth, which i think also helped preventing this brew from seeming too overly sweet. Seemed to have nice carbonation, which combined with the flavor and alcohol made for a nice mouthfeel. Went down way too easy for a 9+ abv, definitely an enjoyable brown ale."
"O- This struck me as an average acrid tasting porter with all the smoke and saltiness. I would have this again, but it wouldn't be my first choice."
"Drinkability: very drinkable"
"Deep blood red in body with almost nothing to show for a head except for white bubbly around the edges. Maple syrup, cocoa, cinnamon, and slight licorice in the nose. Tastes of cocoa nibs, light dark fruit, cinnamon, slight licorice, maple syrup, booze makes an appearance with some black pepper and then the drink finishes dry but with a tangy dark fruit note. Heavy body with medium carbonation and a slick mouthfeel. A belly warmer for sure. Good thing I'm in Syracuse for this one."
"This beer pours out as a pretty looking brown color with a nice tan head on it. The smell of roasted nuts and an ample amount of maple syrup. The taste is a nice combo of sweet and nutty that fades into a dry toasted aftertaste. Not too bad tasting but pretty sweet up front. The mouthfeel is a little thicker than some brown ales but I like how it adds some depth to the brew. This was pretty enjoyable."
"Had an Imperial Tommyknocker ale last night. I've had the Maple Nut Brown from Tommy and it was a little too sweet for me. The Imperial is very similar. It's a sweet beer but not as overbearing as Maple Nut. It has a high alcohol content which you would not tell by drinking it. It is dark in color and the smell is attractive. I like this beer to an extent. It is not my favorite by Tommy but it is definitely worth a try."
"Pours a deep caramel brown with minimal head that quickly yields. Smell is sweet, mostly medium roasted caramel malts with strong alcohol. Taste is rounded, decent complexity, nice light hop finish, and a powerful alcohol kick at the end. Tastes like a good solid brown ale with stronger alcohol, but slightly sugary. Mouthfeel is syrupy, heavy, with very little carbonation. Generally quite tasty, a nice balance of sweetness, hops, and potency."
"Recomended if your a fan of the style, and like maple syrup on your waffles and pancakes!"
"D: It began promising but there is a lot wrong with this."
"D - definitely a sipper, but not the first sixer I've bought, so obviously it was good enough that I went back to it. It's really drinkable for an imperial beer of its ABV."
"D: none really to speak of. going down the drain."
"d 2.5 just too boring, especially for the abv. doesn't justify itself in my book."
"On-tap at Flying Saucer served in a tulip glass an almost opaque black with a thin khaki head that diminishes to a ring and leaves slight lacing on the glass. Aroma is a nice amount of dark malts with a hint of maple. The taste is a nice blend of dark malts, cocoa and maple syrup that leaves a nice lingering maple finish. The beer is on the heavy side of medium with a nice smooth dryness. This is a very enjoyable beer, one I would love to have on-tap again."
" ~ In my opinion this is a solid brew. It's not one I would seek out again but I will say this, if II found on draft someplace, I'd certainly take a sampling."
"D - This is pretty drinkable for such a big beer. It is slightly spoiled for me by the vinegar and astringency, but I suspect this is a mistreated, oxidyzed bottle."
"Overall, I enjoyed it. Like any imperial type, a sipping beer. Probably good with some cheese and fruit as opposed to dinner."
"An easy drinker really. A good session brew, but I'd be afraid the alcohol would sneak up on you!"
"D - I'm pouring this out. Each sip feels like a mistake I wish I hadn't made. The flavor and feel are both off and don't have many redeeming qualities to them at all. I like the maple syrup addition to it but that's really about it. This beer needs a lot of work. Note - If only the notched date made sense."
"Note: This beer goes great with marble rye bread and mild cheddar cheese."
"T/M/D--Cloying and buttery with malt overshadowing subtle hops. Extremely smooth and enjoyable. Would definitely drink again."
"D- Very drinkable, but a sipper. Take this one slow."
"Im drinking one as I write this entry and I must say Tommyknocker's never fail. A considerable improvement over the Maple Nut Brown Ale, which is also excellent. At 9.00% ABV it is well worth a college try. I've had several Tommyknocker's and the Imperial Nut Brown definitely tops the list."
"I don't want much more of this, very average."
"Very sweet, almost too sweet, but I suppose that is what they were driving at. Share this one with a friend."
"O- Good but not amazing. They should let it sit in a bourbon barrel for three-six months and then it would bring kings to their knees."
"Though the ""nut"" gets lost in the massive complexities of this beer ... wow, what a killer malt bomb this is! Very drinkable, but it's a sipper, and a great pick for pairing with chocolates or a bowl of warm, spiced / spicy mixed nuts. This would no doubt be a fine match to a robust cigar, too."
"D - Pretty decent beer. Nothing too offensive about this but nothing too great about it either. Worth trying but I don't think I'd buy it again."
"All in all I'm happy with this one. Definitely worth a try and better than the average nut brown ale."
"This is a decent beer from Tommyknocker. Among the better beers I've had from them. If you like malty, sweet flavors than this bottle is something you shouldn't avoid."
"D: Eh...it wasn't horrible, but the sweetness was over-powering"
"D- farily easy to drink for the ABV. smooth"
"D: Very sweet and heavy. Maybe two at a time and that is it. Alcohol absolutely comes through."
"D : At 9%, this isn't something you'd have too many of. Honestly, it's not something I crave a second for at all. Maybe the combination of alcohol and sweetness just turns me off after one."
"Certainly worth a shot - picked up fresh from the brewery's fridge on Thursday."
"Full-bodied, creamy, warming throughout. Smooth with a tangy effervescence up front. A very good beer and highly recommended."
"Meh."
"I poured this average tasting beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was a mahogany brown with a brown head. The beer had a nuttiness like sweet smell and taste and had a really bitter dry aftertaste. I really did not like the brew for the bitterness. If you like bitter beer, go for it I will not buy again."
"Mouthfeel is not as heavy as I expected. A bit syrupy, not too bad, but not great either."
"Overall, this beer did not impress me. For how high the abv is, I expected more of a complex beer. I guess the price tag should have made me think otherwise. Nothing to special. I'd maybe drink it again."
"This beer pours a clear brown color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes rather quickly into minimal lacing. The aroma is of caramel, burnt caramel, and not much else. It is nice smelling caramel, but very simple. I think it would be for a great aroma if only a little floral smelling hops were somewhere to be found. The taste is of caramel and sugar. I love malty beers that have depth, but this one just doesn't have that. In fact it is so sweet it reminds me of drinking soda. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a sugary texture as if there were undissolved sugar still in the beer. Overall, this beer is quite a let down. The concept of an imperial brown ale has a lot of potential, but this beer just doesn't live up to it."
"Average drinkability. Not much here that makes you want to come back for more."
"The 9.0%abv is masked quite well. Unfortunately, the flavor is not as bold as I'd wanted it to be. It's actually rather on the dull side and therefore this is not one that I want to drink alot of."
"Maybe a little too sweet and demanding to drink with any regularity, not to mention that it lacks some complexity...but it's an interesting one, and I don't regret buying the six-pack."
"D- Honestly, I ordered a second pint. Perfect with my hearty soup. I just wish it had less of a pungent lingering aftertaste."
"12oz. bottle served in a standard pint glass. Poured the color of cola with ruby highlights around the base. One inch, khaki-colored frothy cap, sizzled and popped but exhibited good retention. Some thing strands of lacing exposed during the tasting. Strange aromas off the nose - vinous/sour dark fruit and maybe a hint of lactose and cocoa. Taste follows nose - not at all what I expected from an imperial brown made with maple syrup; maybe the addition of some chocolate malt, but also a slightly metallic quality at the back. Mouthfeel is light-medium and very lively, almost prickly with some acidity that comes out at the back and stimulates the salivary glands. Not what I expected from an American Brown. Abv is well-hidden, but fairly disappointing - just wasn't anticipating the tartness and acidity."
"This stuff is very dark brown, not quite opaque, with some particles floating about. The head was light tan as far as I could tell...it really wasn't around long enough to get a good look at it. You could smell a hint of hops in a slight citrus a bit of maple syrup, but the sweet caramel/nutty malts were most dominant. A bit of a caramelized brown sugar taste, but then...soy sauce. This just didn't sit well with me. Kind of smooth going down, but the taste was disappointing."
"Medium body and a bit slick....not much else to say. Overall, not a huge fan of this. Too sweet and a bit boozy. Just seems off kilter to me."
"Mouthfeel is surprisingly thin for such a high abv beer. It's quite easy to drink in this regard (though the slight hotness to the alcohol gets a bit in the way)."
"Quite a good fix if you're looking for a brown ale loaded with alcohol. Other than the weak mouthfeel, it's quite solid."
"I got this in a mix and match sixer so for 2.50 it was really great. It's almost like drinking two of their Maple Nut Brown Ale's with less sweetness. Nice cheap imperial."
"Pours a dark brown color almost black with no light getting through and a small off white khaki colored head. The aroma is of maple nuts and dark fruits. The taste is of a sweet malt backbone with a maple flavor over the top. There is a little raisin taste also. The mouthfeel is very thick, not taste wise but actually thick. Drinkability wise, ehhh, you could have one or two, but i can't see you going more than that. One would probably do it, its okay good for a change of pace for a brown ale."
"Most similar brews are far too sweet for my taste but this one is well balanced. High ABV does not jump at you as with many."
"Just didn't do it for me, and this is only an opinion."
"Poured deep brown/black... looked more like a porter than a brown ale. Small head, nice lace. A flavorful, strong brown ale... but where's that maple syrup? This is a solid brew, don't get me wrong, but the maple flavor really is only a hint. I suppose too much might be off-putting, but I must say, I was looking forward to a more pronounced maple note!"
"Medium bodied, not as full as I imagined, but not as drinkable as the body might suggest; this beer gets unpleasantly heavy about halfway through."
"Overall a decent beer and a nice departure from the norm -- nut brown ales don't often come with an ""Imperial"" tag in front of them. Still, I was rather disappointed with the lack of real maple character here, as the label flaunts its being brewed with pure maple syrup; it would have likely added a greater depth of character. Instead, this one falls through the cracks a bit and stands out as a bit mediocre. Worth a try, though."
"Shows the color of maple syrup, a rich brown with amber highlights. A nice, dense head of sandy colored foam that lingers for a good while. Some notes of sweet malt on the nose with caramel and a brown sugar quality, but generally speaking it's not as strong as I'd hoped. The flavor shows a good amount of malty sweetness with caramel, brown sugar, hints of chocolate, honey, and a nice dry nuttiness. There's a bit of hop bitterness on the finish, just enough to provide some balance without stepping on the toes of the sweetness. The alcohol is present but not overpowering and shows through as a nice warming sensation. There's a lively carbonation that lifts the sugars off the palate and doesn't allow the beer to be too cloying. I was surprised by this one and I would highly recommend it for malt lovers or people just looking for a unique take on the brown ale."
"This beer contained sediment. Maple and brown sugar were very prominent as is the dark sugary malt. This beer had a distinct cherry flavor in the middle albeit a very dark cherry liqueur character. Nutty, toffee too. Tasted like a very high abv brown ale with cherry juice. Just not that drinkable or appealing to me. I would say I was surprised that it tasted so different than I would expect an Imperial Brown to taste. Was not impressed at all as some other reviewers were."
"The salt finish is killing me, the strength would keep you from having more than one."
"D - the 9% alcohol is hidden, but there nonetheless so you wont pound these all night long..."
"D-Good but I definately can only go one per evening. I'm not used to these high gavity beer, so I'll take it easy."
"Drink a hint of booze but smooth for the amount of abv. This one will sneak up on you."
"D: Drinkable, but not much aroma or other flavor justifying recommendation"
"This beer is drinkable, but I will warn that it can be a little on the sweet side. That being said, I'd recommend it to try, it might be perfect for your taste buds!"
"M&D: the body is pretty decent, not quite heavy, and goes well with a softly carbonated palate, while the flavour also doesn't come too sweet, heavy, or alcoholic for a 9%abv. All in all, this ""Imperial Nut Brown"" ale is semi-delicious in its own right, and at times rings a bell of Belgian dark ales even, but not quite my cup of tea due to the prolonged, thin-ish palate of sour sugar."
"Drink: My bottle said 9% abv... not 9.8 that is documented here... Still, quite a honker! But quite tasty... sure, go out and get ya some of this...."
"Mouthfeel is medium heavy bodied with a bit of carbonation."
"D: SKip it -- heavy on booziness without much other aroma or flavor to recommend it. Tommyknocker's dopplebock is a much better bet if they're the only brewery available to you or if you're feeling adventurous."
"Overall this is an above-average ale. It you're into the nut brown style, you might want to seek this beer out. Otherwise, it's nothing too special, especially for the price."
"Mouthfeel & Drinkability - Medium mouthfeel, creamy on the palate. Fairly mild carbonation. The alcohol is really well masked for as high as the ABV is in this one. An overall decent brew."
"Poured a medium brown color with a small head. Nose is sweet from the maple syrup and has a lot of alcohol. Taste has a lot of character from the maple syrup, but the alcohol really hurts the flavor here. I noticed a skunkiness or bitterness on the end that I could do without. Very thick mouthfeel. Drinkability is ok and pretty good."
"An inch and a half of crackling biscuit colored tan foam has decent retention. Body is a very deep brown and is really almost black in color. Nose has woodsy caramelized malts, rustic wood tones and even some pickled hop characters. As you take first sip you realize this beers is all about the malt profile. Big smooth richness is quickly followed by silky distinct sweetness. The maple syrup really plays a part and brings with it a nice dose of creamy chocolate. Mouthfeel is a sweet mouth glazing that hangs on with thickness. Super drinkable at 9% alcohol which is nicely hidden."
"Dark brown colored ale with a slowly fading head.Aroma is chocolate.Taste is chocolate,maple and nuts.There is a nice warmness at the end of each swallow.Smooth,creamy and delicious with a kick to boot.Overall very good and something that i would recommmend and purchase again!"
"A good beer at a fair price. Will get this again."
"Lots of brown and burnt sugar notes in here. Some toasted malt also, along with a bit of maple, fruit, and a touch of hoppy bitterness in the finish. This beer does a good job of not becoming overly sweet, as a lot of big browns often do, and this lends to the drinkability of it, along with an unnoticeable nearly 10% ABV. Medium mouthfeel, but for something imperial you would expect bigger in this department. Overall a pretty good beer that I havent been fond of in the past."
"D-This is definitely a sipper - I can't see having more than one of these in a sitting. Still enjoyable though to have one."
"I really enjoy this one. Definitely a beer that's easy to overlook just because Tommyknocker usually makes fairly tame (""meh"") beers in most cases. This is a malt bomb that beer geeks can enjoy for sure."
"While brown ale is not my favorite style, I still enjoyed this beer. It's just a bit too one-dimensional, especially considering it's such a big beer."
"I had never seen an imperial nut brown ale before so I had to buy it. It's a nice dark amber brown color with a foamy light tan head. It smells sweet, mediciney, and sort of like oatmeal. Burnt coffee malt sort of flavor with some bitterness and a touch of alcohol warmth in the throat. Not too thick or chewy but somewhat heavy, Hence, making it not the most drinkable beer around. It says ""brewed with pure maple syrup"" but I don't detect that at all. Maybe it's just me. Foam sparsley sticks to the side of the glass as I drink it down. This beer's OK. It's worth the $8.99 for the six pack."
"Nose was sweet, syrup and malt with nearly the same taste though no hint of the 9% ABV, very smooth and easy to drink. This may not be the most complex of drinks but tasty just the same and quite drinkable."
"Overall: Thank you Mentor for generously giving me another beer. This beer was pretty good. Not the best, but good."
"D- It's not a chugger, but not too overwhelming to have a second. It's a beer I'm glad I tried, but not something I'd search out again."
"D: Not what I expected in a brown ale, but interesting."
"Overall impression: This is too sweet for me, but there are some interesting flavors in there too."
"Pours a dark brown color. 2/3 inch head of a light tan color. Decent retention and decent lacing. Smells of roasted malt, sweet malt, alcohol, some hops, and some slight spice. Fits the style of an American Brown Ale. Mouth feel is very smooth and slightly thick, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of roasted malts up front, nut, noticeable alcohol throughout, slight sweet malt, and some hop bitterness in the finish. Overall, a really good beer - the best I've had from Tommyknocker."
"Not a fan of any Tommyknocker beer I have had to date, I am a little leary on this one. Pour is a cloudy, not appetizing brown color, with a small off white head that is gone before I can even smell it. Not a good start, but the aroma bring nice nutty, caramel malt charater and a hint of spicy floral hops. Taste comes through nicely also, mostly chocolate and caramel, with a touch of Maple and a little less of the nuts as in the aroma. Feel is nice a smooth with a touch of creamy. This is a very drinkable beer, and restores my interest in Tommyknocker. I may revisit this brewery after trying a beer I really ended up enjoying."
"Drinkability: Overall, I'm not as impressed with this beer as I was hoping, but it's a fine beer and a pleasant change up from what I've been drinking lately (tons of IPAs). The alcohol is way to high to do a lot of these in a night, in fact, I'd probably stop after one. I think this would be very good with some pasta. Medium drinkability."
"drinkability is not great. the fish/soy thing is pretty off-putting. balanced and otherwise kind of nice, but i just can't get past that."
"Pours a clear dark ruby red, brown out of the light, thin off white head forms, quickly drops to a thin ring around the glass, some nice lacing sticks to the glass, looks pretty good. Smell is neat, very sweet, nuts, brown sugar, maple, caramel, biscuits, pretty interesting maple and nut component, some alcohol comes through, a bit of fruitiness, I like it. Taste is similar, quite sweet, brown sugar and maples, quite nutty, a little bit of soya sauce, raisins, biscuity maltiness and lots of sweetness in the finish, alcohol comes through, almost a fish/soy finish, pretty strange. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, almost syrupy, lots of maple, weird fishiness = not so drinkable. Kind of a mess, not sure whats up with this one, but can't say I enjoyed it. Thanks Mike!"
"Overall not bad, but I'll pass on buying it again. For 9+%, easy to drink."
"Overall, a rather unimpressive beer. Intense sweetness dominates with chocolate, caramel and a bit of tartness also present. Its pretty complex, but the flavors just do not appeal to me."
"My first time having an ""imperial"" brown ale so I have no idea what to expect. Pours a very dark brown with a small tan head that quickly dissipates into a ring. Smells are faint but I detect resinous hops, lots of alcohol, and extremely sweet-smelling toasted malts. Fascinating on many levels - where to begin? First, the full body is quite active with crackingly carbonation. The flavors bop and weave and are hard to pinpoint. There are definitely sweet, dark fruity toasty malts are well supported on the palate by sprucey hops, but the finish is quite sweet and drawn out. A lingering element of stale coffee grounds detracts a bit from the taste. It's very interesting how the sweetness and bitterness interact; I don't think that ""balance"" was a quality sought by its brewers and so I won't knock this beer for not having it. Makes me think of burnt cherry cobbler. Very interesting; very punchy, hard-hitting. I definitely like this beer but have to limit myself to one."
"This stuff sticks with you like ugly homebrew."
"And the taste just wallops you, you know what I mean? HUGE bitter sweetness in the middle of the back of the mouth. Kind of maply and nut browny all around that. But, yeah, not just imperial - extreme."
"Drinkability: I think it's very good and I could do a bunch of these. It's warming and smooth. I like it a lot."
"D - a bit too sweet for too much of this beer, a small 4oz sample was enough for me."
"I was looking for something with a maple syrup flavor when I bought this, and I was dissapointed. I am not a fan of brown ales in general, so I'm sure that had something to do with it. Maybe someday I'll try this again, but right now I have no plans to."
"Pours a prune juice brown with chunky floaters. A khaki two finger cap crowns this dirty looking brew. A couple ribbons of lacing grace my mug. The nose smells malty and chocolaty sweet. Brown sugar and maybe the maple syrup peek through in the end,the brown sugar is there for sure. A Nut Brown Is supposed to be nutty right? Perhaps hidden by the alcohol or by the overly sweet flavors,I'm not complaining,but,it's just not nutty in the least. A dark,toasted malty backbone is enhanced by brown sugar and semi-dried figs. Alcohol is no after thought,it's pretty upfront and bold,it grows every second this warms. The body is full and well carbonated finishing slightly dry with a thin layer of sugary stickiness coating the pallet. I don't get too enthused over nut browns typically,maybe they should all be Imperials,intriguing offering and better than expected."
"Poured dark brown with a large off white head. Very little lacing. Smell is very much of roasted malts and maple syrup. The taste is a Malt Wallop. Roasted malts up front with a strange/good flavor in the middle. Hop twinge at the end. I really can't find the maple syrup in the flavor like I can in the smell. But the mouthfeel is kinda thick for a brown. Alchol is very evident throughout. This might be better after mellowing a little."
"For a style, that is for myself mainly lackluster. This beer is not half bad, it's actually quite well-made and produces almost a homebrew feeling. Check this one out."
"If it wasn't for the high ABV this could be a 2 to 3 bottle per night beer."
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. Pours a dark brown with little foam that quickly disappeared. Smell of roasted malt and some chocolate. The taste is sweet caramel, the alcohol wasn't as well hidden as others thought. Overall its not a bad drink, just a little too sweet for me."
"I would not recommend this beer. I had this on-tap at the brewery."
"12 oz bottle. Pours a very dark brown with a dense 2 cm tan head that is slowly diminishing. Aroma of molasses, smoke, and... sounds weird but soy sauce. Initial flavor of maple and molasses. The nuttiness and smoke follows through to the end. Medium to heavy body, moderate lacing, light to no carbonation, and moderate alcohol presence. Overall, maple and nutty with good alcohol... nice."
"Tommyknocker did a pretty nice job with this. It's actually better than expected. It could use a little work. Not a lot, but a little. Thicken it up and refine it a little...you'll have one hell of a fine beer. Certainly recommended though. Who can resist an Imperial Nut Brown? Not likely to see that often."
"A very tasty brew, But, be careful, it will sneak up on you."
"D: While the alcohol is hidden nicely, the flavours are a little unusual. Decent, and a good idea (maybe that's the Canadian in me talking) but I think it could be done a little better."
"D - This is a great brown ale. The maple syrup flavor is a nice touch."
"Bottle purchased from Liquor Mart. Very little hops. Sweet, carmel, malts, and you can definitely taste the maple syrup. Mouthfeel is a little thick. With so much sweetness you might throw up if you had more than one. This beer is apparently not rare so I have to dock some points for the lack of scarcity. (j/k)"
"Drinkability: With the sweetness and ABV in this beer, it would be difficult to consume in quantity, but I was impressed by the flavor profile and think it would go well with a dessert"
"D: If this had any hop character at all, it would be a pretty good beer. No bitterness to balance it out. Heavy on the alcohol so this is an easy beer to drink for the novice drunk. Pretty much tastes like a maple syrup coke. Now, I'm craving pancakes."
"Smooth and on the syrupy-full side of medium-bodied, this is a nice brew and very drinkable despite the abv."
"Pours a dark brown with a slight reddish hue. Decent head and retention. Smells of sweet malts, maple syrup, candy, and slight alcohol vapors. Taste is very sweet maple syrupy, extremely nutty, caramel, slight chocolate, molasses, and a definite alcohol warming. Very pleasant and delicious. Mouthfeel is pretty heavy and smooth, decent carbonation, slick. As far as drinkability, it;s got a high ABV%, but I can easily take down a bomber of this with no problem, despite it being so sweet. A definite pleasure from Tommyknocker."
"Overall this was not bad. For me, the sweetness and alcohol got to be a bit much towards the end, but worth a try."
"d: really glad I tried this one. good flavor, great mouthfeel. love that maple flavor. tommyknockers has successfully brewed an imperial brown ale, kudos."
"Tastes dry chocolate with less alcohol sting than the nose would suggest. Some nut amid the undertones of sweet. This sweet carries with it a sour, perhaps from black patent? Maybe the sour I get is actually from a combination of alcohol and carbonation sting. Woody dry character with some grassy hops. Md-thick body with strong carb than I'd like. Decent drinkability."
"Overall, an OK beer. It's not very well balanced between the the cloying sweetness and the charred alcohol."
"Not something I will seek out again, but a decent beer for a style that doesn't really exist yet."
"D: High ABV makes this a one and done type. A very nice brown ale though, good after dinner."
"1074"
"I'd be hard pressed to find a malty brew I enjoyed more than this offering from Tommyknocker. I've since been back to Sunset and had another glass, and also tried it at the American Craft Beer Fest."
"Really terrific beer that Tommyknocker made, and I'm so glad I grabbed a sixer of it. A must-try."
"Overall- Good thick flavors pop throughout this pint. Smooth, with touches of sweetness make this a nice brown ale. The best of the Tommyknockers that I've had so far."
"The body is more along the lines of full. Nice malty notes with a bit of sweetness in the finish almost gives it a under attenuated feel, but still ok. Overall a good beer with some minor faults. I need to try this from the bottle to compare it from the tap."
"D: So far, so good. Might be a little too much to drink all night, but for just a couple/few, it's vastly more satisfying than the Maple Nut Brown."
"On tap at Tyler's Taproom in Durham.Poured into a standard pint glass a deep ruddy brown with a thinner off white head,aromas are a mix of brown sugar/molasses and and as others have noted some maple syrup.Flavors are quite sweet upfront that molasses and brown sugar is big along with maple syrup not really any hop drying here.Its ok but a little to sweet for my taste,would likey be a good beer paired with a chocolate dessert."
"Good mouthfeel and a nutty sweetness. Dark brown, alcohol is warming but otherwise hidden. A drinkable and passable brew.Too much sweetness there to be of continued interest, with caramel, a tad chocolate malt, honey.Understated carbonation.A unique spotting of style, but otherwise so what."
"Dark muddy brown, mostly opaque. light, short lived tan head. Smell is very nutty, rich brown sweet malt and a hint of cocoa. Smell is actually surprisingly nice. Taste is kind of cheap and sweet and artificial with syrupy nuttiness. Alcohol is hidden pretty well, but shows a bit. Definitely a richer mouthfeel than Tommyknockers' other beers. Drinkable, and one of their better beers for sure, but still a bit too artificial tasting."
"had at Boondoggles at night ... very sweet and malty .. lacing is divine .. no head, but has a constant ring .. dark brown .. easy drinking for 9.8% .. a surprise from this mundane brewery.. nice and very smooth but a tad confusing..i mean, it was enjoyable but was lacking in some departments.."
"Try this if you like maple syrup."
"Clocks in at 9.8% abv, appears a deep mahogany brown with ruby highlights when held up to the light big tan head after a vigorous pour, leaves behind even streaks of lacing down my pint glass. Aroma has some vinous layers in addition to sweet maple syrup I'm also getting some sweet ginger bread presence and some tart dark fruits soaked in some alcohol. Also some milk chocolate creamy malt layers are present with minimal pine notes with some oak aging like tones. Flavor has some overtly sweet cloying moments, like the whole maple syrup addition to a brown ale in the first place. After sweetness dissipates a tobacco leaf pine layer of hops moves in with dark chocolate bitterness and some alcohol presence. I'm also getting some of that soy sauce salty quality in there as well Mouthfeel is a bit thin compared to what I was expecting the syrup additions doesn't add any cloying properties and the beer is actually medium bodied with some soft carbonation. Easy to drink but as whole I'm no sold, this brew just doesn't do it for me too many competing flavors without cohesion. A bit of a mess and you'll realize that fact in a couple sips something I will never really crave again, although they managed to get some hop presence into an imperial Brown Ale with maple syrup seems impressive enough to me."
"This beer is pretty smooth, and easy to drink for a 9% beer, but it's also surprisingly bland. The aroma is of sweet sugar with cocoa malts. The flavor has a maple, dry cocoa, and cola, but the balance is a bit unpleaseantly bitter. Like I said, the body is smooth enough, but the flavor isnt compelling enough to keep drinking."
"Not bad drinkablity for such a high ABV."
"Served in a pint glass from a 12oz bottle. The beer pours a medium brown, forming a 1 inch tan head, and leaving a trail of light lacing. The aroma is a mix of sweet malt, sugar and a very noticeable alcohol presence. The taste begins with the sweet malts up front, followed by a maple syrup sugary sweetness in the middle, and ending with a medium alcohol finish. Not too bad, but I think the use or amount of maple syrup masks some of the flavors in this beer. Medium mouthfeel and body. Good flavor but high alcohol keeps this from being a session ale, but still very drinkable. Overall, not a bad beer. The taste takes a little getting used to, but I think once the drinker knows what to expect, this beer can be a good way to kick off the night."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a brown color with copper hues with a thin fizzy head that quickly disappears. The aroma is sweet malt, grapes, dark fruits, and alcohol. The taste is a syrupy malt with more grape flavor along with caramel and a hint of nuttiness. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated but is a little on the watery side. Overall, Tommyknocker Imperial Nut Brown Ale is a decent beer at best. I would not purchase this again."
"Overall Impression: Not a bad beer. I get this is a celebration beer, but there is a nagging ""malt liquor"" element to this that bothers me a bit. I guess the body is what is bothering me so much; the flavors are pretty good, if straight forward. Not the subtle introspective beer, this is more of a hell raiser."
"This English Brown Ale is brewed with real maple syrup. That's sounds neat. Pours dark brown with hits of ruby head sneaking through when you hold it to the light. Thin, tan head. I can smell the maple syrup and some roasted malts. Lots of malts in the taste with a little bit of hop bitterness near the end. Seems to have some characteristics of a porter. It packs a little bit of a punch at 9 percent ABV."
"D - A very good Imperial Brown ale - the maple seems to boost the abv and gives it a healthy dose of warmth, but still retains an above average brown ale flavor w/ a fuller feel and nice balance for such a big beer. The booziness is relatively low overall w/ minimal fusel alcohol and I consider this a very tasty American strong ale"
"pours up a deep, dark chocolate brown. not much head but the little head it had was a brown tinted one. the nose is dark cocolate, caramel, toffee, roasted malts. the taste is about the same as the nose except it has a little bit of an alcohol spice also. low carbo. nice full bodied, syrupy, long lingering sweet aftertaste. delicious!"
"i was glad to have tried this, albiet a bit simpler than i expected it did not disappoint me."
""
"Drinkability: I bought one bottle as a sort of what the heck I'll give it a try. It was ok, I do not know if I will repurchase this one again though. I just don't see the point of this over alcoholed brown ale. I think I'll stick with the regular version of this."
"Mildness and sweetness make this quite a drinkable and enjoyable offering."
"Drinkability- Pretty damn drinkable despite the high alcohol content. Smooth, crisp, clean, and easy to drink."
"This poured a dark crimson brown with almost no head. It smelled like muted earthy hops mixed with sweet cotton candy. It had a unique flavor of bitter coffee malt balanced with sweet maple syrup. It was oily with no carbonation and had a moderately bitter aftertaste. Overall this was a very good beer, much more rich and balanced than the maple nut brown."
"This is a huge beer and very little like a typical Nut Brown Ale, at least the ones I've tasted; much fuller and stronger. I'd recommend it especially as a winter warmer."
"This was like a smoother 'Three Philosophers' with a little more flavor."
"Very nicely done, buzzable and enjoyable."
"Drinkabilty is pretty good, but not as great as I remembered, the first and only time I had this about 14 months ago, also at their brew pub. This time it seemed to one-dimensional and overly boozy, not enough 'nut' in the nut brown, zero hops. The fusels make it difficult to stomach the large sips required to appropriately wash down their very tasty buffalo burger, which I paired the Imperial Nut Brown with. In retrospect, it would have been a better choice before or after eating."
"Picked this brew up on a whim. Glad I did. Appearance is typical for a Nut Brown. Clear brown liquid with a thin white cap. Smell has woodsy nuts and a maple syrup punch. Taste is exceptional. Nutty maple flavor. It's everything that Newcastle is trying for and more. Mouthfeel is smooth and crisp. I really can't taste the 9.0% beer claims. And I'm glad. This beer is simply one of the most balanced tastiest brews I've ever sampled. I plan to get another six pack and put a hurt on it."
"Pours a very dark brown with a decent head and good carbonation, especially given the abv. Smells nutty and a bit roasty. There are aromas of dark treacle and hazlenuts, some roasted grains, and some fairly complex malt. I don't smell maple syrup per se, but I'm sure it contributes to these other aromas. The flavors are similar to the aromas, and quite balanced and complex. A touch of sweetness, but very controlled- it doesn't dominate the flavor at all. Instead you get heavily roasted hazlenuts, complex malts with scorched dark fruit, leather and spicebox flavors and an intriguing bitternes. Pretty unusual and quite good. Mouthfeel is full and a bit tannic, but appropriate. The alcohol is not highly prominent, makintg this pretty drinkable. It is also tasty enough and unusual enough to keep me interested. Their best beer."
"Luckily this tastes much better than the nose would lead you too believe. Delicate and light yet rich and creamy in mouthfeel. Great mouthfeel actually. With a nice maple middle that is meant head on with brown sugar and even a mollassess flavor. The obvious nutty characters are present but with a vanilla extract like taste and than an unripen date. Has that sweet creaminess but not yet to caramel of a date. I could sip a few of these from mouthfeel alone."
"Pours a very dark and toasty brown with a head that's next to nothing. Aromas of roasted malts and big, extracted caramels. On the palate, thick, heavy flavors of sweet malts and bitter chocolates; the malts almost remind of a bourbon (without the oak barrel influence, of course). Lots of hop bitterness, especially toward the back of the palate, in the finish. Mouthfeel is heavy and rather still, which is a bit overdone with the big flavors going on here -- it could benefit from more carbonation. Overall, this is an alright beer, but not something I would seek out again."
"Overall: The best Tommyknocker beer made in my opinion. Lots of flavor and ultra smooth. I really enjoyed this beer. Tommyknocker needs to make more like this one."
"I'm surprised this one is rated as highly as it is. For a beer made with real maple syrup, I didn't notice any maple taste at all. Call me crazy, but I expect a chocolate porter to taste like chocolate, a lambic to taste fruity, and an ale prominently proclaiming ""made with real maple syrup"" right on the label to taste at least a little like maple. Not the case here."
"Pours a murky brown in color. There is no head to speak of on the pour. Smell is dark malts, some chocolate. Taste is pretty decent. More chocolate comes through and you can taste a hint of the maple syrup. Creamy and smooth on the mouthfeel. I got no hint of the hops, which I prefer. Not a bad beer."
"This beer pours very attractively, a rich amber color with a pillowly head. It also smells very sweet and pleasant. The flavor of the beer continues in the same vein as the aroma, but proves a bit too sweet and surprisingly light bodied. It was at best, ok, a nice concept with the maple syrup, but....for me it didn't work out. Very pretty, and nice smelling though."
"dark brown with ruby highlights. tan head with just okay retention and lace. smell was nutty, roasty, and filled with maple. really nice. a real maple nut taste (surprise, surprise) with a hint of sweet rummy booze. medium full body with a warm boozy finish. this was definitely better as it warmed up a bit. good beer. strength makes it trouble, but tons of fun. i'm not a huge fan of this brewery, but i'll have to give them a second chance after this one."
"D = I really have to put the drinkability of this at average. It is relatively tastey but has enough funky qualities that I do not think I would search it out again. It is too strong to drink too much too, so if you have one of these it may limit what else you can enjoyably have. Not bad and I can imagine someone really liking it, I just don't."
"Interesting and worthwhile."
"Pours very dark brown, with some red highlights. Head is good, but fades a bit fast. Aroma is subtle maple and dark fruits (raisins and figs). Flavor follows through with a pleasing subtle maple character, some sweet malt and dark fruit. Alcohol is apparent but not strong or overpowering. Very smooth beer. Aftertaste is slightly warming, leaving maple notes on the tongue. Nice beer."
"D-This beer is pretty light in flavor and aroma and is hard to believe that this is imperial. The whole beer is a bit bland and uneventful."
"This is my first IMPERIAL Nut Brown Ale and I like it! It is bigger and bolder than a Â“standardÂ” English Brown Ale. Tommy Knocker Imperial Nut Brown Ale is very drinkable for a 9.8% ABV."
"Pours dark brown with some crimson where the light comes through the edges. Thick light brown head rapidly dissipates. The aroma is malt, nuttiness, and maple as it warms. The flavor is roasted malt, brown sugar, maple syrup. Not excessively sweet. The alcohol warmth comes through at the end. The maple syrup flavor isnÂ’t as strong as I remember in the Maple Nut Brown Ale. This is a very drinkable beer, though it is high ABV."
"Overall: This is the Brown Ale drinker's answer to all the overhopped imperial IPA's. (Which I also enjoy.) I enjoyed this one quite a bit. Beware, though, the high ABV will come back to bite you in the end."
"I really like the flavor of this beer, and ultimately that's what is most important. Its other characteristics don't do the flavor justice unfortunately. Still, a good beer that I would have again, and could be a very good beer if it were cleaned up a bit."
"-Oelergud"
"Dark brown chestnut. Head is thin, then gone in seconds. Aroma is nutty, caramelized malt - a little butterscotch, a little maple syrup; actually a slightly bitter blueberry maple syrup smell. Wow! The flavor is much better than expected! It starts with a little buttery diacetyl mixed with maple, then goes quickly from there through a flash of nutty, then roasted malts, before finishing on a note of mixed nutty/ caramelized malt."
"-Despite a thick body and fairly high ABV, this is a rather drinkable beer. It is a very smooth imperial brown and one of the best brews Tommyknocker offers. A good value at $10 a six pack, I highly suggest picking some up"
"This is for sure an interesting twist in the brown ale. The brown ale on steroids, perhaps. The flavors meld nicely for a winter sipper, old ale type beer. I enjoyed it enough, and would certainly drink another, but probably won't intentionally seek it out."
"Hmm, deep dark mahogany brown. Slight head that dissapated quickly to a measly white ring. Aroma is beautiful. Sweet, roasty, slight hints of maple, and you can smell the alcohol content. Flavor is right on with a amped up brown ale. Quite rich and sweet; maybe a little cloying, but thats the style. Roasty, toasty, and bread with syrup on top. Wishing the carbonation was a little higher here as it might help the heavy mouthfeel. Slight sweet film left on the tongue. Drinkability is a little low because of the sweetness."
"Amber, deep maroon color with a half finger of tan head that dissolves to nothing really fast. No lacing. Looks very average. Nose is tons of nut, molasses, light roasted malt. A touch of spiciness. Flavor is good. Nut and roasted malt, with a touch of sourness. A warming light alcohol tinge as well. Dried fruit and prunes, very subtly. I guess you can taste the maple syrup on the label, although it's more of a standard brown sugar sweetness. Body is medium and almost syrupy. Fairly medium aftertaste, mostly of alcohol and prunes. This one was fairly tasty. Not quite on the level of the other 'imperial brown' I've had, the Indian Brown from Dogfish Head, but good nonetheless."
"poured into a pint glass with very small head. Very dark brown in appearance and a nice dark read when held to the light. smells strong of malt and sugar. tastes very malty and can tastes like maple syrup and crystal malt with very small hop taste. it is a little syrupy but it works and the higher abv is not very evident in the taste or smell which makes me want more."
"Overall, this is a pleasant beer although I find it to be too sugary for me."
"D- Very strong brown ale, too sweet, very alcoholic."
"This beer poured a very dark brown with a thin head. The smell is malty and roasted with the maple aroma noticeable. The taste is sweet from malt and maple. There is a slight nut flavor as well. The mouthfeel is very full, but short of heavy. Overall, IÂ’m pleased with this offering from Tommyknocker Â– it is what I expected from the original maple nut brown Â– a definite difference and delight."
"Pours a nice dark brown color, nice carbonation, a very nice small creamy tan head, lots of small islands and sticky lacing throughout the drink. The nose is sweet, malty, dark fruits, toffee, chocolate, and some caramel. The taste is very nice mostly malts, but there is some dark fruit thing going on. Also some toffee/chocolate, the bottle sez maple syrup. The finish is slightly dry. Medium body, a well rounded complex brew. Very drinkable, this is my first TommyKnocker and it is delicious, highly recommended."
"Can't say I'll be buying this one again."
"This beer pours a dark brownish-red color with little to no head. The smell is slight, and must be teased out with some swirling of the glass. It is mostly reminiscent of dark malts with a hint of moderate and neutral hops. There is a strong maltyness of the tongue that is apparent, but for the most part the taste goes down like a monolithic-block of well-fermented dark malts with traditional Belgian yeast. There is also a slight hint of the alcohol in the taste of this beer, but it's no different than any other over-8% beer that you'll find on the market. The amount of candied malts that are apparent are reminiscent of good Belgian Quad's, but overall this is a special beer to have."
"While this is nicely carbonated and full bodied, it is unbalanced and comes across with almost too much body and it becomes a little overwhelming even for this interpretation of the style. While certainly not bad, I don't think I would actively seek this one out again, but I may give it another shot."
"Drinkabillty - Nice, lots of flavor."
"DA: This is usually a very easy-to-drink style, but the addition of big hops and more sweetness has turned this into a brew that must be sipped."
"Take a regular nut brown and up the yeast and here you go. A noble and more or less successful experiment, though like all of Tommyknockers' stuff I'm afraid this isn't exactly worth seeking out."
"Not a bad beer, but not great either."
"Let me start off by saying that the nut brown style (unless you count macro lagers as a beer style) is probably my least favorite type. I never order them as I generally find them to be simple, sweet and boring. Not so this beer, This beer had some real backbone to it (no doubt from the 9.8% abv.), with great intesity of flavor. While still on the sweet side, there were enough hops to keep the beer from tasting too cloying. This was actually a pretty fun beer to drink, and was really quite drinkable despite the 9.8. Not sure I'd ever drink more then one of these, but for what it purports to be (an imperial brown ale), I thought it quite good."
"Imperial Nut Brown? Who ever heard of such a thing? Obviously I didn't know what to expect, but what I got at least looked like a nut brown ale. It poured with a deep chestnut body and raised a short but creamy ivory cap. The retention was a bit limited, but I chalked that up to the 9.8% abv. The nose was cocoaish and very lightly hoppy with a bit of mint, grass, and leaves. Some alcohol was present, but not obtrusive, and the maple syrup mentioned on the label made an appearance every now and then. The mouthfeel was medium-full, following in the ""Imperial"" designation, and creamy smooth. The first sip set off a light-bulb in my brain, ""Oh", I thought, ""an Imperial Nut Brown Ale is kind of like a barleywine""... and that was kind of true, but not really. Subsequent sips proved it to be much less malt or hoppy, and generally less caramelish. So an Imperial Nut Brown, after having taken a very, very long way round in explaining it, is exactly what it says it is... It's just a big brown ale. Nicely malty, cocoaish, subtly toasty, sublimely chocolatey, mildly bitter, gently hopped with grassy and lightly floral English hops, somewhat alcoholic, and in this case, drizzled with maple syrup flavor. And on that note, it finishes a slight touch syrupy (well, at least not dry), with some lingering sticky malt and maple character. As you progress through the glass some alcohol starts to build. I found it interesting at first, but by the end of the glass it had lost it's charm without enough depth to hold my attention."

"Overall - The ""imperial"" part of the brown ale is nothing too exciting. Lots of malts, a little off balanced. Easy enough to drink, especially after it gets to room temperature."
"Overall, I think this is a pretty nice imperial brown froma brewery I have never tried before. I would definitely try this again and I would be inclined to try some others by this brewery also."
"While watching the Boxing Marathon on ESPN classic and having the Manic Street Preachers on the Hi-Fi . Thought it was time to enjoy a brew . A 22oz bottle wrapped in gold foil around the cap & neck . Large scroll label which has a nice singe on the side . The back label tells me that the Tommyknockers were mischievous elves who slipped into the minning camp of Cornish miners . Maple syrup ? Wonder if it is the good stuff . The syrup you get when you go up north to NH , VT , to hit the ski slopes . Just like good beer nothing beats real maple syrup . There is no freshness date on the bottle . Remove the foil wrap to find a bearded miner on the cap with a hard hat , a mug ( of Tommyknocker Imperial Nut Brown no doubt ) in his left and a pickaxe in his right . When poured into a pint glass , a dark brown clear liquid with a nice head . I smell the syrup and some sugar too . Where are my waffles ? The head did not last long . My first taste was very smooth . Maple flavor and some cocoa . It is tasty and at 9.8 % ABV you don't feel the "" heat "" on my cheeks 9 well not right away , anyway ) I did enjoy this while Riddick Bowe vs. Evander Holyfield III . I would try it again . A pleasant brew . My first nut brown ever & will not be my last ."
"The appearance of this brew is what I think a brown ale should look like. I rarely give a 5 but this is deserving. Deep brown with a fair tan head and lacing a plenty. The smell is caramel and slightly metallic. Fair. The taste is a little bit of smoke, oak, maple syrup and a myriad of other flavers combined. Good. The higher abv is not evident immediently but shows a little as the ears warm and turn red. Mouthfeel is good considering the abv. A good drinkable beer that is a very good example of the Imperial Brown. I would drink this beer again."
"This is my first time having an offering from the Tommyknocker Brewery and it was a treat. If you like Nut Brown Ales, you'll enjoyed this beefed up version."
"Serving Type: 650 ml bottle poured into Koenigs Hoeven goblet"
"Poured the whole bomber into an oversized DFH snifter. Nice, deep caramel brown color. Slight head. Nutty, oakey and caramel aroma rolled into one. Lingering sort of alcoholic trace. Good, nutty flavor. Some burnt raisens and sugar flavor. Maybe a little graininess. Good full mouthfeel. The alcohol comes in and out of play. I dont know about making every style ""imperial""-can be a good idea gone bad. This one is quite nice for a late night apertif."
"Pours a brown, almost black color with burgundy highlights. Creates a 1/2"" dense tan head which fades to a paisley patterened wispy coating. Minimal spotty lacing. Emits rich, pleasant aromas of toffee, maple syrup, molasses, hazel nuts, raisins, cocoa powder and brown sugar. Full, chewy round palate with a fine, subtle carbonation. Flavor much like the aroma, but not as rich and hefty as one would expect from the nose. Pleasing notes of dark fruit, cocoa, toffee, roasted malts and molasses with a faint hop and alcohol presence to tame the sweetness. Unfortunately, seems to have a slight weird mid-palate watery thiness that detracts from the enjoyment. Overall very reminiscent of an English-style Barleywine to me. The 9.8% abv is almost unperceptible and this is an easy big brew to enjoy. At $3.99 a bomber itÂ’s a good deal and certainly worth another visit or two."
"I was very impressed with the first Imperial Nut Brown Ale that I have tasted. A good beer for the money and the mouth."
"This is a sweet, tasty, malty brew that hides it's nearly 10% alcohol very well. It's quite drinkable and tasty, but I thought the maple flavor was a bit subdued."
"I'm typically not a big fan of the style but this is a fine brew that cannot be beat for the price. I highly recommend giving this one a try!"
"Very dark brown and crimson when held to the light. Tan/yellow colored head quickly fades to a thin layer of small bubbles. Sweet malty nose with notes of bold fruits and raspberry. Aromas are echoed in the flavor with maple syrup as a prominent point of sweetness. Starting off is a more sweet, tart wave with flashes of carbonation on the perimeters. Earthy roasted nuts are heavier at the end of the gulp and follows strong into the finish. You are aware of the alcohol but doesnÂ’t get in the way of its finer flavors. As it warms notes of vanilla, banana, and smoke appear. Full body and a syrupy thick mouthfeel with a touch of cream hear and there."
"D: An interesting take on a traditional style. The amped up sweetness is nice without overpowering the nutty base."
"Overall Impression: A nut brown with a huge alcohol warming, hence ""Imperial."" For sure a winter beer. The alcohol dominates the rest of the flavoring, malt, and hop flavors. A great example of an Imperial Brown and doesn't stray from the Brown Ale category."
"Drinkability: while the alcohol may keep me from drinking too many of these, I really enjoyed this beer."
"D: This style wasnâ€™t one of my favorites a first, but it has started to grow on me and this is the best that Iâ€™ve had in this style. This beer is tasty, has a damn good kick to it and itâ€™s very easy to drink for a beer with 9.80% ABV. Itâ€™s slightly filling, but I can still drink a heck of a lot of this beer and enjoy every sip of it. I know ""Imperial"" gets thrown around rather loosely and I've never seen it used for a Nut Brown before, but this beer certainly seems worthy of the term."
"Very rich, but still slightly thin bodied. But I really dug the 10% buried behind the smooth, malty body of this frosty. Slid down as easy as a 4/5% brew Â– which makes it kinda dangerous."
"I lost interest in this halfway through my glass. Seems too ""artificial"" for it to really come together as a satisfying beer. Its not awful, but I can't recommend it."
"Meh. I usually like nut browns so style's not the problem. This ""imperial"" brown ale is random and under developed. It has the abv of a big beer but every aspect of it is scattered around. Most of the components and flavors are there but they don't come together in a good pleasing way."
"A beery maple syrup color leaves a 22oz bomber into my imperial Carlsberg pint glass. Great syrupy tan/brown highlight with a very deep brown molasses middle. A nice, subtle sweet maple aroma mixed with some cocoa butter and vanilla bring out interesting notes in this beer. The start is a mdeium roast with some mapley sweetness. Sfter awhile, I noticed some brown sugar and molasses and toffee notes. Good night cap beer on a cold fall evening."
"Drinkability: I am impressed by this brew. A very interesting , new style they created. If one is worried by the name that is may be too sweet , dont. It's not at all. Sweet yes , but balanced very well. And the alcohol is virtually completly masked. If you like Impy stouts , give this neat brown brew a try."
"From the bottle. poured a nice mahogany with a nice sized tan head. aroma, toast, dark cherries, plums, red grapes, roasted malts, some smoke as it warmes alcohol and nice sweetness comes out. flavor. the malts and hops come out nicely followed by cherries, maple syrup with a good hit of alcohol. easy drinking beer will get more of this"
"The drinkability falls of some, but not bad. A big bottle but I could have more. The price ir right. MK"
"D: Limit to a couple. The hops sharpen it in the finale to the point that goes beyond its malty side. Nevertheless, a strong nut brown ale that surprises."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied, intense of alcohol, sweet, and bitter with a roasted nut feel that lingers along the palate."
"Nice smooth creamy mouthfeel accompanied by a pungently sweet syrup aspect that is followed by a surprisingly bitter hoppiness. A very mild nutty character is barely detectable behind the other, bolder components. The high alcohol is completely masked, which would make this dangerous, if I wanted to continue drinking more than one bottle of this, but it is too sweet for me to want to pursue that option."
"Overall flavors are a little subdued. More robust flavor would be appreciated. An unusual take on a stout."
"Overall pretty bland would steer clear of in the future."
"I just had one bottled in November 04. It had a brown dark orange color and a nice small head. It smelled of maple sweetness with some malty roasted notes. This had quite complex flavors of maple, chocolate and a nuts. The sweetness and roastiness of the flavor and aftertaste blended wonderfully together as it warmed. As I neared the end of the bottle I also started to get a nice warm feeling and then remembered it's almost 10% ABV."
"Poured a dark brown body with red coming through around the edges. Had light tan lead that left little to no lacing. The smell and taste greatly consisted of caramel and chocolates from the roasted malts. It had a big hit of maple sugar present in both also. Not a bad taste or aroma. The drink was relatively thin for a beer that calls itself an imperial. There was alcohol present but I didn't find it to be over whelming. It wasn't bad I would get this again but not often."
"I must say, I was truly let down with this one. It poured a quite cloudy dark brownish-red colour with a HUGE foamy khaki coloured head. The smell was amazingly sweet with a powferul alcohol punch. The taste? More of the smell, quite honestly, with a rediculous amount of sugar and alcohol. There's no doubt in my mind that maple syrup is involved in the brewing process of this one. Enormously sweet, and enormously alcoholic. I didn't really care for this one, especially in such a large serving. This needs to be an 11,2oz bottle, certainly not a 22oz'er. Very rough and quite strong. I have had brews 11, 12, even 15%abv, that were easier to drink than this. I'm sure this has its fans, but I didn't care for it, thanks."
"D - Very drinkable for a big Imperial brown. I wouldn't recommend more than one in a sitting but I will definitely look for this one again."
"I wasn't sure what to expect from an ""imperial"" nut brown ale, and with the brewery's prominent notice that maple syrup was used in the brew, I was braced for something over the top with sweetness. I was pleasantly surprised by the judicious use of the maple flavor in the beer - just enought to provide an interesting dimension, but not enough to overpower, or even steal the spotlight. Nicely moderated roasted malt flavor and the alcohol flavor was subdued. Unusually drinkable."
"22-oz bomber, poured into a tall weizen glass. Pours out a dark ruby-tinted brown, with almost no head despite a vigorous pour. Very sweet nose with rich toffee notes. Good malt flavor, but not too sweet, continuing the toffee/caramel note, with modest nutty flavor, moderate bitterness, and a touch of alcohol. At the end, a faint green-apple fruitiness mixed with pleasant maple syrup flavor become apparent. Surprisingly light and drinkable for a 9.8% beer. I was expecting this to be an overdone version of their Maple Brown, but it's very well-balanced and quite drinkable. And by the bottom of the glass, rather warming as well."
"A pleasant surprise here, for certain. Very pleasant to taste and dangerously drinkable."
"Drinkability: All in all this is a pretty impressive brew, and a style that I'm glad they took a chance on. Without the thickness and insane complexity of an Imperial Stout, this is much more drinkable (in the sense that though I want to savor it I end up drinking it a bit too fast) and can be a bit deadlier since the alcohol is still present as much as an Imperial Stout also. I'm really glad I tried this and will hopefully be having some more by Tommyknocker when I can get my hands on some."
"Wonderful brew."
"This beer poured a dark red color, almost brown, with a half inch head that dissipated slowly. Aroma was very malty and caramelly with a few hints of chocolate in the nose. Taste was of sweet malt, caramel, maple syrup and chocolate covered cherries. As the beer warmed, I could taste some alcohol and winey flavors. Mouthfeel was fairly smooth and the beer was medium bodied. Drinkability was pretty high. I would have never known this beer was over 9% abv if I hadn't seen it on this site. The ABV is not listed on the bottle and the brewery's website is no longer available. Not a bad beer for the money. I paid $3.49 for a 22oz bomber."
"This is just a nut-brown on steroids. Really quite nice, but not all that."
"Tommyknocker Nut Brown Ale pours a deep brown color with a small head from a brown twenty two ounce bottle. Smell is dominated by malt. Tastes okay for a nut brown, alcohol is well hidden in this brew. I would have to say this is worth a try, its not terribly complex, but it is definitely more drinkable than it probably should be given the alcohol."
"Dark brown. The deep aroma showcases hints of maple, honey, fruits, deep malts, caramel and roasted malts. IÂ’ll have to be honest and say that I do enjoy the flavor. ItÂ’s fairly thin but it does have a nice creamy mouthfeel. Notes of honey and caramel, dark fruits, butter toffee, maple and toasted malts. Tasty."
"Meduim to full bodied. Alcohol is warming and leaves that familiar burning in the throat. No carbonation. Sticky and sweet. A good beer overall."
"This poured with a thin, wispy, light-brown head. The color was a slightly cloudy, deep brown. The nose was very malty and sweet, especially from the maple syrup. The mouthfeel was medium, bordering on creamy. It had a great sweetness on the tongue and the finish really lingered with the maple syrup aftertaste. My only concern is that this beer would be more suited for dessert or a cold evening by the fireplace."
"22 oz., best within 4 months of 11/21/05 notched on the label. It pours a deep, almost blood red that is hard to see through and it's topped with a small khaki head. It has a big aroma of chocolate and vinous malts, with additions of toasted malt and grassy/perfumy hops. The flavor is pretty much the same with a good dose of hops that contribute a mild to medium bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium to thick, and tingly at the beginning, but soon becomes full and coating. Probably the best I've tried by the brewery, and it seems like how an imperial brown ale might taste. I actually just today found another imperial brown ale (by Legend), so I'll have something to compare it against."
"Drinkability is not good, wouldn't have again. Too much alcohol noticed, why? Lots of brews can hide or blend 9.8% or more well enough."
"Beer is good. Happy um Brown beering."
"The beer pours a dark brown color with a tan head that fades to lacing. The aroma is awesome. It has a nice warm maple scent that boasts of crystal and Victory malts. It's sweet and a bit dry. The taste is good. It has a warm, malty flavor that goes down slow, yet smooth. It's sweet with maple syrup notes and crystal malts. It has a nutty feel and seems a bit dry in the finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn fine beer. It's rich and full flavored with loads of malts and a warming finish; HOORAY!"
"Mouthfeel was very smooth but a bit watery. The 9.8% warms the throat and back of the tongue. Quite pleasing. A fine after-dinner beer for a cold day. I'd pick this one up again."
"I like strong beer and this is strong stuff, Bomber bottle, w/o freshness indication, gold foil covers the cap, pours dark brown with a tan frothy head. Nose is of sweetness, this is a fairly sweet brew, maple notes obvious, also some vanilla, honey and minimal hopping noted. Not my favorite type of brew, but this would be nice for after dinner sipping or with a nutty desert."
"Not really sure what to expect from a lackluster brewery with an ""imperial nut brown"": pours an opaque dark brown with a descent tan head that retains well for a nearly 10% brew. The aroma comes out swinging with a big maple syrup sweetness, with some almond and hazelnut notes in the background, along with some fruits (cherry, raspberry and strawberry), slight floral hops, some toasted bread and alcohol. The flavor starts out with some brown sugar and molasses sweetness, along with some nuttiness (hazelnut and walnut), some light fruits (cherry and strawberry), tobacco, chocolate, toasted bread, floral hops and alcohol. The mouthfeel is a bit light (even for just a plain brown ale), with light carbonation and drinkability is good for the abv. An interesting beer, but the finish was a bit watery and the flavor didnt really deliver like i hoped...but drinkable and tasty nonetheless."
"Light black leather hue, thin, ringy/bubblish tan head. The nose is loaded with caramel, raisins, traces of alcohol and roasted malts. Loads of flavorings and a definite treat. The initial feelings are a chocolate candy loaded with cherries, brown sugar, figs and sticky molasses. Full bodied; warming reveals some mild carbonation and near-chewy qualities. Tender hop bitterness, alcohol is noted, sticky raisins and some woody notes. Very rich and fulfilling; an aftertaste of a freshly baked caramel roll and the smile of enjoying it. This is incredible stuff."
"Probably wouldn't search this one out again, I was drawn to the Imperial on the label, but a decent quaff. Also, one is probably enough in a session."
"Drinkability - if I see this again, I'll try it within 4 months. I enjoyed this beer, if you prefer the maltier, sweeter side of beer, this one'll do you proper."
"Fairly light bodied. A decent beer, but not something I'll buy again."
"Pours a dark brown with a thin head that doesn't last. It did have some beautiful spiderweb lacing though. Smell was sweet with some nuttiness. The maple syrup that was mentioned on the bottle did make it in the smell, but only faintly. This is a very tasty brown ale. The taste is dominated by sweet malts. There is some nice nutty, and syrupy taste to balance it out. My favorite part is the warm alcohol finish. The alcohol is not overpowering as Tommyknocker hides it well, but there is just enough to give it a very nice finish. The mouthfeel is good as well as the drinkability. This certainly isn't a session brew because of the sweetness and 9.8%, but it is very drinkable. One of the most drinkable high abv beers I'v had."
"Had the bottled version of this beer in a beer tasting event. It pours a nutty brown murky color with a fair amount of carbonation but little head that quickly disappears. It a neat beer with an unusual flavor and feel. It has a smooth maple flavor that has a zestyness to it due to the carbonation. ItÂ’s unusual and drinkable but a little sweet to drink all the time. I would try other beers from this brewery to see if they are as intriguing."
"Drinkable enough, I had previous bottles that tasted better, but maybe buds were altered from drinking other beers prior on those occasions. Somewhere between this imperial nut brown and their regular brown is a very good beer (Say something between 6.5-7.5 ABV?)"
"Very interesting. I can't say I'd ever heard of a brown ale being imperialized before. I'm not exactly sure this is the kind of style that should be imperialized. Decent, definitely drinkable, but I'm not sure I'd want another. Glad I got to try it."
"Quite drinkable, and unexpectedly good...especially that I picked this beer up for less than $2."
"Body is huge, thick, chewy, and sticky, making me want to lick my chops after every sip. I truly savor every drop of this delicious, and rather under-rated ale. Yes this ale crosses many boundaries. At times it reminds you of a porter or stout, then barleywine, then old ale. In the end, you are assured. This IS an Imperial Nut Brown Ale. A new animal? Yes, and a damn tastey one at that!"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" light brown head above the clear burgundy brown brew. Head fades, but some still hangs around, with lacing present and accounted for. Aroma is dark fruits, alcohol, with some grains lying underneath. Taste is upfront with heavy sweetness, the maple syrup, I assume, then kicking in with the kind of tart dark fruits and alcohol, and that's about it. And grains seem to have lost the shouting match here. Mouthfeel is just ""too"" everything for me, and drinkability is reasonably limited due to the loudness of it all. I keep trying, but I'm thinking I certainly don't get these Imperial Browns. They seem to lose everything I like in a brown this way."
"Overall a very good beer. I would order again."
"Pours a dark brown, almost porter-ish, with some amber highlights and a short khaki head that fades quickly. Smell is strong on the caramel sugars, some spiceyness, and alcohol. Taste is similar to the Maple Nut Brown, heavy on the Maple, light on the Nut, but this time also heavy on the alcohol, which warms to the point of a hearburn-like effect. Whooo, this stuff catches up to you, especially in bomber proportions. Mouthfeel is bubbly and not as thin as other Tommyknocker brews tend to be. Overall, a pretty good dark imperial brown here, not a whole lot of complexity, but enough to keep you interested. Worth a try if you can find it, but beware that 9.8%."
"It is fine, fine fine. Maybe a bit one sided, but a strong hit."
"Wow, a Nut Brown with some serious body and kick. A heavy and viscous dark brown-black pour with a light brown head that stubbornly remained. Deep roasted malt with chocolate undertones and a mellow souring pronounced throughout. Tastes richly of molassas, roasted grain, and chocolate. Little in the way of alcohol flavor, but warm throughout. Hop detection in the bittering, flavor, and dryness. Fermented sour notes added to complexity without detracting. Finishes nutty and chocolatey sweet with slight dryness. Worth a try for Nut Brown and Porter fans."
"glad i tried it, wont go out of my way to try it again."
"This Imperial smelled robust with a definite chocolaty nose. Poured very dark brown more like a robust porter or stout rather than a brown ale with not much of a head unless poured from a height. The head lasted several minutes and produced some good lacing on the glass. First taste revealed a heavier alcohol content, but not overpowering. Not much carbonation and tasted malty, somewhat chocolaty with a rather flat finish. As the beer warmed, the beer seemed to become even milder and smoother. Although I wouldnÂ’t go out of my way to purchase more, I would definitely not turn another one down if offered."
"Rather easy to drink, with very little hint of the hidden alcoholic strength at first, except some fuminess near room temperature. After a while, a good deal of warming in the belly. If I was asked to sum it all up, I would chalk this up as an interesting but slightly flawed experiment."
"Deep brown color with mahogany highlights. It was topped with a decent sized tan head. It has a very sweet aroma with caramel toffee and dates. There is just a touch o orange citrus in the nose. The taste has the same sweetness up front toffee/caramel with a chocolaty character delivered by the roast malt. It finishes with the citrus orange delivered by the hops and a mild alcohol warming. The mouth feel is very smooth and rich. The drinakbility is hurt by the intense sweetness, but this is still an good beer."
"22 oz bottle pours a clear brown with some floating particles, has a small light brown head that doesn't last long, leaves some lacing in my glass. Chocolate and caramel aromas, chocolate, coffee, nutty , brown sugar and maple flavors. Full bodied with a smooth and creamy mouthfeel, finishes on the sweet side, alcohol is very well hidden as this is dangerously drinkable."
"After tasting Tommyknocker's Ornery Amber, I wasn't expecting much from this bomber. I couldn't resist buying it, though, since I was curious about an Imperial Nut Brown made with maple syrup and since the price was right. Imperial Nut Brown Ale is a wonderful beer that I heartily recommend to lovers of all things Imperial and lovers of good beer in general."
"Drinkability: Overall, less pleasurable than the ""regular"" version. The extra bite was a little offensive and detracted from the already less-than-outstanding original. Only exceeds its predecessor in appearance."
"Dark brown maroon color, almost light impenetrable, but shows a very dark maple syrup color. head is very small, just a ring around the glass, with an off-white island in the middle of the beer. Smell is sweet and full, with alcohol and brown sugar. This is very much like a great winter warmer, maybe even a dopple bock, even though it is June. Taste is extremely malty and full, lots of sweetness, rich and delicous. For $2.50 a bomber this stuff is a steal, very good, unique, and a welcome surprise from a brewery that just entered the Twin Cities market. My first Imperial Nut Brown, and I like the style."
"(22 oz. capped and wrapped with gold foil)"
"Hmm, here's an interesting style, not one I've ever really seen for that matter. Pours a dark brown, minimal head. Smell is sweet, malty. Taste isn't quite as complex as I expected for the elegant packaging and the fact that its a 10th anniversary beer. Chocolate, maple syrup, caramel and some vanilla along with a nutty flavor are present. Tons of alcohol is there as well. Quite unbalanced, somewhat warming though so it'd probably be better on a winter's day. Its not a horrible beer, but not as interesting as I expected. At $4.49 a bomber, its not a bargain, nor a ripoff. As someone said, its a take it or leave it beer."
"I could live without another one of these....not horrible but nothing special about it...take it or leave it type of beer.."
"Deep crimson tone. Slight, bubbly light brown head. Lacing is moderate. Aroma is sweet, nutty and toasty. Chocolate and caramel are also present. Really, quite a pleasant nose with no overriding characteristic. When I read that this was a jacked up version of their normal Maple Nut Brown ale, I feared this was going to be too sweet. But that's not the case. It's sweet, but not cloying. The maple is noticeable as is chocolate. Alcohol lets itself be heard as well. There's a little heat to this one. Nuttiness and lightly kilned malts meld nicely together. It's good. Not great. In this particular beer, I could do without the jacke up EtOH level. But that's just my preference. All in all, it's pretty decent."
"I'm not sure if this is infused with any extracts, but this becomes cloying at times. Pretty good and tasty on the whole, but on the other hand, not so nutty, and there aren't many undertones or complexities that I was expecting from a beer which celebrates 10 years."
"Imperial Nut Brown Ale, this is one of those beers that won't fit into a clearly defined catagory. The aroma of this one reminds me of redhots cinnamon candy, with some added features of course. There was a distinct peppery flavor in the middle of this. Overall, I'd put this somewhere between a double IPA and a Barleywine style-wyse. This one's worth a shot."
"pours out of the 22oz. bottle a deeply ruby hued colour with a cream to beige coloured head, about a quarter inch thick...thick and tight. lots of solvent choco and caramel aromas...somewhat subdued but rather inviting. this is a pretty flavourful beer, lots of thick chewy maltiness with a definite sweetness attributed to the use of maple syrup. chocolate, caramel, vanilla and nutty notes mingle quite nicely with an alcohol spice that warms the belly. there is a big full mouthfeel with every sip...i bet this would go well with some chocolate chip pancakes...or maybe serve as the syrup for those cakes. nevertheless, this is a big ole winter warmer type concoction that is a hearty enough brew to warm ones soul on the coldest of any winter night. not overly complex, just big and sweet and hearty. a nice easy sipping brew for being so big."
"This is a big, oafish, simple being. But a fairly tasty one."
"The best Tommyknocker brew I've had so far. A very nice ""Imperial"" Nut Brown. I would buy this one again."
"Pours a dark, maple syrup brown with ruby highlights and a rather small (half a finger) of sandy brown head. Nose is made up of sweet, licorice malts, singed brown sugar, a vaguely spicy hop smell, and a little alcohol. Taste starts with sweetish malts. Notes of marshmallow, tobacco leaf, stewed fruit, and cola are detectable. Bitterness comes late, basically right at the finish. Unfortunately, the light roasted bitterness falls a little short, and the result leans toward a cloying finish. Not bad, but could use a little more balance. Medium-full body, with ample carbonation. I like this more than any other Tommyknocker beer I've had."
"22 oz. bottle. Deep mohogany color, with some ruby around the edges. Thin beige head disappears quickly. Nutty aroma, some roasty notes and slightly smoky. Big malt character, toffee-like flavor. Maple flavor thrown in as well. Very sweet like syrup. Sticky, a bit cloying. Seemed like a little hop flavor that tasted citrusy to me. Big alcohol presence. Medium body, low carbonation. I enjoyed this brew, although it was a bit too sweet for my taste."
"Reviewed from a 22oz bottle sampled on 1/8/05 with a bottled on date of 11/09/04. Appears a dark brown with red highlights and a small tan head. Aroma is malt with sweetness and a chocolate. A big nuttiness is present as well as a touch of maple. Flavor is quite sweet, with notes of caramel and chocolate. There are nut flavors in there as well but this is a bit too sweet overall. A little less sweet would have gone a long way with this. Medium body with a creamy feel to it. Only the sweetness brings down the drinkability on this otherwise it would really be a much better beer."
"The beer pours a rich dark brown color with off white frothy head of 1 cm foaming up and fading gradually to a robust edge layer that remains throughout the sampling. Aroma is caramel maple syrup and alomonds some lite grassy hops also make an appearance. First sip reveals gentle rolling carbonation and a smooth body with a bit of a syrupy texture. Flavor is malt and general sweetness with toffee maple syrup, brown sugar all mixing for an overall sweet experience. The finish is very maplely and also a bit of roasted malt. The is a nice brew but gets a little sweet towards the end of the bottle. Contrary to some other reviews I barely find any presence of the alcohol flavor wise or on the nose. Very drinkable for a bigger beer!"
"Much better than the Maple Nut Brown they ""Imperialized"". Dark brown color with a thick oatmeal-colored head and nice lacing. Roasty, malty, nutty aroma. Full-bodied and sweet with toasted malt, maple and caramel flavors. Hops and well-masked alcohol present too. The finish is toasted malt with a touch of hops and spice. This is actually a very good session ale despite the ABV. A nice surprise from a normally below-average brewer."
"22oz bottle. This beer pours a medium brown color with a small head that dies off quickly but leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma is sweet from the maple syrup and has a lot of alcohol. The flavor has a lot of character from the maple syrup, but the alcohol really hurts the flavor here. Very thick mouthfeel. Drinkability is ok, but suffers from the unmasked alcohol."
"Thanks to clvand0 for sharing this with me. The beer pours a very deep brown color with a finger of head that falls to very lightly coat the beer. The nose is slightly brown sugar and maple sweet, with a blas of alcohol as well. The flavor is nice, with good toasted nutty tones alongside sweet maple and brown sugar, though there is an intial alcohol that detracts a little from the flavor. The beer is very thick and slightly syrupy. A very enjoyable drink. If it weren't for the fairly big alcohol hit in the flavor, this would be very good. Though, it is still not bad."
"This imperial nut brown is both Â“bigger, bolderÂ” as advertised, but in my opinion it could use some tweaking here and there. Do I think that a new style definition is required? IÂ’m not sure I can answer that at this time, it depends on how many other brewers want to take this Â“imperialÂ” craze to supplementary styles other than the stout or I.P.A. weÂ’re generally accustomed to."
