While not a bad beer, I felt it would have been more apt under the Russian Imperial Stout style.  Ah yes, the brew hid the alcohol well, and tasted better as it warmed.","IRONRakkasan","Mar 08, 2015"
4.5,8.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Cocoa and coffee on the nose mixed with roast malts with a good balance between the added aromas and the malt driven aromas. Pours brilliant deep dark brown under a 2‚Äù persistent, rocky foam cap that produces fine lace. The palate closely follows the nose with malt derived coffee and cocoa flavors well balanced with the added coffee and cocoa nibs all pulled together in the finish with a bitter hop accent supplementing bitter notes from the roast malts and the added flavors. There is a fine ribbon of sweetness throughout which recedes during the finish with a grainy, coffee, cocoa dryness and hop bitterness. Medium full body and medium carbonation.","pat61","Mar 03, 2015"

The ecru head is thick and frothy and is leaving a very nice lace. The smell is rich with earth, peat, espresso, alcohol and chocolate. The taste has almost a tiramisu flare....bread, with mocha balance. The first few sips also carried an alcohol push. The mouthfeel is full bodied with smooth carbonation. Overall this is an excellent beer and should be loved by all who favor brown ales.","WoodBrew","Dec 10, 2013"

Really nicely balanced tastes of coffee, cream, roasted grain, brown sugar, some earthy hop bitterness, and chewy chocolate notes- like a really good chocolate chip cookie.

Board Meeting is a new (released February of this year) and delicious brown ale from Port Brewing. This beer is brewed with coffee from local San Diego coffee roasters Ryan Brothers and cocoa nibs from San Francisco chocolate makers TCHO.What makes this beer great is the perfect balance of these high profile flavors. It pours dark- it could be confused with a stout. The aroma is a perfect prelude to the taste as the taste is very predictable and inviting. It‚Äôs as if the excellent craftsmanship of the beer corrals the strong coffee and chocolate notes and soothes them to subtlety. The slight dry bitterness at the end finishes even more smoothly. ABV is 8.5% and is sold only in 22oz (so far). One bottle is just not enough so grab two!","tastyville","May 06, 2013"

I thought this was very drinkable for an imperial brown and the added flavors complimented the base very well -I recommend this to fans of the style.","Slatetank","May 05, 2013"

Scent is better than any brown ale I've ever had (from what I can remember off the top of my head). Dark and roasted malt with some nice nuttiness. Packed with coffee and chocolate, it still keeps it's nutty, brown-ale profile without entering the porter/stout domain. Taste on the other hand is a different story. Cocoa up front. A ton of chocolate cocoa with a good amount off fresh ground coffee. Vanilla lingers on the palate, along with a hint of allspice and cinnamon. Lots of rich, dark malt flavor and nuttiness. The flavor is definitely stepping into porter/stout territory. Mouthfeel is full bodied, creamy, and ABV is well hidden. Drinkability is high. Overall, this is probably the best brown ale I have ever had. In a blind tasting, I could see this mistaken for a coffee porter or coffee stout. Outstanding beer, no matter what you wanna label it as.","DovaliHops","Mar 29, 2013"

The aroma is all coffee and chocolate. Some roast and a bit of caramel in the background. It smells like a mocha made with dark chocolate milk. Mild cola, a little molasses and some light floral hoppiness. It sort of has that nutty brown ale flavor, but I would have guessed stout if I'd been handed this beer blind. The taste has lots of toasty malt below rich coffee and chocolate. The taste seems closer to a strong brown ale than a stout, but the coffee and chocolate additions mask that somewhat. It's fairly sweet. Very rich with flavor. There's just a ton of chocolate and coffee to the beer. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy and does wonders for the beer. Good nutty, coffee finish.

The coffee was kinda mild in the flavor, but definitely not so in the flavor. Huge coffee flavor on top the nice malty brown ale base with the cocoa closing things out.
