"This is a very nice black ale.  Malty, with a hint of tangy hoppiness, along with a  taste of black licorice.  Excellent!"
"I like it and would pick up another sixer.  It's a Wisconsin brewery.   I like to support local brews!"

"Rescued from the $1 bin. Pours a dark reddish brown into a pint glass. Not a huge head, and it leaves quickly. Smells of malt, chocolate and dark fruit. Those all come through in the taste, but with more of a roasted flavor. Medium mouth with some oil. I really like this, and would revisit it regularly."

"Overall, a very drinkable, good beer. Pours nicely, good head. Taste as a sweet with complimenting bitter notes. Pairs well with Asian foods. Dark color is definitely apparent. Price is optimal. Initial taste has hints of spices and chocolate with slight hints of caramel."

"Don't be put off by the low price, this ale is done right. It's not the finest in the world but it tastes really good. It's not like coming home to a warm, horny, loving mate, but it's a good kisser. Like your lover, it may not be around for long, so get it while you can."

"This is a pretty good dark roasted, malty brown ale."
"O- It's not bad, but there just isn't much to report here. Acceptable, but uninteresting."
""
""
""
""
""
"Descent beer, very drinkable. Nice alternative to the normally heavy dark beers."
""
""
""

"Decent brew. They deep roasted the malt until it got that burnt edge to it, but didn't go overboard. Not sure how many I could have. but decent."
""

"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was certainly black. The beer had a fair head and good lacing. The beer smelled pretty much like a Guinness with its taste being chewy and very coffyish with a bit of a burnt or roasted hit. Not burnt in a bad way. I would certainly purchase this beer again."
""
""
""
"Pleasant and light, like a mild or a mix of milk stout and black lager. Cola-ish, with a touch of dark caramel and a little chocolate nougat. It's nice, but nothing more than that. Possibly a good partner for spicy Szechuan, Thai, or Indian food."
"Very malt forward, with good roast, toasted malt, and chocolate character, but the metallic flavor is offputting."

"I tried the 2012 Black Ale as soon as it came out at my favorite local bar. It had a smell of roasted hops that was very pleasing. The texture of the beer was ok, while the taste was very good. It actually reminded me of a stout in someways due to its color, aroma and the taste. I would get this beer again as long as they continue to make it."
""
""
"Poured into pint glass. Appears a dark cola brown with no head whatsoever. The nose has some roasted barley, notes of caramel, some artificial sweetener, and tootsie roll chocolate character. The taste has a heavy bitter roast, sweet caramel, minimal hops. Something is odd here, this tastes thin and artificial. Mouthfeel is thin and fizzy. Overall, this one needs to be passed on."
"Overall a tasty and clean brown ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This isn't too bad. A bit more pronounced flavors of caramel than I remember. Not a bad combination of sweet and toasted."
""
"All-in-all, a really nice black ale. Plenty of soothing malt sweetness abounds, not overpowering at all. Well-made and a pleasure to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great brown ale. It's nutty and very malty, well balanced. I recommend this beer."
"It pours a lovely black with a nice head that dissipates quickly. It has a sweet dark smell that also has some spices. The taste is very pleasing and the beer has a great body that does not disappoint, I would definitely recommend."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a nice, full flavored brown ale. It's nutty and very malty with a very balanced hop character. I recommend this beer to all fans of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Enjoyed in a pint glass, pours the deepest brown you can get (black) under a thinning but well preserved head. A moderate aroma of roasted malt, light licorice and deeply roasted nut timidly calls to the nose. An overall smoky flavor highlights a crisp and roasted malt dominated body. Vanilla, roasted caramel and ground coffee are coming in on my palate. With regards to the smokiness in the flavor, this may be the only time I've been able to appreciate it because of how well balanced it is with the other flavors at play here."
""
""
""
"O - This one was a pleasant surprise boasting loads of flavour in an unsuspecting way. For a brown ale this will certainly please any fan of the style."
"O - Not a very memorable brew. Seemed rather typical or ordinary. Don’t think they were going for this."
""
""
""
"Overall a good surprise, candy like finish. Nice beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"It looks decent in the glass, though, and it has a characteristic for the style, if mild, taste and aftertaste. won't go out of my way for this, but it was worth a try. I think there are better examples of the style."
""
""
""
"O: A decent little beer and actually a nice summer beer--light and refreshing and in a can, which is nice; one of my favorites from Stevens Point"
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, it’s a solid beer but there are others in the style that I would pick first."
""
""
""
"This beer pours black, period. There's a thin tan head and no lace. The aroma is toast, nuts, and a hint of dark cherries. Mild maple and molasses shows as it warms. The flavor is bread crust, nuts, and a hint of anise with Root Beer Barrel candies coming through as it warms. It's mouthfeel is medium and mildly warming. Stevens Point 2012 Black Ale is a very good, complex brew. Highly recommended."

"Pours a three finger khaki head that fades slowly leaving some lace. Black color, no highlights. Light carbonation and light-medium bodied. Malty chocolate nose, flavor is roasted malt and caramel. $1.95 for a 12oz bottle from Bert’s Better Beers Hooksett, NH."
"A little sweetness alights on the palate, along with some caramel and a hint of nuttiness. Has some mild bitterness, with the hops exhibiting a bit of citrus and florality. No too bad at all; somewhat of a decent session bier. Prosit!"
""
""
""
""
""
"M. Lighter side of medium body, good carbonation levels, nothing out of the ordinary here."
"O: Smooth enough for easy drinking, yet has enough body to be satisfying. One of my favorites from Point."
"Overall - Stevens Point Brewery, you have really creative ideas when it comes to marketing your products but your actual beers come off as disappointing because there's little to no flavor at all. I'm pointing this out in particular because this would've been an absolutely phenomenal brown ale had there been more flavor, but right now it just comes off as a good idea for a brown ale executed poorly."
"Overall: This beer is smooth enough for consecutive drinking yet flavorful enough to hold your interest. It’s what I’d call a “yummy” beer. Though I drank this without food or smoke, I would imagine it would be quite good with a steak and baked potato or some dry-rub barbeque like ribs or brisket. 2012 is good enough that I would drink it again, and good enough that I would recommend it to a friend, especially those who enjoy nationally distributed brown ales like Newcastle or 1554."
""

"2012 Black Ale is pretty smooth drinking and very mild. I recently had a few pints of this at a local downtown cigar bar. They didn't have any stouts on tap, so I opted for this at their only ""darker"" option, something I would hope would hold up to the mild cigar I was having. It didn't pretty decent job."
""
""
"Not bad, but not clear exactly what style was the target."

"12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Pours black as night, not a bit of color in this one. The head is a chocolate, nice solid lacing. There's just a slight malt scent, it's subtle, tempting. I like that in women and in the smell of my malts. This has a little bit of a chocolate flavor to it. Nice smoky wooden taste kicks in the back. Almost porter like, but doesn't quite have the right texture to it. This is a perfect winter sipping beer. 2-3 of these is probably enough. It might be the best thing Point's ever done."
""
"Expected from American Brown Ales in a bolder hop presence of citrus, pine, and/or grass. But those lack, whereas the fairly neutral yeast character and moderate malt dryness come through nicely if not timid. Very drinkable and enjoyable- if now underwhelming."
""
"O-easy to drink and well balanced"
"Had this beer on tap. Pretty tasty. I've never been a big fan of dark beers but this one is pretty tolerable. Pours a pretty decent head. Roasty coffee notes with a clean finish. It was good enough to purchase a sixer. Not as good as some dark beers but better than others."
""
"O: Nice beer. Overall, not overly impressed with anything, but this is a good beer. Nice overall balance of flavors. Cool label. I probably would not buy this beer again though. Also, they say the beer is themed on the Mayan calander, yet an Aztec calender adorns the label."
""
"Nice, sharp carbonation gives this black ale a crisp and refreshing feel. medium bodies and flavorful. Not a favorite, but I would recommend and I will definitely drink this one again."
""
"O: Very pleasant flavorful beer."
""
"O: Nice beer, easy drinker. Nothing dynamic but not a bad offering from the brewery."

"D - Clean and refreshing black ale taste; I really liked this; had great roasted malt characteristics and the flavor stayed consistent, sip after sip"
""
" Low ABV, high complexity indeed."
"Just an okay beer."

"From the 12. fl. oz. bottle sampled on October 29, 2011. The pour is a rich black with a thin head but at the same time it is not completely blocked from light like a stout might be. The sweet maltiness kicks in on the nose right off with a slight cherry cough drop mixture. The overall body is medium but there is also a kind of sticky, heavier quality to it. The taste is full of sweetness and molasses. It is a likeable beer that works well in its own way."
"Tastes mild, with some lightly roasted malts coming through. I get a little burnt cocoa, too. This one seems simple and uncomplex. Still, definitely session-worthy, despite being a mite thin."
"I was expecting a Cascadian Ale, Black IPA, whatever you want to call it, but this is a pretty good brown ale, anyway."
"O - more subtle than bold, this is a well-crafted beer worthy of attentive consumption."
"2012 Black Ale pours a black, stout like color, with a very small white head. The smell was malty, and nutty. The taste was full, malty, with a bit of a nutty flavor. Very typical to a brown ale. Good full taste, no watery flavor that some brown ales might have, good carbonation. Overall this beer delevers on the most important factor taste, different for a brown ale in other catagories, but a good beer."
"Point's beers seem to have improved a lot over the last decade. I will be getting more of this one."
"Tan head bubbles up nicely on the pour over nearly black ale, as advertised. A very light mouthfeel is the weak point of the beer. Watery base has a light roast malt, but not overly complex or interesting. More coffee than roast in the nose, which is fine,and none of the Cluster, Saaz and Cascade hops listed in the brewery's website description. Overall, a serviceable beer for the night and a standard beer for Stevens Point."
"Poured a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. This is a black brew with a thin head showing minor traces of lacing. The smell is of a rich dark roasted malt. I am tasting sweet coffee and a bit of pleasant nut flavor. The mouthfeel is full and pleasing with no dryness. This is an enjoyable session beer that I would happily drink again."
"Would I buy more of it? - possibly. Although I'm not within their distribution range. This is a nice beer, nothing too fancy but solid. If you like dark beers with a lot of flavor but not too heavy this is a good one."
"All that said, it's still a nice refreshing dark alternative on a hot summer night."
"thank you sir, but you can keep the other."
"The beer is light in body - lighter than it looks like it would be."
"Overall: a good alternative to the lighter summer beers. Dark, effective, with portents of the end of the world from the Mayan calendar. Drink up: the end is near!"
"Overall not a bad beer, has some redeeming qualities but not something I would probably drink to much of."
"I'm naturally drawn to dark beers, stouts and schwarzbiers and the like, so I figured I'd give this ""black ale"" a try. It was more of a ""dark"" brown ale than anything, I thought. Poured into a pint glass, a cola brown color with a small off-white head. Mildly roasty aroma, with notes of brown sugar and bread. Toasted malts in the taste, pumpernickel, and hints of coffee and sugar. Overall pretty lacking in the flavor department, really. A bit watered down. Just barely medium-bodied, and hmm...probably not something I'd get again."
"O - Its a decent beer, not bad, but also not one I would seek out again. Wanted to try it, I did. I can say I gave it a shot and enjoyed it for what it was."
"D/O- Very nice flavor profile for something so low in ABV. Would be a nice one around a campfire on a cool summer night. But again: Twist offs in craft...too weird."
"RJT"
"O - Sweet, malty and dark, but wasn't convinced it is a black ale."
"The mouth is adequate with sharp carbonation. This is a nice, easy drinking black beer. Glad to see it added to Point’s line-up."
"It's OK I guess if you like burnt malt flavors but I would have preferred more flavors than that. Didn't care for it that much."
"Overall this was an Ok brew. I really don't know what style this beer fits in, the label says its a black ale, BA says its a American Brown Ale, to me it feels like a combination of the two, this is a hard beer to classify. But in the end it went down smooth and easy and it had no offensive flavors to it. I would drink this again but I wouldn't go out of my way to find it. Not bad for my first Stevens Point brew, I would be willing to see what else they got."
"Overall this is a well balanced brew and a nice warm day kind of brew."
"Wonderful beer. Brownish color with a thick tan head that dissapates quickly. Smells of roasted malts. Tastes of malts and chocolate. Mouthful says it all with the tastes. Goes down smooth and tastes of an excellent black ale. Drinkablity is very high. One would want a decent six pack to drink with his buddies."
"O - A decently taste ""Black ale"" for the price. Picked it up just because the name was impressive, but it's just a bit above average."
"Overall glad I picked this single up. Fairly easy to drink and smooth full flavors. Might consider a six pack but would love more cocoa or coffee. Good beer."
"Call it brown or black, this comes across as a light porter. Tasty and drinkable from a brewer I've thought of as on par with Saranac for being merely passable. Dumb name for a beer, though."
"Drinkability: A nice easy drinking beer. A decent offering from a brewery whose beers I have found to be just adequate. I'd buy this again at the price I purchased this 6-pack for ($5.99)."
"this beer officially gets my worst rating of all time...."
"taste-Black patent malt, milk chocolate, coffee with cream. Super-smooth and creamy. Very nice ""all-day"" lacing. More porter-like than brown ale. Very tasty and drinkable. A great match with a juicy cheeseburger or spicy tacos1"
"D: Decent drinkability, though shallow on depth and substance. An end of the world drink? Hardly. Better then most of their offerings."
"D=The slight sweetness and lightness makes this a beer one could drink several bottles of without a problem."
"The body is light, but brings out the most of the roasted malts along with caramel and hints of dark fruits. There isn't a lot to the mouthfeel, but it's pleasant and the malts are too cloying."
"Ya' know this is a reasonable flavorful beer. Nicely hopped over a mild roast body. I'd drink this again. Probably try to find a way to flatten it some."
"Additional: Overall it could be a pickup for a six pack, but not a long running session beer. Best beer for under $3."
"A good middle of the road beer no matter what it's called."
"Average brew. Another decent Point offering."
"It came in a glass from tap as a very dark beer with a nice head and a very appealing look. It had a very nice, sweet smell and had great substance. It hit the mouth with a nice, sweet bite and went down very nicely. The depth of flavor wasn't as deep as expected and was the only thing missing from this beer. It was a pleasant surprise and I hope to drink it again."
"A catchy idea from Point. But Point should have just brewed a stout instead of a stoutish brown ale. Good Drinkability but the D Train lost interest half way through."
"Figured I'd taste the apocalypse before it tasted me, though I didn't expect this to be a brown ale (especially considering the name), but oh well. It pours a lightly hazed burnt sienna topped by a finger of dusty ecru foam. The nose comprises light maple syrup, light cinnamon, and light molasses. If it weren't so light, it'd be more enjoyable. The taste makes these elements even lighter, adding a touch of cola to the proceedings in the process. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a thick watery feel. Overall, a decent brew, nothing special, but not quite what I was expecting either. For a normal brown, though, it's not too bad."
"Drinkability: this is a so-so black ale that wants to really be a schwarzbier. Easy to drink but it grows tiring quickly."
"This beer says black ale on the bottle, but it sure as hell pours a brown color. I now know from looking at this site it's a brown ale, but honestly you'd think a black ale should be a schwartzbier. I feel lied to. The smell has a lot of maple syrup going on in it. Perhaps it's blending with some toffee notes as well. The taste is more along the lines of toffee due to the flavor being on the nutty side however the flavor in general is rather weak in this beer. The mouthfeel is pretty watery, to the point that It's hard to tell this is actually a beer. The drinkability of this beer is good, there is nothing off-putting enough to send people away from this beer, but overall it's not nearly close to being a favorite. I'll pass on this Armageddon ale on to the next person, maybe they'll enjoy it more than I."
"Pours a translucent dirty brown with a thin white head and not much lacing. The smell is sweet with hints of caramel and nutty toffee. The taste upfront is slightly sweet with hints of caramel and nuts. Faint smokey roasted grain notes combine with an astringent bitterness at the finish. The flavor doesn't hold together very well. It's watery and bland with just a slight smokey bitter aftertaste. Thin watery mouthfeel as well. Not awful tasting beer, but not good either. My buddy got me a six pack of this because I'm always joking about the comet thats coming in two years. Cool concept but mediocre brown ale."
"This beer pours a dark brown almost black color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes quickly into minimal lacing. The aroma is of toffee, caramel, and a hint of flowers. It is a rather strong aroma. The taste on the other hand is very faint. There is some light caramel, but not much else. The mouthfeel is fairly light, with a watery texture. Overall, this is a pretty bland beer that I can't see myself drinking again."
"Too bad the taste did not measure up. The flavor was not unpleasant but weak and one-dimensional, and the mouthfeel rather watery. Not bad, but nothing to seek out."
"Okay. Brown ales are not really my favorite style, but this is just okay whether it is a brown ale or if Stevens Point is trying to be creative with a black ale style, it really does not ""wow"" me."
"Pours an extremely dark brown that becomes black in the glass, with one finger of brown head with good retention. This is a brown ale? There is no single predominant aroma, but rather, a three way tie between roastiness, walnuts, and dark chocolate. An intriguing nose. The flavor features a complex interplay of the aforementioned elements, with a sweet roastiness lingering on the finish. Body is bit lighter than I would like, but overall this is a fascinating ""brown ale," that would probably be better described as a brown-stout hybrid."
"This tastes and feels like a brew around seven or eight percent alcohol. Really flavorful for a beer of this abv. Drinks nicely as I could have a couple two or three of these. A nice sessionable winter beer perhaps. Kudos to Point on this one."
"D: An oddly compelling, drinkable beer."
"Overall - Enjoyable beer. Nice flavor and good alternative when you are in the mood for something dark with roasted flavor but do not want anything real heavy."
"D-Lots of flavor, while still smooth-feeling on the way down. While it may be easy to drink, it is also not a terribly memorable beer."
"d- good, solid beer here. glad i got the chance to try this, better than i was expecting, i would drink this again."
"Mouthfeel is thin and watery. The aroma and flavor isn't too bad, although, it doesn't really remind me of a brown ale. Although BA's style guideline for American Brown Ales claim 'This style also encompasses ""Dark Ales",' so I guess that would cover this beer. Overall it wasn't a bad beer to drink, but I question it's style classification and it doesn't stand out in anyway (as is true of most Point beers).."
"Not too shabby. It has good flavor and is also very easy going down. It can be very slightly watery, but it still has plenty of flavor."
"D: The unpleasant, astringent bitter flavor makes this beer pretty undrinkable. I regret that I have 5 more from the six pack to work through, because I don't think that I would drink another if someone offered it for free."
"Thin mouthfeel (like a premium American lager), well carbonated. Overall, I didn't really know what to expect from this, but I'm fairly unimpressed."
"Taste: Smooth carbonation with sweet chocolate and some coffee. Dark chocolate and roasted malts in the finish."
"Notes: Reminds me of a Schwarzbier more than a Brown Ale. Good amount of chocolate and some roasted flavors, along with a fair amount of earthy/nutty hops. Didn't wow me, but it was pretty refreshing and an easy, fairly enjoyable beer."
"Pours a deep black with a tan head. Smell is almost entirely dominated by roasted malts with tiny hop notes sneaking in here and there. Definitely more toward a schwarzbier in the nose and taste profiles. Taste is similar with roasted malt being about the only flavor. Mouthfeel is quite thin; body is almost entirely lacking. Drinkability is average. Nothing to make me want the next sip."
"D - Something about it seems just a little off and I'm definitely unsure of the correlation between the beer and the 2012 name based on the Mayan calendar besides the ""inspiration"" word listed on the bottle. I do however remember it being released around the same time as the movie under the same name. Marketing ploy for sales? The beer is average."
"This Stevens Point offering's name was inspired by the Mayan 'Long-Count' calendar that suggests that the world will end on December 21, 2012. If that's true, then you can be sure I will be spending my final days drinking something more worthy of the apocalypse than 2012 Black Ale."
"Pours a clear, dark brown color. 1/5 inch head of an pale tan color. Decent retention and slight lacing. Smells of roasted malt, grain, pale malt, hops, and a hint of wheat. Fits the style of an American Brown Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of roasted malt, slight hop, pale malt, slight yeast, and a hint of citrus. Ovearll, a decent brown; good body and blend."
"Saw this one while on vacation down in Nashville, at one time I had tried every beer Point made but I hadn't seen this one before so I had to give it a try. Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, 2012 is BLACK in the glass with just hints of ruby-brown at its edges. The head is dense and creamy, mocha in color and leaves nice sticky lacing on the glass. The nose is of dark chocolate, toasty notes, a bit earthy and woody. The flavor has similar characteristics, nutty, roasty, chocolaty and earthy. Mouthfeel is full bodied and creamy, carbonation is rather docile. Overall, a very drinkable beer and honestly better than I expected. They're better than BMC beer but not usually impressive; this one is probably the best I've had by them yet."
"Hell of a deal at $5.99 a six, too!"
"Overall this is a beer that you can drink and enjoy all year round not just during the fall and winter months when darker beers tend to be more popular."
"I tried this beer at the Magic City Brewfest. Then Stevens Point 2012 Black was all most black, could not tell about the head because it was on a 2 oz. sample. It Smells sweet, roasty, Nutty. It taste Sweet nutty and ends bitter. The mouthfeel is about average for the Schwarzbier style."
"Not bad for Stevens Point. I picked up a single at Princeton Liquors. The near black beer looked more like a Schwarzbier than a brown ale and tasted like a stronger (and better crafted) version of Yuengling Porter. It had the fruity dark chocolate flavor of a classic Baltic Porter, but then had a noticeably thin body that gave away the quasi-craft origins. The flavor dropped off pretty quickly, but what was there was quite pleasant."
"Pours a very dark brown, almost black, with a small dark tan head. I have seen porters and stouts lighter in color that this! Smell is a hint of coffee beans, and dried fruit. Taste is dry cocoa powder up front, with a tart malt middle, and an earthy, grassy finish. Mouthfeel is average, medium carbonation. Drinkability is good, rather light bodied for 5.4 percent alcohol. This is an enjoyable beer, but with so many better, similar beers, I doubt I will be buying this again."
"The beer pours a dark brown color with red highlights and a tan head. The aroma is toffee with some chocolate and earthy hops notes. The flavor is toffee and earthy hops with not too much else going on. Thin to medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Not a very exciting beer, but nothing too offensive either."
"Easy to drink and fairly light bodied like a Schwarzbier, hints of roast malt and coffee, flaccid and husky with slight diacetyl. Not particularly complex, but its not bad. Could drink 1-2 easily."
"Overall, it drinkability is about average. The aftertaste does not leave you wanting more. But the beer is worth a try, and it is nice to see this long time brewery pushing its limits and trying new styles."
"Black colored beer with a rapidly fading head.Aroma is very faint chocolate.Taste is nuts and chocolate malts.Taste is kind of weak and watery..slightly above average.I guess I would recommend to try at least once.I'm 50/50 on whether I would purchase again."
"This ale pours black with a moderate, but quickly diminishing tan head with a little lace. The aroma is moderately roasty with subtle caramel and bready malts. The flavor is moderate-high malt -- mainly nutty and chocolate with some roast and finishes dry. Nothing overly complex, but still tasty. The hop bitterness is medium-low, accented by the dry finish. The hop flavor is low but noticeable, slightly spicy. The carbonation is moderate and body medium-thin. Overall a flavorful ale with great drinkability."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, sweet up front, lip smacking, with bitter roast and mild hops found in the swallow."
"D - I could see drinking a six pack of this quite easily. It's not the best dark beer I've ever had but it's decent enough and would do well for someone in the mood for a stout but not in the mood for the mouthfeel."
"Not a bad beer, crisp and full of flavor, just a little thin."
"Drinkability: Easily drinkable and approachable and fairly reminiscent of the Schwarzbier style. While I haven't had a slew of beers from Stevens Point Brewery, this has been one of the better ones."
"D: Can't see this as a session beer. It sits a little heavy in the stomach."
"Overall I'm less than impressed. Point makes some decent beers usually. How ever this one missed the mark for me."
"This was one of the better beers I've had from Point, and worth a try."
"D - This is a very fine dark ale. It really seems more like a porter than a brown ale but it was quite good either way."
"Pours a slightly viscous dark brown from the bottle, and about a 1/2"" of tan head arises and quickly fades. Aroma is sweet and malty. In the flavor I get quite a bit of roasty coffee and slight chocolate/toffee notes. Mouthfeel is good - nice and smooth. A very easy-drinking ale. I like."
"Overall, not the best beer in the world, but I didn't have high expectations. Not something I would buy again. Just didn't have it going on. Not to drinkable imo."
"Aroma is malty with a subtle undertone of molasses and a whisper of yeast. It pours a nice opaque sable with a fairly thick and fluffy beige head. Flavor is malty and a little sweet, having a hint of molasses, but not too strong. Texture is a little on the watery side and just a little fizzy."
"Overall, this beer is very drinkable. It is like a combination of light and dark beers with reasonable components of each making it pleasant, refreshing and worth a trial if you can get it."
"Drinks pretty easy, not on ""point"" for the style, but close enough. Far better than most offerings from these guys. I look as this a pretty solid release from these guys & worthy of future purchases when hankering for some coffee/ licorice flavor, especially for the price"
"This brew was a deep dark chocolate brown color with a nice light brown 2 finger head. The aroma was strong of roasted malts, deep chocolate, mild coffee, and some subtle nuttiness. The taste was right on track with the aroma. Strong roasted malt presence with coffee and chocolate tones. There was a wonderful hop balance to this brew and the thick and creamy head went well with the moderate carbonation. This was a tasty treat after a 5 mile run! Very surprised with this brew and am happy to have it brewed in my backyard!"
" ~ This beer isn't going to change the world but it will make Stevens Point Brewery a bit more diverse. I think this beer was created for the purpose of giving us Point Beer faithful a nice, sessionable, dark, ale. I appreciate what Point is doing here and I will definitely support their efforts. I suggest you do the same."
