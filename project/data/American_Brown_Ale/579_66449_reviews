"Presentation: Packaged in a standard twelve-ounce brown glass long neck bottle with a pry-off crown, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice."

"Off white head that lingers. Appears reddish brown. Aroma is light but very pleasant of toasted coconut. Taste of vanilla and light toasted coconut with light body. Caramel notes emerge as it warms. Fantastic concept but I wish there was more body or sweetness to enhance the coconut flavor."

"A very weakly flavored brown ale – the coconut is totally undetectable in this batch.  It is, at best, unoffensive."

"Two things I really loved about this beer. The price and the taste. The price was right since this is a big brewer and supply is ample. Not a lot of other beers I would take to a party for this price and feel like I'm taking this quality. The taste is exactly what it's advertised to be. Nutty brown ale with a bunch of coconut in there. I love it when a beer gives you exactly what you're expecting. Not saying I don't enjoy a complex brew but when drinking in the yard with friends you don't need to go crazy on in depth flavors and explanations. If you're a fan of brown ales and coconut separately, than combine them and enjoy a tasty beverage."

"Picked this one up as part of a mixed 6 at Ye Ole. Outstanding looking beer with a very interesting smell. Not the normal brown smell, very interesting. Same with the taste, you definitely notice the coconut which adds some uniqueness to the flavor that I really like. Very smooth and easy to drink. I enjoyed this beer very much and would certainly be wiling to buy in the future."
""
""
""
"Overall a great beer in my opinion. I really like the maltiness of this beer and the coconut taste is wonderful. I would like more of the coconut taste to come out but still, this is a great tasting beer."

"A brown ale that looks good on paper but pretty much fails to live up to the hype. The malt and hop marriage doesn't quite gel and seems to have a slightly off-flavor in the aftertaste. The body feel lacks depth and feels watered down. Sure, you get some deep roasted grain flavors with some chocolate and cocoa notes, and there is a noticeable (though not overbearing) coconut element to the flavors, but things just don't seem to mesh well. Not bad but hardly a strong representative of a good brown ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall a nice addition of toasted coconut with a sweet malt body makes this a drinkable brown ale that was well balanced and worthy of multiples."
"Overall - Pretty good, even though I don't like coconut."
""
""
""
"O: They could have gone overboard with the coconut, and luckily they only did a little. It's definitely the predominant note, but it's fresh and real, and rounded with some classic malty porter notes. I'm bringing some next time I go to the beach."

"Poured this into my snifter because my pint glass was no where to be found :("

"O- I'm a big coconut fan, but this really wasn't what I was hoping for. The coconut never quite tasted like coconut, and every aspect being graded was weaker than I prefer. I don't want to dis Kona; Fire Rock Pale Ale is one of my go-to's, but this one just didn't measure up for me."

"If you like Brown beer and are a fan of Coconut, this is a fantastic brew...just tried it for the first time. Reasonable price $5 on tap. The coconut aroma lets your taste buds know what's coming. Good bite and flavor, smooth on the palate. Best brown I've tried yet."
""
""
"Poured into a glass, this beer has a beautiful red glow. The coconut is obvious on the nose, dominates the aroma, however it is much harder to actually taste. As far as ales go, there is not much that sets this one apart. That being said, this is still a very drinkable drink that grows on you."

"Nice caramel brown color, thick head that leaves nice traces on the top as well as the glass. Its a bitey brown and what got me to try this in the first place did not disappoint, that's the toasted coconut. The subtile aftertaste of the coconut is amazing as well as the other flavors that pop up, such as macadamia and almond. I can only dream and assume how well this beer will go with some pineapple and glazed ham! Aloha!!!"

"I Have tried EVERY American brown ale and specialty brown ales available in my area and even the Rouge hazelnut or Dogfish heads brown ale does not touch this one IN MY OPINION! It just smells amazing and tastes so good in summer or winter. I buy cases of it when it comes out and never want to drink the last ones. :) would love to try on tap."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 12/5/2013. Pours crystal clear ruby brown color with a 2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big caramel, chocolate, coconut, toffee, toast, brown bread, brown sugar, vanilla, light nuttiness, herbal, floral, and toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and coconut notes; with good strength. Taste of big caramel, chocolate, coconut, toffee, toast, brown bread, brown sugar, vanilla, light nuttiness, herbal, floral, and toasted earthiness. Light earthy herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, chocolate, coconut, toffee, toast, brown bread, brown sugar, vanilla, herbal, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, coconut, and light earthy hop flavors; with nice robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy and smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice brown ale! All around good balance, complexity, and robustness of dark/bready malt and coconut flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"Drinkable, but unlikely something I will revisit in Hawaii."
""
""
"Overall: A nice brown ale. The coconut brings this up a few notches and add a good flavor to the beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: a well-made, quaffable brew.... depth in flavor and body is unfortunately held back.... the one time I've had this on tap the flavors were more bold and the feel smooth and more fulfilling, so I suppose the carbonation in this particular bottle hurt it..."
"Overall, Koko Brown is an average-at-best brown ale. If you like coconut, this would be a nice choice... especially on a very hot day, as it isn't at all heavy, and it would be easy to have a few. I'm not sure I'd buy it again, but I certainly wouldn't say no to a bottle or a pint. 3.5/5 overall just because I could see this being a solid choice on a hot summer day."
""
""
""
"Overall a good beer but nothing special. Wish the coconut stood out a little more and had more sweetness, seems more of a general roasted nut taste to me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A rare specialty beer that works. Brown drinkers, coconut fans, and someone looking for a dark that doesn't have the same old profile will find something to enjoy here."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O. Great beer, I'm a fan"
"O: This is a pleasant surprise. So many 'Murican brown ales go the 'balanced' route, yet aren't really that delicate or sophisticated to compensate for its less exciting flavor profile. But this is. Brown ale is a hit-or-miss style with me - this isn't an emphatic hit, but damnit it's a hit nonetheless."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: An interesting beer, to say the least. Not too bad, but also far from great or inspiring. Something is missing here."

"I really, really want to like these Kona Beers, but something just keeps holding me back. Of all the Kona's I have had, this one is by far the best. The Koko Brown has a rich brown color with a frothy head that has staying power. The scent and taste is definitely strong in the roasted area and distant with regards to coconut - almost a good blend. The mouthfeel is bold and thick, complementing the full ale flavor. However, overall, I had to be honest with myself and grade them almost outstanding - close, but just no cigar."
"This is pretty much what I like in a brown ale- relatively sweet, but with some nutty bitterness to balance, with just a little complexity, but overall rather simple. I seldom see this where I live, although the other flavors of Kona are generally available. I picked this up in a Three Bears Alaska store for about $7.50 a sixer (cheap)."
"Amber color, no head. Has a sweet vanilla and coconut aroma and flavor. Body is a bit on the sickly sweet side, but the carbonation cuts that away in the finish. Has a creamy, medium-body feel. I’m glad I tried it, but I don’t think I’d go out of my way to get another."
"One of my favorite beers. Beautiful mahogany color, nice aroma, velvety mouth feel and a finish that leaves me ready for another one. The coconut flavors really come out after warming up a bit. Overall, a really great balance between hops and malts and a unique and tasty combination of flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle poured in a pint glass. Smell is pleasant enough a little malty sweetness and some toasted notes, no discernable coconut however.  Mouthfeel comes up short very thin feeling, makes me go back for another sip but has me looking for something more.  Taste is nice, sweet malt is back again along with the toast, after really trying I get the coconut but it doesnt stand out at all.  A decent brown ale but nothing special and if I didnt say coconut I probably would never have known."
""
""
""
""
""
"Deep mahogany brown in color. A quarter inch of of white foam rests on top. Brussels lacing. The aroma is of coconut and caramelized malt. There's definitely a sweetness that dominates. The mouth is a bit carbonated and warm. There's bit of a cloying aspect between the caramelized malt and the intense sweetness from the coconut. The taste is an intense dark maltiness that is quickly overwhelmed by the sweet coconut."
""
""
""
""
""
"Points for nice coconut flavor."
""
"A few moments latter I sniffed the glass and swiftly took my first full sip. Wham. I was hit by the coconut. The more I drank the more the coconut overpowered. It was so good out of the bottle, I really wanted to like the glass. I couldn't finish. Maybe I'll give it another try but keep it in the bottle. Possibly I'm overwhelmed by the coconut aroma and I liked the first sip out of the bottle because my nose wasn't in the glass."
""
""
""
"O: Tasty brew. I love coconut in brews - it adds a smoothness and cuts the bitterness in dark ales and leaves you with a creaminess & great drinkability. Not overdone, but well done."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a pleasantly balanced beer. I was afraid that the coconut flavor would either be non-existent or over powering. It was neither. You get a pleasant hint of coconut that blends nicely with the overall nuttiness of the beer. It's especially nice to drink during the winter, dreaming of warmer, tropical days."

"Poured into a Dogfish Head pint glass. Pours a medium mahogany brown with a thin light tan head that dissipates to patchy foam and a ring around the glass. Aroma of coconut, caramel malt, slightly nutty. Flavor is biscuit malt, sweet coconut, nuts with a light grassy hop finish. Light to medium bodied. A light bodied brown ale with a well balanced, but assertive coconut flavor which has a slightly artificial taste. A pleasant, fun to drink ale that definitely leaves a tropical feeling."

"I am not the biggest fan of brown's but the allure of coconut on a cold snowy night was too much so I grabbed a single and gave it a shot. Sleek deep chestnut appearance with about half inch of head which receded relatively quickly with minimal, spotty lacing. Aroma was all of the coconut I was looking for. Mouthfeel was a little thin but smooth with the moderate carbonation and the taste was a pleasant blend of brown ale nuttiness, coconut sweetness and a lightly bitter finish. Overall I would say its a pretty tasty beer. Was a great way to fill a craving but not necessarily something I would run out and buy otherwise."

"I cant believe i havent rated this beer yet. The best brown ale I have ever tried and followed closely by bells best brown ale. The 2 are so similar other than the koko brown has coconut flavor. take everything i said in my review of best brown and add the coconut and its so undiscribable"
""
""
""
""
"Overall/Comments: A very good brown ale that is very drinkable with a tasty flavor profile that is worth a try. I would def drink again but wouldn't seek out and buy this. Classified as an American Brown Ale @ 5.5%. Consumed 9/8/2013."
""
"O - Unexpectedly good, the coconut is the most pronounced of any coconut infused beer I've had, and it works well in a brown ale. Will have again."

"This pours a medium brown color with a slight beige head. There isn’t much to the aroma but a slight scent of coconut. The flavor is dark, complex, and full of coconut. This is pretty unique and the best part is it tastes good too. A well made brew from that far south-west state!"
"Wow, am I torn on this one. Not much of a beer, but man, does it taste like all the best parts of coconut - lush and tropical. If all they did was add toasted coconut to the secondary, then I need to double down for my next coconut porter. Sessionable, one-dimensional, gimmicky and darn tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O= I've had a lot of this beer. One of the things I like about it is that it's a unique flavor with the coconut without being over bearing. Kona does a nice job of adding unique ingredients without making it taste gimmicky. I love this beer."
""
""
"Overall: I happen to like coconut and Mounds are one of my favorite candies (not that I am a big candy eater) so I rather enjoyed this beer; I would prefer it if it were a coconut porter but it is what it is"
""
""
""
""
"Decent brown ale, but lacks in hops for an American style. Coconut was a nice complement."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Let me close out by saying I generally hate the taste of coconut besides when it’s in coconut shrimp and those girl scout cookies with coconut in them. That being said, I liked this beer and even though it was odd for a brown ale, the coconut seemed to work in the brew. This is a one trick pony, and has a very basic flavor, yet somehow the coconut and vanilla made this enjoyable to me."
""
""
"Not all that impressive. A bit clear from the pour led to a watery feel that ruined this."
""
""
""
""
""
"The Verdict: Different. It's pretty good, and the coconut isn't too heavy, but... I'm not sure if I'm drinking a beer, eating a Mounds bar, or swallowing a Red Rock Cola."
""
"I actually had my first Koko Brown when my wife and I were on vacation in Waikiki so I had to make it one of my first kegs. Kona had just started to distribute to Ohio."
"A nice production from the island. Poured into a pint glass, at first I thought it was a dark brown but it has more red tints in the light. Great smell of vanilla and coconut and not overbearing. The taste really brought out more of a toasted coconut and reminded me of an unsweetened macaroon - I mean that as a good thing too. It didn't have the sticky aftertaste I was expecting and that was refreshing. I'd gladly have another one."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I'm fairly impressed by this beer. Not something I'd drink all the time, but a solid change up from the types of beers that tend to be so popular these days. Surprisingly refreshing for a brown ale."
""
""
""
"My pour was creating a good bit of head so I backed off to allow it to settle a little before proceeding. I started with close to two fingers of foamy, light-tan head, but the intense carbonation caused it to bubble and burp its way out of existence. Truth in advertising strikes again! It was, indeed, a mahogany-brown with NE-plus quality clarity, enabling me to see through walls. The neighbors need to let the dog out, apparently. Nose was rich with caramel and coconut and I was reminded of a ""Peanuts"" strip in which Linus or Lucy had a box of chocolates and inadvertently chose a coconut and then made a face. I remember thinking that I liked coconut as a kid and especially my grandmother's pound cake with coconut frosting. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was initially rich with coconut, but then the caramel and chocolate of the malt began to kick in and it was like liquid candy! Finish was decidedly sweet and you had best like coconut going into it because that was the lingering flavor. I can promise you that this type of thing is not usually my bag, but as an occasional step away from intense hops, I liked it. You have to decide for yourself as to whether it would be to your taste."
""
"I was really not expecting to like this beer at all, but man. Homerun. The toasted coconut flavors and the toasted brown malt go together like peanut butter and chocolate. A perfect match. A great session beer, but could also go really well with dessert. (I'd vote for chocolate ice cream on a warm day) ;-)"

"D- not so bad, but the ""natural flavor added"" never works for me. Strangely refreshing however (if you're thirsty) and unoffensive."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A well-made brew, but I would have liked more coconut character. The toasting seemed to have diminished the coconut flavor, and the tropical fruit aroma/flavor masked it as well."
""
""
""
"I poured this nice beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was a nice mahogany color and poured a really pretty nice tan head. The smell was yummy tasty and complex. The taste was yummylishious with coconut mounds bar type thing going on. A really interesting beer. I will buy this again foe sure. A really good beer."

"The beer pours a mahogany brown with a head of medium sized soap bubbles on top that bubble and fizzle into a scrim over the beer. The beer’s body is clean and clear, though dark from the malts. On the nose, the beer smells chocolaty, almost to a syrupy level. There is a nice gentle roast that reminds the nose of coffee, caramel, and just a light hint of coconut nuttiness, but chocolate seems to be the big player in the nose. On the tongue, the beer tastes sweet and slightly savory with a lot of “synthetic-like” flavors coming through. In flavor the beer begins as light chocolate and moves into a slight coconut flavor that gives slightly plasticy flavors. These flavors crescendo into a short finish of mediocre chocolate, caramel, plastic-coconut, and slight biscuity malts. The aftertaste is light and slightly roasty with hints of chocolate. To me, the flavors suggest a watered-down English Brown Ale with very slight hints of coconut. In the mouth the beer feels on the light side of medium in body with a weak carbonation that simply peppers the tongue and then washes away. The mouth is left slightly dry with a touch of wet saliva. Overall, I am underwhelmed by this beer. I want more coconut flavor, and I want a thicker beer. The flavors are not disgusting, but just come off as “meh.”"
""
""
"Overall a great try for me, as I'm not gonna get to the islands any time soon to get one on draft."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: Somewhat unique and lighter on the coconut than I was expecting. Still still tasty and sessionable. A little gimmicky but still pretty fun to drink."
""
"Toasted malt. A little nutty. Toffee and dark fruit sweetness fill in. Nutty, toasted coconut flavor develops and gets pretty strong toward the finish. Hints of vanilla and licorice. Lingering coconut and toffee sweetness in the finish. Medium to moderate body with a somewhat slick feel. Not bad, but not one I would want more than one of in a sitting."
""
""
""

""
""

""

"Eh. Not the best brown ale out there. I appreciate the creativity but this one was a flop in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
"Eric"
""
"Overall: Kona recently showed up in MN so I picked up a single of this. The coconut flavor does come through but there's an artificial vanilla flavor that just takes over too much of the palate. Having a little more roast or coffee base with the coconut could be very good. Just missed the mark here."
""
""
""
""
"Taste was excellent. The coconut was subtle, which is good because it could easily overpower a brew. Nice and smooth to drink, if a bit thin for the style. Great beer, easy to drink. Definitely worth repurchasing. Glad to see it finally available here, I'd been wanting to try this."
""
""
""
"O- I was really looking forward to a good commercial coconut brown ale and this was not it. Lots of artificial flavors and more like a soda pop than a beer made it a bit hard to finish the bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This was basically toasted coconut butter in a glass. If that's your thing, knock yourself out. I'm not a vegan, so I only sample the stuff from time to time."
""
"After about eight of the twelve ounces poured from this bottle have been consumed, I finally got it. It smells like whiskey! Jack Daniels and brown sugar. This is not a note that I have before experienced in a brown ale, but it works in this one. Whiskey and toasted kokonut make this a unique brew--and unlike many sweet ales it tastes as if it is stronger rather than weaker than the actual alcohol content. It tastes like hard alcohol--whiskey--but instead it's only...wait it does not say what percent on the bottle. BeerAdvocate says it's 5.5% but the spot on the bottle where the ABV was listed on other Kona brews is just empty space on the Koko Brown label. I guess I should be ready if I start feeling hammered, since it did taste just like JD."
""
""
""
""
"A solid brown ale with an island twist. Great toasty flavor."
""
""
"O- I rather enjoyed this beer. It's maybe a bit too sweet and has sort of a strange, syrupy feel."
""
""
"I really enjoyed this beer and would get it separately or on tap. Yum! Desert beer!"
"Overall - greater I am going to have again."
""
""
""
""
""
"While I think it might have slightly too much bite, it's a well-rounded mouthfeel with a good creaminess and ample carbonation is a body hefty enough to hold it together without being too thick or heavy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium body and medium-high carbonation."
""
""
""
""

""
"Pours a brilliantly clear copper color topped with a small, but sticky and lush looking head. Ample lacing. Rich coconut enveloping aromas of toasted malt, hazelnut, and a wee bit of chocolate. The toasted coconut, of course, continues into the flavor. Nutty caramel, mild cocoa, maple, and vanilla. Pretty good...crisp, drinkable, not too sweet, not too clean. I think I'd actually bring some along to the beach if it was available in the summer months."
""
""
"At first sip, I was like whoa that's pretty good. A light to medium body, not overwhelming in flavor (mostly coconut, maple, hazelnut and toffee/coffee but light) it sits fairly flat, but when you take a nice sip it opens up and is very creamy and burst in your mouth, and fully opens up washes down clean and refreshing, and leaves your mouth wet and ready for more. Not overly swee or filling and is very drinkable. I'll have another.."
"Kona just recently started distributing to Ohio, so I'm confused why we'd get bottles born in November 2012. I'm assuming this isn't the freshest, but it's still solid. The potential is there to be something unique for the style. I'd like to try this fresher because I'm assuming the coconut would be more prevelant. This could be awesome when fresh."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Dark like a porter, coconut, brown sugar, toasted malt."
"Stay thirsty my friends!"
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a unique brew. I'm not a huge fan of coconut but it works."
""
"I never had a beer with coconut in it before, but then again before I started drinking craft beers, I never would have thought adding chocolate to a beer was a good idea either. I enjoyed this one, probably because they didn't over do it. Gonna try another one next time I have coconut shrimp and see how it pairs with that."

"Perhaps the coconut flavor is a little too strong for me. I'll leave it."
"It pours a clear reddish brown. It has an off white head with nice lacing and decent retention. The aroma is filled with toasted coconut and hints of caramel. The coconut transfers over the the taste very well, but It's not overpowering like I feared it would be. Instead it collaborates with malt and bitter cocoa for a very nice, very well rounded taste. The finish is very mild with a kiss of bitterness. It's medium bodied with moderate carbonation."
""
""
""
""
"Very drinkable, found this an enjoyable brown with decent flavor. I could see me buying this again"
""
"Taste is very coconutty-- with more of the chocolate hint featuring alongside. Very enjoyable. There's also a slight hint of hops late in the finish, bringing this around full circle. I dig this brew and will be revisiting."
""
""
""
""
""
"The toasted coconut gives this brown ale a nice flare. The beer pours a clear brown with very thin white head that is leaving a spotty lace. The smell includes spice and a touch of cocnut. The taste definitely has toasted coconut which also provides a bit of roastyness. In addition, there is definitely some bread/biscuit flavor...and also decent balancing hops. The mouthfeel is medium in body with smooth carbonation. Overall it is a good brown with an interesting kick. Definitely worth a try."
"Poured a clear medium brown color with a small cap of off-white head that receded to a thin ringlet. Sweet malt aroma, toasted coconut, brown sugar. The taste was pretty sugary, caramel malts, coconut candy, maybe a bit of milk chocolate. Not as good as it may sound...it was pretty artificial-tasting. Light-medium body, not entirely bad, and definitely worth a try, but not something I'd ever get again."
"Overall: An average brown ale that doesn't really bring much to the table in terms of coconut. I don't really go for brown ales to begin with, so this didn't wow me. Average at best."
""
"Light bodied wit average carbonation, and a toasted bread and coconut aftertaste. A nice effort from Kona."

"Overall: A pretty decent brown ale. Very coconut forward and on the sweeter side. An interesting take on the style."
"If you like coconut in a brown ale, this is where you go. If you don't, stay the hell away"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I'll be honest, this beer was decent enough to plow through a six pack in 90 minutes. A hair too sweet for my tastes, but much less so than some other Brown Ales I've attempted."
""
""
"Taste-Toasted coconut, toasted malt, a nice little bite in the finish seems to balance everything out. a bit thin-bodied but nice flavor and balance. Sessionable. Good with a burger or BBQ wings."

"This beer can be bought in keg form which is distributed by Anheuser-Busch, can only be bought in bottle form seasonal. I love the roasted coconut taste and i love coconut. The toasted mahogany flavor comes out. Not the avg Brown Ale."
"It delivered what the beer is advertising. Just not enough going on to warrant a good score. Just slightly above average."

"If the chocolate flavor in this brew was sweeter I think it would taste kinda like an almond joy."

"O-This might not be for everyone but it is for me. A top notch flavored brown ale. I would love to have this and Tyranena's Rocky's Revenge (bourbon barrel aged brown) on hand at all times for my brown ale's in my dream bar."
""
"O: Decent beer, if you like coconut. It's definitely not an outstanding beer, and there's not much to back up the coconut, but it's a nice change and it's well balanced."
""
"Sounds like the name of a bad blaxploitation flick... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear ruby-copper topped by a finger of sandy cream foam. The nose comprises lightly-toasted coconut and very little else, if anything, though a hint of wet grass may or may not find its way through at some points. Despite this not being the strongest of smells in the world, it does get to be a bit much at times. The taste adds in a bit of caramel-y toffee, but this is still mostly drowned out by the coconut. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slick-ish feel. Overall, this beer seems to deliver on one of its promises: it certainly has some coconut in it. Beyond that, though, not much else is going on. It's a sad excuse for a brown ale, with nearly none of the characteristics of the style, and its one note song gets to be tiresome after a relatively short while."

"This looks and feels like a great brown ale but the overly aggressive coconut ruins it."

"Toffee with a hint of coconut. Plus a little chocolate powder, toasted and roasted malt flavors of biscuits and pumpernickel bread crust. Mouthfeel is a little syrupy, but smooth and easy the rest of the way. Easy to drink, and you can taste just enough coconut, which is a big plus for me."

"An interesting idea with some good flavour combinations, but the execution is flawed. It smells pretty good, even if some of the flavours seem artificial (added perhaps?). The taste is lacking - some nice malt and coconut flavours up front but these vanish like shadows in the light, leaving a faint lingering sweetness. No depth. The body is poor - watery and insubstantial when the flavour demands a thick, smooth unctuousness. It's drinkable enough but could use improvement. Worth trying."
""
""
"O - A so-so appearance and a lackluster aroma diminish expectations, but the flavor really makes up for the initial shortcomings. This really has a great coconut and nutty flavor, making this a veritable liquid candy bar. Glad to find this random bottle kicking around a seldom visited store today. Not the freshest, but this is holding up nicely. Glad I was able to find this."

"Pours a two finger khaki head that fades quickly to a thin layer leaving some lace. Very dark brown color. Light-medium carbonation and light-medium bodied. Coconut nose. Flavor is a funky sweet coconut. Not your usual brown. $1.75 for a 12oz bottle from Beverage Warehouse Winooski, VT. Bottled Mar 28, 12."

"O: A dry than average version of an American Brown with a light touch of coconut. The base brown style is better than average with some great toasty malt aromas of chocolate and caramel that is complimented with the addition of toasted coconut."
"O - I was looking forward to this coconut beer, but I was left with a little disappointment...a little too sweet and overly toasted...I prefer the other coconut flavored beer from Hawaii...MAUI!"
""
""
""
""
"Not being a big fan of either brown ales in general, or coconut as a flavour, I saved his one for a thirsty night after a hot day. Dark brown colour, with slightly sweet aroma (not as sweet malt as many other browns I have tried). The result: a pretty drinkable brown ale, toasty with some complexity. A bit assertive carbonation. Sweetish with a tad of bitterness."
""
""
"The appearance of a label can get my attention and this one did. Poured into a glass, it had a short-lived head. The color is brown and appears attractive. I never was into coconut, and the taste is, without a doubt, dominated by coconut. So, I didn't go much farther than a few tastes."

"O# i fucking love this beer. never let it go. stay in my life forever. but not like married. like one of serveral girlfriends that i can call upon antime."

"Overall- A nice twist on the brown ale by Kona Brewing. I would have preferred more coconut in the beer, but otherwise it has some nice warm flavours."
""
"Mouthfeel: This appear to pour on the thin side and my palate agrees with the pour rather thin and weak."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into pint glass, bottled on April 03, 2012. This pours a clear light brown color with a short lived off white head. The smells are of coconut, nuts, other malts. The feel is medium to light. The taste is pretty sweet and not too bad, lots of sweet coconut, it overpower everything else."
""
"A different twist on a American brown ale. Definitely worth a try in my opinion. I have been having some brews from Kona lately and for the most part, they do a good job, which holds true here as well."
""
"O: This beer is very interesting and I think that the addition of the toasted sweetened coconut makes this example of American Brown Ale a little different. A little too sweet too be sessionable but definitely drinkable."
""
""
"O - Very drinkable. Great coconut flavor without overpowering the brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I really liked the smell, but the coconut just overpowered everything in the taste. Too bad. About a third to half the coconut would make this a really winner and let the rest of the ale show through."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I like this beer, I think the malt backbone is balanced and a nice complimentary coconut note."
"Kinda average in the glass. Clear cola brown with a two finger soapy head. Mild malt and toasted bread notes in the nose. Again a bready sweetness with chocolate and coconut flavors on the tongue. Clean finish with a mild bitterness some notes of charcoal. Light crisp feel with a bit of weight to it. A nice drinkable beer but just that."
""
""
""
""
"The thought of coconut in a beer was very enticing but overall pretty disappointing effort. Won't buy again."
"O- I wish the coconut was stronger in this beer, as it's advertised up in front on the package. However, it's a nice change up to the standard light summer ales I normally drink. Would buy again"
"Amazingly savory and deliciously smooth, this is one of those beers that you take shorter sips in order to let the beer last longer in the glass. But then there's the greedy part that wants to devour it all way too quickly. With only 12 ounces in my glass, I have quite a quandary!"
"O- It's a bit of a novelty with the chocolate and coconut flavors, but if those are your things you should try it. Not an everyday beer, but a good one nonetheless."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle @ home. I bought this on a whim. It sounded interesting. The beer looks like a brown should. The aroma was wonderful, like chocolate milk and coconut. Toasted coconut is front and center in the flavor. There’s also a nice hazelnutty, chocolate, caramel malty, and light toffee flavor. A touch watery but overall a good beer that is somewhat one-dimensional."
""
"Pours a clean, deep amber to brown in color with a light tan head. In the aroma, sweet caramel and a small citrus note. In the taste,cocoa powder and a small caramel roast. A small bite and a lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a dry orange citrus in the aftertaste. Big cocoa in taste, lots of orange citrus, but just above average."
""
""
""
""
""
"D- Honestly I hate coconut, if that is your thing it could be enjoyable. Even then I find it slightly watery. Not my favorite, but not a bad brew."
"O: While this beer does have some bumpy spots, it's still a drinkable brew."
""
""
""
"O - Aromas and flavors are mild, but too discrete to my taste. Though, it's an unusual and pleasant beer!"
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, it’s very solid beer to drink for a while if you’re in the mood for the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I actually enjoyed this beer. Definitely plays to the coconut side of the beer."
""
""
""
""
"I poured this beer into a pint glass. It has a nice dark brown color body with a little head that lays down quickly. The smell has some vanilla notes and some coconut hints to it. The taste is down right awesome. I get that toasted coconut flavor up front and then the richness of the brown ale on the back of the tongue. It has a nice mouth feel and overall a darn good beer."
"O: What a find. I grabbed a sixer to share with my Pops, and he now proclaims this his favorite beer of all-time. Me? It may not be my GOAT, but it's worlds better then I was expecting. You can bet your ass that I'll be reaching for this one anytime I wanna split a beer with my Dad. My thumbs are certainly up for what is Kona's finest bottled brew to date."
""
""
"Overall-I will not drink this beer again. I love coconut, but not in my beer. The idea surrounding coconut in beer sounds interesting, but when it comes down to drinking it, I'll take another brown beer instead. Nice try."
"Pours a dark, lightly hazed and reddish tinted brown, minimal cap of off white head. Scent leads with toasted coconut, hints of vanilla and toasted crusty bread, mellows into notes of toasted nuts and grain, light brown sugar and caramel. Taste of toasted coconut is quite intense in the first sip, brings more vanilla, rounds into a full toasted bread profile with light brown sugar notes. Medium bodied, slightly low in carbonation, lacing heft found in the style. Im torn with this beer, the idea is better than the execution, I love coconut and this beer has more of it than many similar beers, but a few short commings."
""
"A nice enough brown ale, though one duly overshadowed by the guest coconut fruitiness, but as a first-time visitor to this tropical locale, that seems a-ok to me, though I would be limited to a couple, as the balance does suffer somewhat."
"Overall: Interesting. I wonder if the toasted coconut might go better with a lager though."

"Taken on its own, its fine enough. Just don't expect anything too special and its a decent brown ale from Kona Brewing. If you're looking for a brown ale thats promising an extra bit of flavor, compare this to Rogue's Hazelnut Brown Ale and you'll see why I'm kinda disappointed here."
""
""
""
"O - Coconut lovers indulge! Just not for me."
""
"Overall: I loved the coconut flavor, but it really needs more to back it up. Just about what I expected."
""
""
""
"O- Not ba but i dont think i would try to encourage homebrewers to put coconut in the mix. It is definitly worth a try though."
""
"It's tasty and fun, but Im unlikely to want more than a bottle of this."
""
""
""
""
"Overall blech, so artificial tasting, lots of syrups and extract flavors, bad flavorings, sticky sweet and syrupy, no hops, barely drinkable. Seems like something a macro would brew claiming to be micro."
"O: A pretty decent beer with some interesting flavors. This would probably go great with some roasted meat or chocolate desserts."
"The alcohol was spot-on too as it was present but not distracting. While this isn't as good as Sam Smith's or Newcastle, there was nothing sticky or burnt about this beer. I could easily see myself having one in the dead of Winter or on a nice Summer night and I plan on having one of these with some frozen Thin Mints that I've had in storage for a while. Kona has a subtly nice offering here that's sure to please nearly everyone."
"A light brown color on the first pour into a Steinlager glass. The smell of light coconuts off the glass. First taste is a distinct coconut flavor with a brown ale backend. A light toasted coconut mouthfeel settles on the tongue. Overall, a good interesting beer especially on a hot summer day. A lighter version of a Coconut Porter from Maui Brewing. Think I'll have another."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Kona koko brown - pour is dark burgundy with tight tan head. Nose is nice, caramel malt with the toasted coconut blended in well. Some vanilla and fudge notes, toasted marshmellow, behind create a nice balance. The taste is much of the same. Light on the coconut with the nice fudge and vanilla. A hint watery in the finish but well blended malts and sweetness. Lighter body, higher carb probably is what detracts from the finish but smooth and soft on the palate."
""
""
""
"Edit: seems this is a winter release so I assume March 19th was a ""best by"" date. Still not a bad expired beer."
""
"A pretty good brew here to have a few. The only problem is the flavors can start to overwhelm after a while. My wife likened it to sun tan lotion...Good to try, not great to session."
"The beer pours a medium brown color with an off-white head. The aroma is full of chocolate and toffee notes, exactly what I expect from a big American brown ale. The flavor is more complex. There chocolate and toffee are still present, but the toasted coconuts also really come through and add to the overall flavor. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Very nice."
"O: Could have been worse but nothing to write home about for sure. Not enough chocolate aroma or flavor to be a decent brown ale, with or without coconut."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Prost!!!"
"It is a nice beer, the coconut flavors make it different. I think it is worth checking out, but not something I would want to drink on a regular basis."
"Overall: I like coconut and this one is a nice specialty beer. I understand the necessity for some bitterness here, but to me it needs to be a little less sharp or perhaps a different type of hops. I like the uniqueness and would pick up another six pack, but there are others I would get first."
"O: Decent but not something I'd want to drink a ton of...I think without the coconut this beer would have nothing to offer."
""
"Tried on draft at KBC at the Honolulu airport. A very nice light brown pour with a generous 2 finger white head. Decent spotting and lacing throughout. Smell is toasted coconut, nuts and some fruits. Taste follows the nose, but thankfully it's not a coconut bomb. It actually accents the beer nicely and I'm not a huge coconut fan. Definately a unique spin on the style and I enjoyed the effort. This has been my favorite offering from Kona. Fruits and nuts blend into the taste well. Pretty complex which was a surprise. Feel is medium with good carbonation. Like my brown with a bit more body, but it's adequate. Overall- A good effort with a unique spin on the style, more of a sessionable brown. It works for me and will try out of the bottle back home-"
""
""
"An interesting beer and expected from a Hawaiian brewer. You need to like coconut to like this beer. I am not a huge coconut fan but the beer works."
"O. After I tasted this for the 1st time, I must say that it wasnt horrible, but certainly nothing I would ever purchase again. Not at all a good session brew by any means. Im placing the other five beers on the bottom shelf of my fridge, incase Im out of beer, and thats all there is. The only other option is to pour them down the sink and feed the fish."
"D/O: This beer lacks balance. I like coconut, but not like this. It's not horrible, but there's nothing about this that would make me want to revisit it. I could finish it if I wanted to, but I don't need the calories, so down the drain it goes."
"Mouthfeel is creamy, semi sweet and bitter at the end with a thin finish."
"O: This is an excellent easily-drinkable spring/summer beer. A very nice change of pace from the usual brown ale, and very easy to chug through a few of these"
"O – Coconut; surely a gimmick, right? Well…actually this is a pretty decent beer, although definitely not something I would want to drink a six'er of. Who knew coconut and beer would make a drinkable combo? This one should get props for originality, as the coconut makes it pretty unique."
""
""
""
"Overall – This is a very easy drinking brew with a great aroma and flavor. While the body is a little weak, it definitely should not keep anyone from trying this one."
""
""
"An amiable oddity, and a deal at $3.39 for the 22 oz bottle. Seems to be a wife pleaser, so who am I to judge."
"O: Simple, but pleasing. You come for the coconut and, well, you stay for the coconut. There isn't too much else going on, the base beer is a little bland. An easy drink for a breezy summer night. Part of me wants to test this out as a mixer, but I think it would be easily overwhelmed."
""
""
""
""
"O- Overall, I like a good brown ale and this one has a nice little twist with the coconut. The coconut is not a distraction like I was worried about, it is very well placed in the brew."
""
"Definitely let this one warm up to get the full coconut experience."
"B-"
""
""
"I actually think the caramel tastes are stronger than the coconut.... That said there is a nice mellow coconut after taste."
""
""
"O - This beer would be great without the coconut flavoring, just as a brown ale. With wonderfully abundant coconut notes in the nose and a touch of coconut in the finish, this beer is taken to the next level of craft beers."
""
"I will say, I am a fan of all of Kona Brewing's offerings. That being said, I'd never had the Koko Brown until now. I poured it from a 12 oz bottle into a pilsner glass. Small off white/tan head, with a nice dark copper color. First sip was a nice carmel and coffee note, with slight hops on the finish. The glass laces nicely, and it's quite refreshing. Great drinkable beer. Not thick or heavy, but a good drinkin beer!"
"This wasn’t too bad if you’re looking for something a little lighter for the palate. You really have to let this warm up a bit too really get those coconut flavors to show and even then it seemed a bit overdone at times, but I was glad to at least find some other hop and malt flavors here to keep this mildly interesting. It’s certainly very drinkable for what it is."
"Overall: Not so much good but interesting. The finished is a little watery but this one has a lot of coconut flavor. Definitely worth giving it a try if nothing more than for its uniqueness."
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is thin and lackluster. With better aroma and mouthfeel, this would be a very solid coconut beer."
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a dark brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of toasted malts, some coconut. Taste is coconut up front, some toasted malts, easy drinking and refreshing. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a unique beer worth checking out."
""
""
""
"O: The addition of coconuts to this beer definitely makes the smell and taste very unique. It is also rather easy to drink, although I wouldn’t call it sessionable given the sweetness."
""
" Drink up!"
""
"O-this is a very tasty and very drinkable beer. i could get a lot of this and always enjoy it. the coconut isn't too pronounced but it is noticeable, and appreciated. definitely one of my favorite brown ales out there"
"Overall a bit cloying and singular in nature though a small glass with dessert might fit the bill. A better balance, aka less coconut and or more dark malts would kick this up a notch for sure."
""
""
""
"This beer poured out as a nice looking clear brown color with a nice looking off white head. The smell of the beer gives off some really nice notes of coconut and vanilla. The beer smell sweet for the most part. The taste of the beer is very nice in my opinion. I like the smoothness of the coconut how it comes into the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is a little on the creamy side and yet light and dry. Overall I was really impressed by this beer. I actually want to get a few more of these to have on hand for a little. Very good stuff in my opinion here."
""
""
"overall - a pleasantly flavored brew, although a bit thin."
""
"O: While only slightly sweet (and actually turning a bit bitter in the finish), this beer still seems best suited for use as a desert beer or, I imagine, as refreshment on a hot day."
""
""
"Overall: this is a decent beer that could be better balanced, especially vis-a-vis its signature ingredient, coconut. I also tried this beer paired with a chocolate dessert; in that environment, this beer shines when compared to sampling it alone. I highly recommend having this beer in that context."
"Overall: I like it, but it also doesn't resemble any other brown ale I've had. I can see how typical brown ale flavors play off and are enhanced by the coconut. I think the brewers could cut back on the sweetness, though."
"One of the few brown ales I actually enjoyed."
""
""
"Update: Now I've had one out of the bottle and it's not the same. It's still pleasant and I enjoyed it but on tap the flavors were so much fuller and richer. Leaving the scoring as the draught scoring."
"O - Enjoyed this one, and after looking forward to Koko Brown in NY I wasn't disappointed. For any fans of coconut it is a must try, and really worth checking out just for the nice take on the style."
""
""
"Interesting stuff and I am glad to have gotten a chance to have tried it while on vacation in the west coast. Makes me wish that more than only a few different coconut beers existed, the 'gimmick' seems like a pretty solid idea to me if it were to be done in a drier manner than this beer presented."
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is thin and watery, needs some body. An interesting beer, perhaps a bit gimmicky, tough to have more than one."
""
"Overall – not a bad tasting brew at all, but at the taste not terribly interesting."
""
""
"Nuff said on this... Half a glass and I was finished with this one... Maybe a bad bottle?"
""
"O - I love coconut, and the smells given from this beer satisfy the nose, but I had to work to find it in the flavors. This would make a nice late spring / early summer beer - a bit lighter and thinner than I had expected."
""
""
"Maybe it's because I warmed up with a few Magic Hat #9's, but I found this beer surprisingly good. Good spring pick, and I'd definitely buy it again to share."
""
"I have no idea why I bought a beer called ""Koko"" from Hawaii and didn’t think that it might have coconut in it. I can’t stand coconut. This beer is significantly coconutty. The base beer is sugary, like dimestore chocolate wafers. If you grew up on those wafers (which came in diabetic vanilla, radioactive pink, and kona brewing company chocolate flavors), you can take a trip down memory lane with this beer. I couldn’t finish half the bottle myself."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D- Overall this is a solid beer that I wouldn't mind having another of. The finish and aftertaste aren't excellent but the smell is fantastic and it drinks pretty well."
"Brown in color with a finger of off-white head. The coconut certainly comes through on the aroma. Nice and nutty as well. There's also a hint of vanilla to it. Quite sweet with plenty of toffee and caramel, too. Lots and lots of coconut flavor with the toast, nuts, and sweet malt taking a bit of a back seat on this one. Nice balance of sweetness and toast/roast malt flavors to prevent it from being cloying."
""
"I would have another, if offered."
""
"Taste, maybe the coconut is the lactose like aspect in the mouthfeel. A pretty smooth beer. Consistent throughout, some additional sweetness grows out of the lactose-ishness. Its decent, but at the same time conventional like most brown ales aim to be. I'd like to see a thicker version of this, not necessarily higher alcohol, but bigger, more coconut, vanilla, but stick with the brown malt."
"D - not bad, it is clearly a well made brown ale at heart. The coconut definitely has an effect, though I can't decide if it helps or hurts in the end."
""
""
"what a great beer a little bit of aftertaste but it goes down smoothed this is mr beach beer sitting on the beach drinking this would be heaven i use to drink brown ales but never found one that hitthe spot but oh baby does this hit the spot so find your beach and drink"
""
"Overall I was pretty impressed. I didn’t expect for the flavors to come across as well as they did and the vanilla was definitely a nice surprise. I think they definitely hit the nail on the head going for a “toasted coconut” kind of thing."
""
"I heart coconut, so this brew is right up my alley. Goes well with BBQ Chicken pizza."
""
""
"im almost ashamed to admit it, but this beer tastes great! pours an innocous looking brown ale color, and has the same smell as a basic american brown ale, with that roasty malty sweetness and body, but this has a hint of fresh coconut in the nose, not milky and sweet and artificial, but islandic and raw. flavor is pronounced coconut up front. like drinking the water from one in a tree in south india, or like a mounds bar. touch of cocoa in there too, this feels more drinkable than it should. its not deserty at all, and is lighter than it looks in feel. overall one of kona's best beers that i have had. very unique and very memorable. definitely buy this if you like coconuts"
"D: pretty unique brown here. flavor is distinctively coconut filled as well as loads of vanilla notes. not sure how many of these i could drink, however, one is just fine with me."
"O- Although not one of my favorites, I definitely enjoyed this beer. It had the typical brown ale taste and smell, but the sweet coconut flavor mixed in well and was not too over powering. Would definitely drink again."
""
""
""
"Appearance is brown with 1/2 finger of white head. Its`nose most certainly contains coconut, along with malts and sugar. Koko Brown tastes of nuts, a good amount of coconut and more malts. It is a flavor that is not too overpowering in any aspect and the mouthfeel is medium with a crisp finish. A good beer, which is worth picking up."
"Medium bodied with a nice brown ale medium effervescence. A touch of dryness in the quite watery finish. A solid, if only middle of the pack, brown. They've done better but could do far worse."
"Overall: Indeed, it is a brown ale flavored with coconut. If any part of that statement gives you pause, then this isn't for you."
""
""
""
""
""
"A fun beer, if you don't like coconut don't try it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"M&O: The mouthfeel is not too heavy, more of a medium light body. The sweetness in it is light making it drinkable and easygoing. Not a terribly complex beer. The coconut is so predominant that it makes this just a simple beer that you can easily drink without much thought."
"Overall - This is a great spring beer. It just might be my favorite Kona offering. This and pipeline are neck and neck. Why Kona doesn't offer both these beers year-round is beyond me, because they are by far Kona's best two beers."
""
"The flavor profile is equally subtle. It's a soft brown ale, dominated by roasted (nearly burnt) malts with just a small influence of coconut and nut flavors. I let the brew come closer to room temperature to see if I get a little more, but I'm unfortunately disappointed. Actually as the Koko Brown comes up to temperature, it's becoming somewhat less drinkable. Sorry, but I'm not excited about this one."
"Overall? Ehhh... Not a fan, tastes like a bland brown ale with lots of non beer flavors added. Not a terrible beer, but I wont be buying this one again,"
"Drinkability- Pretty good. I would drink it again. Definitely has a lot of coconut."
""
"- This is a tasty hit of a beer, and one I am sure to buy again. It's taste is its best trait, and it is very balanced and good. I was expecting a mediocre brown like so many, but was pleasantly surprised with the light sweet coconut flavors, and the perfect use of hops in this beer. Go try it!"
"Overall, not bad. I cannot see sessioning this, probably 2 would be my limit. But for a gimmick brew, they did this right. No real overkill. Interesting burps!!!"
"O: Not a bad little flavored brown ale."
"Reviewed on: 03-16-2011 01:24:06"
"Not as sweet as I thought it would be, which is a good thing in this case because the coconut (along with the malts) gives off plenty of sweet impressions. Id say the coconut is just as apparent in this as the Maui CoCoNut Porter. I think I actually like this one more, not to mention it is a dollar cheaper and you get 50% more! Very easy to drink, nice and smooth. I wouldnt mind a silkier, richer mouthfeel...but other than that I am pleasantly surprised by this beer. I foresee a few more six-pack purchases in my future."
""
"O: I think it is worth trying if you have never had a coconut beer but this type of beer is not my style."
"O - Overall an easy drinker and people who like coconut most likely would enjoy it. I'd say it's worth trying, but not seeking out."

"O: Interesting aroma and acceptable flavor. The mouthfeel should be heavier though to match the toasted sweet coconut and smoke. On the other hand, this is a brewery in Hawaii; I doubt a heavy beer would go well there."

"Typical mouthfeel, about like a Newcastle."
"O- I like its, its not great, but I like it. I'd recommend it. Nothing to really flip over but its tasty and well done! Prost!"
"This is a medium to light bodied beer and was a little to shallow for my taste. It is very drinkable, but I probably won't buy it again."
"Pours a fairly clear brown color with a decent head. Aroma is sweet malts, grains, and coconut. The taste is a nice mix of coconut and sweet malts. The malts really start to take over on the finish. The mouthfeel is smooth with a medium level of carbonation, and the drinkabilty is good. Overall, a solid brown ale with just a bit of a twist."
"Overall a wonderful beer for someone who loves coconut."
"Quite an interesting take on a brown ale. Aloha Koko Brown."
"O – I liked this beer but I love all things coconut. I think it’s a fairly average brown but the coconut is my cup of tea. If you are not a coconut fan its not for you. I will take it anyday."

"A short-lived whitish cap topped the coppery brown beer. Nice clarity, a bit of lacing. Roasted, toasted aroma with coconut and floral character, some coffee. Similar flavour profile, with malt sweetness more prominent than bitterness. Lots of toast, coconut and roast, some nuttiness mid-palate. Lingering floral bitterness. Medium bodied and on the dry side, moderate carbonation, but thinned out a little in the finish. Decent overall, as long as you don't mind coconut."

"Overall a very easty drinking, tasty beer."

"Pours an amber color with a 1 inch foamy tan head that settles to a thin film. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, nuts, and some coconut aromas. Taste is of toasted malt, nuts, slight vanilla, and toasted coconut. A mild bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a pretty good mouthfeel with a crisp carbonation level. Overall, this is a pretty good brown ale that the coconut works with but I have had better coconut beers before."

"This was my last beer on my vacation. I was sad to be heading back to Missouri. My wife and I had these at the Kona Grill in the Honolulu airport."
"Overall, interesting with lots of coconut but it's too one-dimensional and way too sweet."
"D-Overall i was quite pleased with this.. it felt thin at times but over all i thought all the flavors came out nicely and was balanced well"
"Not the greatest Brown Ale but pretty tasty. I could see myself getting it again if I sw it around town. Lighter and easy to drink."
"Coconut in beer? Where else would we expect this but from a Hawaiian brewer ... subtle extreme beer as well! Quick-forming head drops down almost as quickly to a thin lacing. Brown and clear. A bit of coconut and dark chocolate, a bit of a candy bar nose here. Body stands a little thin, and coconut flavor is quite prevalent. Maltiness does not really come forward—a quick smattering of toasted and very faint roasted malt. Balancing hoppiness does just that. Coconut flavor fades quick and a drink of toasted graininess is all that’s left. Not much to this Brown Ale other than the element of coconut, which perhaps saves this beer from being entirely pedestrian."
"The difference between this and Maui Coconut Porter is that the latter integrates the beer part well with the coconut. With the former, the coconut dominates. If you're looking a sweet brown ale, then this is your beach. If you hate coconut, then you better think twice."
"I've boughten this one a few times, and usually enjoy it. I've given it to some friends who typically all enjoyed it except for those who did not like coconut. It is very sweet, and crisp with the coconut. I do not recomend drinking a whole bunch of these but the first one is great but the sweetness can become too much after drinking more then a couple. Great for a celebration, something new and sweet."
"Final Notes: A rather interesting experiment by Kona, but it paid off. This Brown Ale is both interesting and unique, and tastes great. The coconut adds a little something special, I think, and would serve to make it a great semi-sweet beer to pair with some dessert. I dig it."
"I can see how anyone not a fan of sweet would find this immediately cloying and too much to handle. I think that while the novel ingredient is quite artificial it works for this style. If you are into the novel ingredient or sweeter beers this is well worth seeking out."
"T:"
"Overallan ok beer. Would get it again but no need to seek it out if you can't get it."
"Poured into a pint glass, malty brown beer, small head dies down to nothing. Aroma of vanilla, caramel, and just sweet overall. Had a pleasing taste of nutty malts and a rich sweet coconut milk flavor that was very strong. Suggestions of brown sugar and toasted coconut. Almost cloying but a nice change of pace. Mouthfeel was medium bodied, and overall, a well brewed beer."
"A great looking chestnut brown with a beige foamy head. The scent of toasted coconut really comes through and there is a slight boozyness in the background. There is alot of cocnut here, maybe more than I would like. Its a bit sweet but there is enough other stuff going on to keep you interested. It has a light body and retained a fair amount of chunky lacing. This is a good picnic beer or a beer for those that dont like beer? An interesting brew and one that should be tried, especially for desert with maybe some fried bananas and vanilla ice cream."
"O: Overall one of the best beers I've had since Samuel Adams Noble Pils. This has become one of my new favorite beers. Reminds me a bit of Quilter's Irish Death. If you see this one, definitely give it a try!"
"OK, got duped by the bottle. Guys tricked me into buying a sixer beacuse from what I thought, i was getting a nice brown ale with a hint of coconut wafting in from the Hawaii shores...not so much. Way to much coconut on this, completely over-powers the beer, but then again, that is good, because as the coconut fades, the cardboardy beer comes through. I was hoping for something else, oh well..this will get a ton of sales from soccer-moms in the mid-west that just got back from a family hawaiian trip however, so they get the last laugh."
"Give it a try. You will enjoy..."
"I had a seven ounce pour of this as a part of a sampler at Pour 24 in Las Vegas' New York New York Hotel. Overall this beer was way too coconut-y in both aroma and flavor and I couldn't get past it to the beer. The color was nice and as a brown should be but everything else was coconut. I'm not a big fan of any fruit flavor in my beer so i had trouble reviewing it for anything else."
"Pours a clear brown-copper with a large off-white head. The aroma is coconut oil/suntan lotion and ocean. My first few whiffs took me to the beach in Hawaii! The taste is all toasted coconut. A lovely little coconut beer as a diversion - not sure I'd want more than one or two."
"Huge dirty brown head explodes out of the glass. Pretty dark beer here, beautiful dark amber/orange color. Great head retention and nice lacing being left already. Strong smells, like Somoan cookies; cookie-like malt bill, creamy and sweet coconut, some coffe. A seriously sweet smelling beer, almost a bit too much on the sugary side. Still, nice combo with the brown ale and coconut. Taste is less sweet, mercifully. Basically, it's a worthy brown ale with a slab of coconut on it. Unique tastes, definite hops note in there. Lots of mellow toasted maltiness, some hazelnut flavors in there, too. Brown ale can be a really under-utilized style of beer. Hats off to Kona for stepping up and doing something a little different. Flavors do seem to fade rather quickly, leaving a watery kind of finish with a nutty/metal lingering. Feel is pretty so-so, would like to see a bit more to this beer than what it has. A more robust body would make this beer really stand out."
"Overall: The body of the beer is medium and the finish is medium. I really like the flavors in this beer especially the coconut hint. Good beer overall."
"all in all, I'm kind of surprised by this one. I'm a big coconut fan, and I like the taste of coconut juice/water a lot, which this brew reminds me of. The toasted notes are significant in that it doesn't just taste like mediocre coconut flavoring. That being said, the underlying brown ale is relatively flacid and lackluster. Although when on sale for $6 a six pack, I could see myself picking this one up again."
"D - Yum. Different, but I could session it!"
"Overall surprising and extremely unique. definitely worth trying, maybe only worth trying again if you really like a sweet, nutty beer."
"O: I think Kona really achieved what they were going for with this one, the coconut flavor and aroma are both quite bold but don't completely overpower the beer, tasty stuff."
"picked this one up for my wife a month or so ago at merchant of vino in Tamarac Square in Denver, got tired of waiting for her to drink it, so I opened it up tonight. Poured a medium to dark brown with a nice little white head. Aromas of toasted coconut, nuts and milk chocolate (almost like an alomond joy at times). Medium bodied, with more almond joy-like flavors, milk chocolate and shredded coconut. Surprisingly pretty good."
"An interesting beer, especially when compared to the Maui Brewing Companys coconut porter. First with appearance nothing too out of the ordinary here. Brown, little darker in color, creamy but thinner head, not the greatest retention but thats no deal breaker to me. Has a very strong coconut and vanilla cream smell to it. I know this sounds weird but the smell is almost like a flavored coffee creamer. I have mixed thoughts on the taste. I preferred it better cooler than warm. When it was cooler it had more of a malty brown ale taste with some subtle coconut. The warmer it got it quickly became a very sweet, coconut creamy mess I thought. It was a little too much warmer. Mouthfeel I found to be a little watery, even for a brown. Overall not a great beer but not terrible. Glad I tried it but dont know if I'd necessarily seek this out again."
"Overall: I didn't know what to expect from this beer, but enjoyed the novelty. It's not a ""big"" beer like Maui's coconut porter, but I don't think it's really trying to be. It's a decent enough session beer, and if you like toasted coconut, I'm willing to bet you crack another one open as that coconut finish lingers well after your last sip. But it's not stellar."
"Overall: All together, try it, you might like it. But if you want a brown ale, look elsewhere."
"Surprisingly crispy taste for a brown ale. Coconut is apparent, along with malty goodness. A very refreshing beer. Nothing spectacular. Pleasant."
"not my cup of tea, but not terrible."
"D - Not bad. The flavor is exotic, but it feels less substantive than I would want. I'd have again if offered, but I don't think I'd buy it."
"Thankfully, I bought this beer as a single. Certainly glad to have tried it but it lacks the complexity I'd like to see from the style. coconut adds a decent touch. Something makes me think it'd taste a hell of a lot better were I relaxing on a beach in Maui..."
"mouthfeel is a little too dry actually, and I like don't like sweet beers. Drinkability is pretty high, but overall preference for this beer is low. I won't be buying this again, but I still look forward to Pipeline Season again!"
"Verdict: Worth the price, and that's to say it's cheap."
"Overall I really was surprised by this one. I originally bought this six pack to have one and send the rest out as extras. I might end up sending one (maybe two) out the rest is for me and my tasting friend Joss."
"One of the sweeter brown ales I've had, but it's not a massive bash-you-over-the-head sweetness, which makes it more drinkable than some. Not a standard brown ale, but it will do, especially when being sold for $2 per pint."
"Pours a very translucent brown with thin head. Nose is light with some brown sugary baked goods. Palate offers the expected toasted coconut, thin watery body, and some brown sugar notes too. Easily drinkable with the watery aspect. Could use more body for sure. Toasted coconut flavors are nice though."
"Overall, a new twist on a brown ale for me, and very Hawaii. I did like it, and would not turn down another."
"Drink- I liked it. Was different but not over done, had good character and was pretty balanced. Probably won't have again unless I am in Kona."
"Drinkability - Great, interesting taste. But a little too strange and adulterated to be a session beer. Seems like it would be a good mood beer, or for an esoteric food pairing where the food is chosen first and the beer has to fit."
"The palate presents more of the same: toasted malt, coconut and brown sugar in equal portions. It's fairly thin, simplistic and sweet. There's some slightly astringent graininess in the finish along with more brown sugar sweetness. A clean and fairly drinkable beer, but not particularly good."
"12 oz from a 6-pack from ""Habits"" S.Salem. $6.99 Appearance? Nice enough looking brown ale. Burnt amber/brown coloured beer with a nice thick light tan head. Aroma is subdued but the coconut is evident alongside whiffs of chocolate,nuts and caramel. Taste is definatlly tasted coconut..with sweet caramel malts and chocolate. Palate is OK and quite thick and pleasing for the style. Overall a nice pleasing beer. Funny thing with the toasted coconut and chocolate this reminded me of Lee's Macaroon Bars back in Scotland as a kid!"
"D: Good beer. surprised by this offering from Kona. Glad they took an apparently unique approach to an up and coming category (coconut) of beer. I like it."
"D: Probably won't try this one again. Not a bad beer by any means. I don't really like fruity beers. But since this one is a nice brown ale, i'll let it slide."
"Appearance has a ruby brown color with a off white minimal head and lace. Smell has a dominant sweet roasted coconut aroma with some grain in the back. Taste, again of sweet roasted coconut, grain with a good hop balance. Mouthfeel is medium with good carbonation. My first brown ale with coconut is very enjoyable,"
"Drinkability is lacking a little. This is a very solid interesting take on the style, but I'm not sure that I'm reaching for another one in the same sitting. Maybe if I had a fireplace by my side."
"This is a very drinkable beer, works well in summer months, as I drink this in March i will note that I need to try this in the summer as it definetely will fill the void of a dark ale that holds up well to drink in summer heat. I reccommend this beer."
"It is a drinkable brown ale but the coconut does nothing for the brew. It's drinkable but there are much better brown ales available."
"I'm a big coconut fan, so this brew was high on my to-try list. It was tasty and easy-drinking with a nice coconut character that wasn't too sweet, but overall the experience was a little one-dimensional. Maui's CoCoNut Porter will remain my go-to."
"Mouthfeel is medium with a smooth, light amount of carbonation."
"D: Overall this is a very enjoyable beer. It's a unique twist on the typical brown ale with the addition of the coconut. If you're looking for a typical brown, look elsewhere, but if you're looking for something new and unique, give this a shot. I'd definitely buy this again."
"Koko Brown is an excellent nut brown ale with a creamy coconut finish. I have had it both on tap and out of the bottle and it is much better on draft. For how sweet the finish is I found it to be a rather sessionable beer. Like the new addition to the Aloha Series!"
"D: An interesting beer, I think the coconut works well here; I'm dropping the drinkability down a bit because its so unique, not really something I'd want more than one of at once. But it's well worth a try unless you're Angelica Pickles."
"As someone who will eat an entire coconut raw in minutes milk included, perhaps I set the standard too high. From what I remember though, Pipeline Porter doesn't bash you over the head with aggrandized ""coffee"" flavor, which is entirely the problem here. Ease off on the sweetness, let the malts take center stage, and retune the coconut and we'd have a desirable brown ale. As of now, it's a no go. Sorry."
"This is OK but no repeat sale here, pretty much an average at best beer."
"3/3.5/3.5/3/3"
"D: Apart from the under-carbonation noted above, I love the coconut taste (as I do in most coconut beers...and coconut in general). Wouldn't be too hard to sling back a 6er."
