"Pours a very deep mahogany in color with a thin beige head. A decent amount of lacing is seen when sipped. The aroma is of malts and burnt brown sugar. Bit more going on with the taste as there is a hint of maple and cocoa also. Very smooth and goes down easy. No bitter or harsh aftertaste. Medium-bodied though a bit thin. Lower carbonation. Overall a tasty brown ale."

""
""
"Very big toasted barley/malt in the nose and taste. A hint of maple and cocoa. It's allright"
""
""
"Overall:  This is a pretty damn good nut brown.  Nice flavors of malt, mixed well with the maple syrup flavors.  Toasty."

"Great beer especially on tap in a pinball bar in Idaho Springs Colorado."

"The better of the beers I have had from this brewery but still just above average."

"This is Tommyknocker's most popular beer, and it's pretty good.  I'm not a huge fan of browns, but the maple flavor gives it a nice balance.  Great to have in their sampler pack so you can try a bunch of different styles."

"A decent enough ale. The maple sugar makes its appearance after a few lingering sips and makes for a nice touch, flavor-wise. The body seems a bit weak at times and the aroma very low-key, yet the malty flavors ultimately prevail."

"Good nut brown color with thin light tan collar, decent lacing. Aroma is maple sweetness, and a nutty-caramel aroma as well. Taste is also nutty, caramel with the maple taking a big presence. Thin body for a brown and low carbonation. Needs a better malt backbone and maybe some more hops both up front and at the end."
""
""
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was a nice amber color. and poured a nice tan head. I was afraid of this one after tasting their imperial nut Brown which I did not like. This I must say is much better in my opinion and actually you can taste the beer and not the high ABV of the imperial. The beer had a nice maple taste and was really good. I will buy this one again."

"Respect to Idaho Springs for this mountain town brown. It does the job of being flavorful and drinkable. Give this to a Newcastle Brown Ale lover."
""
"This is a clear, chestnut brown beer. The head is fizzy and a bit thin. Nice malty, nutty scent. I didn't get much maple in the aroma, but there is a pleasant toast smell. A bit more maple comes out in the flavor. Semi sweet and malty. Medium in body. This is a better than average, enjoyable brew."

"Pours out to a thin buff head that makes an honest attempt to lace the glass. Clear brown color. Aroma is...maple with a hint of nuts and malt. Flavor is nutty, malty and slightly sweet with a crisp finish. light mouthfeel, not syrupy at all. Overall good quaff."
"This is a wonderful session beer that you could gulp over and over again. The maple sweetness blends beautifully with the nutty flavor and is wonderfully drinkable. Pairs great with breakfast food or after a day of skiing or snowshoeing or around a campfire."
"O - This beer will go Great with breakfast. Buy a couple for next weekend's bacon and eggs."
""
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Light bubbly head, slight lacing. Nose is malty and sweet. Malt grains, sweetened with what seems like a little too much maple. Overall, this is an okay quaff."
""
""
"O - Solid brown ale, I was expecting a bit more maple."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - this is actually probably decent for the style, but I'm not a fan of the style, so I'm a bad judge."

"True to style. Good head that dissipates quickly. Bubbles look uniform but lay a nice Brussels lace. The maple is subdued; not artificial tasting; subtle. Has kind of an earthy / meaty aroma and mouthful I wasn't expecting but like. A bit sweet as expected, but not heavy. Tastes more complex as it warms. Very easy drinking - I think I'll have another."
""
"Overall, decent, but there are other browns that I'd prefer over this."

"Overall, a good session beer for those who like their brown ales a tad on the sweet side."

"O: I cannot say that this is a special beer, but is enjoyable. Brown beers have never been a favorite, but this one stands out in that respect."
""
"Overall: Methinks Tommyknocker took things a bit too far with this one. A smaller dose of maple could have made this interesting enough, and more hops and less chocolate may have helped to highlight the star flavor by adding more juxtaposition. A fuller mouthfeel was definitely called for in my opinion, especially considering the style guidelines surrounding this beer."
""
""
""
"Good aroma, with a decent head. Sweet maple notes on the nose with a slight malt scent. The flavor was sweet but not too much, but the malt and hops were almost hidden. A little bit of a nutty flavor from the malt along with the maple flavor. A good nut ale. The mouth feel was light and the beer itself didn't weigh me down like some nut ales do, is a good summer nut ale."

"Not bad, I was hoping for something with a little more punch and creativity from the sound of it, and this was very subdued. But it's pretty good overall, and definitely better than the low average score I'm seeing on here I think, personally."

"Surprised by this beer, to be honest. It's not FANTASTIC, but it's a solid beer from a brewery I hadn't heard of before buying the bottle. It's a slightly above average nut brown ale with some characteristics of maple syrup. If that's your bag, definitely try it out. And considering I'm having this beer a month past its drink-by date, it could only (at least) be slightly better fresh. At a measly 20 IBUs, this could be a great beer for somebody that doesn't like to drink anything other than Bud Light because they think it all just tastes ""bitter."""

"Revisiting some Tommyknocker brown-ness now that they've apparently infiltrated the Chicagoland market. This one pours a clear sunrise garnet topped by a finger of relatively short-lived glowing off-white foam. The nose comprises toasted caramel, light cashew (a hallmark of Tommyknocker, it seems), and a pinch of chocolate powder. Things are restrained, as though they don't really wanna be here, but their parents made them. It's character-building, of course. The taste brings in more of the same, along with some maple syrup, some vague and mild fruit tones pervading the background, and an even vaguer sense of mixed greens throughout. This would usually be a decent enough combination, but here the flavors don't meld well, they bicker and argue over who's gonna kill who, with nothing ever getting done in the end, much less anything truly tasty. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a wetly fluid feel. Overall, an okay brown, but the flavors just don't work together, and things run a bit too thinly for their own good."

"The TK maple nut brown ale is a decent brown ale and I would recommend it. The beer pours a deep brown with a slightly off white head that did not leave much lacing. The scent carried sweet caramel malt and hints of maple. The taste was a very nicely balance ale that was not overly sweet. The mouthfeel was medium to light body with smooth carbonation. Overall I thought it was a decent brown ale."

"Overall, I'm not a big fan.... Not what I was expecting."
"O: The taste redeems it to a certain degree but a good beer has more than one element. The mouthfeel almost messes up the taste because if how thin it is. If they could just beer this thing up from 4.5% and add a little oomph to the body, do something for the aroma, this thing would be awesome."

"This was an easy drinking beer and the maple was not overpowering which helped me enjoy it more."
"Overall / Drinkability: A very tasty beer and very sessionable to boot. I could easily have another by itself but I find with food the beer really works. I've had it with Burgers and it was fantastic, and with pulled pork BBQ it works well again. Not a perfect combination with the BBQ, but still good. Definitely glad I got the 6 pack of this when I saw it. A bit disappointing in the aroma dept, but still quite good overall."
"Overall - I've never had another ale like this one.. It's great."

"Overall - not extremely intriguing, but not dull either, and still very good-tasting."

"I poured this beer into a pint glass. It has a nice dark, rich brown body with a small beige head that doesn't stay up to long. The smell is rich of maple notes and brown sugar and roaste malt. The taste is rich of toasty malt with a nice flavor of maple syrup not a lot of spice though. The mouth feel is really smooth and doesn't leave a after taste. Overall this is a really good bronw ale"
"Overall- No more or less than you'd expect from the name. Maple is evident and adds a bit of complexity to an otherwise pretty standard brown ale."
""
""
"O) Really pretty tasty... I would not turn this one down. In fact, I think it's my favorite Tommyknocker brew to date. Glad to recommend this beer."
""
""
""
"O: A good rendition on a nut brown ale."
""
""
"O) An alright brown ale. The ""maple"" is not very pronounced, if at all. I'd drink another one but not a brew I'd keep coming back to."
"overall as a brown ale, it's kind of a bland looking ale with a watered down mouthfeel.. but honestly this is the best tasting brown ale i've ever had. nutty, syrupy.. it is perfect in that aspect (definitely 100% what the name of the beer suggested). when it comes down to it, i feel that the biggest aspect is taste and smell, and it does win you over in that sense."

"Nice. Mostly sweet, but very drinkable. Not exciting, but it does the trick."
"O: Its a surprising beer. Its a brown ale but it has very light flavors, it has a nice sweetness that is subtle but you know its there. not a lot of backbone to this beer. Very drinkable at 4.5% abv. Not one of my favorites but its pretty good."

"Maple flavor comes through in the sweet malt. Has nutty earth brown ale middle, finishes dry with an herbal punch that leads towards phenol as it warms. A decent brown ale but nothing special."
"Pours out a brown color with reddish fringes and a brief single finger head, no lacing. The nose is lightly toasted bread and nuts, but doesn't exhibit as strong an aroma of maple syrup as I had hoped for. However, the flavor does indeed start out with a light amount of the maple syrup sweetness that was not detected on the nose and progresses through stages of murky nutty and toasted malt, but overall the flavors are ill-defined and not quite as well amplified as the imperial version of this brew is. Body is on the thinner side of medium and carbonation is just a tad sluggish for my tastes. Overall you can really tell that this is better passed up for the much better imperial version of the same thing. It's the same idea, amplified up to levels that actually work well."
"D - Light and easy; nice maple syrup/nut brown all combination, would recommend to other who like really sweet stuff"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Brew pours a clear mahogany under a fairly persistent head. A sweet and crisp aroma of toasted biscuity malt yields notes of milk sweetness, light cocoa, maple and roasted nut. Letting this warm to a cool temperature from the fridge before drinking truly accentuates the flavors and mouth feel that I'd hoped for in what the bottle proclaims. I think I'll give this another go...with a loaded bacon cheese burger."
"D/O: The maple syrup appears to have been added after fermentation; such is the only explanation for this beer's monotone sweetness. This flavor quality surprises the palate upon first encounter and quickly becomes repetitive and uninteresting. It is a clumsy beer that would probably be better off without the sugar adjuct. There are hints of real brown ale scattered about, but unfortunately they are scattered widely."
"Pretty good. Would work fine to wash down or help maranaide some BBQ."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Disappointing. Compare this to Peak Organic's The Maple Collaboration and you'd think that it's probably what would come out if they bottled the water they use to wash the mash tuns! Well, it's maybe not as bad as all that, but certainly not very impressive. I won't drink this again."
""
"O: The use of maple syrup as an ingredient is quite interesting because it was done in a subtle way and doesn’t prominently stand out in the smell or taste."

"Overall this is a great nut brown ale. Easily drinkable, and some good maple flavors. The only glaring flaw is the tart bitterness that comes at the end of the taste, either from the hops or from the fermented syrup itself (which I've seen with other beers including my homebrew.)"
""
"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best by 4/2/2012. Pours slightly hazy reddish brown color with a good 1-2 finger dense off white head with good retention that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Some spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of caramel, toasted malt, biscuit, light chocolate, roasted nut, and maple syrup. Some decent aromas that are on the weak side. Taste of toasted malt, caramel, maple, roasted nut, and a touch of herbal hops. A surprising lack of flavor here, but it isn’t offensive. Really dry finish; but some lingering notes of caramel and maple for a few seconds. Light-medium carbonation and body; with a slightly creamy mouthfeel. Very drinkable as expected, with no alcohol noticed at all as expected for 4.5%. Some good flavor balance for what is present. Overall this is an ok beer. Not offensive by any means, but it really is lacking in the flavor department. I wanted it to be much more robust than what was offered."
"Overall, an enjoyable and easy drinking beer."

"This beer's ok. Quaffable and sessionable."
""
""
"O: Eh. It's an ok beer. I've certainly had better beers in this style. It's almost good, but it's overly sweet and the palate is all over the place with bitter-sweet malts. I'd drink it again, but I wouldn't recommend it for anyone except maybe those who are just starting to explore craft beers. If you get a chance to try one for free, go for it, but don't pay a premium for it if you see it somewhere."
""
"The beer feels fine, and does not really have ""off"" flavors. It just needs flavors. Anything! I would certainly drink it again if they could manage that."
"It really is like drinking a peanut brittle with a maple glaze. Take that as you will"
"Medium bodied with excessive carbonation, this beer may seem a bit light for some. The body is quite refreshing and never becomes sticky. This may be seen as a hindrance to some as the flavors don't really have a chance to cling to the palate. The carbonation is almost explosive as this beer is held in the mouth, which certainly helps the drinkability but definitely gets in the way of the flavors."
"Taste is light, soft, sweet toasted malt. The flavor is very mild (like a brown ale SHOULD be). There is not much of a hop presence and I don't get any maple flavor. The mouthfeel is thin-to-firm. Overall, this is a good brown ale. If you don't like this mild style, steer clear. If you do, you might want to pick up a single of this and try it."
""
""
""
"Overall, I love this brown ale. The low AVB is awesome, and this beer doesn't over-do it like some other brewers ... the maple is just enough to get the point across. A good representation for the style."
""
"Overall - I am sure there are those out there who appreciate this kind of taste. And it isn't a ""bad"" beer necessarily, but the maple was just too over the top for me. Way too sweet, I had to drainpour about the last third. I just couldn't stomach it anymore. I really like Tommyknocker beers, but this one was just a little much."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not a bad buy for a giveaway or for those days you don't feel like drinking ""a lot"". More of like a light ""bock"" beer to me, little sweet slightly bitter but yet easy to drink."

"This is an alright brown ale. The maple syrup is in every aspect of this beer. The flavor and mouthfeel are dominated by the syrupy qualities. When it's all said and done, I probably won't have this one again."
"D: An interesting concept, but a disappointment. Very much a one-note brew and even that was not well done."

"The taste was about the same as any pretty good brown ale. Really sweet sugary taste mixed with a pretty decent amount of hops. I also tasted the maple syrup in it. This went surprisingly well in this, and I am always glad when I can actually taste a unique flavor like this that the bottle basically promises (most don't live up to these promises). Overall, I think this is a pretty good brown ale. I have definitely had better, but that does not take anything away from this one, and I commend them on actually being able to taste the maple flavor they promise."

""
""
"This beer is great to have one every now and then but not have an entire six pack unless you are giving it out to friends."
"ya know what? i liked this one. a very unconventional nut brown. pours a somewhat couldy brown color with an average head. smells like maple, but is it real maple or aunt jemima's? smells almost too sweet to be real maple, but the label says it is. taste is a bit malty and caramel, with a maple sugar essence on the back end. cant complain, its drinkable and enticing with a medium body. the sweetness keeps it from being too sessionable, but its a nice fall beer."
"Overall it's so-so. Nice for a mixed sixer but I wouldn't but a whole six pack of it."
"Sampled from a bottle, best by December 19, 2011. Mahogany in color with a light haze at first but clarified once it warmed a bit. Pretty good clarity for a brown ale. Poured with an aggressive foamy head that quickly dissipated leaving wisps and a foam ring around the glass. Bready and nutty malt aromas with hints of sweet molasses. Molasses aroma intensifies as the beer warms up. On the lighter side of medium bodied, a bit watery, with aggressive tangy carbonation. Earthy malt flavor is dominant throughout with occasional hints of nuts and an underlying sweetness that lingers at the finish. This was very easy to drink and would go very well with spicy foods. Generally this brown ale was pretty simple and unmemorable."
"M: Soft, smooth, and nicely carbonated. Slightly dry, but very refreshing."
"Overall, this is a no frills tasty American brown ale. Gives the consumer every expectation one would expect from a brown ale with out anything offensive. I enjoyed this ale but not sure if it would be a regular for me."
"Overall Drinkability - Pretty decent. No off characters. Very drinkable."
"O - overall, I found this to be a tad too sweet and a little too carboanted. Ok, but I've had much better brown ales."
"O- Enjoyable, especially if you like maple. Certainly sessionable and could easily be an easy-drinking fallback for a hot day."
"Notes: This one is solidly hearty. Cheers."
"O: Overall a bit sweet for my liking, less like a beer and more like a dessert made with holiday liquor. Honey, chocolate sweetness is a bit overkill, probably best in moderation, 6-8oz servings as dessert and not so well as a stand alone drink much less a brown ale."
"Good overall. Tasty. Good brown underneath that makes it a standard but with a little maple kick."
"O - I have to admit I'm not a huge fan of brown ales, but this one is pretty good."
"Low abv, pleasant taste and smell. Not a bad brown ale."
"O - I've had this before but this bottle seems MUCH better than I remember. This is certainly an above average beer from Tommyknocker. Easy recommendation for people like me who love both beer and maple syrup."
"O: I was looking for something a little sweeter or flavorful, but this is just a really nice easy-drinking ale. Paired nicely with pizza."
"I haven't had this one in a hot minute now. The new packaging caught my eye, and I figured I'd give it a whirl again; it is nice, should've done it sooner. The brew pours a lustrous chestnut-mahogany hue, and is topped with a pillowy cap of reddish-tan froth; it is a rich and good looking brew. The nose is mellow, mostly offering sweet roast barley notes, and a bit of maple-y aroma. The flavor is just a bit sweet, and the maple is light (but present); it covers the same territory as the nose. In fact, this tastes a bit like an extremely delicious wort. Hops are present, but very light, adding perhaps a tinge of sweet floral notes. There seems to be a bit of UK ale yeast fruitiness, as well. The brew also sports a nice creamy silky body, and it is pretty much a winner all-around."
"O- I like the idea, but it's essentially an average beer for me."
"Overall, a decent table beer; nothing much to discuss, though"
"Overall: A very pleasant brown ale. Would make a good dessert beer. My wife and I agree: this is more of a fall taste for sipping around the fire."
"o: good beer worth trying."
"Overall: If you like sweet, then this might be for you. It's not that it was a bad beer, just too sweet for my tastes."
"Overall I liked it before and I still do. For what it is a simple maple nut brown ale, it delivers. Glad I have 3 more."
"O: Tommyknocker's Maple Nut Brown Ale is a pretty reasonable stab at an obnoxious idea. I can't say I'll be having this again, but for what it is, it ain't half bad. Worth the tick, nothing more."
"Smoothe on the tongue, with a very clean finish. Lightly carbonated, I would definitely buy this again. Even if you don't normally drink 'darker beers' I would at least try this as the maple cleanness to it makes it feel less heavy and dark than it might otherwise. If, however you are more like me and prefer your beers the consistency of motor oil, this can be a nice refreshing afternoon brew, that can strike a balance between the extremes."
"overall: not a bad beer at all, just some light maple that mingles nicely with the rest of the beer. a touch sweet, but it doesnt detract anything from the beer."
"O: A solid brown ale, adhering to this style's typical characteristics. I was hoping to get a taste of maple syrup, maybe next time; it's still a good/enjoyable brown ale worth trying at least once."
"Overall it was ok. Pretty close to maple syrup I was hoping for but could be closer."
"With all the seemingly tasty malt additions to this recipe, something somehow is lost on the palate. The beer looks wonderful - long-lasting head (from cara-pils, though I suspected wheat) and smatters of lace over a clear, red-brown liquid. Really not much aroma to write home about. Even after 10-15 minutes sitting there, I only got a super-tiny bit of light-toasted nut and definite maple notes. And those elements only barely intensified in the flavor. Wouldn't quite call this watered-down, but both the degree of malt-maple flavors and depth of body were on the threshold between light-moderate. Overall, this beer ain't bad, but it leaves a lot to be desired in taste."
"Overall: Slightly above average. I wouldn't really recommend this beer to anyone, but I WOULD like to try another maple beer, if there exists one."
"Being new to brown ales I had an open mind. This didn't disappoint at all. I purchased a 6 pack sampler and chose this as my first. So far so good. Poured nicely into a short pilsner glass. Had nice aroma but not overwhelming. Nice lacing but disappeared quickly. This was a really smooth feel going down. Nice malty, caramel and slight coffee taste. Was a little sweet in the beginning but seemed to get more sweet as I continued. Didn't really get to a point of maple syrup though. Overall I think this was a nice brown ale experience. Bear in mind I dont have much to compare it too as I've only started breaking into the browns but I was not disappointed. So far I'm all about the brown ales! Definitely give this one a try!"
"Certainly original, and definitely hands over maple syrup as promised, but not something I could ever foresee being in the mood for."
" I enjoy the flavors with some mild nutty/toasted malt flavor and maple taste is there peripherally giving a nice accent with slight sweet but not cloying presence. I light the light dry character here since you expect maple brown as a beer to come off sweeter, the taste is good until it finishes w/ the sweet maple earthy goodness in the end. I find the overall drinkability of this to be good, but tried to be fair according to the style which may not be accurate according to what I got out of this -a nice gentle brown more in the English style with complimentary maple that doesn't go too far too sweet, just a simple brown that hits the spot."
"Overall: I think that is definitely a unique and probably suited best for the winter or for someone who likes really sweet beers. I think this beer accompanied with a Breakfast stout would make a swell meal."
"This is quite sweet, this could be a ""dessert breakfast beer."" It kind of tastes like liquid french toast. Not bad at all. Maple syrup has definitely made its presence know and it works well."
"Ordered a bottle this past weekend while at the new 5 Napkin Burger in the Pru. Poured into a standard pint glass. A caramel colored body. Moderate head retention. Smell was malty and just a hint of woodiness. Flavor left a lot of questions. While it was not offensive, there was nothing to it. If the beer is brewed with maple, then I'd expect something along that line. Nothing really stood out except for the maltiness you get in most brown ales. Overall it was a let down, and not worth the marked up price I paid at this restaurant."
"Overall This was an average brown ale. When I saw the name of this beer I expected some good maple syrup flavor, but that wasn't the case, it didn't show up at all in the flavor. The base of this beer was good expect for being a little watery. If this was just labeled as a nut brown it would score higher, but with maple in its name it just didn't live up to it. I don't think I would buy this beer again, it needs to have more maple syrup added to it and a little thicker bodied. I thought I was going to enjoy this beer but that didn't happen."
"Got a single as a gift, tried it first since I'm not much of a fan of brown ales. Look and smell are pretty underwhelming but the taste is all right. I wouldn't go out and buy a 6er but wouldn't turn it down either."
"One of my favorites from TommyKnocker. It has a super roasted feel that i'm sure any coffee lover would enjoy. As I said a flaw, at least for me, was that the crisp carbonated feel(that of which Winter Warmers have) slowly turn to a heavier bodied syrup like taste. I understand this is a maple beer, but take my word and enjoy this one as fresh as possible. Stay thirsty my friends."
"Smelled sweet not too hoppy, very smooth, almost thought it was a lager, reddish brown, looked like a amber lager, had a hint taste of maple, very easy to drink, but wasnt overall impressed, not something id look for but would drink if I went somewhere and they had it."
"There are better brown ales but this one is solid."
"Overall, Maple Nut Brown is a very good beer. It has an excellent nose & taste that excite the senses. The appearance & mouthfeel could be improved a bit, but for the most part, a nicely done brown ale. Would highly recommend."
"D: A little tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, although there are several others in the style that are better this is still a decent beer to drink for a while."
"Thin yet clingy. I wouldn't rush back."
"Drinkability is good, beer is pretty sessionable. Flavors aren't anything extraordinary and maple wasnt as present as I'd like. Not something I'd keep in my fridge on a regular basis but a good local beer."
"This is a decent beer, drinkable beer that I would definitely enjoy again."
"M- The mouthfeel, again is the only off-putting aspect but the maple syrup lingering is certainly noteworthy and makes this one stick out"
"D: I don't think I would ever get this again. Very boring flavor and kind of bland. If it weren't for the fact I don't care what I'm drinking right now, I would pour it down the drain."
"D- I could drink a six-pack in one sitting only thing I would be wary of is the sweetness of the drink."
"Tommyknocker Maple Nut Brown Ale was mahogany in color with good clarity. It had a short beige head with decent retention and lacing. The smell was sweet malts with some maple syrup. The taste was sweet malt, a bit toasty, light maple syrup flavor, and a little nutty. It finished semi-dry and maple-malty. The mouthfeel was good with a medium body and medium-light carbonation. The drinkability was good. This is a good brown ale worth a try."
"Overall a nice, sessionable brown ale. Nothing spectacular, but well-made. Solid B."
"It pours a light brown color with a slight red. No big smells in the nose of this beer. A little brown sugar and maple syrup. Now maybe I am biased from everything else I drank on this day, but I was very disappointed with the taste. It tasted of a thin nut brown ale and a little bit of maple. It honestly was not drinkable for me at this point in the night. It ended up being a drain pour. I had higher hopes for this beer. It was just to thin and unbalanced. I think I would of enjoyed it a little more if it was all I drank on that day."
"D-well it at least goes down easily. its by no means is a very drinkable beer. it seems to be quite filling. its definitely not a brown ale i'll ever be getting again."
"I almost didn't think this was beer until I signed onto here and saw that alcohol was indeed present in this. It's barely discernible and I could easily have had a few of these in a sitting. This won't win any awards but sometimes, it's nice to just be able to crack a beer open and not have to think to deeply as I work my way down the bottle. This is one of those beers and I look forward to trying the other offerings from Tommyknocker are now for sale here."
"D- a great drinkable brown ale, wish this would replace newcastle as the go to brown on the tap handles at local bars. has a great finish and is pretty darn drinkable great beer to sip on in the middle of a cool winter day. Makes me kind of want a pancake though."
"D: With a light flavor profile and a smooth mouthfeel, the beer was easily drinkable but I fear I can't say it was more than just that. Not exactly what I was expecting when I cracked the bottle (I was expecting flavor to be much fuller) but I give the beer props for being remarkably easy to down."
"Very easy to drink, the sweetness rather restrained and pleasant, but lacking in body and overall robustness. A nice offering that could easily reach the next level with a few tweaks."
"Poured into a pint glass, body looks to have a brown body, but is more of a dark copper color when held to the light. Has a finger of light tan head that fades pretty quick. Pretty much just maple and brown sugar in the nose. Not a whole lot of flavor, but I am picking more hints of the maple as the beer warms, also some roasted malts. Decent level of carbonation, but really thin in the mouth."
"D: Not the most intiguing aesthetically but quite delicious."
"This is a very unique brown ale.. I love the flavors and aromas. With a few changes, this could be one of the best browns out there. The flavors are enough to enjoy this beer, recommended."
"Dr: Not bad at this price range, but better beers can be had in this style."
"D-a good brown ale. goes down pretty smooth and is something that I would definitely have again."
"D: Not impressed. Its better then drinking miller lite, but I wouldn't try anything else from this brewery."
"Drinkability is pretty low, considering that I drain-poured about half of each bottle. It's just too one-dimensional and thin to really devote much time to."
"This was an interesting brew. I appreciate the unique effort put in for the style, but thought it missed for the most part. Overall it seemed too much like it was trying to be both a faithful brown but also something light and drinkable. It's worth a try, and I can see how it might be appealing to some, but I probably won't get this again."
"If you like maple syrup, you'll probably like this. If you don't like maple syrup, don't bother. I love a good brown w/ a twist, so I wasn't disappointed. But if you read the label on this beer and end up hating this beer, maybe you should check your reading skills. =)"
"I was told about Tommyknocker from an individual tha wanted to have it kept in my bar. Needless to say I had to try it out first. I got it in a bottle and it was made in July of this year. It does taste a little flat but it is still pretty tasty. The coor when you pour is medium brown in color, almost sandy. The smell is sweet and desirable. The taste is more a fruity taste than maple. The nutty flavor really stands out to me. This beer is pretty damn goodand easy to drink, almost too easy."
"I poured into a pint glass to a half inch of tan head. It is brown in color with dark amber highlights. The aroma is definitely maple. It has underlying nutty, earthy smells, as well. The taste is sweet maple syrup with some roasted caramel malt. The mouthfeel is a bit thin. I really like this beer but it I don't drink more than a couple due to the sweetness."
"D/M: Great carbonation and crisp while being very drinkable. I would go as far as to say this is versatile enough to be a breakfast beer."
"Good price, 8.50 for six longnecks"
"D: The flatness and lack of carbonation make this one hard to drink at warmer temperatures. However, I do think the flavour is quite good."
"This was a decent brown ale, the taste and scent didn't exactly jump out at you. Not an easy drinker, I found it difficult to finish 2 of these."
"D - One is enough for me for now but I really like the maple taste so I'd try this one again."
"First off, if you don't like the taste of maple syrup, then this beer is just not for you. If you do in fact like maple syrup, then drink up my friends. This beer is a very smooth drink, and I found that i finished a six pack before i even got comfortable in my bar stool. Wonderful maple syrup aroma and just the right amount of syrup added to still taste like a beer. One of my personal favorites. A must drink for Maple Syrup fans everywhere. I also find that you may need to swirl the bottle for the best taste as the syrup tends to settle at the bottom. A delight from the Tommyknocker collection."
"The maple flavor in this is excellent. Nicely done. Must try if you like maple syrup. This taste exactly like pure, organic maple syrup."
"Appears a dark amber brown hue with a thin khaki tan head forming with minimal speckled lacing. Aroma, deep sweet fruit and maple syrup notes there's not much brown ale characteristic in the smell of this brew. Fuckin' disgusting maple syrup cloyingly sweet flavor with nothing else going on this is by far one of the worst beers I've come across on the planet, it makes my gag reflux kick with instant acid reflux. This beer is terrible thn bodied artificial carbonation these people should throwin the towel and be forced to chug Canadian Breakfast Stout bombers rom Founders, as far as being drinkable that's an absolute no. Drain pour, is the only justable end to this beer as far as drinkability goes are you fuckin' kidding me."
"D - This is easily one of the best Maple Nut Brown's I've had the pleasure of trying. Excellent offering, and highly recommended to anyone looking for a sweet, tasty maple based beer that won't overload the taste buds."
"There is too much flavor for a macro drinker and just bad for everyone else. I find maple a bit off in many beers but they normally have other things there and it can work darn well. This beer just doesn't do it for me."
"It went down a treat and I thionk I will actively seek this out again."
"Cheers!"
"Taste imported more sweetness, but not to a large or disagreeable level. Smoothness contributed to by the maple I'm sure. Quite enjoyable even to a hophead. Exceeded expectations for sure. Mouthfeel became smoother as it went on."
"Dark reddish orange colour; slightly hazy. Little head. Doesn't look particularly impressive. Smell is lightly roasted malts and maple syrup. Taste is sweet malts and definite syrup. Sweet, but not offensively so, in my opinion. This is actually better than I thought it would be. Light(er) and flavourful at the same time. Pleasantly carbonated. A decent offering from a brewery I generally don't care for."
"I reviewed the bigger, imperial, brother of this ale some time back and found it lackluster. It seems the bigger brew loses some of maple sweetness in favor of alcohol."
"Drinkability: Definitely has drinkability. This beer not only tastes good but goes down easy as well."
"beer is mildly disappointing. Price point on this beer demands (for me at least) that their beers have a bigger wow factor."
"Overall, this is a present beer to drink. Complex, yet subtle, I would love to revisit this one as my pallet matures. Still, I haven't met a brown ale that can surpass Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale, but none the less this is a worthy brew."
"D - Good to take with yellow cheese and salads."
"D: Pretty easy to drink. a very unique flavor. the nutty chocolate malt flavor was very strong, and was good. i would have another, but only once in a while."
"The sweet parade continues on the palate as maple syrup, honey and chocolate lead the way with nothing to impede their path. No hops. No yeast. No alcohol. Cloying? Probably. Drinkable? Yes, depending on you mood. I much prefer the imperial version, but this one is plenty interesting in it's own right. Try it when the sweet tooth needs some satisfaction."
"Overall, It went down ok, and it was fairly enjoyable, from a novelty standpoint. I've had far worse browns, and would have this again."
"This beer is a tad light, with not a lot of body. There is a strong maple flavor and that toffee keeps coming through. The brown malts are not assertive so it is a fairly weak beer with some nutty flavors underneath, a touch of spice, a bit drying in the finish to balance out the sweetness. The beer is okay, it's enjoyable, it's light, but it isn't brilliant."
"Pours a thick bodied dark opaque brown. Looks kind of like maple syrup. Thats what they call foreshadowing. Smells like Mrs. Butterworth's. There are some other nutty malty smells bubbling up in the background, but sticky-sweet atificial maple syrup taste and smell overwhelms everything else. I couldn't swallow the first sip. Some sweet mapley nutty flavors are expected in a nut brown ale, but not like this. It's so disgustingly sweet and artificial, I'm not even sure if I'm drinking beer. I swear it is brewed with high fructose corn syrup. I managed to get down about half the bottle but no more. The thick sweet body makes this undrinkable. Avoid."
"D - could kick back with a few of these. nothing outstanding, but fair from paltry."
"It's not a bad beer, but it wouldn't be my first choice. Probably not even my fourth choice, depending on circumstances."
"drinkability - session beer yes - my kinda of session beer no"
"D: A very easy drink and a good session brew, overall a good nut brown."
"This beer poured a deep brown in color and has a nutty scent. Beer is a little on the sweet side with a great maply syrup flavor. Mouthfeel is average. I gave this a 3.5 on the drinkability because of it's sweetness and I think it would be hard to pair with a food, but is a great beer all by its self. I would recommend this beer to anyone."
"[Drinkability]: Drinkability is pretty good."
"D - Good, I finished this in about 5 minutes. Wouldn't buy it though. 3.5"
"Truly an average beer. Poured with no head. Was brown, and slightly hazy. Mild maple taste on top of a normal nut brown flavor. Even as the beer warmed up, the flavors remained truly average. This would be a good beer to drink when you want to feel absolutely mediocre."
"All and all...not bad."
"Dark mahogany brown bodied, very small tan head takes off quickly. Very rich malt scent, caramels and maple with hints of chocolate. Nut brown flavors dominate the taste. The maple is blended in pretty well and only becomes apparent as it goes down. Im not a major brown ale guy, but this one's pretty tasty. Pretty wet mouth. Not a bad beer."
"drinkability: not bad, suprised. Proably woudnlt buy since sweet browns are not my thing, but decent"
"NOTE: When this beer is really fresh, the maple notes are much stronger and I find the beer to be less sweet, too. If you ever get a chance to try it in Idaho Springs, I recommend it. I'd say it's actually quite a bit better, but I haven't had a bottled version that effectively duplicates that. It's still no world beater, but it is pretty tasty."
"Thanks to Jdostal for the sample... Poured into a pint glass this brew has a hazy brown/amber color with a 1 finger milk chocolate head that settled into a slight cap with decent lacing on the glass. The aroma is full of nutty goodness, some light chocolate and maybe some burnt caramel. The taste is heavy on the roasted malts and nice nutty flavor. There is also a great hop balance to this brew. I am not getting the sweet maple taste that is advertised, but this is still a very good brew."
"D: Not terribly complex, but not bad."
"D - though never really a fan of Nut Browns, this one got a slight bonus for the uniqueness of the Cracker Jack taste...actually took me back a bit. outside of that, its pretty average all around."
"Good full mouthfeel to go with the sweetness of this beer. This is an easy beer to drink down. It would be easy to drink down several pints. Pretty nice"
"D - This is a fairly drinkable brew, maybe a tad sweet for my liking but the low ABV certainly makes it sessionable if you don't mind a sweet malty brew. It went down pretty quickly as I reviewed it. I'm glad I tried it, but I probably won't go out of my way to buy it."
" ~ This beer is a bit too nutty for me. I appreciate the interesting combination of flavors but this isn't something I'll likely try again."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a dark brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of nuts and maple. Taste is good, nuts, maple, a tad sweet, very flavorful. Feels creamy in the mouth and has decent drinkability. Overall this is a quality beer worth checking out."
"A solid beer overall."
"Overall - A new favourite"
"D: This one is decent for having a few of but the bitterness seems to be a bit off balance. It is not hugely noticeable though."
"D: Amazing if you like nuts."
"Not really a beer I would look forward too trying again."
"D- Very easy drinking although it's feels a little thin and isn't the most complex beer. A pretty solid everyday beer though"
"Medium body, well carbonated, this has a real smooth mouthfeel. Definitely drinkable at 4.5%. There's nothing spectacular about this beer but it's pleasing in all aspects."
"I could put back a sixer of these on an evening. Browns are a nice and easy to drink beer year round and this fits the bill. The maple adds a bit of character to it. Nicely done."
"Value: Bought individually for $2 a pop. Next time I'll go with the six pack."
"Poured dark brown into an American pint glass, with less than a finger of tan head and spotty lacing. The smell was dominated by nuttiness, along with some roasted malt and chocolate; not much of a hint of maple in the smell. Not much of maple syrup flavor in the taste either, which was a nice blend of nuts, chocolate, and maltiness, but finishing on a super-sweet note. However, maple syrup texture certainly surfaced in the thick, syrupy mouthfeel. A nice sipping beer (maybe with dessert), but not a session brew for me."
"All in all a good job."
"Pours an amber/copper color with a moderate head that fades pretty quickly into nothing. Little lacing nose is sweet with malt, maple, nut, slightly toasty. Taste is very sweet - maple, nut, toasty. Reminds me a bit of sweet tea actually. Syrupy mouthfeel that seems a bit thinner than it should be - but silky smooth. Quite drinkable. Overall a very sweet brew with no bitterness."
"This is a very drinkable beer. I see no reason to not be able to drink these all evening. If you dig Scotch Ales, this is in the same ballpark, just on the mild side."
"Overall, this is a nice change of pace for a nut brown with the sweet maple adding a different element. This is not my favorite style, but I would recommend this to someone who's looking for a nut brown that's slightly less nutty."
"Drinkability: This one is a favorite of mine and a guilty pleasure beer. I love how the maple just pops. It is sweet but still has the nut brown taste. I could session this one."
"Overall this beer wasn't horrible, but IMHO it's an average beer."
"It's a pretty medium brown beer with a small amount of tan head. Low carbonation. The aroma is slightly nutty with sweet malts. The taste is a bit nutty at first then the maple kicks in after a few seconds. The maple is not overpowering, it's very nice. The finish is very smooth. The body was about perfect for a brown. This is definitely a repeat buy."
"There was really no body whatsoever, underpowered in every way. However there was plenty of bite/carbonation ruling out what I thought could be a tainted beer. But part of me just thinks this one was supposed to be a little better than this...."
"This is an interesting beer, to say the least. It has the characteristics of a good nut brown, but maybe tries to go too far by adding the maple syrup...it tastes too much like syrup, and not enough of the brown malty flavor comes through."
"Light/medium bodied, smooth and easy to drink."
"Overall this is a good beer. I havn't too many eye-opening nut brown ales, but this one is interesting. I love the maple syrup they add, and the fact that its not overwhelming or too faint. Kinda expensive, but I liked this one."
"D: just can't do it, this may end up in the drain."
" It is a good solid tasting beer, but even on a cool spring night, you wouldn't probably drink more than 2 of these. The flavor of maple and caramel is nice at first, but you get tired of it by the end of the glass and are looking for something a bit different."
"This one depends on the individual's tolerance for sweetness, but is pretty good. You'll find nut browns with better balance, etc., but this one deserves a chance as well."
"My wife just brought me this beer in a pint glass. There's no head at all but perhaps I should blame her for that. She was nice enough to buy it at Kroger for me when I asked her to get me something other than Miller Lite. Other than the lack of head it's dark ruby brown and hard to see through. Smells sweet and malty like maple syrup and plums. Tastes much the same way it smells. Malty, maple sweet, and no bitterness. I'm used to ales having some hoppy charachteristics but there are none with this beer. Mouthfeel is a touch heavier than water with little carbonation. A little creamy... Maybe. I can't see myself drinking too many of these in any quantity. OK beer. Nothing great."
"D= my goal is to finish just this first bottle."
"This beer pours a clear brownish amber color. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes quickly into minimal lacing. The aroma is of caramel and toffee, and is rather simple. The taste is a lot more prominent than the aroma. There is a nice balance between the maple flavor and the malty toffee and caramel flavors. The mouthfeel is quite thin for the style, and the texture is watery. Overall, this beer is very odd in that is has some aspects that are very good, and others that are very poor. I wish it had some maple in the nose, and fuller body. As is though I can't see myself drinking it again."
"D - Although the taste is not the best, these is fairly easy to drink."
"poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a standard shaker ""pint"" glass. Appears a clear medium brown color with two fingers of light tan foam. No lacing to speak of. Smells and tastes of light roasted grains, brown sugar, nuts such as pecans and hazelnuts, maple syrup, a hint of bitter coffee and chocolate malt. This brown ale is medium bodied and amply carbonated. Decent stuff."
"I have 5 more to drink and I know I'll get through it but this beer tastes too much like maple for me to buy a 6pk of again. If I want this much maple syrup I'll call Aunt Jamima or go to IHOP, it's just that strong a maple taste. YMMV"
"A bit more drinkable as it warms, but not much. A thin brew without much character; quite disappointing."
"Taste is a very weak brown ale, with slight carbonation. Not a whole lot going on in this beer at all. Tommyknocker beers just don't do it for me. I've yet to be even mildly impressed with one. I'll just chalk it up to not being for me."
"This was the last beer I had from the Tommyknocker variety sixer, three of the six were great beers. Glad to have tried these."
"Pours a clear, dark amber color with some lighter amber hues along the edges of the glass. 1/4 inch head of an off-white color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells strongly of roasted malt up front, even strong hints of coffee, and some slight cream sweetness. Fits the style of an American Brown Ale. Mouth feel is really smooth and slightly chewy with an average carbonation level. Tastes very sweet first, then the roasted malts come through, then some coffee notes and some sweet malt, decent hop background, and it finishes with a blend of flavors that is really pleasing. Overall, this is a great beer full of flavors and really easy to drink, can't understand why it's rated so low!"
"Pours a dark brown, caramely colored body, with a creamy, nearly-white head, lasting. Very malty Aroma, some dust, some dark sugar, maple I'd say. Dusty watery taste, some maple. A little nuttiness. Weak & almost headache inducing."
"D - Sweet and tasty. Easy to drink. I haven't had this beer in sometime and I don't know why I stopped getting it. Very good."
"D: Light and sweet without diminishing in drinkability."
"Overall impression: A mostly forgettable American Brown. Very middle of the road. Nothing exciting but not terrible."
"Overall: It seems I might have a higher opinion of this brew than most. I went into this expecting to be inundated with maple, but it's really quite subtle. I recommend giving it a try."
"Overall, this is an easy to drink beer. A great session beer, but I would rather have something more complex or hoppy."
"Clear dark brown body, in certain angles it looks like a dark amber. Pours a nice off white head. Smells like a malt lover's dream. Very rich and sweet smelling. Not much for hop aroma though. Wow, taste is very very ballanced. The front is sweet and malty, toasted malt, with a hint of maple sugar. I think I can taste more maple in the after taste as well. Little to no hops are detectable, making this beer extremely smooth and balances (dangerously good). Mouthfeel is watery and refreshing; this could actually get the job done on a hot day. And drinkability is very good due to a lack of bitterness on the finish, all that sugary flavor up front, and refreshing mouthfeel."
"Had this at the Super Bowl party and thought it was pretty interesting. Poured a dark chestnut with just a little tan head. Aromas were very subdued (I was expecting a maple blast) but the taste was great. A big nuttiness right up front; the maple became more evident on the palate as the beer warmed, but was always more noticeable on the finish. Medium body was fine. Not a session beer by my standard but a fun beer to try."
"Nikki"
"Try this beer if you like a full bodied; somewhat sweet, but very drinkable beer."
"Drinkability was excellent. I kept thinking to myself, ""This beer isn't even that good"". And in a few minutes, I had polished off the bottle without knowing it. That light flavor contributes to the huge drinkability. I'll definitely pick up some more bottles of this when I'm in the mood for something maple-flavored."
"good drinkability."
"D: a little on the sweet side for me, probably not a great session beer in my opinion, but not a bad beer overall, a lot better than i expected. maple syrup is a nice addition to a traditional brown ale."
"Pretty decent for a Tommyknocker brew. Worth having!"
"Not a bad beer by any means, but not the sryupy maple infused beer I was hoping for."
"D: I could drink a few."
"D - A little mild on the flavor, but not mild enough to put me off a second one."
"Drinkability is not very high in my book as the flavor is on the mellow side and not satisfying enough to go back for more."
"Appearance: A dark brown with reddish hues, absent of a head. The smell is malty, nutty, a hint of yeast. absent of hops but a note of maple. The taste is thin watery no body. The maple flavor come out in the finish. Would be a great beer if it had more of a malt backbone."
"D: Very drinkable. If I had to, I could drink alot of this, however, prefer more flavorable beers."
"D: This beer struck me as sort of a one-trick pony. The maple theme is pushed to the extent that it overwhelms anything else that night be going on. Certainly not a bad beer, but not one I'm anxious to revisit."
"Overall, an ok beer that I would drink again if had limited options, but wouldnt go out of my way to buy more."
"D: A decent brew, but there are better Tommyknocker beers and much better, more interesting brown ales out there."
"Drinkability: Although it is too sweet for my tastebuds and lacks any balancing complexity, it is not unpleasant to drink and should appeal to those who may like a sweet, malty and slightly off-kilter brew"
"Oy, this is a sorry excuse for a brown ale. Actually this is a sorry beer period. I look at my numbers and I feel I'm being a tad generous to the rating, but I'll leave them be. Redeeming qualities are in very short supply. Real quick: slight maple aroma nothing else, good initial pour soon becomes flat and thin, mouthfeel is awkward and light, flavor is so freaking weak and bland, overall a major bummer. Back in '97 I took my first road trip out west, we drove through Idaho Springs and boy am I glad we didn't stop if this is what passes for beer in that little mountain town. Later gnomes!"
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, would enjoy it again. Leaves you wanting another sip. Not a big beer, but good when out or with a meal."
"If you're looking for a great brown ale, try the Rogue Hazelnut Brown Nectar. It'll knock your socks off."
"Where's the maple? Just a standard brown ale here, nothing too spectacular about it. The label says there's a maple taste, as does the name, but I can't taste it one bit. At least that would have made this one unique. I would drink this again if handed to me but if I had a choice in a beer store for a six pack.. this one wouldn't be very high."
"Drinkability: Decent malt profile and the addition of maple syrup does it's best to try and spruce up the standard brown ale, a beer many find outright boring."
"A decent brownish color with reddish tints and a one-finger head that died quickly but left some lace. Has a faint malt smell, with some roasted malts and maybe a hint of coffee/nut. Light to medium bodied and a tad syrupy, has a semi-slick malt feel to it. There are some noticeable sweet malts in here and faint hop presence, but this is pretty much a generic brown ale that isn't worth pursuing."
"This was a decent American Brown Ale but I probably wont buy it again. Although it has an interesting flavor and is definitely worth trying if you get a chance."
"Overall- Another Tommyknocker that fails to impress. Looks good but quickly takes a nose dive. cheap sweet corn syrupy maple syrup flavor just doesn't win me over sorry."
" Easy to drink, but not a session beer."
"Rather lack luster brown ale. Poured quickly from the bottle and I had to wonder for a second if this beer was completely flat. Smell vaguely like maple syrup, which I was expecting from the name of the beer. If not on the label I dont know if I would have been able to pick it out. Tastes like a really watered down brown ale with not much aftertaste. Over all a very dissappointing ale, as I have been looking for a new brown ale to have with cooler weather coming."
"No syrup in the feel, though, which is on the watery side of medium-bodied and somewhat juicy otherwise. Nicely carbonated and very drinkable."
"Note: Pronounced twanginess in a brown ale isn't standard. This may have been a defective keg. Will taste and score if seen again elsewhere."
"I was a tad disappointed here. The bland mouthfeel and flavor were what killed me, combined with the decided maple punch I was thirsting for. Again, there may have been factors at play here which turned the beer, but, nevertheless one I probably wouldn;t go out of my way to get."
"For someone like me this beer isn't bad at all. However, from an objective standpoint, there is way too much maple syrup in this beer and not enough malts to balance. It's pedestrian at best. I could have a couple because I like maple syrup, but I'm sure it would get old after a little while."
"While I don't doubt the ""pure maple syrup"" on the label, the taste is more of molasses, thick and sugary with the malty backbone of the nut brown. For me, very cloying and overlysweet that builds. The maple doesn't blend well with the base beer either with a light, watery mouthfeel. Sounds good on the surface, but not much to dig down into."
"Drinkability - I remembered this one being better in the past... Perhaps this Trail Mix 6-pack had been sitting for a while, but nothing has been stellar for sure."
"Purchased as part of ""build-your-own-six-pack"" at local grocer. Small head on a dark amber body. Head is gone quickly. Very light nutty scent, matched with maple. Taste is about the same, features a coffee/caramel finish. Low fizz. Not bad, but not great"
"Pretty good brew, nothing earth shattering though."
"D- easy to put these down but it could get quite dull after 3 or 4. This is for coors light drinkers looking to try another form watered down alcohol."
"M & D: Carbonation was very mild. Smooth and easy drinking ale, but I found this to be very average. Nothing special about this to distinguish it from other browns. This is the fourth or fifth beer I've sampled from this brewer, and I 've been mostly unimpressed."
"Pours a three finger cream head that fades quickly to a thin layer leaving some lace. Clear mahogany color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Malty maple nose. Flavor is sweet maple smooth, hops balance but are in background. $1.80 for a 12oz bottle from Yankee Spirits South Attleboro, Ma."
"Brown with some red/orange tinges around the side. Thin tan head with a few spots of lacing left behind. Smell is sweet malt with some maple sweetness thrown in there. No hops shows up in this one. Taste matches the smell with just some faint nutty flavors. Overall very bland. Mouth is thin and gives a powdered malt homebrew impression. This one starts out looking OK but goes downhill from there. Nothing to make me come back and try this one again."
"To sweet for me,needs more balancing to it.I wont be buying this beer again."
"overall, this isnt a beer that i can see myself buying again"
"D. A very filling and enjoyable beer. Nothing special but definately worth trying."
"Dark brown pour with a pale, creamy head. Weak but fresh smell. Taste is unique to be sure. Lots of nuttiness, a hint of maple, and I think I tasted barbecue sauce ;-). Mouthfeel is decent if not a bit too carbonated. Drinkability also a little better than average."
"A clear brown color with a poor tan head. The nose has some mild malts and is quite light. The taste is marginally improved with a faint nuttiness and bitter hop presence. Really not too much going on here. Light body and heavy carbonation. Very mild, even for a brown."
"D: Pretty drinkable for an english brown ale."
"wow, very watery!... the dullest most boring beer in the history of ales ... at least there's no aftertaste ... hell, at least theres no aftertaste, but u need taste to get an aftertaste..one of the shadiest brown ales around .... more disappointing than constipation..."
"D - My complaints don't really detract from the drinkability here. You could put away 2-3, and it would probably go great with a glazed chicken or pork dish, among other foods."
"Light in body, low carbonation, and incredibly smooth. Goes down very easily. A real session beer that has just enough to keep you interested. Not a bad choice for gameday."
"The taste is slightly nutty, very sweet and caramel-like. On top of this, there are bits of maple, brown sugar and vanilla with a little touch of hops in the finish. There's moderate carbonation, a plain body - kind of watery. There are no major turn offs here, good taste. This a good session beer if nothing else."
"D = This is an easy drinking beer from its light, sweet flavor, but I didn't really care too much for its visual aspects and the fizziness really was a drawback, making it just average when all considered.."
"D - This is a really nice brown ale with a unique twist It's slightly sweeter and less dry than most browns, but it's a nice mellow sipper that could be a great autumn session brew."
"This poured a hazy medium brown with a little tan head. It smelled almost exactly like hard apple cider with a bit of hops. It tasted mostly like apple cider, with some citrus hops added in, but there was no noticeable maple or nut. It was watery with some carbonation and had a mildly bitter aftertaste. Overall this was a good clean drink, but not at all what I expected."
"Nice deep dark brown color. One finger head with minimal lacing. Not a whole lot of action in the way of carbonation resulting in a flat mouth feel. Taste is okay with hints of chocolate and maple but overall unimpressive. So far the Pick Axe Ale is my favorite for TommyKnocker"
"Nutty brownish amber type thing with a thin slightly darker than off-white head. Aromas of slightly roasty malt, macadamia nuts and maple. The flavor was pretty bland - a little nutty, roasty malt with a very elusive maple character. Kinda slippery on the tongue. Medium bodied with a slightly sweet finish. Not sure what to make of it. I would re-name this one ""College Town Brown."""
"This was a wierd beer. Often times the scent is a large indicator of taste. This was not one of those times. The appearance was pretty bland, same color as maple syrup but not quite as thick. Smell is sweet like candy, taste is rather dry. I don't get it. Drinkable beer, but not my favorite brown ale."
"Medium body with some airiness for being such a flat-seeming beer. Really about what anybody, I think, should expect from a maple nut brown ale."
"Poured a dark brown to dark copper color. There is little to no head. I was kinda excited about this beer and so far, so good. The aroma is sweet. Scent of roaster nuts as well as chocolate. Very sweet and very malty as expected. The flavor didn't give me what I was looking for. Maybe thats my fault. Too little of everything. I expected powerful malts, roasted nuts and nice chocolate taste. I got a little roasted malts and a little hint of others. The finish is plain and boring."
"D - This was my first from Tommyknocker. It was good, but nothing too impressive. I'm looking forward to trying the ButtHead and Pick Axe."
"Taste was nutty and sweet. Very light hop bitterness. Not really much going on with this beer. Pretty plain."
"Dark yet transluscent maroon colored pour with a light beige head. Oddly sweet maple smell, with a light sour vinegar smell. Not good. Taste is basically nutty, light, smooth and boring. I bought 3 other beers from this brewery and I hope this isn't their best... I really wanted to like this, and was drawn in from the bottle, but it really wasn't good. Didn't finish and wouldn't get again."
"This is not a bad brew at all. Pretty solid nut brown with some good flavor and sweetness to it."
"Overall: Decent, nothing special though. I liked it enough but there are much better brown ales to be had."
"Drinkability: An easy drinking beer, I like the one I had, but this beer is just not a wow beer. Would I buy another? Maybe. I probably would try this on tap, but a whole six pack? I'm not so sure."
"IMO, this beer is a novelty. If I want a brown ale, Ill drink Moose Drool. If I want a maple brown something I am going straight for the TK Imperial Nut Brown. While this standard version is good it isnt special enough or frankly rich enough for me to want to drink again. Would I turn down a free pint? No. Would I buy one? Maybe. Will I seek this out? No. Purchased in Omaha."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a deep brown with a slight amber hue and a thin, creamy, off-white cap. The smell is underwhelming, maple syrup not really apparent but it is malty sweet, a bit nutty and slightly roasted. The taste is much the same, tastes like a nut brown ale. Starts with a malty nutty presence and finishes with an off taste that isn't very enjoyable. There is also just a hint of hops. The mouthfeel is lighter than I had expected, maybe a medium-light body with a decent carbonation. A drinkable beer but this one falls short of my expectations."
"Overall I liked the beer but it was more of a drinking beer as opposed to a tasting beer . . . .if that makes any sense."
"D - Good beer that's easy to drink."
"-Oelergud"
"D- Seemed a little too sweet, but that's prolly just my taste in beer, I wouldn't have it again."
"Overall I thought this would be nice as I am a fan of the brown ale and sweetness has never seemed to bother me; however they were just used in the wrong proportions here. Way overboard on the sweetness it just really became kind of messy. I will not be pursuing this one again."
"D - Overall I probably wouldn't seek this out all the time, but it was good for a pint and I'd have some again"
"I didn't really care for TK's brews when I was in Idaho Springs, and as I work my way through this 6'er I'm already being reminded of why. Watery, soapy, wierd off-flavors. This one should be passed upon. Ugh."
"A bland and mild English Brown, whose flavor seems to have no direction. Not worth sampling."
"Overall- A good drinkable brown ale. It isn't as flavorful as some on the market, but it's a great beer on an early fall night when you're looking at drinking more than one. I'd drink it again."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle with bottling info on back label into a pint glass. It was a deep brownish amber color. It had a good head that settled to a thin coating with some lacing. The aroma was toasted malt with maple overtones. The taste was good - malty backbone with a sweet finish. Unlike the honey flavored beers, this maple one gets the right amount of sweetness with being too cloying. I've had this on tap at the brewery and it's a little better on tap but still good in the bottle. Overall it's a good but not great beer and I enjoy it as a good change-up session beer. Glad to see them back in Texas after leaving due to distributor issues. (3.5, OR, T, Y)"
"Pours a deep amber color with an off-white head. Aromas that consist of maple syrup and brown sugar. In the taste, sweet and a dry maple syrup flavor. A smooth dry mouthfeel with a sweet/ sticky maple syrup aftertaste. Sweet and dry in all the right places, easy to drink and better as it warms up."
"Poured a dark and slightly hazy brown with a big head that faded fairly quickly leaving some descent lacing. The smell is roasted malt and chocolate with a touch of sweetness. Wow...not for me. Take this one with a grain of salt. Maybe it went bad; it is 4 months past 'due'. The mouth on this one isn't sweet at all. Instead its a biting, sharp, astringent sting. In other words, its a pour. I would have thought that would have shown in the nose."
"This beer started off better then it ended. Everything to the eye looked good. Dark brown color like the color of wood. The smell was not bad. It had a sweet honey smell and kind of a caramel burnt sugar smell. It tastes very malty and thick like molasses. Its not to bad up front but the sugar just becomes to much after a few drinks. I might have to check my self for diabetes after this. The maple and nut brown flavors are all there but they taste too sweet and artificial to me. Not a huge fan but it might be a good beginner beer."
"Tried this on-tap at Bodega in Columbus, Ohio. Poured reddish maple syrup color with a thin white head. Not a lot of retention. Smells and tastes were a little weak, but appropriate for a brown ale: nuts, maple syrup, bit of lightly toasted grained. Not much of a finish. A little watery on the mouthfeel. Overall, an easily drinkable session beer. Not a whole lot of astonishing character, but pleasant to drink nonetheless."
"This was a strange brew that (oddly enough) reminded me of grape soda."
"Drinkability: Pretty good."
"D- This is a solid beer for occasional drinking but nothing spectacular."
"The look is the best part of this beer--nice long lasting head with good lace. The color is a slightly murky light brown"
"Notched April 19th 2007, best by 4 months after."
"Aroma is sweet/malty, with interesting smoky notes. Fairly sweet malt up front with a mild hint of maple carrying through to a restrained hoppy finish. The somewhat syrupy mouthfeel actually goes well with the flavor and style. Not a bad brown ale, the smokiness and maple make it pretty interesting. However, a bit too sweet to want to drink too many."
"mouthfeel is thin and sour. Disappointing."
"Okay beer. I cant decide whether I really taste the maple or am just imagining it. The nutty malt and caramel/honey sweetness could resemble maple. Either way, to my taste, its an okay beer at best."
"Not bad overall. The best of the mixed sixer I have had (this is the fourth) so this one is worthy of consumption. Give it a shot."
"D: Fair. This would be a good sessioner for the late fall months. Maybe i'll come back then and give it another try."
"Not my favorite style, but generally well-crafted. Where's the maple, though?"
"Poured into a pint glass, pours a brownish color with fluffy head that does leave a ring while drinking. Smell is of fig and some bitterness as well also some sweet honey nectar in there. Taste is pretty sour for my liking not much carbonation just sourness, it taste like some lemon squeezed into a beer, its actually tangy and tarty, not what I was expecting. This was my first beer from Tommyknocker, it was a bit unusual."
"Worth a shot."
"Eric"
"Medium body, moderate carbonation. Balance is ok. A little on the sweet side, but not too much, but I would prefer the sour component to be more subtle. Decent drinkability, as you could easily down a few of these in a sitting."
"Brought this one home about a year ago. Serving it room temperature now. Light tan head that quicly yields to a light broken cover with almost no lace. Brown color with some copper red highlights. Nose is of bread, maple, nuts, caramel, and malt. Taste is the same but less so. Body is a yawner. When I've had this before it was a lot better; so, maybe it's the age."
"The mouth could use a bit of bulking-up. Not a bad take on the style. Im always surprised more brewers dont experiment with maple syrup. This reminds me a bit of the Point Maple (from Stevens Point Brewery) that was out in the mid 1990s."
"style of beer."
"Founds this while in Chicago for the day. Pours a dark brown color and is opaque. Has a nice head that things out a little. Smells nutty and slightly sweet. Seems a little resiny too. Mouthfeel is smooth and moderately carbonated. It's a little dry and tastes a little like bourbon, but a little watery. Malts are moderate, but the hops are light. This was a decent and I probably pick this up again if I find it."
"It is hard to tell what this beer looks like, what with I was drinking it out of a brown bottle. However, it does have an interesting smell, more like maple syrup than beer. Fortunately, the maple flavor does not overwhelm the ale taste; in fact, there is just a whisper of maple. The ale flavor is strong and without bitterness, and it feels very smooth. Not outstanding, but very drinkable."
"Wow, Tommyknocker seems to believe in order to make beer, you have to add more sugar than hops. It tasted way too sweet from start to finish. Had no bitterness. Smelled very mapley. Had very fine carbonation. Thick creamy mouthfeel, which was good. Poured dark brown, almost opaque, which was good. But the important part, taste, fell way short."
"Drinkability: Great. This is a perfect session beer. I could find my self enjoying a few of these in the pub."
"The pour into my Fuller's nonic raises a forgettable head even after a hard pour at the end. It's less than a half finger, light tan, and falls exceedingly quickly. The body, though, is a beautiful transparent deep garnet. The nose has a discernible sweetness that might be maple, but it could be simply because of the label. There's a slight bit of nuttiness and breadiness, but the aroma is on the whole far too light. The first thing I notice in the taste is a definite light maple taste, with nuttiness and sweet toasted malt flavors. There's a great malt aftertaste, too. They definitely didn't use much maple, but this could be a very nice session beer, with enough comfortable flavor to be interesting, but not too much to hinder quaffing. The mouth is light, perhaps a bit much, but the carbonation is spot-on: present, but not too tingly. I'd buy this again, and would also love to have it by the pitcher at a pub."
"Well upon first drink I thought ""hell this ain't that bad"" but on the second drink I wonder why I bought this brew on draught. Overly maple syrupy, thick, palate coating and very cloying sweetness. Slight nut flavors but everything is just overpowered by the maple."
"Poured into a pint glass with almost no head that quickly dissolved into a collar. Aroma was very malty with undertones of maple and brown sugar. Initial was somewhat strong on the maple syrup, it was more under toned in the aftertaste. Not the best beer I've had by far, but brown ales are one of my least favorite styles. For a brown ale, this is drinkable."
"Pours a hazy chestnut color with some golden hues and a very nice cream colored head with decent retention. Aroma is of toasted and nutty malt. While the bottle states maple syrup is added it is barely noticeable if at all. Taste is a of toasted malt and perhaps a faint maple finish. Taste is also slightly metallic. Mouthfeel is a little lighter than I would prefer but not bad. Drinkability is ok, I dont really care for another though."
"pours a medium to dark brown with a nice two finger tan head that holds well and a good lacing to the finish. faint smells of maple and nuts and toasted malt. really liked the added maple syrup but thought it was a little weak, but a very nice combination with the nut and toasted malt flaver. mouthfeel very smooth with good carbonation. drinkability? can't wait to get more."
"I grabbed a bottle of this at a great beer store in Boulder while heading back home from the GABF in September. The beer poured a deep brown, thick body with long streams of carbonation running quickly from the bottom to form a nice foamy head with thick bubbles. The aroma of this one was sweet, probably from the maple syrupness to this one, nutting. The taste was not overly complex and not as mapley or nutty as the name would suggest. There were notes of maple and some nutty tones but overall this was a fairly light beer although I am glad I gave it a try."
"Drinkability: Not as drinkable as you would want in a brown ale, too sweet and sugary for that."
"The taste (as noted above) was overly tarty and light (springy?) on the palate. Light carbonation as well. The chocolate and maple notes, as indicated on the bottle, have all but been lost due to time on the shelf. I'd give this beer another try, but I'll definately look to see how old the beer is."
"Pours a slightly murky dark brown color with a small off white head that leaves a decent amount of lacing. The aroma displays a nice toasted maltiness with some caramel and a sweet maple nutty smell. The taste is very smooth bodied with a nutty toasted maltiness and some caramel and a touch of chocolate. Overall, despite not being the most complex brew around it is a highly drinkable brown ale that is very solid."
"I didn't find this extremely drinkable for a beer. It reminded me of a muted and watery Woodchuck cider. Nothing really negative, just not very quenching."
"Drinkability - I enjoy sweet beers but this one pushes me too much past the limit."
"I had this brewer's Imperial Maple Nut Brown Ale some time back; I absolutely loved it. My hunch was that this would be similar, but with lower alcohol and less intense flavor. This proved to be the case, but the heavy sweetness was something I hadn't counted on. Probably won't try again."
"Tastes very much like smells. Big kick of very sweet syrup at the start, followed up quickly by a lingering caramel and chocolate malt. Pretty good, even if it's nothing special."
"D = I am not a fan of the taste so much, so not extremely drinkable."
"The drinkability suffers from the excess sweetness. MK"
"Dnot bad, but a little bit sweet for my taste"
"Thanks to BuckeyeNation for this one!"
"Yum! If you love sweet maple syrup you'll love this beer. It had a smooth maple goodness that wasn't too rich. It's smell reminded me of when I used to sit under maple trees when I lived in Chicago. Even it's milk chocolate brown color made me want to have this beer with a warm short stack."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a minimal 1/4"" beige head above the slightly cloudy red brew. Head is quickly down to a swirly layer of teensy bubbles, with average lacing. Aroma is deeply of grains, which I like. Taste continues the maltiness from the nose, with a touch of light fruitiness buried in there, and a slight chalky close. Mouthfeel is smooth, almost cask-like, and drinkability is good as well. A pleasant surprise here, yum."
"Cola colored wtih a medium off white head. The smell is malty and nutty, with a hint of vegetables (corn, carrots, not good). The vegetable smell blew off, and returned... a few times in the couple bottles I had. Fortunately, it was virtually undetectable in the taste. It had a decent malty backbone with some sugary tastes too, and a nice nutty brown ale flavor, with a small amount of detectable maple. Mouthfeel was different. It had body, but also a thin or watery charecter to it as well. It had syrupy aspects to it, but also chewy and ligher aspects as well. I assume this is the reuslt of brewing with sypup. Overall I found it to be a bit on the sweet side, and we cant forget the funky smell, but mostly it was drinkable and enjoyable."
"Poured a clear deep reddish-brown color with modest creamy slightly off-white head. Modest lacing. Smell is a pleasant mixture of roasted malt with a distinct maple syup background. The maple syrup really comes through in the taste and is suprisingly enjoyable. Reminds me a scottish ale. Nice full creamy mouthfeel. Good drinkability, but would never try to session."
"Yikes, this beer kind of tastes like a mess. Reminds me of the often dreaded Caramel Porter Saranac makes seasonally. Its just to damn sweet - the bottom line. It looks nice enough and doesnt smell too bad, but I just can't drink this one. And I can usually at least finish a bottle of anything decent. Call it a maple ale maybe, I couldn't find any brown."
"Overall I think it's a decent brown ale, the sweetness makes it a little different from the crowd."
"Pours a hazy red color with a thick head of large bubbles. Aroma is woody, lots of toasted grain. Possibly a lot of biscuit malt. Taste is odd almost a tart flavor. Nothing like expected. The only other time I have had this flavor is in a homebrew batch with over stressed wheat yeast and caramunich malt. I would think anyone expecting any maple flavor would be very disappointed with this one. Not even close to a nut brown IMO. Not a drain pour, but style wise this bottle was way off. Second bottle was more of the same. Nothing even remotely like maple syrup or a nut brown ale. Infection?"
"Not a bad beer, I would drink again, just wish it had a touch more flavor and mouthfeel."
"D - This one is enjoyable. A nice sweet refresher."
"The maple syrup sweetness can become a little cloying, but still a decent beer. unusual, but not overly complex. Worth a try."
"Taste is pretty one sided with the main flavors being some malty nuttiness and faint maple sugar flavor. Very smooth and easy on the mouthfeel making this one a great session brew. Would have liked a bit more body/complexity to it before being labeled ""great."""
"Mouthfeel was more of a weak Porter than a brown ale. The dark roasted malt flavor was present, very mild almost earthy hops. Not much sweetness which was a good thing in my book. A good froth elicited some sweeter malt flavors. Nothing spectacular but very drinkable. I could easily do 2+ on draft anytime."
"This one is officially my least favorite brown ale of all time, at least that was my opinion at first sip. Maybe somthing was up with it, but it tasted like sour skittles were added to the flavor. Nothing else worth noting, could barely finish it. Tried it out at Flying Saucer Charlotte."
"D: Very sweet, couldn't drink a lot of it. OK for what it is. Maple is a bit artificial flavored, not full and rich like good maple syrup."
"I like the way that Tommyknocker Brewery colors outside the lines. They add lemongrass to Jack Whacker (an American pale wheat) and they add maple syrup to this American brown. Bottom line: Maple Nut Brown Ale is good beer that could be great beer by adding more of what makes it good beer in the first place."
"Tommyknocker Maple Nut Brown Ale pours a medium brown with ruby around the edges. The aroma is malty/nutty. Taste is pretty good, malt dominates and there is a nice nut taste. You can taste the maple in the finish, which is on the sweet side. I like this, it's quite drinkable. Definitely worth a try."
"I have to admit I approached this beer with some hestitation. I've had a couple of maple-flavored beers that were more like Hungry Jack pancake syrup than beer. The maple in this beer, however, was very well integrated in the flavor profile. A mid-weight brown ale with pleasant roasted malt flavor. The maple notes melded with chocolate malt and a nutty flavor. Quite nice for a specialty beer."
"All in all I would say that it is a nicely drinkable beer but may be a better dessert beer than a session beer."
"Dark Red. Fairly pleasant aroma with notes of butter toffee, caramel, coffee beans, dark fruits and maple. This is pretty tasty and well balanced. My only gripe is that it is a little too sweet. Notes of dark berries, toasted, munich, and caramel malts along with slight chocolate and coffee."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is just slightly less than medium bodied. This is a fairly one dimensional beer. You could certainly do alot worse than this beer. I wouldnt be upset if I could not buy this beer again."
"Last swigs: I had a few TommyKnockers in the past few weeks and I dig 'em. Interesting, quality brews that are drinkable and tasty."
"Overall: A nice easy drinking brown ale. They are better browns out there, but this one isn't bad."
"Well, the maple is hard to pick up in this brew. It is a deep brown color. The smell is somewhat like brown sugar. The taste is semi-sweet. The taste is more like caramel to me than maple syrup. The mouthfeel is smooth. There is just a touch of bitterness in the end. Overall, a drinkable brew that I could try again."
"Never knowing what you get from Tommyknocker (sometimes wonderful, but sometimes lackluster), this Brown Ale shows a lot of promise. Starts with a creamy, nutty, chocolate-ey, malty flavor and develops into a lightly tart, sweet, thinning body in the finish. The maple syrup adds a lot of sweetness, tartness, nuttiness, and accentuates the chocolate malts. Never thick, but remains creamy and finishes a little lighter than expected. Leaves a little residual sugar on the toung and a hint of twangy fermentedness. Not overly complex, yet pleasant and nice. I look forward to having another."
"The beer pours a nice brown color with thick offwhite head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a sweet caramel malt scent along with some maple notes. The taste is good as well. It has a sweet burnt toffee flavor that goes down easy with some nutty notes and finishes dry and a bit fruity. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking brown ale. It has a wonderful malt flavor and aroma; a fine sessions brew."
"Darker brown color, transparent with a flat 1/4 inch head. Simple drips and marks for lace. You can get a bit of maple syrup from the aroma, a bit of strange sharp grape. Mouthfeel is shy of medium, carbonation is fairly restrained. Starts out with the maple flavors, a sense of cashews, practically all sweet malt in the impression. Slightly tangy and distracting in the middle with a finish that's kind of chalky and a little on the thin side. Not overly sweet or really cloying, but not that exciting or satisfying either. Syrup shows up again in the aftertaste."
"D: A beer I will eventually try again, especially if I could find it on tap. A good beer to cap off your night. I would recommend it if you are looking for something different and you like sweet beers. A notable brew."
"I decided to check this out at Tyler's in Durham. Was a pretty dark brown, as a brown should be, but had almost no head. Appeared kind of watery. Aroma was very meak, with some roasted malts, maybe. The taste is what stuck out the most, with the same general first impression as a watery porter. Rather smoky, chocolaty, sweet and roasted but had that little kick of maple syrup and/or brown sugar that lingered. I did find it pretty pleasant but don't think I could have more than one or two in a night. No carbonation and the sweetness was pretty powerful. Overall a good try and a unique beer, no matter what anyone says."
"Not sure where the maple is in this. More caramel than anything else in the smell and taste. Some roasted malt and yeast in the finish. Not much in hops department, smooth and drinks easy"
"Aroma is sharp and almost cheese like. Red/brown with a small fading head. Basic brown ale with a bit of woody maple sweetness. Not bad not good. Actually it leans a little toward bad just in that it kinda sits there not doing anything flavor wise except being mildly sweet and if you only have one trick...sweet isn't the one to have."
"This offering poured with a finely beaded head and released an intriguing smell; nut, maple, and malted sweetness. The body is brownish amber, full preparing me for what I expect is an onslaught of maple syrup. The mouthfeel is fairly thick and full bodied. Wow, to my surprise its more of a nutty flavor than anything, and is certainly at the forefront. The maple appropriately dangles in the background and actually acts as a nice compliment. A little bit of a toasted bread feel. It finishes with a little nutty grittiness and some paler maple notes. While not the greatest in the world, it surpassed my low expectations."
"A dark brown ale with with a nice carmel head. Decent lacing as I tore through the beer which alludes to the drinkability. The obvious Maple smell and hints of carmel (sweet) and a smokey, wood ester. The taste was smooth but a flat in carbonation. (This was confirmed by the last of the growler we consumed later that night.) Overall an above average brew with potential. I remember it being much better which affects my personal scoring. That damn Russian judge in my head..."
"This brew is much more of a thin porter than Nut Brown Ale"
"Had an awesome head, with great retention. Some of the best retention I've seen in a while, actually. Other than that, it was a little bit of a let down. I was expecting something a little more ""mapley"" and would have a stronger taste associated with Nut Brown Ales, but this was kind of wimpy. The maple was a very small footnote in the taste, something you had to concentrate to taste. Oh well, I've said it before, so I'll say it again, ""nothing ventured, nothing gained""."
"12 oz. with an overdue freshness date. Pours a very dark chestnut with blood red/crimson highlights and a 1 finger off-white head that doesn't leave any lace. Smells sweet with vinous malts and maybe some chocolate and nuts. Taste follows with the addition of molasses, caramel, some woodiness (maple), and a medium body with average carbonation. Average at best."
"This brown ale pours a dark brown to dark copper color. There is little to no head. I was kinda excited about this beer and so far, so good. The aroma is sweet. Scent of roaster nuts as well as chocolate. Very sweet and very malty as expected. The flavor didn't give me what I was looking for. Maybe thats my fault. Too little of everything. I expected powerful malts, roasted nuts and nice chocolate taste. I got a little roasted malts and a little hint of others. The finish is plain and boring. 2 seconds after my first sip, my mouth forgot what it had tasted. All in all a decent but somewhat plain brown ale. I think these Tommyknocker elves would be somewhat disappointed."
"Drinkability: This was not very balanced effort, I've had this beer before and it tasted better, so maybe just a bad bottle?"
"Drinkability is decent, different, and sweet. Seems pretty balanced to me."
"Bottle purchased by my wife at a local store and consumed a couple evenings later. Drink within 4 months of 01/June/05. Pours a half-finger light tan head over a cloudy brown liquid. Perhaps some red in there, too. Smells potently maple with some caramel/toffee. Tastes woody maple with biscuity malt undertones and a buttery sweet finish. Hints of chocolate rise late and the aftertaste is a refresher of the woody maple. Pretty simple flavor profile. Mouthfeel is medium and slick. Moderate carbonation. Nice to try, but not one I'll likely return to as a regular beer. Could be useful in cooking or served with/after a chocolatey desert."
"Body is light medium with kind of a watery, thin mouthfeel. Drinkable, but not desirable. Yawn."
"Appearance is pretty standard: copper color, ivory foam and lace. Aroma has some roasted grains and cashews. Initial taste contains toasty malt and something akin to caramel and toffee. Not a great example of a nut brown  there are better ones out there."
"Drinkability: Thin body, good carbonation and sweet maple make this a refreshing brew for a hot, sticky Wisconsin summer evening. I think I might give it another try after I make my rounds through some other recommended brown ales, there was just something about that maple sweetness that I really enjoyed. A solid offering from Tommyknocker."
"Very dark brown color, clear, with alomst no head. Smell is nutty, sweet, with maple presence, which carriers over to the taste, which also has a nice hop finish, and slight chocolate presence. Mouthfeel is not very well carbonated. Pretty good brown ale, but there are betters out there (see Bell's Best Brown)."
"Drinkability: The only BAD thing was the carrot smell. However, there's not a lot that sets this beer apart, only the maple flavor, which isn't nearly enough to overcome its almost complete lack of other flavors."
"Picked this up in Bergen Park, about 15 minutes from where it's brewed in Idaho Springs. Pours a medium-dark brown with very little head that dissapates quickly. Smell has notes of maple (no surprise here), slightly fruity. Medium-Low carbonation. Taste is quite good, definite maple here as well, plus a very faint charcoal taste on the finish, sweet overall with a finish that could be slightly dryer, but still very refreshing. Leaves a faint taste of pecan on the tongue after you've finished. Overall a very different, interesting beer."
"812"
"This is a solid Nut Brown Ale. I was a little leary because of the Maple aspect and figured it would taste the way flavored coffee does. To my surprise it didn't. The appearance was a nice translucent brown with a meager head. The aroma was malty with aa hint of Maple as was the flavor. It tasted like it had been burtonized possibly which I really think truly gives it the mouthfeel and flavor I appreciate in an English Brown Ale. All in all I enjoyed it even the Maple was quite pleasant at the level it was at."
"Brown Ales are pretty low on my personal style preference. This beer is drinkable, clean and not lacking in flavor. It is not complex or robust."
"I could count the number of mild brown ales I've been impressed with on on the fingers of one hand. This one is thin bodied and lacking substance and character. Nothing bad about this one, but it could be improved considerably with more roasted malt and a hops presence."
"On tap at Boston's. Pours a deep brown slightly cloudy liquid with a thin white head. Head retention and lace were not very good. Grainy and sweet smelling, with syrup. SLight flavor of roasted malt combined with a sweet hint of maple. Slightly cloying, but not unbearable. Not much hop bitterness or flavor. Lower carbonation. Overall, not a bad brown ale, not outstanding, but a good version. The slight maple flavor is pretty nice."
"Smooth, creamy, and delicious, if a tad uncomplex for my taste buds. A great dessert beer that's a step ahead of Newcastle."
"This is very dark for a brown ale. It had a small white head that disappeared quick. It does smell good... Way better than the beer tastes. The maple aroma with the malts they use is quite pleasing. The taste is a bit watery and the maple syrup overpowers the beer in a bad way and when you mix in the fact that Tommyknocker brews have such a thin body the beer becomes almost undrinkable. I had high hopes for this brewer, but so far I am unimpressed."
"This was the first of the Tommyknocker beers that I actually enjoyed drinking. Pours a brown color with a small head that quickly dies off and leaves a tiny bit of lacing on the glass. The aroma has a maple smell along with a malty backing and a small bit of hops. The flavor is very clean with a bit of roasted and maple. It's not great, but it's one of the best I've had from this company."
"This is a chore to drink."
"The beer pours a dark brown with only hints of reddish light coming through to show that its not black. There is no head to speak of. The nose is somewhat weak but is roasted with chocolate. The flavor is a little weak for me. There is chocolate and some of the maple sweetness coming through with the slightest hint of hop at the finish. I'd prefer more flavor andof a hop finish that this brings. The beer is lighter in my mouth that I would expect as well, it's only moderately thick. It just seems a bit lacking. This would be an easy beer to put a few away, but I would go for other brown's with more flavor over this one. Not bad, but not great."
"Would drink again, but would not seek out after trying once."
"Dark red/brown color with a rich off-white to tan head. Smell is of sweet malts and toasted nuts. Also touches of maple syrup. Taste is mellow, yet flavorful with some toasted malts and a hint of hops/bitterness. Quite sweet, with a medium mouthfeel. Very drinkable. Would be good poured over some ice cream."
"This beer, even though bland, was very refreshing and would be great on a hot summer day. Still it left alot to be desired."
"Deep amber hue, with a thin-ring head that will vanish, but maintain some patchy lacing throughout. Initial appearance is clumpy. A sweet and nutty, perhaps maple syrup detected on the nose. Up front, a defining maple syrup sweetness is thrashing on the palate, medium bodied. Perhaps some caramel notes, some malt backbone, an overwhelming sourness throughout. A smooth, residual free palate; yet the overpowering sweet-sour twanginess is too much to make this drinkable; not bad, but for the style, a bit out of line."
"The Maple Nut Brown poured a dark brown with red highlights. It had a smallish head with tiny bubbles that quickly dissipated to a thin film. It had a subtle malty, nutty nose with some maple thrown in. It has a nice full bodied malty, maple taste...maybe a tad too sweet though. This is a very drinkable beer that I like to order all the time."
"A deep chestnut body rests beneath a thin veil of white foam that dissipates readily and leaves no more than a smattering of tiny spotted lace. But the aroma is more impressive than the appearance with a nutty, toasted graininess and sweetish maple syrup. The body is medium, and the carbonation is quite restrained, allowing the sweetness to come through. Maple syrup definitely contributes to the flavor - at least in its sweetness, but the main component is the very nice nutty, toasty, caramelish and slightly chocolatey malt base beneath. Hops are downplayed, and leave just a subliminal bitterness and no flavor whatsoever. It finishes as might be expected, with some residual malt and a clearer note of maple syrup than is evident prior. Surprisingly, however, it's not cloying. It's interesting, somewhat complex, and drinkable although I think it needs to be reserved as a specialty beer because beyond one serving the sugars do tend to start to build on the palate. Still, very nice indeed!"
"The apperance of this was okay. It was nice and brownish red with a little head. It smelled of caramel and sweet malt. It tasted a little off. Kind of like a stale malt sweetness. It was okay. I couldn't drink many of these in one setting. A little dissapointed."
"Deep dark brown color. Off-white thin head. Lots of carbonation bubbles. Moderate smells of maple syrup, and hazelnut. Toasted malts break through too. Overall very inviting smell. Taste was marked by a highly charged carbonation lots of bubbles to start, seemed to keep the flavors in check. Some maple syrup and chocolate, hints of hazelnut. The label made me think it would be more maple syrup and more nutty. Toasted malts finish up, An slightly better than average brown ale. Drinkable yes, I guess I was expecting a little more. Not as full bodied and flavorful as the Brooklyn Brown Ale I had recently. Not in the same class as the Rogue Hazelnut Brown Nectar."
"Transparent brown on the pour with a modest frothy head that is a light tan color, the lace adequate to cover the glass. Nose is maple syrup sweet, fresh and inviting, nicely malted and a bit too sweet for my liking, top is rather thin. Finish mellow on the carbonation, hops adequate and the sweetness carries to the slightly dry aftertaste, a drinkable beer, but not a big hit with me. Tommyknockers had a brewpub here, but closed down, and mores the pity as I found some of their beers quite enjoyable, especially on tap."
"Maple flavors come thru as it rises to cellar temp. Close, but no cigars. This one has potential, if it had a bit more body"
"This brew pours a small head of light brown bubbles and a semi-transparent brown body. It has a very nice semi strong malt aroma and fizzy smoky harsh taste that is a little weak. Very nutty with only a fair lacing. Strange taste in this not really to my liking."
"Overall Impression: If you aren’t a big dark beer fan, this is probably a good introduction to heavier beers. Might be a good beer to start to educate your Coors Light drinking friends."
"Pours reddish-brown in color with an off-white head. Aroma consists of caramel malt, maple and grain. Mouthfeel is thinnish and somewhat watered down. Maple flavor is quite noticable in taste and adds a definite sweetness to the beer. Toasted malt and hints of nut add more dimension. Finish is somewhat husky and a bit dry at times. Not bad overall, but after a couple the sweetness becomes too much. Not a great session beer."
"This brown ale poured a creamy medium tan head with small-medium bubbles. There was some carbonation observed with this ale. There was very little lacing on the sides of my glass. The body was brown in color. I thought the taste was a little tart and bitey which I did not care for at all. I could not acquire a good taste for this brew."
"Pours a medium brown color with a decent off white head that shows very good retention and leaves a thick sheeting on the glass. From a distance, the maple syrup aroma is evident. Upon taking a deep whiff, the maple syrup note is more of a light brown sugar note atop a hint of malt. Not much of a hop prescence in the aroma. The taste is a bit funky and seems like two beers/beverages in one, sort of a Jekyll and Hyde of beers. There's a nice brown ale wanting to come out, but a friggin wine cooler keeps pushing him back in. The maple notes seem artificial and overlayed atop a nice nut brown ale. There's almost a tartness on the finish, with a bit of hop bittering. The mouthfeel is smooth, but nothing special. The drinakbility is a little poor, becuase I know there's a good beer under here, but it seems like they tried to do too much with the flavor. Good idea, bad result. Newcastle meets Bartles & James. Huh. And the labels look so nice. I need to learn to fight these impulse buys."
"Thin head that stayed around for a while. Color is dark brown, root beer like. Good lace. This bottle was labled ""enjoy with in 4 months of 12/02", it is now 5/03. Aroma is malt maple. Taste of chocolate, nut, maple, and malt with just a bit of hop. It could use a tiny bit more hoppiness. Fairly well balanced. Nice mellow aftertaste - it left me wanting another. Extreamly drinkable. I found it to be quite tasty and very enjoyable. I will purchase this one again."
"Color is a deep brownish gold, very little head produced. Smell was light, slight tones of roasted nut and caramel malts, molasses and maple notes, but is faint. Taste is good, smooth roasted sweetness and caramel malty, medium to light body, slight hint of maple or molasses, maybe some vanilla, chocolate malt as well. Good nut dryness and flavor. Not bad at all, I liked it quite a bit. Its a little light as far as feel, but drinkable."
"The beer starts with roasty toffee giving way to more rounded roasty malty. The finish has hints of chocolate and minimal hops. The aftertaste is nutty and fresh. I kind of like this beer. I didn't taste any maple, though."
"Pours a deep brown amber color with a thick and bubbly tan colored head that fades into a wispy lace with a heavy ring of bubbles around the walls of the glass. Nose is roasted malts and milk chocolate. Thin in body and a bit watery. Taste is sweet roasted chocolaty malts, light caramel, and maple syrup up front followed by a nutty pecan-like flavor. A touch of mild hops are present in the end, but the finish is dominated by malts. A decent brown ale but nothing special. A thicker mouthfeel would help this brew quite a bit."
"Not a bad beer overall, but I probably won't buy this one again as there are other nut ales that are much better (Sam Smith's Nut Brown Ale or Rogue Hazelnut for instance)."
"Drinkability: Only a few sips for this one. I will have to get another bottle and see if the results are better."
"I think I got an old one, this did not taste anything like what I was expecting. Pours a dark brown color with a medium beige and quickly dissipating head. Next to no lacing. Aroma is sweet and malty. Flavor was just way too sour, with a touch of sweetness that could have been caramel and could have been malt. Hard to tell though as the sourness dominated. Finish was kind of flat. I'll have to try this one again some time, it just seemed off."
"This beer poured a nice copper color with very little head. The taste was too watered down for a brown ale. I tasted a little bit of sweetness. A below average brown ale. I won't be drinking it again."
"Beer is a ruby brown in color.  Just a rimming of a head.  Aroma reminds me of autumn leaves.  Not bad, not good.  The taste of this beer is really weak.  Watered down.  This is what a good brown ale would taste like if it were diluted by a factor of 2.  I don't taste any maple notes either.  Below average beer.  No bad off flavors, but just watered down."
"Pours a dark caramel color with a small light tan head. The smell is pleasant although it is faint revealing roasted malt and caramel. The taste is quite nice with the caramel being the dominant flavor and a light roasted malt and pecans and a maple sweetness in the background. It has a very watery light-bodied mouthfeel. A thicker body could make this brew way better. Cheers!"
"Ruby red in color...flat looking and tasting...nice sweet nose with maple notes....tastes slick and sweet in the mouth....not as sweet as you'd expect...nice job on the maple syrup.  It is noticable, but not overdone...this goes down nicely...the sweetness is balanced by some toasty malts....pretty good beer overall....maybe a bit too sweet to drink a lot of, but worth trying from time to time...body was very flat.."
"I can't say I agree with most of the reviews on this one ( exept jromain,Indiana ) or im just missing it but......I found this beer best after you were done with it. It does leave a maple syrup mouthfeel long after your done. For me getting done was the hard part. Sweetness? Its dark chocolate roasted malts to me were on the bitter side, almost a citrus-sour.The date was good so maybe I was expecting something more.Perhaps ill give it another try someday, but for now im glad its done, thats when its best."
"Pours a dark amber brown with a large tan head that maintains well.  Fairly substantial carbonation with good lace.  Strong aroma of toasted malt with sweet and nutty notes.  Taste is dominated by the toasted malt, also has a curiously tart edge intermixed with the maltiness.  Towards the end of the taste, maple syrup and nut flavors become more pronounced.  An interesting beer, seems appropriate to fall and winter."
"Pours a nice dark, yet clear, reddish-brown.  Not much head.  Not much at all.  What head there is, dissipates oh so quickly.  Smell is the best thing about the beer.  It has a sweet, roasted nut aroma with hints of maple.  Taste is a bit thin and lacking, but certainly not unpleasant.  Flavor is nutty and sweet, with notes of roasted malt and maple syrup.  Mouthfeel is also pretty thin - rather watery.  Not a bad beer, that there are much better available."
"This brew pours with a deep dark copper color and quickly dissipating head.  The aroma is unmistakably malty with notes of dark malt and a hint of maple syrup.  The sweet nuttiness of the maple syrup and dark malts is immediately obvious, the maple flavor lingering through the finish.  I enjoyed this unique brew.  I think I will use it in a rib marinade later"
"Notes: No surprises, easy to drink though lackluster compared to other brown ales."
"a very sweet ale with hints of maple syrup and a nutty taste in the background.  medium body with the minimal hops drowned out by the sugary sweetness.  this should be a winter/holiday beer or a beer you would have with your pancakes for breakfast!"
