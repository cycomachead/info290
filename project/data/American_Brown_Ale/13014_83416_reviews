"Flavorful for sure, but too much going on all at once...never resolves.  Better the second time I tried.  Coffee nose.  Taste is initially coffee, then vanilla, then chocolate on the finish.  Tends to blur a bit though."

"Didn't get to spend as much time drinking this as I'd have liked to as I had to leave (on tap at LP Binny's), but this was quite a pleasant surprise, and definitely something worth seeking out if you're a coffee drinker. Surly continues to impress!"

"Overall, initially it was hard to find exactly how to differentiate Cacao Bender from Coffee Bender.  From the aroma alone it smells like walking to a Starbucks.  Straight up.  To say otherwise would be a stretch of the truth.  With warmth, the bittered cacao does begin to seep through the cracks of that coffee wall.  The taste, on the other hand, is much more amped up.  You get so much of that coffee, and it’s raw and black as ever, up front, but the kicker is that this is bolstered by equally as raw, dark, and bittering dark chocolate.  With each sip it dries you out a touch more, and clamps down just a little bit harder with that chalky, bittering puck.  Ultimately, the cacao doesn’t seem any more robust than the coffee, but together, and coming fresh off the tap, it is pure enjoyment."

"what a beautiful beer, less coffee intense than the coffee bender, but still plenty of it there both in nose and taste. also a whole lot of cocoa and vanilla, a cool mix, extremely aromatic in this brown ale that already exhibits properties of all three of these ingredients in its base form. short fizzy cream head here, medium brown full bodied beer. coffee first on the nose, but the aromatic vanilla is close in tow. the cacao is way more present in the taste, bitter, buttery, earthy, all in the finish over a nice dark chocolate malt base. its a fantastically well built beer, with great carbonation and a cleanness for how dark and flavorful it is. one of the best from surly, and probably honestly my favorite of the three versions i have had. coffee blends so well with the vanilla, where as in the coffee bender its almost too much, just iced coffee basically. this does a good job of being beer first. i love it, wish we got it all the time here!"

"Sadly Surly does not distribute to my home state of Pennsylvania. Or i'd be all over this one every week. Come to think of it, maybe it's a good thing they don't. :)"

"This is a terrific beer and exactly how breweries should use chocolate. This is a great balance of sweet and slightly bitter chocolate. Nice and deep dark brown with a thin, but long lasting cocoa colored head. The smell is slightly sweet at first, like a milk chocolate bar, but some dark cocoa and roasted malt notes come in stronger as it warms. Initially it tasted sweet, but in the back of the palate it becomes slightly bitter and roasty. It is silky smooth in body with moderately low carbonation. Really a top quality beer. Definitely worth seeking out."

"All in all, so impressed. The girl I was with was impressed enough to order her own, despite the fact this beer was the only beer not on happy hour special."

"Very interesting take on Coffee Bender; I think if they decreased the coffee contribution and let the other adjuncts shine even more, they would have an even bigger hit on their hands."
""
"Bender's never been my favorite of the Surly beers, so what Surly has done with this take on it is remarkable. Chocolate takes the lead, in fact this has more of a chocolate presence than most chocolate forward beers. A woody, grainy sensation follows. But it wasn't aged on wood? Well, it's in there anyway. More of a sipper than a slammer. Damn good brown ale."

"O: A fantastic beer. Roast flavors are mellowed (e.g. not burnt) and blend well with the cocoa. Wished it was always available and I lived in Minneapolis."

"Anyways, go to the taproom whenever this is on. If you like bender or coffee bender, this takes it to the next level."

"First time trying this one. On tap at the brewery. Had Moe's many times and all except the last time in which it was syrupy and cloying it was a superb beer that managed to be so flavorful at such a low ABV. Anyway this similar version to Moe (without the wood aging) is also a fantastic beer. Tons of flavor yet not filling and easy to drink multiples of. Rich cocoa powder flavor on top of the already solid coffee taste and the rich roasted malt backbone of Bender with a fair amount of vanilla to top it off...this is so tasty. The mouthfeel on this version is lighter than Moe's but still has a rich, silky mouthfeel upfront that quickly dissipates inviting that next drink. Similar to Moe's I would love to see Surly make more of either one of these beers. Just takes Coffee Bender to the next level. What a beer that is so flavorful yet very drinkable!"
"O - Delicious and better than their normal Bender."

"Overall: A pretty good chocolate beer. Has the big cocoa taste you would get from a big chocolate stout with a smaller body and lower abv. A good session chocolate brew."

"3.5/5"
"It sure would be nice to see them can this one not that it would do me any good. I don't get to Minnesota very often."

"Ever so slightly hazy chestnut brown. Served with a moderate sized light tan head. Copious lacing. Aroma is predominantly lightly roasted coffee with notes of toasty cocoa, chocolate and roasted peanuts. There is a hint of vanilla as well. Flavor is a bit thinner than the aroma. Dry cocoa, peanuts, slightly bitter coffee and a tiny bit of sourness. Medium mouthfeel, a bit thin for the style. Moderate bitterness."
