3.85,7.5,,,,,,"Bottle poured into a tulip glass. Nice look, Dark mahogany brown, nearly black, with orange-red highlights and around two fingers of rich creamy light tan head. Aroma is decidedly malty, light roast coffee and milk chocolate, caramels and lightly toasted breakfast cereal. Hops are low key on the nose but show up as a floral/woody undercurrent on the palate. Tastes like English hopping to me. I am getting ample caramel malts on the palate, which is sweet, mellow, and very smooth. Think less nutty and more ""black tea with sweetened condensed milk"". Dark fruit (raisins) and vanilla peek out from time to time. Any citrus from the Cascade hops is well masked. I am getting just a touch of burnt toast and singed grain late. Brown spices? Very cool. Little of the more aggressive hopping one can expect from American browns but this is not really a complaint. Low to moderate carbonation and the body has some heft without being thick or sticky. The finish is rather dry and roasted although the complex malt bill lingers through to the end and I do think that's a hint of gooseberry right there. There's the hops! Quite a solid brown ale that offers some interesting twists and turns. This brewery has yet to let me down. Perhaps it speaks to (a portion of) my roots.","CalgaryFMC","Aug 28, 2014"

3.73,4.2,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.75,"I was slightly anxious to get started, so my pour was nearly inverted, which does not work well when dealing with a bottle. Once things slowed down, a great pseudo-cascade took place, resulting in two fingers of dense, light-brown head with good retention. Color was a deep-brown with garnet highlights (SRM = > 27, < 34) and NE-quality clarity. Nose smelled of chocolate, coffee, tobacco and caramel. Mouthfeel was medium and it was not as sweet as I had girded myself for, based on the nose. It tasted more like cocoa than outright chocolate and the tobacco taste helped to also reduce some of the inherent sweetness of the style. Finish was semi-sweet and left me with an unusual dried tobacco flavor in my mouth. Not bad, but just not really my bag.","woodychandler","Jul 05, 2014"

The taste holds notes of light walnut, light dried maple syrup, mild toffee, and light toasted biscuit. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda watery feel.

3.43,-4.2,3.5,3,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours a clear but super dark brown with a 1/2 inch foamy khaki head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt and some nutty aromas. Not too much going on in the smell department unfortunately. Taste is of toasted and almost burnt malt, toasted nuts, and slight caramel flavors. There is a mild roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good brown ale with some nice toasty and roasty flavors.","UCLABrewN84","May 16, 2012"

2.55,-28.8,2.5,2.5,2.5,2,3,"Dark brown beer, ruby red at the edges when held up to light. Some lacing on the way down but not that much head after my pour. Smell is pretty faint, smells like malts and mollases. Tastes slightly sweet like maple syrup. Nutty. No hops to speak of. A thin mouthfeel with a dry finish and slightly chalky residue on the tongue. A below-average beer. Not hard to drink but not exceptional in any way, and I'm not a fan of the mouthfeel.","jar2574","May 03, 2012"

3.86,7.8,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"A towering head with nice lacing. Dark off white. Brew itself is clear and a dark cola. Smell sweet malt with a nice healthy breadiness. A good nutty character to the nose. Flavor has a nutty malt core with lots of roasted grains and a light sweetness, mostly Caramunich malt. Flavors of faint chocolate and coffee. The finish is dry and mostly earthy with a light leafy hop and oil lingering. A touch of bread and earthy hops as it fades. Feel is medium weight and a crisp tingly carbonation. A really good nut brown/American brown ale.","scootny","Apr 06, 2012"
3.98,11.2,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Dark chestnut in color with an amber hue and good clarity. Poured with a rich, light being foam that slowly dissipated. Sweet dark and toasted malt aromas with hints of brown sugar, molasses and dark fruit. Medium bodied with rich, aggressive carbonation. Caramel and toasted malt flavors up front followed by ripe fruit and molasses. Malt and fruit flavors fade in the middle giving way to a brief nuttiness that immediately transitions to lightly bitter floral hoppiness that carries through to the end. Finishes semi-dry with a dark molasses and light bitter hop aftertaste. Overall this has nice character and was on the sweet side.","IronLover","Mar 15, 2012"
3.5,-2.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Served from tap into a sampler shaker. Poured a reddish brown with a half finger khaki colored head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. There was no lacing evident throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, grape, and fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, grape, fruit, and apple. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. I have to be honest that I was quite hesitant on this one as I have not found a Hebrew beer that I like yet. So I was a little afraid to try this one. However, this one wasn’t too bad. I think they made a good move making this one so simple as I think that’s where they lose me on their other brews I’ve had. This one was easy to drink, which was a nice change. Worth trying if you get the opportunity.","thagr81us","Beers"
3.68,2.8,4,3.5,4,3,3.5,"Malty aroma has caramel and fruity notes and a hint of molasses. It pours a dark, slightly hazy cola brown with a fairly thick, fine-bubbled, pale beige head. Mouth-filling flavor has a malty core and caramel, nutty and apple tones plus a hint of - cola? Rather tasty and enjoyable. Smooth texture has average fizz and body. Worth a try.","Cyberkedi","0"
