3.57,3.2,3,3.5,3.5,4,3.75,"Very smooth.  Very different from anything I had before.  The color looked like a standard brown ale and there wasn't a really distinct smell from what I could gather.  Taste wasn't bad, but isn't something I would crave a lot.  Good beer to mix it up with, but not something I would consistently buy.  Worth buying if you want to try something unique.","513BeerLover","Mar 04, 2015"

3.53,2,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.25," The flavor is a mix of woody hops with raisin-like taste from the malt and yeast mixing with a strange herbal element that comes of as nutty and slightly earthy with subtle fig-like aspect which is more like dark toffee but not that sweet. The flavor has a mild yeast taste I can't place or perhaps it is the hemp. Overall I like this but would probably not get this again, there are many brown ales I prefer to this in the same abv range.","Slatetank","Apr 29, 2014"

Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, biscuit, light chocolate, light nuttiness, herbal, floral, and toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark malt and light hop/hemp notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, brown sugar, light chocolate, light nuttiness, herbal, floral, and toasted earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, brown sugar, light chocolate, light nuttiness, herbal, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a bit. Nice balance and robustness of dark malt flavors with light hop/hemp presence; with no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy and smooth mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice brown ale. Good balance and robustness of dark malt flavors and very smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 03, 2014"

Appearance: dark brown body with a monstrous brown two-finger head that foams significantly--welcoming!... Aroma: lightly toasted, brightly hopped--a bit of mild sweetness too... Palate: smooth--too smooth?--with mild effervescence late, and little more... Taste: quite mild and unassuming--mellow to the point of nondescription; I recall having a Hempen Ale and wondering the similar thought--hemp doesn't seem to alter much... Overall: a pleasant, easy-drinking brew that has little in its complexity (it is a brown, after all), and yet its promise to be anomalous doesn't quite pan out....but for its price point, about right.","dacrza1","Jun 10, 2013"

The top note still has that classic brown ale flavor, but it dissipates into a very smooth, refreshing middle, leaving an equally refreshing aftertaste.

Roasted malts, slight cocoa and coffee flavors mix well together. Earthy taste to it, with a bit of spice dotted here and there. The spice comes out a little more at the end with a decent hop bitterness. Not sure what the spice is, but meshed well with the other flavors to create an enjoyable beer for sure.

Caramel malts give it a balanced sweetness up front while the breadiness comes through in the back end mostly, giving it a full body, almost too full for the style. A little bit of spiciness, probably from the hemp, adds a bit of character to a sort of bland brown ale. Somewhat creamy in the feel in the back, but tingly on the top of the tongue. Definitely leaves and unwanted and lingering mouthfeel that actually makes the experience much less enjoyable. It seems to be the main problem with a decent beer, definitely docking points in my book. Overall, I probably wouldn't buy this again, but worth a try.","chodinheaven","Beers"

Taste is of roasted malt, roasted nuts, cocoa powder, and slight coffee beans. A nice roasty bitterness lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with some nice roasty and earthy flavors.

True to the American Brown Ale style, this is a richly malty beer. You get a nice blend of chocolate and caramel malts that play nicely with the toasty quality that the hemp seeds add to the beer. On the swallow you get a snap of hops that lingers throughout the drink. Overall, this is a sturdy brown ale.","jmvecchio1","Jun 27, 2011"
3.65,5.5,3.5,3.5,4,3,3.5,"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a dark slightly red brown that was slightly translucent. A one finger bubbly head appeared that didn't cling, and only lasted for a few moments. Aroma was a tad acidic, with definite hints of a milk chocolate, and a tad of brown wheat bread. Taste was slightly sweet, hint of lactose and burnt dark chocolate. Finished with a roasted flavor in the mouth. Felt ok in the mouth, tingled the tongue a bit much for my liking. Coated well but just felt a little thin at time, with just a tad of carbonation could be felt. Overall a reasonable brown. Fairly solid middle of the road.","mountdew1","Jun 23, 2011"

Lingering toasted malts in the aftertaste, dry but fairly pleasant. Whatever hemp seed is in here, it doesn't lend much, some woody/earthy flavors perhaps, but it would be hard to pick out and isolate from the dominant malt flavors.

However it was on sale and a closer look revealed it was infact a brown ale and not the pale ale one might think of with a green cardboard cutout. So since I usually like browns I decided to try it out. Looked pretty thin, not a lot of head on the beer. Slight hempness smell though not like the weed smell you get from some green bottles- more of a foresty smell. Flavor was not good and not bad- just rather lacking.

The nose has a casual softness to it, mocha, cocoa, molasses and cinnamon, ginger spice, spiced orange peel, then a moss, herbal element which one assumes is hemp derived, abbreviated burst of apricot and peach scents, there's a mineral water to tonic water component which lends additional stiffness to its posture. Medium-bodied, chocolate, caramel and butterscotch first into the pool, albeit not in a very sweet manner, more cinnamon and nutmeg, more like a cake than pie, perhaps due to the quiet peach, apple, apricot fruit. Raw Brazil nuts. The lemon, orange citrus dryish and more pulp than peel. Same minerally, earthy "organic" character to it, brings freshness but not flavor.

The feel is light to moderate with pleny of fizzy carbonation; sweet to start but finishes slightly tart. Too much of a lemony tea characteristic to this brew for a brown ale.

Really full of flavors that develop as you work your way down the beer. I would say this is as close as you will get to a Herbal/Spiced Red Ale.
