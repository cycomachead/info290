"O: this bottled version blew the draft version I had at the brewpub out of the water!... I got a celery/parsley green flavor in that - not here from the bottle - just nutty, bittersweet, malty loveliness... just about everything one could want and what should be in an American Brown Ale - nice work, Flossy!"

"Had on tap at Monk's. Good coffee and chocolate notes, some toffee and nut character as well. Very enticing. The taste offered more of the same, plus an almost salty flavor that at first seemed out of place. The salt-like flavor mellowed and there was just a tasty and well malted brown ale. This one hits right where I like brown ales: smooth, creamy, almost a bit chewy, with a dry finish. Really solid beer."

"Super dark brown with a tan head. Wasn't the best pour so I can't really say much about it. Pretty darn roasty, sweet, and malty in both the nose and flavor. Slightly woody and chocolaty. Easy drinking and tons of flavor. Big fan of this."

"o - now this is one of the best brown ales i've ever had. it may be the best. so flavorful and rich and the mouthfeel is as good as it gets."
"Though not as hop-forward as Dogfish Head's India Brown Ale (IBA) but not as English-y as Avery Ellie's Brown Ale, the beer is crying out for a pairing of savory meat loaf with red-eye gravy. Do yourself a favor...."

"O- Pretty impressed. Bet it would be better on draft. Love the rich, dark, molasses flavors that really come out as this one warmed up."
""
""
"Overall: This is a pretty darn good brown ale. Some small tweets with maltyness could really make this beer great."

"This is top notch in the style. Real robust nose and taste with an incredible mouthfeel that makes this one drink bigger than it really is. I can see why this beer is the winningest offering from Flossmoor."
"M: Medium bodied. But on the lighter side."

"O - A very nice beer with great smoothness and not harsh to taste, after taste, and is not heavy at all."
""
""
"O: I like this beer better from a growler than on tap or from a bomber. The carbonic bite dies down and allows the malt to come forward and showcase the complexity of the beer."

"overall – a great brown, seriously complex."

"22oz. bottle courtesy of 2BDChicago and the never-ending SS BIF box. Served in my SA Perfect Pint. Recipe No. 128 indicated on the label. Pours 90% head to start - off-white/tan, dense and frothy. As the head recedes, a chestnut hued body is revealed with ruby red highlights evident when backlit. Thick, textured swaths of lacing are exposed as the head slowly recedes. Nose is malty with a slight nuttiness and a suggestion of artificial sweetener and lactose. Taste is fantastic - malty, molasses and a pleasant roasted character - extremely flavorful without being overly thick or cloying; however, there is a residual lactose/artificial sweetener character that lingers at the finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a mild, even carbonation and silky/creamy texture. Overall, I have to say that this is one of the best American Brown Ales I've had the opportunity to try, falling somewhere between a brown and a Porter in my opinion. A top notch beer that demonstrates that a high abv is not necessary to impart flavor."
"O- I thought the smell and flavor would redeem the beer, but the mouthful is weak. A bit disappointed with this one."
"O: Nice brown ale. Well balanced flavors compliment each other. Minimal bitterness. Quite drinkable - wouldn't mind a couple glasses of this."
""
""
"O: This is only the second brew I've had by Flossmoor Station and it won't be the last. Great stuff!"
""
"Pours a Dark brown with a vibrant dark tan head. Smells of malt, sweetness (molasses) and roasted malt. Taste is great a smooth sweetness with a nice hop balance one of the best brown ales I've tried. Thanks Bashiba for the recemadation. I will have to pick up more of these and others fro Flossmor."

"O: A really nice, higher gravity brown ale with big chocolate presence and an overall sweet flavor profile."
"22 ounce bottle for $6.49. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours dark brown with a huge tan head. Pretty much as soon as I poured the beer into the glass, it started bubbling up like crazy, and it took a while for the head to settle down enough for me to pour a somewhat full glass. Aroma is nice and malty, it smells like molasses, chocolate, brown sugar and some coffee. The taste is similar to the aroma, but there's the addition of a nutty flavor. Also, I think the roasty coffee flavor comes out stronger in the finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick but has way too much carbonation. I'm not sure if this is a bad bottle or not, but at least the taste wasn't affected. Other than the high carbonation, I think it's a good brew. I'd try this again in the future."
"O: This is a seriously hefty brown ale. I like it... but I don't love it. Something is missing, and I can't put my finger on it."
"This pours a deep cola brown color with a very fast fading ebony head that doesn't leave much retention. Pretty thick looking brown ale. Smells of sweet malts, hazlenut, as well as some espresso and chocolate. Taste is very smooth. Nice creamy texture with more chocolate on the palate. Nice sweet malt finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and not much carbonation. Overall I really enjoyed this brown ale. Very enjoyable."
"Mouthfeel is enlivened by carbonation, but overall slippery/oily with a drying alcohol finish."
"Best American brown I've had."
"Mouthfeel is a little dry and chalky, nicely light. Overall, this is quite good."
"This is a very Porter-like brown ale and one I would love to have again."
"I really enjoyed this beer. It's so readily available for me that I've always taken it for granted and passed on it. It so happened it was on sale and I had gift cards to burn so it made perfect sense. I'll definitely be buying this again."
"D/O: While brown ales are not especially popular as a style, this gem could make a believer out of anyone not deathly allergic to sweeter beers. The flavors are dynamic yet traditional, starting like dessert but finishing in respectable English style. It is Comfort Beer, able to scratch the dark beer itch with ease, not at all limited by its style."
"Another beer where the smell promises things the taste doesn't deliver. Pretty good, but the flavor is rather simple and one-dimensional."
"O: drinkable, but kind of heavy for a 6%. Nothing wrong with that, since that's how a decent brown should feel. I'd do it again - didn't even know this existed before it was shared with me."
"This is a dark, dark brown beer with a large, compact, very dense head, over an inch thick (poured into an English pint glass). The nose provides a nice rich caramel aroma, with a dash of roastiness and a touch of hops. The flavor offers plenty of black patent cocoa flavor, moderately roasted, with dark chocolate notes. Hop bitterness is moderate, but increases throughout to dry out the finish substantially. Lightly fruity yeast character. Body is, perhaps, a tad thin. But otherwise, a solid offering."
"A bit light in the mouthfeel but very easy to enjoy. No notice of alcohol at all. Excellent offering."
"I like this beer. Probably the best year round offering from Flossmoor, hands down. I would drink again without a complaint."
"Let me start by saying this is a very good beer. However, I don't know where the Brown label is. It seems more a porter or stout. Enough with semantics. The beer dark almost black with a frothy brown head. The smell is chalky dark chocolate - good. The taste is bitter chocolate with a hickory smokiness. Good beer for a porter. It's just not a (sweet) brown which is what I wanted. Pullman porter sounds better anyway, right?"
"The reveal: Pullman Brown Ale. Awesome! A solid american version of an English brown, and a want as this is from my book project."
"O - This was a pretty nice brown ale. Really a great sessionable brew."
"Cheers!"
"O- A pretty good brown ale, loads of flavor and very drinkable."
"O: For some reason, I've always steered clear of this beer, instead choosing to focus on Flossmoor's IPAs, but that was a mistake. This is probably as good as you're going to find for the style. Very impressive."
"O- Wow this is a really good beer. Highly recommend this one to anyone."
"O: A really great brown ale. I like the bitter chocolates and coffee and the molasses really comes through to make it a great lounging around on a cold night (or morning!) beer."
"Overall a very interesting and flavorful brown ale. The intense charred dark grain grain presents a porter-like character. However the finish is sweet and woody like a brown ale."
"Easily one of the best brown ales I have ever had. Great Beer!"
"A friend of mine, who runs a liquor store, got this in fresh a few weeks ago. Unfortunately, compared to some barrel-aged brews I've run into, lately, this one is ever-so-slightly deficient. Compared to other molasses/coffee influenced brews I've tried in the past, however, this one stands out like a champion! The color: dark. The head: not so thick, but nice lacing. The smell: rich. The taste: malty sweet upfront, slightly bitter carmel after. Mouthfeel: luxuriant. Overall: nothing wrong with this one. Would love to try it on tap. Very drinkable and not over-the-top ABV or IBUs."
"O: This is a very drinkable brew, and replete with some interesting dynamics."
"Overall this beer is a large disappointment. Flavors are just not balanced and the lingering odd aftertaste it quite horrendous. It gets worse as it warms as well."
"overall: I want to put vanilla ice cream in it and make it into a float. Really wonderful as a dessert, feels like a good fall or winter beer."
"Mouthfeel is more sticky and thick than your average brown ale, and it might be too much for some, but I happen to enjoy it. The molasses is very imposing in terms of taste and mouthfeel, and it can get a bit much. Drinkability is harmed a great deal by the metal and uneven alcohol strength/molasses. This beer could be so much better that it's disappointing to point out its shortcomings. I feel bad giving this such a low score since I can see how good it could be, but I couldn't get through too much of this beer (thanks to AwYeh for jumping in to finish the job)."
"O: Overall, a good beer- the metallic flavor hurts it a bit (and I try to review both to style and a C average, which makes things worse for Pullman Brown Ale), but if you're reading this review and considering buying it, maybe you'll be more sympathetic regarding the metal flavor."
"Try if you can."
"To me the best of the dark beer I've had at the flossmoor station. A pretty solid choice from the menu for sure."
"d - I thought this was a very good brown ale; one of the better ones I've had. Would love to have again."
"Drinkable stuff."
"Beer is a little thin, surprisingly, and has this kind of late lingering bitterness from the roast. It is not unpleasant. The lead off here is the sweetness, giving way to a vacant midpalate and some nice bitterness / coffee / roast at the end of palate. it tastes good but I think a lot more could have been done ot connect the palate throughout."
"D - Very drinkable brew, nice malty brew with a good blend of Molasses, caramel and coffee. I recommend this brew and will have it again!"
"My first beer of the day, first ever from the Station, and the beginning of my Kapowski Day adventure in Flossmoor. Slick burnt sienna roars into the glass, a finger of ecru foam recalling the steam at trainstops of yore. The air abounds with light maple syrup, cedar, brown sugar, and a soft breeze of roasted malts. Maybe it's this air, maybe it's the beer running into my mouth (it's hard to tell sometimes), but I can distinctly taste brown sugar, roasted malts, light maple syrup, light molasses, and a brief fling with oak. Okay, I figured it out: It was the beer, which went down nicely thanks to a medium body and a light moderate carbonation. While I watched the Fighting Sioux get taken down by the Gophers on ice, I didn't want to put this one down. Things are boding well for this day at the brewpub."
"3.5/3.5/4/4/4"
"D: this was more of a porter to me. A good porter, but undercarbonated."
"Overall a good brown ale with lots of malt charachter and chewyness."
"Pours a moderately-deep brown with a light tan head. Mild lacing and pretty good retention. The nose brings some light cocoa and molasses plus a bit of brown sugar and toasted bread. The taste is some roast and bread plus a bit of chocolate. Fairly plain, but backed up by a nice body. A good brown that I'd have another of."
"This beer was pitch black with a small light brown head and nice enough lacing. The nose is very chocolatey, and the taste has a great complexity--I got notes of chocolate, of woodsy toasted nuts, of molasses, maybe a little bit of coffee, with a very hoppy and somewhat bitter end. The two people I allowed to take sips both immediately proclaimed it too bitter, but I thought it was a great beer--a very complex, delightfully drinkable American brown."
"Pretty solid overall; I just think it would be more enjoyable if the taste could mimic the excellence of the aroma. All in all it seems to be pushing hoppy porter/stout territory, but no matter..."
"D- I liked this beer but it wasnt a memorable experience. Ive still got to give a thanks to Ryan for bringing this one back from Chicago with me in mind."
"D: Overall, I feel like this beer was a little bit more like a porter than a brown ale. With that being said it is very balanced, interesting, and very drinkable."
"Drinkability: Not sure where this beer should be classified, but it is a first rate beer whatever style you want to call it"
"If your looking for the usual nutty Brown Ale I wouldnt choose this beer but if you want a mix between Stout and Brown Ale this is your beer!"
"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side for the style and carbonation is moderate to slightly below average. Drinkability is good, it had some great flavors to it and was also pretty balanced and complex at the same time. It almost seemed like they mixed a stout and brown ale and managed to show some of the nice characteristics of both."
"Tasty enough, and certainly substantial for a brown ale. I'd like to see where this one would go in a bourbon barrel."
"Pours a black color. 1/5 inch head of a tan color. Slight retention and slight lacing. Smells of alcohol, hops, roasted malt, sweet malt, slight oatmeal, and slight yeast. Fits the style of an American Brown Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of roasted malt, hint of coffee, alcohol, hint of sweet malt, and slight wood. Overall, good aroma, body, and blend."
"A very nice brown ale that borders on being a porter. Big and ballsy for a brown. Worth a try in my book."
"A really nice brown ale with lots of coffee."
"Great beer.... Hope to get my hands on some more sometime."
"Appearance is a dark brown, slight off-white tan head. Smells are coffee, nutty and some caramel. Tastes are malt, roasted nuts, some sweetness with a somewhat bitter finish. Medium bodied with the right amount of carbonation. Good beer."
"Poured a viscous, deep brown (bordering on black) colour, opaque in the body with a tinge of red around the edges. Head was creamy and frothy, and tan in colour. Minimal lacing, but the retention on this was phenomenal, kept a solid half finger of head on this throughout. Just gorgeous. Aroma is nice too, bouquet of milk chocolate, caramel, molasses, sweet and rich malts. Taste starts with the rich warm malt base striking the tongue initially, then coating the tongue with a fairly simple and delicious combination of molasses, caramel, toffee and a touch of coffee. Mouthfeel is full, low carbonation and a smooth, creamy finish. Bit of bitterness at the end of each sip, but the IBU's on this are only low 30's from what I can recall from the bottle. Excellent beer, drinkability is brought down a notch by the fullness I experienced drinking this beer, 22oz may be a bit much for myself but to each his own!"
"4.5 D: Definitely enjoyed this one quite a bit. Right up there with some of the best browns I've had."
"Pours an opaque brown with a thick tan head and lots of lacing. Smell has this roasted nuttiness to go with sweet molasses, brown sugar and a faint hint of chocolate. This is incredibly complex for a brown ale. It is very sweet, but also has a great nutty flavour that you would expect with a brown ale. Very creamy mouthfeel. At 6% abv, they packed in a ton of flavour into this. If I lived in Chicago, I could see myself drinking this often."
"Drinkability -- Way more depth of flavor than you are likely to find in any other brown ale with 6% abv. I have a hard time believing I'm going to find a brown ale I'll like more than this. Outstanding!"
"D - Drinkability is really high for me. The flavors are bold and delicious. This is my kind of BIG brown ale!"
"3.5/4/4/4/4"
"Overall, a very enjoyable beer. Great for the style. Drinkable."
"D: This went great with my burrito or pizza. Enough flavor to go well with a heartier meal as well. Light enough that it would be a great session beer. I picked up 3 bottles to take home with me and regretting I didn't have room for more."
"nice low ABV, huge complexity, and great flavor make this quite easy to drink. this blew my expectations away."
"D - Easy to drink, could actually session this surprisingly."
"Get down like Buck Rodgers!"
"Great drinkability--well balanced and very flavorful. Seems to have more of the characteristics of a porter than a brown ale."
"Flossmoor has put out a pretty solid lineup, but I think I will pass on picking up this one again unless it is super cheap. It's already reasonably affordable, so no complaints there. I think I'll stick to their IPAs and just ogle my last bottle of Wooden Hell."
"Overall: I debated as to whether i should review it or not but i've seen a few reviews describing similar experiences so i figure it's good for people to see both sides of the coin. Still, i do want to try it again, maybe on tap it'll be better. The bottle is killer though!"
"Pours a dark brown (what are the chances), with small head which leaves little lace. Wow, this beer smells good: molasses, brown sugar, and lots of other deliciousness. A nice balance of sweetness, and very enjoyable. I wish this beer was a little thicker in the mouthfeel. More malt perhaps? A nice beer to enjoy as we wind down the past decade and one I look forward to having again. Cheers!"
"Damn, is all I can say. Not usually much of a fan of the style, but this is just excellent."
"Browns are among my favorite styles but this isn't one that I'd recommend. The taste reminded me more of a porter, the flavor was bitter and astringent and it had little fullness of flavor. This was a bad combination of a harsh scent and a medicinal taste."
"Overall, possibly my new favorite brown ale. I really liked this one and probably could have polished off another bomber after the first if I had another...try it if you can."
"D: Damn good. A real fine brown ale."
"for all intents and purposes i can't bring myself to accept this as a brown ale. it's just too roasty and substantial, regardless of its 6%. to be quite honest nothing about it is brownalelike. to be honest, i'm not sure i buy the 6%. as mentioned above i think i detect a little heat, and then there's the less tangible buzz test: it ""feels"" like more than 6%"
"D - Really tasty stuff here with more flavor than your average brown ale. Pullman has a lot going on, including plenty of bittersweet character and a nice chocolate presence as well."
"Tastes alright, way too foamy and tough to drink."
"Thanks Jon for bringing this one back. A malty brown, not too sweet, with some chocolate and cocunt. Nice foamy head. Above average mouthfeel, somewhat complex. Hits the style, toasty nutty, the mollasses, and appropriate carbonation. Fresh enough, but very little sense of the hops."
"With more malt, Pullman Brown Ale would be one of the best American brown ales to have ever entered my glass. As is, it's pretty damn delicious and just does earn the higher flavor score. I do believe that this is my favorite Flossmoor Station beer to date. Great job Bryan."
"Pours a very nice clean/clear deep brown color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy tan head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some chocolate, toffee, roast. The taste is very nice, malty, sweet, with very nice notes of chocolate, toffee, with some roastyness. Medium body. Very drinkable, one of the best American Brown Ale's I've had to date."
"Great brew, no, outstanding brew. I really could not find any flaws, this is one that I will brag to my friends about tomorrow."
"D - The low ABV makes this pretty easy going, but the fierce bitter roastiness and high carbonation are turning me off. Perhaps this bottle is too old (still has Matt Van Wyck on the label,although that doesn't mean a ton as god knows how many bottles were pre-made before he left), but there's a huge disconnect between the smell and the taste/feel. I'll still finish this bomber, but I may have to try this on-tap to make sure that this is what Flossmoor intended."
"Overall this was damn good. I was actually more then impressed here, dare I say nearly blown away by how solid this one was. I would have no issue at all with grabbing for this one again, in fact I am looking forward to it."
"D: Just about as good as I remember, though perhaps I've been spoiled recently by some of Flossmoor's more daring beers. However, this beer still stands the test of time, a unique american brown with loads of complexity and a wonderful taste and feel to boot. Flossmoor is easily becoming one of my favorite breweries."
"Really good. Got to be tough to do a molasses brown. Got this bottle at Sam's in Chicago a few months ago. Poured with a medium, tan head and a little lace. Color is an opaque dark brown. Aroma is very interesting: a brown with molasses, strange but they made it work. Also some chocolate, nuts, toffee, cocoa, dark fruits, and something else I can't place. Flav's the same. Pat says it reminds him of his grandma's molasses cookies. Nice finish. Good body and carbonation."
"Superb beer. Picked up a couple of bottles for the flight home & will be happy to have them over the next month or so. Now am very sad that we missed the IPA tapping by a single day"
"D- This is not my cup of tea but like I said earlier I rate on style not personal style. If I was into this I would gladly make another trip to the growler for a refill. Glad I split this with someone who likes their browns!"
"HV"
"Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with just the right level of carbonation. This makes it a thoroughly drinkable and enjoyable brew and one that I shall return to time and time again."
"Dark brown, almost black, but still lets a little light through. There's a nice 1-2cm head, tan colored, sitting on top. It leaves a little lacing, and remains as a nice ring throughout. A little darker than expected, but overall, about average looking. The smell is of sweet chocolate, with a hint of cola. There is also a smell of earthy, slightly herbal hops. There are notes of roasted malts as well - coffee, etc. The molasses isn't present in the nose much. The smell overall is very rich and interesting - with all of the usual suspects present. The taste is really nice. Upfront, there is quite a taste of bittersweet chocolate. There's a nice sweet and bready malt presence paired with a beautiful earthy hop presence. Also, a a floral hint in the finish. There's a slight taste of tobacco, and a nice lingering taste of molasses in the finish. The flavor of coffee and cola comes and goes in different stages. Everything is in there, in quite a nice balance, and is really enjoyable and rich. This is a very nice brown ale. Full-bodied and sweet - I'm not big on dryness is darker beers. The carbonation was pleasant - about low-medium which provides a prickle with no sting. I really enjoyed the drink - but maybe 1-2 would be enough for me. The flavors are all really enjoyable, and though the house beers don't get the hype (the IPA gets the most attention here), this is one worth visiting."
"At a future date, I'll have to try this again, but at this point I am not impressed."
"While the carbonation eventually comes on, it almost starts flat on my tongue. Other than that, it's undeniably drinkable and one I'll be sure to revisit."
"I'm pleasantly surprised with my first Flossmoor sample. It drinks closer to a porter than a brown ale IMHO."
"Pours a dark drown with a fizzy mocha head. Nose has lots of roasty malts, nutty grains, chocolate, coffee and molasses. Taste is also quite malty, but well balanced by the bitter molasses and cocao. A hint of hops in the finish. Medium body is well carbonated. Nice example of the style."
"This was a darker brown style. It was nearly black with a brown head. The smell was of a small hop aroma, perhaps an English Hop? But also you could detect a distinctive roasted character in the aroma. The roast character did dominate the taste too, but there was a definite cideryness, that would be most likely caused by the molasses. The cidery character was not unpleasant, but perhaps a tiny bit unusual. Finished roasty, it seemed definitely black-patent for the malt. This is a good beer, it really pushes the envelope of the style and broadens the drinkers' perspectives."
"d: overall this is a solid brew, but the finish was not enjoyable"
"I had a better thought out review that my browser ate."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, very light carbonation. Silky."
"Wow, another staple Flossmoor beer that took me a little by surprise. I love the roasted nature of this, as it gave the profile a level of flavor that I'm not used to in Brown Ales, being almost Porterish at times. Full flavored and hugely drinkable, bottles of this would probably be a staple in my fridge if I could get it locally."
"Pours a dark brown color with 1/2 finger of tan head. Good retention and some lacing. Smells of caramel, toffee, roasted malt, chocolate, and citrus. Tastes of chalk, chocolate malts, caramel, toffee, roasted malts, and coffee with a bitter citrus peel finish. Medium in body with good carbonation. A little minerally and chalky, but overall pretty good, seems almost more porter-like than a brown ale. Another nice brew from Flossmoor Station, quite enjoyable."
"Well, this is one of the best brown ales I've ever tasted. Flossmoor continues to impress and this is no exception. Fantastic brew."
"Contrary to most BAs, who shy away from giving Perfect Scores to the beers they review here, this offering from Flossmoor Station is Perfection in a bottle. I have shied away from Flossmoor Station only because 22 ounce bombers are harder to put away (drink solo) than a 12 ounce brew. But I was in good company on Easter Weekend in Chicagoland -- brother in law and nephew, both former Macro drinkers, now Craft Beer enthusiasts, who I gladly converted. So when my brother in law pulled this beauty from his fridge to present to me as a gift, I said let's split it three ways and wow, what a magical experience that was. We sipped, smelled, let sit, then smelled, sipped and did that over and over again. The taste of dark, unsweetened coffee, like espresso, hit our palates, a silky smoothie, pure decadence are just some words to describe the one-hour of beer bliss. I can see why my nephew ""dreams"" about this beer. It is heavenly. I have a bottle in my beer fridge but will wait for the perfect occasion to enjoy."
"the flavor caught me off guard and i had to keep checking the label to make sure this wasn't listed as an old timey porter... chocolate, ample amounts of roasty coffee, brown sugar, chocolate, ash, a touch of sourness similar to coffee and a plethora of floral hops on the finish which linger into the aftertaste to mix with coffee. the medium body leans on full but is in no way sweet or sticky. it's very smooth and creamy yet a nice balance is made from ash and roasty bitterness. there's something very familiar and comforting in this brew...8/4/8/5/18/4.3"
"Served on tap in a 12oz glass about 7 miles from the brewery. Very dark for the style with a rich, chocalatey aroma. Creamy, thick tan head. A heavy beer with an initial sweetness that gives way to lingering bitterness. Leaves an equally strong maltiness with flavors of smoke and coffee. Pretty big for a brown ale. I've definately tasted Porters that were not as dark and heavy."
"Pours with a small tight brown head. Dark opaque brown color. Aroma is milk chocolatey, slightly smoky. Starts with sweet chocolate mocha flavors, becoming roasty and somewhat coffeeish. Seems a bit darker and roastier than expected for a brown ale. Hint of burnt bitter molasses in the finish. Medium body. Alcohol is quite moderate and sweetness is pleasant, not cloying."
"I am typically not a fan of brown ales but this one was delicious."
"D: Could drink this one over and over again. Works as a one timer or a bit of a session. A great american brown ale."
"drinkability is good. a smooth and robust brew that is more of a porter than a brown ale, there is a dark malt complexity here that is quite nice, making this one of the better brews from Flossmoor. cheers!"
"drinkability: good"
"D - Tires me easily."
"D - This is more of a sipping beer maybe one or two and not something I would drink a case of during a ballgame."
"Interesting brew from Flossmoor. Not my favorite style, but this was enjoyable. Complex."
"Body pours to a blackest brown that it can be. Hosts a thick creamy inch and a half head that is dark tan in color with excellent retention. Nose has an almost burning invigoration of roasted malt, smokey alchol and paint. Tons of rich toasty malt enter the mouth with a very creamy filling feel. An even biscuit like sweetness is whole and pleasant on the tongue. In the middle of the sweetness is a dose of molasses that keeps the mouthfeel quite thick. This beer is a very enjoyable brew to drink."
"I think this is a tremendous beer, and hopefully can get plenty more my next trip to Chicago."
"Thanks again, Joe!"
"Bottom line: Here's a nice American style Brown Ale that's plenty tasty, has a good mouthfeel, is easy drinking, and looks good in the glass. A solid example of the style."
"There aren't many brown ales I particularly enjoy, but I found this one to be very drinkable and quite tasty. It's not extraordinary, but for a brown ale it's damn good."
"The dirnkability is fine if a toast brown is you thing give it a try. Prosit, MK"
"Drinkability - fantastic session beer alone or with a hearty meal."
"Had this brew on tap at Flossmoor. Pours dark brown with a light tan head. Smell is nutty, and coffee like and taste is chalky, nutty, and lightly of coffee. Bit thin body and flavorwise, but otherwise a good, drinkable brown ale. Didn't knock my socks off, however."
"Pours a very rich molasses brown with a tan head hat is fleeting at best. The aroma is a bronwnie sweet cream with som bitter burnt malts and a touch of rye like hops. The taste has sweet and bitter malts. The molasses mingles very well ith such a deep roasted to burnt malt bill with good hop balancing. Makes me thnk of sweet mocha brownies with adash of grapefruit rinds jumping aroun. Adding a spicey note to the mix. A dark sweet mix with lots of chocolates and coffee flavors moving around your palate. Taste like its almost a sipping beer, but lower in abv."
"Tasted on 4/30/08."
"D- pretty awesome beer"
"Drinkability - Is fantastic! Super smooth! Drinks more like a hoppy porter (as mentioned in a prior review). Reminded me of Surly Bender in some ways. Glad to have this available in my area! Recommended!"
"Poured from a silk screened bomber I got at Flossmoor Station a few weeks ago. Pours an opaque deep brown with cola colored edges. The dark tan head slowly dissipates into a mocha tinged ring around the glass leaving little to no lacing. A deep inhalation brings coffe, a little chocolate and the molasses to the front. A taste and you know why the smell of molasses stands out. The taste does as well but not in a bad way. The bitter chocolate compliments the sweet molasses to make for a complex yet enjoyable palate. The mouthfeel is what gets me. I'm not a fan of the bitter aftertaste. It's not overwhelming but it's there. Know what I mean??? Pretty drinkable. Share with a friend."
"D: Incredible! I've found my new, locally made, go to Brown Ale. 6% means this is sessionable, as well."
"Very dark brown with almost no head. Scent of molasses with brown sugar, coffee, and a bit of almond. Initial taste of almonds with a hint of cocoa and molasses, brown sugar and roasted coffee beans round this one out. Mouthfeel is clean, a little thick with a soft bite, very nice. Very drinkable, goes down nice and easy."
"Drinkability- Well this thing turned out to be pretty tasty. I'm not the most experienced Brown drinker on earth but I definitely like this brew. It's nicely balanced and really drinkable Flossmoor really has something here. Great brew and I can't wait to visit the brewpub!"
"A good winter beer."
"Freshly tapped at my house, poured into a standard pint glass. The brew fills the glass a very dark brown color with a finger of head that settles to a small head over top with a mild carbonation in there. This brew is nice and dark, but light comes through at the top around the lip. The aroma is roast with a solid brown sugar, toasted nut and chocolate. The smells are moderate in force, but well blended and nice for the style. The flavor hits first with a solid roast that moves to a nice nutty quality, quickly transitioning to milk chocolate and finishing with a moderate pine hop that gives a light impression of coffee and a mild to moderate bite on the finish. This one hits all the notes I want in a brown. It has a robust flavor with a mild nose and awesome drinkability. Mouthfeel is moderate with a nice mild carbonation of fine bubbles. It has a nice velvety smoothness that really works well. Drinkability on this one is outstanding. Though the flavors are big, it is easily a session beer and will not be on my kegerator very long. I really like the lingering hop flavor on the finish. This one is damn good!"
"Very dry and again full of dark bready flavors, over cooked caramel, somewhat burnt, brown sugar, cane sugar bordering on mollasses, dark fruits, chestnuts, dried berries and a freak show of other happenings. Nicely complex with a nice bittering hop adding depth and balance."
"Murky dark chocolate brown with a thin burnt-orange head and very respectable lacing. Natural hazelnut and roasted almond scents mingle with heady cocoa and soft floral hop aromas -- very enticing. Deep chocolate flavors spiked with roasted hazelnuts and a lovely soft yet bitter dark coffee taste. Floral and ever-so-slightly spicy hop notes appear here and there. More cocoa flavors as it warms, with an almost cinnamon-like character peeking through, very reminiscent of nut-infused, lightly sweetened Mexican hot chocolate. It's rather close to a Dark Mild Ale in my estimation, but its nutty character definitely marks it as a Brown. Medium-light body with a soft chewiness to the mouthfeel. Super drinkable. If ever in the Chicago ""Southland"" area, it is certainly worth your while to seek out Flossmoor Station to pick up a growler of this stuff. It's always on tap, and it's a ridiculously drinkable session brown. In fact, I'd say it defines the last four words of that sentence."
"If you can find it, get it."
"Overall impression: The flavor of this beer was a little strong for me. However, for it's style I do think it is a good product. I don't know if this would be a good one for having with heavy food, but it was good nonetheless."
"D- I feel like this beer is more of an American Brown Ale or a Porter. It has nice big hops that would make me think that it is a ABA but the awards on the wall are for best Porter. It is a nice beer but I'm not sure why it had an alcohol warmth to it. Maybe it was served to young and needed time to age?"
"This was dark enough brown to pass for a porter in my book. Nice nuttiness, but also has a little chocolate and roast that really makes the whole thing qualify as a good porter instead of a great brown ale, but who cares. It was tasty and as long as it's tasty, I don't care if it's pushing stylistic guidelines. I don't review by style guidelines anyway."
"Well, after sampling everythig Flossmoor currently had on tap, this is the beer that went home in a growler with me and a friend. Good English-style hop bitterness and complex shades of coffee, nutmeg, maybe even hazelnuts and prunes... it's just a different taste with each sip. The glass I'm having out of the growler right now has a burnt coffee taste to it. Chocolate malts apparent, a roasty malt smell on top of a hop aroma and a warming alcohol presence, this one is a winner."
"This brew pours a medium head of light brown colored fine to medium sized bubbles that were mostly lasting and left a fair lacing. The body was an opaque brown color. It had a coffee malt aroma and a nutty mild coffee flavor. Another one of my favorite brews from the fine folks at Flossmoor Station!"
"Dark brown in color with a tan head that disapates rather quickly. Light to medium carbonation. Very malty aroma with hints of mollasses. Pleasant hop taste to balance the malts. Very smooth & drinkable."
"The beer pours a dark garnet to almost brown color with a light chocolate semi-creamy head that is modest in size, the residual lace a fine sheet to coat the glass. Roasted grains and light hop aromas dominate the nose. Start is slightly sweet, top is middling in mouth feel, the finish pleasantly hopped, pleasingly acidic, malt dry long lasting aftertaste. My bottle says that it was bottled and brewed by ""Riverside Brewery"" at least this is a drinkable beer, the previous Riverside beers Ive sampled were totally without merit, and dont really need mentioning."
"This beer runs along the lines of a Robust Porter in my book - delicious and makes you want to have more than one !"
"closer to black than brown in color,complex aroma let's you know this is a big beer,molasses & oats come through on the taste,surprisingly smooth mouthfeel,2 or 3 pints is the max"
"This beer is brewed and bottled exclusively for Flossmoor (ILL) by Riverside (CA) for distribution to MJ's American Brewpub Club.  I wonder if this beer even closely resembles what's offered at the prewpub."
