"12 Oz bottle in point glass.  Medium brown with a thin team head.   Mild malt aroma.  Tastes a little sweet and caramel malty, but we'll balanced.   Not as burnt as some brown ales.   Neeson bodied. A good,  easy drinking brown."

"Nice light chocolate color. Thin tan head  well balanced mix of malt first followed by the hops. Nice addition to roasted chicken and root veggies"

"Gotta love a classic beer."

"Overall -> I can totally pick this up again, great for dessert or just to chill out on a stressful day. Love what Smuttynose does, they just know how to do it and from a scale from 1 to 10 id give it a solid 7.5"

"Overall I thought this was a pretty nice beer and I thought it was a good example of a Brown Ale, the aroma threw me off a little, but once I got to the taste I enjoyed it more and those aspects that I look for in the style started to show up.  This beer had nice drinkability, It was smooth, pretty crisp, slightly prickly, not too filling and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, I could drink a couple of these, especially in the fall time.  What I like the most about this beer was the taste, it was pretty nice and true to style.  What I liked the least about this beer was the aroma, it was just a little unbalanced with the yeast being too dominant.  I would buy this beer again when in the mood for the style and I  would recommend trying it if you like Brown Ales.  All in all I was happy with this beer, it wasn't the most impressive Brown Ale I've had, but it was still nice and in the end I enjoyed it.  It's not a favorite of the style and I would say it's right on the same level as their Finest Kind IPA.  Nice job guys, this was a nice Brown Ale, keep it up."

""
""
""
"The best thing about it was the smell. Thought the taste was thin and average. Wouldn't buy it but would drink it for free."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, not bad for the style but lacks body, complexity and flavor. I wouldn't seek this beer out, but wouldn't turn it down if offered to me."
""
""
"Overall a great beer that I see myself getting again. This is my second time trying it and I like it even better than before."

"Argh, why do I keep getting this.  Got the variety pack and this one again.  I've had it 50 times and always forget how unforgettable it is.  Thank god for beer advocate - this well thought out review is now locked in stone. Here goes.  Odd copper color in my mind.  I liked the bready smell, but the taste is disappointing.  ABV not distinctive and just bland to me.  I like the name and art - bottle looks good.  I'll probably have another one in 2 weeks and be annoyed"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very dark cloudy smooth taste"
""
""
"Overall:  This is an absolutely delicious brown ale!  Great balance between malt, nuttiness, sweet and bitter.  This can easily become my go to East Coast brown ale.  Delicious!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's an OK beer. Not world class but just OK. I did expect a better feel but it just felt thin. Lacked a head. The high ABV doesn't justify a stellar review. However, love the name!"
""
"A really enjoyable and finely-crafted beer."
""
""
""
"I mean, it's fine. It's not something for which you're going to regret paying. But, it's not going stick-out in your memory, either."
"A muddy brown hazy color with almost no head. A little aroma of weak malt, the taste is a little wort like. It has some basic sweet mealtimes with a watery mouthfeel and practically no finish."
""
""
""
""
"Good solid beer.  Smooth after taste.  My first brown ale.  I'd drink it again."
""
"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 6/1/2015. Pours slightly hazy/cloudy reddish brown color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, nuttiness, chocolate, herbal, floral, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and light-moderate earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, nuttiness, herbal, floral, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Light earthy herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, nuttiness, chocolate, and herbal/toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and robustness of dark/bready malt and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and moderately creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent brown ale style. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; and very smooth to drink for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."
"This is an excellent beer.  I do not agree that it's a ""hoppy"" beer.  It's less bitter and has a better mouth feel than New Castle.  Medium bodied and delicious.  I'll be buying more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great un-asuming beer! I'm an IPA/Porter/Stout guy, but this beer surprised me...pleasantly.  Bolder than a typical English Brown.  More aggessivily hopped .  great mouth feel.  See what Brown can do for you!"
"Nice taste. Well rounded flavor."

"Pours a deep copper with small, fast-disappearing head. Smells of malt with a slight metallic tinge.This comes through in the taste which seems a little mineral-ey, but well-balanced with notes of caramel - not too sweet though. Great body makes it very smooth and drinkable."
""
"Bottle, but always happy to see it on tap.  A standard bearer.  Caramel isn't to my taste, but the fullness, integration of ingredients, and final smoothness render complaints silly."

"12oz bottle from a mixed twelve pack. Borwn color, good head. Aorma was malt, flavor was a malty brown ale. Not much to say about this one except that its easy to drink but sort of average."

""

"All in all a very enjoyable beer."

"This is a brilliant use of malt. Malty grain sweetness with some hops at the end.  A new favorite for sure. Smuttynose is a class act."

"Overall: A terrific representation of the style, and altogether a terrific beer. Lots of flavor, and leaves you wondering where they hide the more-than-average alcohol, as it's barely noticeable. A modern classic, I'd say."

"Serving type: bottle."

"The beer pours a nice light brown with a soft white head, and smells of toasted bread and caramel. Upon tasting the beer the taste is mostly in line with the smell with some earthiness and chocolate mixed in. The mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy with good carbonation. Overall this is a solid beer with nice flavors and drinkablility, but the star of this beer is the texture, which is outstanding."

"This pours a semi-clear, light brown color with a foamy light brown head. The aroma is mild with a great smell of malts mixed with some yeast. The taste is smooth, sweet and delicious. Sweet malts mix with caramel and nuts to make a well-balanced brown ale. Finishes with a touch of a bitter after taste. An easy drinking, everyday kind of beer."

"i was in the mood for a brown ale but this wasnt the brown ale could save the night it just boring lackluster its browm thats about it nothing outstanding to keep you coming back go look for a brown ale that packs a punch was hoping this bee was good but sadly its diapponts i know it me but i dont like it"

"Overall this is one of those beers that are just tasty and it is really kind of hard to define why. I like the grapefruit hopping in a brown ale as it just works well. Would love to try a fresher version so i will have to pick some up the next time Da Boss and i are back east."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Definitely one of the superior brown ales I've had. This is much more complex than your average beer of this style, the hops are pretty well pronounced. The beer starts off pretty mild gradually bringing in sweetness from the darker specialty grains. Then the herbal, smooth bitterness of the hops rounds everything out."
""
"I did not found it that hoppy, maybe a notch more than a traditional English Brown Ale."

"o: Very fine brown ale, good for sipping or as a dinner accompaniment. Despite being cited for having ""American"" hops levels, probably still not hopped up enough for many, but certainly a tasty and satisfying brew for traditionalists who don't mind a little extra hop bite"
"This is a pretty phenomenal brown ale. Great grainy flavor. The malts are toasted to near-perfection. Sweet notes of caramel and toffee come out in the aftertaste. I would try to explain what the hops taste like but I had a rather difficult time identifying any at all! That said, it is indeed a balanced brew and is one of the best brown ales I have had!"

"O- other than the lackluster aroma, this is a really good brown ale."

"This is a decent brown ale. I've had better, but this is still pretty good."

"The beer pored caramel brown color and had a thin tan head that quickly disappears. Some lacing remained but not much. The taste and the smell were very similar. Both were of toasted malts, nuts, and caramel sweetness. Modest carbonation and a medium body feel. A decent brown ale from another local brewery."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a beer that's clearly had better days, but it degrades pretty well I'd say. Definitely one that can be enjoyed well after the hops have faded. Would love to try this one fresh someday."
""
""
""
"O: Overall I'm quite pleased with this beer and would definitely buy again."

"Drinkabilty: This is one that I'll definitely come back to again and again. This is a great beer, and I love looking forward to drinking this beer and cooking with it again. Try this beer it is totally worth it. It's price is excellent and you really can't beat it."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very solid brown ale. I liked the complexity of flavors to this one and will definitely get it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This one is a nice solid brown ale. Nothing earth shattering. It had very little smell and the head was white, lacy and short lived. The mouth feel was the strong point and was has more body than Newcastle. There is a snappy cut off due to the higher alcohol content. I would buy this again."
""
""
"similar in both namesake and flavor to averys brown ale out of boulder, this is a delicious brew from smuttynose. it pours light for a brown, almost more of an amber color, with less than an inch of tan lace head. strong aromas of drip coffee above sweeter amber malts make this an enticing pour. before any flavors come in I notice body, lots of heft for a beer on the lighter side color wise. sweet malts, spent coffee grounds, and a pronounced nutty finish, this is as complex yet mellow and drinkable as they come. a beer lovers brown ale id say. carbonation is just enough, alcohol content is warming but not tasted, and there is a certain smoothness not only to the beer itself, but to the buzz it generates after a few pints. I strongly recommend this to the lover of fine browns, real good."
"This is a good tasting brown ale, but I can't rank it up there as a world class beer like the ""brothers"" did."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very balanced and flavorful beer, not as dark or thick as some brown ales out there but still solid and a fine beer to drink any time or year."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is my first review, but this ale drove me to this site to leave comments on one of the best beers I have had in recent memory. I like that @ Dewey's they have rotating taps and you are able to check them out on line before venturing out, so there is a pretty decent chance of getting what is actually stated on their web site."

"Had this beer on tap at the Portsmouth Brewery in Portsmouth, NH. It has a pleasant odor and great, rich brown color. But, it has a smooth nutty hoppy taste that really sets this apart from the other beers that were also on tap. Even though there were twelve other beers to choose from, I got another Old Brown Dog."
""
""
""
"O: This beer is the line – the line between good and great brown ales. Everything is in order, from the earthy, nutty palate to the soft, pleasing mouthfeel that makes this beer best closer to room temperature. But there’s no chances taken here, and that’s ok; it seems that this dog is meant to be a traditional brew, and in that sense, it succeeds. I’d just be surprised if I ever got the urge to pick it up again."
""
""
""
"Absolutely a winner here!"
"Overall: As a brown ale, one of the better options available. Goes down smooth and is not to heavy or syrupy. Still can taste some of the hops behind all of the malts. Has a really pleasant ending and after taste that is appealing . Usually, I have to take a sip of water after brown ales and porters because of the overwhelming taste of sweet syrup. This is a well balanced Brown Ale."

"O - one of the first smutty's I've had and an instant favorite from the New Hampshire outfit. They made this big enough to pack the flavors we love from a true American brown without going crazy with some exotic style. This is down to earth and enjoyable. Just a great year round offering that you know what you're getting. Simple and classy."

"Pours copper brown with light haze and a stubborn, full head of foam. Lace coats the glass. Nose is sweet toasted malt, toffee, nutty with a touch of chocolate. Has some herbal hops in back, lightly fruity that give a touch of earth. Taste is rich malt and lightly sweet. Velvety smooth and buttery biscuit with subtle, herbal dark fruits. Hops show up mid palate with some bitter, fade quickly and the malt opens up with some roast and coffee. There’s a malt dryness and a slight alcohol dryness that’s stately yet devil may care. Aftertaste is lightly sweet and bready. This is a very original brown ale with a rousing and robust malt character. Fantastic."

"Overall: a tasty and slight complex brown ale. good first try from smuttynose, will definitely be going back for more"
""
"Overall: A tasty, well-made brew with no detectable defects. If it were me brewing it, I would to kick in some (more?) chocolate malt to up the flavor, and darken the color. Definitely for those who favor malt over hops (I favor both, depending on the occasion). One could drink too many of these, as it doesn't taste like a beer with 6.7% ABV."

"This was a draft which had a feeble head, although I was at a restaurant at LaGuardia airport, so who knows how clean the glass was! The color was a nice dark copper, carmel nose, with a nice nutty flavor. The lingering after taste was very strong alcohol."
""
"O: It's pretty solid. I kind of feel like saying ""it's not you, it's me"" due to the fact that it's well made and well balanced, but not my thing. Brown ale fans will really like it."

""
""

"Overall: One of the best Brown Ales, beats Avery's Ellies. (why always the wet dog? this is one nice chocolate brown wet new hampshire dog on the beach. Let it warm!"
""
"I love the taste but it leaves me begging as the sweet maltiness teases but never quite satisfies. Hint of caramel, hint of burnt malt there's a lot of amber or Irish Red qualities. Very nice for the price I'd love to see a double malted version to truly satisfy a teasingly good ale."
""
"Overall a very average ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours brown with cocoa hues and a solid sheet of fine tan foam. Smells nice and bready with some herbal hops and a little bit of graham with just a touch of tea. Flavor is malt, nuts, toasted bread, burnt coffee (really light) some solid bits of leather. medium on full bodied with light carb and a wet finish. Decent for the style, not available in my area, so I'd rather drink Avery's Ellie's instead."

"Just another Brown Ale, but it's quite drinkable as long as you down it fast. On tap at Burger Tap & Shake in Foggy Bottom. [transcribed from notes ; 06/12/2012 visit]"

"This is not just an American Brown Ale, it's more like an American Scottish Ale. It's all about malt. It probably won't appeal to a lot of drinkers, but it's one of the better American Brown Ales I've had. My hat's off to a brewer who is not afraid to leave the hops alone and let the malt take the lead. Welcome to Kentucky Smuttynose!"
""
"12floz. Bottle. ½ pt glass. Enjoyed on sep´12. Dark copper color. Clear appearance. Off-white froth creates a thin & quickly dissipated crown. Caramel malt aroma rounded by hints of candies, subtle chocolate & floral fragrances. Mild toasted malt at firs sip with tea infusion notes. Medium to high body. Moderate to high carbonation. Oily to watery texture & spicy palate. Slightly citric & orange hues as well as gentle black cocoa in the middle resolves into a kind sweet/bitter finish. Very easy drinkability."

"Remember when The Simpsons was good? Remember the episode where Moe sells Homer Red Tick Beer? There's a gag where the brewer tastes the beer and proclaims, ""Needs more dog."" I'm referring to this episode, which apparently aired in 1997 (ouch), because I don't have much to say about this beer, other than I find the name amusing. It's a solid brown ale. It's not Surly Bender, but what is?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Excellent example of the style. That light chocolate character is a welcome treat, though not as hoppy as some, which I actually prefer in this type of brew."
"Overall: This is a nicely balanced beer, really drinkable with a nice flavor. I could definitely drink more than one. The only con for me was it was slightly more carbonated than I generally prefer in a beer, but that certainly wouldn’t stop me from having another!"

"The malts really come through with this brown ale. Rich, fairly sweet and inviting with just the right touch of hop bitterness to balance things out. One gets a small sense of the alcohol presence, but it stays pretty well hidden in the background. So, yeah. If you're looking for a top-notch malt-centric brown ale, find one of these brews and enjoy."

"O- I enjoyed the hops on this one as it added another demension, but the malt profile seemed simple. That could be what they were going for but it didn't quite click for me. Still worth trying though."

"This is very simple, and that is not always a bad thing. It just does not do it for me. I think the lingering metallic character and thin mouth are the biggest detractors. Though still enjoyable."
"The beer pours a dark and candied brown with the slightest hint of ambering notes, like maple syrup. A lovely, light tan head of tightly packed and smooth bubbles forms over the top of the beer and stands at about a fingers-width. Lacing from the head is like thin and slightly slippery curtains along the sides of the glass, leaving cob webs of foam in its wake. The beer’s body is dark, but relatively clean with a very light haze. On the nose, the beer smells of a nutty roast, similar to lighter porters that I have smelt. Hazelnut coffee comes to mind, though there is a very faint bitter kiss to the nose suggesting hops, and some semisweet chocolate notes. The beer tastes lightly roasty and nutty, with some lovely light complexities playing on the tongue. The beer begins with light sweet caramel malts before opening into very light roasted flavors which eventually introduce nutty and chocolate flavors that smooth through the finish alongside the returning caramel malts. The aftertaste is of sweet malt coffee, almost like bittersweet chocolate. As I sip it more, I notice a certain bitter quality building in my mouth, though it has no discernible flavoring to it. On the mouth, the beer feels medium of body, with a nice chewiness to it. The mouth is left a little roasted dry on the tongue, but with a good sheen of saliva sitting over the tongue to dampen it down. Overall, this is a really nice brown ale. I’m actually really digging this beer right now. It doesn’t blow you away in any category, but has an all-around balanced flavoring that is excellent to sip on. This beer is a great fall beer, I imagine, and is surely excellent for sipping on as you watch the world blow by. This beer is the next step up from sessionable. A good beer from Smuttynose for sure!"

"Overall: At one time this would have been the bee's knees but, like that saying, those times have passed; a nice brown ale but more like your father's brown if your father was a craft beer drinker"

"O: Tasty stuff, this gets much better as it warms too. Paired with a hearty pork chop meal and I was diggin it."
""
"I've had this beer both on draft and from the bottle. While draft is obviously the superior drinking method, the bottle is every bit as tasty. If you haven't tried this beer, you're missing out."
"This beer pours up a deep copper/light mahogany with about a two finger head, some retention, and some lacing, although minimal in both cases. The nose is quite nice. I can't quite pick out all the aromas, but it is pleasant and appealing. Taste is very well balanced. Lucious and sweet upfront seamlessly giving way to a mild hoppiness on the finish. It is a mild flavor, yet a full flavor as well. Nothing is quite in your face, but it is loaded with understated flavor. Mouthfeel is very smooth, with a small aftertaste that is similar to dark chocolate. I wish I had bought more of these. Maybe next trip."

"A lot lighter in flavor than I remember."
"Overall this was a fantastic beer, if your looking for ambers with some serious taste and quality, then this is your beer. If you get the chance try it, it's worth it."
""
"Smuttynose I friggin' hate you. You make in impossible to pick your best beer. This beer has an incredible pour. The color has a great copper glow in the low level bar light. The fragrance is good and the flavor is a incredible. While most beers that are amazing on the first beer and you can't see drinking more, this is not the case with Old Brown Dog. It is a staple of the darker beer diet."
"Overall – The nice flavors, drinkability, and good smooth transitions of the brew make for a great one to go out and try (and try again)."

"I like this brown ale. The appearance is a ruddy brown which pours a quarter inch head. The nose is of sweet malty, dark fruit. The taste is malty with some dark fruit in the mix. The mouthfeel is medium. Overall this is a solid brown ale and gets better as it warms."

"Pours a dark, muddy copper with a finger of beige head. The head dissipates rather quickly, but sticks around the edge of the glass leaving a healthy dose of lacing behind. The nose is bready for sure. Definite malt forward flavor with a bitter and semi-dry finish. Not fancy, but still one of the best browns around."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a dark brown, almost black color, with a small brownish colored head that leaves nice lacing. Smells of darkly roasted malt and slight coffee notes, very nice. Tastes of slight coffee notes, but primarily of darkly roasted grain, sweet, but not too sweet. Goes down real smooth for a medium bodied beer. Overall, a very good beer."
""
"O-good drinking brown ale with nice malt character and flavor"
""
""
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew were the quality malts, and the drying finish to the feel. These malts showed depth and solid flavoring, but they become a bit mild and redundant by the end of the glass. We wished the nose was more robust, showcasing more of those great malts. Everything else about this beer is pretty average, but it makes for a tasty, well-balanced treat."
""
""
""
"O - Really enjoyed this one, a new standard to hold other brown ales to for me."
"O - If you’re into brown ale malty goodness, this is a very good beer. It’s a good beer regardless, but especially good if you like brown ales. Smells and tastes good and has a solid mouthfeel. As with the other Smuttynose beers that I’ve had, there’s nothing spectacular or particularly different about this beer, but it’s just an all-around good beer. I’d look for this one again."
""
"Overall I enjoy this more now than I remember first sampling in the bottle. Maybe that bottle wasn't fresh or handled poorly. Nothing stellar or monumental but just a really drinkable solid brown ale, not my favorite but good non-the-less and quite acceptable to find on draft at a random bar in NYC."

"Poured on-tap and served in a tumbler pint, the beer is a deep, auburn-brown color that is crisp and clean looking. A low profile, filmy white head sits atop the brew. The beer has a light nose of nut and caramel. The flavor profile is a blending of roasted and rich sweetness, with a toffee-nut backbone and a very light hopping at the end. Smooth, clean finish, with a lightly sweet and roasted aftertaste. This is a tasty staple beer that you can't go wrong having on hand in your fridge."
""
"O - Overall this is a fantastic brown. I feel the style is the only thing limiting this beer from near perfection. Cheers to my favorite Smuttynose brew!"
""

"This was an interesting brown ale. The complexity wasn’t quite there. But overall the palate seemed pleasing. I would definitely drink this again if offered up."

"O: I like this brown ale. It is a definite easy drinker as I could easily put away a few of these."
"O: Flavorful brown ale; has some hints of that coffee/chocolate flavor that's seen in stouts but is somelight lighter with a distinctive bitterness; again very tasty, can definitely down a few of these"
""
""
""
""
"O - Another very good beer from Smuttynose. It isn't as flavorful as some brown ales, but the taste is balanced and complex. It goes down easy and I could probably have several without getting sick of it. I will probably get this beer again."

"12 ounce bottle,that I bought at Family Beer and Liquor in East Dubuque, IL. Pours dark brown with a tan head. Smell is malty, nutty, with a little bit of chocolate and caramel. Taste is very similar with some raisin type flavor going on also. A really enjoyable brown ale."
" flavors. Everything I want from a brown ale."
""
"Half finger head with light lacing on a cloudy on a very nice amber and brown body. Caramel malts and brown sugar in the aroma. Flavor is more of the same with the addition of nutty and chocolate notes. Medium body and moderate to high carbonation. Overall the hops are well represented, the taste is complex and there is no bad aftertaste making this one very drinkable."

"Pours a deep slightly cloudy crimson color with a huge off white head that recedes but never leaves. Smells of toffee and brown sugar with some earthy hops thrown in the mix for contrast. Slight bit of dark fruits like plums and cherries, a hint of alcohol and butter in there as well. Taste is malty sweet with a distinct bit of dark fruit and ethanol. Lots of toffee and brown sugar and luckily not much butter survives. Light earthy hop flavor helps balance the malt. Medium body and level of carbonation with a sweet earthy mineral mouthfeel. Don Henley said ""Don't look back you can never look back."" I remember really enjoying this beer but today I fell like I could take it or leave it. Decent beer but not my cup of tea anymore."
"Beer is medium to light in body, flavors are thin on the palate, minimal malt, mildly bitter roast finish, finish is nice, I'd have again nice standby beer but rather unremarkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Definitely hoppier and fruitier than your average brown ale but it's well integrated here. The availability and price in this area definitely make it one of the go-to's for the style."
""
""
""
"Notes: This beer has a lot going on. I don't think its style suits it. Very good, with great flavor and good mouthfeel, but just a bit off for the style. I would try it again, but there are other Smuttynose offerings I would go for beforehand."
""
""
"O: A good beer. A bit stronger than your average English Brown Ale, yet not as hoppy as some American offerings."
"Smell is sweet and a bit caramellic. Sweet taste with not much depth. Drinkable but not more than that."
""
""
""
""

"12 ounce bottle, the stamp on the bottle is smudged but it says it's best before some time in February 2012. Bought it as part of a mixed 6 pack at a local Kroger. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown with a half inch light tan head. Head retention and lacing are both good enough. Aroma is nice and malty, the brew smells like bready and caramel malt, nuts, bittersweet chocolate and toffee. Taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but there's also a bit of dark fruit flavors noticeable (cherries, raisins). Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and coating with good carbonation. I think this is a good overall brown ale, I'd buy this again in the future. I liked it."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I feel like if some of this were tuned, or even pulled out some of those flavors, this could be a very good brown. Until then, it is average at best."
"O: A good brown ale, but far from the best I've had, and just not fitting of the ""world class"" rating that the bros gave it. I'd certainly buy it again if I was looking for a brown ale and it was all that was available, but I don't think it would ever be my first choice."
""

"Found this poor little doggy in the back of my fridge, a few days after his best-by month. Hope he's still a good boy! Pours a red-brown color with a modest head that quickly shrinks to a cap. Aroma is roasty maltiness, with some cocoa powder underneath. Standard, but solid. The taste is a nice, toasted malt with earthy aspects. There's a bit of hop on the finish. A dry brown ale. The mouthfeel is well-carbonated and medium-bodied, and the drinkability is about what you'd expect for the ABV. Overall, a good brown ale."
"Poured from bottle into pint glass. Attractive rich brown pour with 1+ finger of off white head. Minimal lacing that vanishes quickly. Smell is of carmel and nuts. Perhaps a note of malts/bread grain. Mild on the nose. Taste is quite smooth with only a minimal hops bite on the end. Some bitterness, but more on the malty end of the spectrum. Taste follows the nose with carmel and a nutty/earthy tone. Feel is a good mix of carbonation and silk. A little dry, but not watery. Overall- A pretty solid brown, but nothing outstanding. Could use a boost on the flavor with more rich/complex notes. Pretty straight forward brown. Will drink another without a doubt- Pretty tasty-"
"If you're like me, and you almost instinctually seek out the pale ales and IPAs, this would be a nice breath of fresh air. A reminder of what a simple, good, malty brown ale tastes like. If nothing else, it'll help you appreciate your alpha acids and IBUs when you return to the bitter side. This beer is completely at the other end of the spectrum. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. And I know I'll buy it again."
"O - A nice roasty brown ale. Not dark enough to be a porter, but more hop presence than an English Brown. If you like brown ales, this is a very good representation."
"Very tasty."
"Pours a murky dark brown with an off white head that didn't stick around. Smells malty with some Englishy hops. Tastes of semi- sweet malt and ends a bit dryer than I prefer. Pretty solid but not my #1 as it used to be. I'd recommend it pretty highly."
"I highly recommend this beer."
"Overall, this was a solid, if not a little light, brown ale. It's not meant to be overpowering, and comes across as a very drinkable, but darker and sweeter, session ale."
"M - Not too much carbonation, which makes the initial mouthfeel quite nice and smooth. Tingles only slightly, which is what I look for in a brown ale. Once the Old Brown Dog Ale hits the back of the tongue it can become a bit sharp and bitter."
"Overall, a great looking and smelling brew, but it falls short of fulfilling ones initial expectations. Given the high reviews, it is entirely plausible this was a randomly bad bottle and an isolated occurrence. I would be happy to give this one another try."
"Slight bitter hp bite and brown bread flavor, not sweet, not sour, well balanced. This is a beer you could drink by the half gallon."
"This is the best Brown Ale that I have tried so far. Just an easy drinking ale, that is just perfect for the fall. A brown color when poured, and a hint of both caramel and chocolate. Going to be a staple for me from here on out. Look forward to trying it on draft."
"I tried this beer at a local family/pub pizza restaurant. It was from tap however, I think the carbonation level was a little low. The beer had a nice caramel color to it, the overall texture and taste was decent but lacked depth. Generally good tasting but nothing to write home about."
"O- A good brown ale from Smuttynose. Very easy to drink. It was just a bit to sweet for my taste. Needed a bit more body to it to hold it all up. Glad I tried it. Looking forward to Really Old Dog with a year on it."
"O: Very enjoyable, easy drinker. Nothing fancy just good beer."
"O-A solid high B+ beer. I'd almost say this in combination with GI's IPA is what I'm looking for when I want an everyday beer that is a B+."
"Overall: An above-average American Brown from a continually impressing brewery. This is a solid beer that I will definitely be revisiting."
"o - Overall a well above brown ale. Super easy to drink and felt like I could have had a few of these. Would definitely have again if I was looking for a brown ale."
"pretty good brown overall was hoping for more flavor, but its still really nice.imo not as good as the samuel smith nut brown, but fairly close."
"Give this one a try! This is the way a brown Ale should be outstanding flaovr."
"Morey's Bottom Line: This isn't my favorite style, but this one is pretty tasty. A nice change-of-pace fall beer (I've been sipping on Oktoberfest and Pumpkin Ales)."
"D - I had more than one and would have it again."
"O: Havent had brown ale in awhile. I might need to go on a brown ale binge lol. Great balance of flavors nothing else to say, probably my favorite english style brown ale."
"This is a very fluid liquidy brew. The alcohol is fairly well disguised, so don’t just sit there enjoying one after the other and thinking to yourself, “man, these are tasty suckers, I can drink these all day long!”"
" Overall this is a quality brown ale. Lot's of flavor in this. I would recommend if you are into the style."
"Overall: not a bad beer, but it's not really my favorite brown ale. It seems well put-together, but the flavor profile just doesn't float my boat."
"Overall, balanced with great flavor but a bit of a rough edge. This could make a world-class lager: same flavor but smoother."
"O: great brown ale. One of my new favorites."
"o: very good example of what a brown should be. no surprises, just a very well put together beer."
"This would be a great everyday brown ale, especially with barbecue. While not as complex and robust as I had expected, Smuttynose is as reliable and loveable as the dog who obediently sits on the brew's label. Good stuff - pair it with smokier bbq fare, as this brew tends to be a bit sweeter."
"Make mine a Smutty"
"O: Tasty brown ale with more hop flavor than most brown ales. Enjoyable. Would drink again."
"Overall, a very tasty brown ale. It's heavy on the malts, but they bring a variety of flavors that I really like. Quite good - I'm looking forward to trying a fresher bottle."
"O: Solid brown ale with a bit more hop bitterness than most of the other brown ales I've tried. Not one of my favorites."
"O - Old Brown Dog is certainly a beer you can't go wrong with. It's characteristically a big beer in a small bottle, offering ample complexities yet defined with a fine sense of control. A great filler for any fridge."
"O - Overall a fine brown ale, but not something I will drink regularly."
"Overall a pretty solid brown ale here and enjoyable."
"Very easy to drink, the alcohol only becoming evident as the mouth dries between sips/gulps."
"O: a nice brown ale from smutty."
"Final Thoughts: It's a very good beer and pretty good textbook style."
"O: A good brown ale. Go fetch one and take it for a walk."
"O: This is a pretty good brown ale. Nice caramel and toasted malt flavors. One of the better brown ales that I've tasted."
"OLD BROWN DOG MANS BEST FRIEND."
"My 1st try from Smuttynose and I haven't been back to anything by the company. From notes; Bottle poured into pint glass very little smell wise save for a mild soury malt smell. No ABV printed on bottle that poured a rich caramel color w/no head but lil bubbles. Hoppy, malty and a lil typical but NOT smooth goin' down...kinda had to choke her down, before I split the rest w/the sink drain. I'll have to try a different style from this brewery but this was a turn off that will keep other breweries ahead of the Smut on my ""to try/get"" list"
"Brown ales have never been my favorite style of beer but this one really nails it. I've never had a tastier brown ale besides Dogfish Head's IBA but thats not really a brown ale because of it being a hybrid beer. So on its own this is my favorite brown ale to date. The kiss of hops on the beginning and after taste balances this beer out so well. The doesn't takes away from the malts at all and the dry finish really compliments the cocoa like chocolate malts. The earthy herbal aftertaste also really gives this beer an excellent score in the taste department. I got this in the Smuttynose variety sampler 12 pack and its definitely worth buying."
"Overall- A solid, straightforward brown ale. It is good for what it is, but nothing to geek out about. A soothing beer, if that makes sense, and screams for Fall weather. I could see myself drinking a lot of this during football season, assuming they will figure their shit out. Feels very sessionable, though the ABVs will eventually catch up to you."
"A pretty nice beer, but seems a bit light on flavor for a brown ale. Certainly enjoyable and for the ABV drinkable as all hell."
"O - Solid beer from Smuttynose, not too complex, but very strightforward and enjoyable"
"overall: a brown ale with character, mellow and consistent, very drinkable."
"This is a very good sessionable brown and it paired well with my steak."
"O: nice easy drinking brown that tastes a bit like a stout but looks like a brown."
"Outstanding beer overall."
"O - Pretty good, not awesome, not bad, drinkable for sure. decent"
"Pours a clear, amber color. 1/2 inch head of an off-white color. Good retention and decent lacing. Smells of slight nut, hops, sweet malt, slight earthy malt, hint of roasted malt, and hint of floral hops. Fits the style of an American Brown Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, hops, slight grain, slight nut, hint of roasted malt, hint of earthy malt, and a hint of alcohol. Overall, good aroma, blend, body, and complexity."
"Overall: Not bad, but it got to me after a while, and I wouldn't get it again."
"Cheers!"
"Overall-Very impressed. My first smuttynose in a while. Only thing I wish was a little lower ABV to make more sessionable. Flavor was great, awesome Brown Ale."
"Edit: Best before date is September 2011 so I guess its fresh"
"Overall: A style I haven't had many of, but this is one of the better examples thus far. High on flavor while balanced enough to enjoy during the summer months."
"Just a great beer. One of the best brown ales out there."
"O: A delightful and versatile beer. Paired well with a sharp, but sweet Wisconsin cow's milk cheddar (Summer Breeze). I would like to have this around all year-round."
"Amber brown with a creamy white head that leaves sticky webs of lace and great retention. The smell is malty with chocolate, hints of coffee and tons of caramel. Sweet caramel, brown sugar and chocolate taste great with hints of vanilla and touches of roasted notes. Some nutty qualities balance this brown ale to a well rounded, and easy to drink beverage. Light/medium body is smooth and tasty."
"Nice beer, not one of my faves, but very good."
"Overall - A great brown ale. Very highly drinkable and a great mixture of flavors. Smell was a bit weak, but standard for a brown ale. Good beer. Cheers"
"Overall: Seriously great. Rich and sweet, but far from cloying. This beer was one of my introductions to craft beer years ago. I revisited it recently and could not stop thinking about it. So damn good."
"Fairly full in body, the effervescence is crisp upfront but drops quickly. A touch of warming late, this brew is really quite good. Hoppy enough for hopheads without being overkill for the malties like me. May I have another please?"
"Drinkability: overall not bad, but not a favorite"
"Pours a hazy brown to amber color, with a light tan head. In the aroma, caramel and a coffee roast. In the taste, faint caramel and a nice dry coffee presence. A small hop bite and medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry, sticky coffee in the aftertaste. Nice mix of caramle and coffee, a nice body and easy to drink."
"D - Very drinkable. The malt flavor is very rich and sweet, but never gets too sweet. The other flavors do a great job of balancing out the flavors."
"Butterscotch with a hint of piney hops to balance out finishes with caramel and malt. A solid beer and one of the best brown ales out there. This is the beer that first drew me into craft beer."
"Overall, this is a decent beer for the style. I would prefer there to be a little more nuttiness in the flavor to balance out the malts and the bitter presence of the hops. Some additional carbonation would benefit this beer as well."
"Overall a medium to light bodied beer which is decent and drinkable."
"O: A mellow, drinkable brown ale with a focus on sweet malt flavor."
"Pours a dark copper color with no head at all. Zilch. Just a thin ring around the edge. This looks like a tap-pour. I give it a swirl to get some of the aromas started. Sweet syrup, pie crust, chocolate malt in the nose. Good firm body. Decent carbonation backing it up. Smooth on the edges. Sweet malts!! Wow. This is all malt, and I like it. Bitterness is absent. Caramel corn, graham cracker, bread, and just the slightest of alcohol noted. I dig it. Brown Ales aren't usually my go-to beer, but this is a good one that I will surely have again."
"Cheers!"
"O: Really like this one. A perfect job of crafting what a Brown should be. This moves into my top 2 list for American Browns. Will buy this often."
"D - The brown ale to which all others should be judged. I can have this any time, anywhere. Delicious."
"D - This is an excellent brown ale for when I am in the mood for brown ales. Smuttynose hit this style on the head. I can and will drink many more of these."
"O: This is one of my favorite brown ales and I feel lucky to have it as a fantastically priced local. Big, bold toasted malt toffee flavor, balanced with a small amount of hops, with a full, luscious creamy mouthfeel. You don't always need to be extreme to make a great tasting beer."
"So I am in New Hampshire for the Great Bay Half Marathon...its the night before a race and ....why not drink some....ok....alot of the local beer!!! The Old Brown Dog from Smuttynose is good. This beer has was a heavy copper/light brown in color with thin white head and great lace. The smell was nothing to write home about. This beer had some sweetness and roast flavors that were goos in taste! The smell funnels into the taste of this beer. The light ABV leads to this beer being a Session...certainly worth a taste."
"feels great and over all this is probably my favorite Am Brown. no joke."
"Overall - This is a good representation of the style. Not something that I'll be going back to anytime soon, but it's a decent offering from smuttynose that's an easy drinker for sure."
"Wow, very nice brown ale here, like an authentic Newcastle. Nothing that will blow your socks off like DFH Palo Santo or vastly different like DFH Indian Brown, but a benchmark for the style, nonetheless."
"O - Interesting take on a brown ale. Relatively high ABV makes this more of a sipping beer. Chocolate/spice/dried fruit profile makes me think this could be passed off as a Belgium-style Dubbel, and I'd pair it with food with this in mind. Worth future purchases."
"Cheers!"
"Overall a very tasty Brown Ale that had a nice bold bitter sweet coffee flavor with a nice hoppiness at the end."
"Drinkability: While I think this is a good beer, I could have used a little bit less of the dark fruit sweetness. I wish there was a little more nutty flavor along with the malt."
"Bottle dates on label not punched but year choices are '11 and '12, so I'll believe it's fresh. Pours with a copper-ish brown body and a decent head that recedes to a thin film with light lacing. Smells sweet and sightly boozy with a bit of earthy must to it. The taste is straight up malt with a bit of booze in the aftertaste. Really pleasant body with appropriate carbonation. I can see drinking more of these in the future."
"D- Decent, probaby could only have a few at a time but still a great beer"
"Overall - A pretty standard but good brown ale... worth a try..."
"Super easy to drink... just a little thin on the mouthfeel."
"D- I couldnt kill a 6 pack, but would recommended it to a friend any day."
"D - Session. Yes."
"Mouthfeel is solid and smooth, nice moderate body in this brew with matching carbonation. Drinkability is great, a solid beer from a solid brewery."
"D - Very drinkable take on the style. If I'm every wanting a nice brown ale, chances are I'm going to be going back this offering from Smuttynose."
"I wish I had been the one to order it; in fact I only tasted my friend's. That was Saturday. On Monday we went to buy supplies for a clone of it. I didn't notice the smell--neither good nor bad--so I'm going to dry-hop it just a little with Willamette."
"D- not a session beer, but drinkable. A solid beer all around. Definitely let it warm up some before drinking for better results."
"D very average, I was expecting much more from this one, I think that I'll be saving it to ""share"" with the in-laws :)"
"D-This beer isn't bad, but it's pretty one note and a little too bitter for an English Brown."
"Pours a pretty light reddish brown for the style. Not much head, quickly goes away. Nice nutty aroma. Also some chocolate, toffee and alcohol notes. Really smooth light flavor. Good nuttiness, hints of baking chocolate, toffee and some crisp hops to finish. Solid smooth brew."
"D - An all around easy to drink and simple, yet complex, brown ale. I found myself thoroughly enjoying this one and would gladly have another."
"Pours a deep brown color with a thick off-white head that leaves impressive lacing. The aroma has strong coffee and toasted whole grain bread notes upfront, along with some caramel and dark chocolate, dark fruits and some floral hops and alcohol. The flavor is more fruity upfrong with notes of figs and plums, along with some toasted bread and caramel, cafe au lait, floral hops and a touch of alcohol. The mouthfeel is moderate and drinkability is very good. This is a solid brown ale, admirably restrained in the hops department, dry and more roasty than fruity."
"D- Not bad, its def drinkable by itself or with a meal."
"Poured from a bottle that's good until Feb 11' into a pint glass on 2.9.11. Color is a somewhat hazy and dark amber-reddish color under a big pillowy light tan head. Aroma is a moderate malt nose with notes of toasted biscuit, toffee, and a light but sharp pungent earthy fruit spice. Mouthfeel is a pretty gentle malt sweetness with hints of roasted pistachio, light caramel, and a light but outstanding hop note. There's a dry finish that somewhat resembles that of an earthy root and butterscotch. I'm gathering this is more along the lines of a Northern English Brown Ale. Very nice..."
"Reviewed on: 02-07-2011 03:06:21"
"The drink is good for a brown, being that it is actually tasty and worth drinking."
"Very easy to drink."
"I found this one to be a very good brown ale. It was perhaps a little bolder in flavor than most brown ales. There's a picture of a dog on the label (presumably named Olive) who stares at you sheepishly as you drink it. I received this same effect from after consuming a few too many barleywines one night but it turns out that this time the dog on the label was real."
"Definitely worth a look, not Smuttynose's finest, but definitely an above average brew"
"Pours a perfect tea-brown, faintly orange and murky. A tannish head rings quickly, but stays on the glass. I'm picking up a bit of detritus as well as a hot alcoholic aroma. A touch of sweetness. The taste starts off with some decent hopped bitterness, then blends into some sweet and very slightly sour roasted/toasted malts. Decently cocoa-like. Nicely complex, in all. The finish is smooth and bitter, actively carbonated. More leaf litter for the aftertaste, but that seems to be a constant among the Smutty's that I've tried, and it's not a bad thing. (Also, the alcohol being about at its max for the styles - their beers can sneak up on you!) A good drinking English Brown that tastes a lot better than its first impression."
"D- very drinkable. good taste, not too heavy and no unwanted aftertastes. quality beverage. im not a big brown ale guy but this ones pretty good"
"D: All around a nice beverage, especially if you favor malts."
"The taste combines the medium roasted flavors and hardshell nuts. Hopping adds a little leathery, earthen bitterness to off-set the malts. This is a pretty staright forward, sweet, somewhat syrupy palated beer. There's balance, but it stays well within style. A nice NH session Brown Ale for your consideration."
"Drinkability -- This one really hit the spot. Great malting, easy drinking. If I wasn't such a beer whore, I'd put this one in regular rotation in the fridge. Really quite satisfying."
"Not down and out, just brown."
"Drinkability of this ale is very high, considering the delicious taste and well-balanced nature. Decent lacing along the insides of the glass. A solid offering from Smuttynose, definitely worth a try."
"Enjoyable, but not remarkable."
"Overall... It's a good beer, but nothing spectacular. I could drink this regularly, but only at a certain price point."
"D: I like that its a different take on a brown, but not a lot going on."
"D/M: very slight carbonation, smooth drinking, great complexity, leaves a lingering maltiness on the pallet, great representation of the style"
"D - No problem with the one, could probably have another. A great everyday brown ale."
"A very solid beer that went well with the burger I had while drinking this beer."
"I had higher expectations the first time I tried Old Brown Dog. Second time around wasn't too impressive. I love the brown ale style, and I can't put this at the top, although it's not horrible.. there's just too many better examples of the style."
"Drinkability: This is a pretty solid brew overall. I have been happy with pretty much everything I have had from Smuttynose, and they distribute in Illinois now."
"Drink - A fairly decent brew that might work out well for a session. I was surprised and the amount of metallic taste but it was still decent."
"Cheers..."
"This had a big old head when poured into a pint glass. The beer had a light brown color, with no lacing around the glass as I drank it. I smelled some (caramel?) maltiness in there. The taste is also malty, pretty smooth and thick. The alcohol is a little present here, but that is fine with me. Overall a good brown ale. Not my favorite from Smuttynose, but as I like all of their beer, that's ok."
"D - very drinkable. goes down easy with a good dinner. I'd like to have this again."
"This is from a sampler pack and both bottles had similar flavor, just a bit underwhelming frankly."
"Puts a warm feeling on your tongue. Nice beer to have during the winter time if you don't like really heavy porters or stouts."
"Its not bad, but the flavors are a bit strange and on the unusual side. Really having a hard time with this one, not completely sure what to make of it."
"An interesting take on the English brown ale style. Flavorful, but this is certainly an American version, as the earthy hops come on a little too aggressive eclipsing some of the subtle fruit qualities normally present in an English brown ale."
"D- Highly drinkable. Being less dry and nutty than many English Browns this ale is smooth from start to finish, with loads of flavor, and could be enjoyed casually."
"Had this on tap at Local 44. Always loved this one, finally got to have it on tap. Showed a reddish brown with frothy white head and decent lacing. Smell sweet malty, some caramel sweetness, balanced by some bitterness. Taste bready malts up front, some dry nuttyness and sweet caramel or raisin like notes, balanced by some dry hops. Loved it."
"AMAZING BROWN ALE, MUST TRY!"
"Reddish brown with garnet hues and very small had which dissipated quickly. Smells surprisingly hoppy for an English Brown. Also plenty of alcohol and toasted malt in the nose. Begins with some initial hop bitterness, and is quickly follow by some malty sweetness and is rounded off by astringent and smoke toasted grains which also impart some bitterness. Overall tastes a lot darker than it looks. Medium bodied with a creamy mouthfeel that is interrupted by the occasional prickly jolt of carbonation. The hop presence was certainly a surprises. An easy drinking complex brown ale in what is otherwise a somewhat, IMO, dull style. Well worth a try."
"drinkability - after just drinking a boffo brown - this beer is a much sweeter lighter brown while the boffo is almost a porter - this beer i could even drink in hot weather"
"This was very easy to drink, the flavor was strong and well balanced. I wouldn't mind having this again."
"D - The drinkability is good. It goes down very easy. I think this is a great brown ale. I could drink these all day. Perfect beer for the current weather."
"D/O- For having previously not cared a whole lot for browns, I found myself enjoying this one immensely. Could and would drink a few of these if I was able to get them on a regular basis. My first Smuttynose."
"This was a $9.99 6pack at stop and shop. I passed over it several times but I will be going back to it. It is very close to Sam Smith's brown ale."
"D - Smooth feel and very easy to drink; I could definitely have plenty of these in one sitting"
"Pours dark cloudy amber / burnt brown with a nice tan head. Nose is caramel malt, earthy hops. Taste is sweet toasted caramel malt, with earhty hops. Palate is med body, good carbonation, smooth creamy texture. Finish is sweet malty caramel with good eathy hops for balance, followed by some nice toasted nutty aftertaste. Overall a very nicely balanced and drinkable brew"
"D: It's not bad, per se, but ultimately, this isn't my cup of tea, or beer. The sweetness becomes cloying by halfway through the glass. One and done."
"D- easy to drink and pretty true to style. its a little strong to session, but having a couple definitely wouldnt be a bad time. if youre a fan of the english brown ale, check this one out."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is pretty decent, it had some nice flavors to it overall and went down pretty easy. The alcohol showing through hurts it a little but not too bad. Pretty solid beer overall."
"D: This was a good brown ale, but nothing too special. Smell and taste were ok, and it had nice body, so it was easy to drink. I enjoyed it, but it doesn't rank in the top tier of brown ales for me."
"12 oz bottle from a variety pack. Pours hazy amber (?) with a large, long lasting, off-white head. Aroma of bready malt and some fruit. Medium body, medium carbonation. Bready malt, spicy, earthy hops and some dark fruit fill the mouth. Long, dry, bitter finish. Not bad, but this beer reminds me more of an Amber than Brown."
"very solid beer for sure and one i would have no issue in going back to again."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a deep caramel color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some hops. Taste is also hops a front, a bit of malts and grains. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this is a pretty good beer."
"d: A perfectly good ale all around. Nicely textured and flavored it certainly doesn't disappoint. I would have liked just a bit more complexity in the taste though"
"Reddish-brown in color, the head fades quickly. Smells sweet with some caramel malts, chocolate and some roasted characters. The flavor is big with roasted note, malts, touch of chocolate, and dark fruits. Good beer, if you like malts you'll love this."
"12oz bottle with a Best Before date notched at January 2011. Pours a dark hazel color with a thin head that dissipates quickly. Some lacing. Aroma of roasted malts, bread, and a sweet caramel maybe. Flavors of roasted malts and a hard to pinpoint sweetness. Slightly bready. This is an easy drinking beer that was part of a Smuttynose mix 12 pack. Pretty smooth and tasty."
"Pours a moderate brown color with a bit of a light tan head. Nose brings toast, caramel, light roast, hops, and a bit of earth. Taste is slightly toasted bread as well as caramel, toffee, a small amount of dark fruits, and some sweetness. Good mouthfeel and body carry the flavors. Drinks quite well and is a nice American take on the style."
"Pours a reddish-brown, slightly cloudy, has a fizzy one-finger head, high level of carbonation. Seemed odd for a brown ale, but the aroma is very malty as expected, like a porter almost. Slight hop taste, a bit of alchohol taste, but slight. Roasted, caramel malts, but not too sweet. Medium-bodied mouthfeel, highly drinkable and refreshing. This would probably be even better on-tap at a bar, seems like a decent choice with food or just by itself. An impressive Brown Ale, I personally prefer Turbodog but this is much better than a blander choice like Newcastle."
"For a Smuttynose beer this is pretty good. I usually have not been impressed with that brewery before. It has a nice reddish color that appears to be a bit cloudy. The taste is better than I would have thought, this is deffinetly not a cheaply made beer. I can pick up the hop flavor which is not over done for this style of beer. I wish there was a little less malt flavor to the beer. It almost has a Malt Liquor flavor. While I would not run out and buy a case of this, if offered another I would drink it gladly. Everything about this beer I found to be average with exception to the smell. I find the smell of this beer to be very nice. After tasting this I thinK I will give a few other Smuttynose beers a second chance."
"Mouthfeel is clean and smooth, not too thick. Pretty drinkable, even though I usually go for beers that showcase hops over nutty malt. Smuttynose makes quality beers."
"DB- A pretty good mix of Brown Ale flavors but the spice and bitter cocoa presence sort take away from it. It throws off the balance a bit and masks some of the nicer malt flavors. A pretty solid beer nonetheless."
"Overall, very solid effort by Smuttynose. Definitely give it a go if you get a chance."
"Typical of a brown ale, the beer pours with little foam. However unlike many other brown ales it does have good carbonation. The taste is dominated by a malt with a caramel taste and a subtle finish of hops. Despite not having a taste for browns, this one takes a different approach and produces successful results ."
"A murky dark brown body with fleeting, bubbly white head. Aroma of chocolate notes, earth, hops, slight roast and some vague gingerbread. Flavors of chocolate, cocoa krispies, slight roast, earth, mild spice, a bite of a sugar cookie. Medium bodied and finishes clean with only a slight sugary aftertaste."
"This would be a good choice for the fall but like I said before, there's not enough here to make it stand out from the other Brown Ales out there. It's a bit bolder and given how many Brown Ales side right down like Newcastle, that's probably a good thing. Certainly worth a shot as the fall approaches."
"This brew drinks like an old friend. Solid and flavorful without overwhelming you on any front. One of the better brown ales I've had."
"all around well crafted beverage!!!"
"A good english brown ale! Just disappointed in the appearance."
"Notes: This is a very tasty and well crafted brown ale with nice complexity."
"drinks good anytime of year, but i enjoy this most right when the summer comes to end, begining of fall. a simple, yet exceptional brown ale, gotta love that dog on the label too!"
"Gotta love the label of this brew."
"Nutty smells and a real taste for your buck. This is an inexpensive but honest brown ale that does not succumb to too much chocolatey taste or weakness, and it pretty much tops out at 6.7 abv making it a go to winner."
"D: Very good, it's a solid brown ale, with an ABV coming in 6.7%, hard to beat."
"D- A great and complex brown ale, you'll enjoy a couple of these."
"This beer pours a clear brown with 1/8 inch head that disappeared quickly. The aroma is caramel with hints of earth & plums. The flavor begins with toffee followed by vanilla & bourbon barrel notes, balanced. It has a medium mouthfeel and an increasing warming feeling as it warms, very pleasant. Old Brown Dog Ale is a good beer but not a session beer. It matched well with extra sharp cheddar chunks. Recommended."
"Good to see this guy back on the shelves yesterday. It pours a clear garnet-brown topped by nearly a finger of ecru foam. The nose is kinda faint, with notes of light brown sugar, dark wheat, light roasted malts, light maple syrup, and a touch of greens sliding up the nose eventually. The taste is also subdued, but the walnut, rye bread, biscuit, brown sugar, maple syrup, and greenery notes come through nicely, in a rather pleasant blend. The body is a light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a slightly watery feel. Overall, a very tasty and very highly drinkable brown, one of the better ones I've found out here on the East Coast."
"Alot of times I like beers,but they are expensive and I don't like paying for them.I don't mind paying for this beer because I feel It's worth the money."
"Drinkability: This is an overall terrific brown ale that features just the right amount of malt character and a beautiful floral hop profile to satisfy everybodys needs. At 6.7%, it's not overwhelming at all and goes down with little hassle. The only gripe I can find is that the mouthfeel is a tad watered down (which isn't a big deal considering the fruity finish of this beer really compliments the malt making it very refreshing). Overall, I will definetley have this one again on a cool autumn night!"
"For a brown ale at 6.7 % ABV, this is very drinkable, if not quaffable. The zesty carbonation and balanced flavor keep this one interesting; another winner from this brewery."
"Pours a clean and clear dulled brown color, minimal cap of off white head, slight lacing. Scent is light and mixes hints of roasted nuts, carmel malts and earthy hops. Taste brings more of what the scent dictates, none of the flavors are particularly bold, but they work together nicely. Lighter side of medium bodied, slightly overly carbonated for the style. A decent offering but lacks the umph of other beers in the style."
"F: Finishes still pretty sweet with lingering malts, lots of brown sugar and molases, little stickiness, some nutty flavors and little creamy porter like. Nice long finish."
"D: The beer is very easy to drink and quite sessionable."
"D-crisp and smooth nice taste which does not linger could see myself with more than one of these..unfortunately i only bought one ;)"
"D: I have no problem enjoying this pint and well, I'll have another."
"a on tap selection at Portsmouth Brewery"
"Novare Res in Portland, Maine."
"for those just discovering the style, seek out the Sumuttynose Old Brown Dog Ale and be pleasantly surprised"
"Very drinkable. A good fall session ale."
"Drinkability: One of the better brown ales I've had, definitely worth a try. I would like to have this one again."
"Pretty standard Brown Ale. Nothing remarkable, but still a drinkable beer. I am beginning to question the quality of Smuttynose, as every beer I have had from them is average or below. Worth a shot if you like Brown Ales."
"* This is also Jefe's favorite beer"
"This is a very sessionable, great tasting brew. I could easily go through a ton of this stuff. This is one of the better brown ale's I have had. Very good stuff."
"D: Ohmigod this is what brown ale should be, a slightly thin finish, superbly drinkable, and flavor of the most complex variety."
"Notes: Quite a solid beer and a great session beer as well. Cheers."
"one of my favorite fall back beers. when all the fancy overwrought beers start to wear you out, get a pint of this and see how great a simple malty beer can be."
"This is an easy drinking beer...light and tasty without overpowering the palate. A good way to start off the night!"
"Overall: A solid beer, would drink again but not go out of my way to get. Needs more mouthfeel and richer dark malt flavor. Style says it is an English Brown, but it seems more like an American Brown. Fairly bitter and little to no fruit characteristics."
"The Old Brown Dog Ale pours a copper/brown color with a small off-white head up top and not much lacing. Smell is somewhat sweet with sugar with a nice malt backbone. Some raisins are also present. Taste is some caramel, some malts, some sweetness, and a slightly alcoholic finish. Pretty good tasting beer. Mouthfeel is creamy and drinkability is solid. Would love to keep this in my fridge if it were available to me."
"Excellent mouthfeel for the style. A bit higher in ABV than you'll find in a typical English brown, but this is jam-packed with flavor while maintaining a traditional bent. I could enjoy these all night long."
"Good initiation to a brown ale for those developing their palate. A few points above what most chain brewpubs might offer. Tastes a little different each time - sometimes it's wonderful, sometimes it's an effort to finish."
"12-oz bottle. Pours golden brown with some haziness. Full head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is doughy with some wet leather notes. Medium sweetness, with some sour edges. Medium body, mouth feel on the thin side, soft. An easy drinking beer that goes better with bready foods that offset the sour finish."
"The medium level of carbonation and low to medium body worked well, but the tongue drying and salty quality of this brew was a little off putting. Overall a little less hop character would have made this beer more drinkable and enjoyable."
"Drinkability: Great easy beer to have after a long day at work. One of my favorite browns due to how easy it is to drink. Most browns I've encountered are harsh like macrobrews and I don't usually enjoy them. Smuttynose is usually pretty good about the drinkability of all their beers so I trusted them with this brew."
"d- very drinkable for a near 7% brown ale. i liked it quite a bit. this is one of the better brown ales i've had in a while"
"Pours a clear red-brown with thin cream colored head, spotty lace. Smell: toasty, nutty, fruity, toffee. Taste: vaguely fruity, toasty, hazelnut. Earthy hopping and some oat. Mouthfeel: light to medium and fairly dry and a bit minerally as befits the style. Pretty good though not something that I'll likely pick to make mine a Smutty with again."
"Well done Smuttynose. You've largely been ignored by my wallet in the past, but I think I'm going to make up for that moving forward."
"Alcohol is a little high for the style but the beer compensates well. A solid B-. Nothing fancy here, but happily drinkable."
"D- It is easy to drink if you like moderate hops but to me this is just an average beer. Its not easy nor hard to drink."
"D: Such a clean and refreshing beer. Simple and tasty, but with enough complexity to make me want more than one. With the reasonable ABV, this would be a great beer to have one or two with dinner or while hanging out watching the game. Another beer from Smuttynose that I really enjoyed."
"Drinkability - A combination of the balance and the mouth feel make this a very easy drinking beer. This is the sort of beer I would love to drink a few of in an evening, although the ABV is a bit high for a session beer. Definitely fits nicely in the English brown ale category, although I would like a more pronounced aroma. Otherwise, another great beer from Smuttynose."
"Drinkability was excellent. I would session this even though it's a touch over session strength. A nice brown ale and one of my favorites of the evening."
"All in all, as I would suppose a beer like this should be judged on how many you might want to drink... well, I wouldn't mind drinking a couple. So, there you have it. A fine enough beer, even if it doesn't change me for the better."
"I am thoroughly impressed with this beer and will probably go back for a 6-pack to keep in the fridge. There's nothing harsh about this beer. It's one that I feel I could use to turn non-interesting beer drinkers on to the world of craft beer."
"Had this on tap at the Portsmouth Brewery, so I know it was fresh. Solid brown ale, pours a dark brown color, small amount of foam, good malty flavor, has almost a nutty/coffee flavor to it as well. True to the style, the thing about most brown ales I have had, is it is tough to have a very distinctive flavor with a brown ale, but you can tell when it is a quality brew, and this definitely was. Smuttynose has never disappointed me thus far and this was no different, solid brown ale."
"Old Brown Dog was the first offering from Smuttynose that I have tried and I was satisfied with the results. This is a very good beer, easily the best English brown ale I have had to date."
"Old Brown Dog Ale is another solid beer from Smuttynose; quite enjoyable, indeed. While this isn't a style I drink on a regular basis, this would be a upper-tier contender when the mood strikes me."
"D- Good for what it is, but pretty boozey for a beer that doesn't have a very substantial mouthfeel."
"IMO the drinkability is through the roof! Even considering this is a style that tends to be very drinkable, this one stands above most. I can definitely see myself picking up a case of this potential 'go-to' porter this fall/winter."
"D- In the day of big/one off/ rare beers,I find myself gravitating towards more sessionable beers. Or maybe I am just gearing up for summer, to find beers that I can drink more than 1 or 2 of in a sitting, or maybe I prefer the prices of the more session type beers. Anyways, if you like nutty brown ales, you should enjoy this. If you're looking for something totally unique and off the charts, move on...there's nothing to see here."
"Feel/Drink: Medium bodied mouthfeel, drinkability is nice if you enjoy it."
"I didn't buy this, nor would I but for what it is it is good."
"D: I could drink several of these, though I am not sure I would like to, as I think you could find a better brown to substitute."
"This one's quite drinkable,though that alcohol kick deceives one into thinking it's got a higher ABV than it does."
"Overall: The body of the beer is a medium and the finish is medium. To me this is a typical nut brown ale nothing really standouts as something special."
"Again, this is a fine beer but not memorable."
"pours a hazy copper like color with about an inch of fluffy head with a bit of a yellow tint to it. lite lacing on the glass, some carbonation but not a lot. very hoppy and malty flavor. this beer has lots of ""flavor"" but nothing i can really single out. very enjoyable goes down smooth and easy."
"Overall, a decent brown of the English variety-pretty true to the style, although a bit thin-bodied for my tastes"
"Three bottles of this come as part of the variety pack. Poured into a pint glass. Dark brown color with a large white head. Good amount of lacing. Smell was earthy and just a hint smoky. Taste was very enjoyable. Lots of malt flavor, and a bit of brown sugar. Would have loved to have seen just a bit more body in this beer. Drinkability is high considering this is a 6.7% beer, which is well hidden. A great local example of a sessionable brown ale."
"D - Solid brown. Not the biggest fan of the style but a good representation. I would recommend it."
"D - A nice, straightforward brown ale, very sessionable."
"I feel though I could easily drink several of these, with no bitter aftertaste or cloying fullness. It is looking like a very good brown session ale."
" And this taste only helps the drinkability; although not a light beer, any alcoholic trace is mitigated by a fantastically powerful taste."
"had this on cask at my favorite local pub. dark drown in color...almost zero lacing in my tulip. smells of cinnamon and dried fruits. tastes of dried fruits..not that hoppy or malty but rather complex. easily drinkable...I could put around 4 of these down. slighty carbonated at the perfect cask temp"
"Pours a very hazy, almost muddy, dark bronze with warm red edges a small head that settles to a collar. Very distinct cocoa powder aroma with toasted and woodsy notes. Taste is sweeter than the nose would suggest (in a pleasant way), with strong toffee and chocolate notes blending nicely with a roasted nut element and an light earthy bitterness. Individually these flavors have depth, together they have harmony; overall this beer is a symphony in a bottle. I'm in awe of its taste."
"D: Fantastic brew. As of this review, it's definitely my favorite in its style. Very sessionable, regardless of the time of year."
"Part of a variety pack purchased Feb 22nd, in case you're looking for it."
"Didn't overwhelm me but it was quite tasty and I've always found brown ales a great beer for any and all occasions."
"This is rock solid and a beer I wish made it to Colorado."
"Medium body, with a slightly creamy feel. Alcohol is well hidden. A fairly simple and enjoyable beer."
"Happy Presidents' Day!"
"4.5 D: Plenty good here. I'd love to have another. If I ever get to have this again, I'll hopefully get a better looking batch."
"Clear, clean amber brown body with golden brown edges. Small, off-beige, tight-bubbled head. Nose of toasted malts, big-time caramel, cola, and a hint of molasses. Toasted malt flavors up front. Slightly nutty. Caramel and fruit notes take over mid-palate. Mildly sweet, with hints of caramelized pears and even a little alcohol. Toasted, roasted bitterness in the finish, with chocolate accents. Medium-bodied with a somewhat sticky feel. Not bad!"
"Pretty standard Brown Ale. Nothing remarkable, but still a drinkable beer. I am beginning to question the quality of Smuttynose, as every beer I have had from them is average or below. Worth a shot if you like Brown Ales."
"Drinkability- Overall, this is very balanced and quite refreshing. Would pair well with roast or burgers or some sweet dessert."
"D - yummy but not extraordinary example of one of my least favorite styles. Smuttynose can do no wrong."
"Goes down easy, tasty, but not exceptional."
"It's a ruby/mahogany brown color with a slight haziness. Light tan head didn't last too long. There's a roasted nuttiness in the smell along with caramel and slight chocolate. This sounds weird, but I also got a peppered beef jerky scent as well. Nutty taste as well along with bitter chocolate. There's the slightest hint of citrus at the very end. This is pretty good for the style, but I don't go out searching for brown ales. As a side note, I drank one of these straight from the bottle and actually thought it tasted better...a little bolder. YMMV"
"Pours a medium brown with a decent sized white head. Nice malty smell. Caramel. Taste is also malty. Toasty and caramelly. Significant hop presence. Herbal, earthy and somewhat citrusy. Very nice full bodied mouthfeel. The flavors work together very well in this. Slight alcohol warmth. Quite drinkable. An interesting and very good brown ale."
"BB burger at the grill and this beer just got better as it warms, but they drink so easy, they never really last. After taking a second look at this one, I'm hooked!"
"Drink I'd have to say a pretty easy drinking beer if you like it. I didn't care for it much but it did go down easy."
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle dated May 2010. Sampled on January 14, 2010. It pours a rich brown color with thin to little head but excellent clarity. The aroma is a bit off putting. Yeah, there is a nuttiness with a dose of hops and malts but it also has this kind of sweaty aroma. Not the best aroma I have smelled. But the taste rescues it with a medium mouthfeel, nuttiness, and a fresh hoppiness in the background. Except for the aroma in this particular bottle I found it to be a nice beer and one that I often have."
" I am sure glad I did. The color was beautiful and brown, the head was rather white for a brown ale while it lasted. Lacing was half decent... the aroma reminded me of an English Ale and was very inviting. Nuts, light chocolate, bread and caramel that tops this old dog off. I will be picking more of this one up soon. Truly a great example of a classic Brown Ale from the US. Smooth tasting, light in the belly and on the pallet. I could really put quite a few more of these down...if I had more than one."
"Over all: The beer is very true to the style. It gets the job done and quality is not compromised. I give it high marks for doing everything it was supposed to and not pissing on my taste buds. Good dog."
"Pours brown with an off-white head. The aroma is very nutty, with some English malts as well. The flavor is that of a traditional English brown ale with some biscuit and caramel malt, as well as some toasted nuts. Medium mouthfeel and low carbonation."
"Solid medium body with crisp carbonation. Very easy to drink, and I want more."
"Conclusion: I'm honestly not sure how I feel about this one. It's kind of got the dry, nutty character of a Samuel Smith's Nut Brown, with the fruity esters of a Newcastle, with stronger minerally notes and a pretty stout dry hoppiness on the finish. I'm not really sure if that all comes together to make a good beer. It's interesting, and a different take on the style for sure, but it's only moderately successful IMO."
"A very pleasant and drinkable english brown. There's nothing too intense anywhere here, and it's not offensive in any way. ABV is high for sessioning."
"Great beer, walking the line between US/UK brown ale and highlighting the best aspects of both. This is a great example of balance."
"This shows a solid dark tea colored brew with a decent tan head and an excellent, uniform blanket of lacing. The aroma brings light caramel molasses with crisp wheat nuances. The flavor brings velvetty malt toffee with very light carbonation. There's a polite citrus bitterness with wheaty character throughout. It has a distinct raspberry hint and a bit of raisin. It is medium bodied and very drinkable. Good for most any occasion."
"I've been looking for a great introduction to the brown ale style and I haven't really find my beer yet. This a relatively simple brown ale with a toasted malt profile that is not intense as some stouts. Easy to drink but not mind blowing. Can't wait to try a fresher bottle or on tap. Recommend trying this or any of smutty's beers"
"Reviewed on 10/24/2009. 12 oz. bottle. The beer pours a clear dark brown with a small off-white head. The aroma is of sweet caramel malt, rather sugary. The flavor is very similar with lots of sweet malt and nothing much else. Yep, that is all I have to say."
"The initial taste was alright but the after taste wasn't very good. The beer just seemed to end and I was left with this boring taste in my mouth. If the initial taste followed all the way through I would have been much more satisfied with this random purchase."
"D - Very, very drinkable. Smooth as ever and pleasantly hoppy. A very whole, complete beer with an unequivocally pleasant aftertaste."
"Bottle: Poured a clear deep brown color ale with a medium foamy head with OK retention and no lacing. Aroma of deep caramel malt with light notes of molasses and some grain is quite enjoyable. Taste is a nice enough mix between some deep rich caramel malt with cereal and a light subtle touch of molasses. Hops are not very apparent which might be a good thing considering the nice malt base. Body is slightly above average with good carbonation. Well done - nice session beer."
"I love the dog bottle. These guys have great labels. Pours a hazy light brown to amber. Thin head settles at about one half inch and stays there. Sweet bready malts, not a ton of hops, but some bitterness shows up at the finish. A little sweet hazlenut shows up. Nice flavors. I like this beer. I think sometimes this style can be a little boring. This has some nice well balanced complex flavors. Good beer to wash down a steak or plate of ribs."
"12 oz. bottle, with M09 notched. Brewed with pale, Munich, crystal 60 and chocolate malts, hopped with Willamette and Cascade to 15 IBUs; OG 1.060, FG 1.016. It pours a chill-hazed coppery brown hue with a thick finger of tan head. Chocolate malt and light caramel in the nose, with just a touch of hops. Tastes bready, with notes of Munich and chocolate malt, and a light sweetness on top of a medium body that finishes dry, and has a bit too much carbonation for my liking. This is a simple but delicious brew that is very forward with the chocolate malt and is well-worth a try. And with all those specs available on the website it probably would be pretty easy to try my hand at making a version at home."
"D: Very safe and inoffensive, it would be easy to put back several of these beers some evening. Another winner from Smuttynose."
"Overall, this is a pretty good beer and I am glad I tried it. I could see this being a good session beer for lovers of the style."
"Overall impression: Well-balanced and tasty brown ale."
"D - This was an okay beer for me...I enjoyed the the aroma and the finish of this beer...it really gets better as it warms...a solid beer to try from Smuttynose"
"22 oz. bomber. Pours a clear, ruddy amber-brown with a small, light tan, foamy head that diminishes fairly quickly to a film that sticks around for quite a while. Nice lacing. Smell is sweet and malty. Roasted malts, chocolate, nuts. The taste is more of the same, except less sweet than the nose suggests and there's anearthy bitterness on the finish, along with a little bit of dark fruit. There's a little bit of a musty cardboard taste coming in late that I don't care for, but it's mild and easy to ignore. The nutty character seems to build after several sips. It has a medium body, moderately dry texture and moderate carbonation. This is a decent brown ale. Nothing really impressed me, but it's a solid offering."
"D: It's pretty mellow, with some good, unexpected flavors. Nonetheless, it's missing something. I prefer American Brown Ales, and I think some stronger hops would help, but it's still fine."
"This is a very rich and flavorful beer with very nice balance (although it's a little more towards the malty side). A very easy drinking, great all around beer."
"A good beer, that reminds me of a heavy marzen."
"5.0 on drinkability, a very well balanced brown ale as it should be IMHO. A more hoppy fuller body brown, but one of the most enjoyable ones I have had to date of this style. I also appreciatte the higher ABV @ 6.7% a bit higher than most browns ale."
"D - Pretty drinkable. English brown ales aren't exactly my favorite style in the world, but this is quite a good example of the style...definitely worlds better than Newcastle."
"So.... for appearance is pretty good. my first pour was nice and slow and the head was just over one finger. the color was a solid straight brown, and little haze. the smell wasn't overwhelming but it was a typical brown ale aroma. the taste had some nutty smoky taste but it was well balanced and very drinkable. i like it."
"D - very drinkable"
"A nice Old brown ale here. Certainly drinkable and would be nice to have on hand all the time."
"Pours a beautiful dark red-brown, with a thick, creamy head that is retained for quite a while. Smells mostly of malt, with a little caramel/toffee hints. Has a nice, smooth mouth feel, and is rather sweet, with a clean finish. Taste is predominantly of toasty malts with little hoppiness. Very drinkable, delicious ale, if a little lacking in complexity."
"Easily a sessionable beer and especially for you big malt fans out there."
"A very drinkable and flavorful brown ale, definitely worth returning to."
"A well executed English Northern Brown style with an American brown strength. I'm beginning to think Smuttynose would become a staple for me if I lived in their area of distribution."
"(Bottle poured into dimpled mug) Poured a dark amber to brown color with a half finger head that quickly diminished. Toasty aroma lets you know that you will be experiencing a nice hoppy bite, and there is no disappointment. Drinks very thin with a nice dry hop bite to finish."
"D- Very sessionable english brown ale."
"This beer poured a nice clear, ruby tinged brown with no real head to speak of. A small film sits on top of this beer with not much lacing to speak of. Nose is of caramel and toffee malts, and a hint of hazelnut. Taste is starts with some sweet brown sugar, lending in to the caramel malts mixed with a hint of hop bitterness and a touch of toffee malts in the finish. Lighter body, high carbonation, goes does easily clean feel with a dry finish to it. Some what sweet aftertaste to it. This is a nice brown ale that I could sit with for a bit, but the sweetness in the aftertaste may get to me after a bit."
"Decent enough brew. Not big, not exciting, not complex; not deadly points, but the thinness & unexciting taste leave me dry on this one. But a brown that's palatable & easy to drink."
"Really great fall beer, even though I am not a huge brown ale fan. This is a really drinkable and enjoyable beer."
"Notes: This and the Star Island Single from the same mix pack certainly impressed me."
"Not much of a head, a little bit of lace, and a nice light brown color with amber showing against the light. Faint aroma of malt with a sweet caramel flavor. Pleasant but not wow-inducing. Taste is also pleasant but maybe a little too much grain showing through. The malty flavors were there but just didn't come through for me. I would have like some more depth and character. Felt decent enough but loses a point just because it didn't seem to reach every point on my palate. It's quaffable and has a pleasant flavor but I really wanted this beer to be more than it was. Definitely something I could down as a session beer but nothing to write home about."
"D: Very malty but still extremely drinkable."
"This beer pours a amber-brown color. The head is an inch in height, and recedes quickly into minimal lacing. The aroma is of caramel malt. It is very airy, and lacks any sort of complexity. The taste is fuller than the aroma, but still not as burly as one would expect from a brown ale. There is some nice toffee, and hints of dark chocolate. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, and a smooth texture. Overall, this beer could stand to gain a lot, but it isn't though. I guess I could drink it again, but there are so many quality brown ales out there that I can't see myself making it back to this beer anytime soon."
"D - High for a brown ale. Overall, this is a great example of the style from Smuttynose."
"Overall: A well crafted brown ale or any ale for that matter. Has a nice complexity and would definitely buy again."
"Drinkability: I would say its quite drinkable; its thick and it may compliment something semi-salty, like honey roasted nuts or like caramel popcorn. Its very sweet, not overwhelmingly but sweet and malty nonetheless. An occasional beer."
"T- Has a strong flavor to it. Quite malty. Can't drink a lot of it because it is pretty heavy. But definitely a solid brew."
"D - A spectacular brown ale, and an incredible value. This is a great food beer - nothing like a well-made brown ale like this to pair with a juicy burger at the pub. Also, this is an awesome beer to pair with a spicy beef brisket sandwich. A remarkably well-made beer in its own right - you'll be happy you paid so little for a beer like this."
"D: One of the most drinkable brown ales I have tried. Very enjoyable overall."
"A delightful Brown and one of the best I've had in a long, long time. Completely sessionable by many and really helps you refine your respect and admiration for brews that have subtlty like this."
"the mouthfeel in this beer isnt what i expected,somewhat watery.however,this really adds to the drinkability.this beer goes down like nothing,not like it's a bad thing though.just easy to drink,and enjoyable."
"D- Moderate. A solid brown ale, flavorful and drinkable. Would buy again."
"This is a great example of an American brown ale. Personally I think Ellie's from Avery is just a scoche better, but this will do just fine. The bottle I had was notched August '09, so I didn't get the freshest example of this offering, but it was still stellar. Smuttynose does good work and I look forward to tasting more of their styles."
"Slightly watered down mouthfeel with a nice amount of bitter hops up front that are quickly balanced by a chocolate/caramel malt presence. The body is way too thin in this beer and I found the flavor kind of boring. I think I'll stick with the bigger version, Really Old Brown Dog"
"Drinkability: Relatively high - a nice tasting beer with solid flavors that isn't too big. The price was nice too, about a buck sixty for a bottle."
"Other- This may be my favorite brown ale. Paired it with some locally smoked cheddar yesterday, it was an amazing combo."
"O: Would buy again for food pairing mainly."
"Drinkability- Very drinkable. A nice beer but I was expecting something a little more complex. I found it to be a bit of a let down."
"I'm not very knowledgeable when it comes to brown ales, but I figured I'd pick this one up, as I'm trying to learn a bit more about the style. IMHO, this beer is just as good, if not a bit better and more complex, than the famous Samuel Smith brown ale. Sweet and malty, nutty, and pleasantly bitter in the finish. A bit of noticeable warming alcohol, particularly as it comes to room temperature, despite of its relatively pedestrian ABV. An excellent, no-compromise everyday beer, particularly when you feel like taking a break from the hop-bombs that we all seem to enjoy so often."
"Another great offering from Smuttynose. This brown ale pours a cloudy, dark mahogany color with thin cream colored head. Roasted malts, caramel, and some coffee notes dominate the scent of the beer. The taste is very nutty and sweet with just enough hop flavor and bitterness. This has a very smooth, almost a creamy mouthfeel with slight to moderate carbonation making this a very drinkable brown ale. Definitely one of my favorite brown ales right now. Highly recommended with red meat or as a desert beer."
"Poured from a bottle in to a pint glass. Lively head but minimal lacing. Smelled of roasted malt. Taste was mild and good with earthy and roasty flavors with just enough hops that it balances beautifully. Mouthfeel is average, nothing remarkable. Drinkability is excellent, mild but great flavor, not too potent int he ABV, went great with grilled ribs slathered with BBQ sauce."
"D- Goes down very easy. The malt flavor hangs around."
"Great brew. I have nothing to complain about. I could easily kick these back all night. Wish we had distribution."
"So, I was very surprised by the high score of this beer! I must say, my taste buds may be off....it's summer, I've been drinking a keg of Brooklyn Summer Ale....I'll have to come back to this beer and try again in a week or two ;-}"
"Part of the Smuttynose mixed 12 pack. Pours a nice redwood color, good to head it.. not much for lacing on the glass though. Nice nutty smell to it. Taste has a nice initial mouthfeel to it, a bit on the light bodied side but very smooth and drinkable. Nice balance in this one, not too much hops by any means. Nice and drinkable.. a bit of a warming alcohol kick to it, surprising for the low ABV of this beer. An above average brown ale.. pretty good beer to quaff down in the mixed pack but still loving their IPA."
"This beer is almost blood red with a touch of brown. There's a tiny bit of light brown head that disipated quickly. The aroma is sweet with chocolate malt. The flavor is very smooth and rich. Chocolate and coffee tones with a slight hop tartness. There seems to be a bit of alcohol in the finish. The mouthfeel is velvety smooth. It simply glides down the throat. This was a very good brown ale. I would put in my top 3 favorite brown ales I've ever tried."
"D - Good as a smooth drinker this would be something that could be had more than once."
"D: This is a great example of an English brown, but the style doesn't lend itself to the bold flavors that Smuttynose is famous for. But it's smooth flavor and high drinkability will appeal to both BA's and beer newbies."
"This beer poured a dark brown with red highlights and two finger beige head. The smell is candy-sweet lightly toasted malt. The taste starts off with some caramel sweet malt that gives way to a slight burst of hops that compliments it very well and a bit of smokiness in the finish. The mouthfeel is slightly thick with a moderate amount of carbonation. This is a very drinkable beer that marries taste with good drinkability. A great example of the style."
"One of my favorite Smutty's."
"This is a wonderful brown ale, very representative of what a brwon ale should be."
" get my hands on it."
"Serving type bottle purchased from Canal's. Pours a translucent coffee color with a cotton candy head. Sexy lacing. Excellent spicy scent, punctuated with tartness and bacon. Amazing biscuity palate, maybe a little cilantro and plum. Creamy mouthfeel and long finish."
"D - this was a very good representation of a brown ale and left me wanting more. Thank goodness I bought the variety 12 pack because I think there are 2 more!"
"Flavor is great, round and full. This is a damn malty brown ale that has layers of toffee, syrup and caramel. Rich malt character, with a slight bit of roast as well. Very mild hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is smooth, with fine, behind the scenes carbonation. Despite the richness of this ale, drinkability is quite high. A great interpretation of the brown ale style."
"I like it."
"Overall a very smooth and drinkable brew. Glad I got more than one in the trade!"
"D. A very good brown ale I think they did an awesome job brewing this beer. I will try this beer again."
"Overall, a really good brown ale with nice malt flavor."
"D- Good one to drink a couple pints of at the local bar. It's nothing special, but is usually pretty good."
"I really enjoyed everything about this beer. Not too over the top, great taste and mouth feel and highly drinkable. I could enjoy just one or a few. Pours a brownish amber color as you would expect. It has a malty dry taste with a sweet smell. Carbonation is just right to complete the experience."
"On-tap at the Old Dominion Brewpub. This one was a really nice surprise. A nice brown brew, with your standard good ""brown"" flavors - big earthy malt flavors, caramel and some cookies, then mixed nicely with lightly spiced fruity hops. A nice medium sized beer that I'd get again."
"Drinkability is red flag warning, take care now, exceptionally good."
"Medium body with medium carbonation. Very drinkable. Well balanced overall."
"D: Brown ales are some of my favorites to drink with pizza. This one would be a first to grab for pizza night if it were readily accessible."
"Pours from the 12 oz. bottle an iced tea-ish brown color with a one finger light beige head that settles into a thick collar. Active carbonation. A rich aroma of malt, caramel, bread and toffee arises during the pour and hangs in the air, beautiful!! 1st sip brings all the caramel, bread and toffee to the tastebuds, with a slight hint of coffee thrown in. There's a nice hit of hops on the aftertaste, which gives balance to the sweetness. Mouthfeel is medium smoothness, and it's as sessionable as it is tasty. I've heard a lot about Smuttynose beers, and wondered if they were the real deal, or just hype. Believe me...they're the real deal!!!"
"Smuttynose Old Brown Dog Ale pours a dark brown with a thick tan head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is mostly malty, a touch of cocoa is noticeable, but there is a surprising amount of hops (for the style) that are noticeable as well. The flavor also has a touch of cocoa, lots of nutty flavor and a nice amount of hops. A really enjoyable brown ale, I'm glad we finally have it here in Florida as it was a go to beer when I lived up north. Excellent session beer."
"Poured into the center of a standard pint glass. The beer has a reddish-brown color and a good sized head of off-white bubbles. The head dies down to a thin coating, leaving a coating on the sides of the glass. There isn't much aroma to this beer, jsut a hint of something toasted. There are some hops and bittnerness to the taste, but nothing overpowering. I can also detect toasted molasses. The best way to describe it is that it tastes like a brown ale (who says you can't use the term you're defining in the definition). It has an average amount of carbonation and a light-to-medium body. I'm not generally a fan of browns, but I like this beer."
"Real nice english brown ale. Appearance of this beer is a nice amber brown color and very clear. The smell is a mild roast aroma. The taste is a wonderful malty, roasted sweetness with no real hop notes. The mothfeel is thin to medium, it's the kind of brown ale to sit and drink a pitcher of with a nice large pizza and some friends."
"d: very drinkable mild brown ale."
"A nice, solid brown ale. I drank it too cold. Great brown, and I just don't like them."
"tastes a lot hoppier than expected. If the india brown ales are ipa meets brown ale, this is amber ale meets brown ale. its hoppier and lighter than a brown ale. Its delicious, but off putting. maybe because i was expecting a nutty malty brown ale and thats not what i got. its good, and i will probally drink it again from time to time, but still its offputting."
"Drinkability: Sipping this beer is a pleasure to be enjoyed slowly and savored. I'll be having more of this beer but probably not more than one or two an evening."
"Poured from a bottle in to a pint glass. Pours a nice brown amber color. The brown is the main color which is supported by amber tones and swirls threw the beer. Forms a pretty good head with an off white color to it. The aroma is very nice and refreashing, with dark fruits and caramel malts pushing threw. The flavors where great and I feel this is one of my favorite brown ales. Dried fruits, caramel, and toffee power this brew. The carbonation fits perfect with the brew and helps force flavors threw out the pallet. The brew is well balanced and can be easily had in a session."
"3 take away most of the diacetyl and fruitiness, add some coffee astringents and youve got a sam smith clone. perhaps to style but not my thing. would prefer more texture and a chewy sweetness would be nice. lastly havent yet looked at the abv but a pitty if above 5% as that would defeat the purpose"
"If you are searching for loyalty, unconditional love and companionship in a beer then it's likely Old Brown Dog Ale is the best candidate for the job. It is a tasty, sessionable, consistent and well crafted ale that I wouldn't hesitate to rank amongst the best in show for its style. If only Smuttynose would throw me a bone and distribute it a little further..."
"I didn't love the smell, but I know I'm not a big malt smell person. It's an amber brown with a thin bubbly lacing, very malty aroma and taste (grains, roasted nuts, maybe a smidge of chocolate) that ends with a caramel sweetness. The mouthfeel is heavy like it should be with so much malt, creamy and not a dry beer at all."
"Better review than I expected."
"A 12 ounce bottle purchased at the Beer Stop for around $1.75. Poured into my shaker glass and appears a clear medium brown color with about a finger of quickly fading light tan head. Smells and tastes of roasted grains, tree nuts (hints of hazelnut) toasty bread, sweet malts, and the slightest touch of cocoa. A notch above medium in both body and carbonation. A pleasantly drinkable English brown."
"Pours a medium brown, with some amber hues, a small head and average lacing. The smell is roasted malts with some mild nutty hints. The taste is much like the smell but more prominent with roasted malts and nutty flavors, also some musky earthy flavors are present. The mouthfeel is a bit heavy from the malt backbone but this is a highly drinkable beverage. I tend to like the the more hoppy American Brown Ales but I truly enjoy this offering from Smutty."
"Definitely an easy drinker. Not too complex. Mild but great flavor profile. Another great one from Smuttynose."
"Overall this is a solid brown ale that leans more toward the toasted end of the spectrum as opposed to the buttery end, which I'm a fan of. Certainly worth a shot."
"A very drinkable beer, and easy to keep drinking if you are so inclined."
"It poured a nice big head, almost too big seeing as it was trying to jump out of the glass. (mostly my fault) I took care of that with a giant slurp. Now that it has settled down a bit, it's a nice dark amber. It's light and smooth as any brown ale should be with a nice dry, hoppy finish. Smelled sweet and hoppy. Its quite like any brown ale that I would like to have. Very mild and is kind of an anytime kind of beer."
"D: Super drinkable brown ale! Great flavors keep coming and wanting you to throw back more of this beers goodness. Mild enough to get a few down without difficulty. Would expect this to be awesome on tap. Yumm."
"Pretty much everything a brown should be, tasty and ver drinkable. I haven't had browns in a while so this is a pleasant surprise. It's wonderful to have Smuttynose available here as there IPA is one of the better of it's style I've had and Old Brown Dog does not dissapoint!"
"Final Thoughts - This beer seems to be one of their staples, and its for obvious reasons. I really disliked Smuttynose's Pumpkin seasonal and didn't give them a fair chance to prove themselves. Since I bought the mix pack, I have been enjoying them more and more. Great brown ale. One of my new favorites."
"Try Wychwood Hobgoblin for a fuller bodied English Brown"
"Drinkability - Quite drinkable, very pleasurable session beer."
"M&D--Mouthfeel was a little astringent from alcohol whose presence don't belong here, but not watery as American brewers of browns are sometimes are guilty of. Drinkability is perfect--I've heard a lot of complaints that this style is boring, but Smutty's take seems more dynamic than most. Not sure boring and simplicity are synonomous, but whatever. Anyway, I like it."
"All together not bad. This is my first English Brown, and while not unpleasant to drink, I found somewhat ""ho-hum"". This may be more indicative of the style than an indictment of this specific beer."
"D - Quite drinkable with a very nice caramel flavor. This doesn't stand out for its complexity, but as a brown ale it really shouldn't. The malt dominates but never becomes cloying and the hops balance the beer without getting in the way."
"D - I've been away from brown ales far too long; this is superbly drinkable! In all honestly it probably falls by the wayside of many other sessionable beers but the nuance of this rather tame beer are incredible and it would be an easy choice for sessioning. A beer I hope to revisit."
"D- Overall, this is a really solid Brown Ale that is tasty and is high on the drinkability scale. Recommended!"
"Overall, a decent beer. Fairly typical brown. Reliable or boring? You be the judge."
"D - Very nice, very smooth, very easy drinking BROWN ale. OMG, this is a brown ale! Wow! This one is really worth trading for."
"Reassurance that all American takes on European styles are not over-hopped and overly boozy! This has the comfortable feel of a good UK ale, with just enough bite at the end to add some distinctive character. Nice shiny amber color with a decent, fluffy head; marvelously malty nose which anticipates a mildly toasted, lightly smoky taste. Plenty of malt, of course, but not too much and there's just enough alcohol to make it taste a tiny bit tart. Affordable and definitely one to keep on hand. Not unlike Fuller's 1845-- bit lower in ABV but shares many of the same malty characteristics."
"Poured this beer into pint glass. Poured a dark copper color with medium head. There is some lacing. Somewhat biscuit like aroma. Drier malt flavor with some nice bittering hops. Medium to full mouth feel that sit niceley. Right amount of carbonation. Overall a nice balnce for an American brown."
"Pours a very nice deep brown, with some good initial head and some very nice lacing. Nice scent, very sweet and malty, though, not as deep as I like in my browns. Good taste, nice and near-balanced, with a good lean towards the sweet malty side; again, though, not as deep and thick as I like, but good. Goes down very, very smoothly, though."
"This is an extremely drinkable session brew and definitely goes down as an above average example of the brown ale style."
"D - This is a heavy beer. I found it to be very filling, and I would recommend it as a beer that you would drink in the colder seasons, perhaps with a hearty meal, such as beef stew or chili."
"I could drink this all night, I am beginning to feel like smuttynose wants to invoke all day drinking. All of their products are dangerously drinkable, especially as they warm up. Very impressive brewery."
"Served a dark crisp amber with a thin diminishing head that left very spotty lacing. Aroma was Brown malts and slight cocoa. The taste was nutty Brown malts and some pine hops in the finish with a slight bitterness. The beer is medium bodied with slight carbonation, a little heavy for the style and abv. This is a good beer for when the mood hits for a brown ale."
"D: Very solid brown ale that has a good amount of drinkability to it. This beer goes down easy, is smooth as hell, and tastes really good. Its overall solid in all categories and goes over very well. It might be a bit on the simple side, but I like that from a brown ale. Overall, I think this works well and is quite enjoyable."
"This one comes out of the tap a cloudy, almost opaque, mahogany brown. Malty aroma has hints of spices and molasses. Rich flavor is mainly malty and has tones of cloves and molasses, as well as a hint of hops and a touch of sweetness. Silky-smooth texture leaves a tasty and pleasant finish."
"overall this is an excellent brown ale that represents the english version with a slight new england twist."
"Appearance is a cloudy amber-red with a short-lived head having minimal lacing. Aroma is rather mild, but mostly grainy with a slight malt sweetness present. Taste begins with the sweetness from the malts and is followed by bitterness of the hops. Finish is dry and grainy. Too much so for my taste. Mouthfeel is pleasant and smooth. Medium body with moderate carbonation. One could easily have several of these, but overall is a bit too simple for me to desire more than one."
"The hops brought into effect make this an original take on a classic style. Whereas most brown ales seem to be a little too sweet and overbearingly malty, this one takes an opposit direction, and sometimes seems to light. My critique is I would ask for a little more malty-roasted-nutty deepness. Otherwise, nice refreshing and an enjoyable brew"
"A nice well balanced beer. Nice and tasty."
"D - The hops overpower the malt backbone a little bit to the point where i'm not sure i could drink too many of them."
"dr: very good, I could do more of these. Tasty."
"This would be killer with some fish and chips."
"I initially tried this beer because there was a cool dog on the label, but it has since become an standby. The beer pours a rich brown with almost no head. Smell is toasty with caramel with maybe a faint orange. The taste is a a toasted chocolate with a warming bite from the alcohol. Goes down easy and smooth, a safe bet from my local brewery."
"D - This is a tasty little number. I've been really impressed with everything Smuttynose has offered me so far and intend on continuing drinking their offerings."
"d-altough somewhat sweet ther dryness helps make this one sessionable"
"Overall: Highly sessionable beer. Not a bad crossover, either. I will absolutely reach for this when I'm craving some well-done malts."
"This is a nice little treat from Smuttynose. It really exemplifies the style by showing nuance and complexity without reaching past the parameters that define Brown Ales. A really pleasant drink from start to finish. Fresh malt taste with pinpoint hop bitterness. This could easily be a got to Brown Ale for me."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a light brown, almost amber in color with a thin, cola-looking head. The smell is malt forward with subtle hints of floral hops. The maltiness is a combination of sweet crystal, coffee and slightly toasted, biscuity malt. The smell is a good representation of the taste; strong malty backbone with the toasted malt and light coffee flavor dominating, with a solid hop augmentation to make for a smooth tasting, easy drinking beer. There is also a slight alcohol presence that adds to the sweetness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and the carbonation is a little thin and has a slight mouth burning sensation. Overall a drinkable beer, nothing too outstanding but not a bad beer either."
"Mouthfeel is a touch thin, but that's really not a big deal considering the flavor and high level of drinkability. Overall another solid beer from a solid brewery."
"Very drinkable. I could easily have several of these. I recently had a Newcastle Brown Ale - this is clearly a superior brew."
"D - I can do about 2 of these before I need to raise the flag"
"Easy drinker. Though a touch strong for a session beer you can easily wind up doing just that."
"D: This one goes down very easily. I've been impressed with most of the Smuttynose offerings I've tried so far, and this one is no different. A solid brown ale."
"A good Old Brown Dog is hard to come by, but when you've got one, you'll know it. This is a good one. Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy? You are aren't you? Yes you are. Yes you are. OK, that's just getting creepy now, but this is a good Brown, and I could session this anytime."
"Almost two finger off-white, cream colored head, slow to dissolve with good lacing. Amber red to brown in color, you get some orange around the rims, soft, gauzy opacity. The nose brings you caramel, butterscotch, maple syrup and fig to raisin fruit without ever feeling sweet, quiet enough nostril presence that the flowers, grains, oats and roasted chestnuts waft through swiftly, nothing falls out of place, intelligently arrayed. In the mouth it's medium-bodied, the carbonation strongest during entry, as this recedes the butterscotch, toffee, fig, date flavors come forward. Even-keeled yeast, dough notes, more coffee than chocolate although neither major. Smooth with a creamy fluidity, neither fast nor slow to move forward."
"D = Pretty drinkable, but I think one at a time is about the limit as it is really quite full tasting and feeling for the style making it on the edge of getting cloying by the end of the bottle."
"Na Zdravje!"
"Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied and goes does extremely smooth. Could definitely drink a few of these pints very easily and enjoy doing so. The sweetness is not overdone, in my opinion. A nice little dry finish balances it out. A very good brown ale, nothing out of this world but definitely solid and not lacking in any department. Drinkability is exceptional."
"Good beer, but did not succeed in keeping my attention throughout."
"D- Very drinkable. This is a good brew."
"(rated Jul 9, 2007)"
"Overall, good intensity on flavors, but not so overpowering that it would keep you from having more than one. Delicious and one for the 22 oz, as you'll open a second 12 oz anyway."
"Served into a Smuttynose pint glass (I just figured it would feel more at home) after a warm up for about fifteen minutes out of the fridge. Poured mahogany with a sparing off-white head that died to a splotchy covering quickly - a bit hazed from what appeared to be some sediment that came out at the end of the pour. A nice toasty nut aroma jumps out at me with some light roast and sweet fig. Slightly vinous malt flavors to start with some chocolate and toast - caramel and a bit of roast in the finish. Maybe a touch of spicy hop mixed in there. Mouthfeel is thin to medium with a soft carbonation; drinks pretty easy with some good darker malt flavors and a nice balanced English feel. This bottle was passed its prime by a bit - the aroma showed up the flavors. I have tasted this in better shape and know that it is a very good beer - it just didn't show its best tonight."
"Nice brown ale here. Pours with a ginger aroma and a rich brown appearance. Tastes a bit ginger, roasted caramel, toffee. This is a very, very good effort, but there are some better brown ales out there. Although I may be a bit partial considering that I own a chocolate labrador retriever. :-)"
"Overall this wasn't a bad beer but it wasn't exactly the best Brown Ale that I've had. Would take a NG Fat Squirrel or GI Nut Brown over it any day."
"D - easy on the palate while still being tasty"
"HV"
"A tasty & satisfying brown from Smuttynose."
"Overall - This is a decent beer, it just didn't impress me that much."
"Mouth feel is medium bodied and smooth. Not much carbonation. Very drinkable, but a touch sweet."
"I continue to be impressed with Smutty. This one was a touch on the earthy and hoppy side of things for what i was in the mood for, but it was an impressive brew. Beautiful with an outstanding aroma and perfect mouthfeel. A hint more of the caramel sweetness and vanilla aroma on the palette and this one would be near perfect. Still an outstanding brew and definitely worth trying."
"A very good brown from this side of the pond. If you like browns, this beer will not dissapoint."
"A good, well rounded English Brown Ale. Recommended."
"Would drink again."
"Extremely drinkable and sessionable. One of the most pleasant offerings I've come across recently. I should try more of these. And to think the only reason I picked it up is 'cause my 4-year old riding in the shopping cart thought the picture of the dog was cool!"
"D- This is hugely drinkable and spanks most other English Browns. My guess is that it would be superbly sessionable. Never tried one before this single. I am going out to buy a few sixes of this to keep on hand."
"Smuttynose beers have just recently arrived in the Triangle region of North Carolina. I picked up a bomber of their brown ale on a whim. This one pours a dark, nutty brown with a short-lived, tan head. Aromas of dark roasted malts, caramel, and a distinct nuttiness waft up from the brew with each intense sniff. The flavor is superb: it contains elements of roasted malts, intense nutty flavors, a mild, sugary sweetness, just a trace of hoppy bitterness at the finish, and a lingering malty aftertaste. Honestly, this is one of the best brown ales I've ever come across. Period. So many tend to focus on the darker, dry style; this one is sweeter and has a stronger ""brown"" essence. Simply delicious."
"Nothing wrong with this brew, but I'd much rather have a sam smith before this. This is just a little bit better than newcastle."
"A true pleasure to drink"
"Pours a soapy head that disappated quickly. Smells of tarty plums and fruity esthers. Smell is nice. Taste a bit overdone. Really tart flavours come through with nice bitterness at the end to round out. Don't know if the bottle was too young or what, but I was not overly impressed with this one. I will try it again, without hesitation, but not a bad beer, but not great, either."
"I poured a 12 ounce bottle into my SA pint glass. The beer pours a very pleasant color of brown. It has a medium sized white head, and the beer itself is some what transparent to light. The smell is of sweet barley. The beer has a ""bready goodness"" to it, not overly sweet. A light bodied beer, that is well balanced and easily drinkable."
"Fairly clean in the finish. A bit dry as well. Browns are one of my least favorite styles but this one was okay. Its a good session beer but I would prefer something else. Good for a brown."
"Smuttynose never fails me. They continually release flavorful, drinkable beers. It's a very consistent, excellent brewery. This is a solid, all-around brown ale. Definitely one to pick up if you run across it."
"The beer is moderately carbonated, and fills the mouth without attacking it. A very pleasant quaff. A tad strong to drink more than a few, but those few will go down oh so easily."
"D: This is one of the better example of an brown ale - especially by an American brewery. A well made, drinkable beer."
"Smooth, creamy and a little sweet bu dry at the finis."
"Pours a nice deep amber with a creamy three finger head. Smells of thick, rich malts with hints of darker roasted malts. Wow...delicious in the mouth, layers of malt with crisp roasted flavors of particular intrigue. Malts are balanced nicely with a snap of hop bitterness. Overall a really nice and distinctly American brown ale. I fear some of the poorer reviews are due to less than fresh samples."
"Out of a smuttynose sampler pack that my dad bought. Pours dark brown with a little whitish head and intermittent lacing. Smells malty, nondescript. Taste is a sweet maltiness, slightly interrupted by a rush of carbonation. Some vague chocolate, hint of a grassy hop in the background. Medium bodied, not bad, but not particularly memorable."
"This beer poured a clear brown color with a thin tan head that didn't bother to stick around. The aroma was malty and somewhat sour. The taste was malty and very typical brown ale like with a touch of spice and sour notes. The mouthfeel is thin to medium bodied and carbonated. Overall, this is an average brown ale. For some reason, it doesn't seem that this beer came together - flavors just didn't meld."
"Drinkability: This is a very drinkable brown that I will return to."
"This was just so-so. I've heard good things about Smuttynose, but this was not all that memorable. Worth a shot, and I'd have another. Just ended up being a bit murky-tasting for my taste; nothing really stood out."
"12oz. bottle: This one pours a fairly clear, brown color. There was a bit of a tan head on it that dropped away rather quickly. There is a nice nose to it. Caramel, roastiness, perhaps a bit grassy, nutty and a hint of chocolate. A well rounded flavor. Caramel and chocolate notes, but very subdued sweetness. A hint of bitterness in the finish. A very nice beer."
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a wide-mouthed glass. Reddish-brown body with Virtually no head. Some caramel notes in the aroma, sweetness and no hops. Flavor was malt-driven with bready and caramel notes; no hops. Mouthfeel was light to medium. Overall, a decent beer, but to me, not a lot going on. Nothing overpowers, but nothing really seemed to shine either."
"Every drink made me want one more. A great combination of malt flavors, gave off a caramel and slight nutty taste. Very smooth texture, and very easy to drink. No stand out hops or spice which was a big plus. Just a very solid beer that had it right. A 6-pack would be perfect. Try it."
"Served in a tumbler. Poured an almost opaque brown; however, substantial light penetration allows for maroon highlights when backlit. Half inch, tight tan head quickly dissipated into a thin band around the perimeter of the glass and a broken film of foam; no lacing adhered during the tasting. Nose is predominantly chocolate malt. Taste follows nose with a little nuttiness and a subtle hops presence (no bitterness presented). Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and lively. Extremely easy drinking english brown."
"Great medium-fullish feel, nice carbonation, great drinkability."
"Pours a clear brown with an off white head. Aroma is medium sweet caramel, nuts and toffee. Flavor is much of the same but a bit fruity as well. Medium bodied, slick mouthfeel. Finishes medium and a bit astringent. A middle of the road Brown Ale and not Smuttynoses best offering."
"Feel is just about right for a brown ale. Plenty of carbonation for a crisp and clean finish. Drinkability is pretty good, would be a bit higher if the sweetness were toned down."
"D: Unfortunately since the Smuttynose porter is so good most will pass this one by for its more acclaimed big brother. However this is a very good beer in its own right."
"D: A fantastically sessionable brown ale that hits all the right marks and manages to be an immensly satisfying beer while following a simple and tidy course."
"Purchased as part of ""build-your-own-six-pack"" at local grocer. Poured a small foamy head on a dark amber body. Smelled floral, very sweet, and very caramelly. Taste was exactly the same, with medium hoppiness. Coffee flavor poked through as it warmed. Came across as kinda flat. Admittedly, this is not one of my favorite styles, but I really didn't find anything overly exciting about it."
"Pours a dark brown body with a nice tan head with some staying power and a nice bit of lacing. A pretty good Brown ale with a good compliment of a spicey hoppy flavor with sweet malty notes. It is however a little too sweet and sugary. It's a decent beer though and I wouldn't pass one up if offered."
"Khaki colored head dissipated quickly. Barely retains a tiny ring that laces surprisingly well for as lacking as it is. Clear cherry wood color. Soft sweet malt aroma, augmented by a fresh leather hint with very, very subtle hops undertones beneath. More depth in the flavors than the aroma suggests. Roasted/toasted grains, toffee and caramel notes. Nicely balanced. Moderate to high carbonation with a good but not great mouthfeel. The hops finish is pronounced and pleasantly cutting. A very good brown ale."
"Drinkability - This one is very drinkable because it tastes so damned good, it's a bit heavy which keeps it from being perfect, but wow, I'm impressed! a great Brown Ale."
"I had this on cask this evening @ once and for all. It pours a browninsh amber with a slight white head. The smell is of nuts and malts. The flavor is very nice with a nice nutty flavor, this cask was dry hopped so you get a nice hop flavor as well, there is also alof of nice malt flavors to fill this beer. The mouthfeel is very pleasant and this is a very drinkable cask, well done!"
"The feel is gritty and chewy, but also creamy and milky. Leaves a milky film. A nice, gritty brown ale. Full of flavors, though they are a tad on the rough/harsh side. Still, not bad."
"A pretty good brown ale, all in all. Pours translucent brown with a medium head and nice lacing. The smell is fairly strong, solidly dark malt. The flavor is pleasant and slightly sweet, with a nice roasted malt base - a little smoke, a little wood. There is a pleasing astringency on the finish that clings ever so slightly to the tongue. This is a highly drinkable brown ale, as comfortable, dependable, and mellow as an old brown dog."
"D: Decent brew with moderate alcohol. Not interesting enough for me to session though it'd be a candidate."
"This is one of those beers that is a classic example of true-to-style American craft beer, (even though its an English Brown Ale.) Its well done, with surprising subtleties."
"part of a mixed 12 from Whole Foods Reston, by which I've been nothing less than impressed (the mix-pack, the whole foods is relatively weak), notched as best by November '08"
"This drank way too easy, very nice English brown!"
"Drinkability: Great! Very complex in the flavor department with a really full and interesting malt bill. Low in alcohol. Kicks Newcastle's butt."
"T/M/D - low on carbonation, but a bit chewy on the tongue, but smooth and relatively light tasting. It doesn't bombard the taste buds and the taste doesn't linger too long. Not bad!"
"Pours with a tight, fresh-looking head atop a body of light molasses brown. Wonderful aroma redolent of bread crust, rich caramel malts, and some light, earthy hops. Just a touch, not offputting, of band-aid. On the palate, surprisingly thick on the tongue, with light carbonation. The first impression is of sweet malts, followed by a crusty baked note and a parting note of herbal bitterness. Overall, this is an excellent example of an English brown ale, although I would have appreciated a bit less alcohol and a bit more sessionability. Still, very well done."
"D: Drinks alright, but there are better browns..."
"D: I regret buying only one."
"Serve it with grilled food and rich sauces, or by itself for a dessert. No matter, just make sure you try this beer some time."
"This is a great brown ale, very rich and full tasting. Tons of roasty, caramelly malt, but not overly sweet where you can only handle one or two. Carbonation seemed little high for the style, but worked for me. A solid dark brown ale."
"I liked this beer quite a bit. I would have liked it to be a bit brighter since it was a tad lighter and I could see though the glass. A tad more carapils for better head retention would have been nice also, but this beer is definitely tasty in a good way. I don't know about the English Brown Ale classification, I would more consider it an American Brown Ale because I detected a nice hop bite."
"A nice version of the style, though as others have said it is a bit thin body-wise. Love the flavors, caramel with slight roasted taste. Very session-able brew."
"D - easy drinking, good tasting brew."
"M/D- Medium/Thin body, very pleasing and relaxing. Extremely drinkable, this is a damn good brown ale."
"This is a tasty brew and a very solid drinking brown ale, perhaps one of the best I've had. Succeeds huge in the taste department where other iconic English Browns (Newcastle) tend to be a bit lighthearted."
"Pours a clear reddish brown color with a 2 finger tan creamy head with good retention and solid lacing. Aromas of roasted malt, caramel, and dark fruit. The up front taste is of hops which get taken over by molasses and roasted malt then finish bitter with a sweet malty aftertaste. The alternating flavors or bitter & sweet are wonderfully balanced. Creamy mouthfeel with a medium body and light to medium carbonation make this a wonderfully drinkable beer. Great example of the style."
"Medium body, good carbonation and easily drinkable. Recommended for it's uniqueness. The sweetness of this beer surprised me a bit."
"D: Enjoyable and easy to drink. Carbonation withstanding, worth re-reviewing."
"Pours a rich auburn brown with a bubbly light tan head that quickly dissipates to a thin froth. Pleasantly crisp, the flavor is molasses and coffee... not too sweet, not too bitter. It seems well-balanced and crisp... a very friendly, drinkable beer. I think it might be nice with grilled meats or barbecue."
"d: Thanks to DrDogbeer for this one. This is quite refreshing and nicely balanced."
"D: A nice combination of mouthfeel and taste makes this beer pretty drinkable. Good beer overall. Definitely worth a session if you can get your hands on one."
"A slight coolness of alchohol noted as well."
"too good, this is a beer that could get me in trouble, I had 4 in 1.5 hours, had to switch it up"
"D: It was an enjoyable easy to drink beer. It had a great malt base, decent mouth feel, and modest ABV making it a good candidate for a long session."
"Another great offering from Smutty. Always a safe bet and a staple in my fridge. A great session beer, perfect to pair with a variety of foods or to enjoy on its own."
"Pours a dark amber, medium brown color with plentiful off-white head. Aromas are full of toffee, chocolate, dark caramel, very Tootsie-Roll like. No hop notes detected. Flavorwise, much the same, a robust bready and chocolaty mouthfilling flavor dominates. Carbonation is medium low and the finish is malt heavy, but not very sweet. Very little in the way of fruit esters, which is more indicative of an English style and abv puts it out of style as well. However, it isn't hopped to American standards so it doesn't really fit either style, though it is a delicious brown and a very easy drinker."
"my next one was this ; pours a deep copper brown color w/ a thin off-white head which lasts a while leaving a moderate lacing in my glass ; a light smell, mostly dark caramel malts and fruits w/ a faint alcoholic note in the finish ; a dry, tart and nutty flavor w/ a mild hop bite and some faint raison/date undertones, a bit of floral hop flavor in there as well ; drinks a bit thicker than your avg. eng. brown, co2's right, just a little too full bodied to make it a 4 ; a quite drinkable brew, an excellent session beer, i'll def. have this one again..."
"Poured a leather-couch brown into my mug with decent carbonation and minimal head. A good malty smell, with something like bread and other malts (nothing specific) coming out, on top of hops with very minor citric notes. The taste is very malty, with coffee, roasted and toffee malts all seemingly coming out. Caramel and/or honey in there too to round out the medium/slightly heavy body. Goes down smooth with a semi-sweet finish as the hops appear to add a little fruitiness(apples or cherries) and on the backbite for slight dryness. This is a quality beer and if you're lucky enough to find it a bar buy a round, and if you're lucky to find a six-pack buy it and split with buddies."
"A deep amber and chestnut color, with a quater inch high head, that is beige in color. A strong nutty fragrance, with malty sweetness, with the scent of cherries at the end. The malty sweetness rolls across the palate with caramel and nutty flavors, and finishing with a mild bitterness of grass at the end. A medium bodied at the front, it gains a more hefty feel as it rolls across the palate. This is a very good brown ale, the strong flavor and aroma, makes me want to get out the grill and through a steak on. Because, this would be great with a steak."
"Poured into mini-heffe glass at 08 Long Island Craft Brew festival. Earth brown and thick and foamy tan head at the start but disapated into a partial cap head. Smell had mild hops and sweet caramel character. David Yarrington, the Master Brewer told me that it was too cold that day due to being inside a hockey arena/cooler rather than at a bar but it still was mighty fine and was 5.2%ABV not 5.7% A single malt base with malty backfinish and again mild hops. excellent mixture. Will grab for this one without a second thought the next time."
"Dark red amber appearance with eventual good lacing. Their were slight malts smelled but nothing too noticeable. The taste had a better sense with the malt taste and offered a good spicy kick to it. Weak body but it was still a little smooth to drink. Overall, it was just decent."
"M/D- my favorite brown ale has been Dogfish Head's Indian Brown, but that is a bit more bulkier in taste, body, and alcohol. The Old Brown Dog on the other hand is a very drinkable/session type beer with a great flavor."
"D - Highly drinkable would make a great session beer IMO. For the price it would be hard to find a better brown ale."
"The taste is nice and rich and at 5.7% its not your typical low alcohol ""session"" brown ale. Its got a lot of malt taste with a hoppy tanginess that comes through at the finish. A solid brown ale and another great year-round release from Smutty."
"D - Not bad, but not an all time favorite... A solid offering that I'm happy I tried, but not sure I would seek out again..."
"Taste is predominately roasted malt with a decent chocolate presence, some nuttiness, fairly creamy mouthfeel for a brown ale which is something that is often lacking."
"Notes: I have tried a few Brown ales and my love with beer began with a trip to the Brooklyn Brewery in which I tried their Brooklyn Brown Ale and as they say ""the rest is history""."
"A pretty solid, drinkable brown ale, definately on the upper end of the American-made English Browns. Could definitely see this one making a return to the fridge rotation."
"Drinkability : very good beer in the style American brown ale"
"Not bad for a brown ale."
"More of a mid fee butl I would like to see a bit more body for style. Overall though I am impressed with a easy drinking beer to drink night after night."
"D: The beer had great drinkability from start to finish and enjoyable in multiples."
"Mouthfeel is medium with sufficient carbonation, drinkability is still hampered for me by the amount of darker malt flavor in this one--its all very good and I highly recommend, especially if you like darker malts, but I couldn't have two or more of these in a row."
"Good stuff from Smuttynose... Worth a shot..."
"This is one good session brew, or for a tasty treat."
"Dark brown body with brown three-finger head befitting a rootbeer...head settles quickly...slightly opaque...light fruity esthers with a malt balance that is pleasant...slightly effervescent palate that tucks into the tongue with a medium body... a nice compliment to a meal or fine as a stand-alone...always looking for a solid brown ale, I believe Smuttynose to have crafted this nicely with a combination of mellowness and substance...."
"To be honest I was expecting a little more from this beer. I knew not to expect Sam Smith's Nut Brown Ale (Maybe the finest example of this style), but I thought it would at least be as good as New Castle. It was drinkable enough, and although it could be a good session beer, I'd rather drink New Castle. Not too impressed, and I probably wouldn't buy this one again."
"what happened? this is a pretty fresh bottle (""best by"" date is listed as a whole 6 months from now), so i doubt it's a bad batch..."
"M + D: Smooth drink... rather slick, and finishing quite clean. Just shy of what I might session - but, then again, perhaps not. An enjoyable drink, and I'm going to follow this one up with another."
"This beer pours a dark amber color with a an off white short head that laces the glass very nicely. It has an aroma of roasted malts and hops and a hint of nut in there as well. The taste is very good with the roasted malt base balanced out with a hoppy bitterness followed up with a sweet nutty flavoring that makes this beer very nice. It has a good crisp mouthfeel and the drinkability is good as I could have a few of these in an evening."
"D very good, if a bit smoky, I will be having at least two when I go back for Bingo night."
"Decent beer that I would have again, but nothing I would search out."
"D - Good example of the brown ale style, and very sessionable."
"Pours an amber-chestnut color with an off-white head that falls quickly. The nose is sweet and toasted with fruity grapes and some grassy hops. Toasted malts dominating the taste. The sweetness is light, of caramel grape, and cocoa, with a mild earthy nuttiness. Nice light/medium body and creamy mouthfeel. A well balanced and easy drinkin' offering of the style. Well done."
"drinkability - Pretty good brown ale. I had the Big Beer Series, I believe it is the same."
"Great looking mahogany body with a nice off white head. Crisp malt aroma. Good caramel sweetness and a bit of toffee. No detectable bitterness. Leaves a nice malty taste on the tongue. Good medium body. All around a great brown ale, even if my homebrewed brown ale did beat it side by side :-)"
"Drinkability: Not the most diverse beer out there, but did however have session written all over it. I wouldn't mind having another one these. That is one that wasn't expired for at least 5 months. That was my fault. I forgot I had it."
"Smuttynose Old Brown Dog Ale is overall an excellent beer. The rich brown apperance and the light head make for a nice look. The appearance really shows it's full bodied flavor. The smell is rich and dark with hints of nut,chocolate, and carmel. The taste is slightly on the bitter side, but highly rich and full. The mouthful is crisp for the richness of a beer with very little carbonation. Drinkability is not even a question!"
"Pours a very slightly clouded dark amber brown. Nose is slightly nutty. Flavor is on the bitter side. That nut edge comes through too, but doesn't seem to do anything good for it. Feel is thin. Not a lot of carbonation. Drinkable? I guess. Without even checking, I know I appreciated this much more on-tap. Oh well. Experiment over."
"I kept it at approximately 11psi and 45° and it produced a beautiful ½"" of head every time. ...and I made sure to pour some out for Olive."
"Smuttynose Old Brown Dog pours a light brown with an thin head. The aroma is malty, dark caramel, chocolate and some roastiness. The flavor is crisp, starting out with a nice light hop flavor and working into a rich maltiness. The finish is crisp with a mellow bitterness."
"Smuttynose Old Brown Dog Ale has dark brown body with light, wispy head that disappears fairly quickly. Traces of the head remain on the glass. The smell is of toasted malt. Taste is similar with a full malt sweetness with hints of chocolate. There is a hopiness that stays in the background but provides a distinctive note. A very drinkable brown ale is the result."
"Pours a clear orange brown, thick off white head forms, settles down pretty quick to a thin layer but leaves lots of lace. Perhaps a little bit too red for my tastes but still looks okay. Smell is caramel, light roast, honey, grass, some light floral, grains and lemon. Taste is nice, light caramel, nutty middle, some grass, citrus, bit of bread and floral, fruity bitter finish, very grainy aftertaste. Mouthfeel is light bodied with low carbonation, smooth and easy to drink. Nothing special but a solid English brown."
"All in all a very drinkable beer, best on tap. Good fall beer, best in a draft glass."
"Pours a ruby brown color with an average tan head that dissipated into a thin ring around the glass. The smell is of lightly roasted malt; has kind of a woody & milk chocolate aroma to it. The taste has toasted & roasted malt characteristics, followed by a bitter hop edge, though the malt takes front stage. The feel is moderate with moderate carbonation. I wouldn't call it a smooth brown ale as it has an initial malty bitterness but it finishes fairly neutral. A good brown ale, definitely worth a try."
"Pretty solid brew. An extra hoppy brown ale, nicely balanced between sweetness and bitterness. Not as much head as I expected, solid tan body, hoppy nose and tasted mainly of piney hops. Nothing special, but pleasant enough. I guess I shouldn't expect too much from a brown ale."
"Mahogany color with an off-white head. Aroma of brown malt and a little caramel. The head was thin but persistent, and clung to the glass; showing each previous water-mark that I had last drank from. Flavor was fairly two dimensional with some caramel and mildest hazelnut. Finished slightly sweet with a medium body. An easy conversation beer."
"Give these guys props for not going crazy with the hops and not being to sweet with the malts. This beer would go well with grilled red meat."
"Pours a cola brown, solid inch tan head that slowly settles to a thin cover. Mild carbonation. The aroma is full, rich, sweet and smooth along with the flavor. Rich sugary malts up front with a very well balanced hop finish. Perfect english brown ale: malty and rich with a subtle, yet apparent aroma hop added to keep the sweetness in check. A great brown ale IMO."
"Overall one of the better browns I've had, and another excellent brew from SN."
"I'm not sure if my bottle was a fluke or if it's normally carbonated like this. I wish it was a bit more, but it's still a nice tasting beer. Certainly worth drinking if you like the style."
"Drinkability: Great session beer."
"Pours a deep mahogany with a creamy, beige head that reduces fairly quickly but leaves a nice lacing behind. Pleasant smells of caramel and, it seems, perhaps candied dates and figs. The taste is a knockout -- sweet, toasty malts, again reminiscent of candied dark fruits and toffee. Hints of alcohol and a nice little hoppy twinge in the finish. Satisfying medium-bodied mouthfeel. I could certainly drink this all night. An outstanding brown ale -- one I feel lucky to be able to find regularly living in New England."
"You have to down this one when it warms up a bit, though. There's really no point in drinking it straight from the icebox."
"D: Easy to drink -- almost too easy which I think is a reflection of its thin, light body."
"Pleasant, but rather simple."
"Just had this at the Publick House in Boston last night. Was definitely and above average beer. I ordered a burger and asked the waiter for a good compliment. He advised a brown ale and I tried this one. It was very smooth, but did not have a terribly strong taste. Very drinkable, but not a lot of punch to this Brown ale.."
"BTW--If you like Grotten Brown, try Old Dog, or if you like Old Dog, give Grotten Brown a shot."
"The drinkability was very good. This beer is surprisingly smooth and very easy to drink."
"It had a nice amber color when pouring into a pint glass, but little head. It had a nice nutty and faint chocolate smell. It had decent mouth feel, but the after taste was not great. Was it worth the $8.50 for the six pack, not really, but it was worth a try."
"This is an extremely flavorful and well-balanced brown ale. The sweet nutty flavor is complimented by a subdued hop profile and a nice dry, dark chocolate flavor. Mouthfeel is medium and creamy, not too carbonated. A very drinkable brown ale, at that. Perfect beer to kick back and relax with."
"Smuttynose Old Brown Dog is an easy to drink mellow brown ale with a lime citrus hop that's in the flavor and aroma. Many have found a fondness for it after the very first bottle they try. A mellow chocolate malt and a fig fruitiness round out the flavor and aroma profile. The carbonation has a smooth medium mouthfeel and is great right out of the bottle. Pairs excellently with anything roasted as the caramelized flavors match while the carbonation and lime citrus clear the palate for the next bite. A dessert match would be chocolate pecan pie. Also a great beer to session with and stick to for the length of any party, bbq, boat trip, camping trip etc. etc. etc.... Very consistent whether sampled on-tap, bottled or growler. A NH classic."
"Pours a chestnut brown with an okay head that fades to a ring. The smellis malty, dry, and maybe just a little nutty. The same dry malt is present in the taste, as is the nuttiness. There is also a touch of caramel and raisins. A hint of sweetness in the taste, but nicely restrained. Smooth mouthfeel, dry rather than creamy. Nice mellow brown, very pleasant and drinkable."
"Pours a nice looking amber/brown color, with a fat two-finger faintly off-white head that forms at the top of the glass and lingers for a while. Gives some good lace as well as it recedes. The aroma is a classic brown ale smell: nutty, with some smooth malt character and distant hints of chocolate and coffee. This aroma is subtle, but really nice. The taste follows suit, serving up some subtle nut and coffee flavors, with a slightly fruity (cherries and raspberries) background. Mouthfeel is layered, but smooth, with a nice bitter finish. An exceedingly drinkable beer. I am so glad that there are some fine American craft breweries out there doing styles like this very well. This is a great brown ale, and both fans and skeptics of the style should give this one a try. This would go great in a rich Autumnal beef stew, and would make an excellent beer-burger as well."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability / Notes: Smooth and medium to light mouthfeel. Moderately carbonated. Its an easy drinker and a solid offering by Smuttynose. If I was a bigger fan of brown ales Id likely have this on hand regularly."
"This one pours a very nice ruby tinged brown with a fairly thick off white head which dissipates slowly and leaves some lace. The smell is rich and malty with a touch of caramel, butterscotch, nuts and dates. The taste is a full malt profile ranging from some buttery light malts to caramels to a touch of roasted dark malt things stay sweet but are balanced by a sharp bitter finish provided by the hops whose flavor is very subdued. A fair bit of alcohol comes through as well. The mouthfeel in nice great full body with a pleasant finish that is not too dry or too sweet. Drinkability is good, maybe not my favorite English brown ale but still a top notch American made example of the style."
"Smells of all those delicious brown malt flavors -- candy sugar, chestnut, cocoa. Yum. The taste is very malty, with a tiny bit of fruity ester and bitter hop keeping it from being a dubbel. A little too boozy for the ABV -- I feel that with all of that malt, it should be better hidden. I guess that's what's keeping me from saying that this is my favorite brown ale ever. Oh well -- it ranks up there -- if only it were a little more drinkable..."
"Pours a nice slightly cloudy dark golden brown color, nice carbonation, tiny fizzy off-white head, some sticky lacing follows. The nose is malty, toasty, and some caramel. The taste is a nice toasted malty flavor, with a good dose of caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, a nice little Brown Ale. Glad to have had a chance to try it out."
"I bought a six-pack of this one because it sells very well in my store (I work at a local grocer). It pours a tad darker than I would expect from a brown ale, though my only real basis is from New Castle. LIke other brown ales, it has a slight nuttiness to it that is welcomed by the taste buds. Of the multiple beers I've tried, I would have to say this is one of the most drinkable I've had except for maybe Boddington's Pub Ale which if I'm not mistaken is supposed to be quaffable. For anyone looking for a nice ale, this Smuttynose is a great choice. (I've even recommended it to a few customers)"
"D: Nice to drink - a likable, sipping brown ale. I enjoyed how the mouthfeel developed and definitely liked the lasting toasty bitterness. A good one that I'd like to have again. Thanks, John."
"This is a great beer to session. Dark chesnut brown with off white head. This beer did not have much of a nose, but what was there was a nice smell of malt. The taste followed up the nose lots of malts with a crisp clean dry finish. Spot on for the style. The mouthfeel was a bit on the thin side and the drinkablity as with all good ales in this style is exceptional. An easy drinker that I will have again."
"nice nice nice. really nice example of a good brown. pours a sweet amber brown with an off white head. good lacing. smells sweet and slightly like someone previously mentioned, dried fruit. very smooth taste, slight citrus notes. really well balanced. everything i look for in a brown and from new hampshire ! great beer, i could drink a billion of these...possibly in one sitting...."
"I like this offering from Smut! Its refreshing and not overly sweet.The hops are floraly and inviting in the taste.One good brown"
"Medium-bodied and sweet. Very well balanced- a solid brown."
"12oz bottle. Pours a light brown - almost a cloudy dark gold when held up to light. No carbonation evident. Medium malty aroma. The flavour profile feels pretty typical for the style, with the focus on middle-of-the-road malts and not really that much else. I think I should give up on sampling brown ales, because I seem to feel the same way every time, and rarely has anything stepped up to be distinctive."
"Just a nice beer. A little on the sweet side, but just a good beer. Its very well balanced, and was damn easy to drink. I enjoyed the various complimentary relationships & weighs and measures in it. Would pair well with a simple red meat, any bar food, cheese but nothing too strong...ahh, a cheeseburger & fries would be killer! We need beers like this to just have and to drink and enjoy, and enjoy more than one. Certainly a worthy beer of anyone who enjoys a well crafted, albeit simple, brew. Check it out."
"A very nice high quality, refreshing English brown."
"Drinkability- From the aroma to the taste, I would say this beer is drinkable for the style it represents."
"Pours a darkish brown amber with some ruby hues when held to the light. Minimal head but what's there leaves a touch of beige lacing around the outside of the glass. Pleasant malt aroma is just a tad sweet smelling, with a bit of caramel but mostly roasted malts and a nutty scent. Malts take the stage on the tongue, as well...again roasted malts and some nutty flavor with a nice hop balance on the back end. This is a crisp, medium-bodied and tasty brown ale that makes a great session beer."
"Drinkable brew for sure."
"The mouthfeel is rather smooth. Extremely drinkable. A near perfect session brew."
"Don't drink and review."
"Purchased recently as a mix pack in Northport. Pours a dark clear brown with a moderate heads that sticks around. Smells a bit musty and malty, not too strong. Tastes nice, a good nutty malt caramel flavor with a hint of grass liek hops. Mouthfeel is a bit thin and fuzzy. But overall, pretty good, especially for a brown ale. Usually I find this style a bit lacking, but this one is really good."
"For a smuttynose, this one is not up to par. The smell is musty, a little tinny, it did remind me a little of a wet dog ... not too good. The color is dark, rich, amber, clear, with not much head. Okay on the carbonation front. The taste ... hmmm. Decent mix between hops and malts, on the dry side, a medium balance and texture. The taste has some fruity complexity, there are difficult to discern flavors in this beer, maybe a little on the coffee/chocolate side of the taste spectrum, but I remain unimpressed. It's okay, but not worth returning to and a bit of a disappointment coming from Smuttynose, which has made some excellent beers in the past."
"This beer could be Lucky Lady #2."
"Smuttynose has positioned itself as my favorite New England brewery. Old Brown Dog continues to solidify that reputation in my mind. OBD is a wonderful brown ale. It pours a deep brown with a hint of red (similar to the label background behind the dog), with a nice, modest, but persistent head. The smell is malt all the way, with toasty slightly molasses notes. The taste is of sweet, slightly molasses, but not overly so, taste buds respond happily to each sip. And each sip leaves me thirsty for the next. Good, even body, with good level of carbonation allows this beer to coat my mouth and leave a hint of malty sweetness lingering in my mouth."
"-Oelergud"
"drinkability: this beer confused me. I got an initial taste and smell of something nice, but the head died and the aroma went with it. The flavor seems dominated by the dry sensation. Its a good beer, one ill likely try again just to compare."
"D: Tasty, goes down easy, not very filling, good representation of style, it’s a very ordinary beer, but it’s a good beer to pound."
"D - A very drinkable brown, nice malt easy to quaff - recommended."
"Pours a light reddish brown, with a thin light brown head. It smelled malty. It tasted malty sweet, but was dry in the finish. It was smooth on the tongue, not too carbonated. This would be a decent session beer. Not as good though as some other Smuttynose beers."
"Overall impression: Very nice, very drinkable. This is a solid brown ale - great session beer."
"D---A delicious example of what brown ale was intended to taste like."
"This beer is a good example of the style. It has balance and subtlety and is eminently drinkable."
"D: An all day beer ... a good session beer. Mixed well with my grilled chicken salad. Also worked REALLY well with my garlic bagel chips! :) If you like browns, check this pup (no pun intended) out!"
"pours meduim brown with a light tan one finger head that fades fairly quickly to a ring on the glass but with a nice lacing to the finish.smell is roasted malt, caramel, brown sugar. taste is sweet, caramel, toast, with some nut bread flavor, all malt on hop. mouthfeel light, good carbonation. drinkability all night long."
"Into a pint glass, pours a nice solid brown, with good head that fades a little quick and some decent lacing. Aroma is a solid layering of roasted malt, a little lame duck at first but growing with some chocolates and nuts later on. Taste is slightly better, more strength, solid malty goodness, and little hop intrusion, a standard brown done right. A solid body and even carbonation lend a good mouth to a very drinkable session beer."
"Solid brown all around. Another good beer from Smutty that would be an excellent session beer."
"D- Highly drinkable, a great beer for all night drinkin'."
"d- a nice session beer that is easily repeatable"
"Sweet Jesus, is this awesome. Hoppy, flowery aroma, and taste, with a sweet, chocolate malt flavor that kind of snuck up on my after about 6 or 8 sips. This was almost sensory overload, as it was great to smell and drink it. I could drink this all winter, right in front of a fire (the 5.9% ABV helped). My wife seemed to like it too. Unfortunately, this is a New Hampshire-based brewery, so it's probably only available in the Northeast (I found this in an LCBO near Toronto)."
"Not my favorite style, but this is one brown ale I would never turn down. Pretty sure my sniffer is working fine today, so I'm kind of amazed by the lack of character in the aroma. Otherwise this is real solid."
"This one poured a dark ruby brown color with a nice off-white head. Mild lace clinging down the pint. Smells of roasted malt with a hint of nuttiness and a mild hint of hops. There are also slight tones of chocolate and caramel mixed in. Big roasted malt taste up front followed by a mild hint of caramel malt in the back of the mouth. Great flavor with a nice dry hop finish mixed with the roasted malt tones. Medium bodied beer with great drinkability and very enjoyable. Smuttynose always delivers good quality brews and this one meets quality in my book. I hope to visit the brewery this summer."
"I was thinking this had be super on tap before I visited the BA and the Alstrom Bros review gave me a little feedback on that thought."
"D: It's been a long time since I've craved a brown ale, but I may have just introduced myself to one that I could crave. It's different. It's nicely sweet, but not overpowering. It's hopped, but more for aroma than gratuitous bitterness. It's easy to drink, but not because it's a watered-down beer to lead your beer lineup in sales. I can, and will, have another."
"Poured a deep dark red/brown. Decent head which dissipated quickly, minimal lacing. Smell is of sweet malt with noticeable alcohol. Taste is same as smell with a decently dry finish. My major problem with this beer is that the alcohol was clearly present throughoput despite a relatively low %. This is my first smutty nose and overall im not impressed. I will try their other beers though."
"A solid beer, good to keep in the fridge as an everyday drink. It is a red-brown color with a medium off-white head. A sweet, caramel aroma. Taste, too, was caramel, with a malty base. Very enjoyable, and dependable. Good offering from Smutty. Try it sometime."
"Overall a tasty beer. I wouldnt call this special like SN's Porter. Overall not a bad beer, not one I would seek again."
"All in all, I would say that this is most definitely the best Brown Ale on the marker. Too bad its so damned hard to get ahold of."
"The last two kegs that I purchased for my homebar was OBD Ale. It's a real crowd pleaser. Brown ale is typically a middle of the road style that satisfies both newbies and jaded-beer-geeks. Smuttynose kicks it up a notch with extra hoppiness. That little extra ""bite"" is a nice touch that keeps the beer from tasting bland and boring after a few pints. It's a nice looking orangish brown color with great head retention. I buy the 1/6th logs and they go fast."
"Drinkability/Overall - A nice little English Brown with solid style characteristics and great drinkability potential. Another great brew from a great brewery. If you haven't tried it yet, do yourself a favor and find some."
"I had this on draft out of a keg at my girlfriends family Thanksgiving in Maine. Good stuff! Better out of the keg, but bottle is still pretty tasty. Nice going John!"
"Buy it and enjoy! A nice session ale for a holiday party."
"D- This beer has good complexity and depth with a nice supporting flavor of hops. This beer has restored my faith in brown ales, it really shows how a great drinkable mild ale should taste."
"Murky brownish-red body with a finger of offwhite head. Smells hoppy with some malt. Taste is equally malty sweet and hoppy. Malt may even overpower the hop somewhat, but is generally pretty well-ballanced. Tasty. Medium bodied. Tasty, solid ale. I'm impressed, and would definitely get this one again..."
"Pours a light mahogony color with a slightly off white large head. The head fades slowly down to a covering of the glass. Light amount of lacing. This beer has a nice nose, malty and a touch of spiciness. The taste is great, primarily malty with a nice light hops finish. It kind of reminds me of a somewhat sweeter Brooklyn Monster Ale but without the alcohol blast. The mouthfeel is rich and creamy and drinkability is excellent. This is a beer I would look forward to having again. Would make a great session beer for a group that thinks beer should have a taste!!!"
"Quite good!"
"IMO, Smuttynose is capable of a lot more than this, that's right, decent beer. I would expect more from one of the premiere breweries on the East Coast."
"D: Good nutty flavor, not my favorite style of beer but this is not bad, would try this again."
"This beer pours a nice rich brown color with almost no head and very little lacing. It has very little smell, just a hit of a sweet malt smell. It has a chocolaty malt flavor that clears away way too fast. The beer has a smooth crisp texture and clears away fast. In all this beer is way too week in flavor and a little to thin. It has a good taste but there just isnt enough of it. Its a great beer if you dont like the taste of beer but who wants that?"
"Musings: Not a huge fan of browns - but this one is pretty tight and right on target."
"Very drinkable classic styled brown ale. As such also very sessionable. Would also serve as a great introduction to brews made with the darker roasted malts. Glad to have tried this brew, and will likely drink this one again."
"This beer is very drinkable. Typical English style session beer. Good for long autumn nights with friends. You know, like Newcastle used to be."
"Amber-brown with a thin, creamy sand-colored head. Warm toasty malt aromas, with slight floral hop notes. There is a just-slightly-sweet hazelnut-chocolate aroma as well. The taste is definitely the strongest aspect: a very reserved and well-crafted nuttiness melds with chocolatey malts and a modest leafy-earthy hop bitterness. The finish is both biscuity and restrainedly-hoppy -- a very ""English"" flavor. Smooth mouthfeel, slightly carbonated. The finish isn't long, the body is just about dead-on medium. I've had this on tap before, and it's a little more flavorful, but one could do far worse than grab a sixer of this solid, drinkable Brown."
"Poured into pint glass,slightly off-white head.Not a thick,tall head but lasting.very tiny bubbles consantly lacing the side of the glass.Has a carmaley,slight chocolate aroma,a hint of bisquit,no hop aromas present.Has a sweet, carmel, chocolate taste and a nice sharp citrusy bitter aftertaste.Medium body,mouthwatering finish,very drinkable and enjoyable."
"Once again, Smuttynose comes through with a solid, enjoyable beer that seems to nail the style it's aiming for. It's got the earthy nuttiness you'd expect, and while the aroma is a bit sparse, the flavor makes up for that. It's very drinkable, with an aftertaste that's a joy. It seems these folks just can't manage to do very much wrong. Good dog!"
"Notes: Nothing fancy, just sturdy and tasty, like a good brown ale should be."
"Overall, it's a well-made, well-balanced, and highly drinkable ale - which, of course, is what a brown ale should be! Nicely done!"
"A nice deep brown with some reddish hints and a pleasing tan head, but only after vigorous pouring. Nose has that brown ale sourness but complimented by some nice grapelike malt aromas and some earthy, nutty, seedy stuff in the background. Pretty well balanced first taste, almost hard to get a read as all of the above mentioned flavors take their turns vying for dominance. Actually makes it fairly interesting. Malts became more pronounced in the aftertaste followed by the hops. Both were fairly strong in their own right. A nice creamy mouth feel as well. Definitely not a killer alcohol-wise and I feel as if, though strong in taste, it doesnt blow your taste buds. I could have more. All in all, definitely more hops than I expected, bordering on weak IPA levels. This is a tasty brew and the hound on the label is quite handsome as well."
"Pours a smooth brown ale with no head and little retention. Scent of roasted nuts, caramel and chocolate through out. Feelin ready to bite down on a nice piece of BBQ chicken with this...oh ya this is it. The roasted caramel flavours compliment the BBQ flavour of the chicken. A true brown ale with the perfect amount of everything from Abv to roasted malts. Next to Brooklyn this is my fav! Thank you Mr. brown dog!"
"Drinkability is good, but could be better. The sum of its parts are better then the whole. MK"
"Medium bodied with a roasted nut flavor accompanied by a sweet malty presence. Finishes with a touch of hop bitterness (grassy). Easy to drink, though not exceptional. Worth trying, though not a go to beer."
"A classy, classic brown ale, all the way."
"Pours an amber, with a decent two finger, tinted off white head. Smells like and english brown but with some american hops...leaning toward american, but near balanced in aroma. Taste is multi-layered. Starts like a hoppy amber ale, then morphs into a bit of nutty brown flavor, and then leaves a husky ghost note of dark or roasted malt as it fades. It's balanced, but still leans toward hops, and the type of hop used is a little dominant making it taste like a strong amber over the browner, nuttier subtleties. Mouthfeel is on par and medium bodied, balanced, and lively. Invites drinking. I'm torn if this is too hoppy to imagine friends drinking it or not. It's a good drinker, I'd just rather something else."
"Rich brown that is slightly opaque. Has a thick off-white head that is initially about a ½ but almost completely disappears by the end. Smell is slightly of caramel but roasted malts seem to dominate. Taste is mainly of sweet malts and some roasted malts. It is fairly simple (but certainly not in a bad way). Some carbonation, overall very smooth and light-bodied. This is not a complex brew (by any means) but that characteristic makes this a very drinkable beer. A good session beer, especially if youre a fan of the style."
"D: Lack of complexity and mouthfeel, along with a taste that would remain non offensive through a six pack or two, make this a great beer to drink. Have one, have a case, it will last. Well worth the try if you like the style."
"Drinkability: One of the better English browns I've had, domestic or import. A solid brew with a lot of flavor and one that could also probably be paired nicely with some good meal combinations. But still it's very good on its own."
"A pretty great brown ale... very tasty and satisfying. Mouthfeel is slightly slick... very yummy. All kinds of flavor to be had here. I could easily drink a few more of these. if i had 'em. Definite session material here. Great after a long days work!"
"Taste: the smell, color and pour built me up for a let down with flavor. It was a good beer that did not live up to the tremendous smell. I could taste the alcohol. It seemed raw. It was good for an occasional beer but would get old with more than two."
"A crystal clear, light brown with slight copper color. Moderate head, with lacing until the end. Aroma was very mild, mainly yeast/bread with a slight whiff of alcohol. Taste was complex - burnt toast, caramel, a little heat/pepper from alcohol and light hops in finish/aftertaste. Mouthfeel was almost creamy. All in all a very drinkable beer."
"A good beer any time of year. It's 91f here in Boston, at night! And I'm drinking a brown ale, go figure? Ready for another sip!"
"Drinkability: Offers a great deal in terms of flavor for the style. Quite easy to consume. Well-balanced, well-rounded, well done. Hand me another."
"I like a brown ale, and OBDA is a good one. Not a masterpiece, but plenty good."
"Drinkability: I rate it higher than average as the abv is moderate and the well-balanced taste keeps one coming back for more."
" A fine brown ale here folks."
"Dark amber color, almost opaque with a thin wispy head. Taste is malty toasted grain with hints of caramel and toffee. Mouthfeel is quite lush."
"Needs more dog."
"Taste is malty and barely fruity, with a nutty aftertaste to it. A little vanilla extract, a little coffee. It's not overpowering, not too sweet. Hop presence is just slightly there. Mouthfeel is a little watery but there are enough suds so it doesn't feel too thin. I could have a few of these, though I think the sweetness would start getting to me after a while. Still, a pretty tasty brew, probably would pair pretty well with a brunch kind of deal."
"I've recently rediscovered my fondness for brown ales, and this is a fine example. Smutty is mighty."
"A nice brown ale - pretty traditional, with a Smuttynose touch."
"Oh my this is a very drinkable beer. I would kill to try this on-tap. I would kill in mass to try this on-cask. I have wanted to try this beer for a long time. I figured it would be good. Shit, this is great! Give me some nutty English cheese, maybe some wheat and rye crackers, some grapes and a six-pack of Smutty Old Dog and I would die happy. I will have to get more. Thank you michiganmiked! Go Huskers!"
"Amber-brown, misty, and with a small tan head that dissipates quickly leaving only residual lacing. Carbonation is kept at a minimum but the little amount left behind is surprisingly biting. Aroma is big malts (toffee and chocolate). Taste is slightly nutty, sweet, and loaded with big medium-dark malts. An ever so slight amount of floral hops enters into the finish carrying a lovely, long lasting aftertaste with it. This is the most enjoyable part of the beer for me. The seemingly endless aftershock of these light and balanced hops is wonderful. This adds to the drinkability as does an overall light body."
"In any case, I doubt this will be the last Smuttynose beer I try, since this is only the first."
"Comments: I thoroughly enjoyed this brown ale. A wonderful aroma meets the nose as you take your first sip. The taste is a perfect balance of malt & hops which provides for a very drinkable beer. I recommend this to others..."
"Decent, but it should have been so much better."
"drinkability: quite"
"Pours a fiery dark mahogany with a finger of khaki head. Nose is caramel malt with some toasty/nutty notes. Taste is dominated by the sweet yet roasted caramel malts, a hint of bitter nuttiness, and a mild chocolatey finish. Surprised to detect a bit of alcohol in the finish as well in a brown ale. Mouthfeel as thinnish, per style. I used to love brown ales, and I still feel nostalgic for them (Newcastle brought me over from Michelob Golden Light and other swill), but I can tell my palate has moved on. Still a tasty, easy drinker though."
"My hat's off to MuddyFeet for a trade featuring several Smuttynose offerings. Thanks!"
"Taste; sweet at first, with caramel malts and touches of chocolate. The slightly bitter roasted nuts follow, along with a mild hop bite. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied and very drinkable, as a brown ale should be."
"Not sure what all the hype is about as I found this to be pretty average."
"Poured into a standard pint as a mahogany brown color with a sizeable tannish head and decent lacing. Nose is quite nutty and the malt foundation is predominant, leaving a rather sweet disposition that carries over into the taste profile. Nutty and malty sweetness. This beer is light/ medium bodied and a good brown ale over all. Brown ale isn't among my favorite styles, but this one is really very drinkable and I'd not require a twisted arm to drink it again!"
"Overall, a good beer with some character."
"D - Very nice for a darker session beer. That nutty aftertaste is inviting me for another sip every time."
"Poured a crystal clear mahogany-brown color with moderate white head that quickly fell to a thin ring. Smell is extraordinary with strong notes of roasted malt combined with a hint of coffee. Taste is somewhat on the sweet side, and a nice maltiness balanced with a good bit of hoppy bitterness. Great combination. Finished slightly dry, but with a taste that rapidly dissapates. A nice enjoyable beer."
"A rich, dark amber brown color starts this classic brew off, and notes of caramel, coffee and toasted nuts showcase its aromatics. This beer has some toffee characteristics to it as well along with a slightly smoky and very, very long finish. Tried it on tap for the first time recently, always purchased it in bottles before. Much better/different on tap."
"""old brown dogs, they're plain"" - ciderfaerie, and that's kinda what i thought of this brew, fairly plain, but nice"
"Mouthfeel is light and slightly effervescent as one would expec. This is a drinkable brown that might make a decent session brew, especially in the spring months."
"This beer pours a medium brown and leaves a thin lace that quickly disappates. The smell of this beer is wonderful of cocoa powder, molasses, lemon, and some earth tones. As I taste this beer all the previous flavors come out I can really taste the chocolate on the fore front as well as some hop kick rounded out with some sweetness from the molasses then finished with a orange rind bitterness. This is a good beer from smuttynose one I will def come back to."
"Poured from bottle with June drink by date. The color is a reddish, brown with nice clarity, topped off by a tan 1 inch head. The lacing is thick and nice at first as the head sticks around. I found the aroma to be hoppy with hints of caramel and malt. The taste is pretty hoppy for a brown ale, with a nice bitterness in the aftertaste. Different than other browns I have tried. The taste is pretty bold."
"into my nonic pint glass it pours a dark brown almost looking like some ice tea with a little too much mix. the one inch head quickly fades away leaving next to nothing with no lacing on the glass. when i sip it a slight bitterness is the first thing to hit me followed by some nuts and some slight malts. a very nice medium bodied mouth feel with good drinkability"
"Drinkability: A very easy drinker that won't offend too many palates. Goes down nice and smooth, would make a great session beer. I could drink these all night. Another fine beer from Smuttynose. Worth seeking out."
"d - i only bought one bottle of this and i definately need to have another to be 100% sure on how much i could drink this. if you really dig this it would be a great session beer, however, i'm not thrilled with it."
"Brown in color with a tan head that doesn't stay for that long. Smells of roasty malts, with a mild hop sprinkle. Tastes deliciously robust with a coffee-like malt profile. A little thin in the end though. Smooth mouthfeel, some carbonation. A good beer to relax with."
"I could drink these all night. Not sure if it is becuase of the excellent mouthfeel or what, but this is deffinately a beer that is brewed with high quality and care. Wouldn't know it was 5.7% if I had to guess."
"The ABV puts it at the upper limits of a session beer, but it would do fine if you dont mind a little extra booze. A solid brown ale."
"This has a dark amber color with a fine two finger head.A nice look fellowed by a nice earthy smell, not too hoppy for an ale,but with just enough spices.This has a nice flavor,but for this genre it's a little lighter than others.The mouthfeel is light,almost watery aftertaste,but still not bad.This isn't the best english brown ale I've ever had,but it's not the worst either.I would have another one."
"a bit too carbonated in my opinion, but overall tasty and drinkable. wish i had more of this--it could be a great food beer."
"Dark brown in color, suprisingly creamy off-white head with loosly sticky lacing. Light odor: clean, toasty, lighly nutty. Taste is sweet malty upfront with a minimal hoppy finish. Heavier than expected with noticable carbonation. Certainly a solid english brown ale and another good beer from Smuttynose."
"Worth a try."
"Drinkability - I find this beer pretty mediocre for Smuttynose. It was the only one from the variety pack that didn't impress me. It isn't a bad beer though. It goes down easily, weak flavor enables you to keep drinking it. Would go well with lots of foods (poultry dishes come to mind), especially since food would cleanse the film off your mouth. With this unpleasant mouthfeel, I don't really want another. I suppose it is a decent brown, a little bitter with a foul mouthfeel but decent. It just doesn't impress me in anyway."
"What a solid Brown Ale. This offering from Smuttynose usually slips under my radar. I have to make an effort to buy this beer more often. It's probably versatile in terms of pairing it up with different foods as well. Hands down, one of the smoothest 5.7 % ABV beers I have ever had."
"This is a good beer, and I would recommend it, but as an English style brown ale, it's might be out of style. At 5.7% ABV, this would be fun to drink for a few hours."
"Overall = A well represented brown ale. Not my favorite style due to the low hops but it's still a very respectable brew and I definitely recommend it to fans of the taste."
"Thanks to RealityDeviant for sending me a few bottles of this."
"This was a good brew indeed."
"Overall-the best brown ale I've had to date, wonderful malt flavors, decent alcohol content and a smoothness to it that adds greater enjoyment, pick this one up now if your at all a fan of brown ales"
"Pours a light brown with a small head. Lively carbonation and a little bit light in body for a brown ale. The aroma was dull and I couldn't really pick much up from it. The taste had a slight nuttiness to it with some caramel mixed in. Very smooth beer. Nothing really excited me too much about this beer, but it is very drinkable for the style."
"Very drinkable, and not too sweet, a good Kix breakfast kids love to eat."
"Ths brew pours a light hazy brown color with a small head that falls to ring the beer. I would like to see a little darker color. The nose is slight nutty and roasty tones, slight caramel, and slight brownsugar sweetness. The flavor is nice...starts as a nutty and roasty and moves more towards a burnt caramel roastyness, almost slightly coffee, but not. I think that the flavor is very good. Fairly well right where I want to see a brown ale. The feel is moderate, with a light to moderate carbonation. Very solid beer. Goes down easy. Very quenching. Easy drinking. Good show."
"Poured a cloudy orange brown in color. Minimal head and no lacing. Very little carbonation, the beer seams to have no life. Slight nutty smell and taste. Very minimal bitterness. Very smooth finish and taste. I kind of conflicted on this beer, it taste much better than it looks."
"Pours brown as described-hint of ruby at the bottom part of glass. No head to speak of and a moderate amount of thin lace. Just a nice hearty malt and hops balance on the nose. Cedar elements too. Some slight sourness but nothing to detract from the enjoyment. Tastes a little similar to the robust porter in the background but I love the robust porter so thats a good thing. All the nose elements are equally apparent on the palate as they are scent-wise. Mouthfeel is nice and clean--a touch dry but very pleasant. Drinkable--oh yes these are too drinkable at 5.7% -actually thats not too bad for a very nice brown ale."
"Very nice...one of my favorite brown ales..."
"Poured with a nice head that faded fairly quickly but left a nice lace in the glass. Can't get too much smell, but it may be a little cold so I'll need to wait for it to warm a little. Hint of roasted malts in the nose. Really nice example of a brown ale - dark amber in color. The roasted malts come in the beginning of the sip and the hops carry the beer through nicely to the finish. Not overwhelming in the hops department, just enough to balance the beer. This balance, coupled with the creamy mouthfeel make for excellent drinkability. An English Brown I would recommend and will remember the next time I am in the mood for one."
"A fine example of the style. I could drink these all night. Nice job Smuttynose!"
"Another excellent choice from Jah Noth"
"Had 4.5 years later on tap at the Smuttynose brewpub and not so much roast came through. Above average mouthfeel.Lacey and fresh."
"Beer looked like the color of an acorn with very little to no head. Decent lacing and good carbonation. Smelled like roasted grain and a slight hops aroma. The taste was sweet and bitter at the same time. A nice hoppy flavor at end and hoppy aftertaste. It got better the more I drank. Great mouthfeel with good carbonation. I believe this beer would continue to go down smooth."
"I think this is a fantastic session ale and I recommend it to anyone who appreciates a good Brown."
"Old Brown Dog marks its territory as a more hoppy, less roasty brown ale and guards it with a menacing growl. I haven't run across a beer of this style that presents itself in quite the same way, so points for originality must be accorded as well as points for quality. If you love hoppy browns, unleash this pooch and let him run."
"Pleasantly surprised by this one! Found this on tap at Austin's Ale House in Queens. Dark brown body with a thick smooth tan head. Smell is toasted malt with very light coffee notes. Taste is sweet malt. Grainy flavor. very very light coffee flavor. I dont like too much coffee taste in my brown ales. This ale was perfect in that respect. Some fruit flavor in the end maybe. Light carbonation and so smooth. Drinkability is almost an amazing 5. This brew went down so easy and I wanted another, bad. I think this is an excellent brown ale. Not sure why it hasn't gotten higher marks here on BA."
"Nice russet brown appearance with amber streaking. Good sized tan head, airy creamy. Nice whiffs of toffee, chocolate and butter brickle. There's nice mild toffee like malt presence and some dry cocoa to accent it. Just the slightest bit of a sourness. And some earthy hop accents. Mouthfeel is lightly carbonated and light-medium bodied. Decent little session brew here."
"Very easy to drink and one I will look for again."
"I thought this reminded of Leffe's brown a bit although it's been a long time since I've had one."
"Pours reddish brown. There is little head, despite my beset pouring efforts. The aroma is caramel and toffee. Tastes slightly nutty with a caramel flavor and a hint of coffee. Sweeter than I expected, in a good way. Finishes with a little hop bitterness. Medium body. Highly drinkable. An all-around good brown ale."
"Dark mahogany color with excellent clarity, light head, and light lacing. Malty aroma, figs, caramel, and roasted grains dominate. Similar flavor profile, slightly sour/astringent. Nutty malts with a crisp, lightly hoppy finish. Big bubbles of carbonation lend a ""weird"" mouthfeel. I think this bottle is old cuz this beer has definately tasted better. Overall drinkable yet laeves something to be desired."
"This poured out with about a quarter inch tan head over a caramel colored body. The head falls quick leaving just a light coating of bubbles and no lace to be found. Aroma was filled with sweet caramel malt with undertones of a roasted maltiness. The taste follows suite with sweet caramel being dominant and a light nuttiness added to the mix. The flavor ends on a slightly bitter note. Body is medium with a bit of creaminess to it. This is definitely a beer one could put away a few of easily. Its easy drinking and fairly tasty and not too powerful. This definitely makes for a good session beer."
"Old Brown Dog pours a a deep ruby-brown color with a thin tan head. The aroma has notes of chocolate, caramel, some spicy hops and some sweet malt. Taste is nicely balanced, with some roasted flavors, more chocolate, a slight brown sugar/molasses tinge and a dry finish. Lightly carbonated, medium bodied - very British in this sense. Very drinkable, one of my all time favorite session beers."
"The hops are subdued to the malt but provided good balance. This beer is tasty and I'd like to drink a few more."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Drinkability: I really like this ale, even though it bursts past the stylistic restraints that most brown ales stay within. Good gets."
"This brewery has an impressive record."
"This brown ale doesn't appear to be so brown. It's definately a little light for the style, but hey, that's ok, I'm all for innovation. Nice head. Smells nutty and roasty. Taste is great, nice and complex for a brown ale. There is this taste in several of the Smuttynose beers that I can't quite put my finger on (if you have any insight, beermail me) but my best explanation is a non-hop piney woodsyness, with some raisons or something. Very interesting and also seems to be only in Smuttynose beers. Perhaps a bit thin on the mouthfeel for a brown ale, but very easy to drink. Not your standard brown ale, and that's a good thing."
"Very drinkable. Smooth strong ale."
"Nice mahogany ruby/amber color, clear with not too much of the frothy, khaki head... it cleared pretty quick and left only a thin ring. Great scents of warm butterscotch, toffee, and caramel malts. Alot of carb going on, a bit much for me, it foams up in the mouth a bit too much for my liking. Tastes of black licorish- more like the black good-n-plenty candies... Roasted malty flavors. Good flavor with a nice and dry finish and dry mouthfeel, it leaves just enough flavor on your tongue and just a bit of the anise flavor. Easy drinker, smooth and medium bodied, just goes down very nice!"
"very drinkable and very tasty brew."
"I found this to be a rather uninspired beer, right from the start. For starters, it's amber in color, defintely not brown, and the head is thin and spotty at best. The aroma was slightly roasty, but mostly malty sweet, and a bit sickly at that. The taste is inoffensive, but unexciting as well. Sweet malt with a bit of roastiness and hop bitterness at the finish, but without any real depth or character. Thinnish in the mouth, and sweet in the finish. Not a bad beer, but not one I would go back to by any means."
"Pint at CAH Innsbrook."
"Very drinkable and pleasant. A session beer IMO. Nothing great but nothing average about this one either."
"This is really a fantastic session beer. Simple, malty, smooth and very balanced. I think Ill have another one."
"This ""Brown Ale"" pours a rather nice dark amber color. There is a moderate foamy head which lasts for a bit. The smell is rather nondescript. The taste starts out pleasant enough, a fine balance of sweet malts and hops. But there is a disgusting metallic residue on the tongue. I can not recommend this ale, with so many others out there to be enjoyed."
"I'm just not a fan of American brown ales. I find them boring, and without many redeeming qualities. This one, like most others, is very similar to the modern Pete's Wicked Ale, and there's just not much going on here."
"I think it could be a decent session beer, especially if the alternatives were macros."
"This brown ale poirs a deep but dull beer bottle brown (how appropriate), and there is very little by way of appreciable head. The aroma is of nutty, almond malts, with slight tartness lurking somewhere in the background. The taste is pretty much in concord with the way this ale smells. The tartness is a touch more evident, but the brew is dominated by the smoky malts. The mouthfeel has a medium body supported by light carbonation, and the finish is almost sweet."
"Poured into a pint glass with a nice head that quickly disappearted. Deep amber red in color. Smells great! Taste was a little too light for me as a stand-alone beer. However, I really started enjoying it after I paired it with my black angus steak off the grill! It's a nice beer to have throughout the meal. A good representation of a brown ale. Good to have on hand but just not my ""perfect"" beer."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, 1/4"" latte-hued head formed, which quickly faded to a layer of foam. Laced well. Brew is a reddish amber hue and has a heavy malty aroma with undertones of hops, maybe a bit of smoke, and that slight underlying alcohol essence. Taste is well balanced with malt and hops, but the malt is victorious with more pronounced flavors, like the slight coffee and smoke. Mouthfeel excellent, drinkability not a problem, keeps you wanting more, for sure."
"On tap at the Ginger man NYC, Pours light brown and clear. Minimal off white head, heavy lacing. Malty nose. Malt carries the day, as it should in this style. Crisp carbonation in the nose. Mellow brown ale, delicate flavors. Smooth and satisfying. Decent stuff. Quaffer to be enjoyed with a summer BBQ"
"Part of a sampler 12 pack brought to me as a gift by my roommates. Pours a semi-opaque, medium brown with red highlights when held in light. The half inch thick, white head, slowly diminishes and lingers as a thin layer of bubbles which is slowly fed by rising carbonation. Smells sweet and malty--primarily of caramel. Very smooth, medium bodied with a very good taste. Malt flavors, and again especially that of caramel dominate. Some bitterness is present in a very nice finish. A very nice beer overall."
"This is a case where a brew looks as good as it tastes. Pours a deep brown with a creamy tannish head that lingers.Aroma of rich malt and grains. Almost reminds me of walking through the grainery in my old home town. This is all about the best use of grain to produce a great tasting, smooth drinking Brown that leaves you wanting more.Unfortunately, I just drank the last bottle and the stores are close. There's always tommorrow. Surpassed some of my old favorites in choice."
"Worth a try by all means."
"An interesting beer to drink. Very enjoyable. Reminds me of Dead Guy Ale by Rogue. Worth a try."
"Pours a medium brown with amber highlights thru out not much head but that wasnt expected or hoped for.Aroma was chocolat and more chocolate with an underlying nuttiness to it,very appetizing.Taste is to me of malted chocolate balls with a fruitiness in the finish.A true to form brown ale appetizing and very easy to drink,well done."
"This beer was tough to pour without creating a lot of head. The color is that of stained wood and there is a little lace around the glass. The beer tastes like the smell of woodstain unfortunately. It's not bad, but comes off as tasting a bit acidic. The beer was bottled recently, but I think it may be better to either drink off the tap or let it age a while. It still tastes kind of green to me."
"A thin tan head graces this cola colored ale -- perhaps a bit more amber tinted than a true cola. A malty bread & biscuit aroma reminded me of buttered toast. The mouthfeel was almost chewy -- thick but not heavy, it felt good on the palate with just a tingle of carbonation. The taste was slightly sweet and very clean, somewhat meaty, with a toasted flavor and peppery aftertaste. This was a very enjoyable and easy drinking ale. I really enjoyed this Smutty offering."
"Pours a clear brown color with an 1 inch head. The head did not last to long and no lacing developed. The aroma was mild as some malt and caramel tones were evident. The flavor was nice as malt, caramel, and a tiny hint of chocolate were touched with some light roastiness. Very little bitterness. Carbonation level was somewhat weak. The mouthfeel was smooth and this was on the lighter side of a medium bodied brew. Nicely drinkable as the flavors keep this interesting."
"Overall I must say that I like the brew, very sweet and that is what would be its downfall for a brew that I could have a lot of in one setting. It is a very nice offering from Smuttynose and one to look for!"
"Appearance: Ruby chestnut brown with a decent sized quickling dwindling off white cream head, leaves scattered lacing. Aroma: Very nice mix of roasted malts giving of toasted nuts and caramel and chocolate tones nice creamy edge, very mild hops. Taste: Full on cohesion between a sharp malt sweetness caramel and mild alcohol note finishes with hazelnuts wrapped in milk chocolate nice. Mouthfeel: Medium to light bodied ale, great feeling smooth on the palate. Drinkability: One of the better brown ales in my opinion beats Brooklyn brown."
"The taste is unsweetened cocoa followed by a balancing hop bite. This bite lasts through the swallow. Moderate to high carbonation, the body is fuller than most brown ales. Quenching and flavorful."
"Tasted: 01/29/04"
"Pours out a clear brown color with a small head. The smell is malty and very sweet. The taste is actually more complex than I expected. Hints of malt, chocolate, raisins and also a touch of coffee. The ending seems to add a bit of hops but not much. I love this beer on tap. The bottle seems to have something a bit more tart to it, not sure where that is coming from. A solid offering from Smuttynose."
"Tastes quite nutty and buttery with some hints of a slighlty darker malt in the middle. The problem is it finishes very soapy. I can't explain but is has a bit of detergent mouthfeel to it. Body is good and it's drinkable, but the ending is rather unfinished and bizzare."
"The more I drink, the more I like. A great little ale which my wife absolutely adores. Recommended."
"Poured a nutty brown without much head and a lace that didn't stick. The deep chocolate and nutty roasted aromas carried through in the sweet malt, which managed to not be cloying. The roasted flavors stuck through in the finish. This seems like a nice fireplace session beer."
"Taste: The taste was very malty with a sweet chocolate overtone. The carbonation was very nice adding some crispness to the drink. There was a little hops in the tail end adding a bitter, sharp bite but this mellowed out in the end. The mouthfeel was mellow but not flat or boring. This was a little heavy for my taste and the alcohol seemed a little too prevalent for knocking back more than a few."
"I have always been a fan of what smuttynose has to offer, but this one was way below par. The appearance was very good. A very brown color with a good head and very pretty lace. The smell was of a cold medicine, to me. I also had the same feeling when I tasted it. I didn't have a cold, but when I do, this is what I'll drink. I'm sorry, but this was bellow par for te great Smuttynose brewery."
"Bought a six pack for $6.99. Wanted to try out more Smuttynose. I enjoyed their porter so I gave it a shot. Poured a dark cloudy brown with a tan head. Nothing too unusal from other brown ales. Smelled a little nutty. First sip I was pleased. Much what I expected. Hoppier than I thought it would be, but no complaints there. I love hops. All in all, money well spent. But I wouldn't buy it too often. Not something I would want to drink all the time."
"I bought a 6-pack of Old Brown Dog Ale and I'll drink them all, but the taste isn't very pleasant so it'll take me a week or 2 to finish. Man, what a bummer I wanted to like this beer and I'm really trying but the stale chocolate taste isn't enjoyable. Hopefully WeizenHeimer is better."
"Nice auburn color with yeast haze, good carbonation and acceptable retention. Smells of nutty toasted malt, toffee, and a good dose of American hops. As it warms, the esters and fruitiness of the hops emerge. Taste leans towards the sweet side, but is pretty balanced. Good caramel, toffee, and slight chocolate flavors. Estery yeast. Medium body, medium carbonation. A good beer for drinking a few."
"Much thanks to the 9th Bierman for this!"
"Pours is a deep mahogany, with a large tan head that diminishes to a small ring, light lacing. Aroma is dark maltiness (nutty, earthy, woody), backed up with a solid amount of hops. Flavor has coffee, caramel, and a great hoppy finish. Medium body, very enjoyabl and easy drinking."
"Brown color. Medium head. Aroma is nutty, fruity and sweet. Medium bodied brown ale. Malts are nutty and sweet. Hops are spicy and slightly bitter. A very nutty brown ale. The nuttiness and sweetness of the malts is almost overpowering. Smooth taste. Very nice, but a bit too sweet. Still very drinkable. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and dry. Aftertaste is slightly bitter and nutty."
"Had on tap at Redbones...rich brown color when poured, nice small head. The aroma is all malt. Taste is a mix of malty biscuity sweetness. No real hop bitterness in the finish. Not bad, would get again, not a style I normally choose, so thanks for the nice surprise. pat"
" Olive (the dog) has a subtle scent, but that took me a few trys to even notice. At first taste it's almost creamy with a smoky aftertaste with a smooth hop finish. Although I usually go for the bitters this is a fine drink and I will certainly be trying their other brews. Definately good with dinner, not too overbearing on the ole tongue. Definately a good starter for convert's!"
"A unique brown. Rich malt character, with chocolate & coffee flavours give way to sublte bitterness and an orangey hop finish."
"Damn good brown ale. If you like malty brews, this is a good one to seek out. Nice!"
"A very good brown ale. Pours out to a very, dark amber, almost ruby color in the glass. The aroma is somewhat sweet smelling. Taste is extremely malty, yet balanced. The malt shines and really gives this brown some teeth, but is finished by a nice, slight hop bite at the end. A very good interpretation of the style. Brown ales are underrated."
"Drinkability: could have a few."
"Lots of roast and chocolate in this fairly hearty brown ale. I always head for this one as soon as the weather starts to turn cool. The flavor is nice and smooth, and a wonderful compliment to stews and cassaroles (hey, I review wine as well, so I'm trained to food-pair!). The malt is noticable, but not overdone."
"Overall, a decent brown ale, but it's flavor just didn't do it for me."
"Very dark brown cola color, an effervescent tan head that fades quickly. Hoppy aroma with some caramel malts coming through as well. The caramel malt flavors dominate, but without the caramel flavor. Some hops wave hello. Pretty decent offering from Smuttynose. Cool seal logo and a nice brown dog named olive on the bottle."
"Smooth with a pretty rich medium body. There is a lot of sweetness to this beer, but definitely not to the point of cloying. It is balanced well with some darker malts and flavors of chocolate and caramel. It is very drinkable, and it was great with some wings and pulled pork."
"This dog is a malt lover's delight. It's body is almost brown, more ruby/amber than brown. I could get nothing resembling a head atop this glass despite an aggressive pour. The smell is very malty and sweet, and the same flavor follows. Has a huge malt profile. Hazlenuts, caramel, and toffee are all thrown in the mix, making this a sweet and complex brew. Maybe a bit more balance in the hops to balance out the maltiness. All in all, one of the nicer browns I have had. Very drinkable. Would do well after dinner, as it is rather a sweet beer. I am enjoying it thoroughly on its own, however."
"Dark honey color with a small off-white head that disappears quickly. Looks bubbly like soda. Smell is malty and inviting, and has hints of hop and molasses. Taste is sweet malt, with bits of brown sugar, toffee, and caramel. Mouthfeel is slick and watery. Decent beer, but not outstanding. Wouldn't be my first choice, but I wouldn't turn one down if offered."
"More malt then anything else. Some hoppy lavor at the end, but nothing to write home about. Has hints of buttery caramel, sweetness, you get the gist. Can be spring summer or fall bevreage. Quenches the summer thirst, gives the fall warmth. A good beer, not bells best brown, or Hazelnut Nectar, but a dan good beer reardless"
"Ruby chestnut hue, with a light haze. Initially thick head readily recedes into a thin, meager beige ring. The aroma is a stately melange of singed biscuit and carob, accompanied by mild earthy hops and mellow toffee. Understated figgish esters and butterscotch surface as it breathes. Agreeably well rounded aromawise. Judicious dark brown sugar - like sweetness bathes the palate incipientally in flavor; it is promptly complemented by a partially drying combination of grainy, crumbly, lightly salted biscuit and well integrated, calm hop bitterness. Earthy, tracely woody hop tones emerge mid palate concomitantly with subtle notes of buttery chocolate to lend a subtle, but relishable impression of fresh pipe tobacco. Lightly bodied, but appropriate and well matched to malt character in its softly dextrinous mouthfeel. Finishes trim and mostly dry, with a transient snap of dried date sweetness yielding to quickly fleeting notes of faintly buttery oak. Although ashen in hop presence and simple in its malt profile, Old Brown Dog exhibits sufficient depth of overall character to both satiate and tease the palate for more. Superlatively drinkable."
"Deep mahogany/brown with a a slight reddish color, started out with a medium tan head that dissappeared quickliy to a thin lace. Aroma wasn't to strong but there was a presence of malts and raisons. Mouthfeel was smooth and little to no carbonation. Taste of caramel, malts a slight raison flavor mild bitterness to this beer. Almost no hop flavor present here. Overall a tasty beer...."
"Reddish brown pour, with a small white head. Aroma is sweet malt, with hints of caramel. Body is closer to medium then thin, with light carbonation. Taste starts malty and moves to a very sweet caramel with very subtle hops, finishes sweet and slightly buttery. Not a bad brown ale, not to complex, pretty drinkable."
"The beer pours a dark amber color with a thin white head that provides good lacing. The smell is of rich chocolate, crystal, and roasted malts.; a true brown ale. The taste is smooth and balanced. The complexity of this brew is what I like the most about it. It signifies what a brown ale should be; amber/brown in color, good malty aroma, a complex balance of specialty malts, and a smooth finish. The mouthfeel is low to medium which makes this a nice sessions beer."
"A nice,cloudy orange/brown color with a slight tan head. A little toasted malt and earthy hop on the nose followed by a nicely balanced caramel malt and earthy hop flavor. Some toasty malt flavor comes out in the finish along with a bit of nuttiness, a decent brown ale."
"A nice medium-bodied beer that celebrates malt. I'll definitely enjoy the rest of these."
"Overall good but not spectacular...taste is a bit muted but I could drink plenty of them"
"	Karl"
"F."
"I found it to be similar to Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale, but not as complex. Other reviewers have noted more malty sweetness, but I didn't notice any. Assuming the beer didn't get skunked, perhaps it will mellow out in the cellar. If the brewing date was indeed March 2003, it may need to sit awhile. Good dog!"
"note:slight hop nose with hints of toasted grain and nuts.ABV is easily hidden and kind of high."
"This is a refreshing beer that one could underestimate. One of the nicer brown ales out there. I was pleased to note the lack of a sour aftertaste, which I sometimes notice with other brown ales."
"This ale poured a reddish amber brown with very, very thin white foam, and almost no carbonation evident. There smell was modest (sweet malt). The taste was sweet and malty with a bit of bisuit and nutty flavors. There was low but noticeable hop character. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy with very low carbonation, but with a fairly thin body. The drinkability was good, but the body was on the thin side for this brown ale."
"This is one of my favorite brown ales due to its drinkability. It's a cloudy reddish brown color with a foamy tan head. I was a little disappointed to see the head disappear so quickly after I poured the beer into a glass. Even the lace slides back down into the beer in short order. The malty and nutty aroma is pleasant and not overpowering. The mouth feel seems a bit thin, however this allows each sip to go down easy. The taste begins malty and is followed by flavors of caramel and nuts. I find a very slight bitter flavor in the finish and aftertaste."
"The beer spills from the bottle a somewhat hazy mahogany color with the head mountainous and the consistency that of whipped cream, the color a nice light tan and the lace a smothering sheet. Nutty sweet, a touch of yeast and the hop flowers present, clean, fresh, and quite sniffable. Sweet malt at the start, top middling in its mouth feel, the carbonation mild, the hops apropos to the style, the aftertaste droughty and long lasting, and a nice quaffable beer."
"Pours a dark amber color with a light creamy tan head that does not stick around. A fine bubble lace is left behind after the first sip. A copper nose and taste hits the palate on the first to the last sip. Chocolate and carmel malt hints are present along with earthy flavors. This is a nice brew but the best brown ale that I have had."
"Pours a truly beautiful deep mahogany color with a transient head that just coats the top of the glass. Malty sweet, caramel aromas filter into the nasal passages. Flavor continues the malty procession, with a ""toasted malt"" flavor dominating. Mouthfeel is defninitely creamy that floats over the palate. Finishes with just a trace of hoppiness to balance nicely."
"Interesting. Although a brown ale, this definitely pushes towards the range of winter warmers/strong ales. Dark brown with reds blending in, a slight head. Malty, with a strong caramel malt flavour that is lightly balanced by a few hops. A little alcohol kick and warmth is inherent. I liked it."
"Found at Jungle Jim's in Fairlfield. Pours a dark amber with very little head and minimal lacing. Aroma is sweet malt and a little fruit. Flavor consists of malt, nuts, and caramel and tasted better as I let it warm. Overall not fantastic but a solid Brown Ale."
"Brown/mahogany coloring with a thin, fine-bubbled off-white head. Burnt caramel and sweet malt aromas, with tea-like hops as well. Light carbonation; smooth mouthfeel. Masterful balance to this brew: toasted and almost brown sugar-like malts are offset by a pleasantly floral hop flavor. Dry, pretty short finish. I admittedly don't drink enough of Smuttynose's beers, considering their easy availability here in Boston. They don't disappoint."
"This is a wonderfull brown that is quite drinkable, if you want a fine example of an American style brown, look no further."
"However, I am unsure as to its drinkability in session."
"BTW, they added 0.2% more...just for that extra pleasure!"
"The dog on the label alone made me buy this beer. Very dark beer mahobany beer, with a deep robust taste. Not as deep as the robust porter. The carbonation is light, adding to the drinkability. The nutty taste and the hops can be tasted on even the smallest sip."
"5KD"
"I usually like this one a lot.  This brew today was not up to par.  First of all, it was served too cold.  Can't taste anything that way!  Caramel/copper color, clear.  Smooth, fine head.  Slightly picky mouth feel, medium bodied.  Mild malt nose.  Has a malt and caramel like taste with a slightly bitter finish.  This one is usually more drinkable.  Maybe was a bit too young?"
"Very rich creamy brown, the color of wet shoe leather. Thick rich creamy tan head. Smell is a burst of carmel sweetness, rich brown sugar smells, like a box of chocolates. Taste was a combination of rich creamy carmel, chocolate malt, and yummy hop kick. Medium bodied, slightly syrupy sweet, but in a good way. Very good, very drinkable, I can't wait to get my hands on more of these. Right up there with Rogue's Brown Necter. My favorite beer of all the ones I tried on my recent New England vacation."
"Doublebock fans, line up for this one!"
"Pours a nice brown color with an orange tint, with a thin tan lace. On the nose the aromas of malt, caramel and fruity undertones are evident. On the palate there is a caramel malt sweetness, dark fruity notes, toffee perhaps, slight graininess, and a touch of brown sugar, little bready... The mouthfeel is smooth. Emmm, I love this old brown dog...good brew"
"All in all pretty good. I had high hopes for this beer and was (probably inevitably) a tad let down. Very sweet malts, caramel, brown sugar, maple syrup hints. It not only looks brown, but tastes brown. I would have liked a little more hop bitterness, perhaps the grassy hints could be embellished into a stronger flavor to balance the sugary malts. Nice mouthfeel but ultimately too syrupy. Am very envious of those who have tried it on cask - I'd imagine this would be a real winner in that format."
"A nice brown ale.  It poursa nice and bark brown with a respectable head.  The aroma was a bit nutty and somewhat sweet.  The first sip is about what you would expect from the aroma.  Relatively easy to drink.  All in all, nothing to write to momma about."
"Semi clear amberish brown with a bubbly lace that fades slowly. Rich malty aroma with hints of butterscotch and ripe dates. Big toasted maltiness with an underlying fruitiness and buttery flavours. Tad estery with a noticeable alcohol, hops are vague a only aim to balance with virtually no flavour. Finishes with a touch of sweetness and toasted grain all over. A great brown ale to have around all the time."
"This one is a keeper.  Real deep, but not hazy dark brown color, head doesn't stick around too long.  Aroma of dark malts and vanilla.  Light carbonation and medium body. Rich, complex flavor with just the right amount of sweetness.  Hard to have more than a few, though due to the richness of it.  Quality all around."
