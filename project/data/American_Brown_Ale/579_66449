Caramel notes emerge as it warms. Fantastic concept but I wish there was more body or sweetness to enhance the coconut flavor.","GregJ","Jan 12, 2015"

3.85,6.1,3.5,3.5,4.25,3,4,"Two things I really loved about this beer. The price and the taste. The price was right since this is a big brewer and supply is ample. Not a lot of other beers I would take to a party for this price and feel like I'm taking this quality. The taste is exactly what it's advertised to be. Nutty brown ale with a bunch of coconut in there. I love it when a beer gives you exactly what you're expecting. Not saying I don't enjoy a complex brew but when drinking in the yard with friends you don't need to go crazy on in depth flavors and explanations. If you're a fan of brown ales and coconut separately, than combine them and enjoy a tasty beverage.","ThePaleRider","Jun 28, 2014"

The malt and hop marriage doesn't quite gel and seems to have a slightly off-flavor in the aftertaste. The body feel lacks depth and feels watered down. Sure, you get some deep roasted grain flavors with some chocolate and cocoa notes, and there is a noticeable (though not overbearing) coconut element to the flavors, but things just don't seem to mesh well. Not bad but hardly a strong representative of a good brown ale.","beergoot","May 13, 2014"

Pours crystal clear ruby brown color with a 2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big caramel, chocolate, coconut, toffee, toast, brown bread, brown sugar, vanilla, light nuttiness, herbal, floral, and toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and coconut notes; with good strength. Taste of big caramel, chocolate, coconut, toffee, toast, brown bread, brown sugar, vanilla, light nuttiness, herbal, floral, and toasted earthiness. Light earthy herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, chocolate, coconut, toffee, toast, brown bread, brown sugar, vanilla, herbal, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, coconut, and light earthy hop flavors; with nice robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy and smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice brown ale! All around good balance, complexity, and robustness of dark/bready malt and coconut flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 23, 2014"

I started with close to two fingers of foamy, light-tan head, but the intense carbonation caused it to bubble and burp its way out of existence. Truth in advertising strikes again! It was, indeed, a mahogany-brown with NE-plus quality clarity, enabling me to see through walls. The neighbors need to let the dog out, apparently. Nose was rich with caramel and coconut and I was reminded of a ""Peanuts"" strip in which Linus or Lucy had a box of chocolates and inadvertently chose a coconut and then made a face. I remember thinking that I liked coconut as a kid and especially my grandmother's pound cake with coconut frosting. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was initially rich with coconut, but then the caramel and chocolate of the malt began to kick in and it was like liquid candy! Finish was decidedly sweet and you had best like coconut going into it because that was the lingering flavor. I can promise you that this type of thing is not usually my bag, but as an occasional step away from intense hops, I liked it. You have to decide for yourself as to whether it would be to your taste.","woodychandler","Jun 10, 2013"

The beer’s body is clean and clear, though dark from the malts. On the nose, the beer smells chocolaty, almost to a syrupy level. There is a nice gentle roast that reminds the nose of coffee, caramel, and just a light hint of coconut nuttiness, but chocolate seems to be the big player in the nose. On the tongue, the beer tastes sweet and slightly savory with a lot of “synthetic-like” flavors coming through. In flavor the beer begins as light chocolate and moves into a slight coconut flavor that gives slightly plasticy flavors. These flavors crescendo into a short finish of mediocre chocolate, caramel, plastic-coconut, and slight biscuity malts. The aftertaste is light and slightly roasty with hints of chocolate. To me, the flavors suggest a watered-down English Brown Ale with very slight hints of coconut. In the mouth the beer feels on the light side of medium in body with a weak carbonation that simply peppers the tongue and then washes away. The mouth is left slightly dry with a touch of wet saliva. Overall, I am underwhelmed by this beer. I want more coconut flavor, and I want a thicker beer. The flavors are not disgusting, but just come off as “meh.”","Maxwell","May 06, 2013"

This is not a note that I have before experienced in a brown ale, but it works in this one. Whiskey and toasted kokonut make this a unique brew--and unlike many sweet ales it tastes as if it is stronger rather than weaker than the actual alcohol content. It tastes like hard alcohol--whiskey--but instead it's only...wait it does not say what percent on the bottle. BeerAdvocate says it's 5.5% but the spot on the bottle where the ABV was listed on other Kona brews is just empty space on the Koko Brown label.

The nose comprises lightly-toasted coconut and very little else, if anything, though a hint of wet grass may or may not find its way through at some points. Despite this not being the strongest of smells in the world, it does get to be a bit much at times. The taste adds in a bit of caramel-y toffee, but this is still mostly drowned out by the coconut. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slick-ish feel. Overall, this beer seems to deliver on one of its promises: it certainly has some coconut in it. Beyond that, though, not much else is going on. It's a sad excuse for a brown ale, with nearly none of the characteristics of the style, and its one note song gets to be tiresome after a relatively short while.","TMoney2591","Jan 22, 2013"

The taste is lacking - some nice malt and coconut flavours up front but these vanish like shadows in the light, leaving a faint lingering sweetness. No depth. The body is poor - watery and insubstantial when the flavour demands a thick, smooth unctuousness. It's drinkable enough but could use improvement. Worth trying.","jazzyjeff13","Nov 12, 2012"

Quick-forming head drops down almost as quickly to a thin lacing. Brown and clear. A bit of coconut and dark chocolate, a bit of a candy bar nose here. Body stands a little thin, and coconut flavor is quite prevalent. Maltiness does not really come forward—a quick smattering of toasted and very faint roasted malt. Balancing hoppiness does just that. Coconut flavor fades quick and a drink of toasted graininess is all that’s left.

Still, nice combo with the brown ale and coconut. Taste is less sweet, mercifully. Basically, it's a worthy brown ale with a slab of coconut on it. Unique tastes, definite hops note in there. Lots of mellow toasted maltiness, some hazelnut flavors in there, too. Brown ale can be a really under-utilized style of beer. Hats off to Kona for stepping up and doing something a little different. Flavors do seem to fade rather quickly, leaving a watery kind of finish with a nutty/metal lingering. Feel is pretty so-so, would like to see a bit more to this beer than what it has.

Brown, little darker in color, creamy but thinner head, not the greatest retention but thats no deal breaker to me. Has a very strong coconut and vanilla cream smell to it. I know this sounds weird but the smell is almost like a flavored coffee creamer. I have mixed thoughts on the taste. I preferred it better cooler than warm. When it was cooler it had more of a malty brown ale taste with some subtle coconut. The warmer it got it quickly became a very sweet, coconut creamy mess I thought. It was a little too much warmer.

3.42,-5.8,3,3.5,3.5,4,3,"Verdict: Worth the price, and that's to say it's cheap.","SolomonGrundy","Mar 23, 2011"
3.73,2.8,3.5,3,4.5,3,3.5,"Overall I really was surprised by this one. I originally bought this six pack to have one and send the rest out as extras. I might end up sending one (maybe two) out the rest is for me and my tasting friend Joss.","azdback","Mar 20, 2011"
3.55,-2.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"One of the sweeter brown ales I've had, but it's not a massive bash-you-over-the-head sweetness, which makes it more drinkable than some. Not a standard brown ale, but it will do, especially when being sold for $2 per pint.","woemad","Mar 20, 2011"
3.58,-1.4,4,3.5,3.5,3,4,"Pours a very translucent brown with thin head. Nose is light with some brown sugary baked goods. Palate offers the expected toasted coconut, thin watery body, and some brown sugar notes too. Easily drinkable with the watery aspect. Could use more body for sure. Toasted coconut flavors are nice though.","yemenmocha","Mar 19, 2011"
3.59,-1.1,3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall, a new twist on a brown ale for me, and very Hawaii. I did like it, and would not turn down another.","Retsinis","Mar 17, 2011"
3.62,-0.3,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Drink- I liked it. Was different but not over done, had good character and was pretty balanced. Probably won't have again unless I am in Kona.","FosterJM","Mar 16, 2011"
3.77,3.9,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,3,"Drinkability - Great, interesting taste. But a little too strange and adulterated to be a session beer. Seems like it would be a good mood beer, or for an esoteric food pairing where the food is chosen first and the beer has to fit.","ZenAgnostic","Mar 15, 2011"
3.06,-15.7,4,3,3,3,3,"The palate presents more of the same: toasted malt, coconut and brown sugar in equal portions. It's fairly thin, simplistic and sweet. There's some slightly astringent graininess in the finish along with more brown sugar sweetness. A clean and fairly drinkable beer, but not particularly good.","largadeer","Mar 14, 2011"
3.85,6.1,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"12 oz from a 6-pack from ""Habits"" S.Salem. $6.99 Appearance? Nice enough looking brown ale. Burnt amber/brown coloured beer with a nice thick light tan head. Aroma is subdued but the coconut is evident alongside whiffs of chocolate,nuts and caramel. Taste is definatlly tasted coconut..with sweet caramel malts and chocolate. Palate is OK and quite thick and pleasing for the style. Overall a nice pleasing beer. Funny thing with the toasted coconut and chocolate this reminded me of Lee's Macaroon Bars back in Scotland as a kid!","Reidrover","Mar 14, 2011"
3.48,-4.1,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"D: Good beer. surprised by this offering from Kona. Glad they took an apparently unique approach to an up and coming category (coconut) of beer. I like it.","harrymel","Mar 14, 2011"
3.36,-7.4,4,3,4,3,2.5,"D: Probably won't try this one again. Not a bad beer by any means. I don't really like fruity beers. But since this one is a nice brown ale, i'll let it slide.","bradleyp","Mar 12, 2011"
3.97,9.4,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Appearance has a ruby brown color with a off white minimal head and lace. Smell has a dominant sweet roasted coconut aroma with some grain in the back. Taste, again of sweet roasted coconut, grain with a good hop balance. Mouthfeel is medium with good carbonation. My first brown ale with coconut is very enjoyable,","Bookseeb","Mar 12, 2011"
3.84,5.8,3,4,4,4,3.5,"Drinkability is lacking a little. This is a very solid interesting take on the style, but I'm not sure that I'm reaching for another one in the same sitting. Maybe if I had a fireplace by my side.","inthebeeraisle","Mar 10, 2011"
3.81,5,3,2,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This is a very drinkable beer, works well in summer months, as I drink this in March i will note that I need to try this in the summer as it definetely will fill the void of a dark ale that holds up well to drink in summer heat. I reccommend this beer.","beertaster13","Mar 07, 2011"
3.12,-14,3,3.5,3,3,3,"It is a drinkable brown ale but the coconut does nothing for the brew. It's drinkable but there are much better brown ales available.","RJLarse","Mar 06, 2011"
3.9,7.4,4,4,4,3,4,"I'm a big coconut fan, so this brew was high on my to-try list. It was tasty and easy-drinking with a nice coconut character that wasn't too sweet, but overall the experience was a little one-dimensional. Maui's CoCoNut Porter will remain my go-to.","grittybrews","Mar 05, 2011"
3.35,-7.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Mouthfeel is medium with a smooth, light amount of carbonation.","ocelot2500","Mar 05, 2011"
4.22,16.3,4,4.5,4.5,3,4,"D: Overall this is a very enjoyable beer. It's a unique twist on the typical brown ale with the addition of the coconut. If you're looking for a typical brown, look elsewhere, but if you're looking for something new and unique, give this a shot. I'd definitely buy this again.","BilbosNuts","Mar 05, 2011"
5,37.7,5,5,5,5,5,"Koko Brown is an excellent nut brown ale with a creamy coconut finish. I have had it both on tap and out of the bottle and it is much better on draft. For how sweet the finish is I found it to be a rather sessionable beer. Like the new addition to the Aloha Series!","CraftBeerBarney","Mar 03, 2011"
3.63,0,4,3.5,4,3.5,3,"D: An interesting beer, I think the coconut works well here; I'm dropping the drinkability down a bit because its so unique, not really something I'd want more than one of at once. But it's well worth a try unless you're Angelica Pickles.","Halcyondays","Feb 28, 2011"
2.52,-30.6,2,2.5,2,4,3,"As someone who will eat an entire coconut raw in minutes milk included, perhaps I set the standard too high. From what I remember though, Pipeline Porter doesn't bash you over the head with aggrandized ""coffee"" flavor, which is entirely the problem here. Ease off on the sweetness, let the malts take center stage, and retune the coconut and we'd have a desirable brown ale. As of now, it's a no go. Sorry.","bohemiandonut","Feb 26, 2011"
3.1,-14.6,3,3,3.5,3,2.5,"This is OK but no repeat sale here, pretty much an average at best beer.","Zorro","Feb 23, 2011"

3.28,-9.6,3.5,3,3,3.5,4,"D: Apart from the under-carbonation noted above, I love the coconut taste (as I do in most coconut beers...and coconut in general). Wouldn't be too hard to sling back a 6er.","julian","Feb 18, 2011"
