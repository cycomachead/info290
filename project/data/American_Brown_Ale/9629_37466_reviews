"O - Another solid beer from Short's. The booziness is a tad strong and this could good be great with some aging."

"Nice deep brown color. Wow, a lot boozier than I was expecting. Falls pretty flat once you get past the booziness. The pecans & syrup are there, but very subtle. Honestly, if it didn't day they were in there, I probably wouldn't have picked them out. I'd like to pick up another & cellar for a bit & then revisit it."
"Tasty beer.  Smells like syrup and pecans.  A touch boozy right now.  Less boozy when first poured.  Will sit on a few bottles and retaste in a few months."

"3.49/5: Well, I certainly wouldn't mind pouring this on my pancakes"
"Overall another very nice offering from Short's. I wouldn't mind some aging to dissipate some of the alcohol and may add to the mouthful, but all in all a solid beer.  Allow it to get halfway to room temperature before sampling."
"Color of black coffee w/ 3 finger mocha head. Smell of malts and roasted nuts. Nuts and malts in the taste as well as Carmel notes that get stronger as you go and an oak flavor that lingers pleasantly. Surprising thick beer. Pretty solid and quite unique. glad I picked up a sixer."

"O: a decent brown ale with pecan and maple characteristics amply expressed"
""
"O- Pretty good but kinda hoping for more maple flavor."
""
"The pecan and maple do indeed add to this beer but in a fairly subtle way. The flavor profile is deep and rich and includes a barrel aged quality even though it's not a ba beer. The high gravity is evident but the alcoholic burn is minimal. The flavor components usually found in a porter are downplayed. I'll definitely look for this one again."

"Cheers-"

"A speciality double brown ale indeed.  This was a good brew in complexity and experimentation.  I wish the maple syrup and pecans were pulled out more.  However this is a balanced brown ale that offers a bit of dry and sweet.  Perfect for the colder months of the year and true to Short's style."

"Poured from bottle into pilsner glass. Deep, rich brown in color with an off-white fizzy head that settles into a small, creamy cap. No lacing. Smell is roast malt, biscuit, and sweet sugar, fresh cut wood, and juicy plum. Tastes of sweet, dark fruit (plum, cherry), a boozy bite, dark bread, yeast, biscuit, and roasted pecans on the back end. Entirely too smooth drinking for the ABV, this one is going to sneak up on me, and no aftertaste. Full, chewy mouthfeel. Delicious little meal in a bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
"A slightly heavy ale, which I was expecting but a little more than expected I suppose.  What compensates for the heaviness is the slight sweetness the maple syrup brings to the mix.  Overall a good beer that I would recommend to friends and partake of myself again if given the opportunity."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 2/23/2015. Pours hazy dark reddish brown color with a 2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice dense soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of chocolate, caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, raisin, plum, apple, maple, light nuttiness, herbal, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and adjunct notes; with solid strength. Taste of big chocolate, caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, raisin, plum, apple, maple, light nuttiness, herbal, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Light earthy herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, raisin, plum, apple, maple, light nuttiness, herbal, and yeast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice complexity and robustness of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and adjunct flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very creamy and lightly slick/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is fairly well hidden with a light-moderate warming that lingers after the finish; but never really feels boozy. Overall this is a very nice imperial brown ale. All around good complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and adjunct flavors; and quite smooth to sip on for the huge ABV. Definitely could use some aging time to smooth out the warming alcohol, but still a very enjoyable offering right now."

"Update: 2015 batch consumed April '15 - definitely more boozy, maple syrup present. Missing that strong pecan flavor though. Will age the remaining bottles."

"O - This is one flavorful brown ale. It gives me a nice warming sensation on a chilly fall day. It is perfect for today's weather."

"O- quite enjoyable, excellent blend of flavors that complement each other well. This has become my favorite Short's offering, which says a lot. Not too sweet, not too carbonated, and not too complex; they really hit a home run with this one. Highly recommended!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: First offering from Short's and I guess I would say it is just ok. It is pretty easy to drink despite it's fairly high ABV but just too sweet and a bit off balance. I like the uniqueness of the nut flavor with the sweetness."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A nice woodsy brown ale where I wish the maple was a bit more pronounced. Not a bad beer, but probably a victim of Shorts overall quality. I do not think the flavors burst here as much as they do with other Shorts beers. I would get this again, but there are others in the brand I would go to first."
""
""
""
""
""
"Highly recommended, a great drinker even at 9.5%. Lots of unique aromas and flavors. Thanks Abanton for spreading the Shorts wealth."

"Woodmaster's not BAD. Not bad at all. I just find it to be a bit too sweet (wanted more of a maple FLAVOR and a little less of the maple SWEETNESS), and the alcohol comes through a bit too much for my liking."
""
"This pours a ruddy dark caramel brown color with very light, thin foam. There’s a light aroma defined by some sweet maple notes and a touch of mild caramel malt. The flavor has a pronounced bitterness that is appealing contrast to malt sweetness along with some maple notes. There’s some pecan on the finish but it doesn’t draw undue attention to itself. I get some heat but it’s on the mellow side. That said, I felt the abv before I noticed it."
"I enjoy boozy olde ales and this one aged a year is definitely one of my favs. I enjoy it fresh as well but the year makes it a much more complex beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Considering the high bar set by most Short's beers, this was a disappointment. A few months (or more) of ageing, though, might smooth out the flavors and improve it."
""
"Pretty tasty beer - unfortunately, I think the alcoholic body masks some of the flavors a bit, and if that were toned down a little, this beer would be pretty damn good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

""
""
"Overall, this beer was below average to me by Short's standards. I don't see myself buying it again anytime soon. But it may be worth trying for the odd experience it embodies alone."
""
"M: The maple syrup and pecan are a good combination, nutty and sweet. Spicy brown sugar and raisins add to the wall of flavor. Damned, this one held up well."
"O - Not that great as the sourness dominates. The malty backbone helps, but not enough to make it great."
""
""
"Overall: Was hoping for a little more than what this was.  A brown ale brewed with maple syrup and toasted pecans should be a pretty robust beer. Not what I imagined, but not not horrible either. If I did not read the label I would not have noticed or been looking for maple and pecan flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I did not like this beer all that much. It seems to be a bit too sweet and nutty with a massive amount of carbonation."
""
""
"Rereviewed Sept 17, 2014 -  Super hoppy balance from cellared beer twin of previous review.  Still 4.5."
""
""
"Overall, it’s a good beer, but I’ve had much better from Shorts. My anticipation going into it was that I it would be much sweeter. However, the herbal woody taste – although not bad – really surprised me. I probably wouldn’t seek this beer out, but was glad I tried it."
"O - I love all of the flavors presented, I just don't have much of a sweet tooth. This is just too rich for me, like the beer equivalent of pecan pie or somesuch. Certainly worth a turn of the head, though."
""
""
"Delicious, doesn't over do it on the maple. It's understated but present throughout. Nice winter beer."
""
"Overall I was kind of excited to try this, then reviews of bozzyness let me down a bit, finally the confirm that it taste boozy really sucks. So far my least favorite shorts beer. I guess to do an imperial brown ale with this high ABV then avoid boozy flavors is impossible."
""
""
"Hrmmm, an interesting beer. This would be a great beer if it were not for the boozy fusel alcohols with limit it's drinkability, and if it were a touch less sweet and lower alcohol."
""
""
"This is a medium bodied brew with a moderate amount of carbonation. It is quite bold and shows hints of the character and ingredients displayed on the bottle. However, the description sounds better than this brew tastes. I think if the alcohol was toned down there could be more focus on the flavoring without it getting caught up in all the alcohol character."
""
""
""
""
"Overall I thought that this was an above average beer and a pretty good American Brown Ale that was quite unique for it's style and it fit the winter months nicely. This beer had pretty good drinkability, I could go for another one, but after that I think the sweetness and alcohol percentage would start to get to me, but it went down pretty smooth with not too much alcohol showing up for 9.5% beer. What I liked most about this beer was the appearance and the aroma, they were both just about as good as it gets, I could smell this beer all day, that's how good the aroma was. What I liked least about this beer was how the body felt a little thin and watery and how the taste wasn't as robust and complex as the aroma. I will for sure buy this again if it is released next year, I am glad I went back and got a six pack. This beer is worth giving a try if your are a fan of nutty brown ales, this one stands out instead of blending into the crowd. I enjoyed this beer, I like the complexity that the maple syrup and pecans added, it was just enough to make for a good flavor and great aroma without feeling overdone. Short's really did a good job on this beer it seems like they have a special gift for knowing exactly what added ingredients work best with what styles to make for a truly unique and memorable beer, and to me that's what Short's does best, they make memorable beers and this one is no exception, great job guys."

"Mouthfeel: Taste the alcohol but it's balanced. Medium body and carbonation."
""
"D and O: Nice beer. The nose is really the showcase, after that, not a WHOLE lot going on. A really nice Brown Ale. I wouldn't put that up there with the Good Humans from Short's, but close. Both Imperial Brown's, but on their own different side of the spectrum."
"O: This beer is nothing special. I has high hopes based on the label description, but had no idea what to expect considering it's from Short's. I'd like to try this beer again in the future, but not from a bottle."
""
""
"O- Another adventurous Short's idea. This one worked. The nuttiness is perfectly balanced with our beloved traditional ingredients, and the maple syrup sweetens it well, hiding the alcohol and bringing in flavors reminiscent of the smell of a candy shop. The richness, strength, and oiliness make it a sipper, but this is good, because the complex AFTERtaste is as enjoyable as any I can remember: pure pecan and maple... indeed Woody."
""
""
"Dark brown color, translucent, with a half a finger head with small bubbles. Smells of nuts, chocolate, maple syrup and malt. Taste is nutty, chocolatey, slightly coffee and I get very little maple syrup. Mouthfeel is on the heavy side and is carbonated lightly. Overall, this is a great beer and I will seek this out every year. A great winter warmer. If you were never able to get Cashew Mountain Brown, this one ranks right up there with it in my opinion. I would love to see this one barrel-aged."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - While I wasn't a huge fan of the smell, it's a pretty interesting brown ale. It's sweetness and ABV certainly doesnt make it a session beer for me but I don't mind it."
"Overall: A great Brown Ale with a little kick!! A true Winter Warmer! I thoroughly enjoyed this beer and encourage you to give it a try!"

"Overall: Way too much alcohol. I would have liked the more complex flavors to have room to shine. Oh well."
"mouthfeel - full bodied, a little cloying, minor carbonation. got an old english barleywine like feel. but the cloying has a bit of wood residue likeness which im not digging."
"Overall I really dig this brew. It was a little tarty at first but its really growing on me. I would like to try this one fresh and see how well the flavors have changed."
"Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A very nice brown ale."
" Lots of spices are evident on the first pass through and this is more or less to be expected. Nice notes of cinnamon, spiced apple and pear, and a touch of nutmeg. There was a good amount of sweetness mixed in with caramel and a roasted nice like smell coming off it as it warmed. Deep underling grain and malt base was apparent as well. Very sweet and entirely malt driven, this was not terrible, just underwhelming. Good bit of spice added in and a nice bitter hop driven finish."
"O: Dear Shorts, learn how to bottle a fucking brown ale without it going sour"
"O: this is an ok beer. i am not sure how much i like or dislike this beer in this moment. the bitterness is weird to me, but the after flavor is chocolaty and nutty and nice."
"D - Drinkability is high. A noticeable pecan flavor mixed with maple syrup is a recipe for success. While not an everyday drinker for sure, this would be great in the dead of winter, much like the label depicts, but I also didn't mind drinking this one in June."
"Pours a very dark brown with a short, stubby off-white head and some spotty lacing. Galaxy swirl on top. The nose brings some light cherries and molasses along with some brown sugar and sweetened malt. Also a bit nutty. The flavor has a decent amount of maple and brown sugar plus some light nutty character. Mild toffee and caramel plus a bit of light cherry. Mouthfeel is medium and quite chewy. Nothing too great about this, though not bad either."
"Overall - ehhh its ok"
"Overall pretty good, creamy and a bit syrupy though which seems weird but not as bad as I thought, interesting malts, good fruits, nuts, maple, syrupy, and all those flavors add a weird light sour tart flavor, a bit boozy but designed for that I think, a big beer."
"D: Too hot for me to have another, or even want to finish 12 oz. I won't buy again."
"Overall, this beer is like crystal meth: might be fun to try once, but certainly bot something I will be looking for in the future."
"But hey, whatever, this is simply an excellent beer that pushes boundaries in every direction. A showcase of Short's at it's best."
"Short's beers are always worth a try. Sometimes I find a unique and amazing beer, sometime not so much. Woodmaster was one I opened with great anticipation. I'm a huge fan of Michigan flavors; cherries, blueberries & maple syrup and this beer boasts maple syrup in the description. I've had a lot of maple syrup beers that frankly should have left the maple syrup out of their name. Short's typically can nail the flavors they boast in their beer. But like many other maple syrup beers Woodmaster fell short. Its a good brown ale, but nothing exceptional. Tastes like many other craft brew brown ales that use dark brown sugar or molasses, but lacks distinct maple syrup flavor."
"Beware of any of Short's beers in a bottle."
"Fuller medium body, sticky and creamy, decent carbonation. Pretty nice flavor, I like the integration of syrup and nuts to the brown ale, although it didn't seem to completely mesh together."
"Pours a murky dark brown with a 2 inch beige head that fades to a small cap. Nice rings of lace on the drink down. Smell is of hearty bread, roasted nuts, and maple. There is also a funky gym socks smell that ruins everything. I think this bottle may be infected. Taste confirms the infection. This is a sour beer on first sip, but I can taste the malty bread flavor, roasted nuts, and slight maple syrup. The infection issue is awful when combined with these flavors. Carbonation level is average. Overall, I bet this is a really good beer when it's normal but this was definitely infected."
"Not sure what went wrong here. Bottle was maybe old? The beer flat out sucks? I'd like to say I would try it again, but if it never crosses my lips I'm fine with that outcome too. For sure an avoid at all costs."
"O: An interesting beer, for sure. It definitely leaves a bunch of the typical brown ale considerations behind, in favor of the experimentation with the maple flavorings. Good, but not great."
"O: Seems a bit odd and disjointed in the end. Interesting, but not what I would call pleasant. I have to wonder what's intentional here and what's not."
"All in all, this is a decent beer. There's much better in the style, so not amazing, but decent. Not worth hunting."
"It is a good beer, but I think I may have gotten a bad bottle. I'd like to try it again because I think it has potential."
"-Gfunk"
"drinkable - nah, not really."
"4.0 D: I like me some brown ales and this is a good one. All the best qualities of a brown and some interesting additives to keep it fresh."
"Medium to light mouthfeel for a 9.5% and a medium to light carbonation which seems about right for the style. Overall a very good brown ale."
"overall - overall this is a good beer, not the best buy something i have drank since and will drink again"
"The CPJ"
"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side, and slightly slick. Carbonation is moderate. Drinkabilty was pretty good actually, things came together pretty well in it. I liked both the nutty, pecans and the sweeter syrup in it. Pretty cool and good beer overall."
"Overall: 4.5"
"D: i wouldnt want to drink another one right afterwords, but im convinced ill revisit some day. another interesting but solid brew from shorts."
"Pours a pretty maroonish brown. A bit of head and highly carbonated... it really looks pretty darn good. Smells malty and sweet. There is a hint of something bitter on the nose that is a bit off but overall smells like a decent brown ale. Taste, however, is a different store... something is seriously off here. I can't tell if its intensional or not. sharp bitterness on the tongue. Some serious maltiness that would be good if not for the off flavours. The beer is thick and creamy almost and tastes pretty good but its seriously got osmething funky going on that isn't very good. I think shorts missed on this one"
"The booziness and availability might make this rank a little lower, but it's such a solid beer and will get again if I have the opportunity."
"Well, The Woodmaster certainly isn't sessionable, but it is a beer that I enjoy greatly. The two Imperial Browns that I have had from Shorts (this and Good Humans), have both been standouts and I am impressed with how different the two taste, while still remaining pretty similar. This is one of those beers that I am surprised by how good it is every time that I drink it."
"Up for review is a 750ml bottle of The Woodmaster from Short's Brewing Company. Poured into a snifter at cellar temp. Pours mahogany, tan head. Notes of pecans, strawberry fruit, malts, oak and booze. Nice creamy body. Very nice, could use more time to mellow out."
"Thanks to hurfer for the extra. Poured from 12oz bottle (no date) into snifter glass. Pours a dark cola brown with hints of amber around the edges and a small off-white head that doesn't linger long and leaves only a swirl along the top with no lacing. The maple syrup is abundantly evident in the aroma, which is very sweet overall, with caramel and toffee coming through as well. There are hints of both the nuts and some booze which stings the nose slightly. I think I would describe the taste as a slightly more abrasive version of the nose. It's got the maple syrup which sticks to the palate along with the alcohol which makes its presence felt in the finish especially. The overall character is slightly toasty with the pecans showing up in the background. The mouthfeel is, no surprisingly, syrupy, and get almost cloying with the big maple syrup presence. The body is pretty heavy because of that and the carbonation is pretty light. This is not one of my favorites in the imperial series and the sweetness is enough to limit the drinkability. As I respect the originality of this style, it just isn't my style."
"Thick and coating, almost oily feeling mouthfeel. Matches the flavors well, a beast of a beer and delicious. Well done."
"Very drinkable and has a great mouthfeel. It is like drinking waffles with nuts and godiva on them. Amazing unique brew and the best thing shorts has ever done in my opinion. Such a beautiful beer."
"Mouthfeel almost is pretty viscous. Nice for a beer like this. I just wish this beast tasted as good as it smelled."
"D- A bit boozy and sweet, so it makes for a sipper. I imagine this will age pretty well."
"Drinkability - As with all of Short's beers, I have honestly never been able to taste the alcohol. This, for being so high in ABV, is pretty damn drinkable. I can see why Kevin has spoke about this beer in the past. Well done Short's!"
"D- Due to the high gravity of this beer, for a brown ale, it is not easy drinking."
"Overall: I just can't get by the overwhelming bourbon and alcohol flavors. They are really overwhelming and overpower all the other flavors. Every bit of the 9.4 ABV is present."
"Drinkability: 12oz was plenty"
"The sweetness of the maple syrup definitely make this a slow drinker, but is very tasty. Thankfully the nut and malt notes do help cut a bit of the sweetness. The high ABV is totally hidden."
"I must say that at nearly 10%, this is very drinkable. A solid offering at an interesting recipe."
"Overall a perfect cold weather companion while enjoying a real wood fire crackling in the fireplace. The snow is flying outside as I type on my macbook, and with this beer sitting on the end table, I'm doing just fine. Glad I bought more than one, or I'd be completely bummed. Bittersweet and creamy. Yummy."
"The drinkability is good. This is quite sweet, and as such serves as more of a one and done selection or dessert beer, or night cap. Well worth a try. A perfect winter selection to enjoy whilst bundled up in flannel in front of a nice fire. A great version of a nut brown of imperial status."
"D- It's a great cold weather drinker with the warm alcohol and flavors of fall/winter (nuts and maple syrup). It took a lot of will power to let it warm a bit for a full experience. Something I'd buy again. Glad I took the suggestion from the ""beer guy"" at Peter's Imports."
"D_Definite sipper. Pretty rich in taste."
"Woodmaster is medium-bodied and feels creamy. Pretty good for a brown ale, not too spicy. Good balance and decent drinkability. The ABV may be up there like a lot of Short's brew and not listed like all Short's. Cool artwork on the label."
"So far this is the best beer I have tried from Short's. This is highly recommended and a beer this good makes me proud that people who are local to me made this great brew."
"Having heard that this is a limited release, I strongly suggest you try this one before it runs out."
"D: One is enough for me. I'll keep a 6 pack for a time to see how this ages."
"To my mind, this beer seems outstanding in many respects, from its bold and synergistic flavors, lovely aroma and color, to its high ABV- this beer has a lot to offer. I imagine this would be a nice drink to share with those who may have yet to develop a palate for craft brews, as this showcases quite nicely flavors that most folks may already know and appreciate. And on cold winter nights, sitting around a nice fire with friends or a loved one, this would be a winner, for certain, IMO. Maybe even as compliment to pancakes, bacon, and eggs for breakfast, for those ""vacation"" days ;) I also find the whimsical artwork on the bottle brings yet another dimension of enjoyment to the beverage. In Short's, a brilliant beer :)"
"This might not be as drinkable as a standard brown ale, but it is much more drinkable than many other beers of its size and malt character. When I smelled this and got all that malt in my nose, I figured it would be a sipper, but the nuttiness on the end helps it go down faster. This is a very well made beer."
"I like that I can taste everything that was put into this ale, and would be pleased if it worked its way into a regular winter bottling rotation."
"D - This has good drinkability. It goes down easy and tastes great. It has a good balance to it, as a deep flavor profile. This is a great beer from a great brewery, and I'm glad I got the chance to enjoy it. I can't wait until my next trip the Shorts brewpub."
"Reviewed on 6/29/2010. On tap at Shorts. Pours a dark amber brown with barely any head. Aroma of sweet nutty malt. Flavor of maple (but not so much maple sugar), nutty pecan, also a strange saltiness (mushrooms?). Not overly sugary or malty as I was expecting. Still, it didn't quite sit right with me. An interesting beer to try, but I'd suggest a small sample!"
"Another dangerously drinkable beer from Short's. A hefty beer which will really sneak up on you. A couple pints would probably be my limit, but I would enjoy the hell out of those pints. Excellent beer and a privilege to drink."
"Growler picked up at the pub. Dark brown with tan lacing. Smell is sweet and nutty. Taste is very sweet maple syrup up front fading into roasted pecans. The mix of the two makes you think of a great pancake breakfast. For 9.5% ABV this has excellent drinkabilty. Interesting and worth trying."
"D: An interesting beer and fun to try. Best in small quantities."
"How is a beer of 9.5% ABV so damn drinkable? It's scary in a way as this is a sipper, so make sure you have a friend or two to share the bottle with ... or not. The maple syrup does add a good amount of depth, as well as the pecans even though they stay a little vague. Vite Estreme Della Birra!"
"Semi-hazy dark amber with a small off-white head that recedes to a thin collar. Toasted pecans leap out of the glass, slightly overwhelming the toasted malt foundation. Maple syrup is noticeable on a lesser level, lending only a touch of sweetness. Toasted pecans and maple follow through on the palate, though it's not especially sweet. Flavors of toast and roasted malt are stronger mid-palate along with moderate bitterness. This is enjoyable, but I find myself wishing it were less attenuated to balance the slightly chalky and astringent character of the nuts. The finish is dry and lightly bitter with a lingering nutty aftertaste. Pretty good, a different yeast, something with more of an English ale character, would have made this more enjoyable."
"Beer is sweet and has a liquor like quality to it, a rather strong liquor like quality, bourbon almost. I guess the point of this beer is to taste like bourbon, congratulations, you did it, you really did. Drinkability is fine, mouthfeel is fine. I guess its an OK beer but not a repeat for me."
"Quite sweet but probably the most maple I've had in a beer. The nuts are quite subdued at this point as well and a mild tartness seems to be developing."
"D: Damn! We loved this beer! So rich and earthy, hopefully this becomes easier to find in the future."
"D: It wasn't awful, but I didn't care much for it. One of the weaker Short's beers I have had, though I love and commend their experimental side."
"drinkability is good. nice balance. neat depth. another interesting brew from a fine brewery."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low to medium carbonation. Smooth going down, this is nice stuff. Thanks Randy!"
"Rich and tasty, unique. Certainly worth a try."
"Overall, a very good beer. I think the age has changed the beer quite a bit. I would love to try this one fresh (hint, hint Short's)."
"The smell comes very close to meeting expectations. A very nice toasted pecan scent matches well with the maple syrup used. Both of which carry over well into the taste and are met with a light sweet chocolate flavor. Unfortunately, some of the bitterness of a pour or aged brown ale is showing in the aftertaste. All in all, another great offering from Short's. Well done men!"
"D: Good, unique which is a trend in the Short's Imperial series."
"D and overall impression: Drinkability falls a little short on this as well. A little too sweet for me. Overall, I think this had a little too much age on it. All of the flavors had mellowed, and I don't beleive this is what Joe intended this beer to taste like. Would have really liked to try it fresh and compare. But, I am reviewing this bottle, so i am not impressed. Skal."
"Pours brown in color, a little translucency around the edges. Smell is some light dark malts, and just a hint of alcohol. Taste is roasted malts, there's a good amount of alcohol in the taste. Very smooth and easy drinking. This is a good beer. There's even more alcohol showing up in the nose once this gets a chance to warm up. Another absolutely incredible beer from Short's. Wonderful beer from a wonderful brewery."
"This is not one of my favorites in the imperial series (pretty high bar) and the sweetness is enough to limit the drinkability. Overall, it's a tasty brown and definitely better than most, just not quite as good as most of the other Shorts beers I've had."
"Medium body and creamy with good carbonation. This was wonderful brew and a gem in a great series of beers from Short's. The last of the Imperial Series for me and it just leaves me wanting more, so give me more Joe!!"
"Drinkability- Overall this brew isn't bad it just has two things about it that I don't necessarily appreciate in a beer. The metallic grape thing and the cloying aspect. Big turn offs for this guy. I do appreciate what Joe was going for in this beer though and I wonder if more of the nuttiness would have showed fresh. Either way thanks for the opportunity Derek!"
"Taste starts with semi-sweet cookie dough malt with a woody edge. Graham cracker mixes with light fruit notes. Subtle vinegar and tart cherries (Flemish Red or Oud Bruin) throughout. Woody, nutty (pecans?), with maple syrup and a faint smokiness in the finish. Lingering vinegar and cherry pits. Medium-bodied, with a smooth feel. I didn't expect this to be so Flemish! Reminds me of Goudenband."
"Great feel, but it's a tough beer to drink and drink. Great for sharing, and another from the creative mind of Joe Short."
"Another unique, delicious beer from Short's. I can't get enough of their beer. The maple syrup and pecans in this beer really set it apart from other nut browns, not to mention the big abv. Thanks again for the treat Derek!"
"Thanks, hoppymeal, for the opportunity"
"Pours a rich mahogany with a fluffy two finger tan colored head that slowly dies down. Lots of bubbles racing to the top of the glass. A nice wall of lacing is left on the sides. Very interesting aroma of sausage, young maple syrup, and toasted pecans. Caramel malt and cane sugars dominate the nose as well. Smokey wood scents here and there too. Taste is much like the smell but has an interesting spice-like sting to it along with brown sugar and molasses. Aftertaste has a toasted nut flavor with a weak pancake sweetness that dries the mouth. Just not digging the flavor to be honest, probably because it's nothing like I've ever had before. Mouthfeel is warm and medium bodied with a constant carbonation. Drinkability suffers because of the over the top sweetness. Bottle should definitely be shared. I could see people that really enjoy this beer and really dislike this beer, as for me, I'm just about in the middle. Congratulations to Short's for being pioneers in the extreme beer movement. Thanks again Derek for giving me the opportunity to try this truly unqiue beer."
"Ultra malty, smooth, and medium bodied overall. There's a twinge of alcohol under the maple goodness, which slows you down some, but it's not distracting. Very creative and highly recommended!"
"Drinkability is aided by great taste and ABV."
