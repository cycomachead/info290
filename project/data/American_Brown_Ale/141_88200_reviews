"Overall, the uniquness of this beer was worth the try. The combination of earthy notes with hops made it fairly interesting."
""
""
""
""
""
"Good beer for night out by the fire in spring. Taste and smell has a ""woodsy"" note. Smuttynose never disappoints."
""
"As described - a hoppy brown."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall enjoying this one very much maybe I am just in the mood for a hoppy brown ale. Or maybe its just plain tasty."
""
""
""
""
"Serving type: bottle."
"O -  I wanted to like it, but just too many ""off"" characteristics to be good. A misfire."
"While not especially complex, this remains a lively, flavorful brown ale with a little something for everyone.  Another intriguing dark offering from Smuttynose."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Almost too many flavors hit the tongue at once. Like alot of Smuttynose beers, like brown ales and hoppy beers, just not together. Very filling."
"Was so looking fwd to this one, sadly not my flavor."
""
""
""
"OVERALL:  A crushing, delicious hoppy brown ale.  Good stuff."
""
""
"Dad loves this beer. Dad says this is actually an underrated black IPA. Blast of hops on the nose, blast of hops on the palate. Juicy and delicious! Mmmmm good! Dad highly recommends this, and also says that anyone who doesn't like it probably could use a spanking."
""
"O - Like the dirt bikes and mud racers on the bottle art, this may not be the most manicured, pretty ale. However, as a hop, booze, and chocolate malt monster, it succeeds wildly. The flavors are intense and ever-evolving, making for a engaging tasting. And at $14 for a 12-pack, an awesome deal for an imperial brew - beer type be damned!"

"Without the (sweet) label, I would have pegged this for a Stone Bastard/variant. Not a bad thing in the least. Will definitely be drinking this one again!"
"Medium bodied brown ale. Very smooth"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: As someone who is not usually into brown ales, i enjoyed this quite a bit. It seems to fit the description well; A hoppy brown ale, with a nice balance of hops and caramel malts. Id put this behind Dogifish's Indian Brown Ale as my second favorite brown ale to date. Smuttynose makes some of the best beers for the price in my area, at $9.99 a six pack and around $30 for a case. This particular one is 8.4% abv. Huge bang for your buck!"
""
"O: I like this beer. Reminds me of a cross between a black IPA and a Strong Ale, like a Stone Arrogant Bastard. It is not at all like a typical Brown Ale - it's too hoppy and too strong for that style - but whatever you call it, it's good."
"O: Bold flavor, dry, lightly chalky with a dry woodys citrus hopping."
""
""
""
""
"So hoppy it's like a Brown IPA!! Awesome and BIG!"
""
""
"O: complex aromas and flavor; very nicely done;"
"Delivers as advertised, a hoppy brown ale. I prefer brown ales to be less hoppy."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: It does a mighty fine job at being a hopped up brown."
""
"Pours brown, with lasting tan foam. Decent lacing. Aroma is dominated by heavy pine, very nice. Taste is initially wonderful - nice hop/malt balance, but finish is a bit dry and tart."
""
"Had this almost dirt like flavor. I've had many hopped up Browns before and this is easily one of the worst I've had. I love hops but had almost no characteristic of a brown ale."
"Excellent choice for winter and spring"
""
""
""
""
"Huge hoppy brown! Perfect balance. Get it while you can"
""
""
""
"O: Enjoyable with a decent amount of complexity though rather than a hoppy brown ale it seems more like a hybrid of a brown ale and a black IPA. Slightly hoppier and bittern than I might have preferred but still a decent one worth trying."
"Overall:  A bit harsh on the bitterness front but, overall, an enjoyable beer that has brings complexity to the palate"
""
""
""
"Really liked this, I'd consider it more of a Brown IPA with how hoppy it is, but who cares. One of my favorite beers from my favorite brewery."
""
""
""
""
"Nose faint roast, caramel, & floral, pine,ABV.  Taste malt, pine, light caramel, herbal, & pepper, strong bitter finish.  More of a Black IPA than a Brown ale!"
"Pretty good brew, it could use a tad bit more roasted malt for what they are going for"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A must try."
""
""
"They call it a brown IPA, hey why not? It's not your typical brown ale and it turned out fantastic. Refreshing, yet deeper flavors then just hops or sugary malts. This one surprised me, worth having again."

"Overall this was much better than I expected and a beer I will seek out again if they keep this in regular production. A hoppy brown ale â€“ they nailed it, so it gets a high score for a brown ale."

"Malty and sweetens up when warming up. Odd brown iPa beer I really enjoyed."

"My pour quickly resulted in just under two fingers of dense, light-brown head with decent retention. Nice, sticky lacing appeared fairly quickly as it fell. Color was a deep-brown with cola highlights (SRM = > 22, < 27) and NE-quality clarity. Nose had a prevalent malt sweetness, despite the label calling it a ""hoppy brown ale"". I got notes of milk chocolate, light smoke, and some mild grassiness. Mouthfeel was rather full and creamy. The taste was much more bitter than the nose had led me to expect. It had an over-kilned roastiness to it that seemed to bring its bitterness to the forefront. I do not know how I feel about this as I like my coffee hot, black and bitter, like some of my women. In my beer, though, I feel like there is such a thing as too much bitterness and this was pressing that limit. Finish continued to have an unbalanced, burnt, bitterness that was just more than I could get behind. Frankly, it reminded me a LOT of Black/Cascadian IPA and I do not like them for the same, burnt, smoky reason. Hmm. What shall I review next? ..."
""
""
""
""
"Not a session beer. I give it a 3.75 on taste, not because it fit the style so much, but because it is interesting, and I appreciate that. This one is good to enjoy just one of, then switch to something different, perhaps friendlier. This case will last a while, but at over 8% and with the hop flavor such as it is, that'll probably be okay."
""
""
""
"More like an Arrogant Bastard type ASA than a typical American brown or even a brown IPA. Not what I had in mind when I was shopping for a sessionable sunny Saturday grilling' & chillin' beer. Wish they had put the abc on the packaging somewhere (I don't see it on either the bottles or packaging, sorry if I missed it). I ended up dumping these in the communal cooler for more sturdier drinkers than myself."

"Would drink again for sure, but don't expect a run of the mill simple basic brown ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tried at bottle share at today's Swamp Head release. Pours murky brownish orange with no head. Aroma of caramel, burnt toffee, bitter pine hops. Flavor follows similarly with notes of caramel and toffee, burnt sugar, earthy hops, with bitterness on the finish. More hoppy American barleywine than brown ale really. Mouthfeel is medium with low carbonation. Overall a decent brew but maybe a bit harsh."

"Overall, enjoyed this one. The floaties eventually settled to the bottom and I supped the last quarter quite carefully. Would seek it out again, hopefully floatie-free."

"O: The balance of this beer seemed to be somewhat off and has too much bitterness and not enough malty flavors. I wish that it had more nutty flavors so it would have tasted like an Imperial Brown Ale, if there was such a style."
"O - I like this style, brown ale is usually that once In a while but usually disappointed experience. Hoppy brown ales are ranking up there with some of my favorite beers, this is No exception. This very American twist on what I would usually consider a lackluster style is really enjoyable and seems fitting for the mud season up In maine, once the ground thaws at least."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a dry hopped beer with a pretty harsh bitterness that after a few sips I found it kind of too much. Wish it was a bit more balanced and aged might do it some good."
""
"It is a deep brown in the glass, with plenty of head. Nice and foamy. The aroma is sweet. The taste similarly is sweet and robust. The malt taste is roasty and also sticks with you. This is an exceptional brown. Highly recommended."
"o. This beer is good, but not quite outstanding. Too much going on and the lingering bitter taste moves it out of the outstanding range. That being said, phase 1 (yeast) and phase 2 (nuttiness) are very, very good. I would revisit this beer with some pretzels present to buffer the bitter."

"Pours a deep cloudy brown with a great big tan head. Seriously, well over two fingers. And this thing has great retention to boot. Worth noting are the wee floaters at the bottom. I wish brewers would tell me when their beers are bottle conditioned. The smell, though, is great. It has a rich nutty aroma with just a hint of the hops. The taste is similar, with a little more hops and some light bready notes, as well. There is a nice thickness to it and overall I find this to be a great melding of a traditional brown with American craft brewing styles."

"Good beer in a weak style. This is what every beer called a ""Brown IPA"" should taste like. Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I really enjoy this beer. Balanced, easy to drink and has simple, yet tasty flavors that work well together. The alcohol is masked way to well, drinks like a 5% beer so be careful!"
""
""
"A nice hoppy brown ale. That sounds contradictory, but it worked very well. Would drink this anytime."
""
""
""
"The beer is just a big mean beast of a brown ale. A definite exception in the style. It is so deliciously complex and big."
""
""
""
"My beer guru brought this one over to share. Very good looking beer that had a good smell. Taste is not what I would want, bitter and smokey overwhelms the beer. However, it had an outstanding texture that I would say was perfect. ABV gives bonus points overall."
""
"It's a nice fun take on a brown, but I'd probably like to have some malt with this, in a way it seems a bit of a clash and not as complimentary, but still a very good beer all around"
""

"Saw this initiatially in BA magazine and their review was spot on.Great aroma without a hint of the abv of 8.4%.Cloudy brown aoorearance with a nice toffee smell.mouthfeel was again spot on,very much in the comfort beer style.Meaning a great beer to relax with and i think it drinks very close to a more complex stout.Will buy more.Cheers"
""
""
""
"O: A great hoppy brown ale, and for me, that is really saying something since I normally dislike hoppier brown ales. Durty is really easy to drink despite its complexity and strength. I definitely recommend it highly."
""
""
"O- this combination worked well for me. I was afraid that the hops would overpower, they are certainly noticeable, but so is the sweet malty notes of the brown ale. A nice change of pace from an often bland category of beer"
""
""
""
""
""
"Kind of a fogged brown on this one. This is a rich brown ale that wasn't as hopped as I was anticipating. I suppose the bold claim of ""hoppy"" on the name of the beer boosted my expectations. Good earth tone. Nice spiced edges. This is an appropriate use of hops on a beer that people would think shouldn't be using it too much. I like it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I really wasn't digging this one. The malt bill is too roasted and scorched. Bitter grapefruit is all that jumps out for the hops. However, the alcohol is very well hidden."
""
""
""
""
"Enjoyable Durty beer, deep mahogany brown body with a big tan head forming thick...as herbaceous and hoppy as some Black IPAs. Fine speckled lacing left behind, the nose gives off a semi sweet roasted malt character with hints of herbaceous hops, citrus pith with the dark roasted malt character. Rustic brown ale heavy hops dank bitterness on the palate rush of herbaceous bitterness with a begrudging kick of alcohol on the palate in the backend I had no clue it was as high in alcohol as it is. Hop particles are floating in the bottom of my glass visually it's appealing and it must add a good bit of flavor. Textures are dark resinous, slightly stick with a healthy amount of hops and natural carbonation flowing forth so smoothly. Overall, I'm happy to be impressed by Smuttynose, recent finest kind IPAs have been slacking with this beer it's really easy to enjoy Smuttynose again."
""
"Honestly, this beer is delicious. I had to get over the fact that it's not a brown ale, or even a black ipa to fully enjoy what this beer is and what is should have been intended to be. A whole hearted, true blooded, perfect example of an American stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep chocolate with a bright white head. The smell is a bit muddied with dark fruits and molasses hiding the candy orange notes. The bitter finish is where we really get down to it, it starts all candy smooth citrus and rolls into easy malt before waves of grapefruit bitterness crash in on the finish. My favorite from SmuttyNose!"
""
""
""
"Beautiful hoppy brown ale, or should I say Brown IPA? I was caught in surprise by its potent flavors."
"The flavors of dark fruit and roasted grain presence wtih mild grapefruit from the hops is fresh and brings a bit of yeast with which has a dark cherry-like tinge. Light coffee flavor with some ruby red type grapefruit with sweet toasted malt as it finishes. Overall this is a very tasty Imperial Brown, very drinkable considering the abv. The malt is balanced well with lots of hop flavor."
""
"This is a very solid brown ale. It's pretty unique for the style. It feels like a hybrid. Nice brew."

"Really stoked on this beer right now. Probably my favorite brown ale in a long time and I will score it appropriately. The hops are big enough to make you notice but aren't over the top like most similar brews these days. This beer strikes a balance I don't find often and hopefully more people appreciate it like I do. Oh yea, insanely smooth for 8.4%. I really hope Smutty keeps this one around."
""
""
""
"O - nice unique bigger ABV ale. Excellently crafted!"

"Overall a tasty hop driven brown ale."

"Overall: Nice hoppy brown ale. This style has evolved quite a bit over the years. This one is delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I don't really like the hop character in this one, I think it's a bit too much."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a pretty decent brown, but I was really hoping for some hops that was advertised on the label. Would like to try it on draft, but I will not seek this out in bottles again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O - okay so this is a combination of greatness. It has the smuttynose factor. The big brown ale factor. The ipa factor. Then blend it all together and you have an ale that may indeed have a sort of cheesy label, but an ale packed with so much class within its almost worth calling everyone you know just to tell them just how damn good Durty really is. Or you could keep it to yourself and drink them all up. Smuttynose need to add this to the yearly release list bc it sure is an instant classic packed plum full of flavor and brilliance. Geez is this thing good or what?"
""

"O: Yum. Hoppy browns/porters can be pretty hit-or-miss, but this one works very effectively. It's all about the integration of flavors - nothing here really clashes. That, and it's superbly easy to drink. Let's just say I'm pretty glad I bought a six pack of this stuff."
"The flavor has a definitive toasted malt flavor up front. The hop bitterness is muted but still very present. In all, a good balance. The body is typical as is the carbonation level. Some alcohol warmth. Overall, a balanced, easy-to-drink brown ale, albeit a more bitter Americanized version."
"What a treat to find this on tap. Big on flavours and delivers pure class."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Probably my least favorite Smuttynose to date. I just could not get past the burnt and overwhelmingly piney flavor."
""
""
""
"Maybe it's the fact that my expectation was very low, as the combination of high hoppiness and a brown ale does not work for me but this is really really good."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best before 6/18/2014. Pours murky very dark reddish brown color with a 2 finger dense khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, orange zest, floral, grass, pine, toast, biscuit, cocoa, caramel, light char, and floral/toasted earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of bright hops with moderate malt balance; and good strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, orange zest, pine, floral, grass, cocoa, caramel, toast, biscuit, light char, and floral/roasted earthiness. Good amount of pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, orange zest, pine, floral, grass, cocoa, caramel, toast, biscuit, light char, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice flavor balance and complexity of bright citrus/pine hops with moderate dark/roasted malt flavors; with a crisp malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome hoppy brown ale. Great flavor balance and complexity of bright hops and moderate malt sweetness; and very smooth and crisp to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering."
""
"Mouthfeel is good. Full bodied with a nice lingering flavor complemented by a moderate carbonation level. A little gritty and ""Durty"" feeling but somewhat masked by the initial sweetness that leads to a earthy nice dry finish. Crazy drinkable, this has an ABV of 8.4% and it's way more drinkable than a beer of that caliber. Nice job Smuttynose, lets face it, they know how to do brown ales!"
"O- Smuttynose's hoppy offerings never thrill me for some reason. This one is no exception, though I do applaud the effort and it wins points for its strength which doesn't detract from its drinkability. I guess I just appreciate the citrusy hops more since every IPA I've had from Smuttynose has been certainly more in the earthy vein. Yet, of course, this only makes me want to revisit Finest Kind and Big A to reinforce my thought process. Stay tuned for the edit of this review."
"O - Very nice beer and a different take on the style. Very enjoyable seasonal."
""
""
""
"Overall, an excellent beer from Smuttynose."
""
""

"Taste starts with roasted dark malts, then orange, lemon, and pineapple hops, with a malty and bready finish. Roasty and slightly citrusy aftertaste. Mouthfeel and carbonation are average, a bit of creaminess."
"12oz. bottle served in a shaker pint. Best by 07/22/14 indicated on the neck. Pours a nearly opaque brown color with mahogany highlights around the base when backlit. Head is dense, aprroximately 1.5 fingers and light tan in color and eventually dissipates into a solid, 1/8th inch cap embedded with ringlets. Two semi-concentric bands of lacing encircle the glass. Nose expresses caramel malt, roast and just the merest hint of hops aroma at the back. Wow that's good - coffee, sweet caramel malt, a charred roast character and some medicinal bittering at the back. Mouthfeel is light-medium, with a lively carbonation and some acidity that stimulates the salivary glands and leaves a residual prickle on the tongue between quaffs. I have to say that I'm surprised at how much I like this beer. Perhaps a little too medicinal at the finish, but really top notch. Another reason why Smuttynose is one of my favorite breweries."
""
""
"o; A hoppy brown as advertised. A really exceptional quality brew. Remains very tasty to the end. One of the best values in all of craft beer (8.4 ABV and 97 IBU's for about $1 a bottle [when a twelvepack is on sale]? Gidowdahere!)"
"Deep, dark murky (muddy) brown in the glass. The head is quite thick and frothy to start, light khaki in color with a ton of stuff sticking to the inside of the glass. The smell is very roasty, chocolaty and pretty typical for a darker brown ale. Along with the solid malt profile there is also a good deal of piney and earthy hop. The taste is actually led by the hops in this one with a both bitterness and hop flavor hitting out front. After the hops the malts are there, again mainly roasted and black which give coffee and chocolate notes while there are perhaps less of the caramels and other lighter malts that are more typical for a brown ale. The body is heavy and somewhat chewy this is combined with an incredibly bitter, dry finish that really coats the mouth. Overall this is a pleasing offering, a novel blend of a brown ale and IPA which happens to take the best characteristics of both."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a great brown ale, amazing its this big - i get no booziness, just a full bodied and full flavored brown ale."
""
""
""
""
"Really well done. This beer drinks like a brown with all the roast and smoothness you would expect. The hops are an addition and not the focus but contribute to the drink by adding a bit of pizazz to the toasty flavors and not by stripping the beer of it's identity as a brown ale. A classic brown ale with a bit of cheerful hops to carry it off with a decidedly sunny disposition."
""
"Overall pretty good, one of the better beers that has come from Smuttynose in recent years, nice brown malts, nice sweet characters, nice balance between malts and booze, and lots of nice hops that do get a little overbearing through."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not messing around, this Brown Ale is down and durty- showing influences of traditional northern British browns but with a distinct American twist. I just needed the hop influence to trend earlier, giving me more bright citrus aromas and a more hop-balanced middle palate. But the ale finishes confident."
""
"A good effort, but falls short a little bit. Too bitter."
"Overly bitter for my liking. Good fruity hop character, which truly dominates the malt backbone."

"12oz bottle with a Best by Date of 06-04-14. Pours a dark chestnutty brown with 1/2 an inch of head. Medium amount of lacing. The aroma is hot chocolate mix, nuts, coffee, and light citrusy hops. The taste is more of that hot chocolate mix along with some citrus and pine. Nuts, bread, roasted malts, and earth. Lots of different flavors here. Bitter at the finish with more hot cocoa and piney hops. Floral hints. Somewhat of a heavy mouthfeel with lots of carbonation. Surprisingly not too much of an alcohol presence. Overall, great offering from Smuttynose that I'll be buying again."
"Overall the first ""hoppy brown"" I have had and it won't be the last. Love the combo!"

"The taste has this quick sweetness at the start but it takes about a second for it to be overtaken by the earthy hop character that is lingering out back. The grass is more noticeable in the taste than in the scent. But it still has the nutty characters."
""
"Overall - something i would love to have again. Very sessionable with an 8 percent abv. While i have had some ""indian brown ales"" before this is my favorite to date, the balance and structure are impeccable. Flavor wise its nothing new but the greatness is in the sum of the parts."

"Super smooth over the tongue and ends with a lingering malt/hopped up finish. Nice stuff. Go get some"
"Overall I'm really enjoying this beer. Satisfies my craving for hops and gives me the roastiness I like in malts. Will be getting this one again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A quick taste of sweet malt quickly gives way to piney hops, then the mouth is hopping with the spicy, floral, and citrus hops. It comes back around to a sweet bread flavor, then finishes dry with oak and earthy notes. As it warms the complexities come together with more of a harmony. This is really nicely done."

"Best by 6/13/14.Pours into a nonic a deep chesnut brown with some ruby red highlights a great looking creamy full one finger head that settles into a creamy mass.Aromas are on the lighter side with some roasted nuts,cocoa powder,and herbal hops showing thru.A great creamy feel,like a brown should be in my mind,very rich feeling.Flavors have some booze to them along with some sweetish cookie dough and molasses,the hops partially cut thru the sweetness providing earthiness and leafy/piney notes.This is a cool brown ale,the hops are big but so is the sweetness,it even gets a bit sticky after awhile."
""
""
"Overall: This is a very good beer, all of the flavors work well together and are strong, but the beer drinks lightly. In re-reading my review I'm not sure I really expressed how good this beer is, might be my new favorite for the style. I decided to give Smuttynose a chance in my mix-n-match six pack, looking forward to trying the others."
"Flavor-wise, it has a lovely base of lightly sweet choco. It leans a bit towards some mocha action here, too, before getting all hoppy on you. The hops are somewhat citrusy, with some pine and rind action going on. I really like the balance here, too, between the choco and the citrus; both aspects linger nicely. I foresee a few more 6-packs of this in my fridge in the future!! Well done, Smutty!! Prosit!!"

"Dark brown with a whole lot of floaty specs suspended throughout. Smell is sweet, flowery citrus candy hops, caramel malty bottom, some unexpected vanilla. Interesting piney licorice with a little bit of smoke. Flavor is increasingly interesting as well. Very piney, chocolatey, bitter....a bit disjointed overall. Not sure how I feel about this beer. I don't hate it but want to like it more. Mouthfeel is very nice. Full creamy body."
"I now know why this is called ""Durty""...murky brown with lots of suspended sediment. Nice, thick, frothy yellowish head though, making it a lot more attractive. Roasted, dry aromas of brown malts, earthy/peppery notes, dark pine resin, and faint grapefruit. Flavor is a blend of hops and malt, as expected. The malts trend towards dark-roasted coffee, bitter chocolate, spicy pine, nuts, floral hops, and some grapefruit. Fairly aggressive all around, not as polished as say Sublimely Self Righteous - rough around the edges I suppose. Medium bodied, dry, a little creamy, and oily in the finish. Meh I don't know...sort of disjointed and harsh for my tastes."

"O: A good showing and a great beer. It was like a brown IPA."
""
"A very nice surprise from a great brewer. They are moving to a new facility soon down the road. I hope they stay true to their roots."
"O: Durty is just a great beer all around. With all the rage surrounding black IPAs right now it's a wonder that nobody has much cared to explore this ""Brown IPA"" category. I think these tend to work a little better without the dueling bitterness and astringency of hops and roasted malts. It makes for a much smoother, easier drinking experience and you still get some of the more robust malt flavors. From what I've been told, Smuttynose intends to 6 pack this and roll it into their seasonal lineup. I think that'll prove to be a good decision."

"Picked up a bottle (831 of 960) at the Smuttynose brewery. Poured in a shaker pint, the beer is a vibrant, dark, ruby-tinged brown coloring with a tall, frothy, clingy, light tan head that starts a solid inch and a half and slowly settles into a quarter inch with very good retention. The film clings all over the glass. Aromas are very hop forward, with a pine resin richness, and a rich backbone that blends caramel and nut sweetness. Flavors are roasty and sweet on the forward tongue, with a robust blend of nut and toffee. Tangy and resiny bitter hops presence quickly follows, with peppery spices and a touch of smoke. Great lacing all over the glass as you drink, and the beer remains light and smooth in mouth. The aftertaste is rich, roasty, and slightly bitter. The beer is a pretty decent blend of an American Brown and an IPA, which comes off very interesting and very drinkable, despite the slightly elevated ABV. Slick, light, slightly dry finish with a subtle sweet linger. Tasty brew."

"Very enjoyable, nice hop profile for sure, but this is definitely a DIPA with some minor darker ale qualities. Kinda wish there was more malty brown qualities but it's good enough to not be able to complain too much about it."

"On the lighter end of medium bodied and tastes very similar to theÂ aroma. Â Very hop forward with resinous hop bitterness dominating the flavor. Â Dry and floral with grassy hop and sticky pine needle flavor lingering over a slightly roasted malt backbone into aÂ dry finish. Â Hop profile is kind of one dimensional and the malts are impossible to pick up until it warms up considerably. Â After a while there is subtle toffee, caramel and chocolate malt sweetness along with burnt toast and coffee bean."

"This beer is certainly tasty, but I expected more from the brewery that produces one of my favorite browns Old Brown Dog."

"Verdict: A very enjoyable hoppy brown ale from Smuttynose. The alcohol is very well hidden at 8.5%, the hops are well integrated with the richer, grainy malt flavors of the brown ale, definitely worth seeking out for any hop head."

"This is full bodied with sharp carbonation. This is unique and tasty. Great beer."
"The body is medium with good carbonation. Leaves a bit of a filmy taste on the finish. Overall this one is great. Really hope this gets brewed again in some form or incarnation."

"Pours the lightest brown, or ruby in the right light. Creamy one finger off white head. Aroma is of pungent hops with a caramel sweetness as a backbone. Taste is an intense hoppy bomb, but not overly bitter and very well balanced. Plenty of piney, floral, and citrusy hops contending to be noticed here. Everything comes together to create an exceptional ipa. The brown ale elements of the beer provide a great malt backbone to balance the hops without becoming overly sweet. Creamy, creamy mouthfeel. Reminded me a ton of Surly Furious...which is a good thing!"

"One of Smutty's homeruns if you ask me. Delicious treat for the hop craver looking for a winner in a different style than fill the shelves. Highly recommended."

"O/D-Delicious. I hope they brew this again. Probably my favorite Smutty brew. Unique and incredibly tasty."

"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass. Pours a dark mahogany, with a two inch dark tan head that leaves loads of webby lacing. Smell is citrus hops, pine, carmel, and a little bread. Taste just burst with big citrus hops, with everything else in a supporting role, with a hint of roasted chocolate malts in the finish. Body is medium large, with lots of life,not dry, and easy drinking. This is excellent, reminds me of a big, brown version of Zoe Ale. Please make this again, because it is a treat."

"Pours a solid dark brown with faint ruby highlights when held to light and a huge fluffy tan head that persists forever before sticking lace to the sides of the glass. I could smell the pine and earthy hops as soon as I popped the cap of the bottle. Pine, earth, resin, and a hint of garlic and citrus make up the bulk of the nose on this one. There's supposed to be some malt here, but my nose can't find it. The flavor holds a bit of toffee and caramel up front but there's enough pine and resin to make that a bit hard to find. This finish actually has a long lingering caramel or toffee, and a chocolate and ash flavor to it. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a resinous almost sweet mouthfeel to it. This is a great brew, I'm glad I was lucky enough to find a bottle of this. Now to find some on tap!"

"The beer pours a surprisingly clean mahogany brown, with a nice finger width head that lasts awhile, and gives a sand-dune white color. Lacing is long and medium in size, sticking nicely to the sides of my glass. The beer sits in the glass rather dark, almost black, with nice carbonation moving through it. On the nose, this beer smells like heaven. Big fat juicy hops, mango, passion fruit, ruby red grapefruit, and a light caramel sitting below everything, and hinting at the malts in this beer. This is a superb smell for anything with hops, though as it warms the alcohol becomes more present and spicy in the smell. On the taste there is some big grapefruit and alcohol with light caramel and nuts dancing on the sides of the flavor. The beer opens with bitter grapefruit which builds into spicy alcohol and grapefruit. As it moves towards the finish, light roast, caramel, and very light nuttiness come through in the taste. The aftertaste is bitter and pithy grapefruit with a light caramel tingle. On the mouth, this beer feels light and fluffy, and slightly chewy, sitting at the upper end of a light body and lower end of medium, and leaving the mouth with a light sticky layer of bitters and caramel. Overall, this beer is tasty. I would love to knock back a six â€“pack of this on a late summer night or fall night. The smell is definitely the most heavenly part of this beer, hinting far more at a double IPA, and actually reminding me of Wookey Jack by Firestone Walker. This is a great beer that really shouldnâ€™t be around for long (due to its small batch), but if you see it snatch it up. Also, if Smuttynose is reading this review, please throw this in 6-packs and put it alongside Finest Kind at the grocery store so I can by sixers of it regularly. Yes I realize its 8+% but, its tasty, and if you have to then lower the percentage, and still put it in a six-pack, thanks. Drink this stuff."
