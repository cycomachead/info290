"Review for CHAI BROWN not currently on BA but want to track all my beers in 2015. Saranac was one of my first craft beers over 20 years ago! Surprisingly liked the chai brown, more of a holiday beer. Nice dark brown flavor and strong spiced aroma. Good spice vs brown malt combo, neither overwhelms the other, taste settles evenly and lingers in the mouth. Well worth a try, this was a good,standard consumer beer."

"The feel is good, though I'd prefer a stronger medium body to this lighter one. it is crisp without being too crisp with a little smoothness."

"O - This was my last bottle in the Trail Mix 6-pack that I purchased. Like the others, this was an easy drinking and solid tasting brew, but it didn't show me anything to set itself apart from other offerings within the style. Overall, I didn't mind having this beer, but will look to other brown ales when I have a thirst for this style of beer."

"O: I'm just going to assume that there was something wrong with the bottle I recently drank. Still, the flavor is nothing to write home about. I wouldn't turn this beer down if it were offered to me, but I would not go out of my way to drink it again either."
"Overall - Considering how nice this beer smells, the taste is disappointing, yet tollerable. Not worth revisiting."
"This was a pleasant brown ale. I would actually put this a step above Sierra Nevada’s Tumbler Autumn Brown. I didn’t have any artificial smokiness or sugary notes. This is everything I would expect in an American Brown."
"Mahogany in color. The head, at first, is about half a finger but thick and creamy. It quickly disappears and becomes nothing but a small lace around the rim. Nose has a Nutty fruit aroma with a large caramel malt background. Flavor is similar. At first there is the caramel and toasty malt but it instantly changes to a smooth caramel sweetness with a candied fruit sweetness for the finish. The sweetness cloys, on the finish, after a couple of sips which leaves a scratchy feeling at the back of my throat. I get this feeling with overly flavored fruit beers and saisons. I'm all set after half of one of these."
"A nice brown ale. It could be a little more full-bodied and offer a more intense flavor profile, but still very enjoyable."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, the beer is a deep amber-brown color, slightly hazed, with a very thin layer of biege head. Aromas of maple and nut sweetness, blending well together and refraining from being overpowering. A nice, sweet, smooth nose that is light and welcoming. Flavors are nutty initially, with a roasted character, and the beer opens up over the middle of the tongue to reveal a tart and sweet dark fruit note, as well as some earthy flavors blending into the tangy caramel malty backbone. The body is a little lighter than I prefer for the style, with no signs of lacing and an almost watery feeling in mouth at times. Interesting blend of flavors, which transition into a tangy and sharp aftertaste that coats the mouth and jabs the tip of the tongue. The finish is a little on the cloying side, but not overly so despite all the sweet characteristics throughout. Decent brew."
"O-Not the best brown ale I've had but mos def one of the better ones."
"O - A pretty solid brown ale. I could definitely have a few of these in a sitting."
"The beer is mahogany colored with an inch of tan head that leaves plenty of lacing on the pint glass. The aroma is pretty weak, with some toasted bread, malt, caramel, and nuts. The flavor is OK, with a light roast presence. The hop character is amped up a bit more than expected. The body is thin, with ample carbonation. Overall, this is a drinkable brew, but nothing special or exciting happening here."
"Beer is thinner than expected and hoppier than expected. It is light in body with a mild sweetness, almost nothing on the midpalate and a really bitter finish, from hops not grain. There is a mild roast to the whole thing, not very interesting but there is nothing wrong with this beer."
"D- Extremely well balanced. Tasting blind, I could probably pegged this as a Saranac immediately. If you love the brand as I do, this is certainly one to try. If not, keep walking."
"O - An interesting beer."
"It's hard to truly dislike this beer, as much as I am not a fan of this style. Mellow, won't offend anyone."
"I have had much better browns. I would even rate the taste of this particular beer a bit bellow average. In terms of all elements, though, it is rather middle of the road. I probably will not purchase it again."
"Drinkability: Part of a mixed 6 I purchased in Iowa. Not available locally, and honestly there are so many brown ales available that are better, I do not think I would go out of ,y way to have this again."
"a nice average brown ale, nothing crazy, but it was solid. big thanks to alex for pulling through on the bulk of these."
"O- This beer has an off flavor that doesn't appeal to me. Half of it I like and half I don't. Unfortunately I could not finish this one."
"A standard, but well-made brown ale. The smoky roasted character would go well with summer BBQ."
"D - Very drinkable. Fairly crisp and smooth. However, it could use a bit more flavor and fullness. The flavors feel a touch off overall, but still enjoyable."
"Out of a Saranac sampler into my Perfect Pint glass, this beer pours chestnut brown with a billowing cream head that retains well and leaves lots of lace. Behind that great appearance is not much. The beer smells somewhat toasty and a little chocolaty. The taste says Mild to me, even though the ABV is too high for one. Burnt toast, bittersweet toffee and a slight astringency are all I'm really getting out of this. Balance is good, but there's no discernible hop flavor. Finishes dry, with lingering burnt toast flavors. In the mouth, the body is medium and dry with about the right tingle. Overall, I'm not loving this, but it's OK."
"D: Could drink a few of these if they were best choice on the menu."
"The feel of this beer is pretty light and has a nice drinkable feel. There is a nice smoothness that goes down well."
"Medium bodied beer with prickly mouthfeel. Leaves quite a bitter aftertaste, which lingers, and makes the beer not as drinkable.Had better ones before."
"Overall a tasty and creamy Brown Ale with a nice sweet coffee flavor that was left lingering for a decent while. A great beer and well deserving of its category."
"12oz bottle purchased as part of the ""What Ales You"" mixed 12pk. Pours a crystal-clear brown-copper body with nearly two inches of khaki-colored head that slowly dissipates leaving some really decent lacing, especially for the style. Sweet maltiness comprises the aroma, with nut, chocolate, and caramel notes, though you really have to look for them. Dark chocolate, caramel, and nut equally comprise the flavor. Subdued but not necessarily bland, with a good balance. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Nothing special, but not offensive. A decent, if perhaps pedestrian, brown ale."
"A clear light brown with a sizable head and good lacing as I drink. Rich malt and yeasty fruitiness with each sniff. Some butterscotch and toasted bread with a bit of floral hops. Taste is malty up front with toasted grains and a toffee like sweetness. An English ale fruitiness flexes above the butterscotch from the nose. Nice dry hoppy bitterness in the finish has a flourish of grapefruit and leaves buttered scones and graham crackers mixed with hop oil. This one tastes like a West Coast brown. Soft smooth feel is enhanced by gentle carbonation and a proper bit of weight, but not too heavy. Quite drinkable and a delicious fall and winter session ale even at six percent."
"Taste is light, a bit of iron and kind of a dry but slightly bitter finish, theres some chewy darker malts and it's pretty dry. It's a brown ale so there isn't too much exciting about it, but it does a good job at it."
"Overall: I liked it. was more a winter brew for me and on a 66 degree February day that is an oxymoron"
"If this beer was just a little full-bodied, I think it would be one of the best brown ale's around. Nevertheless, I still think this is a decent brown ale. Worth a try."
"Easy enough to drink"
"Not bad for a brown ale."
"D- Thoroughly average. It's good enough that I could drink a sixer of these and it's unremarkable enough that I wouldn't mind drinking a sixer of these."
"An entirely drinkable beer. I would take this over a lot of Saranac products (and plenty of non-Saranac products)."
"D - For fans of American Browns this is a surprisingly (and hoppy) drinkable ale."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the surprisingly bright aroma. The malts, here, were highly robust, and gave off a nice dark, caramely scent. This translated relatively well into the taste, with an unexpected hop dominance throughout a good portion of the session."
"Pours brown with a small foamy head. Aroma of toasted malts and citrus hops. Medium to full body, quite crisp. Hops slightly dominate flavor over malt. Finish is long, dry, coffeeish, almost Stout like. I think one of the better Saranac brews, although not on par with the best examples of the style."
"Music pairing: The Decemberists ""Down By the Water," Cut Copy ""Where I'm Going," and Smith Westerns ""Weekend""..."
"This beer somehow misses. It looks and smells good but the taste falls short."
"drinkability: nothing spectacular, but has everything one would expect in the style."
"D - Easy to quaff, but not an exceptional take on the style. It's consistently a bit above average, from the pour to the aroma to the body."
"drinks easy, but there are way better brown ales out there. i support it because its local, but i couldnt recommend this. ill avoid this in the future."
"pretty good beer>>>and i don't even like most brown ales>>>but this one is all right>>>the color is a very dark brown beer>>>it smells like a decent malty smell>>>taste very malty almost no hop presence if any i would say kent goldings almost dry>>>the mouthfeel is almost very rich>>amost>>>very drinkable i could easily drink a 4 pack of them>>>all in all pretty good beer>>>better than their others"
"Drinkability: A very well-balanced and flavorful brown ale which, surprisingly, has a nice hop profile and isn't all malts. Worth a look for sure, and this is a brown ale I would be more than happy to drink again."
"D - Quite drinkable."
"Not a bad brown ale. My favorite part is in the aftertaste, as I feel it's more slanted towards hops than most in this style."
"Drink - I actually enjoyed this beer quite a bit. It's nothing spectacular; but it is really highly drinkable. I'd probably seek it out again."
"D - more complexity would increase the appeal for me."
"Not the best beer but surely another solid Saranac offering."
"Overall, this was kind of a disappointing brown. Its been awhile since I had a brown ale and this probably wasn't the best choice going back to the style. I wouldn't drink unless its your only option."
"I wouldn't go for too many of these."
"D: Yawn. That's about all I can say."
"So-so, nothing bad but nothing special. Tastes like other brown ales I've had. Easy enough to drink. Not going to win any awards though."
"This beer has a dark brown, almost black colour and a great head that really lasts. The smell is hoppy and non descript. This beer tastes harsh and hoppy when it first hits your mouth, there are some coffee flavours that sometimes shine through before an aftertaste that is slightly bitter. It has a quite light body."
"Just a brown ale, drinkable, refreshing, tasty and smooth. Could drink these all night long! I'd love some steak and mash potatoes now!"
"D: Decent ale. Another good offering from Saranac."
"Drinkability - Simple, smooth, and drinkable. No off flavors or aromas in this beer, but at the same time nothing mind blowing. A solid brown ale and one I would never turn down."
"D - This ale seemed to go flat very quickly. This made finishing it a chore."
"Mouthfeel is light to medium with not much carbonation. Drinkable. Decent brown ale."
"Poured into a pint glass a dark amber brown with a creamy beige one finger head. Fairly good retention with a nice lacing effect along the glass. Sweet malty caramel aroma with hints of clove. Slightly bitter and spicy, almost cider-like in taste and consistency. Highly carbonated which I like. Medium body. Goes down easy and packs a nice buzz. Kind of a mild licorice aftertaste but not bad. One of the better brews in the Trail Mix sampler, though I am more partial to the darker beers so it's kind of difficult to be objective."
"M- Creamy and silky smooth. Overall moderate and it is nice tight bubbles. It quenches the thirst but it is not wet nor dry. A balance has been met."
"M- Quite creamy. Carbonation is way too high. Its very sharp."
"D: It's easy to drink this beer but the pedestrian taste doesn't leave me longing to have another one of these."
"Very average brown to me... Might do in a pinch but not one I'd reach for by choice"
"Not a bad little brown ale here."
"Overall, I really didn't care for this beer. I was expecting a better brown ale. I had Brooklyn and New Castle and both were much better than this one. I think the taste hurts this one, which is probably why I won't want to drink another."
"d - A pretty decent brown ale. Had some nice sweet chocolate in the taste and would try again."
"12oz brown bottle poured into a SA perfect pint glass. Appears a clear dark amber color with 2 fingers of creamy tanned head mostly composted of large bubbles. Head retains fairly well and leaves a ton of sticky lace coating the glass. Aroma has some sweet malty notes of caramel that is somewhat nutty as well. Also picking up on some citrus hops and some mineral/metallic notes rounding out the rest of the character of the nose. Taste is a little bitter upfront before the malt presence comes into play. Flavors somewhat nutty and caramel like. Minor bitter hops round out the finish with a trace amount of alcohol. There is a lingering taste of hops and minerals left lingering in the mouth. Medium to light feel with a moderately high amount of carbonation. Overall not bad, the last time I had this beer I distinctly remember picking up on some chocolate notes which were not there this time. Regardless, not bad but nothing to go out of your way for."
"D - A little heavier than I was expecting. Overall a damn good brown ale."
"Ehhh...disappointing. Bitter and sour without the sweet caramel malts which usually balance out a quality brown ale."
"Pours a clear dark ruby brown with about a finger of ecru foamy head that lingers once it shrinks down a bit. There is some nice sudsy lacing, but not much. The nose is very weak, with notes of maple syrup, hops, and a tiny bit of cocoa. The taste emphasizes the hops' bitterness, adding some bitter chocolate, some maple syrup, and a kiss of honey. The body is slightly lightly medium, with some strong carbonation and a very fluid feel, leading to a pretty high drinkability."
"Cheers!"
"Second beer that I am reviewing form the 12 mix pack. Poured into a tulip style glass. Light brown color. Large white head that lingered for a while. Has a hoppier than expected smell. Taste was not as hoppy, but more malty, with notes of pumpernickel bread and caramel. Mouthfeel was OK but not great, a bit thin for a brown ale. Easily drinkable, even for a 6% beer. Not the best brown ale ever made, but worth a try."
"The moutfeel was light and liquidic. This was an excellect example of the intended style, very good stuff."
"d: it is ok and i like to support family owned business; however, i have to admit that sammy adams is a better offering--that is to say that there isn't too much that is too special about this one"
"Grainy and pretty hoppy - strong grainy notes with hint of chocolate and a bitterish touch. Certainly an ""American"" brown...wish it would have more malty richness - could use it and still stay in American interpretation of style."
"D - Quite drinkable, this is a well balanced brown ale. There is nothing particularly notable about this beer, but the malt and hop characteristics are pleasant and well balanced. A good example of the style and one of the better brews from Saranac."
"This is for the most part a good beer, I just wouldn't want any more than one or two of them before I started looking for something else to drink."
"D- Nothing very unique or exciting about this brown ale, but a generally well made beer."
"A nice crisp enjoyable beer which is light for a brown ale and medium overall in the taste department, yet it's one that I will indulge again. Again, not the most exciting beer as far as a sensory on the palate, but the drinkability makes up for it makes this a solid brew."
"Clear, dark amber with a whipped foamy head of cream colored foam that leaves some nice lace on the glass. Roasted grain, toffee and floral hop notes. The flavors mirror the nose for the most part with the hop flavor slightly more pronounced. Medium light bodied with prickly carbonation. A good beer from Saranac."
"Well, I was generally unimpressed with this beer. I really like brown ales. I would spend the extra money any day and go for a Dogfish Palo Santo Marron six pack."
"I really liked this crisp light-medium bodied brown ale, more than i thought i would even. This looks, smells, tastes good, has a lilght bitter finish but overall is smooth and has the 'saranac taste' that i find the others from this company have. Ill be getting this again at some poiint, i could certainly drink a few and enjoy. Maybe its just the picture on the bottle and that im in new england, but i want to take this beer out on a hike or camping."
"Medium bodied with good carbonation makes this beer go down smooth and easy."
"This beer has a nice clear brown color appropriate to the style. The head is a tan color and leaves a good amount of lacing. The smell is a mix of hops and slight malty aroma. The taste is a decent balance of malty sweetness and hoppy bitterness. The carbonation and texture gives a smooth drinkable beer. Nothing was outstanding about the beer but its a decent brown ale."
"If it turns up at a party or on draft for a cheap price I will partake but otherwise probably not."
"D: Goes down easily, it's just not what I usually expect for a Brown Ale. Even an American Brown Ale."
"This isn't a bad beer at all. Saranac doesn't normally knock my socks off, but most of the things I've tried are solid and the prices are great."
"The sour nut thing really killed it for me."
"Drinkability: An easy to drink beer. Very enjoyable. I want another."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a dark brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mostly of hops, some malts. Taste is very hoppy, not much else going on. Feels light and bitter in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this is a decent but not great selection."
"Overall-more subdued than some others but I was very pleasantly surprised by this beer, not bad. a nice choice from Matt Brewing."
"CHEERS!!"
"d- overall not bad but also not a ""good"" beer. i will never seek it out but im glad it was included in this mixed sixer. i dont know what to say about drinkability because it is fairly light and weak for style but i guess it goes down ok.... its just not what i want in an american brown. :( slightly dissapointed."
"D: I feel that this isn't hard-hitting enough to be a good brown ale. I prefer mine to be upfront, in-your-face dark roasted malts and alcohol. This one just didn't do it for me."
"I think the numbers will vary a lot on this one. Pours a dark brown color with a creamy off-white two finger head that retains well and leaves medium-thick lacing on my glass. A very good appearance overall. Smell is pretty plain/not much going on. Initial scent reveals straight malts with some nutty hints to it. After a while it seems like the initial malts fade and a nutty/metallic characteristic takes over. Not really impressed at all by the smell, also I get no hops they speak of on the bottle in the aroma. Taste is better than the smell (seems to be the case with all the Saranac stuff I have had). Overall hints of malts, nutty flavors, maybe a tiny bit of sweet chocolate and a hop aftertaste to finish the beer. As with the smell it seems to fade to nutty flavors/malts with a hoppy/metallic after taste, which takes away from the beer for me. To me the beer just has a plain brown ale taste to it. Mouthfeel is a bit thin but has good carbonation and a nice flavor coating on the mouth, no noticeable alcohol at all in this one either. For my drinkability system it is decent, the beer is not the greatest tasting which factors in a lot for drinkability. It was cheap for a craft beer but I probably wont buy it again, the flavors fading over time also takes away here, I think this one will taste bad after two bottles or so."
"Overall: Just doesn't do it for me, nothing that stands out and asks you to drink it, a flawed beer in my eyes."
"While the appearance, though producing a rather large head, is fairly cola-ish, the other characteristics are quite pleasant. Very malty aromas with some roast and some deeper chocolatey malts. Flavor is a very smooth yet robust combination of caramel, chocolate and ome pale malts with only the slightest touch of hoppy bintterness. Mouth is well-rounded and pleasant. Certainly full-bodied. Overall it comes off pretty good, definitely something that you could enjoy drinking several of in a night. Sort of like a slightly-deeper (or darker) scotch ale in the flavor."
"I poured into a pint glass to two inches of tan head. The color is brown and a bit ruddy when held to the light. There are sweet malts on the nose. The taste is very plain. I get a little roasted malt but not enough to get excited about. This is just an average beer, not great, but not bad."
"Pours a two finger white head with a light brown see through color. The smell is very faint almost nothing there, there is a hint of roasted malt with a hint of sweetness. The taste is of a sweet malt with notes of caramel. There is a very slight hop bitterness to round out the flavor. The mouthfeel is a slight carbonation and is smooth. The drinkability is fairly good, the taste is above average but the smell leaves a little to be desired."
"D - If the taste was a bit better I could drink more of this, but the alcohol and the body make me think one is enough."
" better than a New Castle."
"Worth a try, but its a brown that I wouldn't care to drink more than one of..."
"Cheers!"
"Another Saranac from the What Ales You sampler... frothy two-finger head that creates a nice camber above the nug; velvet black soda body--appropriate... fizzy maltiness, with enough pale ale hops to blindly confuse the drinker--a bit too syrupy? light to medium-bodied, mellow with a cola finish; uniquely watery for a brown ale, pleasant but indistinct... sugary sweet malts pleasantly balance out the rather subdued hops... as advertised--this is smooth-drinking and textured enough to provoe thought on its flavor... as Saranac goes, a solid year-round contributor..."
"First taste has some slight bitterness to it. Not sweet like it smells. taste stays on the front part of the tongue. It does subside and gets out of the way for my next sip though which I think is good. Rest of the sips I have pretty much stay the same."
"A good white cap atop a slightly murky ruby brown body. Light scents, mostly caramel sweetness. Some nutty scents and a touch of hops. Taste is the same. Straight forward and typical. In the mouth you could consider it just a tad thin. Carbonation is a bit low. Not the most drinkable Brown I've had."
"Final Thoughts: Not bad just another run of the mill brown."
"Part of a variety six pack. Poured into a pint glass. Pours a nice color of brown with hints of red in it while looking through at a light. The tan head slowly dissipates, but the beer leaves good lace as you finish. Aroma of chocolate and caramel mixed together with hints of brown sugar. Medium bodied with more of the chocolate and caramel coming in nicely. Ends with a nice dry lightly hoppy finish. Very good beer."
"D: A tasty beer, smooth and enjoyable."
"D= I'd have a few before trying something else if it were offered in quantity."
"Overall a rather average brown ale. Flavor is unified, but needs more going on."
"Its drinkable, but oh so boring, even for a basic brown."
"D: Its not a bad brew at all. The flavors kind of remind me of those Haribo Soda Bottle gummies with that licorice flavor. THATS THE FLAVOR!!! Got it. Its an absolute interesting flavor coming out. The aroma is bit on the side of suck, but its manageable. This isn't a mind blowing Brown Ale at all, just pretty mediocre."
"D: A worthy brown ale although not spectacular. Not too bad to drink, but the carbonation makes it a little harder."
"Light medium level of carbonation as per the brown ale style. Highly drinkable if I enjoyed it more."
"I love brown ale's and this one is interesting. Good but not great. After its great appearance I was hoping for a bit more."
"D - Nice full bodied beer with some complex flavors. This is a good brown ale."
"Pours a nice deep brown/red. Has a foamy head and lacing left all the way down the glass. Had a hint of citrus, but nuts and grain were the main scent. Taste was pretty good. One of those beers where the taste matched the smell. Finish was nice as there was enough hops to linger on the taste buds for a while after each drink."
"Overall - I'm not a huge fan of brown ales, but this was definitely one I could enjoy well enough. It's simple and not groundbreaking, but that's not a bad thing."
"(D) A brew true to brown ale form, but nothing unusual or makes it a stand out."
"oh any thinnish beer that tastes good is very drinkable. best with a meal or as a malty gatorade moment. not to be sipped. i mean, nothing unpleasant if savored, but that's the key, 'nothing'...or almost nothing. damn. i am disappointed. i really like Saranac."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a standard pint glass. It pours a deep amber/ruby with a frothy white head. There is moderate lacing. The aroma has a bit more citrus than I was expecting. There is also some notes of chocolate malt. The flavor is well balanced. The malt is plesantly sweet with just enough hops to make it interesting. The beer is light bodied and easy drinking. It could use a bit more body, but it is other wise pretty good."
"A solid brown ale and better than most of Saranac's offerings. Nicely sessionable for an American brown as well."
"D - Very serviceable brown ale. Nice flavor and very approachable. Solid interpretation of the style in my opinion and an easy drinker."
"Overall this was a decent brown, but I'm a bit disappointed I didn't get any of the hops that it seems other reviewers had."
"D- Excellent. Nothing jumps out at you about this brew, it's just a nice session brown. That makes one decent brew for Saranac..."
"Not a great beer, not a bad beer, overall averageness. I guess that is what I expect from a Brown Ale usually, which makes it hard for me to rate them high"
"I didn't care too much for this one because of the plain and bitterness of this brew. Sucks, because I enjoy brown ales like Sam Smith."
"Poured from the 12 fl. oz. bottle no. 3537-07387. The pour is a nice looking mahogany brown with a small amount of off-white head that fizzles in short order. Sugary-sweet malts overpower the aroma. That is the most obvious feature upon first whiff. But it is appealing. Mouthfeel is a little better than medium with good stability after swirling in the mouth. The flavor is very sugary and malty. This has to be the sweetest tasting brown ale I have ever had. My only question was, where are the nuts?"
"M/D: Not as full-bodied as better brown ales. Moderate carbonation. It's alright."
"i really enjoyed this beer, havent encountered something like this before. the malty sweetness with hops seemed to be meshed just right, or at least to my liking. this was a very drinkable and enjoyable brew."
"Pretty good tasting beer. Taste the breadiness, some sweet malt, and finishes with just a hint of hop bite. Warming as it goes down. Good carbonation, a little on the high side. Fairly drinkable. Recommend."
"Pours a deep mahogany with a big tan head that clings to the glass as if for dear life. Smells very sweet, like molasses, with very toasty malts and trace amount of alcohol detectable; it's much sweeter than the earthiness of several other brown ales that I've tried but I like it a lot. A solid brown ale flavor that with a nice burnt bitterness; not the most complicated brown ale in the world but definitely appealing. Very drinkable all on its own or with any beer snack under the sun. Probably my favorite Saranac beer."
"Overall this one is just okay for me. Nothing outstanding here that makes me want to come back for more. Not a bad beer, just not really impressive either."
"Pours an amber color, a rich soapy 1 finger head quickly dissolves, but the small ring leaves decent lacing down the glass. Smell is a mix of malt, chocolatey, and hops. Taste is a bit on the bitter side, with a mild malt flavor in the background. I wish this was a little more bold and less hoppy. Average mouthfeel, would have liked this a little thicker. Beer has a good drinkability, not heavy, I just would like a more hearty brown."
"Drinkability is average. I have three more and I plan on drinking them, but I won't get this again."
"Deep copper color. Barely any head what so ever. Smell is malty with notes of caramel. Taste is quite cloying, with a dry finish that converts into bitterness at the end. Seems quite poorly constructed and unbalanced. Even the mouthfeel seems off - very thin and watery, yet overloaded with carbonation."
"Poured a mahogany color with a nice head, good retention and lacing. A a deep floral aroma with buttered biscuit aroma. Maltiness came off sweet. Tasted of roasted nut, small hints of chocolate and carmelization elements. Medium bodied mouthfeel, not as robust as alot of other browns. Overall very drinkable and has just enough bite to keep your attention."
"Strange to see a plain brown ale as a seasonal, but leave it to Saranac to make little sense of a mix pack. The added ABV works with this brew, and is just another minute detail with lends this ale some intrigue."
"A decent beer. Not a good one."
"Not nearly as good as some other Brown's I've had."
"Out of a bottle this beer was indeed a dark, root-beer-like brown color with some hints of maroon and a sand-colored head. The head was one-finger thick, displayed rather poor retention and some sticky lacing. The aroma was semi-sweet, a combination of caramel malt and toasted malt and some brown sugar. The flavors were also very malt dominated at first but faded towards hoppy bitterness at the end. Neither the malt nor the hops were very assertive and their generic characters were not well balanced. The finish in particular was a little too bitter. Hints of butter appeared as it warmed. The body was medium, the mouthfeel average and a little oily. Just another beer really and not one worth seeking out."
"I've had better and I've had worse..."
"A solid, drinkable ale. Another solid and affordable brew from the folks at Saranac."
"I can't say that I can recommend this one. I'd call it average at best and that's likely a bit of a stretch. It looks great, but could use work just about everywhere else. Please tinker with this one a bit more, Saranac."
"3.5 D: Not a bad beer. It's nothing special in terms of taste and overall quality, but it's not overly boring."
"D: Drinkable- could have a pair, but the lack of character in this brew (which seems to be a common trend throughout Saranac beers) would make it a dubious decision. Should eb thicker and a stronger malt flavor. As with most Saranacs, a very average example of the style."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, would make a nice session beer."
"This was an above average brown ale. Some good nutty taste to it and superior drinkability. Can't beat the price either, this is one of the best Saranac has to offer in my opinion, much better than some higher rated ones on this site."
"D_The beer looks good in the glass. That's the best I can really say. Way too light in taste and body and the aftertaste is somewhat unpleasant. Not a very good brown ale at all."
"Drinkability - Easy drinking, but not a good example of a brown ale."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a dark brown color with a really large 3 finger light tan head. The aroma is sweet malt with hints of caramel and citrusy hops. The taste is smooth and malty with some coffee and the hops coming along in the finish. The mouthfeel is light bodied and smooth. This Saranac offering is better than I expected, one of the better beers from this brewery. Overall, Saranac Brown Ale is a pretty solid American style Brown Ale that is worth a try."
"Mouthfeel is very rich and creamy. More than I would have expected. Drinkability is excellent. I know we have definitions for session beer, but this is one I could sit around and drink in mass quantities. Very nice!!!"
"Drinkability: I found this one very impressive... from a true 6 pack variety pack with six different beers... points for that... easy drinking and very smooth with good flavor... I would definititely get this again."
"The beer pours a dark tawny color with a full frothy and creamy head, modest carbonation for a Brown Ale. The beer has nice head retention and laces. The aroma is quite good: sweet malts, chocolate notes, brown ale malts, a bit of the earthy and musty hops as well. The taste is quite dry, perhaps a bit nutty, but this is buried deep within. There is a definite toasted chocolatey malt presence throughout. There is a bit of a dry hoppy bite in the finish. There is also more than a touch of bittering malty caramel in this beer. The finish is dry, the aftertaste lingers a bit longer than is needed. There is a definite bracing and slightly metallic quality to the finish and beyond. The beer is reasonably refreshing, light to medium bodied and a solid Saranac beer worth seeking out. L'Chaim."
"Poors a darkish brown with amber highlights and two fingers of quickly receiding tan foam. Smells of sweet roasted malts with floral and grassy hops. Taste is of roasted malts and chocolate with a rather un brownish grassy hop flavor. The flavor is there but not at all robust of prominent. The mouth feel was too thin for me and that also unfortunatly took away from the drinkability a bit."
"D - Although I found this beer pretty average in most respects, it is very easy drinking and I can easily see sitting back at home and enjoying several of these on a nice Spring or Fall afternoon."
"This beer pours a dark red with ruby highlights. It has an off white thick head that diminishes slowly. The aroma is of nice noble hops. The taste is fairly balanced with a bit of dark malt (maybe black patent?) aftertaste. The hop aroma is bigger than the hop flavor. There is some bitterness left behind making it a little more bitter than sweet, however the hop flavor is covered up by the malts. The body is light and refreshing. Not a bad brown overall. I could have a few of these."
"I almost always can't stand brown ales, but this one is growing on me. I had one last night and wasn't a huge fan, but I think my tastes must have changed overnight. This is basically a dessert beer. I can't say I'm usually a fan of sweet tasting beer, but when you accept this for what it is, you start to realize how much it tastes like a quality dessert item. It's like a caramel chocolate cake with coffee liquor soaked into it. It's not something I would want to drink all night. Actually just the thought of that gives me a tickle in the back of my throat like I just guzzled pure maple syrup. No, this beer is meant to be drank one at a time. It's a beer you drink very slowly which would make it a great beer to end the night on. I think I like this beer so much because it's a bit more like a porter than a brown ale. I didn't think I could ever warm up to a brown ale, probably because Sam Adam's brown ale is so bad that I still have a hole in my soul, but this one crosses over."
" This is not undrinkable by any means, but a bit more malt and more subtle hops profile would be a step in the right direction."
"I would recommend this one. I think it's the best in the sampler, but the IPA gave it a run for it's money."
"The malt/hops combination isn't balanced well with the hops overpowering the brew. Not a bad drink, but not a very good brown ale."
"A nice brown color with a smallish head and a fair bit of lacing. Nose is strong on sweet caramel malt. A touch of dried fruit. Toffee malt is the main flavor, and then a lot of nuttiness as well. A very mild hint of hops, and a fair bit of graininess as well. Body is nice and smooth. Another one that far exceeded my expectations. The Saranac stuff, for the price, is pretty solid overall."
"D- This one has okay flavors, but really I want more flavor out of my beer."
"Smooth and slick with a medium body that coats the tongue a little; plenty of carbonation, but not too much."
"D, notes: This is a decent beer. Would have liked some more specific taste characteristics"
"Normally I find brown ales to either be off balance or uninterestingly sessionable, but this is quite extraordinary. It strikes a great balance between the intensity of Sam Smith's Nut Brown and the mildness of Newcastle. Not quite as funky as Pete's, and overall a fantastic brew."
"Pours a nice brown color, with a bit of lacing and a little short-lived head. Very modest scent, a little malty, but nothing very much to detect. Excellent taste, though, a very nice malty brown ale with great nut flavors as well. Very balanced and very smooth. A nice brown ale, honestly one of the better Saranac ales I've had."
"Brew pours to a nice deep but clear brown color with a good sized light tan head that has pretty good retention while leaving heavy sheets of lace down the sides of the glass. The aroma is very malty, caramel with hints of chocolate and a maple syrup smell. The flavors are quite good, started a little odd with the hop break at the tail end but I have warmed up to it. Caramel, Chocolate and brown sugar come to mind at first then at the tail end it breaks to a well identified hop flavor. Hops specified are Cascade and Columbus though it does not have the taste I would recognize with Cascade so feel the Columbus had been used in a greater amount. Overall, this was a pretty good brew a nice addition to the mixed 12 pack. As with most Saranac brews it is not outstanding but good to very good."
"The brown ale forms a thick light tan head that sits on top of a clear dark amber brew. The head makes nice lacing as it sides down the sides of the glass. The aroma is full of sweet malts. On the tongue, caramel and maple sweet malts give way to bitter dark chocolate and coffee notes. The palate is medium bodied and smooth with average carbonation. Saranacs Brown Ale is well balanced and very drinkable."
"Ok beer, but not stellar."
"D: I won't turn down a free one, but this is not a very good brown ale."
"Overall it's really not bad. Nothing offensive or off, just not the greatest example of the style. I wouldn't seek it out, but I wouldn't refuse a second or third either."
"The star of this 12 pack sampler. Poured into a pint glass, this beer was a pretty ruby red/brown color with a thick white head. Ample lacing. A sweet, chocolate aroma with a little malt. Chocolate taste, a little late hoppiness. Malt background. Pleasant beer, maybe just a little thin in the mouth, fun to drink."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into my Chimay chalice. The appearance is a amber brown with a 1 inch beige head that melted away into a thin beige layer sitting on top of the liquid. Tiny threads of lacing stick on the glass. Aroma is powdered chocolate and then hops. It's kind of an interesting aroma. Taste is much like the aroma. It's chocolaty up front with a bit of toffee and the finish has a hoppy bitterness. Mouthfeel is thin and highly carbonated. It's a pretty good brown ale."
"pours with an average head with various flavors coming out even flow to it. Has nice color to it. Saranac has donr better but this ale has a drinkablilty to it before you know it 5 or 6 are down . Average beer!!"
"Verdict: Worth buying if you're looking for a drinkable brown ale. I'm not big on brown ales but I like this one."
"D - Very drinkable beer... Great small and good flavor are always a solid combination... I had easily enjoy this as a session brew..."
"Good body, nice and smooth and not over-carbonated. This one could be a good session beer, and as many from this brewery a good crossover beer."
"Notes: I avoid this beer,but if someone handed me a free one I would drink it because there are many beers that are so much worse. For it's style it lacks and as Brown Ale is my first love I can not easily forgive it's flaws."
"This is a pretty good brown ale. It poured with a translucent deep brown color and a big sticky head. The taste featured some roasted grain, sweet malt, a hint of chocolate malt, and just a hint of vegetable. The mouthfeel is good, if a little thin, the beer just kind of feels mass produced. Overall, it's an easy to drink take on the style."
"D: Fine. Easy to drink for sure and I'd have one if it were placed in front of me. Given the choice, though, there are better brown ales I'd rather have."
"M + D: Body is reasonable, with a nice snap of carbonation. When coupled with a meal (chicken-pesto pizza, in this case), it becomes nicer to drink, but I don't really see myself drinking much of this one on its own."
"D - Great, this is a well thought out brew. Good, sessionable, and well rounded. I can see trying this one again, reco."
"I usually issue the standard caveat with judging brown ale that this is far from my favorite style. This beer falls in line with many other brown ales I've tried: it's fairly good, certainly drinkable, but not a Wow! beer, not one to demand re-purchasing. Decent and refreshing, like the majority of Saranac wares I've tried. I'm done with the Saranac sampler session, and am rather glad for it. A couple very good beers, but more middle-of-the-road beers."
"It's alright but there is room for improvement. Pretty average; I wouldn't pick this over other browns, in all honesty."
"I would consider this an average brown ale. Not really anything that I'd buy again but still decent."
"As far as drinkability is concerned, its a pretty decent brown ale that, like most brown ales, you wont be drinking a large amount of due to it being somewhat filling. But it is one that can be enjoyed regularly as it is, much like many other Saranac brew, a good, solid example of the style, not entirely interesting or particularly special, but a fine example."
"D: Quite drinkable and a nice brew in the Saranac arsenal."
"The beer poured a nice dark brown with fluffy long-lasting head. The smell is mostly of sweet malts, hops, and a little bit of yeast. The taste starts off with a bit of roasted malt sweetness that's cut by a hop bite and a little bit of smokiness on the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is a little watery, and the beer sits a little heavy for me to immediately want to grab another one."
"Fairly drinkable; acceptable as a winter session beer, if the taste suits you."
"Another sample drink from Saranac. The appearance was pretty good: brown-amberish colors with a really thick head. The smell had hints of roast malt, grain and some chocolate. The taste was bitter but a little lacking in any of the aroma flavors. It was way too watery. The mouthfeel was then utterly unimpressive. Overall, the drink looks good but the taste and feel are way too thin and watery."
" It was a medium sized beer that was quite filling, definitley an enjoyable beer after a meal but before a desert. It would go well with a cheesecake or canoly, much as a good stout would, which I think says something about the range of the brown ale. Although filling, it does not negate your craving for another, beingthat it was just that good of a beer. (a problem that I usually encounter with brown ale)"
"saranac sampler 12. pours a dark brown w/ a slight head which dissapates quickly plenty of lacing;malty w/ caramel undertones kinda fruity hop aroma; malty flavor w/ plenty of hop flavor, not quite balanced; a little thin on the palate for the flavor, an otherwise drinkable beer..."
"the taste is nice enough. it has a nut caramel with some coffe as well. its creamy and smooth on the finish and worth a try. its not the best brown ale ive ever had, but its very good just the same"
"overall this is a very nice refreshing beer that i enjoyed"
"Right off the bat, this produced a nice, foamy, two fingers worth of eggshell-white head. The color was a carmel-color brown with amber highlights. The nose was malty sweet and the mouthfeel was on the thin side. I got a nice jolt of chocolate on the tongue and the finish had both a smoky and a sweet flavor to it, kind of like semisweet chocolate. This was quite enjoyable, especially after a day of administering a high-stakes test to high school 11th grade students. A nice way to unwind without numbing myself with hops."
"This is the best ive tasted from Saranac, a nice surprise. A clean pour, minimal head. Slight roasted malt, nice semi-sweet chocolate bitterness and flavor. Smooth hop flavor, less than i like in a brown ale, but it works with the mild malts. Slight smokiness on the back-end lends some complexity. Like other Saranac offerings this one is watered down, but somehow this time it works. Light bodied and sessionable."
"Drinkability - Not a brown ale, Saranac beers are not that bad. Bought this is a winter pack."
"Dark brown with a touch of red. Head is medium-sized, light tan, frothy and slow to diminish, leaving a good bit of sticky lacing behind. The smell is nice and hoppy for a brown ale. Pine and chocolate malt are most prevalent. The taste is definitely more malty than the nose. Molasses, spice, and citrus rind. The finish is bitter, citrusy and lightly floral. It has a medium-full body, dry texture and soft carbonation. This is a very pleasant offering from Saranac. Bigger than I was expecting from them. Nothing really outstanding, but nothing out of place."
"12oz brown bottle with no freshness date. Pours a clear medium brown with a big frothy head, decent longevity and nice lace. Aromas of subtle but decent caramel malts with a decent citrus and ale ""fruityness"". Upon tasting you get a fair amount of hop flavor - citrusy with some bitterness. Unfortunately the malt presence is too low to balance the nice hop flavor. A nicely made beer but not quite balanced enough."
"D: Very well done. Well-balanced and integrated. Bright. Bold. American."
"The beer pours a nice ruby red/brown color with a thick frothy offwhite head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a semi-sweet malt nose that boasts of pale and crystal malts. It's balanced well with a nice hop aroma. The taste is decent. It has a crisp flavor that has hints of chocolate and crystal malts. It is quite bitter and hoppy in the finish. The mouthfeel is average. It is a medium bodied beer with too much carboination. This is an average brown ale at best. I like the hops, but they are more pronounced than the malts. I like a maltier brown ale, especially ones that are hoppy. Also, the CO2 needs to be reduced a bit."
"Not a bad stab, but there are better browns out there, maybe this should be classified as a 'pale brown,' or something else to signify the hop presense."
"Unbalanced in flavor and mouthfeel for the style, but not highly unpleasant. A slightly above average Brown Ale, marred by the rough and overspiced, floral hop character."
"Drinkability: Decently drinkable, but the unbalanced nature of this beer hurts it a bit, at least from what is expected."
"A decent effort. Would go good with a chocolate dessert. An average beer compared to the style. Not exactly textbook definition of flavors. Worthy a try out of the mixed pack, but not much else."
"I don't know...this is actually okay, but I think it misses its style mark. Saranac have tried so many different styles, a zillion and six or something...Now being halfway through their winter 12-pack sampler, I feel like they could do better by reeling it in and putting their efforts into just a few styles, playing on their strengths rather than thinning themselves out and losing focus. But they didn't ask me, and why should they?"
"Medium thickness. The hoppy bitterness is a nice, sharp contrast to the thick malt. Very drinkable; a solid Saranac, due to its hoppy kick."
"Md-light body and sharp carbonation. Quite nice lacing on the inside of the glass."
"-Oelergud"
"This is a brownish-copper beer, clear and shadowy, with a modest off-white head. The first aroma is of American hops. It has a citric (grapefruit) quality, with some fresh floral smells. Right behind the hops, though, are some caramel and chocolate malt smells. Theyre not intense, but they compose a nice second-layer to the beer. The flavor is fairly dry, with a nice mix between some resiny-bitter hops and a highly-roasted maltiness. The carbonation is fairly high, maybe more than is necessary. Medium body, with a dry and bitter finish. This is a very nice beer, one that I could drink on almost any occasion."
"Pours a clear, red-mahogany shade with orange highlights. Extra dense pale-biege head of three fingers holds extremely well leaving sticky patterns of lacing. Caramel and tea aroma, with soft and faint earthy hop notes. Crystal malt taste upfront, soon met by sharp toasted victory malt and dextrinous munich flavors. Herbal and slightly fruity american hop flavors dry out the aftertaste, with a balanced level of bitterness. The body is medium and the carbonation is light and fine, just crisp enough to handle the sweet toasty-caramel and dextrinous malt profile and dry hop character that compliments it. Finishes with mild residual sweetness and countering hop flavor and bitterness. This is pleasing to the palatte with respectable depth that turns out very drinkable, the Matt brewing Co. is good at doing that."
"Cheers!"
"A tad nutty and robust with some hints of milk chocolate and a touch of sweet caramel drizzle coming through. Nice biting hop presence on the finish. Smooth and quite drinkable. Certainly one of the best out of the Saranac Winter Seasonal 12 pack."
"Poured a brown color with amber tones, small head which dissipated quickly, no lacing. The smell is of earth, juicy, buddy hops. Has a strong hop taste, grape fruit like with malty caramel tones. The mouthfeel is light considering the malty look to it, good carbonation and no lingering bitterness. This ale went down smooth enough, good for a single tasting. This is quite hoppy for a brown ale, would have expected more of a nutty/roasted flavor to it."
"Overall- A very good 1. Saranac's best offering!"
"Appears a deep ruby amber copper hue with a large off white tannish beige head billows nicely presenting a biscuit appearance light cappucion colored evenly dispersed lace. Aroma has an awesome upfront citrus and herbal hop tone with chocolate caramel roasty tones...good stuff hop pellets. Flavor contains upfront herbal and citrus hop character produces some mild hop burps nice for a brown, mild light chocolate roasty nutty edge very nice moderately bitter, overall I'm liking it. Mouthfeel has a medium body some resinous note coming through with a moderate smooth carbonation. Drinkability is great a hoppy brown I love it, but why does their brown taste hoppier than their IPA does."
"Another easy to drink, middle of the road Saranac beer."
"so far this is the best out of the 12 beers of christmas pack. right off , the beer looks really good. nice brown with a creamy white head. the lacin does stay throughout. someone else said it before, but i too was very suprised by the taste. very hoppy tasting right in the start that lends way to a kind of grassy grapefruit-like taste. no caramel, no coffee. just not what i really expected out of a brown ale. that being said, this beer is highly drinkable and i'd love to ry this on tap. something i'm noticing about saranac beers as i get through the sampler is their lack of mouthfeel. or maybe it's that they all taste the same ? it's like they started with a beer and just added slight things to call it something else. kind of strange."
"Fairly reserved appearance, subtle yet a bit enticing with solid lacing. The aroma is surprisingly hoppy, with citrus notes coming through with only a tiny hint of malt sweetness. I would definitely prefer to smell more sweet malts in there as well as taste them. It's odd to me to drink a brown ale with this much hoppiness to it. At the same time, it's not really a turn off either, just not what I expect out of a Brown Ale. Perhaps it needs to mature a bit longer? This experience is really like drinking a solid American Pale Ale rather than a Brown. If you want a sweet and mild Brown Ale, go with an English one, however this is worth a try because it's still a smooth-drinking, citrusy/spicy hoppy brew."
"Good roasty flavor after a sip followed by a polite helping of hops nothing overpowering altogether a surprisingly good beer by Saranac even though it does quite a bit remind me of a Sammy A"
"D: Not bad. This one was different from most brown ales, which l liked. Could use a touch of tweeking, but could easily be an innovative brew. Worth trying."
"Another new offering from Matt and I really like where they were going with this one.Poured a medium chesnut brown with a thinner but well reatined off white head,ahh nice hops in the nose Pacific NW cascades give off a healthy dose of pine and grass intertwined with some chocolate malt.The flavors dont quite live up to the nose but it has its own character quite dry and resiny with lighter chocolate and caramel tones.Good to see Matt push the bar a little with this one nice hop profile and very drinkable."
"From the 2006 Winter Seasonal Pack. 12 ouncer, no freshness indication. Pours a warm shade of darkish amber, clear, dart tan head, scattered lacing upon a gentle swirl. Nose is caramel malts, light pine needles and orange. Flavorful Brown, maple malt o'pleanty, I agree with another rater that this is one of the best in the box...which is not saying a great deal, but this is a pretty tasty and worthy brown ale..."
"From the 2006 Winter Sampler. Interesting take. IMO not really on style but one of the better selections in the Sampler. Look is right on style with very good lacing which keeps for entire drink. Not much aroma, but the taste is what is most surprising. The first thing you taste is the hoppiness of the beer, which almost immediately gives way to a licorice flavor. No chocolate to speak of but a hint of roastiness, not much hop bitterness on the finish. Mouthfeel is good and the drinkability is ok. While not a traditional take, very good nonetheless."
"The taste is more of that citrusy and grassy hops, with a distinct nuttiness in the background. Very little malt character. Blindfolded you could almost mistake it for a pale ale in my opinion, the hops were that prevelant. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't an awful beer, but I was expecting a brown ale and this sure didn't taste like one. Mouthfeel was chewy and full. It's a fairly drinkable ale. Really it's not bad. Just not what I was expecting, and not a good example of a brown, in my opinion."
"Winter pack beer....Pours a dark brown color with a big, thick head with good retention and lacing (poured from a bottle into a mug). Has a fairly malty smell to it...with hints of fruitiness, and nutiness. The taste goes along with the smell..suprisingly malty with a definate fruitiness and nutiness. Not very bitter. Has a lighter feel in the mouth with a good amount of carbonation. Overall, a good beer..one I would suggest to others..."
"D: I have noticed that all Saranac beers taste somewhat similar, and that disappoints me because I have held Saranac in high esteem since my earliest introduction to craft brewed beers. I will continue to give them a shot in hopes of a turn-around."
"Highly carbonated, almost overflowed in my pint glass with a moderate pour. Appealing red hue with a very large thick head of big tan bubbles. Aroma catches me off guard A bit of a centennial(?) hop nose. Light sweet grapefruit? Taste is rich with a nice blend of the citrus hops and a bit of chocolate malt. Lingering pleasant bitterness in the aftertaste. No where near what I was expecting. A very pleasant surprise. A departure from the same old sweet/burnt/musty brown ales, but not quite the same as a regular pale ale or hoppy amber. Great beer."
"Drinkability: decent brown ale that can be considered a session beer. Not a flavor cutting edge brown ale, but a solid offering worth trying."
"I think Saranac may have a winner here in their mixed twelve. this is by far one of the best of the twelve, and one of their better offerings. It is not a fantastic brown, but I'd consider it a nice, light, session beer. It's good enough to enjoy, but not complex or interesting enough to make you really think about it. Fairly generic as brown ales go."
"Poured 12 oz bottle into a glass mug. The appearance was quite nice; a full-bodied, dark brown color with a off-white head. The head was so thick that I had some problems smelling the contents of the beer. A slight tilt towards the nostrils exposed the hoppy smell. At first, all I tasted was hops but about a quarter to halfway through the beer, the slightly chocalate malt began to show itself, being balanced off by the hops. The mouthfeel was not as thick as I had hoped it to be. Once you get into the beer, it's pretty drinkable, but the hops hit you on the first sip (about as hoppy as a pale ale)."
"A hoppy brown ale from Saranac, who'd expect that? It's not up to an indian brown, but the hops are on par with at least an average tasting pale ale. The brown does get a little lost in here. There's a hint of malt in the aroma, with a little sweet caramel and chocolate in the flavor, but grassy and citrus hops dominate this brown. That not necessarily bad, but this beer would stand up better with more of a malt profile to compete with the hops."
"Overall an easy drinking brown ale. A step up from the nut brown."
"Not very good. I poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. There was a ton of head with a good retention time that left lots of sticky lace. The smell was very sweet, and reminded me of wisky. The taste was also sweet too, but not that bad, the malt wasn't blended very well. Don't drink and review."
"I like sweeter, maltier brown ales, but this is an ok example of a quite dry, moderately hopped one. A decent addition to the winter sampler."
