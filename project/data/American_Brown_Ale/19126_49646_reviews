"This is a real treat. Anymore, it seems that brewers like to add to many American hops to bitter their browns, but this one is well-balanced between malty goodness with just enough hops to really make it a winner in my book."

"AVerage brown ale.  Bready and nutty."
"Pretty surprised this own gold at GABF.  Not bad really but very average brown ale overall.  Leans heavily on malt which gives off a strong sour bread taste.  Some hints of gingerbread and nuts.  I prefer my browns to be a bit fuller and bolder."

"GABF Gold medal winner. I have friends that don't like ""dark"" beers, they taste Sweet Josie and LOVE it."
"O: There are a lot of poor brown ales out there these days but this is an overall nice one -- balanced and drinkable with plenty of flavor and no obvious flaws."

"A big thanks to the creator of the canquest, woodychandler, for this beer. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a dark mahagony color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of bready malts, some nuts. Taste is malts, nutty, some hops, bready, a bit of caramel, very smooth. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall a solid and enjoyable beer."

"Dark mahogany body with an inch of beige head. Fruity, dark malt, candy, molasses. Similar flavor. Medium to light body. Decent."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Smells like a porter with deep toasted bread.  The flavor follows this smell accurately.  The body is middle of the road."
""
""
"O: Overall I think this is a fairly outstanding brown, I'm not a huge brown fan, but this one might be changing that.  I feel like a lot of browns are humdrum, and this one is interesting, and delicious."
""
""
"Good roasty malty brown ale. Not overly bitter, and well balanced."
"Aroma is nutty and toasted, with hints of chocolate, roasty malt, and floral hops. Flavor reveals a roasted malt backbone, which is accented by toasted nuts, burnt breadcrust, and lightly sweet chocolate. The finish is lightly bitter. Great malt complexity."

"Poured from a can into a shaker pint, the beer is a dark, crystal clear, brown coloring with hazelnut highlights and a tall, foamy, dense, creamy, coffee ice cream colored head. Aromas of mocha sweet and bitter forward, with a cream backbone, subtle nut sweetness, and roasted notes. Smooth and balanced nose. Flavors are nut sweet forward, with that bittersweet mocha coffee flavor right behind in the backbone. Creamy highlights help blend everything together, and with the subtle roast and char notes, this balances out nicely. Light and smooth in mouth, with a candy sweet aftertaste of nut, chocolate, and subtle coffee bitters. Smooth, slightly lingering finish. This is a solid, easy drinking beer."

"o - Definitely a great idea, it just needs more character and body. If I find after opening another bottle that this one was faulty, I'll re-review."

"Almost perfect. Hops are correct for this ale. Beautiful color. Always consistent. An excellent one beer beer to drink. Does not loose it's attractiveness after tasting other beers. One you will always come back to again. Love it's aroma. Strong enough to have some bite when 1st tasting every time, yet keeps delivering for each one. Alcohol content is enough for you to know you're drinking this beer at half a bottle. Does not loose it's flavor as temperature changes. Great to grill with. It's that ""I've got this beer you've got to try"" when entertaining. Very impressive and simple, not too much going on like some beers. I'm sure all beer lovers will enjoy this one for its drinkable attitude."

"Pours a clear, dark brown color. 1/5 inch head of an off-white color. Decent retention and decent lacing. Smells of sweet malt, slight roasted malt, slight hop, yeast, and a hint of chocolate. Fits the style of an American Brown. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, slight roasted malt, hint of yeast, hops, and hint of alcohol. Overall, weak appearance, but average aroma, feel, and body."

"Poured a dark brown body with one finger head on top of a hearty aroma of roasted malts, some bread to them, caramel and a good amount of chocolate. Unfortunately, the beer itself does not deliver like the aroma. Medium bodied, a little sticky, I get some minor sweetness from caramel and chocolate but there doesn't seem to be any balance as the roasted malts dominant and the beer is mostly dry with a drying finish. And there really isn't much more to say because this is not a real flavorful beer, either (not going to say it's watery, though)."
""
"Overall: A good example of Brown Ale. Refreshing and has just enough body to it to be a good drinking beer."

"Overall 3.5: Not a bad beer by any means, and a pretty good brown ale. I would imagine that this is the type of beer that would be great with food and I would love to try it on tap. that said, brown ales are not my favorite type of beer and -that notwithstanding-- I would nonetheless recommend this beer to lovers of brown ales. Whoever you are."
"What I like best about this is that it gives aromas, flavors, and the sweetness of a darker beer with an ABV that's kicked up just a bit, but still light enough that you can enjoy a couple of them over dinner."
""
""
"The feel was rather thin, not necessarily watery, but easy enough. The body was very fizzy but the feel avoided any negatives from the carbonation."

"Carbonation is moderate and makes for a creamy feel off a light crispness. It develops the feel of an English brown to a point with a sort of metallic aspect and a little bit of chalkiness into the finish. It's nice to see a sturdy body in a style that sometimes neglects it."
""
"Overall: Easy drinking, (dark side of) malty brown ale."
""
""
""
"I poured this nice beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was very black indeed. The beer pored a fair head with a tan coloring to it. The smell was of roasted coffee and nuts. Head ended up going away pretty fast. The good news though is that the beer was very smooth and very nice tasting. I would certainly buy this beer again."
""
""
""
"O: Overall, no flavors stand out too strongly to me, but I'm a beginner at this. Mainly I think it is just a nicely balanced brown ale, with no one flavor grabbing you or distracting you. A great beer to have with a meal. And I believe that's how a brown ale should be, nothing too fancy, just a good rounded beer."

"O - one of the better brown ales, wish more places in Charlotte had this on tap. Fans of brown (ale...) should give this a try."
""
""
"O: Definitely worth a try . I really enjoyed this and would buy this regularly if it were a local. I used to be a regular Brooklyn Brown ale fan, but have found it to be a little lighter than I prefer a brown ale now."

"O: A enjoyable dark beer, a bit richer flavor than I was anticipating from the bottles well balanced description."

"A really solid brown ale. When i think of a good brown ale, these are the flavors and aromas I think of."
"O - Sweet Josie, offering a smooth, voluptuous body and excellent taste is one seductive brown ale, through and through. Roast notes push this beer towards porter borders while it's round sweetness and drinkability offers a nice balance. I'd kill for a few of these on a cool fall day!"
"Very solid brown ale. Sweet, but not cloying. I'd like to try this fresh."
""
""

"Palo Santo this beer is not. It is a highly drinkable and tasty beer, though, and one I would be happy to drink again."

"This is a good pub beer to be enjoyed with a burger or on the deck with pals."

"Overall pretty good brown ale. Too high octane for a session beer, but I could certainly enjoy a few of these."
""
""

"Overall: It's pretty good. Quite a light beer really, none of the aspects are overwhelming at all, but there's a nice mixture of characteristics and delicate flavours."

"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a chilled pint glass. Half finger head with some lacing dissipated within a few minutes. very nice color; a deep brown, slightly ruby. Smelled of roasted nuts, but only minimally with a hint of chocolate. Medium body with a bold mouthfeel. Definite taste of chocolate malts with a bit of nuts and hint of coffee. Hops are noticeable as well as the alcohol. A bitter/sweet brown. Overall very nice American Brown."
"O - A decent brown. A little sweet for the style....hence the name ""Sweet"" Josie."
""
""
"This was pretty good, but I had higher hopes for a brown ale. It's got a lot of good malt, caramel flavor, and a decent laced foam head. The 6.1% abv is nice too. It's just missing that ""it"" factor. But overall, I did enjoy it and thought it was good."
"From my home tap, this one looks gorgeous in the glass, with a warm, reddish, deep-but-still-translucent medium brown color and capped by a thick, foamy, tan head that clings to the glass after every sip. The aroma is likewise thoroughly enticing, with a dry, bittersweet chocolate character and a bit of minerality. The flavor is similarly only slightly sweet, with a slight bready sweetness creeping into the mostly dry, roasty, chocolaty profile. The flavor is also a bit grainy and astringent, however, especially in the aftertaste, which detracts from the nice balance of flavors. The light body and light carbonation helps it all go down smoothly, though. Overall, this one doesn't slide too far to either the sweet or the bitter sides of the spectrum, making it an easy-to-drink yet flavorful brown ale"
"Strong, malty aroma has notes of yeast, cinnamon and caramel and just a hint of molasses. It pours a somewhat transparent warm brown with a fairly thick and fine-bubbled tan head. Flavor does not quite live up to the aroma, having malty, caramel and cinnamon notes but a bit of a metallic tang and a bitter undertone that is not hoppy. Texture has average body and only a little fizz. Well, maybe this bottle came from a not-so-hot batch. A decent ale nonetheless. Give it a try."
"Overall a well put together brown ale that is not too sweet and has decent bitterness. Glad I was able to try."
""
"Overall a fantastic Brown Ale that had just the right amount of bitter sweetness and a surprising hoppiness at the end."
""
""
""
"O - I enjoyed this brown ale...there were notes of chocolate and toffee and even softer notes of nuts...the body was never too sweet or heavy so you could have more than just one"
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is decent in this one. Nothing special but there is a nice pinch of hops and a light carbonation that I keep thinking should be bigger. Smooth and slick with a malt finish that seems to cover your teeth long after its gone. A tasty beverage with more flavor then I was expecting. Good for those who like the dark beers and well worth checking out. I'd buy again in a minute."

"O: A pleasant surprise to find in the snack/drink area in the lobby of the Courtyard Marriott just a short distance from the Raleigh-Durham airport. Very drinkable and enjoyable. Would definitely have another."
"o - overall, a decent brown ale that is worth trying. the earthiness is pretty dominant making it a bit unique, but not tailored for my tastes."
"This is a wonderful brown ale. Definitely worth getting a keg of. Also, a good judge of a beer in my opinion is how the guys oogle over it and choose it over everything else in the fridge. It is that kind of beer, and even though I'm not a huge fan of the brown, I could drink quite a bit of it. I also just like Lone Rider, even though this and Shotgun Betty are really their two best at the moment. Still, if you are in the Raleigh or Durham, NC area and have to visit a tavern- go to Big Boss. Big Boss's ales (especially the stuff like the ""wooden monkey"" (they made these for a while then stopped- why?) and ""sneak attack"" (a short run) are awesome- even though they don't have them on tap at the tavern. Anyway- I digress. Sweet Josie is a must buy, and get a keg."
"Drinkability is solid, as is this brew, a nice punch flavor but smooth and balanced."
"Overall: This beer was okay, but I probably wouldn't have it again any time soon unless there wasn't much selection."
"Medium-full body with a good efdervescence. Ever so lightly warming. A very good beer."
"Overall, a fairly average brown ale. Easy to drink and fits the style fine."
"Pours a deep amber with a light lacing of head. Nose offers caramel and nutty malts. Taste is caramel, then nutty, then...coffee? Yeah, I think that's what that was. This beer is medium bodied, smooth. Overall, this is a solid beer. Lonerider continues to impress."
"O- this is a good brew from the south that can always be enjoyed. I would take more anytime"
"When I think of Brown Ales I really don't think of complexity, and when I find one that is seriously complex, it's a shock and unfortunately raises the bar for the style. I've had some Brown Ales that have completely blown me away before, much like Dogfish Head's Indian Brown Ale, but it's nothing typical for the style. Sweet Josie was a very solid example of a base line, traditional American Brown - not bad."
"Overall a really good solid brown ale that these guys make."
" Lonerider hit a homerun here my friends. A beer for all seasons. Sweet Josie is sexy, built and fun to be with ..."
"O: Overall, one of the better regular brown ales out there. I'm admittedly not the biggest brown ale fan and find many of them to be plain, but this one is full of flavor and quite nice."
"O: Good but a bit too sweet."
"I love the Man with no Name picture on the crown."
"Okay, got this on tap at Icehouse. Nice color -- brown -- fitting. Nice head and good lacing. The smell was okay. Probably the only lacking characteristic. The taste was pretty good. Nice layering and super subtle. Nothing overpowering anywhere. Nice blend. The mouthfeel was the same with good carbonation. Overall, this was a really a pretty good brown."
"Not a bad beer at all. Nice extra to throw in thanks, dsc I believe?"
"Have tried this beer on tap at a few different locations including a brewery tour. Beautiful brown color with a great chocolate, caramel smell. Very smooth mouthfeel with exeptional sweet taste. This is a very exceptional well balanced brown ale. I look forward to lonerider expanding their beer portfolio. Awesome beers guys."
"Drink- This was a nice extra and I am very glad I got to try it. If I am ever in NC I will have to visit this brewery."
"On tap at Sticks and Sones in Greensboro.Poured from the tap into a standard pint glass a deep roasted chesnut brown with some ruby tinge,a 1/2 finger beige colored head atop.Aromas were a little light with chocolate malts mainly sticking out with light roastiness as well.Well rounded on the palate with sweetish chocolate and a hint of brown sugar,firm graininess and light earth in the finish to keep it balanced.A pretty rich tasting brown,one of the better browns I have had in a while I gotta say."
"Had this in the bottle at a friends house. He's a big Lonerider fan, which I am still trying to understand. Maybe he met a girl there. Or a girl works there that he likes. Who knows. Anyway, it had a nice deep brown appearance. No real head to speak of. Lots of brown sugar in the smell. I will say that the smell matches the flavor. Okay body with a little carbonation. I hear this beer won a gold. Not sure if it was this one or not. My friend has a tendency to talk up Lonerider. But it was an okay brown. I may have to disagree with him a bit and give it a better than average ranking."
"overall: an average brown ale, nothing offensive and easy drinking. im glad i got the chance to try it."
"Fairly decent ale, good flavors, enjoyable experience, not stellar but a good execution."
"Clear, deep brown color with a thin, creamy off-white head. Nutty caramel malt and chocolate aroma...hint of maple and brown sugar. Sweet cocoa and caramel malty flavor with a touch of earthy hops in the finish. Pretty well balanced, though not as smooth as I'd like. Medium bodied, fine carbonation, and a bit drying. A well made, standard brown ale."
"D- a decent brew and it would be worth a purchase no doubt. I am leary of the chocolate and coffee not complementing each other in flavor rather than nose."
"Dark brown in color with a nice fluffy textured head. Lot's of sticky lacing lines the sides of the glass as it empties. Interesting aroma. Toasted malts, mixed nuts and a hint of pine trees. Wow this is good. Think caramel biscuits with some bite. I'm pretty sure it's the hops that is giving it the bite but I can't quite place the flavor. It's kind of an earthy spicy hop. This is really good and my review doesn't give it justice. Good crisp mouthfeel and very quaffable. I'm very impressed with the 2 beers I've had from Lonerider and look forward to trying more."
"D: A very drinkable brown ale; almost refreshing! Although its not the most flavorful, still good."
"D - This was a drinkable brown, but not as good for me as Smuttynose's Old Brown Dog, or Brooklyn Brown"
"D: The beer goes down smoothly and would be a good accompaniment with food because the flavors in the taste aren't very strong."
"draft at Tap City, Raleigh"
"overall it was pretty damn solid and an easy to drink brown ale on a hot day."
"On tap at the ""hideout", which is an old warehouse converted into a brewery. Tanks everywhere its quite a site to see. Pour is dark brown with a thin tan head. Aroma is chalked full of roast, chocolate malts and hazelnut. Flavor really follows suit. Light buttery presence that really doesnt mesh well"
"D: Easily drinkable, especially for this style. Many will be drawn to the good balance and finish in this beer."
"Tastes of roasted malt, nut, coffee, caramel, light brown sugar and light hops. Very nice balanced malt and coffee taste which has a slight hop zing of bitterness. A very good brown ale, with an overall light feel, good flavor and a nice mouthfeel."
"Had on tap during brewery tour. Pours a nice brown color that is almost solid. Slight tan head with some lacing. Very nice maltly flavor that is balanced well with a little touch of hops. Mouthfeel is light, but it does not take away from the drinkablity. Purchased a growler of this before I left and will have them tonight. Looking forward to having this one on the home tap."
"I hadn't had much Lonerider before tonight but this is certainly a welcome addition to the Raleigh beer scene."
"Overall my first experience with Lonerider has been positive, and I hope as they mature they will tweak their recipes, as they have a lot of potential"
"On-tap at Flying Saucer served in a standard pint-glass a crisp dark brown with a thin diminishing tan head. Aroma is a decent amount of caramel, burnt toast and slight brown sugar. The taste is a decent amount of brown malts, brown sugar and slight Earthy hops. The beer is on the light side of medium with decent carbonation. This is a very enjoyable brown ale, I hope LoneRider keeps the new beers coming!"
