I'm actually surprised at how well the essence of pecans are contained in the aroma. Not much else comes through on the nose. The taste unfortunately does not feature the nice nutty nose the nose has. Instead, I get a bland and fizzy flavorless liquid. Almost adjunct lager flavorless. This is disappointing as the nose is quite promising. Up front I get watered down malt, this is followed by a tinge of nuttiness and a hint of sweetness. No hops to speak of. Mouthfeel is light and fizzy. Overall this is a let down.","homebrew311","Oct 05, 2014"

As another reviewer noted, I didn't detect much, if any, nuttiness in it.  But it poured in a manner my unsophisticated self doesn't have words for; a fantastic, solid-cloudy color I don't know what to call.  Decent ""ale"" flavor; not too overboard, but not washed out like some seem.  Definitely drinkable and refreshing.  Maybe it benefits from my very low expectations for it, but I liked it well enough to rate it higher than most.  Won't seek it out, but would chose it over some other stuff if given choices.","EHopkinsi","Oct 04, 2014"

I detected maybe some nuttiness to it, but it was thick and sweet and that is about all you get. Its a nice looking beer. Has a good aroma of caramel, the slightest amount of nuttiness, I assume that is the pecans. It had a lot of head that really never tamed down. I was interested in trying this one. I have seen it for years, but its not one I would drink regularly. Its too sweet for my taste. If you like your beers to taste like a stuckey's pecan roll, then go for it!","humuloner22","Sep 30, 2014"

The pecan and caramel is there from beginning to end, and that's it. There's no other dimension of flavor. There's not much of a bitterness. It's not bad by any means, but it's very, VERY one-note. Carbonation is quite high, and the feel is pretty low. I don't love it, but this is actually a very solid, sessionable brew. If you're looking for something to send your taste buds on a ride, this may not be it, but it's still a decent beer.","Alextricity","Oct 12, 2013"

This beer had good drinkability, it was very smooth, not filling and the taste did a good job at holding my attention, I wouldn't have a problem drinking a couple of these. What I liked the most about this beer was how true to it's name it was, it was just as advertised. What I liked the least about this beer was the mouthfeeel, I thought it was a little thin and watery. I would buy this beer again as a nice fall time beer and it was priced nicely. I would recommend this to anyone who likes nutty beers. All in all I enjoyed this beer and I think it's one of the better Abita beers that I have tried so far.

Pours fairly hazy orange amber color with a 1-2 finger dense cream colored head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of caramel, biscuit, toffee, toast, brown sugar, nuttiness, floral, and light fruitiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of malt notes. Taste of caramel, biscuit, toast, toffee, brown sugar, nuttiness, floral, and light fruitiness. Lingering notes of caramel, biscuit, toast, toffee, nuttiness, and floral on the finish for a bit. Nice and well balanced malt and nutty flavors; a little mild on flavor, but very pleasant; with no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a slightly creamy and very smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a good amber ale. Nice balance of flavors and very smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Apr 23, 2013"

3.5,5.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"i dont care what anyone says, i like this beer. not too many brewers use straight up nuts that i am aware of, and this beer features the pecan pretty well. the pours is that of an english brown ale, caramel brown, not too dark, with a foamy off white head an inch or so tall. the nose is real woody, not like oak, but like a two by four. really. some sweeter malts with a good toast on them as well as a touch of sweetness also add to the aroma. flavor matches well with the smell, its really dense and woody tasting, with the nuts obviously contributing more meat than sweet here. a little sugary in the finish, but hardly offensive. the mouthfeel works, bigger body but it remains pretty easy drinking with its vibrant carbonation and smooth finish. i put a 6er of these down pretty quick, and recommend this beer to anyone who is up for something a little different.","StonedTrippin","Nov 06, 2012"

Aroma is fairly mild, there's a slight nutty and malty sweetness to it, as well as a slight earthy note. Taste was pretty mild as well, earthy with a little roasted character. I think maybe I get a little nutty pecan flavor, maybe I'm just imagining it. Fairly highly carbonated and a medium body. It's a pleasant, easy drinking beer. Mouthfeel is rather oily, it feels like my mouth is being coated in oil with every sip, not very pleasant. Overall I was really disappointed with this beer, it looked so promising from the poor, but it just went downhill from there. Nothing spectacular about this one, and the oily characteristics just don't work for me. I won't be having this beer again.","scvance","Oct 24, 2012"
3.75,12.6,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"I decided to try this because I like Turbodog and Southern Pecan. Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. All around, this beer is pretty mild. In the nose, I get a slight hint of a sweet caramel flavor and a hint of the nuts. In the flavor, I think it is basically a less complex and milder form of Turbodog (though similar) , but I get a little more from the nut flavor. It also pours a lot lighter color (light brown) than most brown ales (especially English brown ales like Turbodog) but is very drinkable. This beer still has a lot of flavor though and it is definitely worth a try, and I would say it is a good example of the style.","BeerNoobNC","Beers"

The beer does look nice however, pouring a golden orange with a nice head, but as far as the other components I was disappointing. It really is too bad because the pecan flavor itself does taste nice and fresh but it needs to be paired with something to make this beer shine. Whether it be cinnamon, chocolate, or roasted malts anything would have really enhanced the flavoring but this was not the case.","RussBecker1","Oct 22, 2012"

Some lacing is left on the side of the glass during consumption. The pecan aroma comes through in the smell, adding a complementary subtle nuttiness to the sweet and bready malts. There's an earthy aroma present as well, which is a product of the Willamette hops. The flavor is of nutty pecan with the roasted malts up front. There's some mild sweetness in there from the caramel malt and some back end hop bitterness. The hops bring some of those earthy flavors I picked up in the nose. The body is light to medium with strong carbonation. The beer is smooth with high drinkability. This is an excellent beer.","acevenom","Oct 21, 2012"

A little oily, some pale and toasted malt taste. Not really sweet, but no serious bitterness either. Nut flavor is present, especially in the hind-taste. Medium, trending light, in body.

The nose comprises toasted biscuit, light honey, light toffee, and a vague sense of nuttiness (I can't say with any certainty that I'm smelling pecans, but it's definitely some sort of nut, anyway). The taste brings in more of the same, along with a hint of brown sugar-cinnamon. Unfortunately, everything is now watered-down, slightly blander than before.

3.96,18.9,3,4.5,4,3,4,"Pours out a light amber-orange color with minimal head that quickly recedes to a few white lingering bubbles. Nutty aroma with lots of caramel, hay and oats seem to scream out at me. Taste is nutty with burnt pecan and pecan shell bitterness, slight malt and caramel sweetness that is barely noticeable, some citrus notes make their way out towards the finish, very mild hop presence throughout the sip. Mouthfeel is light, but refreshing and smooth with average carbonation. Overall, this is a good beer, not too complex but an interesting addition with the pecans that made for an enjoyable brew.","jsdunlop","Oct 22, 2011"

The beer pours a brownish color with minimal head and lace, just the right amount. The beer goes down smooth and leaves a nice aftertaste on your pallette. The strength of this beer is definitely the uniqueness and goes down as more than a novelty beer. This is a worthy beer by any means.","ronniebruner","Oct 18, 2011"

It's a little sweet with some some caramel and vanilla notes,with a decent helping of maltiness. This is a nice light, refreshing beer, I gotta say that. It goes down real easy. The mouthfeel is real thin, and leaves very little behind except a tinge of bitterness. Overall, this is a decent beer.

The color of this beer is a nice golden brown with a slight cloudiness. The smell is caramel with a little earthiness and malt. The taste is caramel, bitterness with earthy and nut flavors. There is a woodiness here that makes for an interesting brew. Over all this is a pretty unique little beer. I didn't know what to expect when I bought this- and it surprised me.

The flavor was light bodied but nicely roasted with a touch of a bittering finish and a flavor full of earthy grain like tones. A nice subtle bread like base was quaintly masked underneath.

It tastes of sweet malts, perhaps some brown sugar or cinnamon, oily pecans and has a light and bitter finish. While drinking you actually eventually get more of a pecan pie type aftertaste which is interesting. It’s solid. The beer drinks pretty light and leaves some nice flavors behind. It’s a very sessionable beer and is interesting enough to drink a couple of them in a sitting.

Flavors are also good but lack the depth necessary to score a 4 in my book. Toasted malts dominate the front and mid-palate, with hints of pecan coming through but not as prominently as on the nose.

Abita, however, has infused this brew with the natural oils that come from pecans, and this extra layer gives the beer a nice, very subtle nutty flavor. It's by no means overpowering; in fact, if you didn't know the pecan layer was there, you probably wouldn't be able to pick it out.

Initially strikes the palate as very malty and sweet with a moderate mouthfeel. Medium-high carbonation but a disappointingly thin body. There's a simple sugary sweetness throughout, resembling honey at times. A subtle herbal taste lends a bit of complexity on the front end, but the beer shines when the nutty pecan character develops toward the back of the tongue and in the aftertaste.

Light amber to copper orange in color, good consistency throughout until some more yellow at the edges, transparent, no meaningfully visible bubbles. The nose offers a coating of molasses glaze to the base of roasted pecans, nothing very pushy or dominating here, not bready more like scones or hard biscuits, more pepper spice than and flowers or other softer element, maybe caramel, it's a toss-up but, overall, probably more malty than hoppy. Medium-bodied, sets itself in the mouth firmly, carbonation has strength but rarely exercises it. Sweeter in the mouth was upfront caramel, toffee, maple syrup notes, maybe even orange peel. The pecan component is middling, never absent but no star of the show either. Less general roastiness than expected. Oil, stream water, grass than something like banana and bubblegum, little by way of apricot, peach fruit.

The aroma was very nutty, which tended to mask any trace of malt or hop aroma, if present. The taste is initially nutty, but quickly fades. The beer itself felt very limp on the tougue, suggesting a light body which probably explains the dry finish and overall flavor.

The body is light to go with a beer charterized by a the right look of a fall leaves, in tones of orange/reddish colors.

Mouthfeel is light to medium, nice hop presence in the aftertaste.

The look is a bright golden / copper color that lands on the 'brown' side of balance. Tastes also very Amber Ale-ish with the same mild hint of buttery nuts. Lightly hopped and moderately malted, the beer lacks to standout with any distinguishable qualities. Feels a touch light on the palate, leaving way for a mild astingency to come through (may come from nut flavor additions). Light diacityl on the toung with a light buttery note.
