3.9,3.2,4,4,4,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 10/22/2013. Pours slightly hazy ruby brown color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of grapefruit, orange zest, lemon zest, caramel, toast, brown sugar, chocolate, coffee, light nuttiness, floral, grass, light pine, and floral/toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of hop and dark/roasted malt notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, brown sugar, toast, cocoa, light coffee, brown bread, light nuttiness, floral, grass, pine, and floral/toasted earthiness. Fair amount of earthy floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, brown sugar, cocoa, brown bread, light coffee, light nuttiness, floral, pine, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of dark/roast malt flavor with moderate hop presence; with good robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately creamy and smooth mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice imperial brown ale. All around good balance, complexity, and robustness of dark/roast malt and moderate hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 14, 2014"

3.87,2.4,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.75,"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, Good Humans is a deep amber-brown color with a very thin, cream colored head. Nose is surprisingly malt forward with hops being barely discernible. Malt nose includes chocolate, caramel, roasted coffee and toasted bread. Hops come through much more in the flavor but are still only to balance the strong malty backbone. Mouthfeel is lighter than expected with a velvety carbonation. Overall a good beer, could be a little stronger on the hops but definitely solid.","gmfessen","Jun 22, 2013"

The aroma smells leafy with green citrus, cocoa and roast all mixing together to give the nose a fresh ripe twang. The taste is fresh ripe citrus with a firm bitterness at its core. Tropical and herbal notes hang on the edges while a malty backbone of cocoa sweetness and roast flavor that leave a touch of char lingering in the finish along with some leftover green bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium with a firm creaminess that spreads out. This is pretty easy going in the mouth overall with just a touch of warmth to the proceedings. This was a more than serviceable take on the hoppy Brown Ale style with a good bit more going on with it than I expected. The really easy drinkability for 8% helped as well.

Pours a reddish brown, deeper copper with decent haze, a decent sized khaki head that settles to a film that laces a bit. Aromas are brown malts and nut, toffee and tobbacco, some vanilla, faint cocoa, soapy grapefruit hops and floral come in, with a bit of rind and grass. Toasty bread and caramel mixes with a good hopping. Initial is well hopped up front, bitter and floral with a touch of soap moves into caramel and toffee, biscuits and toasty bread, tobbacco, brown malts, earthy hops mix with grapefruit and tougher florals on the backend, providing a nice contrast from sticky sweet malts and stronger hops with good acidics. Medium bodied, a firm bitterness counters the sweeter malts of cocoa and caramel. Finish is nutty, floral, and pine with mellow sweetness having final say on the tounge, and bitterness going down the throat.

The smell is a little hoppy but does have a strong malt presence. The taste is good with caramel, oak and finishing with a nice bitterness balancing it out. Definitely a nice idea.

There's a tinge of malt backing, but the majority of the scent is a nice, cirtusy, floral hop goodness. The brew has an uncommon, yet delightful, flavor to it. You can taste the brown ale, you can taste the hops, but there's a quality, citrus balance in between it all. It tastes more like a well-balanced IPA than it does a brown ale; however, the amount of malt and slight bit of roastiness I taste within, makes it switch back and forth on my palate. The citrus/fruit undertone mellows out all the flavors and brings it back to earth. I really enjoying this brew's flavor.

Very complex and flavorful with a very dry finish.","corby112","Jan 30, 2010"

4.17,10.3,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"D - Really interesting brew here. Sweet and toasty, Good Humans offers a unique twist on a brown ale by incorporating quite a bit of citrusy hop character. Yum!","ffejherb","Jan 23, 2010"
3.85,1.9,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Got this one thanks to Telix. Pours a nice light golden brown with a thin white head that quickly fizzles to lacing. The smell is decent, some lightly roasted malts, a faint whiff of hops, coffee and chocolate. The taste is very similar, with lightly roasted malts providing subtle hints of coffee and chocolate, with hops providing a little bite in the finish. The mouthfeel is nice, with a medium body and good drinkability. Overall this a solid beer, with some nice complexity and excellent flavors. I could see enjoying quite a few of these.","PretzelCity","Jan 18, 2010"

3.94,4.2,3,4,4,4,4,"(D)- Yet another unique, yet tasty brew from Shorts! Certainly a different take on a brown ale with the addition of dry hopping. Not the best out there, but I respect Shorts for thinking outside the box.","sweemzander","Jan 14, 2010"
3.95,4.5,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Trippy label. The beer poured a bright, clear chestnut with a thin beige/tan cap of fine bubbles. A bit of sticky lace, decent head retention. Big citrus aroma, lots of grapefruit, with some caramel and earthy malt in the background. Sort of surprising, but nice. Bold hop flavour, juicy citrus, grapefruit, moderate to high bitterness with enough malt sweetness, caramel, faint nuts and chocolate, to provide some balance. It finished with a hint of alcohol and lingering combination of malts and bitterness. The body was lighter than expected, not thin exactly but headed in that direction. Carbonation was medium-low and the texture was malty with a bit of dryness once the sweetness dissipated. An interesting beer, plenty of flavour and quite tasty.","DrJay","Jan 13, 2010"
4.2,11.1,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours a pretty clear rustic amber brown with a two finger light khaki colored head that dies down to a thin layer. Bits of lacing here and there, but not much. Aroma is one of a kind; roasted coffee, citrus hops, and bready malts. I like the smell, but it could be bolder. Taste begins with toffee and caramel sweetness. Midway a good combination of earthy and tropical hop flavors emerge. Chocolatey Brown Ale characteristics linger in the aftertaste with just a splash of Cara Cara oranges. The taste is a wonderful (and totally unexpected) blend of Brown Ale and hoppy Pale Ale. Medium body with a steady carbonation and a slight tingle that remains on the tongue. Another solid and unique brew from Short's, I could definitely put a few of these bad boy's down.","BeerTruth","Jan 11, 2010"
3.8,0.5,4,4,4,3,3.5,"The bottom line is that I like different characteristics when they mesh together. Stouts are malt-heavy and lightly hopped. IPA's are hop-heavy and have small malt character. Short's attempted to bring the two most notable parts of beer together by producing a malt-heavy IPA, and pretty much succeeded. I could tip a few of these back because it's delightful, but what's its ABV? Its goal? I usually look this stuff up on the Internet before reviewing so I know exactly what the intent of a beer is. Short's, if you brew it again, let's call it a "dry-hopped dark amber ale"...that would have been perfect.","stevenseg","Jan 10, 2010"
4.32,14.3,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"This is now one of my favorite brown ales, and I prefer it to Surly Bender. Great job, Short's!","bmanning","Jan 09, 2010"
4,5.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Starts off with toasted grains, soapy sweetness, and subtle hop bitterness. Cola and caramel sweetness increase, along with herbal, resinous hoppiness. Slightly earthy, tobacco and chocolate flavors near the finish. Fruity alcohol contributes some warming. Grainy, herbal bitterness in the finish. Medium-full body with a somewhat sticky feel. Not bad, but a tad rough around the edges and not as cohesive as it could be.","alexgash","Jan 07, 2010"

3.57,-5.6,3.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"D: If you are into this style, I can imagine wanting to have a few. It's clearly the best of the Short's limited releases that I've had, which isn't saying much, but it's pretty good. I wish it tasted as good as it smelled!","Telix","Jan 06, 2010"
4.32,14.3,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"D: This has got to be at least eight or nine percent ABV, but it goes down smooth anyway. Clean and delicious.","danielharper","Dec 25, 2009"

3.99,5.6,4,5,3.5,3.5,4,"D: The flavors in this one are not too heavy and lend themselves well to drinking. The combination of the dry hopped aroma and the sweetness of the brown ale make a great combination.","spartanfan","Dec 24, 2009"
4.15,9.8,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"The sample came from the first bottle run put out by Short's. Their appearance on shelves cam with little warning and even less information. The majority of what is known comes from the bottle itself. The drinkability may be able to be scored more accurately if the ABV was available. With that being said, I am impressed by this brew. Very enjoyable and provides a pleasant warming feeling as it goes down which is welcome this time of year. Drinks smooth and easy making it one I would consider drinking a couple in a sitting. Once again hat's off to Joe and the gang for producing such a fine product.","kzoobrew","Beers"

3.65,-3.4,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall an ale that fell flat for me. Since there aren't many representatives of this style, I can't really compare it to a certain forerunner. I'll definitely try more Dbl. Brown Ales as I come across them, but I think I'll pass on this in the future. Glad I tried it though.","malty","Dec 19, 2009"
4.21,11.4,3.5,5,4,4,4,"D- A very unique beer that is definitely worth a try. A bit sweet and warm for my tastes, but I thoroughly enjoyed it as well. I wish this would be a regular offering.","david131","Beers"
