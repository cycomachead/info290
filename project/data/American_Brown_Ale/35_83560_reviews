"From the bottle at a party. No assessment of appearance. Aroma was caramel, hazelnut, maple syrup. Flavor is sweet malt, hazelnut, faint hop spice. Light to medium bodied, neither thick nor thin, high carbonation."

"Overall, an excellent brown ale that uses hazelnut as well as any beer I've had. Should be available year-round in six packs. Well done."

"Taste is toasty caramelly-earhty up front with hazel soon joining. The hazelnut is firm but not overpowering, it's pretty balanced and his toasty-bitter-sweet finish and aftertaste."
""
""
""
"I was caught completely caught off guard with this one. Thoroughly enjoyed it. Easy to drink, tasty (so long as you enjoy hazelnut), and a super smooth body make this a fantastic. I found this in a sampler and have not seen it in its own sixer which is a bit disappointing - this deserves a slot on the shelf all to itself. At this point, I should probably mention the enjoy by date on the botte is January. I'm reviewing in Febuary. I can't wait to get my hands on this and see hw much better it will be ""brewery fresh!"""

"What I really liked about the taste was its subtle bitterness and all-out hazelnut character. Relatively sweet and mild. It was very easy to drink. Sam Adams usually does it right."

"Wow, I left the Hazel Brown for the last beer to try out of a seasonal pack and boy, am I glad I did! This is by far the best brew from Sam Adams to date that I have tried. Gorgeous dark caramel color with hints of red and brown. The smell and taste matched perfectly - a distinct odor of hazelnut, a distant taste of cedar or something woodsy, and a smooth mouthfeel making it go down faster than it should. Overall, it was more than outstanding. I'll have to go out and order a specific six pack of this stuff to enjoy during the holidays."

"This beer was one of the better offerings in the Sam Adams Harvest Collection Variety Pack. The hazelnut flavor was quite pleasant and transformed a fairly ordinary brown ale into something interesting and enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
" At least the alcohol was on the light side and had I not given half of this pack away, I probably would have popped open the other in my sitting. The aroma was the best aspect of this but the sweetness was fleeting and this beer could have used more body and had more bite to it. On a quiet Fall day like this, it did the trick and was worth having once, to round out the other offerings in the Fall pack."
""
"Overall - Nice moderately dark malty brew. I thought from the aroma that this beer would be much richer - still very drinkable and flavorful."
"Overall - It something different from the average brown ale."
""
""
""
"The body isn't thin but thinnish, on the smaller end of medium. It's got slightly more than a modicum of crispness and smoothness."
""
""
""
"Overall: I can see others enjoying this beer, however, it is just not for me as I do not care for toffee flavor. Still was about to drink without a problem."

"DATE TASTED: October 11, 2013 ... GLASSWARE: Kisatsky's Tavern pint... OCCASION: drinking--enough said...APPEARANCE: dark brown body supports a dreamy white lacing; effervescence slows to a small stream of bubbles... AROMA: oaky, nutty fragrances merge with subtle, sugary/caramel hints to give the brew an intriguingly welcome wrinkle to the usually blander genre; a bit astringent at times...PALATE: medium-bodied, reasonably creamy and suitable for a crisp fall evening such as this...TASTE: toffee, sweet caramel and vanilla swirl to a palatable balance; moves beyond the average brown...OVERALL: a surprise in a mix pack of seasonals; I found this to be a beer I'd revisit when hosting Thanksgiving this year--and I believe the guests would appreciate it as well..."
""
""
"Overall - I think it is an above average offering that I would drink again, but it doesn't blow me away."

"Summary - Pretty good. Decent pick out of the Sam Adams Harvest Collection. Had with BBQ chicken, beans, and corn."
""
""
""
""
""
"A very mild beer with a fleeting hazelnut flavor. Some caramel and toffee, touch of bitterness to balance, lingering sweetness, Medium body that thins out on the back end. Overall pretty lackluster and boring but it's nothing offensive. I think it's time for sam to cut back on the amount of variety in their variety packs and stick to 4 solid styles that they brew."
""
""
""
"Overall: A tasty brew. Very unusual and pleasant for a mass producer. A risk taking and original experience. (some might find the hazel nut 'artificial', but I didn't find it any more so than either coffee syrup or hazelnut spreads.)"
""
"Definitely liked this more than I thought I would."

"This is a decent brown ale with a twist. I probably wouldn't get a six-pack of it, but as part of the mixer it's fine."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Solid and different. I might pick up more of these."
""

"The Verdict: Good beer. This normally isn’t my favorite style, but it’s a good, smooth beer that I wouldn’t turn down. Very well balanced with just the right amount of hazelnut."

"O- Mediocre beer. Starts bad, finishes just ok."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a wonderful beer from Sam Adams. This is the best I've had from them in awhile, possibly ever. It's very unique and is hitting on all cylinders. Highly recommended."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
""
"Brown colored brew. Aroma of hazelnut and vanilla. In the taste, nutty with notes of chocolate and brown sugar. Not overly sweet, but still candy like and creamy. This is delicious beer. Nutty and caramel like. Medium bodied, well carbonated and creamy. Overall this is a nice dessert beer from Boston Beer co."
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall i enjoyed this beer but it is not one of my favorites and was not anything extraordinary. I did enjoy the nutty smell and taste it had though."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Flavorful, though the mouthfeel - mainly the carbonation - detracts from this overall. The hazelnut is also a bit too much at times, seems artificial."
""
""
""
""
"This is an above average brown ale. It has a wonderful taste of hazel nuts and caramel. Great Brown color with a creamy white head. It's the perfect beer for sitting outside on a cool fall evening. Overall this is another high quality, great tasting beer from Boston Beer Co."
""
""
""
""
""
"Samuel Adams Hazel Brown ---3.5/5."
"O- The taste on this beer definitely would benefit being paired with the right foods. Not really a stand alone beer in my opinion. A bit tougher to just drink by itself. Could easily fit in with the right dessert pairing."
"Sweeter taste with a strong deep roast of hazelnuts. A bit sweet. Thin bodied and high in the carbonation. Short aftertaste. Relatively non-descript."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I was pretty happy with this one. Lots of good Autumn flavors coming through."
""
""
""
""
"Dark amber color with moderate head and mild carbonation. Strong toasted caramel, toffee, malt notes with a heavy hazelnut aroma. Very savory aroma. Toasted caramel and chocolate taste with a heavy heavy nuttiness that gives way to a little bitterness at the end of the sip. Not well balanced or easy to drink. The flavors are good but it's a special situation type of beer. It's nutty to the max and the nuttiness overshadows the entire rest of the beer. Would have gone great in a winter pack instead of an autumn pack."
""
"Low C"
""
""
""
"Overall: Solid brown ale. I love the taste of the cocoa, although I wish there was more hazelnut. I think this is my favorite of the current fall pack."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Flavor is similar, distinct hazelnut taste, mellow toasted grains, and light yeast character. Pretty clean and simple, medium bodied with ample carbonation. A little thin bodied and flaccid, though thankfully not sweet or artificial. Can't say it's something i'd get again, but it was alright."
""
""
"Highly clear reddish brown, small off white head. Smell is of roasted malt and caramel. Taste follows the nose, with a definite nutty, roasted up front malt profile. Caramel sweetness rounds it off on the end. The mouthfeel, however, is not so good. Very thin and watery, very low carbonation. The flavor was fine but the mouthfeel kind of ruined what could have been a great beer."
"Overall- A good brown ale and a good fall seasonal beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I don't think I'll ever really love a hazelnut beer. This one, though, is decent. It's mild and simplistic, but also easy to drink and not annoyingly artificial. I think this one is just right being only 2 beers in a fall 12 pack."
""
""
"O - not very impressed with this beer. Appearance and mouthfeel are the best aspects of this beer. However, the taste is not at all what I would expect of a beer. If you are a fan of hazelnut creamed coffee, you might enjoy this beer as a dessert after your meal. However, I do not enjoy coffee very much myself, which might be why I gave this a low rating."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Surprisingly good, I thought this was nearly top notch and an improvement from a standard Brown Ale. Not artificial tasting, not cloying, flavors of hazelnuts and chocolate meld very nicely with the toasted malty nuttiness of a Brown Ale."
""
""
""
"O: Overall, I couldn't really taste much hazelnut too it, thought I could smell it, it was still a pretty good beer though, great for when fall comes calling. I'd recommend this."

"It's ok for a fall seasonal, but I'm not super impressed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A tasty brew. Why, it's like a Hazelnut Nectar with the nigh unmistakable SA house yeast character."
"Offered as part of the autumn twelve pack, it features a great smell with abundant roasted malt, maple, nut, and toffee notes, and the taste is much of the same, but not quite as strong. It's fairly sweet but doesn't get too far away from itself with some bitterness coming in there to even things out. Mouthfeel is good with medium thickness, moderate carbonation, and just a little stickiness in there. It's not as intricate or tasty as it could have been, but it's a solid addition to the mix pack. The smell is fantastic, and it makes everything else worthwhile."
""
"Atmosphere is pretty strong. Dark hue, foamy head, and some persistent albeit light lacing. Nose is a great combination of coffee and dark chocolate.... truly hypnotic. Peaty and malty with some unsweetened dark chocolate notes. Ultimately, a little shallow, but still well done. Overall, this is a pretty good quaff."
""
""
"One complaint is the feel. With the rich creamy tones in scent and taste I have an expectation of a similar feel but instead get a loose carbonated tone. Very interesting experience from AS, but taste rules out here."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not a huge SA fan, bought the mixed twelve pack on a whim. This was the highlight of the pack. The nuttiness was just right and blended with the other flavors perfectly. The octoberfest was ok, as was the ipa, but this one was just right. Would buy a sixer of this for sure. Solid brew."
"Thinking as I finish this, has anyone tried eating it with chocolate bars or chocolate cream pie? Just an idea, I have not because I thought of it too late."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very smooth and tasty beer. Easy to drink and has enough flavor to drink several at once. Definitely enjoyed this one."
"Broadly similar to Rogue's Hazelnut Brown Nectar. If this were offered in six-packs, I'd probably pick it up every once in a while, and it would be a solid value alternative to the aforementioned Rogue offering. As it stands, it's a worthy addition to the Fall seasonal pack."
""
""
""
""
""
"2nd up off of the fall mixer from Sam adams. Not a big brown fan but I enjoyed this. Must be the hazlenuts of which I ironically hate in any liquid form. Very subtle smell and flavor of the hazlenuts balanced well with the roasted malts. Tasted a lil chocolate as well though the coffee tastes as advertised eludes me. Hits all the right notes and I look forward to it getting a little more cooler so I can enjoy a few note of these."

"This beer is really sweet. And even though it hits the spot right now, I don't think I would want to drink more than one or two of these. With that being said, I really enjoyed it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is beautiful. It pours a clear deep mahogany with a one finger tan head. A thick retention ring remains with a little bit of lacing. Smell is nuts and biscuit. Taste is very malt forward with some toffee and caramel. Finish is slightly coffee, but is overpowered by the malt. Mouthfeel is okay, but unremarkable. Pretty nice beer. Not great, but not bad either."

"O: I like this beer and it works well in the cooling months--I just wish the flavors were more natural and came together a bit better"
""
"Overall a good brew. Would have to be in a mood to drink it, and probably wouldn't get it in a 6 pack, but good none the less."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - a little nutty for my taste, but not bad"
""
"Hazel Brown pours out a reddish-brown with a large head that quickly drops. The aroma is very nice, there's a great roasted hazelnut aroma over some malts and a bit of vanilla. The taste offers out a very nice, realistic hazelnut flavor without becoming overly sweet. The mouthfeel is lighter and smooth, and the drinkability is very good. Overall, it's a nice tasting hazelnut beer, but seems to be missing something compared to my favourite, Rogue's Hazelnut Brown Nectar. Still very good though."
"The mouth is decent, but I would like a bit more substance. Easy drinking beer that fits in nicely with my fall and winter beer rotation. Reminds me a bit of the late Berghoff Winter hazelnut beer, damn I wish they still made that one."
""
"Mouthfeel is thin and watery, with sweet cocoa notes trailing off slightly bitter, a light to medium body and light to average carbonation; what this lacks in mouthfeel it makes up for with its flavor. Overall I thought this was very good, real nutty and easy to drink. A fine example of this style that was very smooth and hopefully not a onetime brew."
"Overall it's a nice brown ale, I would definitely try this again."
""
""
"The beer pours a clear, dark brown color with an off-white head. The aroma is full of toffee and some hazelnut character. The flavor is very similar. There is a good amount of sweet chocolate and toasted nuts, as well as a hint of toffee and caramel. The beer is very sweet and has no real hop character to it. I also get a light hint of mint, but that may be my imagination. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Very nice beer, besides the added spices there's really nothing to unique about this brew. It's just, IMO, exactly what a brown ale should be like. Most breweries make their brown ales too watered down (including sam smith) for my taste and I always feel like if they would just add more malts, it would be the brown ale i'm looking for. Sam adams did just that, creating a cream, nutty malt bomb. A great example of the style."
""
""
"Overall: Almost drank more like a porter or stout, not really my type of beer, did not care for this one at all. Although I can see how other would enjoy this brew."
""
""
"Easy drinking little Brown Ale. The hazelnut is a very nice addition."
"O - I'm really digging the hazelnut flavor and smell in this brew. The beer is all around inviting to me and pretty drinkable with almost anything. I'd definitely pick up a 6-pack of this brew in the future. Cheers!"
"o: This one's a success for SA imo. It's flavorful enough to satisfy while still keeping it light enough to session."
"a solid beer, good nutty flavors without going overboard. hard to tell if the flavors come from authentic ingredients or not, but still... kudos to sam adams."
""
"O: The taste is fantastic. A bit like a Marzen with Frangelico added. Other qualities are lacking."
"Overall a very tasty brew similar to the chocolate ale and coffee ale. I was impressed."
""
"Nutty, malty and quite tasty brown ale. Lots of carramel on the tongue and well into the finish. Malts carry the weight. Nice rounded mouthfeel. Enjoyable ABA"
""
""
"Nutella in a bottle it isn't but it's still pretty good. My hazelnut brown beer vote still goes Rogue though."
"Taste is a bit of a shock at first, being sweeter and simpler than the dry, almost spice induced aroma might portend. In the end I get used to it as the hazelnut returns to offer a lingering finish after a somewhat simple start. Overall this beer offers an odd mouthfeel initially though this does balance with some warming in the glass. A good sipper but a bit one dimensional in the long run."
"Nice aroma of hazlenut and caramel. Pours a nice ruddy brown with large beige head. Taste is crisp , again notes of hazelnut and caramel slight touch of toffee and a hint of hops. Pleasant on the tounge."
""
"Overall- Others disagree with me, but I'm just not crazy about it. Not bad, just not something I would buy again to treat myself to."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I'll skip this entry in the snack box in the future."
""
""
""
""
"O- really good brown offering from Sam Adams"
""
""
"Overall: a surprisingly good hazelnut brown. Bettered by the world-class Rogue Hazelnut but closer in overall quality than I expected, even from this highly reliable brewery. Improves with warming."
"Taste-Spicy malt, toasted hazelnut,caramel. Hazelnut not overdone. Nice flavor, but a bit thin-bodied. Flavor fades upon warming a bit."
""
""
"Taste is of hazelnut, caramel, a touch of sweetness with spice and hops in the background, not bad at all. Moutfeel is a bit creamy, with good drinkability. Overall it is pretty good. I would definitely have this again."
""
"Overall quite good, the nuttiness might be a bit over the top but I thought this was a sweet and malty treat."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - One of the better brown ales that I've seen that is relatively light but has robust flavor. I'd like this as a 6'er."
""
""
""
"O - I am not a huge ran of big nutty beers and this is not an exception. The sweet vanilla is a big change of taste that occurs to quickly. Good things inside, just not as balanced as I would like to see."
"O:  Well Sam delivered the Hazel Brown for sure. Straight forward from what you would expect by the label. Loads of thick hazelnut aroma and flavor. Accompanied by caramel and toffee malts create a rich brew to enjoy with dessert. Not something I would regularly drink and probably won't purchase again. I do have to give it props for delivering what it advertises. If you like hazelnut you will love this. Cheers! "
""
""
"Would Make"
""
"Pours medium dark brown, some red tints, with full inch of white foam. Very strong hazelnut smell, hints of cocoa/coffee. Taste is a delicious blend of caramel, toffee, hazelnuts, even balanced, light bodied. Excellent take on the style. Really good."
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a dark, thin, auburn-brown coloring with no head. Aromas of hazelnut and roast, with subtle coffee and chocolate highlights. Flavors are very roasty and richly sweet, with nutty and mocha highlights. Very smooth and sweet. Light bodied, bordering on thin, with the cabronation giving an effervescent feel. Roasted aftertaste with a slightly lingering sweet, crisp finish."
""
""
""
"Samuel Adams Hazel Brown is a very clear, deep reddish brown ale topped with a dense, off white foam that has outstanding retention and lacing. Caramel, toffee and hazelnut are in the first sniff. There is some roastiness and maybe some grass. Soft, dry and medium bodied, it leaves the tongue a little chalky. This is bursting with hazelnut. It's not huge or overpowering. The flavors all melt very well. There's just enough bitterness to avoid seeming sweet at all. This is so smooth and easy. It could be a session ale any time."
""
""
"overall my clear favorite out of this year's fall mixer. very solid beer; probably won't blow you away but it's well worth a try."
""
"Served from bottle into a shaker. Poured brown with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, nutty, milk chocolate, and slight roasted malt. The flavor was of sweet malt, milk chocolate, nutty, and earth. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. Got this one in a variety pack for fall and was kind of interested in trying it based on some of the reviews I saw on here. However, this one really didn’t fit in with my palate overly great. It was decent, so don’t get me wrong there. However, there really wasn’t a huge amount of stuff going on in this one to keep me interested. I did like the notes of milk chocolate, but that was about it. Worth trying for the curious."
"Overall: A pretty nice version of a brown ale. The hazelnuts add a nice kick and the sweetness is kept well in balance."
""
"Dark chestnut brown with a dense ivory cap that settles to a 1-inch cap. Nice aromas of toasted hazelnuts, caramel, and a touch of brown sugar. Quite similar to the nose, nice English-style Brown Ale base with notes of brown sugar, toffee, and malt with more rich hazelnut. Very nicely balanced and drinkable. Mouthfeel is smooth and fairly crisp, with a medium body and ample carbonation. Overall a very nice addition to the Fall lineup, but I do sorta miss last years Rauchbier."
""
""
""
""
"This is a decent attempt at a hazelnut brown ale, but I think it's a bit too strong on that nutty flavor. It's a big mouthful of hazelnut that's out of balance with the rest of the beer. I found it hard to finish, as much I wanted to enjoy it. The aroma is nice - like a cup of hazelnut coffee. A decent try, no harm in trying it in the seasonal pack, but I'll keep turning to Rogue for my hazelnut fix."
""
" Overall: Great beer, this is one of those beers that you get a lot for your money. It isn't strong or an imperial that ok...what matters is, is that it is quality. Rare you a product this good and this easy to find especially for the price. Salud!"
"Pours a clear reddish brown with a thin light tan head. Smell is mostly hazelnut, and maybe a little chocolate. Taste is initially very sweet, with some strong hazelnut flavor after that. Next is some toffee, and then some light espresso. The finish is slightly nutty and earthy. Mouthfeel is average. Overall a very interesting beer, I hope they keep it and have it again next year."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear, dark brown color. 5/4 inch head of an off-tan color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of strong sweet malt, nuts, hint of roasted malt, hint of hop, and slight pale malt. Fits the style of an American Brown Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of strong sweet malt, slight wheat, hint of hops, nuts, and a hint of pale malt. Overall, good appearance, feel, and aroma. The biggest flaw is that the wheat metallic flavor is slightly off-putting."
""
""
""
"Overall - Very easy drinking and quite tasty. A pleasant drinking brown ale."
"Standard brown ale with a medium body and a touch too much carbonation. the hazelnuts add complexity and a touch of smoothness. There are some late breaking hops to reckon with as well. More complex than most browns for a nice change of pace. Worth a try."
""
""
""
"This offering is a bit thin, but there certainly has a tasty side to it in spite of the thinness."
""
"Bought as part of a mixed 12 pack. Brown ales can be found all over, but the hazelnut in this one gives it a nice touch. Smells a bit nutty with a roasted aroma. Taste is medium bodied, some nice roastiness and the hazelnuts really come through, along with a touch of caramel and toffee. Nice balance and finish, a nice change of pace for a usually boring style."
""
""
""
"O) Not quite in Hazelnut Nectar's neighborhood, but really pretty tasty stuff. I could see myself buying a sixer of this. Glad to recommend..."
""
""
""
"Pours a dark brown with a reddish tint, sporting a solid filmy off white head. The aroma is strong with butter, toffee and milk chocolate, lots of caramel as well. Taste is spicy and slightly bitter, earthy hops and more butter and toffee, some chocolate in the background. It is medium bodied with moderate carbonation and a nice dry finish. This is a nice beer from samuel adams, i'd drink it again."
""
""
""
""
""
"not a bad beer, but just seems so fake it's hard to get past it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I've found that many nut-based browns end up tasting like a paper bag after a pretty short time, so making this seasonal-only bypasses that problem."
""
"O – Even though it didn’t have as much hazelnut as I was expecting after the aroma, this is still a really good brown ale. It smells fantastic and is very tasty and drinkable. I’m glad Sam Adams added this one to the fall lineup."
""
"O-great tasting beer, one of the better beers I have had from Sam Adams. Look forward to having this beer again"
""
""
""
"Pours a nice dark brown with a good sized and very persistent head. Smell is mostly grassy hops. Maybe a touch of hazel nuts if you know to look for them. Pleasant caramel and toffee brown ale taste. Hazel nuts are again very much in the background but do add a pleasant touch of complexity and a little roundness to the taste that is noticeable in the late middle to finish. Pretty well carbonated and medium bodied. Pretty drinkable and overall a good brown ale with a minor twist."
"http://www.facebook.com/KAJIIsBeerReviews"
"O: hazelnut is a good addition to a brown ale but it would seem that to really get the hazelnut flavor more would have to be used"
""
""
"Overall not a bad brew though I wouldn't six it."
"Single finger head on deep amber body. Nuts, caramel, chocolate malts and breads. Flavors of chocolate, hazelnut, chestnut, caramel and bready malts. Medium body and high carbonation. Not a bad beer really. Drinkable but a little too sweet. Better than I was expecting from Sam adams for one of their side bar beers."

"This beer has a nice reddish brown body with a small tan head that disappears quickly. The smell is nice aroma of nuttiness and as it warms up the chocolate aroma comes through. The taste has a nice nutty sweetness to it with some malt goodness and a hint of chocolate. The mouth feel is good and overall a good brown ale."
""
"Had this again. Was cloyingly sweet. Very artificial tasting. Did not enjoy."
""

""
""
""
""

"A descent brown ale. An actual brown colored beer would help though."
"Overall this is a great beer but def has the capacity to become too sweet I believe especially after it gets closer to room temperature or if you have too many."
""
""
""
"O- A solid nutty brown ale that is very approachable."
""
"O: I was expecting this to be a standard nutty brown ale (which I love) with just a hint of sweet hazelnut character. What I got was an overpowering, syrupy brew which masked any other positive flavor profiles that may be lurking underneath."
""
"o - drinkable i guess but not enjoyable. i actually dumped mine about 2/3 of the way through it. the only beer i can compare this to is frangelic mountain brown and really, there's just no comparison. if you like diacetyl, this is your beer."
""
"I wish this beer was a little less sweet and more balanced, but it's not a bad beer."
""
""
"O - Very enjoyable, possibly my favorite in the variety pack. If it were sold on it's own I think I'd buy it."
""
"O - Overall an unwelcome addition to the variety pack. I got to hand it to Sam Adams for always trying new ideas but it also seems like their variety packs are always saddled down with a horrible style or two. I have to admit I don't like hazelnut at all and on second tasting I don't think it is too terrible considering the strength of that flavor but wished they could have included something else a little different, the smoked beer etc."
"O) A delicious American brown ale. I'd definitely have another."
""
"M: Medium bodied, semi-sweet finish, nuttiness lingers on and carbonation is good."
""
""
""
""
"O: A surprisingly good beer overall. I wasn't expecting much, but quite enjoyed it. The hazelnut is subtle, which is nice. I just wish it were a bit creamier and with the same depth of flavor as aroma."
""
""
"It pours a gentle dark brown and leaves the same color body. A half inch white foamy head appears and lasts for a good minute. Some foamy rings are left in the lace. The smell has nuts, malts, and light toffee. The taste has the previously mentioned flavors with some light chocolate. The mouthfeel is about a medium with nothing harsh on the tongue. It is very drinkable. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that I won't have a problem drinking the rest. It's a taste beer!."
"Overall, impressive brew from Sam, good balance and flavor and smell - would love to have this on tap"
""
"O - Again, pleasantly surprised. One of the better browns I've had. Some people say the Brewer Patriot has gotten cocky with their seasonals, and if that's true, this may have brought them back from there. And if you love hazelnut, dive right in."
""
""
""
"This is a good beer that could be a VERY good beer. If every sip tasted like the first one, this would be a standout Sam Adams beer. Instead, it's just a slightly above average offering. A great addition to the Harvest Collection!"
""
""
"Highly drinkable. I sometimes get annoyed with BBC's constant production of seasonal, seemingly half-assed beer releases but this is pretty good."
""
""
""
"Not great but, I would drink this again if jonesing for some hazelnut"
""
""

"O/D-I love all things Hazelnut. Still waiting for a beer that I can describe as ""Nutella Beer"". This was kinda close. I enjoyed this more than Sam Smith's Nut Brown Ale (which I had very recently). This was also kinda like a milder version of Founders' Frangelic Mountain Brown. Anyway, I liked this; one of Sam Adams' better recent variety brews."
""
""
"Overall: A great addition to the Sam Adams lineup. A faithful interpretation of the brown ale with a great hazelnut flavor. A perfect fall seasonal. Here's hoping that they keep this one around."
""
""
""
"Overall impression: A drinkable novelty. I wouldn't want it all the time but perfect for the time of year and it lives up to the label. Worth a try."
""
"O - Not a bad beer, I really wouldn't recommend it or recommend against it. Newer beer drinkers may have a better appreciation for this."
"Pretty decent beer, one of the better ones I've had from the seasonal packs. Goes down easy, and has a nice mix of flavors. Really nice beer for fall."
""
""
""
"O - solid brown, recommended."
""
""
"Glad I got to try this and I’m excited there’s still one more in my fridge. Would definitely buy more of this given the chance. Hazel Brown: recommended!"
"Pours a ruby-brown color with a frothy beige head, good retention and lacing. Aromas are nutty, malty, caramel, toffee, earthy, spicy. Tastes - whoa hazelnut! Nutty, toasted hazelnut, toffee, caramel, spicy. At first the hazelnut is over the top but the other malty tones help to tame it down and the flavors actually all meld pretty well. Mouth-feel is thin-to-medium bodied, creamy. Overall, for the style this needs to be more sessionable. The hazelnut is definitely showcased here, but for me it's a one & done - too much hazelnut."
"Orlando, Fl - Publix Supermarket - 12 oz bottle - part of the Fall Variety pack. Pours a dark chestnut with an initial bubbly off-white head that fades quickly. Aroma is heavy with rich toffee and vanilla accents. Flavor has some nice solid hazelnut notes, a hint of vanilla and caramel. Mouthfeel is medium. Texture is watery. Light medium carbonation. A nice brown. The aroma is the best part of it. Balanced."
""
"Bottle: Poured a clear brown color ale with a rather large off-white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma consists of light caramel malt with light traces of hazelnut. Taste is a pretty easy to drink mix of light caramel malt with some notes of hazelnut and light residual sugar. Body is a bit light with good carbonation. Easy drinking with limited complexity."
"Really liked this beer. Three words to sum it up would be nutty, espresso and smooth."
""
"Ok for a bottle or two but really wouldn't want to drink to much of this stuff, although it might be pretty good with the right food pairing."
""
"One of the better ales available in the current 12 pack. Check it out!"
""
""
""
"Pours a chestnut brown, with thin cap of khaki tinted head. Scent if sweet toffee, toasted nuts and hazlenut extract. Taste mellows out the expected sweetness and artificial/extract notes found in scent. Nutty toffee and hazlenut play very nice together... really enjoying this as I hope for cooler and dryer weather. Medium bodied, bubbly, a little more heft would do some good. All in all, impressed with the taste of this beer."
""
""
""
""
"When I had the first beer that was in the mix pack I thought it was a bit too sweet and the hazelnut extract came off a little cheap but now with this second beer I'm appreciating the beer more. The sweetness of the hazelnut and rich roasted malts blend in really well together and the Noble hops really come through at the end with the spicy bitterness. I'll definitely be glad to have it again in another mix pack."
"O: this is a pretty good beer that I won't have a problem drinking the rest."
""
""
"Poured into a Samuel Adams perfect pint glass. Pours clear toffee brown with a three-finger length eggshell colored head. The head retreats at a moderate pace. Some lacing is left on the side of the glass and a cap of head is left atop the beer. I can pick up aromas of caramel malt and hazelnut. It is not a strong aroma. The flavors of hazelnut and caramel malt hit the mouth right at the start. It's mildly sweet and very nutty. The nutty character from the hazelnut remains in the aftertaste. I also pick up some hops on the back end. The body is light with moderate carbonation. The drinkability is high. This is a very good beer."
""
"Overall Drinkability: This is an ok beer with hit-or-miss qualities."

"For some reason is it relatively flat in the glass. I spilled a little from my glass and I wont consider it alcohol abuse - I would prefer to steer clear of this in the future."
"A pretty average beer for the style. There is nothing here that leaves a lasting impression, but I'm glad I tried it."
""
""
""
""
"Overall average, not a favorite."
""
""
""
"Overall - A very solid beer that I would drink again. It has an interesting taste that makes it worth picking up to try at least once.."
"Overall its not a bad beer by any stretch, just could use some more character. Fits well in the mix pack but I wouldnt seek this out."
""
""
"O: very solid brown ale overall one of the best offerings from Sam Adams that I have had."
"O- Very very tasty. Probably my favorite out of the Mix pack"
""
"A drinkable and enjoyable brown ale with just a hint of hazelnut, this is pretty good and enjoyable. Though its not groundbreaking, I can't think of another brown ale that is really leaps and bounds ahead of it. Certainly worth having."
""
"O - good fall beer."
""
""
""

""

"O: I've always had a problem with SA, but I'm starting to respect them more in recent times. This is definitely the best one I've ever had by them (followed by Norse Legend, which is also very solid) and I would love to see six packs or bombers of this, but that's probably not going to happen. The one gripe I have with SA is that I HATE buying their variety packs just to get two beers of a style I want to try. Fucking take out the Boston Lager and the other year round and keep it to the seasonal varieties!"
"So what goes with Hazel Brown? I recommend a dose of Bach's music."

"Taste is big on the roasted malt front, the hazelnut is still well represented yet not as big as it was on the nose, toffee, bit of a burnt malt bitterness in the aftertaste, body is thin but a fairly assertive carbonation distracts from it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: Finally a Samuel Adams beer I want to buy more of! Even through it's faults, this Brown Ale rings true to it's name and gives you huge hazelnut flavor. It'd probably even be sessionable under the right conditions. I went into drinking this with medium expectations but it flew right past those upon the first sip. If they started with a slightly higher O.G. then this might be a favorite. Forget everything you thought you knew about Nut Brown Ales."
""
"wow its nice to be back in the united states from a beer standpoint after a couple months of drinking pale lagers and boring yellow water, finallz ive got a nice creative dark brew here. this baby pours maple syrup color equal parts brown and auburn red in the light, a one inch white head rests on top. the smell is fantastic, nutty and sweet. notes of vanilla and almond and hazelnut are all there. flavor features the hazelnut in a really nice way. there are some brown sugar sweetness notes, but they are complementary not overbearing. the vanilla is also there in the finish, which has a lovely roast malt flavor. feel is decent, could stand a little more body i think, but the carbonation is good. this might be a little too sweet to drink a lot of, but its a very flavorful brew that is perfect for the chilly nights that are on the way."
"O - I found this to be lacking in depth and overly simple with the hazelnut flavor seeming very artificial and added-in, versus something that was a product of the brewing process. Not quite as deep or sweet as it needs to be, and the hazelnut winds up being a little astringent. I wouldnt seek this out again. Weakest beer in the 2012 SA Autumn craft pack by far."
""
""
""
"This beer pours as you would expect. Dark hazy brown with a slightly off white head and red around the edges. This beer is very earthy. There is a lot of nutty flavors and a slight spicyness from the hops. There is also a nice bit of chocolate and cocoa. Some coffee and toffee but a chocolate forward brown. This beer is appropriately sized and has a solid feel to it. Aftertaste is quite dry but still pleasant. A good brown."
""
"Hazel Brown is sold this year as part of the Harvest sampler pack. It is a good- tasting brown ale that will appeal most to those who like the taste of hazelnuts, but there is much about this beer to enjoy by everyone. The nutty flavor, pleasant finish, and good balance make it a good craft beer for most any occasion."
""
""
""
"This brew is dark brown, but allows a reddish light through. The head is a dark tan, but it quickly fades. The aroma is very nice...intense chocolate, nut, toasted brown bread, and a little spice. Lots of roasted malt aromas...not much of a pale malt smell. Hops are present, but not dominant. The mouthfeel is richer than expected...full in body. Not quite mouthfilling. Very nice brown ale."
"O: Not a lot of beers except for stouts and a good IPA make me say ""wow", but this beer does. Amazing flavor, the dark roasted nut flavor is very well blended with the coffee and caramel notes. I always save the newest beers in the mixed pack for last because they usually turn out to be the best. This one was no different and I couldnt ask for a better replacement of the ""Bonfire Rauchbier"" From 2011."
""
"O-hey for Sam Adams, this is quite an awesome beer. I'm pretty impressed with this one, and I think most people will be. It's got to be one of the better brown ales I've had."
""
"This is a decent brown ale. It has a really good malt character and a nutty, sweet flavor that is highly drinkable. If this came in a regular six pack I would probably buy it."
"An ok beer, pretty typical of Sam Adams. Might pair well with some beefy dishes, but on it's over, it's very average to me."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I love the Hazelnut Brown style but I only like this version. I like the flavors but not quite as good as the Rogue version."
""
"O: While it's not bad in any sense, this beer is extremely one-dimensional and really focuses on the hazelnut aspect while leaning on the malts for some sweetness and body. That said, it does fit the season well and is enjoyable in small quantities. It's certainly not a beer you sit down and have a sixer of with some friends, though (regardless of the fact that it comes with only 2 bottles at a time in the 12-pack)"
"I can get into those artificial hazelnut coffee drinks at times and this one initially impressed me with its ability to emulate them. But the novelty quickly grows tiresome, the flavor gets lets appealing as you continue to drink it, and in the end a 12oz bottle was more than enough."
""
""
""
""
""
"A decent brew, the hazelnut is not cloying but I don't think I would want more than one bottle of this. Not a huge hazelnut fan."
"12oz bottle purchased as part of this year's ""Harvest Collection"" 12 pack. Pours a crystal-clear dark copper to brown body with rather persistent khaki-colored head. Smells sweet and nutty, with caramel, toffee, roast, and a touch of butter. Sweet and roasty with caramel, coffee, dark chocolate, and nutty notes. Other than being the slightest bit astringent, it's pretty drinkable. Not too bad example of the style overall. A bit more robust and interesting than Samuel Adams Brown in my opinion."
""
"O- I really enjoyed this brown ale. The sweet hazelnuts are great in both aroma and taste, well balanced and leaves a great longer on the palate. Would make a great dessert beer, or paired with a nice pumpkin or pecan pie."
""
"Pours a deep auburn color with a nice, dense off-white head on top. Plenty of hazelnut in the aroma - sweet, warm, biscuity malt and a little maple syrup. Nutty caramel malt flavors, mild cocoa and coffee, and some earthiness in back. Very easy going and pleasant all around. Medium bodied and slightly creamy. This was a nice addition to the Harvest Collection. I imagine it would go well with some cool autumn air, though it's still the middle of summer."
"I fell in love with this beer the second I tasted it. Great fall beer, delicious and perfect for drinking on a cool fall night."
""
""
"Taste is slightly underwhelming. Good malt backbone, definite hazelnut flavor, maybe a slightly sweet toffee profile in there as well. Feel is somewhat light bodied, good carbonation. I'd rate this as an average brew, nothing spectacular, but it isn't absolutely horrible either."
""
""
""
"12 oz bottle from a variety pack. Pours light brown with a long lasting off-white head. Aroma is very nutty, malty with hints of hops. Body is light to medium, slightly crisp. Taste is mostly hazelnuts, toffee balanced by earthy hops. Finish is medium, hazelnutty. Good brew if you like hazelnuts."
""
""

"O: The nose was promising, but the taste and mouthfeel were on the poor side. I was hoping for something like Rogue Hazelnut Nectar, but I certainly didn't get that."
"O- Meh. I get the same feel from a lot of the beers Sam does for these sampler packs (see last Winter's). Not bad beer, but you kind of get the feel they're just throwing these out without any real heart in them."
"O: A tasty brown ale; near the end of my glass the hazelnut and sweet malty flavors combined to be a bit sweeter than I might have preferred, without a bitter flavor present to balance them. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the full bottle and was happy to try it as part of this fall's harvest 12-pack."
"Overall - Delicious, despite it's limited range. One can't help but to compare it to Rogue's Hazelnut Brown Nectar. One of the best, if not the best, Samuel Adams beers I've had."
"An excellent brown ale, nutty, smooth and just plain tasty. A bit on the sweet side but I like sweet too when the flavors back it up and this beer does seem to handle that readily."
"O - I really love Sam Adams beer. But I do often get dissapointed with some of the beer choices in the seasonal collections. Not this fall. The 2012 harvest collection trumps the 2011 collection hands down. This is a perfect addition to their fall lineup and I hope it stays for years to come."
""
"The new release from this year's (ridiculously early) Fall 12-pack. It pours a clear garnet topped by a finger of dirty beige foam. The nose comprises roasted hazelnuts, light maple syrup, very light roasted malts, and a kiss of earthy hops. The taste lowers the hazelnut presence a bit, allowing some residual sweetness from the maple syrup and roasted malt flavors to come through. In the very deep recesses of the background, a vague sense of rubbing alcohol barely makes itself perceptible. Odd, but thankfully it's nothing but a passing notion, which is then overcome by a lasting expression of nuts. The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a more-than-fluid feel. Things are just too thinnish, too almost-watery, for my tastes. Overall, a decent little brown ale, but one that just comes off as an experiment into how much hazelnut they can make come through. As things progress in the glass, I feel like I wanna drink less and less of this...: it just gets kinda tiresome after a while, is all."
