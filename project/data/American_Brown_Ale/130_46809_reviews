"Aroma is floral, lightly citrusy, with a deeply toasted malt backbone that is accented by hints of chocolate and a touch of roast. There's a bit of caramel sweetness. Flavor reveals more floral hop character throughout, with a deeply toasted, nutty malt backbone. The finish is resiny and fairly bitter. Notes of muted grapefruit counter light chocolate initially. There's a bit of an offputting perfumey character in the aftertaste. Not quite the brew I remember. Too bitter and perfumey flavor for my liking. The aftertaste of medicinal/harsh bittering hops kills it for me."

"The body holds medium with a nice crispness, a good bite but clean as well. It starts off with smoothness and gives it over to the bite without losing it. Some leafy dryness is felt from middle to end, but it holds a good median."

"Pouts a dark reddish-brown in color with a small off-white head. Some lacing was seen when sipped. The aroma is of strong roasted malts. The taste was..well very bitter with a harsh strong 'hoppy' aftertaste which lingered for way to long. Tried it again a few minutes later and wasn't any better at all. After two more sips, I had had enough as it was way to hoppy of a harsh bitter aftertaste for me and poured the rest out."

"Another brown/roasted/black treatment of an IPA. Enough all fucking ready - the brown ale/stout essences just don't mesh all that well with the saucy, zippy nature of a well-wrought hoppy pale ale. Or maybe this offering just approached this from the diametrically opposite angle."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a dark red with an off white head. Smells of piney hops with slight floral hint and very slight alcohol smell with dark grain. Tastes of piney hops with a slight maltiness. Beer is light/medium bodied and good carbonation, goes down smooth. Overall, a very good beer."

"Overall – A brew that I did not really enjoy all that much. The flavors and the nose never really melded to well with transitions that were somewhat abrupt and disjunct. I will likely not come back to this any time soon."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Candidate for a re-review. I wish I'd noticed the freshness date before plucking it off the shelf. As is, it's already a solid brew. I'd love to try it fresh."
""
"O - This is a very interesting brew, I havent had much in the way of IBA styled beers, but this would be a good example I'd take it. Complex with that toasted nut and piney floral hop flavors, but drinks easily. Excellent brew."

"O: I agree with other reviewers that there are too many clashing flavors here. Still, it's a decent beer."
""
""
"Overall I just do not like my darker beers with this much hop profile. While is is clean, crisp and relatively easy to drink, I just don't enjoy drinking it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a nice brew, especially for being as old as it is. I will need to pick up a fresher version!"
"O: Not a bad beer but it doesn't quite jive well in my opinion. I think the flavors are all there, I'd just add more malts and raise the ABV a bit."
""
""
"This is only just above average. The nitro tap helped out the drinkability, but the flavor isn't for me. The toasty notes were overpowering. I would prefer a more up front nutty, malty quality versus the toasted malts."
""
""
""
""
"Poured on nitro-tap and served in a tumbler pint, the beer has a great cascade of golden brown layers. The beer settles into a light amber-brown coloring with a dense, low profile, cream colored head. Aromas of roasty and nutty sweet characters with an overlay of resiny, bright hops. Interesting dynamic. Flavors are very eclectic, and you initially feel like they should clash, but they end up blending very well. Roasty, nutty, and toffee sweet backbone support a bitter and floral hops profile that defiantly pokes through the strongly sweet palate to be represented. This dichotomy gives an interesting and unique balance to the palate. Very tasty. Great frothy, thick cling along the glass as you go. The aftertaste leans more towards the sweet characteristics of nut and toffee, with a creamy, smooth, clean finish."
"Had on Tap at Old Chicago, Pretty good for the style, I like even though it is higher in alcohol it doesn't have that sickly sweet taste some of the higher alcohol brews have. Good blance between caramel malts and hops, I enjoyed this one. Would recommend it."
""
"O: This beer is very easy to drink given its light-bodied nature, especially when it’s on a nitro-tap."
""
""
""
""
""
"o. Its alright, but not sure how the lemon and nutty flavors contast. Its definitely a different spin on a nut brown ale. Not sure if would drink again."

"This was just OK. The aroma presented a nice mix of hops and malt but the taste relayed a bit much on the hops in my opinion, with a raw and pity finish that didn’t leave a favorable impression on me and really took me out of this at times. I probably wouldn’t pick this up again."
"Taste-Toasted malt, caramel, citrus hops, burnt toast finish. Overall, not a bad tasting little Brown."
""
""
""

""
""
"O- It's a decent beer, but too one note for me to be too interested in for a regular beer."
"I like the stuff they're making at Boulder Brewery; Happy to see this 6pk sell for under 7 bucks."
""
""
"Overall, a mixed bag for me here. I'm starting to really appreciate brown ales, but this one is too strong. The 6.88% ABV makes itself known. Not a good session beer, and the overload of hops makes me not want to drink this again. But having said all of that, this is a well-made beer."

"Overall impression: Seems to have a bit of an identity crisis. Tastes like an American Amber with elements of a sweet American Brown. Kind of a muddled mess. Avoid."
"O: Great beer, perfect cold weather beer for a hop head, a true india brown ale, reminds me of a black ipa but not as roasted. Awesome value, will look for this in the future, hopefully fresher for more hops!"

"Conclusion: Tasty and well done. I would call this a hoppy amber or even a ""black IPA", but not a brown ale. Whatever. It is tasty and if you love hops this would be right up your alley."

"re-reviewed on 4/2012 using a bottle dated 27 Dec 2010. Enjoyed this MUCH more than a bottle from the same batch sampled about 6 mos. ago. Aroma and appearance remain unchanged. Ratings reflect both tastings."
"Overall: this is a good mix of a brown ale and an IPA you get the bitterness and hop of an IPA and the sweet caramelly nut flavor of a brown ale. good beer, very drinkable."
"Overall impression: Nice and drinkable, good hop flavors - easy to drink, especially considering the ABV."
"This beer pours a nice dark brown color. It has a nice 2-finger super creamy looking head on it. The head has amazing retention, and it leaves behind a thick sheet of lace all down the glass. This is the most lace I have ever seen a beer leave behind, just awesome looking. It smells of some dark toasted malt, and a nice big hop presence. There are some aromas of chocolate, caramel, and nuts as well. The taste starts off with a nice bit of toasted malt in the background and a big spicy hop flavor in the forefront. There is a pretty big chocolate presence, as well as some mild caramel and nut flavors. The hops really shined through and added a quite a bit of bitterness. This had a medium body and nice carbonation. It goes down super easy, and it has an extremely creamy feel to it. There is some spiciness and bitterness from the hops. The feel is really nice overall. This has great drinkability. I could definitely drink my fair share of glasses of this a night. It has a really nice flavor, and it is extremely creamy. Although I haven't had the regular version of this beer, I really think the nitro benefited it. It is definitely very interesting as well. It really is in its own category, not quite a brown ale and not quite a black ale. overall, it is just a really great tasting creamy beer. If you see this try it out, especially if it's on nitro."
"O: Certainly better than many of the other Boulder beers, but by no means great."
"D - This is a very nice beer, a bit laid back, well balanced but not in your face, subtle hops flavor throughout the drink."
"O – Good drinkability. In a style by itself: not a black IPA, IPA, or Brown. Unique taste with a rare malt and hop combination that is definitely worth a try and a brew that I will be having another of and purchasing in the future 4"
"O - My bottle may have been a few months old, but this beer held up for being an Indian Brown Ale...the hops held their bitterness on the palate although they were minimal in the aroma...I'm glad they made this one past their 30th anniversary"
"Overall: A well done beer. I would expect more brown in the IPA, if you tried this blind I would expect you to think it was a normal IPA. Aroma might have faded over time but was still present which I was impressed at almost a year old."
"D- Another yummy beer that defies what beer should be and does an awfully good job"
"O - A solid beer. If I saw this on tap somewhere, I would certainly be interested in trying it. For the price and the ABV, it's a great buy. I would recommend this to someone looking for a different type of brown ale."
"This Black Ale was served on-tap and in goblet. It poured a dark brown color. It produced very little head and retention was poor. Lacing was poor as well. The aroma from this Black Ale comprised of caramel, some toasted malt and there are some piney hop notes as well. The beer is full bodied, you can tell that this is high in ABV...The taste is not very well balanced....there is a roasted malt base, with suggestions of caramel and a bit of piney hops that show through. Strong beer, finish's dry...This beer is ok...my first time trying something from Boulder Beer....Its a little off balance.../missing something."
"Overall Impression: I love the balance and flavor in this beer, as it takes you from caramel, malty, and bready flavors, to citrus, resin, and piney hop flavors in the finish. This one was aged a few months, so the hoppy flavors were a bit less than when it’s fresh. However, I’ve had this many times before and highly recommend this beer."
"O: Pretty sure this bottle was past it's prime (it was being stored room temp too), so it was so-so. I could sense how this would be a better product fresh though."
"This is a pleasant hopped-up brown ale. For the style (which is American Brown Ale, not Black Ale as listed here) I prefer DFH's Indian Brown but still a good ale which I would enjoy again."
"Drinkability - excellent brew from BB. Cheers to ya' if you can wait a few years with one or two of these."
"This was a nice, medium-bodied black IPA. I enjoyed it."
"Overall- I had a second one. It's pretty good. Would be really good with a cajun brat."
"I can't resist the comparison with Dogfish India Brown, and this stuff suffers. It has to be some oddball IPA. I wish there was a Wikipedia-style committee to occasionally consider style issues like this. Bottle date is Nov. 29, 2010."
"Appearance is a copper color with cloudiness. The smell has nuts, citrus fruit, bread, a pleasant aroma for sure. Upon sipping, the taste contains roasted malts, some hops, a small amount of sweetness. MF is medium with proper bitterness in the finish. A good black ale from these folks out of Colorado."
"From a bottle with a ""best by Aug 4,2011"" date. Poured light mahogany brown with perfect clarity. A brief white foamy head that quickly reduced to a wispy cap. Big sheets of sticky lacings on the glass. Sweet toasted malt with prominent nutty and floral hoppy notes. Oily smooth feel with pleasant carbonation. Sweet toasted malt and nut flavors through the beginning into the middle. Sweet raisin-like fruity flavors through the middle and a taosty, nutty flavor and floral hop bitterness into the finish. Very unusual. Started off like a brown ale, but with bock-like character in the middle."
"A different type of beer that I enjoyed. The hops and the malt are well balanced and has a nice hop aroma. A little unsure of the date of the beer so that may have affected the quality. The mouthfeel is a little less than I thought it should have been. A nice beer to pair with spicy sausages or hamburgers."
"I had no idea Boulder has been around for over 30 years. This beer seems like a pretty dismal choice for such a celebratory occasion."
"The only thing that saves it is that it's interesting. I personally did not enjoy it and probably won't purchase again, but I can see where people would like it."
"Pours a deep amber with traces of copper, off-white head, and rather fine appearance overall. Nose brings across some grapefruit and a toasty malt presence. On the palate the hops are quite assertive, as you may almost help yourself to thinking this is just an IPA. But then the chocolatey malt component speaks up, balances a bit, and you're left with a nice interplay between the two. On the finish, the hop bitterness takes victory over the malt though."
"Overall- I would get this again, for sure. I thought it was fantastic."
"Overall it was a decent offering I think it needed a little more though to push it over the edge. I have had much worse though it just seemed like it was a tad too big for itself"
"A pretty good beer, more of a really malt heavy IPA or well bittered red than a standard brown. Hop heads be warned, harsh aftertaste with multiple facets being revealed at once. Comparable to Oskar Blues G'Knight, less sticky and w/o the high ABV.."
"Snoogens!"
"This beer pours out as a light brownish colored ale. It had a decent head on it and gave a good lacing down the glass. The smell was very hopped up, not much else there really. The flavor was very hoppy too, mostly all hops much like a strong ipa. I wasn't really getting too much of the roasted malts. As I sit here I'm still getting piny citrus flavors. I liked the beer for sure. I'd say it worth trying."
"A cool labeled BBC brew, let's give it a whirl. Popping the top I get a foam shooting out the top what's up with that I don't know but, onward. This brew has a big black licorice and brown sugar scent with sweet malts. Pours into the perfect pint with a deep burgundy brown colour and a huge mostly small bubble head that laces as it recedes. On the taste this brew tastes like it just came out of the toaster and has a big hop bite, the virtual double whammy. Taste starts both with roasted malts and a bitterness but it quickly transitions to a sweet ale with chaulky biterness around the edges, then finishes with a bitterness in the aftertaste that might go into tomorrow. Mouthfeel is not silky smooth, but not over carbonated, and with everything going on, that silky smoothness is irrelevant. This is a very complex and flavorful selection, ideal to be consumed by the tired, poor and huddled masses. Good job BBC, keep up the good work."
"Nice roasted character that's expected from a Black Ale."
"The mouthfeel is a bit thick and well-carbonated, and the drinkability is very good. Another great hop-forward brew from Boulder, I'm finding they really have this whole hop business down pat."
"Drinkability is decent. Not necessarily my favorite Brown, but I enjoyed it."
"Drinkability - This is a pretty solid beer. Nothing outstanding, but easily drinkable. The beer is not as balanced as some others, but still a pretty good showing. I could handle a couple of these during one setting, no problem, but I might move on to other things if they were available."
"Overall an enjoyable beer with a nice complexity that keeps it tasty and interesting."
"O - Hard to place style wise, but I like the label on the beer as an India Brown better then the American Black Ale descriptor given. The base seems to be a pretty decent brown with a heavy dose of hops...so India Brown it is. I'm a fan of browns in general, and I would happily have this one again."
"Medium bodied with low carbonation. There's a slightly sticky lingering mouthfeel but it does not last long. Finishes a bit dry."
"Overall a great beer by Boulder. This is most likely the best beer I have had by them."
" The flavor of roasted malt is balanced well by some piney hops and fruit accents from the yeast with a mild caramel malt flavor. The taste has a gentle coffee quality with the roast and subtle citrus from the hops, the mild toasted grain is flavorful and adds a slight earthy woody flavor. The taste of the hops and bitterness level does not become overly aggressive yet lasts into the finish as the brown has a dry ending. This was a tasty brown ale, but not as hoppy as some in the style - it has a good malt flavor profile and it achieves good balance. I found it to be highly drinkable and I would not hesitate to pick it up again."
"D - enjoyable, very well-balanced, right level of bite for me and is gorgeous to look at"
"Drinkability: An easy-drinking dark IPA with a nice malt balance. Could easily session this one. Would like to try it on tap, or a cask version of this. Another winner from the Boulder Beer Co."
"Although I wasn't blown away by the taste or aroma, alone, overall this is a good beer. I can definitely see drinking this again if it was offered to me, or was on tap, but I wouldn't make a point to purchase a lot of it right now. Everything I've had from Boulder Beer Company has been solid, and this is nothing different."
"Overall a nice surprise. Something different and worth a try."
"Poured from the bottle a medium brown color with a decent head. Aromas of roasted nuts, caramel, sweet malt and a herbal hops. Medium bodied, with flavors of chocolate malt, light citrus, biscuit dough and toffee/caramel. Pretty solid anniversary release."
"I was a little let down by this one. If you pass it up, you won't really be missing out."
"The color seems a little light for an American Black Ale. I guess this style name has changed from Black IPA. A good tasting beer though. Lots of toffee, a very malt forward beer."
"The appearance is more of a black ale which is nice golden to light brown color. Smell is defiantly caramel and toffee combined with a slight note of hops to bring it to the india style. I was guessing as to what exactly it would taste lick, would it lean more to the india or brown style ale? The taste confirmed that with a nice malt and chocolate character. Goes smooth down with an amazing drinkability. All in all i really like this beer and it almost reminds me of New Belgium's 1554 just a little lighter."
"Light roasted malt presence, a bit of the sweet, and an overpowering bitter flavour, harsh bitter flavour, that drowned everything else out once I got into the session. Though there was nothing wrong with the general mouth feel, I had a hard time finishing the pint. Bitter for bitter's sake, me thinks, and it does not work for me. It's kind of strange..the bottle didn't hit me nearly as bad as this draught offering."
"Very inviting aroma, good tasting brew that is fairly complex, but a bit thin in the feel. Overall, a very good beer that I look forward to trying again."
"MF is pleasant, flavor lingers a bit without being sticky. It is actually a really drinkable beer. Were I in the mood for sessioning a hoppy beer, I could see this as being an option."
"The feel is pretty good. Sticky, dank, and nicely carbonated, this is about what I expect from an IPA or even hoppy brown ale. This is a great beer overall, and I am happy to have more!"
"d - Although this is listed as Black IPA, the label actually says it is a brown ale, which it smelled like to me. For a brown ale I actually thought it was pretty good and I enjoyed the malty smell. Also thought the mouthfeel was pretty good. The 2 Boulder beers I received were two of the better BOTMC beers I got; would have again."
"I got this as part of a BOTMC, poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a SA perfect pint glass. The beer pours a red/amber with a 2 finger white head, light lacing. The aroma is floral hops and sweet malt. Lots of sweet malt upfront, earthy notes followed by a lingering floral bitterness. The beer is medium bodied, average carbonation. I rated this as a brown ale, IMHO this is not a cascadian ale."
"Served from tap into a sampler tumbler. Poured red-orange with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt and bitter hops. The flavor was of sweet malt, earthy notes, and slight bitter hops. It had a medium feel on the palate with low-mild carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew in flavor and aroma. The earthy note was a nice touch. This is a must try, but it is not your typical Black IPA by ANY means..."
"d- great with my mojo infused bbq pork sandwich...took a bottle home"
"Rockies Brewing Company--Boulder Beer Company flashback india-style brown ale--Looking Glass Series 9th Release--2010 12 oz. Bottle. 6.80% ABV. 60 IBU's. (4.0 / 5.0) IBA--Cascadian Dark Ale. Dense foamy lacy lasting light tan head. Clear dark amber red color. Hint of cocoa floral hop front. Creamy cloying crusty soft sweet doughy biscuit brown ale chocolate note mild caramel fruit body. Clean balanced smooth subtle hop spice end. Refreshing Rocky Mountain Malt over Hop IBA. Sampled 12/21/2010. Malt of the Earth Beer of the Month Club Selection received 12/21/2010."
"A clean, amber ale with a massive head of foam. Nose is a swell of floral hops, with a little candy sugar or caramel. Flavor is bold -- a curious but inviting mix of sharpness and sweetness. The finish is an impressive burnt chocolate. A delicious beer, and one I'll be having again!"
"Overall impression: Seems like American Brown Ale would be the better style designation (and I'd certainly have rated it higher as such)."
"And the answer is Boulder Beer Co.'s Flashback india-style brown ale. I can see this now. ABV is 6.8%, bit much for how I want to session this beer."
"The body is lighter than I expected, doesn't have much thickness to it. It is far from watery, just a little thin IMO. The carbonation is crisp and clean. The complexity is pretty good; but what makes this beer more than a brown ale, and certainly very drinkable, is the hoppy finish."
"The beer pours a rich amber color with a slightly off color head. The smell is of chocolate and biscuits. The taste is sweet, taste is hints of chocolate and bicuit malt. There is a balanced hop character to back up the malt character. I was a little worried when I smelt this one, I was thinking it might be Sam Adams Imperial boozy series, but it isnt. Ver well balanced here. The mouthfeel is medium, with a proper light medium carbonation."
"D: I like it and could easily drink multiple bottles."
"Pours a clear reddish amber with a wispy white head and minimal lacing. Sorry, this is not a black IPA, rather I feel it is a hoppy red. Smell is interesting mix of hops and malt with some faint woodyness. Taste is up front malt balanced by some fruity hops combined with an underlying wood quality that is hard to pinpoint. Mouthfeel is clean and bright with a good bitter/sweet interplay, neither of which dominates. Overall, very enjoyable and left wanting more."
"This would be a good beer to have before a meal. The bitterness serves as an aperitif would, while the malt lends to its substance. I'm not sure how I feel about this beer. It is definitely interesting, the brewery calls it an India Brown Ale, somewhat similar to the new India Black Ale style, but where the Black ale succeeds in balance, the Brown Ale, to me gets a bit lost in it's own ambition. What do I know, try it for yourself."
"This black IPA from Boulder Brewing is quite interesting. It pours a medium brown color with a semi-strong smell of hops. It drinks rather smooth and has a semi-strong flavor with slightly nutty hint. The taste of hops is also very evident. A really nice find!"
"Creamy mouthfeel, great drinkability. Nice beer."
"Nice brew. I favor the darker IPA's with some balance over the ultra bitter ones and this is better than many even if I think it has the potential to be improved"
"MF/D- Light body with good carbonation. Not a bad beer at all. Crispness and the body make it pretty drinkable."
"Drinkability is good. Pretty nice beer, just doesn't seem to fit well into the style."
"This was a very tasty beer, the flavor was strong and well balance and was very easy to drink."
"D- Yes! I do enjoy this beer. Picked up a 6 pack, and I am glad I did. Normally an IPA or pale ale is too bitter to drink much of, but considering this is 6.8% abv, the above average usage of malts tones the bitterness down and makes it a more balanced, but still hefty beer. I could probably drink 2 of these before getting a bit overwhelmed. With that said, after 2 of these I would feel nice and loose and would probably stop counting."
"D - This is a very good example of a beer that really shines on nitro, even though the aroma suffers a bit. However, the malt really cuts through due to the softer carbonation, and works nicely with the hop profile here. I enjoyed this quite a bit."
"Drinkability - I like this one! Enough complexity and good taste, yet a little more bitter than I'd like for keeping a 6-pack or two in the fridge."
"Drinkability: A tasty beer and one I've quite enjoyed sipping. I'll be putting this one on my shopping list and expect to have it again and again."
"D. While it wasn't quite what I expected, this was still an enjoyable beer. I could easily have 2 or 3 in an evening."
"Served cool in a pint glass this one shows a clear mahogany color with a solid off-white head and just a couple meager streaks of lacing. The aroma brings malty maple with a sweet grassy hop. Not bad. The flavor is sweet maple brown sugar and grassy malt much like the aroma with lively but small carbonation. There's a touch of skunky swamp hops to make it interesting. Medium body and quite drinkable. It becomes a little less grassy as you go but ultimately it's a nice blend of hops and brown sugar malt."
"D: Very very good. I am a fan of IPAs that aren't just all about the hops and offer a little something different. Would definitely recommend it."
"D- Overall, I enjoyed this beer. I'm a big fan of the India Browns and this is a welcome new year round addition on the shelves."
"An India brown ale? Certainly defies a style pigeon hole. Listed as an AIPA here, I might venture a ""super ESB?"" Regardless, a well-executed marriage of malt and hops. Pour was a cola brown. Hops lead the way with a clean, cutting edge. Malt lends a note of slightly sweet caramel and unrefined sugar. ETOH pops a bit of pepper toward the finish."
"Not very ""Brown""-looking for an India Brown Ale, though the flavors do get there. But don't drink it for the 65 IBUs, they are buried under sugar."
"D. Drinkability is ok. Question the age of this one. Not great but not bad."
"Here's my reasoning- the only other india brown I've had was dogfish head's and that one was pretty good. Many of their beers are above average and I did enjoy theirs a little better, henceforth I would assume this one is closer to average for the style. Not a bad brew. If anyone from the company reads this I will say that right now this is my favorite brewery. Cold hop and Hazed are fantastic and super sessionable and if this is their worst offering, then that ain't a bad thing."
"The beer pours an orange-amber color with a large, off-white head. The aroma is toffee with quite a bit of grassy hops. The flavor is brown malt, toffee and grassy hops. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Finishing more than two would be a struggle."
"Poured chestnut brown into a pint glass, with expectedly little carbonation, a thin offwhite head, and spotty lacing. Smelled of toffee, caramel, malt, oak, and a big earthiness. The latter dominated all other aspects of the flavor; almost to a point where the beer tasted leathery. Certainly seemed as if it would benefit from aging. However it did possess a dry hoppy aftertaste. Didn't feel as thick as the appearance either; a little too much on the thin side. I struggled to finish my one pint."
"A Mellow Mushroom rotating tap."
"M/D: feels thick an harsh with a dry bite. Not the most drinkable brown ale mainly due to the taste."
"Beer is medium bodied, has some chewy bitterness to it. Interesting. This beer is called a ""hoppy American Brown Ale"" on the label. There is an odd dryness in the mid to late palate of this beer. No aftertaste, overall its good for a hoppy brown ale."
"An American IPA that rivals those produced by Berkshire Brewing Co., my standard of the style. Mahogany red all the way to the edges, with a thin tan head that seemed to hang around for a decent period but then vanished in a blink. How did they do that?Plenty of pears in the aroma and some light grapefruit from the hops; some cocoa as well and even a little... hemp? Really? More hemp in the taste, but it's quickly muscled aside by the malty pears and peaches, leaving behind a mild hoppy wake that has traces of cream and pepper. More complex that other AIPAs, it's worthing having several."
"This was beer review #900."
"D - A very nice Indian Brown Ale that I may have again but out of the few that I had Dogfish heads version is better. Beer was decent."
"D: A nice mouthfeel and taste combination made for a nice drinking IPA. As the beer warmed, the warming alcohol made itself present, further adding to a nice, balanced IPA that made the beer nice going down."
"D: Although this beer has a lot of flavor, I would have no trouble letting one turn into two or three. All around a real treat."
"Pours a clear, light amber color. 2/3 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of strong sweet malt, strong floral hops, slight dough, yeast, hint of earthy malt, hint of wood, and a hint of dark citrus. Fits the style of an American Brown Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. There is also a noticeable dryness and bitterness. Tastes of strong floral hops, sweet malt, yeast, hint of roasted malt, and slight dark citrus. Overall, a strong body, good aroma, and good blend."
"Drinkability was good. Nice balance with a lean towards the IPA side. No signs of ABV."
"So many beers, so little time..."
"D= Quite nice for most any red meats or even with a semi-sweet or dark chocolate dessert."
"The aforementioned lingering bitterness really hurts the drinkability of this beer, and the monochromatic hops don't lend it too much complexity. To be fair to the beer, the last batch I had (about a year ago when it truly was the 30th anniversary special) was, as I remember, a much more complexly hopped brown ale, but based on this new six pack I've just finished, it's rather mediocre."
"The name has changed on this one to Flashback India-style Brown Ale, since it's no longer a one-off. Pours a clear brown tinted orange with creamy khaki colored head. Smell: hops are piney with a little lemon peel, brown sugar, spice cake, and just a tiny bit of green apple. Taste: pine with a nice splash of heavily sugared grapefruit, a little leafy as well. Underneath, caramel and a little date bread. Finishes bitter, sweet, drying, and a little appley. Pretty good, but there are other IBA/Brown IPA/whatevers I'd choose first."
"Drinkability: A pretty decent hoppy brown ale. Worth trying out."
"An ok beer, fairly bitter without too much hop flavor. The malt base was fairly bland as well. Not bad, but not great either."
"mobile review"
"Overall, I enjoyed this beer. This is my first Boulder beer, and it is a good attempt at the style. I will definitely try more Boulder beers."
"Not overly fantastic, but worth a try."
"On-tap at Flying Saucer served in a standard pint glass a crisp dark copper with a thin khaki head that slowly diminished and left slight lacing on the glass. Aroma was a nice blend of pine hops and burnt caramel. The taste was also pine hops and burnt caramel with a nice touch of citrus. The beer was medium bodied with its alcohol fairly well hidden. This is an enjoyable Indian Brown, one I'd love to have again."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a darker brown color, with a yellowy white head. The head thinned quickly, but the last bit lingered a while. Aroma is slightly sweet, with a touch of alcohol. It reminded me a bit of a mellow barleywine. Taste was hoppy piney with a small touch of citrus. Felt ok in the mouth, a little thin, but nicely carbonated. Fairly easy to drink, as expected for the style, not what I prefer however."
"Only the 3rd beer I've had from Boulder, and I gotta say I've really liked everything so far. Also only the 2nd ""Indian Brown Ale"" I've had and I think I'd like to try more of this style."
"D - This is a good beer thats pretty easy to drink theres not too many browns out there that are like this one with the amount of hops that come through worth trying if you see it"
"D - Very tasty. The big hop aroma/flavor for a brown plays very nice with the malt backbone. I hope they make this a regular release."
"Boulder Beer doesn't get enough love. Maybe that's because they're in the same state as one of the all-time great craft breweries (Great Divide). In any case, this brew is all kinds of delicious and deserves to be released on a regular basis. Drop the 30th Anniversary part of the name, keep the Flashback Ale and... voila."
"This brew is light, crisp, and full of flavor; easily quaffable. However it doesn't leave your palate longing for more. With that being said, it is still an interesting, hoppy brew."
"Yep, Boulder can crank out the good brews, one should never be disappointed with them."
"A very good beer. I welcome all types of hybrid/crossover beers."
"this is an excellent brown ale. you are going to find some bold resin hop flavors with a nice caramel malt. i have a friend from boulder that is completely bias when it comes to colorado beers. he thinks it is the beer state, but you gotta watch out for the fat tires out there. bleh. all and all id say this is a great brew to pick up. nothing too special, but nothing to shake a stick at. whatever that means."
"Mmmm this was a mighty tasty brown ale. Even had it not had the hop character that it does the malt profile is complex and very flavorful, so the hops only take it to another level. A nicely done brew by Boulder."
"Pours a little better than your average brown ale. Not whispy thin like some. Nothing about the aroma comes across. Taste is mildly entertaining. Certainly in the upper echelon of brown ales IMHO. It does have a decent earthy hop character. Mouthfeel and drinkability have nothing worth mention, not bad, not mind blowing."
"Not much more to say about this one: Nothing particularly noteworthy in terms of an IPA or brown ale."
"D) A well crafted brew. I'd have another."
"Don't rank too many beers straight 4's, but this one gets it. No obvious weaknesses."
"Pretty drinkable stuff. Glad i got to try this, thanks to raider for bringing this my way. As an anniversary ale i dont know if or when this will come back, but if it does id be more than happy to have another flashback..."
"D - Drinks okay, but I won't be seeking this one out again."
"Much drier and more bitter than the smell would suggest. Great hop finish. Smooth body with a lower than expected carbonation. Darker crystal malt flavor--toasted without any burnt tastes. The alcohol is present...mildly. A brown IPA--makes me want to have a second."
"Pours a nice clean/clear dark golden orange color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger creamy off-white head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, caramel, with some spice notes, and some hops. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, with some hop notes, spice/caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, a pretty tasty brew, but I would not call it a ABA."
"Poured into a standard pint glass a clear medium brown with some reddish hue,a tight formed slight off white that clung to the glass atop.A mix of citric hop,caramel,and light roast in the nose,I was anticipating a little more of that cascade hop profile to come though.The hops are more prevelent on the palate,a mix of chocolate malt and sweetish caramel mixed with big citric hops,a nice earthy tone finishes a pretty complex brew.A very nice IBA,better then Terrapin's, but thats besides the point,a damn fine beer."
"Morey's Bottom Line: I'd like to try a fresher sample of this brew before slamming my final stamp on it. However, it's still pretty good."
"12 oz. Bottled August. Kind of a hazy, brown pour, some yeasty looking cream colored head. Some pine and roast nut, light malt aromas. Taste is a well balanced blend of toasted malt, nut, smoke, light chocolate. Finish is slightly bitter anise and pine and fairly clean. Light mid body and quite drinkable. Reminds of some English browns or bitters. Certainly worth a try if available."
"Picked up a single of this, but could definitely had more."
"This brew pours a brilliantly clear very deep copper/amber with a lush, clingy off-white head. The aroma is moderately hoppy, citrus character and is also moderately malty, sweet, nutty and a bit of raisin. The flavor is highly hoppy, rather citrusy with medium-high bitterness. After the initial hop flavor there is a low malty background; raisin and nuts with a slightly dry finish. The carbonation is moderate with medium body. Overall this is an enjoyable brew."
"In the mouth, an excellent blend of roasted malts and big, over-the-top hopping, sweet matched with bitter and grassy. All Cascades in 5 additions. Smooth, rich, flavorful, and ridiculously easy to drink. Super tasty. Would've been a fine brown ale, but the extra hoppy edge makes even more worthwhile. Sweet, then bitter, then smooth, then rich and rewarding, and ...an excellent way to salute 30 years! Good one, Boulder! I can drink and drink this one...and drink again!"
"No way this is a session beer but on a cool night like this, it's not that hard to kick a few of these back as the last of the leaves fall down. Even though this doesn't have any spice in it, a little bit of nutmeg or cinnamon would go well with this since it seems to have ""fall beer"" written all over it. While this isn't Boulder's best offering, I enjoyed this a lot and am glad they broke the stylistic mold that most of their beers (that are distributed in this neck of the woods) fit into. Worth finding if you're into dark beers with some oomph behind them!"
"M/D - Mouthfeel is a bit above average for the style, but this is a very complex beer that I don't consider particularly drinkable."
"Drinkability: This beer is all over the place. I can't really say that it is a good beer. The flavors conflict and it is far too sweet. Average."
"A perfectly drinkable India Brown. I'd like to do a side-by-side with Terrapin's ... but I don't have Terrapin's on hand. Alas."
"pours a dark chestnut color with a small head and little lacing..the smell is maple and nutmeg,brown sugar and honey..it smells great..the taste is the same its nutty malts and sweet malts followed by a nice hop profile..this is one tasty brown ale i put it up there with DFH and bells it has nutty caramel taste with a nice hop bite it is well balanced flavorful drinkable and yeah recommended"
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style while intensifying the hops profile, listed as an ""India-style Brown Ale"" on the label this beer is exactly that, overall it is a good beer with a lot of flavor and substance making it worth drinking for a long time."
"Drinkability: Again, I wish the styles were a little more balanced; smelled like a brown ale, but tasted like an IPA. I also feel like this one is a little overdone. Five additions of Cascade hops is a bit much. Still, this was a good beer. Definitely worth the purchase."
"Good stuff..."
"Medium-full body. Carbonation level is a little on the lower side, but it complements the body nicely. All in all, this is a pretty good beer, but it took some getting used to. After the first half of the glass, it went down easier."
"Drinks fairly easy, not the best Indian Brown I've had, but not shabby. I expected something bigger for a 30th anniversary offering, but a Boulder Beers go, this is better than many"
"Middling at best, I am shocked at the A- rating this thing has on this site."
"drinkability is good. i'd certainly call it more of an english india brown ale, but it fits that title well. nice balance. easy drinking and interesting. good stuff."
"I like stout in the winter and IPA in hte summer so what could be better than this India Brown Ale for the Fall. It has a dark cola color with an adequate brownish head. The caramel malt hits you first followed by the crisp citrusy finish of the hops. A very satisfying blend of two distinct styles. Who'd have guessed this would be such a fine combination."
"The beer pours a ruby red/brown color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a kick ass roasted and bisquit malt scent along with a very nice hop nose. The taste is great also. It has a wicked bitter hop bite laid over a base of roasted and bisquit malts. It's dry with some caramel character. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a tastey brew with loads of character. It's hoppy as hell with a great malt backbone."
"D I found the bottom of the pint glass without too much trouble. 4.0"
"Hops are immediately noticeable on the nose as well as the palate. Esters are prominent, but nothing is overpowering. Hoppiness is real but balance is key. This is really a beer one could drink all night, especially at 3 dollars a bottle."
"I got this in a 12 pack from the beer of the month club that a buddy gave me. This months selection features four beers from Flying Dog Brewery and the Boulder Beer Company."
"D - A bit bitter for my taste and could use some more malt, but a very interesting beer."
"Not really even sure what to say about this one - it hits the American brown ale style almost exactly on the head. Nice, well blended hops and malt, a touch of chocolatiness mixed in with nice fruity hops. Feel is excellent and this one's highly drinkable. One I'd get again right up - another good one from Boulder."
"D: This is an interesting offering from Boulder--one of my favorites from them; it's quite drinkable--although the alcohol presence does start to overwhelm after a few drinks"
"My favorite watering hole here in Richmond just added this beer. Reminds me of some of my favorite beers of yesteryear, namely the big brown warmers, now vanished, like Potomac Rappahannock Red Ale and Wilmington Dergy's Amber. Seems to me this kind of rich nutty flavor profile is hard to find these days. Close your eyes and you would think this was a darker beer than it is. Nice amber color but BIG roasty. Well balanced for what is basically a hoppy stock ale. The brown-ness is the thing and you could hardly find a beer that offered more nutty toffee roasty flavor. I'd prefer it to be a bit less alcoholic so I could drink it faster. It pushes the limit on warmth and bitterness for this style of beer. I'd like to try it in a bottle."
"pours out a slightly hazy dark amber/bronze/crimson colour with a thinnish head and sparse lace. sugary sweet aroma of figs, anise, cocoa, toffee and citric hoppiness. it really smells nice and layered. taste is a combination of the nose...lots of dark malt flavours...chocolate and caramel are dominant...toasty, roasty and a bit warming from a slight alcohol bite. the back end is full of citric hop bite that compliments the overall dryness of this ale. lingering bitterness. very tasty. the mouthfeel is crisp and sharp. overall body is seemingly light for a higher ABV beer, but that might be due to the mouthfeel and dryness. drinkability is very good. it fits the bill for me as an india brown ale. recommended."
"Sizzly mouthfeel, very tingly, dry and tannic, woody. Tasty and drinkable, good mix of dark malt and hoppy bitterness and lots of other flavor nuances."
"Overall, not a bad beer, just nothing I'd would want a lot of. I don't like the combination of an ipa and a brown ale that much, because the beer is trying to be too many things at once."
"This pour to my pint glass was a nice plum to deep amber color with a slight head and consistent lacing. The aromas of sweet malts and fruity hops mix nicely. There are definate aromas of candy sugar and dried fruits. The understated hoppiness is layered with heavy overtones of malt and molasses. This brew is smooth and borderline rich. There is a great layering of flavors here, really the first beer to teach me about flavor layering. The pleasant carbonation and tendency away from being syrupy for a sweet brew are nice."
"Overall, a very nice hoppy brown - one of Boulder's better brews."
"Drinkability: this beer was a bit to crisp for me and the bitterness was a bit stronger than necessary. But overall a decent beer."
"12 ounce bottle, w/o freshness info. Pous darker honey amber, clear, under a fluffy and long lasting medium khaki head, which in turn leaves a boat load of quality sheeting. Mostly malt is what my snifer picks up, sweet, and perhaps a bit musty. Smooth and flavorful brew. Caramel malts up front then quite grainy, oily, bitter and hoppy late and in the finish. Notes of burnt toast, caramel malts and resiny, gainy hops. Enjoyable stuff, hop lovers will dig this one, non hoppy beer lovers likely will find this to be overly bitter. Worth a try, but would not expect to order/buy this over and over again"
"The hoppy moments are so carefully balanced with the dark roast aromas and flavors of a brown, that this off-putting pairing actually turns out to be quite a success."
"D - A hoppy yet well balanced beer. A worthy choice for a relaxing beer or even if you plan on downing a few more!"
"Pours a clear copper, light brownish orange, very thick off white head forms, settles down to a solid layer, drops tons of lace on the glass, looks good. Smell is nice, caramel, biscuits, bread, very floral, light citrus, toasty, sweet fruit, touch of raisin, pretty nice. Taste is very sweet and malty, corn syrup, floral, very light roast, toast and biscuit, touch of fruit and citrus, very solid bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, super smooth, and very balanced. A real nice beer, I enjoyed it."
"Tastes like an amped up, hopped up brown. Kinda like Bender only not quite as good (not that I'd ever complain if more breweries tried making their own Bender!). Chocolate, biscuits, toffee, fire, pine and oranges. Nice."
"D - This is a very hoppy (and tasty) interpretation of an American Brown. Cascade hops are a classic in the American craft beer revolution (thanks to you-know-who) and this beer showcases them nicely. It's very fitting this is Boulder's anniversary beer."
"D- this would be a good sixer purchas for a hot day. However, sometimes the hops can be a lil overpowering but if you love hop you will love this beer."
"M & D: Medium-bodied. Good carbs w/ a slick finish. A good effort from Boulder - I could drink a few."
"Really a great brown ale/amber ale. Thick in mouthfeel but I could drink this all night."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew has a true dark amber color with a thick full white head that leaves sticky lacing down the sides and has great staying power. The aroma is at first a little sweet, but then you catch the citrus and floral hop notes. The taste is just amazing starting with a caramel malt and buttery dough tastes with light chocolate that is closely chased from the tongue by a bitter hop kick. They constantly go back and forth and between the sweet chocolate and bitter hop notes. This is extremely smooth (a little more carbonation would make it really pop) and the finish is clean. What a brew. No reason these CO boys have done so well with this brewery!"
"I love this style and this brew ... too bad this one is only a limited release. I guess I'll just have to delve deeper into this style to find a suitable replacement, lucky me!"
"This beer has a bitter back that was a bit much for me. It had the bitterness, heck, it even had the nose, but lacked the flavor."
"Nice complex flavor and one to definitely savor."
"It's labeled an India Style Brown Ale on the bottle, and that sums up the experience of this beer. It's different in a good way, especially if you like both IPA's and Brown Ales, which I do; definitely worth trying this beer if you can find it. It's part IPA and part Brown Ale, and you can distinctly taste the two styles which made this an enjoyable beer for me."
"Drinkability: Now this is an India Brown Ale. I have had the Dogfish Head one before, that was more like a huge Brown Ale on crack. This is more of a true hybrid. That said, I prefer the DFH. Also, I would rather have a true IPA or a really good Brown. I like the idea of the hybrid, just not sure I love it in actuality. Regardless of all that blathering, this is still a really good beer. Nice job!"
"I like a brown ale with some bite, and while this isn't equal to Dogfish Head's India Brown Ale, its a tasty treat."
"Poured a brownish/red color with beige to light brown colored head forming on top, it then quickly dissolves away. The scent of sweet malt seem to stick in the air, a hearty bread aroma is in there as well. The aroma finishes with a nutty caramel fragrance. That malt is strong at the front of each taste, then blending to a nutty, bread flavor. It then finishes with a surprising bitterness at the back, with an earthy and grapefruit citrus flavors. A medium bodied feel at the front, it then gradually gains weight as it reaches the back of the palate. An India style brown ale, the look and aroma makes you think you are about to drink a malt bomb. Then you get that smack of hops at the end, that balances it all out."
"Nice bubbling inside cola nut brown hues beneath sweet filmy foam. The hops give the walnut and pecan aromas some mint and pepper spice notes. Pretty unique flavor profile. Starts with super nutty and roasted malts. Then add some spicey and citric hops to your taste buds. Sweet malts and spicey hops blend super well for an overall drinkable, and unique sessions brew."
"I believe this is a strangely colored IPA. Otherwise, it is the hoppiest brown ale you could imagine. But, that being said, you could love this beer as something different and interesting."
"D: A mixed bag with Flashback Ale -- a great look and nice aroma with good flavor that unfortunately peters out and doesn't leave a good finish to remember it by. Glad I tried it but won't go back."
"Very nice entry from Boulder beer. Way to go, beer of the month."
" ~ I really like this brew. I'm really glad my friend William is so generous with his beer. I would love to get my hands on a six pack of this stuff!"
"D: Good beer in its style. Nice overall balance with maybe just a touch too bitter bite."
"D - Good. Not sure they were shooting for an American Brown as the smell and taste differed greatly from style."
"Very glad to have tried this beer. All around quality beer that would be a great year round beer."
"Pours a deep dark brown, somewhere between an IPA and a stout, a bit darker than a regular brown. Nice head and retention. Smell is a bit muted, basically some nice piney and slightly grapefruity hops. Smells like a hoppy pale or a muted IPA. Taste... this is definitely more dark IPA than hoppy brown. A lot like DFH Indian Brown, but I like it more. Resiny, almost leathery hop flavor, mixes very nicely with the dark malt. They dont compete for your attention. I can taste it on my throat still, lingers quite pleasantly. A nice treat to try, if not one I would drink regularly."
"The bar i got this at called it a dark ipa. Maybe it was the power of suggestion but it definately had enough hops to live up to that description. A very good beer that's not too high in alcohol that you can enjoy it in the afternoon. Not great color but the flavor is great."
"D: A drinkable beer. One of Boulder's better efforts."
"This muddy amber beer poured with a slight amount of foam that reduces to little amounts of lacing. The aroma of the beer gives you a distinct malty beer with slight oder of hops. The taste is similar to the aroma however the tones of malt and hops. Slight caramel tones also peak through with the aftertaste."
"Definitely a good brown ale, one of the better one I have had actually. If you like a hoppy brown ale you owe it to yourself to give this a try."
"The mouth is crisp and firm. Flavor is nice and bitter, but with a soft sweet finish. I'm getting some nice caramel notes, but can tell this is an 'India' Brown by the moderate citrusy hop flavor as well. This beer is not harsh in any way at all. I could drink one after the other. I really dig this style, and this is no exception. Recommend."
"MF and DK: Medium to medium-full body. Light carbonation projects warmth and ease of drinking. A nice little bitterness lingers. Alcohol isn't noticeable. Cheers to a brewery that doesn't need to make a quadruple IPA or an Imperial Imperial Stout for their anniversary....not that there's anything wrong with that."
"Average beer. I was hoping for a bit more out of an anniversary beer. I wouldn't necessarily call this a brown ale. More like a pale."
"Mouthfeel was medium in heft."
"30th Anniversary Flashback Ale pours a copper color with a thick tan head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is citrusy hops. The flavor is very nice, lots of nutty and malty flavors up front with a nice citrusy hop finish. Quite tasty, very well done."
"D: The booziness, even though its labeld at only 6.88abv distracted, the malting and the hoppiness muddled together not giving a real sense of quality to either one. A little boozy for multiples, decent by itself flavor wise but a weak nose and average mouthful brings this down a few, but don't be afraid to give this a try."
"Conclusion: Still not one of my favorite styles by any means, but this is pretty tasty, the hops are juicy and delicious; the brew's impecabbly balanced and it's nice for a change of pace from IPAs...if the malt flavors matched (or approached) the malt aroma this brew would be even better...still, it's nice for what it is, which is kind of reminiscent of what a barleywine ""light"" would be like."
"D - This is a great brown ale. I regret not picking up more since it isn't available here."
"D= great. Really nice well rounded beer. Really nice balance of some more extreme flavors."
"D: Pretty drinkable but a little uninspiring for an anniversary beer. I do like the somewhat woody character."
"Pours deep red, almost brown with large fluff head. Smells heavy: molasses, spice, pepper. Tastes of roast, spices, hops, maple, prunes. Medium bodied that is powerful on the palate. Definitely seems stronger than it is. The low ABV on such a rich beer is not the norm for American brew but I respect it. The only downfall for this beer is that the syrup and spice rubs me the wrong way toward the end of the drink."
"Rolls smoothly off of the tongue before the bitter flash at the finish. Loose on the carbonation, letting the flavors reign. This beer certainly resonates and deserves to be enjoyed slowly."
"As is this is pitched as Boulder's 30th anniversary beer, I'm guessing we won't see this beyond its current release. I'm glad I got to enjoy a few of them while it's still around."
"pours a deep red copper color with a decent head and has some nice lacing, i think i see a puppy! anyway, the scent is of roasted malt, but that it, its not a very strong or distinct aroma. taste is average, it has a nice malty flavor to it but nothing that really stands out as special, maybe i have an older one cause other people really like this one, but i'm not super impressed."
"Other than that, wow. One of my new favorites."
"The feel is smooth and oily; creamy and perfect for style. It's a damn good beer. Hoppy, yet balanced."
"Clean, refreshing and easy to drink, even with such boldness in the hops and the darkness of the malts. Probably not as strong in flavor or strength as Dogfish India Brown Ale, but maybe more drinkable."
"D: A nice offering from Boulder. I'm glad I picked it up."
"This beer pours a clear ruby coloring with a 1/2 finger of light tan head to it. Head recedes quickly leaving a film that retains for the entirety of the beer - spotty lacing left on the glass. Nose is of piney hops with a hint of chocolate and roasted malt backbone to it. Taste is of piney hops up front - definite spice here, intermingled with a roasted and almond malt... moving in to a touch of chocolate flavoring and finishing with some grassiness and hop bite. I've not quite had a brown ale of the fashion before. Great flavors and well blended and balanced. Medium bodied, medium to higher carbonation, thick and at times oily feel on the tongue then drops off for a dry finish. This is a nicely balanced beer that is worth sitting with for a while."
"D- easy to finish and found myself wanting another. i bought it as a single this time, ill be going back for the full sixer next time. this is one of my favorite offerings from boulder. something i wish they would make year round, or at least seasonally. check this one out while you can, it deserves your time."
"Definitely a winner from Boulder, great job on this one. One day this will be a style unto itself..American Hoppy Brown Ale."
"Poura a fairly light brown to copper color with a large tan head that had great retention. The head eventually settles to a thick cap. Heavy lacing is left on the glass. Definate Cascade hop aroma. It is an unusual aroma with the citrus and darker brown malt aromas combining. The taste is more IPA than brown ale. A lot of hop flavor, bitterness seems low however. A little chocolate and nutty characteristics briefly make an appearance before giving way to the hops again in the finish. Has a nice body and carbonation. Has a soft texture that enhances drinkability. A nice fusion of two styles, interesting but I don't think it will be the next big thing."
"This is not a bad beer at all and could be a great session beer."
"Boulder Flashback is a crystal clear sparkling red ale with a dense, creamy, khaki head that has outstanding lacing and retention. The aroma is of fresh citrusy hops, like fresh-squeezed orange juice with a touch of roastiness. It's medium bodied; smooth but lively with a slightly caustic finish. It's well bittered with orange peel and green, leafy flavors. Chocolate and roasted flavors take up the rear. It's a little top heavy, but's quite drinkable and engaging."
"The malt and hop characteristics both come out nicely, especially in the aroma. They combine to form a delicious, unique brew! A wonderful anniversary brew. Happy 30th to the folks at Boulder, and thanks for another winner!"
"Significant malt aromas with an earthy, spicy, hop character. Dark amber with tan head; poor head retention. Sweet malt flavors with late hop bitterness that mellows on finish. Good mouthfeel with a pleasant spice notes. Medium bodied but with a clean finish. Beer became more complex as the glass warmed up. Hop bitterness was more apparent near the end of the beer."
"Drinkability- Overall a very drinkable and enjoyable beer, but dont get this one if you are not a fan of hops cuz its big bold and bitter, I wish malt backbone was touch stronger, but a definitely enjoyable example of the style"
"This one is a winner from Boulder Brewery. A Brown Ale for the hop heads, but doesn't over do it. Tasty and somewhat complex. Recommended."
"D- I really enjoyed this brown ale a lot. If I could find some more around town I would buy it up. Good twist on a old take."
"The Flashback poured a clear dark brown color with good 1-2 finger foam head and some sticky lacing that wasn't everywhere. The nose was nice with some brown sugar sweetness and biscuits. The taste had a little bit of an off flavor for the first few drinks then you didn't notice it. Strong malt back bone with good bitterness. In the mouth the back of your throat felt the ibu of the hops. Overall not a bad beer but the off flavor in the taste had me rate it a little lower than it might have been."
"D-I really like this one..glad I picked up a single to try....I've heard the India Brown Ale comparisons and I would agree....nice beer..."
"Notes from and tasted on: 6/17/09"
"If you like your brown ales hoppy, this is for you. Personally, I enjoy an easy-drinking, sessionable brown, but I can appreciate what they were trying to do here. It's described as an Indian Brown on the bottle, so perhaps it's supposed to be a mix between brown and IPA. Either way, it's a little unbalanced by the hops but still an interesting one-time offering."
"The blend of hops makes for an interesting character on this beer, and I'm slightly torn. Its a good flavor for an intriguing style, but the piney notes are not my favorite of the spectrum. Overall, this is a step above most Boulder beers, but thats not saying a lot. Most things from them are sub-par to average, my one exception being cold hop. Decent, but unspectacular."
"M/D: Medium body, about medium carbonation. Very good drinkability. Smooth beer, very tasty. A very solid beer."
"Slightly hazed dark brown with a large two finger head. Very strong lacings with lots of bubbles. Aroma is brown sugar and earthy hops. Taste is citrus bitter hops with a very strong backbone of dark somewhat sweet malts. The hop character imparts a soapiness on the back of the tongue. Strictly rated as an IPA it falls a bit short. As a fairly unique Brown Ale I would say it scores much better than average.. Some hints of coffee and semi sweet cocoa. Very nice beer overall. Great mouthfeel. Not as sessionable due to the 6.9% abv. Good for a couple anyway. Nice and different beer."
"Drinkability - I was really curious about this style and was really pleased I ordered one. Great complexity, amazing taste, and high alcohol (7.2% according to Shawn); what a great way to celebrate 30 years!"
"This beer pours a brown color with a reddish tint around the edges. The head is one inch in height, and recedes very slowly into a half inch of firm foam. The aroma is molasses, toffee, graham crackers, and a hint of roasted malt. The taste has all the malt goodness the aroma does with the addition of a significant hop presence. The hops aren't overpowering is a messy way like I have found in a lot of other India Brown Ales. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with nice carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is a very nice beer that I would certainly drink again."
"Mouthfeel is rich enough. Drinkability is good, this is tasty, smooth and complex enough to warrant a couple..maybe three. I like this one!"
"The drink is heavy-medium in body with lush, creamy feel and fine-bubbled carbonation. Like most everything else I've enjoyed from BBC, Flashback Anniversary Ale is well-made, tasty, and plenty quaffable."
"Drinkability: I'll give it a 4.0 because its refreshing and the hop bitterness makes you want more, but its medium bodied and a touch chewy."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied and slick with good carbonation."
"EDIT: I think it's easy to get excited about this beer because it's hoppy, but I'm not so sure it's warranted. The hops overwhelm the malt, and the flavors don't mesh as well as I'd like. It feels like someone took 1/2 of an IPA or strong APA and then mixed it with a brown ale. In some ways I think the ""hoppier is better"" bias is probably inflating the scores on this one a bit. It's good, but not great."
"Very clear dark brown, red color. Aroma is a mix of sweet smelling cascade hops and a twinge roasted coffee. Nice lacing up the side of the glass. This is a very interesting flavor. Almost a mix of an ipa and a porter. Roasted coffee upfront with a bitter hops backbone. The cascade hops compliment the coffee very nicely. Taste is not overpowering so you could have a few of these at a time."
"Clear dark amber with a creamy light tan cap that leaves sticky lace on the glass. The nose is piney hops and citrus peel with toffee. The flavor is resinous cascade hops with nice roasty caramel/chocolate malt flavors to balance. This beer tastes very fresh and delicious. Smooth and medium light bodied with a lingering oily hop bitterness in the finish. The style is listed as an ""India-style brown ale"" on the bottle, a beautiful hybrid."
"overall - i think browns get overlooked in a sea of ipas and stouts so if you can try this one i say cheers"
"M/D: Nice whole body on this. Nothing too aggressive, making it very drinkable."
"moderate carbonation makes this an easy to drink beer.really i wasn't expecting much from this beer but it's great.pick up a six pack,it's a deal!"
"Drinkability: A solid anniversary ale from Boulder. Seems like the hopped-up American Brown Ale is a thing other breweries are trying to do, and I like the possibilities of where it can go. Give this one a shot for sure."
"not sure how limited this one will be, but it would be a nice fall beer for Boulder to consider putting into their rotation"
"D - Very drinkable. Not too high in alcohol to keep one from having a couple."
"Grapefruity cascades on the nose. Good blend of caramel, chocolate and hops on the palate. Low to moderate bitterness. Round, smooth, medium body. Good beer, think I'll have another."
"D: Smooth, flavorful and balanced. I could knock back a few of these. Disguises the moderate ABV well."
"Pours a nice brown amber color with a whole bunch of visible carbonation. Big fluffy off white head that is slow to dissipate, leaving clingy lacing. The smell kind of reminds me of a red, also including faint citrusy hop notes and roasted malt. Roasted malt and some citrus bite (minimal) on the front with a slight skunky flavor, then finishes with a mildly bitter aftertaste kind of like semi-sweet chocolate. The bitterness is just about perfect. The mouthfeel is ok, mildly viscous and nicely carbonated. Drinkability is alright, goes down fairly easy and at 6.8% it's not killer. I would probably score this again."
"Overall- A little sweet but very drinkable."
"Drinkability overall is excellent a quality sipping and quaffing brew that will lead to great discussion and contemplation of brewing styles. Here's to thirty more for Boulder Beer, I definitely love me some Mojo Risin', keep churning 'em out."
"i love buying beer out of curiousity and being pleasantly surprised."
"Ahh!my cask I could find on the trip, enjoyed at The Ginger Man. Good Bitterness, roast and moderate carmelness, all give the bitterness a good tastiness. Dark brown with a caesar crown head. Very drinkable cask, I could have this frequently.Aroma may have been there on-tap."
"D- Smooth and velvety, not overly bitter, and has a moderate ABV. I would enjoy sessioning this."
"Overall, I would say that Boulder has a hit on their hands here. I would love to see this as a seasonal beer, maybe for the Fall. I would put this in the same league as Red Rocket Ale as far as hoppy ambers ales go. And yes this beer is amber, not brown like the label states. Highly recommend this one."
"I am normally not a fan of Boulder Beer. The Hazed is the only beer they make that I can really stand by. Like the Hazed the hop profile here is excellent; however, I would like a bit more 'brown' in this india-style brown. That being said, this may be my new favorite from Boulder Beer."
"d: interesting and mostly good balance of activity here, enjoyed the carbonation-to-smooth transition"
"This is neither an IPA nor 19%, not sure who entered this beer...Nice amber color, ample tan colored head. It smells like citrusy hops and the taste is a lot more of the same with a little bit of a dark maltiness. This is pretty good and something I will probably buy a couple more sixers of before its gone."
"EDIT: So, I just looked this beer up on Boulder's website, and it weigh's in at 6.88% ABV. I guess I high-balled it a little. Obviously it was listed wrong on BA. How does a beer get added without it being reviewed anyway??"
