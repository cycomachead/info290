Over Ale won't knock your socks off, but it's a nice departure from the IPAs and Pale Ales and Imperial Stouts.

Aromas of chocolate, caramel, toast, brown sugar, nuttiness, light roast, brown bread, slight pine, and floral hops. Very nice aromas with good balance, strength, and complexity. Taste of chocolate, caramel, toast, nuttiness, brown sugar, brown bread, light roast, light pine, and earthy floral hops. Slight earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, caramel, toast, light roast, brown bread, brown sugar, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice flavor balance, robustness, and complexity; with zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and very smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice brown ale! Very nice balance and robustness of flavors; and very smooth to drink.

There's a subtle touch of milk chocolate and muted sour dough. This stuff is medium bodied but it's very effervescent with tiny bubble carbonation for a full, foamy feel that finishes just a tad dry.

The yeast is mainly clean, but adds a little bit of dried fruit to the mix with nice sweetness from the malt keeping it focused. I found this to be a very good American brown ale, not the best of the style, but very solid and a great balance is achieved which makes for a drinkable somewhat stronger ale.","Slatetank","May 27, 2012"
3.91,2.6,4,3,4.5,3.5,4,"The Crack & Glug initially netted me better than two fingers' worth of thick, mocha-tan head with great retention. Color was a deep-copper/light-brown with NE-quality clarity. Nose marked it as most definitely being a Brown Ale. it had a very brown sugary malt sweetness to it. Mouthfeel was medium, but it was not as sweet in the mouth as the nose had suggested. Instead, it had a minty hops quality accompanying the chocolate and biscuit malt flavor, adding up to the liquid equivalent of a Girl Scout Thin Mint cookie. Yum! Finish was very minty and not at all what I had thought that it would be. Also, great sticky lacing throughout.","woodychandler","May 27, 2012"

4.18,9.7,4.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Half Acre Over Ale pours a deep chestnut brown, with some orange highlights when held to light. Three fingers or so of cream colored foam rise up to top the beer. Head retention is fairly good, most of it fades away over five or so minutes, but the last bits of foam stick around for a long time. Lacing is left in a nice webbed pattern. The nose is solid, if unspectacular, lots of lightly toasted nuts and crisp biscuits. The flavor leads off with those same two malty notes. Next comes a lighty firm bit of bitterness (yup, definitely an American take on a Brown Ale), along with some earthy and light grapefruit hoppy notes. The slightly dry chocolate that comes in for the close is what takes this beer to the next level. The body is just a little light for the style, which in turn helps the carbonation come off as a little more active than it probably needs to. While it's not quite perfect, Half Acre Over Ale's still a pretty darn enjoyable American Brown Ale.","axeman9182","Beers"

Sweet bisquit malt, some caramel and toffee. What you would expect for the style. Sweet tobacco. Taste- sweet malt, toffee, some mild hop bitterness, maple, tea leaves. Sweetness coats all flavors, really liking this one a lot. Better than I expected. Mouthfeel is nice, this is a really drinkable beer overall. I would have it again.","lnashsig","0"

In the mouth there is a good balance between the earthy hops, but perhaps the malts stick a bit too far forward and get a little too sticky to me.

It would be a good staple beer that I would keep in stock if it just had a little more body and some more carbonation to keep it lively. It still is greatly drinkable though and even though and I had no problem killing a growler by myself over a few hours time.","weatherdog","Dec 14, 2010"

4.52,18.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,5,"Just purchased a half barrel from the brewery this fine evening for my kegarator. This stuff is dangerously drinkable - just finished my first pint and heading back for number 2 in quick order. Very solid brown ale in my opinion. The alcohol is not terribly noticeable and I'm suspecting that it will sneak up on me in quick order if i'm not careful. Although I intended to pick up a half barrel of daisy cutter, i don't regret this for a second. Very tasty and worth the drive from the south suburbs up to half acre for a fresh keg (dated 11/13/2010) of Over Ale. Just in time for Thanksgiving - and believe me when I say I'm thankful.","stangski83","Oct 16, 2010"
3.33,-12.6,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"The last of the Three Growlers from our Half Acre tour trip. It pours a clear dark sunset amber topped by finger of thick creamy foam. The nose comprises pine, grapefruit, grass, and some light biscuit. The taste holds notes of green tea, melon, cucumber, grasses, and very light biscuit. The hoppier notes seem to strangely overpower the very meek malts for me. The body is a light medium, with a light carbonation and a feel that migrates from fluid to dry. Overall, an okay brew, but a bit unbalanced and grassy for my tastes.","TMoney2591","Sep 24, 2010"
4.16,9.2,5,4,4,4,4.5,"I've had this before at the brewery and loved it so I figured now was a good time to review it. This pours a nice rosewood color with a good pillow head on the top that is well retained with beautiful lacing down the glass. The aroma is both of nice fresh hop and some caramel malts. There are some roasty and nutty smells in the background as well. The flavors are a nice balance of malts and hops. The hop flavors are akin to some nice orange zest. There are bitter flavors, but they are in the background of the nice roasted caramel and butterscotch flavors. This beer is very well carbonated and aside from bitter notes which are appropriate it was a very smooth beer. This was really easy to drink, it pairs well with most foods and is a definite recommendation from me.","Vdubb86","Jul 14, 2010"

4.13,8.4,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"D: Over Ale is an easy drinkin' brew from an up-and-coming brewery, one that I like very much (and is also a block from my house). I'm truly enjoying this- very sessionable at 6%. This beer is also an excellent match for the spicy lasagna. The smooth, creamy mouthfeel is a nice extension of the creamy mozzarella, ricotta and goat cheese in the meal while the caramel and toasty flavors do a good job of balancing out the spice in the hot Italian sausage. The minty/spicy hops, although mild, also kick up the spice while the malt works to balance it out- it's a wonderful little tug-o-war going on.","jhoban19","Feb 08, 2010"
3.92,2.9,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Overall- This is a tasty brew! A bit more than expected out of an ESB, but tasty nonetheless. A great beer for when you are feeling like you want a little more than your typical lawnmower beer can offer, but you dont want to be overwhelmed. This is a nice rich, complex, malty brew with an excellent complimentary hop balance. It offers a lot of complexity, but is ridiculously drinkable and makes one heck of a good session brew. One of my local favorites!","dudemuskie","Feb 05, 2010"

3.6,-5.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Poured with a full head that went flat quickly, a nice dark brown color promising warmth which I need right now. The smell was all biscuit for me and this came through in the taste too. The biscuit taste was balanced by some spice on the end that evened things out and made this a very drinkable beer on a cold day. The mouthfeel similar to a lot of English bitters left my mouth dry. So I drank more!","cilldalua","0"
4.52,18.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,5,"Pours a reddish, medium brownish, ckear ambe with a nice two finger head to start. No bubbling though. The smell has slightly sweet caramel and bready toasted malts while the hops adda little orange spice to each sniff. The taste is equally balanced with great, touch of sweetness malts and full of bread and biscuits. Then the hops bitter and spice things up to even out the malts a little. Super session ale right here! A little grainy and bubbly on the palate. Just a nice English style ESB.","scruffwhor","Oct 27, 2009"

4.05,6.3,4,4,4,3.5,4.5,"D: It just didn't deliver like I think it could. The malt profile was a bit weak and at times it had a slight watery taste to it. The hop profile got the better of the malt.

4.05,6.3,4.5,4.5,3.5,5,4,"Very good. I like this one better than the Half Acre Lager, the flagship brew. This one on tap is hoppier than the bottle version to me, same as the lager. Go figure.
