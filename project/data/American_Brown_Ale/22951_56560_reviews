review_text
"Is this a typical brown ale? No. It is rather an extrapolation of the style. I must admit myself suspicious of the term 'double' applied to a brown ale, but this certainly justifies the term. It remains Brown Ale-like, and does not spread into the real of porter or strong ale. Nutty, malty, gorgeous. Yum."
"Appearance: Brilliant mahogany, chestnut, 2” light tan tinted white foam cap dissipates to thick film, excellent lace. Smell: aniseed, thick dark bread, fruit cake, faint chocolate. Taste: Starts rich and malty and then dries out and gets espresso coffee astringent and lingers in the finish. Mouthfeel: Creamy smooth with an astringent background that rises in the after taste. Medium carbonation to medium low – carbonation is very fine, very soft and very well done. Medium full body."
"Great for a brown ale. Lots of flavor, great looking beer with a creamy head and awesome lacing. Mouthfeel is great. I know I rated this higher than others but compared to other brown ales out there I think this rating is justified."

"Pours a clear, brown producing 2 fingers of frothy, moderately lasting, tan head that leaves a nice sheet like coating of lace. Aroma is malt forward as expected with nice floral hop presence, dark, toasty bready malt,  roast & nuts with bittersweet chocolate. Taste is deeply malty, toasted pumpernickel with roasted nuts, bittersweet chocolate & brown sugar hints with an unprecedented, brown ale hop bitterness. Finish is toasted maltiness, bittersweet in a wash of pepper. Afrertaste is an even more bitter version of the finish with a heavy taste of char. Mouthfeel is medium-heavy bodied with moderate carbonation, a little prickly, nicely thick & chewy but creamy. Totally out of character with brown ales due to the hoppy profile I feel it deserves a style designation all it\'s own. Touche\' Clown Shoes!"

"Very drinkable brown ale with rich coffee flavors. Floral nose works well. Perfect body that fits the heaviness. One finger width caramel colored head. Underrated imo and I love brown ales."

"Overall average. It lacked some of the notes I typically associate with a brown ale."

"PIcked up some Clown Shoes to commemorate the Patriots' Super Bowl win. Read into it what you want. This is a very tasty brown ale. It pours nicely with a frothy head that leaves no lacing. I didn't get much aroma from it - a bit of burnt sugar and faint hops. However, when this beer hits your taste buds, it comes into its own. There is plenty of chocolate and dark roast coffee, with a lovely hop finish. Carbonation is minimal, which lends an extra level of quaffability to this brew. I'll be seeking out more product from this brewery!"

"Bomber poured into a mason jar mug. A dark reddish cloudy root beer brown with a light ring of beige bubbles rimming the glass. I don't mind the label either. Aroma of dark lightly roasted malts with some bitter baker's chocolate, sarsaparilla-like herbs and spices, cherry, brittle toffee, instant coffee crystals with whitener, and faint floral hops. I've seen better looking beers but the aroma is solid. I dig the notion of a ""double brown"" and this does deliver some rich nutty malts roughly congruent with the nose ... Plus some light molasses, raisin, malted milk candy and a wee bit of drupe fruit perhaps. Rather sweet up front but gets bitter during the tail end, albeit not harshly so. Floral hops combine with dark malts to yield a tobacco-like vibe, sweet pipe tobacco as opposed to cigar. Sturdy medium-heavy body with more carbonation than expected but this does not detract. Finish is bitter chocolate plus lightly resinous hops, which oddly enough works quite well. I am an inveterate Clown Shoes imbiber and this is an essential part of the canon. Hits most or all of the different dark malt notes without going overboard on the roasted elements like a stout might, and has a more hefty body and flavor than do lesser brown ales."

"well carbonated but not ridiculously"

"Appearance is dark brown with a great head and impressive look. Smell is, to me, the weakest aspect of this beer. Smells of caramel, hops, and light floral notes. The taste is quite nutty and warming, with a pleasant aftertaste. Overall, a very solid beer from one of my favorite breweries."
"O: Pretty solid beer with good flavors and plenty of hops to balance things out. I might pick up another bottle and see how it does after six months."

"O: Not the best by Clown Shoes. It could be the style, as I have not had it in a long while. I was disappointed."

"American Brown Ale? Why the hell not, truth in advertising is not said nation's strong suit. Way more amber than brown, and with a few smoky and hoppy notions more aligned with the nascent Black Ale denomination, I'm at a virtual loss as to whether this one comes anywhere near the ballpark (talk like a native, they won't know!) of the purported style. Ok, on to my actual baggage-free impression - ummm, tastes good to me!"

"More people need to make good brown ale's in my opinion. I thought Brown Angel was great. The first beer from Clown Shoes I bought was this for nothing other than the artwork on the bottle but I became a big fan. The appearance is a dark brown with an off white head which sticks a bit to the side of the glass. The smell was very sweet with hints of chocolate and walnuts coming through. The taste was more subtle with roasted malt and barley coming through with a nice clean finish. The only thing I'm not a giant fan of is it's a little thin but easily overlooked. I love this beer because it's the beer that got me into Clown Shoes as a whole."
"It tends towards the sweeter side, but it's really good."

"Overall: This is a rich tasting brown ale. It has the flavor of a good stout with the body of an ale. In a blind tasting, it could pass for a medium bodied stout."

"Overall I thought this was a pretty good beer, and very nice example of a hoppy brown ale, it had pretty much everything that I look for in the style and it kind of reminded me of Short's Good Humans, which is a good thing. This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, clean, not too filing and the taste did a good job at holding my attention, I would have no problem drinking a bomber to myself and if I was really in the mood for this style I could see myself drinking a couple of bottles without getting tired of it. What I liked the most about this beer beer was the balance, it was pretty much prefect and no aspect was too overpowering. What I liked the least about this beer was that the nutty flavor didn't come through a little more, but it wasn't that big of a deal, but I think it would make it a slightly better beer. I would buy this beer again, It wouldn't be something I buy a lot of but having a bottle in the fridge for when I'm in the mood for a hoppy brown ale would be a good thing. I would recommend this to anyone who doesn't mind their Brown Ales on the hoppier side. All in all I was happy with this beer, it was just what I wanted it to be and I thought it was pretty enjoyable. Good job Clown Shoes, this beer was just what I needed, keep up the good work."

"Dark brown almost a mahogany finished oak hue with a light beige head forming thick, head has speckled lacing around the sides of my glass. Aroma has herbal and citric hop notes, with bready caramelized sugars, and mild yeast dough like character. Flavor upfront herbal, pine, and citric bitterness coats the palate and doesn't really let up much, big imperial brown ale for sure. A bit muddled especially as I poured the last of the beer in, this beer is dry and would benefit from a touch more malt base. Mouthfeel is medium bodied slightly slick with hop oils, well deserving dry finish from the boat loads of hops these guys threw into this brew. Overall I wanted it to love it since the label is top notch, but it's just okay for me this go around."

"Deep mahogany brown in color with excellent clarity. Poured with a thick, dense, off-white foam that slowly reduced to a thick cap that leaves a ladder of sticky lacings on the glass. Roasted malt and powdery dark chocolate aromas with floral hop, nutty, and roasted coffee notes. Feel is on the heavier end. Big malty feel that's bolstered by rich, soft, carbonation from front to back. Roasted and dark caramel malt flavors up front. Dark chocolate and floral hop flavors build through the middle and transition to roasted coffee and pine hop bitterness to the end. Finished with dark roasted malt, earthy floral and pine hop bitterness. This takes a fairly unextraordinary style and reinvents into something worthwhile. Not the first time I've had this and not the last. Hope it gets switched to the 12oz format like other Clown Shoes offerings."

"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 6/19/2013. Pours nearly opaque dark reddish brown color with a 2 finger dense and rocky khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of grapefruit, orange zest, lemon zest, tangerine, chocolate, caramel, toast, toffee, light nuttiness, light coffee, floral, pine, and floral earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of hop and dark malt notes; with good strength. Taste of grapefruit, orange zest, lemon zest, tangerine, chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toast, toffee, light nuttiness, floral, pine, and floral/toasted earthiness. Fair amount of pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, chocolate, cocoa, caramel, coffee, toast, toffee, light nuttiness, floral, pine, and floral/toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and complexity of hop and dark malt flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy, crisp, and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent hoppy brown ale! All around great balance and complexity of hop and dark malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"Pours an opaque brown color. White head forms and leaves some lace. Aroma of nutty malts and floral hops. In the taste, caramel, nuts and chocolate with some piney, citrus hops. Toasted and balanced brown ale here. Medium bodied brew with an even carbonation. Overall, this is a high quality brown."

"O: I had high hopes but the thin body does it in for me."

"Given that my favorite styles are DIPA, American Black, Barleywine and Imperial stout, it's possible that I am underrating this beer due to purely personal preferences. However, it also seemed to be significantly over-carbonated, resulting in a suboptimal mouthfeel."
""
""
""
"A rather good brown ale. The alcohol heat becomes increasingly more noticeable after a few sips and somewhat distracts from the malt and hop character, but by and large, it lives up to its “double” styling with big, bold flavors."

"Poured into a snifter glass. Pours opaque dark brown with a thick beige head that dissipates very slowly. There are lots of visible streaming bubbles that can be seen on the side of the glass. Lots of lacing is left on the side of the glass during consumption. There are aromas of brown malt, toffee, nuts, chocolate, and some floral hops hit the nose. The flavors do follow the nose. There's some mild toffee sweetness with some nuttiness and roastiness from the malts. I get some faint chocolate notes and plenty of back end bitterness from the hops. There are also some citrus notes. The body is light to medium with strong carbonation. The hops and malt roastiness remain in the aftertaste for a little while. This is a good beer."

"Taste: Delicious. The aforementioned triumvirate of dark chocolate/coffee/toffee hits you in sequential order, each of them permeated by a sweet caramel tinge that many others have noted. The nuttiness found in the aroma is present throughout the entire brew, and it reminds me of a pecan at times in the way it complements the overall creaminess of the beer. As the beer warms, a spicy hop presence becomes increasingly notable, much like the Tramp Stamp ale. Body is actually pretty light, and there's little to no carbonation to offer a bite on the tongue. Finishes incredibly smooth with a slightly ""wet"" mouthfeel; I could drink this all night."

"O - very balanced and complex, flavors are on the bold side and leave me contemplating each sip, an extremely well done brown ale, I recommend this one"

"O: Very good Brown ale, might be my favorite esp for a category that I typically find dull. Great fall beer on a cool night. Bittness works well with the chocolate malts."

"Chestnut brown body with slight haze. Fluffy beige head leaves sporadic, droopy lace. On the nose I get light roast, some brown malts and a little sourness. Flavor is malt centric with caramel/roasted blend of flavors. Again, I perceive a little sourness, acidity... which is not very welcomed by me. Body is medium at best. LIghtly carbonated. Very average."
"Poured from tap into pint at barley oak, mandeville, la. Pours a murky brown with tan head gone quick. Sweet chocolate and slight rye aromas. Taste is slightly bitter malt; chocolate and rye. Nice bitter earthy hop presence, maybe a slight coffee note. Nice brown ale. Not as creamy as I like or out of the box, but its really good. Nice brew for sure."

"Clown Shoes. New to Minnesota. Grabbed a bottle today after reading the label and thinking it sounded pretty good. Hoppy brown ale. Why not? It's brown, so far so good. Smells really nice. Very fruity and hay like, almost reminds me of a well hopped pilsener oddly enough. Slight ""brown"" aroma as well. Toasty and roasty. A bit of cold press coffee there. Hops at the vanguard. Citrus, floral and grassy. Well defined. Fruit contribution seems to come from the yeast. Subtle apple/pear esters. The ""brown"" is mellow. Faintly roasty. Shit, I've had black IPA that was roastier than this beer. There is a caramel character in there that's adds a nice layer to the hops. Transitions into a wonderful bitter, estery finish. Great body, carbonation and mouthfeel. Just perfect. This is one hoppy brown ale and I'm glad I picked it up. Not the first Clown Shoes beer I've enjoyed and I'm sure not my last."

"From the bomber into the pint glass this is an opaque dark brown colored ale with a giant mound of root beer float tan head and plenty of lace remnants. The aroma is a very tasteful chocolate malt and fruit nougat with a minty, herbal accent. Add a touch of pine skunk and you have a classy nose hit. The flavor follows with a neat marriage of sweet chocolate malt and funky cabbage-pine hop bite. Really interesting and tasty with a creamy feel, medium bodied with subtle carbonation. The hops are very classy here, not smashmouth at all, sort of swampy-veggie, but a definite key to this wonderful flavor. Smooth, flavorful and different. Very nice."

"O: Very nice brown ale. Bit more bitterness then i expected but it worked well with the dark roasted malts. Clown Shoes keeps kicking out nice brews and this is no exception."

"22 ounce bottle, bottled 7/11. Served in a mug, the beer pours a dark reddish/brown color with a half inch tan head that stayed around for a little while. There's also a good amount of lacing. It smells like toasted malt, brown sugar, toffee, nuts and some citrus. Taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like nuts, toasted malt, caramel, brown sugar, and some floral and citrusy hops. There's a slight bitter finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, with there being a moderate amount of carbonation. I think it's a decent enough brew, a buddy of mine picked this up for me on a not so recent trip out of town so it was nice to try it. Hopefully next time I'll have a fresher bottle."
""

"Good, but I did this beer no service by sitting on it for a year."
"This is a very dark brown beer with hints a red hues toward the bottom of the glass, the head is fairly thin (roughly one and a half fingers thick) and wanes considerably into a layer of bubbles and lacing. Medium carbonation and a slight haze fill the inner body of this beer. Coffee, dark chocolate, roasted coffee bean, fig and raisins all fill your nostrils as you breathe in the sweet aromas emanating from the nectar of the gods. The mouth feel is rather light and dull, but the carbonation is very present. The flavor is mild overall, sweet, bitter when it hits the sides of your mouth and it fills your tongue with roasted coffee bean (mildly) roasted malts, very mild hops. The aftertaste lingers long after you swallow, it’s a bit harsh and slightly bitter and is dominated by roasted malts, brown sugar and mild hops. I think I just found my new favorite brown ale!"

"22oz bottle with Bottled 4/2012 on the side. Pours a dark, murky brown with an inch of frothy tan head. Lots of lacing. Aromas of caramel malts, earth, brown sugar, and a hint of citrus. Taste is mostly of caramel malts with floral hops at the end. Maybe some hints of chocolate. Silky mouthfeel. Tastes a bit boozier than I would have expected. Overall, one of the better Brown Ales out there. Well done."
""

"On-tap. Pint glass. Enjoyed on jun´12. Reddish brown color, ruby to the light. Clear appearance. Beige, copious froth, lasting crown & rocky rings. Toasted malts, bitter cocoa & herbal touch to the nose. Crispy & malty upfront. Hints of chocolate & dark fruits in the middle. Subtle citric hues. Light to medium body. Moderate carbonation. Creamy & silky palate –underlying bitter river. Long bitter chocolate finish & roasted coffee grain aftertaste. Refreshing & flavorful."
"This is a really solid brown ale. It has great flavor and great drinkability. The malt character is spot on with just enough hop character for balance. I wish this came in six packs, I would buy them for sure."
""
"O: there is barely a single thing I can say that is bad on this, this is an exceptionally well done beer. I know I'm biased towards browns, but is this really this good?"
""
"By the end of the 22oz, I was ready to change it up, but I think simply the notion that I was able to drink 22oz of any brown ale, kind of speaks for itself, as I fall into the typical, kinda ""meh"" on the brown ale style these days."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a murky brown with an explosively large khaki head that eventually settles to a thin cap on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt and nutty aromas. Taste is very much the same with a medium amount of bitterness with each sip. This beer has a very high level of carbonation that is just too much. Overall, this is a pretty average beer as it stands and I think there may be a slight infection issue with the huge head and extreme carbonation that this particular bottle has."
"Overall: not bad, not great. Can't help but compare to dfh Indian brown which is a go to brown for me."
""
"O/D-An amped up Brown Ale. Several flavor components. I am starting to appreciate Brown Ales more and this is one of the better Browns I have come across. Plenty of flavor but still fairly light in body for a rather high ABV brew. Clown Shoes is very consistent with their offerings."
""
""
"O: Not a fan of this beer. The flavors are just way off, and the higher alcohol level doesn't really help this brew out. I don't think I'd buy it again."
""
""
"Pours out a medium brown beer, huge ass head, i didnt pour too hard to induce it either.Smells very nice , has major porter scents to it, coffee,roasted scent. Tastes rather like a porter also, not that i care, its good.Semi sweet ,malty, hoppy. An ok beer as i get closer to finishing the bottle, im beginning to find it a bit average."
"Overall: This is a very subpar brown ale. Over carbonated and no real malt presence. I will never have this one again."
""
"Overall: As expected, it was a hoppy brown."

""
""
"O--Disappointing. Lacks balance and not true to the style. Does get better as it warms."

""
"Decent enough drop, but not particularly complex or full, and tending a little towards unbalanced. I've certainly had better American Browns, but this one does the job, if unimaginatively."
""
"O: This is a solid brown ale that will appeal more to coffee drinkers because that is what the flavor is more geared towards. Nice price point and easy to drink"
""
"O: Pretty good for a brown ale but not as good as some of the other offerings from this brewery. I like the added hoppiness to the traditional brown ale flavor palette. I could and would drink a couple of these in a session."
"O: This beer has a nice strong taste and is rather drinkable."
"Overall a fantastic and well-conceived beer."
"O: A good brown, very complex but didn't blow me away."
""
"Pours a brown copper hue which leaves a three finger crater head and creamy lacing,the smell is dark fruit,molasses,brown sugar and burnt toffee,the mouthfeel is medium bodied and has tastes of brown sugar,raisins,molasses,coffee,figs and the finish is a tad bitter very simialar to the finish of a coffee and overall i like my brown ales and even though its not over the top all the ingredients work and i would drink again."
"Overall – pretty interesting brew to sample, and pleasing to the taste!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tastes like thin muddy water, not at all appealing. Virtually no carbonation left after the explosive head formation. I have enjoyed most of Clown Shoes' offerings and was disappointed in this offering. I can only assume that this bottle is off, and not a true representation. Nevertheless, its all Ive got to go on."
""
"Overall this is a decent beer to find on tap at a bar/restaurant, as it's hop bitterness and medium malt flavors balance well with almost any traditional American mid-scale restaurant food. I have avoided this beer in the past as I typically do not enjoy hoppy brown or black ales, but this wasn't too bad, probably because I find hops are muted/fall off in keg/bar beer and because it paired well with the dinner. Not bad, worth a go over the traditional rubbish most restaurants have available."
"O - An interesting mix between a brown ale and stout. A little bitter for me, but overall quite nice. Goes down quite easily."
""
"Nothing springs to mind save ""Brown Sugar"" and ""Jackie Brown""... Anyway, this stuff pours a sweet sienna topped by over a finger of mocha foam. The nose comprises toffee, brown sugar (nailed it!), light coffee, light cocoa, light tobacco, a touch of grass, and a kiss of cashew. The taste brings in more of the same, though the coffee is a bit more powerful, the cocoa is darker, and the grass has morphed into some earthy cilantro-like greens. The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a somewhat creamy feel. Overall, a very nice brown, something I could easily see reaching for again."
""
""
""
"Cheers."
""
"O: Good brown ale, definitely on the hoppy side of the spectrum. Some decent bitterness and not a lot of sweetness either. Solid example of the style."
""
"I do love the coffee. It's very robust and not subtle at all, but as a coffee fan it's a good thing. Drinkability is a tad low due to this, but having a glass was awesome."
""
"O: I am a lover of the darker ladies, so when one recommend this to me, I had to try. She was spot on, name says it all... My lady friend is now my Brown Angel..."
""
"Overall very good. More hop character than a lot of brown ales, which I like."
"D~ Hats off to Clown Shoes for producing beers that have yet to disappoint and are very creative. The artwork ain't too bad either. Try one out it's certainly worth the pricetag."
""
"It has a crisp finish with a little more carbonation than I like, aftertaste is on the bitter side."
""
"With a 2/11 bottling date, I’d say the finishing hops (Columbus and Amarillo) are gone. Even still, it’s pretty simply constructed, though it is very creamy. Unimpressed, but prepared to give a Mulligan for this one."
"O: On the whole, this is a well made, drinkable beer."
""
""
""
"M/O: More chocolate/coffee notes come out while warming up balancing the hops. Nothing mind-blowing though. Pretty good brown ale, here."
""
""
"Woody aroma has hints of caramel and pear. It pours a dark chocolaty brown that lets daylight in only at the very edges. The sample I got fizzed like crazy, so be careful! Light tan head is quite thick, fine-bubbled, and persistent. Crisp flavor has caramel, malty and woody notes plus hints of fruit and yeast. Firm-bodied texture has a lively fizz that leaves a satisfying and tasty finish."
""
""
""
""
"This is a safe bet for browns, but nothing out of the ordinary."
""
"Pretty good!"
"This, frankly, wasn't really what I was expecting. It's not a bad beer, it just wasn't what I was expecting. Even if it were available in my area (which it is not), I probably wouldn't get it again, but would certainly drink it if I happened to have it around. Check it out if you really want to, but no need to go out of your way."
""
"This beer is a murky brown color...translucent with a cloudy, hazy complexion. It's a very heady brew...towering and firm tan head. High carbonation, notable on inspection. The smell is hoppy, earthy, and malt-sugary, but a bit medicinal. Sweet taste...sugar, roasted malts, and moderate bitterness. Yeast...dark bread and dried fruit. Carbonation and sugary characteristics define the beer. Medium-to-full body, which is nicely contrasted with the carbonation. This is a middle-of-the-road brown ale."

"Overall: easy to drink this brown ale. Nice flavor profile, and the bottle can easily be consumed in a short session. Worthy of a try."
"Food Pairing- Beef ribs that have been rubbed with salt, pepper, cayenne, and brown sugar glazed with a chipotle bbq sauce."
"Overall a very drinkable beer, fits the american brown mode being a bit bigger and hoppier. Definitely try this if you like browns and a fair amount of hops."
""
"Yea, nutty and floral with a nicely smooth and rich mouthfeel. Malty up front with lots of bitterness on the finish. Maybe a little too much hops for me, I would like the nice cocoa/toffee malts to be more forward...they seem to compliment the yeast notes well. I like it well enough, why cant they make this shit in six-packs? Thats a shame, paying 6 bucks for a bomber of this makes it unlikely to buy this with any regularity."
""
""
""
"Poured into an imperial nonic a clear rich brown with a sticky,tight one finger khaki colored head atop,two broken rings of lace were left behind.Chocolate malts,roast,and fruity esters in the nose,as the beer warmed some sweet alcohol notes came into play.Medium smooth feel to the beer,roasty and earthy with lightly sweet chocolate flavors,a light shot of ""green"" hops lingered in the finish.Not as hop assertive as I thought it would be but its a very good brown ale."

"Was hoping billshmeinke was crazy, he's not. Starts out pretty good but fades from there."
"It looks nice, with an excellent lacing of hops and malts on the rim. It has a nice malty taste to it, so delicious. The overall taste is a nice beer to enjoy on a cold night."

"Bomber from Premiere. A sweet aroma. Enormous soapy head, lacey. Long bitter finish. In a word: nutty brown. Very drinkable Hops and malting is so balanced. Better than its rating in the sense that I would serve this regular to people if available down the street. Great for the style."
"D - Browns aren't my favorite, but this one is pretty tasty."
"Medium bodied with a blast of dry earthy hops which are slightly dry and bitter but not overpowering.  The floral hop flavor lingers over the sweet notes into a subtle dry finish.  Underneath there is a prominent silky malt character with lots of chocolate flavor.  Slightly roasted with caramel, toffee, toast and nut.  Pretty complex and decently balanced.  The hops could be toned down a bit so that the malt character can shine but other than that it's pretty good.  "
"O: I like a good hoppy brown ale more than most, but this one doesn't do it for me. And the flavor really doesn't justify the abv. Maybe I should try a fresher bottle, but at the bomber price I probably won't."
"O - Impressive brown ale that has a chocolatey taste. I like the dominant sweetness that makes this feel like a dessert beer. This is one angel that you want at arms reach at all times."
"With some warming, and with some effort, you can extract the nicer qualities of the malt (nutty, roasty) and live with the rest. But it's still pretty one-dimensional and not all that impressive. Sure looks good, though."
"Solid all-around brew. My first ""double brown"" -- I could get used to these."
"O- Just not a great Brown in my opinion. Too much burnt wood/fig smell and taste. Not smooth with the 7%. Not very flavorful or full. A bit hoppy and alcohol tasting. Probably my last Brown Angel-"
"O: Tasty, drinkable and worth a try"
"Overall: A nice beer. No flaws, but a bit too neutral over all for my tastes."
"O: I hope that this beer isn't supposed to taste like this because it was just awful."
"Medium, almost full body with a restrained effervescence that presents mostly on the front half of the tongue. Smooth and easy to drink with just a touch of coating on the tongue and palate. The merest hint of warming at the back of the throat. This is a really good beer. I'd like to try others from this brewer."
"Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"O - for the double brown ale label i was defintely expecting more than this...its not bad, i just had higher expectations and really wanted a sweeter beer and i usually don't want sweet, the only reason im finishing it is because i strained my neck working out and want to fall asleep quickly, anyway i would recommend this to few but to some...."
"Overall, it is a very flavorfull and drinkable brown ale that I would gladly have again, but it lacks some of the subtleties that would push it into the upper echelon of the style."
"Medium-low carbonation keeps the Brown Angel very smooth throughout and the sweetness makes it a bit syrupy."
"Poured from a 22 to a pint glass, it pours a deep brown with thick tan creamy head. Aroma is nutty and sweet, with a roasty nutty chocolate flavor. Not generally a fan of brown ales, this is very creamy, smooth and an easy drink. Taste is smoky, somewhat burnt nutty, malty flavor that is very smooth. One of the better brown ales I have tried to date."
"Opinion: This is a pretty well made beer overall. I personally like that the balance is biased toward the malt. The contribution from the dark malts is a bit strong, and maybe just increasing the carbonation would change that impression. I am going to hold out by saying that this is a pretty darn good American Brown Ale, and I would like to try it on tap where the carbonation would be a bit more controlled. Otherwise, I would recommend that you give this one a shot anyway."
"This brew pours a muddy brown color with two fingers of thick, rocky head that quickly drops to a persistent cap. Lacing is good. The aroma is a bit muted, and pretty generically malty and roasty. The taste is of a big, balanced brown ale. A nice, slightly nutty maltiness runs the show, but is followed up by a significant hop presence. This too, gets mellowed out by a pretty strong roastiness, which rides all the way into the finish. The mouthfeel is solid, it's got a high level of carbonation and a body on the lighter side of medium. Drinkability is very good. Overall, a nice brown ale with a significant American influence from the hops."
"Medium body, slightly higher carbonation, a little chewy and dry on the palate. Drinks pretty well, although I thought the nose was slightly muted - still a decent brown ale though."
"A pretty solid beer for what it is: a brown ale. Nothing to get excited about, or write home about, but if you're looking for a brown ale, this is for sure a step up from Newcastle."
"Overall an adequate brown ale, but not one I would really ever go for again."
"Pours a very nice dark brown color, very nice carbonation, HUGE thick foamy/creamy three-finger plus light tan head, with tons of sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with a nice little hop note going on, with some nice chocolate/toffee/caramel notes. The taste is sweet, malty, little hop note, nice chocolate/toffee notes. Medium Body, nice little dry finish. This is one very tasty Brown Ale. Thanks Bill!"
"pours the darkest of browns with a full two fingers of a thick frothy khaki colored head. five minutes after the pour the head is down to a cap on the beer all the while leaving big lumps of lacing as it recedes. the nose and taste go hand in hand. both are big on roasted malts and cocoa. mouthfeel is full bodied with a smooth flow to it, meaning it's not chewy or thin, it's just right. overall this is a really good brown that tastes more like a stout, swear i tasted coffee in this one."
"Overall this is a complex and heavy beer, but as a fan of Belgian Quadruples, it is certainly something I can handle. Not for beer neophytes of course. I applaud the brewery for originality."
"Clown Shoes Brown Angel is a dim, reddish brown ale with a thick, bubbly, yellowish foam that lasts all night and leaves solid foam on the glass. It has a chocolate and coffee aroma with a good dose of citrus, grass and perfume. It's pretty full bodied, super silky and smooth. The finish is soft and delicate. It leaves the mouth feeling almost a little tingly, like after eating a mint. It has a nice, full, well-blended, well-balanced flavor. It's very chocolatey with some dark roast coffee. The hops provide just enough bitterness to zip the taste up and keep me coming back for another sip. It tastes a little wooden, but not resiny. There's a hint of lemon peel. There seems to be a hint of mint at the finish. Wow, I don't know if I've ever had a brown ale like this before. This is straight-up delicious. I can't put this beer down and when it's empty, I'm going to cry."
"O: Overall this is a really really nice beer, I would drink it again. not a typical brown ale, but pushes the limits of style guidelines and ended up really nice"
"A brown ale dialed all the way up to 11? Check. Can't rate it as a traditional example though. Check it out anyway!"
"This beer pours nutty brown with about a half inch of off white head which recedes leaving a thin layer. There is lots of very nice lacing. Very pretty beer. The aroma is nutty and mildly roasty. Pretty nice. There is also a mild floral hop aroma. There is a bit of coco and roast that comes through in the flavor along with a very nice pleasant roast nutty flavor. A bit of caramel sweetness comes along with it. Nice enjoyable brown ale. Good carbonation, medium mouthfeel. Very nice enjoyable brown ale."
"One dimensional bitterness, very little malt complexity at first. As it warms there's some vague coffee and burly dense malt flavors, pinned under a numbing layer of bitter pine sap. Specialty malt and an overload of bittering hops. It comes across as coarse and heavy handed. Medium to full bodied, ample carbonation. A bit too rough to want another."
"Nice brown ale here. Very drinkable and enjoyable. Good balance. Worthy."
"O-Overall I'm a tad disappointed. I've been dying to try this beer and didn't really live up to the hype for me. It's a good beer, but not a great one."
"I thought it was a decent beer but it wasn't a double brown ale, and didn't deliver the ""layer upon layer"" of malt the bottle talks about. Way too hopped out for me, but I guess a lot of people like that."
"D- Overall, this is a pretty solid brown ale that I wouldn't mind drinking again."
"O: This is a relatively unique Brown Ale with some nice qualities but it falls short of great in my opinion. I'm glad I got to try it but I wouldn't seek it out again. Thanks to Michael for the chance to try this one!"
"O: Nice flavors, well balanced alcohol, and a wonderful head make this a very pleasant beer to try. It does feel a bit watery, and I wish it had a bit of a bigger body."
". Deep dark brown in color with a wonderful tan head on top. Very nice robust look to it, almost a cedar hue to it. The aroma was a big suprise. Rich cocoa and hints of roasted malts. Touches of caramel as well as a light tobacco touch to it. Really huge brown ale here. Smooth, mellow carbonation, rich, creamy profile with each sip having to be savored time, and time again. Lots of rich caramel malts wash across the tongue with the very first sip, and so it begins as the smooth, mellow cocoa notes start to come together and mixed with a light, earthy bitter hoppiness"
"Solid beer. I'm borderline offended by the ""controversy"" of late. It's a sexy brown-skinned woman with angel wings and clown shoes. How is that offensive? This is just beer, get real."
"I will definitly add this to my beer repitroire."
"D - Nicely balanced and tasty."
"Nice use of malt in a good Brown Ale. Nothing really jumps out because balance is the key here."
"O- This beer has some nice Northwest coast hops up front with a good brown ale in there and some nice British hop character in the finish."
"The cpj"
"Light body, over carbonated, not great on flavor. There are better american browns out there."
"3.0 D: Definitely a big of a strange brew. Not necessarily bad, but I'd really have to be in the mood for that worty taste for me to want to drink that. I usually get my fill of that, however, from sampling homebrew at various stages in the process."
"overall, I really enjoy this beer. this is my second try from this brewery and I havent disliked anything they do. I love brown ales, and this one just goes a bit bigger than most. Would definitely purchase again."
"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side for the style with carbonation being moderate. Overall it was a pretty easy drinking and good tasting beer. The hoppiness mixed better than I expected with the big, malty, brown ale flavors. Pretty solid beer overall."
"O: The beer came across like a screeching bitter bomb with little roasted malt or other flavors. Felt unbalanced and over hopped. I cant say I will reach for another."
"Overall good stab at and American Brown Ale. Would maybe seek this one out every so often, but not something im crazy over. Had no problem finishing the bomber myself."
"D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is a very nice beer to drink for a long time."
"I like this beer and would recommend trying it."
"Overall: This beer is quite fantastic. The complex flavors and smells are blended together wonderfully and I will definitely be keeping this beer in mind this summer."
"It's an enjoyable take on a brown. The hops add a nice edge to style without compromising the standard."
"OA: I enjoyed this one a lot, and can't wait to try more Clown Shoes Brews."
"Pours a reddish brown mahogany with a thin white lace of head. The aromas of hops mixed big malt feel. Lightly roasted nuts, big caramel, chocolate, sour yeast, slight smokey scent blended in as well. Woody, nutty, and hoppy on the tongue. Strong malts, sweet fruits are also present. This feels watery in the mouth, light to medium bodied, sweet and bitter. This is a decent brown ale, everything seems to be blended well and comes out just right. Nothing in this beer screams out and takes a hold of me, but nevertheless a decent average brown."
"Great malty flavor wit a soft grainy texture, with a little creaminess too. Lots of roasted malts play well with the light creamy, grainy texture very well. Bread crust, dark muffins, light coffee, and mild coffee flavors as well. Pretty good beer worth picking up again."
"O: A solid American brown ale that verges on imperial per the ABV but is very drinkable and enjoyable."
"Medium-bodied, very pleasant beer."
"Pours a five+ finger cream head that fades very slowly leaving a good lace. Almost clear amber color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Nose is light nut, flavor is roasted coffee. Decent brown. $6.49 for a 22oz bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, Ma."
"O: My first Clown Shoes brew and I'm pretty impressed. I will be telling people to try this one because its not your average lackluster brown ale that you will typically find in the market."
"O- Nothing fantastic here, but definately my favorite from this brewery thus far. I bet this would go well with some nice grilled ribs and creamy coleslaw... or just a nice fat bacon cheeseburger with grilled potato's. It gets much better as it warm up and comes alive! A damn fine beer!"
"Prost!!!"
"Overall: I'm going to score the overall lower than any of the component scores, because the whole seems less than the sum of its parts. Its a nice, hop forward brown. The problem is that its not really hoppy enough (or maybe just not hopped in the right way) to be an ""India brown ale," and too hoppy to be an excellent brown ale."
"Overall, a pretty good beer, but it's just missing a certain something."
"O: Another home run for Clown Shoes, as their Brown Angel is absolutely delicious. I typically find most brown ales to be boring. This, on the other hand, is not. It's complex, hoppy and something I look forward to returning to. Without question, this is one of the best browns I've ever had."
"O: One of the best (if not the best) brown ale I've had in a while. Very memorable!"
"drinkability is good however i cant see myself ever buying this again due to the fact that it comes in bombers only - brown ales just do not do it for me"
"This is a great brown ale. Highly reccomended!"
"This beer is like a Brown Ale meets an IPA."
"This one has a medium body and ample carbonation. Dry and bitter on the finish. This is one brown ale that didn't really impress me; not bad but I probably will not be heading back for another one."
"Drinkability is good. But this is nothing like an american brown ale, more porterish. Too roasty for a brown."
"D: Overall, this is not my favorite offering from Clown Shoes. Compared to other browns I've had, Rogue's Hazelnut Brown especially, it's no comparison. There is too much malty/bready flavor throughout, which isn't my favorite feature in beer. Good but not a must try."
"A good example of the style, it's hop-forward nature distinguishes it as a decidedly American ale. There is a decent depth of malt, yet I'm wanting a bit more to balance the hops."
"D: Drank two like nothing. great beer!"
"Pours a clear, mahogany/brown color with a huge frothy head that goes nowhere. Fantastic lacing. Smells of slightly fruity malts, earthy hops, some citrus, slight caramel, subtle roast. Tastes involves some sweet, bready malts and nuttiness up front lending itself to a roasty middle with hints of chocolate and a spicy/herbal hop finish. A lot of subtle complexity going on here. Medium body and high carbonation. Very drinkable. One of the better brown ales I have had....a style that Im not very huge on."
"Beer has a medium body and the lead off is sweetness for sure. It is interesting overall, I'm pretty pleased with it. The finish is nice with mild bitterness from the grains, I'd have it again."
"D: I would definitely drink this again. Thanks Gregg!"
"Pours a moderately-dark brown chestnut color with a huge off-white head and gobs and gobs of lacing as it goes down my tulip. The nose is pretty good with a bit of citrus and roast as well as some other fruits. The flavor is about the same--some roast and a bit of malty sweetness as well as some orange and other citrus. The feel is somewhat bitter with a medium body. Pretty hoppy for a brown. I like it. Sort of reminds me of Short's Good Humans. Drinks pretty well. I would have this again."
"Nice brown, chocolate, dark malts, chalky drying hops. 7% no where to be found. Well done, very tasty and enjoyable."
"Interesting take on a brown ale. I felt like the citrus clashed with the caramel in this example. Would have liked a bit more malt as the bitterness was a bit much."
"overall not one I would get again but not a bad brown minus the astringency."
"Notes: I dig it. I don't care for brown ales at all, but this one is damn fine. No strange over-roasted malt. Yeast is clean and unobtrusive."
"D: Pretty nice. I liked the barely there undercurrent of dark fruit."
"From the 22 fl. oz. bottle. Sampled on November 27, 2010. The pour is an opaque brown with highlights of chestnut hue around the edges. The head is about a half-inch thick, tan, and silky. The aroma is fill of Mother Earth esters such as pine and nuts with a slight hoppiness up back. The body is full. The taste also brings out a pleasant earthiness with crystal malts and a good hopped ending. A very nice brown ale."
"Hazy brown with chestnut highlights. A thin, fine layer of beige foam coated the surface of the beer, while big soapy bubbles formed a thick collar. Good head retention, sticky lacing. Roasty aroma, malty with plenty of citrus character, kind of fruity, dry cocoa. Balanced flavour that walked a fine line between hops and malt. Sweet and juicy up front, partly from citrusy hops and partly from caramel maltiness. A bit drier mid-palate, chocolate and roast were more prominent, slightly nutty. It finished with some lingering bitterness, more hops, but a little thinner on the malt side. The texture was decent, medium bodied with moderate carbonation, slight dryness from the dark malts. Pretty solid overall."
"drinkable - oh yeah - absolutely."
"All in all, this is my favorite brew from CS so far. If you like the roasty / chocolate characteristics of porters and stouts, then you will love this. Very surprised by this brew. I love it."
"Picked up two bottles of Clown Shoes, and this was the first of the night. Shared with my wife as it was poured into stemmed glasses. Dark brown color with a fluffy tan head. Lots of lacing. Smell was very appealing, as it was spicy and bready and rum-like. Taste was awesome. Tons of malt on the palate. Just a hint of roasted coffee, but a lot of molasses and cinnamon. Mouthfeel was also superb, with a hearty body from the loads of malt. Really could drink this for a while, as its drinkability was not hindered at all by the 7%. I love how CS describes this beer as a double brown ale. To me, it was just doubly good."
"Poured a rich brown color that was lighter around the edges. It looked like dark maple syrup with a dense two finger tan head that hung around for the whole time and left nice lacing. Smelled nutty and coffee like with toasted malt with some brown sugar thrown in for good measure. Tasted lots of caramelized brown sugar and roasted coffee with some hazelnut notes. Decent hop bitterness and a little earthy, but mostly clean and sweet. Felt like a cask ale should; flat, creamy, viscous, and full-bodied. This was a great beer, especially on cask. I would have been more than happy to have sessioned these all night long."
"D - a bomber was easy to put away, and I would drink more if I had it."
"Thanks to Clown Shoes for a ""fresh"" look at this wonderful beer."
"I’ll say it again - I love this one - apparently more than the average reviewer here. It may be one of my stuck-on-an-island beers. It takes a style that can please a large amount of people and adds some excitement to the mix. Each layer of the flavor profile shines while balancing each other nicely."
"Can't seem to put this one down."
"Overall, this is an awesome brown ale when your looking for something with a good amount of body and still a good amount of hops. The label is pretty cool to boot. I'll definitely pick this one up again, especially when the weather starts getting a bit cooler. Perfect for a cool night!"
"D - Really, really solid. Goes great with my steak. Very very drinkable. Easy to drink this whole bomber!"
"D - Pretty easy drinking solid overall brew. A tad too sweet for my tastes but I'm not the most familiar with the style. This is a good beer but not mind blowing. I'd drink this again but wouldn't go nuts seeking it out."
"Hazy dark brown with a bumpy fluffy head that slims down to a film and leaves some decent lace but nothing too pretty. Smells nicely of pine, hops, and some pineapple sweetness and then later on the maltiness appears which was nice and created a better balance. The taste was a also nicely balanced between the hop/pine flavors and the nutty malty and hint of fruit flavor along with a dry wood flavor which I got more towards the end adn in the aftertaste. Very nice moderate carbonation and medium bodied. Really easy to drink and nice example of a style that is not overly popular."
"Tastes like Arrogant Bastard combined with a brown ale to me, I don't think they were doing it on purpose, but that is how it comes across to me. It is disguised as a brown ale because it has different malt and has that coffee taste to it."
"Review from notes taken on 5/8/2010: Thanks again to Reagan1984 for another bottle from this new brewery. Pours a medium brown color with a thin light tan head that quickly dissipates leaving little lacing. A nice mix in the aroma; coffee, roasted malt, and citrus hops are all present. Definitely a solid hop presence, making for a very inviting American Brown. Aroma lends itself nicely the flavor, with a sweet malt backbone supporting the delicious citrus flavors from the hops. Rather light mouthfeel, and seems pretty highly attenuated. I really enjoyed this beer, as I am really warming to American Browns in general. Once again, looking forward to more from this new brewery."
"Notes: Well this is quite a tasty brew from Mercury Brewing nicely drinkable. Cheers."
"Drinkability: My second taste of Clown Shoes and I can tell that these guys love their hops; I enjoy their beers though I note that they are a touch on the aggressive side; this is not the beer for anyone expecting the usual brown ale"
"D - The beer isn't really for me. Aftertaste is an unpleasant combination of astringency and sweetness. However, it was smooth and had the low carbonation characteristic of the style."
"D - This is easy drinking stuff. I could kill a bomber pretty easy. This was the better of the two Clown Shoes brews."
"Really excited by so many great new locals. I loved hoppy feet and I enjoyed this more, need to try a bottle. Had on cask at Stoddard's. The appearance was murky and dark brown with spidery lacing hanging out on the side of the glass. The smell was a little subdued, but I got lots of coffee, chocolate, and some fresh hops. The taste was fantastic. Like a chocolate, coffee, toffee bar. Smooth, creamy, wondreful. If the river was Brown Angel, and I was a divin' duck..."
"Overall I think there is still some room to spruce up the prescence and contribution of the malt flavors that seem a little lost of lacking. Although, I enjoyed this 'Double-Brown' quite a bit, and could definitely see myself drinking more of these as the weather heats up."
"D: I didn't care for it. Not a bad beer, but I was looking forward to the next one before I finished it."
"This is a very well done hop-forward brown ale which is a style that I like quite a bit. It's got a pleasant and flavorful hop presence that brings just the right amount of bitterness. I definitely prefer this to the Hoppy Feet."
"Toasted malt and earthy hops make up most of the flavor. Medium-bodied, on the dry side, perhaps a bit too dry for the style. There's a bit of bitter herbal astringency and some roasted malt in the finish along with faint solvent. Pretty decent, but not my favorite take on the style."
"O - this beer is beyond what I think of an average brown ale. It takes the drinkability of your brown ale, and adds in complexity, and layers of flavor. I would have this again in a heartbeat."
"Very solid hop-forward brown from some local folks who live and breath beer. Label art is tremendous."
"Well done."
"Overall, a really nice brown ale, very drinkable with a really interesting hop presence. Refreshing and easy to drink, surprisingly respectable at 7%."
"Overall, just a wonderful beer to sipped and enjoyed."
"Overall; awesome, highly recommend."
"This is really a nice blend of a true brown with some serious hops. A great beer from Mercury!"
"The beer is pretty hoppy. There are Columbus, Goldings, and Amarillo hops present. There is a spicy and herbal hop presence, with some estery bittering and grassy hop coming through as well. The spicy malt and caramel and slightly charred brown sugars add a bit of balance to this rather full bodied affair. There is a bit of ABV in the finish. The beer is not all that smooth, but it is much more than a prickly sipper of a beer, that's for sure. I'm also getting some crystal malts in the beer and brown sugars as the beer settles in a bit. This is a good beer with a rather limited distribution, for now."
"The balance is great and I could definitely drink a few of these. The sweet malt and hoppy taste blend together well and then fades at the end so as not to overpower your taste buds."
"D: I could drink this beer for many different occasions, an amazing brown ale indeed I highly recommend to anybody."
"Drinkability: I could sip these for a while. This is a nice hoppy and balanced brown ale. Very complex for the style."
