"Serving type: bottle"
"Overall: very well done and enjoyable. I can't really complain about this one."

"Overall, this beer is pretty good.  I like the sweetness and it fits to be a winter beer.  I would give this another try."
"Pours with a small, white head. Has a deep copper color. The subtle malt taste combines well with the sugar and wheat giving it a good caramel flavor just as the label describes. Can't wait until next Christmas season to get my hands on this one again."
""
"A good summer beer, but each time you drink it, it becomes more ordinary."

"Was not impressed with any particular aspect of this beer. Pales in comparison to other seasonals. More of an attempt to market it as a seasonal as opposed to being one."
"Son-in-law spotted a twelve of this for birthday party, so lets give it a whirl.  Twisting off the top I get a waft of some caramel and a zesty hint of spice.  Pours to a nice light root beer color with a tan head that recedes to a quarter inch then holds.  On the taste this brew is slightly roasted caramelly flavor with a tad bit of bitters in the background.  Mouthfeel is ok but not outstanding.  It kind of has a funky twang in the aftertaste that is niether sweet or bitter. This brew is drinkable and inoffensive but a long way from what I expect in a brown ale.  Sad to say for BMC the apple never falls far from the tree as they can't seem to go out on a ledge and need to try to please a general population.   Expected more just based on Blue Moon's Belgian White that is a good drinker for a BMC."

"This beer is so smooth! I just love it. My husband and I have completely different likes when it comes to beer but we both love this one."
""
"The beer pours a nice mahogany color, with ruby highlights. Decent clarity. A thin beige head disappears quickly, leaving no lacing or collar. Lively carbonation continues to stream to the surface in tiny jets. Not much in the nose. A little caramel malt, faint cherry and a macro-lager scent. The flavor is a mixed bag. There's a touch of brown sugar sweetness and a tame hop profile. Even with generous gulp sloshing around my mouth, there's not much to hold on to in the flavor department. Ever-so-hidden touch of brown ale nuttiness. That's about it. Behind it all, there's a slight roughness to the alcohol content. Marginally solvent-like. The carbonation is very prickly and it masks the thinness of the beer a little. Well, Mom, I don't see myself picking this one up ever again. It should work just fine for poker swill tonight, but that's the extent of my plans for this beer."

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a pretty amber/brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts, some sweetness. Taste is malty, sugar, a bit of nuttiness. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is an easy drinking and decent beer."
""
""
"This poured a nice coppery orange. The nose was malty along with a brown sugar syrupy smell. No hops to be found. The taste however was very thin. I was expecting some of that malty sweetness to come through but it ended very quickly. I thought the mouth feel was a bit too bubbly, almost soft drink fizz. It wasn't a bad beer, it was however average.  I also tasted the Winter Abbey Ale at the same time and they tasted like the same beer, had a hard time deciphering any difference so they review near identical."

"This was purchased in an Oklahoma grocery store so it had to be a 4.0 abv (3.2 abw) version. Would like to try it at a full 5.6% abv, it would probably have more warmth and character. Or then again it might be worse seeing that others have said it reminds them of malt liquor."
"A little nutty flavor saves this from obscurity, but it's not something I'd try again. Still it's acceptable for an American Brown ale, just don't believe it has anything to do with an abbey. From the 12 oz bottle purchased at Emigration Market in Salt Lake."
"O: Not bad but nothing special here - slightly too sweet for me. Easy enough to drink but not interesting enough to get again."
"Nice Beer for Christmas Eve eve"
"Overall: Solid middle of the road beer. It was simply, OK. Good beer that I would drink again, but not go out of my way for. Tastes like brown sugar in the body along with medium roasted malts. Sweet and malty."
"What a great winter beer. I really love the look and taste of this more common beer."

"Wasn't expecting munch. Blue Moon is a beer I have enjoyed among friends, not a go to beer. A little sweeter than regular Blue Moon. Overall not quite worth the $8.50, but not a terrible brew either. Try it if you want,"

"Overall: Wasn't bad, but wasn't extrordinarily good either. It was simply, OK. If I were to be offered this at a party or on tap, I'd take it maybe, but I wouldn't regularly seek it out. I will say this though, if it were more fine tuned, it could be a little more than ok."

"The Belgian candy sugar takes over the flavor profile. In short, it tastes like sugar."

"Overall: Pretty tasty, definitely has the brown ale idea. Would like it better at a lower price point."

"revisiting the beer, picked up a case on sale for 14.99 and at the price its real deal, a nice brown ale with sweet caramel notes . has  a best before date of 5/15 and it will gone way before that"

"I was anxious to get started with this one, so I employed a heavy hand in terms of the pour, resulting in a pretty pseudo-cascade. This settled into just over two fingers of dense, tawny head with good retention. ""Copper"" was exactly the word for the color on this one (SRM = > 17, < 22)! The clarity was button-bright and I was getting excited to try it. Nose had a light caramel quality, which was disappointing, since I expected more. Mouthfeel was medium and the flavor was definitely caramel, but still kind of muted, given their verbiage on the label. Likewise, I agreed with their calling the finish ""toffee"". In fact, I would say that the overall flavor was more toffee than caramel anyway. Call the finish semi-sweet as it was not outright sweet and just about as much as this hophead can tolerate. Once again, tis would be much more apropriate during the colder months, but c'est la guerre!"

"overall this is not what i expected. Original Blue Moon was great, this however is not a great brew. its simply OK. the sugar content takes away from the smell and taste."
""
"O - Not what I expected from anything with the name ""Belgian"" on the label. An OK beer, but closer to a Michelob Amber Bock than anything I have ever had labeled Belgian."
""
""
""
""
"Overall â€“ A sweeter but still rather easy drinking and enjoyable brew overall."
""
""
""
"I didn't want to like this, but it has a great warming taste that goes perfectly with snowy days. The hops and sweetness are well-balanced. Good if you are only having one. I brought it to a Super Bowl party and everyone loved it. Blue Moon really brings the taste in their fall and winter offerings."

"Overall - not bad, just boring."
"Pours a dark mahogany in color with a 1-finger of a off-white head that settled down to a thin layer on top. Some spotty lacing was seen with each sip. The aroma is of caramel malts and a hint of spice. The taste is about the same with the semi-sweet caramel malts coming through at first with a perfect balance of a hint of wheat and brown sugar as well. Perfect carbonation and no bitter or harsh aftertaste. Another great seasonal from the Blue Moon folks."

"This is understated and over-filtered for the style but not bad. I wasn't really expecting a super-premium abbey ale clone for 6.99 a six pack anyhow."
"O: decent but too mild. Very light flavored compared to the Abita Amber sampled after it."
"Not a bad beer, but not much going on besides a malty sweetness."
""
"always being a sucker for seasonal's from blue moon , i thought i would give this one a whirl. a nice amber color not to much on the head and no lacing . roasted malt flavor with a after taste that reminds me more of apples then of toffee. a nice solid beer if offered to me but i probbly wouldn't want a whole case of it."

"Didn't pour this one i drank ti straight from the bottle. The smell is of roasted malts caramel and spices. The flavor is a nice balance of malts, caramel, brown sugar, and winter spices. The overall mouth feel was pleasant although was a little more carbonated than i would have liked/expected."

"O: what a let down. I don't mind the BMC's trying to make good beers, but I'd rather they didn't flood the market with such sub-par offerings. This is basically dirt with a pretty dress put on it."
""
"This comes across as a sort of Belgian dubbel light. It has the malt and candi sugar. It has some of the aroma but falls short in appearance, flavor complexity and body. A decent effort."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I had tried this beer last New Year's Eve when it was called ""Winter Abbey Ale"" and the mouthfeel and smoothness of it is what got me into Blue Moon. They recently changed the name, and the flavor is more strong and rich than I remember. I could taste more of the alcohol and carbonation than the maltiness."
""
""
""
""
""
"Thin and well-carbonated with a swift kick of alcohol. The alcohol is not big, but it hardly needs to be any bigger than what it actually is in the percentage. Trifling. Worse than the Farmhouse Red Ale, for sure."
"Blue Moon's Mountain Abbey Ale (formerly Winter Abbey Ale) is surprisingly not as good as I remember it. I had this beer two years ago when it went by Winter, but now that they changed it call it Mountain, I'm left a tiny bit disappointed. The appearance is good - very strong and dark caramel color. The smell is truly superb - you can sense the hints of toffee and roasted malts. You can even taste them, distantly. But there's way to much carbonation, taking away from what would otherwise be a smooth mouthfeel. Overall, it's good but nothing as good as I remembered it a while ago."

"Overall - I prefer this one over the Blue Moon Gingerbread Ale."

" The flavor has a malt presence up front but generally clean yeast flavor with a slight woody cinnamon-like taste with gentle herbal note w/ moderate caramel in the malt rounding out the taste. Overall this is an okay take on the style, not exceptional but okay if you are in the mood for a brown ale."
""
""
""
"Medium brown pour with an open light tan head that dissipates quickly with no lacing. Smell is almost nonexistent. Traces of caramel and nut a bit of cracker. Taste follows this recipe. Light biscuit, caramel and a hint if nuttiness. Light body. In its entirety the light body and rather nondescript flavor give this a watery quality. I don't know what part if this is 'Abbey'. It's drinkable but not something I'd ever seek out."
""
"O: While I enjoyed the beer and won't have any trouble finishing the six pack, I don't think I would buy it again."
""
""
"On a side note, I am a bit disappointed they departed from their usual ""Winter Abby Ale"" (dubble), which I always felt was a nice 'light' version of an Abby Aleâ€”and instead went to this brown ale as their current (2013) winter style."
