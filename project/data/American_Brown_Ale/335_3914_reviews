"It's just ok. Wouldn't get it again. If it was offered to me at a friend's house, I'd accept if there wasn't any others available."

"This is not a terrible beer, but nothing special either. There is something off about the taste that I don't particularly like."
"Really didn't care for the tobacco notes I got in this."

"Sweet chocolate aroma. Nice level of carbonation. This has a sweet chocolate undertone. The flavor gives way to a nice bread like finish. Molasses and nut flavors."
"Never really cared for many Browns at all.  This is good!  Good flavor, good substance, good brown goes down easily.  Best brown ale I have ever had!  Give it a go."
"Poured a dark, dark brown with little head that doesn't last long and leaves no lacing. Smells of some brown sugar and a hint of chocolate. Has the taste of some sort of nut, hazelnut possibly, but goes to more of a dark chocolate taste as you drink. Feel is nice and warm and goes down smooth. Overall decent beer."
"Nice and malty, drinkable brown ale"

"O: [3.50] This beer had a pleasant flavor initially but somehow it faded as I kept going losing some punch.  That, in addition to the thin mouthfeel, hurt the overall scoring a bit.  It is still a decent beer.  I wouldn't turn it down - but I am not seeking it out either."
"Spicy and hoppy, this brown ale really warmed you up as the label would suggest. Nice dark chocolate and fig qualities. Almost christmasy. Very unique in it's flavor balance. It was a very pretty rich amber color as well."
"Pretty standard brown ale.  Nothing spectacular..."
"To me this is an average American Brown ale.  The taste hits all the right flavors.  There is milk chocolate, cocoa, and light tree bark.  The taste is somewhere between bitter and sweet as neither sensation really dominates.  This is not a bad beer, but not one I would seek out again either."

"Overall:  This is a very, very good brown ale.  Great, roasty, nutty flavors balanced beautifully by some brown sugar-like sweetness.  Definitely recommended."
""
""
""
"A bit nutty tasting and slightly sweet.  I don't really get much of a chocolate flavor despite this beer being brewed with chocolate.  The mouth feel is surprising light.  Overall, just OK."

"If there is snow outside your home. Then relaxing and drinking this beer makes total sense to this guy."

"Awesome - just how a brown ale should be!"
""
"Pours a very deep chocolate brown with nice head that quickly diminishes. Lacing is minimal. Aroma is strong of malts and light in chocolate. Taste is sweet, malty, with touches of light hops and roasted coffee. Mouthfeel is nice, cool, slightly thick going down. Overall, a nicely balanced brown ale at just the right strength and feel....."

"O: I enjoyed this beer more than I thought I would and was pleasantly surprised by the roastiness to the flavors. Really nice winter beer and I would likely grab this one again."

"O: very enjoyable;  I would have liked the hops to be more present, in aroma, flavor, and bitterness;"
""
"very tasty beer, was pleasantly surprised after seeing it only has a good rating"
"Nice full bodied ale"
""
"Chocolatey, light roast, and a fairly bitter finish. On the sweet side, but I really enjoyed the coffee character. There's just a touch of acrid notes."
"I gotta say they got the toastiness of this brew to match up nicely with the name and label. I really do like the malts here but something spicy and fruity from the yeast clashes just a bit on my palate. Chocolate and smoke do good deeds though. Impressive looks too."
""
"Overall:  Pretty nice easy drinking and flavorful brown ale.  Another good brew from these guys."
""
""
"This is better than expected. I drank an Imperial Stout before this and it holds up in the flavor department!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Dark brown in color with minimal light penetrating it.  A fingernail of beige head covers the majority of the top.  Aroma is very sweet dark malt to the point of being cloying.  The taste is overwhelmingly sweet dark malt with a light,smoky note.  The mouth is thick and oily.  Not a typical brown ale by any stretch of imagination."

"A solid, if unspectacular, brown ale."

"The drill is becoming a familiar one by now - pop the cap, heavy pour, sit back as the pseudo-cascade takes place, record results thereof. This time, the two-plus fingers of head were a dense, light-brown with good retention. I was reminded of the top of a coffee or mocha ice cream cone. Nose definitely gave off raisin and a smoky roastiness, hence their suggestion for smoked cheeses. Color was mahogany (SRM = > 22, < 27) with NE-quality clarity. Mouthfeel was creamy and the taste was chocolaty with raisins and smoke. It was like a Cadbury Fruit and Nut chocolate bar. Finish was semi-sweet, with the roasted malt offsetting the chocolatiness and the fruitiness. This was one that need not be thought of a a seasonal, but it would have been nice to have paired it with some of their suggestions. Maybe next time ..."

"Overall: Not bad, a solid, if unimpressive, brown winter ale."
"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, bottled on 9/24/2013. Pours very hazy deep reddish brown color with a 2 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, toffee, chocolate, cocoa, toast, biscuit, nuttiness, floral, light roast, and toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/toasted malt notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, toffee, cocoa, chocolate, toast, biscuit, nuttiness, floral, light roast, and toasted earthiness. Slight roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, cocoa, chocolate, nuttiness, biscuit, toast, light roast, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance, complexity, and robustness of dark/toasted malt flavors; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy and smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice brown ale! All around good balance, robustness, and complexity of malt flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"O: definitely my favorite winter seasonal so far. Fits perfectly with the season and as far as brown ales go - this can't be beat. Vastly underrated. Resembles a porter without as much roasted malts. New holland killed it with this one."

"Translucent, chocolate color with descent head on the pour. Fairly weak retention but followed by some lacing on the glass. Non-specific grainy aroma. Flavor of wheat bread, maple sweetness, dark fruits, earthy hops with descent balance. Medium bodied and well carbonated, smooth feel with some grainy texture. Descent brown ale. Par for the course."

"Great brown ale that is very tasty. Aroma has dark chocolate and coffee notes that are something less common in the beers i tend to drink. The caramel malts are very noticeable on the first few tastes of beer. The creamy mouthfeel will coat your tongue. very long after taste that is balanced and pleasant. The brown ale is best served with heavier foods.s"
"Served on tap in a 16oz beer glass. Great brown ale very tasty. Aroma in wonderful with deep, rich dark chocolate and coffee notes. Dark brown color with dark tan frothy head. Caramel malts come shining through on the first taste. Creamy, full mouthfeel that coats the tongue. The beer has a lasting sweet, balanced flavor that is very pleasant. The brown le is great enjoyed with red meats and heavier foods."

"This is one of my favorite brown ales available. It's more of a winter brown with the roasted notes, but it can be enjoyed in the summer too. I would drink it on hot days but warm nights by the fire are perfect."

"This by far is my favorite, has a smooth taste and easy to drink. I tried this in Holland MI and have been buying this one ever since. My only complaint is I get to full on them to fast. If you want a great beer buy this one. Really enjoy this beer and keep returning to it."
""
"O -- A good winter beer for warming up after too long in the elements. Goes down pretty smooth, but the hotness from the alcohol can fatigue the palate."
""
"O - I was very impressed with this offering by New Holland. I'm partial to porters, stouts, and browns. Smuttynose Old Dog Brown is the best American Brown made in my opinion, but this isn't all that far behind. Could definitely see looking for this one in the future."

"Brilliant mahogany-brown pour with a 2 inch, creamy, tan head. Spicy, dried fruit and malty nose. Medium body. Distinctive lacing. Balanced sweetness, spice, toasted bread and a faint sour note on the palate. Pleasant lingering with bitter notes towards the finish."

"O: Good brown, make sure to let it warm up a bit. Not overly unique."
""
""
"I love brown ales and this one is very nice. It would be good with a western burger."
"This is a decent brown ale. It doesn't have anything that separates it from the crowd, but it is brewed to style and is easily drinkable. If you're looking for an unoffensive, solid brown ale, then this is it. If you're looking for something more, you should look elsewhere. I'm glad I tried it once, but I won't be seeking it out again."

""

"Overall: A decent abv (6.2%) makes this a useful as well as enjoyable brew; the label is befitting its proper setting for consumption. I am not a fan of raisins per se, but I can be persuaded by the roasted atmosphere of this profile. This is the only bottle I purchased--I built my own winter six at Shop-Rite--but I would revisit this at a later date."

"Overall – A rather tasty and moderately sweet brown ale with a smooth feel and a good drinkability. Quite a nice one to try if you get a chance."
"Overall: This is a fantastic brown ale, one of the best beers I’ve tried in a while…the creamy, malt flavor isn’t exotic by any means, but works so well here…it’s not overly hoppy or bitter, just balanced superbly…the phrase, “drinkable” doesn’t do this ale justice, I could easily drink 3 or 4 of these in a sitting and be very happy…there is no sign of the 6.8% ABV in the flavor, I’m expecting this to sneak up on me…absolutely nothing missing from this brew, I couldn’t recommend it more…go get a six pack and you’ll thank me later…(5/5)"

"Big thanks goes out to Mississipping and StayWhatYouAre2’s dad for sharing this one at a recent tasting! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller taster flute. Poured red-brown with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, nutty, toasted malt, and caramel. The flavor was of sweet malt, powdered chocolate, milk chocolate, and nutty. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. I had never heard of this brew before until I saw it this night. So I really didn’t know what to expect at all. What I found actually wasn’t too bad for the style. A lot of the right components were present, but it was a little too sweet with the chocolate aspect going on in the flavor to stand out in the style. If that was toned back slightly it could have been a pretty good brew. Worth your time trying if you get the opportunity to do so."
"I think this could be a session beer (even at 6+ %) as long as it is a short session... Well done!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not a big beer at all. Though hardy enough, with a great toasted warm malt flavor to make it perfect to put several back during the winter months. A very under rated brewery that makes another solid beer. Something I would recommend."
""
""
""
"Fans of brown ales this one should work for you."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- pretty good, yet different for its style. I prefer bit more nutty/caramel and a little less earthy-smokeyness but a nice change of pace from say an Ellie's Brown Ale"
""
"Overall: A very drinkable yet average version of a brown ale. Nothing bad about it, but not as good as I usually expect from New Holland. But, for the price, it was worth it, and a good brown ale to pair with some food or for a lazy evening."
""
""
""
""
"Solid brown ale, fairly dry throughout."
""
""
"Overall: A solid, soundly malty brown ale for the colder months."

"Smooth, slightly drying with a mild warming from the alcohol bloom. Medium plus body with light, gentle effervescence. This is better than Newcastle for certain and I like some Newk."
""
""
"That being said - this is a nice beer, just not something I'd like to have everyday."
"O - Overall, not a bad brew, although the flavors could have been more pronounced. I'd have again."
"O: Overall its a stand up brown ale, it wasn't anything totally out of the ordinary but it's pretty damn good, wouldn't mind having another but I only had one. =["
""

""
""
""
""
""
"O - Brown ale closer to a porter, which works for me."
""
"Good news, it doesn't taste like cola! I get lightly burnt caramel, molases, and nice robust malt flavors. Moderately carbonated and a medium body, it is easy to drink, I just wish it was a better experience overall."

"Pretty good brown ale here, sure to compliment a cold winter day very nicely."

"First beer by New Holland and I’m impressed. I’m enjoying this quite a bit, and I really don’t care much for brown ales."
"It hides a bit of malty alcohol well under the hops. Not too sweet. It might be nice to have a bunch of these some time. They are very drinkable and I would buy it again."

"Pours a medium brown with a medium sized head. Nice lacing on the surface. Smell is toasted malt some chocolate notes also. Mellow sweet chocolately flavor. Low bitterness. Well rounded balanced flavor throughout. Great medium to full-bodied and and well carbonated mouthfeel. Overall quite pleasant. I think this is a nice wintery brown ale. Usually I prefer a more bitter American brown but I like this still."
"Overall, a decent beer but not what I was expecting from a brown ale. Would be a good cold weather beer."
"Overall: A touch watery overall which is often the downfall of many in this genre. Not very memorable or unique in any way."
"This may be my first go around with New Holland. I enjoyed this and will look for other offerings from New Holland. I wish there were a bit more body with this one, but overall pretty good."
""
""

""

"This beer pours a clear, dark brown with ruby highlights, no head or lacing. It's aroma is nutty with caramel and spice and a hint of toast. The flavor leads with mild coffee and molasses followed by cinnamon, Coke, and anise notes with a mild hop kick as it warms, very complex. The mouthfeel is medium. New Holland Cabin Fever Brown Ale is a good brew, recommended."
"This brown pours black with red tints all around, a modest one finger head. Not a strong scent but it matches the taste rather well. The taste of this brew has some chocolate notes and earthy notes. Caramel flavor and feel, also its a very silky felling beer and a relatively easy drinker. Nothing too special here to be honest but worth a try."
"O: Nice offering, but could be more robust. Good for a couple."
""
""
""
"O- A pretty enjoyable brown ale that drinks nicely. Definitely nice to see something a little different for a winter seasonal."

"O: Overall an ok flavor. It seems to fit the parameters of requirements per style, but just didn’t seem all that exciting to drink. A bit bigger then an ideal session brown, but not quite as robust as a big brown. Unlikely revist with so many better examples available."
"One of my favorite Brown Ales. Cabin Fever is the quintessential winter brown. I am fortunate enough to get it at the brewery, however, in a bottle is pretty close to the tap. It has a fantastic malty flavor and aroma and finishes cleanly with a great malt aftertaste. If you are forced to drink one brown ale the rest of your life, this would be a fantastic choice!"
""
"D- This is a nice beer that might not adhere to a specific style well but is a nice in between of a more roasty porter and a sweeter brown."
""
""
""
"O: Solid but a bit thin."
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, the beer was dark in color with a slight tint of red. The immediate nose of the beer was that of dark dried fruit and raisin. The taste of this beer is pretty accurately described on the bottle. In itself, that is somewhat unusual. The raisin and rye flavors are very evident, and the raisin flavor is quite tolerable. I was concerned that the flavors would bring a grainy sensation, but this was not the case. The flavors changed in the aftertaste to a molasses and slightly nutty flavor. As a brown ale, it is smooth with certain mild hints of sourness. I heard some negative and positive things about this beer so I was pleasantly surprised."
"O: I don't know if the keg was almost gone but this beer wasn't even close to how good it was in a bottle."
""
""
""
"The aromas don’t set you up for how complex this brew is. It starts off almost like a chocolate bock, but then the roasted and smoked malt sneak in with a touch of dark caramel. The liberal use of rye adds nice texture and flavor. The hops round out the creamy mouthfeel with a strong earthiness. And the lacing is like a coat of snow on top of a cabin deep in the woods."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I thought this was a good and solid American Brown Ale. This Brown Ale had much more roast then most Brown Ales, which made it more fitting for it's winter release but I feel like some additional hops in the flavor and the aroma would help make this beer more balanced and less one note. This beer has good drinkability, I could drink two or three of these in a sitting, it went down smooth and had enough flavor to hold my attention. What I liked most about this beer was the appearance and the taste, this beer looked real nice and the flavor stuck out from most Brown Ales due to it's heavy roast which I liked and I thought was fitting. What I liked least about this beer was the lack of hops in the flavor and aroma, it needed about twice as much hops in both to stand up to all those roasty malts. I would buy this beer again when looking for a roasty Brown Ale for the winter season. I recommend giving this beer a try, it's not the most complex Brown Ale, but the roast lends a nice flavor that makes it stick out a little. I was glad I got a chance to try this one and I think it is a pretty fitting American Brown Ale for those cold Michigan winter nights. New Holland comes through with another solid beer, keep up the good work guys."
""
"M: Medium body with a creamy texture. Sweet to bitter with a dry finish. Nice characters."
""
""
"Nice brown with good character."
""
""
"Another Michigan beer, let's see how this American Brown weighs in with my favorites. Pours a very nice velvet texture with a brown ruby highlighted huee with a big khaki tan head forming thick. Fine speckled lacing scattered sporadically. Aroma has a nice fruity roasted malt character going on, slightly nutty with some hints of dark chocolate. A touch of alcohol in both the nose and the palate. Flavor is a bit astringent with alcohol and dark roasted malts bring out a hint of raisin and mild dark chocolate notes. Finishes dry with some herbal hop finish, maybe a hint of pine. Mouthfeel is medium bodied moderate carbonation with a fittingly dry finish not overly sweet enough hops and alcohol to balance out the malt sweetness. Overall maybe one of the better beers out of their seasonals up in New Holland, I'm typically not crazy about their beers but this isn't half bad."
""
""
""
""
"Overall Impression- Expected more from this beer but its a hit or miss from New Holland... I enjoyed the hell out of their Mad Hatter Series (Black, Rye, Double, etc.) but a very good brown ale here. Would not steer anyone from this one but I will be venturing out and enjoying many more Brown ales to come."
"Overall this is a very tasty brown ale. There are lots of flavors and I really enjoy the smoothness of it as well. It pretty to look at but for me lacked in the aroma department. I would buy this again."
""
""
"I ended up liking this more than I thought I would after the look and smell. The sweetness ends just before becoming cloying, with the roasty notes and hops providing a good balance."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This has good drinkability. The flavor is really nice, and I could easily have a few of these in a night. Overall, I think this is a really nie beer and a good representation of the style. I recommend trying this one out. I would buy it again."
"O: Overall it's a bit better than average. I felt that the smell was lacking, and I've had a lot of other brown ales (American or not) that have more flavor. It still tastes very good. I would drink it again, but I probably wouldn't pick it as my ""go to"" for brown ales."
"Growler fill from GBX. Dark mahogany, rich brown color with a small 1 finger off white/tan head. Spotty lacing at best. Very small on the nose with some carmel notes and a little nutty. Was wanting a bigger hit with the aroma. Taste was similar to the nose, but this is where it came up a little short. Does not have that complex brown malty, nutty taste I like in a ABA. It does go down smooth for 6+% ABV, but a little weak on the taste. Feel is okay for a brown. A bit of cream and some carbonation with a very small sting of hops on the tongue. Overall- Not a bad brown, but not spectacular. Like how smooth it is and the limited hops profile. Was wanting a bigger taste and more complexity. Wouldn't turn one down, but just okay for an ABA-"
"Overall it's not a really complex beer, but it is rich. Worth trying."
""
"D: Excellent Winter beer , very smooth and HIGHLY drinkable. This is the perfect beer for a cold winters night. Well worth seeking out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I like this one. It's a decent brown that, as the name says, hits the target of being a wintery beer. The roast notes are prevalent but not overpowering, and the spicing steers away from the ""warmer"" category as well as the sugary sweetness of a baked good. More of a sweetened bread than a gingerbread man, as far as the season goes."
""
""
"So so, not fantastic and certainly not the best from New Holland, but not totally disappointing either. Hurt mostly by its bland taste. Wouldn't turn my nose up at it but probably wouldn't seek it out again in the future either."
""
"O: This is very boring, I wish I'd bought a Newcastle instead, and yes I mean that. This beer brings nothing to the table and will be forgotten."
""
""
"O: Not bad. Basically, a higher alcohol brown ale for the winter season. Appearance was descent. Nose and taste were a bit mild. Mouthfeel was pretty good. Overall, not bad, but not great."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is slick and creamy with a subtle carbonation. Cabin fever is a simple, easy drinking brew that you can stick with all night. It's nothing to slouch at but there are better browns out there. Well worth trying if you see it."
""
"Overall: a good beer, not one i will revisit often but enjoyable"
"Overall: I am not sure exactly what to make of this beer. It has a few nice flavors, but with each sip I like it a little bit less. Off flavor"
"O - A nicely balanced brew, shows some dryness on the finish which I always like"
""
""
""
"Overall, a smooth, decadent beer that is perfect for a cold night."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Pretty much as expected for a Brown Ale that has an elevated alcohol content. However, the finishing hops don't mesh with the malts and the medicinal aftertaste is a major issue. Decent."
"A very full bodied and flavorful brwon ale. I would definitely buy again. Not a favorite, but a nice change of pace for me."
"o - pretty good, but not great in any regard. i remember not liking this the first time i tried it, but it's growing on me. still, i can think of a half dozen other examples of the style i would pick over this one."
"This beer pours a clear brown color. The head is absolutely none existent. The aroma is of molasses, nougat, and toffee. The taste is of dull caramel with some not so pleasant astringency. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with almost no carbonation, and a oily texture. Overall, this is a disappointing beer."
"A very good drinking experience with a deep nutty and malty flavor and a great, frothy mouthfeel.Like many New Holland beers it starts out muted and then delivers more action the farther in you get. Typical New Holland gravity. But at the end of the day I felt like I was drinking a porter, not entirely sure New Holland hit the mark in making a brown ale. No matter, a really good beer, and since some of the NH beers I've had of late have been a bit blase, a good turn for NH."
"Mouthfeel is thin and bland. This really isn't very good. There was no head to speak of, little to no carbonation, a sour taste, and thin watery feeling."
"This poured out as a deep brown color, it had some nice looking red highlights in there. The head was tan and had a pretty good retention to it. The smell of the beer has some spiciness to it along with a soft roasted aroma and dark fruits. The taste is a little sweet like brown sugar upfront that fades into a spicy aftertaste with some nutty fruit flavors mixed in. The mouthfeel was moderate, Nothing too heavy or too light. There was a good carbonation to the beer as well. Overall I find this beer to be pretty good, I'd drink it again for sure."
"Pours a very dark mahogoney with a fairly slight head. Smells rich and chocolatey with some nice raisiny notes and malt, without being overly sweet. Tastes even a bit better- deeply satisfying with notes of bitter chocolate, toasty malt, and a nice bitter- almost tannic- finish. Fairly full in the mouth, but both creamy and snappy. I wasn't expecting all that much- a delicious surprise."
"The beer is pretty easy to drink and has held up well for being two years old and only 6.0% ish ABV. I bet it is cleaner fresh, but still enjoy this aged version too."
"O: The beer is very easy to drink and goes down smoothly."
"12 oz. bottle with no freshness date. Pours like a porter - off-black with a tan collar, and light carbonation that leaves a bit of lacing. Smells of light roast coffee and milk chocolate, sweet caramel, licorice and a dash of aged malt. Well-integrated and refined, but it's downhill from here. Tastes roasty, lactic and acidic, with coffee and a bit of hops. The roast and the acid clash quite offensively, and it ends bitter. Thin body, moderate carbonation and short finish. This is very hard to drink. It looked and smelled so good, but it ended up in the drain. I would love to try a proper one."
"O: Overall, this was a pretty bad beer. Far too acidic and no real brown ale flavors to it."
"Drinks real nice. I could down a few of these with a hearty well-balanced meal - turkey with gravy, dark green vegetable, perhaps sweet potato, and a big hunk of crusty bread."
"This is a rich and heavy brown beer that is well labeled. The snowed in cabin on the label really fits this beer. It has a rich and heavy character and strong caramel flavor that fits nice on a cold evening. I really enjoyed it but certainly wouldn't pick it up in the summer. The color is a dynamic mahogany with a half finger head and a creamy finish. The smell is sweet and the sweetness carries through in the rich flavor. Feels great on the pallet and drinks very smooth."
"Poured vigorously to form a tall tan head that lingered for awhile till subsiding to cover a mahogany brew. Some lacing. Grains, caramel, and touch of rye spiciness in the aroma. Initial light smoke followed by caramel/raisin sweetness and roasted grain flavor. Finishes with a slightly acidic blended bitterness and a short duration of dryness. Medium body, nice texture, soft carbonation create a pleasant experience."
"Drinkability: I'm sorry, but between the smell and taste (unbalanced, strong in alcohol and malts but not hops), I would have to rate this low. Now I'm no hophead, and I prefer maltier beers, but something about this one is just off. After a while, you'll wonder if there's ever an end to the sweetness. The aftertaste that lingers just reminds me of how disappointing the smell and taste of this beer is. It makes me *not* want to have any more. I will probably pass on this one if I see it again. Too bad, because I really like brown ales."
"Pours a deep amber to brown in color, with a light tan head. In the aroma, a small roast and some faint spices. In the taste, spices, cinnamon stands out, and a small roast. A spice bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry spice and malt in the aftertaste, Just a mellow brown ale with some spices."
"drinks okay. a bit too sweet with some aspects not quite meshing particularly well. not bad, not great. kind of forgettable, but not one I'd turn down, either."
"From winter brew tasting notes (2010): This brown ale poured an almost black colour with a big, creamy, tan coloured head. to the nose there are scents of molassass, ripe fruit, coffee and roasty caramel. First swig was full flavoured with a slightly burnt sweet malt flavour, nutty, molassass and slightly sweet. finish was roasty with sweet roasted malt flavours lasting but something was lacking from this brown ale."
"The flavor isn't quite complete in my opinion, but the beer is still pretty good. The flavor isn't very complex and all other aspects are relatively average. Worth a look but I doubt there will be many repeat buyers."
"D: This was not an impressive beer. None of the scent or flavor elements were very good. The body was ok, but drinkability suffered from my lack of general interest in finishing the beer. There are much better brown ales and winter seasonals out there. Not recommended."
"Medium bodied and not very robust or roasty with sweet caramel malt and hints of rye and toffee. Sweeter than expected with dark fruit notes, notably raisin, plum and grape."
"PASS"
"Medium body, with a great creamy feel. Lower carbonation. Pretty easy to drink, although I think the spicy and earthyness detracts a bit for me."
"Dark brown w/amber highlights. Beige one finger head. Smells of caramel with some dried fruit. A little scared of the metalic smell. Sweet up front with some dryness in the finish. Glad to see no metalic taste what so ever. Tastes of dryfruit, coffee, tofee and chocolate. Roasty malts with a mild smoke not unlike some porters. Carbonation is adaquate. Surprisingly light to med body. After a bad experience w/ New Holland's Ichabod the brewery has redeemed themselves with this one in my opinion. I could see this easily being the brown that I compare all other browns to."
"2.5 D: I'll pass on this if I ever see it again. Plenty of problems without a lot done right."
"A nice example of the style but nothing I'd go out of my way to get again... unless it was on cask. I bet this would taste fantastic on cask."
"Despite this being a bit of a ho-hum brown, it is very drinkable and I felt it was quite solid. While I can understand some wanting something more robust, or not enjoying the buttery aspect of the beer, to me it was a well made offering."
"D: I don't find anything objectionable about this beer, but nor do I find anything special about it. It doesn't sate my thirst for beer, it just leaves me wanting a good brown ale. Or stout. Or porter. Or really anything to round out the flavor."
"Black body with red edges with very little off-white head. Sweet aroma of chocolate, cream, slight roast, butter notes. Chocolate, roast, diacetyl, some cola, and slight gingerbread. Medium carbonation and body. A sweet brew with some roast characteristics."
"D: pretty damn tasty, and probably the first brown ale I have truly enjoyed. To my palate it is like a stout ""lite."" I would definitely get this again."
"A solid, as expected body to this brew. Somewhere past medium, but not quite as thick as a stout. Crosses over into the realms of a porter. The malts-to-hops ratio, with the malts as the victor, renders this a highly drinkable option, and, for sure, I could see myself drinking a few of these while my wife imbibes hot cocoa in a cabin in the woods surrounded by the stark cold of winter. Cheers!"
"This beer pours a rich dark brown, with a very small amount of off white head. The smell is quite good consisting of lightly roasted malt primarily with a nice breadiness as well. The taste is also of roasted malts and light bread flavors, but with a very faint citrus aftertaste. The mouthfeel is smooth, but not too light for the style. This quite a drinkable beverage, especially in the winter season. Overall, I find this quite an enjoyable drink."
"When I'm in the mood for a brown ale, I definitely give two Schlitz about Cabin Fever."
"drinkability: Yes, I can sit by the fire all night in my cabin sipping these. It is not a remarkable beer, but is a very fine example of a brown ale."
"D - Well it wasn't as bad as some said. A definite sipper but kind of a weird offering from New Holland. If I were this company I would add spices and call it a winter warmer than an old ale (brown ale)"
"Solid beer, there are better examples of this style out there but this is not one I'll turn down if offered it again."
"Drinkability: Drinkable with a smile."
"Poured into a standard pint a medium to dark brown with a weel defined half finger head that held well,aromas I picked up were some light brown sugar and a tinge of roast.Flavors started out with a bit of dark fruit and brown sugar but a sour note came out of nowhere and hijacked the palate,really an unpleasant finish to a nice start.I always hope to really like beer from the breweries I came to enjoy as a craft beer novice,most of wich are from Michigan,but this just wasnt that great."
"Cabin Fever Ale is not my favorite Brown Ale, however it is a solid offering from New Holland - sure worth a try if you enjoy the style."
"Medium mouthfeel and a lingering toasted character in the aftertaste. Overall this is a very pleasing brown ale."
"A brown ale for your holiday seasonal? A gutsy move by a brewer competing against a sea of hopped-up, spiced-up, roasted-up warmers and strong ales. Overall, a worthy contender. Nice roasted malt, with big flavor but not beyond the style. Hops stand out enough to qualify for listing in the American-ized incarnation of the brown ale. Overall, a nicely substantial example of the style."
"The brown ale poured to an almost black color with a full-scale, creamy, tan head. There are scents of roasted malts, molasses, ripe fruit, coffee and caramel. First drink was full flavored with a slightly burnt sweet malt flavor. It is nutty and slightly sweet. It is very easy to drink and very fresh."
"Mouthfeel was very big, especially for a brown ale. If I were to have this blindfolded I might even think this was a porter. Huge brown ale that would definately be classified as a ""sipper""."
"D. This is a very drinkable beer that could easily down it or just sip on it. Seems to be a versatile beer when it comes to how you drink it. A few reviewers said they could taste the alcohol in it and gave drinkability a lower grade than I did since I couldn't taste the alcohol very well. I know it is there since it is 6.0% ABV according to the bottle. I did say the taste was balanced."
"Not hard to drink at all and you can easily drink more than one in a sitting."
"Drinkability: Noticeable alcohol in the aftertaste limits its drinkability somewhat, definitely a sipper. It's not a bad effort, just seems to be missing too many pieces for a really good brown ale."
"Overall ... an excellent example of a brown ale."
"D Drinkability was good, not really what I would expect from a Brown ale though. Very warming,"
"Pours a moderate caramel-brown color with a light tan head and not really any lacing. The nose is pretty nice with a good dose of chocolate malt as well as some caramel, toffee, and lightly-roasted brown malt. Flavor is a bit toasty with some caramel and bread. Medium body with good carbonation and a very slight roast character. Drinks pretty well; a nice fall sipper."
"A very good beer to drink in front of the fire...or the tv...or the computer....or ...."
"D- This was a ok beer that seemed like I would have to be in the mood to drink. Nice try for New Holland but a miss in the books for the time that I tried it. Nothing really bad about it but the aroma was muted and the flavor was so so at best."
"Cheers from New Jersey!!"
"Definitely a nice winter warmer and a great beer to pair with a bonfire and a cigar on a cold night."
"MD- It is an easy drinking beer, buit one dimensional and that is the roasted malt. This was the the May BOTM selection."
"12 ounce bottle poured into a Three Philosophers glass. Small, off-white head quickly dissipates. Aroma is of slightly toasted, nutty malt with a hint of some honey-like sweetness. Taste has a bit of coffee along with the roasted malts. Very smooth and pretty tasty brew. Can't really find any fault with the flavors, nice overall offering."
"Tasty but a bit more alcohol than expected."
"D: One of the better offerings from New Holland I've tried. Will definitely have another one soon."
"D: Very drinkable."
"D - I would say the drinkability is there but more than two of these and it might start getting too sweet for me...the mouthfeel is very nice and the flavors work well together"
"Pours a deep rich brown color with a tan colored head that dissipates quickly. The aroma is malty, sweet, nutty, and has notes iron and hard water. A sweet malty flavor overwhelms the taste profile. A bit earthy. The mouthfeel is heavy for an american brown ale, very heavy actually, but done nicely. Carbonation is light, drinkability decent. I enjoyed this offering from New Holland."
"Pours a nice clean/clear dark golden brown color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy tan head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, slight touch of smoke notes, slight toffee, and good dose of caramel. The taste is sweet, malty, alittle smokeyness, and caramel, and slight spiceyness. Medium body. Drinkable, a tasty brew, glad to have gotten a chance to try it."
"Poured a deep, almost mahogany red with a creamy head. Initial aroma of molasses and chocolate jockeys for position with a sweetness of chocolate or roasted sugar. At first glance, the beer looks very porter like not at all what you'd expect from brown ale. Taste is rather nutty and earthy, like perhaps chewing on a hickory branch, but also ha s a sweet sugar taste that blends in nicely and smoothes the earthiness. Lingering taste of a bit of floral from the hops, a bit of dark chocolate and a general sweetness not expected from Brown Ale. Finishes nice and crisp, not at all like what you would expect from such a high ABV. A pleasure very much."
"D - With an ABV of 6.5%, this is sort of like an ""imperial brown"" if there is such a thing, and as such it's got some great things going for it. This is a bit too sugary-syrupy IMO, and would benefit from maybe a little less chocolate-and-sugar notes. The finish and lingering notes, however, are excellent and despite a not-so-drinkable sugary-ness this is still a great beer!"
"Thanks to fryer and the 12 beers of xmas empire beer club exchange."
"Overall- Simple, clean, nothing complex."
"D - Pretty well done. Too many brown ales are one-dimensional, so I always love finding takes that add some depth to the style. This one has some nice complexity while still retaining the high level of drinkability that a brown should have."
"A nice malty, but with mild roast and light hop balance, winter brown!"
"A clear deep brown color pour with a medium thin white head that diminishes quickly. Sticky spots of lacing left , medium carbonation. Aroma of nuts , barley, baked bread crust and molasses along with a malty undertone. Flavor was very toasty , lots of nutty and caramel flavors ,brown shugar and dark fruit notes very balanced , lightly sweet , medium body , nice nutty finish with hints of rasins , very drinkable and a nice brew , New Holland has yet another nice offering here ."
"D- High but filling. A brown ale that explodes with flavor. This beer is not to be missed, a perfect winter beer."
"Pretty good drinkability...not as complex as I would like, but would buy again."
"D: Very enjoyable. Alcohol is a bit strong for anything more than a small quantity."
"D: An interesting offering from New Holland. Seems a bit like a barleywine blended with a lighter brown ale. The alcohol is a bit hot for something I would expect to be very subdued. Not something I would be prone to pick up again, but fun to try."
"Opening the bottle released a yeasty aroma. The beer poured very nicely, with a moderate foamy head. The beer is a deep red color, with very little cloudiness. Even after pouring, the aroma remains a bit yeasty, but this aroma had a minimal impact on the taste. The malt flavor is strongest, accented by mild hops, just about right for a brown ale. The malt is a bit chocolatey. Overall, the taste is on the bitter side. The feel in the mouth is quite bubbly."
"Deep mahogany body topped by a late-rising, parchment colored head. The head didn't form until well after the bottle was emptied. It then quickly fades to little more than a few scattered large bubbles around the edge of the glass. Aroma is almost all malt, heavy on the molasses and brown sugar. A touch of fresh bread in there a swell. Just a hint at herbal hop aromas intermingled with all the sweetness. Flavor pretty much follows the nose - blackstrap molasses, caramelized sugars, a touch of anise. The bitterness is almost disguised as carbonation - almost like carbonic acid rather than hop bitterness. But in the age of the over-the-top IPA (which I love) this is a great break from what has become the norm to some of us. Each successive sip reveal more layers of malt and sugar. Tastes like a really hearty beer. A little more body would have been great, but at cellar temps it may have gotten cloying if it had more presence in the body. Drinkability is very good, if you like malt. A very nice offering."
"Notes: Really thoroughly impressed with this beer from New Holland and they show again a great understanding of yet another beer style. Bravo!"
"Drinkability: this is an easy to quaff beer, but is not refreshing as some other brown ales. Worth picking this up for a cold winter day."
"D: Tasty beer, not filling, very smooth and goes down dangerously easy. This is one of the best brown ales that I've had."
"D- Slightly warming. Nice for a cold winter night."
"O: It's a brown ale for sure, but it's a complete miss for me. Drinkability is OK given that it's not too filling, but I wouldn't ever seek it out again. I don't see how this really qualifies as a winter warmer. The first real disappointment from New Holland for me but hey, we can't all be perfect right?"
"Mouthfeel is creamy..drinkability is high..I don't taste much alcohol, and it tastes pretty good. Kind of like a stout meeting a winter warmer."
"I'm enjoying this one alot, maybe it's the fact that it's 20 out and snowing, but this is making my night, a warming beer, that you can enjoy with some christmas deserts, and a warm fire. Nothing out of the ordinary or exception here, but a solid brew."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a deep brown with ruby highlights and a thin but solid tan-brown head. The nose is very apparent and is a mix of caramel, chocolate, burnt sugar and maybe a hint of dark fruit. The taste is similar but has more black patent in it than I had anticipated; the taste is slightly acrid as a result. Burnt coffee, bittersweet chocolate and molasses are present. Mouthfeel is full bodied with a thin but slightly viscous carbonation and a dry, alcohol-warming finish. Overall, a drinkable beer definitely excellent for a cold winter's night."
"Rich, malty, and tasty with no alcohol bite to be found. Man, was this a good brew on tap. I look forward to another pull of this bad boy."
"Cabin Fever is brown in color with red high lights. A half inch tan head doesn't last long. It has a very sweet, malty aroma and oddly, I get alcohol too, even though it is only 6.25 ABV. The taste is very sweet, chocolate covered caramels. The feel is medium bodied, but oily, with adequate carbonation. I found Fever a little rich to be highly drinkable, but the ABV was certainly low enough. It was almost too sweet, but I really enjoyed Cabin Fever and definitely plan on picking up a few more. A shame that it doesn't appear to be a good candidate for cellaring."
"drinkability is ok just for the fact the beer was just too damn sweet"
"D- I don't know how much of this stuff I would want to drink in quantity but I am somewhat enjoying the one I have in front of me now. I have friends that I am sure would love it"
"I can think of so many other brown ales I would much rather have. This was a major disappointment and almost a drainpour. It's going to be some time before I give this seasonal another chance."
"New Holland Cabin Fever is a delicious slightly too-sweet brown ale."
"D - A decent beer, but not terribly exciting."
"Taste-Creamy, nutty, chocolate notes-Easy drinking-A nice brown to have on hand as an every-day, go-to beer in the winter months-Nice."
"A good beer."
" cheers!"
"Overall, if they toned down the roasted malts a bit, fixed their diacteyl problem and got rid of that sourness this would be a nice brown ale. On the upside, I love the label!"
"(D)- Good flavor, but way too sugary for me; this seems to be New Hollands general trademark thus far in my experiences with their beers, particularly their high gravity line, but it came through in this one as well. Has a great brown ale core that could rank it up there in the style, but is overshadowed by all the sugar!"
"Rusty dark brown in color, think khaki head that doesnt want to stick around too long. Smell is of mild chocolate, mild coffee and a tart dark fruit (prune, black cherry) presence. Tastes like a brown ale - hints of chocolate, coffee, carmel and earth. Interesting dark fruit prsesence in the rear - prunes, dark cherry. Slightly tart finnish. Good medium body, chewey and earthy. Good brown ale with just enough to diferentiaite itself."
"The finish also had a pungent sourness from the cherry and blackberry scents that drowned everything else out. Maybe I got a bad batch? If this was the way it was intended to be, let me first say that I applaud New Holland for taking a normal brown ale base and aspiring to create a cherry porter, but at least forewarn me."
"Don't drink and review."
"This isn't my favorite brown ale, but it is a good one."
"D: Skip this one and seek out New Holland's Mad Hatter or Poet if you want a better idea of what this brewery is capable of. Glad I went with the single first for sure."
"Final Thought: It may have been a bad bottle but this beer has the right ingredients but lacked the consistency of a good quality brew."
"D: Let me start by saying that I like this beer. It is one of the fullest flavored brown ales that I have had the pleasure of drinking. New Holland scores big with this winter seasonal."
"Had this beer with dinner (stuffed pepper soup). It poured a beautiful rich brown/red with a slight foamy light tan head that lasted about a minute. Smell was reminiscent of a dry red wine. Some strong fruity esters, plum and raisin come to mind. Chocolate undertones. It is quite sweet in front but the sweetness fades quickly and dries in the mouth(again much like a Cabernet Sauvignon). The back end is diacetyl and fairly bitter. Oddly enough, I had some fresh parmesan cheese with dinner, and when paired with the cheese the beer was quite nice. I think this is a wine."
"The drink is light-medium in body, lightly carbonated, totally inoffensive and mellow."
"Came in a pint glass with a dark copper body and a two-finger white head that was foamy but quickly left. A dryer, roasted malt smell with some sweet malts like butterscotch and caramel that make an appearance but are minor. Not really a significant hop presence. Is a medium-boded beer that is smooth and creamy, but this one just didn't grab me. Had some sweet and roasted malts mix it up on the tongue, a little slick, but nothing amazing. Finishes clean with a hint of dryness and that's about it. Not a bland beer, but just a run-of-the-mill brown to be honest. Kind of shocked New Holland put out a ""weak"" beer (their ""weak"" is still miles ahead of a lot of other breweries), but if you really want a brown ale and there's nothing else on the menu then go for this."
"I have no idea what's going on with this stuff. Way too much buttery diacetyl - yuck."
"Really an interesting brown ale, not at all what I was expecting."
"Overall this is right in the middle of the road with browns. There's nothing that really sticks out as above average, though in the same vein nothing sticks out as less than average. Worth a shot if you're into browns."
"Very dark brown beer with a rapidly fading head.Aroma is malts and chocolate.Taste is chocolate and smoky malts.A decent beer that would go well with a BBQ due to it's smoky flavor.Overall pretty good and something that I would recommend and purchase again!!"
"D: Too sweet to be really drinkable. a good beer none the less."
"Bottle poured into a pint deep chocolate brown, clear with a thin head quickly fading. Smelled nutty & slightly burnt. This carried over into the taste of burnt nuts and burnt sugar. Flavors thin and riding an over abundance of carbonation. Left only a faint aftertaste of malt. Drinkable and appropriate for a cold Michigan weekend afternoon."
"New Holland is a better brewery than Cabin Fever Brown Ale would suggest. I'm not sure what went astray with this offering (diacetyl most likely), but I would much rather stock the cabin with something more substantial and more tasty. This is disappointing beer. Especially considering the source."
"Brown ales have been my least favorite of all styles - but this could be the first one I actually can say that I enjoyed enough to get a six of... aw heck, maybe a case."
"Drinkability: Depends on your constitution! Lots of flavor. How much can you endure?"
"Drinkability: For diacetyl lovers only, this beer just has a lot of flaws"
"I'm having this bottle side-by-side with Newcastle Brown so this should be a lot of fun. This pours a much darker brown than Newcastle with a medium tan head. Smells of darkened toast and rosted malts - very nice. Far more complex taste than Newcastle. This beer is very interesting. A strong roasted bitterness and almost sourness or tanginess that is very intriguing; bitter coffee finish. THe watery body is its biggest flaw but this is still a very drinkable beer. Very enjoyable."
"Aroma had vanilla and light touch of butterscotch. Color is deep, I mean deep, dark brown. Head retention was reasonable but died quickly. It was very light tan and thin laced. Texture was thick and hefty like taffy. I'd further say, the quafibility for me is in limited doses. This beer is great for the Vanilla Porter and sweet stout fans out there. Has just enough all spice to remind that it's a winter beer. You can tell it's the same guys who brew Red Tulip and Dragon's Milk. A little in love with the malts, boys? A suitable dark winter for those who don't enjoy the typical ""winter"" beers. It's fair to middlin', in my humble opinion as are most New Hollands. Too sweet and overly malty with no counter balance of dry tones that gives good to great beers their complexity."
"Cabin Fever's an okay beer, but it is a little disappointing. The strong caramel/toffee aspect of it is just a little too much for me. It really hinders the nose. There's a number of superior Brown Ales that are much more desireable. It's worth a try, but needs some work."
"Drinkability: Not a brew that I would actively seek out or even reach for if I saw it on the table. Many more winter seasonals that appeal to my palate."
" This has a week feel of alcohol to it and I'd swear it would make a good session had I not seen the 6.25% ABV. I don't really feel any toffee in this like some others do, but instead, I look at this as a less sticky and caramel-like version of Newcastle. It can warm ya up on a night like this but it's by no means a winter warmer. Instead, it's a mellow after-dinner beer perfect for those who just want to mellow out and not think about what they're drinking. A quietly solid offering from New Holland..."
"Pousrs mix of dark garnet and brown with a pretty quick head and some small, sluggish, sporadic bubbling. Nutty and toffee filled aroma with just a bit of bitter roasted malt. Very nutty and full of toffee, wuth maybe a splash of suagared and creamed coffee. Maybe a little too sweet. No discernable detection of hops. Velvety super sweet palate. Wintery sweet yes, but not all that sessionable. Although, the flavors are good, and they don't linger too long."
"I really enjoyed this brown ale from New Holland. A real pleasure to drink."
"Great mouthfeel. Almost full bodied and thick and chewy and slick. Perfect carbonation. Perhaps a little fruity and slightly sweet, but a really good beer. I am usually not a brown fan (english, anyway), but these american browns are starting to grow on me."
"My first beer from New Holland was also my first brown ale in quite some time. I'm glad I got both those things tonight, and will probably look for more of both despite being underwhelmed by this one."
"D - This has to be one of the best brown ales that I have had in some time. Great sweetness and nutty flavors."
"Dark ruby brown body. Just a skimming of brown cream on the surface. Lace is minimal. Aroma is thick and sweet. Caramel and fudge and toffee and nougat all balled into one. Taste is pretty sticky sweet. Big toffee and a little butterscotch. Also caramel and some wet cardboard. Lingering semblance of cloying. Viscous mouthfeel with cough syrup feel to it. It turned out better by the end of it than with my first sip. But still very average."
"Eric"
"D - Unusual tasting beer, not too heavy, not bad. Not my favorite from New Holland, but a well crafted beer nonetheless, just not my favorite genre."
"I would say this is one is average. It is tasty, I would probably drink it again but the flavors didn't feel entirely cohesive."
"Impressive effort for a brown ale, almost a session beer but it would be hard to only have one. Nice going!"
"Big disappointment, the worst I've had from New Holland. I won't ever grab this again. Avoid."
"D: This is a likable, drinkable beer, with a nice warming quality when you drink it. A good beer for the season."
"mouthfeel is slick and slightly creamy, robust flavors, one of my favorite new holland offerings!"
"D-It's a drinkabile beer. Enjoyable down to the last sip, but nothing that I will seek out in the future."
"As far as American browns go, I'll probably spend my money on a different brand in the future."
"An excellent and complex blend of flavors and textures, but the viscous, chewy mouthfeel, sometimes slightly cloying sweetness, and not-so-well-hidden alcohol presence hinder drinkability. Despite this ale's downfall as a session beer, it is certainly a nice, rich filler for a cold winter's night."
"An intriguing brown ale for sure. From the pour, you would swear you were looking at a glass of coke - the color is strikingly similar and the head dissipates to a cola-like set of bubbles. I get a lot of butterscotch on the nose of this one, intermingled with some slight metallic notes, and definitely some brown sugar/molasses. I'd say the body is medium-heavy, and the carbonation is plentiful, perhaps a little too much. I usually think of brown ales as having a smooth mouth feel. This one is a little rough given the amount of carbonation. The flavor is quite interesting - a lot more complexity than your average English Brown. I get raisins, figs, molasses, toffee, plus some herbal notes that mingle together pretty dynamically. I'd be interested to know what yeasts they are using here. Kind of reminds me of a recent trip I made to the Ommegang Brewery in NY where I tasted a couple beers made with wild yeasts. There are definitely some wild, estery notes in this brew. Not quite sure where this one fits categorically, but it's an interesting beer to try. Maybe not one of my favs, but certainly worth sampling. Give it a shot if you're looking for something different."
"D- This beer has some nice clean dark malt flavors to it but it is a bit thin and taste a bit like a porter that was diluted with water. The tartness was a bit bold for the rest of the malt flavors and it would be nice to taste some other flavors besides the mineral watery notes."
"Clean looking cola color, that is to say, not demonstrating those sticky bubbles on the side of the glass that most colas are guilty of, that and the one and a half finger head make all the difference in the world. Apart from its caramel color, its aroma is even more apparant, almost butterscotchy in aroma and mixed with a prety decent amout of grapefruity hops. Not like any brown ale I've ever encountered, this one is American through and through. Rich, roasted caramel malt dominate the opening and everything keeps getting sweeter from there, hops seem to fall of a little bit from the nose. Beer closes overly sweet and grainy, almost cloying, would be almost unbearable if not for the soda like carbonation that keeps the beer bubbling just above the tongue. Not something I'd really want to reach for again, reminds me a bit of Atwater's beers, maybe I got a bad bottle, but the rest in teh 12 pack seemed okay. Just a bit dissapointed here."
"Nothing particularly sensational, glad I only got two to sample."
" In its second year as NHBC's winter seasonal, Cabin fever is a strong choice among many winter varieties. Cabin Fever is preceded by Ichabod in the fall, Zoomer in the summer and Red Tulip in the spring; all of which available at The Beverage Company in Traverse City. Cabin Fever is rich and complex, just what a winter beer should be. So before you reach for that ordinary and ubiquitous ""New Castle Brown Ale", consider a beer that pushes the boundaries of beer and is made right here in Michigan."
"Drinkability- This is an extremely flavorful Brown Ale. It's fairly sweet for the style IMO with loads of specialty malts that really gives an enormous caramel note. I prefer my Browns a bit more on the nutty side but either way it was a nice change of pace."
"As noted, this beer is heavy on flavor, and is quite enjoyable. Not standout, but tasty. A tad much to be that drinkable."
"This Brown Ale is almost like a porter in aroma and flavor. But the lighter flavor and slightly thinner body makes it more of a robust Brown Ale. Recommended."
"full of flavor, including heavy raisin notes. hop flavor is limited, but each sip finishes with enough bitterness to keep the malt in check. to be honest the roast is subdued as well: the aroma belied a modest darkness of flavor. you know, there's a cola thing going on in there, too. not sure i like it, though"
"Mouthfeel: The carbonation gives it a really smooth mouth coating quality."
"Drinkability- Certainly a drinkable beer for a brown if not for anything else but for the sweety goodness contained within. At this point in the aging process it definitely needs to be served after dinner and not with dinner. Just a bit too sweet for that."
"Pours an ice cream fudge borwn with white head encasment. Malty smell, brought aggressive with toasting. Some chocolate malt, brown sugar, caramel. Some hop and aggressive carbonation workws as offset. Very malty taste. Medium mouthfeel. Some astringency in finish. Altogether so-so."
"Drinkability- A little warming but very nice and smooth for drinkability. Good for a session or a pint at the bar."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Smooth on the palate and creamy. The beer is medium bodied, and as afore mentioned it has a bit of a warming character. It goes down real easy, and I have no problem drinking this all night, this is one that I can see myself coming back to. All in all this is a nice beer, nothing really grand, but extremely enjoyable. I can see this appealing to alot of people, just something about it."
"Mahogany root beer brown with a solid cm of whipped, khaki head. Nose of molasses, cocoa, chocolate Twizzlers, faint vanilla, and caramel. Nice. Toasted malt and nuts. Roasted chocolate flavor fills in. Light peat and earthy licorice. Hints of vanilla and sasparilla. Moderate herbal hop bitterness gently glides in and brings a little balance. Some residual brown sugar sweetness. Medium-bodied, with a smooth, mouth-coating feel. A very nice beer from New Holland and a welcome addition to Michigan's winter seasonals."
"Great session beer,maybe a bit too sweet but im not counting that."
"D - Very drinkable. I would not mind having some of these on hand to help me with my cabin fever! A fully respectable American Brown."
"Morey's Bottom Line: Not a bad brown ale. A little thin for a winter release though. Also has a slight metallic taste that bothers me a little. I'd definitely drink this again, but I won't be seeking it out. Not as good as Samuel Smith's Nut Brown or Rogue Hazelnut (which would be better examples of a Brown Ale)."
"I was very anxious for this beer as I am a huge fan of New Holland, but this brown ale didn't blow my socks off. Nice color, foam dissipates quickly, smell is mostly absent if I am allowed to say that! Roasty with typical amount of bittering hops, probably too evenly balanced. It's like a moderate beer in a world of conservative and liberal beers. I've tried this a number of times both on draught and bottle, 2007/early 2008, and it's nice but not superb."
"Overall, a great example of the style. I'm finding I like brown ales the more of them I try, and this is no exception."
"Dark, but clear chestnut brown with a slight reddish hue. A light tan head makes a brief appearance. Smells of chocolate waft towards my nostrils, as do caramel and toasted malts. A definite nutty quality mingles in the nose as well. Light chocolate and roasted malts meet in the taste, along with some earthy nuts and a small amount of dark fruitiness (like two raisins worth). Not much carbonation to effect this medium bodied offering in anyway. It bit more balance and strength would lend nicely to this fairly average brown ale."
"The bottom line: A serviceable brown by New Holland, but nothing worth seeking out."
"D - Very drinkable. I could have one of these every day in the winter."
"Brown Ales are the style of beers that I often overlook. Then when I taste one like this, I ask myself 'why?'. The beer begins with a firm, malty plop in the glass with a deep brown color and tan head formation that would prove to withstand until the end. Aromas of chocolate malt, light roasting / toasting, a milk-sugar sweetness, and pine-ey hops all promise great things in flavor. The taste takes on the same characteristics as in the aroma, with emphasis on the chocolate and malty flavors and textures. An unexpected peat-ey flavor and aroma begins to take hold as the beer warms, giving hte beer a lot of complexity and flavor. The hops are not as agressive in the flavor as in the scent, but work well to balance the sweetness. Body is a bit higher than medium, but not heavy, relying on a creamy base to cary the flavors. Finishes with a long linger of chocolate and earthy-dirty character."
"Taste was decent for a brown ale, certinally drinkable. Nuts opf course were primary but lacked a strong nut taste which I look for in a brown ale. It tasted a little watered down to me though, but good for a little known brewer in Holland, Michigan."
"Drinkability - this is a decent beer, but it is somewhat tame and so I'd want something bolder after two or so, so to me it's not exactly sessionable."
"Had this at a pizza joint on-tap and I was quite happy to see it back after several years. Very rich amber color tending more towards brown then red. Not much of a head, surprisingly full nose of malty coffee. Wonderful malty chocolaty coffee taste, although malty, not overly sweet, making it extremely drinkable. It was served at a great temperature and the carbonation level was perfect. I had it out of a bottle several nights later not knowing what to expect, but it was pretty close to the on-tap version. I will definitely be keeping a six pack of these around during the next month or two."
"Good fall beer!"
"Overall- Very flavorful brown ale. Good cold weather, lower ABV option."
"Smooth, velvety, and mostly full-bodied. Low carbonation ups the syrupy sweetness a bit. A very solid beer none-the-less. Another fine creating from New Holland."
"D: Pretty good but I believe it could use a more assertive hop presence."
"The beers' only weakness, a touch thin and yet over-carbonated at the same time. Still, this is a winner from a rather uneven stable of beers from New Holland. I would absolutely revisit this. My only concern is how this came to be listed as a red ale; it's fucking brown!?!"
"Pretty good now, but I wouldn't recommend storing this one away. For an experiment, save a bottle and taste it in 6 months. It will taste like a bowl full of pennies soaked in vinegar, guaranteed."
"Pours a dark red with virtually no head. Smell is strong with nutty roasted malts aromas. Taste is sweet and alcohol content seems high. Bitterness and carbonation are moderate. Mouthfeel is extremely smooth with a slightly bitter aftertaste. Except for the lackluster appearance this is an exceptional beer. I defiantly have to pick this up again."
"Nice medium body with a great bitterness. Seems to stimulate every small bit of my palate. The growler will probably go down quick."
"Delicious!"
"Pour was a hazy copper color with an airy light yellow head that fades. Aroma is of a husky grainy sweetness with rye, floral hops are there, and there's a bit of light fruits in the background. Flavor gives me more sweet malts upfront with caramela and toffee. Rye is definitely the base of this beer and provides ample backbone. Hops are abundant but not overpowering. They begin fruity like red delicious apples then turn more floral then spicy and finally finish bitter. Body is decent, not real big but really makes this beer drinkable. Went great with the pizza. This is definitely a beer I think they should bottle. I liken it to a slightly fruitier, slightly less intense Founder's Red Rye. Almost ESBish. I'd like this on cask."
"Drinkability is very solid. Not outstanding but a solid seession brew that kind of grows on you."
"This really reminds me of an ESB. Very malty and and a lot of grapefruity hops in the aroma and character. Despite the dark reddish-brown color of the beer and the light reddish-tan of the head, this beer's flavor is surprisingly light Yes, it definitely malty but with the level of hops in the profile, it seems lighter that you'd expect. Not a bad beer."
