"O: A good brown ale. Really easy drinking and with enough complexity to warrant revisiting."
""
"This beer has a dark brown color body with a thin tan head. The smell has a roasty malt and hop to it smell to it. The taste has a maltness upfront and then a nice hop backbone. The hop very nice for a brown ale. Mouthfeel is smooth and overall very tasty for a brown ale."
""
"M: perfectly bubbly and biting. Smooth and drinkable."

"Overall: A muddled hop-forward brown ale that, even with the addition of extra hops, still feels bland and lifeless."

"The Brownstone from Sixpoint was a nice beer I tried at the local Tap House & Grill. The beer poured a clear brownish amber with 1/2 finger thick white head that left a nice lacing. The smell was faint but carried biscuit and malt. The taste was a smooth well balanced Brown that was easily sessionable. The mouthfeel was medium in body with smooth carbonation. Overall this was a good brown and worth a try."
"a thanks to the legendary woodychandler for this beer. Poured from a 16 oz. can. Has an amber color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts, some caramel. Taste is well balanced malts and hops, some caramel, tasty and easy drinking. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is an enjoyable and solid beer."

"Overall this one could be used to define the American Brown Ale. Not off the wall with flavor or complexity but very well rounded and enjoyable to drink."
"O - Tasty, not overpowering in any way but theres a nice balance of several (relatively) strong flavors. Very refreshing, fantastic appearence. Very good overall"
""
""
"M- feels great in my mouth. Very sessionable. Does not wreck my palete. Overall an awesome brown ale!"
"While an impressive looking pint, Brownstone doesn't live up to the promise of its appearance. It's a good brown ale but doesn't really separate itself from the pack."
"I've had 3 out of the 4-pack now, and one thing I will say for it is that it went well with Sriracha on food."

"A little bland in the flavor arena, but very easy drinking."
"Pours chestnut brown, good 1/4 inch white foam. Fluffy on top. Malty caramel nose. Vanilla too. Rich malty refreshing taste. Light bitter hop in the close. Subtle balanced sweetness. Halfway between a pale and a brown. Flavorful. Really good."
""
"Ruby caramel tinted mahogany brown body with a fine bubbled cream colored head, nice textured lacing around the sides of my glass. Aroma has some chlorophyll green quality mild citrus leafy tobacco notes, with caramel malt backbone riding thru with a quality bready maltiness. That's where Sixpoint ales win it's there malts they never forget that the hop show is nothing without the base malt, flavor here screams that with a nice bitter hopped up brown ale still able to show off a complex malt base. Semi bitter finish medium to light bodied nothing cloying or holding me back from another drink gravity did all the work, damn where did the beer go...drinkability is insane I want a whole four pack. Damn good balanced but hoppier neo brown ale."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is really a nice beer. It has the hallmarks of a traditional brown ale with big caramel notes and a faint nuttiness. This beer, however, brings a big hop punch with an intense citrus character and solid, balanced bitterness. This is definitely worth a try."
""
"O: A really interesting take on a brown ale. The hop flavoring — and where it kicks in — makes this a surprisingly refreshing darker brew. The transition between the malts up front and hops in the back is a bit weird, and really the only downside to the flavor combination. It was a really smart move by Sixpoint to release this when they did, as the beer is a great segue from lighter, refreshing summer beers to the Märzens/Oktoberfests and pumpkin ales of the fall."

"O: Very solid - one of the better Sixpoint offerings I've had. Hopped-up dark beers tend to be hit or miss, and I'd reckon this is an almost unqualified hit (and needless to say, it works FAR better than Diesel did). I say almost because it does lack a couple things, such as complexity, but I'd have no trouble revisiting this one again."
""
"O: Overall a beer that is intriquing with many layers of complexity when savored and slowly explored, yet just as enjoyable to drink in multiples just kicking back. 6 pack worthy. and yes i couldnt help but hum Mr. brownstone by gnr during drinking."
"Up front the taste is alive with sweet, flavorful malts, caramel as it warms, and a low to moderate hop bitterness on the tail end that gently goes to sleep as you finish it off. This is the kind of brown ale that I like."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"kudos to 6point on this one"
""
"It has a good brown malt flavor, but it is a bit short on the flavor. It's soft and drinkable, but nothing very exciting. It's a decent brown ale, but nothing I'd go crazy over. I don't generally care for brown ales without the load of flavor that this lacks."
"Sixpoint continues to underwhelm."
"O: Very solid, nothing earth-shattering but I will definitely be picking up more, not to pour into a glass and give a full analysis/write-up but to kick back and sip as this will be a fantastic session beer"
"Poured from a 16 oz can into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a cloudy brown with slight red hints with an off white head. Smells of earthy hops, surprising for a brown ale. Tastes of dark malt and earthy hops, nice combination. Carbonation is right for its light body and goes down smooth. Overall a very good beer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall I would get this again it's a pretty solid brown ale."
"O: I enjoy this beer, but just can't seem to get bored with it for a full four pack of this one. I'm sure I'll try it again someday, but it isn't one of those I feel must stay in the fridge at all times."
""
""
"Taste has a nice depth of flavor with a slightly roasted malt bill and some biscuit notes. Drinks sweet but has a slight bitter finish. Easy drinking and a silky smooth feel with depth of character.It's a winner in my opinion. Can I have another one please."
""
"Ever since the Cosby show, I've wanted to live in a brownstone somewhere. Call me weird. Anyway, this stuff pours a mostly clear sienna topped by a finger of glowing off-white foam. The nose comprises honey-laden biscuit, light maple syrup, mild grass, light walnut, and a hint of incredibly vague citrus rind way in the background. The taste brings in more of the same, with a stronger contingent of grass, a slightly stronger contingent of citrus, and a dried version of the honey and syrup. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a pretty nice little brown ale, nothing overtly special, but a decent option for the style."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is very nice fare, and for a comparatively low 6% ABV, has good flavor and presence, even over the course of several mouthfuls. It could have still used a bit more oomph for even more presence, and the sugars needed to be stronger to better make themselves noticed against the hops and breads. Still, what is given in here is drinkable and delicious."
""
""
""
"Poured from a tallboy into a tumbler pint, the beer is a slightly hazed, slightly muddled, amber-brown coloring with a thin, filmy, off-white surface coating. Aromas of hazelnut sweetness, with a creamy undertone. The nose is not overpowering, but it is inviting. Flavors are very rich and extremely roasty. Wow...the aromas lull you into a false sense of passiveness, and then you get a fire-roasted nut sweetness and richness, followed by sharp characteristics from both the thin, carbonated body as well as the lingering charcoal highlights. Some candied sweet characteristics build slowly as you continue to drink, but the rich and roasty carry you through the whole brew. The body is light, and remains able to support the robust flavors. Slick, clean finish with only the slightest short-lived linger of sweet. Solid brown."
""
"Overall - Not overly impressed but it is above average. Decent, but not amazing. If I had to place this somewhere I would call it ""New Castle's bigger brother"" or a ""Porter in training""."

"O - not my favorite Sixpoint offering but still an enjoyable ale. Went quite nicely with cheeseburgers."
"Deep, ruby brown color with a one-finger white head. Fair amount of lacing on the glass. Caramel sweetness in the aroma with noticable floral hop bitterness. Flavor consisted of a roasted malt backbone and doughy yeast. Medium bodied with a clean finish."
""
"O: This is a style we almost always pass up. Glad we slowed down enough to let this one hop on board."
"O) A fantastic take on a brown ale. A great brew. I'll be drinking more."
""
"D: good flavors, but a little muddled in my opinion. these guys have some better brews out there that I would recommend over Brownstone."
""
"However, keep in mind, I really do not like Brown Ales to start with, but I always enjoy tasting different beers. Not only for my personal reviews, but it helps when it comes to describing various beers to our customers."
""
""
"Well constructed like all six point products I've enjoyed, this one seems like a prototype and foundation for many other varieties they brew."
"Overall a good beer but definitely more hop forward than an English brown (and my preference)."
""
"Tangy with a light bitterness, nutty malt character, a drying and mildly hoppy finish. Medium bodied with a little bit of astringency and bittering hops. Light carbonation. A fairly straightforward brown ale that's a bit hoppier than the usual."
""
""
"Brownstone is great beer and one I would take down with some BBQ, it seems like a great match. 6% leads to all day drinking."
""
""
""
"Solid brown-ale without having to use a heavy bill of roast malts. Instead it relies on good use of nutty and toasted malts which is certainly nice for a change."
"this reminds me more of a hopped up amber ale than a brown ale, but to each his own. the extra hops are much welcomed and make this something i could see myself enjoying again. the can is always a ""plus"" in my book as well. one of the better brown ales out there."
""
"Overall: a bit bitter for a brown ale, even an American one; still, quite drinkable and definitely worth having again."
""

""

"Average finger’s worth of tan foam, moderate dimpling across the surface, disappears steadily but final retention near the surface is very good, not much lacing to speak of. Hazy brown liquid with a strong orange influence, almost looks like rusty water, very active carbonation throughout. The nose does a good job of creating an even spit between sweeter chocolate, toffee crunch, cola bean notes and an earthier, grassier hop presence, almost metallic or minerally at times, nothing here has too much cutting punch to it while also stays firm, maybe could soak in a bit more for added length. Medium-bodied, comes on quickly with carbonated churn in the mouth which likely keeps it drying than otherwise might be. So-so richness to the cocoa, malt, caramel, coffee bean flavors, not a lot of roast but there is decent yeastiness in a dry powder form. Less earthy and minerally here, about same level of herbaceousness with a run up in pine and grapefruit pith. No real fruit flavors. Curiously, sweeter colder than as it warms. Extends the finish well without sacrificing freshness, the bitterness could be ratcheted back."

"O- nicely done brown ale... maybe one of the leading in the style... six point is never a let down.... and a huge value as far as great beer in cans..."
"O: A far cry from the draft version I remember from the Redhook brewery."
""
""
"Overall: Perfectly balanced, tastes wonderful, and is incredibly satisfying. This is one of the best brown ales I've ever had."
""
"O - An easy drinking brown ale, Brownstone is crisp and clean with great malt and hop balance for an understated result. Sixpoint packs in delicate nuances which prevail when contemplating it's nature but are comfortable being lost in it's drinkability."
"O: Good beer, but I'm not overly impressed with the style to begin with. I thought it was ok, but I doubt I'll buy another can."
""
"A bit raw but certainly not unfinished, layers peel away with each sip as it warms up. I've had this on tap many times and the can seems to have held on to all of this greatness. Hands down one of my favorite American brewed browns."
""
"Poured into Sam Adams perfect pint glass. Appearance is a moderate brown with reddish hues and a touch of cloudiness. Nice 2 finger head upon pour with good retention. The nose features caramel, cream, faint chocolate, and earthy hops. The nose suggest that the flavor is going to be subtle with a decent presence of both malt and hops. Taste starts with some roasted malt character which I barely picked up on the nose. Some crusty bread comes in with a touch of caramel character. The taste finishes with a hop note. This brown ale has a decent bit of character and is also unique for the style. The mouthfeel is moderate with high carabonation. Overall, worth a try, especially if brown ales are your thing."

"16 ounce can into imperial pint glass, best before 4/26/2013. Pours fairly cloudy reddish copper color with a nice 2 finger dense khaki head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of caramel, biscuit, grass, herbal, grapefruit, pine, chocolate, toast, orange zest, and slight nuttiness. Pretty nice and pleasant aromas with decent strength and balance. Taste of caramel, toast, grapefruit, biscuit, pine, grass, orange zest, chocolate, and light nuttiness. Decent amount of pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, citrus, pine, grass, biscuit, and light nuttiness on the finish for a bit. Pretty good flavor balance; but is very much hop forward with hardly any noticeable darker malts until after the finish. No cloying flavors or sweetness at all. Medium carbonation and body; with a farily creamy and sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with almost zero warming noticed on the finish. Overall this is a good brown ale. Could have use more prominent chocolate roasted flavors in my opinion; but was still nicely balanced and very drinkable. Quite enjoyable."
""
"A solid brown ale, a bit hoppier than most. Goes down real easy...A winner"
""
""
"O: Really pleasant brown, and a good one to pair with dessert. I did."
"First sip is pleasingly refreshing, effervescent, mild hop flavor, sweet crystal malt backbone, and a nice bitter finish. Certainly a hoppy take on the style, but it works nicely. I feel it could use a bit more body or malt sweetness, but that's a relatively minor fault."
"The body is medium with good carbonation. Overall this one is pretty solid. Enjoyable as are most Sixpoint beers."
""
""
"Decent, drinkable. Nothing remarkable though."
"Overall this is a good offering from Sixpoint, but just like all their recent can releases, I enjoyed their beers a lot more back when everything was draft only. Not enough malt to balance the emerging hoppy bitterness which ruins the overall flavor profile for me here."
""

"o - overall, sixpoint has been a big hit or miss brewery for me, this one falls more on the hit side than the miss side, but i'm not a fan of this one in the way i was of crisp or righteous or apollo, but this is definitely up there. this is certainly a brewery to watch as they are maturing and refining their process, their beers are solid. they had an incredible reputation when draft only and they are starting to come into their own learning from the canning process. i wouldn't write off any of their beers upon first taste as they are worth checking out each batch as they are taking feedback and tweaking. this is a solid brown with some unique notes in the flavor."

"served from a 16 oz. can - pours with a massive, light tan head that has decent retention - a bit less lacing than I would have expected initially - beer itself is a hazy, nearly opaque medium copper/orange - aroma is pleasant, but lacking in the overall toasty, caramel presence I associate with this style - there is a definite presence of assertive citrusy hops aroma though, which really pushes the malt to there rear, leaving it almost as an afterthought - - again, taste is pleasant, but still lacking in the crucial roasted and caramel notes for the style - there is far more hops presence here than I care for in a brown ale - mouthfeel is nice, with a crispness added by a nice level of carbonation - overall, this isn't a bad beer at all, however, it drinks far more like a pale ale than a brown ale - a rare (semi) disappointment from a brewery that is rapidly gaining my appreciation."

"O/D-Another crazy Sixpoint ale that I am truly digging. Alcohol does come out here and there, but thats my only real critique of this brew. Complex, great looking and easy-drinking. Another hit. PERFECT for the beginning of Autumn."
""
""
"VERY NICE, GIVE IT A GO!"
""
""
""
"The beer pours a brown color with a tan head. The aroma has some nice light cocoa and toffee malts, as well as a good bit of grass and some earth. The flavor is very similar. The toffee and dusty chocolate notes come through initially, but there is also a decent amount of bitterness for a brown ale. I also get a little bit of grass flavor from the hops. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A nice take on a brown ale."
"Overall, it's straightforward and well done. A great session brew, no doubt."
""
""
""
"a great beer from sixpoint. the cans are usually hit or miss, this one is a solid go-to much like the crisp."
""
"O- Interesting brown ale. I would say its in between a brown and an IPA. But good beer never the less."
"16oz can, pours brown with some reddish hues when held to a light. Nice frothy, beige head holds excellent retention and leaves all kinds of lacing on the glass. Aromas are toasted malt, chocolate malt, grassy hops. Tastes are chocolate malt, fresh hops, toasty grain, unexpected hint of pine, nice balance with a hoppy bite on the finish. Mouth-feel is thin-medium, somewhat resiny, good carbonation. This was hoppier than expected, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. Nice American Brown Ale."
""
"Check this out if you want a simple, drinkable brown ale that you can also take to the beach or public gatherings where glass is forbidden."
"O: I like this for the most part, yet for a brown the hops are a bit too much in front of the malts."
"The first quote is from the poem, ""Letter to N.Y."" by Elizabeth Bishop. The Crack and Glug was from my kitchen. I could not invert the CAN, but the massive head that formed anyway created a cascading action as it fell away to become liquid. I had a dense two-plus fingers of light-tan head with great retention when all was said and done. Color was a reddish-brown with NE-quality clarity, but not deep enough in its shade to be called mahogany. Nose had a real hop presence to it, very pine-y, underlain by a slight malty sweetness. Mouthfeel was medium and the hops really presented up front, followed by a light chocolaty sweetness on the tongue. The finish was dry, mostly from the hops, but the extreme finish allowed me to experience the malt again. Once more, they are not doing things to style, but that suits me just fine."
"Overall an easy drinking brown, with some light flavors. Something in my gut tells me this on tap or nitro would make it sing."
""
"Overall, this is one of the more disappointing Sixpoint beers I've had. I doubt I'll finish the can."
""
""
"This brown ale is so hop-forward that it pushes the boundaries of pale ale levels of hopping. It certainly makes things interesting, however the cost of the high hopping seems to be the obscuring of the nutty and bready elements of a typical brown ale. YMMV."
""
"Both smooth and crisp, there's a good feel to this medium-bodied beer, which has more going for it than most browns. It's not thick, by any means, but it possesses a depth most in this typically middle-of-the-road style don't. It's also a pretty dry feel, but not too abrasive, as the malts sitting beneath the hops add their own, just enough sweetness to keep it from chalky and make it great."
"16oz Tall Boy with Best Before 26APR2013 stamped on the bottom of the can. Good amount of lacing. Pours a dark brown color with an inch of frothy head. Almost looks like a glass of coke. Aromas of citrus hops, nuts, pine, earth and malts. Taste is citrus hops, caramel malts, earthiness and nuts. Actually has a bit of a cola taste to it. Floral at the end. Bubbly, light mouthfeel. Highly carbonated. Overall, one of the better Brown Ales out there. Sixpoint does it again."
"O: Very easy to drink and very sessionable - I could easily have a couple of these in an evening. The beer is enjoyable and pairs well with foods, from pub fare to upscale. The flavor profile seems to have shifted just a bit (with a little hop presence) since this moved to a year round offering in cans."
""
"Notes: A solid beer and nicely drinkable. Cheers."
"O - all around good brown ale."
"O- sixpoint does it again. Making an enjoyable brown ale that possesses a sweet maltiness with a desired piney hop finish. Thanks!"
"O: Extremely happy with this drinking experience. An incredible version of the style. Just wish the can was matte brown (like Apollo is matte white) instead of chrome, ha."
""
""
"Overall - Nice smooth and flavorfull. More hoppy then most brown ales ive had. Still its balanced well, has nice bitterness along with sweetness. Great affordable price, good flavor, worth a drink for sure."
"O: Definitely an american take on brown ales. Very hoppy especially towards the finish. Lots of lingering resinous bitterness between sips. Not as strong on the toasted malt as most brown ales, perhaps obscured a bit by the hoppiness. Honestly it's more IPA than brown ale but I happen to like hops so I enjoyed this one :)"
""
""
"A weak brown ale base with a good hop profile. Sixpoint definitely cut down on the yeast profile from the last time I had this beer. Would love to see more body to this beer."
"It's reminicent of Bear Republic/Fat Head's/Stone TBA.. which I wasn't a huge fan of either."
"This brown ale is nicely balanced with a bit less sweet and more hops than typical. It has a great, fresh aroma and a lovely taste and aftertaste. It looks great in a glass, and it seems to transport well (I dragged this one with me to Moline IL on the banks of the Mississippi). Great stuff."
""
"o - Overall a very nice brown ale. Ton of malts and nuts, and very easy to drink. Hope they can this one; would like to have it again."
""
""
"O: Not a very complex beer, but a nice easy drinker especially at 6%. The 16 oz. can is another plus too. Definitely worthy of their newest year-round addition. Reminiscent of DFH's IBA, for comparisons sake"
""
"Sixpoint's Brownstone pours a nice chestnut brown. About two fingers of just off white foam caps the beer, displaying some nice head retention. A decent amount of lacing is left around the glass. The nose has a dry, roasty chocolate aroma, buttressed by a somewhat intense spicy-herbal note. Bitter dark chocolate shows up in the flavor as well, but some nuttiness adds a bit of malt complexity that the nose was lacking. The bitterness that comes through next is definitely on the restrained side. The hop finish is much more bold, with lots of herb and spice flavors showing up. The body is just a bit on the dry side for a brown ale, especially given that it's paired with a mildly assertive carbonation. I enjoyed my glass of Brownstone, but the slightly lackluster malt presence makes it come across as what one might imagine a brown IPA would be rather than a brown ale."
""
"O- overall this beer just gets better and better i would recommend drinking it at about 50 degrees"
""
""
""
""
"	Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was how hoppy it was. These made for a really great balance with those bittering malts. The malts in themselves were complex and dry, but we wished they were a bit more potent in both the nose and the flavoring. This beer was a nice complement to our shepherd’s pie and vinegar fries."
""
""

"There are few American Brown Ales that showcase the hop cone this well. With all the flavor of malt but with the dryness and hoppy display- Brownstone sings the praises of what the American attitude can be in this indigenous adaptation. This and Dogfish Head's India Brown Ale are in a class all their own."
"The cask version was the same. Good but not overwhelming in any way. Worth trying."
"The nose is bready and a bit hoppy. The upfront flavor is nutty like a classic brown, but thinner than a top-tier version of this style. There is also some caramel in the flavor. The roasted bitterness on the finish was quite nice."

""

"O- Awesome brown ale. I really like brown ales like this, the ones that have stout-like characteristics but also have a good hop presence and sweet nuttiness."
""
""
"I'm a Sixpoint fan, and this one is no exception. It has a little bit of everything in it, with an interesting balance of malt, hops, and yeast."
"A dark brown beer with a small creamy head that tapers down to a wisp on top. Nearly opaque. Nice sheets of creamy lace cling to the glass. A floral hop aroma with a backbone of toasty malt. Flavor puts the toasted malts in front but it's also nicely hopped and grassy as Sixpoint beers tend to be. Creamy mouthfeel with low to medium carbonation. Medium long finish with a solid blend of the hops and malt as it fades. Very well balanced between the two; definitely more hop forward that a traditional brown ale. Really enjoyed this. Another winner from Sixpoint!"
"O - Solid brown ale. Like the sort of hop character. Another solid offering from Sixpoint."
"dark brown in color with a wonderful tan head on top. Very nice robust look to it, almost a cedar hue to it. The aroma was a big suprise. Rich cocoa and hints of roasted malts. Touches of caramel as well as a light tobacco touch to it. Really huge brown ale here. Smooth, mellow carbonation, rich, creamy profile with each sip having to be savored time, and time again. Lots of rich caramel malts wash across the tongue with the very first sip, and so it begins as the smooth, mellow cocoa notes start to come together and mixed with a light, earthy bitter hoppiness,"
"Overall: A really nice brown alt. The malt backbone was great and the hops complimented it well."
"O - This has good drinkability. It is a solid brown ale, and i could easily drink a few glasses of this. Overall, I really enjoyed this one. Another hit from sixpoint. I recommend trying it."
"Had this brew on tap at gingerman, nyc. Poured a nice dark brown with roughly a fingers worth of head. Great taste of malty roastiness in the mouth and very smooth tasting. Tasted like a surly furious and bender put together in a delicious pint of beer. Would definitely have it again and again. Another solid brew from sixpoint!!"
"Milk chocolate brown in color with a muddy appearance. Poured with a steady off white head that leaaves a ladder of sticky lacings on the glass. Roasted malt, toffee and spicy herbal hop aromas, a bit smokey. Medium bodied with lively carbonation. This didn't seem to fit any specific style guideline, but it was like a cross between an esb and brown ale. Roasted malt and toffee flavors up front with spicy herbal hops being added through the middle and to the end. Roasted malt flavors transition to coffee at the finish which is fairly dry. Certainly have never has anything quite like this before."
"D: Overall it was a pretty tasty and interesting take on the beer, well worth a try."
"O - Another good offering from Sixpoint. Perhaps this guy will make it into the canning lines."
"D: easy to drink, but it suffers the same fate as most American brown ales: it's boring. The addition of hops might seem prudent on paper, but this implementation just doesn't do it for me."
"Pours a deep rich brown with a small amout of red tint. The head was at least a thumb tall and a gorgeous off white color. The smell was very different from the last brown I had and was malty with a nice espresso finish; there was also somethig very different I could not place. The taste of this beer was amazingly balanced. Chocolate and espresso migle great with a nice malty and barley or grainy flavor very well. I love how smoth this beer goes down and how the flavors mix so well! This is a great beer. Get it whenever you can!"
"Poured a dark brown with a thin off-white head. I could still see through the glass. The nose was roasted malt with some light chocolate notes. Tastes is toasted and faint chocolate. A malty sweet body but with a good hop kick. There was a lot of zesty hops over the malt that left a dryness which complimented the toasted/roasted malts."
"I wonder if it's a bad batch or tap that I got it from. Looking over the other reviews, I feel like I should have loved this brew, but I don't see myself having it again."
"Mouthfeel is creamy and very smooth, with very low carbonation, a medium body and a slight dry finish. Overall it was a very enjoyable beer which pleasantly surprised me with the huge hop presence."
"Drink is good, light little biter but a nice malty balance, sessionable, dry finish, little sticky though."
"Overall, this is a very solid brown and a great beer from Sixpoint. This is my first Sixpoint beer and its giving me something to look out for. I'll be trying any Sixpoints I see on tap from now on. Worth a try if browns are your thing. Cheers!"
"D: One of the better examples of the style I have had. This is right there behind Kick Ass Brown and Bender for me. Very nice."
"Pours a murky brown color with cap of off white head, mix of dense and fluffy big bubbles, decent lacing. Scent is as murky as its appearance, earthy, bready and musty with touches of chocolate, coffee and brown sugar. Taste is a bit more clean with a blend of carmel, chocolate, butterscotch, light molasses, brown sugar and damp earth, notes of dark roasted nuts and coffee. Medium bodied, smooth and lighter carbonation. Sort of a watered down version of DFH Indian Brown, some underlying bold notes that dont quite force themselves through the taste profile."
"D - Extremely drinkable. Nicely balanced and mouthfeel is smooth and crisp. Has a lot of sweetness, but it never feels too overpowering."
"a nice looking brown with a thick headed pour. A tad caramel to the caramel wash color. Mild cloudy. Nose is subdued floral and toffee malt. Palate is a nice caramel malt toasty. With a mild tang that blends into the rather dry crisp bitter. Quite simple but very enjoyable and drinkable."
"Poured into a a liter mug, I'm in for a good time with this baby. A nice stiff finger-depth head on top of a dark chocolate filtered body. Smells wonderfully malty with layers of chocolate, coffee, and other roasted malts in this malt lovers ticket to paradise. The taste matches with a light-moderate body with some carbonation. I did not get bored drinking a liter of this."
"Excellent brown ale, especially on cask!"
"D: The beer is very easy to drink and sessionable. It also goes very well with food, particularly a burger."
"Very little aroma, but if I pulled hard I could detect a bit of caramel and some smoky beef. Rather thin body, rather thin taste: more caramel and some vanilla, maybe a few raisins. Had a reasonably wet finish, which I like in this style. Went well with a terrific seafood stew. An average brown ale, not great but not bad. You could do worse."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this a decent beer to drink for a while but there are better beers in the style that I would pick first."
"D: Very drinkable. In fact, I ordered another pint of it."
"D: Tasty and goes down remarkably easy. This is one to sit with for an evening."
"Drinkability: This is one of the more complex brown ales I have had. I know there is a flavor in there I cannot put my hand on. The nuttiness is there to match some other sweet flavors. Great brew, wish I could find this in bottles."
"This is an easily sessionable brown ale. Hearty, flavorful and relatively low in abv."
"D - Good and because of low abv can be consumed more often."
"I am NOT a fan of brown ales, as I find most of them warrant a fork & knife to be ingested. That being said, this beer blew my mind. Appearance is standard for a brown ale; deep mahogany, with a thin tan head, and fair lacing. The smell yielded notes of roasted malt, coffee, cocoa powder, toffee, and piney hops. The flavor was amazing; first the malty/sweetness hits you, then the hop essence blends in, and then it finishes with a roasted nut flavor that is not overpowering. I even detected the piney hops in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel, in my mind, was the best part...this was a medium-bodied brown ale, that felt adequately carbonated, easy on the palate, and VERY drinkable. The only sessionable brown ale that I've ever come across. I've butted heads with some friends over some of Sixpoint's offerings, but this, the Bengali IPA, and the Apollo Wheat really won me over. I'll try any new beer these guys concoct."
"D- I think that 6 point quietly puts out some solid beers....I have not had their whole lineup, but I have yet to have a bummer beer from them. The brownstone is a good example- a real good brown ale. Easy to drink and tasty."
"Everything I've ever had from Sixpoint has been excellent. If you ever find yourself in NYC, venture down to the Redhook section of Brooklyn and pop into Sixpoint for a tour and a tasting, you won't be sorry."
"Pours dark brown with off-white head. Subtle aroma of light chocolate, malt, hops, earth, and cinnamon. Smooth flavors of chocolate, slight roast, slight sweets, hop bitterness, earth, and diacetyl. Light-medium in body with low carbonation. This is a good brown ale with traits for all types of drinkers: it's got the hops, sweets, and roast balanced out to create a well-rounded brew."
"D: I've had this a couple of times now, and it never fails to blow my mind. It's full, it's rich, it's complex, it's got everything, and it nonetheless does not overwhelm. Everything is right about this beer."
"Worth a trip to Brooklyn!"
"Growler from Bellport Beer & Soda. Pours dark brown with a small ring of white head. Aroma of roasted malt, caramel, light roasted nuts, and sweet malt. Flavor of sweet malt, crystal malt (iced tea) and light roasted malt. Definitely sweeter on the flavor side. An ok brown, definitely on the sweet side."
"The medium mouthfeel certainly compliments the beer, a good representation of the style, I find it round and soft with its carbonation, and slightly buttery in its finish. For all of that, this beer goes down with a relaxing ease."
"Found this on tap at Brendan Behan in JP. Served in a pint glass. Extremely dark brown color. Whispy white head, with decent lacing. Smelled like malt and baker's chocolate. Taste was very appealing. Malt, cocoa, molasses all hit the taste buds. And the body was on the thick side, which I love, because that's the way a good brown ale should be: hearty but drinkable. Very smooth going down. A nice find at a surprising bar."
"Poured a medium brown color with an averaged sized off white. Lighter lacing left on the glass. Aromas of toasted nuttiness, earthy, roastiness, and lighter coffee. Tastes of toasted caramel, nuts, chocolate, and roasty. Decent for a brown ale."
"D: All things considered... not too shabby. It does lack compared to some of the other Sixpoint brews i've had."
"Moderate carbonation with a light to medium body."
"Great example of what one would define as an ""american brown," being complex enough to have a great mix of both. Would love to have this one available near me."
"To be honest, this was one of the least flavorful cask beers I've had. It had a nut and malt taste to it. Semi creamy but lacks any real kick to it. It left a sour aftertaste."
"On tap from Rattle and Hum NY. Poured a dark brownish red. good head retention, minor lacing. Faint smell of malt. smooth tasting, somewhat malty with a nice strong finish. no bitterness at all. a fairly drinkable beer, certainly a nice alternative to the macro brewed irish reds."
"goes nice with a good pub burger - i could drink a few of these on a lunch hour"
"Overall, this is a fine take on what can be a blander style from other breweries. Maintained a great deal of complexity for the style, and that really makes it stand out. Recommended."
"I could enjoy a few of these in a session - strong effort indeed."
"Is it an action-packed porter, or a rich, chocolatey goodness brown? Sixpoint's brewed up another platypus, and while sometimes their style-slicing creativity can result in their creations blurring together (Otis tastes a lot like Diesel to me, and the Apollo Wheat isn't /that/ much different than Sweet Action), this time the ingenuity works."
"D: Good ABV for a session. Perhaps a bit too much hop bite. May limit you to just a few. First experience with Sixpoint. Very interesting twist on a brown."
"D-Was a good session beer. I would like to try in a bottle after reading a few reviews and being better than on tap which is news to me. An easy brew to put down."
"Overall-Solid brown ale, well made and flavorful."
"On cask at the House of Brews on the West 46th. Served at correct temperature. Brownish red color and thin offwhite head. Sweet and raisn aromas. Flavors were hoppy and sweet malts. Smooth and silky. Ultra drinkable, the perfect session. One of the better Sixpoint ales."
"D- Very refreshing brown ale. I could definitely drink a bunch of this. I am very impressed with the Sixpoint offerings I have had."
"On tap at Cole's in B-lo,came poured into a standard pint glass a rich clear mahogany brown with a thinner soapy-like head.Mild roastiness and a smattering of cocoa in the nose,mildly sweet flavors up front a little caramel and chocolate malt mixing with some good earthy tones in the finish with a bit of woodiness.A solild brown a real quaffer seems lower than its ABV."
"The beer pours a brown color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a nice roasted, crystal, and bisquit malt scent that's dry and toastey with just a bit of malt sweetness. The taste is great as well. It has a complex malt bill that produces a wonderful roasted character with just a hint of sweetness in the finish. It has a bread-like presence as well. It goes down very easily and finishes light/thin. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a tremendous brown ale. It's light, yet complex. What a good drinking brown."
"Medium bodied, smooth and a little chewy. Very satisfying and drinkable. Brown Ales are not my thing, but this was a very tasty and sessionable one."
"On tap at Barcade. A good brown, I should have loved it more, perhaps it got lost as many a brown in the heavier beers before and after it. Opaque brown colour with lace. There is coffee grounds pronounced, nuch and many malts makes for a creamy mouthfeel but not the complex malt I was so expecting."
"Pours a dark brown. Nice off white head. Nose is nice and deep with a sweet tone. Flavor is deep, robust, and at just the right levels. You know you're drinking a brown ale with this one. If I were blind and tasted it, I would know exactly what it was. Nice lasting caramel aftertaste. Feel is smooth on liquid with a great bubble on the tongue. It kind of stays with you and nibbles on your mouth long after you are done (the bubble that is).Extremely drinkable. Another great brew from Sixpoint and a beautiful take on the style."
"My growler of Brownstone Ale was a perfect ice breaker at a pre-Christmas dinner last night as I poured all the adults from Nova Scotia, Vancouver and North Carolina a taste of one of Brooklyn's best. It's interesting malty aroma invited comments and first tasters remarked how smooth it went with the cheese platters we had out. A second round finished off the growler, but the unquestionable drinkability brought everyone to tell me what they wanted for Christmas in the form of growlers and half barrels."
"Tried the Brownstone while at a very nice place in NYC called The Half Pint (76 West 3rd Street, near Bleecker). It pours a dark brown with a foamy tan head. Some lacing on the glass. Smell was strong in hops and just a *tad* amount of roasted chocolate. Chocolate did not come out in the taste so much, but it's roasty hoppiness was very nice. A robust brown ale."
"A quality brown ale that I was very happy to find a cask of at Bobbique. Very drinkable. I wouldn't want to limit myself to one beer while here, but I could easily do so with this beer. Looking forward to finding it on-tap elsewhere."
"D-This is just a great brown ale. I get this whenever I see it on tap. Highly recommended for brown ale fans."
"Ah, this reminds me of Surly Brewing's Bender, though a step behind. That's no knock at this beer. A borderline porter, this beer featured a rich, dry cocoa flavor with a slight roasted edge. Nice and dark like a porter too, but this is a case where style doesn't matter. This is just a tasty beer."
"Pours a dark brown with a ruby glow. Huge three finger light khaki colored head that slowly dies down to a thin lacing. Stickiness is very spotty, but there. Smell is very nutty and woody. Mild toasted malt tingles the nose with a hint of a wheat bread as well. Taste is a very sweet caramel malt up front with a mild chocolate flavor as well. Hint of molasses mixes in quite well. Finish has nice hop bite to balance the malt out. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a mild amount of carbonation. Nice creamy brown ale. Sixpoint does another solid job on a beer more breweries seem to overlook in quality."
"Drinkability: great session beer. Easy to drink and leaves you satisifed unlike many other brown ales. Try this if you see it."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, semi-sweet, mildly fizzy up front and leading to a creamy, smooth ending that has a texture like a piece of tiramisu."
"Pours a nice slightly cloudy dark brown color, nice carbonation, nice huge two finger off-white creamy head, some islands and sticky lacing afterwards. The nose is malty, slight hop, slight chocolate, and caramel. The taste is malty, and a nice chocolate/caramel. Medium body. Very drinkable, a nice/different brown ale, recommended."
"This is an interesting brown ale, definitely something new, at least for me. The flavor is far less sweet than many brown ales (Dogfish Head or Avery), but also has a sort of bakery quality that I don't remember having before. It seemed a bit more ""British"" to me than most American Brown Ales. Good overall."
"Had this on tap at Fraunce's Tavern. It pours wonderfully with a gargantuan off-white head that quickly settled down to a nice thin lace. The smell was bready but I got a lot coffee and caramel notes in there too. One of my friends was nursing it but I found it highly drinkable and tasty. I had quite a few. This is another great brew from the guys at Sixpoint."
"Some of my new in-laws live in Michigan and are serious beer afficionados, lovers of Kalamazoo and Kuehnenn's, and proclaimed that I am their new favorite in law because of my taste in beer; meanwhile, several guests made a point to find us during the night and thank us for sharing this beer because they loved it so much, despite not being really ""big beer drinkers."" Yeah, it's that good. The best brown ale I've ever had."
"This is a pretty solid brown ale. The taste is buscuity and caramel malts with bitterness coming through near the finish. Not as sweet as some other browns. Mouthfeel was full and chewy. It was a very filling beer for me, so I don't know that I would call it sessionable, but it's still quite drinkable. Overall a reccomended brown ale from Sixpoint."
"D: I'd consider this to be pretty darned drinkable. Not necessarily the best brown ale I've ever had, but it's solid."
"I really enjoyed this brown ale. Very drinkable. Would be a good session beer."
"Notes: One of the more interesting brown ales I've had. Not only could it be a good session beer, but if you keep yourself to sipping it, you can really appreciate its range of flavors."
"Creamy white head, dark brown with ruby red hues, doesn't smell like much but very malty, coffee, smooth taste and a bit of chocolatey caramel sweetness with just the right amount of hops on the top. The standout qualities of this beer are the taste and the mouthfeel. I would have to say this beer was perfectly carbonated. Very effervescent, but not ""big bubbled"" like soda, it's like a brown ale with the carbonation of an Aventinus and it really brings out the taste. Combine that with the lite hoppiness and the sweetness and you have a refreshing brown ale, even in the muggy hot summer. I normally don't touch anything but wheat beers or IPAs in the summer but this is way, way worth it."
"another attempt to beat the heat. what could be more refreshing than a nice brown ale? pours a very solid dark brown. par for the sixpoint course, this beer looks foreboding in a serious way. looking at it makes me sweat more. creamy and thin coating of cottony foam. uniform lacing. looks like a homemade root beer. aroma is dominated by a bitter nuttiness with a mild hint of aromatic hops. more traditional nose, very fresh hints of soft-baked pretzel. wow, this is a smooth beer. slides down the throat like silk, emitting more of that roasted nut flavor as well as a touch of botanical green hoppiness. malt character isn't too thick or overbearing, but rather buttery and velvety. finishes bitter but not oppressive with a nougat flavor and some wheat bread. beery and delicious."
"Six point's nite at the Blind Tiger in NYC, sampled a pint of this one first. Pours chocolaty brown and murky, Nose is faintly bready. Minimal white head was noticed and minor lacing was left on the glass. I picked up some caramel, chocolate, and roasted grains. This is a lightly hopped, medium bodied, pleasant and refreshing brew. Perhaps a tad thin in the flavor department, but still a decent sessioner."
"This beer pours a light, old copper like brown with a decent sized off white head. Aroma is not all that strong, and we had a hard time really getting anything at all out of it until it warmed. Eventually there were some soft caramel smells and a twinge of citrus. Flavor is actually decent, a nice amount of hops balance a thin malt backbone. Drinkable for a brown beer, something I would enjoy in the sumer especially."
