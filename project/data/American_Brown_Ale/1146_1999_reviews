"The smell of this can be a bit off putting, but the taste is excellent!"

"At Rattle n Hum, NYC. From bottle dated 10/30/09. Thin, wispy head & lacing. High aromatics on the nose, all the warmth one would expect from a winter warmer. Despite 5 years in the bottle this is a well made beer that stands the test of time. The 7.6% doesn't show..at least not at this point."
"Overall:  This is another very good, very tasty beer from Goose Island!  There’s a lot going on it its flavor from the slightly sour cherry notes to the gingerbread spices.  I liked this very much!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  Needless to say this is over the hill but it does taste better than expected for being 7 years old. There’s still a nice bite of holiday spice and some nutty maltiness but the thinned out body and stale carbonation really take it down a notch."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Notes: Bottled 10/12/11. Aged for three years. Decent holiday beer that doesn't rely on spices to seem festive. I enjoyed the beer, but it's a little too one-noted. The body is slightly on the thin side. It didn't wow me, but it was enjoyable for what it was."
""
""
""
"Bottle is 2009, aged 5 years. Deep caramel brown color with an apricot nose. Solid taste with a bread like aftertaste. Great beer to start the winter!"
""
""
""
""
"I recommend this beer, if you like a sweeter beer.  No real hoppy bitterness to speak of, with a nice warming aftertaste.  Spot on Christmas ale!  Will pickup more."

"Pours a dark brown in color with a 3mm beige head that settles down to just along the edges of the glass. Some spotty lacing is seen. Sediment is seen at the bottom of the bottle. The aroma is like a good seasonal Christmas/ Winter brew with holiday spices, brown sugar, caramel, dark fruits and dark bread. The taste is close to that with lots of tasty flavors mixed in for a good balance. Good mix of spices as you can taste some cinnamon, nutmeg and others spices as well as some toffee. Very nice and no bitter or harsh finish. Medium to Medium+ bodied with perfect carbonation. Just makes you wish for cooler weather since it has been in the low 80's for most of September. Overall a great brew."

"Even though the ABV was not exceptionally high, this offering appeared to age very well."
""
"The bottle calls this a American Brown Ale but honestly it pours more like a Belgian spiced dubble. There’s a light, low aroma of dried stone fruits, raisin and dates, with a sweet and sweetly-spiced flavor of cloves and allspice blended with the raisin and dates. I found it a delicious and welcome surprise."
""
""
""
"Overall, I have concluded that the 2012 bottle had gone bad. There was a tiny bit of rust under the cap, and the beer displayed some very off flavors and scents, both fairly consistent with oxidation. As for the 2011, it is still a pretty good beer. I'm not sure this will ""develop in the bottle for up to 5 years."" Still, this is a fairly complex brown ale, which is saying something for most brown ales. (ratings are for the 2011)"
""
""
""
""
"Had the 2011 edition pured out of the bottle into a pint glass. Not sure how I feel about the whole aging in the bottle thing when it comes to beer and what the science is behind that, I guess to see the effects you'd essentially by a four pack, and drink one each year, or by the same year's 4 pack every year for 5 years or so. Seems like a lot of work. Anyway, not the best brown ale I've had. It had a nice nutty flavor to it, but there was an overpowering sour/sweetness to it that I didn't love. Hazy brown color that wasn't super appetizing. I prefer their Sixth Day around the holidays I think."

"O: Not sure why I though I should age this. Didn't blow me away last year. Wishful thinking it might improve significantly in a year, I suppose. Save your cellar space and just drink this fresh."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"notes: quite impressive. this is like a ramped up version of their brown ale with much higher hops and some dark fruits. It is complex with multiple layers of flavor. Yet another great beer from Goose Island."

"Overall: First time I'm having this and Goose Island comes once again delivers nothing but gems. It's a tad sweet for some, I think it's just right. When I catch the next batch I will be sure to grab them fresh. Salud!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall this was great, it was an impulse buy without me knowing too much about the beer before I got it, though I am a big fan of Goose island, toured their breweries and have had many beers from them and as such, this is ale is just another number on their great beers list. Recommended hands down."
""
""
""
""
""
"I think we're past the fresh stage, but still early on the aged stage on this one. Heavy malts going on. Mild spice. Seems very well made, but not quite the best time to approach this one. Nice enough to drink, I guess, but I will approach this one fresh or heavily aged next time."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a cloudy brown with very little head. Smells of chocolate primarily, with slight hoppy notes. Tastes of slight coffee and chocolate, with some piney hops. Beer goes down smooth, with its light body, good carbonation. Overall, a slightly above average beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste is surprisingly bitter considering the aroma is more sweet with creamy caramel and toffee merging with a moderate bitter bite that lingers and ends slightly dry. Still tasty all these months later."
"This is just a peculiar taste. Buttery and roasted grainy flavor. Maybe the musty smell is the tip-off that not all is well. Distinct cola flavor with some earthy hops. The carbonation is quite nice, however. Sweet and slightly bitter. Well, this is sort of drinkable, it doesn't seem to be spoiled, but the rest of the bottle is going down the sink."
"Taste is not overwhelming, fairly straight forward roasted malt aspect although the toffee flavors do add a touch of complexity, very soft carbonation but plenty of it, nice and creamy."

"D: This was reminiscent of Our Special Ale. Nice scent and taste, but nothing special. The body was only ok. The finish was smooth enough, so it was easy to drink. Seemed like it could really improve with age. Fresh wasn't bad, but fairly mundane."

"Tasty stuff, hard to put down for long. A pretty good example of a strong brown ale. Smell is first class. Taste could be more interesting though and more drawn together, a couple rough spots. Together it is pretty good, undecided whether the high abv works in its favour or not. I'll be interested to see how subsequent future years stack up."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One of the better Christmas ales I've had. Looking forward to next year's batch."
""
"Overall: Pretty solid ABA that has aged well and could be aged longer. Might have to go back to Granite Liquors in Weymouth to buy a few more."
""
""
""
""
""
"Definitely something different and not at all what I was expecting when I learnt that this one was a brown ale. It wasn't as malty as I was expecting and there was more hops too, that and it was sweeter than your usual brown ale in my opinion."
""
""
""
"Great Christmas ale - I'll certainly hope for a few more of these before next Christmas!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This was the best seasonal, in this case a special Christmas variety, I have ever had! It had a touch of Christmas spices and provided a very pleasurable taste on my pallate. I had it on tap and the glass came with a nice foamy head, was served quite cold and it required a second glass to confirm the experience."
""
"Pours a four-finger light tan head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Murky brown color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Brown sugar and malty nose and flavor is caramel and spicy malt. Bottled 8/31/2012, $2.80 for a 12oz bottle from Bert's Better Beers Hooksett, NH"
""
""
"what can i say about this beer i dont like it its leave a nasty after taste in my mouth doesnt given look good in a glass yes everybody loves it but i dont ,i dont go with the flow looks light a light brown ale not dark and it goes down bitter and it doesnt do anything for me"
"Taste starts with toasted malt and moves to licorice and fruit. Finish even has a descent hop kick to it for a brown. i really enjoyed the different flavors of this one."
"Bottle looks really classy."
""
""
"Bottom Line: At Christmas time there are some great brews out there, but this isn't one of them."
"O - I can't find much about this beer I really enjoy on a personal level. Alternatively, there isn't much I don't like from a quality perspective, save for the ""cheese"" on the nose. The undetones of fruit only seem welcome to me because they add some depth and uniqueness to an otherwise earthy, one-sided brown ale. Hops are fairly absent in Goose Island's Christmas Ale, which sure doesn't invoke the Christmas spirit within me."
""
"This was an interesting take on a winter seasonal. The Belgian qualities were undeniable, however I’m not sure if they were intentional."
""
""
""
"It has the characteristics of a Christmas ale but maybe a bit too much tinkering with extra spices that didn't combine greatly."
"Glad this is not an overly spiced holiday beer. This us a nice after dinner sipper."
""
"D: It is a bit sweet and boozy at 7.3% ABV to make a night of it, but as an after-dinner brew or even one to pair with a cigar, it's pretty complex & versatile. I'd reccomend sipping on it a bit closer to room temp rather than treat it like a winter quaffing strong brown ale."
""
"Overall bought this while back to try I just hope they still have some of this one in so I can buy more."
""
""
"I had a 2012 Christmas Ale. Regarding the aroma, the hops had a dominant expression over the malt (expected). The same happened in the taste, although the hop expression is even more pronounced. I noticed a caramelized background in the taste, but little of the nutty character I would expect. Overall, this is a good Brown Ale, and I would be pleasured to reencounter it."
""
""
""
""
""
"O. Listed as a brown ale but marketed as a Christmas ale, I'd prefer a bit more of a spicy flavor. It's a complex flavor, but a bit all over the place."
""
""
"Fun and festive one of my favorite christmas beers so far!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
" The flavor is very good with some mildly bitter hops up front with hint of malt and pine-like element with slight alcohol with malt toastiness rounding out the simple ale. This was a very nice Christmas ale in the traditional sense-it seems like an American Brown with a nice amount of hops -very tasty no matter how you slice it"

"You get a solid finger’s worth of tan foam, mostly miniscule bubbles with an island of larger ones at the pour spot, dissipates a bit quicker than preferred, the lacing is a broad thin sheet which, in turn, clings very nicely. The base liquid is clear, however, there is a huge amount of sediment floating about creating an overall opaque appearance, red brick to orange clay in color, can’t see any bubbles with all that muck. The nose is rum cake to fruit cake, baking spices, sweet vanilla and caramel, surprisingly boozy and alcoholic, has more subtly present orange citrus, bread crust and burning caramelized brown sugar notes, the fruit muted. Full-bodied, on the heavy side even if generally creamy in texture, just feels like it’s running with ankle weights on. More dry than sweet, the grittiness of the sediment an obvious factor in impeding flow. The carbonation is mild but sufficient. Piles on the chocolate, caramel, butterscotch and ginger, clove spice with pine sap and orange citrus, here the hops get more assertive. Not that yeasty nor bready, the fruit is kind of cherry to mixed berry, the sort of thing you’d find in a chocolate and fruit dessert. Not as boozy as the nose but you do perceive some heat and imbalance. Despite the above it’s really a pretty good brew – three previous bottles consumed before this write-up were better suggesting earlier consumption for optimal pleasure (sediment too a concern)."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-well balanced, creamy beer with a nice varied flavor profile. One of the better christmas seasonals that Ive had. A change from some of the over spiced beers that come around during the holidays"
""
""

""

"Goose Island's Christmas Ale really hit the spot on this cold December evening. While it seems that this beer should be classified as a winter warmer (or perhaps an American red ale) rather than a brown ale, it is nevertheless an impressive offering."
"Pours reddish brown, tons of yeast particles, and a foamy, beige head that fades to a foam atop the ale leaving a little lacing on the glass. Aromas are spicy, cherry, fruity, and sweet. Tastes have a nice balance of spice, cherry, brown malt, brown sugar, nice tartness, different than I remember from my previous experience, which actually prompted me to take notes and review it. Medium bodied, modest carbonation. Overall, definitely different than i remember, and actually quite pleasant. I'm surprised that in others' reviews cherry is not mentioned in taste or aroma. At 7.3%, it's warming, and with the spice makes a nice winter warmer."
""
""
""
"O- The look at the smell left more to be desired, but taste matters and this one steps up."
""
""
"O- I was expecting something more like a brown ale, but this tastes more like a winter warmer or a Scottish ale. It's okay, but not something that I'll really seek out next year."
""
""
"Great beer for once a year"
""
""
"O: This is pretty nice."
""
"Pours a hazy deep amber color with an off white head. In the aroma, big cinnamon and a mix bag of spices. In the taste, spicy cinnamon, and nutmeg, and it almost feels creamy. A spice like bite and a medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry cinnamon spice in the aftertaste. Big spice, and somewhat like eggnog, pleasant and enjoyable."
""
"O - A decent beer, but not getting the brown ale or the Christmas part too much. In a way, they 'mistakenly' made it better. Worth a try- but not blown away."
""
""
"beer has decent body. tastes very much like a brown ale. beyond that it doesn't shine the same as other Goose Island brews."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a pretty mahogany color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is malts, spice, some hops. Taste is yummy, malts, caramel ,a good hop presence, some spice, alcohol is well hidden. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is a high quality beer worth seeking out."
""
"Overall this beer surprised me with its complexity - I really enjoyed it and will certainly be on the lookout in years to come."
""
""
"O: Solid brew. Goose Island -- best parts of this beer are probably the least important factors. Taste is good -- better than a lot of Christmas Ales, but this isn't the best. That said, very good beer."
""
""
""
""
"O- This was unlike any other Christmas ale I've had. It is definitely the worst as it holds no flavors or characteristics I've come to expect out of a Christmas ale. It was quite sour and skunky. I would not recommend or buy again."
""
"Overall: Great brew. There are plenty of winter seasonals to get your hands on but this one is a ""go-to"" for me. This is a bit overpriced for a four-pack in my area but it is well worth the extra cash for a seasonal treat like this."
""
"D: definitely gets better as it warms. i took it out of the fridge and let it sit for 20 mins, wish i had waited longer. some holiday spice, but nothing overwhelming on any front. listed as an american brown, im surprised this wasnt fermented with a belgian yeast strand from all the dark fruity/sweet flavors and aromas i am detecting."
""
"This is a great holiday seasonal and worth picking up a 4 pack."
"This beer is a reddish, cloudy brew. It sports an enormous off-white head, with lots of fine lace. The aroma is of yeast and malt. There is a hint of alcohol, but its not distracting. Some spice and wood in the smell, but they're distant and faint. The taste is flavorful and strong. Warming comes out here, along with some great malt toast and bread flavors. The beer is full and flavorful. Great body and lingering malt finish. Nice brew."

"O) Enjoyed this Christmas offering quite a bit, and I'd say it's right up there with Great Lakes Christmas ale. On a side note, I got to say that doing beer reviews with this iPhone is so much more efficient. Kind of kicking myself for holding out on this purchase. Oh well, Glad to recommend this beer. Merry Christmas everyone..."

"O: Overall pretty good, fruity with a christmas cheer of alcohol and fruitiness. Found this to be more bock like then a brown."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. Overall it is a decent brew but if you took off the christmas label, it is just a brown ale with a bit more focus on some bitterness and orange-like zest. Not bad, but not something I would go out of my way to try again either."
"I prefer this over 2011. Everything, the taste, the nose, the strength, quaffability and the finish, has been notched up a bit."

"This is an exceptional Christmas Ale, give this one a try it will be my Christmas Ale of choice from now on! I am very impressed."
""
""
"Overall: I like the change of pace from the typical overly spiced Christmas ales out there, and the piney hops still give it a nice winter/holiday feel. It certainly won't blow you away, but it's a solid beer."

"O: Excellent Christmas ale. Great aromas and flavor."
"M - Medium to full bodied with medium carbonation; Pretty well done, but not crazy about the style. Probably won't get this again."
""
"O: I wish I had sat on this a little bit longer to see how it developed. Overall, I find it to be pretty boring. While not bad by any means, I wouldn't reach for this again given the chance."

"I had this on-tap at Thunder Bay Grille in Rockford, IL in December 2012. This pours a medium brown color with an off-white head. The scent is sweet with malts with hints of nuts. The taste is toasted filled with lots of good spice flavor and nuts. Has a great texture and flavor making it a great all-around beer."
"A very satisfying winter brown ale. Full bodied, but not too thick, or syrupy. It has a nice balance of very enjoyable flavors."
"Medium body, decent carbonation, sticky and lingering on the tongue. This felt more of a crossover style between the typical winter warmer and brown ale, which was pretty refreshing. The spice was slightly muted. but still delivered another level of flavor to the beer."
""
""
"O: I feel very meh about this beer. It's decent, but there's nothing about it that really stands out, either in terms of flavor or aroma, and there's nothing about it that says ""holiday"" or ""Christmas."" It's just a decent brown ale."
"A decent brown ale. I would recommend this for newcomers to craft beer."
""
""
"This was a very nice brown ale, full of rich flavor and easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This felt a lot stronger than the actual alcoholic content would imply. Because it's so complex and not as easygoing as most other Brown Ales that I've had, this didn't rate as highly as I would have liked. If you're tired of holiday beers that resemble Wassails or are too spicy, this would be a good alternative, even if this was deceptively complex for the implied style."
"O-i do not enjoy this beer. Its like a weirdly aged, spoiled APA. i'm not sure what it was set out to be, but i'm guessing it failed. there's really nothing else to say. the only reason i'd ever suggest this to someone is to see if i got a spoiled bottle or something."
""
""
""
""
"D/O: The bready/spicy yeast strain here gives it some staying power, and makes it *unique* compared to many other ""classic over-spiced American Christmas Ales"" on the market. But, by the time I finish this, I won't be itching to crack another one tonight."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O. This brew came highly acclaimed and I have to say Im a wee bit dissapointed. Overall very solid just didn't blow me away. I will definitely try again as I actually have last years version in the basement."
""
""
""
""
"O: Interesting flavors, but a bit unbalanced. The bitterness tastes green throughout and does not mesh well with the alcohol in the finish. Some tasty bread, caramel notes are present."
""
""
""
""
"2012 vintage poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a bright, vibrant, opaque, amber brown coloring with some unfiltered suspensions throughout. Sparse, filmy white surface coating with a slightly thicker ring around the glass. Aromas of nut sweetness, tangy caramel, sugary sweetness, old world fruits, and a floral hops presence. Pretty unique nose, and well blended, as it was hard to tease out specifics. Flavors are a solid lead punch of old world fruits, including date and fig, with a subtle ribbon of tart fruit sweetness, as well as tangy caramel and rich hazelnut. Very strong, deep, big, sweet flavors on the palate. Cloying is just cut short by an overpowered bitter hops profile, but that, too, is eventually overpowered. The sweet, earthy tones begin to overrun your taste buds. Dark cherry and oak characteristics come into the aftertaste, giving this a wine-like feel at the end of the drink, especially as you continue to drink and characteristics build. Rich, robust flavors on a mid-bodied brew lead to a rich, slightly cloying finish. Interesting, big brew, and great for the cold weather, but this one has a lot going on."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not as dark as some other winter styles, this is a nice switch up from the standard big winter warmer. Pretty much a solid amber ale with some christmas style spices. Would purchase again."
""
"Overall, this is the most unique Christmas Ale I've had in 2012. It really does taste like a Christmas dessert. The bottle says it's 7.2% ABV which is in conflict with this page, perhaps they change the ABV each year. But even at 7.2%, it goes down very easy. I'm honestly surprised I like this as much as I do. I might have to buy more."
""
"O/D-It has a bunch of what you'll find in most Winter/Christmas Ales, but it also has just as many aspects that are unique. It is definitely my kind of Holiday brew. I love how it sticks to its Brown Ale skeleton. I like this a lot. I could definitely see myself battling over whether to buy this or Sierra Nevada Celebration the next time I am in the Holiday spirit."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a nicely balanced Christmas beer. A tad much on the sweet and nutty side for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – It was a pretty decent brew. Other than a rather odd spicy aftertaste that the brew leaves on the tongue, all other aspects of the beer are very nice. It is worth a try."
""
""
"O: Certainly an interesting take on a brown ale. The spices are nice, but it seems like something is off with them. A nice switch up from the usual winter warmer, though"
""
"D - Very quaffable... Quite enjoyable... A very nice rather unheralded winter seasonal from Goose Island... This one will easily be in the annual rotation going forward... Heck, I may even invest in another four pack yet this year..."
""
"Pours a hazy chestnut-brown color. A tan head leaves just a trace of lacing. The nose is predominantly malty -- some nuttiness atop a bed of caramel. Some slight spice notes... maybe cinnamon and/or nutmeg. It's faint, which is fine by me as I'm not into spiced ales all that much. On the palate, this follows the nose somewhat closely. Rich and malty, bitterness subdued but present enough to lend balance, subtle spice notes that are hard to describe but definitely take the flavor in a different direction than a pure American brown. Mouthfeel features a soft carbonation akin to a good stout, and it works well here too. All in all, this hits all the right marks, but it just doesn't wow me."
""
""
"O: A nice beer, would like to give it another go in the future."
"Overall the swampy peat taste, possible brown malt and hops clash, and very little sweet malts make me reconsider a second glass. Hell if you enjoy it though drink up!"
""
"A pretty decent and flavorful ale, good balance between sweet and bitter, nice body, all around highly drinkable. Would have it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a slightly hazy deep auburn color with a huge khaki head that persists for a while leaving minimal lace on the way down the glass. Wonderful aroma of dark fruits like plums, dark cherries, prunes, and raisins. Lots of caramel and dark sugar aroma as well as a hint of alcohol and a bit of citrus and spicy hop. The flavor is sweet with lots of dark sugars and melanoidins. Light fruit flavors mixed with a bit of hay and I'm getting chestnuts? as well. Light spicy citrus bite and a touch of ethanol keeps everything on balance. Medium body with a light level of carbonation and a sweet almost syrupy mouthfeel. I quite enjoyed this beer, its an interesting fusion of styles. I find it like a dopplebock meets a Belgian strong dark only lighter in body and add some hops."
""
""
""
"O- never had this beer fresh, and I probably never will. This is by far one of the best winter seasonals I've had and its probably because of the age... I may let the other 6 age for another year... than this will really turn out how I want it..."
""
"Dark amber with ruby tints, clear, with a finger or so of white head that receded to a medium-sized ringlet, leaving a bit of lacing on the glass. Aroma of caramel malts, leafy hops, lesser notes of spice and dried fruits. More of the same in the taste, sweet malts, fairly nutty, some drying hop bitterness, and very light notes of spice, almost not worth mentioning. Medium body, nothing amazing going on, but a decent drinker overall."
"First year enjoying this... and that's exactly what I'm doing."
""
""
"Poured 2012 ABV 7.3% bottled 8/31/12 into a 13 oz tulip. Confused as to this being called a brown ale, seems more like a Old Ale to me. Pours a deep mahogany, lots of floaties, and a nice really off white head, that leaves lots of lace. Smell is carmel, nutmeg, toffee, and bready. Taste is much stronger, very little nutmeg with loads of carmel and toffee and some dark fruit, this is going to be a staple this Holiday season. Body is on the larger side, plenty of life, not dry, and really drinkable. This beer is really special, drinks much bigger than its ABV and it is really more complex than its size would have expect."
""
"Pours a hazy dark orange with a foamy orange-tan head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, citrus zest, and a slightly funky aroma. Taste is much the same with a mild hop bitterness with each sip, but there is no funk that comes across in the flavor. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but it seems to be show some age at this point."
""
""
""
"I enjoy this and will purchase more , I am going to put 2 away for a year and try them again next fall , they say they age well for up to 5 years"
"The malts are sugary sweet and candy-like. There is some slight booze apparent which is disappointing at only 7.3%. This is a little too hoppy for the style (although I understand that this is probably what they were going for this year). Chill out with the hops, America! Not bad, but I expected more from Goose Island."

"Overall - This is my very first Christmas ale, and I am quite pleased with it. This is not overly sweet by any means, and has a nice transition with a dry and lightly bitter finish - begging the next sip. I'm intrigued by the tea flavor, but find it very familiar and enjoyable. Check this one out, I found this at my local Walmart!"
""
"Overall a christmas ale I look forward to every year. Has an interesting flavor this year which is certainly suitable for the season."

"Bought a vintage bottle from 2008 while at the brewpub in Chicago. The beer poured out as a nice muddy brown color with a pretty good looking head on top. Some retention with a touch of lacing also. The smell of the beer reminded me more of a barley wine... I never would had said this was a brown ale. The smell is sweet, lots of caramel, maple and very malty. No hops aroma just very soft and malty. The taste of the beer is almost fruity with some spice and brown sugar. This tastes nothing like a brown ale to me. The mouthfeel is soft, creamy, warming and mellow. Overall very impressive beer. Really glad I grabbed a bottle of this. Very good beer all around."
""
"Definitely came out way to early with this, bottled in September, but it should pair rather well with the winter months. If anyone knows that this is a totally christmas ale this year please let me know so I can post my review in the appropriate place. The bottle I have looks exactly like the artwork in the picture for this beer but is a flat red color and says 2012 on it. It also read 7.3% abv and not 6.2 and came in a 4 pack not a 6."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 11/11/11. Pours very cloudy reddish brown color with a nice 2 finger fairly dense khaki head with nice retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Slight spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of caramel, toffee, biscuit, nuttiness, pepper, toast, pine, and herbal. Very nice and well balanced aromas with good strength. Taste of caramel, toast, biscuit, pepper, clove, toffee, nuttiness, pine, and herbal spiciness. Lingering notes of caramel, toffee, biscuit, nuttiness, pine, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a bit. Nice balance of flavors with good complexity. No cloying flavors at all after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with almost zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice holiday brown ale. Well balanced and fairly robust; and very smooth to drink. Very enjoyable."
"Overall/Comments: Excellent. This offering takes you on a winter journey combining a complex aroma and flavor profile into a fine, well crafted, very enjoyable beer. I highly recommend this. Classified as an American Brown Ale at 6.2% ABV."

"Not sure what to think of this beer. there are some nice notes on the nose & palate but overall it is a bit watery and lacking something. glad I tried it but lots of other things I would rather drink during the holiday season."

"Overall: an enjoyable, easy drinking quaff that's sure to satiate during the chilly holiday season.. I'd like to try this one fresh, but I gotta say, this 3 year old bottle appears to have aged great."
"Overall, more bitter than anticipated. The spice character is somewhat boring for a Christmas ale, but the hop character is not satisfying enough for an American brown."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Beer is medium to medium-heavy in body, with medium-low carbonation. Beer foams beer up slightly on palate, but not completely. Resulting mouthfeel is smooth, slightly creamy, generally fairly easy to drink. Finish is expectedly dry from some residual malt sugars and hop usage, slightly sticky around edges of mouth."
""
"Smelling this beer (which I let warm from fridge temp for a 1/2 hour) reveals potent yeast, sweetness, and spice. It's not nearly as spicy as sugar plumb (CCB), but is definitely christmasy and aromatic. Drinking this beer leaves the impression of having just taken a large bite of some bread pudding with the same heavy spiciness and yeast breadiness found in the nose. It's definitely an excellent winter beer, but can easily be enjoyed in the summer (as I have chosen to do). The mouthfeel is spectacular with a medium-full body, chewy texture, and effervescent spiciness. It's a highly drinkable beer, worth the price, and definitely worth trying."
""
"An exceptional brown, which is to say a very fine beer in a normally lackluster style. Recommended."
""
"O: This is a great American brown ale. It's one of the very few beers of this style that successfully manages to integrate piney, citrusy American hop notes with a classic English-style bready malt base. Very well done."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall, not as warming or filling as I'd want a winter ale to be. Not as brown either. But a spicy and fun ale. Forgettable."

"Overall-this is what I would expect from any beer that puts Christmas on the label, spicier than a typical winter beer, nice complexity, I would gravitate towards this in the dead of winter, solid offering."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, its a average beer. I'm a huge fan of GI but the yeasty/bread character throws off the other aspects of the beer (for me its not that appealing)."
""
"2011 made me wonder while drinking it if it was supposed to be some kind of red-brown hybrid. Apparently not. Anyway, it's unimpressive but not bad."
""
""
""
""
"Overall... it's nice!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall much better - or at least more interesting - than I remembered. Glad I gave this another shot."
""
""
""
"O: This isn't bad at all, but at $12/4 pack, I won't be buying this again."
""
"impressed. not exactly a nut brown ale, though it has nutty aspects, not exactly a winter warmer, though it has a bit of holiday spices. It works, though."
""
""
""
"Overall Impression- A greatly malted Brown ale that was pleasant but wouldn't go to a Goose Island Christmas Ale Tasting for it... They have MANY other beers worth visiting time and time again. I will stick to these. Go for it if you have the chance but nothing big."
"o - good brown ale that isn't as invasive as a lot of holiday spiced brews - I've never aged a American brown before but I think I might age the other half of these since they encourage it, seems like things might get interesting after a year or two"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-I was expecting more from this beer. The spices were not there, however the malt was great."
"The unlisted alcohol presence is detectable, and this is as strong of an ""American brown ale"" as I've ever had. A tasty sipper, and a very impressive brew. Now I wish I had another!"
""
""
"O: Such a nice winter brown; so glad it's back this year--I just wish now that it would snow and start acting like winter"
""
""
"12oz bottle. Deep copper colored brew, mostly clear. Aromas of nutty malts, brown sugar and cinnamon like spice. In the taste, earthy, with some raw ginger, nutmeg and toffee. Tea like hop flavor, very mild and herbal. Nutty, toasted malt flavor is the main player. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with a crisp carbonation. Overall, a pretty nice spiced brown ale, very English in style."
"A nice brown ale good flavor and nice feel."
"O- There isn't anything that scream winter or Christmas for this beer as the spice was barely noticeable even as it warmed up. A good brown ale nonetheless."
""
""
"D/O- Haven't had this one in a couple years, I don't remember it being this hoppy! Just an nice, easy drinking Brown. Tastes good, no in-your-face flavors. Value alert!...not worth buying a 4pack for $11-12."
""
""
""
"A class act, especially for a beer of this age. One is left with the impression that the hops have faded away, leaving a dominance of sweet malt flavours - sort of a barleywine lite. The aroma is magnificent, although the flavour is a bit too sweet and syrupy. Lovely mouthfeel. A decent Christmas brew that trumps quite a few I've tried this season."
""
""
""
""
"O- I liked the beer but not extra special"
""
""
"This is an excellent brown ale. It's malty, mild, and a bit spicy. Unfortunately, I think it's a horrible value. There are brown ales just as malty and mild as this one that won't cost you as much. I liked it, but it did not blow me away."
"Overall, this beer is exceptionally tasty and unique with its savory qualities. It is not your typical Christmas beer, nor is it your typical beer of any type. But it is a pleasure to drink at any time of year."
""
"O - A good Christmas brown ale, but not sure I would go back to this one too often."
""
"O: A very nice brown ale that does well as a winter warmer -- this is one that I'll come back to!"
""
"Overall: A very solid brown ale. Nothing to write home about but a very solid beer."
"While the consistency and carbonation are ok, the fact that my tongue recoils when I take a sip is the leading component of the ""feel"" of GI Christmas Ale. Just not a good beer overall. There are plenty of other seasonal offerings that blow this out of the water, so I won't lose sleep never giving this a second look again."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall a great winter ale that celebrates the holidays and taste is really good and glad to finally pop my bottle from 2009."
""
""
"Overall: Not bad expected a bit more spices. Flavor improved the warmer the beer got. Recommend letting it sit out for a bit before drinking."
"Taste has a really nice creamy feel to it with a vanilla-nutty, malt-yeast interplay. Reminds me alot of AV Winter Solstice...love that beer, so this one is right up my alley. Rarely do I find myself lamenting the split of a 22 oz bomber, but in this case I found the bottom of my snifter rather depressing. Delicioso! Age has been kind to this one...yes, yes."
"O - Pretty sweet and average."
"M: Light bodied. Easy drinking. Light carbonation. Sweet finish."
""
"O- a nice brew but too pricey to justify drinking alot of this one"
""
"O: For as much as I have heard about this I have to say pretty disappointed by the bland nature of this beer. Nothing too special here so I am hoping that some time in the bottle may help. Although I was disappointed, this is a really good beer still, just nothing special. Will definately get again for more of the novelty."
"Overall I thought that this was a good American Brown Ale and so far the best beer I have had from Goose Island. It had a nice malt profile, it wasn't overly spicy, and it had a nice amount of hops. It tastes like a mix of a hoppy American Brown Ale and a Winter Warmer. This beer had OK drinkability I could probably go for another one but after that I think the sweetness would get to me, it also goes pretty well with a meal. What I liked most about this beer was the way it's look and it's complexity in the aroma and taste they were a lot of balanced flavors going on. What I liked least about this beer the higher amount of sweetness and the high amount of carbonation, both would be pretty good if they were turned down a little bit. I would get this beer again when looking for a good holiday ale, it is a little different from your normal holiday Winter Warmer and I like that. I recommend giving this beer a try, it's a nice change of pace from the average Holiday Ale. This was a good attempt at a drinkable beer for the holidays and it has a good mixture of flavors and aromas that suit the season well, Goose Island manages to impress me a little with this beer."
"O: A delicious brew that I look forward to every year."
""
""
""
""
"O- not too bad. Somewhat thin for a brown ale, and decent flavor."
"O- A damn good beer, I have no complaints about it whatsoever but its not a have to have beer."
""
"Thanks to Crass3000 for this one!"
"Starting off my 12 Beers of Christmas with this one. It pours a clear russet-garnet-amber topped by a half-finger of dirty ecru foam. The nose comprises caramel, dark greens, black pepper, very light hard water, and light rye bread. The taste brings in more of the same, along with more black pepper, some mandarin orange, and a pinch of nutmeg. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slick, fluid feel. Overall, a nice brown ale, something easy-going enough for the beginning of the cold Winter months around here."
""
"O: Good stuff. A nice Brown Ale. Looking forward to seeing how this pairs with a roast pork dinner."
""
""
"I remember being able to get this in six packs years ago. One of those that I cut my craft beer teeth on, and was very excited to see this available again after so many years. It might have lost some of its luster, but hard to tell. Regardless, it is still very enjoyable and great for the holidays."
"O: Not bad at all. Some of the aromas don't quite mesh and it almost tastes like a brown ale plus an overspiced and fruity winter warmer, but it mostly works. That strange sawdust aroma/flavor overpowers a little bit as it warms up."
""
"Hockey teammate brought a couple four packs of Goose Island Xmas Ale to our recent game and it was pretty tasty. The beer poured a dark copper, a lighter shade of mahogany perhaps. Finger and change of offwhite head, having modest retention and some lacing. Nose has toffee, fruity malts, some dark berry notes and some distinct milk chocolate. Hint og some spicing as well. Taste has an interplay of rich toffee and carmel, more milk and dark chocolates. Finishes with a bit more spice and roasty character, yet remains fairly sweet throughout each sip. Low carbonation with a medium full feel, being fairly creamy at times. Good drinkability, a nice brown ale with light spicing. This has aged moderately well I'd think."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is really pretty tasty, lots of really nice toasty brown malt notes, and really nice (English-type) hop flavors/aromas, even if they're way stronger than they would be in a traditonal English Brown. That being said, it's $11.99 for a 4-pk. Would I pay it again? Meh, probably not. Overall, I'd probably give this a B, but with the price, I gotta knock it down to a B-."
""
"Overall nice brown ale, hints of spices, nice brown malts, caramel, toffee molasses, brown sugar, and even a nice hop kick. The only issue is the hint of tannic flavor from the hint of darker roast and slight astringent hop."
""
""
""
""
""
"O -- Overall? Just a little lackluster for a $14 dollar 4 pack."
""
""
"O - A solid and enjoyable brown ale, that I would go back for again and again. Super-easy to drink, sweet but not overly so, just spot-on. Recommend."
"Not a big beer that you would think to sit on but time has been kind to this one. Very pleasant flavors, warm and well integrated. Very easy to drink, very enjoyable. I wish I had a few more sitting around."
"This beer tastes like Christmas dessert. It's well balanced and easy to drink. The flavors really come out as the beer warms."
""
"An American brown ale strutting around like a Winter Warmer, you have to let this one get to celler temp as it becomes a real treat. Here's to a long winter so I can go through all of the seasoanls I have ... Goose Island was a great way to kick it off."
""
"O - My 1st Goose beer was pretty much a let down. If you like your brown ales on the sweet side, I would suggest it, but I really like them more roasty."
""
""
""
""
""
"Ok, unique malty and dried fruit flavor."
""
""
""
""
"Nice beer, goose island specialty beers never disappoint."
""
"EDIT: and I would never guess this beer is only 5.6% ABV. Seems a tad stronger."
"A good - but not awesome - Christmas offering. I could have a few but wouldn't seek it out."
""
"Overall: A nice tasting Christmas ale. Far from a standard brown ale."
""
""
""
"This is a nicely balanced holiday ale. While looking at it in my glass I feel it would be a most welcome addition to a holiday turkey or ham for that matter!"
""
"Quite delicious brown ale. Says it will develop for up to 5 years. Will be interested to see how that goes. A nice simple beer to drink on a winter night. Will probably enjoy once or twice a year."
"O - a tasty beer for the season, happy holidays."
"***This is one of the cleanest, most well-designed Christmas beer labels I've seen this season. Beautiful design."
""
""
""
""
"o: a decent beer. easy drinkin but it just fels like it's missing something."
""
""
"O: Enjoyable but a bit simplistic/sweet; I've heard this ages well and will be curious to follow it over time"
""
""
""
"M - Medium body with good carbonation. Even for being a 5.6% beer, I get a little alcohol warmth."
""
"O: Goose Island doesn't always go with the grain for their seasonals - this Christmas Ale being one of them. A brown in the dead of winter? Ok, as I like changing it up. This is by no means an amazing brown, but it's passable and certainly quaffable."
""
"Review 2012 bottling: not as big a fan - seemed a little less warm, a little less rich - had a less refined character and a higher abv (7.4?)."
""
"O- I feel like my breath stinks now."
""
""
""
""
"Review is for the 2011 bottling."
""
""
"O - Meh. Kind of a disapointment. Maybe the brewer was shooting to high, but it didn't get there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not particularly thick, but then again it's < 6% ABV so the malt bill isn't TOO substantial. Very nice overall, the 4-pack disappeared quickly."
"Delicious."
""
""
"Poured from 12oz bottle into pint glass. Very pleased to see this offering in 2011 (Goose Island did not produce this brew in 2010) in a four pack. Pours cloudy brown with a rich off white head that laces to the glass quite well. Aroma of bready malts, hints of holiday spice, a bit of caramel. Taste is fantastically smooth for the style with a nice, crisp finish with a nie lingering taste in the back of my gums towards the throat. The caramel malt and spices blend well together, a touch of quality hops are detected, a touch of ale yeast. Balanced very well and one of my favorite Christmas brown ales."
""
"Overall this is a tasty and interesting take on the Christmas seasonal. I dare say it may be tea-bagged with cherry wood, and it's kinda cool that they change the recipe up a little every year. They also say it ages well, hmm...Cheers!"
""
""
"Just picked up four bottles at the store and was frankly unimpressed. It looks and tastes like a fairly standard brown ale--sweet caramel malt, notes of chocolate, just a hint of spice, some bitter pine hoppiness on the finish. I found the mouthfeel to be on the watery side, which drags it down overall--I really want winter warmers to be warming, you know?"
""
"Notes: Curious about the marketing/branding of this release. Supposedly it was not going to be bottled anymore, stake by the macros in GI, and now it comes in very limited/exclusive quantities…? And sure, it is nice, but I'm not sure it is a brew that can hold any type of hype…."
""
""
""
"O - A good American style brown ale. Well balanced with enough hops in there to satisfy - cuts through the malt and rounds out the flavors very well...smooth caramelly malt gives a really nice base for this one. Not exactly sure why/what makes this a Christmas seasonal, but it is pretty tasty...not sure I would go out of my way to find this again...but for a shot in the dark 4pk purchase I'm not disappointed at all."
"Overall- This a good brown, but the spiciness is not countered enough by brown ale nuttiness and maltiness. The mouth feel needs a little tweaking. In the end, I would have it again, and I would recommend giving it a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability: It is a very solid holiday beer. It offers both the malts the season has me craving and the spicy edge I want from holiday releases without overemphasizing either."
"Overall, kind of does remind me of a spicy warmer, but not really. Brown Ale huh? nice take on one! I'll have another no complaints whatsoever."
"Poured a darker amber that has a copperish twinge to it. Small cream colored head that dispersed to a slight layer of froath around the glass. The smells are not very robust with hints of caramel, roast, nuts and malt. The taste mirrors the smell with very little in the way of complexity. The taste is high maltiness. Any taste fleets quickly leaving not much aftertaste. Perhaps this one can use a year or two cellared to develop its flavors. New packaging and a higher ABV (6.2) are some changes from past releases."
"O- Everything a Christmas ale should be. I really like browns and this is a great one no matter what time of year."
"This is a highly drinkable beer. Would be easy to tip back a few of these. Not sure how or why this is a Christmas beer. It's just a well crafted brown ale. One of the more enjoyable ones I've had in a while actually. Just don't expect to be wowed."
"It looked nice, but not really a typical brown ale color. I was not picking up anything on the nose. The taste was not bad, just not really anything. It says it can cellar for five years (interesting at ABV 6.2%) so three more are waiting in the cellar for the next few years. Hopefully it gets better."
"O: Well I took a 4 year hiatus from this brew and never really appreciated it for what it was at the time. Now that it has gone through numerous format changes, I couldn't resist picking up the 4 pack. The new label art looks really nice and the beer is quite tasty."
"O: I like this on the whole, but there are more exciting holiday brews, for sure. I'm interested to cellar a bottle or two; I suspect it would turn out pretty nicely if the spices are given time to mellow."
"O- A nice Christmas Ale that is very different from a lot of the Winter Warmers. Very drinkable."
"O: Man, I dug this one. I've seen this one in stores quite a bit whenever I go back to the Midwest, but have never taken the plunge until now. I'm glad I did!"
"Poured a dark copper, a lighter shade of mahogany perhaps. Finger and change of offwhite head, having modest retention and some lacing. Nose has toffee, fruity malts, some dark berry notes and some distinct milk chocolate. Hint og some spicing as well. Taste has an interplay of rich toffee and carmel, more milk and dark chocolates. Finishes with a bit more spice and roasty character, yet remains fairly sweet throughout each sip. Low carbonation with a medium full feel, being fairly creamy at times. Good drinkability, a nice brown ale with light spicing. This has aged moderately well I'd think."
"O - I really enjoyed this one. If your looking for the perfect holiday ale to compliment your fruit cake this might be it."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability - Very drinkable and perfect for the oncoming holiday season. A zangy brown ale littered with spice. Medium-bodied with average carbonation."
"This was my first vintage and I really enjoyed it. It was easy to drink and I'm already looking forward to seeing their 2011 version."
"O- I love when people say that a beer has to be over a certain abv to age well... I call BS!!! One of the best brews I ever had was a 6yr old SA 2004 Chocolate Bock at 5.5%... this is a brew that stands up fantastic as well!!! This beer is so well done that I wish it was an everyday brew! I've had this bottle cellering since early 2010, and just found a great stash of it last week! I think I'll grab a bunch more!"
"Overall a really good beer which surprised me as I normally am not a fan of brown ales. I enjoyed this beer a lot and will definitely buy it in the future."
"Taste, enjoyable, more to the flavor profile than the appearance or style label would have led on. Even though brown, caramel and toffee all over it, maybe brown sugar, pronounced sweetness without being a turnoff. Highly carbonated. Pulls out some pine flavor without really having any hop assertiveness."
"This is a pretty enjoyable brew. I shall look for it again near Christmas. You may want to do the same."
"O: A solid brown ale. Very light and a decent after dinner drink."
"Overall: Relatively decent offering, fun to try but only once."
"D-Very rich although highly drinkable as well. This one held up pretty well with some considerable aging despite it's low ABV."
"D- Very tasty, and the low alcohol content makes a bomber the perfect after dinner treat."
"Really nice stuff overall, appropriately Christmas-y but a damn good brew regardless of season."
"OVERALL: A generally pleasant and flavorful Christmas Ale. I would be curious to compare this to a bottle of 2009 Christmas from last year, my guess is that it has mellowed out since then. A nice beer for a freezing cold Chicago night like tonight."
"Notwithstanding the feel, a wonderful festive beer. Beautifully complex and the flavours are just lovely and balanced. I wish I had more."
"Pours a deep and clear, brownish amber-orange. A thick, pillowy tan head sticks all over the glass. Smell is sweet, very good and dessert-like. All kinds of tasty malts and a touch of honey. Taste is rich and full; a roasted feeling lasts the entire time, with an added bonus of spices which also linger in the finish. It's tight and sweet, yet fulfilling. Its richness prevents a long session, but this beer does exactly what a warmer (even tho it's not..) should do - satisfy the taste buds and stomach in a short amount of time. Very good."
"Served in a tulip. Pours a moderately-dark brown, tending toward a dark caramel color. Single-finger white head to begin, quickly falling into a thin white collar and a few bubbles around the edges. The nose brings a bit of caramel sweetness and a mild dark-fruit presence. Somewhat dry and not too spicy; not sure if it ever was. The taste is nice and moderately-sweet with a pronounced caramel presence. No real spice, but there is a mild, understated hop character there. Medium body and a fairly-dry finish. Drinks pretty well overall; glad we got to try this now that I know it's not being bottled any longer."
"The beer pours a brownish-amber color with a white head. The aroma is very one dimensional. I get a lot of toffee notes, but that is it. No hops, spices, etc... The flavor is much more complex and a big improvement over the aroma. I get a lot of caramel and toffee malts, but there is also a nice hop component to the flavor. I get some grass and pine hops which provide a nice bit of bitterness to balance out all of the malt sweetness. I also get some cocoa in the flavor and maybe a little bit of spice, but if it is there, it is very subtle. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Another good beer from Goose Island."
"This beer's spent a year on the shelf, and it's hard to tell if the age has been a good thing or a bad thing. The malt seems nicely developed, but I would've liked to have experienced the fresh spices. Regardless of flavor, I enjoy the knowledge that my purchase of this beer allowed Goose Island to donate some cash to the Chicago Christmas Ship, a vessel that sails from Michigan to Chicago with a cargo of Christmas trees to give to disadvantaged families. Good beer, cool cause."
"Poured aggressively for a 2-finger head, reduces to a thin, bubbly film, lacing is very sticky, color is cloudy crimson-brown. Aroma of nutmeg, cinnamon, and fresh sweet amber malts. Taste has an excellent malt character, with caramel and light vanilla. When the malt has this complexity, it tricks me into thinking about vanilla. The last beer to do that was Lagunitas Lucky 13. Alcohol is non-existent, and I could sip this all night. Let it warm up just a little bit."
"I'm not sure what makes this a Christmas Ale, but I enjoyed it anyway. If I knew this wasn't a spiced, winter ale, I would have opened it much sooner. But I wasn't about to open a Christmas Ale in the spring, so it sat until Christmas 2010. It help up really nice, but I'd love to try a fresh version."
"A fantastic beer, and a wonderful drop to celebrate Christmas with the family. A year of age on it? Wonderful. I'm not sure what it's like fresh, but the integration and balance is just right a year on. Really lovely."
"drinkable - a little too sweet - probably one and done."
"Poured into tulip style glass. The best part of this beer for me was the appearance. After that, it was just plain boring. OK smell,ok taste,ok mouthfeel,just ok- was hoping for better from goose island. Should just call Goose Island American Boring Brown Ale. Maybe it is because my wife is enjoying a Three Philosophers with our roasted chestnuts."
"Overall this is a good beer but it did not meet my expectations at all, especially from such a sold brewery as Goose Island. Maybe a fresher example with some hop profile may have helped but it is just average compared to other Winter offerings I have had recently. It is still above average and quite drinkable, but leaves me wanting a little more."
"Note: 2009 vintage"
"Overall, a good beer that mellowed nicely with some cellar time."
"This was from the 2009 vintage dated 10/19/09. It poured a smooth hazelnut in color with a two finger beige head. The smell is malty with a smooth citrusy aroma to it. The citrus part is interesting because it's a sweet citrus scent that I can't quite put my finger on. The taste is pretty stellar for an amber. It has some hoppyness that makes your mouth water to accompany the subtle malt flavor. Being over a year old it drinks very, very smoothly but still has good crispness when it hits your palate. I really liked this and I don't normally like ambers. It's too bad Goose Island isn't brewing this one again this year."
"easy drinker. definatly worth a try!"
"Taste of roasted malts, browned sugars, some light spices? Light Vanilla and some nutty flavors mixed with a light caramelized sugar presence. Overall pretty well put together with a medium body. At first there was a tongue stinging carbonation level, that after 45 mins or so calmed down to a nice subtle nice carb level."
"10/2009 bottle, drank from tulip. Poured a copper brown color, with a bit over a finger of a slightly brown head. Clung well to the sides of the glass as it receded. Smelled of mostly roasted malts, molasses, some mild cinnamon, a small amount of hops, tiny bit of clove. Taste wasn't what I would expect for a brown ale. Was a rich, roasted malty tasting. A little bitter at the end, but spices were subtle but a nice element. Was medium bodied, light to medium carbonation. I enjoyed drinking this - first holiday beer of the season (albeit from last season)."
"Like a goblet full of fresh goose blood, it has vibrant color and pungent aroma. Tremendous malt complexity, slight oxidation adds brilliantly to the bouquet. Sweetbread, caramel (shit, it even smells sticky). Flavor is very similar but has a well-balanced bitter to it and finishes drier and thinner than I thought it would. It's a fine beer. A fine beer."
"Drinkability- A decent holiday ale from a good brewery. Basically, a slightly dressed up brown ale. I would prefer a higher gravity/alcohol version of this beer."
"Taste is similar. Up front, it is a jammy-spicey sweet brown bread with hints of rum, fruit and wood, followed by a drier finish with leafy-woody-toasty-citrusy-spicey bitterness and toasty dryness joining the jammy fruitiness, before becoming a sweet and spicey-bitter aftertaste with a lot of caramelised fruit, toast, and jam with light rumminess. It is balanced, complex, rich, but light, a faint warmth, full-bodied but very drinkable."
"D - the sweetness might make it hard to have more than one or two, but I suspect that in the colder winter months this one would flow quite nicely."
"An over all nice beer that fulfills a great role as a holiday brew. Certainly not the best cold weather drink, it has a subtle charm that grows on you after a while."
"I think I will enjoy these, but I don't intend to buy any more."
"Goose Island Christmas Ale--2006 12 oz. Bottle. 5.60% ABV. 50 IBU's. (4.0 / 5.0) Winter Ale. Mild lace head. Clear dark bronze black red color. Mild winter spice hop front. Roasted sweet burnt caramel mild nutmeg body. Smooth clean mild hop end. Smooth malty Winter Ale. Sampled 12/15/2006."
"delicious and very drinkable. i've been sitting on this for a few months now, and it was sitting in the beer store for a few months more than that. seems to age pretty well, wish i had a few more bottles to sit on."
"round, I would probably drink it all the time"
"Nice Christmas offering."
"Notes: The hops were a bit surprising to me at first for a brown ale/Christmas beer but everything comes together nicely in the finish. I also like that it keeps the spicing to a mellow level which adds to its drinkability in my opinion."
"Pours from the bottle into a nice, slighty hazy pour, topped off with some good off-white head. Pleasant holiday aromas of lightly roasted malt, chestnuts, caramel and raisins. Flavors of dark fruits, dark spices and bready malt. A good solid seasonal effort."
"A bit light for a brown, more like a dark amber with a god head and lacing. A bit of chill haze but fairly clear. Smell is very malty with a rich fruitiness. Caramel and dark breads combined with figs, apples, and pears. Hops are earthy and sit on top of a light butterscotch biscuit aroma. Taste is very American brown, a bigger personality than the British version. A strong caramel malt backbone unfolds a bready layer with all of the nose characteristics as well. Very roasty toasty. Mmm. A nice caramel/toffee sweetnessThe finish shows off a superb hop blend that opens with an English earthiness flowing into a mild grapefruit skin bitterness that dries and cleans the mouth. A nice yeasty breadiness remains lightly. Feel is crisp and somewhat creamy. Weight is on the heavier side of medium. A very drinkable winter ale that is coming in handy on this cool night."
"(D)- A good beer that fits the mood for the holiday season. Enjoyable enough for what it is. I could easily tip back a few of these bottles."
"Decently drinkable. Overall a good but not outstanding brown winter ale."
"d: ok but not too flavorful esp for an xmas beer"
"Drinkability is pretty good, a tasty brown ale (an under appreciated style) with a nice bit of umphh from the hops, but I don't see how they'd expect this would age well for 5 years in the bottle (the hops might last a year, the malt, maybe two, and then?), or really think it represents Christmas particularly well. It certainly wasn't what I was expecting when I grabbed it off the shelf, not reading the label until I got home...after which I was disappointed enough to put it off until I stumbled across it today. Again, good beer, but poorly marketed (and priced), should in 6 packs as a year round brown."
"This is a pleasant seasonal, unassuming but lacking the elegance I seek in this style. However, as a ""light"" version of the style, it works well with a casual lunch."
"Poured into an imperial pint, formed a 1"" tan head above the cloudy orangey amber brew. Dense head lasts amazingly, with ample chunky lacing. Aroma is spicy yeasts. Taste begins with somewhat worty maltiness, spicy in the middle, and closes lightly chalky. Mouthfeel is soft over the tongue, with okay drinkability. The spices were a bit overpowering to me."
"Brew poured copper-mahogany with a nice two finger head that is leaving thick lacing behind. Nose is hints of a malt backbone with some floral hops looming in the background. Taste is malty and finishes with a unexpected dry grapefruit hop with hints of dark fruit and chocolate. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth. Drinkability is good. This is a pretty nice hoppy brown ale that has some complexity and is pretty close to being sessionable. A bit pricey for what it is but i am glad to have the opportunity to try."
"Roasted grain character all around, flavors and finish and with a final bitter espresso character."
"Goose Island 2009 Christmas Ale is a clear, dense, red-brown ale with a huge, lumpy, foamy, off white head that has oily bubbles; outstanding retention and lacing. It has a bready and spicy aroma. It doesn't smell too sweet, but there's plenty of malt. There are notes of pine resin and maybe juniper, orange peel and nutmeg. It's medium-full bodied and quite smooth. It has a dry finish leaves the mouth slightly chalky. It has a well Balanced flavor. It's resiny, but there is also a sweet flavor like prune or fig. The bitterness is sufficient and casual. This may be a brown ale, but it has characteristics of both a red ale and a strong ale. As I finish the bottle, I'm still trying to determine if it's spiced or not."
"Poured a super hazy dark orange amber with virtually no head. Aroma is SUPER sweet and malty. There is an awesome doughy readiness to the nose in addition to lots o malt. Taste is wayyy to sweet. Lots of brown sugar presesnt here, in fact it tastes like Lagunitas' brown sugga except less alcohol presence. Not much hoppage is detectable here. I think its neccessary to balance the insane sweetness. This christmas ale seems to be very light on the Christmas spices but there are hints of dark fruit. Feel is kinda tingly and rough from the carbonation. Unfortunately i wouldn't want to much of this, but a sample but be just fine."
"Not bad, but not great."
"Another fine Ohoove contribution, this holiday brew shows a dark brown/ruby mahogany color with a big grey-tan head and very nice lacing. The first sniff says nutty malt and subtle piny hops, quite nice and not a typical holiday smell. The flavor comes on with a beautiful malt/hop blend topped with a nice brown sugar and allspice kiss. The hops finish a little dry on your tongue and there is a walnut, earthy quality with grassy highlights. Quite drinkable with solid mid-body feel. Not a classic holiday brew but a very lovely concoction that I would enjoy any time of year."
"I found this more drinkable then I expected, I opened this thinking it was going to be another spice bomb but it turned out to be a really enjoyable balanced malty beer. One of the better Christmas beers I have had."
"A definite winner in my book. Goose Island claims you can age it for 5 years, but I like the hop character it has a few months in and wouldn't want to age it myself."
"Drinkability: Though there were no bad charcteristics, it was delicious, but the result of everything put together is just a little too much to drink more than 22 ounces of it."
"I ended up drinking the entire 22oz bottle on my own and it was OK. I wouldn't rush out to get another but at the end of the bottle it was a nice gift I received..."
"This is a very drinkable American brown ale, with a nice dry hoppy taste. Not much alcohol but the flavor is huge and it lubricates the tongue for another. This is a rare sessionable Christmas ale, one I could drink all night and not get tired of."
"The malts and spices make this seem like a larger beer but it finishes well and leaves a taste of raisin on my tongue."
"This beer pours a deep, translucent auburn with an okay, off-white head. The aroma is mostly fruity malt with apricot, raspberries and sweet cherries coming through. The flavor is definitely not faithful to the style, but that's our affectation and not the brewery's. It's relatively sweet and malty with lots of malt fruitiness on the palate. This is a good and interesting beer, but it lacks complexity and a real hook. That seems a bit contradictory, but the beer is interesting as being malt fruit dominant but boring as these flavors are easily appreciated and don't really go anywhere. This is a nice Christmas ale that avoids the common holiday beer pitfalls, but it doesn't really have a big enough backbone or enough soul to grab me. Good beer but not something I would ever feel the need to buy again."
"Overall, I wasn't overly impressed with this beer. I think it is a nice winter beer, but nothing I would go crazy for. The price is rather high for the bomber as well. Drinkable, but nothing amazing."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, it's good beer that is worth drinking for a while but not the first Xmas seasonal that I would choose."
"D: Flavorful and fairly balanced. The spices add a layer of complexity."
"Very enjoyable and a very pleasant surprise that breaks the mold for this style (Christmas Ale). This leans more towards an ale than some Christmas beers out there that over spice the beer in an attempt to seem seasonal. This beer was very drinkable and tasty."
"4.5 D: Very drinkable beer. This is one of the few brews that impresses me without having tons of flavor. This is a relatively simple brew that displays a good recipe and great technique."
"Picked this brew up since most of the Goose Island brews I have tried I have liked. Nice looking art, bottled on 10/30/09. Brew poured to a nice russet brown color with a somewhat thinnish head, but the retention was good leaving some nice lacing. The smell is nice, it does have properties of a brown ale, slight coffee with a nice nut like aroma but also perhaps a slight spiciness. The aroma works for me, more on the brown ale side than spiced holiday brew. Some bread like aromas as well. The flavor while a little odd is very good. Biscuit and a slight cocoa flavor that breaks to a mild hop spiciness. Hop flavor lingers at the back of the moth for a bit. Don't think I would want more than a 22 in a sitting but it is a good brew and one I would get in the future. Be interested to see if the profile of the brew changes year over year when released."
"Its that kind of beer."
"D: A highly drinkable beer from one of my favorite (and local) breweries, but not quite what I would expect of a ""Christmas"" beer. It has a well balanced blend of flavors (between the sweet and roasty malts along with hints of floral and citrus hops) but I was expecting a bit more spice, dark fruits and general holiday flavors/aromas but I'm not getting that here. I feel like I can get a beer like this any time of the year and that it's nothing special for the holidays."
"D-An interesting brown, much more complex than its typical British counterparts."
"ehh, not too impressed with this. i would not buy this again. nothing stood out and i kind of wish this was not a bomber."
"D: It is a great christmas ale. I reminds me of a lighter version of Great Lakes, which is not a bad thing at all."
"This is terrific and highly recommended!"
"D: A pretty average brown ale I would say. A little dissapointing for a seasonal release I think."
"D: A nice seasonal offering overall. Spice flavors give this beer a welcome extra layer of complexity."
"Overall- on their (goose island) website they call this a brown ale but this is the most funkiest brown ale i've ever had. definitely a unique brew and if you cross paths with it i highly recommend you to try it."
"Pours a slightly cloudy copper color with 1 finger of head that settles into a ring. Smells of caramel malt with faint hints of nutmeg or allspice and a wisp of citrusy hops. Surprisingly big malt flavors greet the pallet first along with a thick, sweet mouthfeel. Some biscutiness towards the end and then a lingering finish that is slightly bitter. I really enjoyed this one."
"Great beer I first got this at premier gormet and it was great tasting brew, I had the other goose island beers and was very impressed with them too. Anyone want a festive beer this should be on your list! To me it was a nice full bodied brew with the classic holiday spices that you would normally find in this style, not bad in price either!"
"D- quite drinkable, prob. my favorite holiday beer so far, really enjoyed the moderate use of spices in this one"
"D: Waited to open this on Christmas Eve, and I was not disappointed. A really good Winter Warmer."
"Good atmosphere. Sppearance is pretty solid, but standard for a brown ale. Nose is full of components, very sweet and pleasing. Good balanced flavor componets... sweet, and bitter, and hoppy. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
"It's certainly a different route from the usual Christmas Ale. Looking for a hoppy brown? Then this is your beer for Christmas."
"Juicy, balanced and very drinkable. Fine Christmas ale."
"I like the idea of a Christmas goose but I think I'll be sticking to turkey this year. That being said, I'm happy to have enjoyed Goose Island's Christmas Ale on Christmas Day (and, by extension, to have contributed to a very worthwhile charity to which a share of the profits from this bottle will go). This beer has certainly brought me more Yuletide cheer!"
"Drinkability - 4.5/5.0 - A great option for a holiday beer outside the standard winter beer; very tasty!"
"D- A nice beer to drink on a ""cold"" Christmas Eve in California. Not my favorite winter warmer or brown ale, but I'm very glad to be able to try more of Goose Island's offerings."
"Poured from 12oz bottle. 2007 vintage. A- Pours a nice brownish coppery color. One and a half finger tannish head that stays a round for a short bit before dying down. Light lacing left on the sides of the glass. S- There is a pretty big caramel malt aroma to this. Some lighter hints of darker fruits (plum and fig. Also some very light bitter hopping in maybe the very end of this beer. Some kind of spice in there but very faint...maybe cinnamon or brown sugar. T- Light oxidation with this I must say. Not much but you can taste metallic hints in the very back of this. Big caramel malts in the front with some spice in the middle. There is a metallic hint from here on out but the light hopping on the end cuts the taste and almost washes it away. M- Medium mouthfeel. Carbonation was alright for the most part. Spice and malts were left on the palate and in the aftertaste long after the beer was gone. Not quite clean tasting but close. D- This was a very enjoyable beer that I wish I had more of. Maybe I'll"
"Reddish amber body, finger and a half tan head, slow dissipation with nice lacing. Sweetish nose, a bit more cocoa than dark chocolate, not much spice to speak of, and there was a bit of hop bite masked by the fruity sweetness. A really great tasting Winter Warmer, the sweetness is nicely balanced by subtle spices and hoppiness. Nicely carbonated and very drinkable. The consensus was this was one of the stars of the night, and I'll certainly be seeking out another bottle of this. Very accessible, worth bringing to a holiday party for craft newbies. Highly recommended."
"Eric"
"Poured a deep, deep brown with reddish hues, had good carbonation and a small sirty white head. Nose is dominated by caramel, syrup, spice. Taste is a warming, roasty, caramel, syrup and some spice. Althought it was tasty i was not to big of a fan because tnothing made this beer stand out. Good but not great."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability are average. A solid offering, but it isn't going to blow anyone away."
"It poured a good looking dark brown with a 2-3 finger foam head with a little bit of lacing. The smell was biscuity malt and faint hops in the background. Taste was okay not much too it. I didn't find much that was extraordinary from it. It was refreshing but overall I wouldn't buy it again. To me, not worth the $6 for the bomber. Pretty much a middle of the road brown."
"Overall a very good American brown, as it's labeled here, but an excellent winter warmer, if you ask me."
"I feel like this is an honest, well-crafted beer that just doesn't particularly appeal to me. If you particularly like brown ales or toasted-malt beers in general, you may quite like this beer indeed."
"Drinkability: Seems like a very nice cross between an American Brown Ale and an English Strong Ale. Nice stuff!"
"D. Drinkable. I think I was expecting a little more. This is a pretty good seasonal brew. Hard to pin down the spices used."
"Overall this was an enjoyable beer, but nothing outstanding. The label says it can be aged up to 5 years, but to be honest it didn't seem as if it would have benefited much by letting this one sit. I did appreciate that this beer wasn't a coffee or hop bomb, it was just a nice understated brew to relax with this winter season."
"D: Per the label, the recipe does change annually, yet no mention is made of branching out beyond the stated 'American Brown Ale'. It's not a bad brew, but definitely doesn't match the stated style...I'd recommend with the caveat that one not read too much. Good enough to have again, though not one worth seeking out (also, I can't imagine this brew cellaring particularly well either). Huh. Just plain Huh.sweet, grassy nose that's not 'bad', just not 'Christmas' for me, nor 'brown ale' for that matter...not 'getting this' as a brown or winter ale, hence not one I'd buy again."
"D= A solid holiday ale from a solid brewery. I could easily drink a couple of these in a sitting..."
"This is a very tasty and drinkable beer. It is a touch more subdued than most other holiday ales can be, yet it works very well. I have a couple more bottles in the cellar and I hope that I can resist them for awhile because I'd love to see how this does with a year or more of age on it. I think it will age well, along the lines of Anchor OSA."
"Pours a reddish brown color with almost no head whatsoever. Aroma is very sweet - dominated by caramel, with cinammon, apple,and molasses notes beneath it. Flavor features prominent roasted malt and hop bitterness, with a balance of the molasses and caramel. A longer finish."
"D: Pretty good. Solid brew."
"Drinkability - As I said before, this is a subtle beer that will reward the patient drinker from beginning to end. I suppose you could age it a bit to meld the flavors, but I found the various smells and tastes to be quite entertaining."
"Goose Xmas '09 is fun to pour, fun to smell and a pretty good drink. The alcohol comes off a little hot for me, but otherwise no complaints. Definitely worth a try."
"My overall opinion: I think this is an excellent Ale, with just the right amount of balance in taste / mouthfeel. It is something that both experienced beer advocates and newbies alike could sit down and enjoy together. Not too heavy, not too light."
"I've had this now both on tap and in a bottle, I prefer the bottle version slightly better, but that just might be a function of mood."
"D: Drinkable, actually sessionable but not a huge fan. Good to style I think but not my favorite winter brew."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a crisp carbonation. This stands up pretty well to local Nutcracker Ale."
"D- A remarkably smooth beer, although a bit mild. The perfect beer to sit back with and enjoy on a cold winter evening."
"Mouthfeel is a light medium with a good amount of carbonation."
"Drinkability - Quite drinkable...quaffable if you will. This drink is utterly growing on me. There is a lot going on here, and I like it all. From the sweetness I would look for in a winter warmer which then lends itself to a great hoppy/piney profile, but finishes up strong with some great spices (but not overboard which some do...amazingly balanced), which is exactly what I personally look for in a winter warmer. A damn good beer from GI. I'm glad I snagged this when it was available out here in CA."
"Very easy to drink ale. One of the lighter winter warmers, this one you can drink a lot of because of the mild taste."
"D - Easy to get down, tasty, could do more than one of the big bottle."
"12 oz bottle, rich brown color, very opaque with medium head. Taste - lots of caramel sweetness, with not much else going on, putting this close to ""malt bomb territory."" Mouthfeel is heavy due to the sweetness, although it has a fair amount of carbonation. A decent brew, but there are better christmas ales out there."
"Christmas Goose is a cloudy brown in color with a respectable beige head that reduced to a skin. The aroma is citrus-like. This is where it gets a little weird, the taste. You know that taste you get when the dentist gets some Novocain on your tongue? That's what it tasted like. I know, weird. After it warmed a little, it became malty sweet and a bit soapy. Feel is medium bodied and adequate carbonation. Drinkability is good. Despite the odd taste I first experienced, Xmas Goose is still a pretty good beer."
"D - While finding this beer relatively enjoyable, I am a little disappointed in the lack of spices that I think generally defines the winter warmer style. The bottle says to age up to 5 years and perhaps it will be better then. In short I am glad I have tried it, but really isn't anything to write home about."
"Overall a really good beer for a chilly night in WNY!"
"I'm not a big christmas fan but this one is light enough in aroma and flavor to make it good enough to drink and drink more than one. I wouldn't go out of my way to drink this again, but if I had to have a Christmas beer I'd pick this."
"D - Easy to drink but nothing more than a filler in between some other good beers. This one is skippable."
"Overall, very drinkable winter warmer, if a bit subdued"
"Tis the season..."
"Shows a reddish copper with a creamy, tan froth with great lacing. Aromas of caramel, toffee, subtle raisin (prune), baking spice, cinnamon, pecans, waffle, vanilla, & easy brown sugar. Smooth and creamy on the palate with flavors of vanilla, toffee, spices, & a slight citrus hop bitterness. Overall a great beer with a soft and complex nose and creamy texture. There are better Christmas beers, but for $6....I was very happy with this beer!"
"Pours a brownish amber with a large tan head. Nice retention lace, and sticky bubbles. Aromas of brown sugar, prune, pecan, and nutmeg make for a nice bouquet. Tastes of brown sugar, light roasted nuts, prune, and a peppery alcohol bite. The bottle says this brew will evolve for five years in the bottle, which is probably true, but I would rather have the beer perfectly drinkable right now if we are being honest about it. The finish is quite floral. Medium-light in body with a semi-smooth medium carbonation. Nice brew."
"Overall: The mouth feel is carbonated, creamy, and rich. The body of beer is medium thick and the finish is medium. This is a hearty winter warmer although I would have like to seen more spice and bit. I like how it does what it is suppose to do. It is yummy."
"D: The moderate alcohol and pleasant flavors make this beer quite drinkable. I'm not necessarily the biggest fan of Winter Warmers, but this one has a nice combination of flavors and aromas."
"D: soso, Not really a beer for me but its fairly drinkable."
"Tastes wet malt on the draw, but dries out in the mouth. Malt is toasted grains and nut with chocolate undertones. Smooth hop flavor accompanied by mild grassy bitter that increases in the finish. Spicing is flat and dry. Allspice mostly, with some nutmeg and cinnamon. Spice comes on late when the beer is drying out. I'm not fond of the finish. Mild heartburn in my belly is also unpleasant. Clean alcohol in the mouth, md-heavy carbonation, and md body. Time will likely be a friend to this beer. I find it disjointed right now."
"Enjoy!"
"Drinkability- Fairly well-balanced and pretty refreshing. Not too heavy on spice, but nothing stands out too much either."
"D - It's easy enough to drink - might get bored."
"Alright, age it instead of drinking it now."
"I am not digging this one too much.. sorry.. I will buy another bottle probably.. but it just seems pretty lacking given the price tag."
"overall a very good winter warmer, nicely built."
" Body is a little thin for a winter beer, but the more delicate flavors and lower alcohol present in this beer make for an appropriate mouthfeel. An enjoyable offering new, I'd like to lay one down and see how it ages over a few years."
"overall - great great winter warmer but to me its an amber"
"Malt: Pale, Extra Special Briess, Dark"
"D: I like the clean balance of this beer. Too many in the style are over the top in spicing."
"Good as a taster to contrast the other great GI beers, but otherwise, not very drinkable (to me)."
"This beer was hoppy and sweet at the same time. The did not seem to balance for me, they seemed to be to separate tastes in the same beer. There was a real creamy, almost frothy feel to the beer. I remember liking this beer more last year, I guess things change, but it is still quite drinkable."
"D- Mouthfeel and low abv make this a good winter session beer. Balanced flavor also helps in this category. Alcohol definitely warms you up after the first couple."
"The 1st winter warmer i've had with no warmth."
"Drinkability: I read the label and saw that the ABV was 5.6%...not extremely high which adds to the drinkability. I'm not usually one for a Christmas beer just because that sort of thing usually isn't my bag, but I was not disappointed here. This beer exceeded my expectations and left me understanding the saying ""never judge a book by its cover"". I wouldn't make it a session brew but it was a solid choice that left me wanting to experiment with Goose Islands selections in the future."
"Overall a fairly solid beer. During the winter, this is a good one to savor every once in a while."
"Fullish-medium in body with fine carbonation, the drink is too hot and a smidge too sticky to drink more than a couple, but make no mistake, Goose Island's is one fine Winter Warmer that really does the job in earning the designation. Thanks to Dr. Brad for the hookup!"
"Goose Island's Christmas release is a good one. While I do find it a little inferior to some other holiday releases, it's far from a bad choice. The nose could use some work, but it's satisfying in all other respects. Easily recommended."
"Have never been impressed with this beer from a bottle, got to try it on tap yesterday and it was much improved. From the bottle I've gotten no spicing, just a regular old brown ale. On tap it has a definite nose of pine needles, and juniper or elderberries, very intriguing. Overall it delivers a nice brown session experience, although the New Holland Cabin Fever wins out over this one."
"M/D - Very drinkable but a little too sweet for my taste to have multiple."
"GI Christmas Ale pours a nice amber color with a pretty good head. Its aroma is very sweet and fruity. There is some cherries in there and a slight bit of piney smelling hops. The flavor has a really nice sweet, caramel tasting malt backbone with some nice cinnamons and other ""holiday"" spices. It has a really nice mouthfeel and is very drinkable, a holiday treat."
"drinkability is great. there is great complexity and richness ehre without the usual overly-spiced quality that some winter warmers can take on. one of the better brews from Goose Clybourn. cheers!"
"D- This Christmas Ale has held up well and is very enjoyable. ABV is low and unnoticeable. If I find more of these in OH on my next trip for $1.19 I will buy them all!"
"I'm learning that Goose Island doesn't so much go for extreme flavors, but hangs its hat on the craftsmanship of quality flavors."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, a nice, full body, but light enough, and with enough carbonation to make it quite enjoyable."
"A clear red ale that pour with a enough foam to create a bit of a rocky head. Just some tiny bits of lace are left behind as the head falls. The nose has a complex, but subtle spiciness buried in a toasted-caramel malt nose. It's a bit too hard for me to discern what spices are lurking there, but they come out more in the taste: hints of allspice, clove and maybe even cinnamon. English tasting (read: Goldings, Fuggless) hops are tasted and give the beer nice balance, especially in the finish. This is full-bodied which I appreciate this time of year. A fairly hearty ale for the season for sure, but certainly on the cusp of being sessionable."
"I am a fan of Goose Island beers and this is a respectable offering but there is something missing. It's good beer but I find myself not being very interested in it."
"D- very easy to drink. could easily be a session. so bottle says will age for 5 years. huh. not really much in this one. its good don't get me wrong but pretty straight forward. lets see is this develops into something...anything..."
"D- id have to be in the mood to have more than one of these. its sessionable, but the spices would get old pretty quick."
"Poured from bottle to pint glass with absolutely beautiful color! I guess mahogany best describes it. Decent head. Very nice smell and the taste is almost as nice as the appearance. The spice blend is so balanced its hard to depict a dominant flavor. Nice mouthfeel and excellent drinkability. I like it the way it is so I doubt I cellar any. I'm glad I tried it and may buy more although I am anxious to try some other holiday ales. I was a bit suprised at the $10.49 ticket on this beer. But the store I bought from is usually higher than most. Try it it's good!"
"A delicious, complex beer at the tender age of 1. Will purchase more of these for the cellar."
"""Will develop up to five years"" well I'm keeping a couple in my cellar for at least a year. This is a hearty ale by the mighty Goose. Aroma is fairly straightforward consisting some caramel and roasted malts with a thick bitter hoppiness. Wonderful pour, rich mahogony with a thick velvety tan head and lots of sticky lacing. Strong carbonation can barely be seen through the darkness. Strong biting mouthfeel, real creamy and good. Flavor is rich and complex. Roasty with almost a burnt quality countered by a slight sweetness, dark cherries perhaps. A touch of strong coffee makes a quick presence. Nice bittering hops really attack the senses. This signifies what a good winter/Christmas ale can and should be. Nice to settle in with a couple of these when the outside isn't so inviting."
"Taste: Hops, and sweet malts. Tastes alot like a brown ale. Alcohol is there in the aftertaste, making it live up to the style of winter warmer."
"A very drinkable beer. I really like this kind, and I had one last year that I liked as well. Goose Island changes their recipe every year, and the past two years that I have had it I have liked it in different ways."
"A good flavorful beer, but there are better examples of the style."
"Drank pretty easy, a pretty simple winter warmer that makes me want to try this fresher & see what the difference is, still very solid"
"Overall not bad at all. The winter warmer style in general can be hit or miss, and I would say that this one was more hit then miss for sure, but still it was ok. If you are a fan, this one will do good by you."
"Pours a clear maroonish copper color with a big nice beige lasting head. Smell is easily one of the best for a christmas brew yet. Nice vibrant hops are apparent, along with a warm toasty malt presence. Taste is tart, toasty to burnt malt but not roasty, with a finish of tart hops as well. Average body and carbonation. Better than most any I've had in this style. Nice, very drinkable beer."
"This one is easy-to-drink Christmas ale that gets better with every sip."
"Only had a few beers from Goose Island now but they are pretty solid brewery, this beer was not great but pretty darn good for a winter warmer, think this might get better with some age under its belt too, recommended as an above average Christmas ale"
"Overall: a fine example of a winter warmer. Quite dinkable with the right amount of body and spicy edge."
"This wasn't bad. At times it feels like a beefy Brown Ale but the chewy malts and holidays spices definitley give off the warming feel of a Winter Warmer. The drinkibility is good, so you could definitely throw a couple of these back on a cold winter's night."
"The taste is pure sweet caramel malt, some toffee perhaps, and maybe a hint of tropical fruits and a bit of a hop bitterness aftertaste. This is mainly, though a caramel malty beer. Very good."
"Pours a deep ruby brown with a nice sized tan head and decent lacing from top to bottom. Smelled of roasted caramel malts and dark fruits. Taste was nutty and full with a good complexity. Medium bodied mouthfeel with some tartness to it. Overall drinkability was good but I remember this as being a little better in years prior."
"Pours a nice deep red/brownish mahogany with a big tan head that dissipates quickly, leaving behind great lacing. Smells of biscuits, nuts, and some earthy hops. The taste is full of roasted, almost burnt malt with some nuttiness and a piney hop finish. Medium in body with lots of carbonation. It's a good brown ale, but it really doesn't stand out too much amongst the other types of Christmas offerings out there for me to want to seek it out every year at Christmastime."
"It smells malty with a hint of carmel/toffee. It tastes a lot like it smells, which is similar to their nut brown ale. It had a long-lasting aftertaste, more so than an average beer. I had the opportunity to pair this with ribs as well as prime rib and this beer enjoyed their company both times. All in all, wasn't too impressed with this offering, I am putting some in the cellar, as suggested, and we'll see how this is down the road."
"I really like the color, a cloudy brownish amber that almost appears two-shaded--the upper half brown, and the lower amber. There is a subtle spice smell, ginger and some cinnamon; moderate fruit, especially berry; and a roasted finish that I'm fond of. It's very well-balanced, and the carbonation is just right, enhancing the smooth body. Quite well done, and again I'm wanting six instead of one."
"."
"Overall a pretty good winter seasonal brew, especially for a spiced beer which sometimes happen to be over spiced. I could drink one of two of these at a time and I think it would go very well with a Christmas or Thanksgiving dinner especially with ham and the cranberry sauce."
"Not sure if this version is better or if I just appreciate it more. Spicy hop bitterness is more prevalent. Tasty stuff that would probably age well. I would give it more of a 3.7-3.8."
"Right level of creaminess with a crisp finish from the hops. It meanders towards a thinness near the end but recovers nicely. Either my palate has changed or the recipe has. Regardless, I really enjoyed this and a few more wouldn't be unwelcome."
"D- a solid session ale, highly drinkable"
"over all good beer, easy drinking, i expect a little more from a ""christmas ale"" then a normal brown ale. so that was a little let down."
"good beer to drink around the holidays. drank a bunch friday night. will check it out again next year."
"2007 version: Pours dark amber to brown with a light tan head which is large and lingering. Aroma is very faint with hints of crystal malt and a bare touch of hops. Flavor is crystal malts, earthy hops and a nutty character that comes across very nicely. Tail is roasty and sweet malt, with another touch of hops. Very balanced throughout. Really nice brown ale."
"I hope to trade for some more of these before the season is past and I miss the chance. Between this anchor and mad elf, need to hold me off until late 08."
"Pours a clear brown with a dark tan head that faded fast. The smell is malty and sweet with some fruit and hop notes. The taste is big and bold, mixing the malt and hops with other spices thrown in. The finish is fruity followed quickly by a strong hop flavor that lingers leaving some bitterness. The mouthfeel is light, which is surprising considering the big flavor, but the flavor is mixed quite well. This is a beer that packs in some flavor, for those looking for a flavorful Christmas beer, this is a good choice."
"Pours a great two finger head that lasts almost all twelve ounces. The color gets a little browner the further away the light it is. Great lacing holds tight to my Honker's ale imperial pint glass. The aroma is a malty, bread aroma with a light and effervescent hoppiness. The taste makes think of warm fires at a cozy home bar with closefriends. Fruity hints of fruit cake with the toasty maltiness. Smooth and mild on the palate. A great beer to look forward to when drinkngall winter long with your friends and family."
"Overall- It was a nice holiday brew. It seemed fairly complex in its flavor and enjoyable."
"D- one of my favorites for the holidays and probably the most bitter brown ale i've had."
"Drinkability: Being from the Chicago area, this is a beer I always looked forward to at Christmas time. It was simply a fantastic session beer and still is. Aging really contributes little to the beer, but hasnt detracted anything either even after 2 years. (4.0)"
"D: Actually did the review on the second beer of the night. So, the first one went down exceptionally smooth and pretty quickly. The second one is down to 1/4 cup on my Barilla jar, and chances are I'll have one more. Drinkability is very nice. Beer isn't too potent so, a nice and easy buzz is flushing my cheeks. Drink it!!!"
"Velvety smooth and creamy. The moderate carbonation cleans up the slightly syrupy texture but still allows it to lie heavy on the palate and linger a bit. One of my favorite Goose Island selections"
"Good beer for fans of malt, kind of a smaller version of an old ale."
"A year of aging hasn't done too much to this beer. Possibly accented the malt a bit but this seems almost identical to the previous year."
"this beer has a very unique feel to it. It is very nutty, but still goes down smooth like any Brown Ale should. Goose Island never fails in ovffereing a beer that is not hard to drink and no matter how crafty it may seem, it still tastes great. I enjoyed the light brown tone to it, not clear brown, but I wouldn't say cloudy either. A great beer to enjoy anytime, especailly after a hefty meal."
"I'd give it another drink or possibly try aging this beer but overall, I'd say it's a decent beer."
"Malty and nutty flavors as well. I am not sure what makes this a ""Christmas"" beer because I dont taste any spices of other holiday flavors. A decent brown ale altogether. This is certianly a malty, cool weather beer. Very enjoyable."
"Pours a nice brown with some golden hues and a two finger cream colored head with a little lacing on the glass. Aroma of toasted malt, caramel, and a touch of maple. Taste is nutty and toasted with a little cocoa and caramel as well as some slightly spicy hops. Nice brown ale. Nothing spectacular but solid."
"Been a big fan of different Christmas Ale's the past couple of years. This one purs beautiful dark red, and nice creamy head. Lacing continues for awhile. Smells of warm malt. Tastes of roasted malts, finishes slightly bitter, piney hops. Different from the other Chrismas brews that tend to have vanilla, cinnamon, and ginger notes. Also noticed on the rear label says "" Flavor will continue to develop over 5 years"". Cool. Going to celler 4 of them."
"Their website says this can be aged for up yo 5 years so maybe that explains the hops. Overall I was not impressed with the aroma and the flavors out of tune. It becomes a little more balanced as it warms, but still not impressive."
"This one pours a red almost brownish color. Very murky and dark with a 2"" thick creamy, fluffy off white head. Smell is hoppy pine with a rich caramel malt. Taste is sweet malty flavor then a bitter hoppy finish. Smooth, and rich carbonation on this beer too. This was a nice Chrismtas ale!"
"Overall- Let this warm up a bit for a better aroma and taste. Good on a cold night."
"pours a very dark amber copper color with an off white opaque head. smell is complex with lots of hops and malt fragrance presence, also has a nice caramel scent with it. taste is equally intriguing the mouthfeel is thick and rich my favorite. lots of malt taste, with hops and other spices. all around smooth and tasty beer. i recommend"
"very hoppy flavor (wait...english brown?) goes with breadiness and a hint of date. i'm not totally sure what makes this celebratory of xmas"
"Bottle: Poured a clear deep brown color ale with a big foamy head with some average retention and some small lacing notes. Aroma of spices with a big caramel malt profile. Taste is also dominated by a big caramel malt presence with some sweet notes and a strange mixture of spices. Body could have been fuller. Interesting but lacking something to be truly great."
"Poured a nice head that dissipated into a thin layer with a great lacing that sticks to the side of the Imperial nonic. The color is dark brown almost reddish, light and easy to see through. A slightly spicy, alcohol-like, and hoppy smell. Spices and hops fight each other for dominance. The hoppy taste is prevelent and the spicy flavors are in the back ground. It's good as an IPA, but as a ""christmas ale""/brown ale it doesn't fit the description of the style. I still enjoy this and will review it as is. There is a brown-like sourness in the back ground. So it's a hoppy brown ale that's pretty drinkable. Goes down good. Overall I would try this again, if it were available in singles and new...couldn't do a whole six pack when I could just get a IPA or pale ale."
"I really like this, it is malty as can be for a beer it's size, yet there is plenty of hops to balance. However, I keep wishing they made this a little stronger, something around 7% or so would make this a killer strong malty ale. I didn't pick up any spices (which their website says they use), or any hints of chocolate or roast (which I expect in a brown ale), but so be it."
"On the whole this is a pretty nice beer. Better than average holiday style ale at a good price. Not the best, but worth a try."
"In that its a Christmas Ale, this is comparable to a sled ride. You start out looking down the hill and all its splendor, the initial ride starts nice and picks up speed, then you go downhill and no where fast, looking back uphill, climb, same thing again without that initial rush. Don't get me wrong - its tasty and I recommend it - but it is a steady decline from start to finish. A good Winter Warmer, but not in the league of a Sierra Nevada Celebration or a Great Lakes Christmas Ale. That said, its still much better than a lot of cold weather beers, and pairing it with some good, sharp cheddar (or a cheese soup) or a nice, hot deli or bar sandwich would probably help it a lot to balance out the dead spots, and I would recommend as well as drink it again. Certainly worthy of enjoying once a year...give it a ride."
"Into a pint glass, pours a clear, ruby brown with a small light tan head, not much lacing. Aroma is fruity, sweet and spicy malts, a bit of hops. Taste is pretty nice, again, fruity malts, lots of malt backbone, chocolate and roasted.. Herbal hops, spices, pretty nice, good body too, pretty decent overall, nothing special for a winter ale though."
"This beer really grew on me. This was the last beer in the 6-pack. I was completely turned off of the first one but now, I think I will buy another 6er next year. I'm looking forward to it. The sum is greater than its parts."
"D - Very good winter warmer. Different than most...tasted a little like a nut brown ale."
"Full bodied and mouthfeel. Very masculine in nature good balance between malt and hop. Very earthy, and etheral. Dry, however the malt almost creates a mirage effect of sweetness from the dark burnt toffee. Very good and drinkable. Would like too lay a few of these down and see what happens."
"Drinkability was very nice. Goes down smooth and crisp. I don't think putting a Christmast logo and name on a beer makes it a winter warmer, so I'm disappointed about that. But I'm not disappointed in the beer. It was very enjoyable and pretty cheap. See you again next year."
"Overall a very drinkable brew. Well balanced and flavorful."
"Dark brown in color with a light tan head. Cinnamon and spices in addition to the caramel in the aroma. Smoky, malty flavor with a nice spicyness. Medium bodied and nicely carbonated. This has all the flavor you're looking for in a winter warmer and is a nice one to kick back with."
"Descent off white head with a little stick, sits above a nice deep crimson brew. Aromas of chocolate malt, dried fruits, and roasted malts. Nice roasted malt and spice balance in the first sip. The next wave brings notes toffee, caramelized malts, molasses, cocoa, and some fig fruit. Medium hop addition is accentuated by other spice notes and rounds out this beer nicely. Slight metallic flavors hear and there and also a little in the finish but not enough to detract from its better qualities. Medium body mouthfeel that is a little fluffy and coats well. A very drinkable beer especially for how inexpensive it is."
"Bottled 11/29/06. Label states that the flavor will develop over 5 years. Nice looking mahogany color, with some ruby highlights. Fairly clear. Thick fluffy off-white head holds together well. Pale malt, spices, fruits and alcohol in the nose. Darker biscuity flavor, a bit of sweetness, hints of alcohol, nutmeg, and other earthy flavors. Very strong malt character, like a strong ale almost. Not much hop bitterness, but fairly balanced anyway. The hops that do come through seem to be earthy and floral. Very soft, gentile carbonation. A bit lacking in the mouthfeel. As it warms, flavors like a gingerbread cookie seem to come out. Finishes dry. Complex flavors here, I can see how this will develop nicely over the years. Nice!"
"Drinkability: GI's website claims this beer is similar to a brown ale, but to me, it seems more like a hopped up porter, with it's roasty and chocolate flavors. A great nose that previews the flavors that follow. Some winter beers are so overpowering that I have to switch to something else after the first one. Not so with this beer. I could (and did) have several in one night. The brewery claims this beer can be stored for up to five years, but the relatively low ABV (5.4%) suggests otherwise."
"'Tis the season for Christmas ales! I was excited to try Goose Island's Christmas Ale - it's been a year or two since I last had it. Drank this from a 12 oz bottle with a 10/16/06 packaged-on date. Pours a lovely ruby red with a medium, tan head. Excellent retention. Smells of sweet toasted malt, bread, caramel, hints of citrus (maybe orange), clove, cinnamon, plus some nice piny hops. Warm and spicy. The taste surprised me, as the hops really come into play. The spices and malt are present at the beginning of the taste, but the hops bloom on the middle and back of the tongue. Very good mouthfeel - just right for a winter warmer - medium thickness that complements the flavors. A highly drinkable beer - excellent example of the style."
"Drinkability - this is very good, and entirely sessionable, and would be so at any time of the year."
"Deep ruby in color, bordering on chestnut brown, with a slight haze Aroma full of spicy hops, with caramel malt and figs up right behind....beautiful nose. Medium body with notes of fruit cake (esters) slide to nutmeg notes, paired with a spicy hop finish. A wonderful version of a style that is typically dominated by overly spiced beers."
"Goose Island Christmas Ale was ruby-brown in color with good clarity. The light tan head was thick and left sheets of lace behind. The aroma was full of holiday spices and sweet malt. The taste was dark malts, toasty, with some holiday spices and a dry finish. The body was medium-full with just less than medium carbonation. Drinkability is good. This was a good Christmas ale that is not as heavy on the spices as some others I have tried."
"Pours a nice clear dark brown color, some carbonation, nice creamy tan head, lots of nice islands and sticky lacing around the edge. Scents of sweet malts, slight hops, figs, and toffee. The taste is very nice of malts, and toffee. The finish is kinda dry. Medium body. Very drinkable, would recommed for sure, another great beer from GI. Thanks jhammerly for this one."
"Mouthfeel is light to medium for a winter warmer. Easy to drink but not impressive, will not have more of this one."
"Note: My bottle was on the ""mix-a-six"" shelf and was left over from last season. The Goose Island website recomends bottling this one for up to five years. I'll have to pick up some fresh brews and see how they compare."
"Drinkablility- An extremely drinkable seasonal from a fine brewery out of the Windy city. Reccomended!"
"Pretty good; I had a second one of these. And I'd have it again."
"Had on draft at local bar down town Chicago. Pinky nail thin head, with thin spider web lacing. The body was a rich coffee color. Smelled of nice aromatic hops, chocolate, slightly toasted malt. The flavor was nice, really refreshing and drinkable. The medium sweet dark malt balanced very well with mild hop bitterness, and coupled with tasty hints of chocolate. The drink-ability on this is great, especially on tap. Totally an easy going, tasty seasonal beer, I mean its the kind of no frills brew you can drink and have casual conversation over. Needless to say, I know what Ill be drinking next time I go to the Ex checker."
"D- This beer has a smooth dry malt note with a nice spicy hop finish but it didn't really remind me of a winter warmer. Very nice average beer."
"Drinkability is high here and this 6 pack is going down tonight."
"Pours a dark reddish brown with a small head, and little retention or lacing (poured from a bottle into a pint glass). Has a malty smell to it, with a hint of coffee. The taste matches the smell, very malty, has a coffee taste to it. Toasty, and not too bitter. You can definately taste the spices, but they aren't overpowering. Has a heavier feel in the mouth, and not a whole lot of carbonation. Overall, a pretty good beer, but nothing too special. My favorite of the style would have to be the Great Lakes Christmas Ale, which I think nothing compares to."
"Poured into a pint glass from a bottle with a bottling date of Halloween 06. Nice deep mahogany with a two finger head, which slowly shrunk to dense cap and left a OK lace. Nuts, fuit, and pine in the aroma. Sweet maltiness as well. Bitter spiced hops, nice dry finish. Label say it will age for 5 years. I'm going to tuck two away. One of my favorite Goose Island offerings."
"Pours a deep mahogany, with exceptional clarity. A two finger head is pale biege in color and holds very well leaving marvelous spiderweb lacing. Strong vanilla notes in the nose, along with faint roast barley and herbal english hops. Flavor is sweet with dextrin, pale malt, and dark kilned crystal. Dry aftertaste, some weak holiday spice flavors become present, including musty vanilla beans. Timid english hop bitterness somewhat balances the malt sweetness. Medium in body and lightly carbonated, the mouthfeel is silky and smooth. Finish is a bit residual with a hint of vanilla, but mostly clean. At 5.4% ABV,I doubt this is suitable to age for 5 years, nor that it is bottle conditioned as the label states. The spices seem a bit too subdued, and the overall flavor is borderline bland. This would be more interesting with a greater malt/hop/spice depth, and consequently achive a higher drinkability."
"Bottle dated 9/29/05. No light passes through this beer at all. Nice frothy head with lots of lacing. Smells pretty malty sweet. Flavorful and pleasing to the palate. I dont know what to compare the taste to. The mouthfeel seems kind of thin for such a robust beer. Not knowing a whole lot about winter warmers, I'd say this is probably slightly above average."
"This is an easy enough to drink ale. Will be interesting to see just how the flavours continue to develop and evolve. A good session brew for the holidays, and a good crossover brew for introducing novices in beer appreciation to sarker and spicier offerings."
"I can't wait untill January to see this one again, I'm buying a case."
"A nice one-finger head stays firm. Some thick lacing hung around but I was swirling alot. Very intense hop flavor with sweet malt being the lesser flavor on the palate. A nice froth sweetened the brew and released some more malt flavors. This is a 2005 and is still very complex. There is alot packed in there that still needs to age and mellow. Still a good beer and could be a wonderful winter warmer if drunk when new. Cheers!"
"Purchased in bottle in Menomonee Falls, WI. This beer poured an opaque dark tone. It smelled of chocolate covered hops, with a rather unpleasant hint of raw sewage? There was definitely something odd in the smell. The taste was of deeply roasted maltiness, along with a hoppy/piney flavor. Again, chocolate lacings. The mouthfeel overall was thin, and it left a slightly bitter aftertaste. Im curious to try letting this decent beer cellar for a bit next time."
"Opinion: This is a pretty good beer. It is full flavored and comes across as being a lot bigger than it is. It is roasty a bit like a porter, but remains sweet like a English brown ale. This is a good beer, and one that I would drink again."
"This is a rather mediocre beer. I like the flavors they have created with the malt, but they railroaded it with hops. I would love to see more focus on the malt (less hops) and finish a little less dry."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Really good mouthfeel, but the taste kills the drinkability points. I won't be revisiting this again."
"I really like this beer. Caught somewhere between a porter, ipa and holiday ale, it's a beer I could sip by the fire on x-mas eve till Santa comes down the chimney. Then I'd share one with him. :-)"
"Quite surprised I actually found this on-tap in the area..but this club is known for having one Goose Island draft at all times. The nose is big time hops with a hint of spices...the malt creeps in as well, with a caramel character that holds the whole thing together. This is light enough to be highly drinkable, but has a bunch of flavor and can be enjoyed all night. I had a couple of them on-draft and was really surprised by how much I liked it. ""Thinn-ish"" for a winter offering but it's nice to have a punch of hops in the middle of the holiday season. Definitely worth a try."
"as a winter warmer it really isn't warming... tasty? sure as hell it is. The spice might get to me after a few, and since this doesn't 'warm' it might take a few. It almost seems like they just threw in some spice to an APA... not bad perse but there are better WWs out there that fit the style better imo."
"I have to say, this one impressed me. Sure it was thinner than other warmers, but it had all of the flavor. Good stuff Goose."
"Mouthfeel is slightly bitter with a sugary malt that is very light."
"Yum, paired well with sharp cheddar and crackers."
"cheers..."
"Drinkability: nicely drinkable. This can be considered a ""comfort"" beer in the cold weather without being an strong alcohol or heavy bodied bomb."
"Drinkability: This is a decent ale...most likely wouldn't drink this if it wasn't a holiday beverage...like eggnog in that sense...one will surely be plentY"
"Served in a goblet, pours a clear light brown/orange chestnut, small but thick white head, good retention and nice lacing. Smell is malty, fruits (strawberries/kiwi), vanilla, spice and some floral. Taste is malty, with vanilla spice, floral/citrus, and a bitter chocolate finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation. Tasty Christmas beer."
"Overall: A nice example of a Christmas beer that uses spices effectively without letting them get out of control."
"Verdict- Not Goose Island's best offering. It has some appealing flavors, but it's too thin-bodied to be exceptional."
"Aroma of dark caramel, sweet citrusy fruit, piney hops, spruce essence and hints of roasted barley. A year in the cellar has reduced hop bitterness that would have balance the caramel and biscuit + other malts. Light body medium mouthfeel. Finishes lightly sweet. This ale would benefit from more body."
"THE BLOODHOUND FACTOR: Neither hound seemed interested. Same feeling as their master."
"A rich caramel coffee slides into a quite bitter finish. This is clearly well-made beer, but the alcohol makes itself a little too well-known for my tastes. I will probably stow one of these and come back to it in a year."
"A fine crack at a winter warmer. The back informs that this one can be laid down for up to 5 years, and I bet giving it a year would really bring the flavors together. Not too heavy, real malty and medium carbonation, but with the warming alcohol and slick malt balance, ends up as a brew where 1 wouldn't be enough and 6 would be the max."
"this one is just ok, not the best goose island beer i've had"
"Another good winter warmer for the cold weather outside. This is my second beer from Goose Island and I look forward to trying their other offerings."
"D: This beer isn't particularly amazing, but overall, it adds up to a great beer. The spice is subtle, unlike many other christmas ales that I've had, and at $10.99 for a 12 pack, this has quickly become my session beer for the season."
"12 ounce bottle sampled (Just missed this one on tap at the Blind Tiger..rats..) Bottled on dating (bottled less then a month ago) and label tells me this will ""continue to develop over 5 years"" !Anyway this is a good looking and good tasting winter brew. Dark Honey almond in color with a long lasting tan head, leaves gobs of fine lacing. Nose is bready malts and light spice. Malty smooth brew, pleasingly flavorful and satisfying. With notes of caramel, oatmeal cookies. Softly rounded on the tongue. Very nice christmas/winter sessioner."
"Nice solid brew. Deep malt backbone, light hop bitterness that is just present enough to keep you thirsty for more. Slender sand head, mildly clingy. Caramel is the overriding aroma. Coffee with caramel syrup makes up the bulk of the flavor. Slightly smoky. Orange peal finish. This is a concrete beer with a great price. Its really quite a steal."
"The mouth is creamy upfront but turns bitter and dry as the hops take over. Very sessionable, this beer reminds me of another hoppy winter seasonal: SNCA"
"Very easy to drink. If only there was a little higher ABV."
"12 ounce bottle. Goose Island Christmas Ale pours out a dark brown color, close to the color of cola. The one inch head fades rapidly. Nutty aroma with grassy hops and spice. Malty flavor with cocoa and spices. A little astringent. Hoppier than I expected. I enjoy the malty flavor in this beer, and it's not over spiced like so many other Winter beers. Mouthfeel is medium. The balance and the small bubble carbonation make this beer quite drinkable. Good version."
"Notes: The description of this year's batch claims that it is based upon an IPA recipe. While the hops here are present, I think the dark malts have overwhelmed the hop flavors and aromas. This is a tasty beer, definately session style. Better on draft than in the bottle."
"Overall: Sweet, but not too sweet. This would be a great beer for a Chirstmas party. If kegs were available I could easily see this being the beer for the evening."
"Drinkability: This a good brew to sit a kick back on a cold day or night."
"The mouthfeel is a bit thin but quite crisp and refreshing. I could ask for something a bit heavier for a winter warmer, but this is a damn good drinkable beer. It is a christmas flavored beer with the spirit of a lawnmower summer beer."
"Medium bodied and delicious, this is one of Goose Island's finest brews."
"Taste improves greatly when less cold. Chocolate hints and a touch of molasses ring through more. Hoppy finish."
"Very drinkable, smooth and rich. Definitely worth a try."
"A nice nose of currants and raisins when poured. The usual thin head, but thats not important. Deep, dark red, with a scotch-like malt profile, some smokiness of cigar tobacco and old chair leather. Slight touch of holiday spiciness, but not overdone like other holiday beers, in fact it may come entirely from the yeast and hops. A very fine beer."
"Impression: I think the beer wants to be a porter when it grows up. But, still prefer it to most brown ales that I have tried. Not Goose Islands best."
"Pours a very mahogony with some red tinting and a thin white-ish head. About the color of cola, maybe a little darker. Aroma of yeast, bread, sweet caramel with some citrous. Taste is pretty malty, but balance by some citric and almost lemony bitterness. Starts off chocolately and roasted, moving to caramel and some other sweetness. A little spice is perceived before moving into the bittering hops. This is a good fairly easy drinking winter brew (even though I am drinking this in April)."
"Chestnut brown with caramel highlights where light gets through, a thick one-inch high oatmeal-colored head rises up quickly and hangs out for a while, slowly falling down to a thin lacey cap that rises up at the edges of the glass. Smell is dark and intense, drawing me closer - dark roasty malt, caramel and raisin, brown sugar and molasses, just a bit of bitter chocolate. Full and chewy mouthfeel ushers in a rich flavor of powdery cocoa, some tangy raisin, caramel and toffee, perhaps a hint of cherry. Slightly hoppy tingly finish, dry and crisp, a bit tannic. Interesting winter warmer, a little lower ABV than others I've had, but a very enjoyable beer."
"Easily one of their best brews."
"Pretty drinkable and approrpiate for a seasonal spiced beer."
"12oz. bottle: This beer pours a clear, caramel color. Mine had very little head on it. The aroma is a little nutty and spicy, as well as having some roasted malts in there. The taste is somewhat roasty, nutty, spicy, with a little hopiness thrown in the background. A nice brew."
"Drinkability: Highly drinkable. Worth repeating."
"Drinkability and Overall: I'm not a WInter Warmer fan, and this wasn't bad at all. Tasty, and not too strong and overpowerful. The spiciness towards the end really started to bother me, and made me not want to drink another one that much. A simple, solid brew."
"Note: It is much better on-tap. I need to review it."
"Drinkability: A very well balanced and thought out beer. Well made, although one would not to imbibe too many at a setting and OD."
"The beer pours a deep garnet, topped with a thick, taupe head. Great lacing, leaving rings all the way down the glass. Great clarity. The aroma features rich, cocoa tinged caramel, with a girth of herbal, citric, aromatic hops. I was expecting spices, but there's nothing aside from real, unadulterated beer. The first sip reveals a milder malt base, flecked thoroughly with coffee, diminishing quickly before the hops. A bittersweet mocha flavor shrinks into the finish, overtaken by citric, herbal hopping. Nice and hoppy in the finish, the bitterness more than enough to balance the malt. Hoppy bitterness in the aftertaste, along with a powdery, dry cocoa malt flavor. Yum. I'd be happy with a sixer of this. I wouldn't last very long, I tell you wut."
"Beer is good. Happy Winter Ale beering."
"Mouthfeel has a good body and creaminess...a pleasure to consume. I could easily sit down to a sixer of this on a cold winter night. Just a damn fine brew and a must try from Goose Island."
"No noticable difference from the draft version. These bottles should age well for a couple of years."
"This is quite tasty, but it seems a little harsh in the finish, I will have to try a couple more of these, especially since this one started out 5 to 10 degrees too cold."
"Goose Island is one of my favorite breweries, but I must admit I'm a bit dissapointed with this years Christmas Ale. While it is most definately not a bad brew, it just didn't live up to my expectations."
"Palate is a wonderful combination of pine and malt with citrus and bitters that will surely complement any holiday feast."
"I have to say I'm disappointed with this offering from GI. There are better, more warming beers of this style out there. While not a bad brew, I wouldn't buy again, unless part of a ""pub pack""."
"Spice beer without noticeable spice in taste. Malty including a degree of chocolate malt and chocolate syrup. Nice brown appearance with lace. good carbonation. Nothing too special and par for this brewery. Thanks Woolfs at Doug Shoemaker super tasting."
"Overall a fine ale, one which could find a place at my table year round, not just at the holidays. But then, what fun would that be?"
"The label says 'Flavor will continue to develop over five years'- I'd better sttock up!"
"12oz. bottle poured into a snifter. It pours a deep reddish brown color with one finger of light tan head. There is minimal lacing left on the glass. The smell is very nutty, almost smells exactly like a nut brown. Bits of caramel and toffee as well. The taste is sweet and malty, with more caramel and nut flavors coming through. Sweet at first, with a slightly dry finish. The mouthfeel is fairly thick and smooth. The drinkability is good as well. A well rounded winter warmer."
"This is one of my favorite winter beers. Like I said, I don't care for the heavy spice hitters, so this is a nice break from all that."
"Final Thought: This is a wonderful seasonal by one of the best breweries in this country."
"Notes: This tasted very fresh and raw to me. Which I guess it should since the bottle states it was born on 10/25/04. I'm interested to see how the aging will affect this finely crafted beer."
"This holiday beer is a reddish-brown color with a thin dark beige head that dissapeared pretty fast. Thin, stringy lacing. The aroma is pleasantly roasty and malty, with a bit of spice thrown in. The flavor is hard to categorize, as it has elements of a Belgian and an Alt. Fruit, malt, spice and caramel flavors are all there. The finish is sweet fruit with a touch of hops. Overall this is a good beer for the holidays."
"On tap at the Wrigleyville location. Definately my favorite winter warmer I've had to date, and I've sampled a few in my day. The beer poured a dark brown with ruby hues and just a coat of head over top of the beer. The nose was very deep caramel with notes of coffee. There was deep, deep hop in there. Damn it smells good. The flavor was great. Full of huge flavors, big well blended hop, big caramel sweetness and hints of coffee. I love it. The feel was big and thick, coating my mouth. The beer is overall very good. Its easydrinking and smooth. Goes down without hesitation. Just like I want it to be."
"Good, but not great. Fairly drinkable, other than that lingering bitterness."
"The color is a nice brown with some redness. The head is tan and thick but fades quickly. The smell is of roasted malt, chocolate, and a hint of baking spices. It tastes like it smells. Nice and malty, not bitter at all. The mouthfeel is a little thin, but this is a very good, extremely drinkable beer."
"This beer pours a brown color with a large head that sticks around and leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma has a small coffee smell and a nice spicy character. Nutmeg maybe. The flavor is of roasted malts/coffee, a small amount of fruit, and plenty of spices. Nice and balanced. Medium mouthfeel and good drinkability."
"Dark chestnut body with amber edges and a frothy, light tan head. Nice. Smells of bready, sugar-tinged malts, minty spruce-bough hops, and a little Scotch tape. Nice caramel roll malt base starts out and gets accented by those sprucey, scotch tape hops. Hops aren't huge, but the finish is bitter with residual cake batter sweetness. Medium bodied, with slightly chewy malts. A pretty good xmas beer."
"2012-Website now says brewed with Pale, Munich, Caramel and hops/IBU which changes from year to year, and 7.3% ABV. Still a really nice beer, like an imperial brown with a finish of leather, nuts, with some floral soapiness and a spicy finish. Lots of great 2-row husk taste."
"Comments - One of my favorite seasonals that I have had this past winter. I may have only had one bottle of this great brew, but given the opportunity I would drink plenty of more. Thanks again to Chilidog for the great brew."
"The pour provided a ruby color with basically no head. A little disappointing. Smell was of fruit and maybe some spices, but I thought this wasn't supposed to be spiced. Taste was unintruding and quite simple, but good as well. Slightly sweet flavors of caramel and coffee upfront. Grainy in the middle and alcohol tasting towards the end. The body was too thin for my liking but this wasn't a bad beer by any means. Not really a Christmas Ale, in the traditional sense, but something I would go back to again."
"Thanks CRJM."
"Drinkability - These were a pleasure to drink. Very enjoyable and a nice surprise to find tucked away in my storage well after Santa had retreated northward."
"This Goose pours a clear, red mahogany with a thin beige head that quickly fades into even lacing of patches and sheets. Aroma begins with caramel, with a spice background, then evolves into a prominent bouquet of citrus and floral hops. Mouthfeel has moderate carbonation, and a mild, spicy bite on the tongue. Taste is dominated by sweet caramel malt, with cinamon and nutmeg in the background. As it warms up, there seems to be an abundance of fresh, green hops that lend a citrus balance. I've gotten this fresh, green, hoppiness from other Goose Island brews, as well, and find it very pleasant. Well balanced, overall, and has very good drinkability for a Christmas seasonal ale, due to the restrained use of the spices."
"This is an average to above average beer that can now occupy considerable shelf space in my fridge because I was able to find it for $9.99 per 12-pack. That's a bargain!"
"Appearance: Deep ruby brown with a nice moccha colored head leaves nice collar of lacing not bad. Aroma: Smells piney, with hints of nutmeg and other Christmas spice deep malt toastiness seems winter warming to me, hast the right color. Taste: A nice piney hop presence rides a wave of toasted malts with hints of spice and chocolate making for an enjoyable holiday inspired ride. Mouthfeel: Medium to full bodied ale with mellow carbonation to form an interesting mouthfeel and nice smooth but syrupy texture. Drinkability: The piney earthy flow found in the middle of the malt wave is most impressive keeps my taste buds wanting more."
"Christmas Ale is another solid offering from Goose Island, but I've had better wintertime brews. I'll have no trouble at all waiting until next holdiay season to drink it again."
"This is one of their best offerings."
"Thanks for the late Xmas present BigHuge. Nice one."
"It poured dark amber with a nice tan head that laced down the sides of the glass. It smelled lightly of citrusy/flowery hops. The taste matched the citrusy flowery aroma but had a distinctly more bitter flavor. It starts to finish with a nutty malt flavor but completely finishes with more of the bitter hop tones. A nice beer, but not one I could drink a lot of."
"This beer has a very nice mouthfeel. For some reason, it seems quite Guinness-y at times. I think that the ABV is a nice touch at 5.5% - this beer is very sessionable and i've danced with that the last three nights. The more you get down, you start to get a bit annoyed by the slight sweet-bitterness character of the beer, but overall quite good!"
"1/10/04-Really getting some brown sugar notes on the nose....and buds....tasty....downgraded scores slightly after having several more...stil lvery good..."
"Pours a red brown color with a medium sized head. Smells deeply of piney, hops. The taste is not quite what I'd expect for a spiced holiday beer. There's very little spice that I notice - maybe a dash of cinammon or nutmeg, but mostly this tastes like an average version of an IPA, because there's plenty of hops in this beer. I'd be curious to taste this next to the Goose Island IPA and see if I can notice a difference."
"By the time I finish I've parsed out the taste a bit more. First comes a round, slightly creamy and medicinal flavor with a hint of cherry. Quickly the carbonation kicks in. The finish is bitterly tangy, smoky, and again slightly medicinal. At the end I realize that a vaguely syrupy apricot/plum flavor presides over most of the taste. This is quite an impressive Christmas offering, and the second Goose Island beer I'm desperately hoping to find in bottles!"
"Found this at a favorite east-side pizzaria of all places... Can't tell if this beer is superbly integrated or just too muddled. Well settled brew with a mild herbal tea and fake caramel. Not terribly well spiced as far as I can tell. Derives a lot of flavor from roasted malts -- bready, caramel, chocolate. But they're not really distinct flavors or even significant impressions. It's more of a stew of flavors. Finishes with a unique hop footprint and a malt-driven sweetness."
"The same reddish-brown color my friend JohnnyP describes so perfectly. Dull beig head. Bubbles and fades quickly with a slight hint of ruby along the edges. The aromas is a hodge-podge of spices, nutmeg, hints of cinnamon, and musty earthyness to it. Tastes are along the same lines, but muddled. Dusty shoe leather treated with cinnamon and nutmeg. Flavors are muddled, and earthy, they don't seem very crisp and none really stand out. Medium bodied, and easy to drink. I think they just tried to do too much with the flavors on this one."
"This poured into the glass with a color that resembled dark brown leather. The head disappeared fairly quickly. As far as smell goes, I was hoping for a little more coming out of a Christmas-style ale. There were tiny hints of nutmeg, but I was hoping for more coriander. Goose Island is a very good brewery, but I was really hoping for more out of this brew. It is an excellent brown ale alone, but since I love winter beers, this one wasnt the best of the season. Happy Honkerdays!"
"This is a dark beverage with an amber hue coming through the majority of it. It smells like a bundle of stuff, leaving me with a candy-like scent. There is a lot going on with the taste, i like the well blended in hops that hits my tounge first. Its got some sweet malty elements, candy like and other spices are involved. Id say give this goose a try."
"ng"
"Piney with light hop aroma, predominant rich malt smell too. Light, small carbonation throughout, though seems a bit prickly when held in mouth for extended period. Slight carmel taste as warms. Some have reported it as watery, though mine seemed to have a pretty average mouthfeel. Swished to the back of the mouth/tongue, a citrus hop taste peaked through until the ultimate swallow. Really a nice beer, will be buying the 2003 release. I would expect it to be a good beer to offer in a group setting."
"Nice red brown color. Beer smells spicy, floral, with a little bit of alcohol. Tastes very full and delicious, with a good amount of hops to finish off the flavor. One of the best winter brews I have tried, give Goose Island a try, if you haven't ever."
"Carbonation is perfect for style and the drinkablity is very good."

"Decent looking ale, deep garnet-brown with a dense tan head and good retention. Nice malt aroma, roasted barley with a hint of smoke. Has some hop aroma there as well. Flavor is less impressive, smoky malt and slightly bitter. Finishes dry. Good mouthfeel, medium bodied. Nothing exceptional, but a decent brew."
"Drinkabilty: This beer has gotten smokier over the years. I remember it being a lot more sweet maltiness and very little smokiness. Not one of my favorite holiday beers anymore, but still worth a try if you can."
"i thought this beer was too heavy and too filling. not enough jollyness or christmas cheer. not bad though"
"Good deep chestnut color accompanied by a very ample head that features very solid lace. Quite roasted aromatics with some chocolate coffee and raisin. The mouth feel is medium and nicely viscous and creamy as well. In the mouth raosted caramel malt, raisin and decent balancing hop. Finishes with a touch of burnt carmel. A rather solid, yet not awe inspiring goose."
"This beer's appearance consisted of a small sized creamy tan head with fine-small sized bubbles that mostly diminished. The body was opaque and free of carbonation with a brown hue. The nose was mildly malty with caramel notes and the same was true for the flavor. The mouthfeel was smooth, thin and watery texture and medium bodied. The lacing was fair"
"This beer poured a dark red colour with a nice head. The aromas were very malty and spicy with some hops in the background. The taste was the same as the aroma. Malty, with some spices and hops in the background as well. I'm not sure what GI are trying to go for with this brew, but whatever they are attempting to do, this is a pretty tasty, little holiday brew that has a nice mouthfeel and a good drinkability level!"
"2002 version - Medium red color, medium head. Roasted malts, hoppy and slightly spicy. Full flavored, complex taste. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is smooth and clean. Aftertaste is slightly malty and sweet. Very nice beer. Slightly sweeter and a little spicier than the 2000 vintage."
"Pours a dark amber with a thick head, a nice aroma of malts, citrus and some spices make this one eager to try. Some thin roasted malts, mild hops and a some citrus and fruit are noted up front. Medium to full bodied, incredible flavor, some cloves, banana and spices are noted towards the end, with the hops dominating. Tasty, filling, rich and awesome. Everything expected from this awesome winter brew!"
"Cloudy pale copper color and of hazy reddish tone nearer to the top which is adorned by a rich creamy head of froth about an inch high and colored of dark ivory. Head retains its thick body to settle a bit with a lumpy top and lots of lace in big blotches, looks scrumptious! Smells faintly of citrus and floral hops with a light backing of roasted caramel malt. Taste is more of the same, but more prominent with great mellowing and smooth caramel malts that are a touch candyish sweet and has some citrusy mild hops balanced in perfectly and a lightly drying finish. Good solid medium body and pretty full in each gulp, very nice. One excellent brew, if it weren't so soft in the aroma this would have favored a higher overall rating, but with that aside, everything else is solid and well done. Right up there with SN Celebration."
"Good fruity aroma upon opening the bottle. A moderately think light tan head forms when started down the side of the glass and finished down the middle. The head quickly dissipates to leave a slight ring around the glass. The flavor is hoppy with a slighly sharp edge and a moderate amount of carbonation. I could imagine enjoying this beer slightly warmer that my sampling and in front of the fireplace with any type of rich Irish food possibly around Christmas time, hence the beer Christmas Ale is named well."
"Very good Christmas time ale..good winter beer!!"
"This was pretty good stuff. Not earth shattering, but highly quaffable."
"Anyway, Christmas has a lightly chocolaty, fruity flavor that feels cool in the mouth and finishes quite long. Not very bitter, though the hops contribute to a juiciness in the finish thats reminiscent, though not anywhere near as intense as the juiciness in SN Celebration. Very well balanced, actually... The dryness of the aromatic malts provides an interesting juxtaposition against the sweet, lingering finish creating a memorable beer all around. Another excellent offering from Goose Island"
"Medium brown in color with a thick tan head that leaves good lacing. The aroma is of roast caramel malts, with hints of chocolate. The flavor is spicy, bready, with bits of chocolate. It is medium bodied, and has an alcoholic finish. It is a relatively easy drinking brew even though it is up there in the alcohol content. It was an enjoyable brew, I would drink it again."
"Pours a hazy, deep mahogany body with a creamy light tan head that holds well and leaves some nice lace throughout the glass. The aroma is cocoa-ish and mildly fruity with a soft background spiciness (piney hops?). The body is medium and creamy in the mouth from a very fine and natural carbonation. The flavor takes an interesting turn with a sweet fruitiness and some citrusy and piney hops atop a lightly syrupy maltiness. A distinct caramel note is revealed as it warms in the mouth, and some chocolatey character remains but it also picks up a roasted edge that combines with a firm bitterness in a dry and lingering, mildly roasty finish. Very nicely done with a good amount of complexity. Interesting and enjoyable. Best enjoyed slightly warmed. Well worth trying."
"Pours a hazed copper/brown color with a nice 2-finger light tan head. The smell of fresh baked bread, light hops, and alcohol are present. The taste reveals light spicing and more fresh baked bread/biscuit flavor with roasted malts being dominant. The well-balanced hops and light alcohol warming make for a perfect blend for this holiday brew. It is light to medium bodied brew and finishes with a dry hop and spice. Very nice brew! Thanks to budgood1 for sending this brew! Cheers!"
"Dark, clear red-amber brew with a solid, bready-looking head (like the surface of very grainy breads, during baking). Head is pretty persistent. Not much carbonation apparent in the body. Smell is sweet and malty, with light spicy/herbal hop notes, and a rather nice biscuity undertone. Very malty flavor, but not sweet. Spicy hops and bready yeast notes balance the malt throughout. Finish is very hoppy and herbal. Smooth mouthfeel, but could be a bit richer. A fine offering for winter."
"Had this a couple years ago and it had a smokey flavor was not that good. This years brew is a lot better."
"Pours a slightly cloudy amber with a thin white head that leaves some lace on the glass. Aroma is sweet... carmel and biscuity malts with pine and herbal aromas. Flavor begins with some carmel sweetness, but is by no means cloying. Becomes somewhat grassy... then finishes with a healthy dose of pine. (I was actually burping pine for a couple of hours after this one.) All flavors are kept very well in balance. Body is slightly thin for the style and carbonation is medium. This is a very drinkable winter warmer, and is one of the more impressive beers in Goose Island's lineup. Very well done!"
"Goose Island Christmas Ale: A hazy, tan beer. My pour had little head, but what there was stayed, and left very nice lacing. The aroma is very pleasant, with hints of cinnamon. I really am enjoying this beer, it has a spicy, sweetness, with hints of several traditional Christmas spices. Very nice malts, with an understated raison bread quality. Very crisp mouthfeel, with an extremely long lasting/warm aftertaste. Very pleasant. I’ll look for this on tap, and so should you."
"2002 Christmas Ale. Poured a muddy brown with a light tan head that never completely goes away. Aroma consists of chocolate malt, sweet cinnamon and spicy hops. Midtones favor a roasted maltiness and mild sweetness that builds up to a layered finish. The finish at first has a nice chocolate malt taste with hints of nut that transcend into an almost ghost-like smokiness that lingers for a bit before fading. A pretty good holiday ale that's not too sweet or spicy."
"pours out a chilled, hazy ruby color. big foamy head diminishes to a bit of fine lace. huge citrus and pine hop aroma is followed by whiffs of malt and spice and everything nice. tastes of sweet belgian type malts, gingerbread, and lots of juicyfruit hops with hints of caramel and cocoa. no alcohol is detected in the flavor profile. full mouthfeel is as smooth as can be, making it extremely easy drinking. mega citrusy hops are mostly for flavor rather than bitterness, leaving a somewhat fruity aftertaste. for a relatively spicy, high alcohol brew, it has a uniquely refreshing and highly dangerous drinkable quality to it. i really like this brew. after a few of these it would be extremely easy to find yourself singing ""tis the season to be jolly...."""
"Garnet hue with brilliant clarity, topped by a slowly receding creamy light tan bumpy head. Wake of loose lace. Dark caramel, sweet citrusy fruit, piney hops, spruce essence and hints of roasted barley sharpness in aroma. Not unlike spiced wort aromawise. Trace, pleasant diacetyl butterscotch as well. Wave of smooth malt sweetness upfront yields to a combination of moderate hop and perhaps citrus rind bitterness. Mellow roasted barley bitterness persists as an undertone. A bit light in body, but this allows for excellent drinkability. Citrusy hop flavor and dryish biscuit malt nudge in mid palate. Finishes smooth, clean and lightly sweet. A soft, well balanced and highly drinkable strong ale. With greater body this would be top notch."
"2002 edition. It pours a deep amber in the glass with an off-white head that maintained 1/2 inch throughout consumption. The smell reminds me very much of candied fruit with a touch of citrus. Taste is fruity (and just a tad bit tart) with some caramel sweetness. Malt is slightly dominant. It's a little bit thin for a holiday brew but otherwise very good. A good session holiday beer."
"Beautiful, dark ruby color, cream-colored head, thick and sturdy. Aromatic, soft and spicy, floral notes,nuts, sweet fruits. Full body, sits thick in the mouth. Warm, but not too strong. Tilted to malty side, but hops play their part. Great winter ale, but not as dark and stormy as I prefer."
"Slightly hazed (bottle-conditioned) darker amber, head is 1/8 of an inch and has three primary bubble sizes. Slightly hoppy aroma. Nicely ""American"" profile to the flavor, peppery and cinnamon malty flavors with a citrusy hop that kicks in mid-mouth and helps close the impression. Nice beer, good balance, interesting flavor, and refreshing incorporation of big hops. Maybe slightly thin in body. Another of six or so Winter beers that will give me plenty of variety for my moods this holiday season."
"Pours a nearly clear amber with some tones of red (for the season, we'll call them cranberry). Head is minimal but laces nicely. Crisp, warm scent that hints of pie spices. Those tones are less strong in the taste than one might expect, but Goose Island gets it right again with a well-integrated brew. Smooth, sweet start with a hoppy middle and warm finish. Mouthfeel and drinkability are good as well."
"A very nice Christmas offering. Pours out to a dark ruby in the glass with a decent head. The aroma had a slight yeast smell to it with light fruit. Taste is very malty with a slight plum taste. A good beer to enjoy on a cold evening."
"2002 Christmas...A nice deep cranberry-red body color topped with a light sandy tan head that is alittle short-lived before it sets into a slight film. Lace is alittle low. The aroma greets every taste first. Its strong hoppy ( I agree, an IPA like compair by other reviews ) aroma & taste of alcohol adds to a very smooth warming drink. Mouthfeel is left dry but the strength of the brew coats well and leaves you wanting more. Santa would find this very drinkable!!"
"Nice enough winter brew."
"2. Best Before: 05/19/03 Tasted: 1/17/03"
"Nice orange/amber hue.  Good malt taste.  No bad off flavors here.  Very inviting.  Some hops on the nose.  Solid winter brew.  Easy to drink."
"Nice aroma marked by malt qualities, with notable hop aroma.  Foamy and persistent head, that thins eventually, but remains somewhat lacey.  Brown and clear with garnet hues present.   The  alcohol is present in the taste.  Malty flavor overall, with a little sweetness, but not too much.  As with the aroma, the taste carries the hop qualities, mostly in the middle.  Finishes with some dryness, especially as the beer warms. Mouthfeel may be a little thin for style.  This is a nice seasonal beer."
"I think I've been spoiled by some of this brewery's other fine products to expect too much.  This was good, but I was expecting more pizzaz.  Moderate body, with a restrained dose of Goose Island's signature hops.  Fairly light for what I expect of a winter seasonal, but smooth and easy to drink."
