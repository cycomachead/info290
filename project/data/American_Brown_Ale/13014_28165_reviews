"Very dark brown. Slight coffee odor, malt and biscuit. Richer than many Brown ales I've encountered. Good dark beer when transitioning to spring time"

"I still think Bell's Best Brown is my favorite ""session brown", but Bender is right up there—being a little less complex, and weaker in its bite, while at the same time having a plusher texture and nice, porridge-like grist, thanks to the oats in the malt-bill.  It's rare, regardless, to try a brown that coheres to stylistic constraints and simultaneously refreshes the palate, but Surly hits that svelte mark."

"Nice brown, but lacking real depth of malt character. Just a tad."

"O-all      Very good brown, lightness of smell and crisp/clean flavor profile makes it a good food friendly beer. Easy drinking brown ale for a day long good time."

"An easy drinking brown ale with desert characteristics and some porter to it.  Only being a 5%abv it drinks nicely.  Brown sugar is the first notion with raisin quickly following Carmel aftertaste.  Great beer to have with a steak or some pecan pie or nothing at all ;)"
""
""
"O: Im not too sure what to say about this one. On one hand it is  one of the better brown ales I have had, but on the flipside, I don't think that is saying much. I was expecting something unique from Surly, something that would stand above the crowd, but instead it is simply an above average brown ale."

""

"My first brew from Surly, and I'm left impressed. Brown ales in my past experience were just... brown ales. This beer adds something exciting with the vanilla flavor it has, and the feel is fantastic. If you're a bit down on brown ales, try this one out, because it's certain to show you just what the style is capable of. The price of $3.29 for a single can is a bit high, but it's 16oz, and of great quality -- so keep that in mind."
"Dark brown to light black in color and essentially impenetrable to light.  Brussels lacing.  There's a miniscule layer of khaki colored head but it only covers about a third of the top of the beer.  Luscious aroma of chocolate and dark malt greets my nose.  The flavor is full of dark malt and caramel.  The mouth is light and fairly quaffable considering the amount of flavor packed into this beer."

"Deep, dark brown in color, but pretty much translucent when held to the light; a medium-sized tan head receded to a collar, leaving some lacing on the glass. Malt-driven aroma, toasted bread, cocoa, herbal hops. In the taste, caramel malts, pumpernickel, herbal/floral hop notes, nutty, with hints of cocoa, mineral, earth. I'm not a big fan of brown ales, but this one is much more complex than most. Medium body, average carbonation, and overall pretty drinkable for the style. I enjoyed this much more than its over-coffee-fied alter-ego."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A top notch brown, which is one of my favorite styles.  If I had more ready access, this would be a central player on my beer line-up.  Instead it makes a special treat that I'll be sure to pick up whenever I make it to Chicago or Minnesota."

"Overall, I consider this one to be a curious case. This is the second can of this that I've had. The first one was a bit fresher. I'm not liking it as much this time around. The aroma and taste seem a bit milder this time around."

"For me, it's that velvety oat mouthfeel that defines this universally liked beer. It does have just enough hops and is not too heavy in the mouthfeel such that I was able to enjoy it on a summer evening. A beer worthy of drinking again and again, but there are a wide variety of brown ales that would offer a different and also worthy drinking experience."

"Looks good like a brown ale should, but after that is pretty unremarkable. The taste is fine but the texture of the beer is somewhat thin for a brown ale. I expect a bit more chewiness. The scent, like the taste, is fine - a bit of coffee and a slight toastiness - but not overpowering. Seems like an easy-drinking, summer version of the style. A decent beer but not something I'll look for again."

"O - Excellent brown ale, nice subtle complexity, good feel to it."

"Thanks to VDubb, I finally got around to trying the coffee-less version of Bender. It pours a clear sunset topaz topped by a finger or so of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises mild graham cracker, grass, flowers, and a touch of Oreo. The taste focuses on the grass, flowers, and mild lemon peel, all to the detriment of the grain-y, biscuit-y base. Basically, they took the ""American"" label stereotype and ran with it, over-hopping what may have been a nice enough brown ale. A shame, really. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slick-ish feel. Overall, this brown just didn't sit right with me. It's too hoppy for its own good, and those grains mentioned in the blurb above don't come through at all. I wanted to like this stuff, especially given my love of Coffee Bender, but I guess I'll just stick with the coffee-infused version for the duration."

"I honestly wasn't expecting this to be my first Surly beer, but I am glad it was. This is a well-made beer: balanced, semi-hoppy for the style, and quite drinkable. It isn't the best brown ale I have ever had, or most ""Americanized", but it was damn tasty. Worth a shot for sure."
""
""
"O: Excellent Brown Ale that is extremely drinkable and very enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Brought a 4-pack of cans home from MN. Wasn't a big fan after the first two cans. Last two cans grew on me. Very similar to Bell's Best Brown Ale but I do prefer that one to this one. Not too shabby though."

"O-nice flavor and balance, easy drinking and enjoyable session beer"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A nice brown ale but it was a little too light on the body for me. A little more really could have let the darker tones showcase themselves more and add some complexity. But this is an easy drinker with some really nice malty tones."
"O - wow, really good brown ale. I've had this before but I enjoyed it even more this time around. Definitely a must try. I can't wait for another!"
""
""
""
"In the end, the beer has an extremely light body. The notes don't quite fire for a substantial brown ale."
""
""
"This is a great beer! I could definitely have more when I'm looking for a malt bomb that is creamy and refreshing. Perhaps the most traditional beer Surly has brewed, it's definitely my favorite brown ale brewed in the country. Of all the malt forward beers Surly has played around with, this is definitely their most successful."

"Surly Bender ---4/5."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O/D-Not as aggressive as I was expecting but I did enjoy it. A bit overrated here in my opinion. It's high-point would definitely be its drinkability."
"Bottom Line: Always worth a try since it hits about 10 different beer styles. That said I'd get a draft or a single can over a 4pk unless you're really into browns or Surly and can't get it easily in your area."

"Overall: A good example of what a brown ale could be. The dark bread notes with that nutty sweetness and coffee were a stand out for me. I wouldn't mind a little more body, though. Overall well put together. Recommend to all brown ale lovers and haters."
"YUM; SEEK IT OUT!"
""
""
"Pours a dark brown with a nice one off-white head. Smell is roasted malts, carmel, coffee and chocolate, not a very strong nose. Taste is creamy roasted malts, coffee and chocolate with a slight bitterness. Medium bodied with mid to low carbonation. Overall a very good beer. Not a huge fan of this style, but I could drink this one regularly."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not as good as everything else I've had from the Surly line up, possibly their weakest entry. However, that's not really a bad praise, since Surly's line up is rather fantastic. I'd say this is definitely worth a try - but recommend going straight to the Coffee Bender."
""

""
"O: 4.75/5. I've never drank a perfect beer, but coming from an IPA guy, this comes damn close."
""
""
"Pours a dark brown with a thick off-white head with good retention. Moderate lacing. Aroma of roasted malts and biscuit followed by chocolate and caramel notes. Great earthy aroma. Roasted malt hits the palate first, followed up by a sweet oat flavor, reminiscent of brown sugar on hot oatmeal. Very smooth and complex. Oats give this brown ale a thick, rich mouthfeel. Great carbonation. Extremely drinkable. Finishes dry and slightly bitter. Overall, one of the best brown ales I’ve ever had!"
"Pours a very dark brown that is almost black actually. Had a 1-finger tan head that lasted a bit. LOTS of lacing was seen with each sip. The aroma of roasted malt hits your nose up front with a slight coffee smell. The taste was pretty much the same with some sweet spice (?) and very smooth. Went down very easy. Overall it was great and hense a 2nd tasting (16 oz) was needed. :)"
""
""
""
""
""
"An outstanding look with dank dark coffee brown hue, a stubborn light tan head and an incredible sheet of lacing! The aroma is surprisingly subtle but certainly delivers very pleasant caramel malt with just a hint of grass hops. The flavor comes on nicely with much more malt and a smooth coffee blend. I get some grass hop edges and taffy sweetness along the lines of Circus Peanuts! But it's all quite tasteful and makes got a classic American Brown Ale. The body is solidly medium with modest carbonation and a slightly chalky feel. Solid stuff."

"T: A nice mix of toasted malt and light roasted coffee with a nice trace of earthy hops lingering in the back. Finish brings some brown sugar, oats and hazelnut. Mouthfeel is slightly creamy and carries all the flavors really nicely. A really great brown. Maybe the best I've had."
""
"On the real tip, Surly continues to impress me with every single beer they put out. IPA? Awesome. Douple IPA? Amazing. Imperial Stout? Fabulous. Helles Lager? Exemplary. Brown Ale? Yup, damn delicious. I can say that this is probably one of the most enjoyable brown ales that I've had, and certainly one of the most memorable. I would definitely revisit if it were available in my area. But I've gotta work on getting some Coffee Bender first!"
"O: Somewhere between an American Brown and Porter with a malt flavors and hops bitterness dominating."

"A top of the line brown ale. A malty experience with a soft hop profile to give it a bit more character. A bit rough around the edges, but I expect that from Surly and from style. It shows character more than lack of skill. I love tracking this down from time to time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Great brown ale. I enjoy Coffee Bender a touch more, but this is still top notch."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- not your typical brown ale, almost drinks like a porter, nice chocolate flavors with some good herbal hop notes to balance. One of the better I've tried of the style"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"a really nice brown ale, moving in that more hoppy direction, a real marker for the style in my opinion. the pour is chocolate syrup in color but not nearly as thick. only a little light comes through, and there is a foamy head the color of oatmeal that rises up maybe three inches and leaves good lacing as it drinks. the nose is bitter cocoa and bitter hops, maybe with a touch of pine to them. there is also a slight smoky aroma from the roasted barley malt that gives this more of a fall than spring beer aura to me. the flavor is big, lots happening for a brown. piney pitchy sappy hops first, which fade into a bitterness that is more malt driven. the cocoa element carries over from the nose but sweetens up just enough to counteract the bitter, and the finish is long and luxurious, exacerbated by the wonderfully full body, creamy texture, and soft carbonation of this beer. to be able to have this and sixpoints diesel in such close succession was a real treat. even though they call that one a stout, these are probably the best two American brown ales going at the moment. this is sensationally good."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I thought this was a really nice combination of sweet hoppiness with the dark, earthy maltiness typically associated with porters and stouts. I really enjoyed it and I will be bringing some home with me back to Wisconsin. (4)"
"Bender pours a black color, with a nice large white lacing head. There was a unique sweet like aroma. The taste had mild malt flavorings, with a strange candy like sweetness that followed. Full flavor, and easy to drink. Overall a sweet candy like brown ale."
""
"O - Really delicious brown ale. I just returned from a trip to Florida, where I drank a lot of fresh Cigar City beers, including their Maduro brown ale. At first taste, I prefer Bender & this only heightens my jealousy that Surly's beers are largely unattainable for me."
""
""
""
"O: A solid brown ale. I am not generally a huge fan of the style, but it's well balanced and drinkable."
""
"Beer is medium to medium-heavy in body, thickness likely due to the addition of oats. Carbonation is of medium-low intensity, leading to a smooth, fairly substantial mouthfeel with light flecks of carbonation felt across the palate. Closes quite dry, almost astringent, with light stickiness lingering on the palate."

"O: An accomplished brown ale that rolls around the tastebuds and is deserving of the high ranking it has accomplished.Seems to me to be the kind of thing you'd find yourself drinking in an English pub, albeit a quaff a bit hoppier and more forward than a bitter."

""
""
""
""
"Overall: A solid representation of a brown ale. I really like the addition of the oats."

"O - this beer really blew me away, it is so creamy smooth and big on flavour, I like brown ales but its not a go to style for me generally, but this beer has the best qualities of this style, BIG THANKS to andrenaline for introducing me to this brewer by including their beer in our recent trades"
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""

"O- very tasty brown ale. Nice sweet malts, roast, and bitterness to balance this beer."
"O: Extremely easy to drink and sessionable - really nice rich flavors and the added benefit of coming in a can which makes it a great choice for tailgating during football season."
""
"This beer poured out as a deep reddish brown color with a very nice cream colored head on top. The retention and lacing are top notch on this very good looking beer. The smell of the beer has a very nice roasted aroma with a touch of sweetness on the nose too. The taste is sweet upfront, a little creamy, there is a roasted nut flavor, hints of chocolate and coffee too. The aftertaste is moderately bitter. The mouthfeel of the beer is smooth, lightly carbonated and highly drinkable. Overall this beer is really good. Very nice brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O) This is another really good offering from Surly. Really tasty + easy drinking. This brewery has really impressed me. I wish I had easier access to their beers. Glad to have tried it, and glad to recommend."
""
""
"Pours a deep deep brown with nice tan head. Oily and great lacing. Really nice chocolate aromas, mixed with a bit of toffee and some slight hoppy aromas - even a bit of crisp-ness. Taste is very nice bitter roasted chocolate, deff bitter, almost like baking chocolate. Hints of caramel aftertaste. Again, its a little bitter, but its good and representative of the style. Great brown ale which shouldnt be passed up."
"This will no doubt rank farily high on the brown list that includes Dogfish and Bell's."
"Drinkability: Solid. This is an excellent brew."
""
""
""
""
"O - Incredibly tasty brown ale, loads of flavour, easy drinking and easily sessoinable. This is indeed a top notch brown ale."
""
"O/D - A nice brown. Noticable but not overpowering hop contribution adds a nice element. A nice take on the brown style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Thanks to KO for bringing this one back from MN. Dark brown in color with amber hues and perfect clarity. Poured with a thick, dense foam that slowly reduced to a wispy cap that left wet lacings on the glass. Dark roasted malt, dark chocolate and floral hop aromas with a hint of coffee on the back end. Oily feel up front with assertive carbonation through the middle and a bit of a the thin, watery finish. Dark roasted and burnt malt flavors up front with chocolate flavors beneath. Floral hop bitterness through the middle that transition to toasted malt just before the finish. Finishes crisply with a lingering charred malt and hop bitterness."
"A very worthy beer, I enjoyed this on a warm summers day, I can only imagine how good this would be on a cool winters night."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: Surly has a great line-up of beers. As is usual with all the styles they make, Bender is not your typical Brown Ale. It's more hop-assertive and hits all the right malt notes. The price is a little steep, but definitely one to buy!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One of the better brown ales I've had, to be honest. It's a style that seems to rarely ""wow"" at all, but this beer will go down as easily as any no matter what season it is."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Solid, but something seems to be lacking. The taste is there, but has a bit of a stale finish. A little thicker body would do this beer well too."
""
""
"O-A solid brown ale, having Coffee Bender soon which hopefully with the added coffee will be better."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a very solid example of a brown ale, truly an all-night session beer. Not my personal favorite style, but this is a textbook exemplar."
""
""
""
""
""
"O. Very nicely balanced. Flavor and thick, this is a refreshing brown ale that gets it very right."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - Outstanding brown ale taste; probably one of the better ones I've had do to its easy taste and feel; flavors and scents are good, but not overwhelming and you can really taste all the ingredients that were put into this beer; fantastic"
""
""
"D: Very. If you've never had it....please do."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-solid all around beer better than most browns that I have had"
""
""
"O: Perhaps a tainted can? I know others have raved about this but for me it just wasnt very special. The flavors were dull and the beer just didnt surprise me anywhere. I would drink it again but not sure I would pick it over a New Castle."
""
"Nearly cola colored body with a small light brown head that dissipates fairly quickly. Spotty lacing. Good bready maltiness in the nose, grassy European hop note comes through on the back end. Tasty and smooth brown ale with a nice rich malt flavor, lots of chewy smoothness from the oatmeal, and a bit of a bitter hoppy bite in the finish. Hints of coffee, cocoa, and subtle roastiness. Retains a good deal of drinkability and a creamy mouthfeel despite fairly crisp carbonation. Refreshing and very well-made, quite flavorful for an often bland style. Another impressive Surly offering."
""
""
"An excellent brown ale in a can. What's not to like?"
""
""
""
"O: I didn't realize Bender existed without coffee in it. Guess I should have done my research. This was the definition of average and I would recommend you skip it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- an iconic brown ale that deserves a spot in the fridge of any roasty beer fan with a soft spot for easy drinking brews. Very nice."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep, dark brown with one finger of off white head. Aroma opens up with some roasted malts, which are rounded out with some chocolate, toffee and caramel notes. Taste is more of the same and gains some nuttiness as the bitterness kicks in. Extremely smooth and very easy drinking, great mouthfeel. Overall, I would definitely get this on a regular basis if I could, I actually prefer this to coffee bender, I felt like I could taste the beer more in this one."
""
"D-Overall this was a good brown ale. Nothing exceptional but solid. The mouthfeel was a little on the lighter side. But this is def. a good base beer for Coffee bender. I would recommend trying this first and then move onto coffee bender and see how much it improves IMO at least. But overall a nice beer."
""
""
"O - This one was pretty damn good. It had a lot of flavor but it remained easy to drink. One of the better brown ales I have had in quite awhile."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very good brown ale. Great malt flavors with a solid hop presence."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Even though Brown Ales are never my first choice in a beer, this one was pretty decent. There was a good deal of flavors coming through, making this a bit less boring than the majority of ones I've come across. I'm pretty excited to try the Coffee Bender now, considering I absolutely love coffee flavored beers."
""
""
""
"O: It's been said before in previous reviews, but this is one of the best brown ales I've ever had. The world needs more brown ales that aren't nut-based."
""
""
"Big, creamy body works wonders for this brew. Solid complexity, fresh ingredients, well executed. Or in fewer words: a typical beer from Surly."
"O- a lot more complex than most ""brown"" ales. A regular offering for me, I can't believe it took so long for me to review this."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Nothing wrong with this one at all. Definitely one that I'd order at a bar any chance I got if it were sold in Indiana. At the same time, though, not one I'd go out of my way to trade for again. I'm curious to try Coffee Bender next!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Pretty much the best Brown Ale I've had, drinkable and smooth with decent flavor and nose."
""
""
"Overall is very high. Never expected to like a brown ale this much ever again."
""
""
"This is so much more interesting than an ""average"" brown ale. There is some room for improvement, but it is a great accomplishment. I would drink this a lot if I could get more."
""
""
"O- Brown ales are not my favorite style by any means, but I do enjoy a good one. This is pretty tasty, think I might enjoy it more in the fall."
""
""
""
""

"16 ounce can, canned on date of 11/22/11. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown (that you can see through some when held up to a light) with about an inch tan head that stays around a while. There's also a good amount of lacing. The brew smells like caramel malt, vanilla, coffee, nuts, chocolate, and some light hops. It tastes like caramel malt, nuts, coffee, chocolate, and some hops. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and has moderate carbonation. I think it's a good overall brew, I liked it. It's definitely worth trying."

"Mouthfeel is good. Full bodied with a perfect carbonation level. Flavors are well balanced and it's pretty smooth. Very drinkable all around solid beer. Glad to finally try it. Thanks stratt721"

"This beer pours with a nice tight light head that leaves very nice lacing and recedes to a short bit of tight head after a while. Good retention. Aroma is light, roasty, a bit nutty, and a mild bitter chocolate note. Taste is similar, but there is a bit of a lightness, and mild minerally flavor. Bitter chocoate is also absent. There is also a nice biscuit malt flavor. Overall, very nice beer. Mouthfeel could use a bit more body, but for a 5% beer the lightness is not really too much of an issue. Overall, this beer is very enjoyable. Probably wouldn't go too much out of my way to get it, but would always be happy to see this beer."
"Cost: $12 for a four pack of 16 oz cans."
""
"Overall, this was by far the best brown ale I've ever had. Probably cracking my top 20 which is ridiculous considering it's a brown ale."
""
""
"D- Overall, this one is a stand-out as far as brown ales go. Really a treat, I love the complexity and dryness of the malt with the subtle, smooth hop bitterness adding yet another layer. If you haven't had this beer, you need to try it."
"Dr: Quite drinkable for the style, but for my first Surly beer, it's a bit of a disappointment. Coffee is a strange choice for a would-be brown ale."
""
"Pours a deep clear dark brown color with ruby highlights when held to light. A Huge fluffy beige head sits on top for a good long time before impaling itself to the sides of my glass. Smells of caramel and chocolate mostly with some vanilla, a hint of nut and a bit of earthy hop presence. Taste is caramel and toffee mostly. Hints of butter, alcohol, and a slightly earthy citrus hop flavor seems a bit out of place. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet watery mouthfeel. I didn't enjoy this one as much as I had hoped I would. The malt bill has a distinct English esb meets dark mild feel to it while it also seems heavy on the American hops for a brown. I thought the flavors clashed a little bit. For a brew with oats in the bill I would have expected a much creamier feel than this beer has."
""
"Very satisfied by this Surly offering. A lot of good complexity and mouthfeel for a beer barely over 5%. Also a decent amount of subtle hoppiness for a brown."

"A good brown ale, different with the coffee aspect and better for it. Very drinkable and a nice different interpretation of the style."
""

""
""
"Overall I do enjoy this beer (second time having it) but I'm more eager to try Coffee Bender. Maduro is one of my go-to beers here in FL and like I said, this reminds me of it, but I don't know if I'd drink it as often were I living in MN."
""
"Pours a really pure, dark brown with a nice light coffee colored two finger head. Average lacing and retention. Not getting a whole lot from the aroma. Really slight notes of vanilla, coco and some hop oil. Nice subtle, balanced flavor. Semi-sweet chocolate, nice vanilla notes and some very muted nuttiness, toffee and caramel. Slight, but definitely bittering citrus and oily pine hops close this one out. Not a stand out beer, but very nice for the style."
""
""
""
"Overall - A decent beer overall. One worth trying in my book, but not anything that knocked my socks off. Just a good brown ale."
"Overall: quality brown ale and a perfect hit for style. would drink again and would love to have other products"
""
"Overall: This a very dinkable coffee ale. Surly has not disappointed yet. Can't wait to drink more from them. Cheers!"
"I simply love this beer. I feel lucky to have it as one of my local staples. I've savored it many times, and finally getting around to reviewing it. It's a classic example of Surly's take on brewing - combining elements in unusual ways to create unique, style-bending, fantastic beers."

"O - This beer was ok. None of the flavors were great, none too unpleasant. Wouldn't buy again... thought it was non-descript."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a fine brew that I would buy if it were available to me. I love the cans, love the look, love the low-ish ABV, and the flavors are great. This would be a welcome addition to the pitcher repertoire at my trivia pub."

"Canned Unk A: Pours dark brown with a transient tan foam that dissipates to nearly nothing leaving scattered foam throughout over the clarified beer. Spotty lace. (4) S: Bread, cereal, coffee, cocoa, hints of grass. Nice subtle hazelnut tone. A little sweet. Nice. (4) T: Interesting, nice and bready again but with some dry nutty notes and a little bit of a sharp yeasty character. Finish is long and soily. (4) M: Thin with hi carb (a little too hi) and a dry finish. Would like a little more body or a little less carb to make this a little more palatable. (3) O: Nice brown ale, can’t wait to try with some coffee in it. Bet it’s the bees knees. (4)"
"Overall a nice beer I'd return to if I didn't have to order it online."
"O- Bender is a fine offering from Surly in the Brown Ale catagory. Easy drinking, tasty, it's got a nice hint of hoppiness to it, which I find unusual for the style, but quite complimentary. I'd have this one again without hesitation."
"O- A nice brown ale, very enjoyable. Easy to drink and I am glad I have a few more cans for later."
"O: I tend to be a fan of brown ales and therefore pretty critical of them, but this is impressive. The aroma leaves a little to be desired, but overall it's got just a touch of everything - maltiness, hoppiness, spices, dryness, sweetness and carbonation. This is a great example of the style."
"When are you coming to Jersey."
"Thanks Brian!"
"Overall- Just a silly-smooth beer. It is certainly a little more radical than your average brown with the hop character and roasted quality, but it works incredibly well. And I'm sure I will finish this four pack entirely too quickly."
"O - There are a lot of brown ales out there that have slowly turned me away from the style, but I would definitely want to have this again. Nice flavors and very good mouthfeel make this very enjoyable."
"Overall - Nothing that stands out, but what it's got is good."
"Solid brew, but it didn't stand out in the evening's pretty stellar tasting lineup."
"O- Truly an awesome beer. one of the best Brown Ales I have had. Will definitely keep buying this tasty elixir. This stuff is da bomb! Seek it out if you're not from MN."
"D: Very smooth and quite drinkable. Overall, I enjoyed this beer and would gladly have another!"
"Overall: Not a huge fan of this one, which surprised me because I love the coffee bender. Not sure how old this can was, I'll have to revisit this one in the future."
"Pours a very dark brown. Opaque/black in the glass. Nice sized head. Great lacing. Smell is very mild. Burnt toffee. Taste is full of malt complexity. Toasty. Background sweetness. Slight burntness. Rich malt. Mild caramel. A touch of herbal hops. Great full bodied creamy mouthfeel. Well carbonated. Very drinkable. Overall this is an excellent beer. I've even attempted a couple batches of a clone homebrew of this, which actually came pretty close btw. Perhaps a defining american brown ale- highly recommended."
"O: I typically like my browns more on the nuttier side, but this was a pretty good can of beer.."
"A decent brown ale, however, the hops are not really doing a lot for me, in their creeping bitterness."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, has a nice creaminess and leaves smooth coating on the inside of your mouth. Not a high level of drinkability, but not something that is one and done. Overall, a great brown ale that is very enjoyable to drink. Can't wait to try to coffee bender!"
"(O) Well made brown ale. Has a lot of great flavors and is an easy drinker. One of Surly's best."
"O- Better than Coffee Bender, not as stale and chalky. Refreshing, light, yet a flavorful and well done brown."
"To be honest I'm a sucker for all of surly beers (mostly) but Bender has to be my favorite. It pours with a great head and lace. Carbonation is minimal but well balanced. Nice deep garnet darkish color. It smells of toast, chocolate, malt, coffee all at the same time. Man it is complex. Tastes what it smells like with a hint of vanilla. The head brewer, Todd Haughty is genius for putting this together. My first Surly beer I had in their first year of business and it remains my go to. The only thing better is a moes bender or coffee bender."
"My review merely emphasizes what they say on the can."
"Still, a very good beer, and one I'm glad I got to take another turn upon."
"something I would drink again but it would not be the first beer I grab from the fridge."
"O: A great brown ale right up there with the best. It may not have the most complex flavors, but it's delicious and smooth."
"such a drinkable brew. I don't normally buy browns, but I think Bender just may change that."
"This is an excellent brown ale, it really adds a dimension to a style that has always seemed a little bit 1D to me. Pours a deep almond/amber brown with a 2 finger tan head. Very ""chewy"" aroma, oats, toffee, caramel, faint citrus/plum like hop aromas linger. Tastes complex for a brown ale, oats and malt caramel form the backbone, strong cocoa notes, faint coffee, vanilla, and plum like hop character. Excellent medium weight body, chewy, just love to let it sit on the tongue. At ~5% this is a serious session brew, perfect for the transitional seasons on a crisp cold fall day or warm spring day."
"Quite the nice brown ale"
"quite good, a very easy drinking brown ale. a bit sweet but good."
"Enjoy!"
"Light bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Somewhat refreshing and easy to drink."
"O: A very nice brown ale. I like some of the additional flavors used to flavor the beer that others don't: coffee and cocoa. I don't get that much in taste, but loved the nose."
"Overall pretty solid brown ale, well made and an easy drinker. Not the best I have had but certainly not the worst. Love the coffee bender I will add!"
"O- A very tasty brown ale that is pretty drinkable. Smooth and clean."
"O- A good brown ale but the flavors of it didn't quite match up to the beautiful pour and pleasant smell and smooth mouthfeel. Props to Surly for my least favorite of their beers being ""good"" in my eyes."
"O- One of the better brown ales that I have tasted. One that I will repetedly ask for whenever I can get my hands on it. I am sad to see my last can go. Can't wait to get my hands on it again!!"
"O – This is really not a style I enjoy on a regular basis, but this beer gives me hope. Its very well rounded and I see it filling a niche that I have ever been able to find in another beer in this category. Great job Surly, you continue to truly amaze me. I will try hard to seek this one out again. Can’t wait to try the Coffee Bender, which sits patiently on deck."
"O- best brown I have had. Will seek out and trade for with my Minnesota peeps."
"Bender pours a brown so dark that it borders on black. Spotty cherry highlights shine through when the beer's backlit. The khaki colored head tops out at about two fingers of foam. Head retention is solid, and there's a thick ring of lacing marking the beer's apex. Subsequent lacing is a bit spotty. The nose is carried by sweet coffee and a touch of milk chocolate. There's just a little bit of lightly citric and fruity hop notes present as well. It could stand to be a little more potent as well. The flavor similarly bases itself around a sweet coffee maltiness. Here though, the taste of roasted nuts steps in and supercedes milk chocolate in terms of secondary sweet flavors. That light pacific northwest hoppiness is still there, but not as noticeable as in the aroma. Oats were a wonderful addition to the beer, I'm surprised I don't see them utilized in more brown ales (though I suppose other breweries might just not advertise their use). Whatever the case, the end result is a body that's a fair bit creamier than it feels like it has a right to be, given that it's not particularly full. It stops short of approaching watery though. The carbonation is just a touch higher than normal, it cuts through the malt and then there's just a little bit more, so each sip has a little bit of excitement to it. Surly Bender is one of the better American Brown Ales I've had, and one that would be in my fridge regularly if Surly was distributed here."
"O - Overall this is a pretty enjoyable brown ale. It gets better as it warms. This is the only brown ale I have ever had from a can I can't complain. I think it is balanced well. Could be a bit more complex."
"Not going to go too deep into this beer. Pretty much an oatmeal stout with a brown ale body. There are some really nice vanilla, and even a little bit of coffee coconut notes. A very good brown ale but probably not worth going out of your way to get."
"O - it's ok. Nothing wrong with it, per se."
"My wife’s cousin really wouldn’t steer us in the wrong way. He likes Surly, so I knew I would. Very much enjoyed this beer."
"O- love the smell, but just didn't live up to its appearance and smell. good flavor, but not great"
"The beer pours a sightly hazy brown color with a tan head. The aroma is a mix of chocolate, caramel caramel and some toasted/lightly roasted malt. The flavor is more of the same. I get a lot of chocolate as well as some roasted malt and some light grassy hops. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A very nice American Brown Ale and one I wish I had regular access to."
"O: one of my staples when there is nothing exciting to try. I reviewed from a can, but prefer from draught. My favorite beer from Surly's regular line up."
"Pours a deep chestnut hue with a frothy beige head. Nice sweet and roasty nose with oak, dried cherries, and vanilla notes. The flavor is robust with sweet malts and fruit followed by enough hoppy bitterness on the finish. Quaffable with good carbonation. A very solid beer."
"O) A delicious brown ale. I would definitely have another one!"
"O – A great brown; one of my favorites."
"O: I see why this is considered one of the best Brown Ales on the market. I enjoyed every stitch of my sesssion!"
"O- good brown ale. im not an avid brown ale guy but this one is good and i would like to try the coffee bender"
"Overall-Another solid Brown Ale that I've had in the past few months."
"Wonderful beer, Thanks to sweetwillyrolbar for the kick ass trade. The only thing bad I can say about this beer is that they don't distribute to Texas. I would without a doubt buy this beer all the time."
"Cheers!"
"O: Great beer. Easy to drink, very pleasant taste, and local (from MN!). Excellent on tap close to home. It is not overpowering in any way, which is the best part of this beer. It is subtly very good."
"Pours a dark brown with good clarity and thin-light tan head that is partially well-retained. Fills the nose with powdered cocoa, caramel, and brewed coffee. Darker roasted malts. More cocoa coming through in the flavor backed up by some sweeter caramel-like notes. Moderately bittered bit an herbal hop presence. Medium bodied with a moderate level of carbonation."
"Poured this American Brown ale from a tall boy can into a pint glass. It poured a clear brown color and it produced a small amount of head however it did have very good retention. The aroma of the beer consisted of roasted malt and floral hops. The taste of the ale was interesting. There was a base of roasted malt and dark chocolate. The beer seemed to have oily hop start, which gave way to a chocolate and then coffee finish. The finish was dry- medium bodied beer. Overall it is an interesting spin on an English Brown Ale- which is why it is classified as an American Brown Ale. i would drink this again."
"Pours a clear dark brown color with a 2 inch beige head that fades to a thin film. Nice rings and patches of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted oats, brown bread, and citrus zest notes. Taste is of oats, bread, nuts, and a citrus zest taste on the finish. Mild bitterness on the palate fades after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation that makes for a smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good brown ale and I am glad I got to try this one."
"O: A nice beer but not really anything over the top awesome. Would make for a really nice session beer."
"O - Very nice brown."
"O - Delicious brew with some great crafted individual flavors that work very well together. I pray for the day Surly comes down to MO. I love all their offerings so far."
"Pours an impenetrable brown, two fingers of off white fluffy foam which mostly dissipates within a few minutes. Not much lacing to speak of. Smell is subdued, at times primarily honey, at times vanilla, sweetness, with a solid backbone of roasted and caramel malt and touch of oatmeal. Wow, really nice complexity... a lot going on here. Taste is roasted malt, a little honey and smoke; doesn't quite have the same complexity as the aroma, but on par with the style. No hops in either the smell or taste, but there is an ever so slight tinge of bitterness on the finish. Carbonation is good, medium-light body. overall, this is very sessionable with an incredible aroma, and which pairs well with food."
"I am happy to try yet another Surly brew. This is a very nice brown ale and I'm hoping to try the coffee version soon."
"O-good brown ale Could drink a lot of these at once but have had better would not go out of my way to get another"
"O: great brown ale, smooth all the right flavors, dare I say better than my local favorite."
"I really enjoyed this offering from Surly - I've got a can of Coffee Bender to drink at some point and can only imagine it is as good (if not better) ... looking forward to it!"
"O/D - I always used to dismiss Bender and go with a Coffee Bender or Furious, but after having several cans recently I have really begun to enjoy this beer. It is an excellent showcase of roasted malt flavor without being very heavy. The subtle sweetness and hop bitterness in the finish complement the roasted character very well. Do yourself a favor and try one."
"Really love the concept and execution here for an Oatmeal Brown Ale. Bender because it bends the style guidelines for sure. Quite tasty and I would definitely try again."
"*** ** * ** *** edit 2/5/2012 - canned 12/19: only thing to add is not at all barleywine like to me. classic brown with huge earthiness. same scores, just lots of earth."
"Bender is great beer and one I would take down with some BBQ, it seems like a great match. 5% leads to all day drinking."
"Nice dark brown color, creamy brown head, doesn't stay long. Aromas of faint burnt sugar and chocolate. Flavor is delightfully roasty with a nice bitter balance. Caramel, brown sugar, graham cracker, and a smooth rich finish. Very tasty, wish I could drink these daily."
"Overall though this is avery solid standard nut like brown ale and would have no problem grabbing again."
"Overall- Very nice beer. It's rich and creamy in the mouth. Just a winner. I can people falling in love with this one."
"Recieved in a trade of a broad assortment of Surly brews. I have liked to loved all of them up to this one, which is difficult to finish. Maybe the brown ale doesn't travel well?"
"D - Very drinkable. The sweet malt and nuttiness are really nice. The flavors and balance are really nice throughout the beer and the finish is just spot on with the amount of sweetness."
"O: I really like the color and the mouthfeel a lot, and only could wish for a tad bit stronger flavor, but everything about it makes it a great session beer. Props to Surly."
"D/O- A true sessionable ""dark beer"" clocking in at 5.1%abv, Surly Bender is great to have a few of something when not in the mood for a pale ale. Hats of to Surly for this and it's brother Coffee Bender for what would be the ""flagship for the style"" if it would get distributed elsewhere besides Minnesota."
"Overall: Solid for the style but it is missing something. There is nothing bad or offensive about the beer by any means. I am hoping the coffee will tie it together."
"O- overall a really tasty beer. Can definitely drink a few of these in a sitting."
"Overall its good, A- is about what it deserves"
"Poured into a ccb pint glass, half a finger head dissipates quickly, very dark brown in appearance. Aroma is malty sweet, coffee in the background. Taste follows the nose but with notes of vanilla and hops, pretty complex. Light carbonation and fairly thick. Not a bad brown at all, up there with my favorites of this style."
"The taste is black and bitter coffee, dark chocolate and raspberry. This is a like a liquid bittersweet dark chocolate, mocha, raspberry flourless torte that leaves a lingering but bitter aftertaste."
"This is one of the best drinking brown ales I've ever had."
"D: A very tasty, sessionable brown. Great flavor and extremely easy drinking."
"O- Very easy drinkability, nice sessional bear that is quit refreshing, smooth and well balanced."
"O: A pretty decent beer. Nothing spectacular and very porter-like for a brown ale, but decent nonetheless. I wish the nutty flavors had come through a bit more instead of hiding behind the hops and roasted malts."
"Taste, pretty lively for a brown ale, slight coffee (nowhere near the amount of Coffee Bender), vanilla, even a tingly amount of hops present. Medium bodied, easy drinking enough, hides alcohol, definitely one of my favorite renditions of a brown ale."
"O - Killer brew, so much going on in what is commonly a simple style, but doesn't ever go overboard. Mouthfeel is way up the ranks as well. Wish I had more!"
"Thanks to funkyaudio for the extra! Poured from can into tulip glass. Pours muddy brown with a rocky, fluffy, tan head that sticks around leaving excellent poofy lace along the sides of the glass. Aroma is fresh, floral, light peppermint, mint chocolate chip. Taste is cola, sweet, roasty, bitter chocolate. Soft, bubbly palate. Really just a solid session beer. A good brown ale is a difficult thing to find."
"O-Good flavor-toasted malt is the dominant flavor, very drinkable."
"Good carbonation, semi dry finish and slightly light to medium bodied. Overall this is an average brown ale; I've had much better and I've had much worse. Too hoppy and over-hyped in my opinion. Cigar City Maduro Brown is heads and tails better in every aspect and considering I can get that locally I will not be revisiting this beer."
"Overall: A tasty brown ale that is very smooth with a nice kick of bitterness in the end."
"O - I like the coffee bender better. Still another good beer from Surly."
"D- OK, not only is this the best american brown ale I have ever had... it's also absolutely delicious on the drinkability level for a craft beer. The makeup is absolutely perfect in the drinkability department. This will be a beer I continually highlight when the conversation comes up best beers ever. No exageration, I like Bender this much. I need more...."
"D - A good brown out of a can. I'd take another!"
"O: Very solid brew that I could drink again and again if I were in a malty mood. Thanks again for this one Chris."
"O: Great drinkability, great taste, average ABV and it comes in a can. DOPE!"
"D - Drinkability is high. Smooth taste, good flavor, and low alcohol make this quaffable. I enjoyed mine with lunch and a hockey game and it went by surprisingly quick."
"o: top quality brown ale. really enjoy the maltiness and the chocolate and coffee come through nicely. wish I could get this more often"
"Overall a solid 4 out of 5. Glad I have some more of these to drink."
"Mouthfeel is a bit watery, but smooth and creamy at times which saves the beer from becoming a mess. Drinkability is where the beer shines, as for all its shortcomings the beer is very easy to throw down. Good beer even if not as good as I was expecting; definitely looking forward to coffee bender though."
"Very high. This is my go-to Surly beverage. Easy to drink a few of these, and you don't feel like you need a change of pace. Simply put, this one is fantastic."
"the CPJ"
"D- A nice beer. I will gladly drink again, but it wasn't all that overwhelming. I enjoyed it, even with the slightly bitter aftertaste that I wasn't expecting."
"Thanks to shir0045"
"Nice aroma, nice flavor, nice feel. This is a brown I could see myself drinking all the livelong day."
"M,D: Clean, enjoyable and very session-able. I could drink this all night, also with hearty or game influenced meal."
"A really great Brown, only a few i enjoy more. Worth stocking up on when you go to the Twins."
"D: This is the kind of beer I want to see more of. Like its brother Coffee Bender, regular Bender packs a punch of complex aromas, flavors, and really has few flaws. In the world of brown ales Bender and its iterations is king in my book. Show me a better brown. I bet you can't. 5/5"
"this beer is exceptionally drinkable. Overall, one of the most drinkable beers of one of the most drinkable styles out there. Very good brew. I would recommend this beer to anybody just getting into craft beer. As a true beer geek, I can still appreciate a great brown ale."
"D - A highly drinkable brew from Surly not to mention the first one I've gotten to try from them. Wish we got this stuff here in Ohio! Thanks again Josh."
"EDIT: I just had a can that was dated two months older than the first one I had (it's from October and it is now March) and I think I like this even more. Hop presence is definitely faded but it has become a lot sweeter and malty. At the same time I'm getting a somewhat crisp bacon/burnt toast bitterness that I really enjoy. I'm not going to edit my score, just thought it might be something of note to others."
"Poured from a 16 oz can into a mini shifter. Modest beige head slides into a todor brown hazy body. Clear, oily lacing lines the sides of the glass. Aroma is dominated by malty sweetness with brown sugar standing out. Some coffee notes and raisin. Taste follows suit with the malt sweetness/caramel dominating, followed by mild coffee. Overall, quite tasty with great drinkability."
"Drinkability: There is a good level of complexity here that makes this an exceptionally drinkable brown."
"The mouthfeel is relatively thin but about what you'd expect from a 5% brown ale. Carbonation is well controlled. This one goes down easy and is one of the better brown ales out there, looks like it's time to track down some more."
"D: Great. I could have a couple of these and still be happy."
"Edit: Interestingly enough, a couple days after posting my original review I decided to drink another one just from the can. It really, really opened up the flavors in a very surprising manner. This time it featured a nice chocolate malt flavor throughout. Now I'm perplexed."
"D- At 5.1% it would be easy to throw down a four pack in an evening, but alas this is a beer that has to be savored. Maybe its just nostalgia, but for me Bender is a treat enjoyed sparingly."
"D: Drinkability is pretty good. Decent balance, nice feel, and only just a hint of booze. Goes down very easily, and is something that I'd go back to again if it was available in the South!"
"A well constructed beer. Easy to drink and very flavorful."
"D: I could drink this beer all day. Really smooth brown ale that has exceptional characteristics for a brown ale."
"This is going to end up ranking higher on my list than a lot of beers that I like more, but this is the best brown ale that I've ever had so it deserves the high marks."
"An excellent drinking beer that is not palate tiring by any means but is very satisfying."
"Verdict: Bender is a great Brown Ale, and easily rates as the best example of the style I have tried yet; it's bold, complex, and easily drinkable. I just wish it was available here in Texas."
"as far as drinkablility is concerned, if I had a kegerator this is what i would fill it with."
"Drink- One of the better brown ales I have had."
"This is my first Surly Bender, and first impressions tell me that this is the best American Brown Ale that I have tasted. I wish I could get this regularly, because it would be a very solid go-to in almost all circumstances."
"D: Decent drinkability; I don't have any desire to have another one (even if that was an option), though there was nothing wrong with this one glass."
"Drinkability: Very, very high."
"D- hell yea ill go on a bender. This is one of the better beers I've had in a while and pushes the boundaries of the style without losing its soul. I'm glad a have another to toss back sometime soon."
"More drinkable than almost any other brown ale I've had. Bender from Surly is up there. Way way up there. I need more."
"d- this isn't what i was expecting, but the hops hit me huge here. it was very good, and went down easily, i could have more than one. gotta say that i enjoyed the furious much better, but this was tasty too."
"Another great beer from Surly, I'd give anything for them to distribute to Georgia. Sigh."
"Quite drinkable. This is a tasty brown ale and probably one of my favorites to date. I wish this was distributed to the east coast. Very sessionable and another great beer in the Surly line-up."
"D - another solid beer from Surly. I really enjoyed this take on the brown ale - more flavorful and balanced than most. I can see why this has such high reviews as it was a treat to try."
"Overall the most exciting 'Brown Ale' I've ever had the pleasure drinking. The snappy hops really position this malty, rich and flavorful ale into the spotlight. This ale's got more roasted and chocolaty elements than a lot of porters I've tried, without being pushy or out of character. A very creative rendition of a Brown Ale that's stays true and respectful to the style, but snazzes it up with a flair and attitude that only Surly can accomplish. Great ale for sure. Thanks Surly!"
"Overall Surly makes another great beer, very sessionable. It dries out nicely and nutty."
"Recieved this as a generous extra in a trade recently. Pours with a cream colored foamy head, black pour that is somewhat transparent. Aroma is hard to pick up on but there are hints of nutmeg and coffee with a hint of vanilla. Taste also hints to a coffee vanilla flavor but it's not robust or very forward. It's somewhat creamy, but the mouthfeel could actually be a bit thicker in my opinion. Drinkability is good for this one, but it's nothing I would put on the special shelf."
"Surprisingly hop forward that adds some crisp bitterness up feot balancing out by the mellow chocolate malt center. Slightly roasty with hints of bread, toffee and nut as well as a slight lactic creaminess. The bitterness lingers throughout into a roasty dry finish but this beer is very well balanced and easy to drink."
"D - Really easy and enjoyable. I don't mind brown ales and usually don't drink them but this one is pretty good. The look and feel are the best parts for me but I do enjoy the taste."
"I really enjoyed this overall, but while it was a great brown, I don't think it was my favorite brown. I totally see why it's a staple up north - really great local. I've got a Coffee Bender in the fridge that I can't wait to try & compare to this one."
"M- Dry, smooth and easy going. I just wish the end wasn't so bitter."
"SkÅL!"
"The mouthfeel is silky smooth. And this beer is very drinkable. This would be a beer fridge staple if it were available in my area."
"D: These are so darn drinkable, I could knock back a few during a game. Perfect balance of flavor and body."
"Poured from can into a typical shaker glass. Poured a deep mahagony brown with creamy head that lingered for a few sips. Aromas of brown sugar, chocolate, and nuts. Full bodied with a nice mouthfeel and nicely carbonated. Taste was very nice: chocolate, roasted malt, and no hop bitterness. Only thing missing is the coffee from their Coffee Bender! Well done again, Surly."
"Thanks for dropping this one off Dan. Pours a deep, rich mahogany color, with a creamy beige head. Aromas of wood, dark brown sugar, nuts and molasses. On the palate, full bodied, creamy mouthfeel, well carbonated, with flavors of chocolate, nuts and roasted malt."
"drinkable - yeah, pretty dinnkable."
"O: Average selection from Surly, obviously that is better than most."
"Thanks a ton for this one Lazerlobe! Poured into a pint glass. Massive creamy head on this one that sits on top of a transparent cola colored body. The head shrinks down eventually and leaves soapy lacing around the rim. The aroma is relatively faint, but after sticking my nose in this a couple times I can smell nuts, toasty malts and a bit of citrus. Orange zest mostly. Overall, what I would expect out of a brown ale! The taste is toasty with hints of coffee and chocolate with just a bit of orange zest from the hops in the finish. The mouthfeel is suffinciantly light with good carbonation and this one is as drinkable as they get. Great flavors and low abv make this easy to enjoy."
"Serving type: can"
"The color of this beer is brown with an amber hue, with a slightly tan head. The smell reminds me of chocolate. The taste has a rich malty chocolate taste to it. Mouthfeel is slightly thick like what you would expect from a brown ale. Finishes with a slight nutty taste to it."
"Overall, now I know why Coffee Bender is so good."
"D - Pretty drinkable. Lighter than a porter but has a lot of similar flavors. This is a style that I usually avoid but this beer is really top notch. I wish I could get it around here. I'd pick up quite a bit of it. I will get more of this any chance I get."
"Big thanks to Pullen for this as an extra in an in-person trade awhile back! Served from can into a Stone nonic. Poured red-brown with a one finger slight tan head. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt and a nutty note. The flavor was of sweet roasted malt, chocolate, cream, and a nutty note. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was an excellent brown ale. Had an excellent flavor with a very nice aroma to go along with it. All aspects were very well balanced and left me begging for more. This is probably one of my favorite brews from this style as I usually avoid them at all costs. Very nice job Surly!"
"Quite drinkable, this just disappeared. A great brown ale, but I liked the coffee version even better I think."
"Cheers.."
"Heck of a beer. For the style it's great and it lives up to the hype. None of the flavors, or anything else hinder drinkability. There is plenty going on in this beer to hold your interest for quite awhile."
"Bender is certainly a top tier brown ale. Everything about these beer is on point. The flavor and aroma are bold yet smooth. Easy to drink but with enough flavor that will allow you to savor. Excellent beer."
"This is one of the best drinking brown ales I've ever had. The nose felt somewhat subdued, but other than that this is aces."
"D: Well that beer went quick. Insanely easy to drink. I prefer this over the Coffee version"
"Drinkability for me is just OK. I like this beer but only on an occasional basis."
"Mouthfeel was ""slick"" due to the oats, I expect but not a really full mouthfeel beer. Nicely drinkable in that way. Good solid beer."
"This one is very, very drinkable....so long as you like this flavor, I don't think the night would ever stop with this smooth, enjoyable ale."
"MF/D: drinks like a silky stout, VERY smooth and sessionable IMHO. very little evident carbonation with building heat."
"The taste was a little thinner than I had expected already, a coffee taste up front, and not a good lingering mouthfeel. Dissapated pretty quickly."
"Drinks nicely. Probably not as well as the typical brown ale due to the roast and the hops, but like Surly does, they do it big and this one is no exception. It's unique and tasty. Definitely worth having around."
"Wow, unbelievable. It is like a coconut-almond chocolate bar sprinkled with fresh ground coffee and shredded hop cones. Hands down the best brown ale I have ever had and might be my favorite sub-6% brew ever. Hops are just perfectly integrated and the mouthfeel so creamy. I would be hard pressed to ever get sick of this extraordinary beer were I to have unlimited access to it. Wonderful!"
"Pours a hazed brown with nice cap of off white head... good retention and some sticky lacing. Scent is light but contains nice whiffs of roasted nuts, light carmel, milk chocolate and the briefest hint of roasted espresso. Taste is a little more aggressive than scent dictates but still under control... a nice blend of the above mentioned flavors where neither over powers the other, a nice floraly and bitter hoppy finnish on this as well. What makes it is the rediculously creamy body, makes this unique and such a great beer to drink, my only gripe here is that its a touch undercarbonated. A very unique brew from its flavor profile down to its smoothy creamy body... would love to see what they were capable if they went all out with this one."
"D - balanced and simple, sweet up front with a dry, hoppy, clean finish help this beer finish smooth and go down pretty easy."
"entered from some notepad notes, consumed on a bench in a state park near Grand Marais, MN"
"The feel of this brew is quite smooth and excessively drinkable. Medium in the feel with an acceptable amount of carbonation. Lots of flavors going on in this that reach outside the spectrum of the typical brown style. Very well done."
"This is definitely a solid brew. This one was very unique for the style. It seems like a brown ale fused with an IPA. It's hoppy and roasty and robust. Good to try at least once. Hunt down one bottle to try."
"- Overall drinkable, flavorful, and light. Must say the coffee version is a bit better."
"Notes: Very good beer for the style- it fits right in the paradigm. I wish (every night before I go to sleep) that Surly will expand in my area. Thanks again Kyle"
"Flavor and mouthfeel: crisp, clean, roasted, high carbonation. It's tough to really pick anything else out of this that really stands out...just your average brown ale, just quality! Small amount of hops lingers in the back, and a decent drinker."
"M/D: This beer is smooth as smooth can be. Silky medium body. The hops help this beer a lot, but in my opinion, the feel of the beer is what makes it so drinkable. It's like you are drinking velvet! Every sip is a good as the last. Wonderful job Surly! :D"
"(D)- A superb brown ale with everything in the right place. A smooth and easy drinker. A great beer for the fall time."
"Drinkability: A very enjoyable brown ale. Not over powering at 5.1%, so I could see myself drinking a lot of these, whether in a session or not."
"Bender is outrageously drinkable. No, it's not a DIPA or a RIS or any of the ""big beers"" but it is equally full of flavor and arguably just as, if not more complex. With beers like this, it's not difficult to see why Surly dominates the Twin Cities."
"Nice smooth carb, medium mouthfeel, and a clean finish. This is really nice. I think this is one of my new favorite brown ales. Surly continues to impress with a great lower ABV beer. Wow would I drink a ton of this if it was available."
"D: this beer is delicious. Not as good as coffee Bender IMO, but pretty close."
"D: Very drinkable--though the roasted malts (and oat flavors) are just a touch much at the end of the pint"
"D- Very easy to drink Surly beers, they seem to make me happy with their drinkability and low ABV while still making some tasty beers."
"Drinkability -- Surly knows how to make a crisp, refreshing brew. No doubts about that. While this is a refreshing beer, it seems to want for a little more roast malt sweetness that typifies the style. Otherwise, quite drinkable. I approve!"
"Very dark, deep brown color. Some nice lacing remains as it goes down the glass. OK aroma-somewhat nutty and malty. Some bitterness upfront flavor wise. Somewhat of a grainy/chocolate like flavor. Nutty-again the bitterness dominates. Ok mouthfeel. Decent US brown. Nice caramel/nuttiness. I was not impressed the first go round with this beer-much better this time."
"Overall, a nice example of a brown ale."
"Medium bodied. Appropriately carbonated. Smooth, plush texture. An easy drinker for sure. Not as good as Coffee Bender, but still tasty."
"The body was good for the style, full without being heavy. Drinkability was good, but the coffee is not a pleasant taste for me. Overall, a decent beer that I'm glad I finally got a chance to try."
"You know, I expected more from this beer. I've never heard anything but positive reviews for Surly, but the Bender I pulled at the Triple Rock was only slightly above the average line. Impressive dark color obscures an unfortunately mellow taste, which makes for a drinkable but not particularly delicious brew. Surly has since redeemed themselves with a few other beers, but this one didn't leave much of an impression."
"M/D - Excellent! A great medium bodied brew that is fresh and smooth. I brew that I can for sure have more than one of. A brew that should be tried and traded to those that can't get it. Like all Surly products. Another great example of a brew!!! Well done Omar and Todd"
"D - Surly is the king of the can, obviously."
"D: I had this beer after drinking a glass of the Surly Furious. I couldn't really tell if the hoppiness I was tasting was leftover finish of the Furious, or if it was part of this beer as well, but that taste didn't work well with me in this beer. Hopefully, I can review it again if I come accross it."
"I got this in a trade from DmanGTR and couldn't be happier. I've been trying to get my hands on this beer for a couple of years and it did not disappoint. Thanks Daren, Slainte."
"Recommended if you like brown ales or malty beers."
"D: Surly does truly excellent stuff. I'm told this is pretty affordable over in Minnesota, which makes me pretty darn jealous. I wish I could find a brown ale of this caliber out here."
"D- Another exceptional Surly brew. Coffee Bender is certainly a step up but this beer stands up well on its own. Very, very drinkable. Thanks, Omar."
"Drinkability is very good."
"D - Very flavorfull despite the low ABV, nothing too strong, makes it an easy drinker."
"D: Another solid beer from Surly. One of the better brown ales I've had the chance to try as it balances the sweetness and nuttiness quite well."
"D: Surly continues to impress me today. This is a markedly full-flavoured beer for ~5% and if I ever go to MN, I'm going to buy this again. Wonderful beer."
"D - An excellent example of an American brown. Great taste and low ABV make drinkability high. Surly continues to impress with everything I've tried from them."
"D: Pretty damn good drinkability. I had 22oz no problem. Could of easily had more."
"Overall it's a fantastic beer and a classic version of the style. I'm looking forward to my next visit to Minnesota."
"Overall a great beer from Surly; one of my favorite examples of the style."
"All around very fine american brown ale. One of the best I've had. Wish I could get it in Philly!"
"Drinkability well its a shame this isn't readily available to me as I'd keep this stocked as often as possible..."
"D - Nice, smooth brown ale...a little bit different than I'm used to, but quite good. Alcohol is on the low side at 5.1% making this a very easy drinker. I enjoy the Coffee Bender more, but this is a pretty good brown ale on its own."
"d - Overall, I thought this was a decent brown ale. Pretty new to Surly's products, but I would have liked a little less coffee taste since they already have a brew in Coffee Bender. I would definitely try this again, but it was not my favorite brown ale."
"Drinkability is good. Overall a good session beer with an interesting porter-like flavor."
"The feel is nice."
"D: I like browns, and this isn't your typical brown. Well blended, nice take on the style. Goes down easily, not filling. This is definitely a sessionable brew!"
"Drinkability: The numbers don't really show it, but I give it a 4 overall as I really enjoy the flavors and feel that I would find this to be a pretty refreshing beverage on a warm spring day, but not in the dog days of summer, as it does start to sit a little heavy on the belly."
"Mouthfeel is creamy from the oats and drinkability is good. I can't really compare this beer to anything I have had, and I love that about it. I love pretty much any beer made with oats as well, the creaminess really does it for me. I can't say it was a best beer I ever had, but i will say that it was very good and interesting. The combination of flavors works pretty well together. Very glad I got to try this one, I love trying new things and this one stands out as different for sure."
"D: When given the option at any point in the year I almost always take a Furious, but I never complain when I'm drinking this on tap. Surly Nation? whoop?"
"D: Potent taste, but with a lighter body, 3-4 is within my range."
"** The beer style was clarified by FeloniousMonk a long time ago. This one is an oatmeal brown porter."
"D: For a beer this hoppy, superbly drinkable."
"brown with a secret of maroon. an upstanding creamy head. smells a bit chocolatey, creamy and touch nutty. i wish i could pluck just which one. mild flavor, a nice taste, nothing very punchy, just a really drinkable beer with a bit of a roasty, creamy character and a widening body. a pleasant drink, i'd like to try the coffee bender, i think that intensity is what is missing in this one for me."
"D: Surly makes some of the most drinkable beers of all time and this is really no exception. The body, mouth, and nice but simple enjoyable character make this the definition of a sessionable beer. Seek it out. Drink it. Its good."
"Yet another winner from Surly. I have a feeling this can of Bender had some age on it, but I still found it to be quite enjoyable. Hopefully down the road I can pickup a fresh one to compare."
"D - The Brown Ale style, I feel, is one of the most under appreciated styles in America today, but this beer is one of the best in the biz and love the art on the cans, kudos to Surly"
"Overall it is an average, semi watery easy drinker."
"Overall: For a little bit I was starting to get bored of Bender, but the on-tap totally revived it for me. Drinkability is amazing amazing on this beer, I could drink it all day long."
"4.5 D: Damn tasty brown. Couldn't ask for much more."
"Thanks to Dave for this treat."
"Nice mahogany brown color with a solid tanned cap. Aromas are blocked by the fluffy foam but a solid sniff elicits caramel malt sweetness and a hint of hops. The flavor falls in between the bracing brightness of an IPA and the robust char of a porter. Either way, the bitterness is there and it leaves a significant and long-lasting aftertaste. I happen to love it. Malt notes from caramel, Munchen-type sweetness mix with the coffee tone, while the hops bring forth tobacco earthiness and a hint of menthol and pine. Pretty good stuff all around, and highly recommended if you're in the area."
"D: a great beer for cool weather i could easly take care of the four right now"
"Overall this was a very nice take of the American Brown Ale with rich flavors and great balance. Thanks again Chuck for supplying me with this. Recommended."
"Great take on a brown ale."
"D - It's good overall but as usual, I can't get passed the stupid grass flavored hops. Not appealing to me, but the beer as a whole is."
"Well, not one of my better reviews. If anyone would like to trade me for some more in a CAN, I would happily re-review this beer."
"Overall a fantastic brown ale. I will have to pick up as much as I can next time I go to the twin cities."
"D- I love this beer, and fortunately it is readily available here. Totally sessionable, but also complex enough to be interesting as a single beer. This may be the best American brown ale in the market."
"D- Once again another retarded drinkable beer from Surly. I can't wait to try another beer from them. They can do no wrong when it comes to brewing it looks like."
"A nice brown ale with low carbonation. The maltiness is evident and it is crisp with an even bitterness. I have yet to try the Coffee Bender in my fridge and I am quite interested to try it as this beer has a definite undertone of coffee. It is incredibly drinkable and I can think of a number of foods I would pair this with."
"Mouth- Medium CO2, some residual sweetness/stickiness, nice and rich. Long lingering finish. Excellent American Brown ale with a mess of complexity swimming around in the pint! Excellent drinkability for such a rich, medium to full bodied, compled brew."
"Search out this beer. Love it."
"Roasty flavor, smooth medium bodied beer. Some coffee on the back end (this isn't coffee bender). Nice mid palate connectivity. Overall an easy drinking great beer."
"Poured a reddish brown with a lingering ring of tan foam. Smells of cocoa, carmelk, light vanilla and light coffee. Tastes of carmel, cocoa, light coffee, light toffee and a hint of vanilla. Mouth feel was light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation and a smooth finish."
" ~ This is a very good beer with allot of fine qualities to offer. I will certainly recommend this beer to my friends. My true thanks go out to ""drizzam"" for his gift of the Bender. Thanks Bud!"
"Very good session beer. I love Surly and only wish I could get it more often. Thanks again Megan for the beer!"
"Comment: Also, I had to watch an episode of Futurama after drinking this. Specifically the episode where they brew beer inside of Bender, calling it Benderbrau."
"Poured a coffee brown with a decent sized medium tan head and good carbonation. Nose is rich and malty, some cola sweetness and nutty notes. Rich and malty in the taste as well, some chocolate, big dose of caramel malt and finishing with a nice hoppy dryness. A very tasty and easy drinking brown. Not one of my fav stylesbut great!"
"Good drinkability, nice flavor. Didn't blow my mind but it's a pretty decent brown ale with a nice bit of complexity. Would have again."
"Overall-I've drank way too much of this, and will continue to. This would be a VERY tough brew to get bored of."
"D: Highly drinkable. A very nice offering--I wouldn't expect anything less from Surly."
"This beer is insanely drinkable and delicious. I love session beers and this is up there with some of the best. There's always room for Bender in my fridge."
"D-Very dinkable. It's not wonder it's called Bender, as I could easily consume several of these in a session."
"Nice beer. I can see why folks seek this beer out."
"had this at old chicago in duluth and poured into a chilled pint glass it was dark brown with a nice head and lacing the smell was nutmeg toffee,coffee and malt oh yeah its nice its surly...the taste is the same its toffee and malt and hops with a slight coffee taste its really good just enough hops and malt with a nice finish..this slides down fast and is real easy to drink a highly recommended brown for ipa and pale ale drinkers..surly just makes good brews period im so glad its in my backyard anytime i want it which is all of the time"
"Very good beer by Surly. This one has been sitting in the fridge for awhile and I just couldn't get to it, glad I did tonight."
"Overall, another beer from surly that I enjoy. These guys just seem to know how to make good beer. Very sessionable and definitely something I can always have in the fridge, however I still will take a coffee bender over the regular bender."
"Drinkability: At 5.1% abv, this is the ideal year round session beer in Minnesota. It is also the best Brown Ale (whether English, American, India or hybrid) that I have had."
"Drinks alright, but a bit too much coffee to make me happy style-wise. Liked this better on tap or the in your face coffee bender"
"This one blurs some style lines for me... but overall a great beer. Can't wait to try the coffee Bender!"
"D: This brew goes down very easily. One of the most drinkable browns I've experienced. Another great brew from these guys!"
"D and overall impression: Drinkability is high, given the low abv and the tastiness of the malts. Overall, this is one fine beer. Just a great example of how malts can be used. If all other Surly offerings are as nice as this, I can't wait to try more. Skal."
"Thanks to Dansting for this one. 16oz can served in a shaker pint. Poured a clear brown with less than a finger of tan head. Nose is pretty subdued. A little chocolate malt and some faint hops. Gets a little more pronounced as it warms. Light to medium bodied. Chocolate malt and cocoa are the predominate flavors. Hops show up in the dry finish. Also a nice lingering flavor of chocolate. Solid Brown Ale, very drinkable."
"Drink ability is good. Pretty session able brown ale. Definitely at the top of the list with Brooklyn Brown and Dogfish India Brown ale. Too bad its not distributed in Colorado, would buy again if available"
"D- Drinkability is exceptional. Could drink these all night."
"Thanks again to br3wmeister for a chance to try this. Not as good as the Coffee Bender, but nice enough."
"Body is light, soft and built on a good swell of fine carbonation, making this dangerously drinkable. This is pretty much its own thing, and this thing is good."
"D- Great drinkability. This beer never seems dull and never overtakes the palate. One of my favorites."
"D: Very sessionable and a pleasure to drink. This is a great change of pace beer from the heavier impy stouts or ultra hoppy DIPAs yet extremely satisfying."
"D - I could drink a whole case, 100%, I'm having a hard time stopping..."
"a blend of apa, american brown, and american porter. with a well balanced and very broad range as a beer with such a low abv. there is fruit. apple from the brown mild bitter citrus from the apa and some dark fruit and plum, and english style stale grape from the american porter. there is chocolate and smokiness. bitter like coffee as in earthy but not coffee like like the coffee bender. a lot of malt and quite a finish of bitterness that i don't really remember in the can. the can also seemed a tad sweeter. more chocolaty. great in both venues. different but still such a big beer that different things appear in different circumstances... and batches for that matter."
"D: Pretty solid brown ale all in all. My first Surly beer as of date, and eagerly open to trying more in the future. With that being said, I can honestly say that this was my first and last bender so to speak."
"D: Not too heavy that you couldn't have just one in a sitting, but just perfect for a late fall evening. Simply a sweet tasting delicious beer to be savored."
"Surly just keeps doing it again and again, another solid brew in a CAN. Just goes to show that more breweries need to start canning there beer. I would definitely recommend trying this beer."
"-not too shab. would be really interested to try it on tap"
"definitely try it, but don't count on it being a go to... I feel like my actual score for this beer won't be entirely representative of that stance."
"Not bad, not my fave. An easy drinker, but I don't know that I'd jump at the chance to have another given other options."
"D: A good beer for a style I'm not crazy about."
"Can. Pours a clear brown with a thick light tan head. Aroma of sweet malt and some coffee grounds. Flavor of slightly roasted malt with a touch of creamy smoothness. Thankfully, this is a brown ale that's not dominated by super sweet malt. Pleasant and easy drinking, certainly one of the best brown ale's I've had."
"D- A very good dark ale. I'm a big fan of this one."
"Brown ales are not my favorite style, but this is pretty tasty and impressive."
"As for drinkability, well... it's a little dark and rich, but we had a little over a half gallon apiece, with no problems. I would say that qualifies as a good fall/winter session beer."
"D: Very good beer and enjoyable to drink. Really wish I could get ahold of this in my area."
"This just might be the best american brown... period."
"holy crap!!"
"M&D--Medium bodied and washes down clean with a grain aftertaste. This is a highly drinkable ale, great for session drinking but coming from a style that doesn't stand out. Good job again Surly!"
"which is were it might work."
"D: This is a session beer, for sure. It explodes with flavor, but isn't heavy at all. One of the best brown ales I've had."
"Pours very very dark brown, espresso brown into the pint glass. Can't see through it at all. Dark, but not real thick. Thin head, but retains nicely, and leaves a bit of lacing. Smell is average. Not much nose, a bit of dark malt is all. Taste is a whole new ballgame. Up front, a balance of sweet malt with dark malt. Then the oatmeal smoothness begins to kick in, along with some coffee/chocolatey stouteyness. It almost is like a stout that is flavorful without being harsh and burnt. Smooths out to vanilla, and a healthy dose of hops on the finish. Just enough hops to be interesting without overwhelming everything. Perfectly carbonated, super creamy, flavors blend and linger on the palate. Perfectly sessionable and very drinkable. If this were available in MA I would drink this all the time. Just awesome."
"This beer poured from a 16 oz. can has an extremely dark amber color, which you can only see by holding to the light. From a distance it looks black. Off-white head that falls to a thin layer of bubbles with good lacing. Aroma is of roasted caramel, chocolate and vanilla. Smooth, creamy mouthfeel with a subtle amount of carbonation. Flavors of sweet malt and burnt chocolate with a subtle hop and coffee aftertaste. One of the best beers I have ever had."
"A good beer that I would like to have at some point in the future."
"Overall: Thanks go out to OHLRangers for generously hooking me up with this beer. It is great. I love it."
"Overall, this isn't a beer that will be rated as high as and RIS or DIPA, but there's really not reason it shouldn't be."
"D - Wonderful all the way around... The taste and mouthfeel are exceptional... A wonderful introduction to Surly... The only problem with the beer is that it isn't regularly available in PA... World class..."
"It's a sweet brown beer coming out of a can. It's weird, for sure. It's good, and I'd have another. Still--why doesn't it come from a bottle? In 12oz servings?"
"Anyway, yes. Surly does it again! A supremely drinkable beer and a tasty example of a style I'm normally not that into."
"Serving suggestion: Standard pint glass."
"Very full bodied brown ale. Lots going on, almost not sessionable, though still is. Id love to have some more."
"Worth noting that I much preferred this to the Coffee Bender - I thought it had a much better body and overall complexity, despite one less ingredient."
"Note to Self: Ranked #2 American Brown Ale (behind only Coffee Bender) when I tried it."
"Pours nice dark, crimson brown with good amount of head that dissipates rather quickly. Smells sweet and malty with a slight hint of honey. Taste is nice and toasty, with the malt and honey coming through, and a nice, subtle toffee flavor. Wonderful carbonation and thickness. All of this and a low abv make this one of the more drinkable beers I've had in a long, long while."
"There's a reason this beer is seen as one of the best examples of its style in the world. There's a hell of a lot of depth and complexity to its flavour profile, and this puts it head and shoulders above most of its contemporaries. The appearance and aroma are stunning, but I do feel slightly let down by the mouthfeel, which is adequate, but doesn't match the high standards of the beer's other components. Huge thanks to Bryan (BigBry) for this can and an assortment of other great beers."
"Very quaffable. Manages to be thrist-quenching and sating at the same time. Ideal setting for this beer? Hmm...I'm thinking, outdoors, a temperate fall afternoon, Reuben sandwich."
"I would summarize this as a better fat tire."
"D - Kind of threw me off because I thought this was supposed to be a porter, but I kind of figured it was a brown ale on tasting. Pretty good flavors, the strong alcohol flavor doesn't make this that drinkable though."
"Pours a bit like a Coke, quite dark and opaque. The head sticks around for a looong time, great lacing. Smells pretty hoppy for a brown. Has that distinct brown ale bite, very flavorful and complex! On the downside, mouthfeel might be a bit thin. Pouring a beer like this out of a can was definitely unexpected."
"Very drinkable brown ale. The best I've had to date."
"D: Easy to drink brown ale. Darker ales have somewhat heartier flavors often and lighter dark ales sometimes fall into the trap of using too much specialty grain for their size. Bender does a very good job of providing a balanced brown ale."
"This seems to be a moderate brew for all the hype of it. I'd like a bit more roasted bitterness to balance with the hops but other than that it was decent."
"Drinkability: I've never been a huge fan of brown ales, so my opinion might be somewhat biased. Despite being relatively low in alcohol, something about this beer made it more of a sipper. I can't say I'd want to have more than one, nor can I say I'd seek it out again. Still, glad I tried it."
"Good job dudes at Surly, good job!"
"I got this in a trade from wery0001. I poured from a 16 ounce can into a standard pint glass. It pours a deep dark brown with a creamy white head, lots of lacing. The aroma has chocalate, coffee. The flavor follows, not overly bitter. Bender is medium bodied, and has a nice creamy mouth feel. Bender is a nice drinking brown ale."
"Pours dark amber brown with little head into a tulip. Smell is very sweet. Nice medium malt base with maybe too lively carbonation. Little to no hops, but this can is at least a year old. Overall a great brown."
"Drinkability - Quite drinkable. Smooth, and went well with the Old Chicago Seven Calzone I had. I had the 25 oz. mug and it went down easy."
"no roasted flavors while tasting, but all the flavors balance very well together. don't get a whole lot of in your face oats or cocoa, but again, well balanced. great beer overal. initially a crisp mouthfeel, but became creamier as you drank more of it."
"Poured from a 16 ounce can into my nonic pint glass. Appears a mildly hazy rich mahogany color with a solid two fingers of creamy tan head. Thin lacing sticks to the inside of the glass. Smells and tastes of nutty, roasted caramel malts, cocoa, brown sugar, molasses and mild coffee. Medium in both body and carbonation. Creamy, satisfying mouthfeel. This is one great brown ale. A really tasty beer that you can enjoy all day."
"I would buy this by the case if I could. Great, great beer."
"Drinkability is good, took me a while to finish it. Could probably have one or two in a sitting, but thats all."
"D- so drinkable....absolutely delicious. could see myself drinking several of these in one sitting..."
"D: Enjoyable. A good session beer that is very hearty. I'd order a second, but won't buy in a 4-pack"
"Deep translucent hazel brown color with ruby flares against light. Light tan colored frothy head with low retention and streaky thin lacing. Nose is roasted malt, bready, nutty, slight coffee and sweet chocolate. Flavor has amazing balance of both sweet and bitter, alternating between roast malt and nuttiness versus a fresh hoppy bitterness. Creamy, medium body with light carbonation but strong bite from hops. An excellent, refreshing hoppy brown."
"Bender was dark brown in color. It had a nice rocky beige head with good retention and lacing. The aroma was toasty malt, some chocolate, and a little coffee. The taste was dark malt with some chocolate and a touch of coffee with a nice bitterness towards the dry finish. It was medium bodied with good carbonation. Drinkability was good. This is one of the better brown ales that I have tried."
"This is easily the best version of an American Brown Ale I've had. It's very complex, yet insanely drinkable. I am going to stock up when I go to MN."
"Received as a generous extra from DbHog. Served in a nonic. Poured a translucent brown with ruby red highlights when backlit. Two inch dense, khaki-colored head left behind delicate bands of lacing as it receded. Nose suggests chocolate malt. Taste reveals, cocoa, coffee, a slight roasty char and a kiss of hops at the finish. Mouthfeel is between light- and medium-bodied, lightly effervescent with a creamy smooth texture. Incredibly drinkable Brown Ale; sessionable and tasty. This is a solid reminder that not all beers have to be extreme to be flavorful and satisfying."
"Overall- This is a great brown ale. Surly has done it again, another great beer."
"Probably one of the best browns I've had to date. Darn glad I have a few extra for camping season."
"The can of beer pours a solid brown with garnet highlights, modest head and lacing. The smell develops as the beer warms up, and reveals earthy grains with nutty overtones. Taste is outstanding for a brown, loads of oatey malts, but a great hop bite makes for an exceptionally crisp beer; I'm no expert on brown ale, but this beer seems unusually clean and brisk in a category rich in sweet and mellow quaffers. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, pretty rich, with the hops clearing things out nicely, without the sweet sticky residue some brown ales leave behind(again, I'm no expert). Drinkability is outstanding, very sessionable. I'm delighted to have this one on draft within stumbling distance from my home."
"Seems more like a porter than a brown ale."
"Pours a very dark amber with a half inch tan head that quickly faded to a thin layer. The smell is malty with a slight milk chocolate and a hint of espresso. The taste is slightly sweet and malty with a hint of bitter chocolate, creamy milk chocolate and some coffee notes on the finish. There are some dark fruits mixed in the sweetness and not much of a hop presence at all. The mouthfeel is creamy and this seems bigger than the 5%. Drinkability is great! No alcohol burn yet still a lot of body. I find it very hard to get that combination. Overall I am truly impressed with Surly and this beer."
"Drinkability: Not a fan of brown ales, and this is middle of the road for the style."
"Drinkability is good, will have no problem finishing this, only wish I could easily get more. Coffee bender is next!"
"Almost a reddish brown pour. Miniscule off white head. Smells, surprisingly floral, some pine with some malt and molasses. Light/medium body with a healthy dose of carbonation. Flavors of malt molasses and brown sugar. A surprisingly strong coffee note to me, would be curious to see how much more the coffee Bender has. Finishes real clean. Drinkability is not a problem for this one. Somewhere between a brown and a porter I guess. My friend did not like this one, I thought it was excellent."
"Overall: I love Bender. It is the best of its style, even though it doesn't fall into a category. I highly recommend getting your hands on this if you can."
"I'm surprised by the subtleness of this beer. I'm never impressed by brown ales because I find the style to be lackluster but this was very enjoyable!"
"D- drinks okay, but i wouldn't want to drink it again!"
"J"
"Pours a deep dark brown with puffy tan head. Smells of coffee and malts and chocolate. Tastes a little bitter, nice coffee and sweet flavors blended together in this. Less than moderate carbonation, very thick. This is ok, I think I will try something else next time around."
"The body is light to moderate. This is where the beer falls off for me. I would like more depth for a Brown. Overall I think the whole beer itself is good with clean flavors but give this is a skinny beer. Give me some body!"
"Drinkability: Perhaps the best of the Surly brews I've tried thus far tonight (haven't had Darkness yet, and I tried Furious before). This is a flavorful, low-in-alcohol, crisp, and refreshing brew, striking the right balance between complexity and simplicity. Give this one a try - if I lived in Minnesota, it'd likely be a go-to."
"This one is a medium dark brown with a lumpy yellow head. Smells mildly of chocolate and coffee. Tastes very mildly of malt, chocolate, maybe some fruit, but it's such a mild flavor that nothing really makes itself known. Mouthfeel is just a bit too thin for my taste. A good beer, very drinkable, but nothing too special."
"D: Very drinkable beer, this can was gone and I'm glad Scoobydank sent me 3 more! The flavors are all balanced and it's really a nice session beer."
"Subtle roasted malt aroma-with a surprisingly noticeable hop presence (at least for the style IMO). Nice light chocolate and toffee flavors with a good nutty presence. I would've expected a little more out of this one but it is certainly sessionable. I am definitely be interested in trying the coffee version though."
"D- This is an awesome brown ale. One of my favorites so far. Reminds me a lot of Terrapin Indian Brown. Great hoppy characteristics accent a nice, complex brown ale with a good mouthfeel. Would trade for this again; though it is similar to the Terrapin which is locally available. Drinkability is great and ABV is undetectable."
"M + D: Smooth, lighter carbonation. A good body to it. Feels good, tastes quite nice, and goes down smooth and easy."
"D 3.5. Ok but way over rated, not what I was expecting and some bland off flavors, not at all representative of the style"
"Haven't been disappointed with any of the Surly offerings just yet. No exception here."
"Plenty drinkable. Not too heavy, but with plenty of flavor. Reminds me of DFH India Brown Ale"
"D: Usually have a couple of these. Couldn't have too much though, as it gets somewhat heavy."
"Serving type: can"
"D - I'll seek this one out again, and if it were local, I'd have this on hand all the time. Great mouthfeel, really good everything else. I bet this one would be great with all kinds of food, too."
"Taste great, feels great and at 5.1ABV its one of the lower alcohol beers they offer. I can drink a 4 pack in a sitting, and on a cold ass day like today (-4F) I just might."
"What a great brew. To date I think it's my favorite. This, in combination with Summit Oatmeal Stout I think will get me to adventure more into darker ales and other brews. Bravo!"
"The beer is poured a brown/dark ruby colour with a nice off white head, with okay retention, but great retention. The nose of the beer is chocolaty and sweet, which is a great surprise. When drinking this beer it's apparent it's not a normal brown ale, but that makes it that much better. There is a nice chocolate flavour mixed with some great sweet malts. There is also a bit of maybe hazelnut in the back as well. The flavours are complex for this relatively low alcohol beer. To me, this is one of the ultimate session beers. I could and would drink this all night. The mouthfeel is solid as well."
"D- Very drinkable, nice solid beer, especially one that is in a can."
"Drinkability: Very good. Nice brown ale. A good canned beer that I would buy if it were local."
"Pours a dark brown with a thin creme head. Nose is vegetal. Minor coffee. Flavor is brightly coffee like. I feel like it's unroasted beans. Still gives a full and fairly robust profile though. I like. Feel is smooth on liquid and the carbonation is middle of the road (I remember the carbonation being abrasive when I had it on-tap.) I like this beer. Easily an all night brew (if it were readily available that is.)"
"And there goes 350 reviews. Time flies when you're drinking beer!"
"Black body with foam that is the true definition of creamy. It leaves rings of in the glass that are connected by sheets of lacing. Head retention is good, and stays for the majority of the glass. Toasty malt nose. This beer showcases the malt, very smooth with some mellow wood and tobacco up against brown sugar and dry malt, with a hint of apple from the yeast. An earthy hop presence is noticeable in the first few sips, and even more later into the session. This seems to be the point of intrigue for me, that lasting earthy bitterness that lingers into the aftertaste, but disappears shortly thereafter. Very smooth and medium bodied, not filling, easy to session without sacrificing flavor. Nice stuff."
"Surly Bender pours black with a large creamy tan head. The nose is roasty, coffee, and cocoa with some citrus hops in there too. There are some really bold flavors in here. There is a chocolate, roasted coffee and vanilla. There is also some fruitiness and some nice bitterness and citrus hops for a brown ale. Very drinkable."
"Awesome."
"I found no discernible difference from the can with this beer."
"d - Okay, but really I'm done after one."
"D - This flavor tires fast for me."
"Basically, this is just tons of fun, and that's even more impressive in a style that is usually staid."
"Drinkability is good. Bender is a very solid brown, I wish it was a widely available local value. As is, I'll just have to savor my one last can and keep my eye out for it in my future travels..."
"D: This is a brown ale, but oh so flavorful, thick, and balanced. A delicious beer and I am shocked this is only 5.10% ABV as it is so satisfying for this beer geek. The idea of sessioning this beer is appealing indeed. Whatever hype there is for this beer is definitely lived up to, and now I want to try some Coffee Bender."
"d= high, great session beer with the unique surly fresh taste. awesome beer from an awesome brewery!"
"D - Pretty easy to drink and pretty enjoyable"
"While I prefer Furious and Darkness this beer is no slouch and serves as a nice change of pace."
"I really wish I had more of these. I could see this one becoming one of my everyday beers in the fridge if only it was available here in NH. Thanks again Corey!"
"Very drinkable, lots of different flavors going on... they all swirl together and leave the mouth with an interesting aftermath."
"Overall: solid brew"
"Sweet caramel and pale chocolate malts hit the palate first, quickly giving way to a delectably bitter coffee and hop finish. For a brown ale, the flavor is complex and transitions nicely, but, as I've noticed of other canned craft beers, the middle notes fall a bit flat. Mouthfeel is pretty standard, but still good, with a medium-light body, gentle carbonation level, and a short-lived lingering bitterness on the finish. Overall, a highly drinkable brew, but if I were in the mood for a hoppy brown ale, Terrapin and Dogfish Head's India Brown ales edge out Bender (albeit slightly)."
"Mouthfeel is creamy and carbonated. It has a very nice texture to it. This is a very drinkable beer. I think I'll have to make an effort to find it around here."
"Very good full flavored beer! Has a nice complex flavor. Recomened"
"Drinkability - Heck yes. What do you expect? Its a Surly!!!"
"Thanks to Tolann for this one. I can't wait for the other can of Surly I've got. I owe you. Dry Dock?"
"Drinakability is off the charts. I got eight of these in a trade with OHLRangers, and I didn't review it till the last one because I was enjoying them too much."
"From a 16oz can. This beer pours a dark chocolate brown that has ruby hues when held up to the light. It poured an ample beige head that melts into just a thin layer around the rim of my Tripel Karmeliet tulip. The aroma is a good nuttiness up front, with hints of chocolate, vanilla, and oatmeal coming through. The taste is almonds and chocolate that turns into just a hint of vanilla and toffee. The mouthfeel is thin and a little over carbonated. This is another very drinkable beer by Surly."
"D - Big, roasty and nutty, with a good hop kick. Lots of flavors going on here, and they really come together in the finish. Solid beer from Surly."
"D- This could be a beer I go to a lot if it were local to me."
"d: Full flavored, but still fully quaffable. What a brown ale should be. Put this on the short list of excellent brown ales."
"Silky smooth on the tongue, medium bodied, and a perfect level of carbonation. Probably the easiest drinking beer I have ever had, and the definition of a session beer. One can is not enough. I could have this morning, noon, and night. Just has whatever you're in the mood for - roast & toasty, sweet, nutty, and hoppy. I love this beer and must have more."
"16oz can, what a solid brew out of a can. My I've had the 4 major Surly's out of can now and it's tough to decide a favorite. They are all pretty good. This one is dark and rich but still focused. You don't realize it comes from a can, a major achievement. Coffee, and great aroma. Really easy to drink and like I've said about other Surley cans, great price and quality."
"Drinkability: Okay, all preconceived notions about canned beer have been smashed. This beer is great! I either need to move to Minnesota or set up bi-weekly shipments from Packforever1976. How about Minnesotans? who wants to be a beer mule?"
"Pours brown in color. Looks a little thin on the pour and has clear/ruby highlights around the edges. Smell is hops and roasted malt. Taste is even more of the hops. There is a good roasty quality and some coffee as well. The oatmeal really smooths this beer out. This is good, just really thin for my liking. Another solid beer from Surly, but it's no Furious."
"Taste is crisp and tingly, slight hoppiness at first but the malt quickly takes over, weird aftertaste that I can't quite place but it doesn't really complement the beer, not as smooth as most oatmeal browns."
"This beer comes off to me as a cross between an Irish stout and Newcastle. Very dark brown, boardering on black. Nice head, no lace, good retention. Aroma is mild with a sweet malt character up front with a small dose of citrus hops. Flavour is rather bland. A little roasty, a little hoppy and kind of sweet. Very mild bitterness. Mouthfull is very creamy and smooth. Carbonation is medium. Not bad by any means."
"Big thanks to objectivemonkey for bringing this to Lawrence for me!"
"D - A great beer that I could see myself drinking all night long. The can I opened, however, didn't quite scream world class brew at me."
"Pours to a golden brown color with a thin, light tan head that leaves nice lacing. The smell is somewhat muted, even as it warms. Mostly a caramel-like maltiness and coffee undertones. The taste does not dissapoint with the malt flavors of caramel and coffee meeting a perfect hit of hops as it slides to a nice, lingering finish. This is scary stuff in the drinkability department - my tall-boy disappeared in no time flat. I could pound a few of these in a night without a problem. Looking forward to trying more Surly brews."
"All around a very solid beer. glad I got the chance to try it."
"D: This is certainly one of the best brown ales I've had. It's light enough that you could have quite a few. Will need to find more."
"Drinkability- yet another very sessionable beer from surly. Just wish I could get ahold of this more often."
"Proper serving temperature is key with this one. Ice cold, and it's mediocre, but allow it to warm to slightly below cellar temperature, and it's a killer drinker with some substance."
"D: what a great brown ale. so unique, great flavors and definitely worth a try. absolutely delicious."
"D: Very smoothe and easy drinking. Niceley balanced flavors. At 5.1% alcohol, I could easily do a session of this beer."
"Notes: One of the best Browns I've had. Makes those NewCastle boys look like a bunch of chumps."
"Thanks again Wankerweasal for the trade!!"
"D - Good session beer."
"D- I like this beer a lot. It taste really nice and goes down smooth."
"What does brown do for you? In this case brown (Brown Ale that is) is where it's at, at least for Bender. Certainly some suds we could see stocked in our fridge all year long. Paired well with teriyaki beef over a nutty brown rice."
"Pours a rich choclaty brown from the can with a slightly tan head that melts into the beer leaving a little sticky lacing on the glass. Doesn't really smell too complex and nothing jump out right away. Taste is....WHOAH! this may be the best brown ale I've ever had! Very rich and creamy. Just the right balance of roasted malts and chocolate. A touch of the right amount of hops makes this a stand-out beer. Light mouthfeel and extremely drinkable making this a must try. Oh how I envy the folks in Minnesota....if only for this beer!"
"I could drink this all night."
"It's a good beer, very solid, but not the best on my personal list of Brown Ales. Color is a translucent mohogony-molasses. It's very smooth, easy drinking, a great session beer. Has a real nice, flavorful taste, hints of nuts and caramel, a hoppy bitterness, but not overwhelming. The bitterness develops moreso as it nears the bottom of the glass... the taste & mouthfeel go through stages as the temperature rises. It doesn't have the full-bodied potency I had hoped & expected, not quite thick enough for my personal liking. Nevertheless, it's a very enjoyable brew. Looking forward to trying a few others from Surly."
"D - Surprisingly drinkable for such a dark looking beer with dark flavors. Easily my favorite brown ale due to the excellent use of oatmeal. Very drinkable. Of the two readily available Surly beers, I would say Bender is more impressive."
"Black in color with a thick frothy head upon pouring into a pint glass. Prickle is present on the side of the glass but not very active. Caramel malt nose. Smooth clean attack. Malty flavor with a growing caramel character towards the finish. Some coffee notes. I would say a B on my own flat scale compared to all beers."
"Eminently drinkable... worthy of being sessioned all night long, damn the 5% ABV!"
"Can bought while on a trip in MN. Pours a brown/crimson color. Short off-whire head. Smells fragrantly of dark malts, chocolate, some ethanol. Big, agressive grainy, fruity malt flavor. Roasty chocolate notes, burnt bark. nice hop bitterness, but not too much. quite tasty. Creaminess from the oats is nice. medium to full bodied for the style. Overall, a satisfying spin on the brown ale style. very tasty with a memorable flavor and mouthfeel."
"Poured from a 16oz can into a snifter. Hazy dark brown in color that produced a tan colored head and leaving generous lacing in the glass. Initial aroma is of dark chocolate and fruity esters. Taste is of fudge brownies, oatmeal, the slightest hop bitterness, and dark fruits such as raisins and plums. Mouthfeel is slick and full-bodied, nice carbonation. An all around excellent American Brown Ale. Surly has done it again!"
"Thanks for the trade Eric (DaPeculierDane)!"
"Like some of Surly's other beers, this seems like a unique take on a couple of different styles but it all works out quite nicely in the end. I had a bit of an issue with the nose but for the most part this was one extremely flavorful and incredible drinking Brown Ale. I nearly ran out of beer before I could finish reviewing, it was that quaffable."
"Very delicious brew from Surly. Borderline dry stout, as it finishes pretty dry with emphasis on the bitter malt flavors."
"Drinkability - Wow, this is very tasty. Perhaps my favorite brown ale - and that is saying a lot. Brown ales are not typically a style that I frequently reach for, but this is a damn good beer. Huge nose, decent flavor, low ABV, smooth creaminess makes for a great tasting, easy drinking beer."
"Bender's a very unique and excellent brown ale. Clearly the best I've had of the style. For the style, it's as good as I can imagine it being done. Once again, I'm left feeling disappointed that Surly's distribution is so limited. If you're in Minnesota, count your blessings. If you're not, start your search for Surly beers immediately."
"The taste starts tart, crisp, with dark chocolate, cocoa bitterness, hop profile is suttle semi-bitterness, strong burnt coffee. Roasted flavor profile dominates this beer. The flavor is nice, sweer oats, bitter, nice beer strong roasted flavors dominate this beer overall very nice offering."
"I could drink this brew til the cows came home... Its delicious, not topo strong, and surprisingly light... Fantastic brew!"
"D: A good solid beer, great taste and highly sessionable but once again I was expecting more in the hops department so it suffers just a little bit over all in my scoring."
"D: Super easy drinking beer. Would love to have this as a local."
"Drinkability: Very impressed with how drinkable this beer is. It's certainly a mixture of two distinct styles that offers the best of both worlds for lovers of both styles. Pick it up."
"Drinkability - very enjoyable. Thanks to WankerWeasel for the cans. While these are safe to take to the pool as is, I'll have to bring a Solo cup along or something; it just won't be right to keep this in the can."
"This does blur style guidelines and is a reflection of talent and craftsmanship. Befitting to its name, I could easily drink this endlessly, day and night."
"Drinkability- Very good, and very eccentric ale. Well balanced with lots of stuff going on. Would have again for sure."
"Perfect session beer imo. Bender's superb blend of flavor, tolerable ABV, and drinkability elevate this beyond any of the other beers in the style that I've tried."
"D : Really good. Definitely a session beer."
"A very nice brown ale. This is my first Surly and I'm impressed. I have more in my fridge to keep me waiting in anticipation."
"D: This is one hell of a sessionable brown ale and I could drink it all night long. Extremely well balanced and easy going down. Highly recommended!"
"D- @5%, this is a great beer and very sessionable."
"Very nice, especially freshly poured."
"This will be my second brew from Surly (the first being Furious). Thanks to danielphoran for the four pack. Poured in to a tulip glass an extremely dark color for a brown ale. Very dark brown, with a tan medium sized head, and ruby hues towards the bottom of the glass. Nose has lots of earthy spice, hops, light powdered chocolate, definite herbal tea smell, and just a little bit of coffee. Taste starts off on a very earthy hoppy note, followed by a nice round, roasty coffee/tea edge, and finally ending on a bitter note. Mouthfeel is medium, full of flavor, and leaves the palate without much of an aftertaste. It sort of comes in, hits you with a ton of fllavor, and then leaves as if it were never there. Usually I don't find darker ales to fall within the realm of session beers, bit this one might be an exception. A bit more body on this one, and you might be venturing in to Porter territory. Surly continues to impress me with this offering. If only I lived in Minnesota...cheers!"
"Thanks for hooking it up zealot! Decanted from the can into a pint glass. Pours an amber color with a small head that sticks around. Smells like citrus hops with caramel malts and a pleasant nuttiness underneath. Tastes very interesting. First there's bitter, resiny hops. Then the malts kick in with a nice breadiness, and a little caramel. Mouthfeel is right in the middle and smooth. Drinkability is massively high, as this beer goes down extremely easy. Overall this is a very interesting brown ale that's been hopped up to IPA levels. Totally into it."
"Dark red brown, with a nice head of off-white/beige foam. Aromas of steeped deep coffee, nice roasted malt, a bit of chocolate, a hint of vanilla, and some caramel candy. Taste is malty and roasty up front with some coffee and a tad of chocolate and vanilla in the malt profile. Hopping is light, but noticeable and blends the overall flavour very well. Mouth feel is medium bodied, but not thick, drinkability really remains quite awesome for a brown ale. One of the best browns I've had."
"This is a very drinkable brown ale."
"As Peter Griffin says, ""Fricking sweet"" I'd sell my mother to get another one of these, just not on mothers day."
"Bender pours a dark brown with ruby highlights and a good light tan head. nice lace. Nose is very malty with a touch of schwarz smell. Nice malty taste with good subtle coffee, some grain, ever so slight roastiness. Mouthfeel is good, a little dry. Drinkability is quite good, easily poundable. A good brown ale, but I don't think it is quite as spectacular as most feel it is. A solid brew, defenitely would be a regular if it was local. I would much rather have access to some Furious though! Good beer."
"Bender in the can is one of my favorite beers of all time. On tap it was not as good. I am hoping it was just a bad keg, or line and this is not the way it usually is. But this is all I have to go on."
"Got this one in Minnesota and took it along for the ride. 16 oz can into a pint glass. Pours a nice looking deep brown color with a finger of tan head. Fairly weak in the lacing department. I can smell is across the room; tons of caramel malt, spiced up with delicious funky hops. Lots of dried fruit aromas floating around. Flavor is excellent. Deep, roasted malt starts it off. Interesting lemony hops show up later and linger. Make sure to drink this one warm; otherwise you're missing on the real fun. Interesting roasted feel to the hops, how the two elements mix themselves together. Some light fruitiness in the taste as well. Body is full and delicious, creamy and with a perfect spicy carbonation. Overall, a very tasty beer. Doesn't really touch the Furious, in my mind, nor is it quite as good as the DFH Indian Brown, but its a solid effort, nonetheless."
"I would say this beer is almost porter like in smell and taste. I'm not a huge brown ale fan but this one was darn good."
"The taste is somewhere between a brown ale and an outmeal stout, hinting at chocolate and dark cherry with a bunch of hops thrown in to give it a citrus overtone. With medium mouthfeel and carbonation, tt was a nice surprise that I enjoyed quite a bit."
"Smooth, creamy, and would be an awesome go to beer."
"I loved this beer. If it were available near me it would always have a place in my fridge and belly."
"A very good brown."
"Pours a deep mahogany, very little head. smell is very light, but reminiscent of raisins, hints of vanilla. Taste is nice and malty, some fruity notes, faint coffee or tobacco, not much hops bitterness to speak of. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, a bit drying on the back end. A very good, drinkable brew. Wish this was distributed in my area, i'd definitely pick up some more."
"D - Overall a nice brown ale that I was a bit surprised to find such a strong orange taste in there that balances against the sweeter malts. I was a bit surprsied as to how much the orange hop flavor shined through but I guess I shouldn't have been given Surly's love of hops. An interesting twist and I will enjoy drinking the other 4 however I won't really go out of my way to get some more. A good deal though esp for the price."
"Definitely a well made beer, maybe its just not my style. Gotta get me some furious."
"D: A delight to drink.4.5/5"
"D - Great session beer. Whould agian love to have this beer in my area, but i will definately atempt to make what I have last as long as possible...Not making any promises though."
"As with Furious by the same brewer, I can't get into the ""Jesus came back as a beer!"" hype the brewery gets, yet there's no denying they make good stuff. This one is no exception. Bender is not an outstanding beer, but it is a long, long way from bad. Well worth seeking out if you're in their distribtion area."
"The beer pours a dark brown color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice roasted malt scent with just enough crystal malts to add a slightly sweet aroma. The taste is good. It has a smooth, roasted and crystal malt flavor that goes down real easy and finishes dry with a slight metallic edge. It has an excellent roasted character. The mouthfeel is great. It is a medium/full bodied beer with near perfect carbonation. This a very good drinking beer. It's a wonderful example of the style; great taste and aroma. Thanks again to jjayjaye for for hooking me up"
"This beer poured a lovely dark brown and immediately had a hint of banana esters. It was lightly nutty with some chocolate and caramel notes. Overall it was an excellent beer and the best I've ever had out of a can. I only wish it had a more widespread distribution!"
"Mouthfeel is rich and creamy. Starts of malty (chocolate, nuts, toffee) then the hops join in (bitter, citrus) and fruits, just to mix it up a little."
"A rather good brown, up there with my local go-to, Sixpoint Brownstone. Cheers to Mully for the chance to try it."
"This would make for an incredible session beer if I had more than one here in California. Really smooth in body and taste."
"Pours a barely translucent dark brown with mahogany hues and a nice foamy tan head that resists fading. It leaves good amounts of sticky lacing patterns behind. The smell is really nice. The aroma is primarily sweet malty chocolate and brown sugar. There's something else there also that I can't put my finger on, not molasses, but it's sending ""thickness"" signals. A nice tingle of carbonation, full bodied mouth feel with pleasant creamy texture that finishes with a gentle note of hops. Full of flavor, the mouth complements the Tootsie roll chocolate mixed with 'malt shop' something and Malted Milk Ball...what-ever-it-is. An easy drinker and the 5.1% ABV makes it one of the best sessionable things going on...and I bet it's lo-cal too! Also want to thank Pitmonkey for the recent trade. Highly recommended."
"D- heavier in the stomach that I wouldn't want to have several of these in 1 sitting. Smooth enough tho that I'm not going to share my pub can. Such a good beer again from Surly. Love this stuff and will have to get more to replenish our stash."
"Cheers!"
"Rich dark brown/black pour with a big lasting tan head. Smell is very smooth, and muted but a bit sourish as if not quite fresh. Some roasty notes in there as well. Nice mouthfeel. Smooth, creamy and perfectly carbonated. Flavor is nice for a brown. Not intensely flavorful, but nice and malty, with some roastiness and oaty creaminess. Good, but the smell killed it for me, and perhaps it just wasn't quite fresh."
"Dare I ask, could this be a great sessions beer? Too bad I can't get it more often."
"FYI--Their beers aren't filtered or pasteurized...so keep 'em cold or they may suffer."
"If I didn't live in MN I would have to move here for this beer. I consider Bender as my go to beer for any drinking occasion. Wonderful appearance, smell, taste , mouthfeel, etc... I like brown ales in general - add the oatmeal smoothness and light hoppy presense and this is a great drinker. This is one of those beers that stretches the limits of its category, almost creating a new one. Now if I can only find a Coffee Bender tapping..."
"Overall this was one the best brown ales I have ever had. It was richly complex and sweet and very full bodied. Very cream and almost porter like in its presentation this was just outstanding. Not only would I not turn this away if it came my way, but I will actively seek it out for sure. Go get this it really is a winner."
"I wish Surly was available in SC. This would be a go-to beer for me. Extremely tasty, one of the best brown ales I've had. Highly recommended."
"A nice touch on the tongue where this one begins a bit thin but leaves the mouth feeling well taken care of - like it leaves a skim around the mouth keeping the flavor going an going...I could see haveing a few of these but the jury is still out on if I would drink it all day or night. I love the drinkability of browns and the hops kind of ruins that - but - who knows."
"Matt, thanks again .... I've been dying to try Surly beers and you were the hook-up. Let's do more business."
"Taste - Layers of caramel, vanilla and cocoa play off of a toasty, bittersweet foundation. Smooth and full on the palate with a dry coffee-like finish. Impressive complexity without compromising drinkability."
"Drinkability is amazingly high and in the session range, this is probably the most flavorful brown ale I have ever had, the oatmeal, cocoa, and hops are all so well-balanced that i wish i had better access to Surly beers, looking forward to more of their beers very soon"
"Pours a cloudy, dark brown with the tan one finger head that recedes fairly quick while leaving some nice lacing. Smells of chocolate, caramel, roasted malt, and a slight hint of hops. Taste is amazing, very well rounded and not like another run of the mill brown ale you might expect. Drinkability is excellent, I can easily session this beer during disc golf tournaments. Thank you Surly!"
"This is my new favorite beer! I can't wait to try the other Surly goodies. If they're anything like the Bender, I'll be incredibly impressed."
"Sure, it's a very stout-like brown ale. What else would you expect from this brewery? And besides, I'm in the camp that says the average brown ale could use a kick in the ass. Here's that kick in the ass."
"Great brown ale I could drink these all night real easy drinking"
"Overall- A little bit thicker and richer than most brown ales I have had. Nice spin on the style and an all around good brew. One of the better brown ales on the market. It is a shame it is so hard for me to come by. I really like the chocolate tones that it has in it. Very nice!"
"D - This is my second Surly product and it didn't disappoint."
"D - So smooth and tasty. I could drink this all night."
"D - I want a neverending supply of this."
"D- very good"
"Had this on tap at the Hopleaf a while ago. I liked it, and it was a slightly unusual take on a brown ale, but it didn't blow me away like Furious did. Poured a dark brown with a creamy head that fades away to athin cap that sticks around. Excellent lacing. The aromas are spicy and malty up front, almost prickly, and then slightly sweeter and more roasty on the finish. There is a slight sour graininess at the end as well. Almost porter-like in its aromas. The taste is very smooth and the flavors are a little lighter than expected from the nose. Light chocolate, light roastiness, fresh cream, and a light grainy flavor at the end (rye?). Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with some light grainy tannins on the finish. A good effort if not speectacular. Goes down real easy."
"D: So good, highly recommended. This is a hophead's brown ale yet still has a great smoothness and complex malt backbone. Go find some and drink it!"
"Thanks to Pitmonkey for the opportunity. Pours an impressive black that is actually a deep amber/brown when held up to the light. An off white 1/2 inch head meets the top of my imperial pint glass. The nose seems kind of weak, but I do enjoy the presence of the hops in there, as I do in most beers. Maybe I have it too cold but all I can really pick out is a light presence of some roasted chocolate. Taste is much more complex. Nice bitterness up front that transforms to a bitter chocolate that moves onto a subtle roasted sweetness and silky all the wayh through. A very balanced and layered beer despite my 3.5 in the ""smell"" category. Would make one hell of a session beer."
"A big thanks to Faro for sending me this brew in the Secret Santa '07 BIF. Served slightly chilled in an Imperial pint glass, from a sixteen ounce can. Poured out a deep, dark brown that had some garnet highlights. Almost two fingers of thinnish, bubbly, tan head. Decent retention on this one, leaving some thin streaky lace on the glass. Nose was a bit fruity, hoppy, and malty with an almost woody aroma tucked away nicely in the background. Taste was quite malty with a bit of plum in there. Just a tiny bit of noticeable hops in the taste. Even a bit of underlying coffee, brown sugary sweetness, and a thick nuttiness. Mouthfeel was medium bodied and smooth, with just enough carbonation.Very good drinkability."
"Very balanced in both smell and taste. Smooth is the first word that comes to mind. Roasted slightly sweet malts with a perfect balance of hops. A little watery on the mouthfeel, but for the style, not bad. A supremely drinkable, solid beer."
"D- This is an extremely drinkable brew, not only is it tasty but at 5% you can easily throw a few back without worrying about passing out face down on the floor."
"Pours a hazy deep amber color with a tan head. In the aroma, sweet oatmeal, yet kind of bland. In the taste, sweet oatmeal, and somewhat malty. A decent bitterness in the mouthfeel and a sweet malty aftertaste. Interesting brown with the oatmeal presence, smooth and a small bitterness."
"I came in expecting a brown ale, but got something a little off center. It was tasty regardless. Thank you Aaron. :)"
"The overall uniqueness of this beer has me very intrigued and wanting more."
"This is a session beer for me. Was the perfect post diner beer."
"I love Surly... Discovered it while drinking with a friend back in Minneapolis.... A shame I live in NY now."
"Mouthfeel-bitterness followed by a killer brown ale flavor. The bitterness gives way to a sweet roasted malt flavor towards the finish. A froth on the palate intensifies the hops and releases some chocolate and espresso flavors. Some vanilla flavors come through also. Almost like an sweet Indian Brown ale. Very tasty and drinkable. Looking forward to more Surly!"
"Overall- I had this for breakfast, and sh!t it was good!! I can't believe I was in MN last year and didn't get any of this. 1 of the best canned beers I've had so far!"
"Thanks so much tayner...they came and went quickly!"
"This is a top notch brown ale. Good stuff, funky packaging."
"More head than body with a strong pour. Deep ruby brown body hosts a thick foamy light tan head with nice staying power. Nose is full of spicey zest and yeasty malt. Enters the mouth with a nice mingling of hops and rich roasted oats. Slightly burnt malt gives almost a coffee like after taste. Hops have a little bite on the end of the palate. This is a unique brew that I could drink everyday and that would go with a variety of foods. Boldly drinkable with a very bitter rich mouthfeel."
"Deep dark brown in appearance with a thick head. Aromas of coffee, roasted malts, and a hint of hops. Taste of chocolate, coffee, popcorn, roasted malts and a small bit of citrus to finish it off. Mouth fell is slick and light. Drinkability is definitely easy. All Brown Ales should taste this good. Highly recommended!"
"D: I know it's not the same style but I just want to say ""Guinness, eat your heart out"". The drinkability of this is everything Guinness Draught wishes it could be."
"Note: After drinking this beer I know why it is rated amongst the best for the style."
"Drinkability: Well crafted brew that is a pleasure to drink. I hope this will have wider availability in the future."
"The beer, poured from the can into my sniffer, sported a clear, ruby brown color. I really enjoyed the aroma of this beer. It had a sweet grainy quality with fruity tones. The flavor had an upfront hop presence with toasted grains and a slight sour finish. The mouthfeel was a little off because of a lack of carbonation. To be fair, the beer was on the warm side and the can had been open for a little while, but nevertheless, this is what I tasted. All together, I thought this was a decent beverage. I like the concept of canned micros."
"Not to sound snobby, but it's been month since I've had a beer from a can. Nice to see it can be done without compromising on flavor."
"Overall: I have heard rave reviews about Surly and I can see why. The guys over there can brew great beers no doubt about it. Furious is so big and aggressive, and this one left me saying this is what a brown should be. Cheers to ObMonkey for sending a bevy of Surly brews over. I will kill for a growler of darkness, I'm begging name your price, eh beer!"
"It is drinkable, and i could drink many of these if that was the session beer of the night, but i wouldnt seek them out."
"This is my second favorite Surly beer behind the Furious. I am not huge on Brown Ale's which is why I did not rate this higher, but this is my fav. It is very drinkable, and you can definately taste the carmel. The 4.0 for mouthfeel is becaue it was good but I think it could be fuller."
"Drinkability: I could put back a few of these. This is a good, easy drinking beer. Its dark, but not to dark. Its complex, but not too complex. It would be nice to have this one in my fridge at all times."
"Pours near black with dark brown highlights. Thick creamy khaki colored head. Malty aroma consists of cocoa and chocolate with hints of fruit. Medium-bodied mouthfeel that's fairly smooth. Some carbonation around the edges. Chocolate and roasted malt flavor initially. Very smooth. Some burnt malt appears toward the middle and the finish is pretty clean. Very enjoyable brown ale. Nicely done!"
"Bottom line: This is an excellent example of the style...one of the best that I've tried to date. Highly recommended!!"
"D- not the quickest drinker, but the thicker body is the x factor there"
"You gotta try it, cause  this is one great canned beer, meant for a glass. Lightweight shipping, no light struck problems, perfect size of 16oz  the way of the future!"
"I apologize for the comparison I made above. Bender does not deserve to have such garbage mentioned in it's review. Needless to say, this is clearly the best canned beer I've ever had. And it's certainly one of my favorite beers I've had in awhile overall. Now how am I going to get more?"
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not very filling, decent kick, nice representation of style, this is a good beer to drink for an evening if you’re in the mood for the style. I could certainly enjoy throwing back a few of them."
"Highly recommended, and hopefully I will get to try the tea bagged, bourbon barrel, and coffee versions of this on draft someday"
"Medium body, moderately carbonated, and a nice, crisp, slightly dry quality. This is a pretty easy beer to drink. It's good for a taking a decent amount of time with, but also for just kicking back and having a couple."
"One of the more drinkable brown ales out there this is one that you can drink all night if you wish. This isn't quite as good as DFH Indian Brown though."
"Drinkablity- Off the charts! I could easily put down a six pack of these 16 ounce cans without thinking twice. This may have passed Old Chub as my favorite beer in a can. Hell this may have surpassed almost all dark beers Ive had. So unique and absurdly balanced. Really sucks I only have one left. Thanks again to mnstorm99, spectacular beer!"
"drinkability: i think i could drink about 60 of these in a sitting - so i'd say its pretty drinkable"
"FANTASTIC!"
"I poured the beer into a pint glass, and it looked perfect. Dark brown color with a thick frothy tan foam. The aroma was near perfect too, sweetly malty and a bit of roasted malt. The taste was very nice, complex in that there were sweet malt flavors and bitter malt (roasted) flavors, both mixing together with an after-taste similar to a chocolate malt. The mouthfeel is thick enough to make this seem like a meal, very very nice brown ale. Maybe my favorite brown ale."
"Mouthfeel is very good, almost silky and extremely easy to drink."
"Possibly the best ""brown ale"" I've tasted."
"Overall-I wish more Browns were like tis one, really complex and malty liek a brown should be bu with a good dose of roasted barely and hops to liven things up."
"Appears clear dark brown with rich ruby red hues in the light. 1/2 inch of thick, lasting tan head covers the glass with great lacing. Smells of caramel, chocolate, roasted malt, and grassy hops. Taste is almost more of a porter than a brown ale with bitter cocoa and caramel beginnings, coffee, and a grassy hop finish. Medium in body and very smooth with low carbonation. My first Surly brew, but definitely not my last, one of the best canned beers I've ever had, surprisingly rich for a brown ale."
"Brown ales are not my style but the hoppiness really make this more appealing to me. Definately will continue to consume this great beer in the funky 16oz can."
"D: The abv is low enough that this is easily a session beer. A nice drink from Surly, who has yet to disappoint me."
"overall, i really enjoyed this beer, and recommend it to anyone. I usually dont think of a brown ale with spicy food, but i think that this one would accompany spicy food nicely"
"The mouthfeel was fairly thin. The drinkability was very good. I think it was best when it was really cold."
"Excellent brown ale and something I will get more of. As a hop lover, this is not a style that normally gets my attention, but this one certainly did."
"Full and creamy mouthfeel, a bit powdery and tannic, but satisfying. Way way way drinkable, one of the best brown ales I've had. Many many thanks to BuckeyeNation for sending this one my way."
"Overall a tasty and highly quaffable brown ale. Complex."
"two best Brown Ales I've ever had."
"Truly great beer for a style that is often over-looked."
"overall, a highly enjoyable brew! I'll have to seek out more offerings from this brewery. I love the 16 oz. cans also."
"Quite good."
"16 oz can. The beer is a solid brown color with a finger of head that settles out at just a coating over top. Clarity looks good and there is almost no carbonation seen in the brew. The aroma is light roast with a mild nuttyness with caramel sweetness throughout. The flavor is more forceful than the aroma. Initial flavor is nuttyness with nice roast hitting behind that. It then goes to a caramel and nut again finishing with a mild citrus and pine hop and bitter. Mouthfeel is moderate with a minimal carbonation. This one is tasty. It brings a lot of flavor and is a nice brown ale. I would have this one again for sure."
"Pours a very dark brown color with a creamy tan head that dies pretty quick and leaves lacing. Smells very mild of toast, malt, and cocoa. Tastes a tiny bit of chocolate notes, roasted nuts, a citrusy rind, and some nice hops at the finish. This is very tasty and different for a brown ale as it finishes with some bitter hops. Feels crisp, very smooth and lively in the mouth from carbonation. Very drinkable. This is a light, delicious and different brew. Well done Surly."
"The color was a dark brown with ruby higlights against a strong light. It had an large beige head that slowly settled to a constant film. Good lacing. The aroma was roasted malts, toffee and a little coffee. For a brown, it has a really good smell. The taste was awesome. From the 1st drink, I knew I had to start trading for more. It starts with a light hop bite then the malts kick in with a great slightly roasted bitter finish. Had a great balance. This would make an excellent session beer. Also would be a great beer to try on your friends who are looking to trade up in taste. Overall, an excellent beer and glad I finally got to try it. Gonna have to find more. Highly recommend. Would be heavy rotation if avail here."
"I'm surprised to see this is a ""brown ale," because I had it on tap and it looked and tasted like a stout. As such, it was a good, solid, hearty stout, but without much complexity. The aroma and taste had plentiful roasty malts with some distinct coffee notes. It had a relatively clean finish for a stout (but I guess that's because it's a brown ale). I probably wouldnt go out of my way for this, but its good choice when its available"
"16 ounce can. Dark ruby color with a full, wispy light tan colored head. Light chocolate and grassy hop aromas. Very light chocolate and roast flavors, with hints of hazelnut. Smooth with a nice finish. Better than most brown ales, but still as a beer, its just ok."
"Great example of a brown ale. Quite a tasty brew that I am really glad I was able to sample on tap."
"Thanks, tempest, for the opportunity"
"D - A solid brown. All 3 Surly beers I have tried now have bold dominant flavors that are enjoyable (truly fitting the name Surly)."
"Clear and dark brown with ruby highlights and a short, dense tan head off a vigorous pour. Plenty of fine lacing. Aromas of pine, caramel, toffee, and lightly roasted malts dominate. Some fruit character, a bit figgy. Maltiness was reminiscent of old ales. Stiff bitterness throughout, quite strong in the finish. Toffee and caramel sweetness provide some balance and light pine/floral hops round things out. Medium body and carbonation, some creaminess and a little dry. This beer definitely shows some aggression, but it's really quite nice. I'd love to try this on tap. Recommended!"
"My first taste of a Surly Brewing Company brew. Turns out, it was worth the patience and the hype. The sound of the beer hitting the bottom of the glass promises malty richness. The appearance is a meduim viscous, dark brown with ruby highlights. A 1"" head never fell. Aromas of solid barley malts, semi-sweet cocoa, and bold coffee notes blended well with complementary caramel, toffee, and a touch of fermented roasted malts. The flavors closely resemble the terrificly balanced aromas but show impressive intensity, strenth, roundness, and without compromising the balance. The cocoa flavors portray mild bitterness and solid richness. The coffee is very Columbian, and the hop bitterness balances the bitterness found in the cocoa and coffee. A mild lacto-sweetness rounds out the coffee acidity well. As the beer falls into the finish a firm nutty (pecan) flavor intensifies and carrys the beer into the finish. Very clean and bitter-balanced in the finish, allowing a soft, coffee / chocolate lingering. Not sure if this is the best Brown that I have ever has, but I am certain that I have had none better. Thanks Nathan15."
"All in all, this was a very unique and intense brown ale. Few others in its category even come close to displaying the complexities found in this brew. I only wish it were available in my part of the country."
"Can courtesy of Stine: Poured a cloudy dark brown color ale with a nice foamy head with better then average retention. Aroma of caramel malt with light bitter hops. Taste is also dominated by caramel with some light bitter hops. Body is quite full with some great carbonation. Overall, I was a bit disappointed with this one considering the brilliance of the two other offerings I had from this fine brewer."
"Pours a dark-dark brown with a semi-opaque hue and a small one finger khakit colored head that dies down quickly to a thin layer which stays throughout. Stickiness is pretty good, not the best for a brown ale though. Very nice on the nose with a sweet malty mix of chocolate, oatmeal, and caramel. Simple but good, me likey. Taste starts off with a quick subtle hop bite but is then taken over by a smooth flakey oatmeal goodness. Flavor ends with a sweet coffee/cream like taste that lasts forever on the tongue. Mouthfeel is fairly full bodied with a good amount of carbonation, very smooth going down. Drinkability is great, could easily be a session beer. More breweries need to make quality brown ales like this. Good work Surly."
"Upon opening, can foamed over, then poured into an imperial pint glass, forming a 2"" brown head over the slightly cloudy chestnut brown brew. Head lasts amazingly, with hearty frothy lacing. Aroma is hearty grains, with a touch of fruitiness and alcohol. Taste is follows along, thick maltiness with a twinge of fruit. Mouthfeel is creamy smooth, and drinkability is very easy as well. Made my first Surly worth the wait."
"Well I was expecting a bit more after having the Cynic Ale but this beer is still pretty solid. A brown ale it is, maybe not the best ever but still rather respectable especially considering many folks avoid this style like the plague for some reason. The smell is really the only thing rubbing me the wrong way here but that's a big part of tasting unfortunately. Hopefully the Furious won't let me down."
"D: An easy-drinking, nicely complex brown ale, sessionable at 5.1% ABV; maybe a little bitter/hoppy at 45 IBU for my taste, at least style-wise. Regardless, a very good one that's worth seeking out. Cheers to Surly Brewing for crafting another fine beer."
"As I finish the beer I close my eyes and take a few sips. I could swear I was drinking an oatmeal stout. Coffee, chocolate, and cherry intermingled with that wonderful oat bite. Cool beer."
"The Mad Capper in Stillwater Minnesota has this in a can. They pour it into a tulip glass for you. It's presented well, and has become a hit among domestic macro drinkers.The brown/porter/stout is great combination giving it a lively dark color with a hint of sweetness, and modest alcohol content."
"D: There is a bit too much yeast in the flavor and certainly in the aroma. Other than that, it is a solid beer."
"Served in my official Surly glass given to me in a trade  this beer is definitely brown. It has a high foamy head that seems like stick around. The aroma is faint but just slightly sour. The taste is malty and hoppy. The mouthfeel is medium to full. This beer really comes to life in your mouth  Im impressed."
"Have I said how much I love great beer in a can. Well I do, imagine how much easier shipping would be if the norm was craft beer in a can; still I do find the champagne cork finish too perfect for certain styles of beer. This is a great brew, I really like the aromatic complexity (especially the surprise oak-like aromatics) and the flavor aint half bad either. The oak notes even start to creep into the flavor of this beer towards the end of my glass."
"Pours a nice clean dark brown color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger plus tannish creamy head, lots of nice sticky lacing throughout the drink. The nose is malty, slightly roasty, with a nice touch of caramel. The taste is malty, lots of caramel. There is a tangy/bitter finish. Medium body. Very drinkable, probably the best brown ale I've had to date."
"Can. Poured a clear purplish-brown color with a thin light-brown head. Chocolate, nutty, and malty aroma. Awesome full mouthfeel. Flavor is a nice brown sugar and malty combo. Sweet, yet a nice bitter, hoppy finish. So far, I'm digging the Surly brews."
"Creamy medium body. Smooth and easy drinking. Why, oh why, don't you Surly guys come out east?"
"Drinkability is top notch. All day.. every day... a perfect example of an American Brown, and would be an ideal session beer."
"Creamy mouthfeel helps blend in all the soft flavors very well..slightly dry in the finish. Very tasty, now I see what all the fuss is about...these folks at Surly seem to know what they're doing."
"Very drinkable brew. Would make a great segue into porters and stouts for novices to those styles due to its very mild roastiness. A great and easily drinkable brown ale in its own right and well deserving of the hype. I will be looking for this surprisingly complex brown ale again, and would enjoy seeing how it stacks up against other similar brews i enjoy."
"drinkability - I like brown ales, and this is one of the best I have tried in awhile."
"Edit: I brought some home and it has been in the fridge since laet May (4+ months). My review and impressions stand...the can preserved this low ABV beer perfectly. It is a bit more bitter and a bit more creamy in the mouth than I remember...therefore I will increase the ""mouthfeel"" score from 3 to 3.5."
"Surly made its way to Iowa (shout out to mom). Pours a dark reddish brown color, like dark cherries. Nice 4 finger head that left frothy lacings on the side of the glass. Smell of malts, fruits, yeast, vanilla, dark chocolate. Ths taste is def. not what i expected. It almost hits you like a stout. Dark roasted malts, hops, chocolate, coffee, nuts, smoky meat. Amazing! medium bodied, nice carbonation. A trreat to my taste buds."
"Bender is a very, very dark brown beer. The head is a coffee-stain color and bumpy around the edges. It smells like chocolate milk as well as oats, mmm. The taste is really, really good but I cant liken it to another flavor. The mouthfeel is very smooth. I dont usually like brown ales but this one is a standout beer. I also really like the 16 ounce cans Surly uses, nice."
"ironically enough, i had a craving for a coke and didn't have any. so i had this instead. going into the nonic it looked like a coke in terms of color, just not quite as black. tilting the glass shows this beer's clarity. light brown head. sweet chocolate aromas along with coffee beans, brown sugar, dark dried fruit and toffee with some dark bread notes thrown in. moderately sweet going down with some light underlying hop bitterness and carbonation preventing it from becoming cloying. this drinks more like a doppelbock than an ale to me. medium mouthfeel. some roasty and nutty notes on the back end. really good stuff at this abv and plenty going on to keep your interest."
"Pours a clear reddish brown, nice thick tan head forms, settles down to a decent layer, some spiral lacing on the glass. Looks like a brown ale. Smell is sweet and malty, toffee, earth, floral, some citrus, bread, nice light roast, smells pretty great. Taste is nice malty caramel up front, citrus, grass and bread, roast, iron, fruits in the finish, nice bitterness, lots of flavour. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, low carbonation, very smooth, pint is going quick. Nice example of an underappreciated style! Thanks Chris!"
"A bit of silky mouthfeel. Medium body, lower carbonation. Lots of flavors going on here. Complex, especially for a 5% Brown Ale. Fantastic."
"My wife's favorite beer. Brown Ale is the closest thing to call this beer although it is much deeper than any othe Brown I have had yet. Beautiful dark brown pour, with a disappering tan head. Nice lace that clings well to the glass. Smell is somewhat malty with a nutty tinge to it. flavor a touch of nutty hops and big malty finish with touches of carmel and coffee like flavors. This is not my favorite style of beer, but they packed alot of flavor into this one. If there are other Browns out there like this I might have to start drinking more."
"Thanks to WankerWeasel for this work of art!"
"Can obtained from DBL in Minneapolis- poured into a Russian River tulip glass. Pours out a cola/rootbeer colour. Not much head to speak of. Smells nutty and some hops. Mouthfeel is very smooth (from the oats) with moderate carbonation. Very tasty brown ale, the hops add nice flavour without too much bitterness. Typical brown ale malt- nutty, roasty without heavy body. The oatmeal adds texture and an added taste dimension. This is a good session brew- not up to the level of Furious, but a great effort."
"Had this one on tap a while ago. Presented a wonderful dark brown in the pint glass. I remember being surprised by the flavor of this one. It is not like other brown ales I have had but it is definitely a wonderful beer with very complex flavor. The flavor is nutty, with hints of chocolate and a lot of malt with just the right amount of hops to bring it all together. Delicious."
"An absolutely delicious beer. Good hop character leaning toward pine, bittering and a bit flora. Brown sugar and milk chocolate with dried fruit and nuts. Carbonation is a bit prickly and couldn't be any better for this beer. This is an absolute gem and maybe the best session beer I've ever tried."
"I think I'm ready for another one already. Damn fine brew. Definitely lives up to the hype."
"The oatmeal does wonders for this beer. It really brings out the mouthfeel and head retention and works well with the typical brown ale flavor profiles. This one goes down easy, but I couldn't put back as many as I could of a normal brown due to how heavy this one sits on the stomach. This is a must try though, no doubt...the best brown I've had, period."
"D - Overall, a very solid beer, in the can or on-tap."
"Drinkability is stellar. Low enough alcohol to session, but intensely interesting in flavor and mouthfeel that one is completely satisfying as well. Strongly recommended."
"16 oz can. Sea salt and orange zest aroma. Wispy. Moist and fresh. Oat dust and lemon juice. Restrained. Pours a touching florid mahogany, with blood red fringe and a soapy tan head, creamy. Nice lacing. On the tongue, a robust kick of malty sugars and roasted malt. Begins with a salty sea oat sweep and then slides into a coarse and grainy tooth of grain, orange peel, toasted almond and sweet honey. The oat brings in great character to this brown. Not overly hoppy, in my opinion, a nice balance with some floral and resin bitterness in the back end. A rather quaffable and delicious brew. Nicely constructed."
"This is the first sessionable beer I've had in a while. Low alcohol combined with big flavor is something I usually don't encounter. Surly has brewed up a nice concoction here."
"d - very drinkable, a great sessionable brown if I've ever had one"
"D: Superlative drinkability. This is a fantastic sessionable brown ale that only loses points for being a little on the thin side at first pour."
"Prosit und Zum Wohl, MK"
"D: A fine brown ale from Surly. Excellent balance and amazing mouthfeel leaves the palate wanting more."
"Taste is the same but more. Slightly thin mouthfeel but made up for with the very nice taste. And at 5.1% ABV a very nice session beer."
"Pours a coffee brown with a decent sized medium tan head that slowly fades. Aroma is rich and malty, some cola-y sweetness with some fruitiness. Rich and malty in the taste as well, some chocolate, big dose of caramel malt and finishing with a nice hoppy dryness. Fairly smooth with a tingle of spicy hops on the tongue. An easy to drink and solid brown."
"Between this and Furious it's easy to see how Surly is becoming a force to reckon with in the Midwest. I find myself coming around to the cans too. Go on Surly!"
"thanks to my sis for hooking this up for x-mas!"
"Pours cola-brown to the eye, and a deep dark amber when held to the light. Good clarity and carbonation looks about right -- a can-conditioned beer? Sure, that's a step in the right direction. Uniform tan head settles after a good couple of minutes after a medium pour from the bottom-open can (I collect these things, folks!) Good lacing. Very good aromatics on the nose, merging 1 part of the straight-up malt sweetness I'd expect from a brown with 2 parts hop (bitter, aromatic) and 2 parts very good dark malt qualities: I'm catching notes of ripe red apple under some cherry tartness, as well as toffee and light cocoa. Poured this cold, but let it warm a spell. Light on the tongue upon the first sip, with big toffee and cocoa notes. Great aromatics, a definite marriage of porter and brown ale. Slightly tangy, with the cherry tartness from the nose coming through, and supple hop bitterness helping to balance this. Not as sweet as a lot of the brown ales, but on-par with most of the better ones for drinkability. Fairly roasty malt qualities here ala a porter, but with more dryness than many porters . . . an accomplished blend of the Brown and Porter styles. Alcohol comes through at times, but fairly unobtrusively. I can't really find the APA-derived stylistic tendency in here apart from the hopping, and again I find this more in line with a West-coast American Porter - tomato - tomahto, eh? Excellent drinkability, but I'm personally torn: as I drink it I look fo the malty sweetness (and yes, even some of the diacetyl) of a couple of my favorite American Brown Ales, but halfway through I get the drying hop bite and a rather quick finish. Mouthfeel and body are a wee bit on the thin side, but in fact this does nothing but improve drinkability - no disrespect intended, but I see this as a great ""style cheater"" to a nitro stout ala Guinness Draught. I have enjoyed Bender served fresh from the tap on several occasions and it's been very good each time, and this can follows suit, in fact it may even be better than the taps! Great consistency, great local availability, and great packaging too. So when is Surly gonna bring these great canned ales to the rest of the (non-beergeek) world outside of Minnesota? That's the $10,000 question. I'll bet the craft beer-drinking Midwest is waiting for Surly with open arms. . . . Bring On The Cans!"
"Dark, molasses brown body with a dense finger of light tan head. Laces up the glass nicely. Brown sugar oatmeal malt, nutty toasted aroma, and milk chocolate, set against herbal hops. Toasted, dark chocolate bitterness soon gives way to chewy, sugary oatmeal and chocolate. Damn fine. Light herbal bitterness takes it away, with leftover chocolate and light coffee in the finish. Medium-full body with a creamy, coating feel. Well made and unique."
"Fresh and tasty pint can, thanks to Tempest. Large brown head on dark brown, much like a coffee. Moderate pleasant mocha chocolate coffee aroma, and the taste does deliver. Modest roast, malty without sweet. Secondary a bit dry and bitter. Very drinkable. A few minutes later, it is all gone."
"Overall I thought this beer had some good depth. It was very drinkable, but I would have scored it higher if some of those individual flavors opened up more. Thanks to SkinnyElvis for this one, my first from Surly, and hopefully not my last..."
"Not bad at all. I must say I liked it better on tap, but Id be happy to have another any day."
"Overall, I'm not really sure what the hype is about. I thought it was good but it didn't really knock my socks off in any way. Maybe I'm just not a huge Brown Ale fan?"
"Big Can of Kick Ass Thanks to BigHuge for this Treat."
"Quite nice. Well-balanced and very well done with a lot of dark malt flavor, but not so much dark malt acidity, astringency, or bitterness. The hop flavors come and go nicely; and it's got enough going on to keep it interesting."
"D: One of the more complex brown ales I've had. Very nice."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: This beer is medium bodied and well carbonated. The beer has a very creamy mouthfeel. This beer is a dam tasty beer treat. I could session this beer all night long. The 16 ounce tall boy is a nice touch. I am going to have to get some more of this beer."
"This is one drinkable beer. Not too heavy on the palate but not too light either but as goldilocks said, it was just right. Do yourself a favor and get some of this."
"*As I drink my second one of these I am tweaking the ratings up a little. This is highly drinkable and for a brown ale has more flavor and character than most...also looked almost ""regal"" in nature as it poured from the can."
"Surly Bender is fandamntastic beer. It instantly rockets to the top of my 'most favored brown ales' list along with the versions from Bell's and Dogfish Head. The fact that it's hoppier than both is further cause for celebration. I wonder if it's possible for SurlyMan to swing down to Des Moines in the midst of delivering his wonderful beer to the good folks of Minneapolis-St. Paul? Thanks feloniousmonk, but two cans isn't going to hold me for very long. I foresee a lot of road trips in a northerly direction."
"The body is just right, medium bodied and easy to drink but feeling full and just very well put together. This is a beer for beer drinkers, easy to drink if you just want a beer, comlex enough to make you ponder it should you want to. In addition to Furious, a very good beginning line-up to what I'm sure will be a very successful brewery."
"Surly in cans! Since I don't particularly like bars this is excellent news. Bender is an excellent beer and great for sessions. Highly recommended."
"I've recently been drinking more American brown ales (with a new appreciation) but this one easily takes the cake. None are better than this one."
"The flavor has the caramel and bready maltiness, along with a pleasant chocolate and roasted maltiness. It is smooth drinking and somewhat creamy in texture. It has a nice light hop bitterness throughout balancing well with the maltiness. Damn this is a smooth drinking beer. I could put down several of these in a sitting. Great beer, way to go Surly."
"This beer pours an opaque brown color with some mahogany aroun the edges of the glass. The head is three fingers in height and recedes slowly into thick lacing. The aroma is of chocolate, toffee, and nuts with a noticable fruity hop presence. The taste begins with toffee and nuts, moves into some fruitiness in the finish, then back to toffee, nuts, and malt in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with nice carbonation, and is rather smooth and silky. Overall, this is a great beer that I will drink again and again. It has been over six months since I last had it, so I can't say whether of not it is better on tap or in the can. However, I can say it is certainly great from the can."
" This baby pours a very dark brown..almost black, like a porter or stout. Lovely creamy head that laces quite nicely. Smells of roasted malts. Tastes of yummy roasted malts, nuts, a wee bit sweetness like caramel with a bit of bitterness at the end. Personally this beer reminds me more of a scotch ale rather than a brown ale, maybe I'm dumb though. Very tasty and I could definitely sit down to a session of these. I can't wait to try this on tap."
" Lovely stuff"
"Heard lots of positive rumors about the coffee version of this beer, but that has eluded me."
"Pours a nice rich brown hue with a rocky tan head on it that lasts almost through out the whole pint. Smells of roasted malts with some subtle sweetness to it. It tastes of roasted malts, a subtle sweetness, caramel, chocolate and a small hop character in the finish. A medium bodied beer for the most part that has a nice slightly carbonated mouthfeel. Overall a beer with some great malt character with small subtle hints of other great flavors. This beer has a nice complexity to it with suprising character that is very pleasant."
"Wow! This beer has manages to strike the near-perfect balance between originality & tastiness. Very dark color with a tan, pillowy head. Citrusy, toasty aroma. Taste is of toffee & coffee, toasty oats & much more, it seems. A lot going on in there. All the complexity of a porter with a hoppy character worthy of a pale ale. Very satisfying mouthfeel and definitely leaving me wanting another. Though after that 24 oz draw I was feeling it a bit & chose discretion..."
"Surly's offerings are consistently drawing me from my other bar ""standard"" beers. Bender is no exception."
"D- This beer has some nice dark malt flavors but they are supported by lighter malt flavors adding a nice complex taste with a very nice smoothness. Those big malt flavors are well balanced by some big hops flavors with good complexity also."
"A tasty, tasty fresh brown ale with an excellent chocolate aroma and dark brown color. I'm struck by the smoothness of this medium-bodied ale. It drinks very easily, but has enough complexity to be savored as well. The malt flavors suggest darker fruits (figs?) and citric hops blend well with caramel malt sweetness. A roasted coffee flavor surfaces towards the finish which has the right smack of hop bitterness. A very tasty brown ale."
"This beer is somehow light yet, rich, balanced and complex. So easy to drink, you could enjoy it without ever noticing how well made it really is."
"overall this was a great beer that i really enjoyed."
"A brown ale with balls. So much so, I dont even know if its really a brown ale. Dark brown, the color of a porter, with great tan lacing. Slightly roasted and sweet malty aroma. Taste is complex with roasted and chocolate malts, american hops, and maybe even oatmeal. I think I tasted oatmeal. Very smooth beer, kind of thick, but very smooth. Give me another."
"I had not even heard of this company until I had one of these as part of the ""Hometown"" mini tour for Old Chi Town, and I have no idea why. This was an incredable beer. The waitress said it was a brown ale, and I thought she was mistaken when she set it down, it is basically as dark as a porter. It's more than just brown ale, it blends a lot of styles and darker malts, but remains suprisingly refreshing. They add enough hops so that i initally would say this was a porter by taste, but that is one of the great parts of this beer, everyone can find something they like about it. And it's only 5% ABV, so it's good for sitting down to have a few."
"Slightly syrupy consistency. I am usually not a big fan of Brown's. This one is by far my favorite and I would even chose it over other beers I enjoy."
"If this is an indication of where Surly will be going... I'm sold."
"Bender pours a nice ruby-brown color with a creamy, moderate head. The aroma is sweet and caramel and chocolate come to mind. The flavor is full sweet with caramel and malt and subtle notes of chocolate and vanilla. The beer seems to jump back and forth between being a brown and a porter and since that was their intention, I'm cool with that. Mouthfeel is nice, balanced and silky. Very drinkable, if nothing for its complexity. A very nice and very welcomed beer in the Twin Cities. I want more."
"DWords cannot describe how good I feel this beer is.its definitely not like Newcastle as our host indicated. Im not very good at writing reviews to begin with and my review really doesnt do it justice. One of the best beers out therecongrats to Omar and the ""short, taciturn man"" on a job well done!"
"What an introduction to Surly, I loved this beer. Dark body, impressive creamy tan head. Smell is rich and roasty, chocolatey and slightly sweet. Flavor was fantastic. Malty and chocolatey to start, black cofee and strong hops finish this one out very bitter and enjoyable. Enjoyed on-tap at the Triple Rock in Minneapolis. A fantastic place for my first Surly. Great work, keep 'em coming."
"Dark crimson/auburn tone. Creamy nicotine stained tan head. It sticks around for a little while and leaves some sparse and spotty lace. Really great aroma for a brown. Great chocolate malt tones and I get some nice fresh baked bread yeastiness that adds a real nice touch to the aroma. And I notice some hops on the nose as well. The mouthfeel is lightly carbonated. No signs of EtOH. Pretty creamy and smooth overall. Medium-full body. Bready malt base on the buds is layered with a nice roasted malt quality and some citric hops as well. Nice roasted malt bitterness lingers on the aftertaste with a lilttle hop bitterness added to the picture as well. Great flavor. And damn fresh!! I could drink a lot of these in a sitting. And if it were available in bottles, it would be a staple in my fridge at home. Not only is it good by itself, but I would imagine this would pair nicely with a lot of the common foods I tend to eat at home with the family...burgers, steaks, roasts, chops, etc..."
"Here's a brown ale you can drink, and which makes you think. Rather than pass the time in between gulps of a light, uncomplicated sweetish brown brew, it grabs your attention and your palate and makes you wonder a bit about it, and ponder on what makes you like it so much. It's an excellent introductory brew for this upstart, as people can reach for it again and again over a night at the bar,(""another Bender", you say to the barman, and pretty soon you're on one!) and still ponder on it's quality and taste, and come back for more the next night."
"Welcome and Congrats to Surly for standing the test of times of starting a micro brewery in the MN metro. A very nice start. I'm sure, more is to come..."
