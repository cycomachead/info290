It has a unique flavor profile that suggest bourbon barrel aging to me. I know it wasn't (if it was, I'm sure they'd pump that up) but I do wonder if they threw in some barrel chips, or otherwise infused some bourbon flavoring. That would explain the slight sourness and the whiff of boozy brown liquor I caught in the aroma. Just a theory. In any event, I highly recommend this brew.","LCB_Hostage","Aug 30, 2013"

The aroma is where we lost points, as it lacked general robustness and let the malts fall too far to the back in their inherent aromatic contributions. To contrast, the taste showed every side of the grain, with bitterness, bready sweetness, caramels, roast, and earthiness, giving a little something different at each turn, and with each sip. The drying roast on the feel was the icing on the cake, helping to keep that nice flavoring flowing.","TheBrewo","May 10, 2013"

In the aroma, the ale was tart and perhaps even vinegary. It was not the most enticing aroma. The first sip was a dry chocolatey taste with notes of prune and a delightful hint of chocolate covered cherries. The tartness largely overshadows the sweet notes which is appropriate for the style. In the big picture, it combines to demonstrate elements of a sour ale. The aftertaste was dry, which continued the initial impression. The ale left a nice dark chocolate coating on the tonuge, allowed to linger by the modest level of carbonation. This is a very drinkable beer.","JohnnyHopps","May 09, 2012"

For a Brown Ale, it isn’t quite as malty as you might think. It actually features a nice interplay of malt and earthy hops. I like it.

It's nice and safe, not too bitter, not too sweet, not too smelly, not too tasty, not too much of anything; yet it still manages to be pleasant to drink. It has the round non-grapefruity citrus zing of a good UK ale, which I find appealing, but it doesn't have much else.

That brown ale remains rather subtle on the nose, deploying its creamy nuttiness and soft roast whispers over a caramel and thinned out molasses foundation. Warming up, it opens up a bit and develops a mineral fruitiness possibly from its hops, but while slightly flowery, those feel quite tired and tamed down. The beer did taste a little syrupy. Definitely picking up roasted malts, caramel, and brown sugar throughout. Medium bodied and light carbonation which was a little disappointing.

3.9,3.4,4,4,4,3,4,"This pours a dark mahogany with a two finger cream head that leaves traces of lace. On the nose there are roasted and chocolate malts, toffee sweetness, and maybe just a pleasing little bit of husky grain. In the mouth there stand slightly sweet caramel and toffee notes, with the roasted malt fading a bit further in the mix. I'm not getting much in the way of bitterness anywhere here, which combines with a medium thin body to provide very little in the way of a finish. For me, that's really the only knock on this beer. This is something that people who don't know they like beer might like, but has plenty going on for people who do like beer.

It's a decent beer, but it is just not a creamy, roasted, chocolatey and nutty type Brown that I'm interested in.

Overall this was a very nice and smooth borwn ale for sure. Had a very nice flavor with a decent aroma.

It is nutty with some caramel. The chocolate seems to have disappeared. Again there is a little acidity. Bitterness is very low and hops are not detectable. This could be an English Brown with what I can taste. The body feels a little thin but carbonation keeps things positive. Very easy to drink and I guess that was the Brewer's objective. I would like a little more flavor and body but otherwise a good brown.","morimech","Aug 14, 2010"

Not much in the way of hops, but that works here with such a rich aroma. Moderate bitterness with a distinct orange sweetness from the hops. Malt character was basically the same as the aroma and contributed significant malt sweetness in addition to the toasted, chocolate and slight roasted flavours.

3.89,3.2,3.5,4.5,3.5,3,4.5,"Nice color, fairly clear, though a bit of yeast falls in at the finish. It's kind of a reddish brown, not like a brown on the blacker side. With a kind of thin head, about a cm or so, and it looks pretty loose, doesn't leave much lacing. Smells pretty good, like some burnt caramellized sugars, a hint of chocolate in the background, and a very nice clean sweetness in the beer. Nice and grainy I think, this fits the bill of a nice brown ale. Nothing excessive, everything in nice balance. The taste has all the things from the smell, with a tiny bit of sweet coffee thrown in there too. Starts on a nice little roasty, toasty note, comes in a bit grainy, like raw grainy, then it gets a bit sweet, with the nice burnt sugars, and a bit of bread too. All of the flavors kind of blend in nicely in the end, with some good cleanness. I like the taste, but it's not a standout, one of the beers you could drink often, but I doubt if I would crave it. The body is kind of thin I think, with a burst of carbonation at the start, and it disappears quickly. It's quite alright, but nothing too great. The drinkability is probably the best part. Nice and interesting, not a heavy hitter, nice balance, and despite the lighter body, is satisfying and enjoyable. I would reach for another if I didn't have something else to drink.","taylorhamrick","Sep 20, 2009"

Mild wood and nutty flavor with a low level residual bitterness. The silky smooth body feels like it has a lactose element there that lends fullness. Finishes dry and toasty.

The taste is quite complex, too, with vanilla, oak, nuts, caramel -- there's all sorts of stuff going on here -- everything except hops. Overall, a very complex ale that is malt forward without being too sweet; The maltiness is offset by a dry finish.

I would enjoy a sixer of this over the course of a weekend for sure. Another solid beer from Short's.","orbitalr0x","Apr 07, 2009"

4.18,10.9,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"This beer pours a hazy brown color with a nice creamy offwhite head. Smells of roasted malts and brown sugar. Tastes follows the smell with caramel malt and hints of chocolate. The mouthfeel has full body and is nice and smooth. High drinkability and a great session beer. Overall, a fine offering from Short's","johnd513","Mar 28, 2009"

4.27,13.3,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"All-in-all I'd say this is one of the top brown ales that I've had. I'm usually not seeking out this style, but I could make room for this every so often as it's a tasty brew. I'd put this up there with Surly Bender.","dukedevil0","Mar 16, 2009"

4.08,8.2,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"D - Nice flavor, well hidden alcohol, low carbonation - a very sessionable brown ale. I just happen to prefer the hoppiness of Bender...","MasterSki","Mar 16, 2009"

3.77,0,3,3.5,4,3.5,4,"D - I would not be able to drink a ton of these in a sitting as it is not my favorite style. However, for those that do enjoy a good brown ale I am sure that it would be an instant classic.","ROBORB","Mar 08, 2009"
3.76,-0.3,4,3,4,4,4,"D- An enjoyable brown. It doesn't have any of those annoying flavors that I often seem to find in this style. I will be getting this again.","david131","Mar 06, 2009"

4.28,13.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,5,"Good dose of toasted grains and spicy hops up front. Cookie dough and caramel sweetness follow. Earthy licorice and spicy hop bitterness into the finish. Doughy malts linger. Pretty damn good! Medium body with good carbonation levels. A very nice sessionable American brown ale. Oh, and congratulations to the Short's gang for getting bottles out! I will definitely be buying more of this.","alexgash","Jun 29, 2008"

4.88,29.4,5,4.5,5,5,5,"This is one of my classic favorites from Joe. Rich malty american brown style with a bit of a larger body than you might expect. Great hop bite with a wonderful balance. Poured a nice dark malty body. Beautiful head and a nice lacing. This is one of those beers that I could enjoy any time!! If you haven't had the chance, search out this or any of the Shorts beers and try them!!","LupulinDevil","Jul 09, 2006"
4.82,27.9,4.5,5,5,4.5,4.5,"This pours a dark brown color that initially put me off as I usually do not like darker beers. However this beer was amazingly easy to drink and appreciate. I rate this as the best brown available. It has subtle hops and almost a faint nut quality. My mother in law (who is not a beer drinker loves this also). I will still go for the pale ales but this is in the rotation.","Baileyuk","Beers"
