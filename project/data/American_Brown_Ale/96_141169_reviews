"This was a decent beer. Probably not something I would buy again, but worth trying once."
""
"Hoppy. A decent brown. Fits the bill for a brown ale, but not a stand-out."
""
""
"Was not a fan. I didn't like the hop selection in this beer."
""
"Really just a weak mess. More dry than hoppy. Overly thin. Boring, borderline off festive taste."

"Poured from a bottle into a craft beer glass.  It had a hazy brown color that was clear on the bottom half that had a very small head that didn't leave lacing.  It smells of pine and hops with a light nuttiness.  There was a slightly sweet nutty taste up front, with sharp pine taking over in the middle before ending with a slightly bitter hop flavor.  It was certainly a hoppy brown ale as advertised, but it was slightly unbalanced and could've used more nuttiness to balance out the hops.  Medium-light body with moderate carbonation.  It had a pleasant mouthfeel despite the bitter hops aftertaste.  Overall, it is a well hopped brown ale that left room for improvement.  I'm glad I tried it but I didn't like it enough to buy it again."

"Ten years ago, I considered Magic Hat a quality craft beer brewer. Today, I consider their brews light weight and boring. I do think that some of their stouts and porters are OK, and some of their limited edition brews worth tasting. This brown ale is OK, but nothing more. I would drink again if another bottle was offered again, but wouldn't buy."

"Really ""empty"" taste IMO. Felt heavily carbonated with not much flavor to accompany it. Unlikely I'll try it again."
""
"Clear brown pour with lasting, clingy off-white foam - looks great! Aroma of some esters and malt, with some floral notes, but not much hop in the nose. Taste is biscuit and malty. Pretty good, but not on the level of Dogfish IBA."
""
"A decent enough brown ale. A ""hoppy brown ale"" as the bottle says, pretty balanced and drinkable. Serve at 50 degrees."
"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 11/13/2014. Pours slightly hazy light reddish brown color with a 1-2 finger dense and rocky light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, light chocolate, light nuttiness, light citrus/pine, herbal, grass, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, nuttiness, light chocolate, pine, herbal, grass, light citrus, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Good amount of herbal/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, nuttiness, light chocolate, pine, and herbal/toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance, robustness, and complexity of dark/bready malt and earthy hop flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, moderately sticky, and lightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice hoppy brown ale. All around good complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and fairly crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"Pours with a small, light brown head. Has a clean copper color. Has an aroma of a stereotypical brown ale. Tastes like a brown ale with the usual caramel finish except it has a stronger hop taste than others. Overall, an above average beer."

"Nice brown ale, good flavor, easy drinker"

"The puns...why can't they be any good?  Anyway, this stuff pours a clear garnet-sienna topped by a finger of glowing dirty cream foam.  The nose comprises dry maple syrup, mild caramel, mixed greens, a hint of pine, and a twinge of vague nuttiness.  The taste leads with some meek caramel and biscuit, then goes into a wave of greens, grass, and mild pine, and then ends with a soft touch of walnut.  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel.  Overall, this one didn't quite do it for me.  The greens overpower most of the malts, and those greens don't have that much character in and of themselves.  Pass."
"a very nice product.  A good brown ale, with a nice balance of malts and a bit of hop bite.    I do not like MAgic Hat # 9, but this, and their ""Heart of Darkness"" are fine products (much above average)."

"Not too bad for a mixed case. It almost accomplishes its name but def on the malty caramelly side. Would have liked a little more hops or a hoppy bite on the end but it remained on the sweet. Easy drinking. Worth a try, but there are better hoppy browns available."
""
""
""
"Overall, well it's not too bad at least, just not very good, as the hops and malts have no chance at balance, the malts would have been nice had the hops not just smashed it like a bug on a windshield. The hops are fairly boring as well, generic boring IPA like hops. If they were in a nice balance the choice of hops might have been a bit more tolerable."
""
""
"O: An interesting choice of hops (earthy and grassy) for a hoppy brown ale. Enjoyable but not sure that I would want to have more than one of these in a session."
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A nice brown ale, but the finish is too hoppy for the beer.  Happy I tried it, but don't see myself buying this again."
""
""
"Overall: A solid brown ale that is good for the winter. Would have it again"
""
""
"Overall, it is not a bad beer.  I can get better."
""
""
""
"The Rest: Not a bad beer.  I don't usually care for Magic Hat much, but this isn't too bad.  A nice twist on a Brown ale."
""
""
"Typical Magic Hat kinda offering, not terrible, but nothing to get overly excited about...Meh..sort of sums it up"
""
"Just generally weak. Not much color, not much aroma, and not much flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice caramel spice aroma when poured into glass.  Finish slightly but not overly bitter.  Good balance."
"Did not find this appealing"
"O- not bad but not good....i would say a tick above average but could be better."
"It's decent, a little bitter, but ok. Not outstanding, but competent enough"
""
""
""
"O: [2.50] Lackluster taste across the palate and the nose.  Just nothing exciting or noteworthy. I wouldn't drink this one again.  Not bad just not good either."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Eh, it's okay. The hoppy finish keeps this brew from being a terribly bland drink. Got a heck of a deal at Costco so there's no room to complain. I'll gladly drink the rest and move on from there."

"It's an alright beer. Nothing crazy good."

"There is some malty taste and some hoppiness.  Not on of my favorite brown ales."

"Remind me of Texas Light. Not a good memory..."
"Pours dark amber color with a finger width foamy head.  Head retention is mild.  Lacing is decent.  Has a nutty, slightly piney aroma.  Mild citrus and chocolate.  Bready, slightly citric taste.  There is a mild piney hop at the end with a very mild chocolate taste.  Does last long.  Moderately soapy/bitter aftertaste.  Not really a bad beer.  Pleasantly surprised given the type of beer."
""
""
""
"O: the acrid bitterness sticks to your mouth and it's an unpleasant reminder of what is otherwise a nice brown ale;"
""
"Very nice offering for the winter.  Toasty malts, nice bitter hops.  Not sweet like most brown ales, it has an almost porter-like feel.  I will pick up another 6, for sure."
"This beer has the nuttiness that you would expect from a brown ale, but has a pleasant level of hopps that far exceeds the typical brown. This is a great beer for a mild winter day."
""
"12/26...translucent light brown, patchy white foam atop, some lacing. Caramel malts, toffee, breads in the nose. Smooth nutty caramel taste with a layered bitter that emerges halfway through and rides to the finish. Bitterer as it goes. Nice way to balance a sweet nut brown."
""
""
""
"A decent enough brown ale. Not a ""hoppy brown ale"" in my eyes as the bottle says, but pretty balanced and drinkable."
"Very taste beer when I see this I normally grab a 6 pack"
""
""
"Decent. There are much better similar beers, but I gotta try anything new that comes my way."

"Clear mahogany brown. Light khaki head. Creamy, but short lived. Better than average lacing. Aroma is nutty/chocolatey with grassy hops - not particularly bright, just average 'brown ale'. Caramelish, nutty, and lightly milk-chocolate in the flavor. Herbal, floral and subtly piney hops 'spruce it up' a bit. Solidly bitter. Dry finish. Remains an average 'brown ale' with a few extra hops thrown in, but balanced and drinkable."
"Overall this lives up to its name of a ""Hoppy Brown Ale"".  There are more hops than are usual for a Brown Ale; it can also serve as a Winter Warmer."

"Crystal clear amber/brown color with a smallish off white head that dissipates slowly. Caramel malt earthy pine hop light fruit, cardboard and toffee with a touch of alcohol. Middle of the road. Nothing horrible and nothing exciting."
""
"Was hoping that it wasn't soooo hoppy. Had to pour out more than half a glass."
"Very good similar to Jackie-o Brown ale but cheaper and in a bottle!"
""
""
""
""
""

"Not bad.  Looks darker than it tastes.  Nice winter warmer.  Could drink a bunch of them on a cold day watching football or hockey."
""
""
""
"The taste has a good malt body with toasted caramel flavor mixed with woody and light citrus hop taste and slight dark toastiness in the malt as it warms with hint of spice and alcohol in the taste as it finishes. An okay brown ale, more or less but not exactly inspired -a run of the mill American style brown."

"Brown Ale. Pours a nice reddish brown but little head. No noticible hop aroma for a beer that advertises as a hoppy beer. Taste damk bitterness but no citrus notes. Some staleness. Light mouthfeel. Overall a little disappointing."

"im glad hoppy brown ales are making a comeback, they are the perfect fall beer, and this one tastes pretty good. its a little generic on the hop front, but the balance between the chocolate malt and the bittering is well done, and there is a definite warming quality to a couple of these. one thing I might change is the body, its real thin I think for the season and the style, and even light for the bold flavor profile of the beer. its also a bit under carbonated, which never happens with magic hat but is not nice in this particular beer. a get a neat toasted coconut flavor to the grain, and then the hops, it almost has a tropical element to it that way. this is a style I want to see more of, but a beer that's unique but far from perfect. a few tweaks for next year and this one will be money. I think the abv is right on too for the style and the season."

"Snow Roller brewed by Magic Hat Brewing Company, with an ABV 6.20%  This brew pours out a light brown color with a small white head. Snow Roller is a filtered brew you can see right though it. The smell rich with sweetness and grains. Now for the taste , it is bitter at first with a clean finish. Snow Roller has a nice balance to it, there is nothing overpowering in this brew.  Even the bitterness is nice in this brew. The mouthfeel is bold at first but snow roller has a clean finish. Overall I'm giving this brew a 4 out of 5.  Magic Hat Brewing Company, did a nice job with this brew.  I would buy this brew again."

"Incredible beer that is available nearly everywhere. Has a hop presence like a Torpedo (well maybe not that much), but with the addition of a roasted flavor. I think they work really well together. Smooth mouth feel. One of Magic Hat's best."

"Mahogany brown colored with good clarity and a quarter inch of khaki colored head.  Brussels lacing.  I get a light scent of chocolate malt when I really struggle to detect it.  The dark malt with chocolate notes presents itself more boldly in the flavor.  There's also the twist of having some grapefruit like hoppiness in the mix.  I'm not sure this flavor pairing is working.  The mouth is moderately carbonated."

"O: This is basically a brown APA.  Like many of its big brother black IPA relatives, has hops that don't mesh as well with  the malts as can be hoped.  Initially served at about 40F, this did improve, becoming more malt-forward, with some warming."
""
""
""
"It claims ""hoppy"" and it is about the same as most American brown ales, I would say (more than than traditional ""English""). That being said, it does have a firm malt backing.  As a whole, I didn't find it to be particularly special, but it is a solid, enjoyable American brown ale."
""
""
""
"Overall, the variety pack made it worth it for a beer I could try without investing in it, albeit drinkable this is nothing I will look for again!"

"Too hoppy for my tastes, mostly overpowering the 'brown' in this 'hoppy brown ale.'"
"O: A nice malty brown with a decent amount of hoppiness to keep things interesting. Easy to drink, with the alcohol providing just enough warmth for those colder days. Solid"

"Very well balanced hopiness with the brown ale flavors. This beer has something for ipa and ale lovers alike. Leaves you with a nice warming sensation with every sip. I'm on my 4th 6 pack and can't get enough!  Don't generally drink Magic Hat but they've really got a hit here!"

"  Overall I'll give a 4 for Snow Roller - Magic Hat Brewing Company"
