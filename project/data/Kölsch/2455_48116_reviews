"The Crack! was as loud as a CANnon and the CAN was as full as the trenches in early-1915. The inverted Glug was precise in its deployment and quickly netted me two fingers of foamy, fizzy, bone-white head that began to collapse under the exertion, leaving Belgian lacing in its wake. Color was Straw-Yellow (SRM = 3.9, a preciseness measured by the brewery), as yellow as the cowards who retreated In the face of the enemy, and with NE-plus quality clarity, allowing me to peer into a grim future. Nose was what I tend to think of with regard to the style – slightly honey-like, slightly grassy. If we still rated on Smell, I would characterize this as “Perfect”. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium. The taste was grassy and honey-like, sort of a Gateway between a light lager and a German Pilsner. I have to disagree with them as to “… a sweet finish” because I would characterize it as “Dry”. The CAN mentions “O.G. 11.5 P and IBU 32.3”, so I think that an argument CAN be made for my point of view. A very nice, light drinking beer on a Summer’s day."
"O: Great brew. Well done Kolsch. Got this one in Asheville, drank in Chicago, IL with some deep dish pizza, great combo."

"Poured from a can into a shaker pint, the beer is a hazy, straw gold coloring, with a fluffy, tall, clingy, white head. Steady carbonation action throughout the body, too. Nose of toasted grains, subtle floral notes, and hints of berry esthers. Flavors are tangy forward, with buttered toast notes, and a subtle hops bitterness. Smooth and light, with a frothy, effervesced finish. Tangy, grainy aftertaste. Not bad."

"A very easy to drink brew that would be enjoyable on a hot day. I am just fine drinking it after a long day to decompress. Good example of the style."

"O: Very easy to drink, very refreshing, and tasty - I could see myself picking this up a lot more frequently once the weather gets warms (great beer for when I am out on the porch manning the grill)."

"O: This beer is easy to drink and has some refreshing properties. It makes for a good beer to drink outside on a hot summer day."

"Taste follows pretty closely. It's fairly honey sweet, full of grain and wheat, and a very small bitterness at the backend. This is a pretty straightforward beer here. A bit surprised at the lack of citrus character. Nothing complicated, but it goes down quite easily. Would probably make a great summer beer."
"6.2/10"

"Overall a tasty easy drinking kolsch."
""
"Thin head that doesnt last long on a near crystal clear bright golden body. The aroma is very light with barely perceptable pale malts, sweet corn and honey. Flavor has a nice amount of honey flavor with barely, wheat and herbal flavors. Nice body for the style with moderate to high carbonation. Certainly drinkable with nice degree of sweetness and flavor for a style that can be fairly bland."
""
""
"Overall: I love kolsch but is one isn't as well crafted and flavorful as some of the better examples of the style. Not a bad beer, but kolsch fans can do better."

"O: Quite a nice beer. It's very drinkable and easy to drink. I enjoyed it quite a bit. Brought the bottle back from a trip out to North Carolina and was not disappointed. I have just started getting into the Kolsh beers and this is a nice, easy drinking one for a hot, summer Kansas afternoon."

"This is a very light, easy to drink, refreshing beer. It doesn't have much flavor, but it's to style and ultimately enjoyable."
""
""
"O: Good light Kolsch. I'm not too familiar with this style, but enjoyable. I found it less sessionable than others though, simply because the aftertaste hung around so long."

"Overall a very good beer from a style that should be fairly mild and bland. This is something you could drink a ton of either by itself or with food."
"O: I think the name of this beer might have captured it, its a gateway Kolsch. I think this might be a good one for me to try to get into the style. It is certainly not my favorite beer I've ever had, and I doubt this will be the favorite of this style, but its something you could drink a lot of, and not ask too many questions about it."
"It's not super complex but it's extremely drinkable and definitely quite tasty. I definitely like this beer. It would make a great fishin' beer, does it come in cans?"
"Smells a little like a white wine, maybe some grapes. Pours a pale yellow with a very thin head that dissapates quickly. Tastes like a bubbly wine, very heavy taste on the grapes, with a good level of carbonation. Fairly dry but very drinkable. I drank the entire bomber. Without an issue. I would say this is a very sessionable beer. That is easy to drink and doesnt kill the pallet. This would be good for a wine drinker, as a craft option."
"o - overall this is a style i haven't explored much but this was way different than i had expected. the nose was the highlight and i wish that the rest of the beer lived up to that promise, but all-in-all a decent beer and one that i'm glad i finally opened. thanks mike!"
"Nicely done!!!"
"O: Despite not being terribly ""kolsch-like", I thought this was a pretty decent beer."
"O- Decent per style. As said before, its a little forgettable. I have had a better Kolsch, but I've also had a worse. Would buy again (as this was a pint special) on a hot day, but would look over the tap list quite a bit first."
"On tap in Asheville. A clear gold with a thin ring of white foam. Smell: white grape juice, mildy musty grain, mild spicy hopping. Taste: grain twang, a little vinous, cracker, slightly spicy lemon and mild herbal hopping. Most don't do this style well but this was a good one."
"D: A good beer to have a few of - although not too exciting; went well with wings!"
"Gateway Kolsch is quite solid overall. If we're talking Kolsches from the Carolinas, I'd take COAST's 32/50 any day; however, Gateway is pretty close. A few tweaks on the flavor profile & it's there. Worth a shot."
"Overall impression: A refreshing and lively Kolsch. Recommended."
"It had nice yellow color and white head to the body. There was average lacing. The aroma was grassy and had a good aroma of hops. The taste was a little hoppier than this style usually is but it was good. I thought the use of hops was proportioned and done well. There was a grainy and grassy flavor with a small hint of fruitiness. The mouthfeel was thin and light."
"D: This beer isn't horrible or undrinkable, but it isn't particularly memorable."
"Probably had this at the wrong time of year for me. Could be very pleasant while out on the back porch during the spring and summer."
"Nicely drinkable, not nearly as delicate as you'd expect a Kolsch to be. An American take, perhaps, decent amount of flavor but lacking in subtlety."
"The appearance is pretty good for the style, perhaps a little bit too golden but overall great. Taste was spot on for a Kolsch and mouthfeel paired with drinkability was great. Definately a mellow session beer! I'd buy it here or there if I could get it in my area. It is not 100% to style IMO and there are definately better domestic examples of this style, I still believe it deserves it's rank in the top domestic Kolsch category."
"An OK brew. Would work well with a nice piece of lemon grilled whitefish. Not the best choice in the style. IF you like kolsch give it a try, otherwise, look for something else."
"Light mouthfeel, thin & refreshing with a good amount of carbonation. Very easy to drink on a hot summer's day"
"Overall a superb session offering from them, I could have seriously gone on with this one for days. Really just a good example of the style and really nicely done"
"Overall this is a solid beer for the style, very clean and crisp. Worth a shot."
"A golden colored pour with a thin white head. Smells nice, flowery noble hops clearly dominating. Tastes a lot like those same hops and with a faint sweetness of pale malts. I like it a lot, and would buy it again, but I feel like it was meant to be drank on tap. So I might hold out for that as opposed to grabbing another bomber when I'm in town."
"D - This is a nice, drinkable and smooth kolsch. There is nothing complex here, but that is just right for the style. A nice, simple session beer."
"22 oz. bottle. Pours a clear and effervescent light golden color with a nice sized, frothy white head, good lacing. Aroma is pale malts, wheat, light citrus, grain, and grass. Flavor is sweet grain, bread, yeast, and a light hoppy finish. Mouthfeel is dry, bitter, and light. Not a whole lot of flavor here, but a very crisp and drinkable beer."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The body of the beer is light. The carbonation levels work well with the beer. This is an excellent flavorful beer. Many people may like this beer on a hot day. I am thinking this beer would be good on any day of the week. Thanks again Ding!"
"D - Great lawnmower beer. I could see drinking this on a hot summer day. Goes down easy."
"Drinkability: Aside from the mouthfeel, this is a very nice example of the style as it is well-balanced and flavorful"
"D - Easy enough to drink, just doesn't keep my interest."
"D: You know, I can see why they named this Gateway. This would be an easy beer to get a BMC drinker hooked on. It has that BMC look as far as color, but has just enough more in the flavor department to show you beer can have bigger flavors but not crazy enough to scare newbs away. Big carbonation makes this easy drinking and that foamy and carbonated look is really cool. Good warm weather beer that quenches, what else do you people want?"
"Drinking this in the mountains around Asheville. Would taste just as good at the beach."
"Drinkability: very drinkable - very sessionable. I love this kolsch - will recommend this to friends - I wish we got this in Charleston - great for the weather."
"The beer is light, smooth and easy to drink. The beer did have very good and very prevalent carbonation, and this was not a determent to the beer. The beer left a dry aftertaste, which I had expected, but it was somewhat unappealing. Overall, this may be a decent summer beer, but it reminds me of Blue Moon and not a Kolsch, especially after my first was Reissdorf Kölsch."
"Very nice. If French Broad can make a kolsch this appealing, I'm looking forward to the other three bombers resting in the basement."
"What a perfect after work beer to be had here in my mind mind.Poured into a standard pint glass a slight hazed light golden, like sunshine basically,with a thin wispy white head.Aromas of toasted grain with some fruity esters,crisp mouthfeel and flavors,quite toasty with a bit of honey-like sweetness and shot of sharp zing in the finish.A highly quaffable pleasent drinking kolsch,again a perfect after work or hot day brew with real flavor."
"Happy to see this brewery in Atlanta now. I like their focus on some underappreciated styles, and the fact that they make quite a few low alcohol beers. This beer is a case in point. Wonderfully refreshing and very nicely balanced with a nice crisp bitterness and some soft grassiness. Really very close to what it should be for the style with a pilsner bitterness and crispness but kolsch softness overall. Pours a very pale yellow with little head, but the proof is in the drinkability. Very nice."
"Drinkability: Easy-drinking and keenly refreshing -- just what I want from a Kölsch."
"French Broad's tasty new formulation of their Kolsch is light-medium in body, perfectly carbonated and highly quaffable."
