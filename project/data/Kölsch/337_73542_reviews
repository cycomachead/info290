"yuck. first bad beer I've had from this brewery. possibly just a bad luck of the draw"
""
""
""
"Pours a very dark amber color, with a light tan head. Theres a faint roasted malt smell. Tastes very similar to the lawnmower but with some roasted malt flavors. overall a good beer"
""
""
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a pretty amber color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of floral hops. Taste is a bit different for the style. Malts, bready, nutty, some hops are present. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is an enjoyable beer."
"A dark Kolch that didn't interest me. Not much there in terms of flavor"
""
""
"Love the flavor, great taste"

"Very Good Black Kolch,  wish it was stronger"

"Overall, I had one and enjoyed it. I went to put my score in and saw that this was not rated all that well. Went with an IPA next than came back for anther Santo to try confirm if I was off or the rating was. I really enjoyed the second as much as the first. Not sure why this beer gets a bad rap but I would surely buy it again if I see it on tap or in a store. Definitely recommend trying and keeping your mind open and not let the low scores sour your opinion."

"This is what you'd call a lawnmower beer. A beach beer. BBQ beer. Wherever you need a light go-to, this qualifies. I'd prefer a can though."

"It's a good beer."
"Overall: a decent malty medium body lager"

"Draught @ Fat Grass: This one pours a clear, dark caramel color. There was a wisp of an off-white head on it that left no lacing. The aroma is a touch light but good. Light roastiness and chocolate, maybe some earthiness and toffee. The taste is good. A touch of malt sweetness. Some roasted malts, chocolate and graininess. Perhaps a touch of smokiness and a slightly dry finish. Nice."
""
""
""
"Overall a pretty good brew."

"a black kolsch? some may say they were just too lazy to lager this thing, not that it really would have helped a whole lot in my opinion. watery see through brown in color, short lived half inch of tan suds. smells loosely like roasted barley, but not enough of it, its thin and transparent aromatically. faint cocoa notes too, but they seem watered down as well. no hops to speak of. the flavor is a lot like the nose, but the absence of enough malt is more apparent. supposed to be a bold and roasty brew, it lacks that depth. it also lacks enough body to really work in this colder weather. perhaps better in a summer context when a bit of a darker beer is sought, but a light body is still in season. as it stands today, this beer really missed the mark for me, and now after a handful of beers saint Arnold is still yet to really make much of an impression on me."
""
"Tastes like a Brown Ale, not a Kölsch. Lots toasted malt. Sweet with some spritz. Full bodied. Short aftertaste. Overall, it's a run of the mill Brown Ale taste wise."
"A very good, roasted grain ale that really emphasizes the malts. The hop presence is pretty subdued, especially with bitterness, yet the lightly charred character of the malt sugars hold their own and make the beer a winner."
""
""
"Overall, a rather disappointing beer, due to the aroma, taste and mouthfeel, which is surprising coming from a Saint Arnold product."
""
""
"D really not what I was hoping for, disappointing."
"A malt focused beer, with just a touch of fruitiness from the yeast character. Simple, easy drinking for when you want a roast accented beer. Not bad and even enjoyable, but not all that interesting for me."

"Atmosphere is pretty good. Dark hue, thick bubbly head, and some nice lacing. Nose is roasty, with sweet and nutty components. Lightly roasted malt, nuts, and sweetness. All components lightly applied. Overall, this is a good quaff."

"Medium mouthfeel."
"a fantastic break from the hop-bomb craze. i hope SA keeps making this year-round ... a perfect option when i want a lighter malt malt-bomb."
"Pours very dark amber color - cloudy and almost brown really. A brown finger width foamy head that quickly dissipates. There is a small amount of lacing that quickly recedes after swirling. It does not persist on the glass. There is a sour, bready and almost fruity aroma. Almost roasted malty taste up front with a very slight bitterness, followed by a very mild sweetness at the end. As a ""black kolsch", it is definitely a unique beer. I have had it before and will most likely drink it if available again. It is one of my wife's favorite beers, otherwise, I probably wouldn't stock it in the fridge that often."

"A great black lager. Very full taste, hearty without a strong bite. Slight roasty flavor, yet surprisingly smooth and easy to drink. A great beer to have with chips and guacamole, or while barbequing steaks out back. I will buy this again to enjoy on a Friday or Saturday night."

"It was on the watery side and not really easy to put down especially with the meager 4.7 abv it puts out. Its in the moderate sipper category for me and I didn't even bother finishing it. If it had more carbonation, maybe some crispness or a more characteristic finish I would have probably enjoyed it more but its just one of those beers that in a hit or miss game, is a miss. Sip after sip I was hoping it was going to get better as it warmed up but I was really disappointed."
""
""
""
"This is a very interesting beer that is easy drinking and enjoyable."
""
"O- This beer is not bad, but far from great also. I could see having several of these in a sitting with a meal, however this is not a full flavored beer, or something I would highly recommend to the beer connoisseur. A good start though for someone who is used to the typical big brewery beers and looking to try something new."

"Big thanks goes out to one of my co-workers for bringing me this one to tick! Served from bottle into a Mother Earth strange. Poured a deep ruby red dark brown with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wheat, spice, grain, dark chocolate, and toasted malt. The flavor was of sweet malt, dark chocolate, milk chocolate, wheat, grain, toasted malt, and cream. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a fairly good brew. I honestly went into this one not expecting very much. What I found was actually quite nice and well balanced. There was a nice roastiness/toastiness going on in this one that really added a nice touch to this brew and was definitely different for the style. This was a welcomed change in the way that they executed it. Really glad I got the chance to try this one and suggest you do the same if you get the opportunity!"

"Being in Houston, this beer is easy to find even in those establishments that just tend to serve the big, bad, American beers. I'll take a Santo over those any day."
""

"Poured into a pint glass. Pours clear dark brown with a biege head that dissipates moderately fast. The appearance of this beer is almost like a dunkel. There are plentiful tiny bubbles in the beer. There are hints of chocolate and coffee with the dark roasted malt. The aromas are pretty subtle. The taste follows the nose. The beer is chocolately and a the malt profile really comes across like a good dunkel. The hop bitterness is low to non-existant. The body is light with moderate carbonation. The finish is clean and the drinkability is high. This beer drinks like a dunkel, but is labeled a Kölsch. This is a very good beer, but ultimately loses some points for being something it shouldn't."
"Perhaps this beer in its age lost some of the delicacies of the Kölsch and gained a toasted malt profile? /s"

"O - Not a huge fan of the Kolsch style itself so went in trying to be objective, but really enjoyed it as a beer itself and possibly my favorite among the style that I have tried. Well done Saint Arnolds and thanks again Neemesh for sending some my way!"
""
""
""
""
""

"Wouldn't consider this a traditional Kölsch, more of a Maerzen or ESB in character, though they do use a Kölsch yeast. American-Style Dark Lager is the category it won bronze in the World Beer Cup."

"I don’t recommend this beer; I declare it a mandatory beer. A recommendation is just not good enough. Any serious hop head should absolutely consider it mandatory to taste this wonderfully crafted beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a good, highly sessionable beer. Similar in body to saint arnolds lawnmower beer but with a deeper flavor profile. Too bad it's not available in Colorado, another reason for me to take more trips to Texas."

"deep dark brown body with a three finger head that unfortunatly settled rather quickly. smell and taste mirror one another. pick up on grassy earth tones at first with some biscuit and cracker and roasted grains. some toffee, caramel and chocolate are also noticable. there is almost a smoke quality on the finish that is not expected. a thin mouthfeel but easy drinkin. i like it. thanks again UHCougar12!"
""
"D ~ Would gladly drink again. I like Saint Arnold A LOT! Great American expressions of German styles. This is not a traditional Koelsch by any means, but it's still pretty tasty. Thanks brad!"

"Presentation: Packaged in a short twelve-ounce brown glass bottle with a twist-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"I'd call it a schwarz myself. In any case, it's pretty drinkable. The low strength makes for a nice session beer as well."
""
"Well at least the bottle looks pretty cool. Anyways poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass, bottled on 12/21/11. This pours a dark brown with a short lived lace leaving off white head. The smells have a biscuit hint along with mild hops but a little mild, a little dark malts. The feel is medium to light. The taste is light also, some biscuit malts, a little coco a hint of hop bite, okay but not great."

"O- Fairly average beer. I'm not a fan of smoky-flavoured beers so this one wasn't for me."
""

""

"Would Ron endorse? Discuss. Meanwhile, this stuff pours a clear garnet topped by a finger of off-cream-white foam. The nose comprises toasted caramel, light chocolate powder, and lighter orange peel. The taste, being insanely conformist and uninteresting, brings in more of the same. Straight up. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, an okay beer, but nothing I would ever consider a kolsch. I'm thinking this must be miscategorized or something. Either way, it's alright, but nothing close to special or memorable."
"This is a dark kolsh? I gave it a vigorous pour and got a good couple of fingers of foam. It’s a dark ruby-cola color in the glass. Slight biscuity aroma, but very light. Tastes of light roast and some honeyed sweetness rounding it out. To be honest I haven’t heard anyone speak highly of this so I’m going to stick my neck out and say it: for what it is, it ain’t half bad."
"This beer is somewhat unique in texture and flavor. It's a very good beer for a hot day when you want something light but with more flavor than a light pilsner or koelsch. Otherwise, it's not outstanding."
""

"O: I wouldn't say I'm dissapointed by any means, however there are much better examples of the style out there. This is a great average beer for an average (not to over the top) beer drinker. This would be good for intro. to people who are new to the hobby. About what I expected from saint arnold."
""
""
"O: It's an OK beer. It isn't big enough in any direction to really define its style. I did enjoy the mouthfeel and clean finish."
""
""
""
""
""
"I took notes on my phone so I'm not writing this as I drink it."
""
""
""
"Looks like a pretty root beer without the head. Smells like not-much-to-right-home-about. Some sweetness on the sniffer, but it's a hunting expedition in the Amazon to find it. Bubbly on the tongue, more so than I expected due to the lack of foamy head. It doesn't taste like much at all. It's soooo subtle with a bit of toasted Grape Nuts in the finish. Hops weren't invented when this beer was brewed. That's the only reason I can think of for there not being any. A black lager/Kolsch (I guess) that needs more flava-flave."
""
""
"o - eh... glad i tried, wouldn't necessarily seek out again though.. i like S.A. other brews I've been lucky enough to have...maybe kolsch not my style..."
""
"Thanks to texasfan549, pours deep black with a 2"" white head, nice lacing. The aroma has roasted notes, chocolate notes. The first sip has nice roasted and chocolate notes, then it faded a bit. It finishes light. The body is too thin, good carbonation. Black kolsch, maybe not the best idea. Not sure this is the proper style."
""
"Overall: Really boring and I'm not sure the style is correct. Not again."
""
""
""
"O - I was hoping for something better. It can be interesting in a way but overall it's a 'meh' kind of beer."
"Overall, an interesting diversion from the normal. Very drinkable and safe, but also different."
""
""
""
""
""
"I don't know if I'd order this beer again. It's hard to say if it's a good representation, because it's not a typical kolsch I thought it would be."
""
"Crisp, black, malty and clean taste. Mild chalky bitterness lingering. No oil or fruit present. This was kind of a mystery beer to me because of the cool art on the label (also, bottlecap is nice design too) and the lack of any description of the brew. As I understand it's a ""black kolsch."" Seems to fit Texas to a ""T."" Burnt roast mild coffee-like flavor with refreshing light brew. Kind of a nice mix."
"Opinion: Overall this is a pretty decent beer. It has enough character that it sets itself apart a bit in the craft-beer market so that it might lead a Lawnmower drinker to try different beers. That said, the beer lacks the complexity that I would like to put it in the outstanding category. Even a black Koelsch should showcase some of the fruity aspects of the yeast while still having good head retention and more of a sweet aspect to the dark malts, so maybe this would have just necessitated taking out the very dark malts for some dark crystal and fermenting it a tad warmer. This may have brought it a little closer in, but regardless, it is a pretty good attempt at something that doesn't exist."
"This did not really excite me. Besides some toasted and burnt grains, just kind of ho hum and average."
"Overall: I'm glad I was allowed to taste this beer before I decided to invest in a 6 pack. I did not like it and to this day have only actually enjoyed a few St. Arnolds beers."
"O - Another mediocre Saint Arnold beer. Just an average unremarkable beer. Not bad, but not worthy of a second purchase."
"O: Nothing memorable about this beer. Easy drinking though."
"This is an average beer. I was expecting a little more dark malt character. If you are a lawnmower fan, then you will enjoy this. Otherwise, if you are looking for something more complex, look elsewhere."
"O: I was pretty disappointed with this beer. Saint Arnold makes good beers, but this is by far the worst one by them I have had."
"Overall-Only had one, but could definitely drink plenty of these. Glad this beer is in the rotation. Very drinkable."
"Poured from bottle into DFH snifter. Pours a murky brown/black color, reminiscent of brown tea as it leaves the bottle. Dark in color as it gets into the glass, but light gets through. Smell- roasted malt, tea leaves, a little bit of coffee and mocha. reminds me of a dobblebock in appearance and smell. Taste- tea leaves, a faint bitterness, maybe some coffee flavors again. Overall, not much here. A little bland and boring. Really rich carbonation here too. A realize that they are trying to make a session beer here, but I don't see ever making a session out of this. A little blah on this beer."
"This is a completely average dark beer with the plus that the flavor doesn't linger very long. It's not mind blowing but I'm not sure it was really trying to be either. A very drinkable beer from Brock at SA."
"The beer pours a dark brown color with an off-white head. The aroma is a mix of toffee and toasted malt, with some earthy hops. There is also a little bit of chocolate in the aroma. The flavor is somewhat strange. I get some toffee and roasted malt, but there is also some earthy and grass notes. The finish is pretty clean like you would expect from a kolsch, but other than that this tastes more like a standard dunkel lager or something similar. Thin mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"It's a decent beer but I think's there's some better options for a highly drinkable beer with dark beer tastes such as Full Sail Sessions Black."
