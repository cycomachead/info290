4,5.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Kölsch is quickly become my favorite summer drink. This beer was very light and refreshing. Nice an bready and not too hoppy. Great beer, not much to say. I will definitely get it again, the brewery is so close to me.","Northsider","Jul 29, 2011"
3.23,-14.8,3,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Crank it up Gees!!! Trying the Krankshaft Kolsch...the appearance is ok....very yellow with no head, clear. The smell is mostly grain with some hints of citrus. The taste is powered by grain that is somewhat burnt. There are some hints of citrus, but this beer is really not to my liking. Mouthfeel...its light and somewhat easy drinking. but not one that I would choose unless the alternative was a typical American Adjuct from macro breweries. Worht a try sure....worth a revisit....i dont know.","WoodBrew","Jul 23, 2011"

I'm glad I looked past the price tag on these beers to find that they are so spot on for the styles - and so fresh that they will give anyone the true character of German style beers. Don't know what Aasher was drinking, but I'm guessing it may have been the first pour of the day and he should have requested a fresh glass.","steveh","Apr 25, 2011"
4.11,8.4,3,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Had on tap at Hay market, a fantastic brew pub in Chicago everyone should visit when given the chance. This beer came out with a thin head and clear gold body but what really grabbed my interest was the smell; very floral and alluring. The taste was amazingly clean and smooth but not wimpy, strong tones of wheat and a zest of lemon followed each swig. Didn't expect much but this is now my go to session beer when found on tap.","uberez8","Apr 06, 2011"
1.66,-56.2,3,2,1,3,1.5,"I had this one on tap while in Chicago yesterday. I hadn't heard of it before so I thought I'd give it a try. It was a huge disappointment. It arrived a very pale gold in color with a light white head. It was very clear. It smelled of a skunked dortmunder lager and didn't have much ""kolsch"" to it at all. I was really disappointed. The flavor too, of skunked dortmunder. Bummer! It drank light but I hated it. Luckily the manager came by and asked us how our meal was and brought me a fresh Lagunitas IPA to replace it. Amazing and courteous gesture!","aasher","Mar 27, 2011"
4,5.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Sizable plume of white head tapers to a clinging lace; pale yellow color has a great clarity to it. Smells of fresh- baked shortbread, hint of lemon zest and subtle wildflowers. Deep-planted crispness presents the lighter body in a lush manner. Dry from start to finish, the lightly toasted cracker maltiness holds more flavor than expected. Lemon herbal hoppiness lends more than enough bitterness to get by. Ghostlike sulfur. Clean grainy finish. Obviously someone got their homework right here--this is more proof that smaller brewers can brew extremely flavorful, pale-colored beers. Kudos to Metro!","BeerAdvocate","Mar 23, 2011"

4.1,8.2,4,4,4,4,4.5,"The body is crisp and clean. Carbonation level spritzes it up, without fizzing the mouth up. Lots of lemon tartness, mild hop presence, slight earthy quality. This is a splendid ""tame"" beer. Perfect for the warmer months, but just fine any other time. Tasty, refreshing beer. Recommend.","Onenote81","Feb 22, 2011"
3.8,0.3,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Conclusion: My overall impression was fairly good. It was clean, nothing that was offensive. Mostly I prefer darker more assertive beers, and I don't typically reach for lagers, but this was good. It was a simple professional tasting kolsh.","LacquerHead","Feb 19, 2011"

3.7,-2.4,3,3,4,4,4,"Had this out of a bottle poured into a pint. Poured a light golden yellow, just a touch darker than you see with a BMC type beer. Thin head that disappeared quickly. Not a lot to the aroma, a bit of grass/hay and a tad of sweetness that I couldn't place. Flavor was nice and refreshing. Malty and bready up front, finishes with a hint of honey. Nice and crisp, good carbonation level and goes down easy. Could definitely put a few of these away pretty quickly. It's the dead of winter right now, but this would be a great beer for a hot summer day at the beach.","mjhorn","Feb 12, 2011"
3.18,-16.1,4,3.5,3,3,3,"Beer is sweet and light in body. There is a strong graininess and an unfortunate aftertaste. It's not the best Kolsch I've had. I doubt i would have it again.","drabmuh","Feb 05, 2011"
3.6,-5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Pour brings a slightly-dark golden color; it's a bit too dark for the style. White head that lasts for a short while before falling without too much lacing. Very thin collar throughout. Nose is bready and faintly pleasant with a fairly-large amount of fruity notes for the style. The taste is more toward the bready end of the spectrum with a bit of fruit and a very mild bitterness in the finish. Body is light but more toward medium than it should be. Carbonation is a tad bit low. Drinks pretty well overall, but is just good, not great.","Thorpe429","Feb 02, 2011"
2.3,-39.3,3,3,2,2,2,"Drinkability: Having more than one is a struggle I'm actually giving away the rest if I can, if I can't I'm just going to dump the beer and save the bottles for my homebrewing. This is one of the worst local brews I've had. I haven't gotten the chance to try any other metropolitan beers. I hope metropolitan can put out a better product than this.","wmtxbb","Nov 23, 2010"
4.08,7.7,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"The mouthfeel is light bodied with adequate carbonation, which does hide out before exploding along my tongue. There is a watery aftertaste that just falls short of being full-flavored. The drinkability, however, is high due to the pleasant mix of flavors and lack of any noticeable alcohol. I would happily enjoy this beer again. It's not up there with the excellent COAST Kölsch, but it's still quite nice.","jampics2","Nov 09, 2010"
4.2,10.8,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Nicely drinkable. Overall, this is a very good example of the style, though I'd like to see it just a wee bit drier. Falls just short of the best German examples, which is fairly high praise.","JohnQVegas","Oct 30, 2010"
3.77,-0.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"It's a very delicate beer, really, as it should be, and the mouthfeel is very prickly and drying, almost too drying. It's a solid effort, I just don't think it's quite as flavorful as your best German Kölsches.","lstokes","Oct 16, 2010"
4.1,8.2,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Nice. Just a well made Kölsch here. Well balanced, flavorful, and extremely easy drinking, I'm glad that I picked up a full sixer of these when I was last out in Chicago. Metro hasn't let me down yet!","Kegatron","Oct 14, 2010"

That said, I've had a few Kolsches before, but I also have some experience with what's intended of the style and what it should be. I've seen how homebrewers are supposed to make it, style guidelines, that sort of thing. I think that this brewery I'd never heard of before this beer came in my box may have made the best Kolsch to style that I've witnessed.","Brenden","Aug 25, 2010"

3.27,-13.7,3.5,4,3,3,3,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pilsener glass. Medium head quickly subsides, leaving a thin layer of foam. Minimal lacing present. Nice aroma featuring grainy notes, and subtle bitterness underneath. Very clean and crisp taste, with graininess and notes of hay in the forefront, which really come out in the aftertaste. A slightly ""grapey"" sourness lurks in the background. The mouthfeel features a pleasant bite of carbonation, though it does seem a bit thin. I admit I'm not very familiar with this style, but this beer would probably be best enjoyed in the warmer weather.","bristol2120","Jul 15, 2010"

3.98,5,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"I can't say that I've had all that many different examples of this style, but this is a good beer, refreshing and summery. It pours a somewhat hazy pale yellow, somewhere between maize and madder yellow. Head is sudsy, relatively small and white. The aroma is pale malt-sweet with a mild vinous character. I'd prefer a bit more grape, but it's a minor complaint. A tiny bit of butterscotch sneaks in as it warms. Flavor is fairly sweet, but there's a nice grassy noble hop bite in the finish. This is a refreshing beer that doesn't try to overwhelm you with flavor. Good for a hot day. Mouthfeel is appropriately light and a touch slick. Good beer though I'm still not entirely won over to the style.","popery","Jun 15, 2010"

3.8,0.3,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Krankshaft poured a super pale slightly cloudy yellow, with a large white fluffy head. The smell was of yeast, and a lemony citrus hint. Taste was crisp citrusy flavor.

I will keep my eye for this one again.","nickynick","Oct 27, 2009"
3.8,0.3,3,3,4,4,4.5,"Surprisingly full bodied for the style and considering how pale it is. Crisp spiciness up front with a nice bit of floral hops followed by a yeasty bready body with hints of pilsner malt and light crisp fruit notes, mostly apple and banana. Also, there is a bit of earthy grass and straw presence that compliment the sweetness of the light fruit and malts as well as the slightly earthy hops. Very easy drinking and flavorful.
