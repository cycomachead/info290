Color was a light, lemon-yellow (SRM = > 2, < 4) with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a malty quality, not very hoppy, despite what they said on the label. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was very light, almost like lemon-lime soda pop. Lemony, slightly grassy, very dry and refreshing. They were right on the money in terms of the style and I think that I would enjoy it much more on a hot, humid summer's day than a cold, dry winter's one. The finish was equally light and crisp and I would be reaching for another except that I only had one.","woodychandler","Feb 15, 2014"

Everything about this screams "clean" and it pays off when you raise the glass to taste it. It's fairly light-bodied; maybe heavy for style, but to the world of craft beer it's fairly nimble.

Perfectly clear liquid, bright yellow, consistently hued throughout, loosely strewn bubbles of good fatness slowly bubble upwards. The nose is full of hard country bread crust, salted pretzels, quinine, minerals and cut grass but on the other hand, banana, bubblegum and sour orange to lemon citrus, honey, nothing floral nor broadly fruity about it, ends on a pepper and salt note. It’s medium-bodied with a creamy entry which slowly stiffens into a firmer presentation of bread, grains, corn muffins and biscuits and more of that mineral water, saline stuff. More floral and added peach, apricot fruit, the syrupy texture helps the sweetness persist. Maybe a pinch of cocoa. It’s satisfying more in a warm your belly way than refresh you after mowing the lawn way. As with many, seems like it wants to please too many disparate expectations and thus suffers from lack of clear purpose. But no problem throwing back a couple.","farrago","May 10, 2013"

3.88,2.4,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Mini growler fill from DeCicco's in Ardsley, NY. New beer from the good captain is always an treat and this journey to a new style is an interesting move, guess it makes sense for spring/summer...anyway this one pours moderatly hazed, yellowish amber, under an off white head that lasts, and leaves nice amounts of light sheeting/lace. Light/delicate nose of straw and lemon. Citrusy, light and refreshing brew. More lemon, light grassy and refreshing brew. I cant say I am real familiar with the style, but this is seemingly well balanced and highly sessionable. Bring on spring/summer and lighter beers like this one.","Billolick","Mar 29, 2010"

The rosso release was brutal and nothing goes better with brutal cold than a kolsch...no wait, I meant any other beer besides a kolsch. I'll be generous and grade it as if it was a nice hot day outside.","drseamus","Beers"
3.88,2.4,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Kaptains Kolsch is kolschy looking with a bright deep yellow with some gold trimmings squeezed in for some slightly darker colors. A nice billowy white head. Scattered lace. Smells of grain, hay, earthy hops, lemons, sweet malt. The taste is pretty much the same but maybe not in that order. The feel is light with lively carb and clean as a baby's... I would and will get this again, easy drinking low abv and taste. Not as good as my go to Kolsch, Yellowtail, but this hits the marks.","BARFLYB","0"

4.22,11.3,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"The mouthfeel is light bodied, but has more substance than the color suggests. A refreshing level of carbonation and the general, simple character makes this a very drinkable beer. It really started to grow on me by the second glass. I would get this again.","jeffthecheff","0"
