Moderate to high carbonation with some welcome hop resin prickliness. Faint wood char in the dry bread-like finish. Obviously this beer is supposed to be bastardized, cutting across multiple style domains. Faulting it for not tasting like a classic kolsch seems pedantic and persnickety. In my view this is a more than worthwhile exercise in tasting gymnastics.","CalgaryFMC","Jan 17, 2015"

And while it's not exactly a summer refresher, as far kolsches go, it's not bad on a hot 100-degree summer Texas day if you're hankering for a dark beer.  You could do worse.  The rye suggests it would be better to imbibe in the summer or fall, but whatever.  Good on Stone for trying this one.","Atlas1","Aug 17, 2014"

3.96,5.3,4,4.25,3.75,4,4,"Poured a rich, opaque black with brown highlights on the edges of the glass when held to light. Two and a half fingers of tan head that grew as it sat and left abundant lacing down the glass. A very nice looking beer, similar in appearance to a stout. Scents of rich roast malt, dark chocolate, coffee with a bit of cream, a bit of a pretzel-like aroma, hints of grassy hops, along with spicy rye in the background. As it sits a little bit of fruitiness comes into the foreground as is common in the Kolsch style. A very nice aroma profile that is an interesting combination of a porter, a rye beer and a Kolsch. Flavor begins with a roasted flavor malt profile, with notes of black coffee and rye. This moves into further roasted flavors with notes of burnt toast, black coffee and roast malt and a hint of fruitiness that is very faint. Finish is dry with roast malt, spicy rye, black coffee and a slight tang with some fruitiness faintly detectable. Aftertaste is dry with a strong roast malt presence and hints of black coffee. An interesting flavor profile that tastes very similar to a porter or stout and is quite removed from a Kolsch. It is quite nice and the addition of rye adds a nice spice and nuttiness to the flavor. Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with moderate-high carbonation and a smooth, creamy feel. Very nice and extremely easy to drink as a result. Overall this is a pretty interesting beer. It has a nice aroma and flavor that are more reminiscent of a porter than a Kolsch, with the nice spiciness that rye imparts. An extremely drinkable mouthfeel aids the beer and makes it quite the sessionable offering. Very well done and unique to boot.","Auraan","Jul 05, 2014"

Pours crystal clear nearly pitch black color with a 1-2 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of chocolate, toast, dark bread, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, spicy rye, light char, herbal, light fruitiness, light grass, and roast/yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt, rye, earthy hop, and light-moderate kolsch yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of chocolate, cocoa, toast, dark bread, coffee, roasted malt, spicy rye, light char, light fruitiness, herbal, grass, and roast/yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy/roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, toast, dark bread, coffee, roasted malt, spicy rye, light char, light fruitiness, grass, and roast/yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice robustness and complexity of dark/roasted malt, rye, earthy hops, and light-moderate yeast ester flavors; with a great roasted malt bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, moderately creamy, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice experimental Kolsch style beer. All around good balance, complexity, and robustness of dark/roasted malt, rye, earthy hops, and light-moderate yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering; it tastes a lot like a robust porter.","superspak","Jun 09, 2014"

Aroma is nice, the brew smells like roasted and grainy/rye malt, bittersweet chocolate, coffee and some dark fruit. Taste is similar to the aroma, the brew tastes like roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate, spicy rye, bready/grainy malt, smoke and a bit of dark fruit, nuts and earthiness.

Tastes of roasted malt, sweet malt, spice, hint of rye, dry hops, and a hint of floral hops. Overall, great appearance, good aroma, body, and blend.

Aroma of bready and toasted malt, spicy rye, hints of chocolate. Really nice rye component to the aroma. Flavor is chocolatey toaste malt with light char, rye fruitiness and spiciness, finishes with nice lightly charred toasted malt, spicy rye and light grassy hops. Light to medium bodied with peppery carbonation. Flavors are quite nice, but somewhat subdued as expected from a kolsch style session beer, but with a surprisingly robust finish. Except that the flavors are toned down, this doesn't fit much with the light kolsch style, perhaps only because no one had thought to put a rich toasted malt and rye in one before. It delivers on it's name, a black rye ale that has been toned down to kolsch sessionability, without losing it's character. Interesting and well done.

3.31,-12,4,3.5,3.25,3.25,3,"This comes off like a very watered down porter, and it has no Kolsch character that I can discern, so it just comes off as just a light drinkable roasty beer, with an odd hop quality that doesn't match to style. It's clash of flavors and feel just doesn't draw me in, nothing seems to compliment, and while not offensive and easy drinkable this is not a beer I would drink again.","smakawhat","May 01, 2014"

Definitely easy to drink while providing lots of different and interesting flavors that keep you coming back for more. Surprisingly refreshing as well.

Strong hop presence with sticky hop oils, earthy pine needle, grass and spruce tip flavor that linger throughout into a bone dry finish. Slightly acrid but the roast isn't as extreme as in the nose. Hints of charcoal, burnt toast, coffee grounds and bittersweet dark chocolate countered by sweeter malt flavors and faint spicy rye. Again, the rye is subtle but it nicely compliments the earthy hop bitterness. Decent balance with low ABV and light mouthfeel make this beer pretty easy to drink. Nothing too out of the ordinary but it's an interesting take on the style.","corby112","Apr 29, 2014"

Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, rye, herb, and char aromas. Taste is much the same with char, herb, and rye flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel.

Pours much darker than I was expecting (although I was thinking more kolsch than rye going into it), with medium carbonation and foam that quickly dissipates. Nothing much impressed me about this except the idea. No surprising spiciness from the rye, no outstanding trademark kolsch-ness, nothing. Overall seemed pretty bland. Didn't check for a bottling date to closely, may have been old? Either way, won't be having again.","QueerBeer","Apr 28, 2014"

Even though it's a somewhat robust flavor profile, it's still easy drinking. I like this. It's a good beer, even though I don't consider it a kolsch; though there are some kolsch aspects to it that I can pick up. Anyways. I like it.","RblWthACoz","Apr 27, 2014"

The taste is a refreshing mix of chocolate, charcoal, floral hops, burnt coffee and some light rye. Chocolate and charcoal towards the finish with some floral hop notes and earth. Mouthfeel is light which surprised me a bit due to the color. Very little alcohol presence. Somewhat nutty as it warms. This is a very interesting beer to say the least.

Taste: light sweet fruit flavors upfront, then a blip of roast and toffee, into a big spicy rye thing with a vaguely lemony finish.
