"This is a lighter style of ale, but I find it very similar to a lot of pilsners. Recommendable as a summer seasonal for hot weather, but if you like big dark beers, you'll find it unremarkable."

"Easy drinking and light, but missing some depth and crispness. Nice sweetness. Average."

"The beer appeared a slightly hazy straw yellow color with a foamy white head with some retention. The aroma was a pleasant sweet malty smell. The taste had a definite German tilt to it, as expected, but wheat and banana...reminded me more of a Kristalweizen than a Kolsch. The beer had a light feel to it, but it was smooth and easy to drink. Overall, a decent beer and one that I would get again, but may not be my first choice."
"Overall: A decent offering. A good starting point from pilseners for the uninitiated. Good for summer and its mostly light body and low abv make it a good session beer. Berkshire makes much better beer but this is a decent example of this somewhat obscure (at least in America) style"
"Pours a clear golden, with a thin white head. Aromas of light grassiness. Taste begins with a lemon flavor, then some raw grain, then an earthy, grassy finish. The aftertaste is a bit tart. Decent mouthfeel. The carbonation is a bit low. Overall a nice beer."

"O - A bit of a letdown, definitely needs more depth in both the aroma and flavor profile, along with a slightly fuller body to prevent it from feeling like a light beer. Would probably not get again."

"Not bad, not one of BBC's best efforts."

"Notes: A great summer choice. I'd take it over their Czech pilsner."
"Bottle, pours hazy straw with a small head. Nose is grainy, fresh, with light citrus. A lot of fresh grains in the mouth with some light lemon. Fluffy texture, has a wheat edge to it. Very crisp, I guess this is a hybrid ale/lager or something and it comes across as a little of both. Must be drank fresh of course, but a really nice beer in that case."
"Drinkability: A very refreshing ale with light flavors. The slightly minimal bitterness creates a sort of spicyness that invites you to take another swig. A good choice for a warm summer evening."
"The body is light and airy, almost effervescent in terms of carbonation."
"Poured a 2"" head which eventually dissipated completely. Hazy sandy Naples yellow color. Smells of sweet malt. Flavor is not sweet, in fact it's a lot like most BMC mass offerings. Which leads me to say this is a good looking beer which happens to taste like many others you've had before. Upper average."
"Pours brilliant clear gold with fast acting white foam. Clean smell, lemongrassish. Taste is clean crisp smooth. Some citrus at the close. Flavorful yet simple. Very nice."
"Extremely drinkable and very crisp and refreshing. I will be looking for this beer during the summer for sure. Great job BBC!"
"Drinkability - Highly drinkable with a great balance. Would be a fantastic beer to have on hand for the warmer months, but is doing me just fine on this cool November night."
"Good summer beer. Would drink this again."
"Got a bomber for $11 at the Wild Colonial in Providence. As one friend pointed out, it does smell a touch like feet, but I think that's mostly the mild sulphurs from the German character. Overall it's a decent session beer with a lot of subtle spicy notes. As the beer warmed, that foot-like aroma did intensify, but it's otherwise a decent stab at the style. I'd rather have my kolsch have too much spice than too little."
"D - Drinks like a 4.2% ABV beer. Nothing too exciting, but still very enjoyable (for the style). A solid go-to for a hot summer night."
"Subtle aftertaste. You definitely want the next sip. This is a light refreshing ale with just enough going on to be interesting, but it does not overpower."
"D: Goes does easily, very mild kick, this is a highly drinkable kolsch, and perfect for a hot summer day."
"D- Very drinkable beer. This has to be one of my favorite Kolsch styles. I am not a huge fan of the style but this beer is good. Berkshire has been making fantastic beers and this just proves it once again."
"M/D- Medium carbonation, light bodied. easy drinker, could easily polish off a couple of these on a hot summer day. nothing extraordinar though."
"Gold Spike Ale is a beer that you could definitely drink a few of on a summer day, and I appreciate the low alcohol. However, there really isn't much to it, and I would love to see a kolsch that has slightly more expressive yeast, and maybe just a dash of more Noble Hops."
"Overall a solid performer from Berkshire Brewing Company out in Western Massachusetts. I live in Mass, but t have never had anything from this brewery prior to this brew. I'm not real tempted to get this brew again, so I might just want to try more from this brewery from Massachusetts."
"Draught: This one poured a clear, yellow gold color. It had a fair sized white head that left a bit of lacing. The aroma was nice, but a little mild. Notes of malts and grassy hops. It had a very clean taste to it. Some malts and light fruit flavors. Very refreshing."
"As a huge Berskshire fan, this is not one of their best."
"Â "
"On cask at the Sierra Grille, room temperature basically, warm beer is better beer. Pours a very hazy, pee light yellow with a one finger head that leaves nice thick lacing. Smells of funk, wine, fruits/citrus and malts, not very strong smell though. Tastes of wine, grapes, malts and a bit of hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is light a bit too watery, warming, creamy and a good flavor coat. Drinkability is good, good taste, good price, no off flavors to kill it."
"Yellow/gold with a bit of chill haze and a thin, white cap. Some sticky lace was left on the glass. Aromas of biscuit malt, hops (light citrus, lemon, floral) and peaches. Balanced flavour, solid hop character that was the same as the aroma, biscuit, light toast and soft peach, with lingering fruity hops. The body was on the light side and carbonation was average. Smooth texture and not overly attenuated. Pretty good and an easy drinking, refreshing beer."
"A 22 ounce bomber bottle poured into a nonic pint glass. the kolsch appears a hazed pale straw yellow color with a healthy looking two fingers of fluffy white foam. Flavors and aroma are of fruits such as green grapes, pear, lemon, melon, toasted wheat, decent amount of sweet malt. Light bodied with adequate carbonation. Surprisingly tasty. Thanks Tim!"
"Medium carbonation and lighter bodied, it makes this one very drinkable (from an overfill perspective). But from a flavor perspective, I find this less of a draw than other kolschs I've had. I won't refuse this if offered, but I won't seek it out either."
"Cheers!"
"D - Nice easy drinking light ale. Great for summer time drinking."
"The overall feel to this beer was very crisp, very refreshing and was lighter then expected. Good even bodied beer."
"Pours a pale, cloudy, straw yellow with a fluffy white head that leaves a thin cover. The smell is pale malts with some lemon and straw. The taste is light with a nutty dry taste followed by lemon citrus and a slight hop. This one is very refreshing. The nuttiness is a little watery which detracts a little from the flavor. It is tart yet a little creamy. The drinkability is great with it going down smooth and easy. I think if the nuttiness was a little less up front and maybe an afterthought this would be better. I like the tart dry finish though. Very well done, maybe I need to try it fresher as this is listed as summer and there is no date on the bottle."
"A mild, clean tasting Kolsch with an equally delicate mouthfeel that provides a nice balance. A very good rendition of the style."
"Poured a medium and clear yellow color with a smaller sized white head. Aromas of initial skunkiness then followed by breadiness, earthy, and grains. Tastes of straw, grains, and wheat. Has a light tart finish. I can see chilling this one way down and drinking it on a hot summer day."
"Out of 22oz bottle this beer was a hazy light gold color with a nice white head. Good retention and moderate lacing. The aroma was an appealing blend of pale malt, fruity yeast and some light hops. The flavors started out with a lemony hop note that then became a little grassy and seemed to be resting on the pale malt backbone. Slightly doughy and slightly bitter. The body was medium/light, the carbonation on par and the experience generally refreshing. Nothing great, but a fine spring offering."
"Extremely drinkable."
"Like a light juice; a bit of thickness, but smooth enough. Absolutely the perfect consistency for summer. A major summery triumph. Flavor is nice, repeats required."
"Drinkability - at first didn't know what to have while eating BBQ on a warm night, great choice in the end!!! Didn't take away from the great food, but the clean/crisp character of the beer certainly allowed me to feel ""refreshed", cleanse the palate, but still have a good beer flavor."
"The color was a very cloudy, light yellow, like lemonade. The nose was very light, almost non-existent. The head was bone-white with low retention. The mouthfeel was thin-to-medium with a light, crisp flavor on the tongue. The finish was slightly dry, but otherwise unremarkable. This was a summer-weight beer - light, refreshing, but not terribly flavorful."
"Pours a hazy pale yellow color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy white head, which does leave some sticky lacing behind. The nose is malty, with some hop/yeast tones, some spiciness, with caramel notes. The taste is slightly sweety, malty/yeasty, with a slight touch of hops, spicy, with some caramel. Light-medium body. Drinkable, I'm glad I finally got a chance to try this brew, thanks Andrew."
"D: I remember thinking that this brew would be great for a family event, because it is not to strong for the beer drinkers that don't like high alcohol content (most my family thinks Bud is good) At the same time, a more sophisticated beer drinker could appreciate the bottle conditioning, and fruity hops. It was a great way for me to try what a Kolsh style beer is. With such a low alcohol content, I could have a few and not have the wife yell at me! haha"
"Pours a bright pale yellow color with a thick head and some decent lacing. Aroma is malty, bready and reminds me of a pilsner for some reason. Taste is strong and bready upfront. Aftertaste is smooth and delicious. Kind of like drinking a loaf of bread. Goes down easily, very drinkable and I'm tempted to say that it's quite sessionable as well. Has to be the style for sure."
"22 oz bottle. Very thin, clear pale gold color when poured out. The head, does indeed, stay with you for awhile, even when it seems razor thin. Herby aromas faintly float from the drink. Extremely refreshing: easily could be drank with heavy meals. Great carbonation. I would consider this definitely one of BBC's most light and refreshing beers."
"Overall a flavorable and highly drinkable kolsch. Pretty true to style as well."
"An enjoyable beer on a hot autumn afternoon."
"Being a light style doesn't help in its Âappearence"" however, does have some positive, nie lacing, pretty active. Fortunatley this doesn't carryover to the mouthfeel. Nice crsip Europeon-type feel, strong wehat/pilsner finish. I do wish it were a little stronger though, at 4.2%, kind of week in that department, but on the other hand, makes it very drinkable."
"The beer pours a cloudy pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a wonderful pale malt scent along with some light hops and a slightly fruity yeast aroma. The taste is average. It has a bitter hop flavor laid over a light pale malt base. It's light and refreshing, but it's an off flavor. I think it's the yeast. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a low/medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is an average beer. It's got some hop character and a light malt feel, but it just has something going on here I don't like."
"I didn't realize this was a Kolsch until I read the header. The bottle gives no indication and I was expecting an American style ale. The beer pours into a frothy head that does linger. The color is a modest yellow on the pale-ish straw side. The smell is citrus some maltiness, I don't smell the hops at all. The taste is on the dry side, a little lemony, some hoppy bite towards the end with a little yeasty zing added as well. The mouthfeel is creamy and the aftertaste is not overpowering. This is not an overly interesting beer, but it is refreshing and quite drinkable. For a summertime ale, I prefer a wheat or hefe to this style, but that is just me."
"I feel it's very drinkable. There's nothing truly offensive that would prevent you from pounding back a few bombers on a fine summer day. The acidity/lemon taste is the only drawback I can think of. Even still, there's other local and import Kolschs that I'd rather have. BUT if I were at a typical BMC serving restaurant and this was on tap, it'd be a clear winner."
"Another good offering from BBC, would I say it is one of their best, no way but it is a good beer. The brew poured to a somewhat cloudy golden yellow color with a solid sized head that had great retention that left a good amount of lacing. The aroma is nice as both malt and yeast scents come to the forefront. In the background I think I am picking up a citric scent that I think would be hops, just wonder if I am trying to hard to pick it up. The taste is nice as a few other things come out here. The malt and yeast flavors seem to clearly be there but also picking up a clear, though not dominant, hop flavor. Also some flavors of nuts, lemon, biscuit and others that all seem to come and go which lead to a complexity that I was not expecting. This would be a nice warm weather brew as it is very easy drinking."
"Pours crystal clear and extremely pale with yellow highlights and a bright white head that sticks around well for the style. Slight, grainy aroma with some fresh hop characteristics but little else. On the palate, well-developed cooked grain note first off, but as the beer warms up this dissipates a bit, being replaced by a slightly sweet malt note, then some bitterness at the mid-palate and a slight flash of acidity before the finish dries out. Big carbonation throughout and light in mouthfeel. Overall, this is a fine example of an American kolsch. Not my favorite style by any means, but it's decent."
"D: It's possible to drink many of these, but in the way you could slam a six-pack of Bud or bottled water. Was not overly impressed with this one, but will give it another chance in the future."
"Pours a clear yellow gold with a giant white foamy head. The smell has sweet malt with a background of citrus hops. The taste has sweet malt with just a touch of citus hops and floral flavors. Not bad,but there's not alot here. The m/f is alittle thin with all the flavors mixing OK. Not a bad beer,but there's nothing really memorable in this."
"Pours a hazy yellow golden color. There is a nice light bright white frothy head with good retention and a mild lacing around the pint. Smells light and dough like. Yeasty sweetness with a mild pale malt hint. Seems to be nice and airy with good carbonation. Mild floral hints with a pinch of a citrus lemon hop smell. Very fine tasting brew. Nice rendition of the Krolsh style of beer. Funny label with the two owners on the Gary and Chris. Scene from when the Gold Spike brought together the two railroads. Not notched for freshness. Very smooth and light. Enjoyable beer and I would drink it again."
"DA: Hearty and refreshing...very easy to drink indeed."
"D: This one is incredibly easy to drink. ItÂs light with good flavor. It seems to me that this beer is exactly what the macros wish they could be, in terms of quality. Normally, I would go for something with more taste or kick or both, but this hit the spot on a warm night when I just needed something refreshing. ItÂs just what you would look for in a summer beer."
"I have always been a fan of Berkshire Beers. They seem to hit the markw tih me almost one hundred percent of the time. Gold Spike pours a golden straw color, with a nice rocky white head that clung to the sides of the glass. Smell was somewhat pungeant, but with some grassy earth notes that made it a bit more well rounded. Taste was also full of grassy earth flavors, a little bit of honey, and quite a bit of hop bitterness, especially towards the end. Mouthfeel was light, but the hops make it seem slightly heavier then it really is. This was very drinkable in the respect that It was very refreshing. Like everybody else has said of this style, It is perfect for the Summer months, where you need something to quench your thirst on a humid day. Another impressive beer from a very impressive brewery."
"Drinkability: Very quaffable on a hot day, and a great session brew... I wish I had more of this around."
"NB: This is my first KÃ¶lsch, so I can't judge entirely to style."
"I really like BBC."
"A nice beer to drink a lot of I think."
"It's great to even have a kolsch since I've found them to be as rare as hen's teeth in New England. I would not put this one on the top of the list. I would, however, suggest trying it on a hot and humid day where I imagine it would reach the highest ""refreshingness"" level."
"Pours a one-fingered white head that fades quickly leaving no lace. Cloudy light amber color, yeast settling out. Hoppy/malty nose. Light carbonation and light bodied. Starts with a malty/hop flavor, finish is clean. Definitely a summer ale. $3.25 for a 22oz bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, Ma."
"I think this is my second Kolsch. I remember not liking my first very much. But this is a whole other experience. Pours very pale in color with a thin head that receded very quickly. Any lace quickly slid down the inside of the glass. Aroma is very slight--mostly of malts; very subtle. Flavor is all malts, some veggie-ness going on, but just from the hop additions. Very clean, The hops are pretty subtle also. Very light and crisp finish. Slightly dryness on the tongue too. Very easy to drink. Great sessional brew with the appropriate ABV to drink in quantity."
"Drinkability:I don't know how I missed this one, quite different from the rest of their line, very light, a bit of hops, tangy, very nice! I could definitely make this a session brew,..I recommend!"
"The ale equivalent of a spring zephyr. This will be on my wish list next time my buddy goes up to dDerfield."
"A good example of the style."
"Pours very hazy golden amber. One-finger head with smooth, tiny bubbles. Retention is fairly good. Smells of malt, wheat, and citrus. Delicate wheat and malt flavors along with rather substantial citrus are the noticeable components of the taste. Mouthfeel is very good, consistent and smooth. Another fine example of beer from BBC. Good for those hot summer nights sweating in your apartment over the boiler room."
"Light- medium bodied and crisp"
"Light yello win appearance with a head that disappears quickly, but wit hlight lacing reamining. Light citrus hop smell. Taste was initially lightly sweet, followed by a slight hop presence. Mouthfeel was light with some cabonation. Light quality makes it very drinkable. Probably a good summer brew. Not my favorite style, but enjoyable nonetheless."
"22 oz. bomber straight from Berkshire County. Pours a clear straw color with a nice foamy cloud of a head. The aromas are of sweet honey and bready malt. The malt flavor swims through first with a delicate hop spice. Notes of bready malt float up toward the finish with a refreshing, crisp, easy drinking end."
"This kolsch ale poured a clear, golden yellow color with white foam that settled. The smell was wheaty and malt. The taste was wheat and malt with a hint of hops, but with an unexpected hint of banana. The mouthfeel was smooth with medium-light body and medium carbonation. This beer was light and refreshing though the banana flavor was a bit unexpected for the style."
"Notes: Very refreshing with some simple complexities. Between the freshness of the brew and it being bottle conditioned it brings me to a happy place in beer heaven."
