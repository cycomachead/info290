"Nice straw color with hints of light amber. Thin head that disappears rather quickly leaving no lacing patterns. Aroma of dried grass and apples with a touch of bannana and plum (possibly vanilla). More apple and grass with the taste and something along the lines of tomato and herbs. Fairly heavy body with medium carbonation that fades quickly. This is the first Kolsch I've had in awhile and it makes me want to go after a few more."

"An extremely transluscent pale straw color brew serves prelude to the light and crisp flavors of tart granny smith apple, sun-roasted grass, spicy hops, thyme and wild herb presence, honey, and pear sweetness. Spicy and bitter on the nose with citric acidity. Comes together nicely, well-attenuated and reminds me of the new wave of hoppier, drier ciders. Chewier than ciders with a notable maltiness lending a comforting caramel aspect compliments a relatively high bitterness."

"Brilliant pale yellow in color with perfect clarity. Poured with a short, fizzy, white foam that quickly reduced to a wispy cap. Earthy dry grain, bready and lightly toasted malt and light herbal floral hop aromas. Medium bodied with an oily feel on the tongue surrounded by crisp, drying carbonation throughout. A nice balance of bready malt and herbal hop flavors throughout. Finished crisp and bone dry with light herbal hop aftertaste. A superb, crisp, refreshing summertime ale."

"Clean taste. Light, seasonal... Summery... Good beer for the upcoming outdoor season."

"Flavor is a bit of sweet malt and some sugars. This moves to a spicy and slightly bitter hop finish that dries out my palate after each sip. This is an enjoyable beer and I am glad to have tried it. Would probably be very good on a warm summer day or with a picnic. Easily sessionable, alas I only have one."

"The taste and texture of this beer does not match the style's requisite characteristics. Having had the German imports countless times, one should find a unique crispness, mild mineral-ity, and those subtle apple and/or white grape esters. None of that here. That said, this is still a mighty fine drink. <shrug>"

"A good well made beer perfect for summer activities."

"Overall it's very solid yet leave some more to be desired."

"O- Have not had many of this style, but this beer is not bad. Has similarities to a pilsner, but lots of ale qualities."

"a great version of a hard to brew style. this one had a beautiful pale golden straw color and gorgeous thick bright white head. nice flowery hop aroma, crisp, light body -- though a bit heavier than most kölsch beers i've had. slightly grainy note, but finishes clean, with good hop bitterness -- a little more bitter than most other versions i've had. great light warm weather beer!"
"Overall- Refreshing and very easy drinking. It is a rather flavorful beer for the more light-summer like genera."
""
""
""
"O - Flavorful, balanced, extremely drinkable. I like the simplicity. A great beer to sit back with on a warm spring day."
""
""
"Overall I would say that this is an excellent representation of the style AND an exceedingly good choice of a beer for the warmer weather. This would also be a great crossover beer for someone who needs be weaned off of that total crap called lager from those big breweries! 4 out of 5!"

"Sparse and small bubbles drift lazily up a super clear pale gold ale. Thin lace follows a small and pearly white head. Lemon, hay and yeast are prominent in the nose and, as an extra sessionable brew, the make a grassy, bitter impression on the tongue but it's not overpowering. This beer is extra refreshing and disappeared from my glass before I knew it. Perfect beer with my sushi, and probably and excellent choice to pair with Indian, Thai etc. Good beer from a great brewery!"

"This is a really nice beer. The taste may in fact deserve higher than 3.5. The initial taste is very bready and malty, but as the drink progresses it becomes more Kolsch-like with some lemony, grassy notes. This is a beer that I could sit down with and really work my way through. I wouldn't mind having some of these on hand for those high-volume nights."

"Overall, I would really like to try this fresh. While I still don't believe it would really stand out, it could be an enjoyable, refreshing summer beer."
"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 8/15/2012. Pours hazy golden straw color with a nice 1-2 finger dense bright white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of lemon zest, orange zest, herbal, earth, grass, wheat, biscuit, and nuttiness. Very nice aromas with nice balance and complexity. Taste of lemon zest, herbal, wheat, grass, biscuit, and peppery spiciness. Lingering notes of citrus rind, pepper, grass, wheat, and biscuit on the finish for a bit. Nice balance for flavors; with no cloying at all after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very crisp and smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Almost zero alcohol presence after the finish as expected for 4.8%. Overall this is a very nice kolsch style. Nice amount of flavor with good balance and complexity; very smooth and crisp to drink. Really enjoyable stuff."

"Nice production. Not too loud on the nose, but the flavor is pretty consistent and earthy. Gets inky on the end. I love how we're able to see these styles done so well nowadays out of the US. It's hard enough to get good ones out of Germany as it is. (And I mean that in that we don't get much variety distributed through the U.S.)"
""
""
"Even though I only had one of these in a sitting, I could have had more since this was easygoing and pretty light on the alcoholic aspects. Because this style isn't that common, this would suffice for anyone looking to enjoy a beer of this style. Better examples are out there but since they're not easy to find, this should please most people."
"Overall: a very satisfying and refreshing example of the style. I really wish this were available in my area."
"The pour is a clear golden color with a nice white head. Sweet, but crisp. Good pale malt aroma, light hoppiness (mostly floral), and quite clean. The flavor is nicely refreshing. Good clean malt and hop flavors with minimal bitterness. A mild sweetness of bread and a crisp finish."

"O - A nice summer refresher with enough flavors to be interesting."
""
"Overall - An above average Kölsch that is very drinkable especially on a hot day. Not something I'd go out of my way to have again, but well worth a try."
"Overall it's a good Kolsch but I can find more crisp and balanced versions of the style."
""
""
""
""
"A perfectly brewed Kolsch. One of the very best I've had. An exceptional beer. I will be going back to the store and getting a few 6'ers of this for sure. Highly recommended."
""
"Great summer beer."
""
""
"From the 12 oz bottle purchased at the Foodery in Philadelphia."
"D - Not bad, it is a good example of the style and while it won't win any points for complexity it is very refreshing."
"Overall: A very nice Kolsch. Flavorful, no off putting notes and nice body to this one."
"O/D-A great beer from a style I am not very familiar with. I really enjoyed this. An awesome warm-weather beer. Light but boasts plenty of flavor. Cool, cool, cool."
""
""
"Overall: A refreshing example of the style - not unexpected from this brewery with a knack for the Germanic"
""
""
"Strong aroma is malty and yeasty with a hint of caramel. It pours a clear, wan yellow with a fluffy and not persistent white head. OK, what can I say - I prefer darker beers. Fortunately, appearance is this beer’s weakest point, as the malty flavor has firm yeasty and fruity notes, not complex but refreshing. Texture has good body and a fair amount of fizz. Overall, nothing to Tweet about but still OK."
"RJT"

"Overall: Good beer. Could easily have a lot of these in the summer. There's things I'd like to be done a bit differently (more hops in the flavor and aroma, less yeast presence in flavor), but it's still a well done beer, and a good value."
"This beer pours a bold, clear gold with no head or lace. It's aroma is of lemons, bread, and honey. The flavor has notes of lemon, honey, and cake with a hop bitterness in the finish that mellows as it warms. The mouthfeel is light and refreshing. Stoudts Karnival Kolsch is a good beer, recommended."
"Great mouthfeel- light bodied and well carbonated (I do love the prickly ones). Not a must have in my book but certainly a delicious and refreshing session beer."
""
""
""
"Color was a beautiful pale lemon-yellow and if that makes me a sissy in Greg Koch's eyes, so be it. Mouthfeel was full, almost creamy and the soft grassy hops were delicious in the mouth. The finish was semi-dry and very refreshing. This would be a most welcome summer beer, especially after doing lawn work. Plus, the sticky lacing was beautiful."
""
""
"Beer is wet and nice. It is clean and sweet up front. Nice crispness to the palate and the finish is great. I'd have this again. "
""
""
""
""
"Overall there is not much going on here but I guess this is the Kolsch style; this is similar to other Kolsch style beers I have had. It is not all bad the the addition of some fruit, more spice and hops would soup this up nicely."
""

"I had this on draft at paradise by the slice. It had a nice clear golden color body with a nice 2""foamy head that hung around a while. The smell was of lemony, grassy hops. The taste was nice and crisp, sweet grain and some bitter hops to finish it off. The mouth feel was great, nice and smooth and very tasty, good one to drink when it is warm out."
"O- Almost like their gold lager, made with ale yeast. A very refreshing spring/summer beer, and would be a great gateway beer for macro drinkers."
"O: Dryness, bitterness and maltiness seem to stand out in this beer, which is quite easy to drink given its low alcohol content."
"Karnival kolsch pours pale yellow and holds a modest, creamy head of foam. It has a crisp, clean aroma of grainy lemony grassiness. A subtle malt sweetness comes through behind subdued lemony hoppy notes. The mouthfeel is great: creamy and smooth with a little crisp bite from the moderate carbonation. Overall I like this one a lot and is a nice ""light"" craft beer for the warmer weather."
""

"GOOD, WORTH HAVING!"

"This is a great example of an under-appreciated style."
"Overall this nothing special but again there is nothing wrong here. Dry and assertive all the while adding some bready notes and fairly subtle lemon characters."
" Full carbonation made the mouth feel incredibly clean and well refreshed. Light, delicious, and beautiful."
"It is a good summer brew. This is my first kolsch in a couple years and it is nice to get back to this."
"More pilsner than kolsch because of the excessive hoppiness, definitely an American interpretation. That said, i really enjoyed this beer, still had that recognizable Kolsch fruitiness."
"Overall: This one is not bad. Nice summer brew, nothing fancy but sometimes that is A-OK. I'd buy it again."
"O - Don't really care for Kolsch's but this is a good representation of the style. I could stand to drink a few of these in the right situation"
"O: This is my go to American Kolsch and always makes me feel like the season is changing. Cheers!"
"Great drinking experience. TBH, it doesn't seem too different from a lager, sort of like a dry Pilsener but more subdued and less grassy. It seems like balance and restraint are real hallmarks of this beer and I applaud Stoudts for making a fine version of a lesser known and hard to imitate style."
"Poured a slightly hazy pale yellow with a large white fizzy head that had good retention and produced excellent lacing. The aroma was of straw malts, a nice grassy hop and a soapy scented yeast with hints of citrus and maybe honey. It tasted rather bitter and mildly acidic with a nice citrus note at first with the flavor becoming just a bit sour with a nice hoppy finish. Mouthfeel was was light in body and watery in texture with a nice soft carbonation.Overall it was nice and flavorful, although nothing too special."
"O: Overall a decent flavor with an added measure of hops making for a light drinking affair, maybe not as clean malt wise or as crisp as its german counterparts, but again this a tough act to measure up to. I consumed this at 99F and found it refreshing, drinking almost like a pale ale at times."
"O (D) - a fine summer beer for sure!"
"This beer pours out as a really nice clarity, yellow body and a fizzy white head. The aroma is light, most has a nose of some malt and grains. Not really much hop aroma at all here. The taste is light all around. The flavor that it does have is pretty refreshing though. The mouthfeel is very light and very easy to drink. Overall not a bad Kolsch."
"Very drinkable, good hot weather beer that wants you to follow with another. Overall, I enjoyed this greatlky, and was very pleasantly surprised by this American crafted tribute to the Kölsch style. Will definitely recommend!"
"D - Very drinkable. There is enough flavor and complexity to keep the beer interesting without every feeling watery or empty. The beer is super crisp and smooth and a nice balance of flavors. The light hop addition is really nice."
"O= very decent beer but a far stretch to call it a Kolsch."
"A nice tasty hot day beer, better than a lot of other summer kolschs out there."
"The beer pours a hazy pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has everything a good pilsner has to offer; pilsner malts and Czech hops, except this beer has some mild Kolsch yeast esters. The taste is much the same. It's a little more bitter than most Kolschs' I've had in the past. It seems like it's modeled after a traditional Czech pilsner, but substituting the yeast strains. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is an easy drinking beer. It would be a hit with both ale and lager drinkers alike."
"Overall: Overall a decent offering and you have to applaud Stoudts for producing a style that is relatively rare among American craft brewers."
"Pours from the 12 oz. bottle a macro-like pale straw yellow with a foamy one finger head that settles into a collar of medium thickness. Carbonation is very active...there's a ton of bubbles rising. Aroma is slightly citrusy...there's a hint of lemon going on. 1st sip is light, crisp, and tart with more of the lemon peel thing going on. There is a bitterness on the background which comes more from the lemon than any hops notes. Mouthfeel is light & lager-like. Overall, this is an OK beer, but nothing that rocks my world. Would go nice with something off the grill on a hot summer weekend afternoon, but not something i'd put on my ""must have"" list."
"Poured a clear, light golden color, with a frothy white head that dissipated rather quickly to a thin layer. Aroma of light malts and hay. Similar taste, with lightly toasted malts, hay, grass, earth, just a hint of hops, and a slightly bitter aftertaste. Very light profile, crisp, refreshing, and quite drinkable for a summer beer. I'm not a big fan of the style, but this was okay."
"O- I'm enjoying this beer and it could be a good one for the summer months when you want something refreshing."
"This beer has a smooth and refreshing taste with a very faint bitter bite. Highly drinkable. I had it outside on a patio with bratwurst, it was wonderful in the spring sun. I can see myself drinking this beer again in the hot summer months."
"Anyone who's brewed with a Kolsch yeast has undoubtedly noted the terrible smell given off during primary fermentation. Only with aging at near-lagering temps and perhaps a finning agent or two can you get rid of that and let the more delicate notes shine. My impression of Karnival Kolsch was that it was rushed through production and filtered for clarity."
"Very clear, sparkling straw to pale gold body, capped by a thin fizzy white head. Lots of bubbles racing to the surface. Moderate lacing. Pleasant malty aroma with a hint of fresh bread. Very tasty, sweet, crisp and smooth. Did not detect much of a hops presence. Mouthfeel is light, oily and soft. Certainly an upgrade over the everyday American lager, I really like this beer."
"D: This is the perfect lager to throw down on a warm summer day. Concert tailgate anyone?"
"D: refreshingly light. some subtle hop, and fruit flavors. overall a tasty nice summer beer."
"Pours a clean golden yellow, with a white head. In the aroma, a faint small malt and a hint of tart earthiness. In the taste, small faint tartness, earthy, and a dry malt. A small bite and light bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry to clean aftertaste. Nice earthy presence, clean and light."
"O: Highly drinkable for sure. I could see myself popping a few of these around the pool in the summertime. Hey, that's what this was created for right?"
"D: rather drinkable but could use a tiny bit more carbonation. A pretty solid beer over all."
"It is perhaps a bit too light, as the style should be. The smell is good - again, a bit lighter than my preference. But it's a well made beer and one you could drink again and again."
"This Kolsch was just what I was looking for from the style. A really easy drinker that manages a good deal of complexity and enough hops to satisfy a hophead."
"I think I'm a fan. Nothing amazing, but surely a beer I need to work into my rotation somehow in the future. Cleans up and delivers a good amount of flavor without being overbearing. Truly easy to drink like it should be. I want to say Kolsch but it seems too simple to be that... the Stange and then it to be kolsch screams too easy to guess. Ahh, hell. I don't know for sure. Pilsner?! Nah..."
"In general it's on the mid-upper range of the style, but if they'd gone any lighter I'd imagine today's consumers would grumble, thinking it too light (don't let them know it has less alcohol than Bud). A touch more carbonation might help to give it a little more refreshing crispness, but it's still quite good as it is. Overall, they've done a very good job with a very specifically defined style (keeping it from becoming a Blonde ale or a fruity Euro ""lager""). Best of all, it's probably fresh! Prost!"
"The aroma was rather light, touches of caramel malts, light bready tones and a hint of banana were all that were readily noticeable, not bad really, would have liked a bit more of a pop in it though if I am being honest. The flavor was very nice though. Rich notes of biscuit and bready malts, layered on top of a light fruity spike of flavor. Some nice touches of grain coming through mid palate before dropping back into a smooth, and subtle feel. Crisp and clean finish left only the lightest bit of caramel flavor on the tongue before fading into the back and leaving me ready for the next sip. Nice, smooth, easy carbonation was an ease to drink, and I would have no issue with putting down multiples of this one."
"Light bodied and poundable, I'd love to try it on tap."
"Excellent example of the style. Nice head when poured from the growler. Nice lacing left in the glass. Not overly bitter with a nice crystal malt undertone. This is a most drinkable beer especially with the weather turning warmer. Highly recommended."
"Karnival Kolsch pours a clear golden with fine clarity and some bone white fizzling head. Aroma of some hops and pale malts backing. In the flavor, nice crisp green hop presence, giving a nice herbal spiciness to the beer. Base beer is of crystal malts and a nice even grainyness. Grassy and slightly citric hops are there the whole way through. Mouthfeel is clean and light. Overall, a nice kolsch brewed to style. Refreshing and would be a good summer beer."
"Pours a crystal clear pale straw color. White fluffy head lasts a long time and laced well. Smell is grainy and yeasty with a a bit of lemon. Palate is clean and balanced. Cracker malts and bready yeast are balanced with a touch of floral hops. Mild bitterness with a spot-on dry mouthfeel. Very easy drinking and true to form kolsch."
"A really nice surprise from Stoudts. A great intro beer for your BMC friends. Very refreshing and enjoyable. A perfect representation of the style."
"I'm a big fan of Stoudts. So, to me this is another example of a good beer from a great brewery."
"This was a refreshing change of pace from the heavier stuff I've been drinking lately. A solid, drinkable kolsch, perfect for knocking back several of during a day at the course."
"D- Perfect full flavored beer to session, real solid brew to quaff."
"D: I don't know why I keep trying Kolsch despite disliking it as a style in general. Not a lot here for me, but if you like a very dry, light malt and grainy hop style of German brewing, this Stoudts offering isn't a bad choice. One and done for me though."
"Bought a sixer of this stuff, definitely buy a sixer. The first glass is gone before you know it, designed for drinking in number under 5%. Forget strict definitions of a session beer, taste this it's a session beer. Pours a pale bright golden color beautiful appearance, bright thick white head dwindles down with large bubbles leaves behind a nice collar of lacing. Aroma is semi fruity, pale cereal malts light biscuit tones. Mineral water with herbal/grassy hop additions highlighted very close to a German Kolsch, probably better than half of the versions we get just due to the fact that this is so fresh. Best by 7/19/11 on the neck label it has to have been brewed recently. Flavor semi fruity notes amongst the cereal/grains herbal hops. Nothing complex but simplicity can rock your world especially in this type of style, I can't wait for Victory to bottle their Kolsch. These PA breweries do German styles so well. I gave a bottle to my cousin for helping me out with the little ones, I guess next time my local beer store opens up I'm going to have to grab another sixer. They only got one case in. If worse comes to worse I'll got to Vecenie's and grab a case of it at wholesale pricing. Mouthfeel is light bodied ample sturdy carbonation dead on nails the style. My kind of drinking beer, it gives you hop burps and feels as like it was brewed in Koln at a small local brewery."
"Pours a clear yellow-gold with a two-finger white head appearing after a few good swirls. A bit of lacing, though not too much. The nose was a bit of light pilsner grain plus some very mild fruit. A touch of floral hops as well. The taste was along the same lines. Nothing too complex, though no clear flaws either. I don't think anything will ever live up to the COAST 32/50, the beer by which I will measure all beers in this style (at least until I finally make it to Germany). Light and refreshing, this was crisp and I downed my glass pretty easily."
"Stoudts Karnival Kolsch is an outstanding lawnmower-type ale. It has an abundance of flavor and isn't as simple as it first appears. The brewery should seriously think about a year-round release. Hey, those of us in the Midwest need snowblower beers too."
"Reviewed on 4/22/2010. Bottle. Pours a clear yellow with a thick white head. Aroma of sweet fruits, cereal grain, honey, sweet malt. Flavor is sweet upfront with a malty, bready finish. Easy drinking, tasty Kolsch. Slightly on the sweet side but that's it's only flaw."
"D Easy, light, but not perfect."
"12 oz bottle. Light golden color with relatively small head, and a small amount of lace. Aroma has some lemon, touch of honey, light pepper. Nice smooth easy drinking beer. Light hop presence up front, but it's absolutely dominated by a clean crisp finish. One of my new go-to beers on grass cutting day."
"D) A decent brew. I might considered drinking two in a row."
"D - Totally drinkable, could have more than one in a sitting. Would go great with a lot of foods and isn't too heavy. Great summer time brew."
"Morey's Bottom Line: A great beer from a great brewery. Perfect for summer BBQ'S."
"12oz bottle into my Rochefort glass...Pours a light cloudy straw with about one finger of decent head, not much retention, ok lacing....Medium aroma for a kolsch, light hops a little skunk to them, but tons of generic corn which is not good...Tatse is light but mostly skunk hops from start to finish, nothing too exciting here."
"D: Very good. Goes down easy. I could drink a few on a hot summer day/night."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is one of those good summer beers (a.k.a. ""lawnmower beers"") that is worth pounding down several of throughout a warm/hot day or evening."
"Decent color but not very good head. Could do better in the looks department. Intriguing aroma of muted orange and heather. Light bready taste with some of that faint citrus coming through in the background. A nice level of sweetness pervades, and a slightly acrid but not unpleasant characteristic begins to develop in the aftertaste. Goes down like a dream and begs you to pop another top. A great kolsch."
"D/O- Morning to night drinkability with this one. Flavorful enough to please a beer geek, but still easily approachable to craft beer neophytes. Just another great German style churned out by the brewers at Stoudts. Highly recommended. Prost!"
"The mouth is carbonated well, but this beer carries a smooth quality that is absent in most of this style. I kind of like that. Great crisp lemon zest at the front, some creamy butter, fresh hop bite, and a little herbal finish. Very nice. This really hit the spot on this scorcher of an afternoon."
"The feel of this beer is light for the most part. The bitterness is there but not too strong and there is a bit of a crisp feel. IS a bit refreshing."
"They had this on draft at the Amsterdam Ale house in Manhattan yesterday when it was sweltering and hot. What a perfect beer for a hot day. Refreshing and light while having some interesting ale-like character that allows you enjoy the yeast as well. Light orange color and very cloudy in look. Very enjoyable and I look forward to having one today, and tomorrow, and..."
"D - Insanely quaffable.... Insanely sessionable... Loaded with character and personality... Slightly assertive for the style... This Kolsch really delivers and doesn't pull any punches... Shouldn't be a huge surprise coming from Stoudt's but this is a truly outstanding beer... Wonderful balance... Nicely done..."
"Easy to drink light in the mouth. This is a perfect brew to drink mass quantities of great job guys"
"I finally found this again. Best by July 2012. I only have to add that there's a faint sulfur note on the nose, and the lemon hop character on the nose comes into the palate as well. Excellent stuff, though I'm dropping my overall from 5 (I'd given it a 5 for drinkability) to 4.5"
"Notes: This is a style that is growing on me and this is one more beer that reminds me how good this styles simple yet well craft drinkability can be."
"As many have said, this is a good ""lawnmower beer."" It's light and refreshing without being too bland and flavorless. I don't mow lawns since I don't have a yard, but if I did, I'd imagine this would be enjoyable as I drunkenly careened around the yard, haphazardly plowing through hedges and fences as angry neighbors yelled at me."
"12oz. bottle served at 53 degrees in a stange. No freshness dating indicated. Poured a pale, translucent yellow with a loose, frothy, two inch bright white head that settles into a solid half inch cap. A thick band of lacing was revealed during the session. Excellent nose - Lemon zest upfront with a faint suggestion of wheat towards the back. Taste consistent with nose with a Noble hops presence coming out towards the back and expressing itself as a light, lingering earthy bitterness between quaffs. Mouthfeel is light-bodied with a slightly prickly carbonation. I'm not a huge kolsch fan, but this is probably one of the better, style-consistent domestic offerings out there."
"This was very good for the style, and while it maybe lacked some of the vinous and yeasty fruit character that I normally like in the nose, it more than made up for it with a surprisingly complex flavor profile and super easy drinkibility. Just really quaffable and tasty stuff here, just in time for the summer season."
"D- A very nice beer that is definitely worth trying. It is nice to see a well made kolsch once in awhile."
"Drinkability: Crisp, refreshing and light without being entirely devoid of flavor. Recommended for good ole Summertime drinking."
"Pours clear straw color with a wispy white head that left some clingy lacing on the glass. The aroma is light. I pick up some grains and that is about it. The taste is sweet from the malt, some cereal flavors. Kind of has a pilsner malt flavor. There is a very light peppery and grassy hop bitterness in the end to balance out the brew. The feel is light with tingly carbonation; lightly sweet on the palate. An easy drinking brew for sure. Nice and refreshing and not very bitter. Good alternative for those who don't like pilsners or adjunct lagers."
"Surprisingly chewy, full body with a nice crisp earthy hop presence up front along with some peppery spice that flows into a creamy mid palate with hints of grass, straw, light fruit notes and bready yeast. The dry hops linger throughout over the bready yeast, subtle malt and apple, banana and pear fruit notes into a dry finish. Much more complex and flavorful than expected. Quite a nice surprise. Recommended!"
"Transparent golden in color with alpine white frothy head that stays sudsy throughout the drink. A pleasant scent of that is floral, grassy, a bit of soap, clean, spicy hop aroma. Light and clean yet flavorful: slight hops, grassy, wheat, grains, a hint of lemon, slight hop spice toward the finish. Light in body, crisp taste, refreshing to drink, a sudsy mouthfeel that is just right. This is an enjoyable beer for an enjoyable weekend. Bring the kids."
"D: Very drinkable, this has extremely sessionable qualities and a really nice feel to it."
"Overall a good kolsch."
"D-Wow! I certainly was not expecting much from this one and turn out to be very pleasantly surprised! A near perfect summer session beer. Plenty of flavour without an heavy feel makes it easy to drink. A really good beer to have in your frig for the summer to have when you want ""a beer"" or to offer that knuckle dragging BMC drinking neighbor or brother-in-law when they ask you for a beer! Well done Stoudts thanks for doing such a nice job with this old world classic!"
"Such a perfect session beer. Light and subtle. Easy to drink."
"Drinkability: This is a definite plus for drinkability. Not only does each sip follow naturally after then other, but even before finishing the beer I'm thinking about opening a second and I'd have no trouble at all spending an entire evening with multiple bottles of this beer. No question I'll be having this one again."
"A 12 ounce bottle picked up at Abe's. Poured into my nonic pint glass. Appears a clear golden yellow color with about an inch of pillowy white foam. Nose and flavors are of white grapes, green apples, peach, lightly toasted bread, grassy, a touch of lemon. Light to medium bodied with quite lively carbonation. Finish is prickly and spicy on the tongue. Very clean and drinkable, worth a shot."
"Drinkability: this is a clear session beer for me. For the style this one hits the mark."
"Light and refreshing, but not crisp like a lager. Stays true to its ale roots. There's light sourness that is similar to the smell. The aftertaste is tart. Full bodied for the style."
"D: Not a session beer purely because I am not liking the combination of grass and funky hops aftertaste. I've had a better kolsch beer by Saranac. In general, not my favorite style (pilsners also in that mix of styles I am not a big fan of) But both the kolsch style and pilsner style are normally considered highly sessionable brews. For me, this one doesn't fit in there."
"On-tap at Cole's. Light colour, with carbonation bubbles. Neutral aroma, minimal head. This is a thirst quencher but the taste was rather minimal.Only the faintest drop of lemon or hops was I getting. Unoffensive but fairly plain, and so not that drinkable."
"D- Karnival has a good taste while not being overly huge. This beer is refreshing, i could drink alot of this just to quench my thrist. Easy dranking."
"Overall this was a very well done example of the style, all the elements are there and in good working order. Well worth a shot."
"In the mouth this is definitely true. Carbonation makes it's presence felt immediately, producing a soft roll on the tongue. Some lemon tartness emerges and zips quickly into high notes of bready malt and lower notes of sweet berries. It arcs then finishes with a quick turn, allowing a floral, piny hop to emerge. The finish is still full and not as dry as some other examples I've tried (unfortunately), but IMO it is a solid representation of the style and a great addition to the local beer scene this Spring. Overall the beer moves soft and quickly while still hitting high and low notes - telling a nice refreshing story for the drinker to imbibe."
"A: Thin layer of head which dropped quickly to some speckled spots on top of the beer, golden straw in color, quite effervescent, extremely clear - 4.00, S: Dry and grainy on the nose, there also seems to be a earthy and/or herbal hop aroma - 3.00, T: Crisp, lots of grain husks, quite earthy and spicy, slight hop bite, hint of a dry malty sweetness - 3.50, M: Smooth and crisp - 3.75, D: Based on my knowledge of Kolsch, this is a solid interpretation of the style - 4.00"
"This is a great Kolsch! Nicely balanced...a great ""sessionable"" brew!"
"This poured a clear bright gold with some white head. It smelled like earthy wheat and floral and lemon hops, with some bready yeast. It tasted like floral hops with sour grassy and lemony hops, and some bready yeast and earthy malt. It was watery with some carbonation, and had a sour aftertaste. Overall this was a decent beer that seemed like a good example of the style, but was too sour for my tastes. If I want a sour beer, I prefer a wild ale that's more bold. Regardless, this brew was a bit dirty, but otherwise easy to drink."
"D: Drinkable, in spite of its deficencies."
"Trying back to back kolsch beers today,poured into a standard pint glass a light clear golden with a large fluffy white head that never fully settles,another spritzy lookin klosch,this head a great head to hit as well.Aromas are muted,only some light toasty grain,this is a crisp dry kolsch,spicy/herbal hop and toasted grain flavors mainly,I like the crispness of this beer.Now this a perfect warm weather brew that again isnt a throw back beer,I like this alot."
"MD- This is a very good Koelsch style beer. Extremely easy drinking. Makes you want to take a trip to Cologne and get the real thing. Thanks to DonH for the sample."
"Very nice for the style. Not the best I've had but it's nailed the drinkability part and would make a good substitute for a cheap macro for a lawnmower beer."
"Poured into a Bass pint. Pours a clear light straw color with a big foamy white head that laced OK. Citrusy aroma. Tangy crisp sour taste. High carbination. Would be refeshing on a hot day. Not a bad interpitation of the kolsch style. Very easy to drink."
"Pale yellow colored beer with a slowly fading head.Aroma is bready malts.Taste is biscuity and grape.Very bland and boring although not horrible.I doubt I would recommend this to anyone and as for myself this was my first and last.Definetly a snoozer!!"
"Exceptionally drinkable. The only problem is that my local store wants $11.99 for a six pact when the lager and pils are $9.99. Still, you should definitely try this one."
"D - This is a lot better then I was expecting. I think it's a very nice representation of the style, and one you don't see too often at that. I found myself thoroughly enjoying this brew."
"Eric"
"Kudos to Stoudts!"
"Crystal clear golden-yellow topped with a small, pure white head. Light, pleasant aroma of fruit, earthy-floral hops, and sweet dough. Pale malt flavor upfront...bitter, sweet fruity hoppiness, dry grass and other mild noble-hop flavors. Dry and crisp in the finish. Light bodied and fairly well carbonated as well, making for a very drinkable beer on a warm day. They maybe should have saved this one for a summer seasonal, but if we keep getting 90 degree weather all spring, I could see myself drinking this one regularly."
"On-tap at J. Ryan's in Syracuse. Appeared a brilliant gold color with a tall white head. This was a dry and hoppy Kolsch. As in there was less malt and ester than most Germans, but it was still within reason for the style and it was quite tasty. The hops were earthy and spicy like, good Euro hops, while there was a light bready malt undercurrant. No, it's not the best or most complex Kolsch (Summit's comes to mind), but it's a great hop-centric take on the style. Check it out."
"D - Very solid spring beer out on the deck on a warm spring day. Love this take on the style."
"Reminds me a lot of my fav lager, Pretty Thing's American Darling, just slightly less hoppy. I really liked this one and it would be delicious on a hot summer's day."
"Enjoyable easy-drinker; it's tough to find a truly fresh German kolsch over this side, so I'm glad to see American brewers succeeding with their take on the style."
"Great interpretation of a classic German style. But would you expect anything less from Stoudts? Crisp, well balanced, and enough going on flavor wise to keep it interesting. Perfect clarity and hue for the style, with a modest head. Some may find Kolsch beers boring, but I find them to be excellent daily drinkers for those warm summer days. And Stoudts did a fine job on their's!"
"D - goes down very easy."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a pale yellow color with a small head. Smell is mild, a bit of malts. Taste is crisp, malty and a tad sweet, fairly light. Feels light in the mouth and is highly drinkable. Overall this is a pretty good quality brew."
". A clear golden straw color pour with a small frothy white head , jagged lacing, lively carbonation . Aroma of citrus ,honey ,bread dough and spicy hops . Flavor is peppery , citrus ,and grassy hops , honey candy sugar and bread dough , crisp clean mouthfeel , short hoppy dry finish , light to medium bitterness , light body , quite sessionable and good , a nice try and a good beer ."
"This is a very nice beer and one the fits the style spot on, in my opinion. As mentioned above, I'll have a six pack in the fridge for the next several months."
"D: Excellent warm weather beer. Nice and refreshing."
"Pours a a golden straw color with active, fluffy white head. Decent retention, some sticky lacing. Smell is of sweet biscuity malts with a noticeable lemony hop presence. Taste is slightly sweet, bready malts and faint lemony hops again - not really saying Kolsch to me. Almost medium bodied - again out of style, adequate carbonation. Ok beer, definitely not a Kolsch in scent, taste or body."
"d: A very good offering from Stoudt's, but I prefer their pils for something sessionable. Still, I'll definitely mix things up with a six pack every now and then."
"Overlal very drinkable, refreshing and another good one from Stoudt's. Hats off."
"Mouth/Drink: Mouth is thin but this is a great session brew."
"CHEERS!!"
