"Go for Gaffel over this. It's an ok Kolsch. Nothing bad about it but it's not something to seek out."
""
""
""
"Is this a sign of we we can start to expect from Sam Adams; pointless and mediocre (if I'm generous) seasonal brews shoveled out there for the sake of competition and market share scrambling?"
""
"Pours an opaque but clean golden yellow with head as white and whispy as can be, into stange glass (which I purchased earlier today for the occasion). Smells about like a draft-in-the-can macro lager, but less strong. That would be malt more so than hops, and possibly a trace of adjunct (some Kölsches have a smidgeon of wheat, not sure about the Sam Adams variety). Very well-balanced. I prefer beers that more heavily favor either the hops or the malt or even the alcohol — up to a point. I'm not terribly enthusiastic about middlers. Taste is lager-like. More bitter as it lingers. Moderately clean finish. Pairs well with spaghetti, seasoned, sans sauce."
""
"This has a nice crisp clean taste.  Perhaps slightly too carbonated."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Very agreeable beer and easy drinking for anyone. This is a very pleasing style, and Sam Adams tackled the kolsch well. A beer for all seasons to be had here."
""
""

"Currently splitting a 12oz bottle into two pint glasses with a friend. It's not bad at all, aroma is fragrant and fruity. Taste is of hops and bready malt with a slightly spicy, peppery finish. Not a bad addition to the SA line, but I'm also not sure if it's all that different from a few of their other brews. It just didn't hold my attention."

"My wife and I once spend a week trying to sample every Kolsch in Cologne, visiting more than a dozen neighborhood brew houses. Best beer adventure of my life (we were there for an academic conference, hope the dean isn't reading this).  Anyhow, going in, having read the description of this distinctive local brew, I was less than enthused. At the end of the week, I was a convert. I have been buying domestic Kolsches ever since. This is my favorite so far."
"With record breaking snowfall this year and mornings that routinely start below 0, I welcome any beer that reminds me of warmer weather. That said, Cold Snap may not be the most exciting Kölsch on the market, but it is nevertheless a tasty and refreshing change of pace from heavier winter offerings."
"Good but tastes like a normal beer."
""
""
"The beer is what it intended to be, an easy drinking crisp brew.  Its not terribly exciting and there is a bit too much Euro lager to this one but its a fine beer."

"A really nice and smooth beer"
""
""
""
""
"Nice light beer goes well with beef delicious crisp taste"
""
""
""
""
"Nose malt, light straw, citrus, cereal, faint honey & floral. Taste sweet malt, grains, fruitiness, slight bitter finish."
""
"Looking at it as a Kölsch though, I guess it does have a pleasant fruitiness. I don't find the malt character to fit my impression of the style, but it's Samuel Adams ""take"" on the style so they can do whatever they want; I'll just pass it by."
""
"Just ok. But I was glad to have tried it."
""
"Pours in to a fluted glass with a slightly hazy, chilled golden color. Less clarity than I anticipated. The short-lived head of white foam recedes to a small ribbon of lithe lacing. The aroma is relatively simple, consisting of a honey-like fragrance, floral hop notes and little lemon citrus. Altogether, it reminds me a little of summer time and makes me yearn for warmer weather. The first sip brings a bright, vibrant flavor of cracker-like malts, with a nice balance of citrus hop bitterness. A little milled grain lingers in the finish. Medium bodied, with a little more heartiness than I expected. Still, it's exceptionally crisp and clean. Spritzy carbonation adds a little zest. This is a fantastic palate cleanser that stands in nicely any time you're tired of the mega-brews that we beer advocates tend to gravitate to. It may have just earned a place in my fridge when I'm looking for a good Kolsch."

"Smells sweet, tastes sweeter. This overwhelms the usually savory flavours you get from kölsch lagers - if there are any in this beer. Not very true to style."
"One of the best Sam Adams I've had."
""
"Overall: Not bad for my first Kolsch beer, I enjoyed it and would have it again"
""
""
""
"A great beer from Sam Adams, how they keep doing it I just don't know.  This offering pours out a great thick head with very good lacing, although I really am not a huge fan of cloudy beers.  The odor was interesting if not enjoyable mix of fruit and yeast.  This was by far the most outstanding mouthfeel I have had to date - incredible smoothness, very crisp and very light.  The mix of half-ale half-lager works extremely well - much more so than what I expected.  In short, the brew delivers on its promise as I downed a couple on a cold winter's night looking forward to warmer, summer days."
""
"Solid gold with some haze and a large head that clings to the glass in fuzzy clumps.  Smells of dough, grass, soft fruit, caramel, and clean SA lager yeast.  Honey, fruit, cereal, and spice in the mouth.  Some bready caramel malt again, which seems a little out of place and lessens the softness that the style requires.  Still, easy drinking and nicely crisp.  Plenty of that Sam Adams house character too, which can sometimes distract an otherwise decent beer."
""

""
""
"Overall : This is a nice escape from the winter blues. I don't know how I'd rate it against a typical summer Kolsch but perhaps they pull their summer Kolsch and market this winter version 4 months out of the year. Perhaps there is a difference and I'm not savvy enough to discern it. It is a nice beer and I'd drink it again."
""
"On the palate, the citrus jumps up to the front giving notes of lemon and orange, the coriander style note is a little more prevalent, and an almost hoppy kind of herb touches in.  The yeasty notes grow, especially on the finish giving it a refreshing clean kind of lemony-yeast finish.  Overall, the light body and refreshing flavors keep it a simple and pleasant brew to quaff, even if not complex."
""
"Poured from bottle into pilsner glass. Very pale golden orange with soapy white head, two fizzy fingers worth. The head dissipates quickly, tiny bit of lacing, with a little cap. Steady carbonation through out the session. It takes a little while to peg the aroma: I've settled on lemon yeast. A small bit of spice. Taste is subtle, tart fruit with a slightly bitter finish. Everything about this brew is slight. Inoffensive, sessionable, but not something I'd buy on its own."
""
"Overall:  This is a very enjoyable session beer.  Good flavors of malt and citrus and sweetness, with a very pleasant mouthfeel.  I’d certainly get it again."
"Did not like taste at all. Bland . Not a good Sam Adams."
"Did not like- not enjoyable kolsch for me"
"A decent drinkable beer, but other than a good fruity aroma this really doesn't remind me of a Kolsch but of a very unique beer at least."

"Aroma is rather unpleasant. Very mild flavor, initially slightly sweet. Quickly gives way to wheaty lager notes without much bitterness or flavor on the finish. I enjoy a more hoppy, flavorful beer."
"Citrusy nose, hazy, unfiltered...  a nice break from the 946 IPAs out there, and all of the Holiday beers."
""
""
"Great session beer, refreshing and crisp."

"Samuel Adams Escape Route brewed by Boston Beer Company, with an ABV 5.0% This brew pours out a cloudy light amber color, with a nice white head. Escape Route is an unfiltered brew you can not see though it.  The smell is rich with flavor, grains and, malts.  You also pick up on a sweetness in this brew brew.  The taste is nice, you pick up a hit of citrus, grains, and malts. The mouthfeel is nice and clean. There is nothing overpowering in this brew,  it has a nice balance to it. Overall I'm giving this brew a 4 out of 5"
"Pours with a medium, white head. Has a hazy, golden color. Aroma is not very pleasant. Sort of citrusy like an ale, but masked with an unknown bitter smell. Initial taste is fruity like an ale, but has a bad aftertaste of malts similar to what you would find in a Coors Lite. Personally, a sad failure from one of my favorite breweries."

"O: I didn't care much for this one. It wasn't bad, but there are better kölsch out there."
"This pours a semi-cloudy golden yellow color with a foamy, off-white head. The aroma is bland with hints of citrus and wheats. In case you don’t look at the style before taking a sip, you’ll realize real fast that this is no ordinary tasting brew. There is a lot of unfiltered grain with hints of rye flavors to this Kolsch. Unique to say the least."

"Poured into a Sester stange. Pours a light to medium coppery amber with a big two finger white head with good retetention and lots of lacing. Aroma of sweet and biscuit malt, hint of lemon, good Kolsch aroma. Flavor is sweet bready malt with light biscuit notes, light grassy hops and slight lemon in the finish. Medium bodied. The aroma got me excited, but the main initial flavors here are closer to a typical American lager, although there is biscuit and German style hops in the finish. A pleasant enough light lager, but not quite a traditional Kolsch."

"I poured this into a glass, it has gold color body witj a small head to it. The smell has a light fruit, bread aroma to it. The taste has a light malt flavor and some grassy/hay notes to it also. I also get a little hop on the finish. The mouthfeel is smooth and overall a good beer."
"Overall, an easy drinker best suited for the warmer weather."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Appearance has a golden yellow color supporting a thin head leaving nil lace. Smell is grainy, malty with a slight zip of hops. Taste is again grainy with light malt and light hop. Mouthfeel is light with good carbonation. Not an overly impressive beer has a off bitter bite in the end."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer comes across to me as an American Lager, something I might have tried in 1985 and decided I didn't really like beer. OK, it's better than some of those, but not by huge amount."
"Overall this is quite a drinkable light ale, but not my idea of a Kölsch. Less refreshing than a chewy and malty brew. From the 12 oz bottle purchased at Special Brews in Lynwood, Washington."
""
""
"No need for an escape route from this graduation party, but I'll take the namesake beer. It pours a clear brass-straw topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises light white bread, mild white wine grapes, hard water, and a touch of dark greens. The taste brings in more of the same, the bread and hard water taking firm command of the situation. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slick-ish feel. Overall, a decent enough kolsch, but it's not something I plan on having again in the near future."
""
""
"O: Decent enough, but I find myself wanting more flavor. Maybe it is just too plain for me."
""
""
""
""
"O: Very enjoyable, a good easy drinking summer beer that packs a little more flavor than your standard fare."
""
"Overall it's a decent Kölsch but it doesn't come close to Long Trails Ramble Kölsch. Why can't I find a case?"
""
"overall: a nice little beer, just wondering if a Kolsch should be slightly crisper?"
""
"12 ounce bottle, best before May 2014. One of my friends gave this to me a couple weeks ago so I didn't get a chance to drink it until now. Served in a stange glass, the beer pours a hazy golden/orange color with an inch off-white head that sticks around a while. There's also a good amount of lacing. The brew smells like bready/grainy malt, fruit (mostly apple), and some light herbalness. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some grassiness, pear and lemon peel noticeable. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's refreshing, smooth and easy to drink. Not a bad brew at all, next time I'd like to try a fresher bottle. Definitely worth trying."
"Pours light, bright, see through, low foam. Fruity, malty, nose. Mild bitter. Light, soft taste, Kolsch but with an edge. Only flavor is on the gritty side. Smooth taste, consistent, but unremarkable. Other seasonals have fared better."
""
"In the end, this beer is lacking in flavor and reminds me a bit of macro lager over kolsch."
""
""
" Overall, a well deserved 4.5. For a fusion of two bonafide styles, ale and lager, this brew did a knockout job of integrating the very best of both worlds! I will certainly buy this brew again. TAKE AN ESCAPE, YOU DESERVE IT!"
""
""
""
"Overall OK. I'm not much on this style, and I don't think I would ever buy it if not part of a sampler."
""
"Mouthfeel: Light bodied, easy to drink and clean just like a Kolsch should be."
""
""
""
"Overall meh, not one of Sam Adam's best beers, just a little Kolsch like notes, hops are not quite where they should be for a Kolsch, malts are OK at least, and it has a nice soft slight crisp feel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste starts with a touch of lemon zest with a hint of rind bitterness, clean dry finish with a fairly soft carbonation so it's not as crisp as it could be but it's also creamier than it should be too."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a murky orange with a foamy off-white head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, grass, and slight fruit aromas. Taste is much the same with grass and hay flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Has a light citrus fragrance with a hint of meadow grass. Pours clear orange body with short lasting white head. Nice lacing of glass. Crisply carbonated. An acidic and slightly sweet taste. Enjoyable."
""
""
"Pours a clear, golden color. 2/3 inch head of a white color. Great retention and good lacing. Smells of wheat, pale malt, slight sweet malt, hint of hop, and hint of yeast. Fits the style of a Kolsch. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of wheat, pale malt, slight sweet malt, hint of citrus, hint of hop, and hint of yeast. Overall, an average Kolsch, with no outstanding aspects."
""
"OVERALL: this is a good beer that would not offend or impress anyone. A good Fourth of July beer to serve to people who do not necessarily like craft beer. I will probably not buy this one again."
"O-A boring beer, more of a summer beer than a spring beer. As it warms the beer starts going down hill quickly"
""
"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, best before 6/2014. Pours lightly hazy bright gold color with a 2 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of lemon, pear, apple, cracker, bread, wheat, floral, grass, light pepper, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance of malt, hop, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon, pear, apple, cracker, biscuit, wheat, herbal, floral, grass, pepper, and yeast earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon zest, pear, apple, cracker, biscuit, floral, grass, herbal, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and robustness of bready malt, yeast ester, and moderate earthy hop flavors; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice kolsch style! All around good balance and robustness of malt, yeast ester, and moderate earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"O-Great offering from Sam Adams. Not too many kolsch offerings in the states so Escape Route is welcoming. I miss Goose Island-Summertime which was memorable. If anything Escape Route will encourage one to order foreign online or visit the birthplace of kolsch for the purest style taste."
"O - Not really the best Kolsch, and exhibits lager qualities, but is just overall single noted and kinda bland."
""
""
"D/O: This is a bold American-brewed kolsch that is full-bodied and heavy on yeast qualities. Pilsner malts provide needed contrast, keeping other qualities from becoming too heavy. Minimalist hops stay off the radar, although they are not really missed here. While refreshing on its own, this beer is far from being an afterthought and holds up to foods well."
""
""
"O: Overall while more of hybrid then a traditional Kolsch, it adds some tart yeasty nature of a wit, with the crispness of a lager and ale. Drinkability is easy, cleany brewed with a light dry finish. Its a twist on a kolsch, with some added spice and flair."
""
""
""
"overall not bad, not bad at all. new to kolsch brews. so this is a first kolsch for me so i have nothing to compare it to. i would buy this again. however i bet there are better kolsch brews out there somewhere."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"To good health and good all-season beer."
""
""
""
"Smells and tastes like Sam Adams ""Cold Snap"". Very Fruity, albeit good overall beer. I was pleased by the 5.00% alcoholic content, as Sam Adams usually does ones with lower ABV. Its a good spring beer, and really refreshing. Perfect for after a baseball game or a round of golf. I would order it again given the chance."
""
""
"A kolsch golden ale hybrid with the initial crispness and some of the kolsch graininess with the smooth body and decadent foam of a fine golden ale. I wouldn't rate Escape Route very highly as a kolsch but as a kolsch-type-thing I like it a lot."
"This is pretty enjoyable. The smell is basically mirrored by the taste with the malt and citrus themes, but the taste also adds just a touch of bitterness to it. I might get this again."
""

""
"I rank this as above average. It does not produce much to make you want more but also never offends."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a nice refreshing drink. More interesting than a lager, without the bitterness of an ale. The yeasty, citrus smell and flavor are reminiscent of an unfiltered wheat. Nice and light and perfect for springtime."
""
""
"O: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, it’s a solid beer worth pounding down for a while if your options are a bit limited."
"O - Not exactly what I expected for a Kolsch but nevertheless refreshing after working outside on a nice spring day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - refreshing, but not much for taste"
"this one might have you looking for an escape route to the next beer. really just an average been, once again, from Sam Adams. it seems like they are brewing the same batch of lager and adding flavors after the brew. But it is sessiony and it was the super bowl so they went down easy with some food, but i wouldnt buy it again."
"o. Slightly above average. Would rater have a solid white."
""
"Overall: Another good brew from Samuel Adams."
""
""
"The beer pours a clear, darker orange-yellow with a white head of medium sized rocky bubbles that sit about a finger’s width above the glass. It leaves a string of fluffy lacing on the sides of the glass, and smells of clean cracker malt and subtle herbal hops with a minty hint. There is even a buttery bread quality to everything. On the tongue, the beer tastes nicely crisp with sweetness and herbal, grassy bitterness. Very soft acidity gives a bright tingles at the sides of the cheeks. In flavor, the beer opens with soft cracker malt, opening into almost cidery sweetness and grassy bitterness that mingles to nearly cool mint herbal flavors. The finish is cidery and dry with a touch of herbal mint. The beer ends with a balance of sweet bitterness. In the mouth the beer feels on the light side of medium in body with a nearly crisp mouthfeel, a prickly carbonation. The mouth is left dry yet sticky with lots of saliva running in the pouches of the cheeks. Overall, this is a nice, crisp and refreshing kölsch. It’s a little too sweet for my taste, but is refreshing and a nice example of the style. Another nice beer from Sam Adams."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Pretty good for the style. I'm spoiled, as arguably the best Kolsch brewed is right in my back yard at COAST and I enjoy it on a regular basis. This one pales in comparison, but is still definitely worthy of a drink."

"The Escape Route is a decent beer...I would think better for summer than late winter/spring...nevertheless, the beer pours a nice golden color with thin white head that is leaving a lace. The scent has a lemon citrus zing. The taste is balanced nicely hints of citrus with touches of spice...very refreshing....something to kick the taste buds. The mouthfeel is lighter in body with good carbonation. Overall it is a very drinkable beer."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a white, five-finger head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Hazy amber color. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Light lemon nose, flavor is a lemony grain with light bitterness. $1.99 for a 12oz bottle from Bert's Better Beers Hooksett NH. Best by 6/2014."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear golden yellow in color with small streaming bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass. Close to a 1-finger white head that lasts a while and some lacing was seen with each sip. The aroma is of grains with a light floral hint with some spice as well. The taste is about the same with sweet grain at the front followed up with a light fruit/floral finish. Very easy to drink with no bitter or harsh aftertaste. Overall a tasty brew."
""
"A nice, refreshing Kolsch."
""
"RJT"
""
""
"Pretty spot on to style, which it doesn't surprise me that this would be a style Sam Adams can nail. I'd drink this again if I found it dirt cheap for a sizer, preferably in the summer."
""
""
"O- Escape Route is a good beer for its category. Its crisp brightness and hoppy bitterness does what it advertises: gets you through the remainder of winter. It is also very drinkable; it a more bitter, complex drinkin' beer. It has a very light build and its fruit notes might make it a bit more suited for a summer brew. Overall, though, it was a good, solid beer."
""
""
""
"It's not the best kolsch I've had but it's still tasty beer, and I enjoyed it."
""
"Overall: Pretty average kolsch. There are better alternatives out there folks. Bitterness lasts longer than most other kolschs and there is too much sweetness."
""
""
"Overall, I've had better but this is a nice kolsch. It has that ""generic"" malt flavor that seems to plague lots of SA's beers, but it's still tasty."
""
""
""
"The fruit notes were faint, but the finish was nice and smooth."
""
""
""
""
"Aside from the unnecessary haze this is a very crushable brew, give me a liter mug of this now!"
""
"Overall: Overall this is not a favorite beer. The appearance I wrote of was disturbing. The flavor was ok and actually for a Sam Adams it was disappointing. This is my taste and opinion and anyone who reads this should draw their own conclusion."
""
""
"An excellent drinker for spring. Like the very light toasted malt character, but it's a little beefy for the style (not for the season though and this is a seasonal.) Hops are appropriate and I like the two varieties used -- Aramis and Strisselspalt.  I liked the Alpine Spring a couple years ago and like this just as much."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a nice offering from the Boston Brewery."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The body is almost medium but has a thickness to it that doesn't work as well for this style as a nice, bright, light-bodied crispness would. Crispness has trouble taking hold, though it remains lightly all the way through, as the sweetness ends up beinga bit too cloying on the palate."
""
""
""
"It was light in the belly and highly drinkable. Gotta say, I was mildly surprised on this one."
""
"A nicely done kölsch-styled beer. Light and airy with a respectable mild grain and fruity note to the scent and flavor. The mouthfeel is pretty impressive and rounds out the overall character nicely. Easy drinking and satisfying."
""
"It is an okay beer, but is lacking something. I hate to say it . but it almost feels gimmicky to me. A Kolsch beer released in January?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a cloudy golden with a fluffy white head. Excellent retention, and a very nice lace. Aroma is of grassy hops, buttery malts, and lemon. Nice, but weak. Body was crisp, and rich. Taste has a nice lemon zing through out. Good balance, but for me didn't taste like a traditional Kolsch. Never the less it was enjoyable, and I would recommend a try."
""

"Overall a decent beer poured this into my trusty pint glass. Golden color with minimal head tastes all around delicious and very crisp again for me a long winters day this one hits the spot in hoping that spring is around the corner. Sam Adams just keeps making beer i like"

"O - Hey....wait a minute...you can't fool me Sam Adams!! This tastes almost exactly like the old ""Sam Adams Spring Ale"". (I would not be surprised if it was the same recipe with a different label) Decent then, decent now. And much better than some of their ""Spring"" offerings in recent years."
""
""
""
""
"The Verdict: Average. A weak, watered down kolsch that’s sorely lacking in flavor. I’m starting to think that perhaps I should stick with Boston Brewing’s darker beers. I’m invariably disappointed in their lighter offerings."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Foamy head, and fair lacing. Nose bready and yeasty. Pungent and yeasty flavor. Overall, this is a pretty good quaff."
""

"Overall: A nice, sessionable, and clean kolsch. Feels like a good summer brew. Could easily put away several of these."

"This isn’t the most complex beer in the world or the most memorable, but it does seem good enough to recommend a sampling. I will likely forget I ever tried it in a short time, but it is a decent brewing effort from Boston Beer that may not be a classic, but is certainly acceptable to the masses."
""
""
"O: A great representation of a style that is not sexy and often looked over. This should be a summer seasonal - not appropriate for a cold January night. Anyways, great job on this beer. Everything you can hope for in a kolsch."
""
""
""
" the taste is good with some hop flavor up front more on the herbal side with a mellow spiciness combined with mild toasted malt which has a gentle cracker-like taste with low sweetness. The yeast supports the hops with a clean flavor in general and adds a nice dry quality as it finishes. The flavor was interesting enough for me to enjoy the full glass and want more. I like the treatment and while I don't think it is the best example of the style it is pretty tasty."
""
""
"O: Crisp and clean but seems very bland and lacking flavor. I'm a novice of this style but I can tell it might not be for me. Given that I am trying to base my review on the style critics rather than my personal taste preference. I could drink this again but not one I will seek out. All in all a good brew."
""
""
"Overall I thought this was a decent beer and a pretty standard and fairly true to style example of the style, it had most of those Kolsch qualitys that I look for and there didn't seem to be any off flavors or aromas. This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, clean, crisp, not too filling, and the taste did a decent job at holding my attention, I could see myself drinking a few of these, but it's not really something I would drink a lot of in the winter time. What I liked the most about this beer was the taste and aroma, they were the highlights of this beer and they seemed to fairly true to style. What I liked the least about this beer was the mouthfeel, it wasn't bad, but I thought it was a little thicker then it should be. I might buy this beer again when it gets warmer, but chances are since it's a limited release it won't be around, but the label says it's good til June so if i see some around when it's warmer I might pick up a six pack. I would recommend this to anyone who likes Kolsch's. All in all I thought this was a pretty solid Kolsch, it had most of the aspects that I look for in the style and I thought it was pretty drinkable as it should be. Good job Samuel Adams, this was another solid session beer, keep up the solid work."

"From the spring beer 12 pack, this beer is a hazy golden color with a thick and firm white head. The aroma is clean, with some light pale malt flavors, a bit of fruit (peach?) and some very distant herbal hops. Nice, but nothing outstanding. The flavor is balanced, with a soft malt foretaste and a little more assertively prominent hop bitterness than I expected for the style. In fact, a little spiciness due to the hops comes out at this finish. The body is at the low end-of medium, with an easy smoothness. Good, but not great."

"12 oz bottle. Pours golden with long lasting, foamy white head. Aroma is of Noble hops, funky yeast, citrus fruit and pale malt. Body is medium and crisp. Biscuit malt, herbal hops, citrus fruit and some salt fill the mouth. Finish is medium and somewhat salty. Nice, refreshing, session Gose like brew."

"Overall - A decent kolsch. Falls in line with most Sam Adams beers: safe, balanced... and average."
"Overall: I got this beer in a variety pack. The beer is just OK. Nothing special nothing terrible. I most likely would not purchase this beer again however I would not turn one down if offered to me."

"Pours a slightly hazy light golden color with a huge fluffy white head that persists forever. Aromas of bready pilsner malt with hints of lemon, spice, and sulfur. The flavor is lightly sweet honey and bready malt with hints of earthy and light spice to counter. Medium body with a spirited level of carbonation and a slick mouthfeel. Decent brew, but not really anything to write home about."

"Very drinkable beer, but there's just not much character. Not offensive, but eh."
"The is in the Sam Adams spring pack but it should be in the summer pack because it feels more like a summer beer. Lots of grain in the taste with a lemongrass character to lighten it up a tad."
""
"Overall: Along the lines of their East-West Kolsch, minus the East. A surprising amount of relatively light offerings in this year's Winter pack."
"Overall Drinkability: This is definitely a week entry by SA. Seems like they needed a reason to dispose of a spoiled batch and it ended up as the final beer in the seasonal mixer."

"O: Not a good beer. Definitely surprised me getting this type of beer from Sam Adams. Very flat and very watery. So far the worst of the Spring Variety Pack."
""
"O: Many of Sam Adams' best beers are lagers (see: Boston Lager, Noble Pils, Double Agent, Winter Lager), while a lot of their ales are lacking (see: Boston Ale, Summer Ale). To me, its quality is closer to the latter. However, it would still make a really good summer refresher. So why was it released in January..."
