"Really nice summer beer.  I don't have much experience with this style but this beer is pretty good."

"O -- A good beer to have around with Goose Island's Summertime relegated only to the mixed 12 pack these days.  Another good beer for the patio this summer."
"3/15/15 (Bottle) - Slightly Dark Golden light pour, mild carbonation, minimal white head. Nice fruity yeast and lemon aroma and taste. Beer felt light both in texture and is a light ABV, and it felt smooth and refreshing going down. Nice light beer."
""
""
""
"Will absolutely seek out and purchase again."
""
"Flavor is crisp and refreshing initially, with a fruity touch,a lightly sweet, bready backbone, and a slightly bitter finish. It's a bit more malty than most, and diacetyl becomes evident as it warms."
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is light, carbonation is ok.  Nothing that spectacular with this one.  Would make an OK session beer with some food."
"O:  Good, but I like Fruh a lot better."
"Loved it, will drink it again, great flavor"
""
""
"This version of an American-Kolsch which is simple, straightforward and very mild, pretty sure that's what they were going for. It's a fine beer for what it is and I would have no problems drinking this again. Simple in a good way."
""
""
"People compared it to Sam Adams Summer Ale."
""
"I swear I've had this before.  Weird.  Anyway, this stuff pours a clear brass topped by a finger or so of dirty white foam.  The nose comprises sweet bread, mild stonefruit, a hint of sweetgrass, light hard water, and an unfortunate kiss of skunk, which luckily doesn't hold too much sway here.  The taste cuts out the skunk and ramps up the fruit, but beyond that maintains the smell's characteristics.  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly slick feel.  Overall, not a bad American kolsch by any means, but it's not something I'll likely revisit any time soon."
""
"This is the best American-made Kölsch-style beers I've tried so far, and I try Kölsches whenever I can.  The body just a hair heavy for the style, but the malt/hop balance is almost perfect.  I dabble in - and brew - many beers and styles, but this is one of the few beers that I buy regularly."

"O As I drink, I'm staring at an ""83"" for the BA Score. WTF. Are y'all mad?! This is at least an 87-90.  Delicious. I know, there's no glossy ""500 IBU!"" sticker on the bottle and no boast of 20 different kinds of hops, grown by elves in the forests of Middle Earth, using only organic growing techniques, but this is a nice brew nonetheless. For those that appreciate the style, I think this is a good choice."

"From a bottled and poured into a stemmed pilsner glass. Nice fine white foam head of 1 1/4 inch or so with pale amber/medium yellow color and slight bubbles in the carbonation. Aroma of very faint citrus hop, some yeast. Also smells like it would be sweet so that might be some maltness too, but faint. Tastes crisp and light, slight citrus tang and finish; very refreshing! Some hop bitterness but blends very well with the yeast and overall smoothness is excellent. I need to get one of my faves, Reissdorf, to compare."

"Overall a tasty and quaffable kolsch."
""
""
"Bottle: Poured a clear golden color ale with a large white foamy head with good retention and some good lacing. Aroma consists of buttery notes with light cereal notes also discernible. Taste is also dominated by unrefined grainy notes with light buttery aftertaste. Body is about average with medium carbonation. Definitely not as good as most example of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A decent Kolsch and worth getting every once and while. The fact that it's commercially available year round is a good thing. The beer is nothing really super special but more of a casual session beer for a warm day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall its refreshing dry and quite drinkable."
"Drinkability: Some wrote more of a blonde summer ale, true, but it has that Koln yeast and smell so I am calling it American Kolsch. A great style!"
""
""
"Pours clear gold, lighter at the bottom of the glass. Some residual white foam. Straw malt nose, some pils smell. Clean crisp taste. Light lemon in the end. Good firm carbonation contributes to the flavor. Some fruitiness. Nice blend, good style."
"O: A nice, egalitarian German style beer, but one that is too characterized by its funk and grape notes and not enough by its hops. The mouthfeel makes it worth the drink, making the Schlafly Kölsch a nice beer for a summer or fall afternoon."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Rich golden in color and it is pretty hazy in appearance. A minimal layer of foam rests on top. I smell that distinct kolsch yeast in the nose which almost has a honey like smell. The mouthfeel is pretty light and smooth. Ther's just a bit of bitterness and perhaps citrus in the flavor. A smooth refreshing summer beer."
""
""
"O: This beer is easy to drink and I found it to be a good representation of the style."
""
"Shame I only bought one of these, as this has session written all over it. While a Kolsch isn't a style that most people envision for the warmer months, this would be great to have a nice Summer day when something lighter and watered-down just won't cut it. This was a pleasant surprise and a great example of the style and the fact that this came from the middle of America only adds to the appeal and likability of this beer. Nice job by Schlafly on this one!"
""
""
""
""
""
"I was let down by Schlafly's hefeweizen, so I didn't have great expectations for this, but I was pleasantly surprised by the refreshment and good flavor of this. Great summer beer."
""
""
""
""
"This really hits the traditional kolsch extremely well though. I haven’t really hard many American attempts at the beer, but this is up there with the brews that I’ve had in Cologne. A bit stronger on the bitterness and less sweet than the others, but very very nice."
""
""
""
"Overall far from perfect I still like Dundee's and Samuel Adams version better. It's still very delicious."
"Can I have another please? This was my first kölsch. I wish I could try an import but this company seems to have a pretty good reputation, so, without hesitation, I bought a sixer. I recently made a kölsch but had intended to try one before making it. In any case, I couldn't find it locally and my wife was in St. Louis where it's made and had one for me by proxy. She raved, I bought the ingredients and when she got home we cooked up a 5-gallon batch. It's still fermenting on it's second week and I can only dream of making such a nice brew.(It's happened before so I'm still dreaming!) We found the beer at the local liquor store and they remembered us from when we asked for it 6-weeks ago and were proud to deal it up from the icebox for us. It would be difficult to compete with this subtle light luxury lawnmower brew. I was going to bring the rest to my father-inlaws this weekend but I may just go buy them their own sixer. No sense in bringing them just three beers. I'll bring them the other, Goose Island Summertime Kölsch and will rate it in a few days. Go try this beer if you can find it."

"Sweet graininess, faint flash of fruit, light body moderate carbonation. Clean tasty and easy drinking. Really nice actually and embodies the style pretty well, clean crisp and grainy with faint underlying fruity notes. Super easy to suck down"
""
""
""
""
""
"Used the closest thing to a cylindrical Stage glass I could find for this tasting. Pours to a generous white foamy head and golden yellow color. Lacing is moderate. Aroma is grainy, biscuity and has a nice touch of noble hops and white grape. Flavor starts with a rush of sweet grains with a following balance of spicy hops and a sweet white wine finish. Mouthfeel is light but sticky, good CO2. I like this Kolsch, it has the ale nose and the lager finish and the vinous quality that is the signature of the style. If the flavor or the nose does not have that white grape note, it isn't a Kolsch."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer is golden yellow and clear with a small white head. The aroma offers lager yeast, fruity esters, grain. Light and refreshing. Malty, with some subtle earthy notes. A tad sweet initially, with some sweet notes mid to late palate. Mild hop presence. Refreshing. This is a solid beer and hit the spot."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I like this one as simple refreshment on a hot day. It even has a modicum of substance to it - allowing it to escape the pratfall of mindlessness many brews of its ilk fall prey to."
""
"O: Enjoyable beer, but nothing that makes it too different."
"Faint sweetness, light white grape note when first opened, slips away quickly. Minerals, wheat and simple grains. Light bodied with a simple lager feel, slight ale yeast complexity. A good refreshing simple beer, though I prefer local favorite Krankshaft."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I dug it and I dig Schlafly's. Class act!"
""
"Overall: I like it as a refreshing spring beer. Low ABV is good too."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours a clear 24 karat gold with a thin white head that barely hangs on while drinking. The nose is relatively neutral, non-distinct flavors, drinkable fizzy lager-like beer. There is a mild honey aftertaste, but it may just be my imagination. The mouhfeel is light bodied, semi-sweet and drinkable. This is not a beer I'd try again in the future, unless only bud products were available on tap (basically the case @ the St. Louis airport, although I got a $5 shot of woodford reserve with my beer purchase!)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A nice session beer. Nothing overwhelming here in any area. I could see my self buying these on a nice summer day."
""
""
""
""
"O - a very refreshing beer, simple but tasty, a style I always enjoy but don't see nearly enough of"
""
""
""
"Unfortunately, this beer isn't close to being representative of the Kolsch style. It's not as nutty and dry as is representative of this style of beer, the beer I'm drinking also has significant hints of dicetyl taste and nose that are far too butterscotch tasting and smelling for Kolsch. It could just be the six pack I purchased. I would try it again on tap."
""
"The finish wasn't quite dry enough to beat out the German Kolsches. Overall for the price, a great American kolsch. Far more accesible than German Kolsches, and certainly fresher in the US."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: nice basic kolsch. A little drier than I would like. A nice start to the flight."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-A decent beer, very light, could use some more flavor, but a good lawnmowing brew."
""
""
"Overall, not an extremely complicated beer but it is extremely drinkable and a great thirst quencher on a hot day. Something I would buy all the time throughout the summer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm still not sold on the style, but I liked this beer. Very drinkable and with the low alcohol, almost a sessionable beer that you can throw back several of during a game."
"Overall- Very satisfying beer. An easy drinking summer brew."
""
"Enjoyable, easy to drink - great for the summer."
""
""
""
""
"This is a fine, light-bodied quaffable ale in the kolsch tradition. I have yet to be disappointed with Schlafly."
""
""
"I notice lots of folks have graded this brew as somewhat mediocre. I could not agree less. Schafley's Kölsch is right on the target, stylistically, and a fresh, refreshing, superior example of the style. I enjoyed this beer today, and I intend to do so again and again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a very satisfying brew, especially given the near 100 degree weather we're having this Memorial Day weekend. I would happily buy this again, especially if I could find it really fresh."

"D/O: This golden ale strives to faithfully represent the kolsch style, with scattered successes. The malt bill is metered and appropriate, yet flavors become confused early on as tasted acidity runs amok. Still, the tart qualities are not wildly out-of-place in such a light beer, actually helping it to be more refreshing than the textures alone would accomplish."

"As we all know, this style originates from the ancient German city of Cologne (or Koln); it is a complex hybrid that can only be brewed by a talented brewer - many try, many fail. Schlafly succeeds. This is one exemplary renditions of the style - at least as far as any American brewery is concerned. Auf Weidersehen!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A tasty refreshing beer that would be well suited for the warmer weather. It reminded me a bit of a toned down bottle of victory's prima pils."
""
""
""
""
"Not to dry or bitter, not to fruity, but packed full of mild hop flavors that will make you crack open another on a hot summer day. High carbonation make the flavors dance in your mouth, with very little or no after taste. The colder the better! One of my favorite summer beers."
""
""
"Very smooth while still offering plenty of flavor...very nice kolsch here, one of the best I've ever had. I like the yeasty presence and light grains that dry out nicely on the finish. Kiss of noble hops to give it some grassy sharpness at the end. Very drinkable, although I could enjoy this in cold weather as well as warm. Stellar beer!"
""
""
"One of my favorite summer beers and usually go through a six pack at minimum every summer."
"Smells good, flavor a little flat. Hops a little too dominant for the style, doesn't allow the malt to shine through."
"O: It's nice and drinkable, but probably better with some food. By itself the aftertaste is a little unpleasant and I was hoping for a bit more maltiness."
"I'd prefer it a little lighter and a cleaner finish, but this isn't too damn bad."
"D - Oh so very high. This is a very clean and light beer that craft and non craft drinkers alike could enjoy. It's a great beer to take to your hammock and relax on a summer or early autumn afternoon. If only Schlafly was carried down south."
"The aroma was rather light, touches of caramel malts, light bready tones and a hint of banana were all that were readily noticeable, not bad really, would have liked a bit more of a pop in it though if I am being honest. The flavor was very nice though. Rich notes of biscuit and bready malts, layered on top of a light fruity spike of flavor. Some nice touches of grain coming through mid palate before dropping back into a smooth, and subtle feel. Crisp and clean finish"
"Very drinkable; will be my new go-to Kolsch from now on."
"O- A good beer for the style. I could see this being perfect for outdoor events on a sunny day. It's easy drinking also nice and refreshing"
"O - This was my first offering from Schlafly and it was a nice relief to have this hot summer...a creamy, light, refreshing Kolsch"
"Pours a clear gold with one finger's worth of white foam with good retention. Aromas are pleasantly grainy and grassy but not much else. Flavors are simple but perfectly balanced. Grain flavors are most apparent on the front and mid-palates before lemony hops finish it out. Everything about this beer is straightforward. There are no harsh edges to be negotiated and the overall effect is quite refreshing. All of this is consistent with the world's better kolsches."
"If I'd judged this by its cover I'd have been suspicious I'd picked up a dud. Good thing I didn't, because this is actually a damn nice casual brew."
"This is a well crafted Kolsch. No reason to try any other in this style. Too bad it's only a summer seasonal for Schlafly. That's the only negative."
"O: Drink it fast and drink it fun. Not much more to say other than it is a good example of a Kolsch beer."
"It's definitely a solid summer beer, with enough flavor and body to satisfy. A good effort on a rather unexciting style."
"Poured this Kolsch from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. it pours a crystal clear pale gold color, it produces a nice thick white, creamy head. Head retention is excellent and lacing is average. The aroma has a nice base of grain and there is some slight citrus notes and suggestions of butternut squash. The taste of this ale brings to mind fresh baked bread, lemon and a slightly dry finish. The body is medium. Decent example of the style, excellent session beer. Outstanding gateway beer. Something a Bud Light drinker would enjoy."
"O: A nice example of the style, quite refreshing and perfect for a warm day. Schlafly has just started distributing in Iowa this week-- looking forward to trying more of their beers!"
"The Kolsch style is one of my favorites for hot summer weather. Schlafly does a nice job keeping this beer quite straightforward and true to style. Lively carbonation. Bright, clean malt flavor, moderate hopping with a touch of citric acidity. Great session beer here."
"What starts out fairly disappointing in appearance and smell, finishes rather strong in taste and feel. I'd get this again."
"O- An above average Kolsch and a nice beer to have on a hot humid summer day."
"O: Schlafly Kolsch is one of the best kolsch-style brews I've had in a while. They manage to balance crispness and creaminess expertly and provide a really satisfying, low-ABV brew that is great for summer."
"An above average Kolsch from St. Louis' own Schlafly's. Their brews are pretty sessionable and this one is no exception."
"Pours a clear golden with a big white head. Smells of light pilsner malt. Taste is sweet grassyness up front, with a sweet bready middle and a lemony clean bitter finish. Mouthfeel is full low carbonation. I like this beer it is light and refreshing, and the low alcohol is a plus."
"This pours hazy, pale yellow with a sudsy white head. There is very little retention or lacy, but I wasn’t expecting any from this style. It’s very clean and refreshing. I hate to say it, but the smell is like a BMC, It kinda has that dirty/sweet pilsner taste, but this is still a craft beer quality beverage. I can taste malt and hops, and this is overall refreshing. I would prefer a little more bitter and a little less sweet, but I’m not going to split hairs, this is easy to drink and pretty good."
"Bottled with love on 3/2/2011. Pale, but bright yellow in color with a slight haze. Impressive, dense head of foam with excellent staying power. Light malty aroma with hints of grass and hay. On the lighter side of medium bodied with assertuve carbonation. Llight malty/bicuity flavor throughout with a brief prickly spice in the middle. Finishes very clean and refreshing. A great summer ale."
"O: Really refreshing. Not a qhole lot of complex flavors going on, but i guess for the style, it is really nice."
"Overall, this is really nice for a kolsch, certainly drinkable. Well done."
"Overall this is a great solid Kolsch, kind of ambushes you a bit I like that!"
"O - While not as good as the German varieties I have had but this could simply be the difference between the bottle and the tap. I do remember Fruh (in my mind the pinnacle of the style) being much much better from the tap, but I don't think I will get to experience this beer that way. If I do I will be sure to review again. Aside from that small shortfall, a very nice rendition of this quite rare style (at least on this side of the pond). Will happily find and drink this one again."
"Taste is mild, but with a little hoppy zing. Overall, this is a light and enjoyable session kolsch. Not outstanding, but solid enough."
"A fine beer one could have a few of - not my preferred style, but not upset."
"Verdict: Probably very well priced and therefore drinkable to the nines, but not something special."
"This has a light refreshing flavor that makes it a great summer beer. The bottle I had was made in December, so I wonder what it is doing in winter. I only think that it is popular enough to brew year round, but it is better to wait till summer. Clarity and color are good. It is one of my favorite in the Kolsh category."
"Could be a good gateway beer for newer craft drinkers. Very easy to drink and quite sessionable."
"Drinkability -- Not bad, but not among my favorite of the style."
"Overall/notes - One of the multiple beers I had that night. I started here and worked my way through the list. Good way to start the evening. Fun night overall, and with good beer to boot! Worth trying if you find yourself at the Tap Room."
"D- Overall a good beer that I enjoyed. Drinkable and well made."
"Taste is along the same lines, but notched up. Cereal grains, nice faint citrus, noticeablenoble hops but not overdone at all. Saaz? Great warm weather beer. Extremely drinkable, with a very crisp, refreshing mouthfeel. Above average level of carbonation is suitable for this brew."
"Pours a relatively clear straw color with a nice white head. The nose is really quite faint with a bit of citrus and fruit, but mostly dry grain. The taste is some light straw and grain along with mild stone fruits and some light citrus. Mouthfeel is thin but well carbonated, leading to a nice, easy drinkability factor."
"very drinkable, medium bodied, medium bitterness, golden straw colored, seem to loose the head early but probably do to my bad pouring, good middle of the road beer to keep on hand for those friends who do not care much for craft beers, highly recommend this beer"
"This beer pours a clear, pale yellow with a rapidly fading head. It's aroma has hints of lemon, vanilla, resin, and yeast. The flavor is wwell balanced between ginger, banana, pine, and bread notes. It leaves a pleasant ginger-like aftertaste. Schlafly Kolsch has a medium mouthfeel leading to a fairly high drinkability. It is very refreshing and went well with grilled cheese sandwiches. Recommended!"
"Certainly lighter bodied and easy to drink."
"Picked up while St. Louis for a wedding as part of a mixed 12 pack."
"Overall: a really nice, refreshing, summer ale that seems to fit well into the Kolsch style."
"Refreshing."
"Good effort overall though."
"D= Crazy drinkable. I could session this all night, both from a flavor and ABV standpoint. Well done Schlafly!"
"I had this in a 22oz glass on tap at a bar while watching the Bears game. The mouthfeel was light and slightly sweet. The color was pale and the taste hoppy. Having lived in France and traveled in Germany, I can say that this attempt at a Kölsch beer is spot on."
"Mouth feel wise this is a thirst quencher. It is crisp, clean, prickly with carbonation and leaves the palate wet. This is a great interpretation of the German style."
"Drinkability: While it received pretty good scores and I stated that it was really quite alright, I'm still not a huge fan of the style and that does hurt the drinkability a little bit -- I would definitely take it over a macro any day and this is a fine summer beer."
"I enjoy drinking Kolsch's as I'm cooking dinner or grilling outside. It's very refreshing and doesn't overwhelm the palate. Which means that you're ready for a meal or a different beer right away."
"This is really nicely done. An easy drinking Kolsch well suited to hot Midwestern summers."
"The palate is simple, a little dry up front, wets in the middle, and finishes crisp and resfreshing. This makes for a superbly drinkable Summer ale."
"I've never had a Kolsch before, but it was the guest beer at my local brewpub, so I thought I'd give it a chance. The color is a very transparent yellow with a thin head that disappears quickly. Very effervescent with a slightly sweet aroma. The taste is light and clean with a ssweet yeasty aftertaste. This beer is very refreshing on a hot day, and I can see myself drinking this beer on a regular basis."
"Never had a kolsch before but I thought I'd give this one a whirl. It's almost like a cross between a pale ale and a pilsner. It's transparent and lemon yellow in color and pours a thin layer of white head which recedes quickly yet leaves a nice creamy lacing. Also lots of bubbles can be seen rising to the top. Smell is fruity and a bit musty from the yeast. Flavor is sweet upfront with just a touch of citrusy hops. Well balanced and nothing really dominates. Yeasts are detectable in the back and well into the aftertaste. Medium bodied and crisp mouthfeel. Lots of bubbles and a semi-dry finish. It wouldn't be too hard to slam a few of these down in a short period. Not sure how it compares to others within the style but its not too bad! I got this one in a sampler pack and I probably won't be buying it by itself but its alright for something a little different."
"The cleanliness of this beer is wonderful. There is no aftertaste that I usually associate with this style. Its nice and mildly sweet up front, some bitterness in the back from the grains, but overall its well connected and nice feel in the mouth from the carbonation. I could session this thing all night long."
"The beer is a light golden color with a decent head that fades. The smell is lemony and herbal. The taste is slightly lemony and crisp. It has a light body with a dry finish and is very refreshing. The beer was much better than I expected. It goes down easy and is very satisfying. This looks like a good summer brew or anytime actually."
"D- very easy. Definitely a session beer."
"D: I almost didn't buy this because I wasn't expecting it to be so good. I'm glad I did. This beer is super refreshing and when summer breaks I will schedule a camping trip just so i can pack a case of these."
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a Sam Adams BL glass, the beer pours a clear gold color with about a half inch white head. Head retention is decent, lacing is good. Aroma is grain, grapes, green apples, lemon and some floral hops. Taste is similar to the aroma, but with the grainy and lemon flavors being the strongest. Mouthfeel/body is light, it's crisp and clean with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and goes down easy. I think this is a decent overall brew, and not a bad choice as a session beer."
"Nice clear, golden color, just slightly darker than a lager. Poured with a nice head. Not much of an aroma, although I do detect a little citrus. Very similar nose feel to a lager with malt and hop subleties pulling through. Taste is very malty, with a slight hoppy, citrus aftertaste. Mouthfeel is a bit lighter than I'm used to, and maybe a bit watery, but is perfect for warmer weather when you're looking for a good, smooth, refreshing, flavorful beer. Seems slightly under-carbonated to me (I wouldn't go so far as saying it's ""flat""), but that doesn't ruin its appeal. Drinkability is very good. I could see myself easily throwing back several of these with no problem."
"D - Very high"
"Drinkability- Very enjoyable. Light and mildly carbonated making it an easy drink"
"D-Dont see any reason why I would ever buy this beer again there are way to many refreshing beers that have far more to offer"
"A nice clear straw yellow with about 1 finger of white head on top. Smell is of muscat grapes and some citrus. A nice crisp flavor to it with more of that muscat taste. Some bread malt and lemon zest. A nice light mouthfeel that is quite refreshing. Not as dry in the finish as I would have liked, however. Drinkability is good. Goes down smooth and is real easy to drink."
"Overall a solid, well crafted beer in my opinion."
"In general, a good, easy drinking beer.  "
"This beer pours a clear light yellow with a thin white bubbly head. Head receded rapidly on this beer leaving spotty lacing behind. Nose is grainy, some malts and a hint of lemon. Taste is grains and grassiness up front, moving in to a light but definitive malt bodied, in the finish there is a touch of lemon and pepper. Light to medium body, moderate carbonation, there is a clean crisp taste to this beer. If only Schalfy distributed to MA, this would FOR SURE be my summertime beer!"
"An easy-drinking beer to enjoy in the summer months."
"D- My only complaint about this Kolsch is the metalic tinge to it. Other than that this has been a very good tasting Kolsch. Not my favorite style by far but this was enjoyable."
"A great addition to a hot summer day."
"Conclusion: All in all a pretty nice summer beer...it's clean, lightly fruity, and a bit grassy/hay-like...it's a bit sweet in my book but not bad."
"Malty aroma with very little hops. Brilliantly clear pale gold color. No head present. Good malt with biscuit like quality. Light mouthfeel with mild, earthy, hop bitterness. Finishes clean with some residual malt flavor. Very light and tasty; a good summer session beer."
"A highly recommended summer beer. I'm not sure this beer does anything exceptionally well, but then for a summer thirst quencher it's superb. Since most lighter beers do falter I consider this to be a very fine example indeed! Seek this out in the hot months if you can get it."
"Overall this beer is pretty solid and one I would have again - worth a shot."
"Edit: The more I drink of this the less flaws I find with it and I find it to be exactly what the brewers were going for, dry with a wine like palate with some bitterness in the finish. This is one I'll definitely be coming back to in the near future. Till then the review must stand. I guess I will pick up a sixer after all. There's one for drinkability, intriguing."
"not a bad brew, probably my first kolsch but who knows"
"drinkability is perfefect for the summer - i think the germans own the summer brews light and poundable"
"Bottle from Sean9689 as part of a DLD trade. The beer is pale yellow color, very clear, with a thick slab of rocky foam that laces onto the glass. The aroma is subdued but spot on, unassuming malt with some grass or musky funk. The taste is classic kolsch, balanced between lightly toasted malt and grassy hops. Very well done, this is my style for ""sessioning", the highest possible standard of drinkability."
"D- Drinkability is moderate, not the best tasting brew but quite refreshing on a hot afternoon."
"Pretty drinkable, could knock back 3 or 4 before moving on to heavier brews. Not the best shot at this style, could use more fruittyness. One to consider on a hot Summer's day or while watching the game..."
"I really like is Kolsch offered by my local microbrewer, Schlafly. Pours light gold in color with a medium white head. Smell of malt, yeast, and cream. Taste is good, malts, yeast, and slight hops. Mouthfeel is perfect for this beer but nothing my ""ideal"" mouthfeel (ie. no 5.0), smooth, fresh, and light-medium in body. This is a great beer to enjoy during the summer months. I will def have some of this beer in the fridge to enjoy over the upcoming months."
"D - A good, but slightly boring Kolsch (not a style known for complexity anyhow). I could drink a million of these. I would buy something like this if I planned on drinking more than three or four beers... like at a wedding or a lake party. This is way better than a macro lager, but mild and bland enough to toss back with a quickness."
"D - This is a decent enough Kolsch. Having visited Cologne though, I'm ruined on this style as very little I've had in the States matches up to what I remember."
"This beer has a gold body with lots carbonation. It has an off white creamy head that has a lot of staying power. Not much lace. The body is transparent around the sides but hazy towards the middle. It has crisp hoppy aroma with a hint of malt. It has a very clean well balanced taste more bitter than sweet but in a good way. The feel is light with some carbonation bite. All in all I thought this was a great beer."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into my Boulevard Smokestack goblet. This beer pours a light, pale lemon with a little bit of a head and leaves just a bit of lacing. The aroma is mildly sweet and a bit grainy with just a kiss of hops at the finish. The taste follows suit. There really isn't too much to it. It is just blindly sweet with nothing really to it. The mouthfeel is light and crisp, making for a good summertime beer like the label implies but I've had much better Kolsch's and I think I would rather have one of those then this one."
"The taste is also very subtle. At first it is very dry and I was worried that it was too light. It finishes very nicely though and leaves a faint pleasant hoppiness on the tongue."
"Overall a pretty tasty refeshing beer. Can't say that I would ever buy for home but worth 2 bucks from a diner."
"Poured 12 oz bottle into pint glass. Beautiful golden color. Little to no head and zero lacing. Nice, lightly fruity flavor with semi-dry finish. Perfect amount of carbonation. Very drinkable; especially on a hot summer day. This is an excellent American version of this style."
"D- A wonderfully refreshing brew, great on a hot day. This is a beer a BMC drinker would enjoy as well."
"D: Goes down super easy. A pleasing brew overall."
"This is a very drinkable summer beer. I actually liked it more as it warmed up a tad. Would gladly try this again."
"Oh and one last note. For those of my fellow St. Louisans who are upset by the takeover of AB by InBev, do yourself a favor and check out Schalfly, go to their taphouse or their bottleworks and sample their offerings. They have special events at these places too, such as live local music and even movie nights...they showed the Texas Chainsaw Massacre one night a few years back for god's sake. Support a local St. Louis institution."
"This is the perfect summer beer. It is very light and refeshing but has a great malt flavor that is hits your mouth as you swallow. typically i prefer lagers and pilsners when out in the sun however they feel more bland. easily one of my favorite summers brews."
"Just about everything I look for in a Kolsch."
"D - at 4.5% abv this is an excellent drinking and refreshing summer beer."
"Drinkability is fairly high as the alcohol is low, flavor is decent."
"Like most of the Schlafly beers I've had, this one is nice and solid though it won't knock your socks off."
"This is quite good. Schlafly's standard offerings are usually hit and miss with me. This is a hit--not one to knock off the socks, but certainly a good, flavorful, but still somewhat light, Summer Kolsch. Recommended."
"This is very easy to drink and goes down like water...could drink a lot of these on a hot day playing horse shoes. I'll have to wait until it warms up a bit more to drink the rest of these..."
"Light medium gold pour with lasting bright white head. Smell is a light grassy, grainy, corn, and honey smell. Taste is like a hearty corn, honey, grain sweetness with a good crisp carbonation. A tad watery in the middle, but finishes nicely with a good short staying pale malty and honey like sweetness. Very tasty, refreshing, and easy drinking like most kolsches, but also quite simple. Scored it high, because it definitely left me wanting another one."
"Saint Louis Brewery has done a good job with Schlafly Kolsch. Maybe I'm making too much of it, but I'm doubly impressed given the intended season of consumption and the actual season of consumption. If these guys distributed to Iowa (why the hell not?), I could go for a sixer or two every summer."
"Glad I picked up a 6-er, even though it is October, and time for me to hit more dopples, and dunkels, will for sure re-visit this in the summer. Might be the perfect lawn beer for me. Tasty, smooth, and refreshing."
"D: Tasty, clean and satisfying. A perfectly 'summery' lager that is a pleasure to drink. Nothing outstanding, but one I'd certainly have again."
"don't have a lot of experience with german kolsch but this seems pretty good for an american approximation. fresh-tasting and lively, dry and refreshing though not particularly hoppy. nice."
"Very light yellow beer with a bit of amber in the color. Head bubbled up very high--over in fact, and hung in nicely with a bit of lace. Nose is good--light spice over light malt, and the taste is smooth, unoffensive with just a hint of apple-ish malt and spice. Body is light, but not too light for the style. Overall, a pretty good kolsch and a refreshing beer. Not my favorite style but a good interpretation, and an excellent beer to start someone new on."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a slight creaminess. Good steady carbonation. This is an easy drinking summer beer that I could enjoy in larger quantities. Overall, I found this an enjoyable brew and I'd have it again if the chance arises."
"A nice beer with a light, sweet character, and fairly clean. However, a Kolsch-style beer is more demanding. The beer's attempt to measure up falls a bit short. The color is a medium straw color with brilliant clarity. A somewhat-fizzy carbonation settles into a trace of bleach-white head retention. Aromas of sweet pilsner malts with a rich, earthy note and a moderate grain scent remains clean, but not Kolsch-clean. Tastes sweeter than expected with light vegetal flavors (corn and cereal grains), and moderate pilsner maltiness. Hop flavor is light with a bitterness that struggles to balance the sweetness. Light fruitiness shakes the vegetal flavors late into the finish and takes on pear, apple, and a light cider flavor. The texture is quite round and full for the style, but may sacrifice cleanliness and crispness. A light dryness and a slick texture wraps up the tail-end of the experience. Nice, but may fare better as a Blonde Ale."
"Mouthfeel was smooth with some finishing bite. Dry and palate cleansing. Very enjoyable. Highly drinkable."
"Thanks, Vancer, for the opportunity"
"Taste is initially of fresh grain quickly giving way to some lemon flavor along with a bit of fruitiness and then some sweet malt. The hops are spicy. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied and a bit dry in the finish. An easy drinker for the warm months. Picked this up in a Schlalfy sampler 12 pack on sale for just under ten bucks along with the Hefe and Pale Ale, a good value and some more summer drinking beers. Overall a solid Kolsch that I like to pick up a couple times in the summer."
"D - This is an okay kolsch. It just doesn't have a lot of flavor."
"This is a very relaxing beer, one that you can drink and enjoy without having to give much thought to it. This sample is about six months old and it hasn't lost anything. Still tastes fresh"
"Great tasting, and refreshing, malty with a lemon citrus, a subtle spiciness and a dryish finish, very drinkable."
"Pours a nice, crisp light golden yellow color with a fluffy white head. Good lacing in the pint glass. Nose is predominantly malty with some detectable hop presence. Notes of sweet malt, straw, and some flowery elements are here. Palate is of bready malts, wild flowery hop presence. Unchallenging, simple, and clean. The body is light, clean, and silky smooth. Finish leavs some residual hop notes. Good carbonation. A very drinkable, refreshing Kolsch from Schlafly ... this is a good beer to have on hand when you just want something straightforward and unencumbered. Also a good ale to introduce those macro lager drinkers to a wider world of beer."
"Sparkling brassy flaxen. Pours with a tall, tight bright white head that stands for a while before receding to a thin cap and leaving a few patches of light lace. The smell is spicy and grassy hops along with some nuttiness and just a touch sweet. Crisp and clean up front with a moderate amount of spicy hops. The medium malt body lends some girth and a slight nuttiness and does well to support the hops. The finish is medium in length and filled with more grassy and crisp hop notes. It sits on the back of the tongue for while. Medium body with ample carbonation, there is a light tingling. This was a crisp and refreshing easy drinker."
"12 oz bottle, a new arrival at Winetree Liquors on Washington Street in Evansville, Indiana, which recently hosted a Schlafly beer tasting. This one pours a clear, medium yellow body with a two finger head that is just slightly offwhite. Sketchy patch lacing is present. Aroma is subtle, with grassy and spicy hops and a backdrop of honey and caramel maltiness. A faint note of grainy corn is noted. Mouthfeel is light medium with crisp carbonation. Taste is subtle and well balanced, the way a good Kolsch should be. Slightly fruity, but not sweet. A bit lemony, with a mild grassy hops presence that is ideal. Very tasty and highly sessionable. One of the best of style I've sampled on this side of the Pond."
"Lite bodied - very drinkable, this one makes for a perfect summer session brew as Schlafly also bottles this one for the person on the go."
"The body is light/medium and almost creamy in the mouth. Very smooth, refreshing and easy to drink. This should be an excellent summer cooler."
"This kölsch poured a clear, golden color with creamy white foam. The smell was mildly hoppy and lightly malty. The taste was light bready malt with some floral hops and a mild hoppy bitterness. The mouthfeel was smooth and almost creamy with a nice hoppiness throughout and with medium body and good carbonation. The light hoppiness lingered in the aftertaste. This beer was very nice: smooth and very easy to drink. An enjoyable beer."
"This was a pleasant surprise. After pouring and observing the thin, clear straw appearance I was expecting it to taste similar to the Olympia I just had prior (have a problem with Olympia, do you?). The foam was thicker and lingered for a minute, so that was my first clue it wasn't Olympia. This is a very refreshing brew. Not abundant on flavor, but very crisp with a hint of fruitiness. I should've let it warm up a bit to bring out more flavor, but it's too damn drinkable to let it sit. The most distiguishing thing about Schlafly Kolsch is its dry finish. The reviewer who called this ""the Sauvignon Blanc of beers"" couldn't have nailed it better; my thoughts exactly."
"A nice end to a wonderful day."
"Bright yellowish-orange pour with a fizzy white head. Lively carbonation and great head retention all the way thru the duration of beer. Aroma was nothing great, hints of lemon and other citrus fruits but nothing more to speak of. Taste was along the same lines. Nothing stands out, but it wasn't bad. Light to medium bodied and easy on the palate. This beer could use some more ""oomph"" in my opinion."
"This was on tap at the Tap Room today and poured a clear gold with a thick cream head. The head left a white delicate lace on the side of the glass as it receded. The nose is all fruit. This is the Sauvignon Blanc of beers. Green apples, mild caramel. Taste is the apple with a little caramel and a bit of grapefruit from the hops. Light crisp mouth feel. Very drinkable. Great summer beer."
"D: Great summer time beer."
"Served on tap at the Soulard Ale House, St. Louis. Arrives in my hand with thin head atop some golden malt. A slightly sticky maltiness gives it more of an Oktoberfest feel. But theres a flavorful hop profile that gives it a nice peppery note atop a trace of citrus. Very refreshing."
"Received a 6 pack of mixed bottles from Schafly's. Nice to have ""Brewed with Love on .. Aug. 4, 04"" date to know freshness of beer. Pours a light golden color, very clear, not much head to speak of. Citrus and some floral smell. Crisp and refreshing, medium body with a touch of lemon. Dry, clean finish. Good summer offering."
"Pours a crystal clear yellow with a large snow white head. Teeny tinu bubbles hang around to make a nice sheet of lace. Smells quite grassy with a little pine in there for good measure. Taste wise it's a lively little kolsch. Nice citrus foreground with a moderate resin tang to it. Mouthfeel is moderately watery, but that's the style. Very drinkable while sitting out back enjoying the early autumn sun,"
"This is a nice brew, and surprisingly tasty as this style normally is not exciting for me. If in St. Louis in summer definitely check this out!"
"When poured into my glass, this beer poured virtually no head with fine sized bubbles that quickly dissipated.The body was clear and uncarbonated with a yellow hue.The nose was malty and hoppy with a medium bitter flavor.The mouthfeel was tingly and for the most part it was smooth."
"The nose is mostly of malt, perhaps a bit of fruit notes. The aroma is light overall and probably in line with the style. The taste is light and refreshing, clean and bright, a nice refreshing summer brew. A clean crips feel finishes nicely and makes this a very nice choice."
"Picked thisone up on vacation, and sure glad I did. It poured a clear straw gold with a nice frothy, small bubbled white head that maintained itself well. Lace was short lived and spotty. Carbination as well as the body are medium. Taste is crisp sweet malt with a slight hop back-up. The mouth is left alittle tart but smooth hop oil feel coats with just a hint of bitter. The bottle quotes, "" a well balanced mild mannered ale"". I say, ""yes indeed"". When im in Missouri, ""Show me the Schlafly""!!"
"Clear bright golden color with a small white frothy head that doesn't last long. Bready and flowery aroma, has a light bready, grainy flavor, it is light bodied with somewhat of a thin yet crisp mouthfeel, finishes dry and crisp, very nice summer brew."
"Drinkability: Very good. This is a fantastic summer beer to kick back and relax with when a pilsner is simply not enough. Schlafly's version is sooo much better on draft than in the bottle. Good stuff here!"
"Had to confirm that my recollection of the draft version was correct, after having a disappointing bottle experience. This is about ten times better than the bottle! Color is touch lighter than the bottle, with a nice third-inch head that stuck it out through the whole pint. Soaring candied-citrus nose with an underlying malty crunchiness. Light and tingly on the palate with the citrus outshining the malt. Goes down really easily. Loses some points in my book for being a bit out of style, with too much citrus, and slightly higher carbonation than I'd expect in a Kolsch, but a damn tasty summer beer."
"Sampled at the Schlafly Tap Room at the St. Louis Airport. Light gold, fine sticky head. Decent Kolsch flavor with a crackery malt, very similar to Sam Adams' Spring Ale. The hops lack attack and could be emphasized better, but they lend a very clean taste. There is a tangy lingering aftertaste, but the beer was initially served very cold and was at its best at this temperature. As it warmed, it became metallic. Certainly ok all in all, but not fantastic."
