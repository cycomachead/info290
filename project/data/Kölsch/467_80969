The aroma is of herbal, spicy hops with an underlying breadiness. It is rather weak though, and I have to try really hard to detect it. The taste is similar to the aroma with a nice balance of bready malt, and spicy, herbal hops. Again, like the aroma, it is weak even for the style. The mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium bodied with lively carbonation, and a smooth texture. Overall, I really don't think highly of this beer. I'm a big fan of the Kolsch style. However, this is a weaker example of the style, I can't see myself drinking again.","KarlHungus","Jun 23, 2012"

3.95,10,4,4,4,3.5,4,"overall i would say that summit has hit upon something good here, after messing around with the hefe and scandia. not sure where this rates compared to those two, but the ultimate comparison will be to see how this stands up to the schell zommerfest as go to summer slammers for my drinking pleasure. stay tuned...","budgood1","Jun 05, 2012"

4.2,17,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Overall this is not as good as the Unchained Kolsch that came out a few years back but that was a truly elite offering. This is definitely solid and will be a nice summer beer. I plan on doing a blind taster with this and four other Kolschs to see how it stands... Schells Zommerfest,Alaskan Summer, and Goose Island Summer. Right now I would say that matchup is a toss up with perhaps a slight edge to GI...we'll see...may update this when I do that.","ZAP","May 26, 2012"

4,11.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Enjoyable summer brew that is different from boring hot weather beers. I did not enjoy it as much as the Unchained Kolsch from a couple years ago, but being produced on a larger scale, I understand that compromises had to be made.","morimech","May 20, 2012"

4.4,22.6,4,4,4.5,5,4.5,"Notes: Light in body, with subtle flavor and great balance. Glad they decided to try something different this Summer. Quite tasty, and very easy to drink. A textbook example of the style. Well done!","WYVYRN527","May 17, 2012"
4,11.4,4,4,4,4,4,"O- Overall, a nice kolsch. Very reminiscent of the german kolsch's I've had in the past in the mineral taste. I look forward to having more of this during the summer.","Greggy","May 17, 2012"

4.26,18.7,5,4,4,5,4.5,"Clear, pale gold colour. Lasting, sticky head. Fresh bread, honey, hay and flowers in the nose, very gentle. Crisp flavour. A bit of soft, grainy malt up front is followed by an intising, floral/haylike hop character. Noticeable hop bitterness for a dry, curt finish. Carbonation is prickly, but not overdone. Sub 5% abv makes this a beer you can reasonabley consume in quantity. Well done. A perfect summer beer that really seems to capture the essence of the season.","mjryan","May 06, 2012"
4.67,30.1,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"O= This is a home run from Summit. A well made "summer" beer. I don't care the style or the flavor this is an all around awesome summer beer. I'll be drinking a ton of this over the summer and enjoying every last drop. Seek this beer out and enjoy the hell out of it. I know I will be.","jjanega08","May 05, 2012"
