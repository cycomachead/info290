"Fortunately, the flavor is much improved. There's some fruity sweetness to the initial taste. Light bitterness in the swallow for balance. Short aftertaste. Full bodied with a high level of carbonation."
"O: Easy to drink and very sessionable. Enjoyable and definitely one that I would grab regularly for outdoor events when it is warm out there."

"Light beer with a smooth finish. Not bad, but if you're looking for big flavor, this isn't it."
""
"Taste is golden malt with an ample black pepper hop in back for balance. Green apple sweetness.  Bit of a ‘tweener in the mouthfeel department.  Not as crisp as a kolsch but not as smooth as a golden ale.  I guess that’s why it’s a kolsch style golden ale."

"Drinks mild but provides plenty of flavor with the yeast doing much of the work while spicy hops smooth things out. Has a nice crusty bread feel I enjoy with the other flavors presented. Great in the Utah heat."

"Taste / Palate: The flavor profile is very clean and light. There is a very modest and refreshing cracker like malty base with mild lemony hop bitterness. The finish is quick and fairly dry."

"You may say I'm being to hard on this one, and it isn't horrible, but it taste like something I would drink while grilling or tailgating, and given a choice I would rather have a cheap, American light beer than this."
"Mouthfeel is medium and this leans toward an ale for a hybrid, but with higher than average carbonation. Very tasty and fairly crisp though...a great Summer beer."

"Overall way decent for a 4% Utah supermarket beer."

"Overall: A very enjoyable Kolsch. Uinta beers are always very solid and drinkable. This beer packs a pretty impressive punch for being 4% abv. Definitely recommended."

"American style Kolsch- slight darker and heavier than the classic German variety. The aroma is biscuit and hay with a slight sweetness. The beer pours a crystal clear gold with a bright white, thick head that dissipates quickly. The carbonation is noticeable on the palate. The flavor is clean and refreshing with a nice balance of malt and hops with the slightest tip towards the malt sweetness. Overall, this is certainly not a German Kolsch but is a very drinkable beer that is quite refreshing cold and becomes more complex as it warms."

"I feel like there's a good kolsch to be had here but this particular bottle at least had some off flavors going on. I'll update if I try a better one in the future."
"Overall: Refreshing, easy-drinking. Solid enough for an American-born Kölsch."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was its ease of drinkability. While the aroma and flavoring were rather simple and clean, with warmth the bitterness mixed oddly with the watered-through middle, causing the ultimate blend of flavors to become muddled and unattractive. If kept towards a colder temperature this beer can be your typical “drink from the bottle on a hot Summer’s day” type of beer, but otherwise there are more refined and flavorful beers for the style, and from this brewery."

"I had this on tap at T Brendan O'Reilly's and it was served in a pint glass. Before I knew it I had drank 75% of it and wasn't really taking notes, so here is my take on it summarized: A good Kölsch, solid, drinkable and not sweet with balance of malt and yeast with a pleasant finish and gentle toast from the malt in the flavor."

"O - I enjoy subtlely flavored beers but this one is a little too subtle for me. Pretty average across the board. Maybe I'll have to revisit it again sometime to see if I missed something."
""
""
""
"Notes: Not a bad beer at all it's rather good not over powering and it has a good dry finish also very drinkable. Cheers."
""

"This is a nice, refreshing, clean beer. It's rather malty which is its only (slight) set back. The hops are there and it is close to balanced. It's highly drinkable and definitely sessionable. It's another offering from Uinta that's worth checking out."
"Not a bad little beer, but the aroma is the high point. If I ever come across a fresher bottle, I'll revisit."
""
"Taste is nice, full fruity grain, apple, hint of faint herb and flowers, with a mostly grassy bitterness, which is light and balances the light sweetness. Overall, it's fairly dry, very minerally, crisp."
"This is a kolsch? Really? Way too far into ale territory, in my opinion. Body is quite thick, profile is quite intense, for the style. Too leafy, too earthy, and not filtered enough, I want to say. As a beer, sure it works. But this tastes like generic homebrew to me as opposed to something refined, as a kolsch should be."
""
""

""
"Overall, this is a refreshing beer and I will buy it again. Utah is strange about its liqour laws so it hinders what a REAL beer should taste like. Not the best kolsch I've had because of the strange flavor combos."
""
""
""
"A tasty session beer with a low ABV that's easy to drink and perfect for pounding or a hot day. Sweet and malty for the Kolsch style, which I found very enjoyable."
""
"Overall a decent hot weather brew, but it doesn't distinguish itself well enough for the style. For all I would know this could be some sort of pale lager. Despite it not being a great Kolsch, it's still doable."
""
""
"I'm not sure if the beer is extract brewed or not, but I can't get that taste or smell out of my head. Not the worst beer I've had, but I will not be reaching for this one again."

"O = one of the better crafted Kolsch style beers I've had. Extremely sessionable, flavorful and great for summer drinking."
""
"Light and biscuity, with a touch of grain huskiness. It does maintain a steady body throughout and a tight crispness on the end. this is a nice session beer that doulbes as a good summer ale"
"Overall, this is a nice refreshing beer and it is quite enjoyable."
"O: A nice Kolsch; good backyard / cookout / summertime brew for sure... I’ll definitely have it again!"
"nothing special here, a very standard an unexciting pale beer. pours clear and washed out yellow looking with a decent white head. smells like a beer, a bit of euro malts but nothing memorable in the nose. flavor is equally dull, its crisp and refreshing, but it doesnt taste like much. this is a style of beer that can be quite exciting when done properly, im not sure why this one is so flat. feel is fine, well carbonated and very very light on the body. i wont buy this again, not because its bad, but because its boring. i prefer the hop notch from uinta"

"I think is is a fine kolsch, which reminds me, I don't really like this style."

"Pours a slightly hazy light honey orange with a 1 inch puffy orange-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy splotches of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt/grain, white grape juice, and some nice honey aromas. Taste is of malt/grain, honey, and a grassy flavor on the finish. There is a very mild bitterness with each sip that quickly fades from the palate. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer and quite sessionable at only 4% ABV. I will keep this one in mind for summer cookouts."
"O: Not too shabby, a nice session beer that I am glad to be able to get regularly, especially once summer hits."
""
"O- Disappointing. Kolsch is my style, but every time I try a new American interpretation I'm left wondering if any of them have ever had a traditional example from Koln. Cant recall the last good one I had! Colorado Kolsch is the last one that came close"
"Clear yellow color, minimal bubbles with a couple rising to the surface. Smells sort of grainy. Flavor is grainy malt, cereals, not very crisp and not very hoppy despite what the label says. Very easy to drink though since the ABV is so low. This was a decent beer but is my least favorite for the style and I won't make a repeat purchase on this one."
"Overall just real solid, very enjoyable. Now that I see it's 4% I am getting another!"
"Overall impression: Decent light offering, good flavor but nothing interesting enough to make me want to come back for more."

"A great light beer. Such an improvement over the standard lagers. Harmon's Markets in Salt Lake have single 12 oz bottles available of a bunch of the Uinta and other local low-octane beers."
"Pours a pale gold with a big foamy white head on top. Retained well. Some lace left behind. The nose is fresh with lemon, and other zest, and the common-to-this-style aroma of cut-grass. Nice mouth. Carbonation is spot-on. Not too sprtizy. Faint lemon flavors, cracker, bread, mild hops, and a crisp, dry finish. This is a fantastic beer. I'm gonna go grab a sixer of this this weekend if it's still around."
"Light and refreshing in body and feel, not much hop presence other than a very faint hoppy taste in the back. The malts aren't sweet and have a biscuity quality to them that ends up leaving a slightly weird aftertaste and linger. Effervescent mouthfeel in its light airiness, but manages to be crisp to the tongue and a little bit prickly in carbonation. Not the best Kolsch I've had, but then again its not bad. Just nothing all that exciting about it, unlike Uinta's other low ABV selection in Baba Black Sheep. I thought that one was very unique and well done, whereas this one is a little on the bland side."
"Pours a nice clean/clear golden yellow color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy white head, with some minimal sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, sweet, with a little hop note. The taste is sweet, malty, slightly hoppy. Medium Body. A pretty tasty brew, a nice thrist quencher."
