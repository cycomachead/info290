"Great tasting ale of the style. Definitely a go to standard."

"A nice balanced beer. Toasted malted flavors permeate the beer but it's still a smooth beer that pairs well with anything. It has a sweet note but they don't linger for long."
"Overall:  this is definitely more like an American blonde ale than a KÃ¶lsch, but in either case it doesn't strongly appeal to me."

"The beer looks exactly as it's supposed to. It's not a Kolsch. It's a golden ale. If you didn't figure that out, you were already in for the wrong ride. This beer really opens up and its floral, has a great softness due to the water they use, and it has a slight sweetness and bitterness thats perfectly balanced. Overall a great beer for session or whatever. Perfect for all seasons."

"I really like this beer. Perfect beer to enjoy outside."
"O - Great Kolsch. I found it to be very easy drinking but still quite flavorful. Definately a beer one could sit down and have multiples of."

"Pours to a frothy white head and deep gold color. Aroma is grassy hops and sweet malt. Favor presents with a grainy start, biscuity, vinous middle and clean, mildly hoppy finish. Mouthfeel is light and co2is generous. had this beer on tap the night before this review and have to say on tap is definitely better. Overall, a decent Kolsch and a good crossover brew for the mid-south."
"Pours a clear, rich golden with a creamy off-white head. A light grain aroma. Taste is sweet and light caramel up front, followed by a rich cream flavor, next up is some doughy bread, and a zesty light bitter finish. Mouthfeel is good. Over a nice kolsch, I would get this again."

"Had this beer at a concert in Memphis purchased from the Brewers stand , assume that it was pretty fresh. To me this is a good night out , day at the lake, mowing the lawn kind of beer. Far better than the mass produced St Louis Swill , nothing to sit around and sip on at the house or share for a special moment , but a good summer time hot weather beer to enjoy."
"Overall, a pretty forgetable beer. Drinkability is extremely high but flavors are somewhat lacking. Not offensive but not impressive either."

"a pretty forgettable beer. I didn't even realize it was supposed to be a kolsch. It didn't really taste like one or be one"

"o - Overall a very average beer. Nose and taste and pretty bland, with some light herbal notes in the taste. Easy to drink but nothing special. Wouldn't seek it out again."
"O: It's alright and totally worth a try. It's not a bad beer by any stretch of the imagination, but there's nothing about it that made me say, ""wow!"""

"This beer strikes me as a great summer beer. The flavors and aromas aren't very bold but they aren't bad either. It's good enough for an easy drinking beer."
"O: In no way does Ghost River's Golden Ale resemble a traditional Kolsch, though it didn't prevent me from moderately enjoying it. This actually comes off like a cream ale, not too dissimilar to Sixpoint's Sweet Action. If you're looking for a reasonably flavorful craft session option, this would most likely deliver your fix."
"Light mouthfeel and very drinkable. Would be a decent summer brew."
"This beer would be great in the summertime heat."
"I think this is a good drinkable beer that has a nice sweetish malt twist. I don't think it's quite a kolsch and may be more of a blonde or even a cream ale in thinking of it. Not spectacular, maybe a good starter beer for those who might start drinking craft/imported non fizzy yellow water..."

"O- Decent summer beer. I would never order this again just to have it, but on a hot day this was alright. Very forgettable, but though it wasn't great, there werent any ridiculous flaws either..."
"D- Sessionable, to be sure, but this beer needs a little bit of polishing."
"Pours a clear, golden color. 1/3 inch head of a white color. Great retention and slight lacing. Smells of yeast, sweet malt, grain, and slight hops. Fits the style of a Kolsch. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, slight citrus hops, hint of wheat, and grain. Overall, average Kolsch, at best."
"Appearance is cloudy, carbonated yellow with a white head that didn't last long. The smell was bitter, earthy, and woody. The taste was carbonated and crisp, but very dry and bitter in the finish. Nice medium body on the palate, but not enough flavor for me to session."
"This beer is very light and dry. While it has a nice crispness to it, the flavor is a little underwhelming for my taste. Slightly sweet, it is a nice summer beer for those who like things on the lighter side."
"Light malt in the aroma with a hint of roasted nut. The nut came through in the quaff nicely, mixing well with a woody resin and a touch of caramel. Well balanced with the hops in the finish, I was pleased with this brew and would look for it again, in the bottle for some summer STL quaffing"
