4,-3.6,4.5,3.75,4,4.25,4,"Poured from a 22 oz bomber in to a tall fluted pilsner glass. Pale and straw yellow with exceptional clarity and copious amounts of active carbonation. Like watching the aerator in a golden-lit fish tank. Kind of mesmerizing. There's a nice crown of soft white foam with impressive staying power and scalloped ridges. A very lovely appearance. The aroma is soft and floral. If a beer could smell graceful, this would be the one. The taste brings a mild honey sweetness with subtle, balanced, flowery hops. The woody finish is clean and neat with just a suggestion of dinner roll bread flavor. The spritzy, biting carbonation makes the beer quenching, while the balanced body adds to the refreshment. This is the best Kolsch I've had to date. It's simple, delicious, measured, and crisp. It just hits all the right spots. I was ready to resign the Kolsch category to a poor lager imitation, but this one has renewed my hopes that there are world class varieties out there worth the distinction.","JohnnyI","Jan 16, 2015"

In the beginning, unknown citrus flavors give way to bread, hay, and ultimately hop bitterness rounding out the finish. Good bready malts, crackers, and herbal notes with a complimentary dryness expected with the style. Light bodied, well carbonated and smooth. Overall, this is a high quality Kolsch from South Carolina brewery COAST, better than many imports. Thanks to ""Oneeye"" for bringing back a bottle from the Piggily Wiggily in Surfside Beach, SC, all the way to PA.","Stinkypuss","0"

4.05,-2.4,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Served from tap into a Foothills shaker. Poured a hazy straw yellow with a half finger pure white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, banana, fruit, rye, and grain. The flavor was of sweet malt, gain, fruit, banana, subtle spices, and rye. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. I had just recently had a bottle of this one that was aged and I have to say that I enjoyed the aged version better than this one. While this one was still pretty good, the rye component as I saw it was a little strong and covered up a lot of the more mellow flavors going on here. If this would not have been the case it would have definitely received higher marks as the bottle did. Still a very solid offering from COAST that everyone should try at least once.","thagr81us","Oct 11, 2011"

4.39,5.8,3,4,5,3.5,4.5,"A hazy straw yellow pour with a white bubbly head, this beer looks more like a Belgian White Ale than a Kolsch, but it still looks tasty. High marks all around for the classic sulfer-y Kolsch aroma and grassy-floral hops. Clean is the key to a successful Kolsch, and COAST has clean nailed. It manages to be both delicate and flavorful. Exceptional! There is an unadulterated sulfer-and-sweet wheat and honey flavor that draws me back and back and back again for more. I wonder how ""to-style"" this is for a Kolsch given the appearance and wheat addition; if anything, it is an improvement on the style! I initially had some problems with carbonation, and found the excessive bubbles off-putting, but with time the problem subsided. I'd buy a case of this if it was available locally.","dnrobert24","0"

It featured the citrus like yeasty flavor with a slight sourness to it. It was superb. The beer was very, very light, almost like a pale pale wheat.

Mildly fruity and honey-like in the mid-palate, my first few sips have a slight butteriness that decreases as it breathes. Hop character is light, a blend of delicate spices and a little citrus-like, more an herbal citrus rather than a fruity citrus. Light in body with moderate carbonation, this beer does feel a little slick on the palate. That slickness, along with the mild astringency, takes away from the beer.

There is some nice herbal hop character hinted at in the aroma, but it fails to follow through in the flavor. There is a good balance between the very light malt and the fleeting hop flavor and bitterness, but both could stand to be turned up a bit. This isn't a bad beer, but I think they have erred on the light side of the Kolsch style. This is more of a blonde or cream ale, it would need a bit more malt and hop presence to make it a Kolsch.","nickfl","Apr 10, 2010"

Taste is of light malted grains / bread crust with a touch of grassy hops... finishes with a nice bit of sweetness followed by a well balanced bite. Also, a little fruity / estery-ness in there.

Clean, grassy finish with a well-crafted bitterness and a trace of mineral water and white wine spritzers. Mouthfeel is exceptionally light on the palate, with a brisk, bubbling carbonation level.

Growler from the Charleston Beer Exchange. Pours a classic light golden with good clarity. The head is somewhat slight, but the carbonation is fine and I'll chalk that up to the growler. The smell is rounded rather than crisp with an almost nutty aroma of lager yeast and some gentle hops. The taste is also rounded, with a bit of butteriness and some lager yeast up front, but with a refreshing noble hop crispness that is long and refreshing. Really nice lingering bitterness makes this quite satisfying and makes it feel a bit more full bodied than it really is. Becomes more delicious with every sip.

Thank you Jamie and David for brewing such a wonderful ale. This is the kind of thing that can break a market wide open.","mikesgroove","Jun 08, 2008"
