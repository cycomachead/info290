"Real interesting beer, probably not what I want in a Kolsch, but it's a real interesting style a mix of light kolsch and sweet dark caramel flavors."
""
""
""
"OVERALL: Hard to categorize, this Kmita Kolsch is fairly tasty, and blindfolded I would have sworn this was imported. An odd ball beer, I kind of like it, but I really would look elsewhere for a clean example of the style."
""
"O - I'm not quite sure what a ""Polish Style Kölsch Ale"" is but this beer doesn't measure up to what a Kölsch should be if styles are considered. By no means is it a bad product, in fact, Kmita Kölsch is a very well-made beer, it just doesn't fit guidelines. I'd love to know the story behind this beer; I feel that it might make the experience make a little more sense. In the end Kmita Kölsch is drinkable but not as drinkable as a typical Kölsch."

"I have no idea what a Polish kölsch is supposed to be like, but this is the darkest kolsch I have ever seen. Most brown ales aren't this dark. Super malty nose and tons on the flavor as well. Smooth feel, but quite thick. This is not really a kölsch so far as I am familiar with. Nice drinker but well outside the style parameters."
"I remember being so perplexed by the concept of a ""Polish-style kolsch"" this past summer that I ran out to the Whole Foods in Lincoln Park and grabbed a pint at their bar. Good times. Let's have another, shall we? This stuff pours a partly hazy copper-amber topped by a finger of glowing off-cream-white foam. The nose comprises toasted and buttery biscuit, candied orange zest, and a hint of fennel. The taste holds notes of tangelo zest, orange peel, light black pepper, toasted biscuit, and a dash of nutmeg. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a creamily drying finish. Overall, a tasty interpretation of a kolsch, even if it bears only a small resemblance to the base style."

"The fruity flavor is overwhelming. Review is not based on style, but personal preference."
"Overall – I was a little leery seeing a can of Carling Black Label on the label. A solid beer. This is not what I feel a traditional klosch beer should be like but then again, they are claiming it is a Polish klosch so who am I to argue. I would buy this one again but since it is on a rotating basis who knows when I will see it again."

"Overall not good. Like a somewhat inexperienced homebrewer making some mistakes, and nothing what I would expect for a Kolsch."
""
""
""
"Overall, an interesting take on a kolsch, as I mentioned more of belgian/french amber flavor profile with kolsch yeast flavoring and drying presence in the mouth."
""
"O: This beer is quite unlike any other kölsch I've had before, especially in its appearance and amount of malts and dryness. It's also not very easy to drink."
""
"Overall / Drinkability: An unusual contrast of flavors in this beer. Not like any kolsch I've had before. Glad I tried, but I could not see myself having very many glasses of this in a sitting. Drinkability leaves a bit to be desired, but definitely worth a try."
"I think Dark Horse is a great brewery in general, but it really swings on the spectrum with their beers. This is on the lower end."

"A very easy-drinking and refreshing pour. I'm not sure how authentic this is to the style (it's so dark it doesn't resemble any Kolsh I've had), but it's quality is beyond dispute."
"Poured weirdly. I didn't manage to break up the flocks into finer light reflecting things, and it was darker than the few of the style I've had and it seemed a bit not cool and not inviting and like I said, weird. I get malt and biscuit and a bit of ripe fruit and maybe some floral notes. Again. A Kolsch? Tastes actually ok average, or even maybe a bit better. Not undrinkable for sure, but I really don't have much positive to say about this., sorry, loving DH brews and all. I wonder if the Polish has something to do with this?"
""
"I don't recommend this, my first ""don't buy"" comment on a Dark Horse beer."
"This beer wasn't awful, but it wasn't very good, either. And I don't understand how this can be labeled as a Kolsch. It resembles a Kolsch in almost no way. Is Dark Horse trying to play a joke on us? I'll be sure to pass this one up next time."
"Tastes a little fruity and toasty with a gently bitter aftertaste. If I had this blindfolded I'd say it was Bells Amber (a great beer). Dried fruit and light toasty malt flavors. Light feel, smooth and flavorful. It's a good beer, regardless of style. Craft beer is about bending rigid styles anyway..."
"Dark Horse could convince me that Kmita is a cream ale, an amber ale, or even a non-descript pale ale. But it's not a very good beer, and certainly not a well made kolsch."
"If you're reading this over at DH, please note that I'm trying to offer some honest feedback, and you can see from my other reviews that I admire your work."

"Pours a hazy orange-ish to amber color with a light tan head. In the aroma, faint lager notes, yet quite fresh. In the taste, small caramel notes, quite similar to a Vienna lager. Quite smooth and a medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a small dryness and light caramel roast in the aftertaste. It was more a Vienna lager than a kolsch, but it was enjoyable nonetheless."
""

"Notes: Well it's not to bad. The light dry finish does add a nice touch. Cheers."
"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, no bottle dating. Pours cloudy orange amber color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Some light spotty lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of apples, pear, caramel, toast, bread, herbal, floral, grass, and light earth. Ok aromas but they were fairly weak and unbalanced; possible fermentation issues due to apple in aromas. Taste of pear, caramel, toast, biscuit, grass, floral, apple, and light herbal spiciness. Light spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruit, caramel, toast, biscuit, grass, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a short bit. Fairly dry on the finish. Pretty good flavor balance and complexity; no cloying sweetness. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and slightly crisp mouthfeel that is ok. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Very easy to drink as expected. Overall this is an ok brew. Definitely not a kolsch, but has some decent flavor and balance. Pretty enjoyable."
"Not very refreshing. Not very Kolsch-y. Not very good. In the future I'll avoid this one like it was made by White Birch."
"O-As the beer warms the flavors no longer mix as well and the buttery/bread notes take over and worsen the beer."

"O- It's noting like a traditional koelsch, making it somewhat difficult to judge on A,S,T,D ratings. Maybe the ""Polish Kolsch"" is meant as a joke? That said, it's a really drinkable beer. Full flavored while keeping a refreshing quality. One of the funniest labels I've seen in a while."
"Very malty bread crust and cracker malt plus some gritty dryness from the malt and grassy, earthy, Polish hops. Sweet, dry, and easy to drink."
""
"What's the deal with this beer? It drinks much better than I was expecting, but it's not much of a kolsch (and I'm dinging it for style). There are far worse beers to drink, but I wouldn't seek this out."
""
"A decent beer but nothing like any kolsch I have ever had. Is more like an Amber. Nonetheless, not something I would really seek out again."
""
"12oz bottle, pours a ruddy amber color, with a very thin head that dissipates to nothing very quickly. I was expecting a golden color for the style. Aromas are malty grain, caramel, slightly medicinal. Tastes are again malty, with grain, caramel, slight spice, slightly medicinal. Would pair well with a spicy sausage. Mouth-feel is on the thinner side of medium, decent carbonation. Overall, I found this to be weird. I've never heard of a Polish Kolsch, but for a German Kolsch this was way off the mark for the style. Polish amber might have been received better. Sorry, passing on this one."
"Overall I thought that this was a decent beer, but it wasn't a good example of the style, there weren't that many things about this beer that shouted Kolsch, it would be better if it was just called Polish Ale and they left out the word Kolsch. This beer didn't have the best drinkability, it wasn't that smooth and the flavors don't hold my interest as well as they should, one is enough for me. What I liked most about this beer was that the taste actually had something that resembled a Kolsch unlike most of this beer. What I liked least about this beer was how confusing it was, this beer just didn't seem to be that cohesive. I don't think I would buy this beer again, it was interesting to try, but nothing I feel like I have to try, it's worth a try but don't expect a classic Kolsch. All in all this was one confusing beer that I really don't understand, but I do appreciate how different this beer is, it's always nice when the guys at Dark Horse start thinking out box, but unfortunately it just doesn't come together as well as it should."

"This beer pours a cloudy light amber color with a small white head that vanishes within seconds. It is very unappealing to look at. The aroma is of toffee, caramel, and a hint of roasted malt. It is a pleasant aroma, but is in no way the aroma of a kolsch. The taste is similar to the aroma with a lingering bitterness in the finish. Again, it is actually quite enjoyable, but it is not a kolsch. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with virtually no carbonation. Overall, when I see a style designation on a beer's label I expect it to at least vaguely represent that style. I have no idea what a ""Polish Kolsch"" is supposed to taste like, but I thought it was reasonable to expect something similar to a real kolsch. This beer tastes much more like an altbier than a kolsch."

"The label is a nice tribute to family heritage. Overall, very well done and I hope it becomes available year-round."
"This is a strange muddled beer to say the least. I know it is their version of a kolsch, but there is little in this beer that even remotly reminds me of a kolsch. Perhaps they messed up brewing a real kolsch and felt bad about dumping this mess and so decided to label it a polish Kolsch. A properly brewed Kolsch is anything but boring. This contrasts to what was written on their six pack. I will not be buying this again."
"Overall Dark Horse did pretty good at creating a style of it's own. For what it's worth the Kolsch is clean and the added tastes are pretty interesting. Still it doesn't hold my interest to gain a repeated purchase."
""
"Strange Kolsch. Hoppy, bitter, toasty, dark, and strong. Maybe if it was a pale ale. 2.5"
""
"O - More malt, spice and citrus flavor than I expected. My buddy and I, kept commenting on how good it tasted. Worth seeking out."
"Certainly an odd beer and not like anything else I've tried. There are some distinct German (maybe Polish?) notes, but overall it's a well-balanced, drinkable amber."
"Kmita pours out Kolsch like with a bronzish brown with a tint of orange up to light. A nice amount of rising bubbles, An off white head that lasts till the end with minimal lacing on the sides. BOdy looks a tad bigger and darker in color than most in the style. Smell is caramel forward with some light floral and pale malt. Sweeter with warming drink this up quick. Taste is refreshing, this bottle is super fresh and this particular Kolsch delves into amber ale territory. Light flavor with a caramel backing. An earthy hop flavor at this fresh stage. This is just a bit bigger in all aspects than most Kolsch beer and I like the twist. Feel is light with a sparky carb and a refreshing quick finish. Glad to see new Dark Horse product in the area. I am going to come back to this."
"Lighter medium body, well carbonated, crisp and smooth on the palate. This is a really nice quaffer - perfect for the summer and well balanced."
"Love the label,being a Polack from Michigan who's grandfather drank Carlings Black Label in the red can I can appreciate the label.True to the label this is nowhere near a German Kolsch it pours more of a burnt orange color with a thinner white head atop.Aromas are much more to style with lightly toasted grain and some mild floral hops.the flavors are not as delicate as the style goes but I really like them with some lightly toasted grain,light fruit,and quite a shot of leafy hops in the back end,it's pretty refreshing like a true Kolsch.It's different and the meaning behind the beer is pretty cool,something to drink while grilling or watching a game."

"This is very simple, but very nice. Pretty much spot on for the style. Something I really enjoyed and would recommend."
"O: A nice lighter beer."
