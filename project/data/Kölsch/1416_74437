The beer pours a crystal clear gold with a bright white, thick head that dissipates quickly. The carbonation is noticeable on the palate. The flavor is clean and refreshing with a nice balance of malt and hops with the slightest tip towards the malt sweetness. Overall, this is certainly not a German Kolsch but is a very drinkable beer that is quite refreshing cold and becomes more complex as it warms.","JeffH","Jun 27, 2013"

While the aroma and flavoring were rather simple and clean, with warmth the bitterness mixed oddly with the watered-through middle, causing the ultimate blend of flavors to become muddled and unattractive. If kept towards a colder temperature this beer can be your typical “drink from the bottle on a hot Summer’s day” type of beer, but otherwise there are more refined and flavorful beers for the style, and from this brewery.","TheBrewo","Apr 05, 2013"

Effervescent mouthfeel in its light airiness, but manages to be crisp to the tongue and a little bit prickly in carbonation. Not the best Kolsch I've had, but then again its not bad. Just nothing all that exciting about it, unlike Uinta's other low ABV selection in Baba Black Sheep.
