3.51,-1.7,3.5,3,3.75,3.75,3.5,"The pour is light gold with a big, rocky head that quickly dissipates to a ring around the edge. Good carbonation, very clear. Not much aroma, a very light, hoppy, malty scent, not unpleasant. The taste is rich, but not overwhelming. It's nice, sweet, mixed with bitter and lightly hoppy. Hard to get a fix on it, but not unpleasant. Light to moderate on the tongue with a little buzz from the carbonation with a clean finish. Overall, it's pleasant without being a palate wrecker, perfect for summer evenings on the porch with grilled shrimp and a Caesar salad. The taste isn't so strong that it will overpower delicate flavors like fish and shellfish, nor will the alcohol knock you on your tush, either. It does have flavor, though, which puts it head and shoulders above run-of-the-mill adjuncts. It's very good, but not great.","mnredsoxfan69","May 10, 2014"

3.8,6.4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Part Three of my six-part intro to the brewery. It pours a clear pale straw topped by a finger of dirty white foam. The nose comprises light lemon zest, light orange zest, very light wheat, and a tiny peck-on-the-cheek of sweet flowers. Yeah, it's all pretty weak, but it works here. The taste follows pretty closely, though the power missing from the aroma has shown up here in spades. The emphasis is on the lemon, with some cardamom tossed in for good measure. The body is a hefty light, with a moderate carbonation and a rather fluid feel. Overall, this was a surprisingly enjoyable kolsch. It's nothing overtly spectacular, but more than tasty enough for one of those hot summer days we all try to remember in these cold times (well, I mean, I kinda enjoy the colder months, but you get where I'm coming from here, right?).","TMoney2591","Dec 03, 2011"

The head is one finger in height and recedes very quickly into almost no lacing. The aroma, like all of Schell's beers, is of simple caramel malt and nothing else. The malt persists into the taste, but is toned down a bit, and some yeast does come through. The mouthfeel is light bodied with a lot of carbonation which seems to take away from the taste. Overall, this is another disappointment from August Schell Brewing Company.","KarlHungus","Aug 26, 2006"
2.8,-21.6,4,4,2,4,2,"My great anticipation for this excellently named beer stopped at the massive malt barrier reef which encompasses most of the taste. In fact it's like pushing the dough-boys stomach in with your tongue trying to get through the not so sour doughiness. As for it being a summery beer, it mostly fails. It's not very crisp or refreshing. It rather feels like a humid July day where it's overcast and threatens to bring relief and the clouds build but the rains never come.

Aroma is lemony with a grapenut aspect and a bit of spice, but I don't think spices were added. Taste begins with a malty spice flavor. Quite smooth. Sweetened barley flavors show themselves. A citric aspect comes in and shuts down the sweetness while leaving the crisp malty flavors. A nice little hoppy kick comes in the finish. Ends not sweet nor dry but moreso crisp than anything. Lighter body excels with the solid moderate carbonation. Easy drinking with just enough flavor and complexity to keep my interest piqued. Enjoyable.","granger10","May 12, 2006"

It tasted very refreshing and had very mild flavors such as grain, wheat, lemon, and some hop. This was a very clean and crisp tasting beer that was very refreshing and tasted great right after a long day at work. While I have had better beers I really enjoy this beer because of its simplicity and modest taste. Its just a simple and easy beer complimented with great taste that I enjoy quite often.","ryantupy","Apr 13, 2005"

This beer is smooth and creamy up front, but then moves to a nice sharp biting middle section and finish. This beer is quite crisp and refreshing, it is lightly sweet, but well balanced by a hoppy bite. The hops are nicely present here (perhaps a bit too much for a traditional Kolsch, but I like it even more for it), and give a light lemon-like notes, as well as a grassy herbal character that is quite pleasing. I am enjoying this beer a lot more than I thought I would, cheers to hops.","Gueuzedude","Oct 11, 2004"

Mouthfeel is okay, goes down alright, but could use some more carbonation. , and drinkability is even a bit better. Drinkability is good, high session factor with this one.

I began by chilling in the cooler full of ice, popped the lid off, smelling at first of the pale ale I just had about an hour before with more of a cool sensation. Taste was very good, finding a very pleasant mildness which i didn't expect since i have never tried any kolsch style ale before, so I would expect a hoppy and, bitter finish however, it was smooth as silk. Mouthfeel was nice and. fluffy with little below perfect carbonation.

Aroma: Zesty lemon with grassy wheat notes not bad at all with definite evident honey fruit tones in their and an herbal hop profile making for an interesting golden brew. Taste: A bit grassy in the malts sweetness a tart lemon zing but mellow overall one of the more flavorful brews from August Schell though I enjoy this brew not a bad one at all picked it up for $0.99 can't complain. Mouthfeel is medium with a slightly sticky watered down honey texture very nice. I could make this a lawnmower beer without a doubt, what a great find at a very affordable price.","WVbeergeek","Aug 19, 2003"
4.03,12.9,4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"A rough pour delivers a slightly hazy golden body that's topped by a full head of frothy bright-white foam which holds well and initially leaves some very nice lace. The nose delivers a welcoming combination of bready Munich malt and citrusy (light lemon) and grassy hops. The body is medium/light and it's fine carbonation delicately caresses the tongue before leaving it just slightly creamy in the mouth. The flavor delivers bready and lightly toasted Munich malts up-front; followed by a flash of citrusy hops and a rising, bold bitterness; and then a more wheat-like malt and grassy hops in the dry finish. It's a surprisingly flavorful and complex beer; although it's far from what I'd expect from an authentic version from Koln or the Bonn region. Very nice!","NeroFiddled","Sep 23, 2002"

The taste was citrusy sweet as well, with a mostly lemon character.  There was a slight acidity to both the smell and taste that I did not care for, but I have little experience in the Kolsch category to judge this by.  The mouthfeel is good with a smooth, long lasting flavor.  This refreshing beer is light and very drinkable.","ryanocerus","Aug 07, 2002"
3.97,11.2,4,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Clear darker yellow, very pale head that settles at 1/4 of an inch.  Distinctive aroma from Kolsch yeast, bread and a touch of olive oil.  Very subdued flavor, just a touch of ester and powdered sugar.  Hops (Vanguard) are absolutely minimal until just a last slightly bitter catch close to the swallow.  This is a great quencher, but as with a lot of Kolsch-styles and other Summer beers -- they set me in the mood for the beers of Fall and Winter.","ADR","Jun 22, 2002"

A spicey hop laden malt aroma.  Not too bad.  This is a pretty decent tasting beer, but it almost tastes more like a pilsner than a kolsch.  I don't get a lot of the fruitiness that is usually associated with Kolsch, but I do get a bit more bitterness than a typical Kolsch has.  Pretty nice blend of pale, munich and wheat malt.  Good maltiness with a hop bite.  Nice summer brew.","Bighuge","Beers"
4.08,14.3,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Big frothy head.  Pale straw color and clear.  Light clean aroma, more malt than hops.  Nice soft ale quality to taste and mouthfeel.  Has Schell's typical richness, but not heavy.  Smooth malt taste backed by bitterness that closes the sip. Neither is excessive or overwhelming.  Enjoyable summer beer, without the crispness of lager.","garymuchow","0"
