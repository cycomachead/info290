"Not a very good Kölsch. As a homebrew judge, I have seen a few homebrews in the style with the same problems, it seems quite hard to make a good Kölsch."

"I know this beer's from Massachusetts, but it reminds me of the whole Chesapeake scene. (You've gotta give me some leeway here, I'm from the Midwest...) Anyway, this stuff pours a mostly clear brass topped by a half-finger of relatively short-lived off-white foam. The nose comprises mild white bread, slight melon, flowers, and a bit of lemon zest. The taste brings in more of the same, the bread enveloping the melon/lemon mixture while flowers rain down upon the proceedings. The body straddles the border between hefty light and light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid, nearly slick feel. Overall, a nice-enough kolsch, one that embraces the subtlety of the style, but one that stills leaves me wanting a bit."

"From the 12 fl. oz bottle. Sampled July 7, 2012. The pour is a hazy pale yellow with a quick fizzy white head that fades immediately. The aroma is of grains with a crisp hop note but the bottle I got must have been skunked because I also got a of that on the nose. Light body. The taste has all the right characteristics of a Kolsch with grains and a moderate bitterness but the skunked character distorted my judgement."

"Served on tap at Latitude 43 in Gloucester. Presented in a standard pint glass. Hazy orange colored body. No real head. Moderate carbonation though. Smell was pretty unremarkable; nothing too noticeable. Taste was good. Just a hint of malt and hops, so it's a very light tasting beer. That's the standard idea of a Kölsch, to not overwhelm you with anything, and that's what you get. It's a very mild flavored, easy drinking beer. It may not be the best example of the style, but if you are looking for a smooth beer with relatively low abv, this one might be the one for your session. Went fairly nicely with my fried clam roll for lunch."
"Overall this beer didn’t fit very well into the style and wasn’t nearly as clean as it should be. Not a bad beer, but not a good kolsch."
"Pretty good session beer. You're not going to get much head on this one, but look forward to a dynamic taste. The taste is primarily malty but expect quick bursts of lemon and hops. The mouthfeel is lightly creamy with hints of carbonation. An accessible beer with some subtle quirks that makes for a steady companion."
"O: The beer is easy to drink and is quite sessionable; it is a good choice for a hot summer day particularly since the lemon adds some refreshing properties."
"Bought a six-pack at Table and Vine. The drink poured with a large head and levels of patching across the glass. The appearance was a crisp gold look, with a slight amber color. Aromas were strong with sweet grains flavors and an earthy tone. The taste had a good flavor initially, but the taste kind of dissipates quickly. Generally speaking, it had a sugary sweet taste with light hops. Mouthfeel was light and watery. Pretty refreshing actually. Overall, not too bad."
"grainy malt presence muddles the flavors a little. that said, it's a pretty crisp drink. certainly more variety in the flavor profile than would have been provided by a lager yeast--there's even a soft vinous character. drying, grassy, herbal hops. i think the sweetness is about right; it works with the hop flavoring. the hopping is quite assertive, i must add...too much for my tastes"
"D - Very nice summer refresher; not a complex bouquet of flavors, but pretty much what a Kolsh should be. A decent stab at the style"
"D - This is an extremely refreshing beer, perfect for a hot summer bbq or after some yard work. Could enjoy a few in this setting but would seek something more challenging otherwise."
"Found this in a ""build a 6-pack"" store. I'd never tried a Kolsch so wanted to at least give it a try. Incredibly smooth, soft texture. Very little carbonation. Great for a session beer. Very, subtle flavoring. I had it with Mexican food, was a great pairing. It allowed the spices in the food to really come through."
"Drinkability: probably the best I've received so far from Amazing clubs. A solid brew that I would have again. Definitely a summertime beer."
"d - Overall this was an ok beer; not bad but nothing great. Smells and tastes strongly of malt and bread/grain, and didn't really have much hops to it. I wouldn't buy it again, but hey, it's nice for a free beer."
" a surprise brew indeed."
"Drinkability: I could have two or three. A solid above average kolsch that sticks to the style. I like the flavor combinations."
"Smells malty with a light breadiness. Pours to a hazy light brown with a multi-sized bubble creamy head. Taste is quite balanced but a little more on the sweet side. No bitterness but a flat tartness in the background throughout and more evident in the finish. The mouthfeel is nicely carbonated but doesn't try to overpower the taste. This is a very smooth drinker. Good and solid with a nice backbone and a finish leaving one desiring another sip. This is a great session brew."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/4"" white head over the slightly cloudy golden brew. Head dwindles gradually, with ample lacing. Aroma is lightly sweet, lightly spicy. Taste follows the nose, sweet pale malts, spicy yeast, prickly hops. Mouthfeel is smooth, and drinkability is easy. Pretty good stuff."
"D) A nice beer for a hot summer day. Not a standout, but a good brew."
"Refreshing mouthfeel -- I wish more brewers did kolsch, the flavor of an ale with the smoothness & freshness of a lager. Very sessionable, modest, good for summer."
"This went down really well. A great change of pace. It made me realize that I've been drinking way too much amber and IPA lately. Great beer, great style. Mind you, this is beer for grown-ups. No distinctive fruit flavors, no tartness, no bullshit gimmicks. This would pair well with most food because it is so stripped down. A real grain-forward beverage, and another winner from Cape Ann."
"This beer pours a cloudy copper color with a half finger white head, doesn't retain very well and leaves spotty lacing on the glass. Nose is of grainy malts with a lemon zest finish to it. Taste is relatively hoppy in flavor, all citrus hops, graininess in the middle with a lemon zest finish to it. Beer is medium body, decent carbonation, sweet beer with a relatively dry finish to it. This is a nice beer that one could sit with for a while."
"Drinkability-Easy drinker. The ABV makes it easy to have a few of these. Would probably get it again."
"Medium bodied feel and creamy but also refreshing. Spring-y! Lots of bitter hops, earthy malts and a citrusy respite. A heck of a nice spring-friendly beer."
"Amberish orange colored beer with a slowly fading head.Aroma has a subtle grape juice to it.Taste is grainy,grape juice and a little bit bready.Overall a pretty enjoyable beer for any occasion.This is something I would recommend and purchase again soon."
"D: A good summer beer. I have not had a lot of Kolsch-style ales, but I will certainly look out for them now. Well-played Cape Ann."
"pours a clear light amber with a quickly dissipating one finger head and no lace to speak of. smells slightly fruity with a strong metallic note to it. grainy and dry taste with a metallic after note that i did not like. light mouthfeel and a crisp carbonation. maybe its the kolsch style i don't like but i will not buy this beer again and its not meant to be a put down for this beer."
"very drinkable. i wish i had more regular access to this beer as it would be a summer staple for me."
"Much stronger hop in the flavor profile, like a hoppy pale ale. Weaker pal malt flavors,. Proper body for the style, which is to say thinner than most pale ales. This is a very easy beer to drink."
"I received this as part of a BOTMC. It pours a hazy gold with a moderate white head. The aroma is a bit light, perhaps a few grassy notes. Up front this one has an assertive bitterness that smooths out with a malty sweetness. The brew is well carbonated light bodied and made to be consumed on a hot summer day. A very goood beer."
"This makes a fantastic warm weather beer without being too light or boring. A drinkable refresher worth a try."
"12oz. bottle served in my Reissdorf Stange. No freshness dating indicated on the bottle. Poured a pale, translucent gold with a sizzling, off-white head that dissipated within seconds into a thin broken band around the perimeter of the glass. Nose consisted of cereal grains and perhaps some very faint fruity esters. Taste follows nose and finishes clean. Mouthfeel is light and lively. Easy drinking, style consistent and also a little more flavorful than other kolsch's I've tried, relatively speaking. Simple and very drinkable. Prost."
"Taste is light and crisp, malty but has a weird grassy bitterness in the aftertaste that kind of distracts from the overall feel. Light and easy to drink, but nothing too amazing, don't think I'd buy it on it's own but as part of a mixed pack I'm glad I got to try it."
"Drinkability: easy to quaff this one but this beer does not provide that crisp refreshment I was looking for."
"Pours a nice hazy golden yellow color, nice carbonation, nice little white head, with some sticky lacing. The nose is malty, with some spices. The taste is slighlty sweet/bitter, malty, with some spiceyness. Medium body. Drinkable, not a bad brew."
"Refreshingly light-bodied and crisp, this a a very nice stab at the style. Interestingly, the aroma doesn't quite match the taste, IMO, and the latter is truer to style. It's light but with a nice taste. I could drink this easily as a ""refresher"" or ""easy sessioner""."
"D: Pretty light and easy to drink."
"pours a cloudy light orange color w/ a thin white cap which dissipates quickly leaving little lacing in my goblet ; smell is mostly nutty toasted grains and piney hops w/ subtle notes of a dark fruit ; a sweet/bitter initial flavor, more caramely nuts and citrusy hops mid-way, a bit of tartness in the finish as well ; light bodied and slightly dry mouthfeel with mild carbonation ; def. a quaffable brew, a very nice kolsch..."
"Tastes of singed light graints with some herbal hops peeking out. A little grainy in the mouth with mild fizziness. Nice."
"The bottle foamed over the second I opened it. I'm not sure if it was overcarbonated or maybe it accidently got knocked around in my fridge. Other than all that, I really enjoyed this one."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, mild kick, very good representation of style, this is a nice lighter German-style sessionable beer that is worth drinking for a long time."
"D-great beer. Easily the best that is offered by this brewery. I could definately drink this all night. Worth getting a growler of it."
"12oz brown bottle from Tiger Town in Gardiner. Pours a hazy dark golden color with a thin film of foam. Smells like caramel, toffee, grass, and a bit of pepper... Tastes biscuity and caramelly, with a tinge of fruit and pepper toward the finish. Light both in body and in carbonation. Less drinkable than expected... An okay beer overall, but a Kolsh it is not..."
"This was served up a light amber color with an average white head and decent lacing. It has a light wheat and cracker aroma with a hint of malt. The flavor brings on more of the exact same ideas I got from the aroma except there is more of the dry hop bitterness. It has some lager like qualities at first but the hoppy ale takes over. It's medium bodied with fine carbonation. Drinkable enough but not a delectable enticement so much as I would like. Generally a good quality option though."
"I hate having to knock points off for ""inauthenticity"" because this is one fine beer,but I'm just not sure it's a Kolsch. Absolutely worth your time, if light beer is your jones du jour."

"D: Really good drinkability and interesting flavors would make you coming back for more."
"Party on the poop deck with this 1!!"
"Wow, what a head on this ale. The beer pours a nice, slightly cloudy orange amber, with a prodigious head and intense lacing. This thing poured right over the top of my glass, and talk about retention. The smell is grapefruity hop, spices, a bit metallic, some very tart citrus, and some bready malts. The beer is quite carbonated and the continuous efforvescence will attest to that. The taste is definitely tart hops, there is some buttery maltiness in the finish, but the tartness, the acerbic hop quality, and the slightly metallic bite is what is most pronounced. The beer starts out quite dry, but once it settles in a bit, there is slightly less sharpness, the tartness rounds out, and more of the maltiness and bread like qualities begin to emerge as well as the more warming spices. This isn't a bad beer, definitely on the light side in what you would expect in this style. I will seek out this brewery (Cape Ann) with some interest because it is local for me. The aftertaste is a bit astringent, the mouthfeel is a bit dry, lightish, and refreshing. Worth scouting around for. L'Chaim."
"This was nice & definitely a joy ride for those who like their beers bitter & dry. I am craving a big deli sandwich, fries, a pickle wedge. I could see this being a KILLER lobster paring, as well as various whitefish done simply, some dry cheddar or Cotswold, maybe anything with spinach (bitter), simple potatoes, artisan bread. While not something I would want to drink every day, it was a nice change of pace and was rather nice. Recommended, especially if you like dry & bitter. Give it a shot."
"A pleasant Kolsch that is not as bland as most versions of the style. Light, drinkable, and worthy of grabbing another."
"hey, i liked it. i'd hope some more people might give it a try"
"Overall a nice kolsch. A good summer beer for sure."
"This beer is tasty, well balanced, easy to drink and has a wonderful appearance in the glass. I thought the aroma was a bit subdued, but otherwise this is one tasty brew."
