review_text
"If we are rating beers within their style, then, since this is one of the most highly rated Kolsch beers,  wouldn't it be good for at least a 4?  Nobody appreciates a beer that's only 4.8% ABV anymore.  It's not ""extreme"" enough.  Phooey.  This is a beautiful beer.  I'll have another please.  And then maybe another after that."
"I enjoyed this one overall. It poured a straw yellow. The aroma was floral and almost soapy. Nice clean, smooth and refreshing taste and feel. Not the most flavorful beer, but something that would hit the spot for wetting the palate, a hot summer day and/or session brew. I did not like it as much as reissdorf kolsch, but will still get it again."

"Probably this is just not my style. I honestly don't think it's better than any other mild lagers out there. Even a little bit skunky, which I really did not expect."
"5 litre mini keg. Golden and very clear. Taste is very soft and refreshing. Buttery bread. Minimal hops. Extremely sessionable. I would recommend to anyone looking for an easily drinkable, refreshing, & quality brewski. Would buy again."

"Light to medium pilsner malt aroma with very light medium noble hop aromas at the end. No DMS or diacetyl. Pale yellow in color with spectacular clarity. Poured with a fizzy bright, white foam with low retentioin that quickly dissipated. Light to medium body with crisp, medium carbonation through the middle and a slight puckering sensation near the finish. Pilsner malt flavor is dominant with light noble hop bitterness near the finish that provides a pleasant balance. Crisp dry finish with light pilsner and bready aftertaste. Crisp, refreshing and easy drinking."
""
"A nice example of the style. Still a tiny bit skunky, but still really good."
"Sulfur tones competes with the kolsch yeast tones"

"Final Thoughts: At first I didn't think this beer was going to fare too well, but it grew on me. Really this seems to be the measuring stick for Kolsch. Nothing bad, but nothing exceptional. If you haven't had Kolsch before, I'd recommend this one, but it's a bit lackluster for a more dedicated craft enthusiast."

"DATE REVIEWED: August 30, 2014... GLASSWARE: Paulaner pokal... OCCASION: college football begins in earnest....with PSU’s last second win in Ireland!... APPEARANCE: pale, straw-colored body that actively bubbles; sudsy white head simmers but holds at a half-finger; spotty clouds of lacing... AROMA: soft, fruity esters ease the nostrils; some apple, pear and floral scents all suggest a lightly hopped brew.. PALATE: wondrously soft (!), reasonably effervescent mouthfeel; leaves a slightly palatable aftertaste of malt; mega-drinkable... TASTE: slight biscuit is earliest impression; next up, bubblegum and aromatic lilac or currants; biscuit becomes more prominent as the glass drains ...OVERALL: refreshment is the key word here,, as this kolsch slams like a fruity pilsner, with enough bitterness to suggest hopping and enough weight to suggest malt...a nice pairing with a late summer night and its sweltering humidity--a wonderful combination of drinkability and complexity..."

"Hoppy for style yet uninteresting."

"This doesn’t really meet the criteria for a Kolsch – there is no dense lasting head, chill haze is present, hops are not noted in either the aroma or taste.  If it was made here, it’d be called an “American Kolsch” and the criteria wouldn’t matter, but since it’s make in Koln, it should.  Mediocre at best, possibly slightly skunked."

"Not a bad Kolsch, but probably not the best representation of how the brewer intended it to be."

"05/13/13 On tap. Nice and crisp. A touch on the bitter side, but it works well. I'm a stickler for having Kölschs served icy cold and in smaller glasses to maintain their crispness. Otherwise I find myself in a race against the Elements and we all know how that will turn out. Looking for this to be a summer favorite."

"Part of me is more interested in Kolsch as a type of beer than I'm actually interested in drinking it. I think the flavors are generally too subtle for my unrefined taste. Gaffel is the best I've had, but I still struggle to remember how it tastes exactly, even from just a few hours ago. Crisp, light, with a distinct (but soft) sour aftertaste. A decent beer for spring but not something I'll keep coming back for."

"O: I actually prefer this to the Sünner Kölsch but then that was truly the most boring beer I've ever had. This is the sort of drink I'd fancy on a train journey or a long haul flight when I'm a bit parched."

"Give me a Dom Kölsch any day. This beer tasted a touch bland. Decent enough."
"An OK, although not the best one."
"It is quite easy to quaff I will say and brings out a much sweeter flavor than I can pick up on the nose. Grains as well. Clean finish. It is what one would expect from a German Koslch from Germany."

"A good representation of the kolsch style, but good and refreshing."
"O: This is a nice Kölsch, a rather difficult style to fully appreciate since the complexity is almost suttle, But this one has all a Kölsch should, and in a very nice way."
"No grassy or musty notes coming from my glass, very slight lemon and spice notes, more of a tangy sweet flavor through out. No bitters, very low hop feel. Refreshing easy to drink, would like to drink more!"
"O- Not bad, not great."
""
""
""
"pours a medium gold in color no head or lace at all. smells of fresh grass with faint floral notes and slight fruity sweetness. taste of fresh grain, grass and some hops. mouthfeel light carbonation ok but a little more would have helped. fresh and light easy to drink would buy again."
""
""
"Slightly above average but enjoyable."
""

"Decent offering."

"(4.0) D: This is my first introduction to the Kolsch style, and hopefully not my last considering how much I enjoyed this. Grainy and mineral-like with a long and favourable dryness. This would be ideal as an easy-to-drink option year round, but especially in the warmer (patio weather) months."
""
"A fairly full body with a sharp, tangy carbonation. Lose the metal and this is a pretty good beer."
""
""
""
"Overall, a pretty run of the mill kolsch and nothing really spectacular. A beer that is refreshing and easy to drink but not really worth seeking out."
""
""
""
"Damn, it's difficult to judge a beer like this according to its actual, accepted characteristics (lack of head retention and lacing - namely my hang-ups here). Gaffel (and Kölsch, for that matter) has a subtly in taste (most subtle of any German style, next to maybe German pilsner?) that will appeal to lager drinkers. I just have a feeling that better German examples exist, and that we in the US haven't access to 'em. Oh well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall / Drinkability: Very drinkable. I wish I had a much bigger glass full of this. A nice blend of aroma and taste. I would definitely try this again."
""

"Nice kolsch. A very light German ale with some loaded flavor. 4.0"
""
""
"Overall not bad, but not great. It has those tendencies of the good German beers, but seems to be off a bit as well. It tries to go the extra mile but seems to end up at half a mile."
""
""
""

"Single finger white head on a cloudy deep golden body and scattered lacing. Aroma is sweet with pale malts, corn, light herbal hops and hint of honey. Lots of honey in the flavor which is both sweet and musty. Nice pale malts, some biscuit and non descript citrus. Thicker body for the style and moderate carbonation. Body could use more clarity for the style and the aroma is weak but the flavor is actually more full and complex than many in this genre provide."
""
"Review from 10/2010 notes. Poured into a kolsch glass. Pours a medium yellow amber, minimal head with a bit of lacing. Wheat and light malt aroma. Starts with a clean wheat, but an odd, almost adjunct flavor develops. Light fruit, wheat and corn(?). Slightly astringent finish. Ok, but there are better kolsches out there."
"-Overall 4.0: This is a very nuanced beer. If I did not know that this beer was not brewed with lager yeast, I could not tell you from the taste that it was different than a lager. To me, this beer just tastes like an excellent lager. Taste levels are all balanced and well established at every level. Definitely recommended if you have never had a kölsch, as this is an excellent example of the style."
""
"o - Overall I liked this one quite a bit; it reminded me a lot of Allagash White and seemed more like a witbier. Lots of citrus and very easy to drink; a great summer beer."
""
"The Rest: A solid Kolsch. Well balanced with a nice body and fairly assertive bitterness."
"Pours a hazy light orange with a 1/2 inch foamy off-white head that quickly fades to an oily film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. The first smell that is honestly overpowering is skunk and this isn't even a green bottle so that is weird. Eventually this fades away and I get some malt/grain, grass/hay, and some light fruity aromas. Taste is much the same (thankfully no skunk flavors) and is fairly sweet. There is a mild hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is pretty easy to drink after the skunk smell fades away."
"O: very straightforward brew. No frills, sessionable. It's quite tasty."
"This one has the feel: it's light, extremely crisp without being bracingly so, and riding on a constant moderate but not overwhelming carbonation. It's how a Kolsch should feel."
""
""
""
"It has a light berry sweetness. There's a good hop bite in the swallow. Short aftertaste. Refreshing and light."
"Final Grade: 3.68, a solid B grade. There are a lot of fizzy yellow German beers on the shelves of the LCBO. A lot of them are not worth trying, but a few of them are - and I would be comfortable arguing that Gaffel Kolsch falls firmly into the latter category. If only the domestic brewing giants could use their ample expertise and bottomless capital to put out a brew of this quality! Definitely worth a try for any fan of German lagers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not a ton to say about this one. Light drinking beer with a variety of differing flavors."
"Overall a great beer. I still prefer my homebrew Kolsch to this though. ;-)"
""
""
"OVERALL: Gaffel Kolsch is an excellent light option especially in the summer months. Would pair nicely with a pastrami sandwich and frites or potato salad."
""
"A very good German lager, easy going, refreshing and light. Pairs good with meals. Nothing unique or outstanding about it, but just a solid lager."
"Taste is crisp and toasty, with a pronounced citrus hops snap at the finish. A light, easy-to-drink, and well-done kolsch that's worth seeking out."
"11.2 oz bottle. Pours pale straw with a long lasting, white head and soda like carbonation. Aroma is mostly of grassy, herbal hops and some pale malt. Body is medium and crisp. Herbal, earthy, spicy, hops, pale malt and light fruit combine on the palate. Finish is bitter with hints of lemon fruit. Light, easy drinking, flavorful brew."
""
""
""
""
"This isn't a bad beer. It smells like a typical European import, but the flavor is on point and to style. It's highly drinkable and smooth. If you're looking for something lighter give this a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Aside from my thinking this is an old bottle, I like it rather well. I'd certainly be inclined to give a fresh bottle a shot or two."
"Pours a clear, gold color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Slight retention and slight lacing. Smells of pale malt, grain, and a hint of hop. Fits the style of a Kolsch. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of pale malt, grain, hint of hop, and a hint of sweet malt. Overall, very session-able, but still lacking in body as far as blend and complexity."
"I’m afraid my first German kölsch is not going to become a favorite of mine. Certainly it’s a drinkable beer, but that’s about all you can say about it. It's a short journey from here to a macro lager."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Golden yellow in typical kolsch form, white head forms and leaves behind a thin layer of retention and a bit of lace. Nose has some grains, cereals, and some moderate hopping - a bit of grass. Gentle sweetness. More sweetness on the palate, with a greater amount of hopping and graininess to contend with it. Lightly vegetal, a bit of corn, some sulphur and a touch of metal in the finish. Light body, medium-high carbonation and an offtaste that's a touch offputting. Easily drinkable however, not a bad kolsch and easily the best at the LCBO right now."

"Consumed at the Mill House in Greenwood, SC. 12 OZ brown bottle with no freshess date. Pours a beautiful crystal clear golden straw color with a nice fluffy head that hangs around. Nice sticky lacing too. Crisp, clean aroma of green apples and pale malt. Taste is clean, dry and refreshing with just the right amount of carbonation. Goes down almost too easy. Perfect with the Mill House Titus pizza. Had to have another."
""
""
""
""
"It has a creamy, velvety taste that is well-balanced by a very fruity, earthy hops. It finishes dry, and makes you want to take another swig. Smooth, creamy, a bit hoppy, and easily drinkable, about everything you'd want in great Koln beer."
"Such an overlooked style here in the U.S. , and this example is a fine one. Drinkable, well-balanced, and just well-made."
""
"Pours a golden color with a finger of head. Aroma is grainy and bready, with sharp hops. The taste is a little sharper at first than I'd like, with sharper grains and hops (akin to a pilsner), but settles into the lingering bready finish I associate with a good Kolsch. The mouthfeel is a little thin, but otherwise nice, and the drinkability is quite good. A solid Kolsch that'll do when I'm craving the style, but not my favourite."

"My first of this style - very easy to like. Go Gaffel! Beeradvocate lists the Kölsch style as obscure, but the taste is anything but. This is not hugely different from Bavarian lagers, with the exception of a slight fruitiness, maybe apple or grape, I can't even say. It's brewed like an ale, then lagered, from what I'm reading. So there are slight differences between Kölsch and lager, which makes it a nice drinking experience. This is the kind of light, dry, grainy malt and hop combination that has me saying, ""Hey, I like this. Let me have another."" Session material here. Reissdorf is next. If your pour straight down the center, you'll get a good head and nice aroma."
""
"An easy drinker -- not mind-blowing but very solid. A real change of pace and true to form."
""
""
"Solid carbonation, medium-light bodied, very clean finish, refreshing and tasty. Definite session territory here. Not particularly interesting, just a clean, cold refresher that goes down easy. Enjoyed this draft version more than the bottled Kolsch beers I’ve sampled; perhaps it’s a freshness issue; this one was really vibrant and tasty."
""
"O: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, mild kick, very good representation of style, this is a very nice simplistic and poundable beer to drink for a long time."
""
"DRINKABILITY: This would make an okay session lager, I suppose, but it's not as good as Reissdorf Kölsch. The apple flavor of the yeast only shows up on the finish and the hops just arent very crisp. Overall, kind of disappointing -- there's nothing particularly memorable about it, though it is easy to drink. Would I buy it again? Probably not. There are other, better alternatives out there for about the same price."
""
""
""
""
"Small bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours rather yellow with a sudsy white head. Clean bready profile with mild bruised apple fruitiness. Vague citrus, cereal grains. Pretty straightforward without any frills, and it holds up pretty well for having sailed from the paterland. Not too watery or anything. Decent beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"330 bottle poured into Leffe chalice. Golden colour, small head which didn't hang around long, kept some lacing, clear. Aroma combined Chardonay grape with a really fresh bitter hoppy North German Pils aroma. Tasted Chardonay grape, fruits, had a light sourness. Finsh was bitter. Well carbonated which gave it a coarse edge, body was thick for the fairly light ABV. Had the fell of Pils mixed with Sekt which is what happens in parts of Germany."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a crystal clear, pale yellow with a thin fizzy head that dissipates to essentially nothing pretty quickly. Grassy aroma, grains and, well that's about it. Light taste, bready, lightly earthy, sweet with pale malts, and a gentle floral hoppiness. Pretty one-dimensional and uninteresting, as typical with the style. Light mouthfeel, and a bit of unpleasant bitterness in the aftertaste. Good for lightweights, but not very drinkable otherwise. I am not a fan."
"A little darker in color than Fruh with a tiny bit more bite to the taste. I guess it just depends on one's mood whether Gaffel or Fruh is the #1 Kolsch on the day. A little stronger smell for Gaffel over Fruh, but not quite the better overall. Close your eyes and pick one - can't go wrong with either of them!!"
"I had no problems drinking it, even though I'm not a huge Kolsch guy. Worth a try if you want to get a taste of Cologne."
"An average kolsch in every respect. Fine in a pinch, but nothing I'd seek out again."
"Gaffel is a great pick/example of the true Kolsch style. I've had this both on tap in the brewery in Koln and bottled at home. I am thrilled it's available in the US, but make sure the bottles aren't dusty! Some people might not prefer this beer because of the perception of a session beer... Don't compare to an American ale or Belgian beer loaded with all sorts of bold flavors. For fans of German Pils. What it is, is a clean tasting beer with a certain sweetness and earthiness that must be fresh and is also best when drank with the proper 'ritual.' Drink it in the 'Stanger' type glasses meant for pounding the beer down with friends! Good times."
"Overall- Kolsh is an under appreciated style. Gaffel's Kolsh is an easy drinker, very tasty and needs a better place in the beer pantheon. I wouldn't say its an go-absolutely-out-of-your-way-to-find-it but... If you happen upon a bottle... You must try it, it is very much worth it."
"Overall - Not worth going out of your way, but if someone pours you a glass, its an easy drinker and a decent session beer."
"The smell and taste were both very minimal. There was very light malting and grain presence. I didn't get anything else."
"I don't usually drink beer from a can but with this beer is was OK with me. Great tasting to say the least. Very smooth, less carbonated and very tasty. I bought a 6 pack of 17 OZ and brought them home to the USA. Will do so every month now as I'm commuting back and forth."
"Ultra clear yellow color. Lower carbonation than what I expected, probably around 2.5 volumes of co2. White head at first but disappointingly instantly dissipates. The aroma has lager like characteristics. Grainy-yeasty aroma. Very clean and pleasant. Slight sweetness and fruitiness to the yeast. Very simple, but nice. The flavor is much more ale like as compared to the smell. Crisp and light like a lager, but fruity yeast and fuller body like an ale. It seems similar to an extra pale ale in the US. Nothing is blowing my mind right now, but it delicious refreshing beer with no major technical flaws. Would gladly have again."
"The beer is golden in color, with 1/4"" of white head that leaves some random lacing on the snifter. The aroma is bready and slightly sweet - very fresh and inviting. Refreshing and crisp, with a delicate honey sweetness throughout. Sweet, bready malts with some subtle earthy, herbal, hop notes. Well done. Light in body, this is a great choice for a quaffable summer brew. I would have this again."
"Pours a clear bright yellow-straw color with a good white head and some spotty lacing on the way down. The nose brings forward some light floral hops behind a solid base of straw and grain. Flavor is light malt and grain with a touch of light sweetness. Light and crisp with good carbonation. Nice beer on a hot day."
"It is pretty much what I was expecting, and seems true to style. A nice summer beer."
"A great Kolsch. The only thing keeping this beer from having a higher rating is the fact that you people don't have any appreciation for subtlety. This is the greatest Kolsch available in America, hands down. I will argue anyone on this fact until you give up and realize your foolishness."
"D: I guess several centuries of brewing this style have given them ample opportunity to perfect their craft. Job well done. This was great with pulled pork on a hot Sunday afternoon out on the deck"
"Drinkability: I fear this bottle may have been conditioned poorly. It doesn't taste of skunk but the metal flavours are extremely unpleasant."
"Overall: meh. I don't feel the desire to have this beer again; despite its provenance I've had much better Kölsches than Gaffel."
"Taste is with a light bitterness and the beer feels a bit watery because of the low ABV. Not a spectacular beer which you must drink when you see it."
"Overall-Refreshing on this hot day, an ok Kolsch, not world class but hits the style notes fine and is a passable version."
"Crisp and imminently drinkable. Sliced apples and bread, very lightly dry herbal hop bitterness in the aftertaste. Extra clean, simple and flavorful. Simplicity is vastly underrated these days. Light carbonation, exceptionally easy to drink a few in the hot July weather."
"Enjoyed on a hot afternoon at the Keybar in New York City served in a tall glass this beer shows a very clear yellow gold with a modest white head and a few specks of lace. The aroma is classic, somewhat thick, cereal grain with a slight, tasteful yeast. The flavor is bright cereal rice grain with a hint of yeasty corn. It has firm but pleasant carbonation and a crisp, aqueous feel. It is highly drinkable and refreshing, and excellent summer refreshment with a little citrus hop that becomes evident at the finish. Enjoyable but nothing very different. A relable refresher."
"O- Not great. Reminds me of a macro brew. A kolsch shouldn't be loaded with flavor but I still feel like this one is falling short."
"12 oz bottle poured into Pilsener glass. Pale Straw clear & yellow with pure white foaming head which recedes quickly with no lacing. Aroma is skunky, taste is worse. very bitter and astringent with that skunk smell coming through. I am glad I only bought a single 12 oz bottle. I will not buy another. It doesn't begin to resemble Reissdorf Kolsch in any way which is a superior brew."
"Very refreshing and light."
"Bright pale blonde, one finger of white head, some lace at the top of the glass. Smell is of bready malt, cereal, grassy, slight hop and lemon zest. Taste is quite malty, earth notes, some bitterness shows up, finishes slightly sweet. Decent weight, med to full body, soft and slightly creamy, good use of carbonation. Not a bad brew, probably wont spend 3 and change on this again but is passable."
"I can't hate on the mouthfeel. It's as light and spritzy as you want a session lager such as Kolsch to be. There isn't much to say about it other than it fits the parameters of the style. Overall, this is a disappointment. The city of Cologne can do much better than submit Gaffel Kolsch as a beer representative of the city. This is out-of-balance and no true competition to the far-superior Reissdorf Kolsch."
"Like I said, it is my first Kölsch, and it won't be my last. It is a style that every beer lover needs to try. I can see fans of lagers and pilseners enjoying this more than us stout fans, but it has a place on warm days like today was."
"A nice Kolsch, though at $11 a six pack, I can certainly get my Kolsch fix for less."
"D: such a good style and a great example of the style. kinda surprised this beer doesnt have higher reviews...."
"O - This is not my style however I like to try brews that are out of character - so I am happy I tried it - however, it is too much like the generic lagers/ pilseners etc I no longer drink and I used to steal from dad (blue or 50) - however, from what I have read it seems true to the style and is simply not my cup of tea"
"Overall: quite good, slightly better than the tap version, and based on what I've had so far, a great Kolsch. Wholeheartedly recommend this for someone trying to learn about the style. Can't wait till I can get to Cologne to drink some local Kolsches! Cheers!"
"Some malt and noticeably grassy hops in the nose. Taste is dominated by grassy hops. Has a slightly spicy bite that sets it off some. Enjoyable, easy drinking, not heavy handed, but not watery either. Subtle. Decent middle-of-the-road brew."
"Strangely, I like this better out of the bottle, I think it's less gassy and what I was served on tap was a bit to cold also to let the flavors out."
"D: I've no other Koelsch to compare it to, but it seems to be within style and makes for a pleasant session or summer beer."
"This Kölsch wasn't too bad. Still an average brew to me but it was flavorful enough to keep me into it. The beer is a very clear light yellow, traditional color for this style of beer. The head wasn't overly large and it dwindled down a after a little while. The brew tasted like a mix of a Kölsch and Pilsner. It was decent. The mouthfeel is light and refreshing good for a summer brew if you're not into fruit beers."
"I'd say right on for the style. Personally, I think on BA this style gets the shaft as it's certainly more subtle and reminds people of BMC type beers. Of course, it's not as complex as an Imp Stout. But it's not supposed to be. Good representation of the style. Nice beer."
"I often wonder about the reviews foreign beers get, i love some belgian beers but i just dont see much going on in this beer, it kind of seems like a german coors but it has a B average here. I am attracted to beer because it can have big rich palates, it can be big and bold with hops or malts or chocolate ETC so this beer dint really do anything for me."
"Gaffel's beer may be a nice Helles, but a Kolsch it is not. I detracted accordingly."
"Also: The girlfriend got a beerface from this. Minus points. Budweiser with grapes."
"Mouthfeel is light with a fine amount of carbonation."
"had this one in a traditional german restaurant along the rhine river in koln. Served in a 0.2 ml glass. Straw golden colour with white head. Smells a bit more hoppy than the other variants of kolsch i tried. Taste is like most kolsch beers, with a bit more dry finish. Very drinkable and pairs great with bratwurst!"
"D: could drink a few goes down smooth real good beer. Have not have many of this style however i am trying to experience more styles"
"D: Very drinkable and smooth; paired well with buffalo shrimp tacos! I don't know if I'll seek any of this stuff out, but I'd probably get it again if they continue to carry it at Coast."
"When fresh (it was better last month) I could drink it all night long."
"I didn't dislike this by any means, I just wasn't particularly impressed. It was refreshing, but somewhat watery without much flavor. It's a great session beer that I would buy again for that purpose."
"Drinkability - Bitterness is definitely present in this brew, but not as overpowering as some that I've sampled. Nice to have a Koelsch again, but it's not quite as I remembered."
"D: Like a kolsch should be, really crisp and refreshing. Very easy to drink."
"Interesting beer like a pils with a bit more character."
"Pours a pale yellow with little to no head. Aroma is bready and hay malts with a slight earthy scent. Taste is light bodied, refreshing, and a tad watery with predominantly bread and grass flavors. Sweetness comes through as well especially in the finishing."
"This goes down easy and I could have enjoyed several if it wasn't for the high price. At just 4.8% alcohol there is very little alcoholic taste to get in the way of the other flavors."
"Its an average brew. Not much else to say. If you like Euro style lagers, you might want to try it but there are better examples out there."
"Pours a clean, pale yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, small skunkiness and standard European lager kind of smells. In the taste, a bitter hop, a small dry maltiness, and somewhat watery. A small bite and light bodied mouthfeel, with a dry, small earthiness in the aftertaste. Standard European lager, but a bit more watery than expected."
"Clear pale golden color with a nose that is reminiscent of the Pilsener. Mouth fairly light with hints slightly salty, which must be certainly a powerful spring water, high in minerals, especially calcium. A little bitterness is noted on the finish, slightly coarse and especially high in minerals. High fermentation, this Kolsch closely resembles a basic lager except this powerful bitterness probably mediated by the quality of water used."
"Gaffel Kölsch came to me looking pretty dead, I mean PBR dead. Just a trace of white lines on top of a fairly adjunct looking beer with a gold color to it. Smells included pale malt out the ying yang, grain and I guess a fruiting of some kind that smelled off out the gate. Tastes included everything I just stated above except there was no fruit. No earthy hops can even bring this one around. It really tasted like a souped up american macro to me, I don't see the appeal in this beer. Isn't it supposed to be the pinnacle of the style. Anywho, feel was bland watery and lifeless, thin and dead. Drinkability suffered but I got through my glass because im a trooper. I'll try this again if Im ever in Germany but for now Im going to avoid this in droves."
"Drink: nice and drinkable, but little boring. tastes bit like a pilsner to me and I get bored with pilsner too soon."
"It is more like a pilsner but with a subtle tinge of apple. I expected more of an apple flavor, but this is a good quality beer."
"My advice is to pay attention and learn to seek Kolsch out. It raised the bar for easy, session-drinking beers."
"drinkability; very drinkable like a good Pils but lacking the bitterness that would sit heavy in the stomach."
"D: Good, refreshing brew for a hot day. Would have preferred it a little colder and a little more effervescent, but I guess you can't have everything."
"Drink - A very nice light and refreshing beer that stacks up to Beau's Kolsch in my opinion. It has lots of the same characteristics as Beau's without the weird aftertaste. This would go great with some spicy food."
"D- so refreshing, great for nights in september when DC is still an unfathomable 95 degrees. Exactly what I wanted, and would like to explore this style more."
"I'll drink this stuff, as it's not bad beer by any means. It's just not a good Kölsch, in my opinion."
"This beer marks the first I've had for the style. I do think that every beer ahs its time and its place and in the hot months of summer, I'd say no other style fits it better. From the nose to the taste to the feel, everything spells refreshment. In my case, I drank this in the fall, but I was looking for something simple tonight and I got exactly what I wanted!"
"Taste is crisp apple, lots of grain, some mineral, lightly bitter grass and herb, green apple peel. If not too cold, the flavours really come through, integreat and balance nicely, with a full-bodied character, lively and somewhat complex despite being light in body and exceedingly drinkable."
"D - Could easily down this whole growler in a few minutes this beer is so drinkable. That being said this really isn't my favorite style but I feel it represents the style well. This is the lady's favorite style so I try a lot of these and this one really has nothing offensive about it. Not too much that blows me away either however. I only know of 3 true Kölsch's that we can get in the US so this is certainly worth trying if you enjoy the style."
"D - More complex flavour when compared to your average Lager but this one didn't stand out all that much to me."
"Notes: Its delicate flavor and light texture and body make it an easy hot weather drinker. It was ok in the bottle but I would bet that it is much better fresh on tap in Germany!!!"
"Clear straw with a nice billowy head. Nose is light lemon and grass. Nicely citric and grassy hop with a bit of balancing sweetness. Very clean and a smooth body - light, but without a watery mouthfeel. Good refreshing summer session brew, but nothing spectacular."
"D: This a great example of a Kolsch, a style thats intended to be light and highly drinkable. Mild flavors and aroma, but refreshing nonetheless."
"Quite drinkable."
"D: this is excellent. If I can get this all summer long it might replace my defacto lawn-chair standard beers like Pilsner urquell and Creemore Springs. (4.0)"
"D: I did like this beer, while I have not had many Kolsch style beers, I prefer the Reissdorf Kolsch over this one."
"D: A good drinker."
"This is a good kolsch; kolsch seems to be ""de rigeur"" with American brewers right now but unfortunately, few seem to have gotten it right. Here's an authentic one from Koln that provides a good example for the style."
"D: drinkable enough, and that's not surprising for a kolsch, yet it doesn't endear like Beau's (my only comparison). An okay beer, though I probably won't buy again."
"With my late afternoon excursion to the CK winding down, I go for a lighter, more sessionable brew to begin the cool-off. It pours a clear, pale golden straw with a head of thick white froth. The nose is composed of hoppy pine, florals, grapefruit, and what seems like a very subtle caramel way the hell in the back. The taste is somewhat similar, led by the familiar florals, though the fruitiness is replaced by a watered-down bit o' white grape. What is most disappointing is a clear influx of chalk, bringing down what would have been a nice citrus-y flavor. The body is quite light, with a lightly moderate carbonation and refreshing watery feel. Were it not for the chalkiness, this wouldn't be very bad at all, but its presence bumps the whole brew down a notch."
"D: This is the only my 3rd Koln made Kolsch I've had, and it's arguably the best one. Very good tasty malt flavours, this would make a great introductory beer, I can only imagine how good this tastes fresh in wood casks in Cologne."
"Out of the three that I have had, this one ranks third by a titch, but all three have been impressive enough to make me seek out more and I can't help but drink this and think that it would taste so much better fresh than in a months-old bottle. The nearest thing I can tell about how fresh it is or isn't is the numbers 26.11.10, which I assume is the best-by date?"
"You really do have to redefine words like ""quaffable"" and ""clean"" when referring to kölsch beers. Whether it's something to do with the beer's unique brewing process, the traditions and integrity of the region's brewers or some indefinable factor inherent to the style I can't say, but there is definitely something that makes kölsch beers that much cleaner and more mindlessly drinkable than arguably any other style."
"Really hit the spot on a hot, humid day. Definitely a style that I will revisit throughout the summer. Great stuff."
"Very drinkable beer, perfect for a humid day like today. This is pretty much what comes to mind when I think Kolsch. Quality product."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability are good. Light, refreshing and easy to drink."
"D: The beer is extremely drinkable and somewhat refreshing. I wouldn't have more than one of these in a single sitting, but I would definitely have this again the next time I want to drink a beer from this style."
"Picked this up as part of the summer seasonal release at the Control Board in Ontario. Pours a clear pale yellow colour, with thick white head. Head dissipated, but tons of lacing all down the glass. Smells faintly of grassy hops. Taste is fairly light. Has some hop bitterness and light bready malt. Very smooth mouthfeel. This is a nice lager for a warm day, but not too much excites me about this beer. Probably won't buy again at over $3/bottle, but would if it was cheaper."
"Overall this is a solid and drinkable Kolsch. Not my favorite style, but I enjoyed it."
" A great Kolsch, pretty much defines the style....crisp, delicate character subtle complexity, deeply quenching."
"Overall, this beer reminded me more of a Pilsener than a Kolsch. I may give this brew another shot, or I may not. I can't give you any guidance as to whether you should try it or not."
"Beer is a golden yellow with a light head that fades. It has a fresh aroma with a trace of citrus. The taste is crisp and refreshing. The feel is light with a bitter finish. This beer was enjoyable. Kolsch beers are a nice change from all the pilsners I normally drink while in Germany."
"Crisp, dry, quaffable and refreshing, this has a great balance between grainy pale malt, zesty hops and moderate hop bitterness. There are undertones of honey and lemon peel, and it finishes on a pleasantly bitter note. It's a simple beer, but clean and immensely drinkable."
"D- great kolsch, very light yet very complex"
"Had this one on tap at Der Schwarze Kolner in Brooklyn. Unassuming appearance without a lot of aroma. Maybe a bit of an eggy or yeasty smell. Mouthfeel is very, very light--it goes down like nothing at all. The flavor is all in the aftertaste, which I didn't love. It's yeasty and a bit redolent of the keg beers you had in college."
"I love this brew one should surely try one one immediately!!"
"good thing i didn't just gulp the rest....after warming up, the flavor deepens a bit. maybe i should savor this a bit and enjoy with cheese and almonds or something..."
"There is a lot better in Köln."
"Cheers."
"Pours a clear golden body with well-carb'd head on top of a husky, dry oily aroma complete with bitter hops and dry malts. A dry beer that goes down easily with mild citric hop bitterness and a tad bit of sweetness on the backbite. An easy to drink beer that changes the pace from heavy, complex beers."
"I am very fortunate to have a store nearby that keeps extremely fresh imports. This beer is not dated, but the Bitburger that I got with it is less than 3 months old, so I infer that this is probably ultra-fresh."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Instantly effervescent, then in a few seconds we smooth out and lose most of the interesting activity. It's got what it takes to lift food off the palate, and the low ABV keeps it sessionable."
"Kolsch is definitely not my preference on brews. I got this in a beer of the month and it is decent."
"Beer is thin and grainy, some acid at the back but its not hops. It makes a semi-unpleasant aftertaste. Feeling a little cornish. The aftertaste does not last long fortunately. Drinkability pretty low for a Kolsch. Sorry Gaffel."
"Light bodied with some crisp light golden fruit notes, a sweet pilsner malt like backbone with some grass and straw notes and a crisp slightly hoppy dry finish. Hints of apple and pear and a bit of the sweetness from the malt are decently balanced by the subtle hops. Easy drinking but not very complex."
"D-perfect after leaf raking beer if you ask me. This example was a bit old (guessing because of the oxidation) but not bad. Would love to try this in Koln."
"D: Overall, this is a light drinkable beer. It won't knock your socks off, but it is worth a shot."
"This is very refreshing, but i'd be happy with just one of those and then move onto something else."
"Pours a typical clear straw yellow with a thin white head. Aroma is malty and slightly fruity. Flavor is rather wan, crisp and malty. Texture is watery and thin, just a little tingly. It leaves a thin finish that is slightly bitter but not in a good way. For a German beer, it was a disappointment - I hope that I got some from a bum batch."
"Light body, smooth, dry, clean and crisp. This beer is very refreshing and I could drink these all day, especially during the hot summer."
"Damn fine for the style."
"Drinkability: This is a very nice and very drinkable beer, especially if you like a good Kolsch. Very refreshing and as good as I remembered a Kolsch to be from having a night in Cologne. I could easily have had another and expect to drink this one again given the opportunity. A good example of a Cologne brewed Kolsch."
"I am starting to find Koelsch SOOO drinkable"
"Massive head, very light, translucent yellow. Smells crisp, some sweet, toffee-like malt, a bit of herbal hops. In the flavor the hops take on a grassy flavor, with a short wave of bitterness followed by the slightly sweet, bready malt that is characteristic of many german lagers, and then finishing a bit bitter again. I perceive the lager yeast much more than the ale yeast in this one: in a blind tasting I would not have been able to pick it out as a kolsch, but then again I have little experience with the style. An average, easy drinking beer with no stand out flavors, but no off flavors as well."
"D= Though this was easy to drink and tasted good enough to want another, it walked a fine line between Euro-lager, Pilsner, and Kolsch. At times I swore this tasted much like Grolsch, then other times I was impressed by its light grassy complexity. Overall a good beer that I would happily drink again but would not go far to seek out."
"D - I don't have a great knowledge of Kolsch beer, in fact this is my first. Overall it's a good beer, which most importantly I enjoyed drinking, and certainly would again."
"D - Drinkability is pretty good. No frills, easy drinking. Just enough flavor and not overly carbonated."
"Poured clear yellow color with a small white head; smelled of wheat, barley and malt. Nice and crisp feel that tastes of a hops, light yeast, wheat and a barley combo; very light carbonation that is crisp and refreshing. Average taste, but a very nice light beer that was easy to drink and the type I could drink all day or night. A very good summer beer!"
"Notes: A decent balance with a good supporting cast. Yet, I will not look for this one again. Just seemed o.k."
"The only ale I had so far in Berlin and very good. It was at a restaurant that specilized in this brand of Kolsch, which is typical, in berlin. The kegs were out in the restaurant which added to the ambiance and identification between place and beer. As always, this beer was very good."
"Overall: A good but somewhat average beer. I liked it but i think this is a style that would probably benefit more from trying fresh from the source."
"This poured a clear, light gold (nearly straw) with white head. It smelled like lemon hops and fresh barley malt, with a kind of funky sour yeast. It tasted like light lemon hops and fresh barley, with some caramel and creamy yeast. It was thin with lots of carbonation, and had a mild bitter aftertaste. Overall this didn't have a great smell, but it did have a nice clean flavor. The body was thin, but that's fitting for this style, and lent to the beer's overall super easiness to drink. This isn't my favorite style of beer, but this seems like a pretty solid example. Pretty refreshing for the summer."
"I've always felt that Kölsch is one of those styles that has to be done ""right," meaning that any slight inaccuracy in the brewing process will be painfully evident. Thankfully, Gaffel has had plenty of practice on this masterpiece of flavor and feel. Sometimes, nothing beats a classic, and this is rightfully one such beer. If you're looking for a lighter beer with plenty of flavor, especially on a hot day, you really can't go wrong with this one. Fabulous!"
"Bottle: Poured a bright golden color Kolsch with a rather large foamy head with good retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of light diacetyl with some butter and light sweet malt. Taste is also dominated by lightly sweet cereal with some very subtle hosp and some diacetyl is clearly detectable. Body si about average with some good carbonation. Not very interesting or something that I would wish to have more often."
"D - A more refreshing/highly flavorful beer is hard to imagine. I could drink this repeatedly and not get bored. One of the best session ales ever!"
"This is very good for summer after an activity outside and you need to drink something to quench your thirst."
"Nice beer. I've only ever tasted one other Kolsch from Cologne, so I don't have much actual experience to go on. Poured with a nice white head that mostly fades and no lace. Color is a bright yellow gold. Aroma is a slightly spicy, fruity, hoppy, and beery. Flavor's about the same; slightly bittersweet. I do pick up a faint hint of metallic others have noted. Almost a soft body. Good clean finish. Excellent session beer."
"I have a business associate in Leverkusen (just outside of Koln) who maintains that Gaffel is a poor example of Kolsch beer (he prefers Fruh and Reissdorf). But I have to respectfully disagree, Gaffel is extremely good to me."
"Like I said: Good beer. Grab one; they're cheap! Now, if I can find it on tap some place, or by the 6 or 12..."
"i'd had this and reissdorf head to head both from 5L mini-kegs. if it weren't for the glasses, i'm not sure i could exactly tell the difference between them. they're not exactly the same, but i think i like them about the same."
"Overall, a pretty refreshing kolsch- this can be a nice summer change-up from the usual hefe weizens and pale wheats."
"Overall a pretty damn good Kolsch. This is the only real one I've seen in the states besides Reissdorf. I'd recommend a try."
"Note: This brewery's website is pretty cool. Click on the Union Jack / American Flag icon at the upper right hand corner for english."
"Overall- Tasty and refreshing. A good warm weather beer."
"D: A very sessionable Kolsch that is well-rounded and crisp. As noted before, it could use a little more character, but all in all a fine beer that I could see myself drinking plenty of if they were within arm's reach."
"(rated Aug 1, 2007)"
"I'm not a big fan of Koelsch and would pass on most, but Gaffel is quite different. This beer has more body as opposed to the other Koelsch beers that taste like watery pilseners. It pours a clean golden body with almost no smell whatsoever, but is easy to consumer and again, is more full-bodied than most Koelsch."
"M&D: clean, refreshing, light-bodied, well-made but not extremely exciting; all in all, a very well-made bier ticking all the boxes for a quality Kölsch, and a rather understated one at the same time."
"This beer poured a clear yellow with a fluffy single-finger head. The smell has some grass and grains in it, maybe a little straw. The taste is very light and starts off with some grains and citrusy grapefruit that finishes pretty cleanly. The mouthfeel is a little watery, but the carbonation brings it all together for a very crisp feeling. This is a nice drinkable beer, I wouldn't mind having a couple more."
"Smells of a light straw. Clean refreshing taste and light. A Kölsch solid but not wonderful. Very drinkable fits well with the warm weather. Can't ask for much more when just stepping off the train."
"3.5 D: Decent taste that isn't at all boring (though not the best). Problem for drinkability comes from mouthfeel. Smoothen this bitch up."
"D: It's crisp, refreshing, and perky, with a light body. Definitely sessionable, with a surprisingly refreshing taste."
"D: Drinkability was good, clean, crisp making for a good example for style and one to check out."
"Decent but nothing special. Refreshing, great for a hot summer day."
"Pours a light straw colored body with a large white head. Aroma is mildly sweet with grainy, grassy and a weird faint metallic smell. Flavor is grassy, grains, citrus and very light spice. Light bodied, thin texture. This would have been rated much higher if not for the faint metallic aroma."
"Textbook refreshing crispness and outstanding drinkability."
"D - Drinkability is pretty good. This is a no frills easy drinking beer that could easily be consumed en masse. Comes across as bland in some respects but still refreshing. Would be good on a hot day in the sun."
"Light body, with just enough carbonation to liven things up. Very easy to drink. Not bad at all."
"Fairly drinkable, but probably my least favorite of this style."
"Pours a bright, clear yellow with a fluffy head and streamers of carbonation. This is a nice looking beer. It has a strong, clean honey aroma, exactly as a Kolsch should deliver. The flavor is crisp, grainy with a pleasant hint of bitterness. There is, however, a slightly grape-like character to the beer that is slightly off-putting. The mouthfeel is light and refreshing. This is an easy-drinking beer."
"Mouth feel speaking, this brew is like a lager all the way through. I can see what the style is all about in this brew."
"Having said all of that, I am now curious to try some other Kolsch beers."
"D - exceptional sample of the style, easy drinking and excellent tasting brew."
"Drinkable but not remarkable."
"Mouthfeel was prickly in the beginning but finished smooth."
"D - Quite drinkable but I wouldn't seek it out. Superb hot weather beer."
"Tasted on 6/16/08."
"Wow, incredibly easy drinker!!"
"Very drinkable, flavorful without being overpowering. Refreshing."
"D - Smooth and refreshing, kolsches are quickly becoming one of my favorite summer styles. Very easy drinking, but still features quite a bit of flavor."
"Honestly, I don't like beers that trick me into thinking they will be nice and malty and then cut off my enjoyment with an unexpected hop bite. It's pretty easy to drink but the conflicting characters of the beer don't sit well with me."
"A pint plus bottle of Gaffel Kolsch. Pours light straw golden color topped with a big white cap of foam. Definite pale malt in the nose, hay and straw, also a hint of hops. Light on the palate, slightly dry. The taste is similar to the nose. Crisp clean malt flavors and a slight hop bitterness at the end. Very good refreshing beer."
"A good summer time beer that was refreshing and easy to drink... Not heavy on flavor, but a good depiction of the style nonetheless..."
"Appears a pale yellow hue with a slight haze overcasting the brilliant golden color large white head with fine even lacing formed after each sip. Aroma contains strong herbal German noble hops with a mild fruity malt flow going on, slightly metallic with some harder water used in brewing. Flavor is a crisp combo of lightly toasted malts and herbal lemongrass tinted hops. Mouthfeel is light bodied with a dry finish, moderate carbonation level really gets across the palate well. Overall drinkability this would get boring if it were your only beer option but it's a nice mix up from the typical American micro brew."
"D - Nice Kolsch... I'm a fan of the style and found this quite enjoyable..."
"Very clear and a pale straw yellow with a meager white cap. Mild aroma, mostly malt with a bit of hops and a light fruity quality. Low bitterness, mostly sweet malt flavour with light fruit and hops. Finished clean. Slightly higher than average carbonation with a light body. Refreshing and tasty, though the flavour and aroma were merely average compared to other kolsch beers that I've had."
"Pours crystal clear and pale straw in color. The type of beer you'll never see your reflection in and makes your fingers look really big on the other side of the glass. I'm watching TV through it as I consider this. Steady, quick rising carbonation. A head that falls a little short. Smell is just uneventful. Not much going on here. Grains, not so clean though. Kind of an ashy skunky smell that reminds me of Stella or something. Sweet malt and light hop presence. Taste is much of the same. Near overwhelming sweetness up front, almost puckering. Very crisp feel, kind of snappy on the tongue. Gets more dry from what I feel to be a very bready finish, almost absorbing on the tongue. It's decent. Funny how a couple of the American versions I've tried seem much more interesting and comlex while this is pretty bland. This sixer wasn't cheap, either."
"A good pils, not shure about kolsch."
"Very drinkable, and I imagine this would be a great beer for a hot August night. I will try this again in some time."
"Drinkability : a good beer in the German Kolsch style."
"Opinion: This is a pretty good beer. The balance is a little surprising how the beer seems almost like it may be cloyingly sweet only to find out that the bittering hops are playing such a big role in the flavor. I would certainly like to try a fresher example of this beer...especially in a BierGarten in Koln."
"D = This would be a decent beer on a hot afternoon. Not sure I would use it for much more than that, but that should be enough shouldn't it?"
"D: This is one of the easiest drinking beers that I have had. It is like a clean and dry pilsner."
"Pours one of the palest straw colors I've had in a long time with a half inch of big bubbly white head and brilliant clarity. A good amount of bright fruits in the aroma, slight spiciness, and a slight hop note, but that's it; very mild overall. On the palate, it is very smooth and soft with a bit of pils malt, no toastiness, and some slight ester notes. Hop flavor is quite low with a nondiscript bitterness towards the crisp, dry finish. Body is medium low with moderately high carbonation. A little bit more body than a pilsner, but less hop presence. Overall, an easy drinker and a thirst quencher, but I'd rather see some more Noble hop character."
"D- This has a nice malty grainy quality with an excellent creamy finish, making this an easy drinking moreish Kolsh"
"This brew is as smooth as a baby's butt, slides down nice and easy - one fine tasty kolsch. Will not have a problem going back for a sixer during the hot summer."
"This is a throwing beer, get it down as quickly as possible and get something else. I have drank it on tap in Berlin and it was better than the bottle I've just had. This is not a great Kolsch, I have in fact failed to find one that is yet."
"The crisp and refreshing taste as well as sturdy body and balance amounts to a very good beer. The purity of German beers continues to amaze me."
"Why is the cap an American flag? Is it because this was bottled for U.S consumption?"
"Once the bartender poured it, the appearance was above average, perhaps due to the Gaffel glassware with the 0.5L line on the glass. The smell was about average while the taste was above average. This may have been the only Kolsh style beer that I have drank up to this point, but so far it is my favorite."
"Bottle at our Septoberfest party. Pours a light yellow-gold color with a medium white head that burns off rather quickly. Spotty lacing. Lightly woody hops and malt in this nose. Light, clean body with equal parts hops and malt, with touches of fruit and spice. The finish is mildly bitter with a lightly spiced hops aftertaste. Slightly above average."
"Drinkability: Simply atrocious!"
"An easy-drinking refreshing brew. I do give it credit for the dose of hops and the dryness. Overall - not exciting by any means, and very mild, this is fitting for the style."
"This is light yet medium-bodied, with a crisp carbonation that seems appropriate. This is not my favorite style, but this is a refreshing beer and worth a try for sure."
"On-tap at Mr. Goodbar. Pale yellow with a thin head, and a bit of lace. Medium plus mouthfeel. Refreshing although not overwhelming, above average carbonation. Initial astringency that becomes malted away, but detracts. A tad of fruit and not outstanding in being flavourful or drinkable,"
"I guess this is the standard."
"This beer poured a clear straw color and formed a nice foamy egg white head that left latticed lace as it slowly subsided. A medium amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, hops, grain/yeast and some floral aspects. The flavor was of malt, hops and grain/yeast. The body is fairly light with a nice crisp finish to it with a hint of bittnerness. Only second German kolsch I have tried, but so far the better of the two."
"It's cool to get an actual Kolsch from Koln, but it's a shame it had to travel from Koln - you can taste it. The off flavors and aromas are metallic with corn in the nose. The big flavor is a light and mellow malt body with a crisp and spicy hop. Quite nice, but I'd like to try it at the source."
"D: Easy drinking and nothing I found offensive, which is good considering I dont care much for this style. If you like kölsch, then this one is worth a try."
"D: Lagers normally have a lighter body that makes drinking another easy, but not all have perfected the subtlety of lager flavor, and the ability to balance the delicate nature of these beers. This Kolsch is a great example of that, and I would recommend Gaffel to those who are looking for a flavorful and light lager."
"D-A wonderful warm weather beer, truly sessionable."
"Drinkability: Fine example of the style and a great crossover beer"
"This beer was light crisp, and very refreshing. It had a bright clear golden color with little aroma. Flavor was light, somewhat crisp, with a bit of metallic-ness at the finish. Mouthfeel was very light, and I felt this beer could have benefited from additional carbonation. Not bad, but just a light refreshment; not a real serious beer."
"While the style isn't packed with flavor, its a very nice relaxing brew. An excellent example of the style, and actually tasted almost just as fresh here in the states as when I was in Koeln."
"Also, the owner from Shangy's awarded me with a proper gaffel kolsch glass with my purchase."
"I will not uy again though."
"Poured into a Kolsch glass golden, clear, with a stark white head, good lacing. The nose was light floral hoppiness with some fresh grain and faint lemon citrus aroma.The taste is crisp, light, grainy, and slightly bitter, but finishes smooth. Has a light body and crisp mouthfeel. Not a great beer, but a great example of the style, and immensely dirnkable."
"Crystal clear pale gold with sparse, gentle carbonation. Initially, there is a two finger pure white head which quickly settles to a soapy cap. Light, breezy aroma...grainy and perfume-like. Lightly fruity flavor with a gentle slick sweetness over grain. Slight zestiness. Light, crisp, and thirst quenching yet still manages to be entertaining."
"Good and worth my time."
"A pretty tasty kolsch, little bit dull but not bad overall"
"D: Very drinkable. Have through your meal and keep going."
"Never really had much interest in this style until I saw a travel channel special on Köln, featuring, of courseKolsch. I saw Gaffel in my local beer store so I pick up two 20 oz bottles. After trying to decide whether I liked it, I had already finished half of the glass. The beer pours a beautiful golden yellow with a thick initial head. The flavor struck me as unusual at first as the beer was sweet, but with a distinctive, biting hops. The beer is crisp with a nice fruity, floral finish. This will never be my favorite style but this beer was a great compliment to the wood grilled haddock I prepared."
"D= too boring to keep my interest; very disappointing."
"Pours an incredibly clear yellow gold (I can watch TV through it) with a thick bright white head that fades to a tenacious dusting. Aromas of cooking grains and slight fruits; it's a slight aroma, but very enticing for the style. On the tongue, smooth at first, before yielding to sharp carbonation. Flavors are mostly not fermentation derived, but clean and crisp, with light malts leading the way, followed by a finish marked by snappy hops. Overall, this is a very good kolsch, with smooth flavors but a bit of depth in a style that usually doens't have a helluva lot of depth."
"The varaiations between different varieties of kölsch is comparatively wide for such a limited range of brands. The good ones are refreshingly hoppy and citric while the bad ones are just watery and tasteless. Kölsch works best for me when it is served chilled. Gaffel definately belongs to the good ones and is my personal favorite. It pours with a nice golden color, fizzy and with good head. It smells flowery hops and citrus. The taste is bitter with a flash of apples and a citric bite at the end. In all I think it's a good beer but the style is a bit limited and does not quite measure up to Czech and German pils."
"First Kölsch but it's a good one. Clear straw yellow with a fizzy head, with a smell like German hops (excellent). The taste is similar, with a light vinous malt flavor and an herbal, grassy hop character that I really enjoy. Good beer, not amazing, but as far as what I'm led to believe a Kölsch should be, this stacks up very well."
"An understated style that is very appropriate for warm weather. Refreshing and easy to drink, a classic example of the style."
"Crisp taste, slightly hoppy, crisp and dry. Floral and lightly spicy with a smattering of wild honey in the background to give some sweet maltyness. Tastes like it smells. That is definately a good thing. Light body with medium carbonation. Drinking this on July 3 after doing yardwork for a few hours, a 12 oz. ""sample"" definately wasn't enough. Very drinkable and enjoyable. A very nice example of the kolsch style."
"Cheers!"
"An amazingly true-to-style beer. Quite complex and intellegent in its subtleties. Very lightly flavored, but the flavors range from green apples to kiwi, from pilsner malts to wheat, from tea-like to noble hops. The body is even smooth and with a light minty feel. Whisps away quickly and powdery. A sparkling clear straw with a fluffy withstanding head retention. Must be sampled with a very clean palate and an anylitical mindset to appreciate the brew. A very difficult brew to get right."
"I hesitate to use the word watery, but this beer seemed to have ample room to move around my mouth without leaving behind too much flavor. For the flavors that were present, this seemed to work quite well making this crisp and easy to drink."
"PROST! Beertracker"
"Taste: The light carbonation makes it almost creamy on my palate. For the style, the body has quite a bit of legs to it, but with a dry, refreshing finish. Never had a real gravity-poured Kolsch in Koln, I bet it's better than this, but this Beer wasn't bad at all, especially on the patio on a warm Sunday afternoon."
"A very drinkable beer. While not the best kolsch I have had, certainly representative of the style."
"Gaffel Kolsch pours a golden yellow with a thick, fluffy, white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. Not much aroma, perhaps a little citrus. Not exactly what I expected, having only had American versions of kolsch. Much more subdued citrus flavor than some micros I've tried. Perhaps a touch of lemon peel in the finish, but that's it. After a few minutes I'm definitely tasting citrus. I'm not sure I like this one, I don't really dislike it either. It's just kind of mediocre. Not worth seeking out, worth a try."
"Medium-light body with a mild carbonation level endures this one in the mouth and is followed by a moderately dry finish. Gaffel's kölsch is a well-made brew that considers its ingredients with respect and does not overindulge in any of them. The low alcohol level and mild flavors make this a good session brew or a non-heavy, refreshing spring/summer beer."
"Fragrant hops on the nose. Taste, at first a little sweetness followed by the hops and alcohol follows behind. Has a clean yeasty taste and moderate carbonation with a slight bitterness at the end. I haven't had the pleasure of drinking many of this style, but I will again after trying this one. It is a very easy drinking beer, if it had just slightly less carbonation it would probably be perfect."
"This kolsch is a hallmark of the style. Pours a pale gold yellow with a thick head that lasts till the end. Brought over from germany, this beer is oneof the finer kolschs i've had to date. Much better than BJ's. Slightly bitter with low hop levels. I could drink alot of these."
"D - Very drinkable, best Cologne Kölsch I've had in the US."
"Overall - A pretty good Kolsch.... very drinkable. Worth a try..."
"12 oz. with no freshness date - served chilled in a nonic. Pours a clear bright gold that is lively and has some carbonation streams coming to the top to the 2 finger white head that has minimal lace but leaves a thin blanket. It has a soft spicy/metallic/buttery aroma and a mild flavor that is crisp and refreshing like a lager. There are grainy and some toasted malts, a bit of a vinous character, and some grassy/spicy hops that seem metallic at times and leave a low level of bitterness. The body is medium, tingly on the tounge, yet quite smooth. This is good but would be better/more drinkable if it were less expensive."
"Drink it if you want another notch on your belt, but that's about the only solid reason I can think of."
"""Kölsch"" is a somewhat funny beer type, looks like a Lager, but indeed is an filtered Ale ... the taste is somewhat between the Lager and Ale, from the latter it has it's fruitiness (top fermenting yeasts), but it is usually 'drier' than most Lagers ... this one is a particularly dry Kölsch, with a spicy and nutty taste and also a pleasant bitterness ..."
"Gaffel Kolsch is an enjoyable beer. I like the fact that it isn't afraid to lay on the hops and lay off the sweetness. I've never tasted anything quite like it, so points must be assigned for originality. It would make a great summertime session beer as long as there was a lot of cold water handy to counter the impressive dryness."
"Pours a clear bright golden with a fluffy white head that leaves some lacing in my glass, bready and fruity aromas. Apple, lemon and bready flavors. Medium bodied with a crisp and carbonated mouthfeel, finishes clean and dry, this one really hits the spot on a hot day."
"Drinkability and Overall: My first stab at a true Kolsch, and it's not bad. I enjoy it, but there's not enough subtle complexity for me. The only thing I didn't particularly enjoy was that fake malt taste, and it's killing the drinkability for me. Other than that, not bad stuff at all."
"Pours a light golden color with a finger of white head and a small amount of lacing. Smell is a grainy malt with a a slight and not unpleasant metallic note. Taste is nice and simple--a clean maltiness followed by a medium hop finish and a slightly mineral/metallic aftertaste, which I would usually hate but seems to work with this style. The beer has an extremely dry moutfheel and a moderately high level of carbonation, and once again this works great with the style. This a great example of a Kolsh--extremely drinkable and refreshing, if not particularly exciting."
"I had only ever tried one Kölsch previous to drinking this one, and I did not really enjoy that Kölsch. TYhat beer had the bitter, metallic taste of a Heinieclone, and I had written off the Kölsch style as a pilsner wannabe. This beer convinced me that I was wrong about Kölsch. This beer was pale yellow with a mild head. Looked like a pretty standard beer. However, it had a distinctive taste. It's hard to explain, other than to say that it was light on hops and had an overall pleasant taste. This would be the perfect hot day beer if only it weren't so expensive ($8.50 for a 6 pack). This beer has completely changed my mind about Kölsch, and I'm going to give that other Kölsch (Reisdorf Kölsch) another try. Maybe it was skunked, or maybe it was simply inferior. Regardless, Gaffel Kölsch is a quality beer, and is certainly not a Heinieclone."
"Time for a road trip to Germany!"
"The beer I had was nice and fresh, with a light golden color and a lively, spritzy carbonation that produce the slightest of heads. The nose is not huge, a kind of metallic herbalness. The taste is crisp and clean, steely with other mineral notes, like a good German riesling, that softens into Granny smith apples with a touch of lemon juice, and perhaps some herb like thyme. The finish ends as it begins, with that steely character coming back into a bone-dry palate cleansing deliciousness. Mouthfeel reveals lively carbonation, a little thin, but what would you expect for this style. Drinakability is high -- I could suck three or four of these imperial pint bottles down on one hot summer night. A classic that I would LOVE to have in its home country."
"A dumb but pleasant beer in my opinion."
"Crisp and clean hop beginning, smooth toasty malt underneath and a dry finish. Nicely balanced, no false notes, pretty classic. The plentiful carbonation gives a pleasant mouthfilling fizz with each sip. A mild herbal hop bitterness returns in the aftertaste. Very drinkable and refreshing."
"Pours a nice shimmering light golden topped with a blooming,fluffy head that sticks to the glass as it settles,very fruit scented of some green apple mainly with a touch of iron very pleasant.Very delicate flavors some of that green apple along with lightly toasted grain and iron.Very food-friendly went well with some fresh bratwurst and weiss wurst with some my mother- in- laws potato pancakes,infinently drinkable."
"Pours crystal clear with a golden, straw color. Would have liked a little more of a head. Smell is clean with a hint of noble hops. The taste is dry with an assertive noble hop flavor. This beer is very good, it might benefit from a little more vienna/munich flavor. Carbonation is hig, as the style calls for. I prefer Kolsch (rare as it is) on draft where it less fizzy. A little more sour taste is good, shouldn't be as clean as a lager. This is another tasty beer."
"Thank you Mr. Ueda for this gift."
"Drinkability: Not bad. Although not totally excited about finding another one."
"kolsch flavor that really locks in the toasty malt flavor and a nice grain flavor. Finishes very crisp and clean like a kolsch should. Light and delightful, quite a nice example of the style."
"Best before 07-04. Poors in good with quiet a good head thats white in lasting ok. Light golden color a cristal clear make it a good appearance. Nose is clean, quiet empty and fruity with a hint of hops. Taste is malty, watery and having somehow an iron taste that makes bitterness hanging. Cause the beer is quiet empty this iron taste is not that enjoyable and influences mouthfeel negativly. Fruityness makes some up and not a bad beer but had better Koelsch."
"My quest for the essence of Kolsch continues. Poured into a Collins glass. Beauty golden yellow, similar to an american adjunct lager, but brighter. Plenty of large and small bubbles that create a large foamy head. This had a fine pilsener nose, both grassy and malty. Taste was crisp and malty. Light mouthfeel, but that is expected. Very easy to drink. Nice replacement for light lagers. Give this one to the reluctant macro drinker to take a baby step toward having a little hops in their beer."
"This is a pretty good-looking brewcompletely clear, pale yellow colored liquid with a billowing, soft white headConstantly streaming CO2 bubbles and nice tufts of lace. The smell is hoppy and grainy with a slightly fruity (citric), almost acidic trait. Its a moderately dry beer, with a little astringency and a crisp, abrupt finish. This ones very light, easy to drink, and pretty tasty. On the downside, although its very drinkable, its also not very exciting."
"Appearance is pretty much your standard macro lager appearance - I couldn't tell this apart from a budweiser ... perhaps a tad darker. The head dies quick and there is minimal carbonation. Aroma is of skunky type hops with a little grain in the background, and that's about it here. Very clean tasting. The carbonation, soft mouthfeel and german hops all meld together to make a very refreshing brew. GReat mouthfeel and drinkability."
"Overall Impression - As a homebrewer I am very impressed with the craftmanship behind this well made beer. It is well balanced and thirst quenching and highly drinkable."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"A nice tasty brew, all the makings of a great summer refresher."
"The beer pours a pale yellow color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is clean and crisp with a pale malts and a fruity yeast scent. The taste is good. It has a smooth pale malt flavor that goes down easy with a slight bitterness and a clean finish. There is a bit of fruitiness in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is good. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a damn fine Kolsch. It holds true to style and drinks brilliantly."
"Gaffel Kolsch comes right out of the town of Koln (which guarantees its authenticity); and also happens to be one of the best examples available in the U.S. right now. It pours a crystal clear yellow-gold body beneath a massive head of fluffy bright-white foam that slowly receeds to a thin collar and whispy surface covering. Some initial splashes of lace are left at the start of the glass, but there's not much beyond that. Still, it's quite attractive. The nose delivers a beautiful combination of grainy malt and herbal, floral, and spicy hops as well as a splash of yeasty fruitiness. The body is decidedly medium and it's very fine, moderate carbonation lends a gentle zest to the tongue. The flavor delivers pretty much exactly what the nose promises with a beautifully balanced symphony of very lightly sweet but distinctly grainy malt woven throughout with threads of floral, spicy and herbal hops. A solid bitterness balances it superbly; and it finishes with a swirl of hop flavor and a drying bitterness that leaves you ready for another sip. It's an incredibly drinkable beer that balances a ""lighter"" quality with a good amount of complexity; and when teamed with the fact that it has a relatively subdued alcohol content of 4.8%, it's a most impressive session ale. One of the best! And if you want to understand what the Kolsch style is all about, this is the one to try!"
"Interesting beer. Clear and golden, the white head left quickly. Aroma is low, and almost apple cidery-like. Taste comes with several components: intially you get a crisp, German pils like taste. What follows next is more medium mouthfeel, again, apples being the predominant taste. The beer finishes with a traditional malty/breadyness. Easy to drink, would make a good session beer."
"4,8%. Clear pale straw colored with white fluffy head that dies down to a thin layer of foam in a couple minutes. Bready and spicy with a yeasty nose. Bottlecap opened with a pop, indicating good carbonation which gives it a clean and crisp taste, yet maintaining a light feel. Once you have a couple of sips, it gets a bit astringent in the finish, like hops but not. Earthy. Very light and easily drinkable. I hate to cliche it as a lawnmower beer, but it is one and it's good one."
"Quite good for a bottled version of the style."
"Pours a brilliantly clear pale straw color. It is topped by a fluffy off-white head that is kept afloat by a medium level of carbonation. Spicy aroma with grainy malt notes, and perhaps a hint of lemon. Nice clean profile, and finishes with a bit more biting bitterness than I was expecting. Light and refreshing, and is spot on for a Kolsch. Not really my cup of tea though, just a bit too simple and clean to hold my interest for long."
"Yet another authentic Kölsch makes its way to America. This is almost straw-colored and pours with a head that falls flat. The aroma is neutral to slightly malty; none of the minerally aroma of Reissdorf is present. A very light and delicate ale which makes it very appropriate for summer. As the beer warms up I catch a slight toasted, yet juicy malt flavor. The finish is dry and bitter enough for the style. Overall, a nice light ale for summer quaffing, but not as complex as other examples."
"Poured out a clear yellow/gold color with some nice carbonation visible, also stayed with you for a while. Smell consisted of light hops, a little musty at times as well, and some grassy notes. Taste was alright. Bready, malty at times, and some hops show their muscle as well in this beer. Hops have a little bite to them at the end which almost makes you think this is a German Pils, but not quite so. It's crisp and somewhat clean as well. This could make for an ideal session beer."
"This beer poured a light golden color with a lot of carbonation, forming a large head. There was little aroma except for a slightly grainy malt smell. The taste is a slightly hoppy, malty taste that tastes very different but okay.The mouthfeel is bubbly and clean. For my first try of this style, it wasn't bad. Not great, but okay."
"I had this on tap at Cogans Instant Art Bar in Norfolk Virginia. Presented in a tulip glass this beer was a light golden color with a good-sized white head. The head stuck around for a while and left a decent lacing as this was consumed. The aroma was focused around grains with a slight citrus lemon scent and a mild spice as well. The Flavor was bready with mild earthy hop notes. A clean crisp taste that is refreshing is what you got here. Mouthfeel was light with good carbonation and this is very drinkable. Overall a decent beer that would be ideal for warm weather."
"Pours with a fluffy, billowing white head over clear light golden yellow liquid. Grassy lightly malty nose with some delicate hop presence. Light bodied maltiness and crisp and somewhat sharp hoppiness...that's about all there is as far as taste components. Finishes light, spritzy and dry. A very good hot weather beater due to it's low alcohol/lightness of body. Well done."
"."
"Ultra pale and yellowy gold in color. Looks very clean and clear and has a soft carbonation. The aroma yields some lemony sourness and crisp and grassy grains. Also has a touch of stale breadiness. The taste is dry and pretty clean. Light in body but has some character to it. Finishes light and crisp with a pleasant sour tang. This is an easy drinking, light and golden German Ale. Not much bad to say about this beer. Just nice overall."
"Bright golden in color with brilliant, foamy, white head that leaves a creamy layer after the head drops. The nose is a nice mix of pale, dry malt and grassy hops that are ever-so-slightly floral. Hop bitterness is mainly right up front followed by a clean dry breadiness. A very light fruitiness comes out on the otherwise dry finish. Nearly perfect carbonation and body for the style. Great mouth feel!"
"It pours a very clear pale straw color with a good white head. The aroma is slightly fruity. The body id firm, but light with some nuttiness to it. It finishes crisp and dry with flowery hop tastes. A nice refreshing beer that I could drink all day long."
"Zum wohl!"
"16.9 ounce bottle. I was excited to find another Kolsch available in the US."
"The taste is considerably wheaty which adds to the body as a whole, enhancing the beer itself as it combines with a nice balanced bitterness at the end. no other significant things to it."
"Drinkability  This was a wonderful interpretation of the style."
"It has an appearance that greatly resembles Miller High Life. The head quickly fizzles away, not a good Kölsch characteristic. Though no adjucts are used one cant help from expecting an on-rush of corn and sugar like flavors at first sip. Surprisngly that doesnt happen. In fact, not much happens to your tongue. Its flavorless except for a light hop note. As it's not very flavorful it gets boring fast. A few words of advice--If you are in Köln and see a sign for Gaffel, move on, theres alot better out there."
"Gaffel is as fine an example of the Kölch style around. By all appearances it looks to be a thin and weak beer, but it has a surprisingly ample body and is fantastically gulpable. The hoppy aroma dissipates rapidly so catch it early. There's an abundance of hops which balance nicely with the malt about halfway through the glass. Nice white head doesn't last too long (could have been that I drank it from a pint glass instead of something like a Pilsner glass)."
"Another fantastic kolsch. Very nice malty/hop character, light gold colour, little lasring head, floral hop pressence, quite dryish and huuuuugely great to have as session beer."
"A brief stop in Köln and just enough time for a few photos of the Cathedral (heavily damaged by Allied bombing during WWII), lunch and, you guessed right, a beer. And what better choice than the local Kölsch bier? A lovely, crisp, light, refreshing treat it was. I love the dedicated glassware for serving beer in many places in Europe. It really adds to the experience. Crystal clear straw color, light biscuity malt, mildly spicey hop aroma and flavor. The perfect brew to accompany a meal, plenty good enough to stand on its own."
