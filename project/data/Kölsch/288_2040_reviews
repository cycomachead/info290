"I am quite impressed by this brew! A wonderful fruity taste that has a nice hops bite that balances it out just about perfectly. The feel is beyond smooth. It is so refreshing and drinkable, I could swirl it inside my mouth forever. I could have like ten of these on a hot summer day. Too bad I only bought one. Will get again!"

"O -   Interesting kolsch, wondering the age, but other than oft smell, recommended."

"Reissdorf Kolsch is a great example of a Kolsch.  The flavor is perfect and is matched by the color.  The beer was poured from a bottle into a pint glass.   Can't go wrong with this beer."

"A classic for a reason, me thinks."

"O – Everything about this beer is mild, and that’s a compliment.  Light body, light aroma, light flavor, all in harmony.  An excellent session beer, would taste wonderful on the porch after the first mow of the spring."
""
""
""
""
""

"This is a delightful Kolsch, full of flavor and with a nice clean finish. Appearance-wise it looks like a pilsener but once you place under your nose you immediately realize it's a Kolsch (and a good one in fact). Probably my favorite example of this beer style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste / Palate: The flavor matches the aroma but with the light bready/cracker like maltiness up front and the hops finishing up. Overall it’s fairly clean and crisp. It finishes dry and the palate is light and refreshing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: One of my favorite examples of this style, Reissdorf Kolsch is usually a very good value. I am usually able to find it for $3 to $4 for a 500ml bottle."
"O: Clean and crisp and refreshingly simple."

"05/15/12 On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. Nice & Clean with a full body. Good taste."

"Really good beer. Easy going down. Expensive; Mellow had it at $1.32/oz"
""
""

"O: easy-drinking and certainly good enough to enjoy, but not overwhelmingly good enough at the price (almost 18 cents per ounce) to justify drinking this much -- for my tastes, there are lots of better German brews available. would be a perfect gateway beer to wean somebody off the macros. for a grainy brew, it's solid."

"This was my introduction to this style, and I have to say I rather like it. I would say this particular beer is very smooth, light bodied, and refreshing, like a good lager beer, but with enough yeasty and hoppy complexity to keep it interesting. A good choice for hot weather when you want some flavor too. Well worth the sampling at 4-something for a pint-plus bottle. Keep it up Hennessey Grocery!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This is basically a German pilsner but brewed with ale yeast. It has many taste similarities to it's lager counterpart but with a more pronounced fruity note I suspect from the ale yeast. I wish this stuff could be found on more tap lists."
""
""
"Probably the best Kolsch I've had the pleasure of drinking."

"Overall: This beer is refreshing and simply delightful. It is a wonderful, relaxing drinking beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: it's a more or less perfect example of the style. Kolsch beers are obviously fairly limited in scope. They do what they do and do it well. Pretty much the perfect session beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A simple yet well crafted beer. Biscuity malt is prevalent with some fruitiness to add a bit of complexity. Really easy beer to sit back, relax, and just enjoy."

"Taste is crisp and malty with a light floral hop flavor. Everything comes together really nice and smooth here, a hell of a drinker. I couldnt imagine something else combining the refreshing qualities with full flavor like a good koelsch, and this one does it very well. Not as much yeast presence as I would like to see, but other than that it is top-notch."
""
"This beer is perfect for a sunny day like today, round with excellent drinkability and not as “boring” as some Kolsch, you can feel its hops drying your palate forcing you to the next sip. If I would judge it just among Kolsch, I would have given higher grades."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours out a bright golden straw color with a thin whisp of head. Trying to pull more out of the nose, but it's faint. Pale malts and a touch of grain. Taste is about the same. No off tastes whatsoever, but I'm having a hard time picking things out in the flavor. Mouthfeel is light and crisp. This is, far and away, ahead of all of the poor American kolsch attempts I've tried, but I'd take a Sunner over this any day of the week."
""
"O: My first Kolsch and pretty much what I expected. Pretty plain, simple and goes down like water. This is what the BMCs/summer session beers of the world SHOULD be."

"Poured into a sam adams glass, great pure white head developed which was thick and creamy in appearance, great retention and good lacing. Appearance was a clear, golden straw color. Aroma was mild with notes of grain and grass. Taste was clean and smooth with grain and mild hop flavors. Mouthfeel was medium to full with a dry and clean aftertaste. Great beer."

""
""
"O: This is the measuring stick by which all other Kolsch beers should be judged. Flawlessly brewed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a classic Kolsch, and required drinking for anybody interested in the style."
""
"O- Good, clean, and crisp."
"O: Good representative of this very mild style beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The very epitome of a German session beer. Not my favorite style, but a fine example of the style nonetheless."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"M & O- Moderately high carbonation. Initially dry & somewhat flat w/sweet finish. Very well balanced. I want more!"
""
""
""
"To the Point: a true Kolsch; drink it fast for the flavors break down fairly quick as it warms; I would buy this again;"
""
""
""
"O: Just as I said, I bought this not expecting a top-caliber kolsch, but wondering how good this could still be after being on the shelf for over a year. It's held up enough to where it's still a competent (if unimpressive) example of the style. I plan on re-reviewing this."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Objectively speaking, the beer appears to be true to style. Subjectively speaking, this is a beer with a mineral quality and an astringency that I just can't get behind. Reminds me of a cheap light lager. Of course, 'm sure if I was in Germany and was having a fresh bottle, I'd be happier with this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A very interesting beer that has you putting your nose in the glass several times. Things were evolving, showing new facets, and developing all the way to the bottom of the glass."
""
"Pours straw gold with a tall head of thick white foam that fell slowly leaving lots of lace behind and a cap and ring. Exceptional clarity and brilliance. Nose has a good sour bite from the yeast up first then a clean and mildly fruity smell. Apples and some faint spice. Pale malt with a honey sweetness. Light grain. Earthy. Taste is perfection. Refreshing with the apple as it comes over the palate fruity and sweet with plenty of smooth bread underneath. A touch of floral and even a little mint. The body is feather light and smooth. It 's supple and rich. There is a deep earthy quality to the malt that I find spectacular in it's straightforward simplicity. It's dry overall and leaves with a touch of pine and a small bitter. There's no lingering aftertaste except for the taste of minerals. It's superbly clean. Very refreshing and a stellar example of the style."

"O - An excellent Kolsch. Pure and true to its heritage. You can't help but feel this is what many domestic brewers have attempted to copy. Drinkability is excellent."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Malty grains in the nose with a sort of hay-ness that crosses over into the first sip. Crisp with bitter tea-like astringency and and a little peachy. I feel like the constellations of ingredients are aligned in this Kölsch perfectly. Wish I could find it in 6 packs."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Lighter bodied brisk carbonation faintly fruity upfront, Apple's pears and citrus rind, herbal earthy hop backing cuts clean and dry. Nice malt body clean and crisp, goes well with mild cheeses."
""
"O: A well balanced Kölsch. Very easy to drink, especiall today - a warm summers day."
"The richness and balance of flavor is truly superb. The color is brilliantly light yellow with a nice head, and the flavor/aroma is full of rich grain and smooth hops. High carbonation and light body. The drinkability is perfect. A very fine example of a Kolsch and really, awesome brewing in general ."
""
""
"O - Between the bold fruit attributes of this Kölsch and it's softer Bohemian pilsner-like feel, this Kölsch exemplifies the difference each brewery has for this style but I personally enjoy the more crisp, clean versions a little more."
""
"O: Hard to find fault, balanced, crisp, reasonable depth."
""
""
""
""
""
"500 ml bottle into pint glass, no bottle dating. Pours fairly crystal clear golden straw color with a 2 finger dense white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of lemon, pear, apple, pepper, floral, grass, cracker, bready grain, and floral earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and strength of malt, hop, and light yeast ester notes; very clean. Taste of lemon, pear, apple, floral, pepper, grass, cracker, bready grain, and floral earthiness. Lingering notes of light fruits, floral, grass, light pepper, bread, and light earthiness on the finish for a bit. Great flavor balance of malt, hop, and light fruitiness; with an extremely clean flavor profile and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and crisp mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent Kolsch! Great clean and balanced flavor profile, with plenty of flavor for 4.8%; and extremely smooth to drink. A highly enjoyable offering."
"O- Not bad at all. It has a very refreshing taste and goes great with a warm sunny day."

"Overall (3.5): Though most of my categorical scores were 4.0, I feel like this one only deserves a 3.5. Everything is solid but it seems to be a bit underwhelming."
""
"I imagine on tap the mouthfeel would be far better, or in a newer bottle. Great beer, great light taste. Basically a pilsner ale."
""
""
""
""
"Reissdorf Kolsch is a very easy drinker that before you realize you have consumed the entire bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not a huge fan of Kolsch but this was by far the best I have tried. Wouldn’t grab it again but glad I tried it."

"Purchased at the Wine Source in Baltimore, MD."
"Dang, I want more of this. Multiple pints, please."
"O: Fine quality. I'd love another. Great warm day beer. I'd buy 6 of these."
""
"This is a very easy to drink beer. I recommend it for the last outdoor occasions until you have to put your shorts away (until next summer)."
"D- A very enjoyable Kölsch."
""
"O - Overall I felt this was a solid kolsch offering. Nice pleasant aromas and flavours along with a solid appearance. Jolly good."
""
"Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, medium/high carbonation provides a slight ""spritzy"" feeling on the tongue, smooth medium dry finish"
"Pours a clear gold with a foamy bone colored head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, grass, and hay. Taste is much the same with a mild hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is easy to drink and pretty tasty."
""
"A very good German ale, refreshing and quenching."

"Review from 8/2010 notes. Poured into a kölsch glass. Pours a pale yellow amber, thick long lasting head and lacing. Strong hoppy, light malt aroma. Wheat flavors, light malt, hops, sweetness and light bready flavors with a hoppy, dry finish. A bit of a skunky flavor at the end, but it fits with the overall flavor. Refreshing. This is a reminder of the tragedy of our adjunct beers and that a brewery can make a light, low ABV beer that is flavorful and a pleasure to drink."
""
"O - As far as I'm concerned this is the kolsch that all others are judged by. I have always liked this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: No sharpness (in a good way - round sensation) leaves a pleasant and warm aftertaste"
"I've reviewed/rated a few: drank many in Koln before the internet arrived but can't say I'm a big fan of them even fresh in their brewhouses or beergardens. They do however taste better in bright, warm sunlight compared to indoors on a wet and windy evening in the UK."
""
"Overall great."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"light and easy to drink, like you would expect from a kolsch. good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Far more grainy flavor that I was expecting and I love it. Great lighter session beer not devoid of some serious fruity malty flavor."
"Overall - This is one of the best Kolsch beers I've tried."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a great beer ! the beauty of this style and this brand in particular, is the bitter flavor is not overbearing , the taste is simple and yet delicious, the smell is that of the greatest hops, It smells like beer my dad used to drink,or the aroma I smelled when I was around rohrbachs brewery growing up.I've tried other brands of kolsch , including sunner and gaffel, have to give gaffel another try,but so far reissdorf has this import on lockdown tastewise for me."
""
""
""
""
""
"Nothing else to say really , a bit to watery , not much going on !"
"Thin head with lots of lacing on a clear golden body. Aroma is light with light malt and sweet corn. Flavor is more of the same. Not boasting a very strong flavor but consistent with the style. Light bodies and high carbonation. Drinkable and fuller than most in the genre."
""
"O - Nice to try, but I am not sure it was worth the price. The fruitness of it didn't win me over. I would welcome this beer in the summer months, but beyond the un-aspiring qualification of thirst-quencher, this beer offers little."
""
""
"DELICIOUS, TREAT YOURSELF!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

"O: Very good example of the style and a very enjoyable, very sessionable beer. Brings back memories of visits to the northern parts of Germany on a warm fall afternoon."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"4.0 D: This is probably the best tasting kolsch I've ever had. This truly is a great style that seemingly always gets overlooked."
""
""
""
""
"11.2 oz bottle that pours out clear straw yellow fizzing carbonation from the bottom. White thin head leaves minimal lacing on the glass. Smells like sweet light fruits and bready malt backbone. I didnt get any hops from the nose but on the palate it makes its appearance as the end with a touch of bitterness. Sweet, light, balanced & my first Kolsch - I'll be back for more."
""
""
"One of the best Kolschs I've tasted. Highly sessionable."
""
"Delicate and subtle but not my kind of style hence the low overall impression. (330 ml, BB date 04-29-2012, into tulip.)"
""
"I once heard Kölsch beers described as ""the light, easy-drinking, girly beer"" when a German doesn't want a big heavy brew. Not that I'd use those exact words, but the basic concept was right on the money. The Reissdorf Kölsch is great: simple, elegant, refreshing, balanced. It's everything I want from a Kölsch, and it's executed perfectly."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Great after you mow the lawn or do something of that nature."
""
"Im excited for this style, lets hops Americans can do similar!"
""
"Sessionability - very yes"
""

"O: I would enjoy more than one and overall its a good beer. However I've had several other Kolsch's that I enjoyed more."
"O: very, very drinkable and refreshing. Extremely crisp finish. For my first kolsch I was pleasantly surprised!"
"Overall, easy to drink and enjoyable."
"O- Excellent brew to quaff the day away."
"Overall nice clean crisp beer for an ale, a bit too light even for a Kolsch."
"Overall: Good beer overall. This seems to be a beer that would be perfect on a hot summer day. I will be buying more. Worth a try."
"D: Quite quaffable (QQ), I think this would be a wonderful lawnmower beer for those hot summer months."
"Overall Impression- If I were to take my friends to iTap that only usually drink BMC product, I would suggest this one to them because it was boring and could drink the shit out of it. Really wasn't my cup of tea but I will still call it average. Had even a hint of apple that was interesting but too light to even pick up any ingredient list from this brew."
"O - A very refreshing beer. I wouldn't mind drinking a few of these on a hot summer day."
"An excellent Kolsch! Probably the best I've had. These beers have a light and smooth feel, but a good one really does have a rich flavor and smell to boot. This one delivers. It's a bit pricey around these parts, but if you're feeling good on a particular day and want something refreshing and flavorful, check Reissdorf out!"
"An incredibly awesome German Kölsch-one of my all time favorites. I could drink a shit-ton of this beer, all summer long."
"Pours a golden pale yellow with a nice fluffy white head. Aroma and Taste of caramel malt, yeast, some sweet fruity esters and a light grassy note, with some light hops. Light body and carbonation on the palate. Finish is sweet malt, some biscuit and yeast, and light hops on the ending give it nice balance. Overall a good easy drinking and refreshing brew."
"Drinkability: Good stuff. I am now convinced my German ancestors were not big beer drinkers. If they were, they must have emigrated due to crushing economic or social pressures."
"I would recommend this beer, especially in the hot summer."
"O - Just too sweet for me. I'll likely pass on this one in the future"
"It has a crisp, moderate bite. Just right. This is what they asire to. I don't necessarily need to drink this over and over, though. Hopefully I can get to Germany (bucket list item) and get some on tap some day."
"I am a big hop-head, which means that I tend to shy away from lighter fare but with this beer the kolsch style has a new fan. Simple, honest, and good, this is a ""lawn mower beer"" for the person whose fridge is otherwise filled with Dogfish Head 60 or 90 minute IPA and Pliny the Elder."
"D-Very tasty and drinkable; perfect on a hot day after a trip to the DMV."
"On tap Sat night at Penguin Pizza. Served in a standard pint glass. Bright yellow color with a lot of carbonation and a fluffy white head. Smell had a distinct aroma of citrus and lemon, which I liked. The taste was very light on both the hops and the malt. I would say this beer is light bodied, but that's a given. Very smooth body and low in alcohol. This beer was made specifically so you could drink a few, and I could have easily."
"A decent beer, but not the best rep from Germany, or of this style."
"Good to try an authentic Kolsch and see that most US brewers are poseurs at this style."
"o - Overall a pretty decent Kölsch. Light and easy to drink, with a little bit of light fruit to it. Would give it another shot."
"A firm hoppy character gives it a dry, bitter finish. It's clean, crisp, and very refreshing - probably experiencing the crispness due to its bubbly concoction. Light in taste and soft on the palate, I was pretty pleased with this German Ale. The low ABV makes this beer highly drinkable, even for brunch."
"Notes: A rather tasty beer and very drinkable great on a summer night or day. Cheers."
"O- Great example of a kolsch, slight fruit flavors in the aroma and flavor with balance and crispness. A very enjoyable and drinkable beer."
"O- Highly recommended one of my favorite beers ever."
"So refreshing by itself -- a great lawnmower beer. A nice thing to offer your friends who are less open to ales, as it is a nice upgrade from your conventional adjunct lager."
"Poured a 2"" white soap suds head. Clear straw yellow in color. Not really any smell at all, and not just when cold but even after the sample warmed. Simple BMC taste profile and although some other reviews I'd read mentioned apple and other things I didn't get any of that. Watery. There is sort of a melted ice water after taste. Hey, at least there was no skunking."
"Narrative: “SIIICK ELIMINATOR BROTORCH!” Ah shit, they brought this guy again, god damn Tevin Jacobs. “Ahhh can’t wait to load this up with sick girls, grills, shots, schwaaaazeee-” He’s is trailing off again with what is debatably not even a real word. Why do they always bring this guy around? He is so irritating. “And THEN I WAS ALL LIKE this-” Oh great, now he is grinding all over my dad’s speedboat. They always say he’s great to have around at parties but just a few minutes of this Tevin and I am already sick of him. “SO I ALWAYS TELL CHICKS LIKE OK THINK ABOUT IT, you could never get PREGNANT ON ANOTHER PLANET BECAUSE THE gravity is all different, it would straight pull it down and-” I just, I can’t sit here and listen to this butchering of science. “Yo bro, can you hit me with a Michelob Ultra? Tryna hit up the gym sitch later!”"
"An easy drinking beer that you could pound at a barbaque or just loafing about on a warm summer's day."
"Overall- A very solid, yet relatively simple beer. You could drink a lot of these on a warm summer day and not get sick of it."
"O- very good reminded me of a czech pils ,,very tasty"
"Pours a lovely golden color with big white head(almost two fingers) The beer is almost see though with alot of notes of earthly malts. It smells very crisp and clean with good hop sense on the nose. The taste is perfect for this style of beer with just enough balance of hops and almost fruit like quality. goes down very easy and would be a stable during hot summer months. Overall a great beer that i would recommend to anybody that is a fan of the kolsch style of german beers. Cheers"
"Fantastic example of the Kölsch style. Truly a reminder as to why I love German brews. To date, this one of my all-time favorites. I picked up a few .5L singles at Total Wine in town, as part of a sample pack of German beers. Highly recommended!"
"Overall this is a fantastic summer brew and an ultimate beat the heat thirst quencher. Love it, great!"
"overall - this is a good representation of the style, really good beer for those warm summer nights, wish these were available in six packs and at a slightly more reasonable cost"
"I don't know the calorie count on this but it was like a light beer with a whole lot more flavor and mouthfeel. Nice and makes me want to try more from the style."
"Verdict: Good, not great and not spectacular..."
"M- Lots of carbonation on this one, gives it a very crisp, clean feel, totally drinkable and very refreshing, went great with dinner."
"Poured a light clear yellow with a large white frothy head that was mostly lasting and had excellent lacing. The aroma was light of grain malts, herbal hops and a leathery yeast with notes of citrus. It tasted very light and slightly bitter form beginning to end with the finish being rather light in flavor with a hint of lemon. Mouthfeel was light in body and watery in texture with a soft carbonation. Overall a very mild brew with not much taste."
"D: Very refreshing and decent tasting. Nothing special but would be nice to drink when you've got something else going on. Decent sessioner if it were more complex, but perhaps that's not the strong suit of a Kolsch."
"First time for the this style and very impressed, will recommend and get again."
"Appears bright gold in color with a bone white head and little lace. Aroma full of bready malts. Very clean flavors, definately some liquid bread/loafy moments. Noble hops are there with a light presence and bitterness. Balance is perfect. Mouthfeel is on the light side of medium bodied. Smooth and crisp. Easy to consume, would certainly have it again. A very good example of the style."
"D: I could definitely sit and have 3 or 4 of these, great drinkability."
"D: I could have a few of these, the nice german pale malts and fruity esters from the yeast, the kiss of balancing hops...very nice, especially at only 4.8% abv."
"Mouth-feel is light. Drinkability is high, and this is a very refreshing beer. Carbonation is active, and works well. It not the kind of over carbonation you might see in more domestic examples of this beer, it right were ti needs to be, not overly assertive."
"Looks very nice poured in it's own Kölsch glass. Golden clear body with 2 fingers of head. Not a lot of activity in there, though. Smells up front very grainy and bready, it's pleasant. The taste matches this but I'm getting a tinge of metal. Nice light bodied beer. I'll try this again in the summer though."
"drinkability; super drinkable, need I say more, can not be better. One of the best examples of the style that I have ever had, nearly perfect."
"D: Really light and easy to drink, like you would expect from a kolsch. No complaints here."
"500 ml bottle. Pours golden, with a large white head and soda like carbonation. Aroma of pear, light perfume hops and some malt. Medium, crisp body with light perfume hops, juicy malt and ripe fruit fill the mouth. Practically no finish. Should be good, refreshing, not memorable, summer beer."
"Crisp fresh malt, very slightly bready, soft bitterish finish. Clean, refreshing, well balanced ale."
"Pours a light golden yellow with a small to medium fizzy head. Aroma is mostly malts with some definite toasted grains and a little bit of unpleasant skunkiness as well. Taste is light-bodied, a tad watery with the sweet bready maltiness and grassy hops as the predominant flavors. Finishing is wheaty with a slight sugary taste. Not my favorite Kölsch but certainly a good representative of the style."
"Mouthfeel is correct to style, thin and wet. Drinkability is superb and is good for all seasons a great Kolsch."
"Appears a pale golden straw color with a bright white tight bubbled foamy head. Fine scattered lacing clings to my 1/2 liter mug perfect for the 500ml bottle. Aroma has a light herbal citrus note with a clean pale malt profile, a bit of mineral water very clean notes. Super clean great drinking session German ale, I could picture myself sitting in a Koln bierhall drinking from a kolsch glass being served by a kolbe for the better portion of a sunny afternoon. It's nice when just tasting a beer can give you that experience in your mind. Flavor is very much built around pale cereal grains and light herbal hops with a touch of fruitiness from the ale yeast strain. This is what most American brewers attempt when formulatnig an American Blonde ale, few succeed the way this beer does. Mouthfeel is clean crisp light bodied effervescent carbonation. Drinkability overall is excellent like I said it's pure refreshment, perfect for mass consumption too bad it's 4.50 for a half liter in the Pittsburgh market."
"D Very drinkable, a good repeatable beer."
"Pours a clean yellow color with a off white head. In the aroma, a small hop presence and basically a standard lager smell. In the taste. small hints of earth and fruitiness, but still standard lager kind of taste. A small bite, but mainly smooth and a light bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry to clean, light maltiness in the aftertaste. I like it, but kind of standard Euro light lager."
"Nothing wrong with this, except it has virtually no flavor."
"D. Very good - very drinkable; I'd have it more if it wasn't so expensive."
"Taste is meh. Biscuity, with cereals and grains, rounds into a (very) slight citrusy hop profile. Finishes like nothing at all; literally no lingering flavors besides the dry cereal. Refreshing? I guess. Boring? Most certainly. I think if you put this brew inside a bud light bottle the ratings would go from a B+ to a D. Nice mouthfeel, though. Light, crisp, medium amount of prickly natural carbonation."
"If this is a good Kolsch, it will be my last of the style that's for sure. Really reminds me of an adjunct lager that just so happens to be an ale. Pass..."
"This is a very well-made Kölsch. An ideal warm-weather or session beer."
"Drinkability: Crisp and clean with a nice hint of fruitiness; good example of the style"
"Reissdorf is truly the standard when it comes to Kolsch. Clean, light-bodied, and very pairable with many types of food. It's extremely sessionable."
"The simplicity of Reissdorf Kölsch means that it will pair well with various foods. It is important, however, to choose foods that will not overwhelm the delicacy of the beer. Try it with a summer salad of fresh greens, grilled beets and your local goat's milk cheese. It would also drink well with a vegetable frittata, or shellfish. It is a great substitute for Riesling or Gewurztraminer in any kind of food pairing. With this in mind, try it with a light, nutty cheese such as Piave Vecchio, which is made from cow's milk in Northern Italy."
"Overall a great beer, and my first Kolsch. I hope to try others in this category someday, although they seem pretty hard to come by."
"Clear thin yellow pilsner-color with a thin white head that clings to the glass. Light aroma of light malts, lemon and grass hops, hint of honey sweetness. Feel is thin and crisp, refreshing, clean. Light malts and lemongrass hops. Crisp carbonation generates some belching, but isn't offensive. A hint of skunk. A great german Kolsh and a great end to my heavenly tasting session at Novare Res."
"Drinkability - A very easy drink, but full of flavor and texture. I feel that it has a bit of a heaviness to it that may limit one from consuming too many of these like some lighter, summer beers. Did I say 'creamy?'"
"This was poured for me and the server produced two fingers' worth of quickly dissipating bone-white head. The beer was a beautiful golden-yellow color with NE-plus quality clarity. The nose was faint with Saaz hops. Mouthfeel was medium with a very dry quality on the tongue. Finish was Zephyr wind-dry with a lingering taste of Saaz hops. For those who have heard me rave about Bryan ""Lil Guy"" Selders' Kolsch at Neversink just before it sank - this was as close to it as I have found. Very impressive!"
"This is a worthwhile beer. In this age of extreme beers it is reassuring to know that there are lovely examples of classic, simple styles that you can fall back on if need be."
"This was a quick, thirst quenching glass that was easy to drink. I probably would have ordered another if it was in better condition."
"Overall: Well balanced and very refreshing. I'll be seeking this one out again. Great for a hot summer day."
"Drinkability- It was pretty good. I enjoyed it. First Kolsch for me and I did like it. I would like to try it again sometime."
"Not a particularly outstanding beer for my tastes, but a quality product. Just not a style i particularly love, but I think it's pretty well done for what it is."
"D: This is the best Kölsch that I have drank, and could easily spend a day with this beer alone. I will be sure to drink it when I can find it on tap, especially during the warm months."
"D: A good beer and great kölsch, but I can't get past the sulphur."
"A very nice pale yellow with a nice sticky white head. Aroma is clean and metalic. Flavor is great. Very smooth with that nice crisp bitter bite at the end. Its at first almost a little sweet, but then smooth outs to the bitter bite you want from the style. SUPER drinkible! I wish I could find these in bottles to keep in the fridge this summer."
"From the 500 ml. bottle. Sampled on June 6, 2010. It pours an excitably carbonated pale yellow with a short-lasting fizzy head. The aroma was malty although more skunky than I would have liked. It was a turnoff. The taste was somewhat better with bit of grainy malt, thin hops but a great body."
"Poured light golden with a white, sticky head. Smell was clean, malty, with hints of dried fruit. Taste is deliciously smooth and slightly sweet, but bitter after the sip. An easily drinkable brew."
"Exceptionally drinkable. All the lightness of a light American lager in an ale without bitterness or other harsh flavors. This is a very refreshing beer that can be enjoyed like a session beer to quench a massive thirst."
"Hats off to the fellows in Germany that brewed such a wonderful beer."
"renewed my faith in this style. I'm a born again kolschstian. Easy going dryness makes this one hard to put down and the attractve cylinder showng a golden beer in all it's glory is equally alluring."
"Overall I thought this tasted almost identical on cask as it did on tap, the carbonation was a bit softer and the hops seemed sharper. This may be due to the fact that it was allowed to drop bright and I didn't get very much yeast. Anyways, a solid beer worth a shot from any medium, likely better if it's fresh."
"8/4/14 - FINALLY a bottle that is only slightly past ideal age. it took years to run into one...bumped up score from 3.73. Bet it would be higher a few months ago..."
"D: A great standard by which to judge the style as this brew delivers all of the classic style features and is a joy to drink."
"D: A solid example of the style from the city in which it originated. Good stuff."
"This is a great example of the style. Grainy sweetness, funky, grassy light fruit, and a crisp finish. This isn't a style that I would normally seek out, but this is one of the better Kolsh I've had to date."
"D: It's very easy to drink this beer, which quenches your thirst and is very refreshing. This is very sessionable, especially on a hot summer day."
"M/D: Very light, with spot on carbonation. This seems like a great summertime beer to me. Always saw people say this, but seems session worthy to me."
"Decent, but nothing real exciting, its like a better done version of of your standard US Macro Lager."
"If you like more dry beers, this would be a great example of Kolsch for you. I prefer slightly more evident hops florals and a touch more sweet malts but this one is great and if I were back in Koln and this was the featured beer I'd be sessioning."
"Taste is wheaty and sweet but really light. It's good but pretty plain and dull. A decent session ale but still a good beer worth trying."
"Can't beat the drinkability. I love the dry finish and it just seems like the ideal beer for barbecuing outside or drinking after mowing the lawn. Good stuff."
"Pours a clear straw yellow with a decent fluffy white head - average, but not off-putting. Aroma is average strength, malty and just a tad watery. However, the aroma is this beer's weakest aspect. Flavor is strong, crisp and malty with a fruity overtone. Texture is smooth, lively and fizzy."
"Nice clear bronze/brass color with a massive foamy head that sticks to the side of the glass. Astringent grassy yeasty sweet malty carmel aromas. Taste mimicks the aroma almost exactly but with a metallic finish. Perfect creamy texture and good body and carbonation. Easy drinking."
"Amazing golden color with great carbonation, awesome yeast aroma and an overall perfect beer to enjoy on a warm afternoon."
"D: obviously a very refreshing beer that would be perfect in the summer after a long day of work."
"D- A more drinkable beer may not exist. Not only is this fairly low in alcohol, but the flavors are so subtle that my palate could handle liters before tiring. A fine example of an under-appreciated style. Kolsch is too viewed as an alternative for the non-initiate instead of a style capable of high regard."
"D – This is immensely drinkable; delicious as a stand alone or paired."
"O: This style is too easy going for me... and $4 for a bomber? never again!"
"Lots of carbonation in the mouth but overall the body is thin, which is fine. There is a wheaty aftertaste and a forward sweetness. Its a good kolsch, not many examples. Drinkability is high. Mouthfeel is fine."
"D: This type of beer and ones similar are becoming my favorite brews in the world. The second time I've had this. And after the first sip I cannot believe that I forgot about it so quickly. One of my top brews now, try one on it fits nicely."
"D - Nothing too special. This is a good warm weather session candidate. Slightly creamier and more honey-focused than others of the style. Not bad at all."
"Deep gold in color with a moderate white head, fair retention and lace. Smells of grainy malts and faint grassy hops. Not much depth in the nose. Tastes vinous with an unappealing strength, cereal and corny finish. The finish really kills this one. Light bodied with a medium level of carbonation to it. Not so nice, really, tastes like an adjunct lager that just so happens to be an ale. Recommend against."
"A very pleasant experience. Very drinkable - makes for an outstanding session beer."
"Some more bitterness in the aftertaste."
"This truly is the kind of beer you could drink all night. Excellent kolsch!"
"poured from a 500ml bottle: aroma is sweet and grassy, a crystal clear yellow color with white frothy head that reduces but good lacing, a light touch of fruity sourness, a mediium body, creamy texture and lively carbonation, very long, soft and pleasing finish. I really like this beer and could drink these several of these at a sitting!"
"This beer is very true to the Kolsch style and a great example of it. Light ales and lagers are not my favorite but you have to appreciate the craftsmanship of a classic style."
"D- Not a brew for those that love big bold flavors. Well crafted with a delicate flavor."
"M & D - light bodied with nice CO2 content. Easy drinking and refreshing. Perfect."
"D: Very good."
"Pours nice golden straw with a sudsy white head with little retention. Very refreshing and delicious looking beer for a late afternoon. Has a grainy nose, oddly enough it reminds me exactly how Rolling Rock smelled to me as a kid when my parents drank it, and had my first tastes of beer. Some citrus and sweet malt, can't really detect any hops. Has some sweet malt upfront, oat, then citrus, and viney twang and a bitter hop bite on the back. Very crisp on the palate with nice carbonation. This is a very refreshing, light bodied beer, good for a warm day session."
"I possess the DNA marker that amplifies bitter perception; hence, most beers taste like bug spray. This was the first beer that I and my siblings tasted and said ""WOW!!! Beer can taste like that?!"" Smooth, light carbonation, can be served slightly less than room temp. but not too cold."
"Mouth feel is thin, crisp, prickly and refreshing."
"Overall: Good for style except for carbonation which is most likely not the German's fault in this case."
"Overall, this was one that went down pretty good. I expected more out of this one though, and have had some others in the style that I liked alot better. Dry, clean, and a decent summer brew. Not something I'd grab often, but I will revisit again."
"mouthfeel is watery and bland. I think this is about germany's budlight"
"Very clean on the palate. Quite crisp and quite delecious. Certainly an easy drinker and a beer that is easily sessionable and quite frankly, I would recommend many sessions of this."
"D- Not my favorite style, but very refreshing and easy to drink."
"Overall: An excellent summer choice if your craving a tall glass of refreshing brew."
"Overall, I didn't find anything particularly spectacular here, but nothing particularly bad either. Worth a try, and a pretty good thirst quencher."
"A bit middle-of-the-road here. I've had better. Not hard to drink but not impressive."
"D- Super drinkable. A wonderful restorative after a 90 degree day, and a great way to precede a meal."
"Overall, this is a nice brew. I don't have a lot of experience with the Kolsch style, but this is very crisp and refreshing. Nice brew!"
"Drinkability: This is an enjoyable, refreshing, easy to drink beer that would be easy to consume more and more of either with food or for an evening of good conversation over several beers."
"Overall a decent kolsch. Very accurate to the style, but just not alot of spunk. A good brew."
"Overall just a wonderful masterfully crafted brew out of Köln brewed in the Kölsch tradition with passion and full attention."
"Overall, this beer is so complimentary that it is easy to overlook. Standing as an strong example of the Kolsch style. The light, refreshing character of Reissdorf, coupled with its low ABV, make for one heck of a session brew."
"Good refreshing beer."
"D- I understand that each brewer needs to differentiate their product from other brewers, but the little ""funk"" to my kolsch prevented me from getting that full clean, crisp taste i was looking for."
"This is a nice little summer quaffer. I would like to have it on hand more often, but it is not widely available where I am."
"I could drink this beer aaall day long. put this in my had instead of a coors light at an A's game and I'll be in heaven!"
"Pours a clear golden with a small white head. Smells a hint of yeasty phenols. Taste is light and dry, a Koln yeast strain, crackery malt with a nice amount of bitterness in the finish. Finish is also quite clean. Mouthfeel is good, slightly high carbonation. Drinkability is also good, one of the best Kolsch's I have had, recommended."
"A good all around Kolsch. Pours a light golden color with good head that dissipates in a short time. Carries a sweet smell as well as a floral accent. Crisp, clean taste with a well balanced hop/ malt flavor and a light fruity character (white grapes?). Despite the 500ml bottle, this stands as a great session beer in my book."
"A very easy drinking beer."
"Notes: Like a lemon pilsner. Tasty and refreshing. Light like a macro, but with class and style, and the subtlety to stand out."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied, crisp but not overdone carbonation never masks the flavor, and drinkability is, as is to be expected of this style, superb. This one more than many others I've tried. Possibly my #1 favorite summer style. Beautiful beer."
"Poured a well-carbonated golden body with a one-finger head that slowly receeds. A biscuity and fruity (like grape) smell. Light-bodied, tad slick and smooth. Has a pils-like crispness with that faint smoke veg effect for dryness. Balanced with a good amount of fruit flavors like grape and tropical along with some sweet malts make this an easy-drinking and very enjoyable beer. I haven't had too many of this style but is growing upon me; this particular beer was a perfect complement to my Sunday brunch."
"Not bad, and from all indications this beer traveled pretty darn well. I never expected to introduce any Kölsch into my normal beer buying patterns, but it may be time to make room - especially for the summer."
"Would be a fantastic session beer out of the keg."
"Taste is the same, very light and refreshing, my wife said it didn't taste like beer (which for her is a good thing) so I think it hits the style spot well, no lingering aftertaste, just balanced and quaff-able. Not very complex but very nice and light on the palate, an easy drinker, a very session type beer. Very fresh from the tap, don't know if a bottle from across the ocean would go so well."
"D- Extremely drinkable/session-able due to the low ABV and enjoyable, but never overpowering flavor."
"Taste is ... delicious, not much else to say, what a great session beer ! Mouthfeel is not incredibly complex, but very enjoyable nonetheless. Drinkability is very much here. A perfect beer to have several of on a warm summer day at a BBQ with light fare."
"Cheers!!!"
"with friends, the mini-kegs go down fast... a little too fast really."
"overall a nice well balanced drinkable beer."
"Very drinkable - a classic kolsh done really well. Very light, easy to drink, but not without taste."
"Out of a bottle this beer was a clear, gold color. The head was pure white, displayed good retention as a thin skim and left pretty good lacing. The aroma was dry and grainy with pleasant floral hops and pale malt notes. The flavors were an excellent example of a traditional Kolsch; I tasted a great balance of floral hops, dry grains and hints of sweetness from the pale malt. Acidic, very refreshing and totally sessionable. The body was light, the carbonation medium and the mouthfeel average. Very spring-like, just as a Kolsch should be."
"D - Nice and light, great summer beer."
"Overall, a great beer for the beer drinker who doesn't want to be caught with an American lager."
"Again, what American macros only dream of being."
"It's gold, has some carbonation bubbles in the body, and has some lacing sticking to the glass. Aroma is fruity...if you fruit skins and pears, your nose should be happy. Taste is more pilsneresque, but it's not often I drink kolsch. Sweet pilsner malt is obvious. Hay and wood notes dominante the background of the beer. Is this a pils? No, it isn't, but I did enjoy it. Went well washing down an awesome brat at Wurstkuche."
"Reissdorf Kölsch is a very clear light yellow beer with a small white ring for a head. The aroma is a little pretzely, wooden and, most of all, fruity. It sure smells German. It is light bodied, prickly on the tongue, but quite smooth. The finish is a little metallic, but clean. It tastes lightly sweet and lightly bitter. It's pretty quenching-- not that dry. This is squarely in the session realm."
"D: After a steady diet of big beers, I really had to shift gears to get into the subtlety of this. The last two Kölsch style beers I had made me wonder if this simply wasn't the style for me, because those beers didn't do much for me. This; however, was a complete turnaround from those. I'm quite glad I picked it up."
"There are many, much tastier beers that I have given a lower score, what makes this one so good is its lack of flaws and effortless drinkability. More please!"
"Well carbonated, light, crisp and easy to drink with a nice dry finish. I was really surprised that I liked this one as much as I did. Overall, this is a very good refreshing beer and one that may be better enjoyed during the hot summer months."
"Wow! So crisp and refreshing! It's a crying shame that this is not more widely available. This will be mandatory in my fridge from here on. Give this a try for sure, especially if you're looking for a warm-weather brew or a lighter session beer. Reissdorf (for me anyway) is the standard by which all other Kölsch beers and their imitators are measured."
"Pure bone white head that dissolves into a patchwork quilt across the surface, the lacing holds on in a spotty manner too. Bright yellow color with a green streak, while fully transparent there's nothing that makes you think it is pale or dilute. Very fresh and open nose, sliced white bread, golden wheat, green corn husk, orange infused spring water, while on the hops side of things there's nothing bitter nor biting about the nose, just a gentle unfolding of ""beer"" inside your nostrils. Medium-bodied, with feeling carbonated it swells inside the mouth and takes up as much space as possible, just not pushing down into the tongue. Moderately sweeter with elements of pink grapefruit, orange citrus and pineapple, nectarine, peach fruit. None of which dramatically change the overall dry and crisp character of the beer for here the hops are indeed bitterer and add a nice vibrancy to the mouthfeel. There's a toasted, powdery quality to the malts like sticking a wet finger into malted milk powder. Flavor is not what this beer is about, it's texture, movement and quenching your thirst."
""
"An important aside: the whole Kolsch style seems to be very underrated here on BA. Let's keep in mind that Kolsch is a fairly simple, straightforward style as we rate them, and not knock their grades down because they lack the mystique and complexity of a Belgian Quadruple."
"Refreshing brew and very good for style."
"D - I suspect I'd enjoy this beer a lot more if I had several over the course of a night out with friends. It's the sort of beer you can drink all day without really thinking about it. No real complexity to speak of, but endlessly refreshing."
"Easy to drink beer, would gladly sit down and session these things."
"At 4.8% ABV this is one fine and drinkable beer. Would love to get a fresher bottle into my hands as I am sure it would be fantastic. An excellent replacement for a BMC lawnmower beer. I couldn't imagine what would be better on a hot day than a fresh one of these."
"Pours a clear yellow color with a soapy sticky white head. Corny pale malt in the nose with a slight bitter hop twang, light but very balanced and inviting. This beer is the definition of 'clean', fresh flavor, roasted pale malt, light grassy-ness and bitterness from the hops. Light in body, great carbonation and extremely high drinkability. I think i just found my new lawn mower beer without a doubt."
"Has a very translucent yellow color with head that has the consistency of soda pop fizz. The smell is mainly of corn husk and grains. The taste has more corn husk characteristics and a decent amount of malty sweetness. Very light in body, crisp, and refreshing."
"Drinkability: Light on the ABV, good body, good taste...great for session"
"A nice golden/yellow color. The smell was light and hard to detect. I was hoping to smell something but couldn't. The taste was dry and had a nice hop bite to it. Not overpowering, very easy to drink. I did detect a little sweetness to the beer, it was almost not noticeable."
"A decent brew. Would work well with a summer salad. Worth the try if your looking for something outside of pale ales or stouts. A great style."
"Drinkability is very high. This would be a good replacement for many of the BMC drinkers' stand-by beer."
"Very nice kolsch beer that has a deep rich golden color and a spectacular white foamy head that produces exceptional lacing. A nice subtle malty nose leads into a great mild sweet malt on the palate, with just the right hint of hops at the finish. The mouthfeel is superb; this silky brew flows across the tongue with a great thick smoothness that makes it good drinking in warm or cool weather. This is a good session beer, hightly drinkable as it satisfies while not being too heavy."
"Would drink again. Soon."
"Flavor was dry and crisp with a healthy, yet clean bitter dose saved for the finish. Not much sweetness or honey to the malts, just lightly toasted biscuits and a soft graininess. The hops were equally as gentle, delivering a delicate floral bitterness to the back of the palate. Mouthfeel is excellent, with a light body and livid carbonation level that leaves the tongue dry and, at the same time, quenched. I'd gladly have this again, and was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed it during a cold November's eve. Hooray for the Kölsch style!"
"500 ml bottle, pours a crystal clear light gold with sudsy head, not much retention, but nice lacing. Smell: light malts, granny smith apples, green grapes. Medium to light bodied, bready, white grape juice, not quite ripe nectarine. Ends a bit dry, with a hard-water feel."
"D: Exceptional. Up there with the most drinkable beers I've ever had."
"Carbonation is pleasantly strong and gives a good punch to the medium body and smooth feel. A terrific beer."
"Overall: Kolsch are easy drinking and could not turn any of them away. So give it a try."
"I find the bottled version to have a bit more bite to it than the draft version. Also, one of the finer kolschs that I've had."
"This has a beer aftertaste. This is a fruity beer, and a manly beer. It's a fruity manly beer."
"Pours a crystal clear macro yellow color with a decent three finger head that recedes quickly leaving behind very little lacing. Strong aroma of skunk and and husky, grassy grains. Smells a little over-cooked. I'm not sure how old this bottle is but it doesn't smell very fresh. Tastes of grainy malt, slightly bitter, a little fruitiness, some lemon zest, and hints of honey. Very grassy and slightly spicy hops. Smooth and creamy on the tongue, not much in the way of carbonation. I would like to try a fresher bottle, as this one seems to have some age on it, but it's pretty tasty and easy to drink, nonetheless."
"The taste is very crisp and clean, full of flavours of bread, hay, apple, white grape juice, lemon, hints of honey and vanilla. It's slightly on the dryish side, lively, with a light tartness in the finish."
"I quite enjoyed this kolsch out on my patio this evening. Easy to drink and enjoy."
"D: A beer on first taste I didn't think all that much of, but it certainly grows on you. Would make a fantastic warm weather beer, or a hot 2nd day of fall beer."
"This is a very well executed, straight-forward beer. Qualifies as a truly exceptional lawnmower beer."
" Overall, this is a good example of this style."
"D: On the whole, this is a decent beer. Not my favorite thing in the world, but a good beer."
"This a very refreshing, session beer; perfect for a hot day."
"Drinkability: this would make an excellent beer for those lazy summer afternoons"
"A bubbly yellow gold body supports a pure white fluffy head in an Ayinger altbier glass... a bit of hops and a bit of wheat to aid the smoothness with little complexity, as per the style-- this is one SUMMER SLAMMING beer! Slightly creamy, soft, medium-bodied offering--I like its presenceand the subsequent effortless drinkability... strong metallic malts, almost pilsneresque... slight fruitiness, but not overt... a bit bready too... as Michael Jackson calls this a ""delicate"" style, I too find little difference between this and others, whether it be Gaffel or Saranac... but this isn't a bad thing, knowing the style's limitations and the pleasant drinking rewards..."
"This was a fine representation of the style. I'm not a huge Kolsch fan, but the Reissdorf will make a convert of anyone. The beer is light, spritzy, with lots of efforvescence. It is a refreshing beer that sets itself apart by the unmistakeable white grape skin vinous character of the brew. This is about as close to pouring a chardonnay in a beer as you will find. There is also a bit of a champagne like quality to the beer, albeit with a lot less efforvescence. The mouthfeel is very light and it is just a great refreshing summer time beer, very sessionable. L'Chaim."
"A fine summer beer, served in a cylindrical 12 oz. glass. Appears a clear gold with a short, white head. The aroma and then following flavor immediately remind me of white grape juice, oh man. There's then a drier, light toast barley note for balance and a hint of spicy hops. There was also a slight, white wine-like acidity to this one, which didn't detract so much as just make it more interesting. Worth a try."
"Reissdorf Kolsch poured extremely light yellow, one of the lightest I have ever seen. Smell was of sea weed. Taste was of sea salt upfront then loads and loads of lemon, and other citrus flavors. Mouthfeel was crisp and refreshing. Nice. Drinkability was very nice as well. I enjoyed this beer a great deal."
"A very well-done Kolsch. Very drinkable."
"Mouthfeel is watery, but that's pretty average for this style. Still a very drinkable beer, but not the best in a style that is already pretty mediocre."
"Really good drinkability. A wonderful summertime session beer."
"overall i nice brew and was enjoyable."
"Served in my Reissdorf stange. Poured a crystal clear pale yellow with lots of tiny bubbles in solution. Half-inch white head dissipated into a thread-like white band that coalesced around the perimeter of the glass. Clean, grassy nose. Grain is the dominant flavor with a sweet character at the finish. Mouthfeel was light-bodied without being watery and mildly effervescent. Easy drinking and refreshing, but a little too simple for my tastes."
"Appearance is clear yellow-orange with a nice off-white that is rather restrained but settles into a thin ring around the edge of the glass for the duration. Aroma is a complex mixture of flowery noble hops and malt that reminds me of graham crackers or crunchy ginger snaps. Taste is bursting with that same yummy malt that dances nicely with the noble hops. Medium mouthfeel also has a ""mineraly"" feel to it that leaves a semi-dry finish but the malt and hops still linger long enough for me to savor these wonderful flavors. Hop bitterness is also medium which put everything together spells balance. Right were a kolsch should be. With a restrained ABV of under 5% this makes a great session brew for hot summer days on the lake or beach. I've enjoyed this brew from a bottle many times but it's really something special on tap."
"Very refreshing and an easy drinker. Nice on a hot day. A nice Kolsch but not my favorite."
"Has a pale yellow color, very little head. Very clear, of course. Aroma is weak, but not bad at all. Very nice mouthfeel; light but not watery, and with a pleasant amount of carbonation. Flavor is also light and easy, with a touch of fruit. Extremely drinkable brew."
"This is my first go at the Kölsch style and I didn't really expect much. It's pretty mild and refreshing, but certainly not something I would say is a must try."
"It was almost hard for me to believe that this was an ale. In a blindfold test I probably would have thought this to be a pils. The beer really didn't wow me, but in the end it was a pretty refreshing outing."
"One of the ""forgotten"" styles. This would be fantastic on a warm day."
"Overall, this is a good first brew of the night. Very drinkable."
"D: A dry, crisp, and clean kolsch with a fair and moderate drinkability. Didn't really leave an impression though."
"This is a very light golden color kolsch with a firm whte head and fair lacing. The aroma is extremely crisp, clean wheat and cereal. Very nice. The flavor brings light and refreshing wheat and rice that again jumps out as clean and crisp. Real easy drinking for sure, perhaps a bit too aqueous but it is great with food or as a quencher on those hot summer days. I would enjoy a little more body to this but it is still a nice choice."
"A good brew, the first time I tried this it was obviously a tad stale, but this was clearly a fresh version. I wish we had more of this style down this way to compare and contrast, but until then this is as good a choice as any."
"Very tasty and undoubtedly smooth, this authentic Kolsch is a delight to drink and enjoy."
"500ml bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a pale straw yellow with a slight white head that disappears quickly. The beer gives off a light aroma of biscuit and citrus. The taste is very complex with it starting off on a citrus note then the grainy taste takes over and and finishes with a nice light hop bitterness to it. The feel on this beer is nice and light with low carbonation. This beer is easily a nice session beer."
"330ml brown bottle from The Lighthouse in Manchester. Pours a very light straw yellow with a half inch of off-white head that quickly dissipates. Smells slightly biscuity and fruity. Tastes fruity - some citrus, maybe peach? Notes of grassy hops. Great sweet aftertaste. While the flavors are fairly subtle, it's complex enough to keep things interesting and aid heavily in the drinkability. Very light in body with light carbonation. Possibly the most drinkable beer I've ever had. Perfect for a long hot summer day."
"The aftertaste is dry and crisp, almost wine like. Not an extremely clean finish, with some cereal flavor lingering, but overall an absolutely wonderful beer."
"Pours a clear yellow, with a small head that vanishes quickly. Smells a bit bland, with some strange candy sweetness and a tad bit of hops. Tasted of grain, clovers, a sweet taste that I couldn't put my finger on, and a touch of hops at the end. It was somewhat carbonated, but not enough to be a distraction. Overall, this was an excellent Kolsch and I will pick this up again for sure."
"D - Light and smooth with a nice, but mild hop character. Easily drinkable, but not overly interesting."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"Pours a clear golden color with a one finger white head that dissipates slowly with no lacing. Light fruit and malt aromas. Up front taste of malt, banana, and grass with a clean finish with mild lemony hops. Light, crisp mouthfeel leads to easy drinkability. Excellent Kolsch."
"My first Kolsch and I poured into a glass from a bottle. This beer had a beautiful foamy head that quickly filled half the glass until it settled down. The color was a very light amber and there was a lot of good carbonation. The beer had a bready, yeasty smell, with a touch of citrus and hops. The taste was exceptional. Good malty, sweet flavor up front that became citrusy (almost sour) in the middle before finishing with a soft hoppiness. This was a medium bodied beer and extremely drinkable! I will definitely drink some more of these!"
"D: Easy to drink, great for summer. Not overly complex, though."
"D - The cereal-like quality makes it feel too much like a macro, which makes me a little bored and little sick after awhile. This is an interesting beer overall, but the 1/3 or so that's so lager-like really knocks out the drinkability for me."
"D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, mild kick, excellent representation of style, this is a very good beer to drink for a whole evening."
"On tap at the Moan and Dove. The beer had a light gold appearance with a medium sized head. Stay in appearance pretty much until it was gone. Grassy hops perfumed from the drink giving it a very full aroma. Taste-wise, I felt the low bitter sweet flavors of citrus and hops made this very clean but also very well-rounded taste. Carbonation from the mouthfeel helped make this crisp and light. This was watery in a good, refreshing way. Great light drink to begin the night."
"This was the first Kolsch style beer I have had. Enjoyed it well chilled in a pint glass. Poured a very clear gold color with many little bubbles and a nice white head. Smell a good mix of hops and mild malts. Taste was very crisp with the slightest hint of mint and vanilla as well as fresh hops and a little malt. A very good variety. Very dry finish yet still crisp on the tongue."
"ideal for a summer afternoons relaxing before moving onto some more weighty beers"
"330 ml bottle. Served in a Sam Adams BL glass, the beer pours a straw gold color with about a half inch white head. Head retention and lacing is OK. Aroma is grassy, biscuity and lemony, but light. Taste is the same as the aroma, but it's stronger than the aroma is. Mouthfeel/body is light, with good carbonation and a crisp, dry finish. Drinkability is pretty good, it's refreshing and easy to drink. Pretty sessionable, too. Overall I think this is a good beer. If you're looking for something on the lighter side, this is a pretty good choice."
"D: This is a nice break from the heavy ales I've been drinking. This would be a great gateway beer for the BMC crowd."
"This is one of the most drinkable beers I have ever had. It was hard to put down and just kept getting better as it came to temp. Well worth the $9.99 tag for the 4 pack. Your non-BA buds would enjoy this one."
"D: Off the charts. Very good stuff, this"
"Drinkability- A solid kolsch, and @ 4.8%, quite sessionable."
"This beer pours a clear golden color. The head is an inch and a half in height, and recedes rather slowly into nice lacing. The aroma is of bready malt with a moderate grassy, spicy hop character. The taste is like the aroma, but with a wonderful mineral tone in the finish. The mouthfeel is light bodied with lively, refreshing carbonation. Overall, this is a very good beer. While living in Germany for nearly four years I noticed a distinct mineral character in the beers from a lot of small local German breweries. I haven't experienced that characteristic much since moving back to America, but this beer has it. I will certainly drink this beer again."
"-Oelergud"
"True-to-style light golden color with lots of bubbles. Faint aroma of yeast and hop. Very well balanced between malty smoothness and crisp, refreshing, clean drinkability. Pleasant lingering grainy hop finish. Great Kolsch. Would probably be great with many foods - enough flavor to complement food and crisp and clean enough to refresh the palate. Fairly inexpensive makes it a great value. I'll drink it again and recommend it to others."
"Light Gold pour with a medium lasting white head in a kölsch glass. Typical grassy, pale malt and lightly earthy hopped smell. Light to medium body with a nice clean refreshing crisp flavor. About as good as kolsches get, from what I've had so far. Great easy drinking beer, but nothing crazy."
"Drinkability: I'm having visions of Friday night, a Sox game on TV and several of these to enjoy throughout the evening. A very tasty beer."
"Very clean, slightly grainy aroma. Light yellow/gold color with a thin layer of head and touches of lace. Clean flavor leaning toward sweetness. Aftertaste was a good balance of grain, sweetness, and hops. Restrained carbonation, medium bodied with a very good mouthfeel. Overall, a very light and delicate, easy drinking beer Well balanced and executed."
"Not the most complicated German beer I've had, this nonetheless makes good company. It's straightforward but solid, somewhat basic but refreshing and smooth. Easy to enjoy and grab another to follow."
"drinkability is good. this is a lighter brew, but there is enough here for the palate to warrant another bottle or two. damn good for a lighter brew! cheers!"
"A Kölsch is supposed to be soft around the edges.. just enough of everything to make it special and the ""special quality"" is damn hard to achieve for brewers."
"d: not amazing but definitely pretty decent for a style that is overall uninspired"
"With food, veggie quesadillas, good pizza, and lighter grilled fare would fit the bill perfectly."
"Well Its the first Kölsch that I tried I think it would be a good beer to turn someone on to the thrills of imported beer that drank Miller"
"An easy-drinking, classic Kolsch, with a nice hop and cedary touch. I liked this one more from the bottle than from the tap I had a few months ago. Overall- stands out for the style."
"D'ability - Not sure how long this beer sat on the shelves in Boulder, but clearly not fresh. Age of samples makes flavor and MF reviews potentially not representative. I poured out the last half of the 500 mL bottle - enough said."
"This beer was golden straw in color and formed a nice head leaving plenty of lace on the way down. The aroma had just a hint of mint and the taste had a tuch of vanilla and a nice malt flavor with a dry cedary finish. All in all a very nice beer and one that I could definitly have more than one of especialy on a hot day."
"D-this is a very simple ale,at the same time it has a great quality taste(nothing generic tasting)Goes down like water...but tastes much better!"
"Reissdorf Kolsch pours a lemon yellow color with a white head from a brown 330 ml bottle. There is a mild grainy aroma. The body is quite light. The flavor is mostly grainy with a touch of noble hops. Better than a macro lager anyday, yet just as drinkable."
"I should learn to stop drinking Kolschs myself. I'm not a huge fan of the style, but this one from Reissdorf us likely to be named a classic for the style. I'd likely get something else again, but it was alright."
"Pours a clear straw gold with a white head that rises well off an aggressive pour but falls fast. Nose is malty, slightly sweet, and overall mild. Flavor is slightly sweet with a grainy tone to it. Smooth and even. Feel is good with a low carbonation and a decent mix of ingredients. Definitely drinkable. If you want to try a kolsch for the first time, this is a decent enough one to do it with."
"5L keg at our Septoberfest party. Pours a clear pale yellow color with noticeable bubbles and a medium white head that dissipates steadily. Small patches of lacing. The aroma is grassy hops with mild malt. Light, clean body with hops, straw and sweet malt flavors. The finish is moderately hoppy with a sweet malty aftertaste. Decent all around, although I am not sure it justifies the higher price tag given other domestic Kölsch choices are just as good."
"Pours a clean straw yellow with a fluffy white head that slowly dissipates. Aroma is subtle, mainly clean malt with a little grassy hops. The flavor is malty leaning toward a fresh grain flavor with a high carbonation level that keep it all very clean on the palate. Hops are in the background but work well with the malt character of this lighter weight beer. A very sessionable beer, and worked well as an appetizer for a heavy meal of Deutsch pork shank and spaetzle. Perked up the taste buds without tiring them."
"This is what American macro lagers like Budweiser and Miller ought to taste like. Light, easy-going but with enough taste (read: not watered down) that it never gets boring. But it isn't really that complex, and nothing jumps out at you that makes it special. Mouthfeel is the highlight here, as it sits on the tongue like liquid silk. If you want a nice smooth beer to enjoy with a couple friends while watching a ballgame, Reissdorf is your beer, my friend."
"I wish more light beer drinkers would drink more of this. Its a great style and This beer is a great representation of it."
"my first kolsch, i think ; pours a pale golden-straw color into my weizen glass w/ a fluffy white head which dissapates quickly leaving a moderate amount of lacing ; not a strong smell, some hop aroma w/ a slightly vinous & fruitish undertone ; more of the same here, a slightly thin flavor, crisp w/ some hop flavor, hard to define the malt flavor, it's too weak, some fruitiness comes through as well, but too covered up by the hops to identify ; a dry, light-bodied beer, almost too thin, though, it's borderline 3.5/4 on the BA scale ; it's quite quaffable though, w/ it's dryness & a 4.8 ABV, i could drink a gallon of it..."
"Drinkability: Not nearly as drinkable as the beers I sampled in Koln. It is apparent there has been some damage done in transport - but I tend to hold import to the high standard of consuming them in the country of origin."
" Overall I was very nicely surprised by this one. Now I shouldnt be because I love the style, however it is always nice when I get one I never heard of and it turns out well for me. I was definatly interested and would really love to have this one again. With the weather finally turning cooler it will be a challenge to enjoy these light summer brews much longer, but I will still pick this one up again, definitely recommend for sure."
"Drinkability: Goes down easy, but no real flavor that stays in the mouth to make it memorable."
"Very clean, straw color with thin head that quickly disappears. Mild citrus smell that is not overpowering, but noticable. I was taken back that a beer this clear could have hop flavor like that. It is not a potent as an IPA, but it lets your palate know its there. Under the hops is a good white wine grape taste, that is very dry but welcome. This beer is very carbonated, much like a white wine, and pops across your tounge. A very good Kolsch keeping Germany proud."
"D - A highly drinkable beer. Flavourful, well balanced and a lowish ABV% make this a pretty good session beer."
"Drinkability: When the mood is right, like a gross, muggy day in Georgia, this beer is a life saver."
"Thin light mouthfeel and a highly drinkable beer. A decent summer beer, but there's not a whole lot to grab at with this one. For a first time Kolsch this one comes off as a wit and pilsner hybrid to explain the style to someone who hasn't tried it."
"i'm told this is what a kölsch is supposed to be, and i can't really complain."
"Pours a golden straw color with a nice soapy white head that dissipated into a small cap. The smell is slightly grassy and some hints of fruity esters. The brew has a biscuit-like malt base with hay/grassy hops, slightly metallic (copper?). The feel is light but not watery, slightly dry, slighly bitter, well carbonated. A fine lighter style brew that is satisfying. A great beer to try before the summer ends."
"Crisp and clean, a little dry. A perfect choice for refreshment; really easy to drink."
"From a bottle into a pint glass. This looks clearer than what i expect from the kolsch style. That's just my opinion though. The head didnt last long at all. It has a nice light hop aroma, the typical german crisp smell. At this point before my first sip I feel as if this beer seems more like a pilsner than a kolsch. But the taste did bring the clean wheaty taste I expect. Very refreshing, very easy to drink. For a Kolsch I must say that I expect a bit more cloudiness and a bit more body. Maybe a little more complexity in the flavors. However it's still a nice refreshing summer time beer and next time I'm walking off the sand V-ball court It'll be nice to have one of these."
"For those of you who might think that Bud, Miller or Heinekin is a flavorful beer, as a first step, try a Kolsch like this one. The improvement may astound you. This is not, however, my favorite Kolsch."
"Drinkability was quite impressive. For a lighter-styled, summertime beer, this was both quaffable and fairly flavorful."
"T-This is a high quality beer. I find myself really loving a good Kolsch on a hot summer day. As somewhat of a seasonal drinker this one is always welcome during the dog days."
"Drinkability: Very nice beer. The overall taste is that of a pilsner but with the complex overtones of an ale."
"Drinkability: I was quite surprised with the complexity of this brew. I didn't expect it to be quite as refreshing as it was. It is a beer for a refined pallet. You couldn't just stop with one."
"Poured a pale golden with a foamy white head that quickly fades to a ring. Some spotty lacing. The smell is light, sweet, and grainy. The taste is relatively crisp, very slightly sweet, and with bready malt. Quite rounded in flavor. Refreshing and fairly light in both body and abv. Could be a little crisper, but a nice summer beer nevertheless. Very clean as well."
"11/7/07: recently had this on draft at a local restaurant. Would only add that the beer looked great in a stange."
"D: It goes down all right, if they all tasted like this I'd probably be sick of Reissdorf after two or three - hopefully I can go and live in Cologne one day and give this ale a more thorough review there!"
"Pours a crystal-clear light gold with a billowing white head that reduces fairly quickly leaving behind little lacing. Tremendous bubble activity. Perhaps the clearest, cleanest-looking beer I've ever seen. The bouquet is primarily bready, doughy, vaguely fruity malts. The taste is as clean as the appearance -- exceptionally smooth with a yeasty but fruity and tart flavor that gives way to a dry, subtly hoppy finish. Very light-bodied with a crisp, spritzy mouthfeel. It's lightness and relatively low alcohol content makes this a beer you spend an entire afternoon with -- the hotter the day, the better. Amazingly refreshing. It also seems to be crafted with utter discipline and precision -- very characteristic of its German origin for better (in the case of beer, cars and electronics) or for worse (I won't go any further...)."
"Reissdorf Kolsch is an excellent although not quite perfect (Fruh Kolsch) example of a Kolsch. For those of you who like lighter but flavorful beers this is the style for you. Can be consumed ice cold like many Americans drink their beer but is better around 50 degrees fahrenheit. Very clear, and smooth. An excellent summer beer if you live somewhere hot like me. No distinguishable aftertaste and moderate alcohol content 4.8%. Little head retention and not much lace. Overall, I would buy this beer over and over and of course drink it too!"
"Pours a light golden yellow color with a thin white head. The aroma is clean grainy malt and some slightly spicey hops. The taste is more of the grainy malt and slightly metallic with a mildly spicy hop finish. Overall, this is just an average beer that doesn't possess any qualities that make me want to have another."
"Mouthfeel wasn't as sparkling light & clean as the color indicated it might be(just a hint heavier), but it was more satisfying for it. Still so easy to drink."
"http://www.bodensatz.com/staticpages/index.php?page=20020701123142126"
"D: Yep, i'll have another. I would think the fresher this is, the more the experience would improve. I'm gonna think that this would be an excellent choice for a lawnmower or after a long motorcycle-ride-at-dusk kind of beer. Recommended."
"Very drinkable, seems a great brew to make a summertime session of. It's a cool spring night and it's fine now."
" I could see this on a summer day in Koln with the steeples of the ancient cathedral in the background quaffing away without a care in the world, but I'm not in Koln, and it's 3$ a bottle, and well, PBR is not. If you like the fact that you are drinking a German beer then by all means enjoy, but I think for what it is there are a lot of beers that are similar and as drinkable."
"Very easy to drink, great German session beer. The only 'true Kolsch' generally available in the middle west."
"The aroma is of bread and floral hops. The flavor is biscuity and refreshing with the floral and grassy hop notes present enough for a good taste but well balanced by the malt character. Mouthfeel is crisp with a nice balance between sweet and dry. Very refreshing. I could drink a lot of this -- in fact I have!"
"500ml bottle: Pale golden ale, small white head, that went fast, slow carbonation. Honeyish aroma, sweet and malty, buiscuity,some small grassy hop. Sweet and malty at the start, then dries out real fast ,leaving a small bitter after taste. Lager like consistency on the palate, but very dry and a fast finish. A beer for hot weather nightly session. Simple stuff but drinkable."
"D - A pretty good Kolsch. It isn't incredibly flavorful but it tastes good."
"Bit of cheesy aroma greets you on a pale yellow lager with moderate head. Fair taste, a tad sweet and dry but satisfying. Smooth somewhat creamy and drying mouthfeel, I have had much creamier kolsch and want something hoppier as well. At 4.8% a session ale and a good summer lawnmower choice."
"B'ham UK"
"I wish this were available on draught nearby as it is really a quality session beer..."
"Poured out a light yellow crystal clear body with a nice bone white head. The nose is clean with faint dry and slightly sweet pale malt note. Lots of fresh grain here. The taste is hard to describe unless you've had Kolsch. It's likefresh grain and stale grain mashed together with some fruityness and some bitterness. the mouthfeel is bright fresh and crisp. Very drinkable."
"Light bodied and pretty dang drinkable. More suitable for summer, but good enough whenever."
"This is the first time I have ever tried a Kolsch style of beer and I loved it. It first smell to me a little like bread and the beer was filled with tons of tiny bubbles. The taste was great and tasted a little nutty and sweet. Great beer, and I'm sure I will have it again."
"Overall: A pretty decent brew, though nothing remarkable. Worth a try."
"Drinkability- I'm not a big fan of this style, but I LOVE this freaking beer."
"Opinion: This is a really good beer, and must be a pretty darn fresh example as this is the best example of this beer that I have had. As the beer warms, you realize how complex it is, and to come across this balanced and refreshing is an achievement. This is a hard style to make, and this is a great example. I will certainly drink this beer again, and I can only hope that it is as fresh as this one is."
"This is a good Kolsch from one of the authentic Kolsch breweries, so it really should define the style. However, I can't help but really appreciate what American brewers have done and how they've seemed to improved upon the original character of this German style."
"Not much to write home about with this beer. Maybe okay for a session beer, but too expensive in the US for that."
"The drinkability is good, very refreshing, prosit, MK"
" Wavz"
"Pours a brilliant, light gold with a white head that settles quickly. A biscuity malt aroma with a faint fruitiness. Taste of delicate malt with a subtle fruity ester and a dry, almost metallic finish. Thin and drinkable; true to style. A good session beer with more interest than most."
"The appearance is rich yellow with a slight foamy head that quickly dissipates. It is exactly what one would expect for this style. The smell is more complex than one might expect however. It is filled with subtle tones of herbs, cheap chardonnay, fruit and medicine. It's taste is not much different. But that is not such a bad thing. It is a refreshing drink. You could drink several of them on a warm day. It reminds me of most American beer. It is clean, refreshing, watery and very drinkable. The only problem I have is that it has an odd taste of mold buried in the mix that I find obviously objectionable. I would drink another though if it presented itself."
"Drinkability - this is decent, but not great. This holds down drinkability for me."
"The body is very light, like drinking a carbonated water. The taste is very clean, washing the flavors away quickly. Quite a drinkable beer for those who can truly appreciate subtlety."
"Pours a light straw color with frothy white head that fades away to nothing pretty quickly. Smells slightly of yeast and not much else. Tastes very light but balanced, a little sweet. Mouthfeel is a little creamy and a little fizzy. Very true to style and very drinkable."
"Drinkablity: A very drinkable ale , nice and refreshing. Interesting aroma and flavors. Pleasant complexity."
"Pours from the bottle to a nice golden yellow, with some carbonation, and a little white head that floats on top, but no lacing. Although this looks like a BMC pour, it actually has an aroma of faint nuts and honey, and a tasty flavor that ends with a smooth finish. This was not a great beer, but actually was not too bad, and it would make a good session beer."
"When I recently visited the Köln area I took the opportunity to try and sample as many varieties of kölsch that I could find. Reissdorf ranks # 1 on BA so my expectations were high. I opened the bottle and it poured with a nice straw yellow color and a finger of foam. The smell was not so pronounced, but I could sense the hops, some dishrags, and citrus. The taste, like in some other kinds of kölsch, was bitter and sour, followed by bread and some sweetness. In the aftertaste I could make out some herbs as well. The bottled Reissdorf does not measure up to the draught version. Personally, I rank Gaffel a little higher."
"Enjoy! The taste and finding flavors here is what this beer is about!"
"I have to admit that I prefer ales over lagers. However, if this beer is any indication, kolsches are almost ale-like in their flavor profiles. This beer was on tap at Barley John's in New Brighton, MN, poured into glassware from the Reissdorf brewery. The color was a clear dark yellow, with a minimal head and a small amount of lacing on the glass.There is a faintly grassy smell. The taste is soft and creamy, with a pleasant fruitiness and an assertive grassiness. The creamy texture imparts a nice richness to the mouthfeel. This is a perfect light summer thirst quencher. Very well done!"
"I used to think this style was too light and bland to be interesting. But now I can own up: I like Kolsch and I don't care who knows it."
"Nice mouthfeel, touch of grainy cloyingness. Mildly refreshing."
"Very fresh and light beer with a crisp finish and some light but interesting fermentation flavours."
"The mouthfeel is very soft, crisp and refreshing. Some flavors of grain come through with hints of light fruits like pear. The finish has just a touch of hop presence. Pleasantly dry and unassuming. Extremely drinkable and very thirst quenching on this hot August afternoon."
"D- This is the pinnacle of the style. It has good dry malt flavors that stand out even though they are pale malts with that distinctive Kolsch flavor that so few beers have."
"D: A good beer that I'd love to drink again."
"Notes: This was my first Kolsch and I will be tring more, but take that into consideration when reading my review."
"Notes: A refresher on a hot day, but don't know if I'd go back to it that often. Not enough punch for me, flavor-wise."
"16.9 oz (500ml) brown bottle with no freshess date. Pours a beautiful crystal clear golden straw color with a nice fluffy head that hangs around. Crisp, clean aroma of green apples and pale malt. Taste is clean, dry and refreshing with just the right amount of carbonation. Goes down almost too easy. The gold standard for the style. On a hot summer day in the Carolinas, it just doesn't get much better that this folks."
"Not a great beer, but good to drink as a sessioner on a hot summers day."
"Fluffy white foam caps this clear, light gold brew. Some chunky lace and decent head retention. Light apple fruitiness in the aroma, along with some spicy hops and mild malt. Light bitterness, spicy hops. Finishes with some fruity esters. Light body, medium carbonation, crisp and clean. A decent beer that seems appropriate for summer."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a light pale malt scent along with a mild hop bitterness and a dry yeast aroma. The taste is average. It has a light pale malt flavor with a dry musty finish. It's slightly bitter with a crisp, clean aftertaste. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is an easy drinking beer, but nothing great. It's light and refreshing."
"Pours pale gold with a slightly imperfect clarity. Fizzy one and a half finger head, decent retention but no lacing. Pale and pilsener malt nose, with a whiff of white wine. Pilsener malt and tart vinous flavor upfront, followed by mild noble hop aftertaste like hallertau and saaz. Dry mouthfeel, very-well balanced and fully attentuated. Light bodied with a crisp carbonation. Very refreshing with a superb drinkability, this is the right choice for humid summer nights on the porch."
"D: So drinkable that I can't tell that I'm drinking it (if that makes sense). The glass is empty, full, and empty again before I even notice. Refreshing and perfect."
"Very drinkable. Refreshing, cleansing."
"I know little about this style, but from what I can tell, this one hits all the right notes in at least an adequate, if not impressive, fashion. And the drinkability of this beer is undeniable. I hope this is still on sale next week when I'll have my next chance to snap up a few more."
"D - Very, very drinkable. Perfect on a hot day and so refreshing it hurts."
"Excellent drinkabilty. I drank mine ice cold and in a a pilsner glass - excellent."
"Taste is also somewhat nutty. In fact it's odd, I mean I expected (not sure why) some sort of fruity characters, at least a hint, based on the appearance. But there's nothing, I mean it's the slightest bit hoppy and slightly beer-nutzy flavoured. But it's more watery than anything else. I have to say I'm disappointed. This is dull and flavourless."
"Didn't much care for this one. By all accounts it's a good representation of the style, but it was my first Kolsch, so maybe I'm just need to know what to expect. Think I'll try it again... in a few years."
"The beer came in a 11.2 oz. longneck brown bottle. When poured out looked pretty similar to a Pilsner, with a pale yellow clear body, and a foamy, white head. The aroma was clean, and lemony and didnt have much else going on. The taste was a bit more complicated that a Pilsner, with delicate sourness being the primary taste, followed by a hint of lemon rind, and a subtle fruity sweetness. The body was thin, but the beer was as refreshing as they get."
"If I understand the style correctly, this beer is right on. The delicate flavors are beautifully done, with the malt shining brightly. I really like this beer, and this style. I need to try more kolsch."
"500ml bottle."
"Super drinkable & a very good example of style that isn't a favorite, but sure hits the spot on a warm day. Big beer addicts may not like, but that would be their loss!"
"I'm being a bit conservative in my ratings despite my current opinion that this is a great beer. I would definitely have it again, and would definitely session it."
"On tap at Maduro in Madison, WI. Pale straw color, thin white head. Aromas of englsih muffins and straw. Slight fruitiness (pears and apples I think) in the flavor, plenty of bisquits, and just a touch of spice. Very mild and mellow. Easily downable. Wonderfully refreshing. Cant wait to sit on the patio at Maduro and drink this come July! Would make an excellent aperitif. It seems to clean and awaken the palate."
"D: This is an excelent kolsch that is very smooth and easy to drink. I imagine that this could turn into one of my favorite porch beers this summer."
"It is rare to find an actual Kölsch from Köln, at least in these parts, this one is the only example Ive found. As far as I can tell, Reissdorf Kölsch is a benchmark of the style and if you like light, refreshing flavorful lager like ale or if youd like to see what the American Micros are trying to copy pick up some Reissdorf... they brew one thing and they brew it well."
"from the 500ml bottle. poured a yellow, with a medium sized white head that left no lacing. aroma, a mild yeast and malt aroma with some sour citrus and a hint of skunk but not bad. flavor sweet, malt, and hops, a slight bitterness, and the good thing no skunk. this was a very easy to drink before I knew it it was gone"
"A good choice as a macro alternative."
"Understandable why this Kolsch ranks amoung BA's top beers. A great granny smith apple with lemon-lime citrus characters in the nose and flavors. Lightly malty and lightly grainy, but not to distract. Moderately bready and yeasty. A light, but round and complete body. A crystal clear straw color with bleached white, less-than-fizzy head. Lightly minty in the finish, very clean and refreshing. Hard to find a better summertime beer."
"Very drinkable and quite refreshing. This is a pretty good kolsch and would pick it up again."
"Arrived a crystal-clear golden yellow with moderate creamy head and no lace. Smells grainy, hoppy, faintly minty and honey-like. Nice but restrained flavors. Dominated by grainy malt and hops and balanced with honey sweetness and slight mint notes. Big carbonated and quenching lightness in the mouth. An easy drinking and a pleasant way to start an evening. Have it before your other selections since they will completely overwhelm the delicate lightness of this beer."
"Drinkability: Relatively dry with a clean palate, yet a bit more substantial and smooth than a standard pils; this is a decent session beer."
"D - Okay. Good for both food pairings and sessioning. However, it is a mediocre beer at best. I am not a huge koelsch fan, but this has little to no character."
"First of all, I'm not a big fan of the style, but this one is light, flavorful, and worth a try. Too bad all Kolsch's aren't as clean and well rounded as this one."
"I could session this for the right price. I'll drink it in Germany."
"Pours a pale gold color, crystal clear and moderate head. Bready smell with slight hop notes. This brew has a light crisp taste that is very dry all the way through. Sweet malts dominate flavor with dry floral hops rounding out the end. This is a decent kolsch, but I've had better and strangely enough from an american brewery (Indian River)."
"A solid warm weather brew. Nothing I'd really hunt down again (I prefer Good Island's take personally), but certainly still a good beer."
"Having said that, this isn't a challenging beer either. While there is nothing not to like about this beer, many people might not find something TO like either. So, if you want to go out with some buddies and just knock back a few, this is the beer for it; if you want to sit back and appreciate something complex, get something else."
"this is a beer that would fit in just fine as a warm weather session beer. not sure on the age of this one (as its come a long way) but would like to try it fresh. easily drinkable as it is."
"Taste: Light, sweet grains, grasses, and malt hit the tip of the tongue immediately. The beer quickly dried out with the flavors of husky grains and spicy hops and yeast. Some honey-like sweetness came back in the aftertaste."
"Overall a pretty solid kolsch. I'd have another no prob and is quite an easy drinker and very sessionable if need be. Better for those warmer days, but works any Ol' time too."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/4"" off-white head above the golden brew. Head fades at a reasonable pace, with sticky average to good lacing. Aroma is lightly of pale malt and fruity hops, but fleeting. Taste is upfront with quick sweetness, then giving way to somewhat characterless hops bitterness, but still reasonably balanced. Mouthfeel is a bit above average, and drinkability is as well, although most representatives of the style are nicely drinkable too. This one just left me wanting a bit more, but nothing detrimental in this bottle."
"Looking forward to some local American versions as the summer winds down."
"Pours a bright golden straw, crystal clear, with a nice sized white head that settles slowly to a small cap. Smell is a subtle floral hop scent over a slightly earthy pale malt. Taste definitely leans towards the sweet malts with a strong earthy and slightly nutty flavor coming through as the beer warmed up a little and a very delicate floral hop finish. Very clean and dry with almost no aftertaste . This is a very nice Kölsch, flavorful enough to keep you interested, but simple enough to be a nice refreshing session beer."
"Nice easy drinking beer, would be a nice session beer. I would drink this again, I've had a couple of other Kolsch's, but this is the best example I've tried so far."
"I can't believe Reissdorf Kolsch is anywhere near the gold standard for the kolsch style, but it's a drinkable little thirst quencher that makes no missteps on its journey from bottle to glass to mouth to points beyond. Enjoyable."
"This is not an especially flavorful beer. The taste is blasé and nondescript with no lace and no real character. Just a drab grainy puddle of yellow stuff with bubbles. At best its inoffensive, but overall a letdown."
"Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, smooth, bubbles throughout. Overall a drinkable beer, easy and light, but that aftertaste just kills something for me."
"Clean, classic German ale. In a word? Subtle and quaffable. Oh, crap...that was 3 wasn't it? Oh well...you get the point."
"Golden color like a lager, which scared me a bit at first, but the mildly hoppy, woodsy aroma with hints of citrus intrigued me. This kolsch ale has a crisp mouthfeel and a smooth, laid back taste. Its not a full-flavor, full-bodied beer, but it held my interest much longer than a lager would. Surprisingly refreshing, though. Perfect for a hot, dry afternoon or evening. Serve on the colder side...not an ale to be had at ""cellar"" temps."
"Served in the classic tall cylinder at the Map Room in Chicago, that I believe the Germans refer to as a ""cartridge"". A very light, blonde Kolsch that is rather dry with mineralish notes hidden among toasted malt and slightly spicy hops. Not much an aroma. A very drinkable beer, with a subtle complexity. It took a great effort to let his beer warm up a bit too notice its personality. I really liked sort of slightly slate-like mineral component in this beer."
"The taste is nice round bready malt hand in hand with mildly bitter hops from start to drying finish. Smooth and balanced, with a sturdy and persistent carbonation. Wonderfully drinkable."
"Crisp and refreshing. Very easy to drink. Light bodied but not at all watery. Very nice to cool off while grilling outside on a hot summer day"
"500 ml bottle, at the foreign beer bar of the 32nd Cambridge Beer Festival. (Was also available on draught there, but not when I decided to sample it.) This was my first Kölsch ever, as far as I can remember. Moderate head, yellow colour. Looks like a pilsener or a helles, smells like a decent pilsener: grass, hints of tropical fruits. Flavour nearly like a decent helles or one of the better pale lagers, but a slight yeastiness betrays its origin. Decent, but did not impress me."
"I drank this beer on one of the first hot days of the year and it was very refreshing. It poured pale yellow with a thin white head. It actually looked a lot like most macro beers. The smell was nothing that special. I could pick up a slight malt aroma and a very small hint of lemon. The taste was very clean without tremendous amount of flavor and the mouthfeel was thin. The carbonation was nice making this a very refreshing and drinkable beer. A definite step up from an adjunct lager lawnmower beer, but I prefer styles with a little more backbone. Also, I enjoyed this beer most when it was good and cold...around 40 degrees."
"Overall, not a bad beer, certainly easy drinking, flavor is nice and subtle and there are no off flavors in this one. Not really much else to say about it. It's a Kolsch."
"Light in the mouthfeel, but that adds to the delicate nature of this brew. The drinkability is where this beer scores best. The bite from the hops is quick and clean, which makes it a good beer to wash down dinner. That quick bite is good for clearing the palate between bites."
"I'm starting to like kolsch a lot more, and I think this is one of the better ones I've had. Definitely a nice example of the style."
"This is a brew that requires a more careful examination to identify subtle flavors and fragrances. Nothing except the appearance profile jumps out as obvious or easy to characterize."
"Note: the BA with whom I traded for this beer was kind enough to include the proper glass in the trade and I believe it made a difference in how this beer came across."
"Dense, bright white head. Barely hazy, pale straw colored beer. Faint aroma is a bit grainy and barely sweet. Slightly sweet grainy malt flavor and a pinch of lemon up front. Hops provide enough bitterness to balance out the mild sweetness from the malt. A nice, light, refreshing beer."
"My first good example of the style."
"This Reissdorf is interesting because I had another one of these that was much better and much more Kolsch like. Interesting."
"Theres nothing remarkable or exciting here but its a clean, simple beer that I enjoyed with a turkey sub. I have a feeling that I'm missing the kolsch boat here until I try more within the style."
"Gorgeous golden color in the collins glass. Plenty of bubbles and a large rocky head dominate the view. Nice crisp sweet odor. The taste started clean and sweet (but not cloying) and then a balance of hops hit without destroying the malt goodness. The finish was crisp and dry. Mouthfeel was light to medium as expected for the style. An exceptionally easy quaff. When I can find it, I'll have some on hand as an excellent alternative to the big or hoppy beers. Refreshing and tasty."
"Pours a hazy bright golden with a nice white head that leaves some lacing in my glass, bready apple aromas. Apple, pear, lemon and cracker flavors. Medium bodied with a crisp, carbonated mouthfeel, finishes clean. This may be the best of this style I have ever tried, very drinkable."
"Nice 16.9 oz bottle to perfectly fill my grolsch glassware. It poured with a well formed, well sized, and cloudy head. The body is very clear and very light golden. The nose can best be described as fresh and certainly malty. The mouthfeel is crisp and clear cut, a refreshing edge. There is a big juicy malt taste that gives you just enough of a grainy side to improve the texture. The finish brings a little more balance with just enough hop bitterness (that was lacking in the body) to please the palate. Finally, the final essence remaining in the mouth is a pleasant floral bouquet. A solid kolsch."
"Light and clear yellow appearance, less than gold but bright on a sunny afternoon. Nice head, lasts at 1/2 an inch for a good amount of time. Ample but simple laces. Bracing aroma, cider-like in apples and less-than-ripe pears. Light body, carbonation is crisp but not getting excessive. Flavor is nice, dry as baking powder biscuits before the butter, cracker-like and featuring cutting hop aridity. If the hops were more pointedly sharp, this brew would be almost Pilsner-like. Finishes with a snap and a message something like ""this beer just balanced itself -- try it again and see""...really drinkable."
"Overall: my first German kolsch, this is definitely a work of art."
"This brew is a somewhat hazy, paler-gold color, nice big bubbly white head on the top. Some lace trails. Light sweet malt nose, some lemon elements. Taste is nice sweet malt front, some fruitiness to the beer. Hops light as to be expected, but not completely silent. Pretty crisp mouth. I like this style, a nice light refreshing brew. This is a good one."
"The price was right on this beer, so it came home with me tonight. It pours a nice brilliant yellow color with slight golden hues, and a nice billowing 3 finger head that seens to want to stay around. The nose is nicely balanced between some noble German hops (saaz or hallertau, not sure which) and a clean sweet malt, slightly honey-like, but not overwhelming. The flavor is not bad either. There is a slight sweetness that quickly moves to a grainey, but not harsh, flavor. The hop is light on the finsih, but it is fitting with the rest of the beer. This one is nice and refreshing, with a moderate body and lively carbonation. Overall, a very fine beer. Its not a style I have often, but one I may visit more often after this one."
"I have been waiting to get my hands on some Kolsch. This is a very interesting beer with a extremely refreshing taste. The body is almost cider-looking with a sticky head that left nice lacing down my glass. The aroma some dry, rotting-fruit hints. That may sound bad, but it blends nicely with the hop aroma. I would like to know what hops are used in Kolsch to use in a homebrew. The mouthfeel is a little off-balance. There is a medicine aftertaste accompanied by a dry, rough finish. I don't see this a medal-winning beer, but it is definately an interesting take on a german ale."
"My review can't do this beer justice. It's great stuff."
"Appropriately light, this would be best suited as something to have a pint or 3 of with dinner; tasty and refreshing without demanding much attention. A very nice change of pace from American hop-bomb IPAs and malt-monster stouts."
"This will go great with simple dishes liked grilled chicken, shrimp or soups. I know many people think of Kolsch as a summer type beer, but this one is wonderful year around. A winner here folks!"
"Tasty is another one too. I wouldn't mind sucking down a dozen of these, 200 mils at a time. A new-found joy in a new-found style."
"John"
"Pours a clear light gold with a tight white head. Poured into a 6 oz straight sided glass to try to repoduce the kolsch glass. Smell is of a bit of grain and friut and not much of hops.. It is a clean crisp smell. Taste is the same. A bit of gain but more just of smooth true beer with a bit of drying hops at the end. Bretty bubbly and carbonated, but If one is looking for a session brew.. Here is your Ticket... drinkable from dawn til dusk or visa versa!!"
"Sampled 5/13/04"
"Taste: nice, tasty hop appearance at the fore, with a definite citric snap, then fading, though giving a nice glide off of the palate. Pears and apples again in the flavor,light,dry fruits, crisp and subtle. Kolschs are such a light, delicate style that it is sometimes difficult to discern the differences between authentic examples. This is a nice one, but not top of the heap. Superlative thirst-quencher, though, easy to appreciate in the dog days of August!"
"on tap at Hallo Berlin in NYC. Light pissy yellow, with a crisp looking white head with not much retention observed, minimal lacing. Nose of hops. Crisp tasting. Clean malt notes, nice and refreshing for a summers evening. Fairly dry and snappy hop fueled finish. Nice quaffer"
"The beer after its separation from the 500ml brown bottle set in the glass the quintessential unclouded gold with a dinosauric sized head that is spumescent in texture, the color a brilliant white as it ever so slowly dematerializes, the lace then forms a satin sheet to lie upon the glass. The nose is fresh, crisp, clean with nice malt sweetness, and the start quite sweet with a pleasant malt profile, the top is prototypical in its light feel to the palate. Finish has a fair to middling acidity, the hops apropos to the style, spicy but pleasant to the palate, very dry and lingering aftertaste, a real refreshing change of pace from the over the top hopped beers I normally favor, quite drinkable and a nice Arizona summer beer."
"I haven't had a German brew in a while, and I'm beginning to think the 1516 Bavarian law has boxed them into making beers just to style, but with no inspiration. There was nothing at all special about this beer. It wasn't that it was bad, it just was..."
"Not bad, but a little too one dimensional. This is not the first example of the style I would grab."
"Sampled in a German/American restaurant with some good, authentic German food, so I'm sure this favorably colored my perception of the beer. Poured a bright, slightly hazy golden. Aroma was a touch bready. Solid mouthfeel, a bit lively on the tongue. Edges a little toward sweetness, with some well-refined grain notes. Very clean, yet no dryness. Not particularly distinctive on its own, but then this style is pretty low-key."
"500 ml bottle pours a clear amber body, with a thick, 2 cm offwhite head. Minimal lacing. Aroma has fresh grass and lemony hops, on top of a smooth malt sweetness. A hint of spearmint is picked up in the background. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation. Taste is mostly hoppy lemon and fresh mown hay. The malt is soft and understated, but provides good balance. A decent Kolsch, overall, but I'm not a big fan of this style. Nicely drinkable."
"From the bottle pours a bright golden clear liquid with a white foamy head. The head stayed for a long time, and there was a decent amount of lace on the glass. Smell was slightly floral and somewhat skunky, almost stale. Taste was pretty sewwt in the front followed by a dryness with a modest amount of hop bitterness. It had a slightly floral finish, but was also slightly sour. Light body and high carbonation. Overall, I think I may have an old bottle. I have had this before from the tap and when it was fresher it was quite good. I would be willing to try again with a fresher sample, because I can see this would be good and refreshing."
"Poured out a straw color with a nice amount of carbonation. Smell consisted of malt mostly mixed in with some grass aroma and some wheat/grain blended in with some fruit. Taste was very clean. Grain and wheat hit the palate gently along with some malts. Gets slighty sweet towards the end. Really good brew towards the summer months."
"Some citrusy hop persistence in the background but the flavor profile is mostly crisp, pale malt. Lightly fruity and grassy. SOme fizz and just a hint of skunk. Very crisp and clean with a lightly bitter aftertaste. Very easy to drink. Know what this tastes like? Ballantine XXX. I thought this was my first foray into kolsch but it is just like Ballantine, one of my favorite cheap standbys. Think I'll stick with a sixer of Ballantine cans, this doesn't show me much else to warrant import prices. Maybe I'll save kolsch for a future trip to Cologne..."
"Drinkability - easy enough going down. Not spectacular but a genuinely drinkable quality beer."
"Overall: In general, I prefer sweeter, darker, thicker beers than this. So it's hard for me to rate this beer objectively. But it was a good change of pace, and I enjoyed the tantalizing hints of sugary sweetness at the beginning. Certainly a good, refreshing summer beer."
"Pale golden yellow in color.Nice carbonation level and head.Aroma of malt and slight hopiness.Nice upfront bitterness-doesnt linger however.Somewhat soft malt in the backround.Relatively smooth and pleasant mouthfeel.Pleasant all around.Nice beer-great for a warm summer's day.."
"Mouthfeel is clean and crisp, and the malt lasts on the tongue for a bit after swallowing. Lighter bodied and refreshing. Extremely drinkable."
"I like the balance, smoothness and the overall drinkability. A guy needs a nice summer ale and this one will do."
"Light, crisp and refreshing. This isn't my style of beer, but I liked this one."
"So pale in color I can see my entire hand with great clarity as I peer at it from the front of my glass. A simple snowy white head accompanies one through the journey. Aromas are at once yeasty/bready-all sweet grain. The mouthfeel is crisp, clean and moderately refreshing. Flavors are malt focused, though a slight bitter provides balance. This is a simple brew bound for simpler fare. I can see a plate of veal sausages, cheeses, bretzels, shnitzel all working here. A rather drinkable choice for the happily un-challenged imbiber."
"My first kolsch, and though it's not a jaw-dropping style, it's a nice session beer, and one I'd likely have again."
"Clear gold with a moderate white head. The aroma is herbal noble hops, and a little dry malt. The flavor is dry straw malt with hop bitterness finishing it out. Not bad, easy drinking, although I'd probably have trouble telling it apart from a decent German pilsner in a blind taste test."
"Pours with a one-finger white head, fades quickly but leaves some lace. Clear, golden amber color with a faint hoppy nose. Medium carbonation, starts with a balance of hops and malt and makes a hoppy finish. Clean and light bodied. $2.50 for a 500ml bottle."
"I tried this again from a 5 liter German keg can, and boy was it good! A golden/yellow liquid flowed out of the tapa nd the head was fluffy and as white as the purest german snow. This head was thicker than the one I got from the bottle, and it also left better intricate lacing patterns as well. The aromas are excellent. This brew has the aromas of lemon peels, light floral hops, and a light biscuity malt flavor. The taste follows suit with the lovely malts up front and in the middle, and the biting hops on the backend with that lingering citrus and biscuit finish. The finish has a wonderful hop bite to it as well. The mouthfeel is light and spirtzy and the drinkability is perfect. A nice kolsch, even better from the German mini-keg cans!"
"Super drinkable brew."
"Overall- Reissdorf Kolsch Ale was a weak attempt at a German-made PBR! PBR is much better!!!"
"I have had this beer on tap at Ludwigs and it seemed better than this bottled version. Slightly disappointed. This beer poured a pale and translucent light golden yellow. Well carbonated and topped by a thinning white head. Some fruity grains in the aroma. Fruity sweet tangy malts in the taste. This seems more sweeter than dry with a sweetly light body of grains with a slight winey finish. Light bodied with a crisp finish. Pleasantly drinkable, but nothing all that special."
"I just happened across this beer during my last trip to Lexington. When I opened the 500ml and poured in the glass I began to get excited. The light golden color was exactly what I thought a great kolsch should be. The pour was excellent, started with a good 1 - 1-1/4 inch head that quickly went away leaving the perfect white froth on top. The slightly fruity and very slighty spicy aroma left alot to be desired, this was probably the only let down in the bottle. The slight hop bite at the tip of the tongue followed by a smooth finish that can only be called refreshing just screamed kolsch to me. Behind alt this is my favorite German style. I would recommend this brew to anyone who wanted to try kolsch for the first time, it's a great example of the style."
"A well-balanced, easy drinking brew, Reissdorf kolsch is one of the better kolsches I've sampled. This would make for a good summer refresher."
"It poured a clear light gold with evident carbonation, it had a thin white head that quickly disipated. It smelled of hops and spice. The Kolsch tasted very hoppy with little malt. It had a nice tinge of bitterness at the finish. It's feel was oily and light bodied. Not a bad beer, but not a great beer. I had never had a Kolsch before, but it sure appears that the style has been copied often by many American beers."
"pours a light clear golden colour with minimal head. the appearance is light-looking, but healthy. certainly more golden and colourful than a macro. the smell is grainy, with wheat a bit of butter, some hop and some sweetness as well. the taste here isn't bad. it's pretty much the same as the smell but less sweet and more buttery with a grain finish. the problem with this style (for me) is that i've always found it to be rather boring. could this be a decent session brew? sure, but i'd rather a boatload of other brews with more flavour for my session brew than this one. i certainly wouldn't complain about having to drink this kolsch again, but it's not a must try brew in my book."
"The bottle screams German, with its towering presence and imposing red, white, and gold label. The beer is clear yellow with a foamy white head that doesn't stick around long. The smell is on the light side, with just a trace of hops. The taste is also a bit subdued. Although some malty flavor comes through with just enough hops to be detectable, nothing distinguishes it as an outstanding-or really even better than average-beer. It might make a decent introductory beer for those looking to expand their horizons, but at $3.50 for a 500 ml. bottle, it's a somewhat pricey experiment."
"I think I may have had one Kolsch quite some time ago. This is the first time I tried this one. Very light, carbonated and dry. This is probably what Miller High Life aspires to be (""the champagne of beers""), because this beer has somewhat similar characteristics. Overall, a bit light for my tastes, but as good as most lagers or pils I've had. Small, fizzy head, very little retention or lace. Just a nice, ""spritzy"" little beer."
"Its become unavoidable, in this week's visit to Köln, for me to believe the word kölsch as a synonym with mediocre. That's my opinion when I think of this brew which rather impersonates a simple, light bodied lager like brew with a hint of a refreshing acidity to it. However, it is in itself rather flat despite the head; rather tasteless despite the properties, and without even an overdoing in the hops- which is a general way to pick them up the ground. I'm done with reissdorf for a while or a lifetime, even if coming back to cologne."
"There aren't many beers I can drink a liter of and want more, Reissdorf Kölsch is one of them."
"Overall: Good ale for lager lovers"
"I just got a sample taste of this at our homebrew club meeting, but enough to act like a beer judge, so here goes: Malty, with a kind of raw grainy texture to it. A pleasing extra kick of hops. Nice bubbly zest typical for its style. So far, the only ""true"" German Kölsch I've had."
"Crisp, clean, and refreshing. Everything American big brews claim to be in their commercials, I guess. Pours a nice golden hue with a pretty large head that lingers for a few minutes. A faint grassy, clean aroma. Tastes very nice, almost yeasty. Hard to find any hops in this one. If only it were a bit more affordable in the states, this would be a near-perfect session beer."
"My bottle poured out a nice golden color with a nice head which remained for a good while. It might be my nose but there was nothing exceptional about the smell of this brew. However, I did enjoy the beer itself. It was crisp with enough carbonation to liven up my tastebuds. This , to me, would be a nice beer to have when you're going to enjoy more than one."
"Pale golden color with a blooming white head that dies rather quickly, having sparse carbonation. Smells malty, earthy and funky in an ale sense (kind of like a wet dog). Hops are there, but subtle. Tastes malty, light and refreshing; with a nice florally, dry hop finish. Carbonation is minimal other than a few streaming bubbles, which I feel draws back from the overall experience in this beer. I could, however, drink quite a few of these on a hot summery day."
"Comments  This authentic Kolsch ale, brewed in Köln, had some characteristics of a very good example. I thought the appearance was right on target, and the soft fruits playing with the light hops was terrific. It missed the mark in other areas though, especially the aroma. A near miss in my book but a good effort nevertheless."
"However, a word of advice, while Reissdorf is a very good beer there are better varieties of Kölsch to be had in Köln."
"Taste is not too much different than a hefe, surprisingly. Bready and yeasty with some hop bitterness in the finish. Crisp and refreshing carbonation makes it nice to quaff alot of it on a hot day. Overall, a nice German Kolsch."
"Light gold color, medium white foamy head. Aroma is fruity, grainy and sweet. A light bodied Kolsch ale. Lightly malted and slightly hoppy. There is a subtle, not overbearing lemony taste. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is crisp. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"Never had this style but it seems just like any German lager to me. Does have a sight hop presence in the aroma but only slightly bitter tasting. Kind of bland for an ale with little flavor. Fresh tasting none the less and a good thirst quencher that went well with a German style lunch."
"Pours a straw cior with a pretty good fluffy head,aroma is malty with some fruitiness with the German-like iron aroma.Flavor is softly malty with some nice light fruitiness with a delicate floweriness to it.High quality and easy to drink I would recommend this on a warm summer day for sure"
"Poured with a clear golden body and a thin lacy white head. It has a malty nose with just a hair of fruitiness, and a bit of grass. The flavor was more reminiscent of a bock than a kolsch, with a very malty flavor, with hints of caramel and wheat. Smooth, warm mouthfeel, with a fair bit of body, and a bit of a dry aftertaste. Pleasantly drinkable."
"There is nothing overpowering about this beer, it's just a refreshing, thirst quenching, highly drinkable beer. Everything a Kölsch is supposed to be."
"There was nothing all that special that stood out with this beer.It was just an easy drinking beer with no outstanding characteristics to rave about.It was just another beer.It poured a small sized white head with fine-medium sized bubbles that quickly dissipated.The body was clear with slowly rising carbonation with a straw yellow hue.The nose was malty and hoppy and some fruit notes?The flavor a little bit acidic with some hops notes.It had a thin, watery texture to it and it was also smooth and light bodied.There was virtually no lacing."
"Brilliant, clear light-gold hue, bubbly white head that reached a smidge over a fingers worth, good retention, spotty lace. The nose is lightly malty (with very light fruitiness) lacks in potency and depth, it did improve as it warmed. Mediocre, at best. Shockingly malty palate, tremendously tasty! Slight graininess, caramel hints too the hops bitterness is very mild with some grassy flavors added distant whispers of sweet vanilla. Somewhat dry. Minimal malty aftertaste. Damn good. Medium-body, mild carbonation, pleasant mouthfeel. Very drinkable lovely. This completely changes the way I look at Kölsch beers, for the better. Recommended."
"Completely clear with light golden straw color. A substantial fine, white head with minimal lacing but a bit of persistent carbonation. Smell is more pleasant and strong than expected in a beer that looks so light. Crisp grains rule the day with some breadiness and a dash of spice. Grainy taste that doesn't vary a great deal from start to finish, though the latter gets dires a bit. A hint of fruit is present too, though I can't pin it down. Eminently soft mouthfeel with a little crispness to make it interesting."
"Lightly fruity aroma is slammed by a more basic, grain-like nose. All malt and fruit in the flavor. Sweet hints of apples, peaches, and perhaps wet wood. As it warms, the flavor shifts towards the finish, which is grassy and herbal tea-like. Dry. Understated hop bitterness. A little on the thin side of medium-bodied. God-friggin-damn drinkable."
"A crystal clear golden body topped by a rather thin white head that creates moderate lacing. The nose is mostly malt with hints of fruit that portray a lightness that really isn't isn't present in the taste. This is a very nice Kolsch that imparts lovely crispness in the finish. I found this to be a thoroughly refreshing late summer beer with good feel and drinkability."
"Flavor is initially malty, with hops appearing about halfway through the sip and finishing the beer crisp and clean. Almost no aftertaste, save a touch of pale malt. Well carbonated and refreshing. Kolsch is a wonderful style, when it's done correctly..."
"This is what the Kolsch style should taste like. On draught, this pours a light golden straw with a frothy, white head that leaves rings of lace down the glass. Although it does need occasional agitation, the head sticks around for the duration of the brew. Aroma is a pleasant blend of almost spicy, relatively bitter hops and a fresh, yeasty profile as well. This is a flavorful brew, with a sweetish, full malt character that melds well with the predominantly bitter, but overall mild German hops. Oddly enough, notes of oak/wood seem present, as well. The mouthfeel is quite smooth with mild carbonation. As the brew warms up a bit, it becomes almost syrupy, but in a good way. Incredibly drinkable, this would be an excellent summer thirst quencher -- all that a Kolsch should be! Definitely worth a try, especially if you can locate it on draught."
"When I think of just a plain old beer, simple yet tasty, this would be it. It poured a nice golden yellow, with a good head. Slightly bitter, but not very. Clean tasting, almost to a point of refreshing. A slight ""gruff"" taste of rawness as it slides down your throat. Very good indeed."
"Overall it's a very simple and refreshing beer. This is almost what I would imagine bud tasted like before it got mass produced."
"A very clear almost yellw color with very little head. Aroma was slightly bready and spicy. Taste showed a good bit of grain as well as hop bitterness. Very crisp and drinkable. Looking at my score, I realize I enjoyed the beer more than the numbers reflect. Is it a great beer? No, but I will buy it more often than some beers I've given higher reviews...it just so damn drinkable."
"Grain aromas with a slight sweetness. Grain carries through to the flavor where other malt flavors come through but are quite subdued. Not much bitterness at all. Beer poured a clear gold in color with a fine bubbles coming from the well carbonated brew."
"This is my first foray into the world of Kolsch beers, and I am impressed and eager for more. Can't believe this is an ale. A wonderful beer to sip, a great mix of flavors."
"This Kölsch poured a clear, straw-yellow color with creamy, thick white foam that eventually settled but did not leave much lace. The smell was mild: slightly sweet malt and grain. The taste was very malty (slightly sweet) with a hint of hops and biscuit. The mouthfeel was a bit thin (medium-light body) with low carbonation feel, but was smooth. The drinkability was decent: very easy to drink. I found the tap version a bit more tasty."
"500ml bottle. Pours a straw yellow with a nice white head, that receded fairly quickly. Smell of the malt and hops is present but not overpowering. Decent carbonation, a pleasing taste. This would make a great session beer. I could definetly drink this all night."
"This is a great summer beer. I wish more of its cousins from Cologne were available in the States."
"Awesome Kölsch."
"Crystal clear straw color with a nice looking white head sitting on top. The nose is very inviting. The malt subtleties really play a tune for my nose. And seemingly, some noble hop accents. I like the soft malt tones on the tongue. Pilsner-like maltiness, but not as heavy. Some minor fruitiness is noted. A tanginess from some wheat malt perhaps. And very subtle hop flavor from what I believe is a Hallertau or something similar. Surprisingly big body. At least medium-full. Creamy texture on the tongue allows this one to slide down with ease. Pretty enjoyable, but not the grand experience I was in search of."
"I suspect that my bottle of Reissdorf may have been skunked; afterall, I bought it in Williamsburg, VA, and there's no telling how long it had been sitting on the shelf. If I'm ever in Köln, I'll give this beer another try."
"pat"
"The flavor starts out sweet with a nice pale malt content, it then gets joined with a nice hoppiness. A little bit of fruits. Very crisp start that smoothes to an almost creamy feel. Good session beer, and it accompanies a meal very well."
"Prost!"
"A cross-dressed ale. Pours a bright streaming golden under a wafer cap of white sticky fur. Nose of strawberry-hop jam on a burnt match cracker. Mellow flavor runs toasty sweet wrapped in romaine. Easily drained, but a smidgen too sulfurous for pounding."
"Brilliantly clear, straw golden forming a tenuous white head atop medium-sized bubbles. Retention is just ok, and lacing is sparse. Carbonation is moderate. Aroma is faint with dry, grassy hops, a whiff of sulfur, oolong tea, and (like Putnam notes) milk that is starting to turn sour. Mouthfeel is bright upon the back of the tongue with a thin body. Initially grassy flavors up front with a hint of yeast and straw, unpleasant sulfur and vegetable notes in the middle, followed by a lightly dry, champage-like cedary finish with a light dose of bittering hops and subtle graininess. This brew is akin to a US domestic macrobrew in every way. If I were blinded, I would guess it was an A-B product. There is no real substance or appealing qualities to this beer. Although it is average in every respect, I have no desire to drink one ever again."
"Overall: Whilst I appreciate that this is a Kölsch Bier, I feel that it is just a little too delicate, I would have liked it to have a bit oomph in both the Nose and the Taste. Still, it is not a bad offering."
"Pours with a bright white head that settles over clear golden-hued liquid. Gently carbonated. Nose has some sweet malty aromas, with a grassy/hay note. Taste is a clean slightly sticky sweet maltiness, a small amount of fruitiness present too. Hop bitterness makes just a short appearence towards the end...not as much flavor as I was hoping for. Finishes lightly fruity and dry, a nice session beer."
"Brilliant golden hue w/ a well retained white head. Wispy lace remains. Pilsner like clarity. Soft graininess and mildly sweet strawberry like fruitiness in aroma. Trace floral hop nose. Bready pilsner malt sweetness upfront in flavor, followed by mild notes of husk and berryish fruitiness. Mild hop bitterness leaves a pleasant residual sweetness. Light body, w/ a crisp, refreshing mouthfeel. Finishes cleanly sweet and grainy. An innocuous, simple and highly quaffable brew. It possesses pilsner-esque crispness and a restrained, English Bitter like fruitiness. It's the perfect brew to start the evening, since it leaves the palate longing for more. Almost elegant."
"Drinkability: Pretty high for the style. This is a very refreshing brew and would be something I could drink several of in the summer. Good stuff."
"Light gold with a thin white lace that trials down the glass.  Aroma of grass and grain with a touch of vanilla.  Slightly sweet flavor, and very dry and crisp with a light body.  Flavor has grainy and slightly yeasty characteristics.  This is an amazingly complex Kölsch, and would be an excellent brew to relax with on a hot day... hell, even in the middle of October, it's a great beer to relax with."
"Sweet, light, and well-rounded are good descriptions for this beer.  It's a great sit-on-your-deck-in-the-sun brew.  Shallow, but attractive white head didn't last long, but left nice lattice.  Smells faintly of hops.  Foretaste is sweet and malty, and the inital perception is that it's got more body than it, in fact, has.  Grainy and grassy and finishes very light."
"Very nice color. About as golden yellow as beer can get. Formed a thin, fine head. Nose was of grassy hops, almost like corn to me. Nice medium carbonation makes this pretty light beer very drinkable."

"In the history of beer, if the discovery of lager was pre-ordained, then this is an ale that must have served like a road map. If I didn't know any better I would say it was a particularly complex, full-flavored lager. The color is bright yellow with mustard and gold tones. The creamy white head resolves quickly into a splotchy, lunar-surface pattern. The nose is remarkable, with aromas of tangy nectarine, cornflakes, shredded wheat and milk that is just starting to turn sour. The flavors reveal custard, designer water and lemon with a slight sprinkle of bitter herb. Bright, clean and seamless. Absolutely gulpable. Sampled with Kolschs Pyramid (Curveball) and Schell (Zommerfest)."
"I have enjoyed this on tap at Zum Schneider in NYC, but am currently sampling from the bottle; not as good as on tap, but splendid nevertheless. Clear, light golden color with full head that settles, unassuming aroma. Clean, grainy taste with big grassy malts and just the right dry hop sparkle. In the bottle this tastes less like a Kolsch and closer to a golden lager or pilsner. Refreshing and very drinkable, yet dry and clean. Does wonders for settling the stomach. I think this is the only true German Kolsch you can get Stateside, and it's a fine representative."
"Marvellous brew, you could drink this shit all night. Light clear gold/yellow in colour, head doesn't last long, slight sweet malty aroma, with a touch of floral hops, exceptional mouthfeel, slight sweet malty start with a dry hop bitterness. tremendoulsy easy to drink and even quite complex."
"This beer poured a clear golden straw color and formed a nice white head, leaving little lace.  A medium amount of carbonation.  The aroma was of lightly of hops with grainy malt present giving a bit of a breadlike aroma.  The flavor was of hops and was a touch grainy. The finish was a touch tart due to the carbonation.  Haven't tried too many of this style so review may change."
"This is one of THE traditional Kölsch beers out of Germany. You can't really say more than that."
"Notes: Beyond drinkable, this brew is a great way to wet the appetite whether it is before a meal or the beginning of an all night session of drinking."
