"Not my favorite from this series but good beer when paddling your canoe"

"Just ok. Nothing really  great."
"This has a nice Kolsch taste.  The added rye makes the taste slightly heavy for repeatable enjoyment. This is an overall nice beer though."
""

"Really, really, simple beer from Leinenkugel's here with this one."

"Appearance was light yellow with a fizzy head. The smell was subtle but had notes of hop and malt with a little bit of citrus in it. The taste wasn't bad with a nice mellow flavor although the aftertaste was a tad skunky. The mouthfeel was nice for the beer as well. Nothing to write home about but not bad."

"Drank straight from the bottle. Had a bright gold color. Very high head, overflowed the bottle when opened, but settled down into thin lacing rather quickly. Very faint, weak smell- somewhat grassy. The flavor was a sweet, grassy malt, but seemed surfacey- it could use a little more depth. It was very light and easy to drink. A good beer for a summer barbecue. Wasn't bad at all."

"Poured into a 14oz pint glass. Bright gold color, with an airy head. The nose gives off scents of faint grainy malt, nothing more. The taste pretty much continues that theme: sweet, grainy malt, no hint of hops except in the faintest of senses. Yeast is lightly fruity. Bland and inoffensive is the best you can say."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Ok brew. Not my first choice."
""
""
""
"Overall - Its an okay fall beer but perhaps too dry for a summer beer. Probably good to pair with most burgers and pub food. A beer I would buy a 6-pack of, but not a beer that I would buy a full case of."
""
""
""
"Overall, good for what it is but I think I'm still trying to get my bearings on this kolsch sort of thing."
""
"Would be decent if it was an American Adjunct Lager, as a Kolsch, it's pretty bad."

""
"This is a solid ""B" light beer."

"Drinks more like a lager than an ale. A good summertime beer or for when you want something light."

"overall i was disappointed with this kugels brew. its good, but Sam Adams escape route makes this taste like water. This is only my second kolsch brew. so i don't have much to compare it to."
""
""
""
""
"O: got a 6 of this today at a good price. Will definitely pick up more. Hoping to see it on draught. This compares quote well to the Alaskan Summer Kolsch, one of my favorite for thus style. I wish Leinie's had imparted a bit more rye flavor. It would have been interesting. It's nice, tho', that they didn't go overboard on the hops."
""
"Pours a clear amber in color with about a finger of a white head that settles back down to just a thin layer on top. Spotty lacing was seen with each sip. The aroma is of rye and some mixed hops, just like the bottle says. The taste is more complex actually. The taste of rye hits your tongue first then followed up with some grains & hops. Actually pretty smooth and goes down easy. No bitter aftertaste or or 'hoppy' bitter finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a great representation of the style.  Some nice floral and perfume from the hop combination. Subtle malty sweet balance.  Rye adds a nice snappy drying finish. Gold medal winner. Really nice beer. I definitely recommend this beer. Well done Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Co."
"FWIW: 12 0z. bottle poured into a sam adams glass , best by date: 05/12/14"

"It's not terrible, but it's a big misfire. Would rather buy Hale's serviceable Kölsch any day of the week over this one. In my experience, Alaskan Summer still is the daddy here."

"Overall a decent mass produced kolsch."

"O: A relatively spicy version of the style, yet without being more flavorful than average."
""
""
""

"The canoe paddler is a decent kolsch style beer...i like the addition of rye. The beer poured a clear golden with thin white head that left a spotty lace. The scent was minimal at best....faint citrus and malt. The tatse was well balanced....the rye helped the beer finish clean off the pallet and sslightly dry. The mouthfeel was lighter in body with good carbonation. Overall it is a good beer and perfect for the summer months."

"I bought this because I am usually a big fan of Kolsch style beers. This one didn't really taste like a Kolsch to me at all. It kind of reminded me of just a normal AAL. It was refreshing on a hot day, could only drink about one of them though. This beer just weighed to heavy on my stomach. Maybe it was the rye in it. Overall, if you want to pay a lot for an AAL, because that is what this beer tastes like, then buy this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a poor take on the kolsch style, screams macro lager with maybe a touch of biscuit or wheat."
""
""
""
""

"This beer is basically a light beer. It has nothing much to review. It doesn't really taste horrible, it just has no taste at all. There isn't a hint of maltiness, or hoppiness or even the grainy taste a good American lager has. It has no smell, mouthfeel is very thin, carbonation is barely detectable... I don't know what this beer is supposed to be, or why it was brewed."

"O: Not very flavorful, goes down ok, not too filling, mild kick, not the best representation of style, there are several beers in the style that are better than this one."
""
" The taste is decent as it is generall lightly malty with some malt flavor the only thing I can say is the rye in the grist seems to get overwhelmed in the taste bu the adjunct flavor which is kind of dissapointing. Overall I would probably pass unless this was offered to me, since it is not bad, but not really worth buying a second time."

"Cheers!"

"Date tasted: May 26, 2013... Glassware: Ayinger willibecker... Occasion: two rooms painted in one day--that's progress... Appearance: straw yellow, bubbly effervescent body with an uneven creamy head... Aroma: punchy metallic hops--creamy rye? not really digging it--it's got a Lord Chesterfield funk to it... Palate: smooth,, light and refreshing--appropriate to its genre and probably weds well with an afternoon on a lawn tractor... Taste: oof--a rather nondescript flavor of fizziness slaps the tongue and throat; this almost tastes like every Leinenkugel's I've had minus whatever additive was on the label (apparently canoe paddles have no flavor themselves)... Overall: a refreshing rinser--not a lot of words to work on this one, and not much wonder to ponder as I watch the glass drain. It's partly a style thing, partly the brew's lack..."
""
""
""
"Pours to a permanent thin white head and moderate lacing. Color is pale gold. Aroma is pale grains and white grapes. Flavor is much the same with a noble hop flavor and bitterness to balance the scant sweetness that is present in this dry beer. Mouthfeel is light. Overall, not a bad brew, and yes, it passses my Kolsch test (vinous notes detected)."
""
"O= This is a super drinkable beer that's for sure. It actually may be ""smoother"" than the regular linies red I think. Worth checking out on a summer day and possibly to repeat if you are looking for an easy drinker."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very drinkable. Especially on a hot day when you don't want anything too heavy."
""
""
""
"The taste is also a grain-filled enterprise with a subtle citrus note that is muted yet also noticeable. It ends clean and crisp. Kolsch's are simple styles and not dissimilar to a Pilsener and this really meets the grade as far as I am concerned. Refreshing and easy to drink."

"The body is light, like it should be, but it shouldn't be flat. This isn't completely flat, per se, as carbonation is moderate and there's some crispness, but it doesn't have the bite or vitality of the good stuff."
"Not really all that Kolsch like for my tastes. Just a version of an Am. lager really. A decent one of those and thirst quenching, but nothing more than that."
""
""
"O- I like it. A little more beer head, some lacing, and a bit more body and I could rate this a bit higher. For what it lacks, it has flavor and drinkability. Not bad."
""
""
""
""
"Clean drinking....light bodied but not real thin...works as a summer time thirst quencher type beer that craft beer lovers could drink. Just not sure this will have the crossover appeal to the macro drinkers that Leinie seems to target their beers toward. They're already closing out this beer with cheap specials at all the liqour stores in my town. My guess is we'll see something in its place next year but I kind of like it actually."
"overall...about what one would expect from Leinies. drinks nice, quenches thoroughly, and brings just enough character to keep it (slightly) interesting. wasn't bad after a day of yardwork on a beautiful May afternoon."
"Appearance is a bright clear copper with a velvety dense white head. Great retention and plenty of lacing. Nose has light grainy malts with waves of orange and wheat and a touch of corn. Taste is somewhat malty with notes of orange and corn. Almost like a cross between a wheat and a kolsch. The finish becomes overly grainy and corny, reminiscent of an adjunct lager. Mouthfeel is smooth and moderate bodied. Overall, another typical offering from Leinies, nothing special or particularly tasty, but also palatable."

"Lawnmower beer status, light pale golden bright egg shell white head forms fine speckled lacing between sips. Fizzy flowing carbonation streams of bubbles from the bottom of my glass. Aroma has a biscuit malt sweetness, lemon tartness, and light grassy hop character going on. Not detecting rye yet let's see if it shows up in the flavor at all, crisp smooth biscuit malts with some bread dough yeast characteristics, a light lemony grassy finish pretty nice mix of flavors even if it's done in a session beer from Leinenkugel's. Some might say it's too watery or lacks the depth of some if it's German Kolsch style ales, but for me it's working just right not bad at all. Mouthfeel is crisp refreshing light bodied base beer clean finish all day, if working in the yard just keep these coming."

"O: A nice lighter option from Leinie's. I like it. This would be a good beer for a hot day after cutting grass, especially if fruitier beers aren't for you. Like I said before, this beer can easily be pounded."
""
"Overall - Light and refreshing. Nothing off, but nothing distinctive."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Crisp, clean body. Refreshing, light, easy. Mild lemon soaked husky grains make up the bulk of the flavor. Really not much here that would make me think this is anything but an adjunct lager. Just a short snap of bitterness on the finish. This was easy to drink and quite refreshing as I worked out in the yard today. I'd have it again, but there are far better examples of the style out there."
""
"This is a bit of a disappointing beer. The right flavors are there, but it's incredibly light. I would definitely take this over a standard American Adjunct Lager or Light Lager any day. There isn't anything offensive about this beer, and it's very easy to pack away. On a hot day I would definitely work through a six-pack of these if there wasn't anything else on hand."
""
""
"Source: Purchased at Wal-Mart in Texas as a selection of a Brewmaster's Choice build-your-own six-pack for $8.99."
"O -- Overall, I have to wonder what this would taste like side-by-side with Leinie's Original. It has a little more character than most American Adjunct Lagers, but not as much as some of the better Kölsch style beers you can find. I'll probably grab some more of this for patio grilling in mid-summer to see if it's more appealing, but right now it's pretty regular."
""
"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and while it wasn't that true to style with the addition of rye, it was still very Kolsch like and the rye did a good job at complementing the other flavors. This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, refreshing, not filling, and the flavors did a decent job at holding my attention, I can see myself drinking a few of these while outside this summer, it's a nice summer session beer. What I liked the most about this beer was the mouthfeel and the added complexity from the rye, they were both good and the highlights of this beer. What I liked the least about this beer was the appearance, a little more head retention and lacing would have been nice. I would buy this beer again when I'm in the mood for a sessionalbe summer beer, the price is right and it's appropriate for the season, I recommend this beer to just about anyone, it a nice and easy drinking beer. All in all I was happy with this beer, Leinenkugel can make some solid beers and this one of them, good job guys, I'm sure I'll be revisiting this beer again this summer."
"O - This isn't bad at all, but it's entirely not a Kölsch style beer. Where do you come down on the score, then: drinkability, or accuracy? Somewhere in the middle? Regardless, this can be a tasty and refreshing Summer beer, no question."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This beer does not leave a memorable impression. The flavors are not as intense as many other beers in the Kolsch family are. It goes down easily which works well for certain situations. I would love to see this beer available in the summer. It is an easy-drinking Kolsch, not the best but it is refreshing."
""
""
"O: Well it's another easy drinker from Leinenkugels but it really leaves a lot to be desired. Not nearly enough hop bitterness for me. Just really plain, like I've tasted it before in many American adjunct lagers. Not a bad beer just doesn't really fill out the label. Average at best."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is very easy to drink; the crispness and dryness also make it particularly refreshing. It is a good representation of the style."
""
""
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a pale yellow color with a 1 inch head. Smell is of grains, some corn. Taste is light, mild, some corn, refreshing yet not very flavorful. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a mediocre beer, not bad, but just lacking."
"Speaking of which, I was amazed at how many Kolsches I have reviewed on this site. Believe me, it was not by design as I am a self-proclaimed hophead and Kolsch can leave me unfulfilled."
""
""
""
"Overall: Simply a very easy drinker, much like a light adjunct lager. Only the faintest of lemony notes made this anything different. Won't be buying this again."
""
"O - Overall, Extremely bland and lacking in all departments. I'e rather have a Bud Light. At least that has some flavor."
"O - Not a bad beer. One could easily sit down and have multiples of it. Nothing outstanding about it but still a good solid beer."
""
""
"Pours a dull and lifeless dirty golden color. Mostly clear, and with a thin foam halo around the glass. Aroma is sweet, grainy and tea like. The taste is quite sweet, just about cloying, with corn syrup and biscuity malt the major culprits. Little to no bitterness, and finishes pretty weak and watery. Where is the body? Flimsy medium bodied, ok carbonated, but bland and lifeless beer. Overall, another sub par offering from the mega conglomerate."
"Mouthfeel: This is a smooth and easy drinking beer that flows nicely across the palate. The light body of the beer makes it a great beer for spring and summer."
""
""
""
"O - This is an okay kolsch-style ale. It didn't really get the rye, though."
""
""
""

"Leinenkugel's Canoe Paddler ---2.5/5"
"O- I will admit I'm not super familiar with this style. Its smooth, clean, light and refreshing. Usually that means flavorless, but not this beer, good grain flavor, good hop profile for this light beer style, will drink plenty of this in the summer. Not sure if the off aftertaste is something I'm just not used to or if its a bad trait. Its definitely not a deal breaker."
"More malt character than expected. I'm guessing the tangy flavor comes from the yeast. That off aroma, though is pretty nasty."
""
"O: Overally i was fairly impressed by the offering, clean well to do by style, well attenuated and crisp. Lightly tart and fruity and very easy to drink. A delicate and hard style to appreciate outside of germany and not one done usually by american breweries. Have to add the rye contribution was very slight to the point of almost non-commiting and could easily be overlooked as well as easily left out for style sake. Refreshing and crisp for that easy drinking session. A bit fruity per style and the rye seems out of place but besides being outside the guidelines a bit still drinks fairly easily and the light craft, lager drinker will find enjoyable."
"Seriously, what's up with the fruity character here? I kinda get that fruit is Leinie's thing now, but it's just regrettably out of place here. I like the Shandys, I like the other seasonals, hell, I even like the Sunset Wheat. But this is just pretty thoroughly mediocre. I'd like to see the 1888 Bock again instead of this."
""
"I can tell that this is in the Kolsch vein, can't tell the rye's there. Poured cold with a small, white, fizzy head that quickly settled to a few small islands and a ring with no lace. Aroma is fresh beer, malt. Color is a crystal clear yellow with plenty of bubble trails. Flavor's like nose. grainy malt cult with carbonic tang and a little bittersweet. Body is ok; carbonation a touch sharp. Finish is like flavor, easy drinking without much character. Average length."
"O) This is just okay, but honestly if I didn't live in Wisconsin I probably wouldn't be drinking it. I guess sometimes when you have to run out to Walmart for some random household items, you end up with Canoe Paddler in your cart."
""
""
""
""
"It doesn't really fit in with ""Kolsch"" style. It does have a certain dryness to it though - from the pepper. I didn't really catch the rye that was added. It's not bad - but...well - they tried something different that was light. It's okay."
""
""
""
""
"O - It's alright. Drinkable, more so than the adjuncts that it looks like, but Leinie's could, and have, done better."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Would not buy again."
"Light grain yellow with white surface sheet. Smells like a kolsch, corn, grain, clean, touch of earthy hops. Clean, some corn, some rice, some grain, a touch of sweetness early on is countered with a decent bitterness and a cheap finish. Thin with hi carb and a dry finish. This is okay. I'd drink again."
""
"The first bottle I opened had what I call a ""snot pellicle"". The first swallow was slimy and reminiscent of snot. Second bottle was the same way, but not as bad. This comes from improperly brewing with Rye (beta glucan rest??). This is odd since I couldn't taste any rye. Quite frankly this beer tastes like liquid cardboard with hops and a dash of kolsch and a hint of slime. I'm extremely dissappointed in this beer. I'm a big fan of Leine and a huge fan of the kolsch style."
"O - It seems a little early in the season for a beer such as this, but if it sticks around long enough, Canoe Paddler would make an excellent warm weather beer with it's delicate but well-balanced hop flavors and crisp, clean finish. Canoe Paddler will undoubtedly find a permanent place in my summer cooler."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I am not really impressed with this beer in the least. It might be decent as a thirst quencher on a hot day but I could think of many other beers I would rather have. Not one to seek out."
""
""
"Overall: A weak offering, a rather poor Kölsch. Didn't finish this one."
"Taste is ok, really though...I would probably guess AAL if I had it blind. The rye is not prevalent enough nor is the kolsch yeast. That said, I would reach for this over a budweiser any day. The body actually holds pretty well and it is not as thin as first perceived. Meh...I won’t have any trouble finishing the sixer that I bought, but SA Lawnmower beats this hands down as a readily available kolsch."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Paddlin' the school canoe? Oh, you'd better believe that's a paddlin'... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear pale brass topped by a finger of relatively short-lived off-white foam. The nose comprises banana, light wheat, toast, very light lemon zest, and funky water. The taste brings in more of the same, with a stronger lemon and wheat component. The body is a hefty light, with a moderate carbonation and a dry, crisp finish. Overall, an okay kolsch, but one that doesn't seem to utilize the rye very well, and one that misses the style's mark just a bit regardless."
""
"It will be interesting to see how the general public takes to this new addition. Well at least they didn't add lemon to this one!"
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a tall glass. Pours a very translucent straw with a large white head. Smells of watery rye and other grain. Tastes of sweet grain and the dominant rye. Beer is carbonated correctly however seems a tad watery. Overall a slightly above average beer."
"Overall, just an average beer. Nothing I would seek out or buy regularly, but if I wanted a cheap Kolsch, this might be it."
""
"Overall Impression: A clean, crisp, delicately balanced beer usually with very subtle fruit flavors and aromas. Subdued maltiness throughout leads to a pleasantly refreshing tang in the finish. To the untrained taster easily mistaken for a light lager, a somewhat subtle Pilsner, or perhaps a blonde ale."
""
""
""
"Taste-Weak pale malt, faint rye note comes and goes in a flash, leaving a clean, rather drying finish, but little else. A Macro-lager flavor takes over after a few minutes and stops everything dead in its tracks. Salvation comes only well-chilled on a hot summer day. (or so I would imagine) Not for the flavor-seeker."
""
""
"I am usually a huge fan of the Leinenkugel brews but I am really disappointed in this one. I was expecting a tasty rye brew but unfortunately with this beer there is no depth to the flavor. It has a very generic taste like some of the bigger brew name ""Lite"" beer options. If you are after a lite tasting beer, it might be for you, but unfortunately this is one Leinenkugel I would not purchase again."
