Pours slightly hazy/cloudy golden color with a 2 finger dense and rocky white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon, pear, apple, wheat, cracker, bread, herbal, straw, grass, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance of pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon, pear, apple, wheat, cracker, bread, herbal, straw, grass, and yeast earthiness. Light earthy herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, pear, apple, wheat, cracker, bread, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice robustness and balance of pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. A fairly clean finish as well with no overly estery yeast notes present. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, fairly crisp, and lightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with no warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice kolsch style. All around good balance and robustness of pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 08, 2015"

Avoid this if you are looking for a pale ale.  It is most similar to Kona Longboard or Olympia. Too much malty sweetness for my taste, without much complexity to balance it out.  The lingering aftertaste is better than some of the other beers mentioned, with some  hints of citrus fruit.  This is my second go around with Yellowtail, figuring the last batch I had was a dud, but I am just as underwhelmed.","3PuttPar","Oct 28, 2014"

The beer has a golden orange hue, minimal foam, lace and carbonation and a crisp, clean taste.  Leaves the right amount of taste on the tongue and is not harsh like some other IPAs tend to be.  A very worthy effort.  Ballast Point is quickly becoming one of the best breweries on the west coast, but this is not their finest beer, even though I would rate as above average.  I love this brewery and cannot wait to try their new beers!","ronniebruner","Oct 06, 2014"

It states that its fermented at ale levels but its more of a Kolsch. I read that others felt misled, but its on the label. As for most breweries who do fantastic hoppy beers this one falls short. More malt than anything else detected. Its crisp, but it also has the funk or whatever you call it that is typical of Kolsch beers. For the price I can get just as good Kolsch beers that are actually true Kolsch, so for me its a one and done, but I still love Ballast Point's hoppy IPA's. Sculpin is just about perfect and among my all time favorite beers.","humuloner22","Jul 16, 2014"

It's an above average beer for sure, just not anything that blew my socks off. This would be excellent with seafood like mild whitefish, shrimp, or crab. I'd say try this if you are new to the craft beer scene or if you just want something that is light and extremely flavorful. You won't be disappointed.","ThomasMetal75","Mar 03, 2014"

It does explain things, though... It pours a clear brass topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises sweet biscuit, flowers, and a hint of candied orange peel in the background. The taste brings in more of the same, but with more of the orange peel and some mild grass for good measure. Overall, a decent little kolsch, and a sad excuse for a pale ale, depending on how you wanna look at it.","TMoney2591","May 17, 2013"

On my notes regarding the taste, I wrote: ""British style?"" - because it didn't seem to have enough hops for an APA. Then in my notes for the ""overall"" category, I wrote, ""Not what I'm looking for in an APA."" I've modified my scores knowing, in hindsight, that this is a Kolsch and not an APA (originally I gave it closer to a 3.25). But at the time I drank this, I thought it wasn't a good APA at all, and my initial scores reflected that. I may have felt better about this beer had I known when drinking it that it wasn't an APA and was instead a Kolsch.","Kendo","Jan 11, 2013"

Poured a clear yellow color with a good white head. Very mild on the nose, a little biscuit and a kiss of hops. On the palate, this one is light bodied and easy to drink, yet not very interesting in the least. Flavors of light malt and a bit of hops.","emmasdad","May 27, 2011"
3.43,-2.6,3.5,3,3.5,3,4,"D/O: Possibly one of the most poorly-marketed beers currently bottled, this ""pale ale"" offers an experience that is nothing like all other similarly-labeled beers. If Ballast Point needed a synonym for kolsch, it seems like blond ale would have been a more apt selection. Compared to other kolsches, this beer is full-flavored but a little unrefined, coming across as heavy-handed. Early fruitiness has a definite inauthentic resonance to it, leaving behind a sense of artificial flavor. Hoppy bitterness in the finish is bold for the style, although one would never mistake this for IPA-level bitterness in quantity or quality. However, it is effortless to drink, serving as a superior form of refreshment and really holding up well when served too cold.","beagle75","May 25, 2011"

Aroma has sweet biscuit malts slight honey sweetness with some herbal hops lingering a nice cereal grain presence with a mild metallic mineral water accent and hints of grassy/citric hops in the backend. Flavor is grainy light toasted malts bringing biscuit to minds with a touch of citrus/fruit esters very mild hops in the finish. Not even great German style brewing going on just pretty much a dissapointment as a whole. Mouthfeel light bodied easy going, easy drinking, care free crossover style golden ale.

As yellow as pale orange in color, while lacking depth it holds enough light inside to create a moderate visual presence, close to zero bubbles to be seen. Biscuity, bready nose with orange peel and mineral water nuances, a touch of blanched almonds, has a sort of oily grassiness like the scents of mowing the lawn, there is a waft of toffee at times, the fruit has a pit and skin aspect to it, mostly peach, apricot and pear, lasts mostly due to aggressiveness than depth of scents. Medium-bodied, does a good job of covering the mouth cheek-to-cheek, especially when you factor in the puffed up carbonation. But it's mostly dull and lifeless on the palate with meager portions of peach, apricot, red apple, red cherry fruit and orange peel. The cocoa and caramel lack sweetness, same could be said for the grain bread and corn flavors. Even the hoppiness lacks real bite, you kinda keep waiting for something to go off but the fuse fizzles out. The kind of beer you'd expect to drink at the ballpark.","farrago","Jul 24, 2010"

The nose seems a bit understated and one dimensional,grainy,with the slightest amount of floral hops. Not realizing that this was a Kolsch style PA I thought it was a bit underpowered in the hop department. Upon reading the label and realizing the style being attempted I find this to be quite nice and balanced. A touch of grainy lightly toasted malt is backed up by an equal balance of earthy,grassy hops. Subtle lemon and spice. A slightly slick mouthfeel followed by dry,prickly cabonation and a slightly bitter finish. Yellowtail Pale Ale was not what I expected,it is balanced and very drinkable.","orangemoustache","Dec 02, 2008"

Fruity aroma, oranges, grassy, citrus rind, cakey, but fairly mild overall. Moderate bitterness with a fruity sweetness, basically the same character as found in the aroma.

The kolsch description is more of a stretch for me. The beer was a very refreshing, decently carbonated, slightly floral beer that went down smoothly. It was unexceptional, but I did like things more in the finish as the beer settled, and then some residual dryness and nuttiness emerged.

Mouthfeel is just right for the style -- or at least the American version of the style, as it's a bit thicker and bigger than the original kolsches. Overall, though, this is quite nice.

Very sweet and malty with a very grainy/toasted malt flavor. A slight grassy hoppiness is noted. Mouthfeel is smooth and crisp, and the carbonation helps it go down. Overall a less-than average beer, but maybe its because they call it a pale ale. It might be a pale-colored ale, but in San Diego, this beer would not pass as the standard pale ale style.

3.77,7.1,5,3,3.5,4.5,4.5,"Had on tap at Pizza Port Carlsbad. Crystal clear clear clear yellow pale straw. Fair size head that left bunch of white lace. Very light hop nose and malt as well. First sip light corn flavor and grain. Very crisp finish and very full mouthfeel for this type of light brew. No aftertaste which was nice for this type. Good drinkable beer on and on","chargerfanjess","Mar 29, 2006"
4.33,23,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"NOTE: I just read up a little on Yellowtale brewing from their web site and found that they use 5% wheat in this beer...THAT is the crispness I was tasting...there is definately a bread thing going on in the taste and aftertaste. Wonderful!","IntriqKen","Mar 25, 2006"
3.4,-3.4,3,3,3.5,3,4,"Pale yellow with about a half finger of white head. Grassy, earthy hop aroma with a light biscuity background. Well balanced hop/malt flavor. The grassiness plays well with the caramel malt. The medium mouthfeel and slightly dry finish makes this really refreshing and enjoyable.","nvsblman","Feb 19, 2006"
3.95,12.2,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"A tasty Kolsch from Ballast Point. Dark yellow gold with a foamy white head, with hints of yeast in the aroma. Smooth and medium bodied with a great light hop bitterness that adds a little spiciness to this easy drinkin' brew. 12 oz bottle from a sixpack purchased at the Mission Valley(San Diego) BevMo.","germaniac","Dec 30, 2005"
2.49,-29.3,1.5,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,"Notes: I like some hops to balance out a good kolsch. This stays on the bready side all the way through and it leans towards doughy. Good malt character. Delicate finish. Not one of my favorites but its an approachable offering with some depth.","DogFood11","Dec 26, 2005"

3.5,-0.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Yellowtail Pale Ale is a decent Kolsch that doesn't put any kind of a serious scare into the world's best versions. After enjoying Big Eye IPA, it was my hope that this one would be just as good. No such luck. While I don't have any desire to throw it back, I won't be mounting it above my mantle either.","BuckeyeNation","Jul 09, 2005"
3.85,9.4,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Overall impression: A nicely drinkable beer. I always like it when beers that were previously bombers only show up in six packs! This would be a great choice for any spring/summer activity.","rowew","May 04, 2005"

3.08,-12.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,"Deep gold with a vigorous 1 inch pale yellow head. Sweet grain maltiness with a very mild hop citrus notes. Dry malt up front and a mild, soft hop finish. Typical pale ale, IMO. Nothing too exciting, but still a great offering from a good San Diego brewery. Give it a try when you find it.","winomark","Jun 22, 2004"
4.45,26.4,4,4,4.5,4.5,5,"Had a yard of this at O'Hungry's in Old Town yesterday and was very impressed. It poured a nice medium yellow color with a small white head that left some lace down the glass. The smell was very refreshing with a crisp hop scent. The flavor was equally as smoothe and crisp with a slight hop kick that was more balanced towards the slighty spicy malt profile. This is a great session beer and just goes to show that you can make a very light and drinkable beer and still have a great flavor.","Dmann","May 19, 2004"
3.97,12.8,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Tasted at the Orange Blossom Festival in Riverside, California. Served very cold on a cold, rainy day. Pours a golden yellow with minimal head. Aroma & flavor follow each other fairly well- there is a nice hops balanced with a light citrusy and buttery tones. A complete lack of sweetness. Drinkability is, well, let's put it this way- my notes say: ""yes!!!"".","Dukeofearl","Apr 18, 2004"

3.43,-2.6,3.5,3,3.5,3,4,"The beer after splitting from the 22 ounce bottle pours a translucent and lustrous gold with the head large and bright white with a pleasing creamy texture, lace a fine silky curtain to cover the glass. Nose is dominated by the sweet malt, crisp and fresh, with the start nicely malted, lightly sweet and the top fair in its feel to the palate. Finish is equable in its acidity, the hops are pleasing but a bit mild, the aftertaste quite dry and a fine session beer it will make.","Gusler","Mar 22, 2004"

4,13.6,4,4,4,4,4,"This is a light golden colour with a fluffy head of all-white foam. The aromas are slightly fruity, with nice roasted malts, and slight citrus-y/floral hops in the aroma. The taste is super light and refreshing. You can really tell that this is a low alcohol brew that is crafted with the utmost care and passion. Truly 'artisinal'. The mouthfeel is pretty good, bordering on great and the drinkability is nice for this new age Kolsch as well. A good, solid, brew!","francisweizen","Dec 22, 2003"

3.88,10.2,4,3.5,4,4,4,"A clean and crisp brew that really hits the spot. The golden-hued body has a nice head and laces well. The nose is malty and bready with a good sense of grain. There is nice flavor from the malting and the feel is quite light and crisp, giving a very nice snappy finish. Easily drinkable in some volume.","AtLagerHeads","Nov 02, 2003"

3.98,13.1,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Overall: Labeled as a Pale Ale in the style of a Cologne Kölsch. It is certainly a decent effort, the malt aspect is crisp and light hops are refreshing. Not a bad effort at all.","TheLongBeachBum","Jul 18, 2003"
3.12,-11.4,3,3.5,3,3,3,"Medium yellow color. Medium head. Aroma is malty and sweet. A medium bodied ale. Malts are mild, fruity and kind of sweet. Hops are present, but kind of hidden. They pop out at you every once in a while. Very smooth. More of a Kolsch than a pale ale. It's a great hot day/lawnmover beer. Mild and interesting. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.","beerguy101","Jun 24, 2003"
3.78,7.4,3.5,3,4,4.5,4,"Advertised as a kolsch-style, one should expect this to be less a ""west coast"" pale than Ballast Point's other offering. The beer is a clear, very light copper in color, with a very thin head. Aroma is mild, wheaty and suffused with German hops. The flavor is surprisingly rich for such a crisp-feeling body, with a raw grainy malt and an earthy/herbal hop very dry finish. A refreshing yet substantial beer, and a nice entry in a style which, admittedly, I tend to find a bit uninspiring.","mzwolinski","Apr 26, 2003"
4,13.6,4,4,4,4,4,"This different pale ale has a sweet fruity aroma.  There is a hint of ester in the flavor as well as a good sweet smooth malt presence.  This brew is more reminiscent of a tasty golden ale.  The only really noticeable hop presence is a bit of a bitterness in the finish.","beernut7","Aug 26, 2002"
3.88,10.2,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Notes: Decent go at the Kölsch style, quite palatable with an impressive malt character for such a light coloured brew. Nice addition of hops to make for a perfect balance.","Jason","Apr 10, 2002"
4.7,33.5,4,4,5,5,5,"I enjoy a good pale ale and this is a pretty good one.  Had it shipped for the holidays and I was the hit of the party.  Very drinkable, very balanced.  Everything you can hope for in an ale.","geckointhebox","Dec 25, 2001"
