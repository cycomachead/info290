3.11,-9.3,4,3,3,3.5,3,"Very average beer. Golden colored with nice clarity, medium white head that retains well and leaves nice lace. The smell is of pale malts with a hint of fruity hops. The taste is bright, with fruity hints of citrus on top of pale malt. Quite watery, but crisp and refreshing. Easy to drink, just nothing to write home about.","JayS2629","Beers"
3.5,2,3,3,3.5,4,4,"Had this as one of the samplers, standard clear-golden color with small amounts of fizz rising from the bottom of the glass. The smell is underwhelming, bits of pale malt is about all I get from this one. The taste is similar with a touch of fruitiness that helps the beer's character. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a nice, creamy carbonation. Overall a ddrinkable beer, not bad at all but not memorable either.","gmfessen","0"
3.38,-1.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"On-tap as a part of the sampler. Not a bad beer here for the style, though I'm not a huge fan of the style, I guess. A nice yellow color with some bone-white head that leaves a bit of lacing. Smell is largely of pale malts, making me think macro, though I know it's of much better quality. Taste kind of follows suit--light malts with a bit of lemon and citrus splash. MF is light-bodied, well-carbonated. Refreshing. Good lawnmower beer, though not something I'd go to the pub for.","LordAdmNelson","Dec 16, 2008"

2.93,-14.6,3,2.5,3,2.5,3.5,"Overall, this isn't the best example of a Kolsch I've ever had. The finish and the metallic twang is somewhat bothersome. I just wish it was a bit more rounded and hoppy.","xav33","Oct 16, 2006"
3.77,9.9,3,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Pours a hazy pale golden amber color with a small white head that quickly vanishes into a trace amount of lace. Nose has some lightly sweet fruitiness with a bit of apple as well as a clean maltiness. Taste is sweet malt, mild caramel, and a hint of fresh pear up front following by a fruity hoppiness. Would make for a very nice summertime beer. Thanks to coldchill for the sample!","Morris729","Oct 15, 2006"
3.87,12.8,3.5,4,4,4,3.5,"Sounded pretty good upon ordering. Not sure I was expecting a Kolsch. No matter, I did like the beer, though it's pretty bold for the style. A little more malty than expected with a pronounced caramel, apple, pear flavor that expanded the brew quite a bit. The hops were also bold with a light spicy, citrus character. Not enough to change the beer to a new style, but certainly daring for a Kolsch. Reminds me a lot of Summit's Extra Pale.","BEERchitect","Sep 27, 2006"
4.3,25.4,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"I'm not sure whether I was just in need of a lighter beer at the time I sampled this one at a local beer fest or what, but man was it good. A: Light gold with a nice thick head and moderate laicng. S: Graininess predominately with a fair amount of corn aroma T: Light crisp and refreshing with grain and malts trumping any hop flavors. M: Thin but appropriate D: Extremely drinkable and a good choice for any session that would occur in warmer weather.","veech","Jul 13, 2005"

3.18,-7.3,3.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,"Bright gold in colour with medium carbonation. Theres bit of citrus fruit and light wheat maltiness on the nose. The flavors are somewhat cream ale like, with some slightly sweet honey malt notes. The body is relatively light, and it makes for a very drinkable brew. A decent enough summer sipper.","fisherman34","Jun 14, 2005"
4.1,19.5,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Overall, very drinkable, and quite enjoyable. Very glad to have tried this one. It's hard to make a good Kolsh, and Blackstone seems to have succeeded.","LuckySevens82","Jan 19, 2005"
3.72,8.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours with a light gold color and a nice white head that dissipates rather quickly. Intensely fresh aroma with a good burst of hop flavor up front, malt dominates the middle and finish. A modest but refreshing beer. Probably very good with food but rather boring by itself. A good transition beer to win converts to more flavorful beers.","John1985","Oct 20, 2004"
4.05,18.1,4,4,4,3.5,4.5,"OG = 1.047, IBU = 18. Kolsch style. Pours a light golden color with a small head that doesn't stick around long and doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. Very clear. The aroma is mild, but there is a trace of malt in there, possibly some noble hops. Flavor was slightly malty with hints of the hops. Crisp and clean. Light body, easy to drink.","clvand0","Dec 08, 2003"
4.27,24.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"On-tap at the 2004 Brewer's Jam in Knoxville TN, which this brewery has attended since the first event I think. The color is golden, with some slight head, probably hindered by the serving conditions. The aroma features euro-maltiness and a hint of saaz hops, spicy and minty. The beer features a crisp finish, nicely bittered, with great malt flavors that are subtle but very complimentary for the hop notes. The hop flavor is nice and strong without being overbearing. I haven't had a "real Kolsch" from Cologne but this has got to be pretty darn close. Great!","KroMagnon","May 27, 2003"

2.27,-33.8,2,2.5,2,2.5,2.5,"From a sampler: Pours a clear gold color with a thin white head. Barely-there hops aroma. Mild and smooth, like most beers of the style. Not particularly impressive, as the hops flavor is elusive. Finish is a little watery. Maybe good on a hot day but otherwise not really worth it.","Dogbrick","Beers"
3,-12.5,3,3,3,3,3,"A pretty good take on the Kolsch style.  Very light and laid-back, with moderate hops bittering and not a lot of malt presence.  Easy drinking, but not particularly memorable.","Brent","0"
