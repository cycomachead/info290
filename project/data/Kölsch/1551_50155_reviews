"A nice crisp beer.  Still think could be reduced in hop flavor a bit to let fruity esters have a bit more voice."

"Overall, a good session beer."

"Overall – A fairly nice kolsch. Nothing super extraordinary, but very enjoyable none the less."
"Carbonatiion: Balanced to bring out the taste and aroma"

"For the price, this is a great American-made kölsch. It's great that a brewery as big as G-B is able to deliver solid offerings that are well-intended takes on many of the different regional styles of beer throughout Germany. I could definitely have this again, although I'd want it fresher next time. Good stuff through and through - always a welcome treat after plummeting through lots of strong beers or a after a bad day at work."

"O- Fine example of the style. Americanized, but good."
""
"Pours a nice clean/clear pale yellow color, nice carbonation, with a fizzy white head, not much sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some hop notes, slight citrus note. The taste is malty, with some grapefruit notes, slightly hoppy/bitter. Medium body. Overall, a good thirst quencher, but I would not buy again."

"On tap from the Myrtle Beach location. Poured a clear, light gold/honey color with a small but lingering white head. Citrus notes like lemon and grapefruit. A slight bread note. Tasted of bread, citrus fruit, and a little herb/pine on the finish. Light bodied. Didn't finish as dry as I thought it would for the style. Very drinkable and probably one of the better ones I had on my visit."

"This ""kölsch""strikes me as typical of a lot of American produced examples of the style: a bit too thick and bodied. Consistent, sure. But too much on the profile. This seems a very difficult style for American producers to get close to doing well on."
""
"O: Having just had an amazing kolsch a few days ago, I can say this is a less than amazing example of the style. Flavors were off putting. I won’t be drinking this again."

"Solid all around, definitely comparable to the few Kölschs we get in the US. I'd prefer to drink this from a bigger mug ... Eine Maß!!"

"Not a bad Kolsch, it perhaps is a little more fruity than I had expected, but not so much that it keeps this from being out of style for me. Certainly at the very least a beer I am happy to be sipping upon as I while away a few hours in the airport."
"I could drink this all day long."
"D: very drinkable beer that would be a great session brew to take to a party for everyone to sip on."
"Pours a hazy light yellow with a 1/2 inch off-white head that fades to a film on the top of the beer. Decent thin rings of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grains and mustard seeds. This is very weird. Taste is of toasty grains, citrus zest hops, and a bitter metallic flavor. There is a medicinal bitterness that lingers after each sip. This beer has a pretty good level of carbonation with a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty average beer with a weird mustard/metal thing going on. I am not a fan of this beer."
"O: not a fan of this kolsch. I don't find a whole lot going on that I enjoy."
"Pours a very appetizing color of golden/honey with white head. Lots of light here. Nose is soft with some bready notes, and floral/herbal complexity. On the palate there's a big kolsch character that is delightful with plenty of herbal hop qualities, minerals, and light malt. Finish is overall deliciously herbal through the aftertaste. Medium bodied. Incredibly drinkable, yet also flavorful. Too bad most folks don't appreciate Kolsch."
"Poured from a tap into a pilsner? glass. Color was dark gold. Had an inch and a half of foam that remained there for awhile. Smell was a slight hint of honey but not a strong odor elsewhere. Very carbonated. Lots of flavors, but honey stood out. Golden honey would be a better way to describe it. Good summmer beer and was refreshing."
"O-Great for hot weather. A good candidate for a lawnmower beer."
"With its brilliant golden color and superb lacing, this is a beautiful beer to look at. This beer has a fresh grain aroma with a hint of yeast, and is slightly floral from the hops. Its crispness is spot-on and holds the light- to-medium body together. Malty, bready, grassy and faint biscuity flavors paint a broad stroke on the palate. Moderate hopping gives a balanced bitterness and a long trail of herbal flavor. This beer is a little nutty in the dry finish. Super drinkable and loaded with flavor, this brew is an amazing example of its style."
"Very nice beer on a blazing hot day in MB and easily their best offering."
"Pours a golden body with minimal but frothy head with great lace on a light fruity body with pils malt smell. Light-bodied, dry pils malt taste yet a slightly sweet fruit taste that has some sugariness to it and is balanced with a sour apple/pear fruit taste. Not a bad summer beer."
"The ale was served in a variation of the traditional Stange. This brew had a clear effervescent body with a whipped egg white head. The aroma was of malt and floral aroma hops. The sweetness of the malt is well balanced with the hop bitterness. This beer is a great example of the Kolsch style. Very similar to Reissdorf Kolsch. I highly recommend this as an alternative to the BMC brews for your NON-BA friends."
"Overall, this is a clean, crisp, and refreshing beer. Pleasant certainly, and perfect for summer. Not a style I normally gravitate to, but worth checking out for something different."
"D - This is an okay kolsch. A little more bland than most."
"D: This is a pretty good beer with a nicely balanced malt/hop ratio that is easy to drink and quite sessionable. I don't think I would seek it out, but I wouldn't turn one down. More good stuff from Gordon-Biersch!"
"This is an unobtrusive, highly drinkable and refreshing beer. Like most of the beers from Grodon Biersch I have tried I feel it would accompany food extremely well just as all the others have."
"I prefer wits and hefeweizens as summer beers, but I would have this again."
"Drinkability: Boy, I just had a good Kölsch. As in the new brew from Stoudts I had a few hours ago. This one, well, it's okay. As in terms of ""how was the beer"" it was acceptable, sufficient even. Can't we just leave it at that?"
"Light to medium body with light carbonation and a crisp mouthfeel. Not too bad, drinkability is fairly high, seems like a decent summer beer."
"This just started popping up around here recently, by recently I mean within the last 6 months. Pours to a clear yellow. It is rather crisp and refreshing and has a consistency like some kind of soda. It is slightly bitter with a citrus note. It is a good brew for summer. It's got that fresh kind of feeling to it."
"Well obviously it a little dated, but this beer is pretty darn good on a damp, chilly early autumn day as well.Poured a clear straw color with a very tight formed one finger bone white head that has great lasting power.Aromas are toasty with light floral notes,crisp and clean on the palate with toasted cereal grain and a decent smack of leafy hoppiness in the finish.To me this is a great kolsch it stays delicate but has flavor,this was bottled back in April and it held up well,nice job GB on this one."
"Drinkability: a light summer beer that works time of year, but one may get a bit bored with this after a few glasses."
"I look forward to more Gordon Biersch beers."
"Speaking of Gordon Biersch, I recommend their restaurant/brewhouses. I've got great memories of sitting in GB restaurants over the years in San Jose, Scottsdale and Honolulu, getting toasted on some great brews!"
"Pours to a thin white head and golden clear color. Good lacing. Aroma is sweet malt and noble hops typical for the style. Flavor is a stark juxtaposition of malt sweetness and graniness and hop bitterness. Finishes dry and crisp. Easy to drink for a summer brew."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a clear golden yellow color with a thin fizzy head. The aroma is grain, hay and a touch of spicy hops. The taste follows the aroma with a clean dry finish and a nice kiss of hops. The mouthfeel is light bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation. Overall, not a bad beer and definitely a good beer to enjoy during the warm summer months!"
"A very nice summer beer that is very drinkable in the hot Virginia weather. A beautiful clear golden color with a decent head greets you when it's brought to your table. A modest smell of malt and a crisp refreshing taste almost reminiscent of a helles beer, but with mild hoppiness. This is a really nice session beer that helps to while away those long sultry weekend days with good company."
"This had a foamy, bone-white marshmallow-like head upon arrival with good retention. The color was a pale yellow with NE-quality clarity. The nose had a sort of a lemony/citrus scent underlain with a yeasty mustiness. The mouthfeel was medium with a powerful lemon/citrus tang on the tongue. Finish was fantastically dry and intensely refreshing. Hefe for the summer? Hell, no! I'm having more of this! There was good lacing throughout."
"Some lacing on a light yellow pour. Very easy to drink and light bodied and flavored. Low carbonated and almost seemed a bit flat, at the Gordon Biersch Brewery. Nothing special really, and perhaps one of my least favorite Kolsches I've had. I liked Saint Arnold Lawnmower better, and also also Pyramid's Curveball kolsches better than this, I think."
"This kolsch pours a typical clear yellowish gold. Aroma is hoppy and not strong. Flavor is fairly hoppy, pleasing although not complex - a typical summertime brew, light and refreshing, with just a touch of fruity sweetness. Finish has more sweet in it than the initial taste."
