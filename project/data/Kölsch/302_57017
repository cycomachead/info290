Simple, yet flavorful and refreshing enough. Personally, I like a Kolsch to be softer and more grainy malt forward. My preferences aside, this fruity number is alright.

There was a decent amount of lacing. It had a bready smell. It was not big on carbonation but carbonation was evident in the mouth feel. It was thicker then water but not much. It made my mouth pucker somewhat and had a lasting bitter aftertaste though not overwhelmingly so.","BeerBuggy","Sep 16, 2011"

3.05,-12.1,3,3,3,3.5,3,"Working through a Dundee sampler pack thanks to my brother. Nice guy. This offering pours a clear sorta-pale straw topped by a short-lived half-finger of dirty white foam. The nose comprises tangelo zest, musty biscuits, very light toffee, and old nutmeg. The taste runs very similarly, with some lemon zest joining the fun, along with some light black pepper and a few drips of honey. The spiciness twangs the tongue nigh into numbness. Luckily, things don't last too long, as every flavor flies off rather quickly. The body is fairly light, with a moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, I didn't enjoy this kolsch too much. I wish i could say more, but I really can't. Sorry...","TMoney2591","Aug 09, 2011"

4,15.3,4,4,4,4,4,"I also get that slight fruity grape flavor as well from the yeast which tastes fantastic and really makes the beer. The fruity grape taste mixes in perfectly with the slight spicy hop they decided to use in this beer. Its a very straight forward beer and that's whole point of this beer. It really drinks like a 5 percent beer rather than the almost 6 percent that it is.","thebrood1987","Jul 22, 2011"

The taste is a little different, I could point out some grassy hop flavors with lemon and biscuit, there is still a hint of alcohol. The beer is light with lots of carbonation. This was a different beer, not like any other Kolsch I have ever had, it's ok but tastes kind of 'homebrew-y'.","JMad","Jul 17, 2011"
3.38,-2.6,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This beer poured out as a clear looking yellow color. The head was slim but not too bad. The smell was sweet and a little grassy. The taste was sweet and fairly light. There is a bit of malt in the afters taste, no hop flavor at all. The mouthfeel is light but fits the style.

3.48,0.3,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Ended up with a selection of Dundee beers from a houseguest, and decided to pop the Kolsch. Really not too bad. I wouldn't give this any awards, and I miss the cool slightly spicy tanginess of a really good Kolsch, but this hit the spot on a hot night. Pours golden with good clarity and a decent pure white head that has some medium retention. Somewhat grainy in the nose with a slight tanginess. The taste has the same graininess, a touch of mellow fruit, and some mild tanginess. A little too soft in the mouth for my taste, particularly on the finish, but there is a decent body and a touch of spice lurking as well. Not bad.","Georgiabeer","Jun 07, 2011"
2.69,-22.5,4.5,3,2.5,3,2,"Body seems a bit on the heavy side. The carbonation is good but I love to have a lighter body here. Overall this one isn't anything special. Not the most offensive beer, but I don't think this is one to even bother with.","Bendurgin","Jun 01, 2011"

Needless to say I had low expectations. I was amazed! I found this to be a fantastic bargain. It comes with all the drinkability of an adjunct beer, with all of the flavor that I would expect from a hand crafted brew. It was light yet filling. A flavor of spice and lemon.

The flavor is also not too great. I get some corn and malt, as well as some sugary sweetness. There is a little bit of grape in the flavor, but it is overshadowed by the other grainy flavors. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Not a beer to seek out.","Mora2000","Apr 03, 2011"
3.56,2.6,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured into a strange glass. Looks beautiful. A Tall white head zigzags around the entire glass. The body is supremely clear, gold as real gold, with tons of slow carb trails. Smell is crackery, with a bit of pepper on the nose. Feel is sort of viscous. Taste is a conglomeration of clean malts, mild hops, and sorta annoying minerals. Finishes with some pleasant spiciness. To be honest, I wish this brew tasted more like it looked, but it was pretty darn good anyways.","sixerofelixir","Mar 28, 2011"

3.7,6.6,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Overall - A very refreshing beer. Just what the style should be. The smell and taste remind me of a chardonnay. Go figure. Anyway, I like it and am glad that it rounds out the 12 pack mixer I bought.","GregBlatz","Mar 20, 2011"
4.08,17.6,4.5,4,4,3.5,4.5,"My aggro pour resulted in two fingers' worth of thick, foamy bone-white head with good retention. Color was a deep golden-yellow that would have made King Midas proud, plus it exhibited NE-quality clarity. A very pretty beer. Nose was as advertised, with biscuity malt notes. Now I was beginning to slaver in anticipation. Mouthfeel was medium with a pleasant lightly sweet maltiness on the tongue. Finish was also as advertised - ""clean and crisp"". I could easily put a sixer of this away on a hot, humid summer day, plus I have not had a clinker yet from the Dundee line. This is a series worth exploring!","woodychandler","Mar 06, 2011"
3.95,13.8,4,4,4,3.5,4,"D: A very drinkable beer. Well balanced flavor and crisp mouthfeel make this a good session beer that has a good amount of flavor backing it up. Worth a look for sure, especially at the relatively cheap price.","DaveBlack","Feb 24, 2011"
3.68,6.1,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Pours a clear light gold with a one finger of bright white foam with good retention. Aromas are typical kolsh: light grassy hops and light graininess and honey.

4,15.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Dundee is branching out with their mixed 12-packs. This beer is clear and heady with a golden color and tightly cropped lace. Dusty biscuits, faintly fruity yeast and a vague note of honey are all in the nose. The crispness goes deep. Its light-ish body does get a fluff from the carbonation. With ample malt to go around, the hops are well placed, and its bitterness keeps the beer on an even keel. Spicy hops and a bite of grain are in the drying finish. Clean and spot-on, this is a highly drinkable light ale, which is comparable to the originals.","BeerAdvocate","Jan 10, 2011"
3.47,0,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"D - Light, dry, and drinkable. There isn't anything particularly complex going on here, but what does one really expect from a Kolsch? The malt is pleasant and bready, but finishes appropriately dry with light, herbal hops. My only real complaint is the utter lack of head and lace, it looks almost like white wine in the glass. Pretty decent, especially for the price.","nickfl","Jan 09, 2011"

Smells of light citrus, wheat, and maybe a slight sweet honeyesque aroma. Very nice. Taste is similar, very bubbly with some sweetness and wheat flavors. Simple, yet balanced and very drinkable. Great example of the style to me. This beer was almost as pleasantly surprising for me as Tom Cruise in Tropic Thunder.","jt31914","Oct 30, 2010"

Head eventually settles into a solid quarter inch cap with a some swaths of lacing exposed during the tasting. Nose is not as clean as I would have anticipated for a Kolsch - I get some adjunct, and maybe a trace of caramel malt and honey. Taste follows nose; however, some light fruity esters come out in the flavor profile and the finish is a little cleaner than the nose would lead one to believe. Perhaps a little bit of hops is expressed in the middle. Mouthfeel is light-bodied, with a lively carbonation that approaches a prickle across the center of the tongue - I feel like there is also a little oiliness or slickness in the mouthfeel as well. Decent, but not by favorite domestic Kolsch. Nonetheless, respectable and better than I anticipated.","Jwale73","Aug 16, 2010"

I think it's something from the Rochester NY water, I tend toget a lot of this flavor from most of their beer. Mild herbal hops not much bitterness added to the mix.

Carbonation level is high, but kind of course...I'd be willing to bet this is force carbonated.

A yellow-to-faint-amber-in-the-middle. The beer left a good 1-1/2 inch head. I am not sure if my glass was what smelled wierd (I guess I should have smelled it first), but the smell of this beer is lemony, but also something not great at all. It might have been a biscuity smell. I thought the taste was good, compared to the smell. I could defintely taste biscuit flavors and a hint of lemon zest.
