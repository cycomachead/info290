3.89,8.7,3.75,4,3.75,4,4,"Light, clean, pilsner malt aroma. No hop aromas. No diacetyl or esters. Pale yellow with a slight haze which is acceptable for the style. Solid, rich, white foam with low retention as it quickly reduced to large soapy bubbles. Medium-light body and smooth, with medium to high carbonation through the middle and slight puckering sensation near the finish. No warming effect. Light pilsner malt flavor up front wit a crisp, clean, dry finish. Good attenuation. No diacetyl. Light, citrusy, hop bitterness at the end. Finished crisply with a light, bready, pilsner malt flavor. No esters. A light, malty beer that is nicely balanced by light bitterness near the finish.","IronLover","Jan 06, 2015"

The resulting two fingers of foamy, French Vanilla-colored head were already fizzing and foaming by the time that I sat the CAN back down. I had low expectations for its sustainability and i was not disappointed, either, as it rapidly fell to wisps. Color was a deep golden-yellow (SRM = 4 - 5) with NE-quality clarity and suddenly, Mammon, Croesus and Midas were across from me, wearing party hats and shouting, ""Faisons la Fete!"" I had no idea that those idiots were bilingual, but ""Let's Party!"" means ""Drink up!"" to me. Nose had a clean, biscuit maltiness. Mouthfeel was medium with a biscuit/bready flavor on the tongue. I did not sense much in the way of hops, but then again, that is not the purpose of the style. Finish was semi-sweet, so there must have been some hops in the mix, keeping the malt sugars from overwhelming the beer. I know that it is a summer beer which I was drinking in early winter, so that makes me CANsider what it would be like on a hot, humid day. I would be willing to bet that it would be nice and refreshing. Tonight, it just makes me want to drink another beer.","woodychandler","Dec 29, 2013"

4.03,12.6,4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"D: This beer is a great thirst quenching brew. So smooth and easy drinking with a nice dryness that keeps you coming back. This is an amazingly sessionable brew. The flavors are good along with everything else going on in here. Sure the aroma could come out a bit more. This a perfect beer on a hot ass day after mowing the lawn. Lovin it.","everetends","Apr 04, 2009"

Pours a golden yellow color with shades of orange in the middle, large frothy white head that fell slowly with good lacing. Looks great for a Kolsch! Aroma is husky and grainy, lightly herbal and grassy, not much in the way of sweetness. Taste is standard fare for a lager-type brew. Grainy malts, some light breadiness, hops are present but way int he background. Lightly malty and lightly hopped, but nicely balanced for the flavors that are there. This is a great summer drinking beer, an easy one to put down. Good stuff. I wish I had more local drinkable beers like this one near me.","KeefD","Aug 31, 2008"

This is a solid, easy-drinking, straightforward ale with good ingredients and fine craftsmanship. Glad I have some to bring home.","IBUnit63","Jun 02, 2008"

4.15,15.9,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Flavor is hoppier than I was expecting; what a great surprise! Bitter grassy hops blended to near-perfection with some biscuity malts and honey. Very crisp, well-carbonated body that finished bitter and left me refreshed and wanting more. Definately one of the more solid Kolsch's I've come across.","wagenvolks","0"
