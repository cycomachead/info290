"This is okay.  I like my Kölsches to have a GREAT maltiness.  This does well on the hoppiness, but there is barely any malt presence.  Increase the malt, and this would be a home run."

"Pours a light gold color with minimal head or lace. Biscuity malty profile and a bit herbal. The taste follows the nose with a biscuity, bready taste and herbal hop bitterness. Medium bodied, well carbonated, smooth and even. Overall, this is an enjoyable kolsch that drinks easy."
"This is a pretty average beer. Bought in a variety pack at Randolph AFB. Poured a medium dark gold with very little head into a pint glass. Nice flavor with no apparent hops. I little citrus leftover. Overall a drinkable beer once the real good stuff is gone."

"o: When I tasted this it immediately became one of my very favorite beers. This is the beer that you can easily cruise through a 6 / 12 pack on hot summer day."

"O: This beer is very easy to drink and has some refreshing properties. I would have no problem drinking a few of these in succession, especially on a hot summer day."

"Pours a golden straw color, moderate froth and little lacing. Scent is pale and contain some musty and tangy grain, light earthy hopping. Taste is bolder than many kolsches i've sampled, grain profile stronger in taste but earthy hop presence right on. Lighter side of medium bodied. Overall, a nice, highly drinkable beer, surprised by the boldness of the ABVs."
""
"D: Alright for the style, but on the fruity end of the spectrum. Light malts, balanced hops, lots of fruity, estery yeast contribution. Simple, yet flavorful and refreshing enough. Personally, I like a Kolsch to be softer and more grainy malt forward. My preferences aside, this fruity number is alright. Nice to see a “gateway” brewery take an okay stab at the style."

"O- can't complain, a sessionable beer for warm days, nothing mind blowing, nothing dissapointing either."
"Nothing exceptional about this beer, but nothing really objectionable either. Goes pretty well with a burger. No pun to the burghers intended. What this is missing is some yeast funk and a more pronounced (but not necessarily more aggressive or upfront) yeast funk. Not a bad beer, it's drinkable, just not on the level of the great examples of this style."
"O: Very drinkable to style. Very mild in character all the way around."
"This beer formed a 1 and a half inch head which it lost somewhat rapidly. It was straw colored and transparent. I could read the beer label through the mug. There was a decent amount of lacing. It had a bready smell. It was not big on carbonation but carbonation was evident in the mouth feel. It was thicker then water but not much. It made my mouth pucker somewhat and had a lasting bitter aftertaste though not overwhelmingly so."
"Wish I could get these in a 6 pack by themselves. It would make for a great session beer. As it is, I find them the best of all the beers I've tried from this brewery."
"I may be wrong, as with this Dundee variety pack, I am eating Chesapeake bay oysters that are wonderful, but I taste corn in all of the beers and that gets a big boo from me! JZesus caint i just make a simple comment; why all the required fields; it's only rock and roll!"
"Working through a Dundee sampler pack thanks to my brother. Nice guy. This offering pours a clear sorta-pale straw topped by a short-lived half-finger of dirty white foam. The nose comprises tangelo zest, musty biscuits, very light toffee, and old nutmeg. The taste runs very similarly, with some lemon zest joining the fun, along with some light black pepper and a few drips of honey. The spiciness twangs the tongue nigh into numbness. Luckily, things don't last too long, as every flavor flies off rather quickly. The body is fairly light, with a moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, I didn't enjoy this kolsch too much. I wish i could say more, but I really can't. Sorry..."
"Highly drinkable, great light summer beer."
"Its a refreshing and easy drinking beer with no real flawed flavors. It seems less hoppy than most that I have tried for the style"
"I also get that slight fruity grape flavor as well from the yeast which tastes fantastic and really makes the beer. The fruity grape taste mixes in perfectly with the slight spicy hop they decided to use in this beer. Its a very straight forward beer and that's whole point of this beer. It really drinks like a 5 percent beer rather than the almost 6 percent that it is."
"O: Easy-drinking kolsch that is refreshing but doesn't knock me off my feet in any category."
"The beer is a pale golden yellow with a foamy white head that quickly dissipated.The smell is mostly grain and lemon and there is a surprising hint of alcohol. The taste is a little different, I could point out some grassy hop flavors with lemon and biscuit, there is still a hint of alcohol. The beer is light with lots of carbonation. This was a different beer, not like any other Kolsch I have ever had, it's ok but tastes kind of 'homebrew-y'."
"This beer poured out as a clear looking yellow color. The head was slim but not too bad. The smell was sweet and a little grassy. The taste was sweet and fairly light. There is a bit of malt in the afters taste, no hop flavor at all. The mouthfeel is light but fits the style. Overall it's not a bad Kolsch but not as good as some others out there."
"Ended up with a selection of Dundee beers from a houseguest, and decided to pop the Kolsch. Really not too bad. I wouldn't give this any awards, and I miss the cool slightly spicy tanginess of a really good Kolsch, but this hit the spot on a hot night. Pours golden with good clarity and a decent pure white head that has some medium retention. Somewhat grainy in the nose with a slight tanginess. The taste has the same graininess, a touch of mellow fruit, and some mild tanginess. A little too soft in the mouth for my taste, particularly on the finish, but there is a decent body and a touch of spice lurking as well. Not bad."
"Body seems a bit on the heavy side. The carbonation is good but I love to have a lighter body here. Overall this one isn't anything special. Not the most offensive beer, but I don't think this is one to even bother with."
"O - An ok beer I guess. I haven't had too many examples of this style but all have been mediocre. A worthy beer for sure."
"Overall - this is a decent beer, somewhat unique but nothing to write home about. Try it once and move on."
"O-boring but no negative qualities. great for a hot day. not sure this is great for a kolsch though. I've only had one other kolsch and it was much better tasting."
"The mouthfeel is easily this beer's strong suit. It's well-carbonated and has that nice drying sensation on the end of the mouth. The drinkability is pretty good. Overall, this is just an alright Kolsch. It's not bad, but I've had much better."
"I found this beer to be almost perfect. As a drinker of lighter colored brews I have many options. I found this in a multipack at a Kroger store. Needless to say I had low expectations. I was amazed! I found this to be a fantastic bargain. It comes with all the drinkability of an adjunct beer, with all of the flavor that I would expect from a hand crafted brew. It was light yet filling. A flavor of spice and lemon. I give his a thumbs up."
"I think I'll have another"
"Overall a very nice beer and I'd definetely drink it again."
"The beer pours a light clear yellow color with a white head. The aroma is grain and corn, with a little a bit of something off in it. Not a nice smelling beer. The flavor is also not too great. I get some corn and malt, as well as some sugary sweetness. There is a little bit of grape in the flavor, but it is overshadowed by the other grainy flavors. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Not a beer to seek out."
"Poured into a strange glass. Looks beautiful. A Tall white head zigzags around the entire glass. The body is supremely clear, gold as real gold, with tons of slow carb trails. Smell is crackery, with a bit of pepper on the nose. Feel is sort of viscous. Taste is a conglomeration of clean malts, mild hops, and sorta annoying minerals. Finishes with some pleasant spiciness. To be honest, I wish this brew tasted more like it looked, but it was pretty darn good anyways."
"O - I'd drink this one again. It was a good thirst quencher that the Macro lovers would get into."
"Overall - A very refreshing beer. Just what the style should be. The smell and taste remind me of a chardonnay. Go figure. Anyway, I like it and am glad that it rounds out the 12 pack mixer I bought."
"My aggro pour resulted in two fingers' worth of thick, foamy bone-white head with good retention. Color was a deep golden-yellow that would have made King Midas proud, plus it exhibited NE-quality clarity. A very pretty beer. Nose was as advertised, with biscuity malt notes. Now I was beginning to slaver in anticipation. Mouthfeel was medium with a pleasant lightly sweet maltiness on the tongue. Finish was also as advertised - ""clean and crisp"". I could easily put a sixer of this away on a hot, humid summer day, plus I have not had a clinker yet from the Dundee line. This is a series worth exploring!"
"D: A very drinkable beer. Well balanced flavor and crisp mouthfeel make this a good session beer that has a good amount of flavor backing it up. Worth a look for sure, especially at the relatively cheap price."
"Pours a clear light gold with a one finger of bright white foam with good retention. Aromas are typical kolsh: light grassy hops and light graininess and honey. Taste is predominantly sweet and perfectly consistent with the nose. Very refreshing, simple, straightforward. Nothing fancy but nothing foul. Solid."
"D - This is one of the most thoroughly drinkable beers I know. I wouldn't place it above Pilsner Urquell, but yeah, I could drink a lot of this, it's a terrific hot afternoon beer."
"As usual, the score you see here is weighted too heavily on appearance and aroma, so one more average beer slips by with a B something rating."
"D- There's really nothing to this beer. It goes down pretty easy and is rather boring."
"Another not great but darn good beer, at a bargain price."
"The Rest: Body is medium and drinkability is good. A decent beer, hurt by the graininess that's always lingering around."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is somewhat sweet, some malts. Taste is good, malts, biscuty, slightly sweet. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a good quality beer."
"However the beer does lack certain grain, hop and sulphur aromas/flavors that are found in Kolsches like Reisdorf and others."
"D - Highly drinkable, esp on warmer days."
"Drinkability: As a Kölsch, it's neither particularly authentic nor particularly good, but it is easily drinkable. So, it's essentially on-par with the rest of their offerings.As"
"Dundee is branching out with their mixed 12-packs. This beer is clear and heady with a golden color and tightly cropped lace. Dusty biscuits, faintly fruity yeast and a vague note of honey are all in the nose. The crispness goes deep. Its light-ish body does get a fluff from the carbonation. With ample malt to go around, the hops are well placed, and its bitterness keeps the beer on an even keel. Spicy hops and a bite of grain are in the drying finish. Clean and spot-on, this is a highly drinkable light ale, which is comparable to the originals."
"D - Light, dry, and drinkable. There isn't anything particularly complex going on here, but what does one really expect from a Kolsch? The malt is pleasant and bready, but finishes appropriately dry with light, herbal hops. My only real complaint is the utter lack of head and lace, it looks almost like white wine in the glass. Pretty decent, especially for the price."
"What struck me about this beer was the crisp, fresh feel it had to it, very clean throughout. Appearance and smell were pretty average with typical color and no unique or very distinguishable scents. This would be a great summer beer to go with a picnic or to watch a baseball game."
" ~ This is a beer that's worth a sample. Especially if you're a fan of ales of the German decent. This is a nice beer."
"While this is not really a bad beer by any means, it lacks the crispness that comes with most sweeter beers that positions themselves on drinkability over a really full bodies texture or flavor."
"D: A little flavorful, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, even though it's just a mediocre beer overall, this is a decent poundable beer to drink for a while."
"D - Goes down fairly easy, but isn't especially fun to drink. A decent brew for the price, and a worthy beer for most fridges, but nothing special."
"Head of two finger proportions, white in color and medium foam. Lace broken, yet lots of cling, layer on layer. Color, a 6 on the SRM Beer Color Chart. Clear with few carbonation bubbles. Smell of wet straw, wheat, malt, and lemons. Tastes of roasted wheat, corn, barley malt, lemon, and a whips' of pine. Medium body across my tongue and teeth. Not bad, but not great, not one I would turn down if offered and would buy above most of the big three."
"D: Setting aside issues of faithfulness to style, I would classify this as boring but refreshing. Would be pretty decent on a hot summer day."
"This is a safe, unadventurous beer, which is a good or bad thing depending upon the occasion and the drinker"
"Conclusion: Well this is a pretty good beer, and if I brewed it I would be happy. It isn't the best around for this style however, and is better enjoyed as an attempt at the style and not something to reference when talk about Kolsch ales."
"D - Not my favorite style by a long shot but I found this beer to be pretty decent tasting and easy to drink I could drink a few of these in a sitting its worth a try sometime"
"Drinkability: Nice session beer. This would be a great beer to have with diner."
"D - Decent drinkability for an average brew, this kolsch needs some work but it's not awful."
"Bought this in a sample 12pack.I'm enjoying this one as well as I did the others. Its got a sweet taste but is a lite brew. The kind of brew you want to binge drink and party all night. Slighty fruity and wheaty.It did have some nice carbonation.I agree with the other reviews that this would beat out other lite beers.It goes down the hatch real easy.Pick some up. Also its cheap. Oyeah and goes well with pretzels."
"Bought the dundee sampler cause it was cheap (damned monetary constraints), and this ended up being my surprise favorite of the bunch. I typically am not a kolsch fan, but this brew was quite well done. Nice straw color; however, lacked any head really, which was disappointing to me. Smells of light citrus, wheat, and maybe a slight sweet honeyesque aroma. Very nice. Taste is similar, very bubbly with some sweetness and wheat flavors. Simple, yet balanced and very drinkable. Great example of the style to me. This beer was almost as pleasantly surprising for me as Tom Cruise in Tropic Thunder."
"Fairly light bodied, crisp carbonation, and fairly drinkable. For a stab at the style, I think Dundee could have done better."
"Things that make you go hum. I saw this beer on the shelf and asked why not? Well, the reason was obvious once I got it home and popped the cap. No life and no head. Can you say skanky? I thought you could. The Dundee Stout was not too bad, but this Kolsch Ale is simply tasteless and stale."
"D- Dundee makes a brew that can be pounded. Kolsch style is a brew that you can drink over and over. Compliments for the surprising flavor and the slam dunk drinkability!"
"Out of the sampler, this is by far the most drinkable"
"Decent drink though the spice notes become a bit overwhelming and seem a bit out of character. Think a 'spiced summer cooler' instead of 'winter warmer' and you've got it."
"It finishes somewhat crisp but with a flavor of alcohol that is more noticeable than expected. Medium to light feel with a modest level of carbonation. This brew isnt really that enjoyable, the sweetness verse hops verse alcohol just doesn't do it for me. I haven't had a bunch of kolsch style offerings but I can tell you this one is average at best. If you want to maximize your enjoyment level with this beer, make sure you have a glass with etching on the bottom of it and fire away!"
"I say about this beer what I'll say about all of Dundee's beers: If you want to teach someone about beer, by some Dundee styles and train them on what are simple examples of the various styles. This one is a bit malty for a Kolsch though. Not bad, not great"
"Tiny lace of head at the edges of the glass, goes down like watery light beer. not much smell or taste to speak of, just a generic light beer. I would say slightly better quality than bud/coors/keystone...so I have to agree with the reviewer that said they could market this as ""dundee light"" and totally destroy the other ""light"" labeled beers. Also, you could probably drink a million of them though so i gave it a good score there."
"Not my favorite in this mixed pack - stick to the Pale Bock or the Stout."
" ."
"Bottle: Poured a light blonde color Kolsch with an average foamy head with OK retention and not much lacing. Aroma of lightly sweet malt with clean cereal notes. Taste is not the most complex with some satisfying notes of cereal and lightly sweet background. Body is about average with good carbonation. Refreshing and drinkable though not as complex as it good be."
"12oz. bottle served in my SA Perfect Pint. Poured a translucent golden yellow with a one inch, soft, fluffy, bright white head. Head eventually settles into a solid quarter inch cap with a some swaths of lacing exposed during the tasting. Nose is not as clean as I would have anticipated for a Kolsch - I get some adjunct, and maybe a trace of caramel malt and honey. Taste follows nose; however, some light fruity esters come out in the flavor profile and the finish is a little cleaner than the nose would lead one to believe. Perhaps a little bit of hops is expressed in the middle. Mouthfeel is light-bodied, with a lively carbonation that approaches a prickle across the center of the tongue - I feel like there is also a little oiliness or slickness in the mouthfeel as well. Decent, but not by favorite domestic Kolsch. Nonetheless, respectable and better than I anticipated."
"A good medium-bodied beer; good taste, goes down easy making you want another."
"wonderfully fresh, sweet malt smell that isn't bothersome like most 'sweet' noses i sample. dry 'finish' for a smell, but that's a bonus. something different and cereal-like. translates well into the taste, a drier finish than expected, crisp mouthfeel with some creaminess. great summer evening brew. waste your sweat on a lesser brew."
"D: Goes down easily, but not very appealing."
"D - A pretty nice brew that I could see getting again. Pretty much standard brew that is both full of flavor and drinkable."
"Clear golden colored body, lots of little bubbles make up a bit cream colored head. Fair amount of lace. Light sweet malt scent. Sweet malt from, biscuit, nice light floral hop finish. Clean and creamy mouth. Kolsch is never a very complex brew. This is a good version of it. Nice beer."
"Overall, a decent beer. At least worth trying out."
"pours a transparent golden copper color with spare white frothy head, spare lacing, and soft carbonation. straw like malty smell with lemon hints as well. taste is much the same with some bread, citrus hints. slightly bitter, light body, and short flavor duration. thin texture that goes down smooth and is very easy to drink. light bitter finish."
"A fairly descent beer. A first time with this style of beer."
"The mouth is nice and crisp. While this is an easy drinker for the summer, the beer misses several touchstones of this style."
"Taste is light and crisp, definitely the sweet malt runs the show, a buttery slickness on the tongue, lack of hops is a bit disappointing but I'm not surprised at the lack thereof."
"D - Very drinkable. There's not a ton of flavor though, so it doesn't go with too many foods."
"Disappointing flavor that has some elements of Belgian yeast. Berry fruit notes that are particularly strong in the swallow. The aftertaste is short lived and somewhat sour, like sour milk. Good body and carbonation. Worthwhile to try."
"Not real familiar with the style so I'm not sure if it's a great Kolsch, but it's very pleasant and drinkable. I could do a six of these without a problem."
"Bright deep golden body, crystal clear hue with bright white head forms uneven lacing around the edge of the glass with each sip. Aroma semi sweet biscuit malts, nice bready layers form with a hint of herbal hops. Pretty tame with a hint of a copper penny or metallic note. Flavor, slightly fruit notes a bready malt character with lingering biscuit dough finish, slight metallic edge that doesn't come off offensive... I think it's something from the Rochester NY water, I tend toget a lot of this flavor from most of their beer. Mild herbal hops not much bitterness added to the mix. Mouthfeel is light bodied sturdy carbonation definitely forced, overall nothing offensive or spectacular. A nice sessionable pseudo craft brew from a stand up regional brewer that I happen to care for."
"Drinkability- Definitely has good drinkability. This beer goes down very easy and delivers satisfying belches."
"A little bit, but not too much. Still is missing a nice kolsch yeast flavor that is so nice in classic versions of the style. Sweet, grainy malts are there and bolstered by some toasty and crackery notes. Lacking in the hop department, but there is a mild caress of bitterness at the end. Carbonation level is high, but kind of course...I'd be willing to bet this is force carbonated. It's a mildly refreshing beer that is fairly unoffensive, but it does not really represent the kolsch style very well."
"Not a bad warm weather brew..Seems low in ABV so you can put a few away without becoming loopy. Also isn't any worse for wear as it gets warmer..Still very drinkable."
"D - This is an okay kolsch. The taste just is a little odd."
"Notes: For an easy drinking light summery beer this will work."
"Nothing cheap tasting about this, a decent Dundee offering I wouldn't mind having a six pack of in the future. Plus, the price..."
"I thought that the Dundee Kolsch-Style Ale was pretty good overall. Not the best, but a beer that should be tried. The appearance is what it is expected to be. A yellow-to-faint-amber-in-the-middle. The beer left a good 1-1/2 inch head. I am not sure if my glass was what smelled wierd (I guess I should have smelled it first), but the smell of this beer is lemony, but also something not great at all. It might have been a biscuity smell. I thought the taste was good, compared to the smell. I could defintely taste biscuit flavors and a hint of lemon zest. The beer did not catch well in my mouth as I kept thinking of the smell. I will only drink the rest of these in order with the rest of the mixed pack. Not bad...but not great!"
"Clear and gold with a finger of white head. The head shrinks pretty quickly, but there is lots of carbonation rising from the bottom of the glass. Lots of grainy sweetness in the nose with a hint of lemon. Taste is pretty unimpressive. Sweet just like the smell and again with the touch of lemon. Has a pretty clean finish. Probably the worst in the sampler pack."
"The beer pours a nice gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a light, pale malt scent along with a dry finish. The hop aroma is light and there is limited yeast character. The taste is decent. It has a smooth pale and Munich malt flavor that's a tad sweet. It goes down easy with low hops and a subtle yeast fruitiness in the finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate/good carbonation. This is a pretty good beer. I've had better kolsch's, but this is a quality offering."
"Sampled on April 13, 2010. It pours a golden yellow with quickly rising carbonation and an inch to inch and a half fiuzzy white head that pops and bubbles down to a thin ring. Malts are clearly the lead aroma with a nice clean but light hoppy sensation in there too. The mouthfeel is around medium. The malts and Euro-hops blend together well to provide a decent, fresh balance that remains clean to the end. This was rather easy to drink."
"D: Could drink it for a while but think best served cold on a nice summer day poolside."
"Why call something Kolsch-style when it doesn't even come close to the style? I'd rather have a real kolsch over this."
"Cheers!"
"Kind of a summer type ale."
