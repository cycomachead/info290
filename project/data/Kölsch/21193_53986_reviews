"The Bros call this beer world class.  I'm not sure about that.  It is an excellent Koelsch though.  I poured it from the bottle into a koelsch glass.  Looks like a koelsch should.  It's got a good bitterness to it, with some herbal and floral flavors."
"First of this style, reminds me of a golden/cream ale. Good and malty, light, with a hint if corn. Great for a summer day."

"O - Good beer.  Looking to revisit some of the lighter styles in 2015."

"3.94/5: Excellent example of an underrated style"

"Pours a hazy light golden with a thin white head. Not much retention, and just a little lace. Aroma  is of bready grains with hints or fruit. Body is light and crisp with a good amount of carbonation. Taste is fruiter than is typical for this style. Some hints of grain and a nice sweet finish. Really good!"

""
""
"O: Not much experience with the Kolsch style, but this will persuade me to try a few others. This is off the chain good and I will be buying more. M.E. hit this out of the park!"

"This is a medium to light bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is super easy drinking and very crisp/refreshing. Per the style it is pretty mild and clean. If you want a beer you can down a sixer of with no regrets, this is the one."

"O: An excellent Kolsch. Got this one in Whole Foods, Raleigh NC today, June 13, 2014. Really enjoying this fantastic styled beer, true to form."

"Nice example of the style. Very refreshing."

"Pours a pretty foggy yellow. White head. Nose is airy grass. Seems almost like lemon on there too, which comes on the flavor profile as well. Beyond that it’s fairly crisp, though it seems somewhat unfiltered. Kind of grassy. Very mild earth tone. A nice drinker. This style gets chopped up pretty badly a lot, but this is a nice example."

"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a very pale, goldenrod coloring with a thin, clingy, frothy, white layer of head. Aromas of toast and peppery hops. Light and clean on the nose. Flavors are toasted forward, with a bolt of pepper and dry, resinous hops. Very clean and extremely balanced palate. The aftertaste is more heavily toasted, with cut grass and bitter characteristics. The finish is dry, clean, and crisp."
"O: This is an outstanding brew, and an exercise in care and subtlety, and it had to be given the transparency of the style and the ease with which it can be flubbed. If you don't like this, then you just don't like Kolschs."
""

"Taste is complex, immediately great. Hits of almost champagney-like grapes (though the carbonation may be fooling with me), mild alcohol notes, tastes extremely clean all the way through the first taste to the aftertaste. Extremely refreshing. Really like this one, especially with waning summer months."

"Pour from bottle, thin head, a little hazy, mild carbination. Nice aroma, light fruit, nothing over the top but set off this beer from others. Enjoyed the taste, light, crisp, but also some complimentary notes of hops, malt and yeast. Overally, a very drinkable, refreshing beer that also has some depth and interest vs others, seems to be a very good representation of the Kolsch style. I would buy again."

"O: Another enjoyable brew from Mother Earth - these guys make some really enjoyable and easy drinking beers. Super easy to drink and refreshing on a warm day - matched well with the BLT and black bean burgers at lunch."

"Overall a real solid Kölsch, and probably one of the few that I've had that reminds me of ones that are German. Always in search of the ultimate Kölsch, the Kwest continues in earnest."
""
""
"A new style of beer for me and not one that hit the spot. Obviously others liked this beer, but it did not suit my taste. Perhaps it sat in the growler too long. I went skiing in Montana.and left it in the fridge opened. Will have to revisit Kolschs in the future to make a final decision."

"This beer pours up a pale straw with not much head and almost no lacing. It is clear enough to read a newspaper through. Smell is malt, biscuit, grasses, and floral. Taste is pretty sweet upfront followed by a nice, but mildly tangy finish. Not a whole lot of hops to it, but still nice. Not every beer has to be some massive hop bomb to be good. Mouthfeel is fairly full without a whole lot of carbonation. Not too shabby, especially if you are looking for something that is very sessionable."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Though not the best take on a Kolsch in the region (COAST handily has that distinction), this is easily drinkable and better than I was expecting based on the aroma."
"O- Honestly one of the best Kolsch's i have ever had....phenomenal!"
""
""
""
"O: A sweet beer with strong wheat and corn flavor. Only a hint of hops lurking somewhere. A very drinkable summer brew to be sure, but not a standout in its style. I was intrigued by the grain-like taste that I cannot describe better than ""straw-like"" but not in any sort of negative sense. Interesting."
""
"Overall fairly impressed. Most places try to go overboard with a Kolsch, or way under and it has no flavor. For an ale this is loaded with lager like flavors which is great for a Kolsch. Nice malts, soft almost decoction layered feel, and interesting fruit flavor that gives and interesting and weird slight tangy like flavor."
"O - Overall this was a nice Kolsch. Not my favorite representation of the style, but its still pretty good."
""
""
""
"Full bodied flavor with biscuit notes that matures into a noble hop finish and a clean aftertaste. Carbonation is a little high in my eyes but I realize that is being true to the style. A lot to like here, overall. Not a thin yellow lager, this has complexity and drinkability, and certainly qualifies as refreshing as well. i'm not sure i'd drink it mowing the lawn but certainly after."

"I held for a long time to try this new brewery out and was not disappointed. Glad to get fresh batches being only an hour away."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very distinct style of beer. I really enjoyed this. Usually beers this light do not have strong flavors, but this beer in particular is full flavored and very tasty."
""
""
""
"Drinkability: A pretty good Kölsch. Great way to end the work day at the beer store."
""
"Endless River is a great session beer, best cold, but still enjoyable after warmth."
"O: I'm not overly familiar with the kolsch style, but this seems in line with the style description. Being in NC, I'd be happy to have a few more of these this summer."

"Rich, malty aroma has caramel and earthy notes and a hint of molasses. It pours a clear solar yellow with a fairly thick, if not too persistent, white head that leaves minimal lacing. Flavor fills the mouth with malt that has caramel, earthy, and edgy bitter hoppy underpinnings. Lively texture has a little more than average body, and leaves a subtle tingle."
""
""
""
"Kolsch is not my favorite style, but this is a damn fine beer. The hop character is great, and it drinks well."
""
""
""
""
""
"No head to speak of, clear yellow amber and minimal lace. Straw scent, not pronounced. Delicately understated fresh light barley flavor, with a pleasant almost metallic aftertaste. Not flat, but not zippy either. Overall a fairly good beer that is worth trying, most likely in warmer weather. Not as soft as a real Kolch, most likely due to water."
""
"Overall this was a nice light refreshing Kölsch. Although nothing special really stuck out it was quite solid for the style."
"The aroma was rather bright and summer like, with a light grain and herb like fruit note in the nose. A touch of clove and banana highlighted this one and really did a nice job at bringing the whole thing together. The flavor was much of the same. Surprisingly sweet, with a touch of maybe honey or light caramel, hints of apple and light fresh hay. The banana coming though nicely on the finish with a quick, clean, and very crisp cutoff in the overall taste."
""
"O- this beer shows that you can have great flavor with low alcohol. I wish I had this in the summer."

"{revised with Nov. 2014 sample on tap)."
"O: Good one for drinking on the back porch in the afternoon. Not incredibly overwhelmed by it, but I would have it again. Haven't really had many of this style before, but if this is a good example of the style(as seems to be the case judging from the consenus of the reviews), it struck me as a laid-back, tasty summer beer."
"It is only because I have drank plenty of kolsch in Cologne that I maintain a snobby line here. otherwise this is the second best kolsch I have so far found brewed in America."
"3.5 O: Overall, would definitely have this again, very refreshing."
"O: Not sure where that white wine/grape flavor came from, but it really ruined the beer."
"o - overall not bad, not great. this is a style that i've begun exploring recently and this one is okay. bear in mind that i sat on this one for a while, so possibly it is past it's prime?"
"Overall: Not particularly Germanic in style, but very approachable; a great summer crossover beer"
"D - this beer goes to show that simple can often be incredibly flavorful. Perfect for summer drinking."
"O - Solid example of a Kolsch, perfectly sessionable on a hot day."
"O- not a bad beer. Definately appreciate the oportunity to try a beer i cant get around here."
"Honestly, I enjoyed this more than anticipated. Thanks again for the opportunity Jason."
"Overall-- this just doesn't do it for me. I love a good Kolsch, and this is one I wanted to love-- sadly, it just isn't very good."
"Overall impression: A great brew. I gotta get some more of this pronto."
"O: A very sessionable kolsch. Great flavor, nice and light."
"t- carbonates with a touch of tart lager. Some maltyness and a hint of sweetness, caramel. Kind of lacking in flavor. Not bad not great"
"This is one of my favorite styles of beers and Mother Earth makes a great one! It helps that they are just down the road from me. Like a good hef, the yeast leaves behind a fruity, tangy taste, although a kolsch isn't near as yeasty. The sweetness is balanced by a nice hop bitterness. Hardly a hoppy beer, but just enough to bite the side of your tounge. I highly recommend this beer! In fact, I'm gonna have one now!"
"O- Right near the top of the list of kolschs. Definite recomendation for a sessionable beer high on flavor."
"Served from tap into a sampler shaker. Poured golden yellow with a one finger pure white head. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, banana, and wheat. The flavor was of sweet malt, banana, wheat, slight grain, and water. It had a light feel on the palate with low carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew, but that is being nice. This one was pretty weak in just about all aspects if I'm honest. Could definitely be A LOT more robust. It would make a good summer brew or gateway beer, but that is about it."
"Tasted on tap at Louella's BBQ place in Asheville, NC. Worth a visit if you're hungry and want to try a decent selection of beers on tap."
"drinks quite well, i could see sixers of this going down very easily on a hot summer day. too bad its not available in my area. a nice clean, simple kolsch, with a nice little hop bite. well done!"
"This brewery is local to me and I have been wanting to sample their wares for a while now. Pours a hazy pale yellow with a white head that is impressive at first but doesn't stick around. Smells of butter and biscuits with a hint of grass. The flavor is bright and pungent. Lots of malt up front and. Aftertaste is floral and herbal with a great hop tingle. Mouthfeel is robust and slightly filmy. Drinkability is great with a low alcohol content and great, well-balanced taste. However, at $9.99 a six pack I'll save this one for special occassions."
"It pours a light golden blonde like a morning sunrise pushing through the hazy morning dew. An inviting aroma of toasted wheat bread gently reminds me I picked the perfect beer. Light in taste with a slight sweet hop spice perfectly placed at the end each sip. Inoffensive in every way possible. Kinder than a Michelob Ultra but made to be enjoyed rather than profited from."
"It's impossible to hide potential flaws in lighter beer styles. Thankfully, Mother Earth did not have to worry about this--no flaws. A great example of the style."
"This beer is light, clean, crisp, and easy drinking. It poured a golden color with a thin white head. Flavors of pale malts. This beer has a light body and is a pleasure to drink. This is a very approachable beer and is a great session beer for a hot day."
"Good looking. Clear golden. Medium head. Moderate lacing. Smell is clean with earthy, bready, grainy undertones. Some hop character and vinous. Excellent taste. All aspects of nose displayed in balance. Mouthfeel is also quite nice. Light tingle, good dryness in the finish. Could easily drink this one as a session brew. A style that I consider a favorite when done right. This one has that covered."
"Courtesy of Bucketboy. 12oz. bottle served in a stange. Bottled on 08 10 indicated on the label. Pours a translucent yellow-gold with a loose, one inch, bright white head composed of tiny, compressed bubbles. Head eventually dissipates into a frothy skim, with delicate swaths and spots of lacing revealed during the session. Nose expresses light grains with perhaps a trace of citrus - an extremely clean presentation. Taste follows nose with a light, lingering skunky quality - not bad and somewhat characteristic of the style from my limited experience. Mouthfeel is light-medium, consistency is perhaps a little heavier than I've come to associate with the style, with a lively effervescence. All and all, a very nice and drinkable domestic kolsch. Perhaps not as delicate as some of it's German cousins, but very approachable and sessionable."
"Light/medium body with crisp carbonation. A bit heavier than most kolsches. Overall it's decent - much more overt flavor than a typical kolsch which may be a positive or a negative depending what you expect from your kolsch."
"Pours a hazed golden color with a white head and small lacing. Smells of floral hops, citrus, and grain. Taste quite bitter with a little orange peel thrown in there for kicks. Mouthfeel is decent but quite thin. Drinkability is average. Not a terrible beer, just not up to Mother Earths norm."
"Drinkability: A fairly likable Kölsch. Good for the dog days of Summer, but suits me just fine during a coolish mid-afternoon in Autumn. Paired well enough with a grilled shrimp po' boy."
"D - Several of my non-craft drinking friends loved this beer, said it reminded them of GI Urban Wheat (uhhh, not sure about that), but this appears to be a great crossover beer. I wouldn't mind another one of these, but wouldn't seek it out."
"Very refreshing. Very drinkable as well."
"Totally acceptable Kölsch here, that while maybe not the most full flavored version of the style that I've had, still stayed mostly tasty and quaffable. I wouldn't turn down a glass of this on a hot day."
"Sparkling pale yellow with a fluffy, lumpy pure-white head on top. Light, fresh pale malt aroma with soft grassy hops and a subtle apple and lemon frutiness. Lightly sweet cereal grain flavor finishing with a crisp bitterness. The hops are subtle and have an earthy, leafiness to them. Light, crisp, extremely drinkable...perfect for hot NC days. It's very simple, but well made. I like what these guys are doing..."
"The taste is malty with a little grassy hops in the finish. Pleasant and refreshing. Mouthfeel is crisp, the little bitterness at the end is good. Drinkability is fine. Would be a decent enough session beer."
"I rated the Drinkability higher as it does go down smooth and I could see drinking these all night."
"A good, clean orangish body that is well-carb'd w/ sticking head on top of a strong, peppery almost sour fruit like aroma as well as minor sweet malts. Light-bodied and slightly smooth and creamy w/ some minor fruit sweetness like grape can candy apple as well as sour notes. Mixed w/ a touch of sweet malt for balance and hop bitterness and carbonation lead to a sharp spicey backbite. A fairly good and sessionable kolsch that is decent rep of this style."
"D: Another nice session with Mother Earth. Solid drinkable beers if you were to ask my opinion."
"The taste is very much like the nose; bready and toasty grains and floral hops. Like the nose there is also a slightly sweet flavor, more honey than fruit. Light/medium bodied and moderately carbonated. Very easy to drink and enjoyable."
"Impressive beer from an impressive new brewery. Looking forward to watching Mother Earth Brewing grow."
"Overall, a very easy drinking Kolsch. Lots of nice flavors with an easy drinking body. Very refreshing. This is one for the lakes! Thanks Jason for this new beer!"
"This is surprisingly hoppy for a kolsch. It's full of dull grapefruit and herbal spice. The typical, subtle fruit flavors are gone for a dark bread crust malt flavor. The beer doesn't taste bad, it just doesn't taste like a kolsch at all. It's good, but don't expect anything traditional. Worth a try."
"Drinkability is, as per usual for the style, excellent. Not quite on par with the COAST offering I just finished because of the minor sulphur presence, but really, there's not much of a limit as to how much of this I could drink before getting tired of it. Tasty, tasty beer."
"Overall a very well done kolsch."
"Overall, this was my first experience drinking a Mother Earth brew and I will be drinking more in the future. I actually picked up a six pack of their India Pale Ale this afternoon and can't wait to try it. Endless River seems like a great beer for Spring/Summer, especially for those such as myself who don't really care for wheat beers. I hope BA's in NC will support this brewery."
"The body is crisp and bubbly. Refreshing feel. Great lemony flavor right away. Silky buttery feel. Some bready biscuit aftertaste. Definite noble hops present as well. I really like this beer. This style is quickly becoming one of my go-to's, and this one is a great example."
"single from Sam's, Durham"
"Days like today here in Carolina are days to drink a good kolsch,warm and lazy.Poured into a standard pint glass,a light pale yellow with a thinner but well defined white head,quite spritzy looking.Toasted grain aromas with a hint of vanilla tinge,flavors are again lightly toasty with a cereal grain-like note,a light quenching tartness in the finish.A nice kolsch here,not just something to throw back by any means,nice flavor."
"M/D: Light to medium bodied, carbonation is bordering on high. Excellent drinkability. This is a very good Kolsch in my opinion, and I would put it up against any domestic Kolsch out there. A beer like this gives me high hops for Mother Earth moving forward."
"The flavor is definitely beer, though. The dry sweetness from the aroma isn't as apparent, as I am more aware of the soft, earthy hop character and a bit of biscuit from the malt and yeast. The texture is quite smooth, but at the same time pleasantly tingly with its soft carbonation. Overall, this one is mild without being watery, making it a light and enjoyable selection."
"The drink is light-bodied, softly carbonated, and extremely easy to drink. Good beer, classy labeling and such, but a bit expensive at over 12 bucks a sixer."
"Somewhat bland flavor, even for a kölsch, and even as Endless River warms. Saltine crackers and pilsner malt lay down a light, bready foundation upon which a sharp, grassy hop bitterness is built (soapy-tasting on the way back up). Carbonation is big and bubbly, contrasting nicely against the light body, and adds a snappy, zesty, almost drying bite to the finish. An easy-drinking kölsch, for sure, but I expected a bit more out of Mother Earth considering the steep price tag and the precedent set by their Sisters of the Moon IPA."
"And bingo! A classic East-Coast Kolsch. Right now, I'm hard pressed to think of one I've enjoyed much more than Endless River."
"On-tap at Flying Saucer Raleigh on Nov. 30 served in a standard pint glass and reviewed from notes. Served a crisp straw yellow with a thin diminishing head. Aroma is sweet malts and Earthy hops, taste is more of the same, holding pretty true to the style. The beer is quite light, crisp, smooth and refreshing. This one was quite enjoyable, one I'd love to enjoy more of, especially in the warmer months."
"I will start by saying that this is generally not my style of beer but I bought a mixer of all their beers. Also, this should probably be reviewed during the summer months after a long, hot day outside. I found this beer to be very refreshing and light. Beautiful gold color with a nice head on top. Everything tasted just right. I may have this as my go to summer beer when they put it on tap for home kegs."
