4,10.8,,,,,,"04/26/14 From a can. Thanks to AJ at Super Buyrite. This is more substantial than Kolschs I've know. Nothing wrong with that as long as it's balanced. Firm head atop a slightly darker beer than the light blondes in my past. Slight aroma doesn't give anything away as to the fullness of the mouth-feel & tastes. At 4.8 ABV it could be called a session beer by some, but I'd reserve that for beers of a lighter body. At the risk of sounding petty I'll say this is a great summer evening or night brew, but starting a session in the afternoon with this candidate may be costly. I will be looking out for it again this summer.","seedyone","Aug 12, 2014"

3.83,6.1,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"d- good, this is a nice refreshing summer drinker, i got a case of this without tasting it, and didn't regret it. i heard they are making this a year round, i would pick this up again.","thecarster1","Sep 07, 2010"
2.98,-17.5,4,3.5,2.5,3,3,"Overall this beer is thrown off by the buttey flavor. It seems to have some potential, but it isn't quite there yet.","Hojaminbag","Sep 05, 2010"
3.88,7.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,"D- I liked it, I would drink a sixer in no time and with the luck I've been having lately I may up that to a 24 pack in one of those funny hats that you sip from a straw out of two beer cans parched on the hat, homer simpson style.","BARFLYB","Sep 02, 2010"
4.29,18.8,3,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"D: LBC's Kölsch makes it easy to realize the importance of drinking seasonally. I've bought 2 cases to drink throughout the summer's hottest days, which is the only way this brew should be enjoyed.","FeDUBBELFIST","Aug 28, 2010"
3.95,9.4,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Bright yellow in color with a light haze. A thin white head after the pour that leaves a nice white cap and wet lacings on the glass. Light, fresh floral aroma with hints of lemon and biscuit. Light bodied with lower than average carbonation. Light malt biscuit flavors in the beginning, followed by citrus lemon and orange hop flavor and very crisp finish with a bitter aftertaste.","IronLover","Aug 19, 2010"
3.88,7.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Overall: probably the best beer that Lancaster makes. I do like the sho-fly porter alot but this is much more enjoyable especially since I can get this locally.","Kolsch","Beers"
3.8,5.3,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"I enjoyed this offering. It's got a bit more going on than a traditional German Kölsch, but I appreciated the nuanced flavor in a light beer. The finish needs some work, though.","dasenebler","0"

3.28,-9.1,4,3.5,3,3,3.5,"A Kolsch? I'm not so sure I would have guessed this one by style had I tried it blind. Maybe an American Wheat Ale.","DarkerTheBetter","Aug 09, 2010"
4,10.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Color is a bit darker than I would expect it to be, but still a light gold, completely clear and with mild carbonation. Head is also a bit smaller and lacing is again a bit lacking. Aroma is clean, subtle and a bit floral. Some very delicate grassiness comes through in the finish. Body is moderate and appropriately so.","allboutbierge","Aug 08, 2010"
3.75,3.9,3,3,4,3.5,4.5,"D: A very drinkable beer in the summertime. I actually bought this especially because I was getting overloaded on too many pale ale and IPAs with the heat & high humidity. This beer really does the trick, compliments food well, and doesn't get you overly hammered at one sitting. A great beer to enjoy with some full flavor.","jwhancher","Jul 28, 2010"
3.65,1.1,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"D - somewhat easy to drink, really wish it had an extra spark or two of carbonation.- all around solid nonetheless.","Stigs","Jul 23, 2010"
3.48,-3.6,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"D -A tasty Ale which is masquerading as a kolsch, but really tastes like a German Pils with the malt very low in the flavor and yeast hidden. I think it is a tasty beer, just misses the mark for Kolsch slighly.","Slatetank","Jul 20, 2010"
3.35,-7.2,3.5,3.5,3,4,3.5,"d: I was really excited to try this, so I feel a bit let down. I haven't tried many kolsches, but I remember liking other examples a more. Still, the price is right and these aren't bad. I wouldn't rule out a case purchase in the future.","DIM","Jul 18, 2010"
3.95,9.4,4,4,4,3.5,4,"D: Perfect beer for the summer, Lancaster has definitely created a beauty here. And it comes in a can! Crisp, clean and refreshing like the can claims. That's really all that needs to be said.","kiddynamite920","Jul 10, 2010"
4.1,13.6,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Would I buy more of it? - absolutely. I could throw a 12-pack of this on ice and be set for a weekend. This may be the only beer these guys put in cans but they sure as hell did a great job with this one.","indiapaleale","Jul 10, 2010"
3.75,3.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,"Had a can for $4 at Tap and Table in Emmaus. It was a slightly hazy golden beer with a short head. This wasn't a perfect kolsch, but it was plenty tasty and went nicely with the Fromager d'Affinois. There's a crisp herbal citrus hop bite followed by a smooth berry fruit character. It's a good summer beer, check it out.","tempest","Jul 08, 2010"
3.5,-3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured from a 12 oz, can. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smells of malts, a bit on the sweet side. Taste is crisp, a touch sweet, good malt and hops balance, finishing a tad bitter. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a good quality beer.","tone77","Jul 07, 2010"
3.75,3.9,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"The mouthfeel is on the lighter side overall, but feels a little heavier then others in the style. Carbonation is above average. Drinkability is pretty good, it went down pretty easy on this hot day. it had some nice clean and crisp flavors and was pretty easy drinking overall.","billab914","Jul 03, 2010"
3.97,10,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Nice suprise seeing a new seasonal from LBC. And in cans!! At $22 a case, I couldn't resist. Can says Wilkes Barre, PA so I'm guessing this is another contract brew from The Lion. Poured a hazy straw color with 2 fingers head. A bit of lace sticks on the glass as the head recedes. The smell reminds me of a barn full of hay. Palate is nicely balanced with cracker malts and grassy german hops. Also notice a hint of lemon zest in there. Mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing with a nice body that coats the mouth and lingers a bit. Great brew for the summer months and a great example of the style.","JunkYardJake","Jul 02, 2010"
4.15,15,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Nice surprise to see a Lancaster beer in the almighty can. This one pours a brilliant golden straw color with a big frothing bright eggshell white head. Fine speckled lacing coats the sides of my Hennepin chalice. Aroma has citrus lemon grass noted earthy fresh cut grass amongst a nice pale bready/cracker malt backbone. A nice balanced malty/hop mix going on, lays on some semi sweet biscuit malt presence with a lemon rind grassy earthy finish that really makes the beer crisper than most American brewed Kolsch. Great dryness in the finish, flavorful session beer this is great stuff the kind of light beer that you can sink you teeth into. Carbonation is on from the can sometimes I've seen carbonation issues that's not the case here good stuff. I'm glad I bought a case at just over 20 bucks in the Burgh to bring in the fourth this weekend.","WVbeergeek","Jun 29, 2010"
4.35,20.5,4,4,4.5,3.5,5,"D- oh hells yes this is drinkable! Low ABV, nice tasting, plus, its sold in cans so you can bring it on the beach with you. Total summer beer, and one of the better ones I've had. Kudos to LBC for churning this one out...much better than the Rare Rooster I'm used to from them in the summer.","bigfnjoe","Jun 27, 2010"
4.92,36.3,4.5,5,5,4.5,5,"It's about time Lancaster started moving in the right direction with new management and better beer quality. I can't wait to see what Bill Moore & Company have up their sleeves for the fall !","DocBrewroo","Jun 23, 2010"
3.98,10.2,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"In general, this verion is much more flavorful than most Kolsches I've tried but far from too heavy for the warmest of days. I'm very interested in trying it in the can and took a 12pack home. All in all an extremely good beer. I really enjoyed this one.","BeerIsland","Jun 22, 2010"
4.01,11.1,4,3,4,4.5,5,"Drinkability: super sessionable beer. This is a great beer for a hot and humid summer day in the northeast.","Gavage","Jun 15, 2010"
3.92,8.6,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"My pour produced just over a finger's worth of rocky bone-white head that fell like the raindrops outside my window on this hot, humid summer afternoon. Color was a hazy golden-yellow, darker than the straw mentioned on the CAN. I definitely smelled grassy hops on the nose, almost peppery in their intensity. Mouthfeel was medium with a dry, lager-like crispness on the tongue. The finish had the same hoppiness but accompanied by a light honey-like flavor. I am impressed by their first CANned offering and look forward to other of their beers in a CAN in the future. This would certainly go into my cooler and if others need help in getting some, just drop me a Beer Mail.","woodychandler","Beers"
