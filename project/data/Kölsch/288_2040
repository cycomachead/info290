It is so refreshing and drinkable, I could swirl it inside my mouth forever. I could have like ten of these on a hot summer day. Too bad I only bought one. Will get again!","Gajo74","Mar 24, 2015"

I couldnt imagine something else combining the refreshing qualities with full flavor like a good koelsch, and this one does it very well.

Nose has a good sour bite from the yeast up first then a clean and mildly fruity smell. Apples and some faint spice. Pale malt with a honey sweetness. Light grain. Earthy. Taste is perfection. Refreshing with the apple as it comes over the palate fruity and sweet with plenty of smooth bread underneath. A touch of floral and even a little mint. The body is feather light and smooth. It 's supple and rich. There is a deep earthy quality to the malt that I find spectacular in it's straightforward simplicity. It's dry overall and leaves with a touch of pine and a small bitter. There's no lingering aftertaste except for the taste of minerals. It's superbly clean. Very refreshing and a stellar example of the style.","utopiajane","Jun 22, 2013"

Aromas of lemon, pear, apple, pepper, floral, grass, cracker, bready grain, and floral earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and strength of malt, hop, and light yeast ester notes; very clean. Taste of lemon, pear, apple, floral, pepper, grass, cracker, bready grain, and floral earthiness. Lingering notes of light fruits, floral, grass, light pepper, bread, and light earthiness on the finish for a bit. Great flavor balance of malt, hop, and light fruitiness; with an extremely clean flavor profile and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and crisp mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent Kolsch!

Wheat flavors, light malt, hops, sweetness and light bready flavors with a hoppy, dry finish. A bit of a skunky flavor at the end, but it fits with the overall flavor. Refreshing. This is a reminder of the tragedy of our adjunct beers and that a brewery can make a light, low ABV beer that is flavorful and a pleasure to drink.","LiquidAmber","Aug 02, 2012"

Super clean great drinking session German ale, I could picture myself sitting in a Koln bierhall drinking from a kolsch glass being served by a kolbe for the better portion of a sunny afternoon. It's nice when just tasting a beer can give you that experience in your mind. Flavor is very much built around pale cereal grains and light herbal hops with a touch of fruitiness from the ale yeast strain. This is what most American brewers attempt when formulatnig an American Blonde ale, few succeed the way this beer does. Mouthfeel is clean crisp light bodied effervescent carbonation.

It would also drink well with a vegetable frittata, or shellfish. It is a great substitute for Riesling or Gewurztraminer in any kind of food pairing.

Very fresh and open nose, sliced white bread, golden wheat, green corn husk, orange infused spring water, while on the hops side of things there's nothing bitter nor biting about the nose, just a gentle unfolding of ""beer"" inside your nostrils. Medium-bodied, with feeling carbonated it swells inside the mouth and takes up as much space as possible, just not pushing down into the tongue. Moderately sweeter with elements of pink grapefruit, orange citrus and pineapple, nectarine, peach fruit. None of which dramatically change the overall dry and crisp character of the beer for here the hops are indeed bitterer and add a nice vibrancy to the mouthfeel. There's a toasted, powdery quality to the malts like sticking a wet finger into malted milk powder.

Taste is bursting with that same yummy malt that dances nicely with the noble hops. Medium mouthfeel also has a ""mineraly"" feel to it that leaves a semi-dry finish but the malt and hops still linger long enough for me to savor these wonderful flavors. Hop bitterness is also medium which put everything together spells balance. Right were a kolsch should be.

Very light-bodied with a crisp, spritzy mouthfeel. It's lightness and relatively low alcohol content makes this a beer you spend an entire afternoon with -- the hotter the day, the better.

The nose can best be described as fresh and certainly malty. The mouthfeel is crisp and clear cut, a refreshing edge. There is a big juicy malt taste that gives you just enough of a grainy side to improve the texture. The finish brings a little more balance with just enough hop bitterness (that was lacking in the body) to please the palate.

Flavor is nice, dry as baking powder biscuits before the butter, cracker-like and featuring cutting hop aridity. If the hops were more pointedly sharp, this brew would be almost Pilsner-like.

It pours a nice brilliant yellow color with slight golden hues, and a nice billowing 3 finger head that seens to want to stay around. The nose is nicely balanced between some noble German hops (saaz or hallertau, not sure which) and a clean sweet malt, slightly honey-like, but not overwhelming. The flavor is not bad either. There is a slight sweetness that quickly moves to a grainey, but not harsh, flavor. The hop is light on the finsih, but it is fitting with the rest of the beer. This one is nice and refreshing, with a moderate body and lively carbonation. Overall, a very fine beer.

I would like to know what hops are used in Kolsch to use in a homebrew. The mouthfeel is a little off-balance. There is a medicine aftertaste accompanied by a dry, rough finish.

The nose is fresh, crisp, clean with nice malt sweetness, and the start quite sweet with a pleasant malt profile, the top is prototypical in its light feel to the palate.

It had a slightly floral finish, but was also slightly sour. Light body and high carbonation. Overall, I think I may have an old bottle. I have had this before from the tap and when it was fresher it was quite good.

The light golden color was exactly what I thought a great kolsch should be. The pour was excellent, started with a good 1 - 1-1/4 inch head that quickly went away leaving the perfect white froth on top. The slightly fruity and very slighty spicy aroma left alot to be desired, this was probably the only let down in the bottle. The slight hop bite at the tip of the tongue followed by a smooth finish that can only be called refreshing just screamed kolsch to me. Behind alt this is my favorite German style.

Although some malty flavor comes through with just enough hops to be detectable, nothing distinguishes it as an outstanding-or really even better than average-beer.

The nose is lightly malty (with very light fruitiness) lacks in potency and depth, it did improve as it warmed. Mediocre, at best. Shockingly malty palate, tremendously tasty! Slight graininess, caramel hints too the hops bitterness is very mild with some grassy flavors added distant whispers of sweet vanilla. Somewhat dry. Minimal malty aftertaste. Damn good. Medium-body, mild carbonation, pleasant mouthfeel. Very drinkable lovely. This completely changes the way I look at Kölsch beers, for the better. Recommended.","bditty187","Sep 01, 2003"
4,3.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Completely clear with light golden straw color. A substantial fine, white head with minimal lacing but a bit of persistent carbonation. Smell is more pleasant and strong than expected in a beer that looks so light. Crisp grains rule the day with some breadiness and a dash of spice. Grainy taste that doesn't vary a great deal from start to finish, though the latter gets dires a bit. A hint of fruit is present too, though I can't pin it down. Eminently soft mouthfeel with a little crispness to make it interesting.","BitteBier","Aug 31, 2003"
4.1,5.9,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Lightly fruity aroma is slammed by a more basic, grain-like nose. All malt and fruit in the flavor. Sweet hints of apples, peaches, and perhaps wet wood. As it warms, the flavor shifts towards the finish, which is grassy and herbal tea-like. Dry. Understated hop bitterness. A little on the thin side of medium-bodied. God-friggin-damn drinkable.","marburg","Aug 27, 2003"
3.91,1,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"A crystal clear golden body topped by a rather thin white head that creates moderate lacing. The nose is mostly malt with hints of fruit that portray a lightness that really isn't isn't present in the taste. This is a very nice Kolsch that imparts lovely crispness in the finish. I found this to be a thoroughly refreshing late summer beer with good feel and drinkability.","AtLagerHeads","Aug 23, 2003"
3.06,-20.9,3.5,2.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Flavor is initially malty, with hops appearing about halfway through the sip and finishing the beer crisp and clean. Almost no aftertaste, save a touch of pale malt. Well carbonated and refreshing. Kolsch is a wonderful style, when it's done correctly...","UnionMade","Aug 14, 2003"
4.1,5.9,4,4,4,4,4.5,"This is what the Kolsch style should taste like. On draught, this pours a light golden straw with a frothy, white head that leaves rings of lace down the glass. Although it does need occasional agitation, the head sticks around for the duration of the brew. Aroma is a pleasant blend of almost spicy, relatively bitter hops and a fresh, yeasty profile as well. This is a flavorful brew, with a sweetish, full malt character that melds well with the predominantly bitter, but overall mild German hops. Oddly enough, notes of oak/wood seem present, as well. The mouthfeel is quite smooth with mild carbonation. As the brew warms up a bit, it becomes almost syrupy, but in a good way. Incredibly drinkable, this would be an excellent summer thirst quencher -- all that a Kolsch should be! Definitely worth a try, especially if you can locate it on draught.","Jon","Aug 09, 2003"
3.5,-9.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"When I think of just a plain old beer, simple yet tasty, this would be it. It poured a nice golden yellow, with a good head. Slightly bitter, but not very.

No, but I will buy it more often than some beers I've given higher reviews...it just so damn drinkable.","Sixpack595","Jul 18, 2003"

The smell was mild: slightly sweet malt and grain. The taste was very malty (slightly sweet) with a hint of hops and biscuit. The mouthfeel was a bit thin (medium-light body) with low carbonation feel, but was smooth. The drinkability was decent: very easy to drink. I found the tap version a bit more tasty.","UncleJimbo","Jun 06, 2003"

And seemingly, some noble hop accents. I like the soft malt tones on the tongue. Pilsner-like maltiness, but not as heavy. Some minor fruitiness is noted. A tanginess from some wheat malt perhaps. And very subtle hop flavor from what I believe is a Hallertau or something similar. Surprisingly big body. At least medium-full. Creamy texture on the tongue allows this one to slide down with ease. Pretty enjoyable, but not the grand experience I was in search of.","Bighuge","May 15, 2003"

2.83,-26.9,3.5,3,3,3,2,"Brilliantly clear, straw golden forming a tenuous white head atop medium-sized bubbles. Retention is just ok, and lacing is sparse. Carbonation is moderate. Aroma is faint with dry, grassy hops, a whiff of sulfur, oolong tea, and (like Putnam notes) milk that is starting to turn sour. Mouthfeel is bright upon the back of the tongue with a thin body. Initially grassy flavors up front with a hint of yeast and straw, unpleasant sulfur and vegetable notes in the middle, followed by a lightly dry, champage-like cedary finish with a light dose of bittering hops and subtle graininess. This brew is akin to a US domestic macrobrew in every way. If I were blinded, I would guess it was an A-B product. There is no real substance or appealing qualities to this beer. Although it is average in every respect, I have no desire to drink one ever again.","Mitchster","Mar 22, 2003"

3.53,-8.8,3.5,3,3.5,4,4,"Pours with a bright white head that settles over clear golden-hued liquid. Gently carbonated. Nose has some sweet malty aromas, with a grassy/hay note. Taste is a clean slightly sticky sweet maltiness, a small amount of fruitiness present too. Hop bitterness makes just a short appearence towards the end...not as much flavor as I was hoping for. Finishes lightly fruity and dry, a nice session beer.","beerluvr","Mar 09, 2003"
3.69,-4.7,4.5,3,3.5,4,4.5,"Brilliant golden hue w/ a well retained white head. Wispy lace remains. Pilsner like clarity. Soft graininess and mildly sweet strawberry like fruitiness in aroma. Trace floral hop nose. Bready pilsner malt sweetness upfront in flavor, followed by mild notes of husk and berryish fruitiness. Mild hop bitterness leaves a pleasant residual sweetness. Light body, w/ a crisp, refreshing mouthfeel. Finishes cleanly sweet and grainy. An innocuous, simple and highly quaffable brew. It possesses pilsner-esque crispness and a restrained, English Bitter like fruitiness. It's the perfect brew to start the evening, since it leaves the palate longing for more. Almost elegant.","marc77","Dec 29, 2002"

Shallow, but attractive white head didn't last long, but left nice lattice.  Smells faintly of hops.  Foretaste is sweet and malty, and the inital perception is that it's got more body than it, in fact, has.  Grainy and grassy and finishes very light.","Suds","Sep 28, 2002"

If I didn't know any better I would say it was a particularly complex, full-flavored lager. The color is bright yellow with mustard and gold tones. The creamy white head resolves quickly into a splotchy, lunar-surface pattern. The nose is remarkable, with aromas of tangy nectarine, cornflakes, shredded wheat and milk that is just starting to turn sour. The flavors reveal custard, designer water and lemon with a slight sprinkle of bitter herb. Bright, clean and seamless. Absolutely gulpable. Sampled with Kolschs Pyramid (Curveball) and Schell (Zommerfest).","putnam","Aug 22, 2002"

Clear, light golden color with full head that settles, unassuming aroma. Clean, grainy taste with big grassy malts and just the right dry hop sparkle. In the bottle this tastes less like a Kolsch and closer to a golden lager or pilsner. Refreshing and very drinkable, yet dry and clean. Does wonders for settling the stomach. I think this is the only true German Kolsch you can get Stateside, and it's a fine representative.","Thrasher","Aug 22, 2002"
