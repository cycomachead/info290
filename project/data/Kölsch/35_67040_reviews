"Taste -soda cracker, pilsner malt, floral notes, faint citrus. Very refreshing and light-bodied. Would make a decent session brew. Subtle and pleasant. Certainly worth a try."

"A very light beer but nothing bad comes to mind and it balances out nicely, no adjunct flavors and it isn't devoid of all flavors."
"Poured a beautiful light gold with a thick finger and 1/2 width of white head. The aroma was a slight floral aroma and a little bit of malt/bread. Hard for me to detect anything else really. Flavor had a slight malt sweetness upfront and a slight hop bitterness with some herbal/floral presence, but neither really stands out. Clean, dry finish."

"Cheers!"
"Not really a good beer. Not bad, but really unexceptional... and hardly a decent example of a kolsch."
""
"O: Very enjoyable brew. I'm not really a fan of their Summer Ale but this def takes over for a great summertime cookout brew of choice. Great job!"
"O: Its a good summer beer I guess, pretty uninteresting and lacking flavor probably accurate representation of style. In the Summer Mix I like Belgian, Noble and Summer better."
""
"Clear golden in color with some amber and orange hues when held up to the light. Tiny fizzy head that quickly disappears. Smells like buttered crackers and straw with a hint of spiciness. Smells better than I just described but that's what I thought of when I whiffed. Heavy malty backbone with lot's of sweet honey, banana flavors and a spicy finish. Creamy mouthfeel. Another good summer beer from Sam Adams."
"O: A bit heavy for a kolsch in my opinion. I like this style, but I don't particularly think this one is the best I've found. Definitely drinkable, but there are better."
""
""
"another of the mix six beers poured from its bottle into a nice clean stange glass. a nice fluffy head (that goes away rather quickly)and a clear golden color.a light and crisp beer . sort of wishing that summer wasn't soon over . i hope it is avaible next year as a six pack."
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability - outstanding take on the style. I vote to make this a seasonal in its own sixer."

"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, East-West is a crisp golden yellow color with a white frothy head that crackles like rice krispies; lots of fine carbonation rises from the depths of the glass. The nose is all malt; grainy and fruity - apricots and pears. The taste reflects the same with a bit of peach showing through on the finish, could be a bit more balanced but not bad. Mouthfeel is medium to full in body with a minimal carbonation. Overall a good beer, worth a try if you can get your hands on some."
""
""
""
""
"O-not compelling, but easily drinkable beer, perfect for a summertime session"
""
"Overall, like I said, this tastes like a light beer to me. Mild in flavor and aroma. I have another one in my twelve-pack, so my taste may change a bit. For now though, I'd just give it an average rating. Good beer and everything, but nothing about it makes me say 'WOW.'"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not bad at all. Typically i like a brew with a little more body and flavor but this was very pleasant."
"Overall: this is not only a surprisingly good Kolsch but a surprisingly good beer from a popular but recently disappointing brewery."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Clear gold color that you can see right through. Fizzy white head that does not disappate too quickly. Nice, clean appearance like a kolsch should have. Little to no lacing on the glass. Biscuity aroma with a touch of spice. Medium bodied and a bit heavy for the style. Dry finish and a bit cloying. A decent offering from Sam Adams but strays too much from the style for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall impression: Enjoyable but seems a bit heavy-handed for a Kolsch. Was surprised at the amount of Noble hop character that was evident in the flavor. Not bad but not sure it's 100% accurate. Happily will enjoy in a pinch."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a good summer beer, having a little depth in the flavor without being overpowering. Crisp and refreshing, nice to not be too heavy in the yeast flavor like many of their other beers. Would certainly have a couple on a hot Friday night to cool off."

"I had it from a variety case, and poured it into a cup. I was surprised by its flavor at first. I never had a kolsch so I had no base to judge it. I find it to be a great beer in the summer time because of its great taste and light feel. I only had one so its hard to be too specific with its characteristics, but i highly suggest it for those who like a good light summer beer with some flavor."
""
""
"O. It has that familiar Sam Adams taste, but this is a bit better than some other offerings. Solid flavor to this one."
""
"Poured into SA sensory glass. Appearance is a slightly hazy pale yellow with generous 2 finger white head. Nice head retention and thick lacing left behind. The nose features fragrant lemony esters with notes of sourdough bread, pretty much right on for the style. Taste is light and refreshing with light fruity notes as well as bready malt notes. A decent amount of flavor is packed into this brew. The mouthfeel is light with high carbonation. Overall, this is a nice addition to the summer sampler pack. One of the better Kolschs I have had."
""
""
"Definite session beer and perfect for the summer, it’s a great American representation of this style as there are not a lot of Kölsch brews in the US. Grab a giant glass boot and pound a few of these."
"O-very well balanced, clean kolsch. Pretty impressed with this coming from sam adams. Very drinkable, would buy it again depending on price"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A little tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, this is a beer worth pounding for a while but there are better alternatives within the style."
"O: This beer is very sessionable and a good representation of the style. It reminds me of some of the Kölsch beers I had when I was in Köln."

""

"a curious experiment in the summer pack thats made the cut for the summer 12er again. pours a bronzed color with a lacey white head, clear as day with lots of bubbles rising to the surface. smells a bit floral, jasmine or something. also some yeasty spice and fresh bread notes, much more aromatics that i am used to in a kolsch. flavor is equally obscure, some flowery essences on the front end with a lot of interesting spice in the middle, maybe some cardomom and orange rind. mouthfeel is the letdown for me. this has too much body for the style, which was orignially brewed to be an easy drinker (correct me if im wrong here). not to say its heavy, just that it isnt light. carbonation is fine but goes almost dead as it warms. overall not my favorite from the summer pack, but its a nice attempt at something different."

"D/O Very very drinkable and overall this is an average Kolsch, a style that I do not find particularly to my liking. 3.0"
""
"This is a pretty great Kölsch-style beer. I don't usually drink 'em, but this might've changed my mind if it came in 6-packs instead of buried in the Summer Seasonals."
""
"Pours a moderately dark sunny gold. A small cap of white foam rests atop. Sweet floral nose - cut flowers, malt, citrus zip. Cool, crisp mouthfeel. Bubbles add a refreshing wash on the palate. The added flower-characteristic to this beer is notable in the flavor. Definitive herbal notes, but they are delicate and add a nice adjustment to the profile. Biscuity malt and a fresh finish of lemon. Mild bitterness make this one an easy beer to down on a warm afternoon. Nice work, BBC."
""
""
""
"O - This is a very good summer session beer and actually a great example of a Kolsch. It’s well-balanced between the malts and hops and has a crisp, refreshing finish. Very tasty and drinkable. Nice beer from Sam Adams."
""
""
""
""
"What a damn fine beer from SA, and definitely up there with Double Pumpkin."
""
""
""
"Overall I thought that this was a good beer that I was a little impressed with and I thought that it was a good and proper example of the style, it had all the things that I look for in this style with nothing that seemed off. This beer had great drinkability, it was very smooth, clean, and with just enough flavor to hold my attention, three or four of these on a hot summer day would be very nice, drinkable as hell. What I liked most about this beer was that it was good all around, simple, tasty, and clean. What I liked least about this beer was that it's only available in this mixed pack. if any of the beers in this mix pack are six pack worthy it is for sure this one. I would buy this beer on it's own, but for now I have to get the summer variety pack to get it, I recommend this to anyone looking for an easy drinking summertime beer. I have to say that I am impressed with this beer, I came into this expecting and average Kolsch and what I got was an above average Kolsch that is up there with some of the best I have tried of that style, but I think I like Short's Kolsch 45 a little more, but since this will be available all summer chances are I will be drinking more of this. Good job guys, you made one simple, clean, and very drinkable Kolsch, I like it."

"O – I started out thinking this was a little weak, but as it warmed I found myself finding some hidden depths and enjoying it a lot more. Cant say I’m a huge fan of this style, but this was a decent enough little beer."

"O: This beer is very easy to drink and could easily be sessionable. I enjoyed the flavors of this beer but it is not a classic example of the style (maybe I was spoiled drinking these while over in Germany)."
""
""
"Pours a golden straw color, full white bubbly head, little retention. Scent leads with some notes of must grain and corn, light citrus hops, grassy, faint sweetness. Disjointed scent leads to disjointed taste. Body fuller and slicker than most others in the style. Confused as to the goal of this rather than another lighter beer, lacks much in comparison to the true style."
""
""
"This is a well balanced, mild kolsch. It doesn't make any mistakes - the aroma, taste, aftertaste are all appropriate - but it doesn't excite. I would not turn one of these down but I also would not seek one out or consider it a prime example of the style."

"O= pretty much average. Nowhere near a real Kölsch or even any of the US-clone Kölsches."
"The mouthfeel is, like the appearance, pretty dead-on for the style. It's light and crisp and thin. Refreshing. Overall, I just wish that the beer were brighter. As it is, I'd rather drink Alpine Spring."

"poured out a clear golden beer with a 1 finger head.Highly carbonated.Has a grassy smell reminicent of some better macros.Taste is very light,lager taste, some mild hops,very well balanced.Mouthfeel is plain nothing fancy.Overall a pretty decent session beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"VERY GOOD, ENJOY!"
""
"Overall – Some interesting taste combinations make this a brew to try. It is easy to drink and refreshing."
""
""
"Overall-Good selection for summer, with that sam adams would have more of this instead of filling variety packs with Boston Lager that i can get anywhere."
"O: Some nice flavors in this beer. It is very well crafted to bring out just the right amount of sweetness and fruit."
"Overall: Great beer to have after a burger which is what I just did, It isn't too hard to drink and it is quite tasty. Salud!"
""
""
"Nice little beer!"
"Clear urine color with descent head. Fairly weak retention and some lacing. Citrus and floral aroma. Flavor is well balanced and mildly malty. Hint of honey sweetness balanced by citric hop bitterness. Light bodied with aggressive carbonation. Crisp finish. Refreshing and complex for the style."
""
""
"Overall I enjoyed this beer. It is moderately strong with a solid taste and nice aroma."
""
""
""
"Overall not a bad beer. Certainly above average and worth checking out. Not mind blowing, however."
""
""
"O: Honestly, this is the beer I look forward to in the summer. If BBC released this year-round in a six-pack, it'd be all I'd ever drink. It has all the great kolsch flavors I love, but the added jasmine launches this one into the stratosphere."
"I give it a 4 out of 5."
""
"Overall - This is actually a pretty good beer. I enjoyed it."

"Maybe it's the style, maybe it's the beer. Either way I have a tough time liking it."
""
"D- Great summer beer, the 5.0% ABV makes it a session candidate and one that everyone would be a fan of."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass. Pours a clear yellow straw color, with a half inch of white head, that leaves some nice lace. Smell is clove, grass, biscuit, and some coriander. Taste is crisp and clean, with clove and biscuit in the start and coriander in the finish. Body is light, nice amount of life, lush not dry, and so drinkable. This was a great choice for the summer mix pack. It is the best Summer mix they have put together, starting with the Noble Pilsner."
""
""
""
""
""
"They should make this their summer beer over Summer Ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- The East-West Kolsch is a decent beer. Not too much for the aroma and taste. About average for the style. Could have definitely used more flavor, seemed like it was slightly watered down. Easily drinkable and sessionable."

"The taste is different. The combination of jasmine and the hops makes for an interesting flavor which seems to complement nicely. There is a bit of a citrus note with slight bitterness. Mouthfeel is good, slight oily feeling on the tongue. Drinkability is very good. Overall I was very pleased with this one."
""
""
"This came out of the summer sampler and was by far the best of the bunch. Would rather have this as their summer seasonal than their summer brew. Nice white head on the pour, smell is biscuity and fruit with some spice. Flavor is somewhat hoppy and sweet. Nice and refreshing; could drink a few of these."
""
""
""
"Overall: It's actually not that bad of a kolsch I would recommend this for sure"

"O- Glad this was in the summer pack as I'd not have tried it otherwise. Solid beer, a nice light summer beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I haven't bought a case of a single S.A. brew in a while--but in the summer heat we had this year, I could see quenching a thirst with this kolsch nightly...."

"My pour into another of my Perfect Pint glasses not only produced two rocky fingers of bone-white head with good retention, but it showcased a beautiful beer! It was a bright sunshine-yellow with NE-quality clarity and lots of bubbles like a poor man's lava lamp. Nose had a sweetish cereal-like quality, malty but not cloying, with an underlying perfume-like scent. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium and the taste was unlike any kolsch in my memory. It was semi-dry, which is standard, but it had a perfume-y sweetness that reminded me of herbal tea. Wild! The more I drank this beer, the more the semi-dry sweetness of the malt commingled with the flowery perfuminess of the Jasmine Sambac and I just could not reconcile this as a Kolsch. The finish was semi-dry and refreshing but I just kept thinking of it as more of a summer beer. Not bad, interesting, but should be a summer seasonal."
""
""
""
""
""
"The aroma was rather bright and summer like, with a light grain and herb like fruit note in the nose. A touch of clove and banana highlighted this one and really did a nice job at bringing the whole thing together. The flavor was much of the same. Surprisingly sweet, with a touch of maybe honey or light caramel, hints of apple and light fresh hay. The banana coming though nicely on the finish with a quick, clean, and very crisp cutoff in the overall taste."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is decent fare, though I can't honestly say that I would have known of the Jasmine Sambac addition if it hadn't been pointed out to me on the label. It doesn't help that the floral notes are so delicate that they're easily overpowered by even the moderate grain flavors, and in subsequent mouthfuls are almost entirely subsumed. Still, the flavors in this beer are developed, and the apricot and orange notes are delicious."
"D-Honestly this is one the least enjoyable of the Kolsch that I've had. Feel is way too dry and the hops seem to take over this one."
"O= This isn't a bad Kolsch. Nice and fruity with a good buiscuit taste. The smell could be better but it isn't bad."
"Overall: The body of the beer is light as with the finish. I really enjoy the flavors of this beer, it is light, slightly fruity, and easy to drink ."
"A very interesting take. The eastern influence is very clear in the taste with distinct notes of jasmine tea. This is a very floral beer with tons of honey. This beer's got honey like a bee hive. There's a ton of sweetness that I wish was cut with some bitterness, but there's not really any hops bitterness, just the floral notes. This would be good with some bitter honey. But overall for me it's too sweet, though interesting."
"Overall, surprising complexity led to a satisfactory beer."
"Sammy making a kolsch, nice. Looks pretty with a brilliant golden hue. Head was a little weak even with some encouragement. Smells sweet and grainy. Taste is similarly sweet with a nice crisp finish. Not much of a hop presence. Good if a little underwhelming. A solid beer overall. I wouldn't mind seeing it in six packs."
"I like Kolsch beers, but not a big fan of this one."
"Dry finish, session beer for sure."
"The east west Kolsch pours well, with a good head. It's color is golden amber, nice and clear, but the smell is lacking. The taste is very strait forward beer, in a good way. It's got a decent amount of hop with some toasted malt in it. Afterwards you can still taste the beer sticking to your teeth. This is the kind of beer I can imagine sitting on a porch and drinking in thousand degree summers listening to baseball games. Now, while watching Always Sunny in Philadelphia it works just as well. Very good taste."
"Not approaching the greatness of Summit's Kolsch, but this is a good example. Overall I was fairly impressed with Sam Adams Summer Series. A few winners in there."
"D/O- Refreshing but I feel there are better Kölsch examples out there. Having said that I'd take this over an adjunct any day. Least favorite out of the Summer variety pack."
"Overall: A likable beer, and possibly my first adventure into the style ""Kolsch."""
"Started out as a plain jane but got surprisingly drinkable."
"Light body and soft on the palate. Great summer beer and a great representation for the style. I'm actually impressed with this one."
"O- Great session beer. Could easily kick a few of these back."
"Pours golden yellow with not much of a head. Aroma of wheat, grass, lemon and hints of floral hops. Light sweet and crisp flavor. Lemon grass sweetness. Good tea like floral notes and just a touch of pepper spice to finish. Well crafted flavor, nice session beer."
"O - This is a decent brew, although not on par with what Sam usually serves up. The flavor is good, but the mouthfeel and overall experience for me was just ok. Give it a try though, because it IS a good beer, but maybe not for me."
"I have no idea why this beer is so different from the one I had yesterday. Colder? That all said you don't be impressed by this. You don't fall in love, but on a hot enough day you might be pretty happy to have a glass or 3."
"Doesn't challenge the taste buds, but a good Kolsch really shouldn't. This is light and refreshing, and the subtle flavors that are there are pretty damn good. A good example of the style."
" The color is pale golden, the head is short lived though which lowered it's appearance points. The aroma is indeed Jasmine floral, crisp refreshing, definately a good summer quencher!"
"Overall: Pretty good beer overall. I'm not too familiar with the Kolsch style (this is only my second), but I can tell you that it's not as good as the Reissdorf I had on Monday. I'd say it's still worth trying."
"I've had jasmine rice before and I was expecting that taste and I definitely got it. The sweet wheat like malt really balances out the flowery taste and gives it some sweetness. The sweetness really breaks up the taste and makes for a complex subtle beer. Samuel Adams is really good at making subtle beers that are unique. Not too subtle though because they make some tasty beers... this one being one of them. Excellent summer beer."
"Got this as part of Sam's summer mix case. Pours clear gold with fluffy white head and ample carbonation. Smells bready and wheaty, a little doughy with some faint melon aroma. Tastes sweet and citrus like. A little medium bodied - was expecting something a little crisper and more refreshing. A decent beer and glad I tried it."
"This is a solid summer beer that holds true to the style. What impresses me most is the quality of aroma and flavor in a lighter beer."
"Overall- A well rounded wheat beer. Goes great with grilling and a hot summer evening."
"Appearance is clear golden with a nice 2 finger head. There is a definite spice to the nose, along with some floral scents. The taste is a subtle blend of spice and hop notes, nothing over the top. Has a crisp finish and would make a good session beer."
"Overall – This beer really had a nice well balanced taste. It works well with the summer weather and is very drinkable. I'd buy this one again."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, the beer pours a bright, light, watery golden yellow color. Very vibrant and crisp. A small, low profile white head. Lots of steady, small bubbled carbonation consistent throughout the beer. The nose is toasted oats, and a slight honey character, as well. There are hints of sour in the nose, also. The beer leaves a lacing along the glass while you drink. The flavors are rich and round, with a toasty character that borders on char, but goes great with the sweet honey undertone. The beer is only slightly hopped, but enough to keep it very crisp. The aftertaste is a tangy sweet, with a slick feeling to it. The finish remains slick, and watery, too, leaving a slight linger of sweet and spice. Not bad, overall. Great on a scorching summer day."
"This beer pours a clear golden color with a finger of foamy white head that dissipated quickly but did leave some lacing on the way down. The aroma has notes of bready malt, floral and sweet honey notes. The taste starts sweet with honey, then has some bready flavors from the malt and finishes with the floral notes of jasmine mostly. The mouthfeel is a little cloying for my taste. Overall a pretty good kolsch."
"D: A refreshing & pleasant drinking brew. Nicely different and characterful without straying too far from the style. People will either like the herbal touch or not. I find it quite alright and near perfect for some summer variety."
"This beer really grew on me. I just loved the clean taste to it. Perfect for the summer."
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle. Has a rich golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell has some mild hops, not over powering, a tad bit of malts.Taste is refreshing, hops, some biscuty flavors. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a good, easy drinking summer beer."
"Dr: A simple but very effective and carefully built beer. This is one to enjoy on a patio over good conversation in the summertime. Bravo."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a pilsner malt scent along with some fruity yeast esters. It's light and refreshing. The taste is decent as well. It has a smooth, pilsner/pale malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes dry with some fruity yeast notes. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an above average beer, but nothing too great."
"This is a medium to light bodied brew, maybe leaning more towards medium for the style than lighter. It is modestly carbonated and lively on the tongue. Fairly easy drinking but not the best example of a kolsch I have had. Worth a try once but not something I would repeatedly go for. After writing this review, I looked back at the bottle to see what the explanation was for the labeling of East-West. I was expecting to read something about the berlin wall... no dice."
"A highly sessionable brew - as would be expected of the style. A tremendously drinkable, crowd pleasing brew."
"Perfect to drink with summer time light fair. Seafood, salads."
"Pours a clear golden yellow with a small 1/2 inch foamy off-white head that fades to a thin film. Small rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grains, flowers, and spicy herbal hops. Taste is of sweet grain, floral notes, and a slightly spicy citrus zest hop flavor on the finish. Very mild bitterness lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good kolsch with a nice flavor from the jasmine sambac flowers that were added to the beer."
"This one probably represents the style to the best of Boston Beer’s ability. I personally don’t prefer the Kölsch style and probably shouldn’t have reviewed it. Goes good with pizza! This one was better than their attempt at a Saison (for what it’s worth)."
"Overall: I enjoyed every drop of this brew. Very interesting and complex flavor. Seems like a true and quality representation of the kolsch style. Would like to have many times in the future."
"Had a pint at the Batdorf in Anville, PA. It's does have sort of the sulfur-y, mineral character of a good kolsch, but the overall character is just too light. There's nothing technically wrong with it aside from being muted. That said, it was still a fine beer for a hot summer day."
"The only other Kolsch I've reviewed thus far is the Reissdorf Kolsch which I view as much better."
"O - an excellent beer to enjoy out on the patio in the summer."
"Poured a slightly hazy gold with a thin, creamy white head. Aromas of bready sweet malt, crackers, and herbal, minty hops. Taste follows the nose pretty closely, there's a nice toasted quality that lingers for a bit. Light-bodied with crisp carbonation. A solidly sessionable Kolsch, very nice for a hot day."
"Overall: Another great beer for the summer. I'm thinking this 12 pack is worth buying every summer. Definitely easy drinking, and very enjoyable."
"Morey’s Bottom Line: If they made this available in sixers, I’d grab one every summer."
"Pale gold in color with a thin head and little lacing. Not a lot on the nose. Yeast and malt. Taste is very light. Dry yeasty malt with maybe a note of peach. I get a tiny bit of hop bitterness on the finish. Very light, quenching, and drinkable. Refreshing and sessionable."
"Overall: A good version of a Kolsch from Sam that is very easy drinking. Could of got a little more from the hops."
"O- I would recommend trying this beer. I am coming around to the style, although this beer is slightly different than the average Kolsch. Overall - medlium."
" Overall maybe just not my thing.I have to try some more of this style."
"Drink one and you will likely have another. Lower abv than many Kolsch beers make this a good choice for a barbeque or picnic. I think this would be a good introduction to craft beer enjoyment."
"By itself, completely underwhelming, but with spicy food, it was a very complimentary beer."
"O - Came in the sampler, wasn't expecting much. Actually, not a bad beer, the best one in the pack I think."
"Overall is is a decent beer. It is very drinkable beer, and I could see my friends who are not into craft beer liking it."
"Serving type: bottle from the Summer Styles 12 pack."
"Wow! I'm truly surprised. Sam Adams made a beer that is delicious, refreshing, sessionable, and true to style."
"Thanks BMiller"
"O - Overall, this is quite the session beer, but I had wished for more from the Alsation hops. Still, it's a very drinkable summer brew and the use of the jasmine flower is very subtle and delicately done. Probably the most refreshing beer in the summer variety pack thus far, and great for the heat wave we have had recently."
"Drinkability is awesome. A very refreshing beer, but with a really nice taste. I could drink this beer all weekend long. If you can get your hands on this, drink it down."
"12 oz bottle from a variety pack. Pours clear golden with a thick, white, lasting head and slight carbonation. Grassy hops aroma with slight malty notes in the background. Herbal hops flavor dominate over biscuit malt, almost medicine bitterness, some hints of lemon fruit. Light to medium, smooth body. Long, very dry finish. I think SA overdid it with all that flower additions."
"Future outlook: A better than average ""summer session-esque"" beer....wouldn't pour it down the drain if another one were to magically appear in my fridge."
"Overall is ok. It's not bad and easy to drink. It's just boring. This style is just boring. I'm in a search to find a kolsch that's a step above others. I think many people agree as I've seen an avg low rating for many beers in the style."
"I found it more enjoyable while it was a bit chilled rather than when it started to warm. Overall is was good and very refreshing but nothing special."
"Overall-a style I’ve grown to love, this version is just ok. I had hoped for more. I continue to believe that due to the nature and lightness of the style Kolsch only truly shines in fresh draft form. This version is ok as an introduction to the style, but nothing more."
"Overall this was an absolutely fantastic beer for a hot and humid Miami day. I wish I could drink this stuff every day."
"O - While the flavor and aroma of this beer were not exceptional, they were more than respectable. They combine with the appearance and texture to make a very enjoyable (dare I say very ""drinkable""?) beer"
"Poured into a pint glass this brew has a bright golden straw color with a full frothy 2 finger white head that settles to a 1 finger cap. The aroma is strong of citrus and pine along with slight malt tones. The flavor is a fresh punch with good lemon zing and a nice light bitter finish. Could use a little more malt to balance the front of the brew but I was surprisingly delighted with the overall complexity of this brew. Nice carbonation makes all the flavors pop. Didn't know this was in my summer sampler, but was good enough to make me want to go find a 12 pack of it."
"O: really think this is a great representation of the style, really happy sam adams gave it a solid shot"
"o - Overall a pretty average beer from Sam Adams. Not my favorite from them, but not offensive. Wouldn't seek it out again."
"O: 1st time with a Kolsch, and pretty impressed. A great Sunday throw down brew"
"O: First time with a Kolsch, and pretty well pleased. Would love to have this again. Have only seen this as part of the Summer Sampler-- hope to see it as its own 6-pack soon."
"O- A great summertime beer. Complex enough to think about yet very subtle as well allowing you to just sit back and drink it."
"O: This is a beer that I will drink again"
"Well some things I kinda liked about this beer but not enough to buy it over any other beer of this style or even similar styles."
"Crystal clear light golden body. Moderate amounts of carbonation are noted streaming through the body. A nice creamy white head leaves some nice lace as well. Aroma is qutie light, even for a kolsch. Light malts. Dusty malt flavor with some lightly rustic hop accents. Not a lot going on here, even for a kolsch. Light medium body with moderate carbonation. Not bad but not that great either."
"D- hands down the gem out of this sam adams summer variety pack, i would love to see this one alone in sixers. far as my memory serves me, this may be the best american kolsch i've had to date. floral hops that i usually associate with the style are replaced here by spicier, grassier, lemonier alt spalt somethings and that tamed floral edge is instead provided by actual florals.. i like it. lower the abv a half of a percent and this would be a hum-dinger."
"O-This is a style I have come to enjoy and I have yet to find anyone close to Summit's Unchained Kolsch of last summer. This one just lacks a malt dimension I look for. Not saying it needs to be heavy handed on the malt side of things but I want a soft delicate malt flavor to be detectable and this doesn't have that. It is ok but not what I was hoping for."
"Poured this Kolsch from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. This ale poured a nice clear straw/golden color. It produced a nice thick white creamy head. Very nice lacing left on the glass. The aroma of this beer had soft suggestions of grain, malt and had a nice floral hop smell. The taste of this beer was very refreshing, great mouthfeel and light in body. Perfect summer beer for someone looking for a nice alternative to American Lager. Nice malt base, some spiciness that quite can't put my finger on. The finish has traces of floral hops and it finish's dry- encouraging me to follow up with another gulp. As far as the Kolsch style goes- this gets top marks. Another very good beer from Sam Adams."
"Overall - not a bad brew at all, but maybe not my top pick for Kölsch beers. Still, not bad tasting, and interesting in their interpretation."
"This beer pours out as a nice clear yellow color, the head looks good, not much lacing. The smell is sweet has a light floral aroma and some honey on the nose. The taste of the beer is sweet also with just a touch of hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is light and lightly carbonated. Overall it's a pretty good Kölsch style. Rather enjoyable for the summer season."
"O - Not anything outstanding, but a curious style that works well in the summer."
"O- It's not special, but not totally forgettable. I'll drink it again and I have no qualms quaffing this on a hot day."
"O - An impressive offering from Boston Beer Company. Flavorful, sessionable, and very drinkable."
"O: A real let down from Sam Adams. I was hoping for a nice, enjoyable glass of Kolsch and that's not what I got."
"D- An enjoyable beer on a hot evening. Jasmine flavor is a bit heavy, but it is enjoyable."
"Pours out to a golden body with some good retention, fine lacing and good carbonation. It has a flowery, slightly grainy aroma to it. The taste has a sweet fruity taste to it (apples and grapes), along with a floral taste and a slight hops taste at the end. It does have some balance to it, but overall it has a sweet taste to it. The mouthfeel is a little watery and light bodied which is not bad for a summer beer. Overall a pretty good beer to enjoy on these hot summer days."
"Crystal clear golden beer...fluffy white head that is relatively short-lived. This beer is a great summer brew. Mildly grainy aroma. Slight pilsner-like very pale malt aroma...some fruit (apple), a bit of yeast and sulpher, but not much hop aroma. Clean and flavorful taste. Very good balance...sweetish malt in the front, slightly dry in the finish. Very clean and refreshing."
"O: Too much jasmine too little kolsch. I like out of the box beers but this one over did it on the spice. Good idea bad execution."
"A nice attempt, but whatever the brewer added to the steep is not in the norm, which is not always bad, but this adds nothing to an already wonderful style."
"I wasn't sure what to expect from this beer. The color was rich and golden. The smell was nothing fancy. The taste however is really smooth at first but at the end there is a parade of complexities. There is a richness that comes through at the end, that is pretty nice. It's hard to pinpoint the flavor, but I like it. It's a very drinkable beer with a hearty finish."
"Wow this is the worst Kolsch I've had to date. Tastes nothing like it but an appeal to keep adjunct lager drinkers perhaps un-challenged without upseting them. Pass."
"Overall I have never had the ""Savor Flowers"" but this seems to be a cheaper version in the same vain having just enough sweet flavors to make it interesting. I also have the Saison and can't wait to try it."
"O- This beer sound very nice on the bottle but it didn't come through that way in the glass. It was a bit to sweet to make it crisp and refreshing and too light to make it interesting enough to want another glass."
"Honestly, this is one of the most bland beers I think I’ve ever had. I’m sorely disappointed. I think Sam Adams needs to take note from my kolsch brewing skills. Just let me know, Sam Adams, and I’ll see if I can find that brewkit recipe card for you."
"D: Overall it's a nice beer and a pretty decent kolsch, nice mix of flavors and feel with a decent abv. Very drinkable, very nice take on the style."
"Not bad, but not amazing. I wouldn't turn down a bottle if offered, but this is something I wouldn't seek out."
"Overall this is a major miss for me and even on a nice hot night, was a drain pour because the flavor profile just didn't mesh for me."
"Served in a pint glass. This beer had a nice golden lager appearance with a nice fluffy head for a while. Not much smell going on here, just standard malty scent. Mouthfeel was above average, nothing offensive. Taste was dry and not much bitter. No one taste aspect really stood out as this beer was sharp/dry tasting and really just ""beer-y."" This beer was very smooth and one I would call a good summer beer."
"Pretty pedestrian, and I'll pass on this next time."
"Seriously not much better then any standard basic beer at a local restaurant."
"Overall, decent for a mass-produced version. Touches but doesn't accomplish everything, but far from a disappointment. I dug it."
"O-A quality entry into the style by Samuel Adams. This was part of the Summer Mix and worth the purchase."
"Poured a clear sparkling pale yellow with a large foamy head that had fair retention and fair lacing. The aroma was extremely light of grain malts, a flowery hop and a moldy yeast with a mild citrus note. It tasted very, very, light and airy with a hint of citrus in the beginning and finished a bit sour with a very light hoppy finish. Mouthfeel was very light in body and quite watery in texture with a lively carbonation. Overall a real disappointment for a Kölsch. The brew master in my opinion really dropped the ball on this one."
"Overall, it's not as though I think this is terrible--I'd certainly drink it over many Big Brews. If it was lighter, it might be refreshing, but it isn't light. It's just not something that I would choose to drink over other Sam products."
"Really surprised by this one. I thought the flowers would overpower or it would be overhopped, instead this is very balanced, light and tasty."
"This is the first of the two new brews featured in the Summer Styles variety pack, and it hit the spot for sure. Last years summer sampler was almost perfect however its becoming harder and harder to find SA Pale Ale. I don't know if SA wants to stay traditional but there has to be more refreshing, light styles that have a little more hops than usual. There's no reason why Pale Ale can't be brewed all year, it beats Cherry Wheat for sure. We'll see how the Rustic Saison ranks up as well. As far as this beer goes, its very refreshing for this California heat and puts a nice Euro twist on your everyday drinker. As I said I wish these beer were available more often. Stay thirsty my friends!"
"I poured this beer into a perfect pint glass, it has a bright straw yellow body with just a little creamy white head. The smell has a nice maltiiness and some floral hints to it. The taste is very light and refreshing, with some floral tastes on the front and a little bitter hops taste on the back of the tongue. Great mouth feel, smooth just a little carbonated. I could drink this all summer long."
"	It isn’t the most complicated or eccentric brew, but it is tasty and goes down easy. I’d say (next to the Rustic Saison) this is the most refreshing Samuel Adams in the summer variety pack and great for a hot summer day, one worth thinking about going home to after work, during work."
"O- I like the flavor of this beer, but i would like them to be a bit more prominant. I could certainly turn to this one for a good summer session beer..."
"This beer pours a golden color with a fizzy head. The smell contans a harvesty corn like aromas and pepper smells. The taste was strong a good amount of spices. Good carbonation, a floral taste and smell. Strong flavor for this style. Overall very good."
"Pours clear and golden, very carbonated with plenty of fizzy white head. Light, malty aroma with plenty of fruit and caramel notes. Bready, malty flavor, with a slight hop bite and bitterness. Typical Sam Adams fare - a smooth, easy drinker; nothing special but perfectly adequate."
"This would be a great summer session beer for a day anywhere from the lake to sitting at the house after mowing"
"The feel of this beer is light and pretty darn drinkable. This goes down easy but not too easy that the flavor skids right by. There is a delayed craft feel to this beer that is nice but also very easy so that this could be enjoyed many times in a row without problems. A good session beer for the summer."
"One of the more impressive specialty beers from Samuel Adams I've had. The Kolsch style is a hard one to find so this might be a beer I look for in the future."
"Overall- This beer was a complete train wreck for me. It brought back haunting memories of The Bruery’s Orchard White, another beer that less than agreed with me. I won’t be drinking this again, ever. Oh well, they all can't be winners."
"I haven't had a beer this light for some time so it took a bit to recalibrate for a lighter style. It's a pretty gold color with nice white foam. The aroma is wheaty with a bit of tartness. The taste has the same essence with some additional citrus flavor. It finishes fairly smooth leaving very little aftertaste. It's a nice lighter beer and a good example of the style. I'll enjoy the rest in the case."
"It tasted of a light smooth wheat malty beer with a slight hop/malt finish. This was the first kolsch I ever reviewed so I have no idea if this is considered a good beer for the style."
"O-A nicely developed beer. Its a fruity kolsch and I prefer mine on the clean side. I think this gives a little bit of both worlds. The fruitines shows up beginning palate and then quickly dries out. I think this should replace summer ale"
"M: The mouthfeel isn't half bad. I'd love to taste the jasmine sambac in more concentrated proportions though."
"O- Went perfect with some bar food. Easy drinkin', flavorful. Would love to see this around more often, before tonight I'd never heard of it. Will have to keep my eyes peeled, indeed."
"Overall, boring taste, okay looking but the feel is probably the best thing about the beer. I wouldn't seek this again."
"This beer is an easy drinker. Better than a lot of other equally light beers you can find, but nothing spectacular."
"overall an intriguing twist on an underappreciated style. i love beers like this in the summertime!"
"O-A session beer, a light one for the summer. Worth a try."
"O - This has good drinkability. It goes down easy, and would be super refreshing on a hot summer day. Overall, I thought that this was a pretty good beer. It's not very flavorful, but I could see this being a great transition beer for people just getting into craft. I would drink this again though."
"Very enjoyable beer for the summer. The SA summertime mix pack always seems to be the most approachable for the non-craft drinker, and this one fits in nicely, but still has plenty to offer for the more discerning palate."
"Overall it's pretty decent but not spectacular. Still a quite drinkable selection from their summer pack."
"moderatly light, with almost the perfect carbonation. It clears the palate, and allows a fresh taste every time. the sweetness of the grains, and the tangy hops make for a refreshing and clean summer drinker."
"Again, very subtle and clean. Hefty for style. Starts with biscuity pale malt, hint of adjuncts. Hop bite in the middle with a full floral finish. Easy drinking summer ale although it's not up my alley."
"O: Not the best example of the style; drinkable but fairly boring in the end; not Sam Adams best by any means but okay for a hot day, I suppose"
"D: Not a bad beer, nothing complex or intriguing but a very decent session beer."
"Cheers!"
"Overall: EW suits the Summer Styles sampler box. A respectful nod was given to the fiercely traditional Kölsch style, while going for some good ole experimentation by dry-petaling the brew with jasmine flowers."
"Brought over the Summer Styles pack to a cookout on Memorial Day, and cracked this one first. It pours a clear golden straw topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises orange peel, light soap, sweet flowers, and wheat. The taste holds notes of lemon peel, orange zest, wheat, sweet flowers, and slightly faint light greens. The body is a heavy-feeling light, with a moderate carbonation and a crisp, dry finish. Overall, a very nice kolsch, though I feel the smell was just a bit too faint and plain. Not at all bad, though."
"O - Tremendous beer. A too rarely produced style done well and large. Great for a refreshing summertime beer but strong/spicy enough to have a place in any weather."
"Overall: I wish Sam Adams would just stick to making beer and not adding unnecessary weirdness like Asian jasmine. Overall its decent."
"Pours a deep golden straw color with a thinnish white head that dissipates rather quickly. Smells grainy, herbal with hints of lemon and maybe apricot, a bit of floral notes as well. Taste is bready grassy citrusy herbal. Creamy watery mouthfeel, medium to light body and level of carbonation. This is a light refreshing brew that seemed to go down rather quickly on this hot day. If this was in a six pack it might make it into the summer rotation."
"My first Kolsch style beer that I have ever had and I must say I will be experimenting much more with this style of beer thanks to Mr. Adams"
"One of the new Sam Adams offerings in the summer variety pack. Always found a kolsch to be an interesting style, here it goes. Pours a bubbly golden color. Mouthfeel is pretty good, great crispness to this beer. Nice clean finish, super refreshing. Spot on with a lot of the other kolsch's I've had before and definitely has that ""Euro"" taste to it. A great addition to a summer pack, hopefully it stays around."
"overall this beer is pretty damn good...wish they would brew this all year round"
"Overall - Somewhere between the Boston Lager and Noble Pils you have the East-West Kolsh. Definitely a nice go-to summer or warm weather option. Nice job Jim."
"Light bodied with a creamy texture to it. Faint maltiness, dry crackers, raw barley, cereal grains, apples. Easy going with simple flavors, it has some overall balance to it. Light and easy to drink, sessionable for some. Didn't really notice the jasmine listed as an ingredient. Not my favorite Kolsch, but better than some."
"M - 3.5 its easy on the mouth...I just think that after several it would feel as if one was chewing on Pot Porri all day"
"Hoping this one sticks around. Perfect summer beer - much moreso than the Sam Summer!"
"First sip has a distinct floral hoppiness and decent amount of lingering sweetness. Not quite as dry as i'd prefer. Still a nice flavor overall. A nice addition to the mix pack."
"M - Medium body, oily and surprisingly creamy. A real treat to drink, could easily session with this thanks to the reasonable ABV."
"Faint haze, light gold with a short white cap. Decent head retention and a bit of spotty lacing. Crackery malt with a sweet floral and spicy aroma, slight grassiness and mild lemony citrus. Delicate bitterness was balanced by spicy and floral notes as well as cereal grain sweetness. Lingering floral and spicy character. I found the body too heavy for a kolsch, it wasn't as crisp as I would like, more medium bodied than light. Carbonation was on the creamy side. Overall, I liked the flavours, but the mouthfeel didn't work for me."
"This is a good beer, but I prefer straight up Kolsch's if you can find them. If not, home brew them, because they are a great summer beer."
"The beer was a bright yellow color with a filmy white head that left a ring of lacing after each sip. The aroma is mostly lemon, with some hay and barely a hint of jasmine. The taste is grassy with lemon and orange, with a bready aftertaste. This beer is light with prickly carbonation and a pleasant lingering aftertaste. This is a perfect summer beer, I really enjoyed this beer after a long stressful day."
"An easy drinking beer. No heavy flavors or alcohol to get in the way of drinking a few of these"
"Overall, it was decent, but nothing style-breaking. I saw this on tap somewhere for $7 a pour and glad I passed and had a chance to grab a bottle for a lot less. Easy drinking, but lacking a little flavor."
"I was very pleased with this brew overall. A nice addition to the summer pack for sure and I could absolutely see myself having one in the future."
"A decent, but ultimately uninteresting, Kolsch. It isn't too sweet, which is a problem I have with many beers in this style, but it honestly doesn't have much flavor to it."
"Samuel Adams East-West Kölsch is a crystal clear, pale golden ale with a thin white head that quickly vanishes, leaving a small white ring and nice lacing. It has an aroma of lemon and light grain. It's light bodied and very lively. It leaves the mouth slightly scratchy. There's not really much flavor here. It's a touch funky and slightly bitter. There's almost a touch of sweetness and something like herbal tea going on. Maybe that's the jasmine sambac. This is not really my thing, even after mowing the lawn."
"Overall an interesting beer from Samuel Adams. I can't say it's one to seek out, though. I'm enjoying the second one more than I did the first when I drank it a few days ago."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a SA perfect pint glass. Pale yellow pour with a medium white head. The aroma is lemony, grassy. The flavor is light, bisquity. There are floral notes, and hints of sweetness. The body is light, good carbonation. A decent kolsh, nothing exciting."
"Pretty standard Kolsch appearance, pale golden with a finger's worth of head that doesn't retain for too long. The aroma is alright, grains, noble hops and citrus primarily. The taste is also pretty good, it's a little lacking in intensity, but otherwise nice. Hops and citrus dominate until the signature grainy Kolsch finish. The mouthfeel is nice, it's brisk and well-carbonated. The drinkability is very good. Overall, a solid Kolsch."
"O - This is an okay kolsch-style ale. Not a lot of depth of flavors or complexities but it is easy drinking."
"Since I have no basis of comparison, I have to rate this on its own terms. I found myself enjoying this one, it is a style new to me, and one I may have to explore more. This is a fairly spicy brew, but has a nice mix of flavors."
"O -- Happily surprised that the Asian Jasmine Sambac doesn't overpower this beer. It's a very easy drinking, good take on Kölsch and perfect for today's 80 plus temps."
"O: This is not the best in the Summer 12 pack but I'd drink it again."
"A fun and totally drinkable beer. Great addition to the Summer 2011 twelve-pack."
"Overall: I want six packs of this, like, now. Excellent beer which has ""summer"" and ""session"" written all over it. Layered and complex, but simple enough to kick back with on a summer evening. Get this brew while it's available."
"The crisp dryness makes the mouthfeel interesting, and it's probably the best part of this beer. It's pretty drinkable, but I wouldn't buy it again, so that hampers the overall rating."
"Prost!!!"
"Pillowy white head floating atop a very pale gold coler brew. I could smell this one feet away from the glass, nice sweet malt and a prominant floral hops. Grainly malt front, nice floral hop and a touch of bitterness. Nice smooth mouth. SA did a good job on this one, nice kolsch"
"CHEERS"
"Super drinkability, a near perfect Kolsch. I could drink the hell out of this come summer time..."
"SA E-W Kolsch 12oz into pint. Pours piss yellow, crystal clear, with a 1/4"" white head. Smells weird, unlike any other Kolsch Ive ever had before. A weird floral, sweet note, almost like a apple jolly rancher sits in the background, along with the standard biscuit malts that I usually detect. No hops are present here. Taste is close to the nose, with the weird sweet character coming through. Overall I'm not a fan of this beer at all, and I probably will just save the other five from the few cases I have, and pass them out to family when they are over. I truly don't think this is a solid representation of the Kolsch style, but I guess a few out there could see this as a mediocre summer beer."
"Not a bad beer, but not one I'd pursue further, either."
"Pours a clear gold body -- one finger of bright white head has good retention and lacing properties. Aromas are predominantly grainy, with strong notes of an apple bear claw and small hints of something that remind me of the time I drove through a Utah desert with the windows rolled down. You don't expect much in the way of aromas from a kolsch, and these sniffs are simple but good. In terms of taste of weight, this beer is nearly simple but terrifically enjoyable. If only it had more assertive/balancing hops, it would exemplify everything that kolsch is intended to be. Body is light. Flavors are predominantly [lightly] malty and devoid of challenging corners or anything even mildly offensive. Having tried several dozen kolschs, I consider this to be in the top 5% of the style."
"Overall: fairly impressed by this Kolsch from Boston Beer Company. Before cracking it, I thought that this was a style that they could pull off. Usually, I am disappointed by Sam Adams beers not being flavorful enough. Well, Kolsch is supposed to be light so it worked nicely. This Kolsch is as good as any other I've had to date. Now, if only I didn't have to end up with two bottles of Sam Adams Summer Ale and Blackberry Witbier to get this... Cheers!"
"O - My initial impressions are that overall this one is a little light in the flavor department. Style wise I prefer Stoudt's offering, but the incredible refreshing and crisp nature of this brew would have me coming back for another. An excellent choice for a session."
"East west kolsch has some interesting flavors happening, while I can still see a pretty ordinary Kolsch as the base, the added grain of paradise actually does give the beer a bit of a boost. I like how the earthy/peppery elements buoy the malt keeping it interesting and at the same time complimenting the yeast which has a mild German mustiness. the malt is generally light and inoffensive, but all in all I found this to be something I could see working in a cookout setting mid-summer to go with ribs or brats to cut some grease and deliver a nice amount of flavor at the same time similar to a Witbier."
"O-this is an extremely boring and pointless attempt from Sam Adams. i'm thinking it was their goal to make a lawn mower beer. this might hit someone's soft spot on a hot summer day, but not mine. its just an average beer thats only slightly better than BMC beers."
"D - This is not really what I expected, I didn't notice the jasmine addition noted on the label until I tasted the beer and decided something was off. The jasmine is clearly noticeable and it kind of makes the beer taste more like a saison than a kolsch. It isn't a bad beer, but I would have preferred that they just make a traditional kolsch instead. I can't help but think that adding something like jasmine is the kind of thing that one might do when a homebrewed kolsch turned out poorly and I came up with a last ditch idea to save it."
"This sam has a nice round flavor that is not overly complex. It has a nice aroma that i have not smelled in recent beers, I like it. It has a nice clear color. with a smooth head when it was poured. It had a nice feel in my mouth and was rather smooth. I would definitely drink this again"
"O: Thought this was a good beer, but I don't ever see myself wanting more then 2 of these at a time because it's pretty basic and simple would use this beer to have after I had a heavy beer."
"A good summer/warm weather brew. It would be nice to have more available for one could sit a spell with this refreshing kolsch."
"D-I would rate this beer possibly a little higher if it were in the correct category. Its a nice ""fruit/vegetable beer but not a very good kolsch. I prefer a little more bite from the hops and a touch bit more complexity in the malt department."
"O: Impressed. Liked this one a lot, getting into Kolschs and this one is right up there so far."
"Solid golden yellow hue with a fluffy white head. Soft fruity aroma with a light, spicy hit of leafy hops and some warm cereal grain. Spicy, crisp floral hops meet a cracker-like maltiness. Subtle biscuit and grass. Light bodied, appropriately bitter...very refreshing. Certainly a worthy addition to the summer mix pack."
"Pours a transparent golden color with a very visible carbonation. Head is about the density of a soda head, when I poured it into a pint glass it rose to about an 3/4 of an inch. This head quickly recedes leaving me with a ring around my glass. The smell is of light sweet malts and a slight floral smell. Upon first taste I get that same sweet malt taste, but I also catch some citrus hops along with the slight floral taste. The mouthfeel is light and refreshing. This is a wonderful substitute for your friend's BMC, it still has the refreshing qualities and the ABV is pretty reasonable. This is what I'll be bringing along to drink with my buddies this summer."
"Pours straw yellow with a foamy white head that fades fast. The smell is not very potent, but you get some subtle citrus and malt. The flavor starts subtle and sweet, with some citrus notes. The flavor is crisp and refreshing. The beer finishes with the floral notes, and the aftertaste is somewhat malty. The mouthfeel is light, and has a great balance with carbonation. This beer is a great summer beer, not too much flavor, but still hits the spot."
"Overall, a pretty nice beer. The appearance is the weak spot."
"A great example of a fresh, summertime, light and crisp beer. Lots of floral qualities and a hint of citrus in the nose. I smell an aroma of a faint sweet flower I assume is jasmine. It is subtle enough that the beer remains drinkable. A subtle crisp, citrus touch with herbal and floral notes. Kind of watery, but goes with the territory of a light session beer. Nice malty background. Overall easy to drink and refreshing."
"Pleasant and malty initially, with mellow sweetness and just enough balance to make it interesting. Clean, tame finish that never breaks with noble bitterness like a pilsner or pale ale. Carbonation is very manageable. Extremely easy to put away in quantity, especially outside in the summer. However, don't go looking for a whole of of complexity here."
"Overall: A great example of the Kölsch style and an excellent summer seasonal. A nice addition to the Sam Adams stable."
"Pours a pale golden hue in the body appears much like any other quality Kolsch style, bright white fluffy head. Fine speckled lacing surrounds the glass. Aroma has a biscuit malt breadiness with hints of citrus and herbal hops, with a notable floral aspect. Clean drinking Kolsch style beer with hints of breadiness, grassy mild citrus hops, with a kiss of flower additions going on. Mouthfeel is light bodied sturdy carbonation going strong, with a effervescent texture backend. Overall not bad, tastes pretty good, for what it is, the Rustic Saison satisfied my tastes buds much more though."
"Would recommend this one and Sam Adams can stick a feather in his hat. Enjoy one of these while sitting outside taking in the sun."
"Very strange beer to review. Poured out to a golden strawish color. Nice white foamy head with good retention and decent lacing. Dominant scent when breathing it in is bread/grain. Taking a taste, the hop spice is what definitely hits you first. Not hard, but it is what one notices. After a few more sips, the citrus notes start to kick in. The flavors definitely develop as you get further into it. There is still an aftertaste I can't quite name that throws off the finishing balance, but it doesn't stay with you as you continue. All in all, a decent summer beer."
"Overall: Not worth the extra $$$."
"An absolutely spectacular quaffer, with just enough complexity to keep it interesting. Perhaps not exactly to style (though the addition of Jasimine Sambac flowers prevents that from the get-go), but certainly well-executed and a perfect beer for summertime drinking. Boston Beer Co. may want to consider bringing this out as a replacement for the venerable Summer Ale."
"O (D) - It's a tasty beer, I'd drink it and the rest of this twelver for the summer, probably."
"M – Light body without being watery. Medium / light carbonation for the style."
"A quaffable brew with enough character to keep one interested and a good interpretation of the style."
"The beer pours a yellow-gold color with a white head. The aroma is heavy on the wheat and grain with not too much else going on. The flavor is more exciting. I get some grain and grass notes, as well as some bready malt and a little bit of grape characteristics. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Decent, but not as good as I was expecting it to be."
"Drinkability- I thought it was pretty good. Great summer beer"
"O: Thought this was a good beer, but I don't ever see myself wanting more then 2 of these at a time."
"A nice refreshing beer with no real strengths or weakness. Wish the would drop the mediocre Summer Ale and make this the summer beer."
"Pours a clear straw in color, good foam and alittle lace stickage. Smells of biscuity malts, some fresh baked bread and doughy notes. In the flavor, crisp, clean, bready malts once again dominate. Alittle herbal hop presence but mainly light, malty and refreshing. A very solid kolsch and tastes like many imports only fresher."
"I can't say it disappointing, cuz' it's fine, but it's typical of several SA beers of being underwhelming."
"Overall: a nicely drinkable, very decent beer. I like the combination of jasmine and Kölsch; it makes for a greatly refreshing brew."
"This jewel was in the summer styles 12 pack. Regretfully there are only two. All I can say is WOW! The pour into my pilsner glass reveals a well-carbonated pale yellow brew with a billowing fluffy white head. The aromas is grainy and malty with a hint of grassiness. Taste is true to style,light and refreshing,a little grainy with a smooth hop finish. Jim, please make these available in 12 packs!"
"Medium bodied, carbonation on the light side of medium, I'm thinking this has a great mouth feel. And man, this is so easy a brew to drink. Colour me impressed. I have 3 more bottles that I can enjoy!"
"D: I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this. I'm not a huge fan of the kölsch style nor of the Boston Beer Company's more gimmicky offerings. But this was something that was definitely more than the sum of its parts. They should make this available outside the summer variety pack."
"O - Overall I can't really imagine a much better Kolsch. This beer is wonderful for a hot day and can go well with any food. Intensely easy to drink, with some complexity, but overall it is best described as refreshing and delicious."
"Pours an almost crystal clear, light, yellow-gold. A white, foamy head rears back, but stays a quarter-inch and patches the glass. Smell is fresh, biscuity, lemony, and straw-like. Sugary.. many smells, very complex. Right away, I get the smoothness of honey. Then the typical, sour back-end of the kolsch. A sweetness tries to break thru, but doesn't quite achieve it. A bit of spice on the finish. Feel is sorta like a cut wine. Yes, there is a floralness about this brew as well. An odd choice of ingredients makes for a unique pour. Nice."
"Final Notes: This beer just really isn't my style. It's definitely not a bad beer, but it lacks some character and depth."
"Overall: This to me is an average beer and of Sam Adams special offerings this is with the Coastal Wheat as the least impressive of the bunch. Not a bad beer, but not enough to jump out. Has the characteristics of Sam Adams beers. Crisp, but this is a miss for for me."
"O - This beer was reviewed as a herb/spice beer, as it is obvious from the description on the bottle. The floral presence is out front in this beer and lends itself well to the kölsch style. The floral taste really lends itself to a 'false' noble hop flavor, which make it work well enough."
"D: A nice refreshing beer, but sweeter than anticipated."
"O - easy to drink, tasty and very refreshing."
"Grainy and bready with a light sweetness. Not too shabby, I am glad the jasmine does not impart much of a flavor. The yeast is not as prominent as I would like, but there is still an influence at least. Good, easy drinking with a little bit of character and a crisp finish. A pretty good effort from the BBC, I would buy a sixer of this in standalone format."
"O - Overall I think this beer is very refreshing and drinkable but doesn't offer much more than that for me. In fact I think I would rather have a Pale Ale or a Pilsner. Maybe I'm just not a fan of this style, I'll have to try more in the future. I think it's worth a try though, especially because it currently comes in a mix pack of other refreshing brews for the summer. Cheers!"
"Fairly carbonated but still drinks very smooth. Light and refreshing. Good not great."
"O- A refreshing beer that does have a nice balance of flavors that would be good on a summer day. Everything meshes well together. The word I would use to best describe this beer is crisp."
"O- Overall a very solid example of the style."
"D - Very drinkable. The flavors are nice and complex enough and stay really balanced throughout. Really enjoyable balance. Just wish it had a tad more body."
"O: Very good beer, first Kolsch I've had, but I'm guessing it holds true to the style. Makes me want to try more Kolsch style brews."
"Overall this is a very good summer beer. This mix pack is surprisingly good."
"O - The beer does fit the style well, though not anything I would run out and buy unless I was having a big cook out and want to serve an unpretentious, well brewed quaffer. This is one style we don't see enough of so hats off to Sam Adams for bringing back a beer that many brewers often overlook."
"12oz. bottle served in a Stange. Enjoy before September notched on the label. Pours a translucent golden-yellow with a rocky, bright white 1.5 inch head that eventually settles into a thin band around the edges. Some residual spots of lacing present during the session. Copious tiny bubbles are evident effervescing in solution. Very clean nose - the merest suggestion of citrus (lemon) and a light bready quality. Taste follows nose - bready quality is much sweeter and comes to the forefront, with the citrus character lightly interweaving itself throughout the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is light-bodied with a pleasant, even carbonation. A very flavorful and easy drinking domestic kolsch - would love to see this added to the regular Summer line-up."
"OA: Very good beer, definitely the best offer in the 2011 Summer Sampler."
"D/O: Nice crisp refreshing beer perfect for summer. It really has some good balance and fits the style very well."
"Overall, this is not my favorite style, however, SA seems to have done a good job of spicing it up. Almost too light for my tastes though."
"D: Session beer from heaven. Brilliant balance and nuanced flavor with a moderate alcohol level and light body. Between this and the Noble Pils, Sam Adams is cornering the market and fantastic light session beers."
"O: Not a big fan for the Kolsh styles due their lack of complexity but this one is very drinkable. Thumbs up!"
"12oz bottle with a Best Before Date notched at Sep. Pours a clear golden color with a little bit of head. Aroma is floral and grassy. Some bread and grains as well. Flavor is much like the aroma. Floral and grainy. Slightly bitter with an earthy aftertaste. This is a pretty good pick for warm weather drinking. Crisp and smooth. Refreshing brew. Overall, I like it but probably wouldn't buy it on its own. I do like it in the summer mix pack,though."
"Overall, this is a pretty damn good kolsch. The BBC did a good job at replicating the style, and best of all, it's great to taste one fresh rather than getting burned by a stale import, as Kolsch is relatively low ABV beer with low bitterness, so it does not travel well. A great, easy drinking, summer time brew. Wish it were available in six-packs. Oh, and most importantly, cheers to my 200th BA review!"
"Delicious Kolsch! Pours a very pale golden color with generously sized creamy white head. Nose is literally like some Jasmine white tea I've had in the past, oh so delicate yet clearly there. Floral elements are noted quickly on the palate, but then a hearty herbal character takes center stage and carries through to the finish. Medium bodied and delightfully drinkable. More floral notes in the aftertaste too. Really, really like this Kolsch."
"D/O: Easily drinkable and a great summer beer. I'm enjoying these new additions to the Sam packs. Definitely beats the Blackberry Wheat or Pale Ale that it replaced from last years mixer in terms of a ""Summer style"""
"The other ratings don't do this beer justice. It's a style that I feel is highly accessible and worth trying."
"Poured clear amber into a pint glass. Quick white 1/4 inch foam doesn't last. The scent is very subtle. I get flowers maybe a little malt but not much. Clean crisp light taste. It's hard to pin down anything specific. Easy to drink but not really memorable."
"From a 12 fl. oz. bottle with September 2011 snipped off the label. Sampled on April 8, 2011. Wow, I cannot believe that I am only the fourth person reviewing a new Sam Adams brew. The pour into my Kolsch glass is a well-carbonated pale yellow with a a thin white head. The aromas are grainy and malty. The body is pretty nice in the medium range. The taste has a decent enough grainy character with a slightly assertive dry hoppy ending. It seems to emulate the style well enough."
"12oz bottle purchased as part of this year's summer mixed 12-pack. Pours a crystal-clear pale yellow body with nearly an inch of white head. Hints of fruit and nut waft from the beer. Flavor is fruity, spicy, and floral. Balanced and tasty but not in-your-face, just as the style calls for. An awesome addition to Samuel Adams' summer offerings."
"The label mentions Alsation hops ""imparts subtle citrus note. Jasmine Sambac, a night blooming Southeast Asian flower, adds a delicate floral aroma and flavor to this layered and refreshing brew."" The hops are subtle for sure, and the floral aroma may be the one subtle flavor I find lingering (which I don't really care for)."
"The ale has ""Extreme Session Beer"" written all over it ... thanks Sam Adams for continuing to define what an extreme beer can be and that it can be subtle. Being this beer is aimed for summer time consumption I highly recommend it."
