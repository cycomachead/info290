Light and clean on the nose. Flavors are toasted forward, with a bolt of pepper and dry, resinous hops. Very clean and extremely balanced palate.

Like a good hef, the yeast leaves behind a fruity, tangy taste, although a kolsch isn't near as yeasty. The sweetness is balanced by a nice hop bitterness.

Lots of malt up front and. Aftertaste is floral and herbal with a great hop tingle. Mouthfeel is robust and slightly filmy. Drinkability is great with a low alcohol content and great, well-balanced taste. However, at $9.99 a six pack I'll save this one for special occassions.","Gilly1980","Jan 30, 2011"

Pours a translucent yellow-gold with a loose, one inch, bright white head composed of tiny, compressed bubbles. Head eventually dissipates into a frothy skim, with delicate swaths and spots of lacing revealed during the session. Nose expresses light grains with perhaps a trace of citrus - an extremely clean presentation. Taste follows nose with a light, lingering skunky quality - not bad and somewhat characteristic of the style from my limited experience. Mouthfeel is light-medium, consistency is perhaps a little heavier than I've come to associate with the style, with a lively effervescence. All and all, a very nice and drinkable domestic kolsch.

Saltine crackers and pilsner malt lay down a light, bready foundation upon which a sharp, grassy hop bitterness is built (soapy-tasting on the way back up). Carbonation is big and bubbly, contrasting nicely against the light body, and adds a snappy, zesty, almost drying bite to the finish.
