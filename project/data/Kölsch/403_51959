Smell is of malt, grain, and slight grassy aromas. Taste is much the same with grain and grassy flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel.

Chunky scattered lacing forms with each sip and as the head slowly dwindles down. Aroma has some mild citrus components with some cooked veggies and pale biscuit malt sweetness. A touch of herbal spicy hops and mineral water are there as well, let's see how it's tasting. A bit of harshness is present with mild grainy off flavors, the metallic edge seems to overshadow the rest of the flavors. Some nice sweetness with a kiss of citrus fruit are apparent but they become muddled within cooked veggies and that mineral rusty finish. Mouthfeel is thin but carbonation seems a bit unnatural and forced, where the metallic edge really weighs the palate down after just a few sips.

I feel like it's lifting my spirits already. Fairly straight-forward, light on the hops, but "laesst sich leicht trinken" (allows itself to be drank easily) as the Germans would say.

It's not bad, relatively dry with hints of grassy like qualities, and the flavor of raw oats. Slightly bitter, with a hint of sourness. Finished crispy and slightly dry. Mouthfeel was pretty good, with the carbonation striking the tastebuds with the notion of something interesting on the way... unfortunately, it never comes. This brew just needs more flavor.

It's a light summer ale with not much in the way of traditional Kolsch characteristics, although the word has become shorthand for an American blonde ale, often available in the summer. The bottle had a disturbing amount of dark sediment, although the best-by date was 100304, and the beer poured with an unfiltered haze which was pleasing but definitely not true to style. Small amount of spidery lace. Some lemon and grass flavors are actually quite pleasing, and a wheaty tartness seemed to be evident.

That's about how I feel with the Curve Ball. Pyramid doesn't make too many bad beers. This isn't a bad beer, but it isn't especially great. Some head sat on the orange-brown beer. A nice, flowery smell, but mellow. The taste was smooth and malty and the beer went down well. The main problem with it is that I wasn't satisfied when I was finished despite having a beer with something to it.","misterscooter","Sep 17, 2004"

Strong herbal flavors are there as well, kind of grassy. Middle is light and airy, almost watery but not quite. Finish is dry but not really that crisp. All in all this beer didn't do it for me.

Crisp, clean, with a touch of citric acidity for refreshment. Slightly herbal hops profile. A little cereal grain flavor crept in, but not so much as to throw the beer off. This is the beer mass produced pale lagers want to be when they are reincarnated as their next step to beer nirvana.

Mouthfeel is crisp and light bodied. Taste is very light bodied, with some grainy malt and nice, but faint, herbal hops bitterness for balance. Not very complex, but drinkability is good. I would call this one of those "lawnmower beers", that would be refreshing after mowing the lawn on a hot day, but pretty useless in other settings.

3.51,8,4,3,3.5,3.5,4,"This beer is a fifth pitch with 3 - 1 count. Color is a pale light yellow, small bright white head that faded fast, leaves no lace and has lots of bubbly action within the color. Smell is very faint, hardly noticeable citrus and spice. Taste is sharp and zesty of yeast, somewhat herbal/spice quality, a bit of wheat and a small hop thats very quick to start with a slight tarty bite. Mellows out nicely which I found to be the best part of this beer. Feel is light bodied, moderately carbonated. Well done light styled beer, but not quite up to par comparatively speaking. Would fit perfectly for hot summer days.","tavernjef","May 18, 2003"
3.8,16.9,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Pours a slightly hazy straw-gold body with a brass cast. The full and creamy bright white head holds well, bolstered by a solid release of tiny bubbles. And although the head slowly drops in size from an inch or more tall, it maintains a solid 1/4 to 1/2 inch throughout and leaves some nice lace. The fresh and welcoming aroma displays grainy malt amidst a light fruitiness and a touch of citrusy hops. The body is light/medium and the carbonation is only gently crisp at the outset before becoming smooth and creamy across the palate. The flavor offers a delicate but spirited combination of grainy and lightly wheat-ish malt that's well-balanced by firm bitterness. An herbal/floral hop flavor and yeasty fruitiness add the character that gives it life. It finishes dry due to the bitterness, but with a layer of honeyish and fruity malt that sticks in the mouth momentarily. A nice beer, and although it's not very authentic when compared to the beers of Köln, it is a fairly interesting American interpretation.","NeroFiddled","May 18, 2003"

3.37,3.7,3.5,4,3,3,3.5,"Nice and clear as expected with a larger head that quickly dies into almost nothing. Good crisp flavor with a mellow hop aroma. A little more bitter than I expected for a bitter but thats not a bad thing in my book. Overall not a bad beer, just wish there was a little better head retention.","Elemental","May 16, 2003"
3.25,0,3,3,3.5,3.5,3,"The taste is very mellow. That's what a kolsch is supposed to be, but this one hasn't quite hit the spot quite yet. I quickly feel full after drinking just one beer. That label is pretty cool though.","freed","May 11, 2003"
3.07,-5.5,2.5,3,3,3,3.5,"Average beer. Clear as can be, golden in color. Very light aroma something akin to passing near a well-vegetated field. Kind of organic, herbal smell. Very little to the taste and pretty straightfoward. A little zest to it, and it goes down remarkably easy. A little more flavor would have done this beer wonders. Probably nicest as a softball game alternative to Miller Lite.","marburg","Mar 08, 2003"
3.8,16.9,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Pale gold color, with a brief white head. Aromas of herbs, and some fruit. Minimal hops in the nose, but much more spark upon the tongue. Label illustration is a perfect application, for this is an ideal ballpark beer. A lingering spice/fruit flavor continues through the finish. Soft, satisfying, delicious.","feloniousmonk","Jan 19, 2003"
3,-7.7,3,3,3,3,3,"The pour a crystal clear bright golden amber color, the head a dazzling white, the size modest and the lace nice clinging sheets. Malt aromas dominate the sparklingly clean and fresh nose, Crisp malt start with a skinny top and the finish bitingly acidic. Sparsely hopped, and a pleasantly dry long lasting aftertaste, drinkable, but not a beer that I care for.","Gusler","Dec 26, 2002"
3.32,2.2,2.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours rose/gold with no spontaneous bubbles or head. Smells sweet and syrupy with hints of macadamia nuts. The flavors are of sun-dried veggies and toast with a decent, rich mouthfull of dry grain. The bubbles carve out a speckled trail of metal through the finish. Pretty average beer. Too bad.","putnam","Oct 12, 2002"

3.67,12.9,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,"Easy drinking and balanced. Similar to the Shiner Summer Stock Kolsch except less fruity and ale-like and a more balanced finish. I personally don't mind the grassy taste and aroma because that is what I expect and have learned to appreciate in German (style) beers.","EagleTalon","Jul 14, 2002"
2.6,-20,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,"Pyramid Curve Ball:  Seasonal/summer beer in the style of a Kolsch.  The problem is the beer had an astringent aroma and taste that was not at all pleasant.  Further, had a pure white head that disappeared for good within thirty seconds.  The taste reminded me of grass, in a strange way.  Not worth the bother.","jackndan","Jun 27, 2002"
4.22,29.8,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"The beer pours a chill-hazed golden with carbonation evident in the form of bubbles surfacing at a good clip.  What little head that forms is gone quickly.  A nice spicy hop aroma (seems like saaz) with an underlying malt scent noticeable also.  Body is medium. Very nice pils or cara-pils malt base. The hop nuances really dance around on the tongue nicely.  This is a nice tasting Kolsch.   Leaves a nice subdued lingering bitterness that makes you want to drink more.  After the Snowcap, this is probably my next favorite Pyramid Beer.","Bighuge","Jun 14, 2002"
