"The label reads that it has a soft malt character and a low hop profile and it's spot on. The label is certainly evidenced by the aroma as it has an near indecipherable maltiness. The flavor has a nice bran, grain and malt flavor that lends to an exceptionally crisp, dry and satisfying experience. It is what it is...a Kolsch."

"09/26/12 On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. More hops than I expected for what was billed as a Kolsch. Gives it a fuller texture. My preferences is for crispness so this is not top o' the list. If hops is your thing give it a go."

"Overall / Drinkability:  Overall, it’s an okay beer.  Nothing amazing, but it’s not a Kölsch.  I know it even says on the label that it is in the style of this beer, but no, it’s not.  Maybe an American Blond Ale or even a Lager, but it is not a Kölsch.  Easily drinkable, but I would want something different for my second glass."

"Overall: This isn't something I would try again or recommend if you were looking for an American ""kolsch"". Cereal sweetness is over the top. Not really that drinkable, especially for the style. I'm usually a fan of New Holland but this one is a miss."

"A rather inconsistent beer as far as overall quality goes. The aroma and flavor are pretty decent, but the appearance suffers from the large, frothy bubbles in the head, and the head quickly fades to a bare wisp. The mouthfeel also comes across as rough and unrefined. Not bad overall, but far from being a go-to beer for the style."

"Floral, crackery, slightly sweet. Very refreshing. There is a bit of diacetyl that creeps in as it warms. Floral and crackery comes out in the flavor profile, as well. It might be on the sweet side, but it's tough to nail this style. More attenuation would help."
""
"T: Sweet wheat right off the bat, approaching that of Coors too much. Virtually no Noble hops flavor. Slight sulfuric and mineral tones set it apart from Coors, and let's me know I'm drinking a 'craft' beer. Better examples exist. Not recommended, too sweet."

"Had this out of a flute glass at the American Tap Room in Arlington, VA during the USA/Ghana World Cup match. Definitely hit the spot on a 90-plus degree day. Smooth and easy to drink, the flute glass emptied far quicker than I expected. Not very complex, but what it tries to do it does very effectively."

"Full circle is an easy drinking full flavored kolsch. It is one of the best light beers that i have ever drank. I have had it on-tap and by the bottle, both are outstanding. If you are looking for a good cold beer on a hot summers day you need look no further."

"Pours a light copper with a modest white-off-white head. The nose is sweet with malty overtones. No evident hop. The palate is light, crisp, and sweet with suggestions of hoppy bitterness. Fresh. Forward. Pleasant lingering; dry finish. Modest carbonation and some light Belgian lace. Very nice."

"Poured into stange. Golden straw color with a lively rocky white head and lots of effervescence. Leaves some slippery lacing. Smell is light malt with slight wine-like notes, and some light crisp hops. Taste is light leafy hop and yeasty bitterness moving into clean, light malt and finishing slightly dry and clean with a hint of wine-like aftertaste. Not the best I've had of the style, but a tasty kolsch nonetheless."

"New Holland Brewing Company. Pours clear, mild but deeper yellow, little lacing, low head. Clean flavors, not distinctly bready but wheat notes present, wet, light on hop bitterness. Floral and citrus notes midway. Good carbonation and follow-through."

"0- and excellent kolsch style, one of my fav. in the stlye. Perfect labor job beer, or hot day moving around a lot beer. Perfect during a day of yard work. If you like the style pick it up, this would be a great beer to get people who drink macro a lot into the craft soon, really pleasant and dead on with the style."

"Meh. Honestly, I don't even go through the categories individually. It's a decent beer, but that's all it is. The aroma and flavor are floral with a bit of hops. The beer's pretty light and refreshing, but there's nothing about it that blows my mind. New Holland is supposed to be an OUTSTANDING brewery, but this beer's just... alright. Would have again. Definitely not bad for the $2 I spent for it."

"O - A great example of this style. One of the best to come from American craft brewer."

"Pours a clear, pale amber color with not much of a head. Scent is slightly malty with hints of grains but that’s about it. The taste is uniquely malty. It starts out light, crisp with hints of citrus but finishes kind of dry and chalky. A pretty decent kolsch style brew from New Holland."
""
""
""
"This beer pours a clear, bold yellow with a fluffy white head and no lacing. The aroma is lemony with hints of grass and wheat. The flavor has a mildly bitter beginning followed through with typical kolsch notes of lemon, cake, and grass. There's a bit os sweet malt ih there but not much. It has a light mouthfeel and a dry finish. New Holland Full Circle is a decent beer, a little different, but typical kolsch. Recommended."

"Overall a pretty boring beer with a weak flavour and smell, won't buy again."

"Overall: Kolsch is rarely a style that blows me away. However, New Holland's enry is perhaps my favorite example of the style I have had to date. The beer is very floral and there is a distinct breadiness. The lightness makes this an excellet beer to have several of on a hot summer's day. Nothing overly complex, but very flavorful. This would be close to a 4.0 if I was not trying to grade to style."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled 4/26/2012. Pours lightly hazy golden straw color with a nice 2 finger dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Some spotty foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of lemon, pear, herbal, floral, cracker, bread, grass, earth, and light pepper. Very nice and well balanced aromas with good strength; spot on for a kolsch. Taste of lemon, grass, pear, pepper, herbal, biscuit, floral, earth, and light toast. Lingering notes of light fruits, grass, herbal, biscuit, earth, and light pepper on the finish for a short bit. Great flavor balance and good complexity; with a nice amount of flavor for being under 5%. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming noticed at all. Overall this is an excellent kolsch! Nice amount of flavor and great balance; extremely smooth and easy to drink as expected. Very well done, and spot on to style. Great choice for a session beer, plus it is year round."

"Overall it's an ok beer, but for a fav style of mine this isn't really anything memorable. I wish it had more of a bready tasty to it."

"O: worth trying, but not for me. Definitly a solid brew though that is very drinkable"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this has a good backbone in malty and grainy/bready flavors and its nicely carbonated - just not a head turner but solid."
"Poured into a pint glass, this is a bright golden color and slightly fizzy. Smells sweet and grainy with hints of white grape juice and honey. Taste leans on the sweet side, with more white grape juice and only a very light hoppiness in the background. Very mild, drinkable, and refreshing."
""

"Feels well carbonated, wetting to the palate, and a little oily slick. Light to medium in body."

"Nothing like a pint of fresh kolsch right from the source. One of my favorites of this style but, then again, I have rarely had this style on tap."

"I'm not sure that this light ale competes well with authentic German Kolsch, but compared to many Blonde or Golden Ales, I'm on board!"
"Overall I thought this was a pretty good beer, it was a nice and unique Kolsch, I don't have a ton of experience with this style so I really don't know how true to the style this beer is but the bottom line is that that beer was light but still had a good amount of flavor to it that made for a pretty nice beer to drink with a meal. This beer had great drinkability, it was very smooth and seems like this would be a nice refreshing beer to have on a hot summer day, this could make for a good session beer and I wouldn't rule out taking out a six pack throughout the day. What I liked most about this beer was that is was smooth and light but it still had a good amount of nice flavors going on that I really enjoyed, and the combination of biscuit malts, hay, and grassy hops really worked well in the flavor of this beer. There wasn't really anything that I didn't like about this beer, it could have had better head retention but that isn't that big of a deal and it doesn't warrant a drop in points. I would for sure buy this beer again, especially in the summer, it would go nice along with Oberon for a good refreshing beer to quench my thirst and cool me down in the summer. I recommend this beer for someone looking for a light beer that still retains a good amount of flavor and if Kolsch's are your thing then this beer should hit the spot. This beer was just as good as I remembered it, I tend to overlook this style when there are so many other interesting styles on the shelf but I think I should give this style more attention, it is simple, clean, light, and great tasting. New Holland did a great job with this beer and I see why this is one of their main beers, you don't have to have in your face flavors to be a great beer and this beer does a great job in proving that."

"Pours a clear light yellow color with a good white head and a nice bit of lacing. The nose carries some fairly light malt and a touch of straw. Very faint hops as well. Clean and crisp in the flavor with a bit of malt. Light body with crisp carbonation. Pretty good."
""
""
"O - I really enjoy this beer. It's not something I would go out of the way for, but on a hot summer day its worth having."
"A little cloudy, maybe the glass?, but otherwise nice and easy to drink. Would grab again this summer."

"4.5 D: I used to think very little of the style. This beer is changing my views."
"O- Spot on taste, feel and carbonation. True to style while the brew master still made it his own."
"Almost missed my chance to try this guy this year. Close call. It pours a hazy pale straw topped by a finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises lemon zest, orange peel, cracked wheat, cardamom, and light biscuit. The taste brings in more of the same, with the fruit coming out a lot stronger, and the cardamom joining in to ensure that balance is maintained. Hell, it even seems like some black pepper was thrown in there as well. The body is fairly light, with a moderate carbonation and a crisp finish. Overall, a nice kolsch, something I could easily see drinking during a hot Summer day, but not necessarily something to go searching for."
"Overall: A decent beer, though I would have prefered it to be crisper and drier"
"Kölsch has been mentioned more than once as being the German’s lawnmower beer. While America cracks open that standard, ice cold adjunct lager, ze Germans go for this refresher. That said, this is a good take on that style - it fills the criteria I’d want from a yard beer, but it has character. I like the minimal usage of everything here - like a blank slate for just a bit of hop to surface on. Otherwise, a light beer with a yeasty note. While I won’t sing its praises in the streets, I’ll definitely continue to choose this beer."
"Very light, slightly sweet fruit flavor with a mild finish. I did detect a bit of spiciness to it, as well as some apple and pear. A nice, refreshing, good-tasting beer, but for a beer of this style I look for a bit more ``winey- and grapey-ness''."
"Overall I really like this beer. Simple, sweet, and has a nice bit of grain and hops. This might be the best beer I had from the brewery."
"As I try more Kolsch- style brews, I'm finding they're as varied in appearance and flavor as any other style. While this may sound obvious, until recently my Kolsch experiences had been singularly uninspired. I'm glad to find better examples such as this, even if it is not as traditional as others."
"O- A solid attempt of replicating a German favorite of mine. I still prefer the German Kolsch of Koln. However, this is worth a try and is an interesting U.S. take on a classic style."
"O (D) - an interesting, and acceptable Kölsch. Not great, not bad. Worth a try, though."
"Overall: Very refreshing Kolsch that is among the best I have had. Great summer beer."
"This beer poured out as a very light yellow color. The head was fizzy and thinned out really fast. There wasn't much of a lacing from this one. The smell of the beer is mostly grainy, not a whole lot else going on here. The taste of the beer has a very subtle flavor in general. Mouthfeel is very light as well with some decent carbonation to it. Overall this beer does fit the style I feel. These are good summer beers."
"O: this has a good base, but my favorite kolsch's have a nice dry hop to them."
"Overall/notes - Solid Kölsch ale from New Holland. Doesn't try to be complex and leaves a satisfying impression. Perfect for a hot Missouri summer... I think I'll have another!"
"O: Goes down easy, somewhat tasty, not filling, not much of a kick, ok representation of style. I've become a big fan of the kolsch style... this is a decent kolsch but there are far better options out there."
"D: Perfect session beer. What a treat for a nice warm day. I'd order another2 and I'll buy again."
"Very good kolsch-style beer. Alot of depth to the flavor and well-rounded refreshment. I'll definitely be drinking this again."
"A kolsch should be light, but needs more character than this. Better examples out there this summer."
"Im not sure what to think of this. Between the huge head and the yeast (i hope) floating in the head, there were some anomalies. But its a nice light summer brew."
"Drinkability – Very refreshing and light. Good summer beer. Not heavy or complex. Easy drinker, not a sipper."
"Overall: A drinkable beer which displays all the basic Kolsch qualities.I would have liked a more subtle aroma profile, and the clarity was less than in German examples."
"Overall a nice light beer with a good fruity finish, definitely would be nice on a hot summer day after cutting the lawn."
"If anyone who reads this knows of an American brewery that does a spot on kolsch, please let me know."
"D: It goes down easy, even if I'm not too sure I could be persuaded to drink too many of these based on the somewhat unchanging, faintly sweet taste. Still, an interesting opportunity to try a somewhat obscure style, and definitely worth a glass."
"Drinkability: this beer was very easy to drink had refreshing qualities. If you are looking for the style, there are better ones but this will suffice."
"Verdict - Disappointing in just about every aspect after the worker at my local shop hyped it up. Perhaps I got an older bottle that didn't age well. Very bland and dull."
"This needs to be avoided, horrible."
"In all, if you don't mind the style leeway, this is quietly one of my favorite New Holland offerings."
"(from notes - tasted Oct 2011)"
"D - The drinkability here is good. I think this would be a good beer for warm weather. It is not one of my favorite styles, but I think this is a decent beer overall. I'd give it another try."
"D: I could throw back a few of these bad boys. A pleasant surprise for me."
" a good representation of the style."
"Appears a golden straw yellow with a cloudy body and a thin paper white cap. Little to no lacing and only a thin collar of the head remains. The aroma is soft: grassy hops, light floral aroma and lemongrass. On the palate, this guy is almost exactly like the nose. Full bodied for such a light beer. Creamy and lush with high drinkability. A good example of the style, a little more flavorful than most, which is highly welcome."
"D - very easy to drink."
"So far, New Holland is one of my favorite breweries with what I've tried. They know what they're doing."
"Pours nicely into beer mug with a golden body that has a white head that quickly disappears with not much retention and very little lacing with light carbonation. I do like the pleasant sweet smell from the malts that are in the beer and the fruitiness that seems present in the beer. The taste is a slightly sweet soft smooth easy drinking beer that has a nice soft mouthfeel and the soft light body makes it a very drinkable beer. This is a pretty decent beer if you like beer with a low malt character with very little bitterness, but I prefer beer to be a little bit more bitter myself."
"The beer pours a yellow color with a white head. The aroma is wheat, fruit and some pepper. The flavor is wheat, oranges and some grassy hops. The fruit is the most dominant flavor. I don't really get any of the pepper from the aroma in the flavor. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Mouthfeel is very light but that makes it very easy to drink."
"Full Circle is very refreshing, a good session beer. New Holland continues to impress me with their stellar brews."
"This beer pours a clear light golden color. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes quickly into no lacing. The aroma is of pale malt with a slight sweetness. The taste is similar to the aroma, but milder. Both the taste, and the aroma lack anything in the way of complexity. The mouthfeel is thin, and watery even for a Kolsch. I like that Kolschs are light in bodied, but this beer is lighter than light. Overall, this beer is lacking in all departments. I will not be drinking it again."
"D- Compare to the MBC type beers this is great but falls into the same type of category, could easily drink this one all day with absolutely no issues. It is enjoyable but very mild, would be something I would not mind to drink out of the bottle"
"D - A drinable light beer but not what I would pay for from a micro. A good ""starter"" beer for Micro-newbies."
"D - Very high."
"Bottle: Poured a light yellow color beer with a medium pure white foamy head with OK retention. Aroma of lightly sweet malt with light fruity ester is OK. Taste is quiet light with some notes of lightly sweet malt and light fruity ester and not much else. Body is about average with good carbonation. OK with no brewing flaws but not something to go for very often."
"Drinkability: It's okay. It works really well in the summer as being a drinkable, refreshing beer; but it's not knocking my socks off."
"Meh...I could take it or leave it...pretty nice for a summertime sipper."
"Pours with plenty of foam, forming a rocky head. The foam takes awhile to settle down. Smells a bit grassy; touch lemony. Fairly crisp toasted malt character with a bit of white breadiness. Very grassy bits of noble hop. Decent bitterness for a kolsch-style ale. A pretty straightforward beer, definitely a summertime quaffer."
"D: Had one of these after a long bike ride. Hit the spot. A good spring/summer session beer."
"Not bad, but I think there are some vital yeast flavors missing."
"Cheers!"
"D- All in all not high on my list of favorite styles but I could see this being a geat warm weather session brew."
"D Good but this beer does not provide enough interest to me to return. 4.0"
"Poured a golden yellow with minimal white head. Smell is some light fruit and hops. Smells a little skunk but also with some wine-y grape flavors to it. Taste is some citrus with a very mild heineken skunky taste to it. Some muscat in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is well carbonated and creamy but a little light in body. Very dry beer, but all in all pretty good."
"Nice rich gold body topped by a frothy head that eventually settles to a thin but solid layer of foam. Aroma is just a touch of grain sweetness - very clean. Flavor has a smooth malt note well balanced by a restrained bitterness. FInishes very clean. Although not an assualt of flavors, this beer is very clean, well balanced, and enjoyable - exactly what a kolsch should be. I've enjioyed this beer immensly all summer long."
"This is a good beer. Don't let the urine color fool you! This pours a nice yellow gold with a little head which disapates quickly. It smells of citrus, hops and a bit dandelion. The taste is light and crisp with some honey and a little hops in the back. Good mouthfeel and decent drinkability."
"Has the smooth drinkability and consistency of a macro pale, but doesnt have that shit beer mouthfeel. Crisp and refreshing. One of the best of the style that I've had. Too bad I don't care for the style all that much."
"D= Highly drinkable despite this not being one of the better kolsch beers out there. Not bad, just not very inspired. Would make a good hot day - lawnmower beer though."
"D - I wouldn't want to drink it again"
"Overall impression: Not the most exciting beer out there, but its highly drinkable and has some nice flavors."
"Taste: White grapes, finishes with a mild hop bitterness."
"overall, very impressed once i started to drink this beer..."
"Mouth is rather carbonated and fizzy. On the lighter side with a quick, crisp finish. Goes down pretty easy."
""
"Pretty one-dimensional. A PBR could do the same trick at less than 1/2 the price."
"Drinks quickly, this style is definitely in the realm of sessionable."
"M/D - thin but right on for the style"
"Don't drink and review."
"Purchased as part of a 12 pack of New Holland seasonals. A very tasty, easy to drink brew. Had very little carbonation when poured into a pint glass with only a few lingering bubbles. Mouthfeel is mostly smooth which in my opion make it very drinkable in warmer weather. Here again though a solid beer not one I would seek out to drink a lot of."
"I am not going to lie, I don't care for New Holland or Kolsch beers. But, my low marks arn't based on those two facts alone. This is just a marginal beer overall. Has a bit more flavor than the typical marco lagers, but is much more flat and has a bigger body, making this a less desireable option in the summer heat. Not the best."
"Pours a straw yellow with a small white head. A nice crisp clear color. Smell is light malt and some yeast notes. The taste is refreshing with some malt flavor and nice depth. A subtle aftertaste that encourages another sip. The mouthfeel is very smooth, nice flavor balance and great carbonation. This is a very enjoyable beer, easy to drink, refreshing for the summer."
"The flavor struck me as somewhat soapy at one time, not as much this tasting. The hops are somewhat on the assertive side, nice bitter bite to it. The tiniest bit of malt tries to break through and lend something else - grapefruit? - but maybe comes up just short. A nice dry finish though, crisp and clean to the end."
"This is a great craft version of the mass produced beers by the big three. Could easily drink this all night."
"Thin white head of mixed bubble sizes, doesn't really matter since it's not around long, no lacing either. Very pale, washed out orange to yellow color, has just enough haze that the transparency is not of water, nothing special to look at. Bready with a little saltiness too but not like a pretzel, maybe peppery at times, then a hard caramel candy sweetness breezes through, no real presence of citrus nor fruit, light apricot or pear perhaps, it's not that it's absent in your nostrils, more that it's ""not there."" Medium-bodied, smooth and evenly balanced, no bumps in the road. But this could be attributable to the cleanliness of the hops, no bite nor grass, yeast or citric verve. The carbonation is consistent, more prickle than foam, lends itself to an airy feel. Rye bread comes through nicely. Nice stuff, high drinkability although you won't blow out any brain cells figuring it out."
"A good summer beer. We had this while sitting on the back patio enjoying some nice summer weather. Golden color with big malt aroma. I found the taste to be very malty and bread like. It is crisp and nicely carbonated. Very easy to drink this beer, especially with food and on a warmer day. Not a huge fan of Kolsch and have had a few I like better but this is good."
"Drinkability- Another good summer brew. Would be a good session beer if it had a little more character."
"Not the best Kolsch out there but it's definitely not a bad beer either. Would be a good summer beer."
"Drinkable enough as a style, but there's really not anything drawing me to this beer. It's easy to drink, but not interesting to any degree, and thus leaves in me no desire to continue drinking."
"A light golden straw color pour with a HUGE white head,fizzy carbonation with some spotty lacing left. Aroma is of light hops,lightly toasted malt,and hints of white grape. Flavor is slightly fruity,a little more malt than expected,some fruity lightly spicy hops,faint white grapes,hints of honey,very good balance, clean mouthfeel,slightly dry finish, with a long viny,lightly bitter aftertaste, very sessionable and a good smooth drinker."
"Purchased from Three Cellars in Franklin, WI. This beer pours a light and hazy straw color with a thin white head. I noticed some brown yeast chunks floating around; not very appealing. Lemony tea-like aroma. Light bodied, not much malt character, hops detectable in the finish. This really reminds me of Heineken. No bonus points there."
"Mouthfeel is nice and crisp. Decent creaminess in there too. This is pleasant to drink. Flavor is malty with just a kiss of hop bitterness on the finish. Slightly watery which tames this a bit, but I'm really digging this style the more and more I have it."
"D: Other than the chunks of shit ( not floaters, but 2 bb sized turds), was big time drinkable."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into my Boulevard Smokestack goblet. This beer pours a hazy, mellow straw with a 2 inch head that lacks in the retention arena. Very, very little lacing occurs as the beer recedes. Just a thin circle of head sticks around the inside of the glass. The aroma is slightly grainy, with fruity esters giving away notes of ripe apples and sweet berries. Just a hint of floral hops comes through in the tail of the aroma. The flavor is just as straight forward as the nose. A slight grainy appeal comes through up front with strawberries (weird I know) and apples, a bit of grass and just a wee bit of yeasty biscuits. The mouthfeel is light and leaves just a faint sweetness on the palate. Kolsch's are the Craft beer industry's answer to light, crisp, American Macro Lagers. I wish more people would really appreciate a good Kolsch when they see one."
"12 oz. bottle. Pours a golden-yellow color with a small and quickly diminishing head, no lacing. Aroma is mainly pale malts, straw, bread, and a hint of hops. Flavor is crisp, similar to aroma, caramel malts, bread, and a touch of spicy hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is light, smooth, crisp, and finishes with a twinge of bitterness. Good for the style, but not much substance. Still a decent beer."
"Na Zdravje!"
"Drinkability is top notch. While this stuff is a bit pricey, it's certainly worth it to grab a few and drink amongst your friends. This is another awesome New Holland brew and I'm looking forward to more in the future."
"This is a great summer quencher that will be in the rotation as long as I can get it. True to style & the ABV is well hidden"
"Poured into a glass for a tad cloudy yellow with good carbonation and a quality head. Picked up some hoppy notes that were less citric and more akin to figs/grape and some caramel and syrupy malts in there (bittersweetness). This beer is light-bodied and easy drinking but damn enjoyable. It is smooth and slightly creamy with a tea-like hop bitterness on the tongue that belies a sweet, fruity taste on the backend and yet still finishes dry and slightly smoke from some roasted malts. A quality beer and a big shout out to that bartender for that recommendation."
"On-tap at Flying Saucer served a crisp straw yellow with a thin off-white head that diminishes to a thin layer and leaves slight lacing. Aroma was a bit of sweet malts and earthy hops. The taste is a surprising blend of crisp Earthy hops, sweet malts and sweet fruits, I'm not the biggest fan of the style, but this one is very enjoyable. The beer quite light and crisp with just enough carbonation to provide nice refreshment. This one was surprising, one I would definitely have again."
"Cheers!!"
"Typical hint of lager malt in the aroma. Light and delicate, like the quaff. Just a bit of hops to balance it out and remove any sweetness in the finish. A decent brew, this would be a nice session brew in the summer heat. The kolsch's are the kissing cousin of the pilsner lager, but with more body and hop bite - drink up."
"Poured with a smallish white head and no lace until I tipped the glass to drink - and then not a lot. Beery, grainy, grassy, aroma. Taste is similar, but I also picked up at different points bitter and sweet. A little malt. Body's a tad soft. Very easy drinking; decent finish. Could be a session brew. Not great; not bad. Eh."
"Light amber color with little white head. There was not much lacing.I thought is had somewhat of a malt smell, also maybe a little grainy. Noat a very overpowering tasting beer. It goes down smooth. Crisp with a lot of carbonation Not a bad tasting beer. Would drink again."
"This is very quaffable. An admirable effort in brewing and well worth a try."
"The pour was nice enough. Light yellow in color with a nice head of white on top that faded gently into a thin veil that left the top bare after just a few minutes. Light bready notes and some grains in the smell, a bit light for me, without that top notch banana aroma you would see in a really good version of the style. Smooth mellow flavor, albeit light. Even and well balaned with a light bready note and a touch of light grassy notes towards the end. Smooth and easy drinking as this one went down effortlessly into the night. I would have no issue at all with trying this one again any day. Solid beer for the hot weather i would imagine."
"Final Thought: Reminds me of Avery's 15th Anniversary Ale (American Wild Ale) but a little lighter; creative effort nonetheless!"
"Blipped ""Width of a Circle"" by David Bowie"
"D - A good session brew for warmer weather. Good stuff for putting out hot-wing fires in the mouth too."
"Nice refreshing beer, great drinkability. Not a bad beer at all, certainly one I wouldn't turn away from."
"Out of a variety case from Shangy's. This beer is incredibly drinkable, and it can disappear quickly if you're not paying attention. The issue with it, however, is that its a bit too plain. I might wonder if the brewers used a too-clean American yeast strain instead of the proper German one. There's just a light layer of whole-grain bready malts with a hit of peppery/earthy hops at the end. Not a lot going on, but still satisfying and drinkable. A decent summer session ale I suppose."
"Pours a clear light gold with a small white head. Subdued aromas of honey, flowers, a faint grassy hoppiness. Light on the palate, leaves a very small footprint, nothings offends. Lightly sweet hops are well balanced by a light zestiness. It's remarkably bright and crisp and goes down very easy. This beer is very simple and yet verges on perfection: with simple styles like kolsch, even one minor flaw will stick out like a sore thumb. Nicely done. This would be an excellent warm weather beach beer."
"D - Like most Kolsch style ales, this is very easy drinking. It'd be great on a warm summer night."
"Pours a pale yellow color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Poor retention and poor lacing. Smells of tart malt, grass, and some slight nut flavor. Fits the style of a Kolsch. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with a high carbonation level. Tastes of grass up front, then some tart malt, the hop bitterness is in the background, and a strong dryness is associated with each drink. Overall, a fairly typical Kolsch."
"A very pleasant, inoffensive and downright drinkable brew. A sixer of this on a hot day is a no-brainer. Not the best Kölsch I've had, but I would certainly never turn one down. I'll have to get some more when the weather warms up."
"Flavor starts with a bubbly, semi-bland profile before giving way to pleasant notes of honey-biscuit malts, bitter hops, and spiced wheat. Fairly accurate for the style, but some of the flavors could come across as more pronounced, in my opinion. Spritzy and clean, the mouthfeel delivers a crisp body that finishes with a kiss of hops and metal, but ultimately smooths things out. Don't get me wrong--I like this beer--but there are a few things that could stand to be hammered out to allow this brew to come ""full circle"" (couldn't resist)."
"D-This kolsch has a nice flavor profile, tasting great overall while being quite appropriate to style. Well balanced. Would make a great compliment to a hot afternoon sitting on my porch."
"Pours a bright and clean straw yellow, could probably pass this off as an undercarbonated Bud to someone, though with a better looking head and long lasting retention, oh yeah but it smells a lot different. It smells nice an clean, slightest bit of mixed spices: coriander, heather and cinnamon are the most apparent, then comes the grainy bready goodness. Not really any hop character from what I can tell, though this changes slightly after the first few sips. Beer opens fresh and clean with a crisp, pale malt edging its way across my pallet, then the beer begins to open up, a nice complexity begins to develop. Noble hop bitterness tickles the tongue ever so slightly and leaves a strong vinious finsish that lasts until the next sip of beer washes it gently away. I think that this beer could be a little more filled out, has a bit of buttery apple taste that I could do without, but otherwise is a very drinkable beer, not to mention tasty, and could be enjoyed at any time of the year, not just in summer or on thanksgiving as it happens to be today."
"Drinkability- Overall this is a very drinkable, sessionable beer. As for a Kölsh, it seems a bit ""aggressive"" (for lack of a better term to describe such a light brew) but is tasty none-the-less. Pretty good beer that I could drink on a regular basis."
"I really enjoy this beer and plan on throwing it into the ""regulars"" lineup... Along with Two-Hearted, and Brooklyn Lager. THAT'S how much I like this."
"I could drink more of these, although it wouldn't be something that I would really always look for since there are more 'exotic' beers out there-but it would definitely be something that I would recommend to others."
"D- This beer is light and smooth but has a nice balance to the sulfury notes and grain and hops. The hops have a nice little depth to them. This beer has that specific Kolsch quality that I can't really put into words but it is like a sweet sulfur note which most attemps are lacking."
"D - Good beer but nothing special. It's hard to measure a good Kolsch because it is such a simple beer."
"D - Fairly well balanced in flavour but maybe a touch on the bitter side. Easy drinking."
"D: An exceedingly drinkable kolsch lager that was a very good accompaniment to the pepperoni and green pepper pizza. I like the -on-tap version better than the bottle version -- possibly because of the coldness of the service."
"A crisp and refreshing beer that is simple and satisfying. Good all-around balance and taste."
"Washed down food just fine, but doesn't really stand out."
"D - this was a refreshing kolsch summer beer. Glad I was able to try this."
"-Oelergud"
"light to mid body. enough carbonation. good warm weather beer. could do session. might drink again."
"An okay beer. I feel this one didn't have the smoothless that I like in a Kolsch, and it seemed a bit acerbic."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: This is one I'll definitely come back to. I'll take it over any other kolsch I've drank to date. Light in body and very refreshing this one is one that goes down very easily. Semi-dry finish, not quite as dry as the Curve Ball."
"Pale straw, with some slight haze. Nice thick creamy head, dissapates quickly. Thin lace circles glass. Pale biscuit malts, herbal hops and slight citrus aromas. Sweet dry buscuity malts dominate upfront, some light grassy hops mingle and it finishes with a slight citrus note. The hops come more to forefront as this warms. Liking this with less chill. Carbonation is somewhat subdued. Light and crisp on the palate. Very easy drinking, perfect for this evening after mowing the lawn. Nicely done Kolsch."
"Drinkability: could drink a sixer in a night easity....doesn't wear out the palate and doesn't fill you up"
"Drinkability: A pretty flavorful version of the style overall, which gets a bit hoppier as it warms, interestingly enough. I only got a bottle of this, but I could see myself buying it again."
"Pours a hazy golden with little to no head. Very little lacing is left on the glass. The aroma has floral hops and a grainy quality. Has a light taste of pale malt, crackers, with a faint bitterness. The carbonation seems flat with my sample. Light body with a crisp flavor. It is easy drinking and refreshing. Not a great Kolsch but a respectable effort."
"I'm not a big fan of the style, and this beer doesn't change that. Pretty mediocre."
"Overall- A big letdown from a brewery that usually doesn't disappoint. This 1 just has little to no flavor or bite, avoid."
"Pours hazy golden in color with a creamy white head. Fairly clean aroma consisting of bready malt and a floral hoppiness. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied and soft with a pleasant carbonation. Like the nose, the first sip offers a nice bread-like maltiness. Moderate bitterness from the hops. There also seems to be a light spiciness present. Overall, pretty clean and easy to drink."
"Pours a very light, thin, and somewhat spongey head with a very clear golden yellow, almost pilsner like hue. The aroma is pilsner like malt and grassy hop mix. Very light arom overall. The taste is a bit bland, with some very dry pilsner malts and a few very faint earthy hops. Very light on the palate with a brisk hop profile. Just the right thing for Summer."
"A pretty decent Kolsch that drinks well enough for what it is and benefits the summer weather."
"Appearance is slightly hazy straw-gold with a rocky off-white head that dissipates quickly but lingers on the edge of the glass. Aroma has some awesome noble hop but German malt dominates the glass. Same for the taste but the hop and malt seem to dance with each other nicely. There's some mineral quality to the water here that leaves a bit of a carbonic bite on the tongue but it's not overcarbonated. This beer goes down smooth and is quite refreshing. I definately will seek this one out again."
"Overall: Not bad. Drinkable with some nice hop flavor and bitterness. I'd drink this again if it were available."
"Full Circle is a nice spring/summer sessioner."
"Could be refreshing on a hot day, especially with its poundable thinness of being. Seems quintessentially Summery."
"Drinkability: This beer is easily enjoyable when you want a refreshing, but not complex beer. It is refreshing, better than many, but not quite at the level of a true Germany pilsner. Either way, though, a definite beer to try from New Holland."
"D: Not bad. A possible session brew from New Holland. Worth trying."
"A peculiar beer, but I've had better pilsners. I'll pass on going ""Full Circle"" with this one. Move along, people..."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a very clear golden-orange with a huge pillowy head that leaves nice bits of lacing around the glass. Smell is primarily of hops; grapefruit, pine and juniper. Taste is like the nose, with a smooth malty finish and slightly bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is very light with velvety carbonation. This is a very drinkable beer, given its light body and smooth character I could drink more than a few of these! Best Pils I've ever had, nice job New Holland."
"Drank this from a 12 oz bottle with no freshness date on it. Pours a standard Pilsner look: golden straw color with a thin white head. Smells fresh and crisp: light barley, citrus and floral hops. Nice light-bodied taste with good hoppiness. The single malt and single hops really come through, and I like it. Fine example of the Pilsner style. Taste starts sweet and travels nicely to a good hoppy finish. Thin mouthfeel. Easily drinkable beer. If you love Pilsners, check this one out."
"Originally reviewed on August 7, 2006. 12 Oz Bottle. Gusher! Pours with a clear yellow pallor, quite thin. Six inches of rocky off-white head climb my glass and streak the sides with broken panes of lace. Aroma is an almost wrenching waft of sickly sour malt and aged grains. Hay and lemons left in the bottom of corona bottles are elicted. On the tongue, a surprising whack of heavy sweetness and certain sourness, but staying within the lager spectrum. I have to give them points for providing flavor in a beer this shade and style. Honestly, this is reminiscent of a Berliner Weisse, somehow. The Sour Patch kid tang draws a breath of lemon and light grain. There are no infected tones, or off-flavors. Just a potent sweet-sour attack. Hops are too laid back, this should have a gentle hopping bite to balance. All thats left on my tongue is a distant green apple skin. Okay, in some level of retrospect, theres definately some errant Brett in here."
"Appears a cloudy copper golden hue with a large heavily carbonated off white hed leves nice even lacing iwth eacch sip. Aroma...this beer utilizes a single malt and hop I'm getting alot of citrus notes iwth some bisucuit malt sweetness sharp acidity. Taste has some raw unrefined bitterness going on with subtle malt sweetness as well as some grainy off flavors. Mild biscuit and heavy grassy citrus peel roughness as it warms more sweetness balances out the harsh bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied highly carbonated definitely some bottling issues on this one. Drinkability is rough overall decently flavorful but lacks cohesiveness overall not a beer I would drink regularly."
"Poured into pilsner glass,nice golden color,dense white head,slightly cloudy.Grassy,slight sweet smell,not much hpo aroma.Has a grainy,bready,taste. Lots of carbination.a sharp bitter finish that creeps up on you A light to medium body, don't think I could drink a lot of these."
"Great stuff."
"A simple beer, with plenty of flavor, yet made to drink plenty of in the height of summer."
"A great beer to drink after a round of frisbee golf on a great spring day in Michigan,poured a dull light golden with a well formed one finger white head that was gone pretty fast.Lighter lemon aromas along with some toasted grain pretty standard of a good lager,flavors were ice with a sturdy mouthfeel pretty grainy with notes of lightly toasted grain and even light lemon pith finishing with just a hint of peppery hop.Hey a no frills ""sturdy"" American lager some of my buddies who are learning the way of craft beer were really digging this brew and I found it refreshing and not dull,a nice local made beer."
"Sampled 12 oz bottle 11-02-05. The pour was of a nice gold to light copper color capped with a white head head that is of medium thickness but leaves a beautiful lace on the side of the glass as it disipates. Nose is nice, slight fruit backed up by straight forward malt. Mouthfeel is dry almost instantly, flavor is of malt and slight grass with balanced hop. Very crisp, clean and leaves a nice aftertaste."
"This used to be much better. I need to stop buying it, but I remeber such a wonderfully dry pils flavor!"
"The taste is malty with some grass and slight lemon notes followed by enough hop bite to give it balance. Not very crisp but it does finish clean with some lingering bitterness. The mouth is a tad thin. Good session brew."
"Yet another fine brew from the folks at New Holland Brewing Company. Keep up the great work!!"
"If you like this style, this is a very decent effort and closest to the pils that I've had in microbrews, but for me personally, I'd get a pale."
"Thanks to sopor for the bottle."
"Drinkability is very good. The light appeal makes this utterly drinkable and the taste is good enough to justify another. This could be sessioned on by most. Mass appeal potential given the current big market brews of the day."
"Poured with a huge billowing white head that dissipated quickly to leave a nice film. A ton of cabonation bubbles in this clear yellow brew. Smell is simple malt with a little bit of hay. Taste is also very simple but not bland. I believe this is the first single malt i've ever had. Pretty much what you would expect, nothing spectacular but also no flaws. Mounthfeel is light and drinkability is good. Certainly dosnt' live up to pils like Prima but also not a bad beer."
"This beer poured a clear golden with a white head that disappeared fairly fast. The aroma is grainy with some saaz-like hop notes. The taste is crisp with a perfect hop addition to a light malt flavor. Good mouthfeel. Light to medium bodied beer with moderate carbonation. A good drinkable beer."
"Pours a clear gold with a small head that left a very nice lace. Sweet and citric nose. The flavor has a big snap from the hops, with a nice carmel malty sweetness to back it up. Very citric, grapefruity hop character lasts into the finish. Nice, flavorful pils, but the bitter citrus becomes cloying if I have more than a few."
"This beer pours a nice clear straw color with a finger head that falls to a light coating over the brew. The nose is pretty nice. There is a light malty sweetness, but what prevails is the spicey and crisp hop. I like it. The flavor is not too bad either. Very spicey from the hop. I really like this hop. I'll have to find out what it is. There is a slight graineyness on the finish. I enjoy this beer. The feel is moderate with a moderatea carbonation. I could see myself sitting down to this brew after a hot day in the sun. It would quench and nice. Well above average on this one."
"Pours a very clear yellow color with a small head that is gone before you can blink. Leaves very little lacing on the glass. The aroma is slightly grainy with a little spice from the hop. Smells like a lager. Flavor has a solid caramel taste with a little bit of hop character, but very basic. The body is light but not really light and the drinkability is pretty good. This beer is pretty good for a single malt, single hop beer, but it's just run of the mill overall."
"Cloudy dark apricot with slightly sticky head, fine table of bubbles stubbornly remains. Nose is pine resin and grandma's perfume. Nice combination of malt and hop bite on the tongue, really coats the mouth with resiny goodness. This is very drinkable sessionable brew."
"Pours a hazy golden-straw with a nice fizzy white head that leaves some lacing in my glass. Flowery and grassy aromas, bready cracker like flavors. Light bodied with a crisp and carbonated mouthfeel, finishes dry and bitter. I must have gotten a really fresh bottle, this is a damn nice beer."
"My Goshh!!!! This was one of the hardest beers to pour. No matter how slow I poured I just got this massive foamy head. The head resembled more of something you'd see from a ginger ale float. This was from a sampler pack but every one of the Full Circle's poured this way. Having this massive foamy head of course yielded some unbelievable lacing (eventually). There was lots of carbonation also, so maybe there was too much which caused the excessive head. Anyways, the color was a medium yellow color and just a tad cloudy. Aroma of wet wood, light grassy hops, yeast and that common pilsener smell. Taste was dominantly hoppy with sweet malts coming through half way and ending with a bitter aftertaste that lingers and somewhat floral. Mouthfeel was as you could guess foamy. I like the beer, but it would be annoying to try and pour another."
"There's not much too this beer, so it's easy to drink a lot of it. This would be a great crossover beer."
"12 oz bottle obtained in a trade with ""trbeer"" in December 2004. Served just below cellar temperature. Pours a very light blonde color (looks like a macro-swill) with a rich and fluffy 2 finger head that is nearly clear. Smells of an earthy hop and a gentle sweet malt. Soft and flowery with a touch of honey. A honey flavored sweet and clean malt flavor carries throughout and is, at times, over-run with a mild hop bitter. I get some canteloupe (actually, I think it's called muskmelon...you know, the melon with orange flesh). The hops are a bit rough at times with some metalic hints in the aftertaste. An interesting play with the mild and fine carbonation that forms on the tongue and the light body. Some lacing has stuck to the side of the glass and a noticable layer of pristine fine head remains. A bit to much hop bitter for me to drink 6 in a row, but still a nice session beer. Thanks trbeer!"
"Simple, pure, and fresh."
"Hazy light golden appearance. Thin dirty white head. Lace is minimal. Aroma's grassy, leafy and spicy. A little herbal as well. On the palate, clean maltiness. But also a mild bitter hop bite. Seems to be Saaz. A little peppery and lemony. Hop taste is nice. A little grassy. And a little flowery. Body is about medium-full and the carbonation is fitting. Pretty decent brew."
"As far as a pilsener is concerned, this is pretty darn good but I don't think it's really a pilsener. I'll certainly have this again and recommend it to any lager drinker looking for more taste."
"Zum wohl!"
"The clear golden body is Pilsener all the way, as is the nice tall head of white foam. Good lacing effect from the substantial head. The aroma is of malt and Saaz hops which are also found in the flavor. The taste is nicely robust with no hints of adjunct grains being noticed. The mouthfeel is very good with nice crispness in the finish. A very drinkable Pilsener-style from this respected Michigan brewer."
"New Holland's Full Circle Single Malt Beer (is it an ale or a lager?) appears to be a moderate to low-gravity golden lager (ale?) with a decent splash of leafy and floral hops thrown in for ballast. Its clear golden body and thin white head are not particularly distinguishable from any American lager or European pilsner; nor is its aroma. It offers a generic ""beer"" aroma with a clean combination of grainy malt and sublime hops - no yeasty esters are found. It's crisp in the mouth with a light bordering on medium body and fine-bubbled, median carbonation. The flavor reveals that there IS some malt present, and apparently little to no adjunct. And hops are represented as well. Delicately spicy and mildly leafy/herbal in taste, the hops balance the malt exquisitely; and even replicate the flavor of some very decent European pilsners. I'm not sure why they went with the ""single malt"" branding, because it seems to be coinfusing. This is a very well done European-style beer. It's really well balanced with a good malt character and solid hop backbone. And again, New Holland delivers an excellent session beer!"
"Clear golden with a big white head of foam, that lasts and leaves nice lacing. Aromas of fresh saaz hops, and some simple malts. The taste is bready and a bit malty with super fresh, sharp hops as well. The aftertaste is reminiscent of biscuits and crisps. The mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing and the drinkability is awesome! A fine, fine pils!"
"The beer pours a golden color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a very nice pale malt scent with a bitter hop aroma. The taste is decent. It has a basic, yet refreshing pale malt flavor and a citrus hop finish that tastes a bit like grapefruit. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a good single malt. It's light and has decent flavor."
"Poured a very happy bright and sunny yellow in color with a fizzy and all-too-short white head that barely manages to live at the edges of the glass. Expected grain-like aroma and flavor. The single malt and single hop ingredients dance together nicely and make for a well-balanced flavor. Somewhat dry at the finish. Surprisingly full mouthfeel and hugely drinkable. For ""fizzy yellow beer", this is damn good."
"This beer poured a cloudy yellow color and formed a foamy white head that faded quickly coating the glass with circular lace. A small amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of pils type of malt and some background hops with hints of grain. A sprite taste of malt, and grain. The finish is a touch astrigent with a slight salty aspect. Not a bad beer, but not one of their best."
"As a full on beer geek, I am a little leery when a beer label brags about using a single solitary hop and just one malt. However this beer is not too bad at all, despite its simplicity. Pours a pale golden color with a miniscule off-white head. Thin lacing. Ther aroma is lightly hoppy with a pinch of citrus. Light-bodied and dry, with a back-to-basics hops and malt profile that is a refreshing flavor. There is also a tiny bit of fruitiness. The finish is crisp and dry. This beer wont win any awards but I appreciate a straightforward easy-drinking beer that actually has flavor any day."
"Starts with a nice white billowing head. The lace remained throughout the whole glass. It had a slight haze in its straw colored body, not cloudy, but not crystal clear. Carbonation is plentiful and the body is light. I noticed a slight lemon zest flavor on first taste. The bitterness while not overwhelming was still almost puckering. It definately lingers. I might give this beer a second chance some time down the road."
"hazy golden color of apple-juice. small, bright white foam retreats to a small collar. small patches of lace here and there. toasted malt and european noble hop aroma. ever so slight hint of ale-ish fruitiness. lively carbonation, light to medium bodied...well put together. light fruit and grain flavor gives way to an assertive european hop bite. the pale fruit flavor comes out more as it warms. quenching and seriously quaffable if you're amenable to that pilsner hop bite. reminds me of a tame version of prima pils, which is not a bad thing. they all can't be number one."
"Nice light, bright white, head sits atop a slightly hazy, golden sunshine colored beer. Mild aroma, a bit of grassy hops and some light malt. Easy drinking, light bodied, refreshing beer. Light grainy base, mostly light citrusy (lemon) and skunky bitter hops in the flavor. Not a whole lot going on with the beer, but there's enough and it's solid."
"This single malt beer pours a dark golden with a frothy head that quickly dissapates into a light ring with some large bubbles in it. The aroma is that of a standard american brew, but the deeper and longer you smell it, I get the scent of fruit cup. Little hoppy but very balanced in general. Smooth taste, but yet very carbinated in your mouth. Not heavy or cloying. Fairly dry, great as a session beer. The label says everyone can enjoy it, well, I totally agree with them."
"big thanks to ngandhi for this one!"
"The nose is an oscillating figure of stemmy, woody hops and cornbread. On the palate it is rich, buttery and loaded with crusty bread maltiness together with noble, polished bitterness. The finish is long with minty, overextracted herb astringency and a pleasant, sunny warmth. Big and chewy for a Pils, with a respectable counterbalance of bitterness. Think Baltic Pilsner meets Left Coast."
"This poured a clear and bright golden straw color and topped off with a this, but lively white head of foam. The aroma yields pleasing lemony and grassy grains. Smells crisp like a pilsner along with some fruity citrus hop notes. The taste is clean, plain and light without any harshness. Finishes somewhat crisp and has a light to medium grainy malt body. Overall, quite light, tasty and very easy to drink. Thanks to trbeer for this one."
"Overall, a solid lager that's brewed with a single malt and single hop variety. Thanks to AKSmokedPorter for the bottle!"
"All in all, a wonderful domestic example of a German/Czech/Euro style pils. Very, very drinkable and well-crafted. Yum."
"Thanks to trbeer for the sample. Well, certainly not one that lacks carbonation...took several pours to pour into the pint glass. Still, a good quality pilsner, comparable to Penn, and one that I'd have again."
"Good beer, nothing spectacular, but a good quality drinkable beer."
"I'm impressed."
"This brewery had irritated me in the paste with some pretty cocky labels. Some of their beers live up to their labels but others don't. This one lives up to billing. I have yet to have a Pilsener style beer that has near the depth of this one. It has the spicy hoppiness that Victory's Prima Pils does, but it really has a much better maltiness to it. I highly recommend."
"Drinkability is very high, really made to be a good summer session beer."
"Poured blond with a long lasting white head. Nice spicy noble hop aroma and slightly sweet husky malts. Crisp, bitter beginning, well-rounded middle as the ""malt"" kicks in, falls a little thin at the end. Overall, though, it remeinded me of why I sought after Saaz-type beers before the ""doulbe-this"" and ""extreme-that""s started hitting the shelf."
"ng"
"Pours your average slightly amber yellow.Theres not a lot of aroma malt or hops.Says it uses a single malt and a single hop.I dont get much of either.Pretty standard taste with neither malt or hops dominating.I have had the Saranac single malt which is a big improvement.Nothing special here."
"This is heralded as a single malt beer like that's something special. It sounded like a novel idea. But now I know why more breweries don't do this. This beer was flat out not that good. Very simple taste with a light body. Malt is too weak but so are the hops and they're not that good either. Finsihes with an oily sickness. Slightly better than macro lagers, but only slightly."
"Full Circle: A single malt beer. Apparently they used one single malt: Busy SOB (snort). Anyhow, a hazy golden color, under a white head that turns to skim fairly quickly. Sticky lace. Fruity/hop flavor, fruits first, hop later. Considerable hop profile in this beer, actually more than I had anticipated. Several sips do not overturn my initial taste. Oily, slick hop aftertaste. Hop heads, buy it."
"01-23-05 (re-review): This time it pours out to a slightly hazy light golden, forming a rocky white head with excellent retention and lacing. The aroma now doesn't have the kiwi note, and is absolutely true to the Pilsner style with freshly mown hay and delicate Saaz hops. The mouthfeel is fresh and crisp with a light body. The taste is soft with pale malts nicely balanced with Saaz bitterness and floral notes in the finish. Cleanly fermented. Much better than the previous Full Circle I've had."
"Fruit salad bouquet of lemons, oranges, strawberries, and kiwi on a wafer thin slice of pound cake. Subdued malt spine works hard to keep up with a sharp spread of citric hops. A nice golden, effervescent session brew when the mood calls. Always a pleasure to taste a blonde with a little character."
