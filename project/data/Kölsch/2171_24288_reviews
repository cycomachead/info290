"If I don't feel like going to Total Wine and More to buy Gaffel Kölsch, then this what I buy. Very good Kölsch-Style brew, and its local."

"Overall this is a very nice light beer made for the brutal Arizona summers.  Definitely worthy of a try."

"A very good Kolsch Style beer. Would recommend trying Sunbru."

"Feels alright. Somewhat thin. Mild carb."

"Overall: Not much to talk about here but a refreshing quencher for the hot days in Arizona, no doubt"

"Golden hay colored with a little haze, topped with a head which retains decently, leaving spotty lace around the walls of the glass. The aroma is grainy, hay, a kiss of fruit, simple and straightforward. The flavor is as well, though it meets the standard for a kolsch. It's crisp and clean with hay and a snap of hops, done in a way where it's flavorful as well. It's light bodied and very refreshing, pushing the beer on course as a Kolsch-styled beer that I would recommended."

"It's a pretty decent kolsch and an easy drinker."
"Poured a nice clear gold with a thin ring of nice white head. Beautiful German lager appearance. Scents of German yeast, some hoppy notes and crystal malt. What I expect in a kolsch. Flavor is malty sweet, good crystal malt sweetness and bready flavors, this is balanced with a nice German hop presence which keeps it from being too sweet and bready. Quite nice. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation, easy to drink, nice and refreshing. This is a good kolsch, worth drinking. It's one of the better Four Peaks offerings, behind their stout and IPA."

"An alright tasting lighter beer, I'd like to have a cooler full of these on a really hot summers day, whether I being golfing, fishing, or just kickin' back."

"D - A surprisingly nice kolsch for an American brewery. The malt character is rich and balances well on the finish."

"Easily in my top three favorites of the Four Peaks brews, the Sunbru is great from the tap or a can. It has a lighter yellow appearance, and and the flavor this beer packs is tough to rival. The sharp citrus flavor along with the light feel of this beer make it tough kolsch to rival."
"Clarity is fine; pale golden color. Smells of fermented pears, fresh-baked crackers and light floral hops. Malt palate is near immaculate and intensely smooth. Mild bite of apple within, but the dry graininess is the real show here. Balance from the hops with a pinch of flavor in the finish. Long dry finish, the aftertaste is very clean, which makes this beer extremely refreshing ... the taste buds ask for another sip. Nailed it for the style, and nailed it for being so damn drinkable."

"Update 06/30/2013: From the 12 oz can, it never occurred to me this was supposed to be a Kölsch, since it's missing anything like perfumey aromas and hops. Aroma of damp grain and a slight doughy taste. Totally inoffensive light lager, however. The can says 5.1%."
"The Crack & Glug was a welcome relief from all of the bottles that I was opening at my aunt & uncle's place last week! I had a fizzy finger of bone-white head that exited like the place was on fire and it was a cool evening (finally), following some much-needed rain. Color was a pale lemon-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Greg Koch beer for sure! Nose had a lemon zesty-citrus quality and I was ready to drink. Mouthfeel was medium and between the biscuit malt and the lemon zest, I could have closed my eyes and envisioned biting into a lemon tart. I am not big on sweets as a general rule and I usually eschew chocolate, but when a lemon or cherry tart is offered up, I am the first in line. This beer really played its strengths to my weaknesses. Finish was more lemony than malty, but that is not to say that it was sour or in any way overbearing. This would be an excellent CANdidate for the cooler for mowing the lawn or heading for the beach and I will make a note of it. Yum!"
"Good drinkable beer. SOmething to enjoy with friends on a night out,"
"o - not as lively and bright as a kolsch should be."
"Overall - an enjoyable beer, clean, but not quite up to snuff style wise."
"4/3/3.5/4/4"
"So crisp and fairly flavorful for such a light beer, SunBru would be good for a summer day."
"Can. Poured into a tall Allagash glass a slightly hazed straw golden color with a bone white 1 finger head. Head recedes slowly and leaves some lace. A sweet cereal type note in the nose along with some lemon zest and white grape. Light mouthfeel with some carbonation. Starts lightly sweet and moves to a drawn out lingering bitterness. It's a light drinking beer that is easy to drink. Overall, probably a good summertime beer. Seems this is a tough style to emulate here in the states but I would drink this again on a hot day."
"D: A mediocre example of a kölsch. I don't see myself revisiting this brew."
"Pours a very clean light yellow color with a big white head that is quite bubbly and leaves a bit of lacing. The nose is quite plain with just a bit of grain. Plain, but fairly average for a kolsch. Taste is pretty gross and somewhat teeth. This goes along with a bit of light grain. Feel is quite light and semi-offensive. Drinkability is poor and a few ounces was quite enough for me."
"D- this beer would be a good one to sit with some friends and kickback on a hot day. I can almost tell that the flavor would change dramatically with the outside temperature."
"D - A very drinkable beer. Especially on a hot summer day. These go down quickly! I shared a 12 pack with some friends. I would purchase again for sure."
"Beer is light and has a grainy edge to it. Mildly sweet, pilsen malt up front, its medium to light in body and has a wet finish. Well, congratulations it's a kolsch. I'd have it again."
"The taste was faint. I would even go so far as to say it was a bar above flavorless. There were a few lemony hops and a mellow herbal-ness, not to mention it ended slightly bitter, but I think most of what I tasted was due in large part to the aroma as I had the glass to my mouth (aka: under my nose). It went past thin into watery, a place I thought I'd never toss a microbrew, and I was vaguely disappointed. I've come to expect better things from craft beers, but this one might be considered a novice beer for someone starting to get into microbrews - which was me a month ago. And I hate to say it, but a month ago, I probably would have gladly drank this beer without a second thought. I'm just glad I jumped in head first and never looked back, because I will not be picking this one up again. Sorry Four Peaks, I'll stick with your darker beers."
"Drinkability is great for a nice flavored clean Kolsch."
"Enjoyed on tap at the Scottsdale location (brewed in Tempe). Fresh smell, light yellow and very lacey. A mild bitterness. Hits the mark, as they mostly do,batting average rather than home run hitters, showing skill. Average mouthfeel. A good start, and nicely drinkable at lunchtime."
"D - I was in Arizona and granted it was only spring but it was hot (to me) and this was a perfect beer. Session defined."
"Herbal component is quite pronounced. Finish is dry & crisp."
"On tap at Nellos's in Mesa. Color is a pale yellow, with a very slight head. Aroma was very light, like you'd expect for a summer beer; some malt and maybe a bit of spice. Tasted lightly of malt, bread, and some bitter hops, leaving a strong bitter aftertaste. Fairly drinkable, but not as intense as some other Kolsch beers I've had. I miss Rio Salado's."
"Drank easy, but just a run of the mill Kolsch"
"D- Easy drinking and smooth at 5%abv, not much flavor or body, I am not a big fan of the style and would unlikely seek this out again in the future"
"as for drinkability, in the arizona summer this is great.. a great ""lawnmower beer"" for when it is 110 outside. This is refreshing and light. This would also be a great ""starter beer"" for someone trying to get into microbrews... i wouldn't travel to get it, but if someone handed me a glass i would drink it."
"A good starter beer, very easy to drink. I think this is just an slightly different version of their Fools Gold which is also an easy to drink starter beer. Sunbru is good for the non microbrew drinkers as an introduction to real beer. Light straw/gold color. Almost no hops. Some hop bitterness but appropriate for the style, a little bit more than a pilsner but not overpowering. Is a great lawn mower beer for the Arizona heat. Nice name."
"This beer sits a pale straw color in my glass. It is topped by a wispy pale colored head. The aroma is lightly spicy with hops and it has a grainy note to it as well as a bit of soft fruitiness. This beer, as expected, is quite light on the palate, and it quickly disappears after one takes a swallow. The taste is lightly spicy with a nice mellow herbal taste. This beer finishes with a bit of bitterness. This is certainly a well made light beer, just not what I am looking for in a beer. This beer is lightly balanced between hop flavor, bitterness, and a bit of malt with some fruity notes."
