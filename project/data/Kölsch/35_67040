The nose is all malt; grainy and fruity - apricots and pears. The taste reflects the same with a bit of peach showing through on the finish, could be a bit more balanced but not bad. Mouthfeel is medium to full in body with a minimal carbonation. Overall a good beer, worth a try if you can get your hands on some.","gmfessen","Aug 07, 2012"

This beer had great drinkability, it was very smooth, clean, and with just enough flavor to hold my attention, three or four of these on a hot summer day would be very nice, drinkable as hell. What I liked most about this beer was that it was good all around, simple, tasty, and clean. What I liked least about this beer was that it's only available in this mixed pack. if any of the beers in this mix pack are six pack worthy it is for sure this one. I would buy this beer on it's own, but for now I have to get the summer variety pack to get it, I recommend this to anyone looking for an easy drinking summertime beer. I have to say that I am impressed with this beer, I came into this expecting and average Kolsch and what I got was an above average Kolsch that is up there with some of the best I have tried of that style, but I think I like Short's Kolsch 45 a little more, but since this will be available all summer chances are I will be drinking more of this. Good job guys, you made one simple, clean, and very drinkable Kolsch, I like it.","StoutHunter","Jun 09, 2012"

It was a bright sunshine-yellow with NE-quality clarity and lots of bubbles like a poor man's lava lamp. Nose had a sweetish cereal-like quality, malty but not cloying, with an underlying perfume-like scent. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium and the taste was unlike any kolsch in my memory. It was semi-dry, which is standard, but it had a perfume-y sweetness that reminded me of herbal tea. Wild! The more I drank this beer, the more the semi-dry sweetness of the malt commingled with the flowery perfuminess of the Jasmine Sambac and I just could not reconcile this as a Kolsch. The finish was semi-dry and refreshing but I just kept thinking of it as more of a summer beer. Not bad, interesting, but should be a summer seasonal.","woodychandler","Nov 16, 2011"

A decent beer and glad I tried it.","jwhancher","Aug 24, 2011"

3.76,3.6,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, the beer pours a bright, light, watery golden yellow color. Very vibrant and crisp. A small, low profile white head. Lots of steady, small bubbled carbonation consistent throughout the beer. The nose is toasted oats, and a slight honey character, as well. There are hints of sour in the nose, also. The beer leaves a lacing along the glass while you drink. The flavors are rich and round, with a toasty character that borders on char, but goes great with the sweet honey undertone. The beer is only slightly hopped, but enough to keep it very crisp. The aftertaste is a tangy sweet, with a slick feeling to it. The finish remains slick, and watery, too, leaving a slight linger of sweet and spice. Not bad, overall. Great on a scorching summer day.","GarthDanielson","Aug 14, 2011"
3.65,0.6,3.5,3.5,4,3,3.5,"This beer pours a clear golden color with a finger of foamy white head that dissipated quickly but did leave some lacing on the way down. The aroma has notes of bready malt, floral and sweet honey notes. The taste starts sweet with honey, then has some bready flavors from the malt and finishes with the floral notes of jasmine mostly. The mouthfeel is a little cloying for my taste. Overall a pretty good kolsch.","csiewert","Aug 14, 2011"
3.65,0.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"D: A refreshing & pleasant drinking brew. Nicely different and characterful without straying too far from the style. People will either like the herbal touch or not. I find it quite alright and near perfect for some summer variety.","SickGnar","Aug 14, 2011"

Fairly easy drinking but not the best example of a kolsch I have had. Worth a try once but not something I would repeatedly go for.

Very mild bitterness lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and smooth mouthfeel.

Could use a little more malt to balance the front of the brew but I was surprisingly delighted with the overall complexity of this brew. Nice carbonation makes all the flavors pop.

The taste of this beer was very refreshing, great mouthfeel and light in body. Perfect summer beer for someone looking for a nice alternative to American Lager. Nice malt base, some spiciness that quite can't put my finger on. The finish has traces of floral hops and it finish's dry- encouraging me to follow up with another gulp.

I don't know if SA wants to stay traditional but there has to be more refreshing, light styles that have a little more hops than usual. There's no reason why Pale Ale can't be brewed all year, it beats Cherry Wheat for sure. We'll see how the Rustic Saison ranks up as well.

The body is a heavy-feeling light, with a moderate carbonation and a crisp, dry finish. Overall, a very nice kolsch, though I feel the smell was just a bit too faint and plain.

A weird floral, sweet note, almost like a apple jolly rancher sits in the background, along with the standard biscuit malts that I usually detect. No hops are present here. Taste is close to the nose, with the weird sweet character coming through. Overall I'm not a fan of this beer at all, and I probably will just save the other five from the few cases I have, and pass them out to family when they are over.

You don't expect much in the way of aromas from a kolsch, and these sniffs are simple but good. In terms of taste of weight, this beer is nearly simple but terrifically enjoyable. If only it had more assertive/balancing hops, it would exemplify everything that kolsch is intended to be. Body is light. Flavors are predominantly [lightly] malty and devoid of challenging corners or anything even mildly offensive.

I like how the earthy/peppery elements buoy the malt keeping it interesting and at the same time complimenting the yeast which has a mild German mustiness. the malt is generally light and inoffensive, but all in all I found this to be something I could see working in a cookout setting mid-summer to go with ribs or brats to cut some grease and deliver a nice amount of flavor at the same time similar to a Witbier.","Slatetank","May 16, 2011"

The jasmine is clearly noticeable and it kind of makes the beer taste more like a saison than a kolsch. It isn't a bad beer, but I would have preferred that they just make a traditional kolsch instead. I can't help but think that adding something like jasmine is the kind of thing that one might do when a homebrewed kolsch turned out poorly and I came up with a last ditch idea to save it.","nickfl","May 15, 2011"

Head is about the density of a soda head, when I poured it into a pint glass it rose to about an 3/4 of an inch. This head quickly recedes leaving me with a ring around my glass. The smell is of light sweet malts and a slight floral smell. Upon first taste I get that same sweet malt taste, but I also catch some citrus hops along with the slight floral taste. The mouthfeel is light and refreshing. This is a wonderful substitute for your friend's BMC, it still has the refreshing qualities and the ABV is pretty reasonable.

Overall not bad, tastes pretty good, for what it is, the Rustic Saison satisfied my tastes buds much more though.","WVbeergeek","May 11, 2011"

3.42,-5.8,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Very strange beer to review. Poured out to a golden strawish color. Nice white foamy head with good retention and decent lacing. Dominant scent when breathing it in is bread/grain. Taking a taste, the hop spice is what definitely hits you first. Not hard, but it is what one notices. After a few more sips, the citrus notes start to kick in. The flavors definitely develop as you get further into it. There is still an aftertaste I can't quite name that throws off the finishing balance, but it doesn't stay with you as you continue. All in all, a decent summer beer.","FrankenBeerStein","May 10, 2011"

3.83,5.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"An absolutely spectacular quaffer, with just enough complexity to keep it interesting. Perhaps not exactly to style (though the addition of Jasimine Sambac flowers prevents that from the get-go), but certainly well-executed and a perfect beer for summertime drinking. Boston Beer Co. may want to consider bringing this out as a replacement for the venerable Summer Ale.","superdedooperboy","May 10, 2011"

I get some grain and grass notes, as well as some bready malt and a little bit of grape characteristics. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Decent, but not as good as I was expecting it to be.","Mora2000","May 07, 2011"

4,10.2,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a clear straw in color, good foam and alittle lace stickage. Smells of biscuity malts, some fresh baked bread and doughy notes. In the flavor, crisp, clean, bready malts once again dominate. Alittle herbal hop presence but mainly light, malty and refreshing. A very solid kolsch and tastes like many imports only fresher.","Stinkypuss","May 04, 2011"

3.92,8,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"O - Overall I can't really imagine a much better Kolsch. This beer is wonderful for a hot day and can go well with any food. Intensely easy to drink, with some complexity, but overall it is best described as refreshing and delicious.","greenmonstah","May 04, 2011"
3.97,9.4,4,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Pours an almost crystal clear, light, yellow-gold. A white, foamy head rears back, but stays a quarter-inch and patches the glass. Smell is fresh, biscuity, lemony, and straw-like. Sugary.. many smells, very complex. Right away, I get the smoothness of honey. Then the typical, sour back-end of the kolsch. A sweetness tries to break thru, but doesn't quite achieve it. A bit of spice on the finish. Feel is sorta like a cut wine. Yes, there is a floralness about this brew as well. An odd choice of ingredients makes for a unique pour. Nice.","sixerofelixir","May 02, 2011"

3,-17.4,3,3,3,3,3,"Overall: This to me is an average beer and of Sam Adams special offerings this is with the Coastal Wheat as the least impressive of the bunch.

3.68,1.4,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"O - This beer was reviewed as a herb/spice beer, as it is obvious from the description on the bottle. The floral presence is out front in this beer and lends itself well to the kölsch style. The floral taste really lends itself to a 'false' noble hop flavor, which make it work well enough.","scoobybrew","May 01, 2011"

3.88,6.9,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Grainy and bready with a light sweetness. Not too shabby, I am glad the jasmine does not impart much of a flavor. The yeast is not as prominent as I would like, but there is still an influence at least. Good, easy drinking with a little bit of character and a crisp finish. A pretty good effort from the BBC, I would buy a sixer of this in standalone format.","twiggamortis420","Apr 30, 2011"
3.38,-6.9,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"O - Overall I think this beer is very refreshing and drinkable but doesn't offer much more than that for me. In fact I think I would rather have a Pale Ale or a Pilsner. Maybe I'm just not a fan of this style, I'll have to try more in the future. I think it's worth a try though, especially because it currently comes in a mix pack of other refreshing brews for the summer. Cheers!","PintOHops","Apr 29, 2011"

4.13,13.8,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"12oz. bottle served in a Stange. Enjoy before September notched on the label. Pours a translucent golden-yellow with a rocky, bright white 1.5 inch head that eventually settles into a thin band around the edges. Some residual spots of lacing present during the session. Copious tiny bubbles are evident effervescing in solution. Very clean nose - the merest suggestion of citrus (lemon) and a light bready quality. Taste follows nose - bready quality is much sweeter and comes to the forefront, with the citrus character lightly interweaving itself throughout the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is light-bodied with a pleasant, even carbonation. A very flavorful and easy drinking domestic kolsch - would love to see this added to the regular Summer line-up.","Jwale73","Apr 24, 2011"

Flavor is much like the aroma. Floral and grainy. Slightly bitter with an earthy aftertaste. This is a pretty good pick for warm weather drinking. Crisp and smooth. Refreshing brew. Overall, I like it but probably wouldn't buy it on its own. I do like it in the summer mix pack,though.","PicoPapa","Apr 22, 2011"
3.88,6.9,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Overall, this is a pretty damn good kolsch. The BBC did a good job at replicating the style, and best of all, it's great to taste one fresh rather than getting burned by a stale import, as Kolsch is relatively low ABV beer with low bitterness, so it does not travel well. A great, easy drinking, summer time brew. Wish it were available in six-packs. Oh, and most importantly, cheers to my 200th BA review!","AustinBeerLvr","Apr 22, 2011"
4.35,19.8,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Delicious Kolsch! Pours a very pale golden color with generously sized creamy white head. Nose is literally like some Jasmine white tea I've had in the past, oh so delicate yet clearly there. Floral elements are noted quickly on the palate, but then a hearty herbal character takes center stage and carries through to the finish. Medium bodied and delightfully drinkable. More floral notes in the aftertaste too. Really, really like this Kolsch.","yemenmocha","Apr 15, 2011"
3.92,8,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"D/O: Easily drinkable and a great summer beer. I'm enjoying these new additions to the Sam packs. Definitely beats the Blackberry Wheat or Pale Ale that it replaced from last years mixer in terms of a ""Summer style""","BEERMILER12","Apr 15, 2011"

Wow, I cannot believe that I am only the fourth person reviewing a new Sam Adams brew. The pour into my Kolsch glass is a well-carbonated pale yellow with a a thin white head. The aromas are grainy and malty. The body is pretty nice in the medium range. The taste has a decent enough grainy character with a slightly assertive dry hoppy ending. It seems to emulate the style well enough.","puboflyons","Apr 08, 2011"

An awesome addition to Samuel Adams' summer offerings.","MrHurmateeowish","Apr 06, 2011"
