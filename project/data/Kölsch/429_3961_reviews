"Summer Ale pours a clear darker golden color with a small but lacing head.  There is a very crisp and light malty aroma.  The taste is very crisp, creamy, nice pronounced pale malt flavors, some citrus notes.  Nice full flavor, good feel.  Overall its a stronger and very tasty Kolsch."

"Overall (3.29) : Best Alaskan product i have tried thus far. If it was sitting in a cooler at a pool party I'd be more inclined to grab this than many others as it is refreshing and easy to drink without sacrificing hops or flavor. Schell's Zommerfest is a far superior Kolsch and so far that's the only other one I have to compare it to. Summer Ale is right, and this is wheaty and zesty just like a Kolsch should be."

"Overall a drinkable beer but nothing special."

"Body is light and highly drinkable, fairly dry, an overall pretty good brew. Can't find much to complain about on this one, it's pretty good."

"A solid, well done Kolsch. Easy drinking but still flavorful."

"Overall - Though not attractive in the glass by any means, this is a tasty and refreshing brew, and is aptly named as it would be perfect on a hot summer day. I'll definitely come back to this."

"O - 3.5 - Wanted more tart flavor from a kolsch. I can think of a few I'd rather have than this one, but that's just me."
""
"A highly enjoyable Kölsch. Not a ton of character, which might be a turn off to those unfamiliar with this style. However, those who can look past that are in for treat that can be enjoyed anytime, anywhere."
""
""
""
"This poured a light golden-blonde color with a bit of foam. Light aroma, with a clean, crisp, easy drinking flavor with a touch of toasted biscuit and a light squeeze of orange blossom."

""

"A fine beer."

"A nice little malt-forward ale, perfect for a summer afternoon when you're in the mood for a lighter ale. Nothing mind-blowing, just easy drinking and tasty..."

"Ok summer beer. Enjoyed several of these light feeling beers--also light golden in color. The flavor is an interesting flavor--surprisingly malty. I tried this by error--the keg I ordered was not delivered so I took this one instead--and I am glad I tried it. I am not a big fan of this style (Kölsch) but it is worth trying."
"Overall: this is a decently drinkable Kölsch, although perhaps a little bit unrefined. Still, great on a hot day."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a clear golden yellow with a one finger white head. Scents of German ale yeast, crystal malt and German hops. Flavor is crisp and clear with sweet malt and some bread and slight citrus pith flavors and an excellent moderate level of hop bitterness. Good and flavorful without being overwhelming. Mouthfeel is light bodied with moderate carbonation. Very easy to drink. This is a good Kolsch, well worth trying. It's an easy drinking, light bodied, yet flavorful beer, great for the summer."
""
""
""
""
"O-This beer is an easy drinker, but lacks any real character. From the looks to the smell and taste, everything about the beer is vague...not bad, just not great or memorable. On the other hand, I find the feel to be refreshing and the beer is definitely drinkable, without being too light or fizzy and I suppose that is what a summer beer is for."

"I've not been super keen on Kölsch in the past, but I'm starting to come around and Alaskan Summer Ale has not hurt that process."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Alaskan Summer is a very drinkable beer but it's body is a little more rich for a Kölsch than I'd like, only hindering it's inherent crispness. The simplistic bready malt and undertones of fruit work very well though."

""

"Atmosphere is pretty good. Decent hue, with a slight head, and no real lacing. Nose is earthy grain and flora. Flavor is a light combination of grass, citrus, and a bit of a brassy finish. Overall, this is a good quaff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The style can be unforgiving, and I think I may be drinking this a bit too late. That said, I think I can get enough from it to know that it would be decent fresh."
""
""
""
"overall, this seasonal offering from Alaskan is a decent, drinkable and fairly tasty take on a delicate style. i am not overly fond of the style, even in the hottest of weather, but this wasn't bad. it can quench a thirst to be sure."
""
""
""
""
""
"It has a light mouth-feel and is pretty relaxing to drink!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability: Light, tasty, and easy drinking. This is a summer beer I wish could buy locally."
""
"O - Just a straight out enjoyable beer. Looks good. Smells amazing. Taste great, and feels wonderful. I recommend this one if you see it."

"Very clean and crisp. Light bodied. Well carbonated."
""
""
""
"A typical kolsch styled beer. It's pale gold, with solid head and okay retention on top. A bit fruity with ceral grains in the nose. Similar in taste as well, with more cereal grains than the fruitiness. Light and crisp, easy to drink, non offensive....sure, let's drink one this summer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This disappointed me. The label is awesome, but the beer is pretty average. It was quite light when poured with no lacing, no head, and virtually no fizz. The smell was non-existent. The taste was very rich but pretty sour for my taste. Not something I would have again."
""
""
"Mouthfeel is crisp and clean from start to finish which I find delightful. Medium carbonation and a slightly light body round this out to a damn fine beverage. Alaskan Brewing Co. produces some mighty fine suds. This is a great session beer and one I would drink over and over again."
"Pretty refreshing beer for the summer months, though it's a little sweeter than one may expect for the style. Still, it went down really easy and I could see myself grabbing it on a hot day."
""
"Decently bold for the style, the yeast and hops are an interesting combination of fruity bitterness. Its not quite as crips and clean as Id like it to be, though and I suppose I am a bit spoiled as Lawnmower is one of my favorite American interpretations of the style. Still though, a pretty tasty ale and its always a good thing when my beer is gone before I can even finish the review!"
""
""
""
"Poured into std pint glass with little head, although it maintained carbonation throughout. I've had a couple other Kolsch style beers recently and the Alaskan comes up considerably weaker than the others. The distinctive Kolsch flavor is only slightly present in Alaskan, making this taste more like an American lager than a true Kolsch. This will be my only 6 for the summer. Hopefully they can bring up the Kolsch flavor next year."
""
"O) Nice summer offering right here. If you are looking to add something new to the summer rotation, or just knock a few back on the porch or patio, these will go down with ease."
"The beer pours a clear golden color with a white head. The aroma is full of wheat with some grain and a hint of grape vine. The flavor is similar, with some nice wine-like notes mixed in with some yeast, wheat and white pepper. Thin mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A nice kolsch, glad Alaskan is now available in Texas."
""
"Pours out a very translucent medium golden straw color with only a light foam collar for a head, no lacing. Medium-light aroma and flavor of pale malt, some light generic fruit esters, mostly grassy hopping used as accent marks and proper punctuation for the light malting / breaded character. Very pleasing and refreshingly light mouthfeel which is appropriate to the style. Aside from a lackluster head, this is one of the better Kolsches I've had to date, so I recommend giving it a shot if you enjoy the style."
""
""
""
"O: A great summer beer. Tasty & refreshing. Will probably pick up a six pack next time at store."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from bottle into brooklyn tulip. Pours a crystal clear yellow/orange color. Barely any head at all, kind of surprising. Smell- apple sauce, peach. lots of sweet malt character. Taste- apple juice. Hmm. carbonated apple juice. Barely any hop presence, and not much depth at all. This isn't great. Don't see coming back to it, and god dammit- I bought a whole six pack. It also isn't too carbonated. Overall, not pleased."
"O - A very good brew, very clean, lots of flavor for something with not a lot of malt/hops, delicious!!"
""
""
"O: an OK beer! I had much better kölsch beer at rock bottom chicago! I dont recomend it! Sorry but a bit dissapointed knowing That it comes from a amazing brewery!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very easy drinking beer. Not to much here, but that's what makes this style awesome. Great for a summer day. It would be easy to kick a few of these back."
""
""
""
"Overall, a good kolsch that will go down nicely on a hot Texas summer day. Glad to finally see Alaskan here in Texas. Rotation - the rare six pack in the summer especially if sharing with the non-craft beer neighbors. [O;Y]"
"Flavors are similarly sweet, some orange and sugar cookie notes, pale malt and light banana ester from the yeast. A bit watery and thin bodied, and lightly astringent. Not really something i'd revisit with better local options available (Krankshaft, Summertime)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Quite drinkable but it might get tiresome with the rather flaccid character. The 12 oz bottle, from Trader Joe's."
""
""
""
""
"Adjunct lager character on the nose and on appearance but don't judge on looks alone. Refreshing summer beer that is flavorful and clean. Good take on an obscure style."
"Pours a clear straw yellow with no head or lace. The aroma is faint lemons with hints of dough and cake. The flavor is balanced, even if plain, with a mix of crisp malt and hoppiness. There's a faint taste of medicine in the finish as it warms. The mouthfeel is light and slightly sticky. Alaskan Summer Ale is a decent beer, recommended."

"Lighter-bodied and heavily carbonated. Light flavor profile and immensely refreshing, but surprisingly complex. Not the best kölsch I've tried, but it has all the attributes to make an excellent session ale."
"Thanks to Cyberkedi for this one"
"Enjoyed the six-pack that I bought. I generally don't like the Kolsch style but this was nice. Good when it's warm because the flavors come out but most enjoyable when it's cold."
"On a side note, I like orcas."
"Pretty much what I expected: nothing earth-shattering, not much to challenge your palate, but a good, recommendable Kolsch."
"Drinkability: Good flavors. Well balanced. A good interpretation of the Kölsch style (which is a style I really enjoy when it's done right). I would definitely drink this again. It's a good spring or summer brew."
"This is an interesting beer, most of the other kolsch beers I've had reminded me of mini-pilsners, but this is out on its own island. Very dry cracker-like flavor is interesting but seems to be missing a component. Didn't really look good or smell like anything so I can't really give above average marks there. Still, I would say this is worth a try."
"O - Americanized or not, this is a pretty solid example of a Kolsch to me. Hits the spot just right for the summer months!"
"Clear golden colored brew, chill haze, very big white head, good amount of lace. Scent is light sweet biscuity malt, just a touch of floral hop. Pilsner malt front, bready, a bit grassy, some slight hop influence. Pretty full bodied, overall pretty soft but there is a bit of sharpness to it. Not gonna go wrong with this during a hot summer's day"
"Aroma is malty with a yeasty overtone and a hint of fruit like summer sunshine. It pours a typical clear amber with a thick, frothy, off-white head. Flavor is malty and fruity with hints of caramel and honey - not complex, but still refreshing. Smooth texture has a decent tingle to it and leaves behind a fruity fizz. Not great, but grab a bottle if you get a chance."
"Overall: Good taste. Well balanced. Not the best lager i've had but it's drinkable."
"Poured golden-yellow with about an inch of foam. Not much for an aroma mostly grain and malt. Taste is grain and sweet malt with a just bit of a hop and citrus presence toward the end. Mouthfeel is light and crisp. Overall it's solid, aptly named summer ale."
"O: Decent summer beer for $1.29 for a single. Not much there, but then again the style does not scream complexity either. It's Crisp, and refreshing. No where near as good as a German Kolsch, but it hit the spot just fine."
"On tap at Seattle TapRoom. Pours deep golden with a white head. Aroma is of grassy, perfume hops and biscuit malt. Medium, slightly crisp body. Light, crisp, grassy malt is balanced on the palate by biscuit malt and hints of tropical fruit. Short, light finish. Easy drinking brew, one of the best Kolsch I’ve tried."
"O: Not outstanding, but overall a good beer. Perfect for a hot summer day when you need a quality refreshing beer that tastes good. Solid overall."
"Pours a clear light yellow color with a 1 inch white head that fades to a film on the top of the beer. Random spots of lacing dot the glass on the drink down. Smell is of sweet grains, citrus, and some fruity notes. Taste is exactly the same with the sweet grain taste being the most prominent and the fruit flavors coming through on the finish. This beer has a lower carbonation level but is still bubbly and smooth. Overall, this is a pretty good beer and I can see why this would be a Summer selection. Very easy to drink with a lower ABV but nothing all that special."
"I picked a single bottle of this up a general store at the Grand Canyon since Alaskan doesn't distribute to New Mexico. Glad I did. Although a won't lose any sleep over not having access to this beer here in NM, it would be an excellent pick for a six pack when I go to Hood Canal in Washington next month."
"Overall: A good version of a Kolsch. Nothing outstanding, but a pretty good summer brew."
"Around 2001 this beer provided an important lesson for me in beer appreciation. As newer American beers were introduced to me, it was easy to assume that every unfamiliar style was therefore a newly-created style. In fact, they were usually trying to follow a precedent already established by traditional styles--usually in other countries. Alaskan Summer ale taught me a new word: kolsch. I came to realize that Alaskan was not inventing new styles of beer, they were just remembering (and teaching) beer history. It was a useful and necessary lesson to learn."
"O: Decent. Its a Kolsch, so nothing to get excited about, but its well made for the style. Pretty easy drinking."
"O- This is my first crack at an Alaskan brew since they arrived in Minnesota. Nice and crisp, good balance of sweetness, very refreshing. I'm looking forward to picking up a couple of sixers this summer."
"Clear, bright yellow color with one finger of head that had good retention. The head settles to a very thin cap. Moderate amount of spotty lacing is left on the glass. Aroma consists of some bicuity malt and slight fruity esters. Not getting much from the hops. The flavor is a little more fruity which comes as a suprise in a Kolsch. Malt is semi-dry and bready. What is not surpising is the light body and lively carbonation. This is an easy drinking beer that compliments hot summer days. Not the best Kolsch I have ever had."
"Medium bodied, medium carbonation, soft mouthfeel, very easy to drink. I could easily drink several of these in one evening. Welcome to Minnesota, Alaskan Brewing Company!"
"Alaskan Summer Kolsh-Style Ale pours a clear golden hue from the 12 ounce bottle. A cap of white foam followed the beer down, leaving lacy traces down the glass. The aroma is light, as expected for the style, with pale malt contributing the most. The flavors are pale malt with a little sweetness underlying it. Very little bite at the end, par for the style. This is a fine summer ale, refreshing after a day in the sun."
"Sun yellow body. Clarity is good. Carbonation looks to be moderately high as many tiny bubbles surface at a nice clip. Nice and fresh boquet of light biscuity malts and floral hops. Feel is crisp and refreshing. Light bready malt base with hay and lemon sprinkled on top. Hops provide a very slight dryness to the beer. Fairly decent Kolsch. It's hard to pack a lot of flavor into a Kolsch, but I have had some that were pretty outstanding. This is not that, but yet a good summer quaffer."
"Overall: Overly simplified (and de-hopped) version of a Kolsch. Refreshing and easy to drink, but not enough there to truly desire buying it again."
"O- nothing outstanding here but a decent light easy drinking brew good for the summer and will drink some more singles of this"
"This beer pours a clear golden color. The head is a half inch in height, and recedes quickly into sparse lacing. The aroma is of spicy noble hops, bready malt, and a hint of metal. This is a very pleasing aroma. The taste is a little maltier than the aroma with the spiciness only showing in the back ground. The mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, this is a good that I will surely drink again."
"Notes: Light and crisp, Alaskan Summer Ale is a good interpretation of the Kölsch style. There's not alot to it, but it's still a decent session beer for the season."
"Overall this is not bad at all, but put in the category of a Kolsch and I have had much, much better. Still I would go for it in a pinch."
"O: Overall, the beer was easy to drink but was boring. It seems this summer ale was designed to be palatable to a wide spectrum of beer drinkers. The beer was balanced well, but there weren't any specific characteristics that made me look forward to drinking the rest of the sixer."
"the name says it all a great light beer for hot days and nights."
"Pours a clear, golden color. 1/5 inch head of a white color. Decent retention and decent lacing. Smells of sweet malt, pale malt, hint of hop, and a hint of yeast. Fits the style of a Kolsch. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, pale malt, hint of yeast, hint of citrus, and a hint of grain. Overall, decent blend and body."
"Mouthfeel is quite smooth and crisp, but is warmer and more full than I expected. It's never watery which is a good thing. Drinkability is ok, but could have definitely used some bitterness to the finish. As it is, it is solid, but unspectacular."
"Looks perfectly average; slightly better color than a basic adjunct lager, a little darker and golden hued. Weak, thin head that doesn't last. Very lively beer, lots of bubbles. Smell is that classic kölsch odor; like tart dust is the best way I can describe it. Smell is dry and musty. To say there is some fruit in there might be a stretch, but I think I detect some grape and lime aromas, actually. Not a whole lot of malt smells, but I don't detect much in the way of adjuncts. I can't tell what exactly gives kölsch that specific aroma, perhaps the type of hops used? Can't tell. Either way, I don't like that smell very much. I've smelled worst, but still, it doesn't do it for me. Taste is of a slight caramel sweetness, then the delicate hops tinniness of the style takes over and ruins it all for me. Reminds me of lime rinds or mint leaves, a weird sweet, tart and musty taste."
"Overall - not a bad brew, and maybe not a bad American version of the style. Hop flavor could be more distinct."
"Taste, lots of carbonation, minimal hop presence. Interesting aftertaste, slightly metallic and earthy at the same time. Very easy to drink. A good hot weather girlfriend beer."
"Feel and drinkability: this brew is somehow full and light but not weak. It is creamy with none of that annoying over-carbonated sense that similar beers sometimes have. It's called Summer for a reason and one could easily spend an entire summer afternoon at the lake throwing back pints of this tasty libation."
"D) A decent brew. Seems true to style. I'd have another."
"I don't know what my problem was with this beer, maybe it was the style, or maybe it was the brewery, but it just wasn't working for me. If I had to put my finger on one thing I didn't like about it, I would have to say that the malt flavor just grossed me out, it was too sweet and really just gross. For a summer beer I don't want something that malty, and if it is malty, at least make it a good malt flavor. There really wasn't much of a hop flavor either, which would have helped I'm sure. No head whatsoever, no lacing. And since I didn't like the flavor, it was hard to drink, hard to finish too. I mean it wasn't god awful, it wasn't the worst beer I've ever had, so I can't grade it too low, it just really wasn't my cup of tea."
"Pale golden hazy pour, with bright white head forming fine speckled lacing. Aroma clean mild fruitiness with a biscuit pale malt breadiness, a touch of herbal hops and mineral water. Flavor has a balanced blend of light herbal hops pale biscuit flavored hops, mild fruitiness from the ale yeast. Again the mineral water mild metallic tone in the finish works and really cleanses the palate between sips. Mouthfeel is light bodied, sturdy carbonation. Perfect for summer time refreshment this one held up quite nicely this late into the fall. Drinkability solid drinking well this Indian Summer, a nice version of a Kolsch definitely blends nicely with the rest of Alaskan brewing's lineup."
"Pours a golden straw color, head quickly dissipates. Smells of wheat, a little fruity and a little bit of hops. Tastes a little of dough, wheat and citrus. Has a medium body, with average carbonation. Overall, its an enjoyable summer beer, Its my first Kolsch, so I have nothing to compare it to, but it was good."
"Pours a light, thin straw color with he tiniest bit of an orange hue. Thin head and negligible lacig as it goes down. Nose is pretty light with wheat but brigs forward some fruity elements. I get a bit of lemon and maybe some tangerine. Flavor draws back a bit with some wheat and a bit of hops. Some fruity elements remain. Mouthfeel is light and crisp. Not too much flavor, but a nice feel and good drinkability."
"Overall this is a nonthreatening summer beer that can be enjoyed by most."
"Nice flavors aside from I think it would have been nicer to have a clean finish. Pretty easy drinking for a summer afternoon... or night...or morning if you live in Florida."
"Drinkability: An excellent summer beer and a fine representation of the style. I could have a six of these. A very clean beer. Nothing fancy, just good beer."
"overall: it is what it says summer ale great easy drinking beer that even a bud miller or coors drinker would like. I really like the smooth finish of this really good."
"A nice kolsch, crisp and malty, good for even a pseudo Canadian summertime..."
"D- An inoffensive beer, that is decent, but otherwise unremarkable. much better on tap."
"Pours straw/gold with medium clarity and a thin head. Aroma is feint, flowery, light. Taste is clean and simple, good balance with a tip toward hoppy bitterness, hops here are floral and subdued. Taste is thin and clean but not watery, drinkability is off the charts. I'm not sure if summer actually ever arrives in Juneau but the folks at Alaska have made a nice kolsch all the same."
"It poured a dark golden color that was clear and slightly bubbly. The aroma was almost non-present with just a slight bit of grain present. For taste it was a bit of grain and corn without much to enjoy. It was like a macro beer with a tad bit of extra flavor and no nastiness. It wasn't bad tasting it just didn't have much to offer. Plus since this was considered a premium beer at the BBQ place it wasn't worth what I payed for it. Not a repeat buy."
"Poured into pint glass. Pours a clear golden color with nice white head and good retention and lacing. ALMOST looks like a macro but its not quite that yellow or fizzy. Smell was of dry malt and straw, perhaps a little citrus (orange peel) smell but faint. Taste was pretty clean and straight-forward. Dry malt, grassy hops and a general crispness. Mouthfeel was light, slightly oily aftertaste. Overall a good beer and representative of its style. Doesn't stand out a ton but I would revisit."
"Mouthfeel is light and has a prickly amount of carbonation."
"D - Overall its a good refreshing beer for the summer months nothing amazing just a good easy drinking beer worth a try"
"Drinkability - I was really let down by the Alaskan White, but this is a pleasant surprise. That said, I do not know what a benchmark Kolsch is supposed to be, so I can only rate this beer on its own merits, and it comes out solid for a summer ale."
"Bought as a single bottle from 99 bottles in Federal Way, Washington. Very drinkable, crisp, refreshing and some fruity esters coming through. I liked this more than I thought I would, and I will probably buy a six pack of this in the future. decently priced also."
"I like this beer and if I could get it regularly I probably would."
"D: Hey, its nice. Light and simple. Pretty much what I was looking for. Sure it could use a bit more, but its all good. Easy drinking and not bad by any measure. Actually quite damned enjoyable. Glad I got the shot at it."
"D - Kolsch's tend to be very drinkable and this is no differen.t"
"D- Great summertime lawnmower beer, very sessionable- although I usually prefer hoppier or darker beers this would be awesome on a sunny day out at Safeco Field or even while tending to a hot grill."
"NOTES: BJCP-Kolsch"
"First time having this style, so I can't compare to ""the real thing."""
"I couldn't feel the 5.30% ABV as I was drinking this, and it was only after I had the whole bottle down that I felt a slight buzz. While this isn't a typical Summer Ale or Hefeweizen, this would be a decent choice for those warm days where something with a bit more substance is called for..."
"Pours a nice fluffy white head, dies down to a very active carb. A very dry beer, not much aftertaste. A little sweet. Some tartness. Hops are very mild. Malt is there and also very tame. Some citrus tones. A great beer at a great price for a hot summer day! Recommended."
"M -"
"D - This is a nice summer brew. It is tasty and makes a good session brew."
"Summer poured a lightly hazy pale lemon yellow color with a head of foam that wasn't all that special. The head of foam was about 1/2 to 3/4 of an inch in height, pure white in color, and just a bit on the fizzy side. This fizzy head actually good retention that left behind a string of white rings and 3 tiny spots of lace around the glass. At first, this beer had an average toasted aroma of toasted malts and not much of anything else. That changed slightly when it was swirled around. When it was swirled around, a nice light juicy fruit aroma and a hint of bitter hops emerges from the background. I thought the taste was going to start off malty and then roll gently into some hops. Instead, this beer did the opposite. This beer started off with crispy floral hops and when the hops reached their peakness, the taste then rolled into a nice solid maltyness. This was a light bodied beer that certainly wasn't light in flavor. In the end, this was a great Summer time treat. It had session written all over it. I just wish I had a few more bottles of this beer."
"Poured with a spare, white head that diminished quickly to a thin film. Body was clear and flat, with a dark-yellow color. Aroma was of light malt and some slight citrus. Light-bodied and thin on the palate, with average carbonation. Taste was of a short duration, but it was good... lightly sweet, again with some citrus. Overall it was fine, but nothing great. High drinkability in that it goes down very easy."
"Pours a light golden colored body, with nearly no head, whitish in color. Malty aroma, some freshness. Enticing. Malty nutty taste, refreshing. Effervescent. Not skunky tasting. Pretty tasting. A little heavier than a typical summer beer."
"A drinkable summer ale, but not much more than that."
"Nothing overly exciting, and I wish the beer was brighter, but overall a tasty take on a Kölsch and a very worthy session brew."
"Prost!"
"Dark gold in color and very still. Some random prickle pops around in the glass and there is no head to speak of. Sweet malty nose is okay. The attack is refreshing and clean and leads you to believe it will be a nice, simple, easy drinking beer. The flavor has a strong sour grain flavor. It seems a bit heavy to me for a summer ale. The aftertaste is sour. Compared to other summer ales, I am not a huge fan of this one, but I get that summer in Alaska is different than summer in other places. It just doesn't seem all that much like a warm weather beer. A little heavy and sour."
"D - i love this beer"
"Maybe that initial reaction is a little harsh...but this was a kinda wimpy beer for me. I know that that is the style, but I have had better versions of it. In the end, it is more drinkable as it warms than your average macro, but I am pretty underwhelmed here..."
"I have very little experience with this style, but this isn't a half bad beer. I can't say that I'm blown away by it, but as compared against other summer beers (American Wheats and various lagers), it's alright. The beer pours an almost off-putting shade of yellowish orange with essentially no head or lacing of any kind. The nose is malty but light and not particularly engaging. That said, it's sweet and bready and doesn't smell off at all. The taste brings in some spicy hops and a faint vinous character. There just isn't enough depth of character to bring out any more interesting notes. The mouthfeel is surprisingly effervescent and would be even more enjoyable given a different flavor profile. Ultimately, it's an ok beer with a bland recipe. I don't know why a brewer would choose to make a Kölsch, specifically. At any rate, Alaskan does not make a very strong case for the style."
"D- Very drinkable, definitely something that I think would be universally inoffensive."
"D: Flavorful and refreshing. Not too complex. Very drinkable."
"Drinkability is good. Not a great beer, but it's refreshing, and very easy to drink."
"Its tough when a brewer slaps ""Kolsch"" on a label, the style is so narrow and there is only a small handful of true Kolschs that are sent to the US from Germany. A little to ale-like rather than Kolsch, this is not to say that this beer is not a decent quaff. Its sums up to be a simple Golden Ale at best."
"Overall, this isn't too bad, but I can't see myself coming back to this one. The flavors just don't jump out like I was hoping."
"D- Very high if you are just looking for something to throw back while watching a game or snacking on some pretzels. Very light body(a bit watered down)and low ABV mske this quite quaffable. In fact, i forced myself to sip the first round, but after that it was game on and i found myself pouring them down."
"Drinkability- Kolsch is as drinkable as a beer gets; light very mild on both hops and malts. Sadly, this Kolsch is simply boring and lifeless. Not undrinkable, just not worth a second glass."
"Pours a luminous golden color, transparent, with reasonable white head. Nose is citrusy and metallic. Some metallic components on the palate too, with a nice herbal presence and crisp, light & refreshing malt. Faint sour element that disappears near the finish. Very refreshing and something I would love with good American pub fare."
"D: balanced, good flavors, mildly pleasing overall"
"D: Tasty and refreshing, yet quite atypical compared to the others of its style that I've had."
"This would be great to have on a hot summer day. Very refreshing."
"Overall, another great release from Alaskan. I love this brewing company."
"D - This beer met my expectations and is good for style."
"When you look at it after pouring it in a glass, you notice the beauty that is the Summer Ale. It's a light golden color and very clear. Taste great. I had a case of it straight from the state of Alaska this year and I think I still have a couple left. This beer is easy to drink one after the other."
"Overall. Kolsch is not my style of beer but it was descent and good drinking.."
"(rated 8/9/2007)"
"Light golden-amber color. Wheat and spice aroma. Taste was also wheaty, but with noticeable fruity hops. A little Saaz, but not much. Very light and refreshing; great as a summer seasonal. Its like a Vienna along the lines of Karl Strauss Amber Lager, but not as heavy."
"Notes from 6/7/04"
"Poured into a cylinder glass. Clear yellow gold with a small off-white head. Aroma is light German pale malts with a hint of stone fruit. Flavor is toasty sweet malt, soft unacidic citrus, and a light grassy Hallertau zest. Good carbonation, light body, clean finish, high drinkability. Not very complex or interesting, just solid and summery. Does what it ought to do: refresh."
"(I visited Alaska in 2004 and had the opportunity to try some of their brews)"
"Drinkablity: One of my favorite Alaskan Brewing Company beers. Very easy to drink and compatible with almost any food."
"Very good for the style (Kolsch). Golden with a slight white head. Crisp taste: decent maltiness, some hops, light fruits, some grassiness. A little yeasty. Refreshing, an excellent golf course beer. Very drinkable. Beats the hell out of macro pale lagers."
"The taste is crisp, dryish, with grain, apples and very nice balance. It's fizzy, with a light, lively, zesty feel and it's highly drinkable, comparable to a very good pale lager."
"I can't get really excited about a beer like this but it's good and seems to be done well. I would really need to try an ""authentic"" German version to know how this stacks up."
"D - Great lawnmower beer, hit the cream part head on."
"Drinkability: Mild and easy with a pleasant flavor. A good brew for the summer that I wouldn't mind drinking again."
"Alaskan Summer displays a clear golden body and a small white head. A light and mildly funky hay aroma. A light malt base with a floral hop finish. Easy drinking, refreshing and light. Won't wow you, won't offend you. Does what most summer seasonals are expected to do."
"Drinkability is the probably the best part of this beer: interesting enough to have another, low enough ABV to let you enjoy another. Indeed, this would be a good session beer."
"Pours light golden with a small head and a little carbonation from the bottom. Smell is slight but honeylike. The flavoir is pleasantly honey-ish with a very faint hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is slightly clingy, pleasant and thin with a little bitter honey on the back end. A nice, highly drinkable kolsh."
"Nice golden color, with low head retention. Very effervescent with high crisp carbonation. Smells clean with a hint of washed concrete. Grainy taste that leaves a nice dryness in the mouth. A faint sweetness right before the end. Hints of lemons and poundcake. Light bodied and easy to drink. I like to grab one of these when the weather is hot and the Colorado sun is shining bright."
"Despite pouring this beer quite rapidly into my pint glass very little head bubbled up. It was true white and truly short lived, gone in sixty seconds just like the movie! Nice golden color leaning towards the orange spectrum. Aromas dominated by yeast and light yeast. Understated. The same can be said for the flavors. A little grainy with the bitter hops being most pronounced (This beer is a Kolsh and it shows). It does display some crispness but nothing defined. Citric notes under the hops. Mouthfeel is pleasant, light but not watery with moderate carbonation. A good session beer but really lacking on flavor and more Spring-ish to me; I'd rather have a Belgian white or a fruit beer on a hot summer day."
"Slight honey smell. Pours to a golden yellow with a white head. Taste is lager like hop sweet with a clean dry finish. Very refreshing and very much a thirst quencher, in the Alaskan heat, as short lived as it may be. Not really much of a backbone to this brew but can be enjoyed in quantity. Recommend trying with some fresh halibut sushi, salud!"
"This is definately a ""chill"" beer in every sense of the word. I think it's a pretty well-crafted summer beer; it's got a nice citrusy flavor and it goes down incredibly easily and doesn't fill you up too quickly. This is my second beer from the Alaskan Brewing Co. - I would say that I'm quite pleased with what they have to offer. I don't like it as much as their Alaskan Amber, but I can't wait to try more of their stuff."
"Poured a straw colored yellow wit some decent cartbonation. Nose was fruity, lemon and some other light citrus undertones to it. The flavor carries more of the bready malt flavor and has a slight sourness(maybe from the lemon and citrus) and touch of bitterness in the finish to keep it interesting. Pretty easy to drink but not my fav seasonal."
"I found this to be a really interesting beer. The assertive hops were a pleasant surprise. They totally dominate this beer but in a good way."
"Mouthfeel is light and a bit watery, but overall a decently drinkable summer ale."
"Pours a pale and clear amber with a nice head that quickly dissipates. Alaskan summer ale smells of wheat, malts, and a faint bit of hops. Tastes pretty good for a kolsch, albeit it tasted a bit more yeasty than other kolsches I have tried. It had some malt, followed by a tart lemon flavor and a bit of hops. Overall, this was a pretty decent beer, very drinkable and refreshing."
"Mouthfeel is crisp and not too watery. Drinkability is good. This one goes down real easy and has enough complexity going on to separate it from the macro-rice-and-corn brews."
"D: highly drinkable, great summer beer, true to style but a bit of a disappointment since kolsch is not a favorite (see above). Good camping beer, I didn't feel guilty drinking a couple straight from the bottle :)"
"The body is light with some sweet and floral finish. Very crisp and easy to drink. Nice carbonation. This is a good session beer with some minor flaws, but decent."
"Tasted on 5/4/08. Bottle stamped ""061808", I assume this to be a ""Best By"" date but it'd be nice if it were a little more clear."
"D: This beer didn't float my boat for some reason. However, it's a nice representation of the style. Definitely a good summer thirst quancher."
"Try though I might, I simply could not get any head to develop on this beer. The color, however, was a wonderfully clear golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. The nose had a light malty sweetness to it. The mouthfeel was thin-to-medium with a dry, light flavor on the tongue. The finish was likewise nicely dry. It was a perfect summertime ale."
"drinkability> would prefer a different kolsch, or a different Alaskan Brew beer."
"O/ M - Great for lighter style of beer. Light bitterness and carb. Crisp hops. Good session brew or while grilling during the summer! Brought back memories of time in Koln for the World Cup..."
"Drinkability - goes down easy, may serve well as a lawn day/pong beer"
"D: Great beer to finish the day after walking the streets and glaciers of Juneau."
"Nothing mind blowing.. but very drinkable and fairly refreshing after the last fiasco of a beer I had. I will definitely pick up again.. but I really want to try this side by side with a few other German representatives along with Sockeye's Kolsche and the Ram's. I am willing to bet, the Ram's will be the best of a very drinkable bunch with Sockeye and Reissdorf nipping at the heels."
"Point is, this is just right, it's from Alaska, it's got a bitchin' label, and it tastes really good for the price point. You can't go wrong."
"Drinks extremely easy, this will be a nice summer time staple, thanks for joining the party here Alaskan!"
"Thanks to Fordest for this- Dark yellow to light gold pour in a Kolsch glass. Big lasting white head, and a faint grassy, sweet malt smell. Was refreshing, sweet and nicely but mildly flavored of crisp malt. A bit watery especially in the finish, but still enough flavor to keep from being boring. This is a good Kolsch, but I'm starting to crave more flavorful beers as its cooling off."
"Flavor was heavier than other Kölsch beers I've tried: more like a kristalweizen than a Kölsch. A pleasant flavor, but I'm not sure this conforms to the style. Palate was a little thin and fizzy. Not a bad beer, but falls short of other offerings I've had from Alaskan Brewing."
"Beer poured with a pale amber color. Head was a cotton white with average to decent lacing. Smell was of lemongrass and corn and butter. Was pretty good tasting with nice oily nice malty taste. Mouthfeel was a mild carbonation and oily with barely any after taste. A good beer. Would drink in a bar if this was available and the only other beer they had was bud."
"This is a good beer if you like to barbecue outside or drink beer while physically working. Its a refreshing kolsch style with a litte less flavor than something like curveball by pyramid but smoother and easier to drink. Good with bar food like burgers or wings or cheesesteaks or something. I get it when i go to hooters. overall it should have more taste for a kolsch but the grain and hops are present."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not filling at all, mild kick, good representation of style, I could drink several of these and it has that refreshingness factor which makes it a nice summer seasonal worth drinking for a long time."
"Bottle: Poured an orangey color beer with an average size head with some medium retention. Aroma of grainy and somewhat unrefined grain is slightly bland. Taste is also dominated by some unrefined and grainy malt and some semi-sweetness. Body is slightly oily with a full body and some medium carbonation. Interesting take on the style but not something I would go for on a regular basis."
"Much better summer beers out there"
"The bottle has no born on date and show a beautiful orca in air. The summer ale is straw color that is not hazy. Very little head but looks to have a good amount of carbonation. The smell is definitely flavored with hops. The taste leans more to the hop side and finishes with a nice bitterness that lasts in the back of your throat. I would definitely drink this session beer again."
"Flavor is similarly clean, a little weak in the grain and hop department. Could use some buffering in the mouth and overall body. Easy to drink, sessionable summer ale, but not one I'll go out of my way for again."
"I'm not particuarly fond of the kölsch style, but this is one of the nicer and more enjoyable ones I've had. Worth a try."
"Poured a pale gold color with not much of a head into a mug. This beer smells fantastic! It has a very earthy smell to it. The body starts off light but has a lot of depth to it. Perfect mouthfeel, light, but with an understated malt presence. The hop presence is bitter but finishes dry with you wanting a little more. Great session beer if you consider 5.0 a session beer. I could drink a bunch of these on a hot summer day with some hot dogs to wash it down. Try it."
"it pours a nice frothy golden hue with a good lace forming. it's definately a light - medium bodied brew. it starts off medium and finishes light. usually i wouldn't like this, but it's blended quite well here. this is porch beer, without a doubt."
"Light sweet maltiness,an assortment of dried fruit tastes,bready,light on hops a very light citrus. Smooth bitterness with some tang. Light with slight cloying, not a crisp hoppyness like a lot of Kolsh beer i've tasted.Easy to drink,not as refeshing as i would like. Just didn't feel like a Kolsh to me. Sort of a letdown. Not bad,not a beer i would seek out again. Ordered this beer from Liquid Soluctions."
"Quite quaffable."
"D: Incredibly drinkable, perfect for the summer, a great beer on a hot summer's day to have."
"Drinkability - Pretty good. Not great, but well worth a taste."
"A decent patio beer when you don't want to analyze the hell out of what you are drinking."
"This beer has a hazy yellow color with a small head. The aroma was fairly weak consists of a (slight) wheat and citrus. The flavor again was a mixture of wheat and corn followed by a weak hops finish. Overall fairly bland, but goes down easy on a summer day."
"Very refreshing brew. Nothing really bad to say about the beer but nothing really stands out. I will say, that this is a nice choice for summer outdoor get togethers where you want to depart from the typical pilsner."
"D - A refreshing summer ale. A honey-like Kolsch with subtle peppery spiced yeast. A pleasantly malty ale with a dry aspect and clean finish."
"The appearance and aroma were disturbingly reminiscent of a macro, with a vaguely corn-like quality and a macro-brand of light hoppiness (think Coors Light). The flavor was clean, with a minimum of malt and hop flavors -- I struggled to identify any ale-like qualities. Since I normally don't drink Kolsches or Summer Ales or whatever you want to call this, I want to be fair, but this beer was all about refreshment and little more, and it wasn't particularly refreshing. (A good tripel can be very refreshing, and so much more.) I can appreciate that craft brewers may have to expand into more drinkable styles to survivie, but this just goes too far for me. Not recommended."
"Not the most memorable beer in the world, but a nice refresher better than most other summer beers I've had. I'd have it again if it was available where I live (never seen an Alaskan product in the Boston area)."
"poured from a 12oz bottle into a glass. VERY little head that disappeared quickly with no lacing on the glass. Color is orange. not quite amber but not yellow. I detected a hint of citrus, hops and maybe even grapes. The taste is crisp and clean goes down smooth and hints of citrus, a little bitterness afterwards. On the way down it trickles down the throat smooth and light. decent ale quenches the thirst. I'd drink this again."
"Refreshing, not that complex. It does its job at quenching my thirst, but doesn't leave me awed. I'll bet the second tastes better..."
"Pours a light amber with ample white head. A touch of citrus comes through in the subdued nose. Malty and toasty with subtle hops in the background. Clean but not particularly complex. Fairly light-bodied stuff, but creamier than I was expecting. Nothing too special here, but definitely a solid, sessionable beer."
"Pours clear topaz with a light hazy-yellow tone and blonde flecks. Small, very fizzy white head dies down right away; no lacing at all. Aroma is strong, sweetly spicy, and sudsy, with a nice bready malt background. Mouthfeel is quite watery; very light-bodied. Flavor hits immediately with very buttery, toasted, lightly nutty malts. The lightest touch of pine and resin hops follow, along with a bit of dryness. Cereal malts return in the finish, which is clean, sudsy, and smooth. Very little in the way of aftertaste."
"This poured a medium amber color that had medium head that disappeared quickly. The smell reminded me of Alaska Amber. In fact, the whole beer itself reminded me of Alaska Amber. It was a little heavier and had a little more substance than I was expecting in a summer ale. Flavor and substance are great but in a Summer beer I would like it to be a little lighter and focused more on thirst refreshment. Therefore, if I had a choice I would probably go with another Summer Ale."
"I've been wanting to try this one, and thank bitterbill for including in our trade!"
"Had on tap at Naja's in Redondo Beach. I rated this based on Kolsch, a style I've really started to like. But this version of Kolsch just didn't do it for me. It missed the subtle but funky aroma and flavors from my favorites from Cologne, replacing with a light bitter bite and extremely neutral flavor. The best I can say is that it was refreshing. Alaskan Amber is really good but I can't recommend the Summer Ale."
"Drinkability: Nice fruity tones make this a terrific example of the style"
"Bottom line: It's called Summer Ale for a reason, me thinks and it's a good one to turn to in the hot summer months. I recommend it."
"A solid Summer Ale from a good brewery."
"I really found this one to be nice. Easy drinking and refreshing. Thanks to orrshow for splitting the bomber."
"This would be perfect for a nice summer day."
"Bright gold in color, clear with white, fluffy head. Wonderful lacing. Light, crisp aroma - very low malt aroma with fruity hop notes. Light taste - a bit of dryness, very low malt profile, light fruity sweetness. Light body. Light mouthfeel and very drinkable. Very pleasant brew, nice for a hot day."
"taste is inoffensive but exceptionally bland. smooth and watery like an american macro, just not doing a lot for me. the fiishand aftertasste is pleasent but not very exciting."
"This bottle showed up out of nowhere at a friend's bar and he gave it to me. I have no idea how fresh this was or how the bottle was handled, so it's probably not fair to be overly critical. However, what I got out of this was merely an OK beer at best."
"Definitely worth checking this one out."
"Beer poured a golden color with a decent sustained head. Nose is pretty non-descript, nothing special noted. Taste is especially crisp and clean, a fine combination of malts and hops. Mouthfeel is nicely crisp and it cleanses the palate well. Drinkability is good, a nice refreshing beer for an 80 degree Phoenix day."
"D - Drinkable. Not a bad brew, but not really my cup of tea."
"As far as this beer's style accuracy, I can't say I would rate it very high, but styles are just that - styles. I'm not too picky as far as styles as long as the beer is good...and I think this beer is a great summer-time midnight-sun brew..."
"It is quite drinkable. I'd prefer a bit of hop to balance it out, but all and all pretty good."
"This is a wonderful facsimile of a Kolsch with a healthy dose of American Hops. Typical Kolsch hazy yellow color, abundant white head with sticky lace, aroma of bread and viney hops. Taste is crisp, bracing hops with bready malt notes. A very refreshing tasty brew."
"The berry note continues through to the flavor of this beer, it is again the most pronounced note as well. A sweet malty note accentuates the fruit character as well. A sharp, clean, yet in no way dominating, bitterness is found throughout the flavor profile of this beer, and helps to temper the slightly heavier body that is contributed by the sweetness. It seems to disappear in the long finish, where a malty, caramelized grain note seems to linger. Perhaps a touch fruitier than I was expecting from a Kölsch, but it adds a touch more character to this beer. Certainly a tasty tipple, especially for a hot summer's day; I certainly am enjoying it."
"Taste is quite nice. A good grainy front with tones of fruit through the middle. I like it. It easy easy to drink and highly sessionable. Wouldn't mind having it around on a hot summer evening."
"Drinkability: refreshing and enjoyable. Got to enjoy this on a cruise in Seattle, and this was a perfect beer to enjoy the sunshine and skyline."
"Cheers!"
"drinkability: strong"
"Mild ABV with a medium body, quite easy to drink and worth a try for something different...cheers."
"Pale straw color, lots of bubbles but it doesn't add up to any head. Light bready malt aroma present in the nose, with a hint of fruit, perhaps lemon, hard to discern. The flavor carries more of the bready malt flavor and has a slight sourness and touch of bitterness in the finish to keep it interesting. Mouthfeel is light but not watery, plenty of carbonation. This beer was very easy to drink and refreshing. I think this is my first Kolsch so I was pleased that although it looked like a macro lager it didn't taste like one. Not bad and definitely a nice summertime choice."
"12oz bottle with a cool label featuring an Orca in mid flight at sunset. The pour is golden, but somewhat darker than I had expected. The white head rescinds to a thin ring of lace fairly quickly. The nose is very soft with grain and slight floral and citrus hop aromas. The taste starts off doughy, then spices come in and caramel malt makes a brief appearance. Fruity, citrus and pear, and floral hops hang around in the background before helping to give this beer a nice crisp finish. This beer is refreshing, but it doesn't do a whole lot for me. Maybe these summer beers work better for those who live where there truly are all four seasons."
"I think I have a new session brew for the summer."
"Very drinkable. Favorable comparison to summer wheat beers."
"This is a very drinkable beer, especially for the summer season. Im not a big fan of the style, but I would probably have it again."
"Poured a crystal clear straw color with white head that subsided to a thin layer of foam. The aroma is a very light bready scent with a touch of floral hops. The flavor is very clean and has a bit of a grainy huskiness to it. The bitterness is so slight that from years of drinking IPAs and barleywines I can't really even taste it. So to me this ale needs a bit more hops at least in the flavor category or maybe a touch more bitterness. Tastes like an all malt beer though and that keeps me coming back for more though for the price I would probably go for a Warsteiner as a great summer quencher. Great drinkability but I am a hop lover so I would grab a Pils next time."
"Easily drinkable. A solid, tasty beer."
"The beer renounces the 12-ounce brown bottle a slightly hazy bright gold, the head is a brilliant white with a semi-creamy texture and the size average, lace forms a solid blanket to conceal the glass. Nose has a citrus like crispness, mainly sweet malt, with a nice hint of hop floral spiciness, start is somewhat sweet, the grain profile perfect and the top light to moderate in feel. Finish is prickly in its acidity, the hops strong and pleasing to the palate, very dry and a real treat to this old beer swiller, cant tell you how happy I am to have Alaskan brewery beers readily available here in Arizona."
"This isn't too bad really. Good carbonation, and fairly crisp finish. There is a slight lingering of sweet malts which I could have done without."
"Exceptionally drinkable beer, this will likely become a staple of this summer's festivities at my house and other places of gathering where good beer is needed!"
"I could drink these all night. Literally."
"You get the idea...it's a cold March day and I'm thinking of California sunshine while enjoying this brew."
"Comments - Stylistically, does this beer fit? If you check the BJCP guidelines, the answer is a moderately strong ""yes."" I say this beer is worth a try."
"There is a biscuity yeast presence and a lite grassy dry hop note on the finish. This is a decent beer that would be really good on hot day. Just doesnt stack up for 40 degree November nite. If you see it in summer buy and drink then dont wait."
"This Kolsch-style ale pours a rich golden blond with amber highlights. The head is virtually nonexistant and disappears immediately. A yeasty aroma of fresh baked pastries along with just a hint of spice wafts from the glass. The yeasty element continues in the flavor, along with notes of caramel and butterscotch, balanced nicely with lightly hoppy flavors of grass and grain. The finish smacks delicately of bubblegum. . . a great hot weather beer!"
"I'm not sure on this one. Decent? Maybe, but its not a tough one to drink thats for sure."
"A very nice Kolsch seemed true to style to me. Ill be getting this one again."
"Adaquate take on an unusual ale, but since most supermarket ""import"" lagers have a similar flavor -- and some carbonation -- I wouldn't seek this out. Hey, it's a tough style; at least they gave it a shot. That said, save your pennies for their mindblowing smoked porter this winter."
"Drinkability was quite good... it went down well, and easily. I could have had another without problem."
"A great summer brew and one that I was hoping I could find again."
"Drinkability- Didn't really do it for me. A bit too sweet and not many hops involved. Was a bit disappointed with this one."
"This is a fine summer beer that has real flavour and respect for the style. Pours blonde with a white head, the nose is fresh and slightly fruity. The taste is thirst quenching and clean with a sloid midbody. Like most Kolschs this is not a hoppy beer but rather a solid hot weather charmer."
"This was a pleasant beer to quaff. If I hadn't been working on my ""Tour De Beer"" sheet, I might have had another, as it went down pretty easy - not surprising since that's basically it's job."
"Medium golden honey with a light, tight, off-white head. Big aroma for a kolsch. Cooked vegetables, honey sweet malts, with a mild hop spiciness. Almost smells like a bock! Light fruity flavors up front, turn to vegetal with some honey sweet malt. Spicy hops add light bitterness. Finish is mostly lingering honey-ish malt with vegetal hop spice. Medium bodied, and not as light as it looks or as you'd expect from the style. A nice spring/summer gulper."
"Many thanks to HardTarget for sharing this rarity."
"Overall impression: This is a great summer (or in my case almost-spring) beer. Very balanced, and nice drinkability. It still has enough flavor to keep it interesting. Nice summer session beer."
"Alaskan Summer, huh? Whats next, Jamaican Winter beer? But seriously folks, this beer was a nice surprise from the mother-in-law who went on an Alaskan cruise. Its great to have everyone you know trained to look for beer any time they travel. The Free Willy scene on the label is interesting too. As for the beer, it is a clear light orange color with a thin white head. Very little lacing. The aroma is light citrus and hops. Light and crisp mouthfeel, with sweet fruit, malt and hops flavors. Citrus comes in again with the finish, with a bit of lingering caramel. Overall this is a decent Kölsch."
"Alaskan Summer Ale is an unassuming, unchallenging, balanced, drinkable summer ale. It isn't overly impressive, but then I don't need to be blown away by every beer that I crack open. It does what it was undoubtedly designed to do."
"The color was a clear light yellow with very little foam. The smell of malts and hops filled the nose. The taste was mild with a nice balance of hops and malts. The flavor was pleasant and a great quincher on a hot day. Although this ale was just upbove average, it was still a decsent ale."
"Crisp as the day is long. Beer doesn't get more drinkable than this."
"Drinkability was perfect for a warm summer evening. This is one I'd consider stocking full-time in my DBF."
"A fine, malty golden ale from Alaska. Pours gold, somewhat flat. Ho hum aroma of light malts and a sort of animal funk. Odor improves as the beer is drunk, and warms up. Flavor is bursting with maltiness, authentically German in that regard. The malts are not too sweet, nor too grainy. They are just right. Forgive my inability to elaborate further, but they are simply pleasing me immensely. Water quality seems very crisp and refreshing, more like NW glacier water than authentic kolsch water, but it works. Yeast is pretty mild, provides a slight fuzziness that I suppose is unavoidable. Hops are totally out of the spotlight, doing exactly what is required of them and nothing more: little to no bitterness, a light tap dance across the tongue, and providing a definitive finish to the flavor profile. Excellent and addictive aftertaste. I am really enjoying this beer, and am having some difficulty stopping drinking it."
"This beer is a light gold, head retention and lacing sucked. It got better from there. Nice earthy smell of sweet malt and grain. Smooth refreshing malty taste with a light fruity character. Subtle hopping which I presume is normal for this style. Light mouthfeel, refreshing and highly drinkable. A good choice for quaffing, when that is what you're looking for."
"Pours from a 12oz bottle with a light golden color with a light bubbly head that lingers a bit. Nice aroma of light floral hops and yeast. Good carbonation. Very crisp, clean taste of light hops, balanced by a touch of malty sweetness. A great session beer for summer."
"A super tasty and drinkable brew, I could drink this often."
"Alaskan Summer Ale was served from a 12oz. bottle. In a pint glass, the beer was a honey-golden color and was topped by a minmal white head that quickly disapated into a ring form. The nose has a wheaty-cracker, chalky component, and sported a rich german style hop bouquet. The brew presented robust yet crisp and firm malt taste, with a zippy citric-peel transition into a nicely bittered and rounded clean finish. The full body was structured wonderfully and the carbonation was spot-on for the presentation of the flavors. Tasty, clean, and refreshing, this beer makes for a good partner for widdling away a hot summer day."
"Alaskan Summer Ale pours a very light color for an ale, a darker shade of yellow with no head to speak of, lacing left on the glass was pathetic. Apperance aside this is one great beer, the smell blasts you with the right combo of hops and citrus, lemons to be exact. The taste is very light but of citrus and malts, hops bring up the rear. Feels very dry and crisp in the mouth. A very drinkable summer brew, could be my new summer bbq beer. Great for the outdoors."
"Light malt aroma, slightly fruity. Lilttle bit of wheat and citrus, and oddly, some smoke. Overall, weak balanced aroma. Dark golden yellow clear, but no head. Palate is medium watery with medium smooth carb. Light malt sweet and soft hops taste. Watery, with grain finish and light sweet after. Very little bitterness at all. Light fruity taste. Pretty refreshing."
"I had this beer beside a bonfire on the Oregon Coast, so I a little trouble seeing the color. Nice floral aroma, cloudy gold color by firelight. Good use of hops instead of lemon. It had a flavorful hop finish with just a bit of astringence. I found it to be more malty than the usual citrusy character of other summer beers which I am not a big fan of. Definately my favorite Summer ale."
"Drinkability  Clearly Alaska Brewing was no match for this difficult style."
"Thanks to Weefisheads for the sample!"
"Thanks to Reidrover for this difficult to find in the Northeast beer."
"Smooth, easy sailing. Just like the Orca catching some wind on the bottle's label."
"Pours a nice light but somewhat hazy golden. Smell is very subtle, only hits of what the taste will be. There's a nice crown of foam, which lasts through the beer. The taste is crisp, warm, and almost coppery. Much friendlier flavors than some other kolsches, and a very drinkable beer."
"A nice summer beer"
"Overall Impression: This is a great beer and one that I definitely look forward to every summer. Though it's usually superbly refreshing on a hot day, it can sometimes play out a bit too sweet. Also, I'd be willing to bet they use the same yeast in this as they do in their Amber. Similar flavor profile."
"Light gold color, small head. A light bodied kolsch-style ale. Light malts and hops. Slightly spicy and sweet. Nice flavor. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is very slightly bitter. Nice interesting beer. Light and refreshing. Nice summer beer."
"Flavor is sweet and grainy with fruity caramel tone. Hops finally appear in the finish lending a clearing bite."
"Verey nice for me this is a good beer."
"I thought this was a good summer edition. Nothing really stuck out to much, just that it was smooth. nice dark yellowish color and firm small head. Had a good sweetness, not to bitter, with well balanced hop and malt. Felt a little light, needed a bit more body. I'd have another but not if a Alaskan Pale was near."
"Well, uglyguy must have gotten a bad bottle, this bottle was bought in Anchorage maybe that makes a difference.  The head was real good but didn't last too long.  Low on the bitterness scale and a slightly sweet flavor one of the best Kölschs I have had.  Good balance of hops and malt."
"Alaskan BC has done it again.  This Kolsh style corn colored offering and foamy yellowish head live up to the usual standards.  Aromas of German hops and malts as well as a hint of German ale yeast intorduce a sweet medium bodied VERY smooth beer.  Awesome."
