"Love it! I actually brewed Kolsch because of this. Went for a brewery tour and the guys are so cool and friendly."

"My favorite by far from this brewer.   I snowshoed into some backcountry up northwest of Finland, MN last winter, and I had three Kayaks in my pack.  I stuck 'em in a snowbank while we got a fire going, and MAN, was that some good beer.  I recommend that approach, but it's good any time."

"Poured into a Sester stange. Pours a medium golden amber with a fine one finger white head with great retention and lacing. Aroma of sweet malt, clove, light wheat. Flavor is light sweet malt, wheat, clove, light lemon citrus; finishes with sweet wheat and light close, a hint of hop bitterness. Light bodied. A nice, refreshing kolsch style ale with the approprate light malt and spicing. Perhaps a bit sweeter and clove spicy than traditional, but still enjoyable and pleasant."

"Fruity, amazingly delicate malt bill...a fantastic example of the style."

"O- A fairly normal kolsch. It tastes fine and is fairly easy drinking. Not quite as clean as most in the style, but it's decent. Worth a try."
""
"Overall - As a whole, there's nothing really outstanding that I can say about this beer aside from it's honey-like flavor, which could've been a little stronger. As such, it's not outstanding beer but it's still a decent brew."
""
"Very well made Kolsch right here. A great intro to craft for BMC folks too. Very sessionable brew that would be perfect for summer. Not many brewers tackle this style, but I wish they would. Glad to have a local option available."
""
""
"Keeping in mind I've had this beer in the fridge for over 6 months, I'd say its held up quite well. The Kolsch style is one we should be consuming rather fresh yet despite its age, this beer is still very refreshing with crisp malty bite, a body that doesn't interfere with the subtle flavors, and a bustling carbonation to perk up your palette."

"Cheers!"

"Brew pours a translucent golden yellow with a thin white head. Aromas mostly of grain, noble hop aroma, and notes of grape. Tastes as it smells, I get grain and cereal malt as the base of the flavor, grape hangs in the background, finishes with yeast and very very mild hop bitterness. Feels crisp and refreshing, a light bodied, lightly carbonated, very sessionable brew."
"Nothing jumps out at me about this beer, but I'm really enjoying it. It has a touch of sour, kinda like Bell's Oarsman but less so, that I'm really enjoying on this hot summer day. A balanced, mostly malty, light beer, but flavorful and refreshing."
"O- A nice sessionable beer for the summer. It's quite different from other Kolch's I've had before, but not bad for the style."
"Very drinkable with a pleasing aftertaste of cereal and citrus. Clean and crisp. The better-than-lager alternative."
"drinkability: could be sessionable - but i find the grainy finish offputting"
"Drinkability is very good. One of the best takes on this style I've had."
"Refreshing and a little subtle this beer fits in to the Kolsch paradigm well."
"I'm very happy to still see this brand around town at retail, as there's no doubt plenty of competition for just such a beer in the marketplace."
"D= pretty decent session beer. Good summertime brew. This is the first of the style I've had and I haven't heard many good things about the style but this is ok. Not amazing or blow you away at all but a little different and refreshing."
"Poured a 12oz. into my Horny Goat pint glass. Vibrant yellowish-orange hue with a weak head that dissipated quick not leaving a whole lot of lacing. Smells fresh and lemony, not a very powerful scent but still nice. Smooth and fresh tasting with very little aftertaste. Very tiny amount of hoppy bite on the front with a slightly fruity back. Not very complex but kolsch is not the wildest variety of brew. I like it a lot, perfect session beer for a hot summer day."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable. I could see drinking several bottles of this. It would make a nice session beer."
"Overall: Aroma and taste is a little muted but it truly is refreshing. I could see enjoying this all day long during a hot summer."
"Mouthfeel is crisp and light. Very nicely drinkable. I enjoyed this one a lot."
"D- This was a real shocker for me. I was really impressed by how true this kolsch is to the style. I will definitely have this again."
"I've only had one other kolsch-style beer (also not a ""true"" Kolsch), so I can't say one way or the other whether it's true to style. I just liked it."
"It tastes fruity sweet as well with just a little diacetyl in the background. The fruit I would describe it tasting like would be grapefruit, lemons, and white grapes. A better tasting Kolsch. It has a light mouthfeel but the lack of carbonation really hurts its drinkability. Maybe I had an old bottle but I enjoyed enough of the beer to give it another try in the summer when a beer like this would be better appreciated."
"Very nice stuff."
"Very easy to drink, very easy to like. A solid brew for summer sipping, just a little bit different than many typical summer beers, yet nothing that strange either. I'd easily have another if I had another. Thanks to mnwags for this bottle."
"D- Very nice."
"A tasty, straightforward, and worthwhile light beer. Kudos to the brewers in West Duluth for this offering. Don't miss it if you're in the Duluth area."
"D - Pretty good, just don't judge by the look of it. It's a light refreshing beer for the summer. Just like a Kölsch ought to be."
"D - My initial reaction to this beer was lower, but I tried a couple more and realized it was much better than my first impression."
"This is a very drinkable beer, as well."
"I, fittingly, had this beer on tap about 60 ft from the shores of Lake Superior, in the Northern Lights restaurant in Beaver Bay, MN (surprising number of quality beers on tap there, by the way). It had a bit of a straw-like quality to the color. Rather pale, but with a slight orange glow. It was a sweet taste, a little more than expected. Faint taste of grapes, maybe? Good mouthfeel, maybe a bit high on the carbonation, but satisfying to keep in there and swish about. Very dry finish. Good beer, but not so much so that I won't look to sample a different tap beer the next time in that place."
"D- Goes down easy I would be surprised if a Kolsch didn't."
"Originally reviewed April 29, 2005. 12 Oz Bottle. Slightly hazy rich golden pour, with a full finger of crystal white head, diminishing. Aroma of terse hops and esters. Im having problems with this brewers beers tasting like stryofoam right off the bat. Im getting some notes of wheat, hops, and sourness. The finish continues with rubbery esters and then morphs into a mellow lemon wheat. I think that its just me. Im trying to rate this in fairness, beyond the stryofoam. I review beers that might be infected, because if that's what the brewer puts out there, then that's what I'm getting. And especially with this brewery, infection has been a rampant problem. I've had three bottles of this particular style and they've all been the same."
"Popured a slighly hazy golden color with moderate white puffy head. Smell is minimal with a slight fruitiness present. Taste follows through on the smell with a mild summer fruit note present. Very nice drinkability. A nice thirst quencher. Goos session beer for a hot summer day."
"Definately a simple but tasteful beer here. Great for summer. Pours a nice gold with white head. Smells sweet and light. Tastes of slightly caramel malts, not much bitterness, but a little bit of citrus. Quite pleasant. At first I wished it were a touch more crisp, but I'd say carbonation is on for the style. Comparable to just about anyone's kolsch or ""summer ale."" Cheers."
"Doverall, it is good. I can see this as a summer quencher by the pool. Very drinkable."
"I could see having 1 or 2 of these, much like everything else LSBC makes, it's very approachable, not overly challenging (which is fine IMO). All in all, a decent effort, I'll need to try some others in this category before determining how it compares."
"This brew pours a semi-cloudy golden orange color with a large creamy white head. The aroma is malty with some tangy untertones. The taste is quite pleasant. Orange with some nice tanginess. The mouthfell is medium-light bodied with ample carbonation. Overall, this is a might fine brew. It is a lot tastier than I had anticipated, and quite relaxing."
"Drinkability: This one is pretty good for drinkability, worth a try and surely not one to turn away."
"I have a digital camera, so maybe I will get a picture of this beer for the web-site in the future."
"Damn nice beer.refreshing, clean, a nice tasting Kolschseems very fresh"
"Pours a hazy gold color with a small creamy white head. Smell is a very light floral hops, and even light malt scents. Taste is extremely light on the palate, never challenging, and very smooth. Lemon lime sodaesque, with some grainy heartiness. Good for summer, I am sure, even though it is February."
"Another ""better on tap beer than in the bottle."" Pours a light hazy golden straw with a puffy cloud white head. Smells of apple tart malt, complemented by mellow hop overtones. Taste is juicy, slightly tart apple fruitiness, but light--not verly sweet or fruity. Hops come in for balance and add a nice floral bitterness. Surprisingly not too light bodied, with refreshing carbonation and a nice spring/summer ale."
"On-Tap: Translucent goldish yellow color with a strong puffy foamed white head that stays present from the pour off the tap, lacing in lots of spots and some strings. Smell is a bit sweet and fresh of light pine and citrus and a touch of a mineral/vitamin-like note. Taste has the same qualities with a short but sustained little sweetness thats a bit citrusy, light pineyness and floral notes and a crisp light finish with a touch of the mineral/vitamin-like tinge coming through in some of the lingering. Feel is light bodied feel and has a little grab, but nothing to holding or strong. Good drinkablity and pleasurable enough from the tap but not really worth another."
"This one pours out a crisp, clear golden color. The white head on top is small and quick to exit. The basic taste/smell is floral hops, its not bad tasting, its just a thin tasting drink. I would imagine it is pretty light too. I havent had too many of this style yet, so i may not be the best person to ask."
"Aroma is initially a light sweet malt that quickly turns to a more sour quality, leveling off with a hop floweriness mixed with the sourness. Darker golden color and clear. Smallish head but decent stamina. Light in overall flavor. Mix has similar qualites of the aroma, that being a base of malt surrounded by the slight sourness and a shot of bitterness from the hops. Probably a little too sour. For an ale I find it lacks enough combination of smoothness and creaminess this style often entails, containing only some smoothness. Overall an average beer. I think a little too sour and bitter for style, and that prevents it from being a nice summer ale too."
"Thanks feloniousmonk!"
"On the pour a lightly hazy golden yellow color, the head modest in size, frothy, bright white in color and the lace a nice sheet to conceal the glass. Nose is malt, slightly sweet and buttery, crisp and clean with the start a pleasant sweet malt, top is a bit thin and the finish pleasantly hopped, the acidity mild and the aftertaste dry. A bit thin waisted for me, but I think it would make a nice session beer."
"I imagine this beer would be a decent summer light-bodied beer, but I would not go out of my way to purchase it again."
"A fine enough ale, but I can't shake that they missed the mark a bit if they were brewing a kolsch."
"This hazy yellow beer throws a good 1 inch head that gives some decent lacing.  This brew has got something wrong in the aroma.  I get a menthonal like odor.  Way off, especially for a Kolsch.  IPA or PA might get away with it by saying it has an extreme pine odor, but not this style.  Drinking this beer is like drinking diluted Pine Sol.  Just not worth it.  I don't think I'll waste the space in my stomach with this one."
"Pale straw color, aroma is mild but fresh.  Very fleeting and delicate flavor, even for this style.  But, retains mouthfeel very well.  This is pretty drinkable when I'm in the mood for subtle malt thirst quenching."
