"I first had Fruh in Koln, my German hosts who lived there recommended it highly on the hot summer day. They drank it half/half with Fanta orange soda and while I took a sip that way, I preferred mine regular. Poured in a Koln style glass, I found it very refreshing, more like a lager than a pale ale. Look was super clear in the glass with a small head, light hop flavor. Very tasty. I have a 6-pac waiting in my fridge for summer.  It's almost impossible to find in the US, luckily I have it hand delivered by my friends every year. If you are ever where this is available, you must give it a try."
"Tasty Kölsch love the style it's good but not Sünner"

"Poured into a pint glass. Pours a clear light golden amber with a thin white head that dissipates to a thin film leaving light lacing. Aroma of biscuit malt, light European hops. Flavor follows aroma, mildly sweet biscuit malt, light grassy hops, mixed grain, hints of apple juice. Finishes with dry biscuit and grassy hops. Light bodied with nice carbonation. A nicely made kolsch, with a classic malt complement. Well balanced. Light flavored, as appropriate for the style, but nice biscuit and light hopping. Finishing flavor perhaps a bit thinner than other kolsches, but still satisfying."
"O:  really good for what it is.  nice and bright flavors with a solid mouthfeel.  definitely a tasty beer on the lighter side of the scale.  No apparent faults in my mind.  I got this one from somebody that just came back from Germany so it's probably pretty fresh compared to a lot of shelf stock."
"Very tasty and light beer."

"Love it! Great light beer."

"Overall, it is rather solid and satisfying and otherwise certainly fits the bill, but it presents a little too much plastic-like bitterness."

"Poured into a half-liter weissbier glass, nice fluffy white head, faded quickly to a light film of bubbles. Clear pale yellow, with a lot of carbonation bubbles continually rising to refresh the film. the nose is a bit lemony, with some nice light roast malt notes in the background, along with some slight grassy aromas. The taste is very bitter up front, with a touch of tartness and followed by a nice bit of malty sweetness. The mouthfeel is thin, crisp and somewhat dry, but super refreshing - seems like the perfect after-work beer! Overall, i really liked this beer, as a session beer - it's top-notch."
"Crisp, clean and German."

"Food match: A Köln specialty Himmel un Ääd (or Heaven and Earth) roasted apple and semi-mashed potatoes, with fried onion topping, served with the classic blood sausage is a definite great pairing for this brew."

"Good, clean, crisp. Perfect on a warm autumn evening. Poured yellow-gold, fluffy white head; sticky lacing. Clean malty smell; slight spice in the nose, with a hint of grainy malt; Tastes consisted of a little lemon, malt, and smooth at first, with a sweetish/dry aftertaste. Decent beer, easy drinking. Quaffed a couple 16 oz. bottles . Good beer for warm weather."

"Review based on the BJCP2008 guidelines (style 6C). Bottle 50 cl - Batch 11816:27. AROMA: slightly sweet cereal aromas. no hop aromas. slight esters reminiscent of pears. APPEARANCE: slightly light gold color and very translucent. thin white head with average retention. TASTE: low malty sweet flavour. very low bitterness. no hop flavours. PALATE: low and watery body. low carbonation. OVERALL: a watered down Kolsch without the characteristic subtle fruit flavours."

"Mouthfeel: Light to light Medium body. Medium carbonation. A little hop tartness from the finish is really the only sensation that stays with me throughout the finish otherwise all the soft feelings dissipate quickly."
"M: Not the best Kolsch I’ve had, but happy to find the style in Thailand just the same.  Lacking in the white wine quality, perhaps this one is slightly old and losing its touch.  I’ve had some of the best Kolsches around, and some good American copies, but this isn’t the most awesome, but it’s the style, so I’m happy.   Drank in Chiang Mai, Thailand, Sept 27th, 2014."

"Out of a bottle while hanging out in Cologne. Pours clear golden with nearly no head. Aroma of hay, light pale malt sweetness, unpleasant Kolsch aroma. Flavor follows the aroma with a slightly dirty finish, though I found it a bit cleaner than the Paffgen I had earlier today. Light bodied of course, goes down easy enough, medium carbonation. Meh."
"Crisp and refreshing with that distinct kölsch flavor."

"0,5 l bottle into a plastic pint after sauna. Beautiful straw color with a two finger white head and effervescent bubbling. Somewhat sweet floral smell with a hint of fresh grass. Crisp taste of grainy malts with notes of apple and grassy hops. Very balanced and drinkable. Medium-light body, medium carbonation. Overall a really pleasant beer after a hot day and sauna. Didn't last long in the pint and left me wanting another."

""

"Very similar to a pale lager in a lot of ways & I wasn't particularly impressed with this one really. It was a drinkable beer & it's always nice to get a new style under my belt but I didn't think it was a great beer really."

"Clean flavor. The white grape is noticeable at the end, but not dominant. Good combo of hop zip and carbonation. This is a porch pounding beer and would go quite well with grilled white meats and salads"

" The taste is malt oriented with mild entry and gentle hops which are herbal with not overly bitter taste. The yeast adds fruitiness with subtle hint of alcohol in the background and pilsner malt taste throughout which is refined and subtle but hops have a toned down effect. This is a great kolsch -might be one of the best I have had it is a treat to sip and savor I would have got more if I could I love the subtlety and drinkability."

"I really liked this beer and hope to get more of this specific brand as well as some other Kolschs. It would be perfect on a hot day sitting on my deck."
""

"O: Reminds me of the sips of beer my German grandfather gave me when I was little. For me a kölsch from Cologne is a definitive light German ale and there is none better than Früh."
"O: Quite drinkable. Real German stuff..."

"Overall: Never seen this before here and Boston. For a kolsch style from the town it originated in, this beer is traditional and classic. I will be getting more in the future."
""
""
"Taste is clean and similarly malty, buttered biscuits, dough, dried grass, and some white grape character from the Kölsch yeast. Feel is crisp and the body is supple, very easy to drink with a dry aftertaste. Overall this was a good Kölsch, would try again, and look for a fresher date on the bottle."
"Pours a clear yellow with a foamy white head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and grassy aromas. Taste is much the same with grain and grass flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is tasty but the flavors are a bit too mild in my opinion."

"But its that friendly fruity/floral character that sets this Kolsch apart. Its a fresh and crisp taste, texture and aromatic sense that allows a lively mood to spring forth. Its delicate, flavorful and soft from start to finish."

"According to Warner in his book on brewing kolsch, this is one of the palest of the bunch and indeed, looks like a cheap adjunct lager: A very pale straw color with a small quantity of white foam, effervescent and bright. Fortunately it does not taste like said adjunct lager and the robust carbonation does not sear the tongue. Currently on tap at Beer Revolution in Calgary and a very cool find. Aroma is very fruity, robust white grape and lemon rind along with fresh doughy malt and a pleasant acid tang. Nothing dark at all. Tastes exactly like it smells. I have yet to try many examples of this style but this is the fruitiest to date, with that musty white grape character on the nose carrying over onto the palate. The malt is subtle yet flavorful, white buttermilk biscuits come to mind along with a sweet cereal character. Crisp, fairly dry, and creamy smooth. The hops are mellow and tastefully done, yielding a fragrant hay sort of vibe but without too many floral or spice notes. Thin to moderate body with maybe a bit of chalk. Classic kolsch really. Eminently drinkable but not lacking in flavor."

"A fresh (despite the real time and distance between me and the source of this offering) pale Euro lager, meant more for sunny, humid outdoor patio drinking orgies, rather than a mid-December northern climate's, um, huddlings, but things being as they are, I verily appreciate the out of season images this one paints in my head - ja, Fraulein, I would very much like another."
"My pour created a finger of fizzy, bone-white head with moderate retention. Color was a button-bright straw-yellow (SRM = > 2, < 4). Stunning! Nose had a grape-y, vinous quality mentioned in the description on this site, slightly tart, kind of sour. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was of freshly mown hay. It was very malty and the grape aspect was hardly noticeable in the mouth. The finish was unexpectedly dry and here the vinousness returned. This well worth what I paid for it and although not worth actively pursuing, it would be a welcome find on a shelf."

"Poured from a brown 16.9 oz. bottle. Has a pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts, some floral hops. Taste is mild, malty, a bit bready, some floral hops, a hint of sweetness. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a decent and refreshing beer, probably better suited to the summer."

"Clean, crisp, refreshing malts and no bitter aftertaste. A light mouthfeel.perfect beer for a hot summer day. Love this style of beer. Worthy of repeating and stocking in the fridge."

"500 ml bottle. Served in a stange, the beer pours a clear straw gold color with about an inch white head that stays around for a long time. There's also a good amount of lacing. Aroma is mostly grainy/bready malt, along with some light herbalness and fruit, mainly grapes. The brew tastes like grainy/bready malt, light grassy/herbal hops, and some grapes. Mouthfeel/body is light, it's crisp, refreshing and easy to drink. It's well carbonated, too. Not a bad beer at all, I'd buy this again at $3.49 a bottle."

"Minerally overall, with slightly citrusy notes at the base and significant malt presence. Refreshing, yet substantial flavor."

"O: Truth be told, I really enjoy a good kolsch - and this is definitely a very good, even great, example of an (underappreciated) style. And it's cheap, to boot!"
"Remarks: Did not score A, T, S, M at that time; so please disregard those scores"

"A good kölsch, but definitely more fragile than the average one in the style. I do enjoy the lightened, crisp feel of the body, as well as the green-ish hop profile, but it does lack a little bit of the concentrated fruitiness I enjoy when they are good. Worked very well as an aperitif before my meal. I could definitely have a bunch of these in one setting and not complain, although it would be far more for the refreshing experience it provides above anything else."

""

"Drinking Kolsch always reminds me of the one glaring gap in my glass collection - I need a stange."
"O: Having been to Köln and tasted several kölschs while I was there, I think this is a very good representation of the style. It is quite drinkable and would pair well with food."
"Very refreshing, if a little unremarkable. I'd enjoy again, but perhaps not specifically go and seek it out."
""
""
""
"Beer is easy drinking and wet, nice and sweet but not cloying or overpowering, light in body, nice grain, nice finish, very nice beer. Yeah, I'd have this again."
"Overall – A quite easy drinking Kolsh with a nice crisp finish."
""
"Very tart and complex, crisp and clean. The taste of this beer is very far removed from other beers that I've had."
""
""
"Half litre bottle, poured into a pint glass. Pale colour, one finger head which was quick to disappear, kept some lacing, clear. Aroma was Chardonay and vanilla. Tasted cranberry, Chardonay, vanilla and yeast. Finish was delayed and wheaty. Crisp texture, well carbonated which gave it a slightly coarse edge. Enjoyable beer, made me want to explore the style further, bit of a palate changer."
""
""
""
""
"Sweet graininess, light body and light effervescence. Toasted grain, faint butteriness, tart fruit flavors, bit of apple, sweet grain husk, Faint fruity hoppy bitterness to balance. Pretty good, very clean with good flavors and goes down like water."
"Overall a real great simple drinking Kolsch, the ultimate Kolsch quest continues in earnest. I would love to try this side by side with Reissdorf, but I could have this VERY often!"
"I do believe I've found my favorite Kölsch. A delight."
"So kölsch is ok. It's cool drinking it outside on a sunny day shootin the scheisse."
""
""
""
""
"It's the first time I drink this style, and I didn't find it much different than a lager, also, since it's the first time, I don't have anything to compare it to. Drinkability was high, and it was going down very easily."

"330ml bottle.Footed pilsner glass.Enjoyed on mar´12.Pours blond in color,cristal clear appearance.Pure white lasting crown. Herbal, slightly sulphury,aroma.Balanced malts & German hops in mouth, subtle lemon touch.Very light body,medium carbonation.Lingers with no conflicting notes. Painfully overall results quite flat. Suggested in sunny days as a session beer."

"O: This is so easy to drink in high numbers. I really like this modest beer-style and this was a nice example of the style."
""
"Just the way to kick off a tasting that was only moments away. A light, refreshing beer from Cologne that won't fill you up."
"A highly gulpable brew with some character, just like a Kölsch is supposed to be. The cellar notes makes a bit too heavy at times, though."

"One of the top 2 Kolsch's if not #1 (along with Gaffel). Crisp, clean taste with a bit of a thin mouthfeel. VERY refreshing in summer knocking them back in the little .2 glasses. Not much smell, but makes a nice ""blumen"" for a Kolsch. It seems you can drink this one endlessly."
"O- Some interesting fruity and vinous notes in a pleasantly refreshing and easily drinkable beer, that feels very much like a lager"
"Mouthfeel is relatively smooth with a nice crispness to the finish. Overall a very refreshing and drinkable beer, especially when the weather is warm."
"I know that this is supposed to be light even among Cologne Kolsch, but it still has both the fruit and the spice. Definitely more going on than your average lager. This would kill on a summer day."
"It is an interesting beer, at least it isn't monotonous. Don't be araid of this style, it isn't that bad."
"had this in a restaurant in koln. Pours like all kolsch beers, golden yellow with white head. Smell is light hoppy with malts and grass.taste malts and a bit more sweet than the average kolsch. Very drinkable,light mouthfeel,there is just not too much more to say about this beer,but need to fill 250 characters..."
"Pours a light yellow with a fizzy but quick dissipating head. Aroma is slight but made up mostly of wheat and malt. Taste is crisp and slightly sweeter than most Kölsch I'm familiar with. The wheaty flavors follow through into the back end leaving a sweet and bready aftertaste. This is a middle of the road Kölsch."
"Drinkability: Quite drinkable, refreshing; not boring but not exciting either."
"It's not bad really. No turkey. But it could certainly do with some stuffing."
"A little sweet. Light bitter barley bite. Slightly funky nose. Very mild, quenching, and great for sipping."
"D-great representation of the style. Very enjoyable and highly drinkable. I would drink this beer again."
"Enjoyed a bottle brought back from Koln. The label is marked 27.10.10. As expected, this was a tasty and crisp little ale. The aroma has an interested toasted popcorn and grain character with a tiny hint of citrus. The flavor expands on the dry grainy toast with biting orange peel that rolls through a dry finish. Along the way there are also hints of sweet apple (maybe Pink Lady) and fresh raspberries and blueberries. The fruit isn't quite as big as Reissdorf, but it's still all very well balanced. Check out this kolsch classic when you get a chance."
"D: Gracious me, but it goes goes down like a dream. Drinkable, swiggable, enjoyable. Good with a meal."
"Fresh, with some citruslike smells gives the beer a soft and smooth drinkability."
"D- great kolsch, its the complex accent flavours that when me over, way better at the brewery then from a bottle"
"Notes: Taste like an above average German pilsner with a good amount of golden fruit. Refreshing and easy to drink."
"And, as usual, a great drinkability."
"What a great discovery, I would pair this head to head with young chardonnay in a wine vs beer, and pair it with lighter food fair, jumbo prawns with a light citrus sac and a peppery kick of arugula would match with beautifully. I really enjoyed my Kolsch, and look foward to more next week and ironically enough the top rated on this website are all American breweries.."
"Head was present, and lasted into a lace down the glass. Slight bitter and aroma of hops - but not pungent. Sweetish. Light and refreshing. The kolsch size, while frustrating, is appropriate. I would not see myself drinking two pints in a row of this, but three of the small glasses spread over time is just about right."
"Prosit and Viva Colonia. MK"
"This Kolsch in my opinion can only be experienced on tap. The bottled versions tend to be over hopped and slightly off in flavor versus the tap version. Obviously enjoying a Fruh Kolsch in the shadow of Kolner Dome is very unique. The beer is light and crisp with a very light and almost airy appearance when presented in the kolsch glass. If you are looking for a heafty dense beer go somewhere else. It is one of my personal favorites, especially on a hot summer day."
"Mouth feel is coarse at first, but leaves the palate wet and cleansed."
"50 cl bottle. Pours a a golden yellow color, quickly disappearing frothy white head, decent lacing. Aroma is pale malts, grain, straw, earthy and a touch of fruity hops. Flavor is crisp, sweet malts, straw, a little bit of bread, and a fair amount of hops. Light in body, lively and carbonated, very crisp and refreshing. Very good beer, true to the style."
"D: This is a good beer, easy to drink and refreshing. But it's not outstanding and it's not very exciting. Probably one for those warm summer nights."
"D- Very refreshing brew that goes down easy with a crisp finish."
"D: Good drinkability because of its crisp and light nature as well as hints of sweetness."
"M&D: not comparable with the natural draught version at all, which is much more pronounced in both fruity and malty compartments; this bottle has shown some bad impacts from (maybe) pasteurisation, albeit not to the point of total displeasure. The mouthfeel is overly sharp and fizzy, the body is light alright, but the finishing touch comes somewhat acidic and metallic... the overall performance really is a world apart from its-good-self on draught, hence a below-average drinkability."
"Not a whole lot going on, but overall a decent brew, and a welcome change from the standard German pils and lager. Better on-tap."
"D - A bit on the sweet side, but not overwhelming. A nice, enjoyable triumvirate of flavors worth visiting again."
"More or less like a good Helles, but with much more carbonation and hoppiness and saltier as well."
"Very, very drinkable session beer. Not my favorite koelsch, but close to it."
"D- Its a mediocre kolsch, nice malts character but its letdown by a thin body."
"Solid, enjoyable, but maybe not a true representation of the style?"
"Drinkability: good beer in the style Kolschbier"
"Taste is light malty with a clean German yeast profile, some sulfuric notes. Also some bitterness and a slight hoppiness. To me this is nothing too special, it is like an average German pils."
"Purchased in a 500ml bottle at the Bull and Castle in Dublin. Poured a golden smooth color with light 2-finger white head. Not too much smell. Smooth with some carbonation and light hoppiness-nothing remarkable though. Tasted better and cleaner as it approached room temperature a bit. I would like to try another Kölsch style beer before coming back to this one."
"The definition of what a Kolsch should be. While in Munich I wanted to try the Fruh but was prevented my a looong night at a Turkish bar. Now I have one via express mail. Great light color and smell of a kolsch. Crisp and Clean taste. Great mouthfeel and drinkability. A kolsch of the hightest order the sort only found in Bavaria."
"Poured out a bright clear golden color with a bone white head. The nose had some sweetness to it, and fresh grain that you get from the style. The taste echoes the nose, lots of fresh grain, an underlying sweetness, and just a slightly bitter finish. Very well balanced. Has a crisp dry mouthfeel and is made for sessioning."
"This is an ideal drink for hot weather, light in colour,taste and body. In other words a refreshing beer without to much character, typical of all Kolsch Beers. Fruh is better than most though, for flavour."
"Overall - A pretty good Kolsch.... very drinkable. Definitely worth a try..."
"D - Very drinkable indeed."
"If you get to Cologne, I recommend trying this beer. If you're not in the true Koln atmosphere, though, the Kolsch is actually a pretty weak beer style and possibly not worth the effort to seek out."
"Pours a clear straw color under a huge three finger snow white head with great body, retention and stickiness, leaving good healthy lace strings. Very nice pour. The nose features crisp bready malt with a tinge of spicey hop. The mouth is very light and very prickly. The taste is mild and sweet in the opening, perhaps a bit watery with a touch of lemon and a splash of corn syrup. The hops that kick in later are extremely dry, almost parched, with a high intensity but low quantity bitterness that lasts and lasts. This is a nice thirst quencher that invites another round."
"This Kölsch poured a clear, golden color with creamy, white foam that settled. The smell was a very, very light malt aroma. The taste was lightly malty backed by light hop bitterness. Some bready malt notes as well as some floral hop flavors in the finish. The mouthfeel was clean and crisp with light body and good carbonation. The lightly hoppy flavor lingered a bit in the finish. This was a good, easy-drinking, and thirst quenching beer."
"As for the restaurant itself, the atmosphere (and price) is a bit above-scale, the food is great, and the service impeccable."
"How does the beer taste? Well, it's simple, sweet and clean. Like any other Koelsch, it has broad appeal. That also means that there isn't really anything too special about it. It's just a well-put-together beer. Enjoy with friends and food and life will be good."
"Final Thought: Better on tap in Köln, wish I had reviewed it then... but still it is a first-rate Kölsch."
"BB 20-10-05. Nice head and beautifull light golden and cristal clear beercolor. Nose is very malty, litle hoppy and quiet estery and overal very fresh and flowery.Taste is good and nice balance between palemalts, yeastester and hopbitterness. Litle salty and thatfor quiet dry too. Good brew that runs exceptionally easy down."
"My favorite Kolsch of the trip."
"This beer poured a nice light golden amber with a simply small white head. The smells was of biscuity malts and breadlike aroma with a slight hop spice. The taste was very refreshing, perfectly balanced with the nice crisp malts dominating the flavor. A slight fruit and hop bitterness is barely noticeable but compliments the style perfectly. This beer had a nice light body and went down easy.. (except for the one my travel mate actually knocked down onto the floor). Overall a must try Kolsch for all fans out there.."
"A pale yellow in color, but it does not lack in taste. The Fruh brewery produces this beer with a creamy malt body that finishes with a crisp hoppiness. There is also a faint taste of fresh berries. I don't have access to many authentic german Kolsch's in my area, so i jumped at the chance to sample this one. I was quite happy with my find."
"Still, not my cup of tea...or pint of beer, should I say."
"An excellent kölsch beer for sure. Thanks to Eva for bringing this back from Germany for me. This is a super pale golden colour with a fizzy white head. Just like a true kölsch should be. The smell was simple, and consisted of berries, fruity hops, and light bready malts. The taste was immensely satisfying with hops and malts having some great interplay. The mouthfeel is light and thirst quenching and the drinkability is exceptional!"
"Thanks to my pal Dave for bringing it over to the States for me!"
"Served in a traditional tall thin kölsch glass. Color is typical of kölsch--light, completely transparent, and topped by a fluffly white cloud of a head. Taste is scent is atypical however. Its slightly sweet, almost in a sugar like way. Theres a touch of tartness but its extremely subtle. Like all kölsch beers its a clean finish and light in the stomach. One of my favored kölsch beers and from what I have noticed one of the more popular kölsch beers."
"Thanks to Jan's dad for this treat."
"I have nothing to compare this to since it was my first Kolsch experience. But it had a medium yellowish color slightly darker than Budweiser and was cyrstal clear even though it was being served from a a wooden keg using gravity. The head was light, frothy, and bone white in color. Clean, crisp tasting malt with a slight fruitiness. Finishes with a mild hop twang and bitterness like a mild pilsner. Very refreshing - I could have sat and had about 30 of these - they were served in .2 liter test tube like glasses that was replaced without question whenever you were near the bottom of the glass."
