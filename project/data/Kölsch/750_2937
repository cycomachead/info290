I stuck 'em in a snowbank while we got a fire going, and MAN, was that some good beer.  I recommend that approach, but it's good any time.","Oakenshield53","Jul 29, 2014"

Flavor is light sweet malt, wheat, clove, light lemon citrus; finishes with sweet wheat and light close, a hint of hop bitterness. Light bodied. A nice, refreshing kolsch style ale with the approprate light malt and spicing. Perhaps a bit sweeter and clove spicy than traditional, but still enjoyable and pleasant.","LiquidAmber","Aug 16, 2013"

3.45,-6.8,3,3,3.5,2.5,4.5,"Poured a 12oz. into my Horny Goat pint glass. Vibrant yellowish-orange hue with a weak head that dissipated quick not leaving a whole lot of lacing. Smells fresh and lemony, not a very powerful scent but still nice. Smooth and fresh tasting with very little aftertaste. Very tiny amount of hoppy bite on the front with a slightly fruity back.

It had a bit of a straw-like quality to the color. Rather pale, but with a slight orange glow. It was a sweet taste, a little more than expected. Faint taste of grapes, maybe? Good mouthfeel, maybe a bit high on the carbonation, but satisfying to keep in there and swish about. Very dry finish. Good beer, but not so much so that I won't look to sample a different tap beer the next time in that place.","hylton44","Aug 08, 2006"

Im having problems with this brewers beers tasting like stryofoam right off the bat. Im getting some notes of wheat, hops, and sourness. The finish continues with rubbery esters and then morphs into a mellow lemon wheat. I think that its just me. Im trying to rate this in fairness, beyond the stryofoam. I review beers that might be infected, because if that's what the brewer puts out there, then that's what I'm getting. And especially with this brewery, infection has been a rampant problem. I've had three bottles of this particular style and they've all been the same.","CharlesDarwin","Jul 06, 2006"
3.68,-0.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Popured a slighly hazy golden color with moderate white puffy head. Smell is minimal with a slight fruitiness present.

3.58,-3.2,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Definately a simple but tasteful beer here. Great for summer. Pours a nice gold with white head. Smells sweet and light. Tastes of slightly caramel malts, not much bitterness, but a little bit of citrus. Quite pleasant. At first I wished it were a touch more crisp, but I'd say carbonation is on for the style. Comparable to just about anyone's kolsch or "summer ale." Cheers.","tempest","Jan 25, 2006"

3.85,4.1,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Another "better on tap beer than in the bottle." Pours a light hazy golden straw with a puffy cloud white head. Smells of apple tart malt, complemented by mellow hop overtones. Taste is juicy, slightly tart apple fruitiness, but light--not verly sweet or fruity. Hops come in for balance and add a nice floral bitterness. Surprisingly not too light bodied, with refreshing carbonation and a nice spring/summer ale.","alexgash","Beers"
3.45,-6.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"On-Tap: Translucent goldish yellow color with a strong puffy foamed white head that stays present from the pour off the tap, lacing in lots of spots and some strings. Smell is a bit sweet and fresh of light pine and citrus and a touch of a mineral/vitamin-like note. Taste has the same qualities with a short but sustained little sweetness thats a bit citrusy, light pineyness and floral notes and a crisp light finish with a touch of the mineral/vitamin-like tinge coming through in some of the lingering. Feel is light bodied feel and has a little grab, but nothing to holding or strong. Good drinkablity and pleasurable enough from the tap but not really worth another.","tavernjef","0"
3.37,-8.9,3,3.5,3,3.5,4,"This one pours out a crisp, clear golden color. The white head on top is small and quick to exit.

3.63,-1.9,3.5,3,4,3,4,"Aroma is initially a light sweet malt that quickly turns to a more sour quality, leveling off with a hop floweriness mixed with the sourness. Darker golden color and clear. Smallish head but decent stamina. Light in overall flavor. Mix has similar qualites of the aroma, that being a base of malt surrounded by the slight sourness and a shot of bitterness from the hops. Probably a little too sour. For an ale I find it lacks enough combination of smoothness and creaminess this style often entails, containing only some smoothness. Overall an average beer. I think a little too sour and bitter for style, and that prevents it from being a nice summer ale too.","garymuchow","Apr 12, 2003"

Way off, especially for a Kolsch.  IPA or PA might get away with it by saying it has an extreme pine odor, but not this style.  Drinking this beer is like drinking diluted Pine Sol.
