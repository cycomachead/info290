"Aroma is pale malts and slightly perfumed.  The flavor is fruit, pale malts and a slightly bitter finish."

"O:  A nice and light beer with some good flavors and complexity.  the grapeyness is a bit of a surprise but it fits the style and it kind of tastes like fruity pebbles."

"Overall: Just a slight skunky note about this that keeps it from being fantastic. Very clean and refreshing though."

"O: Awesome standard for this style. The best kolsch I’ve ever had. Dry and smooth, nice vinous scents and doughy taste. Drank at Turkey Creek June 28, 2014 on my daughter’s second birthday."
""
"Served too warm. Would like to taste fresh and cold."
"04/24/13 On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. So nice I did it twice. Very pleasant. All things going for this one. Inviting is the word that comes to mind. I'm partial to klosch brews & this one hit the spot. If its warm & sunny, lay down your money for Sunner Klosch."
"O: yummy and very drinkable but nothing overly remarkable; a good kolsch, not necessarily great, mainly because it feels so soft/flat"

"Overall, this is a very nice kolsch and a great lawnmower beer. If this were readily available and cheap I would drink it constantly."
""

"0: I disagree that this is a very good beer. If you have never experienced the magic of Kolsch this is definitely a must try. If you know Kolsch it's pretty lame as Kolsch is fragile and best drunk young before even minor amts of oxidation turn it into just another quickly forgotten thirst quencher."

"Nice light refreshing beer. Ideally suited for a hot. Sweltering summer day."
""
"This is a light yellow beer with a white head and medium carbonation. Aroma is sweet grain and noble hops (grassy, herbal). Flavors are sweet grain upfront and some noble hop flavors. I also get some subtle apple or pear-like fruitiness from the yeast. Mouthfeel is crisp with a dry finish.."

"Poured into a kolsch stange from a small keg. Pours light straw amber with a healthy two finger white head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of biscuit malt with slight wheat and citrus. Flavor is also dominated by biscuit malt, with faint apple juice, lightly tart. Finishes crackery with light grassy hops. Light to medium bodied. An unusual opportunity to try a relatively fresh kegged kolsch. The style is not intensely flavored so this fresh version was not noticeably an improvement on the bottled versions, but it was interesting to be able to drink it fresh from the tap. I nice, classic kolsch that was a pleasure to drink."

"A light yellow in color with a thin white head. Aromas of fresh grain and a hint of sulfur. Taste begins with a clean zesty, spicy hop flavor, followed by a cracker malt middle, and clean dry finish. Mouthfeel is good. Overall a good Kolsch that I would get again."

"Overall: One of the originals and very enjoyable. More people should have an opportunity to try this beer out."

"A pretty tasty, and enjoyable version of the style, and with a certain street cred, given its origins, but not the best Kölsch I've ever had - those new world brewers can just be a bitch to the establishment, eh?"
""
""
"500 ml bottle, mine says 5.3% ABV. Best before end 1 14 notched on back label. Served in a stange glass, the beer pours a clear pale gold color with an inch and a half white head that stays around for a very long time. There's a decent amount of lacing. Bubbles continually flow from the bottom of the glass to the top, even long after the initial pour. The brew smells like hay, bready malt, and some light grassy hops. Taste is mostly like the aroma, but there's also a bit of fruitiness and green apple flavor noticeable. Mouthfeel/body is light, it's refreshing and easy enough to drink. It's also well carbonated. Not a bad brew at all, $2.99 a bottle. At that price I'd pick this up again."

"O: A nice Kölsch, true to the style. The light sour twist was quite nice."
"Drinkability: Light, tasty, and refreshing. This is good stuff."

"It's not bad but not memorable or distinct. In fairness, I have no idea how old it is. It didn't look like a big mover at the store. It's not a beer I'd buy again because it doesn't seem to have much of an identity - so there's no real reason to. If it was what was available for a session with friends, fine. No problem. You'd forget the name by the next day."
""
""
""
"An enjoyable Kolsch that hits all of the style requirements. I drank this right after a Fruh Kolsch and preferred Fruh for its more refined and brighter flavors along with the lower ABV. That said, Sunner is plenty enjoyable on a spring day and I would gladly drink it again."
"All around delicious, and satisfying representation of the Kolsch style. I'd drink er again!"
""
"O - An excellent example of the style, this light beer perfectly marries ale and lager characteristics with notes of fruit while remaining crisp, clean, and exceptionally drinkable."

"This is a great kölsch, without a doubt. When I was in Cologne years ago I don't think I had this one, but then again, I don't think I've ever had a kölsch in this caliber! And again, this isn't an imperial IPA or saison or anything explosive, but I believe weeks after drinking extreme beers non-stop, my palate is thanking me very much for something this flavorful yet extremely easy and mellow to drink. This is definitely a beer to pair with food, but honestly, after a long day of work or a warm day, this does the trick for being as flavorful as most good quality pilsners, yet lighter in character. Looking for a top quality kölsch when rating to style? This is the one."

"Here's a perfect outdoor drink on a warm day to watch the world go by."

"O: Pretty good, nice and refreshing on a warm day. It is well balanced and true to it's style."
"500 ml bottle into pint glass, 5/2012 date notched on the back. Pours slightly hazy golden straw color with a nice 1-2 finger dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big lemon, pear, apple, cracker, floral, grass, bread, and light earthy hop spiciness. Damn nice aromas with good balance, strength, and complexity. Taste of lemon, apple, pear, cracker, white bread, floral, grass, light pepper, and light hop earthiness. Lingering notes of light fruits, bread, floral, grass, light pepper, and earthiness on the finish for a bit. Very nice balance of bready malt and fruity esters; with zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Very clean tasting. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and fairly crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Kolsch style. Very nice balance of flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable and easy drinking offering as expected."

"Poured into a stange glass. Pours clear golden with a thick white head that dissipates fairly quickly, leaving splotchy lacing on the side of the glass. There are plentiful tiny bubbles rising in the beer. The aroma is of slightly sweet and bready malt with some faint fruity notes that are almost cider like. The aromas are not strong, but smell pretty clean. The tastes are mild and follow the nose. There's light breadiness with some faint sweetness from the malt. There are some herbal notes from the hops and that faint fruitiness is just present. The body is light with strong carbontion. The finish is crisp and dry and there is just a slight aftertaste. This beer is very drinkable and refreshing. This is an excellent beer."

"Had this beer a while back and enjoyed very much. Has a nice golden yellow color when poured with a light to medium body head that disepates relatively quickly (less than a minute). Has a typical lager/dry ale aroma but is slightly more pronounced in that regard. Has a nice clean taste that entails slight fruity notes, moderate malt and hop taste with slight but well balanced dry lingering bitterness which lends to its crisp overall character. Make sure to have it ice cold and in a tall glass. A good beer for persons desiring moderation in aroma, sweetness and feel. I enjoyed it, and would recommend it."

"I'm begining to enjoy this style again after far too many average brews of tastelessness."

"Pours a clear light yellow with a foamy white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and some fruity aromas. Taste is much the same with a mild yeast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is drinkable and refreshing."

"Enjoyable beer, refreshing and tasty. Slightly sweet but balanced. Good traditional kolsch."
""

""

"O: I suppose it's refreshing in that it's a drinkable liquid which doesn't taste of tar water but otherwise it's nothing. I'm sure that there are people who'd enjoy it a lot, but as a Brit who's fed up with the multiplicity of soulless European lagers on tap I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, ever."
"Brings back great memories of sipping suds at the Imbuss in Germany. Nice light traditional German Kolsch... with just a fine bit more bitter flavor than a usual German Pils. Very little after taste. I might purchase again, but with so many to choose probably not."
"O - Fairly simple in its design, it's basically a good example of a Kolsch. Nice drinkable lager with some crisp, clean flavours that leave the drinker feeling refreshed."
" pleasant aroma and nice appearance, (which would have been better drinking from a glass raither than straight from a bottle - what was i thinking!) the taste was magnificent! if you like kolsch's which has become my one of my new fave styles nexter to pale ales, doulble ipas and porters - TRY THIS! i like this beer and it deserves a higher rating and im gonna help it achieve one..."
""

""

"Atmosphere is pretty good. Light hue, slight head, and sporadic lacing. Nose is fuller than the appearance suggests, with a pungent grainy and citrus tone. Flavor follows suit, with a light and crisp combination of sourdough bread and lemon citrus with a biting pungent finish. Overall, this is a good quaff."
""
"O: In my admittedly limited tastings of Kolsch, this has come closest to the ""true style"". A paragon of its breed, Sunner Kolsch is an awesome beer for late spring or early fall. Prost!"
""
"Comes perilously close to being a lawn mower beer. Tastes like the smell except for the low presence of hops. The swallow has a creamy flavor and body."
""
""
"great price on this baby, under 4 bucks for a large bottle. pours a very very light looking clear sunshine yellow colow with very bright carbonation and a 3 inch white head that clings to the sides of my pilsner glass. smells like light munich malts and bittereing hops in excellent balance. flavor has the same profile but its just so light. very refreshing and drinkable, but terribly unexciting. feel is nice though, with good bubbles and a very light body. its a good example of the style in its traditional sense, but i tend to prefer some of the bigger american versions with a more complex malt palate. overall though a well made brew that serves its purpose."
"Doesn't show for much to start, but strong baseline of sweetness, assertive hop bitterness and seriously lean body. What a kolsch should be, in other words. As always, wonder what it's like on tap, or even fresher (3/12 exp date here.)"
"Overall a simple refresher, but I am waiting for that real bread and baking character, but it's just not coming. I could have this again but I'd grab a different Kolsch if I had a choice. uh oh what a sec, bottle best before March 2012... hmmm I would most definitely try this again."
"Pours out a hazy golden color. The head is about 1 finger of white foam with moderate retention. No lacing. Lots of fruit and grains in the nose. Getting some apricot, orange, white grape, apple and wheat. Also picking up some pleasant floral hop notes in there. Again very fruity. Tons of apple and apricot and the wheat gives in a nice smooth finish. Carbonation is very refreshing. First time having this one. Never been a fan of Kolsch style beer but damn this stuff is tasty. Not bad at all. Very thirst quenching."
"Drinkability : an avergae beer in the German style Kolsh."
"O: great beer for any time of year. Highly quaffable."
"O - Very impressive, could drink a good few of these"
"Great aroma on this one. Fuller body at first but lightens up and finishes dry at the end. Nice simple sweetness with mild but green hop flavors. I could drink this all night."

"O – This is only the second time I’ve had a Kolsch so I’m by no means a well-rounded critique. After reading the label, I now understand the Kolsch to Germany is the Champagne to France and is something to be revered and protected. It’s an interesting hybrid of ale fermentation and lagering techniques. I can really respect the subtleties of this beer. It could easily get dismissed for mediocrity or ‘nothing greatl’, but I suspect the execution of such a well-balanced yet subtle and light beer could be of greater difficulty than brewing something more robust. Drinkability is a massive factor with this beer. This would be brilliant and very session-able on a hot ‘Sunners’ day. (Excuse the pun)"
"O: Very refreshing and easy to drink - an excellent example of a Kolsch. Would be great on a hot summer day - would gladly have this one again (and possibly many of them in an afternoon in the sun)."
"O: This beer is easy to drink and has some refreshing properties. I would have no problem drinking a few of these on a hot summer day."
""
"Overall a tasty and easy drinking kolsch."
"O- Overall, its nice, i dont mind it, and is as good as, if not better than the few other kolsch's i have tried."
""
""
"Dr: Very drinkable, but not the most drinkable kolsch I've had. It's a pleasant beer brewed to tradition. What you expect is exactly what you get, and there's certainly nothing wrong with that. I might try it on draught, but honestly there are better, more innovative kolsches out there."
""
"The beer had a light feel to it and had a nice dry finish to it. The beer was well carbonated and extremely easy to drink. Overall, this is a very good beer and the low ABV really added to the enjoyment. This is a very good example of the style and I will try to keep this one in my beer fridge more often."
"This beer pours a standard yellow with a nice cap of white foam which left adequate lacing down the glass. The aroma is a mixture bread malt and some apricot fruitiness from the yeast. On the palate it comes alive with crisp clean flavors. The malt is a subtle blend as it moves swiftly into the dry center and finishes with a tangy snap of hops. This beer is well balanced and a beautiful example of the style, from the source."

"O: While this beer isn't terrible, it definitely does have its fair share of flaws."
"O – A good tasting & quenching summer beer, something I would pick up again for a large group."
"O: This is okay but a little too advil-like."
"A kolsch direct from the source = awesome. Except there's sediment all through the bottle and a good chance this baby's skunked, oh well. The pour went smoothly, thick cloudy head with nice lacing down the pint glass to reveal an brilliantly clear, golden color. Not much in the nose, maybe a bit of malty sweetness. Taste shows no signs of being oxidized or any off-flavors, just straightforward crisp, malty, smooth. I feel like a kolsch is drank more for the mouthfeel than the flavor - smooth, dry, refreshing. Sunner invented this style of beer, and delivers on this aspect."
"Tastes great, this one, and urges more consuming. Hail, hail, Sunner Kolsch. Not the greatest Kolsch, but one of the best."
"Draught @ Busch Gardens: This one pours a clear, straw yellow color. There was a small white head that leaves some lacing. There is a nice nose to this one. Floral and grassy notes. Some malts and maybe a touch of fruit. The taste is also good. Very smooth. Earthy, malts and a touch dry. Nice."
"A fantastic kölsch to be sure. Not as much fruit character as some, but enough to be quite delcious. I love it, and it's fantastic in the summer."
"O - A basic but perfectly sessionable lager. One dimensional but just the thing for a hot summer evening."
"500 mL skinny German bottle with no freshness date; 5.3%. Pours a clear bright gold, highly-carbonated, with a thick finger of white head that laces well and retains a nice cap of fine lather. Smells sweet, grainy, metallic, almost corn-like - like an American lager at first blush. Becomes more malty and hoppy as it warms, with something powdery/medinical that fades with time. Lemons and pale malt on the palate, lightly sweet, with a bit of spicy/floral hops that contribute a mild bitterness; another dimension is doughy/biscuity with grass and fresh hay. Overall very smooth and soft. The body is light/medium, with fine, drying carbonation and a medium finish. A great example of the style that arrived here in good shape. Delicious, well-brewed, and worth a try if you are just getting to know the style."
"Poured a 2"" white head which dissipated completely. Very light clear straw yellow color. Smells of malt and grain. Taste and mouthfeel have just a slight advantage over standard BMC. Not much of a finish to it. Although I'd prefer this to standard BMCs, and I was grateful it wasn't skunked, it just didn't excite me."
"This light to moderate bodied brew is a perfect example of the style. Easy to drink, balanced, and very crisp all at the same time. Nice to see this one available in my market. I'll be seeking it out again in the near future."
"A highly drinakble hybrid beer with exquisite balance of cracker malts, floral-spicy hops, and a mild estery reinforcement of apple and pear- all without the sulfur character that usually plagues German lagers. Ideal for hot summer afternoons."
"Damn fine summer drinking and confirmation that in my zeal for the extreme I've completely missed some of the great beers of the world."
"O – A good tasting & quenching summer beer, something I would pick up again for a large group, worth a try but I personally won’t seek it out. 3.5"
"D-Highly drinkable and balanced, but not a lot to this one. I prefer other Kolsch's I've had."
"Narrative: “Oh great, another argument about this? I feel like this happens way too often.” The chief cheese sommelier for Kraft American singles found himself rolling his sleeves up far too often. “Oh you think you are just gonna SIT IN SEAT 19b? I’m sorry Mr. Fancy Cheese maker!” He sighed, knowing the extent of the marketing campaign, the extent of foodies’ irrational hatred, and the monicre that the merger with Nestle had imparted. “Listen, I am not trying to be a fancy anything, I just want to check my bags and” he could see their eyes all leveled at him, screeching childhood obesity epithets, their spiteful glances, the forthcoming envelopes full of frightening white powder. “OK OK ENOUGH! I am a cheese. Maker. That is it, I don’t aspire to be the best, I am mediocre and I recognize that, who among you can admit their mediocrity?” The eyes of the cabin all leveled, checking themselves, except one errant Korean man who proudly declared “why can you has to making cheese? I AM 19B!” The hoi polloi nodded in approval of this reproach."
"more dynamic than i'd expect of a kolsch, but thoroughly enoyable on a warm spring day!"
"O: style wise its not a favorite, i think i would rather have a pilsner."
"Great flavor and is light on the palette. While not my favorite style this is good for what it's meant to be, a sessionable beer and originally a competitor for light lagers."
"Drinkability - this goes down pretty easily, I coul deasily drink 4-5 of thse in one sitting. A well done beverage that would go really well on a hot summers day"
"The same can be said of the taste. It was very refreshing, very light, had a barley taste, a bit of hops and only a bit fruity at the end. This was a very light and balanced beer."
"D: I've had better versions w/ lower abv."
"D - quite drinkable, refreshing"
"Pick it up, especially if you enjoy kolschs."
"Notwithstanding the texture or lack thereof, it does add to one's ability to just tip this crisp, refreshing drop right down. Great stuff."
"Not a great beer, but a light, clean and pretty drinkable one. I guess it's more the style itself that I have a problem with, but this does seem to be a below par example, even stylistically."
"Very smooth beer for sure, but nothing that makes it stand out. I like the structure, and the flip flop you get as it works its way thru your palate from dry-bitter-sweet...back and forth. A quencher for sure, but this one would be dominated by food. Decent, but not outstanding."
"D - I haven't had too many Kolsch's but I like this brew."
"I really enjoy this. Very simple, but this is pretty much what a Kolsch should be. If you are looking for a lighter beer with some more flavor, this is it. Something I would recommend."
"Pours a light yellow color with quickly diminishing head. Aroma is sweet with distinct grass and wheat flavors. Taste is surprisingly sweet on the front end with almost a sour apple flavor. Finishing is bitter hops with very strong wheat and cereal notes."
"Really an average Kölsch overall. Give me Mühlen or Reissdorf any day over this stuff."
"Pours a hazy gold color with a tall white head that recedes to a foam on top of the beer. Smells of grain with a crisp apple sweetness. Taste is very crisp and fresh and its a very full taste. Most predominantly there is a light sweet malt taste with a bit of grassiness and hops in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium with average carbonation. Drinkability is great, its an easy-drinking beer with a reasonable ABV. This would be a great summer evening beer to share with a couple pals."
"D - quite drinkable, refreshing"
"Anyone got any input here? Please reply to "
"This is one drinkable beer due to the slightly dry finish, reminiscent of a Czech or German Pilsener. ""I can't believe it's not lager!"""
"M/D: The carbonation really makes this easy to drink. Nothing really complex tasting, but worth trying out if you're in a easy drinking kind of mood."
"It was a good beer but not something I would run out and always get but mostly because personally I enjoy more bold flavors."
"D: all around great Kölsch. It tastes like the real deal, true to form. Would be great to have a sixer of these on a hot summer day."
"D: This is a very nice Kölsch that left me wanting more. The light body makes it very drinkable."
"An average Kolsch. Smell is greater than the taste. It would make a good session beer. I must note that when I exhale after drinking, I can taste corn."
"Pours a clear, straw color. 3/4 inch head of a white color. Good retention and slight lacing. Smells of grain, pale malt, hint of wheat, hint of sweet malt, and a hint of hops. Fits the style of a Kolsch. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of strong grain, pale malt, slight sweet malt, slight hops, and a hint of metallic. Overall, decent Kolsch, with no outstanding features."
"Pours to a thin white had with minimal lacing and gold color with some floaties. Aroma is slightly fruity with sweet grainy malt and spicy hops dominating. Flavor is a complex blend of pale malt, spicy hops and other interesting hints of wood-aging,fruits (grapes?), and spices. Finishes dry and crisp much like a white wine. I don't know how they do that, it must be the yeast. Mouthfeel is spot-on for the style and overall, a great tasting beer that is different enough to make it a nice departure from German and Czech lagers. Think of Kölsch as an ale that has strong-lager-like tendencies."
"Simple but very good. Great Summer bottle."
"Another import found on tap at the Black Forrest Inn in Minneapolis, this one shows a pale but clear gold with a fair white head and minimal lacing. The aroma hints at mild wheat and vague citrus. A bit lame perhaps. It's very crisp feeling and delivers on the flavor much the same as the aroma, generally closer to cereal than any hop character. It's light bodied, well carbonated and highly drinkable, but it is not very memorable for the flavor. Needs a little more on the malt & citrus side to make the grade, but not a bad thirst quencher on a hot afternoon."
"Tap at Gourmet Haus Staudt, served in a 0.2L kolsch glass. Golden amber with brilliant clarity and a sticky white head. Mild but clean pale malt aroma, slight stone fruit, corn and buttered white bread. Palate is rather mild as well, malty with a trace of diacetyl that prevents this from being as crisp as some of the better Kolsch out there. It has a trace of hops in the finish, but it's not as bitter or firm as I'd like. Pretty enjoyable, but not stellar."
"Drinkability: Kölsch is a pretty drinkable style overall, and this beer is no exception. I wish it had a little less pronounced grain character, though."
"Minerals and bleached cracker crust hit the palate first, followed by bread dough and a delicately bitter bite from the grassy hops. Crisp, clean finish leaves behind only the slightest hint of lemon peel and soapiness. Great mouthfeel--light and bubbly without getting so carbonated that the flavor suffers. All in all, a decent-to-good, drinkable kölsch. Not something I'll make a habit of purchasing, but Sünner definitely holds up well in the scorching Austin heat."
"Overall - This is a perfect brew for a hot summer day, as it's quite drinkable and refreshing, but manages to pack more flavor in than a run-of-the-mill lawnmower beer, making it more interesting. This could also be a great gateway beer to introduce non-craft beer drinkers to something new."
"One of the better Kölsch beers I've had. The sweetness is kept in check here, and it is crisper than others. Nothing special, but still good."
"A really good Kolsch. A lot of times I feel like this is a much underappreciated style, and I love to pick up Kolsches that I've never had before. For me they are like a nice refreshing lager, but with more complexity and they just feel softer to me, likely due to the ale yeast. I can't wait to go back to Germany sometime and drink them again on hot summer days am Rhein."
"D- Certainly easily drinkable with the standard kolsch smell/flavour structure, unfortunately just not the cleanest Kolsch i have had"
"D: Easily drinkable. Good example of the style."
"Excellent for the summer heat. Very good representation of this style. A perfect gateway beer for those that want to step into the craft beer world. This style has it's place and this is a very good choice."
"D: This is a great summer beer, and one that I would love to try on tap in Germany some day!"
"This is a great summer beer, incredibly refreshing, enough of a malt backbone to keep it interesting while not getting to heavy in the body."
"For my money, local brewer Metropolitan makes a superior Kölsch that will always be fresher and tastier, unless i'm drinking this in Germany."
"Pours a ripe gold, thin head. Smell is subdued, flowers on top and bitterness beneath. Taste is similar, a light crisp and almost pilsner like consistency. Mouthfeel is exceedingly crisp and clean. Drinkability is huge."
"Taste is mostly light malt. Some bread and unripe banana. Hops are a bit weak in this one. The crispness and spice doesn't really come through. In effect it's a light malt centered beer. Doesn't have that zip at the end, not at all. It's good, just not to style, imo."
"the pour is crystal clear... yellow golden in color with a nice head that dissipates. nose of apple and straw with a mild mild pollen quality. palate is that with mild sweet of honey backed by a soft bitter finish. some apple too... along with a bit of floral hop. a nice body. crisp and refreshing. a style that seems to be disregard as a summer brew. great."
" Palate is light, refreshing, and well-balanced. Slightly sweet, bready malt up front, with a nice dose of light, citrusy hops. Finish is crisp and dry. The body is well-carbonated, but not fizzy, and light enough to match the more subtle flavor profile of the style. Definitely a drinkable, refreshing beer, but still a notch or two below Reissdorf in the hierarchy of German kolschs."
"The beer pours a clear light yellow color with a small white head. The aroma is floral hops, grapes and wheat. The flavor is dominated by wheat as well as flowery and spicy hops. You also get some green grape flavors in the aftertaste. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Opinion: This is an excellent example of the style. I drank WAY too many of these at a renaissance festival in Koln once and this totally takes me back there. It is light and refreshing and very easy to drink. So easy, you can put away enough to make you goofy without realizing it. I plan to give this beer high marks as it is a good example of the style."
"On tap at the Mellow Mushroom in Greensboro.Poured into a standard pint glass a clear lighter golden with a thinner white head atop,aromas are of toasty grain and a bit mown grass mainly.A lighter to medium feel to the beer wich is good for the style,flavors have a real toasted quality and the hops give a good crispness to the finish.It seems lighter than the ABV.,it goes down very easily, a nice warm weather brew thats delicate but flavorful."
"Golden straw color, carbonation bubbles racing through tht body, sizeable white head on top with solid retention describes how this beer looks. The nose features some sweet pale malt, but also some steeley corn sweeteness note I couldn't figure out. Fortunatley, its taste, although light, was refreshing without major off-flavors. There's a kiss of honey, a little bready malt, touches of husky malt, with sweet pale malt making the base flavor. The beer is light in the mouth, crisp, carbonation bubbles are teeny tiny, and a little sweetness lingers in an other wise dry finish. A gulpable beer overall, and a good alternative to all the German lagers."
"D: although it is a decent representative of one of my favorite styles, Sünner is a tad under-hopped and seems a bit monotone compared to Gäffel and Reissdorf. Nonetheless, Sünner delivers a crisp and refreshing brew that still has much more flavor than other brands competing in this market."
"Pours golden with a slight haze and a light white head that quickly dissolves. Aroma is light pilsner malt and musty. The flavor is light malt with some noble hop flavor. Its light modied and has a nice prickly carbonation. I don't have much experience with Kolsch's but I thought overall this was drinkable but nothing exciting which to my understanding is kind of what the style is about anyways."
"The Body was light and refreshing. The carbonation was active yet smooth. Pretty nice. Overall a very drinkable brew that I wish I saw on tap more frequently!"
"Taste is more ""lager""-like than many American versions with not quite as many yeast esters coming out. Light grainy malts are the dominant flavor. There is a mild cardboard flavor in here that I usually only get out of a bottle, but that is a very minor complaint. There is some nice hop bitterness that adds some snappy crispness to the beer. Drinkability is very good with this beer, carbonation is just right and has an excellent creamy texture. I have not had many German-made kolsches before, but this one is a bit milder compared to most of the American versions. Very nice kolsch, I could drink a few of these."
"Beer. Straight forward good beer. Nothing special, just good beer. Poured with a medium off white head and a tiny bit of lace. Color is a clear amber. Aroma is just plain, fresh common beer, more of a world lager than anything spicy. Flavor is similar but sweeter, although not too sweet. Soft body and good carbonation. Nice clean bittersweet finish. Session beer."
"Kolsch is not a style that travels well. At its freshest, it can be interesting. This is a weak example of the style, though."
"D - Really good example of a session beer."
"The mouth is crisp with good carbonation. It is a very easy drinker & a great beer with lighter non-spicy food. I will be on the lookout for this one in Chicago. A great example of the style!"
"The body is crisp, but still retains some smooth creaminess. I like that. Flavors of light tart citrus, some faint grassy hops, and some sharp grains. There is a bit of a metallic twang to it right off, but as I continue to drink this fades. Maybe I'm used to it? All in all, this is a good representation of the style. I'd have it again for sure. Quite refreshing."
"Drinkability is just ok. Nothing really specials to want me to have another and that metallic taste doesn't really help either."
"M - light and crisp with very high drinkability."
"This is a good Kölsch, though it isn't the best one I've had. It seems a bit harder to find than Gaffel or Reissdorf, and those are the only two I have seen here in the US. It is a decent brew, but suitable mainly for Summer or during a vacation to Köln."
"Note: The label indicates that Sünner Kölsch is 5.3% ABV. This is a bit unusual, as every other true German kölsch I've ever tried has been 4.8%."
"Sunner Kolsch is quite possibly the best example of the style that I've ever tasted. It pours the expected clear golden body beneath a two-finger thick head of white foam. The head retention is very good, and it leaves some very nice lacing about the glass. The aroma displays a sweetish, straightforward malt, a hint of yeasty fruitiness, and notes of floral hops. And the flavor follows suit, but in a fuller way. It's sweetish at first, then fruity, and finally florally hoppy with a light touch of spiciness as the bitterness rises. Somehow it comes to a balance before it leaves the mouth, and then it dries even more as the malt quickly erodes, leaving behind a gentle but solid bitterness and hints of floral, grassy, and spicy hops. Remarkably drinkable!"
"Really very drinkable though.. I like it for what it is, but I've had waaaay better examples of the style."
"Overall, this is very close to being an incredible kolsch. It's just a matter of a few little things that combine to make it less than amazing, but certainly above average. A great summer lawnmower beer with a little more flavor than your average hot day swill. A good beer that fits into the unique and underappreciated niche of the Kolsch."
"Very well balanced, tasty beer. A bit sweet at the outset, turning more sour at the end. I tend to prefer dark, malty brews, and was surprised that I liked this one so much. I found it more interesting and satisfying than some of the American versions of this style. Goes to show, go to the source!"
"Seems like a fresh bottle, which could be a problem with the import delays. Not to bad of a price - $2.50 for the 500ml. Tasty enough brew to try again."
"This beer pours a pale see thru straw colour with nice carbonation that leaves a fast vanishing one finger head with average lacing,the aromas are grape,doughy malts and some honeydew,it has a nice silky mouthfeel to it with hints of sweet lemony citrus that finishes very nicely dry and crisp,a very refreshing beer that could drink alot of on a nice hot summers day."
"The taste is similar, with a full grain character, some hay, hints of mineral, pear, peach. It settles into a soft , fruity grain finishing with a dryish, slightly spicey, crisp finish with dry hints of peach and pear."
"Drinks alright, this one seems a bit tired from its Atlantic crossing, I remember this being better in Germany. Most American versions are better than the average import due freshness, plus care & handling"
"500 mL bottle poured into a pint glass. Budweiser colored, which I suppose is typical, with a creamy white cap of head. Aroma is grainy and lightly floral with a touch of lemon tartness. Flavor is a little less substantial. Some sweet bready grains, a whisper of citrus, and a crisp mineral finish. Thin, refreshing body, perfect on a scalding California summer day."
"D -- A very good, thirst-quenching quaffer -- just as a good Kölsch should be."
"light but smooth feel, only slightly watery. trace resins in the finish, then smoothing out again. gentle to moderate carbonation can also be spritzy."
"D: I don't know why so few Kolsches are exported, this is only the 2nd Cologne made one I've had, an under the radar style, especially for the summertime."
"On-tap at Flying Saucer served in a standard pint-glass a crisp bubbly yellow with a thin diminishing head. Aroma is a decent blend of crisp hops and sweet malts. The taste is a nice subtle blend of hops and malts, a bit on the bland side, but undertoned and fitting to the style. The beer is quite light, crisp and refreshing. This is a very enjoyable version of the style."
"Good beer to drink when the conversation is more important than the beer."
"I had a 16.9 ounce bottle and poured the beer into a half liter glass. A nice pale yellow color with a little head. I could barely smell anything, I think there was a faint grass smell. I could not taste anything, the beer was almost tasteless. There was no aftertaste, and only a little hop bitterness. It was almost like drinking water, so I'd consider this as a good thirst quencher."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a nice lighter beer with enough substance to make it worth drinking for a long time."
"D: Highly drinkable as per the style and very tasty."
"D - A very well-crafted Kolsch. It holds the balance between dry and sweet flavor profiles very well. This is a great summer brew - a cooler full of these on the beach sounds pretty damn good."
"Flavour was very dry with a crisp, clean and very lightly sour character. The label says it is sweet but I found it sour as if wild yeast were involved. This is a lovely dry beer that would/should be a winner in the Australian summer. There's a depth of aromatic interest and lip-puckering goodness that would shame the disgusting dry macro lagers that proliferate here. These interesting flavours and soft/sparkly mouthfeel make it a real winner. Should be more of it."
"D - This has become one of my favorite summer beer styles. It's a very good example of what Kolsch should taste like. I recommend this highly."
"Clear pale yellow with a soapy, bright white cap. A bit of clumpy lace, decent head retention. Floral hop aroma, crackers, light lemon. Light bitterness, malt, bit of hop spice and lemon. Nice balance. Light bodied, on the crisp side. A good kolsch, light and refreshing but with some flavour."
"Overall: The mouth feel of the beer soft, clean, lightly carbonated, and almost crisp. The body of the beer is light and the finish is nil. I never have like the American version of the Kolsch, it is not delicate and rough on the palate. I am glad that the German Kolsch's are a whole lot better."
"Overall, I like this bier. It isn't the best kolsch out there, but it is a damn good one. Do yourself a favor and have this bier. Prosit!"
"Having only ever had a couple ""real"" Kolschs in my life I am a little hesitant to go hard on it, not being too sure how good (or not) these beers can be. Anyway, it is pale straw colour with a weak head and not a great deal going on nose-wise. Starts off fresh with a slight apple aroma but goes sulphury quite quickly as it warms. This may well explain why they are served in small glasses in Koln. Still, it is a refreshing beer with a little sweetness but an essentially dry finish. Tis good and drinkable but reserving judgement on calling this style ""classic""."
"drinkability - well my only slight on this is its abv at 5.4% its just a bit too high for something that's so sessionable..."
"Sooo refreshing! Especially considering its 28deg C inside at the moment!"
"Poured from a 1pt 0.9oz bottle purchased at Eagle Provisions in Brooklyn (just over $3). The beer is pale golden colored, crystal clear, with a thin wet foam. The aroma is subdued like all good Kolsches, a little musty or funky but really in a light way. The taste is slightly sweet and malty, maybe a little estery fruit flavors (not much). The definition of drinkable at 5.3% ABV with a light body."
"This the second time I have drunk this. The first time I found it a bit more fruity. I might have to revisit."
"A good example of a somewhat restricted style, and a nice, easy drinking beer."
"It is quite easy drinking, but is almost watery. I have never really been a huge fan of kolsch, and I think this has turned me off even more. Very watery, almost a lighter taste similar to heineken."
"The bottle was good until late in 08, but I think a fresh version would be sharper! This seems to be the case with a lot of german beers."
"Overall, I would drink this Sunner Kolsch any time, anywhere. Nothing overwhelmed me (good or bad), except the fact that it had a really full flavor that I haven't found in any of the other Koln kolsch's. Even my ""beer-sampling but not beer-fanatic"" wife thought that it was good (which is a huge statement!)."
"Tasting it yesterday from keg and today from botle with exp date 25-7-05 can only come to one conclusion: great brew. What you want of you order a Koelsch. Nice appearance with white head that lasts quiet ok. Very malty nose and wheat noticeable. Further good and clean yeast, and a hoppy nose though this botle version has not as much as the sampled kegbeer had. Full and clean taste also; malty, just litle sweet and nice and dry hopfinish. Mouthfeel is great, and a beer thats a perfect sessionbeer in my eyes so drinkability is more then just ok too! By the way 4.8% ABV."
"Smell? blech, all the same. still. And the taste ranges from a watery sort of pils with a bit extra wheat that doesn't really do it for me. really. nothing exciting about it."
"Sünner is golden and luminous like other Kölsch beers and offers the same gigangtic and overflowing white head. The smell is extremely floral and notes of pepper? are evident. Taste is light, delicate, and full of the same floral notes. A broad and mellow malt base is also evident. Mouthfeel is average; a tad watery for my tastes and in comparison to what I see as a great Kölsch. Drinkability is really the highlight of this beer. Its taste are all delicate and mellow and leave you with no offensive aftertaste. Id assume this would be a great summer session brew, though Ive sadly only drank this when it was rather cold out. Schade."
