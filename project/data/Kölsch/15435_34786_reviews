"OVERALL: A well-made beer for sure, but a touch too grainy in the nose for me. Luckily that quality didn’t transfer to the flavor profile, so it was more enjoyable to drink than initially expected off the aroma. Not something I’ll need to drink again anytime soon, but I was glad to finally give it a shot. If you’re a lager fan, you’ll enjoy this ale as well."

"600ml bottle at Zak’s Restaurant. Pours a light straw color. Thin white head. Definitely filtered. Lively carbonation. Aromas of light citrus with hints of caramel malt. Mouthful is light and refreshing. Tastes of a citrus and malt balance. Has a nice lime infused tingle on the swallow. A bit old school but very sessionable."

"From afar in a glass, this beer looks like any old lager. It's clear and yellow. We might drink with our eyes at first but our taste buds soon take over. Beau's Lug Tread is a perfect example of a kölsch, that unique beer from Cologne. Although the appearance isn't anything too exciting, the flavour is. It has a hoppiness that definitely tells you it's there but the bitterness is toned down a bit. The lacing is excellent and the head quickly dissipates. All in all this is an excellent beer to drink year round."

"O: A great Canadian example of the style. Light and uniquely kolsch. Best example of a kolsch, I dare not say, but a sure good representation."
""
"One warning if you are planning to buy a single bottle from the LCBO to sample…they have a nasty habit of accidently charging for the full 4 pack, so check your bill before leaving the store. The 4x600 ml pack sells for $15.85."

"I just tried my first one tonight, I have been waiting for the local LCBO to have this in stock and it was there tonight! . i'll rock this in the summer months for sure, great lighter beer with a nice ass end! What else do you need? bring on summer."
""
"Overall - A very fine Kolsch, probably y favorite and something that is extremely sessionable."
""
""
"Overall - For my first Beau's offering, this Kolsch has all the elements for the style. Quite sessionable."

"Sampled from a Beau's Willi Bechler tumblr. A pour straight down the middle of the glass raised a healthy eggshell coloured head that exhibited a nice rockiness, clear pale yellow liquid underneath. The smell is delicate maltiness with a grassy note and lightly hoppy. The taste is light bodied and crisp with a decent hopping for the light body, slightly flowery mixing with a slight biscuity malt flavour. This easy drinking ale finshes crisply with bittersweet end. A session/warm weather quencher for sure. Delicate and refreshing."

"Pours nice, mid-dark golden colour. Mild smell. Big flavour for a lager. I am see the kolsch in this brew, a sweat taste that goes dry, has a noticeable bitter note that even stays with on the tongue a while on the after taste. This is a good lager, Beau's makes some good beers, this is there flag ship and I can see why this is so popular..."

"Unlike most in the area, I am not overy impressed with Beaus (or this beer). Smell is grainy and earthy. Taste is malty and grainy, and for the most part leaves an aftertaste of dirt. moderate bitterness rolls through the finish. Not bad on a summer day but wouldnt be the first beer i would go for. Being that it is made locally still makes me pick one up from time to time"

"Quite enjoyable stuff, not your average beer for sure. Refreshing with good balance, nice complexity and flavour."

"Final Thoughts: This beer to me comes across as a more lager like Kellerbier. The peppery taste is there and amped up, the malt isn't quite there but the hops make more of a presence known. All in all, this would be great with a summer time steak."

"O/D - Pretty smooth and tasty. Something to drink over conversation as I did. It's quality doesn't get in the way of the company, but doesn't disgust."

"A 44 pack that's been inhabiting my fridge, this poured a slightly cloudy yellow orange with a touch of lacing at the top. Smell is very malty grassy aroma, pleasant. Flavor is good, refreshing, malt is dominant with a german hop bitterness finish. Mouthfeel is very clean. Overall this is a very simple refreshing summer beer, a little expensive but good nonetheless."
"O - not a bad brew although I will not being gabbing the $15 4 pack after sampling this"
"A nice crisp ale. For me the graininess is too high, especially given that it is meant to be a Kolsch."
"This was my first kolsch, and I rather liked it. Worth a try, I'd say, and definitely more interesting than many other fizzy yellow lagers that may superficially resemble it."
"O - A tasty koslch, offering a solid dose of flavour and a nice crisp and clean finish. A quality example of the style."
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with great flavours and aromas. Props to Beau's."
"Crystal clear pale blonde colour, one finger of white head with some lace. Smell is grainy and earthy, malt is there too but fresh earth dominates this brew. Taste is malty and grainy, cereal like, lots of muddy-earthy notes, moderate bitterness rolls through the finish. Medium body, med-high carb, good weight. Not bad on a hot day like the one I had this on, this bottle was about 5 weeks old and this beer is much better when it is fresh as possible, I will revisit this though I am sure."
"Overall- Never really tried a “lagered ale” before so I was not sure what to expect from this one, but I was pleasantly surprised, this beer is very sweet and lots of biscuit malts coming through on both the nose and the palate, lots of earthy grassy notes coming through on both the nose and palate with some mild fruity flavours coming through as well. Again a very clean, crisp, and refreshing beer that I would definitely drink again, I kind of had a feeling I should have picked up some of the 650mL 4-packs when I had the chance, but thanks to the OCB summer discovery pack I finally got to try this one."
"Ordered on a whim at a nice restaurant in Ontario. Was pleasantly surprised when it arrived with a bright golden color and a slightly fruity aroma. The first sip was very crisp and refreshing with a full bodied, but balanced taste. The flavor was interesting, but not distracting and it complemented the multi-course meal nicely. A very easy drinking beer that I would definitely seek out in the future. As the flagship for Beau's Brewery, I am excited to try out their other brews."
"D: Nicely drinkable. Have had this on-tap a few times and prefer it in that format as it tastes much fresher. Looking forward to trying other Beau's offerings."
"Good value overall at about $3.50 per bomber and has a rich, satisfying taste, maybe a bit heavy as a session beer, but great for 1-2 pints. Drink it fresh though, I've had some older ones that weren't nearly as good."
"o-overall this was quite good. Solid offering from Beau's for sure. I def want to try more of their stuff."
"Lacing draped on the glass is thick and sticky; bright golden clarity is inviting. Clean biscuity nose with hits of apple skin and dried grass. Lager tickles from the brisk carbonation, though the body stands like an ale. Malt bomb of the pale shade with lots of bread and biscuity flavors. Ripe pears in the middle. Clean bite of hops is there to balance and flavor with an herbal spicy edge. Kiss of grain husk and more herbal hop in the dry finish. A well-paid homage to its German counterparts--a whole lot of flavor without distracting from the high level of drinkability."
"Drinkability - As a on tap selection i was quite happy to drink this all night, was a good beer."
"this beer is for someone who likes macro lager and wants to try something a little cleaner tasting. i dont dislike it but there is nothing to bring me back either."
"Pours a clear light yellow with a foamy white head that dissipates quickly. Nose is strong of farmhouse hay, grain, corn and faint malt. Taste is actually much better than expected...More malt profile in the flavour and balanced quite well with the yeast. Some bitterness lingers, but mainly grassy taste remains. A lighter mouthfeel that is dry. One bottle will suffice, perhaps a step up from any macro lager but otherwise I wouldn't reach for another. Great looking custom bottle and label/cap, Beaus got that right at least."
"Drink - Although this beer was better on draft than from the bottle, I still don't enjoy the 'farm taste'. The straw/hay notes really overpower the beer."
"This marks my first beer from Beau's and I'm quite impressed. I think I've only had three Kolsch's up to this point, and this was by far my favorite. Refreshing crisp, and easyyyy drinking; perfect for the months of summer. This may not be the best time to drink this beer, but I still enjoyed it nonetheless. Worth a pick up for sure!"
"Pours into my tiny Kolsch glass with a clear, straw/golden colour and moderate white head. Aroma shows off fresh grainy biscuit mixed with lemon zest and spice. The biscuit flavour dominates the taste at first but quickly leads into a delicious fruity apple-like sweetness with just enough herbal/spicy hops to balance things out. It isn't intensely flavourful or overly complex, but it's everything I would want from this rare style. Grateful to have access to fresh Kolsch all summer long (purchased at LCBO two days after bottling!)."
"D: Extremely drinkable, very very sessionable."
"Has some good characteristics, but aspects of it seem really off to my palate, just doesn't work for me."
"Nice looking bottle though not the ceramic version. This is a beer to enjoy when the weather warms up as it tastes incredibly clean and crisp but with that slightly fruity note that defines a Kolsch. Like Mt Begbies canned version in BC , a well made Kolsch is entirely welcome in my house ( especially since no German versions are sold in BC). Food friendly and incredibly drinkable this beer shows how a simple beer can please as much as a high octane IBU monster"
"D - A very enjoyable beer. Getting through the bomber of this was no problem at all."
"I've passed it up a few times at the LCBO, but I think I'll be back for a sampling of that next time I'm 'round. Good, highly drinkable stuff."
"And, oh yea, they have a pretty quality, kick-ass flagship beer too!"
"thanks ritzkiss for a nice random beer that I never would have tried otherwise."
"This is one of those great beers that should appeal to both craft and macro drinkers - perhaps something akin to a Boston Lager. Its not too far removed from what macro drinkers would expect in a beer, but its done with such a deft hand that it will introduce them to what even an easy drinking beer can be capable of. I'm glad they went this route rather than beginning with some crappy lager or pale ale."
"Personally I would enjoy a little less malt sweetness on the tongue an. Could use a touch more acidity to get me stoked on the style."
"You could easily pound pints of this in the summer on the patio, at the beach, BBQing... perfect light summer beer."
"Overall: This is a hard style to review for me as it is not the most flavorful of beer styles (for me anyways). Regardless, i enjoyed it and would have it again."
"I love the new 4 packs of 600mL bottles that are in the LCBO. I think this is a great beer for the macro crowd, while still being interesting enough for the beer geeks."
"This is very drinkable. Would make a great session beer. Nice flavourful, simple brew. I would definitely order this again."
"600ml bottle from the Cooper Street LCBO in Toronto, Ontario. Pours into the stange a golden straw yellow with a ring of white head that persists for the duration of the beer. Aroma and flavour are yeast, sweet and grainy malts, honey, a bit of funk, lemon grass, soapy and herbal hops, and a parched, wheat cereal aftertaste. Mouthfeel is crisp and medium bodied with a spicy, peppery bite and dry finish. Very clean and refreshing. One of the best session beers in the province, great for quaffing on a sunny afternoon!"
"overall nice and crisp, a perfect option on a nice spring/summer afternoon"
"D: Extremely easy to drink; a great beer to start the evening with, or to have on a hot day. An encouraging flagship brew that only makes me want to try more from Beau's."
"An interesting enough 'lagered ale', but not enough to have another, or drop a MacD on one of those big bottles at the LCBO."
"A golden coloured ale with a fingers worth of fizzy white head. The head is poorly retained and leaves no lace behind. Smells like pils malt, grass, and hay with a faint hint of lemon. Very mild aroma. The flavour shows bread malt and tangy lemon with a grassy finish. Finishes dry with medium bitterness. I have to dock it for the cooked vegetable note that comes forward as it warms. It's bad enough to completely ruin an otherwise fairly tasty beer. It reminds me of the vegetative flavour in the Nickel Brook Organic Lager. Light bodied with medium carbonation, feels crisp. Drinks easy. It's alright, but I don't know if I would buy it again at eight dollars per 750mL bottle."
"D: Wether you are getting this for the style, the beer, or the bottle. It's worth the cost. It's economical, but it doesn't quite comply with my tastes. Good beer none the less."
"A decent Kolsch, hoppier than I expected, worth a try."
"The carbonation was balanced and felt nice, which matched the chewiness of the beer."
"Nice mouthfeel and pretty drinkable, something has to be done about this plastic taste though."
"At almost $8 a 750ml bottle it's hard to justify drinking this regularly."
"D: A good drinker."
"Drinkability: A very simple beer, perfect for that hot summer night of relaxing on the porch. I will be keeping an eye out for more on my travels."
"A fantastically moreish drinker, very light but satisfying at the same time. It has a aura of a macro taste about it, but at the same time it reeks of quality. A very smart choice for a flagship beer in this market as I think those who are used to macro lagers and order this because it's local will be pleasantly surprised enough to make the switch."
"As someone stated earlier, this would make a great session beer. Now I just need to find out where I can return the bottles!"
"This is a well-done version of a style I find boring. I'm unlikely to order it again, but it will be successful and rightly so. It's well-made craft beer."
"D - Easy drinking, light, but with plenty of character. Would be nice to session (also the bottle is cool)."
"Bottle: Poured a deep clear golden color Kölsch with a big foamy head with average retention and no lacing. Aroma of unrefined grain and weird dry ester is not overly pleasant. Taste is a mix between rich medium sweet grains with again some dry ester. Full body with good carbonation is pleasant. I have to admit that this is not a style that I am overly knowledgeable about or that I appreciated a whole lot but I thought this was acceptable."
"Pours a golden lager colour. The scent and taste remind of some pilsners I have. This has lot's of character. I like the after taste a lot - grassy and classy. i've had this on draft before but surprisingly I'm enjoying this more out of the bottle. It tastes a lot fresher. The ceramic bottle with the rubber sealed stopper is a keeper too. Very nice."
"Mouthfeel was spot on, not overboard on carbonation. This was a great smooth drink. A session beer with flavour that stays true to it's continental roots. Good stuff."
"Impression: A very well made and subtly complex Kolsch-styled ale with soft flavourful character and great drinkability."
"On tap at the Clock Tower in Ottawa as a guest tap. Fresh. Pale yellow with a good head.Significant candy sugar aroma. Watery. A faint bitterness offsetting the taste of sugar and water. Drinkable on a hot summer day, maybe the formula has been altered as it should have more hops."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden/yellow, thick white head, nice lacing, looks good. Smell is sweet, very clean, malty, some yeast, citrus, refreshing. Taste is nice and malty, some sweetness, wheat, very grainy, citrus, with a dry finish, kind of lemony. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, low carbonation. I understand they've had some consistency problems with this one, but a decent drink and an underrepresented style."
