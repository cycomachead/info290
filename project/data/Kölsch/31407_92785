4.02,14.2,3.5,4,4,4,4.25,"The beer is light golden colored and topped with a small white head with okay retention and a few strings of lacing. The aroma smells like a fresh kolsch, with hay, fruitiness, and a mineral note. A good start, which only continues into the taste. The taste is a little stronger per style with a brush of fruitness, pleasing hay, whispers of malt, complemented with a light body and gentle carbonation. For a beer lover who has had fresh kolsch in Cologne itself, Saint Archer has hit the target very well. Well worth the purchase, and a better option than Yellowtail Pale Ale among San Diego made kolsch-styled beers.","DoubleJ","Oct 14, 2013"

3.88,10.2,3,3.75,4,4,4,"Pours a hazy yellow with a foamy off-white head that fades to nothing. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and grassy aromas. Taste is much the same with grain and grassy flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty, refreshing, and very easy to drink.","UCLABrewN84","Jul 24, 2013"

3.89,10.5,3.5,3.75,4,3.75,4,"A little sharp, quite light bodied, with that distinctive perfumey flavor. Quite drinkable with a hoppiness that seems to grow as you sip. Perhaps more hoppy than some examples of the style, but so much better than many American examples. Pleasingly bitter and it's mellowed by something like graham crackers, though not sweet at all. From the 22 oz bottle purchased at Bottleworks in San Diego at a price I'd like to see more of: $4.15.","mactrail","0"
