The taste had a definite German tilt to it, as expected, but wheat and banana...reminded me more of a Kristalweizen than a Kolsch.

As one friend pointed out, it does smell a touch like feet, but I think that's mostly the mild sulphurs from the German character. Overall it's a decent session beer with a lot of subtle spicy notes. As the beer warmed, that foot-like aroma did intensify, but it's otherwise a decent stab at the style. I'd rather have my kolsch have too much spice than too little.","tempest","Aug 21, 2010"

Smells of funk, wine, fruits/citrus and malts, not very strong smell though. Tastes of wine, grapes, malts and a bit of hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is light a bit too watery, warming, creamy and a good flavor coat. Drinkability is good, good taste, good price, no off flavors to kill it.","cbutova","Oct 10, 2009"

3.68,-0.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Pours a pale, cloudy, straw yellow with a fluffy white head that leaves a thin cover. The smell is pale malts with some lemon and straw. The taste is light with a nutty dry taste followed by lemon citrus and a slight hop. This one is very refreshing. The nuttiness is a little watery which detracts a little from the flavor. It is tart yet a little creamy. The drinkability is great with it going down smooth and easy. I think if the nuttiness was a little less up front and maybe an afterthought this would be better. I like the tart dry finish though. Very well done, maybe I need to try it fresher as this is listed as summer and there is no date on the bottle.","CrazyMacHarris99","Feb 18, 2009"

The aroma was an appealing blend of pale malt, fruity yeast and some light hops. The flavors started out with a lemony hop note that then became a little grassy and seemed to be resting on the pale malt backbone. Slightly doughy and slightly bitter.

It was a great way for me to try what a Kolsh style beer is. With such a low alcohol content, I could have a few and not have the wife yell at me! haha","blackheartbilly","Dec 31, 2007"

It's light and refreshing, but it's an off flavor. I think it's the yeast. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a low/medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is an average beer.

The taste is on the dry side, a little lemony, some hoppy bite towards the end with a little yeasty zing added as well. The mouthfeel is creamy and the aftertaste is not overpowering. This is not an overly interesting beer, but it is refreshing and quite drinkable. For a summertime ale, I prefer a wheat or hefe to this style, but that is just me.","albern","Jul 08, 2007"

3.98,7.6,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Another good offering from BBC, would I say it is one of their best, no way but it is a good beer. The brew poured to a somewhat cloudy golden yellow color with a solid sized head that had great retention that left a good amount of lacing. The aroma is nice as both malt and yeast scents come to the forefront. In the background I think I am picking up a citric scent that I think would be hops, just wonder if I am trying to hard to pick it up. The taste is nice as a few other things come out here. The malt and yeast flavors seem to clearly be there but also picking up a clear, though not dominant, hop flavor. Also some flavors of nuts, lemon, biscuit and others that all seem to come and go which lead to a complexity that I was not expecting. This would be a nice warm weather brew as it is very easy drinking.","Stimack","Apr 07, 2007"
3.71,0.3,4,3,4,3.5,4,"Pours crystal clear and extremely pale with yellow highlights and a bright white head that sticks around well for the style. Slight, grainy aroma with some fresh hop characteristics but little else. On the palate, well-developed cooked grain note first off, but as the beer warms up this dissipates a bit, being replaced by a slightly sweet malt note, then some bitterness at the mid-palate and a slight flash of acidity before the finish dries out. Big carbonation throughout and light in mouthfeel. Overall, this is a fine example of an American kolsch. Not my favorite style by any means, but it's decent.","geexploitation","Apr 06, 2007"

Nice rendition of the Krolsh style of beer. Funny label with the two owners on the Gary and Chris. Scene from when the Gold Spike brought together the two railroads. Not notched for freshness. Very smooth and light. Enjoyable beer and I would drink it again.","bigone4","Oct 16, 2006"

4.2,13.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"D: This one is incredibly easy to drink. Its light with good flavor. It seems to me that this beer is exactly what the macros wish they could be, in terms of quality. Normally, I would go for something with more taste or kick or both, but this hit the spot on a warm night when I just needed something refreshing. Its just what you would look for in a summer beer.","TheManiacalOne","Sep 09, 2006"
3.78,2.2,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"I have always been a fan of Berkshire Beers. They seem to hit the markw tih me almost one hundred percent of the time. Gold Spike pours a golden straw color, with a nice rocky white head that clung to the sides of the glass. Smell was somewhat pungeant, but with some grassy earth notes that made it a bit more well rounded. Taste was also full of grassy earth flavors, a little bit of honey, and quite a bit of hop bitterness, especially towards the end. Mouthfeel was light, but the hops make it seem slightly heavier then it really is. This was very drinkable in the respect that It was very refreshing. Like everybody else has said of this style, It is perfect for the Summer months, where you need something to quench your thirst on a humid day. Another impressive beer from a very impressive brewery.","jamie2dope","Jul 17, 2006"

I would, however, suggest trying it on a hot and humid day where I imagine it would reach the highest ""refreshingness"" level.","smcolw","Jul 30, 2005"
3.07,-17,2.5,3,3,3,3.5,"Pours a one-fingered white head that fades quickly leaving no lace. Cloudy light amber color, yeast settling out. Hoppy/malty nose. Light carbonation and light bodied. Starts with a malty/hop flavor, finish is clean. Definitely a summer ale. $3.25 for a 22oz bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, Ma.","jdhilt","Jun 25, 2005"
3.73,0.8,3.5,3,4,4,4,"I think this is my second Kolsch. I remember not liking my first very much. But this is a whole other experience. Pours very pale in color with a thin head that receded very quickly. Any lace quickly slid down the inside of the glass. Aroma is very slight--mostly of malts; very subtle. Flavor is all malts, some veggie-ness going on, but just from the hop additions. Very clean, The hops are pretty subtle also. Very light and crisp finish. Slightly dryness on the tongue too. Very easy to drink. Great sessional brew with the appropriate ABV to drink in quantity.","MuddyFeet","Jun 12, 2005"

4.2,13.5,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours very hazy golden amber. One-finger head with smooth, tiny bubbles. Retention is fairly good. Smells of malt, wheat, and citrus. Delicate wheat and malt flavors along with rather substantial citrus are the noticeable components of the taste. Mouthfeel is very good, consistent and smooth. Another fine example of beer from BBC. Good for those hot summer nights sweating in your apartment over the boiler room.","aquatonex","Aug 19, 2004"

Taste was initially lightly sweet, followed by a slight hop presence. Mouthfeel was light with some cabonation. Light quality makes it very drinkable. Probably a good summer brew. Not my favorite style, but enjoyable nonetheless.","edchicma","Apr 02, 2004"
4.1,10.8,4,4,4,4,4.5,"22 oz. bomber straight from Berkshire County. Pours a clear straw color with a nice foamy cloud of a head. The aromas are of sweet honey and bready malt. The malt flavor swims through first with a delicate hop spice. Notes of bready malt float up toward the finish with a refreshing, crisp, easy drinking end.","beernut7","Nov 01, 2003"
3.95,6.8,4,4,4,3.5,4,"This kolsch ale poured a clear, golden yellow color with white foam that settled. The smell was wheaty and malt. The taste was wheat and malt with a hint of hops, but with an unexpected hint of banana. The mouthfeel was smooth with medium-light body and medium carbonation. This beer was light and refreshing though the banana flavor was a bit unexpected for the style.","UncleJimbo","Jul 14, 2003"
3.88,4.9,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Notes: Very refreshing with some simple complexities. Between the freshness of the brew and it being bottle conditioned it brings me to a happy place in beer heaven.","Jason","Jun 27, 2003"
