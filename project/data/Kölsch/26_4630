Taste is moderately sweet cracker, biscuit, honey, and grass, initially. There is a lightly hop bitterness on the swallow. Light bodied, moderate but assertive carbonation, smooth barely thick texture, dry, crisp finish.","SierraFlight","Jan 26, 2015"

An 1/8 inch white cap sits on top of the beer and is perpetuated by carbonation bubbles rising from the bottom. Tart Czech Pilsener nose. A bit of green grape and some unripe banana peel. A pretty surprising mouthfeel given the appearance and the bouquet. One would expect something lighter and crisper. The mouthfeel is full and a bit thick, nearing chewy. Smooth on the finish. Really nice balance in the flavor. Sweetness and tartness work together nicely. Nothing obtrusive. It's a really good beer overall. However, it shouldn't be $7.99 a bomber.","DocJitsu","Jan 13, 2013"

Pours lightly hazy golden straw color with a foamy 1-2 finger bright white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of lemon, pear, apple, cracker, bread, honey, grass, floral, herbal, and earthy spiciness. Nice, pleasant, and well balanced aromas with decent strength; on par for the style. Taste of pear, apple, lemon, cracker, bready grain, grass, floral, herbal, and earthy spiciness. Light yeast tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruits, cracker, bready grain, grass, floral, herbal, and earthy spiciness on the finish for a short bit. Very nice balance of flavors; with a typical flavor complexity for the style; and zero cloying flavors on the finish as expected. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and lightly crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Kolsch style! Nice balance of flavors with solid complexity; and extremely smooth and crisp to drink. Very enjoyable offering, and on par with the style as expected.","superspak","Dec 30, 2012"

An ale with lager like characteristics. Hmm.. Idk.. while Calumet Queen wasn't horrible I can't say it's worthy of being Alpha King's girl friend or anything close to having a relationship for that matter. You are talking big time class in alpha and just so so with calumet. It was cool to get a not always released bottle from FFF and this experience will not stop the fact that I'll buy anything FFF if I see it, but this wasn't good enough for me to want again. But then again I don't think it's 3 Floyds, I think it's just the style. I mean in terms of this German style they hit it out of the park, but the kolsch ball park isn't all that big IMO. Worth a try, but nothing to get your hopes up on. This is one of my least favorite German styles and 3F did well with it.. But this just shows how hard it is to make a really good kolsch. But hey, that's just my tastebuds. I give them credit for doing it well, but how well can one do a kolsch? I doubt any better than Calumet. It shows how good FFF are, but in turn shows me how bad the Kolsch style is.","BradtheGreat7","Dec 26, 2012"

2.65,-26.6,3,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Had this on tap this weekend at the brew pub. Orange and turbid. small head gone very fast. Mild odor, slightly spicy, some hops evident. Very diluted, watery tasting beer, like a tripel diluted 1:8. Some spice, not much else. My least favorite 3F so far.","aforbes10","May 26, 2005"
3.31,-8.3,4,3,3.5,3.5,3,"D- The hops are not that interesting and they hang on the tongue after each sip overpowering the malt. This is a tough style to pull off and I'm afraid they didn't do it.","rhoadsrage","Dec 01, 2002"
2.46,-31.9,4,3,2,2,2.5,"Draft poured by Nick Floyd. Can this be? A 3F thats not that great??! Well, maybe the tap was off because I tasted nothing that matched the style description or other reviews. I got a big off-flavor of raw grain. Mild citrus hop could not make up for it. I will have to re-sample sometime.","DrunkMcDermott","Oct 18, 2002"
3.92,8.6,4,4.5,3.5,4,4,"Clear gold / straw color, with a thin head... leaves some lace on the glass. Aroma is slightly grainy, with a fairly strong herbal character... a lot of noble hops in there. Flavor begins cracker-like, the becomes herbal, spicy, and finally bitter. It's very heavily hopped... more than I'd normally expect for a Kölsch... then again, this is Three Floyds... ""It's not normal."" With a crisp taste, and light body... it's quite refreshing.","zerk","Oct 14, 2002"

3.65,1.1,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This beer was a light gold color and a little cloudy. It had a small white head that left trace lace.  An aroma of hops and slightly herbal/grainey.  A flavor of hops and grain.  The finish and body was light but a touch astrigent.  I am not really a fan of this stye, but not a bad beer.  A bit odd to pick this time of the year to put in on tap though.","Wildman","Beers"
3.93,8.9,4,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Pale golden and slightly hazy, nice white head.  Herbal aroma, with a bit of the 'new mown hay' smell, but not strong.  Taste is clean and crisp.  Fairly spicy, but not overwhelming.  Really seemed like a beer truer to the style than I've come to expect from Three Floyd's (""They're not normal!"").  Still, a good brew.  Light flavor and low abv make this a solid beer for the summertime.","Viking","0"
