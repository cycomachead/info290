"Not a fan of this beer.  The hops seemed bitter without any real flavor."
""
"The feel of this beer is smooth with a nice drinkable feel that goes down easy and really works well with your palette and lets it’s silky body let it glide down. A great drinker and one that would great any time."

"I got no hoppiness at all, dry finish...I was disappointed"

"Quick drinking thanks to its pale malt-grassy hop balance. Refreshing."

"Solid example of the style, I quite enjoyed this one. Very easy drinking and worth a shot."

"Ok - straw taste, not fruity"

"BOD 177/14.  Pours a clear light amber (golden).  Above average head volume, excellent lacing and retention.  Light nose of fruity esters and yeast over a biscuit base with a hint of spice. Almost light medium body with a nice slick texture.  Slightly below normal carbonation with just a touch of effervescence in the finish.  The flavor profile is quite nice for a Kolsch.  Above average intensity for the style, well balanced and fairly complex.  It begins with a mix of light fruit (banana, pear) that flows into a somewhat crisp biscuit sweetness.  The middle is a very mild hop bitterness that is herbal in nature that yields to a slight note of pepper like spice. The finish is a slow fade of herbal bitterness and biscuit that ends with a touch of dryness."

"Overall- Outstanding due to the full flavor and smoothness. The maltiness and sweetness compliment each other very well. This beer should just be called Kolsch as Pale Ale is a bit deceptive due to the style. Nevertheless a high quality beer that should be tasted."

"Has that characteristic kolsch fruitiness in the aroma, along with bready, nutty malt. Flavor follows suit, with a backbone of nutty malt, asking with fruity yeast. Highly carbonated, so the toasted malt doesn't weigh it down. Very drinkable, but nothing outstanding. More malty than most examples of the style."

"I thought I was getting a pale ale and was pretty confused until I looked it up. Wanted to have some gentle hops today but for Kolsh it was okay. Pretty simple light malty flavor with  some hints of apricot and sweetness. I should probably try it again when I want a Kolsh."

"I think this is pretty well done for its style. I was taken a bit off guard at first, as I was not expecting a Klosch Style Ale, but rather something along the lines of a American Pale Ale (I failed to see the small print that denoted the beer as ""Klosch Style""). Overall, I would say it is a pretty decent beer that can appeal to a wide audience. It would be a fantastic beer to drink by the pool on a hot day."
"Overall, a decent brew. Sessionable. Good beer to drink while watching a sporting event on TV, which is what I did."

"O: A good standard American pale ale with a small interesting twist which is the slightly fruity, but not very long facet of the finish. The label does say in small letters ""Kolsch Style Ale", and I wonder if this was added to account for the fruitiness, or if this was intentional. I'd drink more of these, but might not seek it out."
"Poured from bottle to glass. Orange, yellow, brown in appearance. Small head that quickly dissipated. Decent carbonation. Strong malt nose, really enjoyable smell. Taste wasn't as balanced. Heavy malt flavor, apple, little bit of spice, really sweet. Very low bitterness with high amount sweetness made the beer off balanced. Medium mouth feel. Not bad but there are much better beers from this brewery."

"Overall - When is an ale not an ale? When it's a Ballast Point kolsch style ale. This beer taste like an adjunct American lager, only more so. That's not necessarily a bad thing."

"Pours from the can with a slightly hazy, apple-juice-like yellow-orange color and a big, fluffy head. The aroma is musty yet clean, like a freshly scrubbed beach house. The flavor has a nice balance of herbal, slightly lemony hops over a bed of light, biscuity malts that provide a note of sweetness. The fine carbonation, medium resinous body and drying finish all act to weigh down the flavors rather than lift them up, though. Overall, however, this is a light and drinkable yet satisfying beer that I would gladly reach for again."

"*Apparently this is the next generation of their Yellowtail Pale Ale."
""
"Overall, I've got to say I really do like this beer, and maybe I'm biased based upon the amount of fun I have had drinking this Pale Ale, but I would still recommend this to any of my friends for a warm summer evening."
"Our original Pale Ale is a rich golden brew, crafted with aromatic German hops and rounded out with a blend of American and Munich malts. While it’s hopped like a lager, we ferment it like an ale to create a smooth, bright taste that has just a hint of fruit and spice. It’s extremely drinkable, like a Kolsch should be, yet complex, like a good craft beer demands."
