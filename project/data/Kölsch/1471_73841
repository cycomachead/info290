By no means is it a bad product, in fact, Kmita Kölsch is a very well-made beer, it just doesn't fit guidelines. I'd love to know the story behind this beer; I feel that it might make the experience make a little more sense.

3.84,13.3,3.75,3.5,4,3.75,4,"I remember being so perplexed by the concept of a ""Polish-style kolsch"" this past summer that I ran out to the Whole Foods in Lincoln Park and grabbed a pint at their bar. Good times. Let's have another, shall we? This stuff pours a partly hazy copper-amber topped by a finger of glowing off-cream-white foam. The nose comprises toasted and buttery biscuit, candied orange zest, and a hint of fennel. The taste holds notes of tangelo zest, orange peel, light black pepper, toasted biscuit, and a dash of nutmeg. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a creamily drying finish. Overall, a tasty interpretation of a kolsch, even if it bears only a small resemblance to the base style.","TMoney2591","0"

Aromas of apples, pear, caramel, toast, bread, herbal, floral, grass, and light earth. Ok aromas but they were fairly weak and unbalanced; possible fermentation issues due to apple in aromas. Taste of pear, caramel, toast, biscuit, grass, floral, apple, and light herbal spiciness. Light spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruit, caramel, toast, biscuit, grass, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a short bit. Fairly dry on the finish. Pretty good flavor balance and complexity; no cloying sweetness. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and slightly crisp mouthfeel that is ok.

Mouth-feel is on the thinner side of medium, decent carbonation. Overall, I found this to be weird.

This beer didn't have the best drinkability, it wasn't that smooth and the flavors don't hold my interest as well as they should, one is enough for me. What I liked most about this beer was that the taste actually had something that resembled a Kolsch unlike most of this beer. What I liked least about this beer was how confusing it was, this beer just didn't seem to be that cohesive. I don't think I would buy this beer again, it was interesting to try, but nothing I feel like I have to try, it's worth a try but don't expect a classic Kolsch.

The taste is similar to the aroma with a lingering bitterness in the finish. Again, it is actually quite enjoyable, but it is not a kolsch. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with virtually no carbonation. Overall, when I see a style designation on a beer's label I expect it to at least vaguely represent that style. I have no idea what a ""Polish Kolsch"" is supposed to taste like, but I thought it was reasonable to expect something similar to a real kolsch.

Smell is caramel forward with some light floral and pale malt. Sweeter with warming drink this up quick. Taste is refreshing, this bottle is super fresh and this particular Kolsch delves into amber ale territory. Light flavor with a caramel backing. An earthy hop flavor at this fresh stage.
