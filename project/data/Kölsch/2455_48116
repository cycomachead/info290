3.75,2.7,,,,,,"The Crack! was as loud as a CANnon and the CAN was as full as the trenches in early-1915. The inverted Glug was precise in its deployment and quickly netted me two fingers of foamy, fizzy, bone-white head that began to collapse under the exertion, leaving Belgian lacing in its wake. Color was Straw-Yellow (SRM = 3.9, a preciseness measured by the brewery), as yellow as the cowards who retreated In the face of the enemy, and with NE-plus quality clarity, allowing me to peer into a grim future. Nose was what I tend to think of with regard to the style – slightly honey-like, slightly grassy. If we still rated on Smell, I would characterize this as “Perfect”. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium. The taste was grassy and honey-like, sort of a Gateway between a light lager and a German Pilsner. I have to disagree with them as to “… a sweet finish” because I would characterize it as “Dry”. The CAN mentions “O.G. 11.5 P and IBU 32.3”, so I think that an argument CAN be made for my point of view. A very nice, light drinking beer on a Summer’s day.","woodychandler","Aug 10, 2014"

Steady carbonation action throughout the body, too. Nose of toasted grains, subtle floral notes, and hints of berry esthers. Flavors are tangy forward, with buttered toast notes, and a subtle hops bitterness. Smooth and light, with a frothy, effervesced finish. Tangy, grainy aftertaste.
