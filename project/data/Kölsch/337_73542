Went with an IPA next than came back for anther Santo to try confirm if I was off or the rating was. I really enjoyed the second as much as the first. Not sure why this beer gets a bad rap but I would surely buy it again if I see it on tap or in a store. Definitely recommend trying and keeping your mind open and not let the low scores sour your opinion.","sjones5045","Jul 24, 2014"

There is a small amount of lacing that quickly recedes after swirling. It does not persist on the glass. There is a sour, bready and almost fruity aroma. Almost roasted malty taste up front with a very slight bitterness, followed by a very mild sweetness at the end. As a ""black kolsch", it is definitely a unique beer. I have had it before and will most likely drink it if available again. It is one of my wife's favorite beers, otherwise, I probably wouldn't stock it in the fridge that often.","jngrizzaffi","Jun 05, 2013"

Poured a deep ruby red dark brown with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wheat, spice, grain, dark chocolate, and toasted malt. The flavor was of sweet malt, dark chocolate, milk chocolate, wheat, grain, toasted malt, and cream. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a fairly good brew. I honestly went into this one not expecting very much. What I found was actually quite nice and well balanced. There was a nice roastiness/toastiness going on in this one that really added a nice touch to this brew and was definitely different for the style. This was a welcomed change in the way that they executed it. Really glad I got the chance to try this one and suggest you do the same if you get the opportunity!","thagr81us","Nov 13, 2012"

2.91,-13.4,3.5,2.5,3,3,3,"Looks like a pretty root beer without the head. Smells like not-much-to-right-home-about. Some sweetness on the sniffer, but it's a hunting expedition in the Amazon to find it. Bubbly on the tongue, more so than I expected due to the lack of foamy head. It doesn't taste like much at all. It's soooo subtle with a bit of toasted Grape Nuts in the finish. Hops weren't invented when this beer was brewed. That's the only reason I can think of for there not being any. A black lager/Kolsch (I guess) that needs more flava-flave.","specksnreds","0"

3.35,-0.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Thanks to texasfan549, pours deep black with a 2"" white head, nice lacing. The aroma has roasted notes, chocolate notes. The first sip has nice roasted and chocolate notes, then it faded a bit. It finishes light. The body is too thin, good carbonation. Black kolsch, maybe not the best idea. Not sure this is the proper style.","bonkers","Nov 30, 2011"

3.11,-7.4,4,3,3,3.5,3,"Crisp, black, malty and clean taste. Mild chalky bitterness lingering. No oil or fruit present. This was kind of a mystery beer to me because of the cool art on the label (also, bottlecap is nice design too) and the lack of any description of the brew. As I understand it's a ""black kolsch."" Seems to fit Texas to a ""T."" Burnt roast mild coffee-like flavor with refreshing light brew. Kind of a nice mix.","SkipWeathers","Nov 01, 2011"
3.36,0,4,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Opinion: Overall this is a pretty decent beer. It has enough character that it sets itself apart a bit in the craft-beer market so that it might lead a Lawnmower drinker to try different beers. That said, the beer lacks the complexity that I would like to put it in the outstanding category. Even a black Koelsch should showcase some of the fruity aspects of the yeast while still having good head retention and more of a sweet aspect to the dark malts, so maybe this would have just necessitated taking out the very dark malts for some dark crystal and fermenting it a tad warmer. This may have brought it a little closer in, but regardless, it is a pretty good attempt at something that doesn't exist.","SkeeterHawk","Oct 31, 2011"

3.25,-3.3,3.5,3.5,3,4,3,"Poured from bottle into DFH snifter. Pours a murky brown/black color, reminiscent of brown tea as it leaves the bottle. Dark in color as it gets into the glass, but light gets through. Smell- roasted malt, tea leaves, a little bit of coffee and mocha. reminds me of a dobblebock in appearance and smell. Taste- tea leaves, a faint bitterness, maybe some coffee flavors again. Overall, not much here. A little bland and boring. Really rich carbonation here too. A realize that they are trying to make a session beer here, but I don't see ever making a session out of this. A little blah on this beer.","lnashsig","Oct 19, 2011"
3,-10.7,3,3,3,3,3,"This is a completely average dark beer with the plus that the flavor doesn't linger very long. It's not mind blowing but I'm not sure it was really trying to be either. A very drinkable beer from Brock at SA.","kcbearkat","Sep 27, 2011"
3,-10.7,3,3,3,3,3,"The beer pours a dark brown color with an off-white head. The aroma is a mix of toffee and toasted malt, with some earthy hops. There is also a little bit of chocolate in the aroma. The flavor is somewhat strange. I get some toffee and roasted malt, but there is also some earthy and grass notes. The finish is pretty clean like you would expect from a kolsch, but other than that this tastes more like a standard dunkel lager or something similar. Thin mouthfeel and medium carbonation.","Mora2000","Beers"
3.03,-9.8,3.5,3,3,3,3,"It's a decent beer but I think's there's some better options for a highly drinkable beer with dark beer tastes such as Full Sail Sessions Black.","zander4dawin","0"
