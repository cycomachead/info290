Ratings above are for style - I would estimate a score based on my preferences would be closer to 3.35.This rather tasted like a better quality AAL. I could envision this being an excellent "craft conversion" beer, but it's nothing I'd grab repeatedly on purpose. Just glancing at the label, I thought this was going to be an APA…should have read better. Still, it's more than drinkable and refreshing while it's cold.","macrosmatic","May 04, 2014"

I get the label after a sip, this is lawnmower beer for sure. hot summer day, lots of sweaty yard work to do, this is your horse (if founders all day doesn't work for you). grassy finish, light and clean, refreshment to the max when ice cold.

Initial nose indicates that this might have a Kolsch taste to it, but scents can be deceiving. The first taste is surprisingly disappointing. There's a strong hint of corn, and some degree of bitterness. It completely lacks any bread flavor that I associate with a quality Kolsch. Rather, it has the mouth feel of an American lager+. In that sense, it's clean and non-offensive, and definitely a pounding beer -- as in just finished mowing the lawn in Texas beer. I hope Saint Arnold's reformulates this with possible adjustments to the malt and yeast (or rebrands it for what it is, along with a steeper price reduction), because a good Kolsch is hard to find. As is, it's disappointing, and I'll be avoiding it and its sidekick, Weedwacker.","pgfault","Jul 19, 2012"

Plenty of tiny bubbles can be seen rising from the bottom of the glass. There's also the appearance of some sediment. Some lacing is left behind on the side of the glass as the head dissipates. The aroma is of malt and yeast. It's a very basic sweet, bready smell. That sweet breadiness from the yeast and the malt hits the mouth up front. There are some minor hop notes, but these are not strong. The body is light with moderate carbonation. The finish is crisp and dry. The drinkability is high, especially on a hot summer day. This is a very good beer that is perfect for summer consumption.","acevenom","Jun 19, 2012"

The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wheat, grain, grass clippings, and skunk hop. The flavor was sweet malt, wheat, skunky hop, and slight nutmeg. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew, but it wasn't too awe-inspiring. I found it odd that grass clippings showed up in the aroma though, but I guess it was only fitting.

Pours a murky gold which clears around the edges. One and a half fingers of white head dissipates quickly, settling into a thin layer on top and leaving a fine sheet of lace. Smells of sweet hops mixed with some hops and subtle light fruits. Tastes of more sweet malts, a little honey, and a faint bit of spice. Hops aren't really noticeable, but the brew remains fairly tasty. Goes down easy and is well carbonated.

Honey sweet maltiness with a slight floral hop edge. Mouthfeel is snappy, this is where the hops are most noticeable. Maybe just the slightest bit of adjunct taste, I mean I can't say for sure if they are using adjuncts but there is a slight corny sweetness to this beer. I'm not saying its bad but it's a taste that I am not all that used to tasting. There is a slight spiciness here as well and covers up just a bit, the corny sweetness in this beer.

Saint Arnold boasts being the oldest micro-brewery in Texas, and they sold me on that slogan and the fact that there was a unique flavor in the Lawn Mower Ale. It seems as a summer ale, however, the flavor doesn't come out that easy. It is a very hard beer to drink and is very hoppy. I really enjoy hoppy beers, however, in beer, you are supposed to judge a book by its cover. If it says it's a summer beer, be a little lighter. Not a good choice.

The aroma is a mix of sweet grain and grassy notes with hints of peach and lemon. The taste has a lightly sweet grain character to it and finishes with a hint of bitterness that just manages to tickle the back of my throat. This beer is really quite light on the palate, quite thirst quenching and simple; with a name like Lawnmower that is probably the point. This is actually a pretty good example of the style; it is lightly fruity (lemon & pear) with a bit of herbal hop notes (some flower nectar type thing going on) and a light bitterness as well as some sweet grain notes.

Not that I'd know leaving in a building for 15 years, but I use to have to mow 2.5 acres as a youngster, and nothing sucked more then 3 hours of moving, and this stuff would've hit the spot just fine as a finisher as I always needed to hose of the clipping stuck to my body.","tavernjef","May 10, 2005"

Sweet, grainy pilsner malt and mildly spicy hops, w/ a hint of cooked sweet corn DMS. Lightly vegetal, but otherwise very tame and clean aromawise. Bready sweetness upfront thins somewhat and becomes sugary mid palate, partially due to the paltry hopping. Mild notes of grain husk emerge late concomitantly with a subdued herbal hop flavor. Lightly bodied, but with token dextrins facilitating an decently crisp mouthfeel. Finishes clean, with residual sweetness briefly lingering. Not a European pilsner and hopefully not intended to be. Lawn Mower is a somewhat superior rendition of the insipid American lager. It succeeds well at its goal of forgettable, innocuous quaffability.
