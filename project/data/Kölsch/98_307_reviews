"like this summer beer not to much citrus"

"Light, but not quite as good as some of the other summer brews i've tried."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Fairly harsh up front, the carbonation looks to strip your tastebuds off your tongue. Not like a West Coast IPA but still pretty aggressive. Not what I want in a summer style, that's for sure."

"Very good light-bodied ale with a crisp smooth finish."
"I grabbed two cases of beer today one being boulder mojo which I had before and another being harpoon friday full fridge variety pack. I want to try the shandy. I only had it in the fridge for about 40 minutes so I didn't want to try something unfamiliar and it be too warm. Tried harpoon summer beer its light crisp and refreshing :)"
""
""
""
""
""
"O - been a while since I've had this one and I'm glad I revisited it."
""
"Harpoon Summer Beer. What a good one. I have drank a lot of these. They are refreshing and tasty. Available in bottles and cans, it is a great go-to beer for the beach, the lake, the park, the backyard, cooking in the kitchen, watching Popeye in the living room, sneaking into the movies, walking around town, getting drunk in a fancy restaurant, drinking in a dive bar, playing foosball, hiding out in a treehouse, camping in the middle of nowhere, anywhere. Great beer. Summer is a good season overall too."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This beer stacks up well against the BJCP guidelines for Koelsch, but is rather uninspiring. I'm not sure why Koelsch is somewhat universal for ""summer beer"" in the US- while it is certainly a light style, the strange astringency found in most US-produced versions does not make it the most refreshing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This is a great beer to have on a warm summer afternoon after mowing a few acres or doing some yard work. Really refreshing and definitely not heavy on the palate. I like it....a lot. A very nice example of the style."
""
""
""
"Not a bad beer; hoppy and slightly bitter with fruit and wheat overtones. I think it looked like a light lager but I'm not sure since the restaurant was really dark. Not a bad beer and I'll maybe give it a shot if I come across it again but it isn't my favorite."
""
"O - This is not really my cup of tea, but I can see this being powerfully refreshing after having been out in the hot sun. As a summer beer, I believe it accomplishes what it sets out to be. Not a earth-shattering offering, but solid as a light easy to drink summer offering."

"O: Surprised. I'm a tough critic of summer beers because they are usually lacking too much substance for me or are overpowered by citrus and fruit flavors. Not my thing. This is actually a beer I'd want to drink in the summer. Not necessarily bursting with flavor, but very light, crisp, and easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
"Pale gold in color, lots of bubbles and a decent white frothy head. The body is semi-transparent. There’s a great deal maltiness up front as I smell it, with lemon peel and orange rind in the background. Taste is very similar to a classic pilsner, except for some more pronounced herbal and spicy qualities to the hops. Low bitterness, crackery malt on the tongue, dry grass, but flavours do not linger. The finish is fairly dry. Overall it’s not a bad thirst-quencher for the warmer months, but it doesn’t have any one quality that makes it stand out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Nothing too great here. It’s a little too bitter with a bit too much thickness for the style, which makes it not as refreshing as I would have hoped."
""
""
"This beer is average but fails in the summer beer category, there are simply just better summer beers out there."
""
""
""
""
"A very good summer beer that I would pack in the cooler heading to the beach, golf course, etc. Good beer."
""
""
""
"The taste has a decent upfront pale malt sweetness and not so much like the grains of a typical Kolsch. The sweetness is what surprises me the most and it results in an unique approach to the style."
""
"Appearance: Pours a sizable and fluffy head. Some lacing lingers with a scent of bread, grain, and hops. A lot of people rave about the taste of this one, and my guess is that many of them are simply happy to find a ""summer"" beer without the typical flavors (fruit, wheat, yeast, etc.) and instead a beer with some dryness. Other than for the fact that it is a bit more thin than beers one might drink in the autumn months, there's nothing special here, and certainly nothing that makes me think this is an ideal beer to consume during warm summer months. Yes, it's ""crisp"" and on the lighter side, but it's just not that interesting. A decent example of a Kolsch and a decent summer beer--but not something I would consider purchasing again at $9.49/six pack."
""
""
"Overall, not bad. Doesn't hold a candle to any German Kolsch, and pales compared to many domestics as well, but it is about a drinkable brew, and not a label. I'd have this again."
"O: This is the best beer of the Kolsch or summer light beer style I have tasted from an American brewer. Totally lives up to Harpoon name. I'm going back for a case. This is a summer beer hop heads could enjoy. Sessionable!"
""
"notes: just what the doctor ordered, light, refreshing, easy to drink, a perfect Summer beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: another fine option among the summer seasonals. it's got plenty of taste and enough character to make it well worth working through a six-pack. it's definitely a good choice for beating the heat. i like some of my Texas kolsch options a bit better, but there's nothing wrong with this brew -- and if you can find it super fresh, my bet is you'll love it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Scent is slightly sweet and grapefruit-like. Poured bright yellow body, small very short-lasting white head. Spotty lacing on glass. Taste is citrus and wheat with a slight hop bite at the end. Crisp , refreshing, exactly as on the label; i.e. a summer beer!"

"O - It was over 90 out when I got home from work and popped this one open. I was pleasantly surprised. The flavor, feel, and even appearance, which remained nicely carbonated all the way down were exactly what I needed. I only wish I had another one. Highly recommend!"

"While not my favorite summer seasonal, this is most definitely enjoyable and drinkable. If you're generally a pilsner drinker during the summer months and need a more ""ale-ly"" counterpart, check out Harpoon Summer Beer."

""
""
"Overall - lacks the taste that I would prefer from a beer like this. the notes are good, but need some punch behind them. I know that this beer should not be oozing with flavor, but you can do better than this. Still, not a bad beer, worth a go."
""
"O - Not my preference for a summer seasonal, but it is a pretty good representation of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste mirrors the smell. Less soft and more astringent than a traditional Kölsch. Higher hop bitterness. Good body and carbonation."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 8/19/2012. Pours a lightly cloudy golden straw color with a nice 1-2 finger fluffy white head with nice retention, that reduces to a good cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of pear, bread, lemon, cracker, herbal, grass, floral, light pepper, and earthy spiciness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance, but they are quite muted. Taste of lemon zest, pear, bread, cracker, herbal, floral, grass, light pepper, and earthy spiciness. Light spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of pear, lemon, bread, herbal, grass, and pepper on the finish for a short bit. Nice balance of flavors, with a good malt/hop balance; a touch watered down; zero cloying flavors after the finish as expected. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a nice kolsch. Nice flavor balance and very smooth to drink. A pleasantly enjoyable offering."

"Overall a nondescript, benign beer"
""
"When i poured this beer, it has a golden color body with a small head that quickly dissapeared. The smell of lemon with some malt to it, not very strong though. The taste has a faint lemon taste upfront followed by a nice peppery flavor on the back of the tongue. The mouthfeel is very nice and smooth, not to overly carbonated, over all this is a average Kolsch, but a nice and easy drinking one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A crystal clear light yellow with a dense, white head that falls off rather quickly. The nose is rather nondescript but entirely serviceable. Light doughy malt, mild lemony hops, maybe a touch of fruity yeast character? While all the right flavor notes are present, this just doesn't have the right combination. This is mirrored on the palate, where the same flavors but the same lack of definition is present, along with a faint buttery note. Light in body, crisply carbonated and dry and refreshing on the finish, this beer is nice, worthy even, but not all that it could be. Recommended."
""
"O: An enjoyable beer that is a make up of the German style Kolsch. More flavorful than a lot of summer beers I have had. Harpoon is something special out of Boston and comes out with a quality beer every time!"
""
""
""
""
"O: Not a bad summer seasonal, very easy drinking and makes for a good beer to pair with hot weather and bbq."
"o - goes down easy, but i have definitely had more enjoyable examples of the style. will pass on this in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste carries some lemon as well as fruitiness. Some biscuit and malt present as well. Mouth feel is fairly crisp and refreshing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: from the first time I tried the Harpoon Summer Beer this summer, it is one of my favorite ""summer"" styles to drink. It has a great balance between complex and interesting taste and that refreshing kick that we all love on a hot day. Just a great beer to session during these absurdly hot summer days."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a pretty good beer. There's a fruity lemony aspect to this beer that sets it a bit above the average ""summer beer"". Worth checking out if you want something light."
""
""
""
""
""
"12oz. can served in a standard pint. Pours a bright, straw gold with a translucent clarity and a one inch, bright white head that slowly recedes into a solid, soapy slick. Some thin clusters of lacing are evident during the tasting. Nose is very clean - just the merest suggestion of wheat and citrus. Taste reveals light toasted wheat, mild citrus notes and a slight buttery quality that nicely intermingles before culminating in a fairly clean finish. Mouthfeel is light in body with a an even carbonation that adds just a little additional depth to the consistency. Overall, I know this may not be the best, most style consistent Kolsch out there, but I love this beer in the summer and really think the canned version is far superior to the bottle. This is one of my summer staples."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: one of my absolute favorite summer brews especially out of the can, it really just screams summer to me, infinitely sessionable and delicious"
""
"OVERALL: This is a very solid summer beer from Harpoon, perfect for the hot summer days and drinking in mass quantities. Mellow, easy drinking beer, and would go just fine with steak and shrimp fajitas."
""
""
""

"Nice little summer beer. Harpoon Summer Kolsch, I'll remember you for next year. 4.0"

"(originally reviewed: 06-28-2011)"
"This is a very refreshing, easy drinking, clean, crisp, summer beer. It's a well brewed Kolsch that drinks nicely on these hot summer days. I'll definitely have another."
""
""
""
" The flavor is very refreshing and balanced in the best way possible. The taste has a nice floral hop which is almost tea-like in the foreground with slight toasted malt presence with some gentle sweet elements that move more toward yeast flavors which seem like light grape or golden pear in the finish with some of the herbal hops and spice flavors lingering after the swallow. This is a good beer to call Summer beer, it is interesting, flavorful and quaffable, yet not an ideal Kolsch in the traditional sense. It is a very good American interpretation of the style. I will certainly have to find this on tap sometime soon."

"A perfect summer beer for a hot summer day!"

"Feel’s just what it should be: refreshing and not too sweet. It’s got a nice level of carbonation. Overall this beer is just what I’d hoped for: crisp, clean and refreshing; it’s got a very fresh taste to boot. Great sessioner and a great effort from Harpoon."

""

""

"O: this is actually a very good summer beer. I've had several of these before I decided to give a it a review so I could be as fair as possible. I would definitely have this again. I wasn't actually expecting it to be this good. This may be my favorite by Harpoon. Well done!"

"O - I wasn't expecting much out of this beer, but I am a lemon fan so I kind of like it. It is refreshing, and would probably be even better on a hot summer day."

"Overall, this is a fantastic beer. From now on, this will be a summertime staple for me. I just wish I'd discovered it earlier in the season."
"A light bodied beer with some noticeable carbonation and a light dry citrusy aftertaste. Another one of those beer that a six pack could disappear pretty quick on a hot summers day."
"O-A decent summer beer, light and sessionable. Just was glad that the lemon did not taste artificial, like other Harpoon Beers. I'm talking to you Crystal Wheat."
"Overall-a very successful Kolsch, easy to drink. All the factors add up to a success and I would drink this again. A great first try for this beer style."
"O: Not too bad but not going to medal too much with this guy. A little warming helps this guy out some but don't expect a lot and you won't be disappointed."
"M. Lightbodied, pleasant, very sessionable. The type of beer for a midday in summer."
"Pours thin pale yellow with a small bubbly head that slimes on the glass, looks very Kolsch-y. Grainy, floral, nice malt characters, lemony with a nice touch of spice on the nose. Nice rich buttery malt taste with citrus blend and a grainy finish. Light and sticky on the feel, bitter, crisp, refreshing. Overall this was a decent beer that would be worth buying for a long day in the sun."
"O- While not my favorite style, this is a solid beer. Recommended if you like the style, or are looking for a good summer beer."
"Overall I would happy buy this again since it's not only cheap (around 10 bucks a sixer) but very drinkable. A case might even be cheaper so I may need to check pricing."
"D: A pretty good summer beer that is ok to serve to newbies to the craft beer scene yet drinkable for all who look for a easy drinking summer beer on a hot day."
"O: I just.. don't like Kölsches. Not recommended."
"O: To be fair, Kölsch is one of my least favourite styles. Strong for the style, and not the worst example I've consumed...arguably better than many found in Köln. Still, I will not have again. Not recommended. Still, drinkable, especially on a hot day...maybe. It is night-time and not that warm. I'm drain-pouring it."
"Beer poured very bright and lively into my pint glass. Color was a clear pale yellow. Medium white head. Smell was intriguing. Mildly sweet with just a touch of grassy hops and a hint of white grape juice. The taste was mildly sweet with medium hop bitterness. Again, a touch of fruitiness. Finish is grassy hops. The only negative was a very slight metallic taste on the late finish. Mouthfeel was lively with medium carbonation. Light-to-medium body. Overall, a nice beer. Light and tasty with a nice blend of sweetness and bitterness. Great with light summer fare."
"This is a very refreshing brew. I love how it can be light and refreshing while maintaining character and depth of flavor. This is canned sunshine."
"This has become a summer regular for me."
"O- I try tailor my reviews to be somewhat to style, and this is what I've done here. While not an overall great beer in my eyes in terms of enjoyment, it is great for what it is: A light, crisp, refreshing summer beer. The heat index in Nashville today is 107, and this is just what the doctor ordered."
"Overall: I was excited about this one up until the taste. It was a little watered down for me. Not so much bad tasting as the grain and malt with lemon notes were solid in the aftertaste, the typical summer ale taste, and was not very bitter and very refreshing."
"Nice, refreshing beer here. Nothing earth-shattering, but flavorful and good for a hot summer day. It actually may be a little heavy for the style, and the alcohol content (while not detectable) is definitely a little on the high side and hurts the drinkability. Still, a decent choice for a summer quaffer. Recommended."
"Overall – This beer reminded me a little bit of the Yella Pils by Oskar Blues. It is definitely one of the better summer beers I've had and is extremely drinkable. I'm happy I tried it and I would buy it again."
"T- excellent refreshing qualities and light body makes an excellent Summer quencher. Flavour profile is simple but kolsch was never meant to be complex.'very good."
"O- There is really nothing special with this beer. A average kolsch in a land of bland kolsch styles. Sorry Harpoon but this is average and therefore not seeking this one out again anytime soon."
"overall a decent summer drinker; inoffensive and refreshing, but won't overwhelm you with flavor."
"Crystal clear straw/lemon yellow with a thin cap of bright white foam. Good head retention, lots of streaky lacing. Looks nice. The aroma was a bit fruity, almost entirely like green grapes, but with mild malts underneath and a faint hop spiciness. Moderate to low bitterness that played nicely against the malty flavours. Spicy hops and very mild grape flavour. Light to medium bodied with average carbonation, off-dry, decent texture. Pretty tasty for a summertime beer."
"Clear and yellow. A couple fingers of soapy head. A lot of bubbles up the sides of the glass. A slight sour lemon nose with a pale malt backing. Taste is a lot of the pale, crisp malt with some lemon zest and noble hops. Body is light and refreshing at first but there is a lingering sour lemon bitterness."
"Drinkability: All in all, a decent beer for the style and a great summer seasonal. Worth a shot, if you can find it."
"O - This is a great summer beer. Tasty, light, and extremely portable. Its sold in 6 packs, as well as 12 packs in cans. This will be my go to summer beer for any parties/outside events."
"Golden beer with a fluffy head that dissolves quickly. Crisp, sweet citrus aroma with some malty notes. Sweet lemon and crisp grass flavors. This would be a great one to drink on a sweaty summer day. It hits the spot just like a cold glass of lemonade."
"Overall - this isnt a ride home and tell dad kind of beer, but it offers a very good overall taste and light fare. could easily drink a few dozen of these just based on how fresh it is."
"Mouthfeel: Nicely carbonated smooth and crisp"
"Pretty plain jane, but refreshing summer beer. Its a pale yellow with creamy white head that fades fast but leaves nice lace. The smell is bready with faint floral and lemon notes. The taste follows the nose with bready, cracker like malts followed with a touch of floral and lemon zest. Watery, smooth, crisp, refreshing. Great summer beer. Very easy to drink."
"Overall, a little disappointed, but still not bad. Nice for summer, which is their goal, right?"
"D - Very drinkable. Smooth and refreshing. Everything seems balanced enough. There seems to be a bit too much bready flavor that knocks off the balance a bit."
"Overall, I wouldn't buy this one again. There is not much going on in this beer. Not impressive at all. Which is not what a well done Kolsch should be imo."
"Overall, this is one of the better ""summer"" beers I've tasted. I may actually get these next time I drink outside."
"D- Moderate. Its a nice summer beer and I would love it at a barbeque. But it pales in comparison to its crosstown rival in Sam Adams Summer ale"
"O: The beer is easy to drink, refreshing and quite sessionable given its low alcohol content."
"D: A very drinkable beer, this is most certainly a lawnmower beer. Could see myself drinking these all afternoon, no problem"
"D- Easy to drink for sure just there's not anything really going on here."
"Served in a tulip glass. Pours a very clear light yellow color with a nice, long-lasting white head that leaves just a bit of lacing as it goes down. The nose is pretty clean with just a slight bit of grain, mild fruit, and a hint of citrus. The taste is mostly grain but there is a bit of light lemon and orange. Clean and crisp, this drinks pretty well but doesn't hit on the subtle complexities of the better versions of this style."
"Linger: 2"
"This is an excellent summer brew. I'm going to go clear out the stock of my local store tomorrow since it's still going over 90 degrees here in Florida."
"Drink well my friends"
"Great drinkability, a very good take on a under appreciated style"
"Had this beer out of the bottle and then a couple poured into an oversized wine glass; maybe it's not the appropriate glassware but its a cool glass. Pale straw yellow; not quite golden as I've seen in other kolsch. Smells of yeast, citrus and a hint of household cleaner. The taste is what I would describe as ""clean."" Maybe this comes from the idea that it smells like cleaning product but the fruity taste dominates. There might be some hop bite on the back end of a swig but it really is dulled. Very refreshing but not substantial. Pleasing, but not memorable. Mouthfeel and drinkability are very good; lots of carbonation and the 5.5% abv (which is a bit more than your typical summer beer I guess) doesn't really set in till you've had a number of these brews."
"Probably one of my favorite lighter summer beers. One to enjoy if you are going to be having quite a few over a long period of time. A good day drinking beer as well as it won't fill you up or put you down early."
"A clear, bright golden color with a very good sized frothy white head that clings solidly to lace the glass nicely as you go. The nose detects crisp citrus wheat and tart yeast. Not bad for the style. The flavor brings on a bit of a malty yeast and more of that citrus wheat crispness. Although it is relatively light and refreshing as one would hope and expect, I am very pleasantly surprised by the full feel that washes over the tongue, frothy and sort of stick to your ribs as summer ales go. It has a little bite of tartness and settles pretty nicely into a bready mouthful with lemon-herbal hop highlights. Not sweet, but highly drinkable as one might hope. Not always my favorite style, but this is a favorable acquaintance. Very sessionable in my book."
"D - A nice representation of the style. Light and refreshing. A good summertime beer."
"Pours light yellow with a very white head. Not much retention or lacing. Aroma is pleasant. Pretty strong lemon, grass, hay and pine notes. Taste follows, but is much weaker than the aroma. Very light, grassy flavor. A bit of lemon, grain and sweet malt as you get into the beer. Some grassy and pine hops, but nothing major. Very light and crisp mouthfeel."
"Light golden color, with no apparent head. The aromas were of appropriately mild for a beer this style and tended toward yeasts and grains. Likewise, the flavors were mild yeasty and grainy, with decent carbonation, making for a very refreshing drink. A very enjoyable and drinkable beer in this style."
"Taste is pretty simple, which I can't really fault it for by style. Starts citrusy, with mildly tart lemon leading the way and dominating the flavor profile of this beer. Has a good grainy profile on the back, along with a lightly hopped bitterness that finishes the beer off pretty cleanly. A little grain hangs around. Refreshing and drinkable. Nothing fancy, but hardly anything with ""Summer"" in the title ever is really meant to be. This would be very good on a hot day."
"My father had a pint of the same brew from a tap pour at the same time that I was drinking my casked version. It was very interesting to compare them side-by-side. The tapped brew was, predictably, more carbonated, clear and crisp. The flavors were more sharp and identifiable, more lemon and skunk, compared to the rounded and smooth cask flavors. I know that's what's supposed to happen, but it was really cool to experience it myself so clearly."
"I felt insulted with this one. I'm not one to be snooty about my beers, so that says something. It made me realize there's a problem with the perception of what a summer beer should be. Just because it's summer does it mean we need watery, flavorless beers to drink after mowing the lawn. If I want water, then I'll drink water. IMO this beer has no personality and does no justice to the kolsch style."
"M- Light body with moderate carbonation and a slight bitter dry finish."
"Really nice light summer beer that goes down very easy and is extremely light; flows down easy and is very refreshing, a great session beer. Could drink these all night."
"It's pretty drinkable, but I wasn't a huge fan, something about just didn't make me want to grab another. Perhaps I will try another Kölsch, except maybe this time from Germany."
"Very nice summer beer. Tasty, very drinkable. One of the lighter summer brews I have come across, but certainly flavorful."
"Pours ultra-clear light golden with a tall, white head that soon receds and laces down the glass. Nice carbonation trails. Smell is decent; toasty malts with a hint of bitters. Taste starts off with a bit of mineral, but eases into that good kolsch mix of sweet, clean malts and a good dash of noble hops. Good complexity and mouthfeel. Definitely carbed well, and sits dry and well for another taste. Easy to drink. Very nice beer."
"Thanks to woodychandler for the trade.Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts and hops, slightly sweet. Taste is crisp, a bit of hops and grains. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this makes for a good quality beer."
"Pours a clear pale yellow. 1 inch head dissipates quickly into a nice lacing. Looks like a pale Lager, but once it hits the nose and tongue you know it's something different. Citrus on the nose, somewhat bready too. Hops are very minimal. Sweet on the tongue, now you know you're drinking an Ale instead, with a very low IBU. Bitterness is very subtle, almost invisible. Very crisp finish. Extremely Drinkable. Overall a very nice example of a Kolsch."
"12oz bottle purchased as part of a 12-pack at Shaw's in Windham, NH. Bottle says ""Best By 7-15-10"". Not a big seller at this store, methinks. Pours a straw-yellow body with nearly an inch of white-ish head. Smells fruity - lemon in particular comes to mind - with some spice, vanilla, and floral notes. Lemon and pulp hit the palate initially, with some restrained floral and spice notes and a mostly clean finish. Light and effervescent in nature - an easy drinker for sure on a 90+ degree day like today. A great summer seasonal - simple and balanced but with a little complexity to keep things interesting. Drinkable but not boring. Stands out among the American Pale Wheat Ales and Blonde Ales that flood the market this time of year."
"D- I could drink this beer all the time it never disappoints, it is very enjoyable and i wish this beer was year around like the fellows who brews it can get it, makes me want to move there all jokes aside, let me know if there hiring!"
"D- light, refreshing, flavorful without being overbearing, fruity without the fruit. smells nice and tastes good enough to call it enjoyable. feel is definitely the low point with this one but the other qualities pick up the slack making this one damn drinkable (and decent example of a) kolsch."
"Taste has a snappy, crisp grain flavor and I would not be surprised if there was a little bit of wheat in here. Yeast is pretty nice for the style and adds some much needed depth. Hop bitterness finally makes an appearance and even leaves a decent grassy lingering effect. Certainly won't challenge for best kolsch, but is a pretty good summer seasonal and infinitely better than the atrocity that is Harpoon's Crystal Wheat."
"D- Overall a pretty solid beer. Definitely up there on the summer seasonals."
"super drinkable and refreshing, especially out of the can it's a great beer to take with ya on all your outdoor summer adventures!"
"My initial pour garnered me a finger of bone-white head with excellent retention. Color was like liquid sunshine - a bright golden yellow with NE-plus quality clarity. Man, if you are going to make a lager-style beer, which Kolsch is, it had better have this kind of clarity. Nose had a grassy hoppiness, just right for the style. Mouthfeel was medium with a very grassy taste on the tongue. Finish was bone-dry, just the way I like my Kolschs. Phew! Gad, but this was extra dry, like ginger ale or antiperspirant. Now, I'm starting to sweat, in an odd turn of events. More? Dang right! Cooler? Heck, yes! This was really, really good in a way that the bottled version CANnot match. I love this beer."
"Would I buy more of it? - yes, I definitely will be getting a 12-pack for this weekend's camping trip up in Vermont."
"I love to take this one out onto the porch with a good book about mid-day. Be careful though, the smoothness allows it to creep up on you, and make you want way more than you need to have! Enjoy!"
"D- really drinkable. Its got a nice flavor and is a good summer sipper. Not something for hopheads, but there is no hint of alcohol and you could put a bunch back on a fine summer day."
"A decent example of the style. Pale yellow with a frothy white head, not much lace. I haven't much to say about the appearance other than it looks very much like a macro lager with a better retaining head. Sweet grains and a musky hoppiness with a touch of earth. Taste gives the same but a bit more pronounced and maybe a hint of lemon as well. Pretty good."
"Harpoon Summer does a great job for the season, especially now that they are in cans. The 12 pack didn't last long in the fridge, and I'll probably pick up another one sometime this summer."
"Pours a clear pale gold with a large super-frothy white head on top. Great retention; left some light globs of lace behind. Scents of tart lemon zest, fresh-cut grass, and whiffs of cheap pine-scent. Not bad. The body is pretty refreshing and crisp. It's got some thin notes to it, but overall, decent body. The flavors are pretty mellow and tame. Some grassy notes, a little citrus, a light hop finish. This was a very refreshing, simple beer. I could see this being a regular this summer."
"Feel is smooth and stylistic"
"Summer is here, no better time to imbibe summer brews, picked up a six of this at TW, let's give it a whirl. Popping the top yields a dry malty smell slightly floral in a garden sort of way. Pours into a pint glass it yields a bright yellow colour with a big foamy multi size bubble head with a creamy top. Taste is slightly citrusy,l bittersweet and very dry. What bitterness there is, is in the finish, it is more puckering then bitter and finishes super dry. This is a good brew for summer, excepting for the dry finish which really detracts from being a good thirst quencher. Good brew but I wouldn't call it summer per se. I'd brew it year round and call it a Kolsch."
"12 ounce bottle, from a friends 12 bottle sampler box. Best by dating etched onto the neck of the bottle. Pours very clear and very pale. Moderate height on the near white head, that leaves just a few bits of spotty fine lace. Grassy nose of lite hops. Crisp brew, with some lime, more grassy hops and a moderately zesty finish. Lite and refreshing, nothing astonishing but a decent brew for a warm summer's day."
"Not that I don't like this beer. I actually think it can grow on me. I also never had this style before."
"The taste is nice and refreshing because it has a nice medium hop bitterness and a dry finish. The mouthfeel is light and easy drinking. My first overall impression was that it isn't anything special, but its slowly growing on me as I finish the glass."
"D: Sure, its easy to drink, but I'm not gonna be having this beer again. There's absolutely no substance here, no taste, no nose, and the feel is as thin as water. Don't waste your time with this one."
"In an effort to rate beer by style, I must confess that this is not my favorite style. With that being said, I will say that this is a pretty enjoyable beer. It is light, pale yellow with a mellow flavor. I could see a pitcher of this beer with a plate of hot wings. It is light and almost fruity. A thirst quencher possibly."
"--Best way to enjoy is with oysters, clams, lobster...you get the picture."
"Harpoon Summer Beer poured yellow, with a decent size head. It had a slightly bitter smell, and there were also citrus smells present as well. It taste refreshing, it was kinda of hoppy, and had a lemon taste. It was very easy to drink, and overall not bad, very similair to other Harpoon beers."
"Straw golden color, clear, thin white head. Couldn't agree more with recent reviews that said it looks like a macro. This beer is only moderately better than macros. Faint hops, lemon, grass smell and taste. Too watery for my liking even for a summer. Easy to drink but no reason to drink much of these."
"Light yellow colored beer with a slowly fading head.Looks like a macro.Aroma is faint citrus.Taste is also citrus and malts.Very simple light and refreshing just like a summer ale should be.I would recommend especially in the summer months.I also would purchase again in the summer months."
"1/2 head some lacing very clear pale amber gold color. Not much in the smell, some citrus fruits and hops. Same with the taste, a little too watery, not very full flavored. reminds me of some macros. This beer didnt impress me, theres a lot of beeter summer beers out there to get."
"D: Good drink ability, but kind of boring for my tastes."
"This beer pours a clean, clear straw yellow with a decent sized white head. Aroma is a basic malt lager scent. The taste is quite good; clean, crisp malt flavor, with a hint of bitterness and hops. Fairly dry tasting, this beer drinks very easily; better than many of the summer macro lagers so frequently offered up a barbeques and picnics."
"Drinkability... well I could probably sit around and drink quite a few of these on a hot summer day. Not sure that I would, though, assuming other selections were available. Next summer if I see it around, I'll probably buy it. But it's not in any danger of becoming a regular in my rotation, probably because I'm not a huge fan of the style to begin with. Bottom line, if you enjoy a Kolsch on a hot summer day, this one will scratch you where you itch."
"Mouth feel is light and crisp with prickly carbonation. Overall, a decent beer that I would drink on a hot day outside, thus the name ""summer beer"" i would assume."
"This beers pours a nice golden color with a smallish head to it that kind of sticks around along with a decent amount of lacing to it. Not a great smell to it, get almost an adjunct-lager sort of smell to this one. Taste is much better though, nice mouthfeel and body to this one. Nothing too crazy in the flavor department, just some slight hop crispiness and a bit of some lemon/citrus zest in there. Not of the most exciting styles out there but definitely better than the average summer seasonal out there."
"Actually, a very good american representation of a Kolsch. Perfect summer beer as well. One of my favorites sampled @ harpoon."
"This beer poured a light golden color with a single-finger head and some visible carbonation. The smell is some light with a solid malt background. The taste starts off with some sweet malt that is countered well by the grassy hops. The mouthfeel is slightly watery with some moderate carbonation. Kölshes are an excellent choice to market as a ""summer beer"" and Harpoon's made a solid one that's great on a hot day."
"Surprisingly good, and a well-crafted Kolsch."
"D_A nice light bodied Kolsch. Not quite as good as those from Koln but good to have on a summer day"
"They got the name of this one right. It is a great summer beer that you can drink all day long. It's not earth shattering, but it has just enough going for it to keep you interested."
"Pours a clear lemon yellow with a full inch head, very inviting. Smell is malty with a a grape-like nose also. Taste is a very nice light malt with a smooth quality and a continuation of the grape notes. Mouthfeel is smooth, but with a nice crisp finish. Very easy on the drinkability scale...easily a two brew session."
"Single left over from a tasting, yay for free stuff. Pours a clear and filtered light golden, almost yellow. Decent amount of head and retention. Doesn't really smell like much, though. Some pale malt, a touch of hop snap. Taste is a very clean summer beer. Slightly malty, slightly dry. A bit of bite on it from hops, more than you'd think given the appearance. Decent mouthfeel for something so light, and very drinkable for the summer months. A step above the standard wheat beer everyone does for the summer, if nothing spectacular."
"D. A summer beer, I could drink this on a hot summer day, as a matter of fact I did. It was pretty refreshing, quenching although I thought it was slightly thin."
"all in all a decent, sessionable beer for when under the sun. not my case right now."
"This is an amazingly clear golden, the foam stands around forever , quite impressive , this is my first kolch and I like what I see. The smell is soft lemon zest and other grains coming from a foamy head that sticks for a while. Tastes really refreshing and pounds away at the grains in this one although the slight lemon taste comes through a bit at the beginning. MF is very light just like a lager or a light one , eqyally crisp leaving a very very dry mouth taste , great to drink one after another leaving great drinkability!"
"Clear golden with a huge airy white head that melts into soft peaks leaving blobs of lace on the glass. Lemon zest, appleskin and toast make up the nose on this one. Light and fruity flavors with dry crackers, a touch of grape must and champagne yeastiness. Finishes dry. Light bodied with crisp carbonation. A decent summer brew."
"D: This is an easy drinking summer offering. Nice flavor and very refreshing."
"Sweet malts followed by a slight sour aroma as well. The flavor is light and crisp nicely balanced between the malts and hops in the brew. Great carbonation and very refreshing in you mouth It very easy to drink and one hell of a summer brew"
"HV"
"Drinkability is a little too awkard for my taste. Not really a beer I would want a session of."
"A pretty simple beer that is refreshing and good to have around during summer time."
"Recommended"
"d- very drinkable, perfect summer beer, i'd buy a case of this stuff, very tasty."
"Pours a clear and bright sunshine yellow. Great two finger head after the pour. Nice stickage after each sip on the indside of the glass. Just a littl bit of grass and some mild toasted malts. The taste starts of dry and just a faint malt sweetness. The hops add some eaty notes to the middle of the palate. Very light fruits towards the end of the palate. This is a nicely carbonated and crisp kolsch. Insanely drinkable. Must try on tap."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable and a pretty good kolsch. Nice for a summer beer. It's a good brew that I would certainly revisit."
"D) Nice light summer beer. Good for hot days and chilling."
"A solid summer session brew."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. Not the summer seasonal I'd turn to. Covers all the bases of the summer seasonal style. Great for a party - probably a crowd pleaser."
"Not bad overall, just not exactly what I would look for in a lawnmower beer."
"D - Very drinkable and refreshing. Good beer for the beach."
"Pours a clear, clean, golden hue. Very little head if any and just a ring of lacing hangs around. Aroma is not strong but there is a bit of straw and sweetness. Taste is short and sweet, sort of. Starts of with some malt tartness but finishes with some type of fruit on the back of the tongue. Very clean and somewhat refreshing. I didn't have high hopes for this but a good summer beer, go figure."
"Pours a light gold body with decent head that dies quickly. Smell is marginal dark fruits/floral hops and some minor sweet malts. Has a rather non-decript fruit taste and is somewhat slick and watery w/ a light body. Also some residual sweetness from the malts make it go down easy. An easy drinker on a hot day...nothing more."
"Light, highly drinkable, and refreshing beer. A BJCP commercial example."
"Verdict: Harpoon's Summer Beer is a straight-forward, light, and easy-drinking beer that makes for a great Summer seasonal. If you had told me this was a Pilsener, I don't think I would have questioned you, but that's rather acceptable for Kölsches."
"D- Excellent. Overall Harpoon nailed the style."
"Overall, I've never had a really light beer before designed to be consumed in large quantities that didn't taste like crap. Harpoon accomplished the goal of making a highly drinkable summer session beer. Just don't expect great flavor. The Sam Adams Summer Ale is definitely preferable IMO."
"D- It's an ok representation of the style, but definitely not as good as some of the ones I had in Germany. Worth trying but I probably wouldn't get any more."
"Can see why this is sometimes compared to macro as previously stated in a couple of other reviews. But this is more what they should taste like but they don't. Another good beer from Harpoon."
"This one fine kolsch. Another top notch brew for the hot summer months."
"Flavor is okay, a little more hoppy and less malty than other Kölsches. Bit of lemon. Not enough nutty or biscuity malt flavor, but I like the bitterness and okay hop flavor, which is reminiscent of a weak Harpoon IPA. Needs more body, pretty light, carbonation not over the top. Overall it's inoffensive and light, so drinkability is high."
"D..Not bad for a summer beer. A few cold bottles/glasses would be nice on a warm day, but other than that, I find this a somewhat average offering from Harpoon."
"D: Highly drinkable but if I'm drinking a Kolsch I prefer the Saint Arnold Lawnmower."
"D: A very nice summer seasonal from Harpoon. This would be easy to drink several of on a hot summer evening. Not necessarily fantastic, but very well-executed."
"Pretty drinkable, one of my favorite offerings from harpoon for sure."
"D - Easy to drink, very clean light flavors."
"D- This is a pretty decent beer that would probably be perfect straight out of the bottle during a tailgating/outdoor event. Worth a shot."
"Tastes like it smells with crisp light grain and lemony noble hop zest. Buttery Harpoon yeast all over. A refreshing summer beer."
"D: A pretty good thirst-quencher. I'm glad I decided to give this a try."
"This beer is light and refreshing. A good summer beer and would pair well with a good hamburger."
"drinkability is through the roof. could drink 12 of these on my own on a nice summer afternoon."
"Nice effort by Harpoon."
"Drinkability: Overall, very drinkable, crisp, refreshing beer. It is prefect for those hot summer days so it definitely lives up to it's title."
"6/4/7/3/14 (3.4/5)"
"D: Not my cup of tea."
"Feels a bit dry, but nice body overall. It's actually a beer better than the sum of its parts. It's a good, summery kolsch."
"D - A decent brew. I don't at all care for the weird late palate flavor, so this brew loses some points for that. All in all easy to drink with a decent amount of flavor, if somewhat attenuated."
"Harpoon Summer Beer pours a very clear pale yellow with a white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is very grainy with a hint of lemon. The flavor is pleasantly grainy with a bit of bitterness, but no real hop flavor. There is a hint of citrus, but it's mild. Pleasant and easy to drink."
"D- Hey, it's a summer beer. Very drinkable."
"Mouthfeel has more heft than your traditional kolsch. Very drinkable and the best I've had from Harpoon."
"Finally a pretty good summer beer. I have found a few that I liked but for the most part they seem to be rather bland. Nice to see this one actually has some flavor. The aroma was lemon and wheaty. Golden color topped with a small white head but surprisingly left quite a bit of lace. The flavor was simple but good with citrus flavors some spice and hops. Perfect for a hot summer day."
"Bottle: Poured a clear golden color ale with a medium size foamy head with average retention and no lacing. Aroma consists of medium sweet malt with the distinctive Kolsch style yeast. Taste is also a mix between some medium sweet malt with some unrefined grainy notes and the distinctive Kolsch style yeast that I have a hard time to describe. Well done and very refreshing."
"Poured off the tap at their tasting room in Nowhere, Vermont. Nice white head on the top but it didn't last long. Good lacing though. Color was a pale yellow and the aroma was fairly hoppy much like an American pilsner with hints of lemongrass. The flavors were more Kolsch-like with floral hops, lemon zest and an herbaceous quality. The bitterness at the end is distinct and gives it a crisp finish. Quite dry. Not bad but not great."
"Not the best summer beer, but a decent representation of a relatively obscure style. It's been replicated a lot for summer, but I'd like to see Harpoon flex its muscles on a really great Kolsch in the 100 Barrel Series."
"D: This is one of those beers that's just OK. It's not bad, but it doesn't do much to separate itself from other summer beers."
"Nothing to see here, move along."
"The beer poured with a clear, golden color with somewhat creamy lacing on the sides but a generally thin head. Aromas were a bit thin but had a nice touch of summery aromas including some apple, peach, pear mixed with hops. Taste had that typical dry bitterness, but it was light and watery enough to make this a relaxing summer drink. A slight carbonated punch at the end of every sip, I could picture myself out on the deck of some restaurant drinking this with a nice meal. If only this New England summer did not suck. Ah well. Overall, a refreshing drink from Harpoon."
"Not a very good beer. This is my second from Harpoon & I have to say I've been disappointed in both. I doubt I'm going to finish it."
"I am a fan of the summer beers but this one was a huge disappointment"
"drinkability - Easy drinking, another good one from harpoon."
"D - The overabundance of bubbles hurts this one a bit, as well as that tiny out of place sugary taste."
"D- Very good, nice summer brew Harpoon!"
"Drinkability is fairly high. Low alcohol makes for easy consumption. Simple but decent flavors also make this easily sessionable."
"Pale golden with a foamy white head, leaves some lace. Very fresh, clean, almost lemony-grassy scent. The beer has a crsip clean bite that is wondeefully refreshing and indeed an excellent warm weather beer. The finish has a restrained but nicely crisp bitterness, with a whiff of tart apple-y fruit at the very end. The finish is quite long. I love the tartness, a great summer session beer, very well done."
"The dry bitterness is bringing it down a little for me. Until I get to Köln, which probably won't be any time soon, I guess I won't really know what a true kölsch tastes like. I do know this is an acceptable summer quencher that I would drink again if handed to me."
"Good for summer. (Yeah 08' Celtics!!! Go Pierce)"
"D: very nice and refreshing kolsch beer, better than most. a nice summer brew, pick some up for mowing the lawn."
"D: Pretty drinkable. I wouldn't mind having a few of these around for the hot summer days."
"Actually had this twice on Saturday. Once was on tap right at the brewery during the BA Fest meeting. The second was when I picked up a 12 pack for a bbq later that night. Pours a clear yellow with a thick head that fades quick. Unlike most summer beers that are a bit cloudy, this sticks with the kolsch style and is a pretty crisp and clear yellow. Smell has a bit of spice to it. The taste is very good, and it is a very easy drinking beer. Unlike other summers, this beer doesn't try to get all fancy with lots of ingredients. It's just a smooth, easy drinking brew. Great for a summer night hanging outside while grilling. I prefer to have a pint of this over rival Sam Summer any day."
"Overall, a pretty good beer. Very fresh, and very tasty for the summer. I'm not super familiar with Cask beers to rate this amongst other 'real ales' but it was quite good."
"Well-carbonated, light and refreshing. Excellent summer drink, but highly reminiscent of American Macro Lager. If they sold it as that, it'd be one of my favorites."
"Re-review two months later: I gave the beer an extra .5 in terms of drinkability. As it settles, there is a slight creaminess that dulls the edge of the overly sharp crispness straight out of the bottle. This is still an inoffensive beer with no measure of complexity."
"Just jotted down a few notes here. Looked really nice with a decent head and lacing. Smell very fresh. Tasted very fresh and refreshing. With a tad of clover honeyed malts and a touch of hops. Will buy this one again very good beer."
"D: Very drinkable as none of the flavors are overpowering and it goes down easy."
"Not an enduring classic, but if you want a light summer beer that rises above the mass of undifferentiated pils-based seasonals, this is one to consider."
"Pours a five+ finger white head that fades slowly and leaves a good lace. Crystal clear pale amber color. Light-medium carbonation and light bodied. Slight hoppy, grassy nose. Flavor is balanced, some grassiness, smooth but boring. $1.67 for a 12oz bottle from Capitol Convenience Concord, NH."
"This is a good beer and a solid Kolsch, but the things I like to look for in this style weren't present. It was also a little fizzy in my opinion for the style. It's a refreshing beer, great for the summer."
"I was a little disappointed with this beer, I expected a more bold beer from Harpoon. This beer poured a light golden yellow, with a large white head. It was smooth bodied and went down very easily. The flavor was where I felt it fell short. It wasn't a bad beer, but nothing stood out about it. It would be good for a hot summer day, but not overly impressive."
"Pours a clear, light golden color with a thick white head and high carbonation. Grassy, herbal aromas are present. The taste is well balanced between the sweet maltiness and the bitter hoppiness, neither one overpowers the other. There is a nice soft mouthfeel. Easy drinkability, would be nice after mowing the lawn."
" This is a great session beer and really refreshing."
"It goes down like water for me, but holds a respectable alcohol content that will make me wish I didn't kill the whole sixer. I will be getting more of this... Soon."
"D: why bother."
"Drinkability: Light, cool, and easy to consume. Highly drinkable, with a clean, mellow flavor."
"Drinkability- Extremely drinkable. A delicious easy quaffing lawnmower beer that I wish I had more of during this hot weather. Very refreshing."
"This beer pours very well. Very light, crisp color with a head that lasts about a quarter down the glass. The smell is non-existant. The worst part of the beer. The taste is nice. Good amount of hops without out being too overbearing. The mouthfeel is very crisp and light, making it nice on a summer day. Maybe a little too strong for me to drink all day long. On a hot summer day I would probably reach for something with a lighter feel or taste."
"overall score is bumped up since the taste should be something like 3.7"
"Balanced taste of malt and hops, ending on the bitter hoppier side. Mouthfeel is light and nicely carbonated. Crisp, dry, and refreshing. Flavorful beer but not too complex. Easy to drink. Although partial to heavier beers I enjoyed this brew."
"Most drinkable, very suitable for a summer session."
"D- Excellent. One of the best Kolsches available here in the states. Try this while it's in season, it's a good experience, especially for the price and availability. Cheers!"
"Ultra pale pils yellow. Effervescent carbonations, 2 finger pillowy head. Looks good. Aroma is yeasty clean, mostly hops of a spciy resinous kind, appealing. Taste is very ale, like a pils with more complexity (not always an improvement). Its hoppy...no, it's malty...not, its mild. Its a gateway brew, the hops are present, and it;s not watery, but the flavor is not distinct enough to buy a 12er as i had hoped to if I enjoyed it. Mouthfeel is medium light but not too light, and good for style. Overall, this is a OK beer, but not the best harpoon has to offer to my palate. I can't give it bad reviews as they aren't merrited, but I was disappointed and expected more, this was ultra bland and booring. For a summer kolsh, I'll stick to Geary's."
"Drinkability: A light, easy-drinking summertime-type beer. If it were any lighter, it would float away."
"Overall: Makes for a great thirst quencher on a hot summer day."
"D - Actually, this was pretty good for an American Kolsch. It was more flavorful than most."
"I tried this beer on tap. When the server brought it over, I thought the bar tender had mixed up the order and gave me a Budweiser. After tasting the beer, I still thought it was Bud, so I asked if they mixed up the order. Indeed it was the correct beer. I was disappointed because Harpoon usually puts out decent beer, but this one is terrible. The color is golden yellow like that of a macrobrew and it leaves a decent lacing. The smell is nothing special, typical hops and smells of canned beer. The taste was similar to macro pilsners like PBR. Won't be drinking this one again."
"Nicely drinkable beer. No over powering or overly complex flavors here. This is all about the noble hops and I find it quite refreshing. A summer beer I can recommend that simply never makes it to California on a regular basis."
"D- Eh, an ok beer that's worth trying, but it's not going to rock your world."
"I'll stick with a straight UFO case if I pick up Harpoon again."
"D - great summer drinking beer!"
"This is an easy quaffing beer, with a mellow texture despite the bubbles. Fairly straitforward, without any bells or whistles, just some solid crystal malts and tangy but mild European hops. Not big on flavor, but what is there is drinkable and refreshing. Nothing to get excited about, but I can't see ever turning it down."
"I spent a few days in Cologne last year, and sampled several brands of Koelsch there (and brought a Stange glass home). Koelsch is a tremendously tastey and rare style--and it's amazing how fast the Koelners can drink them, and serve them! This is the closest I've had in North America to what you get there. Koelsch is a very delicate beer, and spoils quickly, so even the German brands available on tap I've had in the USA don't taste as authentically Koeln-ish as Harpoon. Try it fellow Geeks!"
"Poured from a 12oz bottle. Clear golden yellow color with a nice fluffy white head. The head disapated quite quick leaving a fine white film across the top. Mild lacing down the glass. Decent carbonation making this beer light and airy. Smell is light and refreshing. No watered down flavor. Has good body and mouthfeel. Pale malts mixed with a light sweetness. Well rounded light flavor with a good malt profile with light hints of hops. Leaves a nice mild hop tang on the tounge. Smooth and drinkable from start to finish. Certainly a great brew to enjoy on any nice sunny day outside. This Kolsch is certainly one of my favorite session brews."
"This beer pours a hazy pale color with minimal head. Aroma is light, somewhat citrusy with some hints of malt. The taste is also light, if a bit bland. Malty for sure and par the style, a vinous grape like dryness is present. There isn't much indication of hops in this beer either. It does fit the style somewhat but couldn't possibly be the best version of it out there."
"Definitely light, thirst-quenching and refreshing. Extremely drinkable. Appropriate for the warmer seasons but would be good all year round in my opinion."
"T/M/D-Hops all the way though, but not like an IPA....these are light, and tingle the tongue....again the floral and slightly grassy taste....as well as a light citrus lemon/grapefruit note. There is a bitterness though out the beer that lingers, but as it lingers it decreases....creating a refreshing finish. Light, easy to drink, and a great beer to try and convert a macro drinker with....not bad, but now I want my summerfest."
"pours a hazy golden color with a white three finger head that holds to one finger then fades to just cover the beer. smell is of earthy malt and spice from the hops. rich wheat malt up front then the hops pick up the middle to a slightly bitter end. light and crisp with lots of carbonation. really like this beer style, great session beer."
"D: The sweetness caught me off-guard given the style, but once I got used to it I found the beer kind of tasty. It goes down easy and has a decent kick for a “lawnmower beer”. It might not be the best summer beer or the best Kolsch that I’ve had, but it was a decent beer."
"D - Although it's nothing spectacular, this is one I'd keep in the fridge for a hot summer day when I'm working outside. It would definitely hit the spot."
"Poors an almost lemonade esqu pale yellow, with a huge head that quickly faded to leave some nice lacing down the sides. Smell is very light, some maltiness, and a bit of a fruity smell, but not strong enough to narrow it down. Taste has a distictive lime touch to it. Very lite beer, this would be perfect on a hot summer day I would think. Nice bit of a dry hop after, but not too miuch. This is a good beer for a hot day, very lite and tastey. One of the best summer brews I have had..."
"Not bad for a light summer beer. Poured to a hazy golden color with white head that lingered well and then left decent lacing. Aroma was not real strong, but had hints of fruit an wheat. Taste, again, while not real dominant, was similar to a light hefe-weizen. Left a good, thirst quenching palate. Not a great beer, but pretty deecent."
"peace...bc"
"I'm usually a fan of Harpoon's beers, but this is my least favorite of their lineup. It's too dry and frankly doesn't taste that great. Given that Pilsner Urquell and SN Summerfest are in the same price range, why would you pick this up? Disappointing."
"Drinkability - As the summer is winding down, I figured I get away and try the Harpoon summer offering. The finishing bite seems to detract from an otherwise nice presentation. I'm not sure if this would earn a place in my ""summer beer fridge"" to take the edge off a long Saturday of yard work."
"Never being a big fan of summer beers i though i would give this a try anyways considering it was from Harpoon. I was expecting a lot more lemon grass in it and was suprised when there almost wasnt any in the taste, not even the smell. I was drinking it at the Harppon Beer dinner and it was supposed to work well with what i was eating, it definetly didnt, tastes were way off. Even though i love harpoon and everything they do, i will still stay from this one."
"All things considered, this is a very good seasonal beer that meets the needs of summer beer drinkers. It is very crisp with an excellent clean aftertaste. It has mainly citrus nose and mild hopped flavor that accent the milder grain tastes. Good carbonation, color and lacing that persists. Very clean finish which pushes the drinkability very high. I only wish Harpoon was available locally. I've never been disappointed with any of their beers that I've had the pleasure of trying. Stamp this one recommended."
"Pours a nice golden yellow with a 1"" head. Lacing remains until the end. Smells faintly of citrusy hops. Taste is slightly of hops with hints of citrus and finishes clean. Nice mouthfeel with a good amount of carbonation. The name says it all. This is a very drinkable beer prefect for those hot summer days. I will absolutely have this beer again."
"Overall an easy drinking summer beer. This a top tier summer brew. A good rendition of an under-represented style."
"I'm probably being harsh on this beer. I am normally a big fan of Harpoon's beers... Which makes me wonder if there is something wrong with my keg (skunked, cooked, etc.)... But after taking an informal poll among many of my friends, the verdict is that the beer is just dissapointing, not defective... Seems a bit over carbonated as far as mouthfeel goes. A bit on the sweet side. There is definitely a sense of hoppiness (if that is a word) but seems like it might need more hops. I guess I think it seems a bit bland for my taste. Actually, I seem to think its just out of balance. Overall, drinkable, but not one I would buy again - stick to Harpoon's other beers..."
"Good drinkability on a summer day, could have quite a few more."
"Poured with a thin white head that stayed there for a bit. A very clear light yellow color. Nose is lacking, maybe some mild citrus but thats it. Taste is very grainy and slightly malty, with a strong metallic aftertaste. Mouthfeel is ok, and I guess drinkability is ok is you can handle the metallic taste. To me it tasted very much like a not so great macro lager."
"Drinkable in quantity, but not particularly exciting. Not bad, though. If you're a fan of the style, certainly worth trying."
"Drinkability: The ale is fairly refreshing, but not the best representation of the kolsch style."
"Bottom line - there are more refreshing summer brews out there."
"This beer pours a clear golden yellow with a decent sized head, moderate head retention and lacing. The smell is very weak with a light hop and malt aroma. The taste is a reflection of the smell, not much is revealed through taste that is not present in the aroma. The mouthfeel seems rather uncharacteristic of most ales in that it is thin and over carbonated. Overall it is a very easy drinking beer nice to cool down with."
"Overall, I can't recommend this. A disappointing offering from a good brewery. I don't think this may be indicitive of the brew, and have a subtle feeling I only got a bad bottle, but will pick up a new one and edit this review accordingly."
"Cheers!"
"A clear light gold appearance with a fairly small head. The smell was stronger in malt than I would have expected, then a lemon & hop scent came through. Taste was more hops than malt, but well balanced. Very crisp and light mouthfeel, almost tingly. An easy to drink pool beer, but nothing terribly special."
"This beer poured a hazy yellow color with a thick white head into a pint glass. The aroma had some citrus notes that complimented the malt and hop tones. The taste was a good malt and hop balance that left a bit of citrus on the tongue. The beer has a fairly light body and makes for a drinkable summer beer, just what it is intended for."
"This beer was very refreshing on a warm summer night. Definitely a nice summer session beer for your BBQ."
"Light bodied, bubbly yet refreshing. I can't think of a better beer to drink when outside working on my bike. Not the most interesting beer, but for what it is, quite good!"
"BL: another winner from the 'Poon."
"Overall impression: Drinkable and clean flavors, but not overly exciting. Nice gateway beer, and a nice session beer as the weather warms."
"12oz brown bottle with no freshness date. Pours a clear gold with a 1 finger head and good lace. Light malt, slight corn, lemon and honey. Light malt up front with a nice citrus zing. Hop bitterness predominates in the aftertaste. A decent brew but too much bitterness reduces its summertime drinkability. I didn't find it as quenching as I had hoped. A decent beer though."
"D: It's a great mico-macro beer. Exactly what it's intended to be."
"Drinkability: While I haven't tried too many commercial Kölsches, this one is close to style and is very good"
"This beer is exceptionally clear in the glass. It is pretty tasty, light without lacking flavor. It starts with a nice fruitiness, smoothes with a honey flavor, and finishes with slight hop kick. This is a good summer offering, and one that I would enjoy very much in the heat. I would also say that this is the best of Harpoon's seasonals."
"Simple, light and refreshing. Nothing to write home about, just a good refreshing summer brew."
"D - easy to drink, would make a great session beer, on a back porch while the BBQ coals smolder"
"Paid $1.00 for a 12oz bottle"
"This beer is quite refreshing and a good choice for a hot summer day or a mild autumn afternoon."
"Pours a nice pale golden with a light frothy head, good retention, not much lacing but good bubbles throughout travelling up from the bottom of the glass. Nose is decent, light citrus and hops. Taste follows with a bubbly smooth start growing into a moderate hoppiness and ending with subtle hints of citrus. Pretty decent overall."
"D - This is a very drinkable summer beer that is a much better alternative to all of the other watery, weak-bodied and weak-spirited summer ales that every brewery seems compelled to create."
"This is always a sure-fire safe bet. Odd characteristics for this style, its almost as if the lemon zest was added after the beer complete. However, I do enjoy this beer; its drinkability is very high, mainly because it is so light. As are most summer brews, a little uninspired but good. Summer brews are much better on tap."
"Golden color with a thin white head. Nice steady flow of carbonation helps to maintain the thin coating of head on top. Light earthy/bread malt smell and taste. Don't get much else from this beer. It's an ok summer beer but just dosn't have that WOW effect. Can't say that i'd recomend it, but also wouldn't say that it's bad."
"Had a chance to try this during a recent trip to Boston. Poured a clear, golden-yellow into the glass with a big, frothy head. Very light aroma with slight lemon and grassy flavours. Mouthfeel is light but crisp and refreshing. A good drinkable beer on a hot summer day."
"Gold with a smudge of orange. Suspiciously even blanket of white becomes translucent in a hurry. Cookie dough aromas. The drink is thoroughly dry as firm bitter resins constrain peach and tangerine marmelade fruit flavors. Peanut-shaped marshmallows flavors lurk within. Full, creamy texture is what I expect from American ""Kölsch."" There are brief episodes when I think this beer is a successfully crafted light ale. I am happy to forgive the inappropriate use of the term denoting the classic Cologne beer style. But then it seems to lose focus, offering an unintigrated if balanced mix of sweet and bitter. Nothing compels one drink after another."
"It should be fairly obvious by now that I'm both surprised and delighted by this summer seasonal from Harpoon. It has loads of personality, is bursting with flavor and is as dry and as hoppy a kolsch as I've ever tasted. This one is a winner."
"I usually expect more from Harpoon. This beer looks light to medium straw colored and highly carbonated. Smells lightly malty with earthy, grassy notes. A bit sour and bitter smelling. Perhaps a bit grainy and astringent. Tastes more malty than aroma. Still persists with yeastiness and graininess. Hops are a bit out of balance, but I believe that it makes this beer better. Vegital as the body weakens and into the finish. Bitterness lingers a little too long. This is out of style for a Kolsch and too astringent for a Golden Ale."
"The finish doesn't seem to fit quite right, but it doesn't take too much away from this very reasonable summer choice."
"Pours a nice bright clear straw colour with a fluffy white head. Aroma is light mainly of citrus with a little spiceness and fruitiness. Taste is light graininess with just a bit of hop bite at the back. The citrus notes are slight and not nearly as prominent as they were in the aroma. Mouthfeel is crisp and clean. Very easy to drink. Overall while the flavour is not that bold or complex it is an easy drinking summer beer perfect for hot weather."
"Bottled on 05/17/05. Pours a beautiful clear golden yellow with a thin head that dissipated quickly. Minimal lacing. Very pleasant, yeasty aroma with nice floral and citrus overtones. Light bodied with a clean, crisp and refreshing taste. A good beer to have handy on a hot Carolina day."
"Pours a clear, straw colored yellow with a thin white head that dissapates quickly. Aroma is all malt, with scents of wheat and fresh grains and a hint of fruity ale esters. Taste is mix of wheat, grains and a bit of lemon, pretty simple but refreshing. Mouthfeel is crisp, carbonation is high as is drinkability. Refreshing summertime beer, very drinkable and tasty enough to satisfy a mirco junkie."
" The taste is crisp, clean, and light bodied. A hop bitterness hits the tounge at first but is followed by a clean grain. Zesty dry aftertaste. No in your face flavors, just a clean lightness that is great for the summer heat. A perfect summer time beer that pairs well with any grilled meat."
"Overall, a nice refreshing brew to enjoy out by the pool on a warm Independence Day. Not something I'd buy in bulk but a suitable brew given the time of year."
"On the flip side, this isn't swill, it's at least true to the Kölsch style, just a little disappointing. It's definitely drinkable, and good for a hot day in the sun. And, quite frankly, most US brewers have a hard time with Kölsch, so maybe I can't blame them."
"Not a lot to rave about, but very little to dislike. I thought it was an enjoyable summer beer, especially on the 94 degree day that I tried it."
"Highly drinkable in the heat!"
"Crystal clear light golden color. Good fluffy head, lots of bubbles feeding it. Nice lacing too. A little bit of spicy hops in the nose, but pretty one demensional aroma wise. Hmm, nothing in the taste. A little bit of hops, a little malt, but really bland. Not bad tasting, it's certainly refreshing. Good for a BBQ, and it quenches your thirst, but that's about it."
"Pours a vibrant golden hue with a flourish of a small white head that is gone in under a minute. A bit lighter than a kolsch should be, in my opinion, but appetizing nonetheless. Aroma of sweet malt, crisp lager yeast, and a touch of biscuit and honey. More light sweet malt on the palate up front, with a light hop bitterness emerging towards the back of the mouth. Finish has a bit of diacetyl in it, kind of unpleasant. Body is substantial enough, but a tad foamy. Actually, I think the bottle I have right now is markedly worse than the one I had last night. Not a bad beer for a warm summer night, but there a certainly better summer ales to be had."
"A nice crisp pouring beer with bright coloring of light gold. Very drinkable with a thin, soft head. I quite enjoy the ease of drinkability and the light bodied presense coupled with a satisfying clean flavor. This Kolsch style beverage is ideal for a summer fix."
"I don't think I would purchase more of this."
"I would buy it again because Harpoon has good beer."
"Very easy to drink and refreshing to boot. A little bit ""light"" for my personal tastes, but I know this is in character for the style. I could easily have a few of these in one sitting without thinking twice."
"This is beer is pretty much what one would expect in a kolsch. Mild and refreshing in all respects. Pours sunshine yellow with a decent head that left some nice lace rings on the glass. Slightly hazy, not as clear as some the German Kolsch I have sampled but very similar in palate and profile. Aroma is slightly fruity. Taste is mildly sour with some biscuit malt notes and a clean dry finish. a very drinkable summer beer."
"On tap at Barleys Ale House #1. The Kölsch is not an overly complex style but I enjoy it for being straightforward and refreshing. Unfortunately Harpoons version is overly simple. Clear golden color with a thin white head and minimal lacing. Light hops and lemon aroma. Light-bodied with a minimal hops flavor, along with some grass and citrus. The finish is clean and a little tart, but short. This beer is not memorable despite being pretty easy to drink."
"Overall = I do not recommend this one. I'd take a Sam's Summer Ale over it anyway and that's not saying much. Just way too sour without much else to it for my tastes."
"Pours a golden color out of the bottle with a thin white head. Smells quite clean with little to speak of, save some slight malt and hops; the standard for the samples I have had of the kolsch style. Mouthfeel is light, while still being enjoyable; clean and crisp. Well carbonated. Taste is clean, with light malt sweetness and slight bitterness coming out in the finish. Very drinkable, could drink these all day. A good beer for a hot day when something easy drinking is desired."
"Big foamy off-white colored head is all kinds of sticky. Dozens of streams of fine bubbles rise through the transparent sun colored beer. Faint aroma, maybe a bit of grassy hops and pinch of grainyness. Soft light beer. Flavor is a bit sweet, and a little grainy. That's about it, there might be some floral hops in there, but they barely make it to the surface. I'm assuming this is pretty close to a Kolsch, but I just don't like the sweet grainyness."
"So much better than the Sam Adam's Summer Ale I had earlier this week, even if it is a different style. Not a big fan of the Koslch style, but this is an exception. Great golden color, nice head and lacing. Good with the BBQ chicken I had with it. Would be a good session beer. It did have abit of dust on the bottle so i'm not sure how old it was, but tasted nice and refreshing, with hints of fruitiness."
"Light and refreshing. This brew has a flavor that is crisp and delicate. A good session beer to have on a hot summer day (and no, Im not just saying because it says on the bottle that this beer is perfect for summer ). Recommended."
"Drinkability? How long can you last? This one is a full on session brew. HUGE session brew, in fact. Eh, ok, the 5.5% MIGHT be worth noting before consuming too many, but this is perfect for summer and should make many an appearance at many a barbeque. In my opinion, it blows Sierra Nevada's summer offering out of the water."
"Light, drinkable, and pretty good flavors for a Kolsch. A nice beach beer for the summer."
"Poured into the Collins glass a bright yellow with a rocky head that lasted a minute or so while leaving lace on most of the cylinder. Some citrus in the nose. The taste was crispy and refreshing with some additional citrus flavor, almost zesty. Mouthfeel was medium with good carbonation keeping it lively. Is it the Collins glass or does this beer dissapear rather quickly? The glass holds about 12 oz, so it must be me. This beer has summer session written all over it for the spouse and me."
"Damn shame, too, since the lemon nature is amped down in the flavor for a nicely mixed middle (after a citrus attack.) Lovely mouthfilling fine carbonation makes it gulpable without pain. Yes, a light body but with PRESENCE, something the rice/corn guys could learn from. Finish is full of lingering malt, citrus, butter and bitter. I think AB/SAB drinkers would really enjoy this; it could be a gateway beer (those guys rarely smell their beer.)"
"I might have another on a warm day sitting out in the sun, or having a plate of nachos, but not as a regular drinking beer."
"This beer poured a yellowish gold color with loads of carbonation and a large white head of foamy goodness. Slight chill haze apparent, but disappeared after a few sips. Golden and lively. The aroma yields pleasant notes of sweet and fresh nutty grains, pine and just a hint of caramel butter. The taste is very pleasing. Light, yet flavorful with a slightly sweet and bitter tang finish. Wow, this is an excellent beer! A great Americanized version of a German Kolsch beer. Crisp, clean and could be the near perfect summer beer. Left me wanting more!"
"nice clear yellow color, decent white, sticky head. Lemony aroma, sweet with a little hops. Nice taste, mostly sweet lemon (like some type of lemon/sugar candy) with some hops towards the finish. The mouthfeel is a little sickly sweet for my taste, though, but maybe that's just a function of the style. Real easy drinking, great for relaxing on a summer's day. (even though it's cool and rainy right now...)"
"It's a pours a clear light yellow with a small amount of white head. It has a light hoppy aroma. The taste is clear and crisp with a good dry bite in the end. The feel is light and dry with a slight hoppy aftertaste. I was not impressed with the one Kolsch I had had previously so was pleasantly surprised with this offering. Definately a beer I wouldn't mind having again, but I'm not sure when I would say hey I really want another."
"Very drinkable beer, but not a first choice for me personally."
"Mostly a hop taste, little malt, but there is still some there. Interesting beer. Highly drinable, but nothing overly remarkable"
"A very nice beer... indeed. Figured I would try this one out, since I usually dig their other seasonal brews. I really liked the taste of it. It kind of started off as a lighter, hoppier brew, but then switched over to a semi-malty, medium bodied brew. Ofcourse there was the presence of citrus fruits and other lighter tropical fruits, along with the little bite of hops. The head was nice, started out very frothy and thick, but then flattened out to a fairly thick laceing. I would classify this as my new favorite ""lawnmower"" beer. Very refreshing and would be great to have after work."
"Poured out a cloudy light yellow/golden color with some nice carbonation from the tap of course. Smell consisted of grains, hops, lemon citrus type aromas, and some wheat in there as well. Taste was pretty good. Gentle hops attack the palate with some grainy tastes as well with an underlying sweetness that holds true to the kolsch style. Aftertaste was mostly that sweet taste, but wasn't too bad. This is a great session beer."
"this to me was one of those 'across the board' beers, where the rating was the same in every catergory. it's not a bad brew by any means, but it's not that great either. what it turns out to be is a basic, thirst quenching brew for the summer. it pours a decent golden yellow with a sudsy, soapy looking head on top. decent stickinesss here too. the smell is basic and pretty much matches the taste: sweet, wheat and grain. the flavour holds a bit of a fruity zing in the middle and has a refreshing finish. it's not as lemony as many summer brews, which is nice, but it doesn't distinguish itself in any other fashion which would make me run back to the store to grab more. sure, i'd have another one, but this one definitely wouldn't be on my list of have to have summer brews."
"Delicate hints of fruit, herby hops, & a grainy biscuity dryness combined with restrained bitterness. Light bodied, with moderate carbonation."
"Light and crisp, but still sweet, good thirst quencher for hot weather, but not something I'd look to often. ABV seems really low"
"Pours a clear golden color with a large off-white head that laces with nice sticky foam. The smell is of mild hops with a slightly fruity smell that seems a bit of the pulpy variety. The flavor is truly Kolsch with a bit of bite from the hops covering the underlying sweetness. The feel is a bit weak with little crispness. Good drinkability from the medium feel; refreshing."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thin white lace head. The aroma is good. It has a clean refreshing scent that boasts of pale malts and dry lager yeast. There is little in the line of hops, but it is true to style. The taste is decent. It has a grainy pale malt flavor with a clean finish. It is a bit dry, with a slight fruitiness. The mouthfeel is good. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a fine summer brew. It goes down easy. It's light and refreshing on those hot summer days."
"Great summer brew. Drank three or four on Saturday, while blistering in the summer heat at Preakness. Would go excellently with a cookout or fishing trip."
"I enjoy a good kolsch in the summer and this beer will be one of the ones I look to this summer to fulfill that role. It pours very yellow/golden with a rather large head that has some yeast in it. The beer has little smell other than a slight tendancy towards the citrus. It tastes light and wheaty with a background hint of orange peel, lime peel or lemon peel (it's hard to tell). It is very light and easy to drink, best served relatively cold. I recommend this for drinking outside during the summer, especially if you are planning on putting back more than one."
"Appearance: Light golden tone with a nice full two fingers worth of white head leaves big chunks of even lacing with each sip nice appearance. Aroma: Touch of citrus hops to the forefront with grassy herbal lemon hop tea tones, malts pale pilsner like never had a kolsch but I'm getting some mild fruit undertones as well. Taste: Completely refreshing just plain good for summer beer drinking, touch of lemon peel and other fruity qualities are here lemon grass hops with pale malts pretty bitter in flavor but there's a firm hand on balance here. Mouthfeel: Light bodied higher caronation but smooth. Drinkability: Anytime not bad refreshing and relatively complex nice beer I wanna try more authentic Kolsch and more Kolsch style beers."
"Overall- a nice summer brew that would be a definite thirst quencher. I'll have too purchase some more for the HOT & HUMID New Jersey summers."
"Pours a hazy yellow orange colour with a frothy one finger head which releases absolutly wonderful aromas of lemon, lime, grapefruit, hops and malts. The taste is also as fruity and citric as the aroma. Lemons, limes, and grapefruits attack the pallate. It leaves a mild hoppy finish and will keep you in good hands this summer."
"This beer was reviewed right out of the fridge, poured into a pilsner glass. Not too much head on it, with what was there dying down quickly. Gold color, very clear, and somewhat darked than a pilsner. Smell was clean and lagerish, with minimal hops. Taste was also clean and light, very crisp with some hops presence, but I can't tell the type. Lingering grassy hop flavor. Very clean, quite refreshing drink. High drinkability despite kind of high carbonation. Overall this beer was nothing spectacular, but a nice beer for a hot day sitting on my roof."
"Light, crisp, refreshing. It is a very drinkable session brew, but the flavor is lacking a bit. A good balance of sweet malts with just enough hops to balance and take the wheel for a bit. Breads come in at the end. It sure could use a little more flavor, but it is definitely a good one for the summer."
"This beer poured a crystal clear lemony yellow color with a decent amount of carbonation. The head that was produced was fairly thin but dense when first poured then settled to a light skim on the top of the beer. It was white in color and produced a watery - spotty lace. The aromas that were produced were of fresh hops (flowers, spices), citrus fruit (lemon), and wheat grains. An aroma that came across crisp and precise, each note of aroma was pronounced so that you could identify it. The flavors were crisp and refreshing, tastes of fresh hops, grass/hay, lemon fruit, light sweet malt and pronounced wheat grains. Medium bodied. Slightly bitter on the tongue but not overly, a bit dry but not overly. I guess what is being said is, that it is a well balanced beer. Crisp, clean, well carbonated and refreshing. A perfect summertime beer. Very good example of its style. I would definitely get again."
"Medium-light body with tingling carbonation. Very refreshing and an easy drinker."
"On tap at the brewery. A light clear gold ale with a faint white head that dies rapidly. Aroma is also quite light with hints of citrusy lemon. Body is light and crisp with a dry finish. Similar to a German Pils with less of a malt character. A real thirst quencher and not much else."
"This summer ale poured a clear, golden yellow color with creamy, bright white foam that settled but left some lace. The smell was slightly sweet malt and grain with light floral hops. The taste was malty, with biscuit flavor, and floral hops. The finish had some hop bitterness. There was a hint of citrus overall. The mouthfeel was smooth and almost creamy, but with a crisp finish. There was a lingering hoppy bitterness on the tongue. The body was medium. This was a nice summer beer, though a cleaner finish might have been preferred."
"The bottle pours a crystal-clear straw-gold body beneath a fluffy head of bright-white froth. The head retention is good, and it maintains a half-inch or so of big-bubbled foam throughout most of the glass. Additionally, the lacing is quite nice, and it leaves some fairly solid rings at the outset. The nose displays a grainy, wheatish malt with some background floral, grassy, and even spicy hops. There's a mild note of lemon as well, but it's not clear as to where it's coming from. In the mouth it's medium bodied with a gentle tingle on the tongue; and the flavor delivers the sweetish, grainy, and wheat-like malt that the aroma promises. It's backed by a subdued, underlying bitterness (and some very mild hop flavor) that helps to dry the finish which lingers shortly with some grainy maltiness. It's certainly fuller-bodied and more malty in the flavor than a Kolsch from Koln or the Bonn region, and even less hoppy; but it's still a decent summer beer!"
"The beer is pretty much yellow. There is a white head that dissapates quickly. The aroma is pretty mild: makes it hard to determine what's there. I get a whiff of malts, and maybe some lemon. The taste is clean enough, with some malt sweetness and some wheat taste. Not too much to it, but it would be good on a hot day."
"($6.59 / 6-pack)"
"The body is a pale gold with a wimpy head. There is a very slight aroma, slight enough that I can't really pick out any components.The flavor has a light maltiness with a faint tartness in the middle. There's a lingering light bitterness in the finish. It leaves the tongue feeling dry. Very clean."
"Great Kolsch taste. Refreshing, crisp, with a slick, lip-smacking mouthfeel. Immensely drinkable. I only bought a single and I really wish that I had bought more. Definitely a top ten ""just finished the lawn on a hot summer's day"" beer."
"This brew pours clear gold. A quick head with little lace was developed from the pour. A very active beer after the pour. One thing I did like was the constant stream of tiny bubbles racing to the top. The aroma is mild malt with hints of spice and citrus. The taste matches the aroma with a nice malt start and the hints of spices and citrus. I noticed a slight off taste toward the end, other than that is has a crisp finish. A light body makes this easy to drink. Nothing to special with this kolsch. A slight bit above average."
"This is a decent brew from the folks at Harpoon. Pours a light golden color with medium sized head that dissipates very fast and leaves virtually no lace. Nose was crisp with light hop and citrus aromas. Taste was a bit on the sour side with some mild hop undertones. The mouthfeel was light and crisp, finishing dry. There doesnt seem to be a whole lot going on with this one. Not the greatest beer that Ive had from Harpoon. For me, this one was just OK."
"The beer had a nice white fluffy head that left a foamy lace on the glass. The smell was of fresh white bread and sublte malty sweetness. The flavors followed suit, a little sweet, very refreshing with bready, grainy notes. It finishes a mildly dry. It has a really nice full mouthfeel and overall a really great beer and a great American version of a Kolsch. I will drink this one all summer"
"Harpoon has developed a knack for replicating fringe or under appreciated beer styles and exposing us to them. This Summer Beer resembles a well-made Kölch style beer. A light hint of lemon peel. Lightly herbal flavor, clean and fragrant nose. The cool liquid just tempts you gulp large mouthfuls. Nice on a summer evening with grilled bratwurst and potato salad!"
"As I continue to empty my stock pile of summer brews, I sampled this one again. Very clean taste, a hint of citrius, not overpowering. Not a niche beer, but in a class by itself. This beer goes down quite easy, almost too easy."
"Light golden in hue w/ brilliant, lager like clarity.  Well retained white head leaves good lace.  Lightly grainy malt aroma w/ a slightly spicy noble hop nose, perhaps from a Saaz / Spalt combination.  Slightly tart wheat & clean, appropriately light hop bitterness gives way to smooth and lightly bready malt.  Clean, refined, and true to style.  Moderately bodied, w/ an agreeable mouthfeel that helps lend excellent drinkability.  Although secondary, hop flavor is perceptibly grassy and a bit spicy.  Finishes w/ pleasant grainy base malt flavors quickly fading.  Harpoon Summer Beer is a definitive example of a Kolsch.  It's highly drinkable and soft on the palette, but not at all bland."
"At first glance and sniff you're thinking it's another lager. Let's throw summer on the label and sell a bunch. But then you sip, and a most definite ester character sends your buds reeling. I don't know Kölsch, however I do know tasty, well-balanced beer, and this is one. Next time you are in the beer store walk right past those light lagers and grab a six of Harpoon Summer, you won't be disappointed."
"Kolsch is not my favorite style, but this one has a lot of flavor.  Heavy on the lemony citrus characteristics, finishes grainy dry and slightly bitter.  I could swear there are some grains of paradise in there..."
"Very pleasant summer offering.  Clean and fresh.  Mild grain with a hint of citrus in the hops.  Kolsch always seems the ideal back porch summer quaffer - no pretentions, just straightforward easy-drinking."
"Wow nice and easy to drink in the summer heat.Nice lemony/summer smell.It is what most summer brews should be,really enjoyed this one.Just enough hop zing make this beer interesting to go along with subtle flavors of toasted grain and lemon,not a rocket science beer but better than most summer seasonals in my opinion."
"Thanks to Davo for the sample."
"Pale golden colour (er...yellow maybe) with a white, more-foamy-than-creamy head that turns itno a single ring that follows down the glass without any trace.  The nose is a fairly strong floral and citrus.  Pleasant light body that remains dryon the palate.  MAYBE most important, to me at least, this is a summer seasonal that is not a wheat beer or heavily fortified with various flavorings.  Great beer to quence a thirst, especially a warm summer one."
"One of the best local summers that I have had. Crisp, light and refreshing without sacrificing any flavor. The lemon flavor is just enough to keep your interest. Not a huge summer beer lover but this is good."
"Bright yellow-gold body, bubbles flocking to the top. Nice white, cratery head. Some lace left behind. Some fresh grain in the nose. Well balanced hop and malt elements.  Delicate, nothing really bold here, in keeping with the style. A good summer quencher."
"This was the staple of this year's Boston Marathon for my small group of fans.  Pale yellow color and nice foamy head are inviting on a warm day.  Light aroma and taste just heavy enough to give substance to the brew.  Reminded me of summer squash.  Easy drinking."
"Just got some of the 2002 batch and is really fresh.  Has a very clear, golden yellow appearance.  A nice frothy head formed at the top and had a pleasing grain aroma.  Very easy to drink with its smooth and crisp taste.  Very little hop presence (if any at all), but instead a pleasant wheat flavor dominates with a clean finish.  Not amazingly complex but I believe true to the Kolsch style.  If Pilsners and Weissbier are your thing, I think you might like this.  Definately will make for good summer drinking."
"Clear yellow with a fizzy little head that didnt last to long. fruity and biscuity. theres not much to say about this seasonal."
