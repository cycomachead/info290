"I've had a good amount of Karbach beers and this is not that good. Doesn't have a flavor when I drink it."

"The Crack! was nice and loud, so I initiated an inverted Glug to kick things off in Week 1 of the 2014 NFL season. I initially had two-plus fingers  of puffy, bone-white head, but they quickly fell to wisps, leaving loads of sticky lacing in their wake. The visual was unbelievable! The CANstant flow of carbonic bubbles looked like a lava lamp in this Straw-Yellow (SRM = > 2, "

"Overall a drinkable beer but not my favorite. Karbach has many more to choose from that are better."

"Love Street is a summer beer and it does seem well- tailored to fit the style. It is more refreshing than the average beer, but it would be better with a little more carbonation. It isnâ€™t one of my favorites in the Karbach lineup, but it does have enough going for it to make it a worthwhile choice for the season."

"my bet is it won't replace your favorite summer standby if you've already got one. but if you don't have one, this might be it. a solid brew and at 4.7% ABV, it's a great option for a session."

"Pours out a clear pale gold. Not a whole lot of head. Smells like burnt hair and boiled vegetables. Weird buttery aroma too. A touch of sulfur. Reminds me a lot of Shiner's old summer kolsch, but way worse. Grainy, sweet, gross mess. What the fuck is this? Mouthfeel is undercarbonated, slick, and just gross. I hate this. Is there such a thing as a good American kolsch? This is the worst Kolsch I've had, hands down."

"Overall - A well done Kolsch. Very true to style.Exactly what the beer needs to be for a summer seasonal in Houston, TX. I see a viable alternative to SA Summer pils for Houston beer drinkers. I will down a lot of these in the coming months."
"I do like this. Pretty much exactly what the style calls for. So, I can't really take off any points. Just well made for the style, and I will be coming back often in the Texas heat."
