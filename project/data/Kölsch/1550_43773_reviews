"Not a big fan of the style, but it was in the flight."

"Clear crisp Kolsch with a very mild hop finish.  Sporting event beer on a hot afternoon.  Slight flavors of fruit.  Can't tell what though.  Very clean with no after taste.  Sort of like a fruitful, heavier Miller Lite.  Better than that sounds though. Lucky would drink it."

"Overall, very good summer beer."

"The flavor matches the smell, although the hop is more pronounced in the swallow. The body, while rich for the style, is strongly cut by a high carbonation level. Short aftertaste."
"Lots of floral and fruity notes, while still covering that really great hoppy bitterness. Gorgeous pale golden color and a very nice, light, crisp taste with a small but full head. The embodiment of what a KÃ¶lsch should be. Overall, a genuinely good beer."

"Overall I guess its too ""on par"" with the style since I found it grainy and lager like. Not my favorite of the night."

"I went to the Rock Bottom in Cincinnati, though because it's a chain I am going to assume the beers carry over the same. I ordered a flight of six of their standard beers and as I tried each one I found that each was spot on to the style. The remarkable thing is how unremarkable the beers are. Don't get me wrong, they are well worth the try and certainly above average but they are produced for a mass market. So as lazy as it may be I am going to simply say that this beer was a text book example of the style without breaking out and setting itself above."

"The smell was lightly toasted malt with a hint of citrus. The taste brought more of the same, with hops to complement rather than flavor on their own. Light and refreshing in the mouth, this was not the most intriguing of beers but reasonably well done."

"Overall, a very boring kolsch. Just not much here."

"this one is way too light, even for the style. it pours an almost clear watery yellow color with about 30 seconds worth of white foam before it goes flat. the nose is really understated as well, a touch of german malt and some mineral heavy water is all I really sense. indeed no yeast or hops makes it into the flavor profile, and while kolsch is a lighter style by nature, it isn't supposed to be a dumbed down beer for the light beer crowd. that's what the rock bottom version is, and I was disappointed. carbonation was a little weak, and the body was just far too thin. it was an easy mug to drain, but I derived very little satisfaction from this one. the first rock bottom beer that I haven't really enjoyed, I think they've got a good thing going, especially for a chain, but this kolsch is a let down."

"A pretty average but very sessionable ale. Pretty good paired with food, not so much on it's own. Gets the job done as a thirst quencher. Probably wouldn't turn my nose up at this in the future, but not a groundbreaking experience."

"O- Not bad, refreshing, fits well with style"

"O- A good kolsch. Easy drinking and tasty."
"Pours a clear light gold body with one finger of white head. Aromas are very subdued but reminiscent of English muffins. Flavor is primarily grassy with light malts and a lemony finish. Light body is right on the mark. A great session starter at Rock Bottom."
"O: This is a really nice Kolsch. Easy to drink, very refreshing and quite tasty. Nothing overly complex, but well balanced."
"Overall, this is pretty nice."
"22oz mug. Pours a crystal clear straw yellow, soapy white head and little in the way of lace. Aroma is light, bready and floral. Tastes crisp and refreshing, crystal malts, flash of noble hop bitterness, grainy with a slightly sour, macro finish. mouthfeel is light bodied. Overall, a decent kolsch, and a good way to start the day."
"M: Light in body with high carbonation. Mouthfeel is smooth and dry. I had a bunch of terrible to mediocre beer at Rock Bottom La Jolla today, but this was pretty good."
"I think Alien Kolsch would be a more appropriate name. If little green men ever landed in my back yard, knocked on my door and asked me what beer tastes like, I'd drive them to the West Des Moines Rock Bottom and buy them pints of Kolsch. This is simple (in a good way), straightforward, very well-crafted beer."
