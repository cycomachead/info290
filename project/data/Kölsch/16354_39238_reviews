"Had a couple cans of this while in Charleston, SC. A solid, very easy drinking beer. Citrus notes, fruity malts, earthy malts, grass, oak, spice, and some floral notes. Could crush a few of these."
""
""
"I could drink many of these in succession."

"Poured from a 22 oz bomber in to a tall fluted pilsner glass. Pale and straw yellow with exceptional clarity and copious amounts of active carbonation. Like watching the aerator in a golden-lit fish tank. Kind of mesmerizing. There's a nice crown of soft white foam with impressive staying power and scalloped ridges. A very lovely appearance. The aroma is soft and floral. If a beer could smell graceful, this would be the one. The taste brings a mild honey sweetness with subtle, balanced, flowery hops. The woody finish is clean and neat with just a suggestion of dinner roll bread flavor. The spritzy, biting carbonation makes the beer quenching, while the balanced body adds to the refreshment. This is the best Kolsch I've had to date. It's simple, delicious, measured, and crisp. It just hits all the right spots. I was ready to resign the Kolsch category to a poor lager imitation, but this one has renewed my hopes that there are world class varieties out there worth the distinction."

"Flower, bread, honey, good hop bitterness, crisp, good feel. Very nice."

"A classic golden German ale. Crisp with a lively wheat twang and smooth light mouthfeel. Great malt core with soft honeyed presence and a dry clean finish. Great feel, superb drinkability. This was on tap at Fleet Landing in Charleston SC and was a perfect compliment to my fried okra, calamari, and especially the superb crabcakes."

"Pours a cloudy yellow color with a white soapy head and plenty of lace. The aroma is malty, with a biscuity nature, as well as hay and hop flowers. In the beginning, unknown citrus flavors give way to bread, hay, and ultimately hop bitterness rounding out the finish. Good bready malts, crackers, and herbal notes with a complimentary dryness expected with the style. Light bodied, well carbonated and smooth. Overall, this is a high quality Kolsch from South Carolina brewery COAST, better than many imports. Thanks to ""Oneeye"" for bringing back a bottle from the Piggily Wiggily in Surfside Beach, SC, all the way to PA."

"Poured from a bomber into a shaker pint, the beer is a bright, crystal-clear, golden-yellow coloring with a halo of bubbly, white head. Nose of toasted grains, wet hops, and a heavy, floral highlight. Flavors of biscuit, butter, jasmine, bitter hops, and tangy sweetness. Very balanced and clean. Smooth and light in mouth, with a clean, crisp finish. Aftertaste is clean, with hints of hops spice and bitterness. Great brew."

"O: The aroma on this beer is remarkable. Balanced, complex, refreshing - everything I want in a Kolsch. The flavor is a touch heavy without quite the same brightness I got in the aroma, but it is still excellent. I love this beer. I wish Coast distributed it to Atlanta."
"Pale straw yellow color covered with a small, creamy, pure-white head. Subtle fruit, soft malty sweetness, grass, and low sulfery yeast aromas. Grass and lemon hop bitterness, subtle fruity yeast, apple dryness, faint sweet toasted grain. Creamy smooth, a bit under-carbonated. Pretty nice and authentic, though honestly, after a few glasses now, it's never really grabbed my attention all that much."

"CBC thank you, hands down the best Kolsch I have ever tasted. The flavor and mouthfeel are superb."

"Lots of character, and so easy to drink. A near perfect example of the style. Highly recommended."

"Overall - Excellent clean kolsch. I'm taking a bottle of this home."

"O: Ive had tons of COAST beers, but have always passed on this one because I generally am not a fan of the style. But wow, what a surprise this is. For a style thats generally pretty blah, this one is excellent! A light, refreshing beer thats also complex and big on flavor. This one's a winner."

"O: Very pleasant, very balanced, to me it’s a great representation of this style. Keeps me sipping. Would go well with light meats like chicken breast with mozzerella."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O -- A definite keeper and good quaffer over any long-haul. Delicious enough to keep you wanting another swallow without being overbearing on the palate."
""
"Overall a great go at the style. A good blend of flavors and has the perfect amount of body for a lighter beer. COAST seems to make some killer beers: I recommend grabbing one if you ever see it."
""
"Served on tap at the brewery, in a pint glass. Poured a golden yellow, produced a large white head, featured excellent retention and left ample amount of lacing on the glass. The Aroma of this classic German style consisted of malted grain, pear and lemon rind. Light in body, this brew had an excellent smooth mouthfeel, a base of malted grain, earthy grass and a crisp finish. This is a nice version of the style, refreshing, great lawnmower beer, great session beer."
"O: Oh, wow. This one lives up to the hype in my opinion - I could totally kill multiple bombers of this in an hour's time; the drinkability is insane. I'm gonna search this one out in the future."
""
""
""
"From a personal standpoint, pilsners have never struck much of a chord with me as I have always found them to be rather bland and lifeless. This particular pils has changed my mind entirely as it still manages to encapsulate the classic pils smells and tastes while adding many layers of intricacy. The nicest part about the brew however is the fact that it enhances whatever you may eat or drink following the beer as your palate is freshened and clear of any distracting agents. I will certainly have this again."
"Happy I picked this up when I was in town, it seems to stand up to its good reviews."
"This is an extremely pleasant beer for the summer season and one I would love to enjoy again."
""
""
""
""
"O - I have to admit that I am not real familiar with this style, and my expectations were low. This offering from COAST really exceeded them by alot. I am glad I got two bottles so I can enjoy it again later. A really good summer brew that can be enjoyed anytime. If you can get your hands on this, do yourself a favor and grab it."
""
"Overall-- this is a great Kolsch. Maybe not the best I've had, but absolutely worth drinking. I'll be happy to have this one again."
"Cheers!"
""
"Overall, this lived up to and even exceeded expectations. Yum."
""
""

"O - This is an amazingly balanced and tasty beer and is perfect for a summer day. You get malty sweetness and hop bitterness, refreshing dryness and carbonation, and a lower ABV to keep you going in the heat. As someone who's not too crazy about weizens, this is a great alternative for a thirst-quencher."
""
"Kolsch as really become a favorite of mine...and this one has as much personality as a Kolsch can have. Not quite up to Captain Lawrence for me, but very close. Very good and worthy of every good rating it gets."
""
"Pours a slightly-hazy pale gold with a lusciously thick bone-white head. Great retention. Sticky sip rings cling to the glass. The nose is sharp with grassy notes, lemon-lime, floral hops. Body is effervescent and lively. Sweet citrus flavors join arms with a subtle green hop twang that is lip-smackingly good. This beer errs on the mild side, but it is packed full of flavor regardless. Refreshing and tasty. Loved this one."
"O – Excellent refreshing brew here. Would be absolutely perfect on a hot summer day or any day. Solid taste with a lot more flavor then most kolsch’s that I have had. Winner."
""
""
"O: Beginning to like Kolschs more and more. Another great beer for a hot day."
""
""
""
""
""
"Very golden with mustard hues. Very white thick single finger head with good retention and lots of lacing. A very attractive brew. Aroma is as buiscutty as they come with some light banana/pineapple notes and grain mixed in. Flavor is heavy on the wheat and biscuit up front with transition to a subtle spicy yeast and noble hops like finish. Honey notes aren't there for me. Light to medium in body with moderate to high carbonation. An excellent kolsch which for me are usually too dry and bland whereas this one is not overly dry and has a traditional flavor with some additions to make it more interesting."
""

""
""
"Overall, real solid Kolsch, I am still looking for the perfect one, but this would be great on a hot day. Boy would this be good on a hot day. Not sure if this is my favorite, but real glad to have had the chance to try it. Would have again in an instant."

"Served from tap into a Foothills shaker. Poured a hazy straw yellow with a half finger pure white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, banana, fruit, rye, and grain. The flavor was of sweet malt, gain, fruit, banana, subtle spices, and rye. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. I had just recently had a bottle of this one that was aged and I have to say that I enjoyed the aged version better than this one. While this one was still pretty good, the rye component as I saw it was a little strong and covered up a lot of the more mellow flavors going on here. If this would not have been the case it would have definitely received higher marks as the bottle did. Still a very solid offering from COAST that everyone should try at least once."
"O: Very drinkable beer. This would be a nice beer that you could drink in large quantities. I wasn't overly impressed with the appearance, but the rest of the beer was rather solid. Worth a shot."
"This is a solid beer. It is not my preferred style and I definitely enjoyed this. The taste that I had at the brewery was solid and this one, bottled on 8/10/11 was good as well. It is a nice, light, and easy beer to drink."
"Overall, a really nice kolsch. Nice to get a fresh bottle while in Charleston and enjoy this beer. I frequent Charleston a lot and will be drinking this one again and again."
"This is my go to beer in CHS for the spring and summer months. Quite possibly the perfect beer for those hot, humid Chucktown days and nights."
"32/50 is a tasty and refreshing beer, but it did not impress me as much as I had hoped it would. If you happen to be in South Carolina, this is definitely worth a try."
"O - Didn't like it for the style or for beer in general. Taste was bad, didn't care for it."
"A hazy straw yellow pour with a white bubbly head, this beer looks more like a Belgian White Ale than a Kolsch, but it still looks tasty. High marks all around for the classic sulfer-y Kolsch aroma and grassy-floral hops. Clean is the key to a successful Kolsch, and COAST has clean nailed. It manages to be both delicate and flavorful. Exceptional! There is an unadulterated sulfer-and-sweet wheat and honey flavor that draws me back and back and back again for more. I wonder how ""to-style"" this is for a Kolsch given the appearance and wheat addition; if anything, it is an improvement on the style! I initially had some problems with carbonation, and found the excessive bubbles off-putting, but with time the problem subsided. I'd buy a case of this if it was available locally."
"Overall a great beer for the style. It meets the requirements in all departments except appearance but that is easily forgiven. Wonderful spring/summer beer, but would be tasty enough to have any time of year."
"Overall: An enjoyable and very refreshing Kolsch on a pleasantly warm San Diego summer day."
"Definitely a flagship beer from them- always fresh and always crisp. Great beer for summer- best place to get it is straight from the source from the walk-in wall. Go check it out, fill your growler and support one of THE best, and your local, brewery"
"That's it for my first review. Kudos to COAST for cranking out great beer after great beer after great beer."
"O: This is pretty much a perfect summer beer. A nice, refreshing, easy-to-drink kolsch that actually has some flavor to it. I tend to stay away from the style because most of them are bland and watery, but if more kolsches were like this, I'd drink them all summer long. Kudos to COAST for re-igniting my interest in a style I'd all but given up on."
"Yellow and hazy with a small white head. Good lacing. Aroma was black pepper and spice. Flavor was crisp with a hint of sweetness and a mild bitterness. Creamy consistency with a low to moderate carbonation. Interesting and fun but not remarkable."
"Had at McHales in Fort Mill. Poured into a pint glass. The color on this beer is exactly what you would expect. Nice head. The smell was nice, nothing overbearing but really enjoyable. The taste followed the smell. Wonderful balance. The mouthfeel wasn't thin, but spot on. Overall, I drained this beer quickly. It's highly drinkable and really something that you can see yourself drinking 3 or 4 before you realized it. It was a pleasure."
"Before I know it, I've nearly finished off the bomber. This is a hell of a session beer, but also something you could slowly sip and pick apart. Hell of a beer."
"O: This is one of the better sessionable beers out there."
"O: A good beer and a good representation of the style. Easy drinker."
"Drinkability: very easy to quaff this beer. A wonderful session beer that provides refreshment you want."
"All in all, this is a very easy brew to drink. Not too familiar with the style, but this is amazingly balanced and I imagine this would represent the style very well. If you liek very good, drinkable, session brews, then definitely hunt this one. Otherwise, if you're a big beer guy, don't bother."
"Pour is gorgeous. Golden-straw body with quite a bit of visible carbonation and a huge white head with great retention. Very creamy head. Loads of lacing. Nose is equally fantastic with some nice front-end notes of grain followed up with some beautiful floral hop notes. The taste mixes light grain and floral hops beautifully with some light fruit notes in the background. Mouthfeel is light with crisp carbonation and a nice finishing bitterness. Insanely drinkable. This is currently the #1 Kolsch and very deservedly so."
"Another top-notch brew from Jamie and David!"
"Pours murky and yellow. A bit of head but it dissipates quickly. Smells a bit hoppy and yeasty. Tastes a bit bitter and hoppy and yeasty. Very tasty. Smooth and crisp and highly drinkable. Overall a great kolsch. Not my favorite style but tasty enough ;)"
"D: This is my first introduction to the style, but I love this beer. It is so very light and refreshing but still has a rich, fairly complex flavor and uses ale yeast instead of lager. Thank you very much Matt for introducing me to this style!"
"D - This stuff is awesome. I love Kölsch, and while this may not be Köln's idea of Kölsch, it is a perfect take for a North Carolinian brewer."
"The drinkability on this is astronomical. It's so clean and crisp, a nice light sweetness on the initial taste and finishes smooth and dry. A nice light herbal hop bitterness teases you but doesn't overpower at all. No lingering sticky feel or sweetness, it must have attenuated very well."
"Pours a light straw color with poofy white head. Smells really refreshing - light malt, slight lemon, nothing too complex. Again, light malty flavor with faint citrus notes, a hint of grass. Quite bright and refreshing. Body is fairly thin with high carbonation. Overall, a great summer beer that would instantly improve the tap lineups of most bars."
"Bottle. Golden crystal clear straw color with a fluffy white 2 finger head. Very clean smelling in that there isn't any overpowering aromas that come from this at all. The faintest smells are those of light malts sweetness and a touch of hops presence. The taste is also very light. Slightly sweet upfront with a surprisingly semi-bitter aftertaste. Some floral notes. The aftertaste is bothersome to me."
"Notes: This is my second COAST offering aside from Boy King, and man, this brewery is impressive. Too bad I have to drive 40 minutes away to get some. Up next is HopArt and Belafonte"
"D: Awesome."
"Overall, the aftertaste wasn't too clean which really bugged me. I would rather have a kolsch clean and refreshing. It was pretty decent otherwise. I didn't detect any of the honey, but I did get some herbal notes. Decent drinkability."
"Poured into a Unibroue tulip from a 64 oz. growler, poured from the Charleston beer exchange 2 days ago. Lovely, white head, nice retention, soapy, fluffy, lacing not too sticky. Aroma is kinda hard to describe....Kolschy? Maybe a bit of salt in the aroma maybe a bit freshly cut grassy? Interesting. Taste is sorta salty actually and maybe a reserved balance between bitterness and sweetness with a touch of salt thrown in. Very easy to drink and very refreshing. This is one you would drink in the head and probably avoid when its snowing. Enjoyable. Tasty."
"D - Very drinkable beer. I could see myself sitting on my deck all day and not moving...maybe I should have saved this for the holiday weekend. Low alcohol at 4.8% makes this extra good. A true session beer with tons and tons of flavor. This should satisfy any craft beer drinker...outstanding."
"D-not a favorite style but some balance, pretty straight forward and done to the style. Quite grainy and that seems to dominate but there is some balance with light hop bitterness."
"I was lucky enough to receive a bottle of this from thagr81us in a trade down in South Carolina. It poured an excellent and vibrant straw yellow with medium cloudiness. The head was white and frothy. It smelled great, slightly yeasty with citrus hints to it. It was just like you'd want a Kolsch to smell. The taste was excellent as well. It featured the citrus like yeasty flavor with a slight sourness to it. It was superb. The beer was very, very light, almost like a pale pale wheat. It was very drinkable and my friend and I both really enjoyed trying it. I greatly recommend this. It was perfect on a humid summer night."
"Drinkability: You could drink this all day long; I have never cared for this style but liked this one!"
"Overall, this was a 1-2 knockout punch. Wonderful beer from COAST. Would buy again (and again, and again) in a heartbeat. One of the best summer session beers EVER!"
"T: It has a slight malt presence on the front of the sip. Not as much sweetness as I was expecting from the smell. It has a slightly dry finish with with some hop notes. Overall this is a great beer. It hit the spot on an extremely hot day. It is incredibly refreshing. I haven't had too many Kolschs, but this is definitely the best one I have had."
"The palate opens light with a blend of bread, raw wheat, a mild grain character with some grainy astringency. Mildly fruity and honey-like in the mid-palate, my first few sips have a slight butteriness that decreases as it breathes. Hop character is light, a blend of delicate spices and a little citrus-like, more an herbal citrus rather than a fruity citrus. Light in body with moderate carbonation, this beer does feel a little slick on the palate. That slickness, along with the mild astringency, takes away from the beer. Enjoyable stuff, I'd drink an awful lot of it. I'd argue that the Stoudt's Koslch is better, though"
"It's hard to find a good Koelsch, but COAST just made the search a little easier. It has the nice golden appearance of a German style Koelsch. This beer just looked refreshing, as it was 100 degrees out that day. The crips, clean taste was everything I hoped it would be, and one of the best examples of the style I've had since I had authentic ones in Germany. I could drink this beer all day, no problem. A fantastic example!"
"Drinkability: I feel an oncoming urge ... someone find me a lawn to mow, stat! This is a fantastically easy-drinking beer, and I was a little blown away when I saw it really was only 4.8% abv (and how fantastic that it's offered in a 22 oz. format!). A summer beer to be envious of, or to enjoy copiously if you are fortunate enough to live in South Carolina, so for those who do, drink up, and drink up plenty!"
"This is definitely a case of ""less is more."" Drinkability is superb. The only way I imagine this could be better would be on tap. Recommended with ease. On a side note - COAST, thank you for dating your bottles."
"Damn excellent beer & that was created for a 78 degree summer evening with friends. Well, done. COAST."
"Drinkability: Wow, if every Kölsch tasted like this they would be my go to beer style all summer long"
"Overall impression: Extremely refreshing and enjoyable brew. Highly recommended."
"Very light bodied and easy to drink. Nice beer to sit back and session for awhile while playing pool or skeet ball."
"Coast is defintely the BEST local brewer I've tried in recent years here in the Carolinas. Way to go COAST! Keep it up."
"Light bodied, appropriate carbonation. Tingly, yet still somehow smooth. Very refreshing. Highly drinkable, and surprisingly tasty for the style. I'll come back to this one as it starts to heat up."
"To those who say it needs ""more flavor"" to truly be labeled a kolsch - I respectfully disagree. The aim is perfectly true on this one in my opinion."
"Coast Brewing Company brews good beer. I'm not the biggest fan of Kölsch, but this one's impressive. It really succeeds because of the honey/hop presence. They add a lot to the overall flavor and character of the beer. I'm still not the biggest fan of the style, but this one is certainly impressive. Definitely worth seeking out, especially if you're into Kölsch."
"D - This is an extremely light beer that doesn't quite deliver the wheat and honey notes promised on the label. There is some nice herbal hop character hinted at in the aroma, but it fails to follow through in the flavor. There is a good balance between the very light malt and the fleeting hop flavor and bitterness, but both could stand to be turned up a bit. This isn't a bad beer, but I think they have erred on the light side of the Kolsch style. This is more of a blonde or cream ale, it would need a bit more malt and hop presence to make it a Kolsch."
"I had this on draft a while back, but finally getting around to reviewing based on the growler picked up at CBX last weekend. Pours a bright, straw gold with a snowy white, one finger head; lots of carbonation going on. Smell is dominated by clean, bready malts. Taste is of light malted grains / bread crust with a touch of grassy hops... finishes with a nice bit of sweetness followed by a well balanced bite. Also, a little fruity / estery-ness in there. Mouthfeel was pushing medium-bodied and surprisingly creamy - I was really surprised by the mouthfeel. Drinkability... YES! Awesome stuff! So refreshing!"
"Two words: crazy delicious. 32/50 hits the tongue with a crisp, herbal grassiness that adds just the right amount of hops to balance the white cracker malt notes. Clean, grassy finish with a well-crafted bitterness and a trace of mineral water and white wine spritzers. Mouthfeel is exceptionally light on the palate, with a brisk, bubbling carbonation level. All in all, a pleasure to consume. Highly recommended and perhaps the best American-brewed version of the Kölsch style."
"Somehow this is so simple, without any 'big' flavors, but doesn't get too boring. Extremely drinkable and one that I would like to have again, especially on a hot day this summer."
"D- This was a very drinkable beer that I enjoyed very much. Opened up my eyes to what a very well crafted beer in the style could be. COAST hits it dead on and I personally would love to get some more bottles of it."
"This was just an all around solid take on the Kölsch-style and another great offering from COAST, with an easy drinking crispness and a good amount of flavor presence for a sub 5% beer. This would go down perfectly on a warm spring or summer day."
"Beer is medium body and finishes without an aftertaste at all. Feels great, nice carbonation in the mouth interesting kolsch. Second taste, almost fruity that time, again really drinkable, some almost apple flavors up front gives way to really mild bitterness on the back end. I am warming up to these Kolsches. I like this beer a lot. I would order it and have it again."
"So glad to grab a bottle of this in the Midlands. Pale straw golden pour has a fizzy white head that billows up and sticks around. Lots of carbonation, like a pilsner and an aroma of light grains, various melons and fruit salad. Taste is smooth and fresh with a nice kick. Lots of green grapes in the taste before a mild fruity sweetness takes over. Some buttery caramel also present, but there are enough hops present to give this brew a great body and taste. Finishes sweet and crisp. Perfect spring or summer beer here. My new favorite Kolsch."
"I cannot tell by the bottled on date whether this beer was bottled on 1/14/09 or 11/4/09. I would guess that the date is in November based on the taste, but it is possible that I'm wrong. For a beer with such low ABV, 32/50 packs a lot of flavor, and it is truly something I could drink quite a few of on a summer day. Right on for the style."
"D: This kind of ""tastes like beer""--in the sense most non-beer drinkers would describe. Nothing really all that good about this beer, unfortunately."
"Keep it up COAST."
"I don't drink too many of the lighter styles such as this, but for a light session ale this would be great. Blows away the macros that could be considered ""similar""."
"Really quite enjoyable."
"D: An example of a beer that is light, crisp, and enjoyable...yep extremely enjoyable. Go Kölsch, go."
"An excellent beer for a hot day, and an interesting domestic variant on this subtle style."
"Endlessly drinkable."
"Pretty carbonated up front, probably too much so, with a light crisp sweet yet earthy body and dry effervescent finish. Subtle bready yeast with light crisp fruit notes, namely apple and pear along with a nice earthy, grassy hop presence. The honey used adds some additional sweetness but this beer is excellently balanced and complex. One of the best examples of the style. Highly recommended!"
"Nice example of a Kolsch, albeit one that trades some of the crispness for a more rounded, fuller flavor- which in itself is remarkable given the low 4.8%abv. Growler from the Charleston Beer Exchange. Pours a classic light golden with good clarity. The head is somewhat slight, but the carbonation is fine and I'll chalk that up to the growler. The smell is rounded rather than crisp with an almost nutty aroma of lager yeast and some gentle hops. The taste is also rounded, with a bit of butteriness and some lager yeast up front, but with a refreshing noble hop crispness that is long and refreshing. Really nice lingering bitterness makes this quite satisfying and makes it feel a bit more full bodied than it really is. Becomes more delicious with every sip. Quite nice."
"smells a bit grainy with light fruits and citrus. sweet malts and hops. taste is also sweet with a bit of grass. very crisp and refreshing. VERY refreshing. light body good carbonation. would session this beer all day long"
"Had this at the Battery soccer game last week. Yes, they sell this at the local semi-pro soccer games! Anyway, it was a great beer for the time, especially since it was a bit hot out. It had a nice light fruit/wheat taste to it, as well as a malty backbone. The slight hint of the hops didn't overpower the others. The head was thick and creamy, even lasted a while in a plastic cup. Definitely going to have another at tonights game! Go Battery!!!!"
"Well done!"
"D: This one goes down super fast, especially when you are at the beach in the hot and humid south."
"If you make this the first Kolsch, you will love the style for the rest of you life!"
"The taste follows the nose, there is little flavor, but the beer is extremelt crisp and refreshing. This is an excellent summer beer to drink in large quantities. Good Job Coast, I cannot wait to get some more of your offerings."
"The mouthfeel is as crisp as I've ever had in a beer and leads to exceptional drinkability...I could have taken down this entire growler in short order. A great kolsch."
"Overall this is a solid beer for the style, although I have to admit I'm still developing an appreciation for said style. This would be a great summer beer, to be enjoyed while playing bocci ball. Thanks again to Ding for sharing this."
"Notes - Another winner from COAST."
"D: This is a very drinkable beer. It's very light and goes down easy. This would be a good summer beer."
"I've certainly had this one the most, though."
"v: oz1 al1 2.5"
"Overall outstanding, probably the best session ale I have had in I dont even know how long. This was intense, tight, perfect. I was in heaven. Thank you Jamie and David for brewing such a wonderful ale. This is the kind of thing that can break a market wide open."
"It was presented in a room-temperature glass with a thin, bone-white head with moderate retention. The color was spot on - a beautiful, deep-golden yellow with NE-quality clarity. The nose was muted, slightly malty, but not terribly present. Mouthfeel was medium with a light, dry, lemony taste on the tongue. Finish was dry and refreshing. This would be perfect on a hot, humid day such as the one that I was experiencing in Charleston, SC."
"Zum wohl!"
"This is quite the enjoyable brew, especially with the warmer months coming up. I'm very glad to have tried this. It would be cool if this got bottled because not only is the beer great but the label would be nice, too."
"Could drink a great deal of this. If only they would bottle this beer it would be the ultimate summer outing brew."
"This is an excellent beer. Far better than the Kolsch offerings from Harpoon and Flying Dog, you'd do well to seek this one out when on the Charleston beach. I look forward to the day I can take a few cans of this down to the waterfront..."
"A great light session beer!!!!"
