"Nice, light, easy drinking kolsch!"

"O: A fairly average example of the kölsch style but easy to drink and somewhat enjoyable. A nice beer for the summer, especially considering the price."
""

"Not much head or foam. Nice golden color. The taste was slightly bitter at the end almost metal like. Not much on any aroma or smell capacity as far as hops. Average sums it up best."

"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a light golden amber with a thin white head that dissipates to a thin film and ring around the glass. Aroma of neutral malt, wheat and slight citrus sourness. Flavor is slightly tart bready malt, citrus and light wheat, finishing with wheat and grassy hop bitterness. Light bodied. A light, refreshing, but unremarkable summer beer. Light and low malt for a kolsch, but the light color and flavors are within the kolsch universe. A bit astringent in the finish, but pleasant and drinkable for a light summer beer, as advertised."

"The Verdict: Average. Trader Joe's take on a Kolsch is a bit bland overall. Goes down smooth, so it would make for an acceptable Saturday afternoon next to the pool beer."

"The metallic flavor detracts from the experience. More bitter than anticipated. Astringency lingers."

"High D+"
"Pours a golden yellow with a slight orange hue; topped with dissipating white foam and has excellent clarity. Nice floral and straw nose here with a good dose of grass and corn. Nice slight bitterness up front with some grain and corn with a sweetness about it - a little dry. Light bodied with moderate carb and wet finish. Average beer I'd share with people."
"Smells of grainy malts with a little dry mustiness that reminds me of sourmashing techniques. A bit of a lemony flavor pokes through, but it isn't quite enough to save this one for me. The dry musty notes and the grainy malts really run the show, and it is too much. I like my Kolsch a little more light and refreshing."
"Maybe a bit better than the normal summer beer, although this was slightly different. Very, very similar to the Plznr."
""
"The body was a bit too full for the style and was also sticky. Drinkability was OK, you could drink a couple at a cook-out, or any situation where you're not focused on the beer. Overall, an OK brew, neither terrible or great. You can do worse, and better, for a bargain sixer."
""
"Overall: A decent take on a Kolsch. Nice malt elements. Could of used some more citrus zest."
""
""

"Mild undercurrent of corn, wondered if this was the trader jose with lemon. Bitter and metallic wheat character at times. You get what you pay for, at least this comes in at a decent price. No off flavors."
""
"Light yellow in color with a nice head of white on top that faded gently into a thin veil that left the top bare after just a few minutes. Light bready notes and some grains in the smell, a bit light for me, without that top notch banana aroma you would see in a really good version of the style. Smooth mellow flavor, albeit light. Even and well balaned with a light bready note and a touch of light grassy notes towards the end. Smooth and easy drinking as this one went down effortlessly into the night"

"OK summer beer, just a little off tasting with citrus out of balance for the style."
"just plain not good. would definitely not buy again... and I really like good kolschs. but this isn't it. nor is this a good summer brew. it just falls flat and has some odd flavors that are flat out unpleasant. which is too bad. the overall score bump is an evaluation of value... because that's got to count for something. but still... man."
"Pours a clear honey orange with a 1 inch puffy off-white head that settles to a thin film. Small spots and broken rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is somewhat lacking, but what I do get is grains and light fruits. Taste is surprisingly bitter right off the bat with a bready/biscuit flavor and some citrus zest on the finish. The bitterness is somewhat assertive on the palate after each sip. An average mouthfeel with a decent carbonation level and a crisp flavor. Overall, this is a pretty average beer and the bitterness is a bit too much to be a truly enjoyable Summer beer in my opinion."
"Taste is good, a nice full grain with light fruity sweetness, some apple and lightly bitter grass and pepper. Simple but solid, firm with good depth and balance, a nice full feel, it’s not very good, but it's a decent kolsch."
"Best by date is 1-22-12. New and rather attractive label."
"It is a very average beer. The aroma is pleasant having strong malty tones with some fruity esters from the hops. There is a lot of white head and foam and it is over carbonated. The taste is grassy with a mild citrus finish. The body is thin and has some bite."
"Overall- It's OK. I didn't know the style it was when I bought it, it just looked nice at the Trader Joes and a summer beer sounded good. I would say it is good for warmer weather, but the style itself isn't one of my favorites. It is very much like a macro-lager, but not as grainy."
"Final thought - 5%+ ABV, $5 a sixer and refreshing, not bad"
"D: Goes down easy on a hot day, but very average for style."
"This beer produced a thin white head. It had below average head retention. Zero amount of lacing left behind. The aroma was yeasty, and slightly hoppy. The taste of this beer is bready with some banana like yeast flavor. Light in body, very drinkable. Good beer for a summer day. This beer finishes very dry, leading me to empty this glass very quickly. As far as Kolsch goes, this is average.It will do the trick on a hot day."
"T: The carbonation was a bit high for me and the body is a little too heavy for this to be a good summer beer. It's just not refreshing. Some honey upfront followed by a hint of stale hops and maybe a touch of aspirin towards the finish. The middle has some orange in it as well. It's not the worst of the Trader Joes lineup (see Kennebunkport Wheat) but it's not really worth picking up."
"overall: very drinkable beer. I have book knowledge about Kolsch beers, but not having been to Germany, haven't had an authetic one. I've had Hale's and enjoyed it, but that's about it. That said - I'd be OK with this in my fridge for friends coming over during warm weather."
"""You can put it on the board...YES!"" Definitely in a good mood after home run number two (this one's Carlos Quentin's) makes the score 6-0 ChiSox in the third. Time for a kolsch. This one pours a lightly hazy grapefruit yellow topped by a finger of short-lived white foam. The nose comprises dusty orange, dry wheat, and plenty o' butter. Hm. The taste isn't really more heartening, with notes of funky wheat, sour mandarin orange, and straight dust. A light but still very obvious bitterness gums (not enough tooth to bite) the tongue a bit at the end. The body is a hefty-feeling light, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, a sad kolsch, straight up."
"Kolcsh styles aren't supposed to be heavy or extremely flavorful but I felt that this was far too light even for the a Kolsch style beer. The color was a very clear yellow. Not too much happening in here. The beer is for sure a summer time brew. This wouldn't really fit well in the colder months"
"Bought this because this summer brew was being sold at a closeout price ($3.99 for a 6-er) during this brutal winter here in the Hudson Valley. I can't speak to how faithfully it represents the true Kolsch style, but while it is highly drinkable it has almost no character, i.e., anything that makes it memorable. Accordingly, it reminds me of the kind of beer you have after a couple of good ones -- that is, when your palate is not so discriminating and you just want to keep the buzz on. Not that I ever do that, heaven knows -- I'm just saying. Anyway, I think their strategy worked because I was at TJ's today and there was none to be had."
"12 oz bottle from Trader's Joe. Pours golden with a lasting, foamy, white head and medium carbonation. Aroma of grassy hops, some biscuit malt and lemon. Taste is similar but more balanced. Slight off sour notes. Medium, slightly crisp body. Medium, dry finish. Not bad."
"I put appearance at the end because the first two I had were out of the bottle and having poured the third, I think it might actually taste better in the bottle. A Kolsch? Other members say no. A drinkable beer? Yes. Accept it as a summer seasonal more than a Kolsch and enjoy it...and get them cheap now (October) before they are gone."
"Drinkability : Very sessionable, but Kolschs should be. It's not a great Kolsch."
"A great tasting beer. Half the price of Blue Moon and just about as tasty.. only problem is that it is not a Belgium Wit, but a Kolsch."
"I hope that they will re-visit their brewing technique on this one and improve it for next year."
"Another good bargain beer from Trader Joe's."
"D: Low ABV makes this a good session beer, but it is a little corny for my taste. Overall mix of flavors are not bad just not by cup of tea."
"Drinkability: A pretty bland beer overall, but it only cost me 20 cents, so I'm not complaining. This would make a good refresher and, at the price I got it for, it's still worth it. If you can get it that cheap, it's at least worth the tasting."
"Poured golden yellow with lager clarity. Small head that falls quickly. Smell is rather unappealing. Like wet dog and cooked vegetables. Taste is also a little strange. An upfront lime flavor that seems out of place with a small grassy hop profile. Flavor and aroma did begin to improve as the brew warmed up. Has a mild dry bitterness in the back end and a slick mouthfeel. Not something I would want another of since I had trouble finishing one. In short, a subpar attempt at a great style."
"For $6 a 6-pack, I'll take this to the pool or beach over your average macro lager any day. Not the most exciting beer in the world, nor is it a great example of the style (seems to be more of a Pils), but it's an inexpensive summer beer and in this NC heat, it's pretty satisfying."
"- Taste was very mellow as the slight bitterness of the hops and roastiness of the malts allowing a hint of caramell sweetness. Very pleasing to the palate as its not to heavy. Small price makes this brew style very drinkable here in the 110 degree weather..."
"Pours a clear gold with a small white head. Aromas are pretty subdued but are good: a lemony hoppiness with faintly honeyish maltiness. These same notes come through on the palate, where the flavors are also subdued but are very natural tasting and well-balanced. It's nothing special but it's a fine representative of the kolsch style. A nice choice for sweltering weather."
"Overall: A smooth, fairly clean summer beer perfect for the barbeque."
"D – This is ok, but not as good as the real German Kolsch."
"Value: B"
"It is quite drinkable and is smooth enough though the flavor of the malt gets old quickly: I could drink a few of these but probably wouldn't because it is kind of boring beer."
"I would definately recommend this to my BMC drinking compadres. I see it as a pretty good gateway beer out of MacroLand. It's not a bad beer. The price on it was good, and thinking of it as a grass-cutter brew, I probably have it again."
"Drinkability- Had to try now that my Tj's is selling single bottles rather than whole six packs. Not disappointed, but not impressed...just another beer."
"I do enjoy the carbonation and dry after taste. I find myself looking forward to the next sip. Overall, it has a decent drinkability but would probably pass on this if browsing the Trader Joes beer section unless I wanted to get a decent beer for some BRC drinking friends for a hot summer day."
"Pours a darker than normal copper color with a smallish head on top. Surprising amount of fruit in the nose, mixed along with the to-be-expected grain and malt. Not sure what fruit, exactly - maybe some apricot or citrus. Taste is similar - stronger than expected, although not really particularly good. Sort of a dirtiness that comes along with the too-strong carbonation. Overall, its not a terrible beer, but not one I'd go back to quickly."
"Too carbonated. Not good, but not horrible. I can't believe people traded a Firestone 10 for this one."
"This is a pretty bland, inoffensive, but not terribly interesting beer. It's cheap, which is nice."
"Overall a plain ale with a predominantly macro feel."
"D - I scored the drinkability high because I could see myself grabbing it again and again on a summer day. It's light and tasty."
"Drinkability: All around above average for me, but nothing more. Could definitely have a few of these. Though it does lack a lot of flavor, maybe I've just never had a great version of the style, because I find many of them this way. A step above a BMC brew for a solid lawn-mowing beer."
"OK, but I had far worst beers, its a good beer thats worth a try, just not what I expected."
"The Overall Impressions section at BJCP on this beer states, ""To the untrained taster easily mistaken for a light lager, a somewhat subtle Pilsner, or perhaps a blonde ale."" And I thought exactly that on the Pils side, though I've had others of the style that tend toward a little more character."
"A very drinkable beer, particularly if you like hops. Not the lightest tasting kolsch-style beer, and much more reminiscent of a german pils."
"More drinkable than say a Budweiser, this has a bit more flavor. No a great beer but good for its stated purpose of Summer Brew."
"Note: Sorry, I got the name a bit wrong. It should be ""JosephsBrau Summer Brew"" like their other Trader Joe's contract beers."
