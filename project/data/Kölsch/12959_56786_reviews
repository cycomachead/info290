"A little disappointed in this one as I generally love CL, however, this was just an OK Kolsch."

"Comes to the table in a tall cylinder a slightly hazy light golden color with a decent sized bubbly white head. Sweet bready pilsner malt with spicy floral hops to balance. Sweet bready flavor, nice crisp hop bite. Great little beer."

"Overall:  Good summer beer. No need to rush out and buy more right away, nor does it being me back to several fun nights I spent in Cologne Germany drinking kolsch, but a nice beer"

"My pour netted me a brief, fizzy finger of bone-white head that faded like anything colored red when exposed to bright, unrelenting sunlight. Color was a light, lemon-yellow (SRM = > 2, < 4) with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a malty quality, not very hoppy, despite what they said on the label. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was very light, almost like lemon-lime soda pop. Lemony, slightly grassy, very dry and refreshing. They were right on the money in terms of the style and I think that I would enjoy it much more on a hot, humid summer's day than a cold, dry winter's one. The finish was equally light and crisp and I would be reaching for another except that I only had one."

"O - Great example of the style. Really glad I got this in a trade because it would have been easy to overlook otherwise. But a tasty treat indeed."

"Overall - Really well done and very refreshing. I haven't had many beers from this brewer, but I will search some out based on this brew. Reminds me a bit of prima pils by victory."

"O-nice for this style, refreshing on a hot day"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: An excellent kolsch -- makes me want to brew one!"
""
""
""
"Disappointing. The sweetness was a bit much, but the DMS is too much."
""
""
""
""
"Poured into stange. Pale yellow and fizzy, clear with a thin fizzy head that fades into nothing pretty quickly. Smell is crisp and clean, malty and dry with slight wine-like scents. Taste is light and crisp, slightly dry with some few grassy and piney hops at the end giving a refreshing finish. Mouthfeel is clean and a bit dry."
""
""
"This beer has almost no nose. The malt is but a sweetness in the breath of it. It catches the light aflame because of it's haze. The crown is white. Only a shy depth from the grain will come to the nose. Taste is breaddy, a slight bitterness and only a whisper of herbal from hops. Very dry crisp.. You can barely perceive a fruity lightness from the grain because the malt is crisp and dramatic. In the finish it gives a slight pucker ."
""
""
"Poured clear with a small white head that dissipated quickly, all of which are common to this style. Light malty smell that mixed with a very light fruit undertone. Taste was good- a little malty for this style but still good. Overall a good beer for a summer day."
""
"Pours a light, clear gold with a thick, foamy head. You can smell some wheat notes, but nothing thick. Everything about this screams ""clean"" and it pays off when you raise the glass to taste it. It's fairly light-bodied; maybe heavy for style, but to the world of craft beer it's fairly nimble. There is a bit of sweetness to it that really would pair amazingly well with classic German foods like a brat with sauerkraut. In fact, why the hell am I not eating that right now? Damnit."
""
"Light and airy head of a bit over one finger, bone white, mainly small to medium sized bubbles, dissolves away swiftly to a patchy surface coating, no real lacing to speak of. Perfectly clear liquid, bright yellow, consistently hued throughout, loosely strewn bubbles of good fatness slowly bubble upwards. The nose is full of hard country bread crust, salted pretzels, quinine, minerals and cut grass but on the other hand, banana, bubblegum and sour orange to lemon citrus, honey, nothing floral nor broadly fruity about it, ends on a pepper and salt note. It’s medium-bodied with a creamy entry which slowly stiffens into a firmer presentation of bread, grains, corn muffins and biscuits and more of that mineral water, saline stuff. More floral and added peach, apricot fruit, the syrupy texture helps the sweetness persist. Maybe a pinch of cocoa. It’s satisfying more in a warm your belly way than refresh you after mowing the lawn way. As with many, seems like it wants to please too many disparate expectations and thus suffers from lack of clear purpose. But no problem throwing back a couple."
""
""
""
""
"It's got some very impressive qualities for a Kolsch but the taste is fleeting and only on the finish. It doesn't really fill the mouth either unlike most great Kolsch's I've had. It's still a very solid easy drinking go to Kolsch for sure. But I wont be knocking down barriers to get at it."
""
""
""
""
"Been wanting to try this for a while now. This does strike me as a kölsch (which is an under-represented style in the US). It's a bit thicker than its German counterparts though. That's fine though. It still touches on the flavors that it should. Easy to drink. Though if I was going to ""improve"" it, I'd say thin out the flavors a bit."
"Disclaimer- I love the liquid gold! No disrespect to captain Lawrence"

"overall - light body and flavor, but in a good way. would be a good summer beer."
""
""
""
"O: A crisp refreshing beer that'll quench your thirst on hot day while bring more flavor that light lager. I'd enjoy this liberally at a summer cookout or with a hotdog at a ball game myself. Definitely a hybrid with one foot in the Lager category and the other in the Ale."
""
""
""
"Pours a clear light golden with a thin white head. Some retention, and a good lace. Aroma is of grainy malts, and grassy hops. Body is light and crisp with some carbonation. Taste is sweet and honey like with a hint of hops in the finish. Very nice version of this style."
""
"O- what a home run of an everyday beer. This is the best kolsch I have ever had. This might be my new lawn mower beer for the summertime. But wow this could become a simple go to beer when I'm at the store. Keep it coming vacarro!"
""
""
""
"O: I’d be hard pressed to find a beer easier to drink than this. Pleasant and refreshing. I will be re-visiting this during the summer."
"T: Overall solid and refreshing, finish is a bit bland."
""
"Overall: Super clean..excellent hoppy finish...perhaps my second favorite Kolsch only behind New Holland's. This is one I could drink all day."
""
""
""

"Easily a Top 3 Kolsch in my book. Great intro to Captain Lawrence."

"A very tasty kolsch that went very well with dinner."
"Medium-light bodied; nice carbonation; excellent crispness and refreshing qualities. A strong, traditional take on the Kolsch style."
"It's a Kolsch. Not really my bag. Light straw-yellow pour, clear, with a thin bubbly head; no real retention or lacing to speak of. Aroma is grainy, scents of pale malts and light hops. Kolschy. Mass-appealing. Light taste, corn, grains, slightly toasty, pils malts, baking yeast (?), grassy hops. Kolschy. Thin body with a bitter aftertaste. Light beers like this just aren't my thing. Once in a while I find one that is pretty good, but this really wasn't too memorable."
"The Kolsch style doesn't demand much, yet it is rarely done well. CL manages to hit the mark. Clear gold with a pure white head. Light grainy, balanced cereal flavor with a clean lemon thyme hop note. Lightly yeasty flavor like the aroma of sourdough starter. Clean and dry. It won't hold your interest, but it's a nice beer to start the night with."
"i used to refuse drinking kolsch style beers, but this is definitely an eye opener that the style has its ups apparently!"
""
""
""
"Overall I am not a big fan of this Kolsch. Like many other of CL Belgian/European style offerings, there yeast strain is extraordinarily phenolic and dominant and makes the beer unbalanced and just tastes generically Belgian and yeasty."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours clear golden color with 1/4 inch fluffy white foam. Citrussy beer smell. Full bodied, yet clean, walls of citrus throughout. Leaves a light bitter finish. There is a ligh sweetness behind the opening tart/lemon rind. Nice light summr kolsch."
"Overall: a non-traditional but tasty and refreshing Kölsch. I'll definitely have this again, given the opportunity."
""
""
""
"Toasted bread malts up front. Peppery, spicy hop bitterness comes on soon enough though. Bready malt becomes sweeter, with notes of apple and honey. Hints of coriander and maybe citrus (lemongrass?). Herbal, peppery hops take it to the finish, which is oh so dry and refreshing. Lingering sea air hops and peppercorns. Moderate body, with a lively, refreshing feel. A great summer quencher and a nice hoppy twist on an under-appreciated style."
""
""
""
"Overall: Par for the course with Captain Lawrence: lots of flavor, really well balanced. Awesome hot weather beer as well."
""
""
"Overall this is a great summer beer. It's crisp and clean and more complex than other beers I've had in the style (which is admittedly few). Will buy again."
""
""
""
"Overall I had the ""liquid gold"" yet to try but this was way better than that DIPA they made. Great flavors and easy on the palate."
"O - I wasn't expecting to be blown away by this one, but I kind of was. Extremely delicious hot weather beer full of flavor. I'm a noob to the kolsch style, but this is a winner in my book. So glad to have this in six pack format."
""
""
""
"Cool crisp bite to this. Carbonation level uplifts this ""light"" beer making this one quite zippy and refreshing. Great flavor profile of mild bittering hops, grass, fresh bread - all melded together beautifully. This beer really hit the spot. Were this a local offering, I'd have a sixer of this on hand most anytime during these warm months. Cheers, Todd! Thanks for the hookup!"
""
"O-A great Kolsch, a beer style I've never bond fond of until this one."
"O: A fantastic summer beer, probably going to drink many more of these this summer. I'm happy these guys are basically in my backyard."
""
"Not a very thrilling drinking experience, as the color is disappointingly pale and the mouthfeel is fairly foamy."
"O/D-The Kolsch style is great for the warm weather. This beer is light but it is complex and a nice sip. I found this to be a solid beer. I love the company. This is a great summer brew. Won't blow you away but miles away from subpar."
""
""
""
"The mouthful was full and smooth with a small but enjoyable aftertaste."
""
"O: A very nice and refreshing beer. Easily sessionable. More great work by Captain Lawrence. Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
"o - overall, pretty good for a style that I don't always love. This one was very easy too drink. Well done by the captain!"
"Very good light summer brew. Light dry malt with a good dose of grassy hops."
""
""
"I could easily throw back a few of these on a hot, summer day. Having said that, I remember this being a little better in the tap room. Still a solid American take on the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is crisp and clean. Taste is fruity...a bit of hops. Bread like malty finish. I havent had many Kolsch brews, except in Germany, and those were a bit more malty and bitter, so its hard to compare the style, but this is fantastic. I love a nice brew from CL, and this did not disappoint at all. In fact, its fantastic."
""
""
""

""

"The beer arrives essentially clear with a golden hue and a few centimeters white foam. The aroma is of lightly toasted malt with lots of bread and some huskiness. This continues on to the palate, with a touch of sweetness. Smooth as it roils across. A vague fruitiness emerges as the beer warms. This beer is, perhaps, not as clean as a Kolsch should be, but still plenty enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel was very light a crisp, with a light body, a light, thin and almost watery feel and a refreshing overall experience. This beer is highly drinkable, tasty and a fine session beer that is on par for this style with much better than average flavor. Definitely worth a try, especially if you like this light and easy drinking style."
"O - This has pretty good drinkability. It goes down easy, and is a nice refreshing beer for a hot summer day. Overall, I thought this was a nice beer. While not one of my favorite styles, I thought this one stood out a little more to me than others I have had in the past. I recommend giving it a shot."
"A marvelous beer, highly recommended, I guess those who like this style in southeast/southwest/northwest parts of country will need to trade for a growler."
"I was in line at the CL brewery buying a growler of their Pale Ale and wondered out loud what my second growler should be... a guy there for free samples recommended the Kolsch. It's not usually my style but I had a sample myself and was pleasantly surprised. It's a bit sweet to start but somehow finishes dry and refrshing -- a neat trick that I have no idea how the brewmaster accomplishes, but it works. I do still prefer CL's hoppier recipes but this is a great summer beer and as one of those that makes you think ""This must be what real beer used to taste like."""
"M&d: as expected, ligh mouth. Excelllent drinkability. Kolschs are the shit and this is an excellent example."
"My first try of the style...so can't make a comparison, but I truly enjoyed this beer. I had it on a cold, rainy, what should have been spring day, and it made me think of sand, sun and summer. Poured beautifully, with a nice thick foamy white head. Clean smelling coming across like ""beer""; kinda pure. Taste was sweet and crisp....and very, very drinkable. At 5.5%, the presence of alcohol was almost non existent and after two 10 oz glasses, I felt like I could drink a whole bunch more. I didn't however....I saved it for after dinner...I'll be revisiting this plenty over the coming months."
"Overall: I'm really digging Kolsch and I'm going to have to keep making an effort to find it. I'm definitely going to be brewing a Kolsch for this summer. I am starting to think that Kolsch doesn't get the respect it deserves from beer geeks. Captain Lawrence always does a good job brewing and this is no exception. Certainly worth a try. Cheers!"
"Beer is thin and watery, the finish of the beer is oddly bitter, out of place, there is no effort to connect the pilsen malt with the hop presence in the beer and it falls apart in my opinion. There are much much better kolsches out there, skip this one."
"O: The beer is very easy to drink and has some refreshing properties. It's a lot more flavorful compared to other beers in the style."
"Pours a light yellow color with a pretty good white head. Decent retention and a bit of lacing as it goes down. The nose brings forward some light grain and very faint hops, but also brings forward an unfortunate DMS presence that is reminiscent of creamed corn and a bit of soaked cabbage. Luckily, it wasn't terribly overwhelming. The taste is along the same lines and it's tough to get past, though there are some nice element sin the background. Feel is light and fairly crisp. Other than the DMS issue, a really drinkable brew."
"The beer appears transparent and light yellow in color. The white head is a quarter inch thick and leaves a fair amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma is of mild citrus and lightly toasted bread. The beer is fairly well balanced and light on the palate. The flavor has a subtle oddness about it, reminiscent of over-cooked vegetables. This is masked to some degree by the more pleasant flavors the beer has to offer. This would be a decent warm weather beer."
"A friend who I introduced to this beer described it as bottled joy."
"M/D: Light to medium bodied with nice carbonation that keeps it crisp. Overall I quite enjoyed this beer. Very refreshing, a great beer to kick back with on a hot day..or a rainy evening with a burger as I did."
"Drinkability -- Overall, pretty refreshing, though I'm curious as to whether the tinge of funky tartness was intentional, a defect, or caused by poor growler maintenance."
"D: Pretty drinkable beer, nice mix of flavors, a bit darker for a Kolsch, but it was still tastey."
"This might be one of the best Summer beers on the East Coast and one of the best Kölsch stylings brewed outside of Germany."
"d - A very drinkable beer from Captain Lawrence. Would give another shot."
"Orange yellow in color carbonated and bubbly on tap at the applebees near captain lawrence CdC eve it very nice to see this here. Smell is full of light wheat and fruit orange and lemon predominantly, but not much going on overall. Taste has a phenolic alcohol quality to it up front with orange lemon and what at the back and a pepperiness as it finishes. Mouthfeel is smooth and light. I had a couple and would have many more given the chance."
"I can't believe how long it took me to try this beer. Captain Lawrence is local and one of my favorite breweries and Kolsch is one of my favorite styles. I liked this a lot. Didn't love it but I defiinitely liked it. Typical of Kolsch, it was light in color and a bit cloudy. Great aroma, good flavor and a great mix of malt and hops. I'll have it again."
"Thanks to Thirstybird for sharing. Poured a translucent orange-gold with a quarter inch loose, white head. Nose is herbal - something of a minty character and a bit of citrus. Taste follows nose - herbal quality is a bit more muted and some biscuity notes come out in the middle, with the herbal quality coming out again at the finish. Mouthfeel is light-bodied, with an easy carbonation. All and all, a very light, easy drinking, flavorful and refreshing. Slightly off-center for the style, but quite quaffable and tasty."
"I don't think I've ever had a Kolsch before. I had to consult BA to see if Kolsches were lagers or ales. As mentioned above, this beer had alot of lager properties but the fruitiness and the 'bigger' mouthfeel made this very enjoyable. Another great beer by CL! Thanks, sis!"
"D- What a surprise, another solid brew from CL. I have really embraced the sessionable beers lately. This is a solid, yet interesting off from CL, nothing extreme or high hops or ABV, just a tastey brew. Try it."
"The beer is nicely sweet with basically no notable hops present. Very easy to drink."
"Another pleasant Captain Lawrence brew that makes me glad I have a regular growler connection in the area."
"D - great for the style, nice to finally have a Kolsch worth drinking more than once. pairs nice with some lighter cuisine, salad and chicken."
"This to me embodies the German spirit of brewing: keep it clean, but pack it with plenty of flavor. This tastes conditioned and fresh at the same time. Great work, yet again, from the Captain aka Scott Vaccaro. This guy is a real blessing to the NYC area beer crowd."
"Overall, my perfect idea of a subtle, flavorful, yet easy-drinking summer beer."
"Cheers!"
"Very drinkable, extremely light pleasant mouthfeel. Perfect for an afternoon by the pool."
"Overall a very tasty kolsch."
"Overall very, very good. One of the better examples of the style I have had in a very long time. With the summer heat coming up one can only hope that this one becomes a staple!"
"Having said that, I still will get growlers of this regularly to enjoy as the weather warms up a bit more. Another hit for the Captain, and I think that this beer will help a lot of beer novices open up to some of their more obscure or aggressive styles."
"D: Unlike drseamus I waited till it was 80 out to crack this. This was supposed to be my Yankees Red Sox 2010 opener beer but it was too nice out not to drink this. I really loved this beer. This is a solid yet boring hit from Captain Lawrence. Something I would get a keg of during the summer if my better half did not hate the style. More on tap in the summer outdoors please."
"D: Joe, you were right. This is a fantastic beer! This growler arrived just in time for me to sit on my balcony and enjoy temps in the 70's...in March...in Chicago. Brilliant!"
"Mini growler fill from DeCicco's in Ardsley, NY. New beer from the good captain is always an treat and this journey to a new style is an interesting move, guess it makes sense for spring/summer...anyway this one pours moderatly hazed, yellowish amber, under an off white head that lasts, and leaves nice amounts of light sheeting/lace. Light/delicate nose of straw and lemon. Citrusy, light and refreshing brew. More lemon, light grassy and refreshing brew. I cant say I am real familiar with the style, but this is seemingly well balanced and highly sessionable. Bring on spring/summer and lighter beers like this one."
"D: Why the hell would they release a goddamned kolsch in the middle of the winter? This is a summer beer Scott!! The rosso release was brutal and nothing goes better with brutal cold than a kolsch...no wait, I meant any other beer besides a kolsch. I'll be generous and grade it as if it was a nice hot day outside."
"Kaptains Kolsch is kolschy looking with a bright deep yellow with some gold trimmings squeezed in for some slightly darker colors. A nice billowy white head. Scattered lace. Smells of grain, hay, earthy hops, lemons, sweet malt. The taste is pretty much the same but maybe not in that order. The feel is light with lively carb and clean as a baby's... I would and will get this again, easy drinking low abv and taste. Not as good as my go to Kolsch, Yellowtail, but this hits the marks."
"Drinkability is first rate. Refreshing and quite the quaffer. This is a top notch session beer and one I hope to see at the Captain often."
"The mouthfeel is light bodied, but has more substance than the color suggests. A refreshing level of carbonation and the general, simple character makes this a very drinkable beer. It really started to grow on me by the second glass. I would get this again."
