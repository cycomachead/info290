This beer really opens up and its floral, has a great softness due to the water they use, and it has a slight sweetness and bitterness thats perfectly balanced. Overall a great beer for session or whatever. Perfect for all seasons.","KWD","Dec 13, 2013"

Favor presents with a grainy start, biscuity, vinous middle and clean, mildly hoppy finish. Mouthfeel is light and co2is generous. had this beer on tap the night before this review and have to say on tap is definitely better. Overall, a decent Kolsch and a good crossover brew for the mid-south.","EagleTalon","Nov 13, 2012"

Over a nice kolsch, I would get this again.","tronester","Oct 23, 2012"

To me this is a good night out , day at the lake, mowing the lawn kind of beer. Far better than the mass produced St Louis Swill , nothing to sit around and sip on at the house or share for a special moment , but a good summer time hot weather beer to enjoy.","ubenumber2","0"

3.33,-3.8,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"O: In no way does Ghost River's Golden Ale resemble a traditional Kolsch, though it didn't prevent me from moderately enjoying it. This actually comes off like a cream ale, not too dissimilar to Sixpoint's Sweet Action. If you're looking for a reasonably flavorful craft session option, this would most likely deliver your fix.","Rhettroactive","Jan 12, 2012"

I don't think it's quite a kolsch and may be more of a blonde or even a cream ale in thinking of it. Not spectacular, maybe a good starter beer for those who might start drinking craft/imported non fizzy yellow water...","jerryjeff","0"

Mouth feel is sharp and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, slight citrus hops, hint of wheat, and grain. Overall, average Kolsch, at best.","Tone","Apr 19, 2009"
