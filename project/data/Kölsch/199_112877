3.78,8,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.75,"BOD 177/14.  Pours a clear light amber (golden).  Above average head volume, excellent lacing and retention.  Light nose of fruity esters and yeast over a biscuit base with a hint of spice. Almost light medium body with a nice slick texture.  Slightly below normal carbonation with just a touch of effervescence in the finish.  The flavor profile is quite nice for a Kolsch.  Above average intensity for the style, well balanced and fairly complex.  It begins with a mix of light fruit (banana, pear) that flows into a somewhat crisp biscuit sweetness.  The middle is a very mild hop bitterness that is herbal in nature that yields to a slight note of pepper like spice. The finish is a slow fade of herbal bitterness and biscuit that ends with a touch of dryness.","tillmac62","Dec 04, 2014"

Highly carbonated, so the toasted malt doesn't weigh it down. Very drinkable, but nothing outstanding. More malty than most examples of the style.","barczar","Sep 30, 2014"

I was taken a bit off guard at first, as I was not expecting a Klosch Style Ale, but rather something along the lines of a American Pale Ale (I failed to see the small print that denoted the beer as ""Klosch Style"").

The label does say in small letters ""Kolsch Style Ale", and I wonder if this was added to account for the fruitiness, or if this was intentional. I'd drink more of these, but might not seek it out.","MerkinMan","May 16, 2014"

The aroma is musty yet clean, like a freshly scrubbed beach house. The flavor has a nice balance of herbal, slightly lemony hops over a bed of light, biscuity malts that provide a note of sweetness. The fine carbonation, medium resinous body and drying finish all act to weigh down the flavors rather than lift them up, though. Overall, however, this is a light and drinkable yet satisfying beer that I would gladly reach for again.","devilben02","Mar 05, 2014"
