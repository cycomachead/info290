Available in bottles and cans, it is a great go-to beer for the beach, the lake, the park, the backyard, cooking in the kitchen, watching Popeye in the living room, sneaking into the movies, walking around town, getting drunk in a fancy restaurant, drinking in a dive bar, playing foosball, hiding out in a treehouse, camping in the middle of nowhere, anywhere. Great beer. Summer is a good season overall too.","Pigs","Jun 08, 2014"

There’s a great deal maltiness up front as I smell it, with lemon peel and orange rind in the background. Taste is very similar to a classic pilsner, except for some more pronounced herbal and spicy qualities to the hops. Low bitterness, crackery malt on the tongue, dry grass, but flavours do not linger. The finish is fairly dry. Overall it’s not a bad thirst-quencher for the warmer months, but it doesn’t have any one quality that makes it stand out.","greenmtn1111","Aug 04, 2013"

A lot of people rave about the taste of this one, and my guess is that many of them are simply happy to find a ""summer"" beer without the typical flavors (fruit, wheat, yeast, etc.) and instead a beer with some dryness. Other than for the fact that it is a bit more thin than beers one might drink in the autumn months, there's nothing special here, and certainly nothing that makes me think this is an ideal beer to consume during warm summer months. Yes, it's ""crisp"" and on the lighter side, but it's just not that interesting. A decent example of a Kolsch and a decent summer beer--but not something I would consider purchasing again at $9.49/six pack.","DeFaz","Jul 08, 2013"

Pours a lightly cloudy golden straw color with a nice 1-2 finger fluffy white head with nice retention, that reduces to a good cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of pear, bread, lemon, cracker, herbal, grass, floral, light pepper, and earthy spiciness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance, but they are quite muted. Taste of lemon zest, pear, bread, cracker, herbal, floral, grass, light pepper, and earthy spiciness. Light spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of pear, lemon, bread, herbal, grass, and pepper on the finish for a short bit. Nice balance of flavors, with a good malt/hop balance; a touch watered down; zero cloying flavors after the finish as expected. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a nice kolsch. Nice flavor balance and very smooth to drink. A pleasantly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Beers"

The taste has a faint lemon taste upfront followed by a nice peppery flavor on the back of the tongue. The mouthfeel is very nice and smooth, not to overly carbonated, over all this is a average Kolsch, but a nice and easy drinking one.","chefhatt","Aug 26, 2012"

Light doughy malt, mild lemony hops, maybe a touch of fruity yeast character? While all the right flavor notes are present, this just doesn't have the right combination. This is mirrored on the palate, where the same flavors but the same lack of definition is present, along with a faint buttery note. Light in body, crisply carbonated and dry and refreshing on the finish, this beer is nice, worthy even, but not all that it could be. Recommended.","DefenCorps","Aug 13, 2012"

Some thin clusters of lacing are evident during the tasting. Nose is very clean - just the merest suggestion of wheat and citrus. Taste reveals light toasted wheat, mild citrus notes and a slight buttery quality that nicely intermingles before culminating in a fairly clean finish. Mouthfeel is light in body with a an even carbonation that adds just a little additional depth to the consistency. Overall, I know this may not be the best, most style consistent Kolsch out there, but I love this beer in the summer and really think the canned version is far superior to the bottle. This is one of my summer staples.","Jwale73","Jul 02, 2012"

4.07,15.3,3.5,4,4,4,4.5," The flavor is very refreshing and balanced in the best way possible. The taste has a nice floral hop which is almost tea-like in the foreground with slight toasted malt presence with some gentle sweet elements that move more toward yeast flavors which seem like light grape or golden pear in the finish with some of the herbal hops and spice flavors lingering after the swallow. This is a good beer to call Summer beer, it is interesting, flavorful and quaffable, yet not an ideal Kolsch in the traditional sense. It is a very good American interpretation of the style. I will certainly have to find this on tap sometime soon.","Slatetank","Jun 05, 2012"

Maybe this comes from the idea that it smells like cleaning product but the fruity taste dominates. There might be some hop bite on the back end of a swig but it really is dulled. Very refreshing but not substantial. Pleasing, but not memorable.

The nose detects crisp citrus wheat and tart yeast. Not bad for the style. The flavor brings on a bit of a malty yeast and more of that citrus wheat crispness. Although it is relatively light and refreshing as one would hope and expect, I am very pleasantly surprised by the full feel that washes over the tongue, frothy and sort of stick to your ribs as summer ales go. It has a little bite of tartness and settles pretty nicely into a bready mouthful with lemon-herbal hop highlights. Not sweet, but highly drinkable as one might hope.

Pours a straw-yellow body with nearly an inch of white-ish head. Smells fruity - lemon in particular comes to mind - with some spice, vanilla, and floral notes. Lemon and pulp hit the palate initially, with some restrained floral and spice notes and a mostly clean finish. Light and effervescent in nature - an easy drinker for sure on a 90+ degree day like today. A great summer seasonal - simple and balanced but with a little complexity to keep things interesting.

Mouthfeel was medium with a very grassy taste on the tongue. Finish was bone-dry, just the way I like my Kolschs. Phew! Gad, but this was extra dry, like ginger ale or antiperspirant.

Taste is slightly citrusy,l bittersweet and very dry. What bitterness there is, is in the finish, it is more puckering then bitter and finishes super dry. This is a good brew for summer, excepting for the dry finish which really detracts from being a good thirst quencher. Good brew but I wouldn't call it summer per se.

A bit of bite on it from hops, more than you'd think given the appearance. Decent mouthfeel for something so light, and very drinkable for the summer months.

Smell has a bit of spice to it. The taste is very good, and it is a very easy drinking beer. Unlike other summers, this beer doesn't try to get all fancy with lots of ingredients.

After tasting the beer, I still thought it was Bud, so I asked if they mixed up the order. Indeed it was the correct beer. I was disappointed because Harpoon usually puts out decent beer, but this one is terrible. The color is golden yellow like that of a macrobrew and it leaves a decent lacing. The smell is nothing special, typical hops and smells of canned beer. The taste was similar to macro pilsners like PBR. Won't be drinking this one again.","soxfanshawn","Jun 12, 2007"

3.75,6.2,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Poured into the Collins glass a bright yellow with a rocky head that lasted a minute or so while leaving lace on most of the cylinder. Some citrus in the nose. The taste was crispy and refreshing with some additional citrus flavor, almost zesty. Mouthfeel was medium with good carbonation keeping it lively. Is it the Collins glass or does this beer dissapear rather quickly? The glass holds about 12 oz, so it must be me. This beer has summer session written all over it for the spouse and me.","pentathlete","Aug 14, 2004"
3.64,3.1,4,2.5,4,4,4,"Damn shame, too, since the lemon nature is amped down in the flavor for a nicely mixed middle (after a citrus attack.) Lovely mouthfilling fine carbonation makes it gulpable without pain. Yes, a light body but with PRESENCE, something the rice/corn guys could learn from. Finish is full of lingering malt, citrus, butter and bitter. I think AB/SAB drinkers would really enjoy this; it could be a gateway beer (those guys rarely smell their beer.)","ecoboy","Aug 14, 2004"

Golden and lively. The aroma yields pleasant notes of sweet and fresh nutty grains, pine and just a hint of caramel butter. The taste is very pleasing. Light, yet flavorful with a slightly sweet and bitter tang finish. Wow, this is an excellent beer! A great Americanized version of a German Kolsch beer. Crisp, clean and could be the near perfect summer beer. Left me wanting more!","pezoids","Jul 19, 2004"

Nice taste, mostly sweet lemon (like some type of lemon/sugar candy) with some hops towards the finish. The mouthfeel is a little sickly sweet for my taste, though, but maybe that's just a function of the style. Real easy drinking, great for relaxing on a summer's day.

3.88,9.9,4,3.5,4,3,4.5,"A very nice beer... indeed. Figured I would try this one out, since I usually dig their other seasonal brews. I really liked the taste of it. It kind of started off as a lighter, hoppier brew, but then switched over to a semi-malty, medium bodied brew. Ofcourse there was the presence of citrus fruits and other lighter tropical fruits, along with the little bite of hops. The head was nice, started out very frothy and thick, but then flattened out to a fairly thick laceing. I would classify this as my new favorite ""lawnmower"" beer. Very refreshing and would be great to have after work.","JISurfer","May 28, 2004"

Smell consisted of grains, hops, lemon citrus type aromas, and some wheat in there as well. Taste was pretty good. Gentle hops attack the palate with some grainy tastes as well with an underlying sweetness that holds true to the kolsch style. Aftertaste was mostly that sweet taste, but wasn't too bad. This is a great session beer.","necoadam","May 21, 2004"

The smell is of mild hops with a slightly fruity smell that seems a bit of the pulpy variety. The flavor is truly Kolsch with a bit of bite from the hops covering the underlying sweetness. The feel is a bit weak with little crispness. Good drinkability from the medium feel; refreshing.","AtLagerHeads","May 17, 2004"

There is little in the line of hops, but it is true to style. The taste is decent. It has a grainy pale malt flavor with a clean finish. It is a bit dry, with a slight fruitiness. The mouthfeel is good. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a fine summer brew. It goes down easy. It's light and refreshing on those hot summer days.","WesWes","May 14, 2004"

It pours very yellow/golden with a rather large head that has some yeast in it. The beer has little smell other than a slight tendancy towards the citrus. It tastes light and wheaty with a background hint of orange peel, lime peel or lemon peel (it's hard to tell). It is very light and easy to drink, best served relatively cold. I recommend this for drinking outside during the summer, especially if you are planning on putting back more than one.","chugamugofsud","Apr 26, 2004"

Taste: Completely refreshing just plain good for summer beer drinking, touch of lemon peel and other fruity qualities are here lemon grass hops with pale malts pretty bitter in flavor but there's a firm hand on balance here. Mouthfeel: Light bodied higher caronation but smooth.

Gold color, very clear, and somewhat darked than a pilsner. Smell was clean and lagerish, with minimal hops. Taste was also clean and light, very crisp with some hops presence, but I can't tell the type. Lingering grassy hop flavor. Very clean, quite refreshing drink. High drinkability despite kind of high carbonation. Overall this beer was nothing spectacular, but a nice beer for a hot day sitting on my roof.","Erix","Sep 05, 2003"
3.4,-3.7,3,3,3.5,3,4,"Light, crisp, refreshing. It is a very drinkable session brew, but the flavor is lacking a bit. A good balance of sweet malts with just enough hops to balance and take the wheel for a bit. Breads come in at the end.

4.07,15.3,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"This beer poured a crystal clear lemony yellow color with a decent amount of carbonation. The head that was produced was fairly thin but dense when first poured then settled to a light skim on the top of the beer. It was white in color and produced a watery - spotty lace. The aromas that were produced were of fresh hops (flowers, spices), citrus fruit (lemon), and wheat grains. An aroma that came across crisp and precise, each note of aroma was pronounced so that you could identify it. The flavors were crisp and refreshing, tastes of fresh hops, grass/hay, lemon fruit, light sweet malt and pronounced wheat grains. Medium bodied. Slightly bitter on the tongue but not overly, a bit dry but not overly. I guess what is being said is, that it is a well balanced beer. Crisp, clean, well carbonated and refreshing. A perfect summertime beer. Very good example of its style. I would definitely get again.","Jarod","Aug 08, 2003"

3.83,8.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,4,"This summer ale poured a clear, golden yellow color with creamy, bright white foam that settled but left some lace.

The mouthfeel was smooth and almost creamy, but with a crisp finish. There was a lingering hoppy bitterness on the tongue. The body was medium. This was a nice summer beer, though a cleaner finish might have been preferred.","UncleJimbo","Jul 12, 2003"
3.63,2.8,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"The bottle pours a crystal-clear straw-gold body beneath a fluffy head of bright-white froth. The head retention is good, and it maintains a half-inch or so of big-bubbled foam throughout most of the glass. Additionally, the lacing is quite nice, and it leaves some fairly solid rings at the outset. The nose displays a grainy, wheatish malt with some background floral, grassy, and even spicy hops. There's a mild note of lemon as well, but it's not clear as to where it's coming from. In the mouth it's medium bodied with a gentle tingle on the tongue; and the flavor delivers the sweetish, grainy, and wheat-like malt that the aroma promises. It's backed by a subdued, underlying bitterness (and some very mild hop flavor) that helps to dry the finish which lingers shortly with some grainy maltiness. It's certainly fuller-bodied and more malty in the flavor than a Kolsch from Koln or the Bonn region, and even less hoppy; but it's still a decent summer beer!","NeroFiddled","Jul 07, 2003"

The taste matches the aroma with a nice malt start and the hints of spices and citrus. I noticed a slight off taste toward the end, other than that is has a crisp finish. A light body makes this easy to drink. Nothing to special with this kolsch. A slight bit above average.","Stubbie1","Apr 17, 2003"

Lightly grainy malt aroma w/ a slightly spicy noble hop nose, perhaps from a Saaz / Spalt combination.  Slightly tart wheat & clean, appropriately light hop bitterness gives way to smooth and lightly bready malt.  Clean, refined, and true to style.  Moderately bodied, w/ an agreeable mouthfeel that helps lend excellent drinkability.  Although secondary, hop flavor is perceptibly grassy and a bit spicy.  Finishes w/ pleasant grainy base malt flavors quickly fading.  Harpoon Summer Beer is a definitive example of a Kolsch.  It's highly drinkable and soft on the palette, but not at all bland.","marc77","Jul 11, 2002"
