"Serving type: bottle."
"O- a decent take on the style, easy to drink but nothing really stands out"
""
""

"12 oz bottle (date stamp BB 31 Oct. 2014) poured dark golden with loads of visible carbonation and excellent clarity.  Durable creamy, off-white head. Great looking but all downhill from here, from the grassy but seemingly stale aroma to the disparate mix of hop flavors.  Mouthfeel is light, as expected, and OK."

"o: Decent enough kolsch, that is an ale almost masquerading as a lager with some extra heft to it. One reviewer below called it boring and that underscores the lack of much distinctive taste. Better than most mainstream lagers though, a good warm weather refresher if you like something with a bit more presence than most pilseners or light lagers. However you may find other kolsches with more fruit tones than this one."
""
"Like most Saranac beers, this isn't ""good"" per se, it's just drinkable, and about average to below average for the style. It worked well for it's use (drinking at a BBQ) but I don't think I'd ever get it again."
""
"A drinkable yet mostly forgettable beer. Lightweight and weak in the flavor and feel and just doesn't leave you fire-up for more."

"A lot more lemony notes in the flavor, but they're still muddled by lager-like pale grain staleness and adjunct notes of rice. Underlying Euro flairs lean toward Germany, but get lost in the fray of cheapness. The intent is decent, I suppose, but there's no real punch other than a burst of crisp bubble and light bitterness in the forefront. All of that gets pushed aside with a half-toasted grainy middle and finishing with stints of sweet wort, fusel, and nut flesh. At least it's light-bodied and somewhat refreshing. Easy, maybe. Eh... could be worse."
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours straw color with a tiny white head that leaves some lacing. Smells of sweet grain that is very inviting. Tastes of very sweet grain and very slight berries. Beer light bodied and heavily carbonated, nice crisp finish. Overall, an above average beer."

"Aroma is grassy. Pours clear orange body with an inch of beige head. Head dissipates almost immediately to a thin ring with hardly any lace. Taste is a bit bland, like lemongrass tea with a slight bitter bite on the finish. A good summer choice, very drinkable but not particularly notable!"
"Taste is pleasant, tasty grain and grassy hops & slightly zesty but a bit soapy and rough and thin and a bit gummy. It's kind of like a basic pale lager with an extra zing."
"It has a nice body; fluffy, soft, light, creamy but crisp, and quite dry."
""
""
"Overall – Nothing too special here. Nothing wrong with it, but nothing special either."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours blonde, clear, thin ring of head with little lace. Smells like buttered bread, pale malts and yeast. The taste mirrors the smell with a little more yeast taste as it warms. Medium body which kinda saves the beer for me. Just a very simple beer if I was out on deck on a hot day mabye this would be refreshing. Its ok just in the mood for somthing more complex."

"True to style? hahahah, no. Good summer drinking? You BET!"
"O - Not one of Saranac's best, the other bottle from the sampler will probably sit in my fridge for a while. Not in any rush to drink it. It's not an offensive beer or anything, it's just not that good. The flavor itself actually isn't bad, it's just so damn weak. Increase the flavor, and this could be a solid beer."
""
""
"O- Decent drinking beer, there are better ones. Is it a Kolsch? Maybe. Maybe not."
""
""
""
"O- Not a bad light summer brew, not good either."
"as light and easy as the kolsch style goes, I think this Saranac version is especially light and easy, almost to a fault, or certainly to a point of being unexciting. it pours a nice pale golden color, clean and clear, with a short white head. the nose is german malts and yeast, very bready, but light like a pancake. hops are only in there for bittering and balance, which are both dialed in the nose and the flavor. there is a slight caramel sweetness that rounds it out, and a dry refreshing finish that begs for another gulp. very active carbonation and a thin body makes it even lighter, and this is a very sessionable summer beer from the mix pack. not the most exciting thing they are doing these days, but a worthy offering for hot weather. my dad thinks this is exceptional, I would like to see more hops."
""
"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a bright, vibrant, straw-gold coloring with a thin, sparse, filmy white surface coating of head. Aromas of floral highlights, buttery tones, and a toasty backbone. Strong and a bit unbalanced nose for the style. Flavors are bitter initially, with a sharpness from the light body and carbonation levels. Buttery tones once again, with a watery palate and feel at the end of each drink. Watery and muddled aftertaste, with a limp finish that has a kiss of hops that just can't right the ship."
""
""
""
"Poured into stange. Light clear golden yellow with a lively fizzy head that dissipates very raipdly, leaving no lacing. Smells very ""beer-like," with pretty evenly distributed malt, yeast, and hops. The smell is clean, a little spicy with some wine-like notes. Taste is light and clean, german yeast flavors are present with some tart wine-like flavors. Mouthfeel is clean, somewhat dry and medium-bodied."

"Enjoyable and forgettable the two words I hope you take away from this review. Lots of better easily available, get one of those."
""
""
""

"Unimpressive is probably the best way to describe this. The smell is mainly wheat and banana, then shifts to floral as it warms...however, it's very, very light. The taste is mainly floral. By mainly I mean that it tastes like Perrier with some floral and wheat thrown in it. Although drinkable, I would not get this again unless it came in their sampler pack."
""
""
"notes: Nice example of the Kolsch style, a light, delicate beer perfect for warm weather."
"Light golden yellow color with heavy carbonation and not too much head. Very hoppy, yeasty, hay-like aroma. A bitter, hoppy, hay-like taste with earthy notes. Can't taste too much alcohol. It tastes similar to the aroma. Finishes sweeter than it starts. Overall, kind of bland."
"My pour netted better than two fingers of dense, foamy eggnog-colored head with good retention. Color was a deep golden yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a grainy, grassy quality, like a field of hay. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was dry, slightly biscuity and very grassy. Finish was semi-dry with the malt and hops working well in tandem to create a very quaffable beer. Lacing was quite evident as I drank through the glass. I could see this as a good beer on a hot summer's day."

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some light hops. Taste is crisp, light, very mild hops, a touch of malt. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall a refreshing beer, but kind of light flavored and just a bit bland."
""
""
"Overall: A humdrum Kölsch that misses the mark, but serves as a fine light beer to cool me off in the dog days of summer."
""
"Overall: Not bad at all, easy brew to like. Hope you enjoy, grab a movie and sit back. Salud!"
""

"Overall, a good beer to refresh yourself on a Hot summer day (or any other time that you'd like some refreshment, such as after a hard day at work) ."

" The flavor is pretty standard for the style. I get mostly a light toasted grain with very mild sweetness and slight herbal element from the hops, but in general the flavor is pretty tame, overall not a bad beer, best use for this is summertime when you are looking for something quenching to refresh your palate during the heat and humidity."
"O: this wasn't bad, it wasn't necessarily one I need to run out and buy again, but its do-able enough if I got this again in the twelve pack of summer, I would be happy about."
"Overall I highly recommend this one for Kolsch lovers. Its a pleasant easy drinker."
""
"12oz bottle with SEP 2012. Pours a translucent golden color with a 1/4 inch of head. Almost no lacing. Aromas of grains, grass, with some floral notes. Taste is of grains with some orange peel and floral hops. Floral, grassy finish. Light mouthfeel. Nice summer beer. Nothing great but nothing bad either. Overall, works well in the Summer Mix Pack but wouldn't buy it on its own."

"On the lighter end of medium bodied with a stronger hop presence than the aroma hinted at. Crisp, slightly spicy hops that provides some subtle earthy and dry bitterness that lingers over the sweeter notes and pale malt. More floral than bitter with a slight earthy/soily character that is countered by an odd adjunct like sweetness. There hints of apple and pear but also a strange corn flavor that is pretty unpleasant. It starts off alright but the lingering aftertaste is pretty bad."
""
""
"Overall I got to stop buying into these Saranac beers most seem to be just average."
""
"Poured from bottle into tulip. Pours a slightly orange hued straw color, a bit of white bubbley foam and some lacing. Smells nice, bready yeasty malts and crisp straw. It has a nice crisp taste...at first. Followed by a heavy malt flavor; almost macro-like. Its bitter and dry mouthfeel. Overall, not a great and barely a good Kolsch. I would never buy this on its own...it came in the mixed 12 pack."
""
""
"Talk about a dry beer. It's more like a cocktail than a malted beverage. I love this beer. It's not for the masses, but it's got a hop and yeast character that is uncompromising and refreshing. It's like an IPA with a different yeast profile. It actually tastes a bit like dry vermouth. Interesting and unapologetic."
"A pretty good kolsch when I look back at it. What you see is what you get. I’d definitely try it again."
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle. Sampled on May 18, 2012. The pour is an excellent looking well-carbonated pale yellow with a light, fluffy white head up top that lingers on. The aroma is more malty than grainy but pleasant enough. The body is light to medium. The taste tends to bring out more of the character of grains with a crisp, clean finish. This is a refreshing warm weather beer."

"Light drinking beer overall with some light flavors. Some interesting/weird flavors mixed with some light fruitiness."

"Poured a pale straw color, with a nice light stream of bubbles. The nose was unimpressive, but the flavor was very light, with some nice hops and a bitter finish. Overall a nice, light, refreshing beer that was perfect with ribs and corn on a sunny, spring afternoon.--TM"
"Pale color; clarity and hefty amount of white head walks the walk. Hint of malt, more of a grainy husk and pale leather ... soft, but there with a twang of fermentation in the nose. Crispness is there, and a dry, pulling graininess seems to want to take over right from the get-go. Modest hopping—that’s all this brew really needed, though there is no real depth of flavor from the bitterness. Grain becomes almost a bit chalky in the bone-dry finish. A decent stab at the style, but a bit more malt and a pinch of sweetness with hopping to back it would bring it to where it should be."
"O/D-Easy drinker with minimal taste. The available taste is actually not too bad. I would prefer more flavor, but I do not dislike the overall flavor profile here."
"D: A rather grape focused Kolsch. Alright drinking, but it could really use more depth, heft, & character to its grainy malts. It could also stand to be a bit more bitter. It does go down easy and highlights the grapey effect sometimes found in some versions of the style."
"Not really much going on here, it isn't terrible but it doesn't show much effort. A lighter beer that is refreshing but flavor is just eh."
"Final Thoughts: I'm not an expert on Kolsch. But I know they should generally be dry, wine like, and good hop bite. This seems to hit a few of those, but they are missing a big part of it which is the bitter. This has no bitter at all. It's a tasty brew, but not a example of a kolsch. They should remarket this as a different kind of brew."
"Overall, this beer is very drinkable and light bodied. It's a decent lawnmower beer, but too sweet for me, and in my opinion, too sweet for the style."
"D - Surprisingly complex, and pretty tasty. I may be the minority on this one, but for a refreshing Summer brew, this certainly does the trick."
"O: Flavor really ruins it for me. Would not want to have this again."
"An ok beer for a hot summer day, but nothing too special here."
"Do not buy the summer mixer"
"Overall: The taste leaves more to be desired. Everything else about the beer is good, but it's lacking. This is my first kölsch, so I didn't really know what to expect and I'm not sure if that is typical of this style. It's easy to drink and would be refreshing after mowing the lawn on a hot day. I'd drink it again if given to me, but I don't think I'd go out of my way to try it again."
"This beer has little character and little going for it."
"Over all it is just a nice beer. Nothing about it stands out, but it just makes for one very pleasant and enjoyable drink."
"O: A slightly boring, but very drinkable beer. 3.5"
"D: not an example worth seeking. just falls very flat on aroma as well as taste. I don’t think this is a mainstay from Saranac seeing as it was part of a summer mixer pack, but something they should considering subbing out entirely."
"Pours a crystal clear straw/yellow with a minimum frothy/soapy head. Rather still looking beer. Aroma is very mellow. Some leafy, earthy hops and pale malts. Slightly sweet aroma. Flavor is well balanced with a bready/biscuit sweetness, bitter and earthy hops, and finishes slightly astringent. Well carbonated, prickly on the tongue, and finishes dry. The finish is kind of offputting, but the overall balance of this beer really cements it as a solid, affordable session beer."
"Cheers!!!"
"O - I don't have a ton of experience with kolsch's, Reissdorf being the only memorable one. However I know enough to say that this isn't a kolsch. It just feels watered down and has few redeeming qualities."
"O- Nothing here to offend anyone. Semi-bland but nothing bad in this beer."
"Clear gold in color with a light head. Zippy nose for a lighter beer. I really like the nose as a matter of fact. It has a spicy nature to it, but without spices. The wheat and grains must be working with the alpah acids/hops to give a nice smell. The attack is clean but the flavor leaves me wanting. That great nose seems to be a tease as the flavor comes through kind of dull and flat. The finish is pretty nondescript and you can't really pull anything out about this beer other than the nose. At least I can't. All this warm weather makes for a good time to drink these light and refreshing beers, but this one came out a little flat for me."
"Easy drinking. I could have a few. Its not an A+ beer, but I enjoyed it."
"Overall - All the aromas and tastes are very weak except for the bitterness. Not much else detected. I would not recommend this. Reviewed from notes."
"(rated Mar 28, 2007)"
"I could do without this one... Stale-ish aroma, pours very light with little head. Taste is watery with an unremarkable flavor. Wouldn't drink this one again, didn't even really do much to quench summer thirst..."
"Overall I was not disappointed with this brew because I did not expect much of it. But I would not revisit it simply because it was fairly average in every respect."
"Your average run of the mill Kolsch here. Highly carbonated and easily drinkable but the taste and aroma are just lacking way too much for me. Basically it's like drinking a beer verson of Champagne, at least this was inexpensive."
"Golden yellow, generally opaque body with fluffy foamy three-finger head in a Saranac willibecker--looks refreshing... crisp pilsner malts are stongest... little else, as it should be with the style... active, thin palate that vibrates on the tongue... appealingly fresh... fresh, relaxed clean malts--the lightest feel of vanilla and acidity actually compliment the otherwise thin mouthfeel... as for saranac's summer sampler, this is the top offering, with its clean, pure approximation of the style--which I thought, again, that the appelation kolsch is not available to non-Cologne brewers... Ryan liked this one too, and I can't really find an issue with its light pilsner effects..."
"Well, fortunately mine wasn't at all skunky. It however does seem to be lacking a little flavor. Pours a golden color with a pretty nice white head and also fair amount of lacing on the glass. Sweet fruity aroma. It's a very smooth beer but the flavor comes up a little short. There really isn't a whole lot there. Light-bodied and refereshing, so I can think of worse to have during a sunny day."
"Golden amber colored brew with a weak quick-to-disappear head. Sweet vanilla extract aroma but should be more powerful. Pretty much everything about the beer is weak. The taste is of spice, a touch of vanilla, and sour orange rind aftertaste but none of these really stick out. This beer lacks flavor and personality but nice try though...I guess."
"Poured a dark, seethru gold with a good head retention. A somewhat faint smell of alcohol mixed with grains. While it is medium-bodied and a little bit like bread malt and some citric hops, a husky, grainy slickness passed over my tongue with a too sharp backbite that dried out my tongue. I am not a huge pils drinker, and this reminds me of a pils. I am trying to be fair, but I wasn't too impressed with this offering."
"Drinkability here is low. I haven't had the style before to compare it but I'm guessing that if I did I'd prefer another. Good try though."
"i can see what this beer should be, it just feels like its not quite there... as a fan of a few german kolsch beers i wish this was just a bit heavier and more flavorful... drinkable in a 'sit my ass down right here in this lawn chair and ill be damned if i get up' kind of way"
"Try this beer!"
"Feel is thin-medium and crisp with a watery chardonnay character and light carbonation. Refreshing and very drinkable."
"This one gets decent marks for drinkability, but primarily due to its style. There is a bit of a Koln vs. Dusseldorf rivaly and it is said in Dusseldorf that ""Kölsch ist kein Bier"" (Kolsh is not beer). That said, this one pours pale, bubbly and clear in the glass with a small head that quickly disappears. A hint (small hint) of malt? in the nose and the flavor is a very drinkable balance of malt and subtle hops for a fruity aftertaste. Not much to say. Great backyard BBQ offering."
"Bought as part of the Saranac Summer Sampler. 12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a . The aroma is sweet grain with just maybe a touch of hops, pretty underwhelming aroma. The taste is light and crisp sweet malt and a touch of spicy hops in the finish. The mouthfeel is light bodied with a high amount of carbonation creating a prickly feel on the tongue. Overall, Saranac Kolsch is pretty unimpressive in terms of flavor and character but is an easy drinking lawnmower beer, no question."
"D - I'm a big fan of almost Saranac puts out, but this was a little tough to get through..."
"Drinkability: Good beer that I could easily enjoy as part of a six pack on its own."
"D. Pretty good, 5% makes it manageable to drink a few of these."
"overall-not a bad beer, I would not go and buy a sixer of this, but it is enjoyable as part of a variety pack"
"D - Wouldn't mind having a few of these, but the sweetness is somewhat overbearing. Overall a nice flavorful beer."
"D: Definately drinkable and sessionable but not my favorite by any means."
"This beer poured a pale copper color with a two-finger head that dissipated quickly. The smell is mostly light maltiness with perhaps a slight fruitiness. The taste is starts off with some sweet biscuity malt that finishes with a small hop bite. The mouthfeel is pretty standard, kind of watery with a medium-amount of carbonation. I'd say this beer is pretty drinkable, and not a bad thing to grab on a hot summer day."
"D: Fine, cooling and easy to drink."
"Saranac's Kolsch has a beautiful golden color and a thick white head. It has a lovely light aroma with some fruity esters that reminds me of pineapple. The flavor is well rounded with some light grains, mellow doughy yeast and fruity hops that add just a little bitterness. On the palate there is a nice carbonation with a light body and clean dry finish. I liked this refreshing offering from the summertime sampler and I could see myself looking for it by itself in a six pack over so."
"Appears a deep straw colored golden hue with a bright vibrant white head, with thin speckled lacing left behind between each sip. Aromatics crisp mineral character with mild toasted cracker sweetness from the lightly kilned malts with just an air of herbal hops. Flavor wise is clean and straight forward with a crisp malt sweetness touch of honey and biscuit quality about it with a light touch of noble hop action balancing it out. So nonoffensive yet well made clean drinkable. Mouthfeel is light crisp bodied with a sturdy level of carbonation tickling the throat a bit. Overall I could session with this perfect for the summer time sipping sessions, quintessential part of what every beer in the twelve pack of summer should offer."
"D: Light, enjoyable, clean on the palate. Nice, but not spectacular. I couldn't help but not the rather grain-like flavor of the malts in this brew, a bit heavier than I have had in this style before, but not necessarily bad."
"It's not a bad beer at all, but it tastes like a slight step up from macro offerings. Not truly to style, but certainly not one I'd seek out again."
"Pours a golden yellow with a medium sized and medium bodied white head that fades pretty fast and laces the glass pretty well. The aroma is of very sweet malts and some yeasty aromas in there as well. The taste is pretty good as it is very light but sweet malts with a nice faint hoppy bitter at the end of the taste. It has a very light, crisp, and refreshing mouthfeel which is nice for a summer type of beer which makes it pretty drinkable."
"Easily drinkable with a modest alcohol percentage and lack of cloying nuances... However, there was also a noticeable lack of complexity here, especially on the tongue, so I wouldn't consider this an exciting beer to drink - just very crisp and refreshing to say the least..."
"D: Really good beer that fits the style well. Nothing better than a kolsch on a hot day. One of the better beers from Saranac"
"D - Very refreshing and light. The fact that this beer finishes clean makes this a desired drink for those hot summer days. Recommended and decent for the class."
"12 oz. bottle with no freshness date. It's crystal-clear, gold and quite active, with an inch of cream head that starts a bit loose, but tightens with the oncoming carbonation. Hops and a dash of grain in the nose, but the flavor is more substantial, with toasty/biscuity malts, wheat?, flashes of fruit, and some grassy/earthy hops that impart a medium bitterness. The body is medium, quite smooth, with lingering hop oils that leave a medium finish. Overall this makes for a nice session brew - quite easy to drink and not too complicated."
"This poured a nice dark golden color, and generated a head that was approximately one finger wide and dissipated quite quickly. Sweet, malty aroma with just a bit of floral hops. Taste was a bit light, but nothing offensive. Clean and crisp. Nothing special, but drinkable and enjoyable."
"The taste is clean with a dry finish. Notes of fruit, sweet malt and a light hop bitterness. Doesnt get my palate going but still quaffable."
"Drinkability- It is refreshing and easy to drink with or out food."
"Drinkability: the lingering sourness made this hard to enjoy. Was expecting a bit more balance."
"D - Easy drinking beer. Tasted a little like a true German hefe."
"12oz brown bottle with no freshness date. Pours a medium gold with a nice 3 finger head, decent longevity and good lace. Biscuity malt aromas mixed with a slight lemony hop floralness. Somewhat weak fruity and bready malt flavors finishing with a slight hop bitterness and leaving fruity aftertaste. Crisp and clean. Easy dinking but somewhat lacking in flavor. Its just a bit too watery. Still an OK beer though."
"Overall this was fairly decent. It was not the best of the bunch, but not bad either. Could have used a little more flavor to really put the point home, however it was decent never the less. I would definatly drink one again, especially on a hot day@!"
"Pours a perfectly clear gold color with a little over a finger of head and some lacing. Aroma is very, very mild but I can detect hints of grassy hops (possibly Saaz?) and some faint malts. Taste is first of pale, biscuity malts followed by a grassy hoppiness that lingers into the dry, crisp finish. Mouthfeel is good, moderate carbonation. Body is heavier than expected but still is medium at best. Drinkability is good, very crisp and refreshing and perfect for a hot summer's day."
"A crisp summer day beer. Great for washing down picnic fare. A nice change of pace to some of the overdone styles. Others in style are a bit more true to the origins."
"Not too much above a BMC macro here. Poured to a light golden yellow, with high carbonation and a thin white head that dissipated quickly and left little lacing. Aroma was mostly non-existent at first, but then became more floral , grassy hops as the beer warmed. Flavor, likewise, was subtle early on, then picked up the grassy notes at mid-glass. This all led to a a watery finish for this thin-bodied beer that was short and weak."
"Notes: I'll admit I don't know much about this style. I understand it's supposed to be light, but I would hope other versions would have a little more flavor than this offering from FX Matt. . . . That said, serve it ice cold after mowing the lawn and it wouldn't be so bad. . . ."
"It feels thicker than the lager it resembles. Leaves a mildly bitter film, but is actually refreshing. Yet dry...? It's very drinkable and summery. I'm actually shocked at how pleasant this beer is."
"Light-bodied with lots of carbonation on the tongue. Refreshing, but not particularly special in terms of taste."
"DA: not a horrible american version of this beloved German original."
"Not much going on here. Not the summer refresher that it should be. Weak and uninteresting. Not undrinkable, but ""why bother"" comes to mind..."
"D- This beer is ok, but not one that I will seek out in future. I had it in a sampler pack and that is were it is perfect. Nice to try; not on my todo list."
"A light straw colored brew that exudes buttery and winey characteristics. The nose is quite strong of buttered biscuits and sweetness. The taste continues this notes with additions of some fruity hops, though very weak in the hops presence. These lend some manderin orange or perhaps pear. Mouthfeel is creamy with a sharper sparkling carbination that penetrates into the tongue. Not my favorite tasting beer, but drinkable enough for me."
"Another mediocre Saranac summer ale. This is watery from pour to finish. It is a golden yellow with very little head and no lacing on my glass, although one reviewer said it laced well. The smell is sweet, fruity, I'm going out on a limb and say a bit strawberry like. The taste is sweet malt in the middle but turning sour and not all that pleasant towards the end. The after taste is not all that pleasant either. It does have a vinous character, very watery, light bodied, moderately carbonated, ultra clean and purified. It's that sweet fruity something in the middle -- some say grape skin, maybe strawberryish -- that makes it a bit perplexing, but other than that, I wouldn't particularly seek this out. The Saranac summer variety is not endearing, but I have a few more to sample so I will keep an open mind."
"D-not the best of its style but a good attempt. Very drinkable"
"This beer pours a light color with minimal carbonation. The aroma is somewhat weak and nearly non-existent. Some fruitiness shows through but barely. Taste is more of a grainy taste with a weird aftertaste. I believe a Kolsch should be more flavorful than this. Correct me if I'm wrong but this beer just isn't impressive by much."
"Well all in all, worth a try and perhaps desirable if you are more liquid thirsty than you are beer thirsty."
"Not that great a beer and one that I have no reason too ever sample again."
"Not a bad stab at the style, but with something like a kölsch, there seems to be a fine line between subtle and bland. Saranac's version seems to be a little on the bland side, but it works well as a summer quencher."
"Pours a clear golden color with an average white head that dissipated fairly quick. The smell is hard to find, grainy, slightly metallic. The taste is also grainy, has a slight dry hoppiness to it. Has very similar characteristics of a macro. The feel is light and watery, finishes a tad dry. Overall an easy drinker that you can throw a few back if you are motivated to do so. Nothing outstanding and not much to it that would distinguish it from a macro."
"Cheers!"
"Pours a dark golden yellow with not much head and no lacing. The smell is mostly grain and yeast, I am not picking up much else. The taste is follows suit with some very light malt and hops notes at the end. This is a light beer with moderate carbonation. I found that it had good flavor and was a satisfying summer beer. This is an easy drinker, a couple of sips and it was gone, and I wanted another. A great summer beer, light and refreshing. Cheers!"
"drinkability - Too light and an easy drinking beer. Like I said reminds me an american macro, and UPGRADED macro i should note."
"As easy to drink as a macro light, with a little better flavor. Would not purchase outside of the mixer pack."
"D: Not too bad nor too good. Easy to drink, if its on sale. Reminds me of a macro."
"This beer is from the ""12 Beers of Summer"" pack. The beer pours a light yellow/orange color with an inch and a half white head. Head retention is good, lacing is OK. The aroma is just grainy to me, I can't smell much else except for a little bit of malt. That being said, it doesn't smell bad. The taste is better, it still tastes grainy but there's also some hops and pepper (spicy) too. Mouthfeel is light and crisp, but a bit watery. Drinkability is OK, it's non-offensive and not hard to drink. Overall it's an OK beer, just a bit above average for me."
"D: A solid, mildly flavored ale. Don't pick this up expecting an authentic Köln brew, but it is an easy drink."
"D - I'm continually disappointed with this year's 12 Beers of Summer. The Kolsch was the last of my reviews, and I honestly dont know if I could pick it out of a lineup between the rest, save maybe the Summer and Pomegranate for obvious reasons. To me, this beer tastes like a slightly more professional Bud Light."
"This beer poured to a golden yellow color with a fair sized white head that had a little retention but hardly left any lacing. The aroma has a grain like scent that is noticeable but also a little hop that I would believe are Perle, but not 100% sure. The taste is fair, not overly exciting but has a good taste, clean, easy drinking with some pale malt flavors and a slight hop break at the end. Over all this is an ok brew from Saranac, once again it is not a superior example of the style but a fair attempt. Probably not a bad offering in the summer mix pack when the weather gets hot."
"Good ol' Saranac. Makers of plain, honest beer."
"Kölsch is meant to be drank quickly, in a few gulps, and this is a good gulper."
"The smell took away from the drinkability. Everytime I went to take a sip it pricked my nose. The overall taste didn't wow me either."
"Poured out a light goldwith a fizzy bone white head, decent lacing. The nose offered some lemon, bit of apricot, yeast, nuttiness, bread, and malt. The taste had a bit of citrus zest, apricot, slight malt notes, and a bit of spicy hops at the end. Mouthfeel is crisp, clean, nice carbonation. Light to medium-bodied. Spot on for the style. Overall, not the greatest example of this style, but very drinkable. A little too light bodied, tastes weak and watered down."
"Crisp, slightly bitter opening with a sour bready finish. This beer's flavor quite reminds me of Heineken."
"Pours golden. Nice white head. Good retention,and lacing. Smell is nice, but weak. Yeast with some malty/fruity over tones. Body is light with some carbionation. Taste is smooth,and malty with a hint of fruit up front.Finish is dry. Just a bit of hops in the finish. Not bad at all."
"A very decent attempt at the subtle malty Kolsch style although I wish more conditioning had been done to let the flavors develop a bit better...this was very fresh Kolsch."
"Saranac Kolsch strikes me as a decent lawnmower beer in that it would probably taste best when consumed ice cold on a sorching hot day. Absent that scenario, it's average at best. The same could be said for just about all Matt Brewing Company beer."
"Not bad, if not terribly Kolsch like. An ok summer beer though."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle from the 12 beers of summer. Pours a hazy yellow straw color with a two finger width white head. Smell is malty with some nice hops thrown in. Pretty good carbination. Taste is very crisp and clean. Light body. Beer has some maltyness with some bitter hops in the background. As the beer goes down a slight fruitness appears but it doesn't detract from the beer. The mouth is light with a good level of carbination. A pretty drinkable beer."
"The beer poured a straight gold with a fizzy, brilliant white head. I did expect the beer to be more carbonated, but it was a still, clear beer. The flavor comes in waves. The initial flavor is of pale, pilsner style maltiness with some doughiness tones as well. Then a clean drop off, of the nature that many adjunct lagers tell you to expect, that transitions into a dryness as the beer exits the palate. The mouthfeel is light and perfectly fitting for this Florida, 100 F day this afternoon, but this beer, even with this merit, lacks a fair deal of flavor that others of this style I have encountered."
"Crystal clear, ginger ale-esque appearance. Zero head, even though it is highly carbonated. Light, sweet aroma. Taste is pleasant. Apple and pear dominate. Only a hint of bitterness. As Kolsch goes, this was great. I was very surprised how much I enjoyed it as this is a style I usually find very boring. I could drink this all summer."
"M / D - light - watery brew. not a recommender. Mostly an inoffensive light brew."
"D-if it was the primary choice at a party it would be very drinkable, otherwise, I;\'d choose something else."
"Effervescent and volumnious light taupe head subsides quickly to a very thin layer, leaving spots of lace. Nose is a little grassy and earthy, light grains but weak. Golden, clear body is light, with above-average carbonation. Flavor profile is weak and bland, light malt, with more of a sweet malt in the back of the throat on the way down, and a light refreshing hop in the aftertaste. Indistinct but crisp and refreshing."
" MK"
"Mouth feel is light in body and is moderately carbonated."
"Pours a slightly cloudy yellow color with tiny rising bubbles and a thin white head that dissipates fast. Minimal lacing. Weak aroma of hops and spices. Light-bodied and crisp with light zesty hops and citrus that does not stick around very long. Almost like a ""light"" Kölsch if that is not too redundant. The finish is crisp and bubbly with a bit of sweet fruit and spice. Not a whole lot to this one, I see no reason why they couldnt give it some more pizzazz."
"Another simple, rather inoffensive and ineffectively average brew from Saranac."
"Purchased as part of the 12 Beers of Summer package. I haven't had many Kolsch beers so have little with which to compare this one. Overall, it was a decent drink but not an outstanding one by any means. Weak head, a somewhat bland flavor but nonetheless quite crisp and rather enjoyable. I've been a fan of many Saranac products but can't see myself purchasing this one in a 6-pack despite the fact it's quite drinkable. The Summer Package contains a number of styles preferable to this one as far as my taste is concerned."
" Nothing to write home about but definitely doable in the summer heat."
"Drinkability: This would be a good one for a summer day"
"This was part of a summer sampler 12 pack, and it was one of the less enjoyable beers in the sampler. It was an orange color with a small head. It had a faint aroma, floral/grainy. The taste was very nondescript. A little bit of hops, and that's it. I've had better kolsches. Drinkable in the sense that it will quench your thirst."
"This was the first Kolsch I have tried. This is a very average beer, pleasant but with no distinguishing characteristics. Poured a dark gold/coppery gold color with a small head. Light lacing on the glass. Faint pleasant smell, very mild taste. I knew I was drinking a beer, but no flavors really stood out. The mouthfeel was rich enough for a fairly light beer. No watery thin taste. Drinkability is good. I could drink several of these on a hot day. A cut above BMC but nothing I would try to seek out."
"An average beer, but a bit of a weak example of the style. Certainly drinkable, but needs more flavor."
"A pretty easy beer to sit back and swig, and great beer for the cheap price you can pick it up for."
"Body is light, watery, and over carbonated. My least favorite from the summer mix pack."
"I would like to see other competent brewers take on this style more frequently."
"Tasted: 12/24/05"
"Another good offering from the Matt Brewing Co. Poured out to a clean and clear golden color with a nice head of about 1/4 inch. Some notes of lacing, but not a whole lot. Medium to medium low level of carbonation. Aromas of fresh hops and grain mixed with malt and corn. Nice. Taste was middle of the road, some flavors of corn, malt and salty spices. Mouthfeel was decent, slightly slick and crisp. A pretty decent level of drinkability as well. A well made Kolsch."
"Drinkability: I could swig it in summer out of the bottle and be happy I suppose, but it's nothing fantastic. Once again, I don't know the style very well, but I don't know how much that matters. I suppose I'll at least give some others a chance before I decide the style isn't for me."
"Pours a dark gold with a small, white, tight head that very slowly diminishes to a film. The aroma is mild but doesnt lack character. Grain, caramel, bread, citrus, and a little nuttiness in there. The taste is malty and clean with a crisp, lightly finish and a touch of citrus. It has a medium-light body, dry texture, and moderate carbonation. I found this to be a little on the bland side, but pleasant nevertheless. Worth a try, but not worth seeking out."
"Pours a crystal clear, pure gold. A bubbly white head of two fingers holds well over active carbonation. Very slowly drops to some sticky lacing. Estery fruit aroma, and very subtle noble hops. Vinous flavor and german hops are perceived better in the taste, and a faint roasted malt flavor only present in the aftertaste. Mild hop bitterness and the gentle wine flavor are well balanced with a light body that leaves a clean finish and high drinkability."
"A mediocre beer, and unlike the other kolschs I have had and liked."
"D - easily quaffable, but lack of flavor is very dissapointing."
"D- A decent brew to put back, but the craving for more flavor turns me to other beers."
"Orange hue, a bit overly carbonated but didn't overdue on bite and acidity. Frothy white head that faded unevenly but kept around. Hop and some brown sugar on the nose. A bit more bread and malt on the tongue than expected but gives way to decent hoppiness quickly. Good thick chewy sort of feel without actually being thich. Perhaps sweetened a bit much for the style but makes it more drinkable to me."
"Clear light golden color. Thick fluffy white head with very good retention and lace. Slight floral aroma, and a touch of spice. Pale malt, followed by some floral and grassy flavors. Light body, carbonation was good. Overall, this is a pretty decent beer. Very easy to drink, and no extreme off-flavors. From the ""Beers of Summer"" pack."
"From a 12 ounce bottle, this brew pours a light blonde color with a shiny, brilliantly white head. Flowery, hoppy aroma, mixed with a solid malt character and a little fruit. The taste is a little grainy, and quite sweet. By the finish, the brew turns hoppy, with a slight peppery bitterness. Its very clean, and highly carbonated. Nice summer brew."
"Poured out a deep golden color with a big foamy head which stayed for a little bit. Smell was a bit odd. Some malts and wheat but also some lemon twang which then went to this sweetish aroma which was quite strange. Taste wasn't all that great. It was mostly a sweet and sour flavors, but rather weak. Finished slightly peppery and dry. Mouthfeel was light and slightly watery. Not impressed by this one at all."
"A clean yellow beer has a bubbly bright white head and some nice lace.. The aroma has notes of grass and grain with a light lemon in the background. The flavor starts with a smooth malt grain character and finishes with a light peppery hop note is smooth and easy."
"Pours a light golden yellow, crystal clear, with half a finger of white fizzy head that quickly fades to a little lacing around the edges. Sweet clean malt scent with a touch of floral hops. Nice malty flavor with a touch of apple skins and a noticeable hop finish. Mouthfeel is clean and refreshing, with a medium/high carbonation and a medium body. Got this in he summer pack, and I'm really pleasantly surprised with this brew. It's 80 degrees and muggy in my apartment and this feels just great."
"Poured a medium amber color with white head that almost immediately dissapeared. Smell is sweetness and a touch of hops. First taste leaves a great dryness but this seems to moderate with subsequent sips. Mouth feel is average. Easy to drink but nothing great."
"Mellow light gold with a foamy head in the stange, head fell to a white ring, tiny bubble carbonation. Slight grainy malt, clean, but nothing memorable. Taste is watery malt with a mild hop flavor. Mouthfeel is thin. Boring, decent, drinkable. Better than corn/rice adjuncts."
"Mouthfeel was crisp and dry at the start and finish. The finish is also clean and refreshing. Decent on the drinkability scale, as the brew is nice on a hot sunny day and a few of these could be easily quaffed."
"Very interesting. Ahh i love the summer of beer pack, tasty. It smells great, sorta hoppy, fruity. The appearance is allright. It pours golden with a nice sticky head that slowly reduces. Not sure what to say as I haven't had much of this style but it is pleasant. Sorta hoppy, sorta malty and really crisp. Moderately carbonated. Sort of dry but almost average in terms of drinkability. Moderate mouthfeel. If i had more appreciation for the style maybe it would get a higher ranking. Hmm. Maybe with time. I will come back to this. BUT my overal impression is that it is too dry."
"Drinkability: this is a ""lawnmower"" type brew. Something to drink to cool off without sacrificing a lot on flavor. This is not something I would go out of my way to drink often, but maybe worth trying in a mix-pack to try a Kolsch."
"Surprisingly, a pretty good example of this style. I dont see TOO many American breweries trying their hand at this style, and when they do the attempt is typically pretty mediocre. Not this one; while I cant say its superb, its certainly above average. More generally though, its refreshing and tasty, which makes for one drinkable brew. Recommended (with some enthusiasm)."
"Appears to be SUPER carbonated, bubbles galore. Decent snow white head. As is settles a little, I'm noticing that this beer is strikingly clear. Smell is actually really appetizing, spritely hoppy, spicy and floral. You know, it's really not bad. I never know what to expect from Saranac, beyond consistent mediocrity, but occasionally their beers are very bad or actually quite good, and this one surprised me as being pretty good. Really light and summerish, but plenty of spicy hop flavor. Don't take this literally, but just the variety and character of the hops reminds me vaguely of a baby De Ranke, though obviously on a totally different level. Super refreshing. I recommend this one."
"I would buy 12 packs of this. So far the standout in the summer pack."
"The beer poured a very nice shade of old gold, it had a bit of effervesence and developed a fingers worth of white head. The aroma was of malt and pepper. The taste was a very nice Kolsch with a nice combination of pepper and hops with a bit of vanilla in the background. The feel was light, dry, and with a just enough hop to give it a crisp finish. This was a nice beer, it had a bit of complexity, but not so overwhelming that you had to stop at one."
"I generally dig Saranac a little more, but this is the second straight one of their beers I thought was just average."
"A clear golden beer with a frothy white 2-finger head. Streams of bubbles rising from the bottom and some lacing produced. The aromas detected were hoppy and similar to wet straw or hay. I found the flavor to be slightly bitter and hoppy at first, but with hints of malting in the finish. Mouthfeel was light and refreshing. I am not sure of what to think of this beer. Perhaps I lack an appreciation for this style, but it was all right brew."
"I am sampling a chilled 12 oz bottle in a pint glass. The beer pours a bright clear gold color and a bleached white fluffy head of 2 cm foams up easily. Aroma is mild but I detect some grainy malt a very tiny hit of lemon and grassy and spicy hops. The first sip reveals an average bodied beer with small and tingly carbonation. Flavor is slightly sugary sweet up front with some lemon as well. The flavor quickly moves to a spicy peppery hop finish that dries my tongue. I also get a sweet sticky film on my lips. The beer is crisp and refreshing. Would be great on a hot day!"
"This type of brew is easily consumed on a hot, summer day. Try the All-American grill buddies: hot dogs and hamburgers."
"From their Beers of Summer sampler. Pours a bit deeper golden than your standard macro. Not much in the nose, some sweet malts and grains. Flavor is slightly malty, again the sweet side kind of taking over here...in serious need of some hop bitterness for both balance and flavor. Kind of fruity in the finish, with notes of cherry and apple. Light, bubbly carbonation. I guess this would be one of those ""transitional beers"" to get your macro drinking buddies to try. I'm pretty sure this is beefed up UCL."
"Notes  This is my first Kolsch, I assume there are better examples out there, but it isnt a style I see very often."
"The beer pours a gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice pale malt scent that is a bit grainy and dry, but also is bitter with hop aroma. The taste is good. It has a clean and crisp pale malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes dry and bitter. This has more malt flavor than most Kolsch beers I've had, but hey I'm not crying. The mouthfeel is good. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a good beer. I'm not sure how true to style it is, but it drinks well."
