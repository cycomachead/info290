3.5,14.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a light golden amber with a thin white head that dissipates to a thin film and ring around the glass. Aroma of neutral malt, wheat and slight citrus sourness. Flavor is slightly tart bready malt, citrus and light wheat, finishing with wheat and grassy hop bitterness. Light bodied. A light, refreshing, but unremarkable summer beer. Light and low malt for a kolsch, but the light color and flavors are within the kolsch universe. A bit astringent in the finish, but pleasant and drinkable for a light summer beer, as advertised.","LiquidAmber","Jul 09, 2013"

Smell is somewhat lacking, but what I do get is grains and light fruits. Taste is surprisingly bitter right off the bat with a bready/biscuit flavor and some citrus zest on the finish. The bitterness is somewhat assertive on the palate after each sip. An average mouthfeel with a decent carbonation level and a crisp flavor.

The taste of this beer is bready with some banana like yeast flavor. Light in body, very drinkable. Good beer for a summer day. This beer finishes very dry, leading me to empty this glass very quickly. As far as Kolsch goes, this is average.It will do the trick on a hot day.","GossageBrewery","Jun 10, 2011"

Some honey upfront followed by a hint of stale hops and maybe a touch of aspirin towards the finish. The middle has some orange in it as well. It's not the worst of the Trader Joes lineup (see Kennebunkport Wheat) but it's not really worth picking up.","notchucknorris","Apr 01, 2011"

Time for a kolsch. This one pours a lightly hazy grapefruit yellow topped by a finger of short-lived white foam. The nose comprises dusty orange, dry wheat, and plenty o' butter. Hm. The taste isn't really more heartening, with notes of funky wheat, sour mandarin orange, and straight dust. A light but still very obvious bitterness gums (not enough tooth to bite) the tongue a bit at the end. The body is a hefty-feeling light, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, a sad kolsch, straight up.","TMoney2591","Jan 22, 2011"
2.03,-33.7,2.5,2,2,2,2,"Kolcsh styles aren't supposed to be heavy or extremely flavorful but I felt that this was far too light even for the a Kolsch style beer. The color was a very clear yellow.

3,-2,3,3,3,3,3,"Bought this because this summer brew was being sold at a closeout price ($3.99 for a 6-er) during this brutal winter here in the Hudson Valley. I can't speak to how faithfully it represents the true Kolsch style, but while it is highly drinkable it has almost no character, i.e., anything that makes it memorable. Accordingly, it reminds me of the kind of beer you have after a couple of good ones -- that is, when your palate is not so discriminating and you just want to keep the buzz on. Not that I ever do that, heaven knows -- I'm just saying. Anyway, I think their strategy worked because I was at TJ's today and there was none to be had.","hmk22","Oct 19, 2010"

An upfront lime flavor that seems out of place with a small grassy hop profile. Flavor and aroma did begin to improve as the brew warmed up. Has a mild dry bitterness in the back end and a slick mouthfeel. Not something I would want another of since I had trouble finishing one.
