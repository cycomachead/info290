"I was not a fan of Summit's Summer Ale, even though most are. Just not my taste."

"Overall, a decent kolsch although, to me, something seemed slightly off. The can is fresh so that's not the issue. Not the best example of the style that I've had."
"Nothing extraordinary, but pleasant. Nice price too."

"Pretty nice summertime beer."
""
"Overall, an excellent, refreshing summer brew, a sessionable alcohol level of 4.4% and a flavor that isn't a hop slap or a cloying syrup. Nicely balanced. I'll buy more this summer."

"O - Excellent summer beer, probably my favorite, easily drinkable, very refreshing. Not the most on flavor, but definitely a good example of a kolsch."
"O: A very good Kolsch. It's a style I struggle to describe because when it's done right is a light dry beer with some potential fruitiness that is great a Summer session beer, much like what we have here with Summits Summer Ale."

"An aggro head netted me two pillowy fingers of dense, bone-white head that took forever to fall even in the day's humidity. Color was a sunshine-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose smelled strongly of Noble hops with a lemony tartness. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was very lemony in the mouth. Boy, did I pick the right one for this humid evening! It was like lemon sorbet in its taste as well as its refreshing, thirst-quenching nature. Finish was semi-dry, still quite lemony and very tasty."
"Great summer beer. Makes me want to find more from this brewer."
""
"A: The beer is clear light yellow in color and has no visible carbonation. It poured with a quarter finger high white head that died down, leaving a thin head covering the surface and some lacing down the sides of the glass."
"O: This beer is easy to drink but doesn't seem like a true kölsch—I couldn't detect any grape-like flavors in the taste."

"An alright Kosch, like most of Summit's offerings; decent, drinkable, but not memorable. Fairly true to style"

"Great summer session bier."
""
""
"Overall: Slightly above average beer. Goes down really easy. Not much taste however. I assume that this is true to the style after reading the description. This is my first experience with this style."

"Overall, it did its job but nothing more. Definitely wont buy again, although I remain a fan of summit's other brews."

"D - Didn't really know what to expect form this brew, as I've never had a Kölsch before. I figured I'd get more yeast and less hops; something akin to a hefeweizen. This reminded me more of an APWA, but with both more hops and malt. All in all, a tasty and drinkable summer brew from Summit."
"Overall – A good summer session beer. It is very easy to drink with its smooth body, light abv and more simple but flavorful crisp taste."
"Thanks Aaron!"

"Immensely drinkable, fresh malt flavors from start to finish. Hoppiness balances and shows off a little. Summit has certainly brightened up my summer a bit more with this one."
"Light color. Very crisp aroma. Subtle hop presence, consistent with the style. Refreshing, easy drinking. The 4.5% ABV (note: the 4.9% ABV shown with the listing here is not current) and crisp, refreshing taste means you could pound back more than a few of these on a hot summer evening."
"Pours a cloudy light straw color with about a finger of white head that dissipated rather quickly but left some lacing. The nose is wheat-like. The taste is light but pleasantly dry. There was a touch of tingling bitterness on the finish which is the highlight of this offering."
"A thank you goes out to cpolking form sending this beer. Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of grains, malts. Taste is bready malts, some grains, a touch of hops. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is a good easy drinking summer beer."

"Next time it's in the 90's, this will go down great, but, so does water. I'm not trying to knock Summer Ale, because it's not aimed at me, but I will miss the Hefe Weizen considerably, if this is it's replacement."
""
"This beer pours a semi-clear golden color. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes rather quickly into a thin cap of lacing. The aroma is of herbal, spicy hops with an underlying breadiness. It is rather weak though, and I have to try really hard to detect it. The taste is similar to the aroma with a nice balance of bready malt, and spicy, herbal hops. Again, like the aroma, it is weak even for the style. The mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium bodied with lively carbonation, and a smooth texture. Overall, I really don't think highly of this beer. I'm a big fan of the Kolsch style. However, this is a weaker example of the style, I can't see myself drinking again."
"A decent summer beer, fairly clean and easy to drink."
""
"Overall a good summer brew."
""

"Overall: I like this one, tastes like a light bodied pilsner with an emphasis on the hops. I should get the summer sampler to compare this side by side with their pilsner, reminds me a lot of it right now."
""
"Mmm. Reminds me a bit of Summit's Kolsch from a couple summers back. The slight earthy mineral note is subdued, but there's still a wonderfully subtle character of bready malts, mellow citrus hops, and light fruit esters. Complex, yet drinkable, what a fine beer. It opens with fresh-baked bread and finishes with a dry grassy bitterness. I'll have another."
""
"Overall, this is a great offering from Summit and something I will be having in the fridge this summer. Very easy to drink, yet provides a nice flavor."
"O -- A great addition to light and refreshing summer beers with a nicely bitter hoppiness when the craving hits. I was looking for Sierra Nevada Pale Ale on sale and this beer filled my craving for something light and hoppy at the same time. I just wish that tart vegetal character wasn't so prominent."
""
"overall i would say that summit has hit upon something good here, after messing around with the hefe and scandia. not sure where this rates compared to those two, but the ultimate comparison will be to see how this stands up to the schell zommerfest as go to summer slammers for my drinking pleasure. stay tuned..."
"Perfect summertime brew."
""
""
""
"Overall: A pretty solid take on a Kolsch. Its everything you would expect from the style. Very good summer beer."
"A bit lacking in character, but clean, and a reasonable approximation of the style."
""
""
"O- a session thirst quencher with mid Kolsch flavors, not my first choice for a kolsch or a summer beer for the matter"
"Overall this is not as good as the Unchained Kolsch that came out a few years back but that was a truly elite offering. This is definitely solid and will be a nice summer beer. I plan on doing a blind taster with this and four other Kolschs to see how it stands... Schells Zommerfest,Alaskan Summer, and Goose Island Summer. Right now I would say that matchup is a toss up with perhaps a slight edge to GI...we'll see...may update this when I do that."

"This is a nice summer ale. Soft and well blended flavors. Should work for the masses, and could make a nice lawnmower beer."
"Enjoyable summer brew that is different from boring hot weather beers. I did not enjoy it as much as the Unchained Kolsch from a couple years ago, but being produced on a larger scale, I understand that compromises had to be made."
""
""
""
""
"Much better than their Hefe Weizen (which this replaced), but I still miss the old Scandia Ale summer seasonal."
"Notes: Light in body, with subtle flavor and great balance. Glad they decided to try something different this Summer. Quite tasty, and very easy to drink. A textbook example of the style. Well done!"
"O- Overall, a nice kolsch. Very reminiscent of the german kolsch's I've had in the past in the mineral taste. I look forward to having more of this during the summer."
""
"O: Great drinkability. Nice and refreshing. Another great seasonal brew from Summit, glad it replaced the Hefe."
""
""
"Clear, pale gold colour. Lasting, sticky head. Fresh bread, honey, hay and flowers in the nose, very gentle. Crisp flavour. A bit of soft, grainy malt up front is followed by an intising, floral/haylike hop character. Noticeable hop bitterness for a dry, curt finish. Carbonation is prickly, but not overdone. Sub 5% abv makes this a beer you can reasonabley consume in quantity. Well done. A perfect summer beer that really seems to capture the essence of the season."
"O= This is a home run from Summit. A well made ""summer"" beer. I don't care the style or the flavor this is an all around awesome summer beer. I'll be drinking a ton of this over the summer and enjoying every last drop. Seek this beer out and enjoy the hell out of it. I know I will be."
"This would be extremely easy to put back several. Very clean and refreshing, yet has enough depth as to not get boring. This makes a great summer drinker."
