"O - Kölsch beers are not my favorite style. This is a decent beer. Reminds me of the old rust belt lagers of the 1970's with a little more flavor."
"Very good refreshing summer beer"

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 3/21/2014. Pours slightly hazy bright gold color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a light amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon, pear, apple, cracker, biscuit, light honey, herbal, straw, grass, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance of pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon, pear, apple, cracker, biscuit, light honey, herbal, straw, grass, and yeast earthiness. Light earthy/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, pear, apple, cracker, biscuit, light honey, herbal, straw, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and robustness of pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; with a very clean malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and slightly bready mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with only a minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Kolsch style. All around good robustness and balance of pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"Really nice. I haven't had many Kolsch's at all, but this is my favorite so far. It's just a great beer.A light ABV beer that isn't light on flavor is always a plus. For the style, this IS outstanding."

"A great spring time style beer, smells great looks great and taste great. Bottled for the first time in 2012 wish they had bottled it in 2013 but is currently at the pub and worth a growler fill for sure. Not my favorite style of beer but done well enough that I like it."

"Super-drinkable and light, although this suffers a bit from being just a tad uninteresting by the time you reach the second half of the beer. Nice example of the style and overall very enjoyable for what it is, no doubt."

"O: Refreshing and generally enjoyable. Metallic taste is a bit off-putting. I would like another and I did buy again. Nice to have on a hot day."

"D - this is a pretty good Kolsch. Not as refreshing as others I have in this style, but pretty good to drink on this 94 degree day."
"Although it is not quite as ""clean"" as a traditional Kolsch, this offering is quite tasty in it's own right."
"Pours a mostly clear, yellow color. Not too much of a scent with some grains and wheat. Taste is rather malty while the texture seems a little too thin. There are some hints of citrus. Being my first Kolsch style beer, I’m not sure if this is good or not for the style. Quite drinkable, just wish there was some more volume and taste to the beer."
"Creamy light feel, a crisp bite in the middle, dry bitterness in the aftertaste. Soft grains, light fruitiness of trace bitter orange peel, wondering if that's the twist mentioned on the label. Quenching and sessionable. Overall a nice Kolsch that is subtle and balanced."

"O- A tasty beer on a scorching summer night. Drinks really nicely."
"D - A nice American-made Kölsch that I'd happily drink again. Seems quite tame for a Short's offering, but based on some of their recent output that may be a good thing."

"O - Excellent brew for a warm summer day. I'm not a Kolsch expert, but this seems relatively true to style with a bit morebl bitterness, which seems like a Short's hallmark. Also, Short's lists this at 5.5% abv, which seems right as I don't get any prominent alcohol from this."
""
"OVERALL IMPRESSION - the yeast presence definitely adds a nice twist on a style that might need a kick in the ass every now and again. I always like to see what Shorts is up to and I think they typically push boundaries in a good way. i was definitely pleased and i wouldn't mind drinking more of these at a lake instead of a computer."
""
"Cheers!!"

"O- Pretty straight forward, especially for Short's. Maybe a little hoppier than some. Awesome hot weather beer. I'm going to grill some chicken in a bit. It should pair nicely with my second bottle. This could beer an everyday drinker. Worthy of a case, much less a full sixer."
"Overall I enjoyed this beer and I thought it was a good example of the style, this beer had just about everything that this style is known for with just a slight twist to let you know that this is a Short's brew. This beer had great drinkability, it was very smooth and refreshing, with enough flavor to hold my attention, I could see drinking a bunch of these on a hot summer day, a good warm weather beer just as the style intends. What I liked most about this beer was that is was very well rounded and pretty true to style. What I liked least about this beer was nothing, but I do wish this beer wasn't so limited, my local beer store only got two cases that's not a lot when it comes to this style of beer. I would buy this beer again if there's any left when I go back, it's six pack worthy, but with it being so limited it will not last, I recommend this beer to anyone, just a clean, tasty, drinkable beer. Short's did a great job with this beer and they kept it pretty traditional but I did enjoy the slight citrus aspect that you don't normally get in this style, it was a nice addition to this beer and it worked well with the other flavors. This is now my favorite Kolsch, it was New Hollands Full Circle, but I find this beer to be slightly better. I am glad you guys decided to bottle this beer and I hope to see more of it next summer, good job guys this is another solid brew from one of my favorite brewery's."
"This is a cloudy golden color and only slightly fizzy. Smell has a mix of sour lemon, slight hops, and some sweet honey and grain. Taste is a very balanced mix between sweet honey, sour lemon, and bitter hops and orange peel. This is very drinkable and refreshing."
"Appearance is golden-yellow and not completely transparent. Very effervescent bubbles float rather quickly to the top. A 1/4 finger of white head. Smells bready, grassy and with some esters. Refreshing, clean with some fruitiness. Everything is subtle with not one taste overpowering another. Mouthfeel is light and airy. Overall, I enjoyed the pilsener like qualities of it and can appreciate the slight fruitiness the ale yeast brings. I would have liked to see it more clear though. A great beer for summer."
"Light, slightly toasted malt up front. Clean, bready, almost cereal-y. Maybe a touch of honey. Herbal, peppery, spicy hop bitterness arises and crescendos. Hint of pine in the finish. Dry and clean and very thirst-quenching on this hot evening! Moderate body with a crisp feel. Very tasty and perfect for the summer."

"Overall- like i said i'm mostly a hophead but this beer seems very refreshing. the floral hops come out at the right time. got a growler to take home so i'm happy."
"kolsch's are awesome."
"The beer appears a golden yellow and pretty clear with a thin white head that leaves random traces of lacing on the snifter. The aroma brings some grain, malty sweetness, and subtle fruit & floral notes. The flavor is quite good, and well balanced. This is one of the better examples of a kolsch I have had, especially from an American brewery. The sweetness is there, but I couldn't see this beer becoming cloying. Nice grain and yeast flavors as well. I could put away a liter stein of this. Well done."
"O: The beer is easy to drink and has some refreshing properties."
"Pours a clear golden color with a good, lasting white head. Good retention and a bit of spotty lacing on the way down. The nose brings forward a slight bit of grain plus some slight floral hops. Really good balance between those two. The flavor really nails the grain with light hop flavor and smooth hop bitterness. Light body and good carbonation. Really well done. This rivals COAST's 32/50 as the best Kolsch I've ever had. One day I'll go to Germany and we'll see how they compare to the real stuff."
"Wet, thin, watery but all in a good way. This beer is a quencher for sure. I could kill a keg of this stuff. It has a great mildly bitter finish. Mild but appropriate sweetness. Probably one of my favorites from the night."
