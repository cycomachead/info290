Smells about like a draft-in-the-can macro lager, but less strong. That would be malt more so than hops, and possibly a trace of adjunct (some Kölsches have a smidgeon of wheat, not sure about the Sam Adams variety). Very well-balanced. I prefer beers that more heavily favor either the hops or the malt or even the alcohol — up to a point. I'm not terribly enthusiastic about middlers. Taste is lager-like. More bitter as it lingers. Moderately clean finish. Pairs well with spaghetti, seasoned, sans sauce.","Libeertarian","Mar 12, 2015"

3.91,14.7,3.75,3.25,4.25,4,4,"Pours in to a fluted glass with a slightly hazy, chilled golden color. Less clarity than I anticipated. The short-lived head of white foam recedes to a small ribbon of lithe lacing. The aroma is relatively simple, consisting of a honey-like fragrance, floral hop notes and little lemon citrus. Altogether, it reminds me a little of summer time and makes me yearn for warmer weather. The first sip brings a bright, vibrant flavor of cracker-like malts, with a nice balance of citrus hop bitterness. A little milled grain lingers in the finish. Medium bodied, with a little more heartiness than I expected. Still, it's exceptionally crisp and clean. Spritzy carbonation adds a little zest. This is a fantastic palate cleanser that stands in nicely any time you're tired of the mega-brews that we beer advocates tend to gravitate to. It may have just earned a place in my fridge when I'm looking for a good Kolsch.","JohnnyI","Feb 09, 2015"

This offering pours out a great thick head with very good lacing, although I really am not a huge fan of cloudy beers.  The odor was interesting if not enjoyable mix of fruit and yeast.  This was by far the most outstanding mouthfeel I have had to date - incredible smoothness, very crisp and very light.  The mix of half-ale half-lager works extremely well - much more so than what I expected.

Honey, fruit, cereal, and spice in the mouth.  Some bready caramel malt again, which seems a little out of place and lessens the softness that the style requires.  Still, easy drinking and nicely crisp.  Plenty of that Sam Adams house character too, which can sometimes distract an otherwise decent beer.","wedge","Feb 01, 2015"

Escape Route is an unfiltered brew you can not see though it.  The smell is rich with flavor, grains and, malts.  You also pick up on a sweetness in this brew brew.  The taste is nice, you pick up a hit of citrus, grains, and malts. The mouthfeel is nice and clean. There is nothing overpowering in this brew,  it has a nice balance to it.

Initial taste is fruity like an ale, but has a bad aftertaste of malts similar to what you would find in a Coors Lite.

The aroma got me excited, but the main initial flavors here are closer to a typical American lager, although there is biscuit and German style hops in the finish.

The brew smells like bready/grainy malt, fruit (mostly apple), and some light herbalness. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some grassiness, pear and lemon peel noticeable.

It leaves a string of fluffy lacing on the sides of the glass, and smells of clean cracker malt and subtle herbal hops with a minty hint. There is even a buttery bread quality to everything. On the tongue, the beer tastes nicely crisp with sweetness and herbal, grassy bitterness. Very soft acidity gives a bright tingles at the sides of the cheeks. In flavor, the beer opens with soft cracker malt, opening into almost cidery sweetness and grassy bitterness that mingles to nearly cool mint herbal flavors. The finish is cidery and dry with a touch of herbal mint. The beer ends with a balance of sweet bitterness. In the mouth the beer feels on the light side of medium in body with a nearly crisp mouthfeel, a prickly carbonation. The mouth is left dry yet sticky with lots of saliva running in the pouches of the cheeks. Overall, this is a nice, crisp and refreshing kölsch. It’s a little too sweet for my taste, but is refreshing and a nice example of the style. Another nice beer from Sam Adams.","Maxwell","Mar 03, 2014"

The yeast supports the hops with a clean flavor in general and adds a nice dry quality as it finishes. The flavor was interesting enough for me to enjoy the full glass and want more. I like the treatment and while I don't think it is the best example of the style it is pretty tasty.","Slatetank","Jan 22, 2014"

3.39,-0.6,3.25,3.5,3.5,3,3.25,"Overall I thought this was a decent beer and a pretty standard and fairly true to style example of the style, it had most of those Kolsch qualitys that I look for and there didn't seem to be any off flavors or aromas. This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, clean, crisp, not too filling, and the taste did a decent job at holding my attention, I could see myself drinking a few of these, but it's not really something I would drink a lot of in the winter time. What I liked the most about this beer was the taste and aroma, they were the highlights of this beer and they seemed to fairly true to style. What I liked the least about this beer was the mouthfeel, it wasn't bad, but I thought it was a little thicker then it should be. I might buy this beer again when it gets warmer, but chances are since it's a limited release it won't be around, but the label says it's good til June so if i see some around when it's warmer I might pick up a six pack. I would recommend this to anyone who likes Kolsch's. All in all I thought this was a pretty solid Kolsch, it had most of the aspects that I look for in the style and I thought it was pretty drinkable as it should be. Good job Samuel Adams, this was another solid session beer, keep up the solid work.","StoutHunter","Jan 21, 2014"

The aroma is clean, with some light pale malt flavors, a bit of fruit (peach?) and some very distant herbal hops. Nice, but nothing outstanding. The flavor is balanced, with a soft malt foretaste and a little more assertively prominent hop bitterness than I expected for the style. In fact, a little spiciness due to the hops comes out at this finish. The body is at the low end-of medium, with an easy smoothness. Good, but not great.","Suds","Jan 19, 2014"
