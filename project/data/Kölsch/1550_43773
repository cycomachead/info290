Sort of like a fruitful, heavier Miller Lite.  Better than that sounds though. Lucky would drink it.","uvachief","Aug 18, 2014"

I ordered a flight of six of their standard beers and as I tried each one I found that each was spot on to the style. The remarkable thing is how unremarkable the beers are. Don't get me wrong, they are well worth the try and certainly above average but they are produced for a mass market. So as lazy as it may be I am going to simply say that this beer was a text book example of the style without breaking out and setting itself above.","KYGunner","Feb 18, 2014"

3.41,3.3,3.25,3.5,3.5,3.25,3.25,"this one is way too light, even for the style. it pours an almost clear watery yellow color with about 30 seconds worth of white foam before it goes flat. the nose is really understated as well, a touch of german malt and some mineral heavy water is all I really sense. indeed no yeast or hops makes it into the flavor profile, and while kolsch is a lighter style by nature, it isn't supposed to be a dumbed down beer for the light beer crowd. that's what the rock bottom version is, and I was disappointed. carbonation was a little weak, and the body was just far too thin. it was an easy mug to drain, but I derived very little satisfaction from this one. the first rock bottom beer that I haven't really enjoyed, I think they've got a good thing going, especially for a chain, but this kolsch is a let down.","StonedTrippin","Jan 12, 2013"
