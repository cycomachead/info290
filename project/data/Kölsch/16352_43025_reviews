"08/20/13 At Rattle N Hum on tap. Lovely & light in texture but full of flavor. This is a kolsch that pushes the boundary in a good way. A good choice if you have the chance."
"Light, clean, pilsner malt aroma. No hop aromas. No diacetyl or esters. Pale yellow with a slight haze which is acceptable for the style. Solid, rich, white foam with low retention as it quickly reduced to large soapy bubbles. Medium-light body and smooth, with medium to high carbonation through the middle and slight puckering sensation near the finish. No warming effect. Light pilsner malt flavor up front wit a crisp, clean, dry finish. Good attenuation. No diacetyl. Light, citrusy, hop bitterness at the end. Finished crisply with a light, bready, pilsner malt flavor. No esters. A light, malty beer that is nicely balanced by light bitterness near the finish."

"Not a bad beer. Pours a beautiful orange-amber color with a decent head. Aroma is extremely light. Flavor is also very mild with hints of hops and a touch of citrus. This beer is very refreshing and easy drinking. Crisp, clean finish."
"Give one of these to your BMC pals, they'll love it."

"8/9...pours medium dark copper. White foam layers, settles with a ring. Clean crisp nose but light. Taste has a nutty start, then fades into a light hop. Clean finish. Chewy. Bready. Much happening for something so simple."

"Poured from a can into a chilled mug. Pour was a clear golden color with a small head that didn't last long. Delicate but slightly fizzy mouthfeel. More flavorful than I expected with a slightly bitter finish. Hints of citrus throughout. The bitterness wasn't a hoppy bitterness. Overall a nice refreshing, very drinkable beer"

"O: The more I drank this beer the more it grew on me, I just had to re-adjust my palate from the usual hop-bombs I have. It takes a quality touch to make a clean kölsch and this one is successful"

"Much more impressive by the second glass. At first I was afraid it was too old, but this beer grew on me. Might have been even better in the summer."
"There I was, attempting yet another Stupid Human Trick, doing the inverted Glug near the keyboard, but the Crack! left me anxious to begin the beguine. The resulting two fingers of foamy, French Vanilla-colored head were already fizzing and foaming by the time that I sat the CAN back down. I had low expectations for its sustainability and i was not disappointed, either, as it rapidly fell to wisps. Color was a deep golden-yellow (SRM = 4 - 5) with NE-quality clarity and suddenly, Mammon, Croesus and Midas were across from me, wearing party hats and shouting, ""Faisons la Fete!"" I had no idea that those idiots were bilingual, but ""Let's Party!"" means ""Drink up!"" to me. Nose had a clean, biscuit maltiness. Mouthfeel was medium with a biscuit/bready flavor on the tongue. I did not sense much in the way of hops, but then again, that is not the purpose of the style. Finish was semi-sweet, so there must have been some hops in the mix, keeping the malt sugars from overwhelming the beer. I know that it is a summer beer which I was drinking in early winter, so that makes me CANsider what it would be like on a hot, humid day. I would be willing to bet that it would be nice and refreshing. Tonight, it just makes me want to drink another beer."

"O: I could definitely see this being a rock-solid refresher on a warm day. There isn't much place for this beer in my fridge right now; but give me a couple friends, 100 degree weather, and outdoor work, and I guarantee a case of this will get killed faster than you can say ""gimme that wheelbarrow, ya jackass."""
"O: This is a nice American kolsch from Blue Mountain. It's straightforwardly refreshing and tasty, while including some unique character to separate it from other lighter beer styles."
"O-a really good, light bodied but well-flavored beer. Definitely could be an easy drinker during the spring and summer."
"A nice refreshing beer. Not as exciting as the best in class, but enjoyable nonetheless. Light and fairly crisp. If you want something light to go with food, this is not a bad choice. It could stand more in its flavor profile but goes down easy. Not bad."

"A thanks goes out to woodychandler for this beer. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is very light, a tiny bit of malts, not much there. Taste is malts, grains, light floral notes, refreshing. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a decent beer, but nothing special."

"O: This beer is easy to drink but seems like it could use a little hops."

"Not a bad beer, but not a really great representation of the style. Flavor is a bit weak and the grainy malt stands a bit out in the flavor."
"A bit cloudy on the pour. Minimal head. Pretty good flavor profile, for an American made kölsch. Nice level of sweetness. Seems slightly thick in a way that seems unfiltered, which is reflected by the somewhat cloudy tone of things. I like this. Very easy to drink. This is one to have more than one of"
"O- A very nice kölsch. Refreshing with nice flavor for a lighter style."

"""A light German-style ale indigenous to Cologne. This ale is treated like a lager, undergoing extensive cold aging to produce a clean, crisp beer. German Pilsen and Vienna malts and Hallertau region hops lend a balanced flavor to our lightest beer."""

"D: I wish I could pinpoint this aroma/flavor, but I have to guess it is not desired. not sure exactly what it is, but I know I don't desire it. I have had this at the source, much better than this."

"Clear golden pour with an average, fizzy white head. About as good as it gets for a kolsch, as far as looks go. Aroma of sweet pale malts, toasted grains, distant grassy hops. About the same in the taste, pale malts, corn sugar, toasted grains, light grassy hops with a slightly metallic aftertaste. Light in body, and easily drinkable, but mainly for the less adventurous imbiber. German. Kolschy."

"This would make a great lawnmower beer. Nice, refreshing, straight forward beer!"

"O: Extremely easy to drink with the lower ABV, refreshing taste, and pleasant flavors. Definitely worth having again and something I could see being easily sessionable on a warm summer evening sitting out on the patio. Pretty well balanced as the beer is not too sweet."

"O - Overall, I enjoyed having this crisp, refreshing beer that paired nicely with the fish sandwich lunch special. As light and easy-drinking as this beer is, I could certainly have had a few more while enjoying my time at Blue Mountain Brewery at the foot of the Appalachian Mountains."

"Drinkability: As with other Kölsch, this one is great for summer. It was easy to drink and light to the belly."
"sixer from WF Arlington"
"Very well crafted kolsch. One of the better warm weather beers I've run across in awhile."
"O=I love Blue Mountain, but this is so-so compared to the other beers they put out."
"d - A pretty average kölsch; nothing really stood out in the smell or taste. Wouldn't seek out again but might give another shot."
"The body is crisp, wet, and refreshing. Perfect for this light style. The fruit comes through in the flavor, mirroring this nose with notes of Granny Smith apples, honey, white bread, and a grassy finish. There was a bit of a hop kick on the back end as well. Nice change of pace. Good beer."
"Very easygoing mouthfeel. It all adds up to one drinkable beer. I am making a mental note to have more Kolsch's this summer."
"Very drinkable."
"Drinkability: This is a very easy to drink beer. Each sip leads naturally to the next and the glass is soon empty. It would be very easy to drink another and another.... I definitely will have this one again."
"D: An easy drinking brew and I was really surprised at this beer. Great beer for the summer with light body but good lagerish crispness and just the right balance of graininess, breadiness, and hops flavor. Excellent brew from BMB."
"this little brewery is for sure va's pride and joy. mildly hazy straw color with a nice white head that holds well for a kolch. nose and taste are extremely well balanced mix of biscuity malt, fresh grain, grassy hop and a touch of va mountain barn. light body with a silky mouthfeel that carries just a touch of bitter in the finish. gotta love what the hallertau can do. perfect for a summer afternoon. this one goes down way too easy. well executed. just about the best kolch style i've had this side of koln. highly recommended for any kolch fan and highly recommended period."
"D: This beer is a great thirst quenching brew. So smooth and easy drinking with a nice dryness that keeps you coming back. This is an amazingly sessionable brew. The flavors are good along with everything else going on in here. Sure the aroma could come out a bit more. This a perfect beer on a hot ass day after mowing the lawn. Lovin it."
"Another great extra from IBUnit63. Thanks Larry! Pours a golden yellow color with shades of orange in the middle, large frothy white head that fell slowly with good lacing. Looks great for a Kolsch! Aroma is husky and grainy, lightly herbal and grassy, not much in the way of sweetness. Taste is standard fare for a lager-type brew. Grainy malts, some light breadiness, hops are present but way int he background. Lightly malty and lightly hopped, but nicely balanced for the flavors that are there. This is a great summer drinking beer, an easy one to put down. Good stuff. I wish I had more local drinkable beers like this one near me."
"I must admit...I don't gravitate towards Kolsch or Kolsch-style ales, but having this on tap and now in a bottle has yet again proven that open minds prevail. This is a solid, easy-drinking, straightforward ale with good ingredients and fine craftsmanship. Glad I have some to bring home."
"Drinkability: A perfect summer afternoon beer - it's thin and light, crisp and low in alcohol."
"Flavor is hoppier than I was expecting; what a great surprise! Bitter grassy hops blended to near-perfection with some biscuity malts and honey. Very crisp, well-carbonated body that finished bitter and left me refreshed and wanting more. Definately one of the more solid Kolsch's I've come across."
