"Great beer to drink down in hot sunny Florida. Nice pilsner malt flavor with a light tart kick from the Kolsch yeast."
"Good example of what it is.  Great beer for outside on a hot day.  Hard to give big numbers to some of these lighter beers for look and smell, but very enjoyable."

"Better than a colors lite. But not much"

"pretty average appearance and smell, but is pretty dang tasty. Definitely worth a try if you haven't yet."

"Gave me a headache."

"Crispy and tasty, one of the best domestic kolsch in my opinion."

"Tastes like your traditional kolsch beer. Very smooth compared to other beers I've tried in its bracket. Compliments bbq burgers and chicken well."

"O: Difficult for me to rate - this is a good example of a Kolsch. Even the poor head retention is within style guidelines of the BJCP. Ratings above are for style - I would estimate a score based on my preferences would be closer to 3.35.This rather tasted like a better quality AAL. I could envision this being an excellent ""craft conversion"" beer, but it's nothing I'd grab repeatedly on purpose. Just glancing at the label, I thought this was going to be an APA…should have read better. Still, it's more than drinkable and refreshing while it's cold."

"This is nicely crafted. Clean, crisp, doesn't try to be bigger or bolder than it should be. It's an easy drinking beer for those who actually *like* beer. If I were in southeastern Texas, immediately after cursing life for putting me there, I'd grab some of this. Good stuff."

"I like that a grassy hop bitterness is present. However, the other flavors are too astringent and unappealing to make it a beer worth having."

"Fancy lawnmower beer, indeed. A nice session ale."

"i mean, kolsch is a real light style, so don't expect huge things out of any of them as far as mind blowing complexity or anything, but as they go, this is a really nice one, light and drinkable, and not totally boring. it pours clear golden as you would expect, with a very obvious high level of carbonation, millions of little bubbles race eagerly to the surface and pile up in an inch of white head. it smells like german malts, light and easy, a little grassy. I get the label after a sip, this is lawnmower beer for sure. hot summer day, lots of sweaty yard work to do, this is your horse (if founders all day doesn't work for you). grassy finish, light and clean, refreshment to the max when ice cold. I haven't had a lot from saint Arnold, but what ive had so far I have enjoyed. solid American made kolsch here."
""
""
"O- This beer would actually be pretty decent if it had more flavor. I guess it doesn't put up a front though since it's clearly meant to just be a thirst quencher and not much else."

"Slightly plain on the appearance and smell, but surprisingly flavorful overall. Interesting and challenging mouthfeel. Refreshing, but not necessarily compelling. Like the Saint Arnold Weed Whacker better. But this would be a good go-to beer for a group that might have a variety of preferences. There is a little something for everyone here, with the exception of the malt-lover."
"Very light golden color, with a sweet smell. A very fizzy, fuzzy mouthfeel, which I personally don't prefer. The flavor follows the smell and fairly sweet. Not much bitterness here, and the sweetish flavor stays in the mouth for quite awhile. Overall, a reasonably refreshing beer that isn't too heavy."

"o – this may be an older keg due to lack of CO2 and the slight cardboard flavor. based on this sample would probably pass if offered again."
""
"It's very good beer."
""
""
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Fair head and some slight lacing, lots of carbonation. Nose is light and bready with some dried grass or hay. Light hints of wheat, grain, and citrus zest. Overall, this is a pretty good quaff."

"The beer is clear and light golden with a pure white head. The aroma is mild, offering grain, slightly sweet, a hint of fruit. A bit of toast and mild sweetness in the flavor. Pretty bland, but a good chaser for washing down some hot wings."

"Overall: A solid Kolsh that would be a good lawnmower beer."
"O: Easy to drink as the mouthfeel is light and the flavors refreshing and thirst quenching - definitely sessionable. This would be a great beer for drinking on a hot Austin summer day, especially if you were outside doing yard work. I enjoyed this one."

"I picked up a 6 of this because it was on sale. Mistake. Pours with a moderate head that persists fairly well. Initial nose indicates that this might have a Kolsch taste to it, but scents can be deceiving. The first taste is surprisingly disappointing. There's a strong hint of corn, and some degree of bitterness. It completely lacks any bread flavor that I associate with a quality Kolsch. Rather, it has the mouth feel of an American lager+. In that sense, it's clean and non-offensive, and definitely a pounding beer -- as in just finished mowing the lawn in Texas beer. I hope Saint Arnold's reformulates this with possible adjustments to the malt and yeast (or rebrands it for what it is, along with a steeper price reduction), because a good Kolsch is hard to find. As is, it's disappointing, and I'll be avoiding it and its sidekick, Weedwacker."

"Poured into a pint glass. Pours the color of pale straw with a tall, quickly dissipating white head. Plenty of tiny bubbles can be seen rising from the bottom of the glass. There's also the appearance of some sediment. Some lacing is left behind on the side of the glass as the head dissipates. The aroma is of malt and yeast. It's a very basic sweet, bready smell. That sweet breadiness from the yeast and the malt hits the mouth up front. There are some minor hop notes, but these are not strong. The body is light with moderate carbonation. The finish is crisp and dry. The drinkability is high, especially on a hot summer day. This is a very good beer that is perfect for summer consumption."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O. I'm not familiar enough with Kolsch to rate it to style but I don't think I'd go for this again. A good German or Czech style pilsner is what I go for on a hot day, and there are plenty of hot days in south central Texas. This beer is just a little too cloying to cut through the heat for me."
""
""
""
""
"D/O: Not bad for a light beer. I see what the *fuss* is about. On a hot summer day, would follow this up with another without blinking."
""
"This is a great, refreshing light beer choice for a warm spring/summer day. I would drink it again."

"Quite enjoyable, this would be great on a hot summer day, a cool spring day, a crisp fall day, or just about anytime! Definitely recommend this if you're looking for an easy drinking tasty brew."

"Fancy Lawnmower doesn't leap at you with over-powering tastes and smells. It a light beer overall, yet has enough distinction with taste and mouthfeel, coupled with a relatively low ABV to make it a respectable session beer."

"I'll be buying many more cases of these. One of the more enjoyable beers I've had, although better in the summer than in the wintertime. Fortunately, in the brewery's home city, Houston, it's essentially summer most of the year..."

"O - Its an ik beer. I dont think ill ever buy it again."
"Overall-Great alternative to a fizzy yellow lager. Very drinkable and clean. Kept very simple and well done."
"Bocce."
"O-this isnt a bad beer. just not my type of beer. it was better than i had expected though, and refreshing."
"O: Good summer time beer. Would probably not seek it out, but its worth a try. Definitely refreshing."
"O: This is definitely a beer for the summer, I could see myself drinking several out in the sun. Less watery than the Saint Arnold Summer Pils but somehow more refreshing. I don't think I'd pick this one up in any other season though..."
"O: This is a very drinkable beer and my first real kolsch. I enjoyed the style for what it is, but I wouldn't go out of my way to enjoy one on a regular basis. Unless its 100 degrees like it is now, then it tastes great."
"Overall: One of very few kolsch styles I've had, so difficult for me to rate to style. Great lawnmower beer, I suppose hence the namesake. Enjoyable, but perhaps a bit light for me."
"I could have swore I reviewed this before, I guess not. The beer pours a slightly cloudy pale yellow color with a thick foamy white head that left a lot of lacing. It smells mostly of biscuit malt with butter, honey, grassy hops and lemon. It tastes the same as it smells, very mellow flavors of malt and grassy hops. It feels light but not thin, soft/ perfect carbonation and a slightly dry finish. This a solid beer, enjoyable in all seasons, not just summer."
"This beer isn't BAD, it's just not something that I'm particularly a big fan of. I wouldn't buy it again, but if someone offered me one, I would drink it."
"A refreshing beer on a hot day. Wouldn't be my first pick for a lawnmower beer though. Doesn't quite live up to the style profile."
"This is not my favorite fizzy yellow beer but it is better than the BMCs. I definitely like the other Saint Arnold beers better. But this one is worth a try."
"4.0 D: Good lawnmower beer. Goes down super easy. Leagues above the corny taste of a macro, but not much flavor overall."
"O - a good brew to keep things easy, im actually doing this as i watch a TABC license video. refreshing and a summer brew, don't expect to knock any socks off though."
"Pours a slightly hazy straw color with a one finger head that gives way to a little lace. The aroma is of grassyness and grains, faint and very hard to get but par for the glass. The taste is of grains and grass but with a nice sweet fruity touch. Kinda like a banana or a sweet yeast. The mouthfeel is thin and moderately carbonated. Overall it was a little more flavorful for a kolsch than what I have had in the past. The fruitness makes it stand out a bit, this is a very light and refreshing beer."
"O: A great warm weather beer. Slightly different than other kolsch I have had but a great beer and decent representation. Will buy again and recomend."
"A slightly hazed, light yellow with white head that fades to a thin collar with spotty lacing. Light grain, grass, and a green grape nose. Tastes of grain and faint herbal hop with some sweetness from malt showing up as it warms. Thin bodied and has a crisp carbonation. I generally prefer beers with more flavor, but this is a great hot weather or....""after using the lawnmower"" beer."
"mouthfeel is medium viscosity, could use a bit more carbination for a crisper feel."
"O: Overall, I didn't think anything about this beer was extraordinary. At first sight, smell, taste, it appears simple. However, calling it simple does not do it justice. This simplicity is what makes this beer an excellent option on a hot day or against the many lesser quality options available."
"Thanks to JayAre46 for this one!!"
"Decent beer; subtle, but also interesting depth if you really looked for it."
"Overall: A very clean kolsch. Above average and certainly sessionable on a warm day. Not the first thing I would reach for, but far from the last as well."
"Grassy yellow colored with a low white head that settles out quickly. Low aroma of doughey malt and some corn notes. Flavors fairly match the nose - doughey malt and mild corn notes, moderate hop bitterness, delicate flavors, good example if the style. Slightly watery mouthfeel, finishes with tingly carbonation, followed by a mild pepper spice."
"Big thanks goes out to optimator13 for sending me this one in The Small Aquatic Mammal BIF '11! Served from bottle into a Mother Earth strange. Poured a slightly hazy pale yellow with a three finger pure white head that subsided to one finger almost instantly. Mainatined decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wheat, grain, grass clippings, and skunk hop. The flavor was sweet malt, wheat, skunky hop, and slight nutmeg. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew, but it wasn't too awe-inspiring. I found it odd that grass clippings showed up in the aroma though, but I guess it was only fitting. I usually prefer Hefe's when I mow my lawn, but I could see me firing up the turbo lawnmower with this one on a hot summer day. Glad I got to try this one."
"RJT"
"Easy to drink and while not perfect, a likeable beer."
"Pours a fizzy yellow with a double finger of foamy white head. Smells like stale bread with a bit of stale sweet malts and corn, and some stale hops. This beer might be stale, but no date on the bottle, so who knouse ws. Taste is fizzy, bland and bland. The 24 oz. can of Genny Cream Ale I opened after this has more flavor. I want to like this because I have enjoyed other beers from St. Arnold, but I don't. I also don't mow my lawn, so maybe im out of my element here."
"P.S. Mine is good, but not as good as the SA."
"D: Great all around brew, a nice one to work with. Good sessionable taste and ABV."
"Mouthfeel is light, very clean and crisp. During the summer this would be super drinkable but right now not so much. Not a bad beer just a little bland"
"Beer is a pale golden in color. The head though doesn't last too long but has good body. I'm not seeing any lacing. Looks refreshing. The nose is floral with some sweetness and a touch of grains. In the taste you get the floral hops upfront with subtle hint of wheat, bitter grasses and some oats in the background. Hops are dominant. Mouth feel is clean and light bodied with bubbly carbonation. This beer would be great on a hot summer day. Perfect for mowing the lawn. Very drinkable stuff here."
"Well, as far as American Kolsh goes, this is pretty darn good! I love the name and it is very appropriate for the style. A Kolsh is so great for a summer day and so much better than most lawnmower beers. This pours a golden color with a one finger head. Lots of visible carbonation. The smell is of grain and hops. The taste makes me wish for a hot sunny day very refreshing! The grains, hops and efverescent carbonation make this a great summer day beer. It sure beats the hell out of budweizer."
"Light to medium body with medium carbonation. Very crisp, refreshing enough that having a few of these on a hot day would be nice."
"Extremely refreshing and easy to drink. Like the name says, this would be a fantastic beer to grab after mowing the lawn on a hot summer day."
"Aptly named - I can certainly see several of these going down quite nicely on a summer day. Clean malt flavor with minimal hopping. A light citric note intertwines vague grassy touches. Reminds me of an old school pils back when the macro brewed made stuff that at least tasted like beer."
"Overall, fairly basic kolsch. Not too much flavors, but I didn't expect a lot. Taste is better than the nose. Probably not something I would want to drink very much of. Much better kolshs out there."
"Nice enough, innocuous beer. Lots of better kolsches out there."
"D: Yeah, you can drink a whole lot of these beers. Only limiting factor on drinkability is the carbonation...lots of gas."
"Very drinkable."
"D. Crisp and refreshing. A bit more flavor and a lot more character than a lot of beers this would draw comparisons to. Not quite a Kolsch, but a beer I wouldn't turn down none-the-less."
"Light, refreshing, a bit on the sweet side but balanced hops. Has a slight green tint. Great from the tap or in the bottle. Perfect for hot summer days when you need to cool off after some yard work. I've had this straight from the beer hall in St. Arnold's beer hall, it doesn't get any fresher than that. I'd never turn one of these down."
"Lawnmower beer is right! It's light, refreshing, and low in alcohol, yet it doesn't sacrifice flavor like the American light lagers. Perfect for this time of the year."
"D - Overall, strong drinkability for those hot Texas summer days. The mouthfeel and flavor strike a pretty good balance between the lighter summer offerings like pilsners and the sometimes cloying hefeweisens. I could (and have been known to) finish off an entire six-pack in one sitting."
"Feel - The beer wasn't light and overly refreshing, but not to the extent that it could be called a heavy beer. It was a little stickier than I would have liked since a little more dryness would have complemented the flavors well."
"This beer was very drinkable. I would recommend this beer to anyone who wanted to stock their cooler with something refreshing and drink outside on a hot day."
"D: The flavor of this is not quite as bad as the aroma, but the smell of this beer just makes you not want to even try to drink it anymore."
"Drinkability: This beer isn't the best, but is a perfect beer for hot Texas summers. This brew also has more flavor overall than many of the ""lawnmower"" beers people may have in their fridge, and it has a better flavor overall. Recommended for a good tasting, or, at least, as a good summer refresher."
"Medium bodied and fuller than I expected with a nice crisp hop bite up front that provides a nice dry bitterness which is balanced out by pale malts, grass, straw and light apple and pear notes. Well balanced and very quaffable, especially in the hot ass weather down here."
"Drinkability: it was 85 degrees, I was outside, very refreshing and easy-drinking. A great beer after you get done mowing the lawn."
"Notes: Not necessarily identifiable as a kolsch, but it doesn't mess it up either. Just tastes like a clean light lager, could be a pilsner, but no hops."
"D - An enjoyable beer, quite sessionable and refreshing. Good with light meals -- ""American"" food or pub-fare."
"Overall I thought this was a nice beer although I'd like a crisper differentiation in flavors - the hops seem to run into the malt flavors instead of working with them. Still, an easy-drinker and it's worth a shot."
"Served chilled with a medium pure white head that fades fast. Smell is of fresh grain and a hint of yeast. Taste is surprisingly light malty up front, with a yeasty middle and clean finish. Mouthfeel is was good, low carbonation. Good drinkability, a nice simple beer that I would drink again."
"Poured into an imperial pint, formed a 1/2"" bright white head above the clear golden brew. Head falls gradually, with leggy slow-falling lace. Aroma is lightly sweet, with a somewhat vegetal character. Taste starts with pale malts, light bitterness in the middle, creamy close. Mouthfeel is smooth and soft over the tongue, and drinkability is good. Name fits purpose well."
"The mouthfeel is light and crisp with above average carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's an easy drinking beer with some decent flavors. It's a decent beer for the style and would be a good alternative to a macro but it's not really something that really excited me much."
"D: Goes does quite easily, not a great representation of the style, however a very tasty beer that I enjoyed a few pints of."
"D: lightish mouthfeel & taste lend well to easy drinking."
"Arrived with a finger's worth of bone-white head with low retention. Color was a light, pale yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a pleasant, lager-like sweetness. Mouthfeel was medium with a light honey-like taste on the tongue. Finish was soft, slightly dry and definitely refreshing. Lawnmower beer, indeed!"
"The beer isn't all that bad despite the negative comments. I expect a lot out of a Kolsch and this beer would make a better example of a Cream Ale. Thanks Exiled!"
"Very good beer. Two good Kolsch in a row are beginning to turn me on to a style I haven't dug too much until now. Well done, Saint Arnold."
"A very refreshing beer and I would enjoy this beer with a light fish or chicken meal."
"D: maybe not hi quailty stuff but SUPER drinkable. Maybe that's what they werer trying for. This would make a good beer to drink by the sixer. Way better than the rice-based macros!"
"Final thoughts: Its pretty refreshing and light, but has some interesting creamy banana yeasty vanilla yogurt like flavors and has a slightly spicey saison like feel but maintains a Bavarian Hefe style taste. It's strange for a Kolsh style but has a few interesting characteristics."
"Drinkability - loved it, heading back to Texas soon to stuff some more in my suitcase, it's not the best beer in the world, states or probably Texas but hit the spot when I drank it, and that's all I cared about. I think I'll get it on tap next time, hope it doesn't let me down."
"Pours out a pale yellow with a thin white heaqd. No lacing. Not much of a scent, but what there is of green hops. The taste is rather plain, but well balanced for what is there. Which makes the drinkablity not bad. This, as with most Kolsch beer, make for a good beer on a hot Texas summer day."
"D: If you are outside in the Houston heat, this should be in at least one of your hands."
"Drink ability is pretty good. Very session able, great, simple beer. A good substitute for a light beer but with more flavor."
"Overall- Did not disappoint me. It was pretty much what I expected. Clean on the palate and an easy drinker. Very nice on a hot TX summer day. I think this would be a good beer to lead into a nice IPA or IIPA later in the night."
"Body is slightly sweet with creamed corn and vegetable husks. Finishes with a burst of grassy, floral hops and crisp, clean bready malts. Each sip bubbles profusely, adding some zip to the body that lightens it as well. Goes down easily, I could put away quite a few of these in a setting on a hot day. Overall, a solid summer session beer, but I've definitely had better kölsch's than this."
"Good Job Saint Arnold."
"Mouthfeel & Drinkability aren't that bad. This beer goes down smooth with nice carbonation and slight watery mouthfeel. That weird corn aftertaste kind of disappoints, if the hops were amped up a bit, this would be a really great beer."
"I don't know if this is exceptionally fresh or just a remarkably well brewed Kolsch. I'm fall into the same trap as most other BAs in that I normally don't give strong scores to lighter flavored beers, but this one is done very well."
"D: this is a good summer beer and just as the name denotes, it's just right for mowing the lawn in a hot Texas day"
"Pours a slightly cloudy light golden color with a bubbly/fluffy white head that sticks around for a bit. Smells fruity with apples and lemons coming to mind, grassy, grainy, slightly malty. Taste is grainy and fruity. Carbonation level is high, it pierced the tongue with every sip. Body is light an quite quaffable. Mouthfeel sweet lightly syrup and malty. Great hot weather drinker here. Just enough sweetness light body, just great."
"excellent beer! Great for summer!"
"D: Most pale beers tend to have a skunky aftertaste to me, this beer is not necessarily an exception, but on the very lowest end of the spectrum. I could drink these all day and not complain a bit about it. It will drink better when cold, but is still VERY drinkable as it warms something I cannot say for any other beer that I know that's even close to this."
"""Fancy"" Lawnmower beer is the sort beer that BMC could and should be brewing. Not the best Kolsch I've had, but I'd reach for this in a quick minute during a hundred-odd degree Texas heatwave. Recommended."
"Finally a beer that is marketed to the lawnmowing crowd. I have a lawn man, but I'm still down with lawnmowers. The one on the front looks like a Toro I used to have. Pours a murky gold which clears around the edges. One and a half fingers of white head dissipates quickly, settling into a thin layer on top and leaving a fine sheet of lace. Smells of sweet hops mixed with some hops and subtle light fruits. Tastes of more sweet malts, a little honey, and a faint bit of spice. Hops aren't really noticeable, but the brew remains fairly tasty. Goes down easy and is well carbonated. The word refreshing comes to mind, and I'd say this would make an excellent summer brew to take on an outing or such. They should can this one."
"Crystal clear pale yellow; head comes up and out of the glass and then is gone in seconds leaving no lacing down the side. Citrus notes in the nose, but nothing overwhelming. Quite lemony at first, then kind of trickles off into a slight bitterness. Mouthfeel is nicely carbonated and quite smooth."
"I could drink the mess out of this. Although I'm glad I only got one from a mixed sixer. But i'm really glad I tried it."
"On the whole, this is a nice beer. It doesn't really match up stylistically with other Kolsch biers I've had, but it's not a bad effort. Especially in the nose, this beer really shines. A totally drinkable lawnmower brew. A fancy lawnmower brew, in fact. I can think of few brews I'd rather celebrate the growth of summer grass with more than this one. Cheers."
"Drinkability was great. The moderate ABV and cool refreshing qualities would make this great for a warm outdoor party."
"Drinks easy nough, a few will hit the spot on a warm day to be sure, fairly spot on for the style"
"Coming from a rural Texas setting, this beer brought back memories of sitting out in the country. It doesn't look unlike a thicker version of a BMC, but its typical. It has a popping white head, think Sprite. Smells and tastes almost like a wheat beer, but not quite. I pick up grains like corn and wheat. The nose also reminds me of hay and alfalfa fields back home. The mouth is lively and carbonated, and it seems to fit the beer well. Low ABV, no strong flavors make this extremely drinkable."
"D- It's swillable, but really I'm wondering if I have a bad bottle. This beer tastes so much of corn that it really reminds me of Coors Light and some other not too tasty macros. Hopefully that's not the intention of the brewers, but I suppose with a beer that's meant to be drank after mowing the lawn, maybe that's what they were going for. Who knows."
"Pours a very nice clean/clear golden yellow color, very nice carbonation, nice one-finger plus fizzy white head, which leaves some sticky lacing behind. The nose is malty, with some yeasty/grassy notes, with some spices. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, grassy, with spice. Light-Medium body. Drinkable, a nice brew."
"Golden yellow color, nearly no head, white. Aroma of malts, something else(plants?, grass?) Light watery taste, aftertaste of malts, nutty, fresh, fizzy, light tasting, sour front-taste, water-like, headache-inducing."
"Overall a very nasty bitter beer. Extremely disappointed in this Saint Arnold's brew. The grassy, yeast like flavor really makes it an unbearable beer."
"Drinkability: It's crisp, clean, and quite drinkable. Though I could personally do with just a small bump in hop bitterness, I ultimately found it to be a quality Kölsch."
"Light cereal graininess sligth and I mean very slight noble hop bitterness. Where this beer defines itself (like most beers seem to) is in the taste. Bright, crisp and clean. Honey sweet maltiness with a slight floral hop edge. Mouthfeel is snappy, this is where the hops are most noticeable. Maybe just the slightest bit of adjunct taste, I mean I can't say for sure if they are using adjuncts but there is a slight corny sweetness to this beer. I'm not saying its bad but it's a taste that I am not all that used to tasting. There is a slight spiciness here as well and covers up just a bit, the corny sweetness in this beer. I think that Full Circle has this one beat, but still a very nice, very drinkable beer."
"Not bad. This was light but still fairly flavorful and crisp drinking. Definitely the best ""lawnmower beer"" that I've had in a while. I'd grab one in an instant on a hot day."
"D- Very drinkable. Would be great for a session beer, and just one to kick back when having a cold one after a day of work."
"Overall, a beer that serves its purpose and by no means a bad brew. Good, but not at all great."
"Tastes pretty good too. Best described as cutting open a mild poblano pepper and licking the dark green flesh. Has a floral spicy finish and is quite dry. Light bodied, crisp and refreshing while maintaining a high level of flavor. This is a well done kolsch. I can see why it has won GABF awards."
"D= Highly drinkable beer that paired well with pizza. This would make a great, umm, summertime lawnmower beer!"
"Thanks to ballewblake for this one."
"Notes - This will become one of my favorite beers to drink on a summer day."
"Overall a crisp and tasty German ale that's highly drinkable. The aroma has sourdough notes with a bit of citrus character. And the flavor has a mix of dry biscuit malts with lemon. There's a subtle hop balance at the finish. Overall, a great lighter beer."
"3/3.5/4/3.5/5"
"Very nice year round offering from a fantastic brewery. This beer is easy to drink and highly enjoyable. Especially on those final hot summer weeks before the temps start to drop and it becomes stout season. Yum."
"Drinkability was okay. I finished the beer but wouldn't search for more of these. There were too many other good beers, by the same brewer even, for me to search out more of these. I'd drink it again though."
"M- Feels and drinks like a light beer with some viscous quality to it"
"D: Easy to throw back a few of these on a hot day. Nont a bad representation of the style, but not the best. Wouldn't pass it up, but wouldn't seek it out either."
"Pours out a slightly orange hue, with a bit of a haze. The head is white and minimal. The aroma is of untoasted malt and slightly of hops. Nice and clean...traces of lemon. It's a very subtle beer. Nothing over the top. Maybe even a little dissapointing."
"D- This beer ha a nice aroma but it is very light even for the style and the flavor is to clean. I like the flavors but I just wanted them to be a bit more pronounced."
"The perfect summer beer as far as I am concerned. During a hot summer day, it does not get much better than this."
"not sour enough and not cloudy at all, but full flavored for beer of this light yellow color, i think that this one wanted to be served with a slice of orange, or at least that is what i am going to do to my outher 2, this is good for a hot summer day. i would buy this one if it was avalabule in my area."
"Drinkability is very nice. Easy drinking and quenching. A great summer beer for scorching days."
"Poured a a light orange maybe e deeper yellow. Average carbonation with a small white head. The Graniy, grassy and fruity with little bit of hops is the best way I can describe the taste. A very small bite at the end from the hops but a drinkable beer for the style."
"A kolsch as noted here I'm having a hard time but as a pleasant hot wether summer beer it works. Sometimes, why ask why...."
"snifter. crystal clear pale yellow color. white head with low retention and low lacing. slight grassy aroma...could just be the name playing tricks on me. corn malts off the bat, very light malts. no big hop aromas. nice sweet citrus malt flavors, very light though. tons of corn malts. no distinct hop flavors. low to medium body. solid carbonation level. very easy to drink, nice and mild. great ""lawnmower"" beer....haha!"
"Overall I have to say I was quite impressed with this nice little light summer ale. I would have no issue with drinking this one again and in a good quantity to. As its name implies, this would be excellent while mowing the lawn!"
"Poured into standard pint glass. Cloudy golden color with one finger thick white head- quickly dissipates with minimal lacing on the glass. Smell is very interesting- something sweet, could be honey? Light spice aromas reminding me of my fave Kolsch (DragonMead's Kaiser's Kolsch). Nothing stands out in the taste- there isn't any kind of sweetness in that taste, lacking in body. This is where this one separates from DragonMead's. It's a very sessionable beer that lives up to its name, no doubt, but doesn't stand out in the taste field, and that's what is most important, right?"
"Cloudy yellow pour with thick dirty white head. Smells like coors light (sorry, I know that stings). Taste is masked by a WAY over carbonated mouthfeel. I guess through all that carbonic acid is sweet floral flavor with some citrus. Hops are there, but it's just not worth finding them...all the bubbles keep getting in the way. All I taste is beery soda water."
"Very pale cloudy light yellow, with a thick sticky white head. I smell mainly grassy hops with some floral as well. I taste floral soapy hops with some grassy notes and stingyness throught there is a hint of bready malts as well. Thee is a nice lasting flavor well after the finish. This is very light in body and super easy drinking."
"Not too bad. An easy summer beer, but the CO2 seems to be entirely too dominant."
"This is beer that I could definitely drink a lot of on a hot summer day. Plus here in Texas I can get a six pack for just a dollar or two more than a macro six. Out at the pool I can't think of a better option and look forward to trying more Saint Arnold brews."
"M/D - Medium bodied and highly carboanted. Very easy drinking beer."
"D - I've never been a kolsch fan. That being said, this was refreshing and might make me rethink any preconceived notions."
"D: Easy beer to enjoy. Nothing that is to extreme. Most people could enjoy this beer."
"Overall a nice solid kolsch that I could drink on any hot day. Nice little beer."
"this would be the perfect beer to down a couple of after mowing the lawn. a nice summer beer that would pair nicely with some grilled fish i think."
"After a hot sweaty day in Austin this beer was a welcome treat. 16 oz. pint poured a pale straw color with a decent white head that eventually dissipated leaving some lacing. Somewhat hazy appearance. This beer is delicate all around (as is the kölsch style). Slight lemony aroma and crisp malt flavor with a clean citrus finish. Very light, yet balanced. High drinkability due to the lighter body and lower alcohol."
"D : An excellent example of a kolsch-style. Easy to knock back some of these on a nice summer day"
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not filling at all, mild kick, very good representation of style, this is beer is exactly what the name implies, light, refreshing and well worth pounding down for a long time."
"Saint Arnold Fancy Lawnmower is a pretty good warm weather kolsch that should be more popular down in Texas than Shiner Bock... but probably isn't. For that matter, it should sell better than everything brewed by BMC... but probably doesn't. I enjoyed this one. Under the cap... 'Make beer, not war'."
" This is a decent spring time beer with it's easy quoff."
"D-A nice representation of style. Also, a beer with the perfect name. Certainly one I would grab after mowing the lawn!"
"Pours a bright clear yellow with a white head that settles slowly to a thin layer of foam. Slow but steady carbonation bubbles. Smells faintly of grassy grains. Taste is faint floral hops. Mouthfeel is somewhat buttery, very moist finish. Fairly clean drinkable, simple kolsch."
"This beer poured a golden straw color with a thin white head. The aroma was a grainy wheat smell. The taste was again a grainy crisp taste with low hop taste. Very refreshing. The mouthfeel was medium body with medium carbonation. Overall this beer doesn't pretend to be anything than what it is intended for..mowing the lawn. It is very refreshing which is perfect for just such an event."
"I think it hits the mark as a very good kolch style beer."
"D - Just like the name says its a fancy lawn mower beer perfect for when you want a beer thats cold and wet its not going to blow you a way but its still a good beer"
"D: Try as I might, this was w-a-a-a-y too easy to drink; I'm guessing no more than 5 or 6 'sips' was all it took to finish the glass. Light, perfect for summer warmth. Would have this all the time (between July & October) if available in Portland."
"I had this on tap during a tour of the Saint Arnold Brewery. The beer poured a straw colored with a nice foamy white head. The beer had a slight lemony/grassy smell and taste. I have had this beer out of the bottle numerous times, but this was the first time I had tried it on tap and it was definitely better on tap. It was also very cool to be drinking the beer while the founder of the company was telling me the history of it. This is one of my favorite hot weather beers and I would recommend it to anyone needing a beer to quench your thirst."
"Overall a very tasty kolsch that is supremely easy to drink. Thanks to brentk56 for this one."
"Verdict: While Kölsch is not one of my normal styles, this is certainly a beer I can enjoy. If I was outside in the heat at a ballgame, this would be an almost perfect choice."
"D - Great brew for a hot summer day, trumps most beers I have had of the style. Great beer to get any of your friends off the piss beers."
"White head, good hearty light sweet grassy, grain smell with almost no noticable bitterness, and almost creamy yet light. Light to medium carbonation, very easy to drink, but with a slight chemically twinge at times... A great summer beer all around, that is somewhat simple, and easy to drink."
"And twist-off = lawnmower beer for shure! I'd love a couple of these on a hot summer day."
"You may ask, why is he reviewing a Lawnmower in the middle of December?!? Well my friends, it is 77 degrees here in Atlanta today (record heat) and this beer just felt like the right one for the occasion. I understand what St. Arnold was trying to do with this one, and I think they definitely done it. Very refreshing and mild, but nice characteristics of a quality craft brew. Very nice guys! I enjoyed it."
"Thumbs up."
"It pours a hazy dirty-yellow with a light BMC beer looking head which quickly dissipates. Aroma is Kolsch-like (as I understand it); with some grainy-ness and a bit of metallic (think copper) smell. Flavor is more cereal-y than metallic, but with enough copper-ness to make me think of it as ""Kolsch-like"" in flavor. Not bad, but nothing to seek out. After cutting the grass on a hot day, I might opt for something else."
"D: A great beer for the Texas summers. I should have been paying more attention to this beer."
"I could make a session out of this easily."
"Actually, I can't believe I just wrote that."
"D: Im actually drinking this after finishing mowing my lawn. It is an excellent thirst quencher, and very light enough to kick back a few or more. If you want a nice segue from your standard pilsner, reach for Arnies Lawnmower."
"light but flavorful, I've got a new Lawnmower Beer ;]"
"Drinkability: Not really to style, this tastes more to me like a lager with a touch of adjunct"
"Great summertime beer. Good with various foods, especially white meats and Tex-Mex. This is a staple of my warm-weather beer drinking, and for good reason. Highly recommended. It's not the best beer that St. Arnie's makes, nor is it highly complex or unusual. It's just a good, down-home, session-beer for the lazy, hazy days of summer."
"Light body, with lots of carbonation. Pretty simple. Not crisp enough. Worth a try, but not outstanding."
"Drinkability: The name fits this beer perfectly. An unbelievable quaffable beer; perfect for drinking after mowing the lawn. Great on a warm spring evening, probably even better on a hot summer night. I wish this was local for me cause I would buy this by the case in the spring and summer."
"Pours a pale golden straw with a forced head that goes down quick but leaves some scattered lacing. Aroma is of mild pale malts, forceful graininess, lager-like sulfur notes and a cleanness rounding it out. Clean malt flavors meld with a subtle fruitiness. Finishes dry with a floral hoppiness. Mouthfeel is pretty light with a lively carbonation. SOlid drinkability."
"This is a very nice beer. I would recommend to anyone wanting a nice refreshing kolsch or pilsner."
"This is a great beer to get people started with tasting craft brews. This is what I started my wife on. Anyways, about the beer. Saint Arnolds has crafted a very accessible Kölsch, with a great light color, thin head, but a crisp refreshing taste. Year round brew. If you are new to brew, try it, if you are beer knurd then keep it for the people you are trying to convert."
"D - very drinkable. keep cold."
"D: This would be a good beer to drink by the pool."
"M&D - highly drinkable, the hops and malts, though alone are well balanced and easy to put back, would make a great session beer"
"Taste is a little bitey up front. A hint of lemon is evident. Sweet, low on the bittering hops, but nice and clean. Nothing overpowering here, and the flavors blend pretty nicely. A lawn mower beer indeed. This stuff goes down like iced tea. Rather thin mouthfeel with low carbonation. Again, lemony. Did lemon zest go into this? I like it, and thanks to my coworker Scot for bringing me a bottle from Texas."
"This is not a bad brew, but it would be a much better warm weather beer than a year round offering in my opinon."
"Clearish yellow with no real head. Looks macro-ey. Nose is grains and slight citrus. Taste is very mild corn. Where's the lawn clippings? Mouthfeel is decent. Drinkability is high-ish due to low ABV. Overall not too bad of a beer, it's probably a good light summery BBQ brew."
"Poured into a pint glass, from a 12oz. bottle. The beer poured a pale yellow, forming a 1 inch fluffy head, leaving light lacing on the glass. The aroma is bad on this one. Very skunky aroma. Thats about all that I can detect in the nose. The taste is a little better. Some light hops and a slight lemon flavor. Light mouthfeel. If it weren't for the smell, this beer might be a good one to have on a hot summer day."
"Not bad. Not great. Slightly above average drinkability given the style."
"Overall impression: Very nice session beer. This is a definitely more interesting than a lot of the lighter offerings some microbrewers put out. Definitely a great gateway."
"the name caught my eye, i just had to try it.nice creamy offwhite head.mouthfeel is good. pretty light compared to their other products.perfect beer for a hot south texas summer day.say like after fishing, golf or cutting the grass.cant go wrong with this one. i would recomend taking this to a party were you are trying to wheen your freinds off the light beer fad."
"Mild smell and flavor, making this beer very inoffensive (read: easily drinkable for anybody). Still, refreshing with some flavor. Not bad overall."
"An average Kolsch, and one that's easy to drink."
"Refreshing, yes, and quite drinkable, but it seems to lack the fruity yeast character of a good Kolsch."
"This stuff is pretty much exactly what you'd hope for when looking at it - not especially memorable, but quite pleasing and definitely suited to quenching one's thirst after a couple hours of yardwork. I'd have another - probably several in sequence, come to that, and I definitely wouldn't object to keeping a bit around the house for these summer days."
"Pours a nicely clear pale yellow. There's not much happening here flavor wise, but I guess that's the point with a ""lawnmower"" beer. Lightly carbonated it was surprisingly refreshing. This beer goes down very easy and would certainly make a nice conclusion to a day of yardwork."
"Carbonation and body are really superb for this brew with just the right amount of thickness without overdoing it. Sits a little heavy in the stomach with all the sweetness, but I could see fitting this into my schedule again sometime."
"Overall Impression: Refreshing! An easy session beer, great for the broiler summers of Texas. Hits what its aiming at, Im just never in the mood for a beer after mowing the back 40."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle. Had a nice pale golden color with almost no head or lacing. Had some carbonation. The aroma had a grassy, grainy smell to it typical of the style. The look and smell were average but the taste was really good. I'm a fan of the style in general and have come to really appreciate it on those hot Texas summer days. Goes down smooth and hits the spot on a 100 degree day. During the summer, this is one of my session beers especially when working outside. I really like St. Arnolds beers and for me this is their best. (4, HR, T, Y)"
"Opinion: Well, I was having fun with this beer until I drank it. The metallic flavor really turned me off. I am a big supporter of St Arnolds beers, but I was really disappointed in this one. This is just a water/process problem, so it should be pretty easy to get taken care of. I will see if I can mention it to Brock and see what happens."
"Cheers2Beers"
"Notes: it is what it says it is. Light crisp and refreshing beer. Has that thirst quenching quality, but its a little bland. Would have liked some more hops flavor and hop bitterness would be nice too. Also the head retention needs some work. Overall, I could drink a ton of these. Carbonation is moderately low."
"As for drinkablility, this one is obviously made to satisfy those who like to tip back a few light beers on a hot afternoon."
"Reviewed on January 18th in Houston. Saint Arnold boasts being the oldest micro-brewery in Texas, and they sold me on that slogan and the fact that there was a unique flavor in the Lawn Mower Ale. It seems as a summer ale, however, the flavor doesn't come out that easy. It is a very hard beer to drink and is very hoppy. I really enjoy hoppy beers, however, in beer, you are supposed to judge a book by its cover. If it says it's a summer beer, be a little lighter. Not a good choice. Would recommend another company and flavor."
"Drinkability - Good. This is a very refreshing beer. Tastes great on a 80* November Texas winter day!!"
"money out of the macro's pockets."
"This is the first time I tried this beer, I drank it out of the bottle. This beer is way too expensive though. The smell is grainy, and the taste is somewhat grassy, it's very refreshing and quite thirst quenching. With a name like lawnmower this sure ""hits the spot"" anytime. I'm adding this to my beers choice, an excellent brew it is. Drinkability is easy, mouthfeel is light, appearance actually had some color to it. This beer tastes good period."
"Not my favorite style by any means, but a decent beer at any rate."
"This beer pours a lightly hazy, with some floaties, orangish gold color. It is topped by a frothy, large bubbled pale head that disappears pretty quickly. The aroma is a mix of sweet grain and grassy notes with hints of peach and lemon. The taste has a lightly sweet grain character to it and finishes with a hint of bitterness that just manages to tickle the back of my throat. This beer is really quite light on the palate, quite thirst quenching and simple; with a name like Lawnmower that is probably the point. This is actually a pretty good example of the style; it is lightly fruity (lemon & pear) with a bit of herbal hop notes (some flower nectar type thing going on) and a light bitterness as well as some sweet grain notes. Simple and refreshing."
"Not one of my favorite kolschs but it will definitely work for me. Could be a good cross over beer."
"It's ok, dog."
"Flows down with a moderate ease and effort. It doesn't offer much across the board for full Kolsch character, but it is clean and smooth enough for semi-quick enjoyment on any given day, hot or not. And at 4.9 % is gonna be better then most marco attempts to cooling your jets after a long mornings' mow. Not that I'd know leaving in a building for 15 years, but I use to have to mow 2.5 acres as a youngster, and nothing sucked more then 3 hours of moving, and this stuff would've hit the spot just fine as a finisher as I always needed to hose of the clipping stuck to my body."
"Appearance is light straw colored, head is light and frothy. Aroma is clean, but not very strong. The available aromas are mildly sweet with a hint of wheat. The taste is mild, but balanced. Lightly sweet with some wheatiness. Light, but very crisp on the tongue. Fancy Lawn Mower Beer is a good term for this. This is highly drinkable and light, but still has enough flavor to drink just for the sake of enjoying beer."
"This beer is very drinkable. The hops dominate the beer but it is crisp. I very much enjoy this beer."
"Drinkability - A little gassy, but tastier than the average macro. I think I'd enjoy it more with a barbecue than for after yard work."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a medium gold color with two fingers of head. There is a decent amount of lacing. The smell is very malty, a little bit of hops in there, but lots of standard pale malt. The taste is very malty, a little light, but has a crisp refreshing hops finish. A fairly balanced taste, just need more oomph. The mouthfeel is fairty thick and smooth. The drinkability is very good. A decent lager, fits the name well."
"Cannot really discern much from the smell, but unlike other lagers this beer actually had a disrtinct taste. This beer is quite drinkable and could finish off a six pack after cutting the lawn."
"Still waiting to sample the Summer Pilsner."
"Very easy to drink. Not my favorite of St. Arnold's offerings but none the less, a very good beer that will and probably appeals to many."
"A decent beer from Houston that aspites to be a Kolsch. I was actually surprised with how good it was. This beer wasn't too disappointing but could have been a little better in each category."
"This is a tangy, very dry medium for delivering beer flavor and alcohol to the thirsty consumer."
"The clear, pale gold beer sports a medium-sized, white, noisy head. Faint nuttiness (peanuts even) in the nose. The front is nice and grainsy. Middle sweetens to a pleasant fruitiness. Really, it's almost berry-like. Finish is very nutty with a nice grassy hoppiness. It's a fresh, nutty, light beer."
"The label, which says ""Fancy Lawnmower Beer," sums this beer up completely -- a light, quaffable brew for summer consumption with a little more character than your standard American Pilsner. Very well-rounded."
"Thanks to trbeer for bringing the sample back from TX."
"thanks to morris 729 for helping me to try it out!"
"Crystal clear dark straw hue w/ lively, large champagne sized bubbles. Thin, spotty white head. Sweet, grainy pilsner malt and mildly spicy hops, w/ a hint of cooked sweet corn DMS. Lightly vegetal, but otherwise very tame and clean aromawise. Bready sweetness upfront thins somewhat and becomes sugary mid palate, partially due to the paltry hopping. Mild notes of grain husk emerge late concomitantly with a subdued herbal hop flavor. Lightly bodied, but with token dextrins facilitating an decently crisp mouthfeel. Finishes clean, with residual sweetness briefly lingering. Not a European pilsner and hopefully not intended to be. Lawn Mower is a somewhat superior rendition of the insipid American lager. It succeeds well at its goal of forgettable, innocuous quaffability. Thanks to TXhops for sending the refreshing brew."
"Pours a clear golden straw color with a very thin white head that immediately fades into a thin lace. Nose is fresh grains, dried grass, and is a bit herbal. The taste is just what youd expectlight, crisp, and very refreshing with notes of light, sweet grains and just a touch of hop bitterness. A great brew for a hot summer day and it seems to also be nice on a not-so-hot January evening."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce short brown glass bottle with a twist-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"Pours a clear light golden color with a small white head and also has a lot of bubbling action.  The smell is semi-sweet with a little corn type smell.  Alcohol on the nose fading into an earthy taste with no hop bite at all.  Finishes with a flat sweet musty aftertaste.  Goes down smooth, but not highly attractive unless you're truly hot and sweaty....hence the name.  Not great, but not bad.  Cheers!"
"Pours with a medium sized white head.  Well carbonated.  Clear lemony color.  Sweetish malty smell.  Starts and finishes the same, malty sweet.  Has a touch of saltiness in the finish.  Light body.  Lacks the typical St. Arnold's strawberry undertones, which is a good thing in this beer.  Very refreshing, will be good this summer after (what else?) mowing the lawn."
"A good interpretation of a Kolsch-style beer.  Somewhat light and delicate but still flavorful.  Very, very drinkable.  Hearsay is that the house yeast strain was not used in this beer which, in my opinion, is a good thing.  This is probably my favorite St. Arnold's brew."
