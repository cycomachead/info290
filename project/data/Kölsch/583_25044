The nose comprises sweet bread, mild stonefruit, a hint of sweetgrass, light hard water, and an unfortunate kiss of skunk, which luckily doesn't hold too much sway here.  The taste cuts out the skunk and ramps up the fruit, but beyond that maintains the smell's characteristics.  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly slick feel.  Overall, not a bad American kolsch by any means, but it's not something I'll likely revisit any time soon.","TMoney2591","Jan 28, 2015"

I know, there's no glossy "500 IBU!" sticker on the bottle and no boast of 20 different kinds of hops, grown by elves in the forests of Middle Earth, using only organic growing techniques, but this is a nice brew nonetheless. For those that appreciate the style, I think this is a good choice.","logicalparadox","0"

Aroma of very faint citrus hop, some yeast. Also smells like it would be sweet so that might be some maltness too, but faint. Tastes crisp and light, slight citrus tang and finish; very refreshing! Some hop bitterness but blends very well with the yeast and overall smoothness is excellent. I need to get one of my faves, Reissdorf, to compare.","Murphious","Aug 20, 2014"

In any case, I couldn't find it locally and my wife was in St. Louis where it's made and had one for me by proxy. She raved, I bought the ingredients and when she got home we cooked up a 5-gallon batch. It's still fermenting on it's second week and I can only dream of making such a nice brew.(It's happened before so I'm still dreaming!) We found the beer at the local liquor store and they remembered us from when we asked for it 6-weeks ago and were proud to deal it up from the icebox for us. It would be difficult to compete with this subtle light luxury lawnmower brew. I was going to bring the rest to my father-inlaws this weekend but I may just go buy them their own sixer. No sense in bringing them just three beers. I'll bring them the other, Goose Island Summertime Kölsch and will rate it in a few days. Go try this beer if you can find it.","rixcat","Jun 26, 2013"

Aroma is grainy, biscuity and has a nice touch of noble hops and white grape. Flavor starts with a rush of sweet grains with a following balance of spicy hops and a sweet white wine finish. Mouthfeel is light but sticky, good CO2. I like this Kolsch, it has the ale nose and the lager finish and the vinous quality that is the signature of the style. If the flavor or the nose does not have that white grape note, it isn't a Kolsch.","EagleTalon","May 23, 2013"

Head retention is excellent and lacing is average. The aroma has a nice base of grain and there is some slight citrus notes and suggestions of butternut squash.

It's transparent and lemon yellow in color and pours a thin layer of white head which recedes quickly yet leaves a nice creamy lacing. Also lots of bubbles can be seen rising to the top. Smell is fruity and a bit musty from the yeast. Flavor is sweet upfront with just a touch of citrusy hops. Well balanced and nothing really dominates. Yeasts are detectable in the back and well into the aftertaste. Medium bodied and crisp mouthfeel. Lots of bubbles and a semi-dry finish. It wouldn't be too hard to slam a few of these down in a short period. Not sure how it compares to others within the style but its not too bad!

Mouthfeel is a bit lighter than I'm used to, and maybe a bit watery, but is perfect for warmer weather when you're looking for a good, smooth, refreshing, flavorful beer. Seems slightly under-carbonated to me (I wouldn't go so far as saying it's "flat"), but that doesn't ruin its appeal. Drinkability is very good.

3.16,-13.4,4,3,3,3,3.5,"A nice beer with a light, sweet character, and fairly clean. However, a Kolsch-style beer is more demanding. The beer's attempt to measure up falls a bit short. The color is a medium straw color with brilliant clarity. A somewhat-fizzy carbonation settles into a trace of bleach-white head retention. Aromas of sweet pilsner malts with a rich, earthy note and a moderate grain scent remains clean, but not Kolsch-clean. Tastes sweeter than expected with light vegetal flavors (corn and cereal grains), and moderate pilsner maltiness. Hop flavor is light with a bitterness that struggles to balance the sweetness. Light fruitiness shakes the vegetal flavors late into the finish and takes on pear, apple, and a light cider flavor. The texture is quite round and full for the style, but may sacrifice cleanliness and crispness. A light dryness and a slick texture wraps up the tail-end of the experience. Nice, but may fare better as a Blonde Ale.","BEERchitect","May 25, 2007"

Finish leavs some residual hop notes. Good carbonation.

The medium malt body lends some girth and a slight nuttiness and does well to support the hops. The finish is medium in length and filled with more grassy and crisp hop notes.

Taste is subtle and well balanced, the way a good Kolsch should be. Slightly fruity, but not sweet. A bit lemony, with a mild grassy hops presence that is ideal. Very tasty and highly sessionable.

The foam was thicker and lingered for a minute, so that was my first clue it wasn't Olympia. This is a very refreshing brew. Not abundant on flavor, but very crisp with a hint of fruitiness. I should've let it warm up a bit to bring out more flavor, but it's too damn drinkable to let it sit. The most distiguishing thing about Schlafly Kolsch is its dry finish.

Light and tingly on the palate with the citrus outshining the malt. Goes down really easily.

The hops lack attack and could be emphasized better, but they lend a very clean taste. There is a tangy lingering aftertaste, but the beer was initially served very cold and was at its best at this temperature. As it warmed, it became metallic. Certainly ok all in all, but not fantastic.","Thrasher","0"
