"The best Kolsch I have ever tasted. This is my very favorite beer for hot days and spicy food."

"Awesomely subtle backend fruitiness and well representative of how a Kolsch should be."

"Overall: Another excellent offering from Metropolitan. There simply aren't enough good Kolsch beers out there so I would seek this one out if you are a fan."
""
"OVERALL: A little sweeter than I would have preferred from Metropolitan, but still very nice. I always looks forward to a couple of these when I come back home to Chicago."

"Beer is medium-light in body, with carbonation of medium intensity, leading to a slightly fizzy, then foamy (3/4) and smooth (1/4) mouthfeel that's a bit overcarbonated for both this beer and the style. Closes dry, with light stickiness clinging to the palate and lips."

"D: Extremely drinkable...the definition of a good session beer. This one surprised me in a big way...started out unassuming and finished extremely strong. Thanks to Kris for bringing this one back!"
""
""
""
"Overall- I thoroughly enjoyed the brew, but am a little partial to Kolsches and other wheaty beers and have had quite a few that stack up favorably to this. That being said, this was extremely refreshing and would likely pair with a great range of meals."
""
"Taste- light sweet malt with cherry and banana lightly on the tongue. Wheat actually comes through with a touch of bread. Earthy floral and slight spiciness from the hops as this beer ends semi dry."

"Note: Even in Cologne, some beer gardens serve it in 0.4 glasses because it's such a nuisance to keep bringing out those little ones, but you'll find the flavor just dissipates in those. It's a very delicate beer, and I encourage you to try a taste-test: drink some from a Koelsch-type glass, and some from a normal beer glass, and see if it tastes different."

"A clean malt with German hops and so forth, however lacking in style and taste. Numerous times I've wanted this beer and tasted this beer to no avail. The firm and minute nutty taste that comes from a Kolsch is not here."

"O: Meh, didn't care much for this one."

"Overall Drinkability: A very good American Kölsch."
"There is a skeleton of an ok beer in here, but, as is, this is is disappointing and difficult to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I liked this one. Not many good Kolsch from domestic brewers. This was an enjoyable beer."
""
""
"Overall: Flavor was nothing to write home about. Not much to it."
""
"O - still not at all my style. Ugh. But it's complex and nice, if you're into this style. I hesitate to say ""chick beer."" I'll stick to my pale ales, but I could (very rarely) enjoy one of these in the spring or summer. A nice kolsch."
""
""
"O: Well rounded with a good taste and high drinkability. What more could you ask for at a ball park."
""
""
""
"Overall: Refreshing and flavorful"
""
""
""
""
"O: Nice to taste a good, fresh rendition of a kolsch."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a great beer, and an excellent warm weather beer, very crisp and clean. Perfect examples of this style."
""
""
"Drinks so easy, a very well done & refreshing Kolsch"
"The only small issue I have is that I would prefer a bit more heat on the flavor profile, but not enough to seriously detract from this great brew. The addition of the wheat does a great job increasing smoothness. Easy drinking, smooth, this is a great example of the style."
""
"Overall: This was unlike any Kolsch I've had. That being said, it definitely imprinted itself in my memory and I look forward to purchasing it again soon."
"O: Pretty much excellent in every aspect. I'd maybe suggest adding a more assertive hop note at some point, as the brew was not as bitter as I'd like in a kolsch (35-40 IBU would be amazing, in my opinoin.) This is more of a finishing touch suggestion, though, as everything else is top-notch."
""
""
""
"O - Nice little beer here. Easy to drink, goes well with food, not a bad take on the style. Could drink more than one."

"Have seen this sitting on the shelves forever and never picked it up until today. This beer is a bright crystal clear golden color topped off with a half inch of white fluffy head that recedes to a film an leaves nice lacing. Aroma is grainy and mildly bready, mild grassy earthy herbal hop aroma. The initial pour yields a bit of bread yeast aroma as well. Taste has a bit of makeovers with more breadiness and grainy flavor. Light fruityNess emerges as the beer warms a bit. Mouthfeel is nice and light and refreshing. Good carbonation. Very good beer."

"O - This is a highly drinkable beer- one that I would offer to any Bud/Miller/Coors drinker without hesitation. A great offering by one of the newer and better local breweries in the Chicago area."
"This is an ok Kolsch style lager. Pours clear and light golden color. Nice white head. Bitter, but not overpowering. Very drinkable beer, however I am not a fan of this style. A slight metallic after taste. I know quite a few people who love this beer, so I feel bad not giving it a higher review. That said, in my opinion this is an average beer at best. It's better than coors light, but not by much. I love supporting local breweries so I will continue to try everything that Metropolitan produces, but this is not my favorite."
"Overall: Easy drinking and packed with flavor, especially for such a pale beer."
"Overall, wow this might be the worst Kolsch I have ever had."
"This is a solid beer but without a lot of depth. It's very refreshing, though, and is a good example of the style and a great summer beer."
"Kölsch is quickly become my favorite summer drink. This beer was very light and refreshing. Nice an bready and not too hoppy. Great beer, not much to say. I will definitely get it again, the brewery is so close to me."
"Crank it up Gees!!! Trying the Krankshaft Kolsch...the appearance is ok....very yellow with no head, clear. The smell is mostly grain with some hints of citrus. The taste is powered by grain that is somewhat burnt. There are some hints of citrus, but this beer is really not to my liking. Mouthfeel...its light and somewhat easy drinking. but not one that I would choose unless the alternative was a typical American Adjuct from macro breweries. Worht a try sure....worth a revisit....i dont know."
"O - I would drink this all the time, were it available in my market."
"O -- Overall impression? Another style home run -- not to mention delicious, to Metropolitan. I'm glad I looked past the price tag on these beers to find that they are so spot on for the styles - and so fresh that they will give anyone the true character of German style beers. Don't know what Aasher was drinking, but I'm guessing it may have been the first pour of the day and he should have requested a fresh glass."
"Had on tap at Hay market, a fantastic brew pub in Chicago everyone should visit when given the chance. This beer came out with a thin head and clear gold body but what really grabbed my interest was the smell; very floral and alluring. The taste was amazingly clean and smooth but not wimpy, strong tones of wheat and a zest of lemon followed each swig. Didn't expect much but this is now my go to session beer when found on tap."
"I had this one on tap while in Chicago yesterday. I hadn't heard of it before so I thought I'd give it a try. It was a huge disappointment. It arrived a very pale gold in color with a light white head. It was very clear. It smelled of a skunked dortmunder lager and didn't have much ""kolsch"" to it at all. I was really disappointed. The flavor too, of skunked dortmunder. Bummer! It drank light but I hated it. Luckily the manager came by and asked us how our meal was and brought me a fresh Lagunitas IPA to replace it. Amazing and courteous gesture!"
"Sizable plume of white head tapers to a clinging lace; pale yellow color has a great clarity to it. Smells of fresh- baked shortbread, hint of lemon zest and subtle wildflowers. Deep-planted crispness presents the lighter body in a lush manner. Dry from start to finish, the lightly toasted cracker maltiness holds more flavor than expected. Lemon herbal hoppiness lends more than enough bitterness to get by. Ghostlike sulfur. Clean grainy finish. Obviously someone got their homework right here--this is more proof that smaller brewers can brew extremely flavorful, pale-colored beers. Kudos to Metro!"
"Highly drinkable. I'm impressed by this one."
"The body is crisp and clean. Carbonation level spritzes it up, without fizzing the mouth up. Lots of lemon tartness, mild hop presence, slight earthy quality. This is a splendid ""tame"" beer. Perfect for the warmer months, but just fine any other time. Tasty, refreshing beer. Recommend."
"Conclusion: My overall impression was fairly good. It was clean, nothing that was offensive. Mostly I prefer darker more assertive beers, and I don't typically reach for lagers, but this was good. It was a simple professional tasting kolsh."
"Very drinkable and enjoyable."
"Had this out of a bottle poured into a pint. Poured a light golden yellow, just a touch darker than you see with a BMC type beer. Thin head that disappeared quickly. Not a lot to the aroma, a bit of grass/hay and a tad of sweetness that I couldn't place. Flavor was nice and refreshing. Malty and bready up front, finishes with a hint of honey. Nice and crisp, good carbonation level and goes down easy. Could definitely put a few of these away pretty quickly. It's the dead of winter right now, but this would be a great beer for a hot summer day at the beach."
"Beer is sweet and light in body. There is a strong graininess and an unfortunate aftertaste. It's not the best Kolsch I've had. I doubt i would have it again."
"Pour brings a slightly-dark golden color; it's a bit too dark for the style. White head that lasts for a short while before falling without too much lacing. Very thin collar throughout. Nose is bready and faintly pleasant with a fairly-large amount of fruity notes for the style. The taste is more toward the bready end of the spectrum with a bit of fruit and a very mild bitterness in the finish. Body is light but more toward medium than it should be. Carbonation is a tad bit low. Drinks pretty well overall, but is just good, not great."
"Drinkability: Having more than one is a struggle I'm actually giving away the rest if I can, if I can't I'm just going to dump the beer and save the bottles for my homebrewing. This is one of the worst local brews I've had. I haven't gotten the chance to try any other metropolitan beers. I hope metropolitan can put out a better product than this."
"The mouthfeel is light bodied with adequate carbonation, which does hide out before exploding along my tongue. There is a watery aftertaste that just falls short of being full-flavored. The drinkability, however, is high due to the pleasant mix of flavors and lack of any noticeable alcohol. I would happily enjoy this beer again. It's not up there with the excellent COAST Kölsch, but it's still quite nice."
"Nicely drinkable. Overall, this is a very good example of the style, though I'd like to see it just a wee bit drier. Falls just short of the best German examples, which is fairly high praise."
"It's a very delicate beer, really, as it should be, and the mouthfeel is very prickly and drying, almost too drying. It's a solid effort, I just don't think it's quite as flavorful as your best German Kölsches."
"Nice. Just a well made Kölsch here. Well balanced, flavorful, and extremely easy drinking, I'm glad that I picked up a full sixer of these when I was last out in Chicago. Metro hasn't let me down yet!"
"Good taste, light body, and an near perfect mouthfeel. You could drink this all night long."
"Overall another well made german beer from Metropolitan. Super refreshing and delicious. This brewery and I are getting along well."
"This was my first beer from Metropolitan, and I must say that I am impressed!"
"I have to say I, like most, am a fan of bigger, bolder styles, flavors, etc. However, I haven't lost my love for softer, more subtle styles and their intricacies. That said, I've had a few Kolsches before, but I also have some experience with what's intended of the style and what it should be. I've seen how homebrewers are supposed to make it, style guidelines, that sort of thing. I think that this brewery I'd never heard of before this beer came in my box may have made the best Kolsch to style that I've witnessed."
"D - A little less sweetness and this would make for a great summer refreshing beer. Still good regardless, it went down very nicely."
"D: solid example of the style."
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pilsener glass. Medium head quickly subsides, leaving a thin layer of foam. Minimal lacing present. Nice aroma featuring grainy notes, and subtle bitterness underneath. Very clean and crisp taste, with graininess and notes of hay in the forefront, which really come out in the aftertaste. A slightly ""grapey"" sourness lurks in the background. The mouthfeel features a pleasant bite of carbonation, though it does seem a bit thin. I admit I'm not very familiar with this style, but this beer would probably be best enjoyed in the warmer weather."
"Great kolsch flavor, really nice for the style. Crisp mouthfeel. Light, malty, a little bit of hops. Super drinkable."
"I can't say that I've had all that many different examples of this style, but this is a good beer, refreshing and summery. It pours a somewhat hazy pale yellow, somewhere between maize and madder yellow. Head is sudsy, relatively small and white. The aroma is pale malt-sweet with a mild vinous character. I'd prefer a bit more grape, but it's a minor complaint. A tiny bit of butterscotch sneaks in as it warms. Flavor is fairly sweet, but there's a nice grassy noble hop bite in the finish. This is a refreshing beer that doesn't try to overwhelm you with flavor. Good for a hot day. Mouthfeel is appropriately light and a touch slick. Good beer though I'm still not entirely won over to the style."
" D- This beer is very drinkable with a full malt flavor for a Kolsch. The sweetness is a bit strong to drink to many in a row."
"D - This actually has the drinkability that the macro lagers all claim to have. Easy to gulp."
"D-Wow, this is the first kolsch to really get my attention. Really solid, flavorful beer that happens to be lighter bodied and insanely drinkable."
"If you can get it, do it. It's great on tap as well."
"The beer is very easy to drink, but its like drinking a glass of water, why would you want to drink it?"
"Light carbonation, light and somewhat creamy body. Very drinkable, I could go through a lot of these quickly. A new favorite for me in Chicago. I foresee many of these in my belly in the future."
"F: Semi dry and a hint of bitterness. Light lingering malt and Kolsch flavors. Would be a pretty goo light summer drink, but I've had better Kolsch beers."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, it's a beer that you can pound down but there are better ones in the style that I would pick first."
"D= Extremely drinkable and tasty too. Would make an ideal session beer. Easily my favorite Metropolitan beer to date."
"A great example of an American made kölsch. I usually like this style in the summer, but it's still hitting the spot on this cold night. I'll have no problem finishing the other four bottles."
"It's highly fizzed, maybe a bit too much carbonation. Heavier than expected. A great drinker and a sessionable beer. This is my second six pack and one to keep around year round if you live in Chicagoland, yeah!"
"Very drinkable, matching well on its own in summer or fall with lighter foods."
"So extremely drinkable. Another winner from Metropolitan."
"Metro date stamps their six packs (3 months out), so there's really no reason to drink or review old bottles... get it fresh! Looks like there are plenty of reviews that have no concept of what a Kölsch is, kind of sad really."
"Krankshaft poured a super pale slightly cloudy yellow, with a large white fluffy head. The smell was of yeast, and a lemony citrus hint. Taste was crisp citrusy flavor. Very refreshing even if a bit light. Mouthfeel was right for the style. Drinkability was good as well. This was a nice beer from a promising new brewery. I will keep my eye for this one again."
"Surprisingly full bodied for the style and considering how pale it is. Crisp spiciness up front with a nice bit of floral hops followed by a yeasty bready body with hints of pilsner malt and light crisp fruit notes, mostly apple and banana. Also, there is a bit of earthy grass and straw presence that compliment the sweetness of the light fruit and malts as well as the slightly earthy hops. Very easy drinking and flavorful. Recommended."
"drinkability is good. for a kölsch, this is a good, fresh example with a solid character and drinakble aura. cheers!"
"D: I'd say this beer lives up to the ratings here. Goes down incredibly smooth while still offering up a lot of complexity to ruminate on, if ruminating is your thing. This beer is not just one things, that is, one main aroma, one main flavor, etc. each sip you can pick up something you may have missed before. A superb effort from another great local brewery."
"D: The beer has really good but subtle flavor and is light and smooth as it goes down the hatch. A great session beer! Strongly recommended for anyone that likes the style and something I'd try even if not a fan of this type of beer."
"D- Coming out in the fall when all I want is big hops and looking forward to stouts and barleywines and yet this is so refreshing. I could drink so many of these. This is a huge contender to my summer favorite Gumballhead. Really well done, Metro. I'm a fan again."
"D - I wouldn't call this beer complex. But if you're going to make a simple beer, you can't make any mistakes, and Krankshaft doesn't have any major flaws. Enjoyable from start to finish, and probably through several more bottles. I can't recommend this beer highly enough."
"Smooth and easy drinking, yet flavorful and satisfying. This is well done."
