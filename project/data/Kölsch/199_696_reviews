"Looks more yellow in color than a pale ale, Smells a little skunky, tastes between a Heineken and fat tire, feels too lite with little alcohol on it, crisp and dry..."
""
""
"Light yet flavorful with a host of yeast derived notes cascading onto the palate. My only knocks are the texture is a bit thin and the flavors seem to clash at times but besides that it does its job."
""
"One of my favorite beers of all time. It goes great with pasta. Always relaxes me after a long day at work."
""
"Overall a disappointment. Calling this a pale ale is misleading. Yes it's an ale that is pale but it is not what one expects when ordering a pale ale."
"Easy drinker. Flavorful and mellow."

"Smells like a lager and tastes like a lager, but bitter and crisp"

"I didn't look at the label too closely before trying this one so I was expecting more of an American Pale Ale. That considered my first reaction was disappointment - the flavors seemed dulled and there was not the freshness that I expect from an APA. When I saw the Kolsch ""subheading"" it made a lot more sense. A good enjoyable brew, but not one that I expect to repurchase."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 5/30/2014. Pours slightly hazy/cloudy golden color with a 2 finger dense and rocky white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon, pear, apple, wheat, cracker, bread, herbal, straw, grass, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance of pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon, pear, apple, wheat, cracker, bread, herbal, straw, grass, and yeast earthiness. Light earthy herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, pear, apple, wheat, cracker, bread, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice robustness and balance of pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. A fairly clean finish as well with no overly estery yeast notes present. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, fairly crisp, and lightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with no warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice kolsch style. All around good balance and robustness of pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"This was a very disappointing beer. It has all the drawbacks of a light American beer, but lacking the crispness and carrying a higher price.  Avoid this if you are looking for a pale ale.  It is most similar to Kona Longboard or Olympia. Too much malty sweetness for my taste, without much complexity to balance it out.  The lingering aftertaste is better than some of the other beers mentioned, with some  hints of citrus fruit.  This is my second go around with Yellowtail, figuring the last batch I had was a dud, but I am just as underwhelmed."

"Very earthy taste to this pale ale.  Reminds me of a Sierra Nevada.  A bit sweet on the tongue with just enough bite to make it above average in this category.  The beer has a golden orange hue, minimal foam, lace and carbonation and a crisp, clean taste.  Leaves the right amount of taste on the tongue and is not harsh like some other IPAs tend to be.  A very worthy effort.  Ballast Point is quickly becoming one of the best breweries on the west coast, but this is not their finest beer, even though I would rate as above average.  I love this brewery and cannot wait to try their new beers!"

"Overall, not bad. Although, having recently sampled PBR (pabst) in a can, no less, I actually find PBR to have more character - from aroma, character, lingering taste appeal - I think the PBR revival has something going - including an attractive price point. a 24 pack at $13 goes much further than 22 oz. at $5. i'll stick with sculpin if I'm looking for real character."

"As a pale ale as the label states on its label its not. But, as a Kolsch its not bad. I have had beers I liked better. It states that its fermented at ale levels but its more of a Kolsch. I read that others felt misled, but its on the label. As for most breweries who do fantastic hoppy beers this one falls short. More malt than anything else detected. Its crisp, but it also has the funk or whatever you call it that is typical of Kolsch beers. For the price I can get just as good Kolsch beers that are actually true Kolsch, so for me its a one and done, but I still love Ballast Point's hoppy IPA's. Sculpin is just about perfect and among my all time favorite beers."

"I was also disappointed as many others here that the packaging does not represent the correct product. This is a great session beer or if youre eating a big meal but other than that there is no reason for me to buy this again. Very little to no hops. :("
""
"I'm generally fair in my reviews. I'm also not generally lied to about what style of beer I'm purchasing. Putting ""Pale Ale"" in big print and ""Kolsh"" in tiny print is misleading. So as far as a pale ale goes this beer is terrible. I'm rating it as a pale ale because it says that's what it is on the bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
"That said, upfront, the beer is mis-labeled. When I think of a ""Pale Ale"" I tend to think of an ""IPA Light""... but, as the words on the can warn, this is more of a kolsch style beer. That said, for the style, its damn good. A very refreshing and crushable beer... a great choice to enjoy after a long run or on a Sunday afternoon bbq. Tastes like a very well done Budweiser... which is a complement in my book."

"While I would normally select a IPA for one or two beers with a meal, when I order a pitcher of half priced brew, I normally select Yellowtail. This smooth, low carbonated product is a great pick for watching 2-3 hours of sports in a bar. (Go Blackhawks!)"

"Overall this beer is very good. It's what got Ballast Point going. And I'm glad they stepped up their game in just about everything else they've done. It's an above average beer for sure, just not anything that blew my socks off. This would be excellent with seafood like mild whitefish, shrimp, or crab. I'd say try this if you are new to the craft beer scene or if you just want something that is light and extremely flavorful. You won't be disappointed."

"I was expecting an American Pale Ale but this is actually a Kolsch with a distant APA background. Still faithful to style and well crafted."

"Ballast Point Pale Ale ---3.5/5"
""
""
""
"ballast point is now my favorite san diego brewery - better than stone, even"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Compare this to Blue Heron (Mendocino), Mirror Pond (deschutes) ...but still so unique and great malt but balanced. Actually probably not appropriate to try to compare ."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A pretty decent take on the German Kolsch style. Has the crisp breadyness you expect."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"On tap at Toscana Cafe. Pours clear golden with nearly no head. Aroma is light fruits like pears and white grapes, sweet pale malts, light grass and yeast. Flavor follows with some light hay, honey, sweet wheaty flavors, yeast lingering on the palate. Light bodied with medium high carbonation. Not great but plenty drinkable I guess."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A bit to much on the sour taste for a pale ale for me, not really what I think of when I grab a pale ale."
""
""
""
"With a name like Yellow Tail Pale Ale, I was expecting a pale ale, not a pale yellow adjunct but that is exactly what this portrays. The body, the scent and even the taste is all adjunct despite the claim it's a Kolsch. I smell corn, I taste corn and the pale yellow body screams adjunct. As I finish it there's the metallic aftertaste that seems to always accompany an adjunct. Ballast Point is such a great brewery but this is easily their worst effort."
"Pours a clear golden, with a big creamy white head. Smells of mild grain. Taste starts with some initial light caramel sweetness, then some grain husk, finishing with a flowery, earthy hop finish. Mouthfeel is medium. Carbonation is a bit high, but not too bad. Overall a good beer."
"Light, crisp, and refreshing, yet still not one of my favorite Kolsch's."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A good take on the kolsch style. Nothing spectacular, but a solid brew that I could drink multiples of."
""
""

"Meager yellowish ale pours smoothly kicking up a white foam cap. Sticky and leaves substantial lacing. Sweetish, bready, lemony and yeasty odor. Tastes of crackers, lightly sour- lemons, and yeasty. Mildly sweet. A bit of wet earth. Body is light. Definitely has kolsch elements, it's just not my style of pale ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"If it's a Kolsch why not call it one instead of a pale ale. I expected a lot more from this in the way of hops but now reading what it is I understand. I'm still pissed though as I wanted a true APA from BP...As a Kolsch it is decent enough...some malt sweetness....relatively clean...some bready/cereal notes....light fruitiness (apples/pears)...decent for the style but still pissed this is not an APA..I'll rate for style though"
""
"The beer is clear and ligh golden with a small white head. The aroma brings grain, earth, hops, malt. Some sweet corn character in the flavor. A balance of malt and hops with some wet earth character. Dank hops and lingering bitterness. This is neither a good kÃ¶lsch nor pale ale. It certainly lacks the attributes of either style. Too sweet. One beer was more than enough. Not again."
"O - yea it sucks, closer to Rolling Rock than it is to Dale's Pale Ale or any of the other greats."

"O: Refreshing and thirst-quenching, but not what I expected from a beer labeled âpale ale.â I had heard it was more of a kÃ¶lsch styled brew before I drank it, but my eyes read âpale ale,â and I wanted a pale ale when I cracked it open. (Strangely, I think I would have enjoyed it more if it had been labeled âkÃ¶lsch.â)"

"Thanks to the creator of the canquest, woodychandler, for this beer. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a light golden color with a 1 inch head. Smell is mild, some malts are present. Taste is crisp, malts, a touch of hops, a bit of wheat, pretty refreshing. Feels light in the mouth and overall is a pretty good summertime beer."

"O- The clean beer has lots of qualities of an American adjunct lager with lots of field corn qualities and Noble hop hints. It was a bit of a let down."
""
""
""
"I like it. Its not loud, itâs not really fruity. It has a small pucker from the sweet apple and thatâs where it gets itâs sweetness. The malt sweetness is understated and behind that. A good kolsch reminds you that malt is sweet in and of itself without caramel, toffee or sugar . The malt stayed dry and breaddy . Very impressive."
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavors and aromas."

"Well, until I started typing this I had no idea this was considered a kolsch. I mean, why would they call it a pale ale if it was another style altogether? It does explain things, though... It pours a clear brass topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises sweet biscuit, flowers, and a hint of candied orange peel in the background. The taste brings in more of the same, but with more of the orange peel and some mild grass for good measure. Overall, a decent little kolsch, and a sad excuse for a pale ale, depending on how you wanna look at it."

"Pours to a nice but thinnish white head with minimal lacing and pale gold color. Aroma is sweet grainy pale malt and grassy, floral hops. Flavor starts slightly sweet with a dry wine and noble hops finish to balance it out. Mouthfeel is a bit rough for the style. Overall a great beer that is pale and an ale but is nothing like a ""pale ale"". I ordered it not knowing it was a kolsch. But I was pleasantly surprised."

"Taste follows... some fruit, maybe apple and lemon, just a touch of flowery hops. Uber smooth with a medium carbonation...super easy to drink. Almost downed this one in a matter of minutes. Very light, crisp and refreshing...just not a ton of personality... a very good session beer or warm weather beer however."
""
""
"Note this gets a 2.61 as a kolsch; if I reviewed it as an APA, the score would be even lower."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, our favorite thing about this beer was its crisp freshness and robust flavoring for the style. Many beers in the style go too far with the drying flour bite and the adjuncts, with big puckering grassiness, and further drying elements of straw. While this guy teeters on the edge, it doesnât go overboard in these aspects, making for a decently drinking, crisp beverage."
" Taste is of bready malts. Hops comes through in the finish. A nice brew."
""
""
""
"O: A note to brewers: label your beers with the correct style. When I drank this, I was expecting an APA (the label does say ""Pale Ale," after all) and was disappointed. On my notes regarding the taste, I wrote: ""British style?"" - because it didn't seem to have enough hops for an APA. Then in my notes for the ""overall"" category, I wrote, ""Not what I'm looking for in an APA."" I've modified my scores knowing, in hindsight, that this is a Kolsch and not an APA (originally I gave it closer to a 3.25). But at the time I drank this, I thought it wasn't a good APA at all, and my initial scores reflected that. I may have felt better about this beer had I known when drinking it that it wasn't an APA and was instead a Kolsch."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A pleasant surprise. Iâd be disappointed if this was a true pale ale as the hops are too mellow and the wheat and grains are too prominent. However, if youâre looking for a very flavorful light beer give this one a try."
"O- Flagship beer? Unfortunate. The smell especially really put me off. Not terrible, but not something I'm rushing back towards."
""
"O: Certainly not terrible but not all that great for the style. I downgraded them for not calling it what it is -- come on BP, in hops country, do it right."
""
""
"O: The taste was mild and a bit of a let down. Average overall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-well if you get this because you want a good fresh American Pale Ale, then you'll find that you were fooled by the name. it definitely does taste very much like a kolsch. its definitely tasty for what it is. it goes down easy, but its really missing any quality that begs me to go out and buy more."
""
"O: This is a very good representation of a Kolsch. It should have broad appeal, owing to the care with which it was crafted and the nature of the style itself. I find it curious, however, that Ballast Point chose to call it a Pale Ale on the label. That's bound to cause confusion when someone purchases it expecting a hoppy American Pale Ale or something of that ilk."
""
""
"Overall a semi-interesting beer from a great brewery. Not for hoppers, but worth the try. I consumed this indoors in the late evening, and I can see my overall score bumping this up by a .5 if I ever try this in the summer heat such as after yard work."
""
""
""
"O - Eh, nothing too spectacular here. Might as well be drinking Sierra Nevada (which I like)."

"O - Decent brew. I haven't had that many Kolsch style beers, but this example makes me want to seek more like it. Great balance and flavor, easy to drink."
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Nice appearance including a really strong head, and some persistent lacing. Nose is simple, but comes across as fresh...light planty malt. Light and crisp combo of light malt tones accentuated with a little sweetness and some bitterness. Overall, this is a good quaff."

"Was very excited to finally try my first beer from Ballast Point. Poured into a Pilsener glass and noticed a light body, though a bit darker than an American version, most likely due to German malts. Definite fruitiness to the tone- not sure if I can pinpoint which fruit exactly but grape seems as close as any. Very crisp, breezy, and fresh upon taste- I'd call this a beach beer! Bring a cooler, watch the waves crash in and enjoy!"
""
""
""
"O: Yeah, it's a pretty good Kolsch. I just can't seem to get into this style like I used to. Ah, well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very nice and flavorful brew with crisp and clean flavors. Def a nice beer to enjoy on a spring/summer weekend with friends. I'd def get a case of this for a gathering of friends."
""
""
"Not bad at all! Definitely keep in mind that this is a light brew, great if you're not looking to get overwhelmed with hops but still want decent flavors."
""
"Some sweetness, faint traces of malt, even fainter, if any hops. Very grainy, light-bodied. Usual high carbonation. Pretty bland and lifeless brew."
"A decent pale ale, a bit of necessary moderation at the moment - for the rest of you - drink at will."
""
""
"Overall - Although very drinkable and refreshing, this beer is quite boring. I expected a little bit more from this brewer. Maybe just a touch more in the citrus/hop department."
""
""
"O - An excellent, tasty, easy drinking light beer. Perfect for a hot summer day.."
"This beer has exceeded my expectations, a flavorful representation of style that could easily be over looked. Will return to this one, a crowd pleaser that does justice to both a craft drinker's palate as well as the masses."
""
""
"Overall - A decent beer here. Not incredibly remarkable or anything, but a good representation of the style."
"Another good one from Ballast Point."
""
"Great drinkability (aside from some of that carbonation, haha). This is one for the IPA light category. Give it a shot."
"O - good beer, but nothign special"
""
" Style listed as Kolsch but ""pale ale"" presented on the label. A bit confusing as I reviewed with a pale ale in mind. In either case a decent brew."
"Pours a hazy, pale golden color with a thick white head. Some loose lacing with the attenuation of the head. Earthy, pilsner-like aroma with little hop noted. Mild apricot flavor, but finishes like a chalky pilsner. Very poor example of the style, but not a horrible beer. That being said, I won't buy it again. I also don't understand the hubbub of the Sculpin IPA and how it manages to stay in the top 100 on BA's list. I've tasted better homebrew efforts."
""
""
"On tap at the Common Table in Dallas. The beer pours a cloudy orange color with a white head. The aroma is heavy on the toffee with some orange citrus and some light grass notes. The flavor follow suit. I get a lot of toffee and caramel malt as well as some citrus and pine notes from the hops. The malt is much more prevalent than the hops, but there is still a light bit of bitterness and some hop flavor. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
""
""
""
""
"O- I really enjoyed drinking this, it isn't the strongest offering from Ballast Point, but for what it is, a very simple, easy-drinking beer, it's not bad at all, I would definitely buy this again next time I want a nice summer beer."
""
""
"I'm sure lots of people pick this up looking for an APA and are disappointed. I picked this up looking for a good Kolsch, I hope it doesn't let me down. It looks good, it's got the golden body, high carbonation, and white head that are indicative of the style. The aroma is nice and crisp, with bready malts, zesty hops, and some light citrus aspects. The taste is also fantastic, it's a nearly perfect Kolsch style. It's got nice crisp, noble hoppy sort of taste at first, that seamlessly crosses over to a wheat and bread finish. The mouthfeel is great, it's perfectly crisp. The drinkability is very good. It's a great Kolsch. A really great Kolsch. No idea why it took me so long to give this a try ... maybe finally figuring out how to read Ballast Point's date codes so I could get a fresh bottle was the kick I needed."
""
""
""
""
"O: I really do enjoy the malt depth in this beer. It juggles rich breadiness and crisp flavors nicely. However in some ways it does fall a bit flat. Still a little above average though."
""
""
""
""
"A decent kolsch overall, just fairly bland. I would consider it a good lawnmower beer, it was pretty refreshing."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Easy drinking but somewhat bland, even for a kolsch, which is for me not the most exciting style to begin with. Lacking any particularly distinctive characteristics."

"Dr: They got the style wrong, but its a pleasant simple beer, with muted flavour. It's too restrained to be truly good, but if you're not expecting much, it's a highly drinkable beer. It's certainly sessionable. I'd try it on draught on a rainy day, but it won't be coming up in conversation anytime soon. Nice try, lads, but you didn't do anything interesting."

"0 - different. Kolsch is not my style, but this was actually pretty good.."
" D: Very light and refreshing with a big European influence. German hops and malts give more of a Kolsch character than an American Pale Ale to me. Not bad and nice balanced but just not really what I go for these days. Again your go to for a BMC gateway brew I would think."
"Pours a clear yellow-gold color with a 1 inch white head that settles to a thin film. Broken rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is good but basic with malt and floral hop aromas. Taste is of sweet malt and some floral and herbal hop flavors. Mild bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a good carbonation level with a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a solid beer from Ballast Point. Nothing too special but nice and easy to drink for what it is."
"This brew poured out as a nice looking golden color, kind of hazy. The head was a little fizzy but ended up sticking around for a little while. The smell of the beer was pretty nice, giving off some decent hop aromas and malts. The taste of the beer has a nice crisp bitterness that faded into a sweetness as is settled on the tongue. The mouthfeel was crisp and sharp, nicely done. Overall I pretty Solid pale ale."
"O - Overall a great session brew from BP. Calico wasn't half bad, but Big Eye IPA is their best session brew. Its got tons of malt and hops without being overpowered and makes for a great introduction beer. Check out everything BP has to offer, you won't be disappointed. Cheers!"
"This pours slightly cloudy golden with one finger of head. This beer is quite honestly, disappointing. It tastes like a tolerable golden lager at best. Although the beer is still âcraftyâ in its quality, the flavor is heavy on the bitter malt side of things. It kind of reminds me of a Dortmunder from Great Lakesâ¦only thinner and not as good. Admittedly, I was expecting an APA, and didnât realize that this was actually a Kolsch midway through my experience; I still didnât love this beer."
"Crisp and slightly hoppy. Such a nice clean taste. Very light body. Pale golden color in the mug, nice lacing. Like a lager with a rich tangy flavor. Flowery nose. Malty, yet delicate. Best KÃ¶lsch I've tried in a long time, not knowing what the heck it was. Score one for the local lads, but it really is a highly decent drinkable light beer and well worth a try."
"A pretty big disappointment, considering how much I enjoy the Calico Ale."
"O - a highly drinkable and refreshing beer that makes an excellent substitute for a light beer ... not that you'd want one of those. Plenty flavorful for the kolsch, but not the PA style."
"O: This is not necessarily a bad beer, but definitely an unmemorable one. A good summer beer if you don't care what you're drinking."
"I think Ballast Point do themselves a disservice by calling this a pale ale. This is a simple, bready ale, but there's a lot more flavor and character in Sierra Nevada and Stone Pale Ales."
"Overall, a clean, decent, not earth shattering Kolsch that would be a decent go-to beer on a sunny, mild to warm day."
"T: Lots of honey malts with a grassy hop backbone. A slight breadiness towards the finish. A solid and very very drinkable pale ale."
"O: a fine kolsch, but as has probably been said 1000 times, why call it a pale ale? I forgot this was a kolsch and got it wanting an apa."
"o: not a bad beer, but nothing is shining through. I don't need to try this again after having once. Would not seek out. it is middle of the road, as average as you can get."
"O- A decent Kolsch, but below average as a pale ale, which is how they labeled it and how I will grade it. Below average drinkability."
"There's not one beer style that Ballast Point does badly. In fact, I have yet to rate even one of their beers as 'just alright'; all of their brands are exceptional examples of their respective styles and Yellowtail is certainly no exception. I don't think any other brewery makes as many of my #1 favourites when it comes to examples of different styles."
"Have one!"
"Overall: The refreshing aspect is a huge plus but this just isn't the pale ale for me. I love Ballast Point but this is just not for me."
"very drinkable in deed."
"O - I can't really change my review to reflect the fact that this is a kolsch. At the time, I reviewed it as a pale ale and it didn't meet my expectations. They should change the name of this beer."
"Overall a real unique and nice nose, but taste doesn't deliver as much. This is not bad but I think I'd grab a different Kolsch if I could."
"Overall it's not a bad summer beer but it's not overly impressive either."
"The CPJ"
"Picked up a bottle of this one at the Ballast Point Brewery/Home Brew Mart in San Diego. More along the lines of a kolsch, rather than a pale ale. Poured a clear yellow color with a good white head. Very mild on the nose, a little biscuit and a kiss of hops. On the palate, this one is light bodied and easy to drink, yet not very interesting in the least. Flavors of light malt and a bit of hops."
"D/O: Possibly one of the most poorly-marketed beers currently bottled, this ""pale ale"" offers an experience that is nothing like all other similarly-labeled beers. If Ballast Point needed a synonym for kolsch, it seems like blond ale would have been a more apt selection. Compared to other kolsches, this beer is full-flavored but a little unrefined, coming across as heavy-handed. Early fruitiness has a definite inauthentic resonance to it, leaving behind a sense of artificial flavor. Hoppy bitterness in the finish is bold for the style, although one would never mistake this for IPA-level bitterness in quantity or quality. However, it is effortless to drink, serving as a superior form of refreshment and really holding up well when served too cold."
"This brew pours a see through golden straw hue with decent carbonation that leaves behind a two finger head and lacing everywhere,the smell is very similar to a pilsner with hints of german noble grassy hops and honeysuckle,it has a light bodied well carbonated mouthfeel and has tastes of grassy german noble hops,light jarrah honey,pale malts and finished with a slight herbal hoppy bitterness that is almost reminiscent of a fine German pilsner and not a Kolsch and overall a dissapointment in my mind and could think of other drops from this brewery that id rather revisit than this cheers."
"D- Nice carbonation, light and refreshing. Very easy drinking. This is a nice pale ale, but it is still a pale ale."
"Overall, I enjoyed it, but it doesn't really seem like anything particularly special, either."
"I understand the name confusion now â Yellowtail sits in an odd realm between KÃ¶lsch and pale ale, hoppy and bready yet crisp and light. Itâs definitely not the most traditional example of the style, but itâs the only one that kept me coming back."
"This is a well made beer, it's just a style that isn't known for a whole lot of character. I would say it's a nice representation of the style with a little west coast hop flair. It's just not a style that does a whole lot for me, so I wouldn't need this one again. Like I said though, it's still well made. Blame it on the style."
"Why this is called a ""pale ale"" I haven't a clue. If you're making craft brews, beer snobs are your audience. Tell us it's a KÃ¶lsch! Drinks easy and has a surprising complexity of flavor without all the bitterness. Definitely fills a niche."
"Poured on-tap at the brewery, the beer was served in a pint glass. The beer was semi-hazy, bright, and a vibrant yellow-gold with a ring of filmy head. Mellow nose, with very slight hops characteristics. Watery flavors initially, but heavy toasted flavors on the tail end, with only a hint of hops. Slightly pale/hoppy and sour aftertaste, with a musty, lingering finish. Overall, it was a bit watery throughout."
"You get some wheat or corn taste in the mouth. Too bad the taste is also a bit watery."
"O - Good beer. Delicious and easy to drink with a lower ABV."
"Not a very complex beer but refreshing. Ive had it a few times but only when its my last choice. The other Ballast Point offerings are much better."
"O: This is a good session beer; the type you can drink a six pack of in a night, and with the somewhat low alcohol content, I think I'll keep this in mind in the future."
"Cheers!"
"Average beer overall. Some off flavors were present, but I think it would probably be better fresh. Lots of variety at Total Wine, but hard to keep up on dates."
"Decent mouthfeel but not great. Light but not crisp. Not one I'm going to ever have again."
"M - crisp and refreshing. A great summer beer, in my opinion. I think this beer resembles more of a pilsner than anything else."
"Overall: An enjoyable Kolsch that I have seriously neglected. I will definitely enjoy more of this when the weather warms up."
"D - Would have been decent if it wasn't so highly carbonated. The amount of carbonation was so much that it dulls the tongue and prevent you from drinking a large amount at once."
"Light body. I was satisfied splitting a 22oz bottle with a friend."
"So, take this review for what its worth. I would definitely like to try more beers of this style because it wasn't bad."
"This beer is decently drinkable, but the carbonation is just a bit too high for my taste and holds it back. Body is very nice and light though, considering the more-than-expected malt character in this guy."
"Well done, but boring. Golden color, clear, decent head retention. Grainy aroma, what you'd expect from the style. A bit of carbonation up front, but not too much. Slight bitterness in the middle, clean finish. Better balance than most of the Kolschs I've had and not quite as grainy. Medium to medium light body. It would make an excellect everyday summer drink, not special, but very drinkable."
"Drinkability: Very refreshing and enjoyable Kolsch. Not quite as dry or spicy as I prefer, and too much wheat."
"This is very drinkable and a solid session beer."
"This beer pours a clear, gold with 1/2 inch head that quickly fades. It does leave lace till the end. The aroma leads off with caramel followed by some banana and vanilla. It's flavor has notes of caramel, grapes, and a hoppy tang. Well balanced at first with a dry hop finish. The mouthfeel is medium however the dry hop tang lends itself to only drinking one at a time. Ballast Point Yellowtail Pale Ale is a good example of the style, recommended."
"A good beer on a hot summer's day maybe a little light for anything else."
"D- Good drinkability. I could see my non-crafty type beer folk really liking this too."
"D - Well apparently this company is notorious for not having dates on their beer along with getting this from a shop I knew had old beer was a lose/lose situation. It's weird since it's really not drain pour worthy yet not really exciting and full of flavor so I will pour it. Sad since even hella old the IPA still rocked my taste buds this beer is so/so at best new or old. Every beer is not a winner."
"Oh, I did drainpour about a third of this thing. Good riddance."
"This beer is very misleading because I tried this on draft and did not know that this was a kolsch, but rather thought it was a APA like I would expect from Ballast Point that makes Big Eye and Sculpin. It's false advertising and you definitely do not get what you are expecting. There are some tell tale signs. The color is a golden pale clear color with finely knit white foam and lace. The flavor is very malty with a distinct grain tannin and sulphurs from the yeast. The finish is very dry and clean with little fruit flavor."
"First things first the label is misleading, this should be labeled a Kolsch or a golden ale. When you see Yellowtail Pale Ale from San Diego, my Pavlov's dog in me starts to salivate. When I get home and pour a pale golden crystal clear beer with a bright white head forming thick, it's definitely not what I was expecting. Aroma has sweet biscuit malts slight honey sweetness with some herbal hops lingering a nice cereal grain presence with a mild metallic mineral water accent and hints of grassy/citric hops in the backend. Flavor is grainy light toasted malts bringing biscuit to minds with a touch of citrus/fruit esters very mild hops in the finish. Not even great German style brewing going on just pretty much a dissapointment as a whole. Mouthfeel light bodied easy going, easy drinking, care free crossover style golden ale. Drinkability, okay but I'm shocked at how light on flavor and color their labeled ""pale ale"" is. Crappy pale ale, okay kolsch."
"D- Crisp and refreshing but not much going on. A summer time beer for sure. Nothing bad but nothing to seek out."
"D - This doesn't taste like a pale ale to me so the surprising flavor set me back a bit. The bottle is labeled as a pale ale but I'm not buying it. If you're into the sour taste and this style, it definitely can quench your thirst."
"D - Easy drinker for the not so brave, easy entry lever craft beer. I like more of an IPA true bitter beer or double stout, So this tastes like a light beer to me. Over all pretty balanced and good."
"I'll stick to Sculpin, thanks."
"Overall this is very easy to drink, but with other options, why fill up on this? This is a decently enjoyable beer, but the weakest Ballast Point offering which I've tried to date by far. It doesn't offend, but it doesn't wow in the slighest."
"It's a solid beer but not very unique. I'm still pretty happy with Ballast Point so far (3rd offering I've had)."
"Another quality beer from Ballast Point - what else would anyone expect at this point?"
"D-The kolsch style is pretty friendly in general, and this beer is no exception. However, it isn't one of the more successful American micro versions of the style."
"Pours a light gold in color. A pale ale or a Kolsch? Make up your mind Ballast Point! This brew leans more to the kolsch side, making it a good summer option. Light floral hops, no real bite. Crystal and pale malts. Tinge of lemon. Fairly bitter, and very clean at that. Easy to drink but just a run of the mill kolsch style beer."
"D: Typical of BP brewing, they have brewed a tasty, unique ale. Maybe a little too unique to add into my regular rotation. Also not my first choice to give to a friend trying to enter into the hoppy world because of these unique qualities."
"Drinkability- Very easy drinking, but nothing to write home about."
"D: The other strong point is definitely the drinkability. Nothing exciting here, but it's pretty well balanced and very sessionable. Wouldn't turn my back on this, but wouldn't seek it out either."
"Crests at about two fingers of cream white foam, loosely knit and swiftly to dissolve, does cover the surface well before finally gone, the lacing is slight and not that sticky. As yellow as pale orange in color, while lacking depth it holds enough light inside to create a moderate visual presence, close to zero bubbles to be seen. Biscuity, bready nose with orange peel and mineral water nuances, a touch of blanched almonds, has a sort of oily grassiness like the scents of mowing the lawn, there is a waft of toffee at times, the fruit has a pit and skin aspect to it, mostly peach, apricot and pear, lasts mostly due to aggressiveness than depth of scents. Medium-bodied, does a good job of covering the mouth cheek-to-cheek, especially when you factor in the puffed up carbonation. But it's mostly dull and lifeless on the palate with meager portions of peach, apricot, red apple, red cherry fruit and orange peel. The cocoa and caramel lack sweetness, same could be said for the grain bread and corn flavors. Even the hoppiness lacks real bite, you kinda keep waiting for something to go off but the fuse fizzles out. The kind of beer you'd expect to drink at the ballpark."
"I would prefer Summertime Chicago by goose"
"Drinkability: I could have several of these. Nice, sweet, and a bit fruity for the style. A good warm day beer, I could have a six."
"Egh."
"pours a golden yellow color with a 1 finger head..smell was light of malt and grain and fruity hops.taste was the same faint in hops and malts with a grain and bread taste..really overall just an average brew across the board..not impressive..1 and done for this one 4 me"
"Poured nice golden orange colorr. Kinda of dirty and hazy. Head was at first fairy big but died down quickly. Aroma is kind of earthy and malty. In the taste department theres not enough hops to be a kolsch. This tastes mroe like a belgian pale to me. Really yeasty. Its decent, but i don't think its a kolsch."
"Notes: Definitely a new session beer for me (I love finding new session beers), especially on a hot day in the sun."
"D - A very delicious ale, I was expecting a little more in the hop department, but it was still very tasty and made for an enjoyable first experience for a Kolsch."
"D - I was a little disappointed with this one sure it wasn't bad but seeing the tap handle say pale ale I expected a good hoppy pale and I didn't get that this is a beer that I'd passover for something else"
"Drinkability: Maybe my taste buds are off tonight because I remember it tasting much better last night. It's a hybrid lager-ale, but it's trying to be more like a lager...a macro lager. It's sad, really."
"I am definitely getting this again."
"Cloudy pale gold in color, with a thin and soapy white head. Aroma holds light hops and caramel. Flavor yields delicate honey & toffee maltiness with subtle floral hops. Light in body and super easy to drink. Quite solid overall."
"o - not the best beer, even for the style. very drinkable, but so are most pale ales."
"This is a decently enjoyable beer, but the weakest Ballast Point offering which I've tried to date. It doesn't offend, but it doesn't call out, ""Drink me again!", either."
"Picked this beer up as part of a mixed sixer. Can't really tell why it's called a Pale Ale on the bottle but I digress. This is a good tasting Kolsch and definately a welcome change to my usual fair. I see this beer as a summer time staple due to its lighter body and taste. Probably won't pick this one up again but I will certainly pick up other variations on this style from the different breweries."
"Not much to it, which is kind of the point of a Kolsch. Well-done in all aspects. I just wish they wouldn't call it a pale ale."
"Very nice beer & an excellent example of a kolsch. Too many of this style have a watery aspect, or lack taste, or are just plain boring. This is good. I likes."
"I am surprised at the quality of this beer (or this specific bottle) as I like other Ballast Point beers."
"Drinkability is very solid. So this is the first Kolsch I have ever had, so I'm not sure if how I rated this beer is completely fair. I will revisit this beer/review after I have some other Kolsch's to compare it to. Even though I was expecting an American Pale Ale, I found this beer pretty enjoyable."
"Crisp, bright mouthfeel which is to be expected but then fades to a cloudy, almost musky, dryness. A decent representation of a style that is known for its drinkability so I would consider it fairly 'middle of the road' for this category."
"another delightful offering, best enjoyed during those beautiful summer months, outside, and from the bottle."
"D- I got through about half the glass than decided I didn't want it anymore-drain pour. What's really a shame about this for me is that it is my first disappointment from Ballast Point. I love Sculpin, Big Eye, Double Dorado, Victory at Sea...but this just isn't for me. I guess every brewery has to have their beer that appeals to BMC drinkers...and this is it...unfortunately its on the same tier instead of a step up-even though its supposed to be a completely different style."
"A little pricey for what you get."
"This refreshing Kolsch pours a light straw color, with a nice frothy white head that leaves healthy lacing. The nose give off some hints of yeast, light malty breadiness, and an even fainter hop aroma in the background. When you first sip this brew there is a nice sweet, but light maltiness that is followed by a near perfect hop balance. This very drinkable Kolsch finishes fairly dry, with a light abv of 4.60%."
"Drinkability, is pretty solid, which is something I will say for the kolsch style in general. Yellowtail Pale Ale is solid, but not great."
"Overall, an excellent kolsch that I recommend. Stands out from the other kolschs and shows what the style can be. A couple 12oz'ers or on 22oz is enough at a sitting but could see this as a summer staple (if available here which it isn't). Roatation - not avail here in TX. Definite tap when out West and occasional shipped bottle."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a light pilsner malt scent along with moderate hop aroma and clean finish. The taste is decent as well. It's crisp and clean with a touch of hop bitterness and a solid pilsner malt composition. It's not a complex brew, but it's an easy drinker. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a great summertime brew; light and refreshing."
"Mouthfeel is medium light with a good amount of crisp carbonation."
"Mouthfeel is slightly thin, but thats about my only gripe with this beer. Drinkability is great. it is a smooth and clean, flavorful beer that can be sessioned. Definately something I can get use to drinking more often."
"D: Could be a great summer beer if you dont want heavy flavor to get in the way of a sixer."
"Light, sizzly carbonation on the tongue. Quick and easy to drink."
"Poured a nice golden color with a fairly-large white head. The nose has a lot of malt, especially for a beer being labeled as a kolsch. Along the same lines, this is pretty hoppy, so it seems like BP is right in describing this as a pale ale. Bready malt and some citrus hops come through in the nose and taste. Mouthfeel is very nice and refreshing, with more of the German lager-type carbonation atop this softer pale ale. Drinkability is good."
"Overall impression: An unexpectedly bold, but enjoyable take on the style."
"D: A solid Kolsch, but I really prefer the classic Koln-made stuff in this style. Not a beer where being overly hoppy is a virtue."
"Poured a clean amber , nice lacing. Smell was dominated by malts and a touch of citrus. The mouthfeel and the taste were very smooth and easy on the palate. This is a very drinkable beer, something that I could see pounding on the beach in San Diego all day, but I think it suffers from being overshadowed by the guys at Stone. It doesn't stand out, but maybe that was the intentions, good beer though."
"D - This beer is enjoyable, refreshing and very easy to drink but not all that interesting."
"Not really my style of beer, but not bad for what it is."
"It arrived with a finger of bone-white head with good retention. Color was a bright golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity (although that is redundant when using the term ""bright"" to describe a beer). Nose had an interesting tang, a little sweet, as though the hops and yeast were fighting it out. Mouthfeel was medium with a sweetish, spicy black pepper taste on the tongue. Finish was dry, but not overly so."
"Mouthfeel is a little bit ligt/watery, but still good and easy drinking. Has a toastiness with some subtle wheat and nice earthiness to it. for a so-called pale ale, I'd like it to be a bit hoppier, but as a Kolsch it's just about where it should be."
"It's beer. Hooray beer. Nah, it's quite quaffable, but nothing special. Next."
"D - A decent enough beer, albeit simple and light. I was somewhat expecting a pale ale when I bought the sixer, and was slightly disappointed to see I had bought a kolsch instead. Not bad, but nothing exciting here at all."
"D-pretty tasty and light, solid session beer"
"D - Drinkable beer, but the only time I'd want to was a very hot summer day. Worth a try."
"Nicely done!"
"Drinkability: Sitting at only 4.6%, it's a beer that's easily drinkable. Although, the flavor and aroma is mediocre, so I'm not sure that it's something I want to pick up again."
"I first had this beer at a pasta cafe on coronado in san diego and man was I in love. although it isn't the typical english style pale ale but a german kolsch style, I thought it was so good they could of called it a porter. everything about this beer is good to great. I drank so much of it this summer that my local bevmo started stocking it in the fridges there. I recommend this beer to everyone."
"Decent, but for what its worth I haven't had too many Kolsch styles that have blown me away."
"Drinkability - It was an okay drink, but I don't think I will seek this out. Decent Drinkability but nothing special imo."
"Poured a nice hazy, carbonated, golden yellow with a good head. Floral, citrus, grassy, woody, and brown sugar were all evident in the nose; fairly impressive. The flavor was a little less so, but very good nonetheless, with all of the aforementioned flavors. The finish was a dry grassy-ness. Impressively complex from sip to sip, sometimes tasting like a weak barleywine. Mouthfeel had a nice carbonated balance. Definitely good for a session."
"12oz. Poured bright golden yellow with a very thin white head that left little lacing. Aromas were simple with some hints of biscuity malt and trace citric hop. Tastes were crisp with notes of biscuity malt (similar to other Ballast Point offerings), mildly fruity, with a slight grassy hop bitterness on the clean finish. Mouth-feel was thin to medium, but creamy and smooth with moderate carbonation. Well balanced and represents the style well."
"Received this one in a trade. Not a huge Kolsch fan, but this one is good. Cloudy, yellow/gold body with a pillowy white head that sits around for a while. Smells like a lot of citrus and a little soapy smell at the end. Very drinkable, light beer with an earthy, bitter flavor."
"D - this is an easy drinking, delicious kolsch. One of the better ones I have had."
"Pours a clear gold color with a white one finger head. Aroma is of lemon, hops, and bread. The taste is somewhat sweet, and matches the aroma. The mouthfeel is somewhat thin. The beer is crisp, refreshing, and easy to drink with decent carbonation. It is also somewhat generic. Nothing wrong with this beer, but nothing which stands out either."
"Medium-high carbonation with a medium body on the palate. A clean and dry fiinish makes this one very drinkable. Enters smooth on the palate and finishes nice and crisp. Hmm, after a few sips I seems to get a little rough and grainy/bitter sensation on the palate, but doesn't happen on every sip. Nice beer actually, and an interesting take on the style."
"The mouth is crisp with a medium-high amount of carbonation. Flavor is of buttered biscuits finished with a sharp hop bite. This is one of the more refreshing beers I've had this summer. This will be a regular for barbecues and ballgames."
"D: The extremely low ABV and simple flavors make this one a lawn mower type beer. However, I still wish it were more refreshing like the style typically seems to be."
"Medium body, to medium-light. This was a bomber from around the grill, and it was perfect. Great drinkable summer beer. Went down extremely easy, and had no harsh edges. Great balance between the sweet and dry. WTF is wrong with me. I'vbe been staring at this beer on the shelves for abou a year before finally pulling the trigger and buying it yesterday. Well worth it. I will definitely explore other offerings from these guys. Buy this."
"HV"
"D: Quite refreshing for when the temps get up there. Don't know if I'd buy it again, but I certainly wouldn't turn it down at a party/BBQ."
"With that said, I've gone through a six pack of bottles in which each bottle produced a head greater in volume than the content of liquid being poured into the glass. I don't know how that happens, but it's happened consistently here."
"M/D: Light to medium bodied, soft carbonation. Good drinkability. Overall, a solid beer. Could use some bolstering in the aroma and taste department, but it's a pretty good Kolsch despite some missing elements."
"A good brew worth a drink or two every now and then."
"Overall I would not drink this again and the flavors put me off. I have not had another beer from this style so I will do that and compare and see if its the style I do not like."
"D- Sessionable and good for a go. Im not sold on the Kolsch style yet as i've only tried two in the style but this does not make me jump for more. A good summer beer and I could see myself taking a case to a party."
"D: Very refreshing! And at 4.60%ABV, this is one beer that you can literally get lost in all day. Seemingly perfect for the style."
"Drinkability/Final thoughts - Well this beer really really reminded me of Fat Tire, with all it's chocolaty cake flavors and over the top malts. No that's not bad but, more like something you feel like once in a while. Not bad and pretty enjoyable, but for the money Id probably go with Fat Tire, my personal choice. Give it a try, it's still a decent beer with good flavors. Cheers!"
"Too bad this isn't available in GA yet, I would get this beer all throughout the summer. Definitely recommended."
"D - This one goes down easy. Is it just the memories conjured up by my authentic Fruh glassware? Nah...this is actually a refreshing beer. Well balanced, nice pilsner character pairing with a floral hop profile. Not quite a world-class example but a damn fine beer none the less."
"Pours a little hazy/translucent golden with average white head that has some decent retention. Nose is faint citrus, herbal, and light melon. Palate offers a nice herbal dry character, and somewhat ""dirty"" on the finish. Refreshing and rather easy drinking. Pairs well with french bread."
"Yellowtail Pale Ale is easily the most disappointing beer I've had from Ballast Point. First of all, the name is a little misleading (at least in my opinion). To be fair it says it's a Kolsch, but I wasn't holding the bottle when I ordered it over the interwebz. Small gripe. More substantively, the nose is very weak, it's way short on flavor, and is way too damn dry. I recognize that Kolsch is a tough style to pull off. But, this one's not really close to a good take on it. If crossed with the opportunity to pick up another bottle, I'd probably pass. I'd suggest you do the same."
"Drinkability= Average. Very underwhelmed by this beer. I've had many other pales with a ton more flavor. There again is the Kolsch thing...Would not drink again"
"D. Pretty decent. This isn't an award-winning beer, but you could surely do worse on these beastly Southern summer afternoons."
"D - Nice and refreshing."
"This is a relatively bitter pale ale, great if your a hop head and if you like Ballast Point's Big Eye IPA. This beer was very crisp and refreshing but certainly flavorful; as perfect for a warm summer day as a snowy day in January. This is the kind of beer I could easily drink all day."
"Poured a weak looking hazy lemon yellow with a very little foam and no lace. The smell of citrus filled the nose with a nice aroma. The taste was of a grapefruit and light flavored hop's. Nice balance of bitterness that feel's like a citrus type of bitterness. I do think that this pale ale taste's better when it cold and not while it warms up!"
"ok, not bad. the ""pale ale"" label is misleading however. anyway, seems some of my previous reviews for kolsch might need some updating. will have to re-try a fresh reissdorf for comparison."
"The mouthfeel strikes me as starchier than expected. Its rough, hop-forward flavor exhibits lemon tartness and pale German malt. The hops give character where the grains merely balance. Very spicy bitterness. This would be a very nice summer pounder but the lemon flavor is a little too one-dimensional."
"i have to agree with the previous reviewer's description. this one is very biscuity ,and the floral hops are a perefect accessory to the malt. hints of sweetness along with everything else make for a slightly unusual but quite refreshing and delicious beer. this is for sure not a dieseldorf, but very good in it's own right. another quality beer from a brewery that i wish would focus on their strengths and not what they think the masses want."
"One of the better American examples of the style and very sessionable."
"The body is light and easy drinking. Some chalky notes linger in the mouthfeel though. The carbonation is a bit low as well, and could help if more with carbonic bite. Overall, a easy drinking beer but misses it's mark on being a Kolsch. Would like to see more of a German malt taste, but hey."
"Pale golden with medium fizzy head, not as good as you'd expect for lacing or retention. Big, slow bubbles of carbonation rising up. Smell is a bit too sweet and grainy. A little sour lemon. Taste is pretty good. Not as sweet as the nose suggests. Some earthy hops come in with big biscuit and grain. A bit of lemon again and a touch of honey. Still a decent sweetness all along. Light mouthfeel with a little dryness in the finish. Sweet and bready. Not extremely drinkable, a pint or two maybe. Every time I try a Kolsch I think of a Charleston classic. Tough competition."
"This is fast becoming my ""everyday"" beer of choice. Its drinkability is quite excellent. Although the KÃ¶lsch has been thought of as more of a warm-weather brew, I could definitely enjoy this one year-round. It may not be as bold as other styles, but that's where its beauty lies. Worth trying, for sure."
"A go to beer for many of my non-craft beer friends when I drag them out, and a big money maker for Ballast Point; allowing them crazy folk to tinker elsewhere."
"22 oz bomber. Pours with a small bubbly white head. Well carbonated. Slightly cloudy dark mustard color. Very light grassy sour aroma. Starts sweet and tart, quite light, refreshing. Flavor is mild but pleasant. Notes of apples, pears and lemons. Overall easy to drink but not terribly interesting."
"Anywho, a decent drinker. Weird my package store just got this in as it doesn't seem like a winter type brew.. in fact it's the exact opposite. There's intense carbonation in this bad boy, I had trouble pouring it without the head spilling over (maybe my bottle was old/infected?). Very light bodied with a nice crispness to it. Some slight hops are there but it drinks like a pils/kolsch as the bottle states. Pale ale.. nah not enough hops for that. Not something I'd buy again but decent."
"7/4/7/4/14 (3.6/5)"
"Clear, golden beer with a white head. Light aroma of malt and honey. Tastes sharp like a pilsner, but with equal malt flavors. A nutty character sometimes pops with a hint of biscuits. I don't know why they call this a pale ale, because its not. Oh well, its still good."
"Yellowtail pours a tarnished gold with a bubbly bleach white head that retains pretty well,but leaves very little lacing as it recedes to a paper thin covering. The nose seems a bit understated and one dimensional,grainy,with the slightest amount of floral hops. Not realizing that this was a Kolsch style PA I thought it was a bit underpowered in the hop department. Upon reading the label and realizing the style being attempted I find this to be quite nice and balanced. A touch of grainy lightly toasted malt is backed up by an equal balance of earthy,grassy hops. Subtle lemon and spice. A slightly slick mouthfeel followed by dry,prickly cabonation and a slightly bitter finish. Yellowtail Pale Ale was not what I expected,it is balanced and very drinkable."
"Beer poured golden with a nice long lasting white head. Nose is malty with a hint of light fruits. Taste has hints of the light fruits and is balanced nicely by a slight hint of hops. Mouthfeel is a bit heavier than normal for the style yet it is crisp and lively on the palate. Overall drinkability is good. This is another finely crafted beer by one of the lesser known San Diego breweries. Definitely worth a shot for a change of pace!"
"Notes from 6/3/05"
"Drinkability: I'm not really a KÃ¶lsch man, but I could drink these for a while. Kind of like flavored water... with alcohol."
"It has a light mouthfeel and the carbonation is medium. Btw, head retention is above average and there's some nice lacing. This would be a nice everyday beer for those who can get it locally."
"I really did not enjoy this beer and thought the X blew it out of the water. I would not recommend it nor would I buy it again."
"Refresing with a nice afterglow. Not really memorable on the tongue though. Probably not a bomber type beer. Nice try, but maybe not their style."
"Clear, bright, pale gold with a white collar and thin skim of very fine bubbles coating the surface of the beer. Even with a meager head, there was still spotty lacing. Fruity aroma, oranges, grassy, citrus rind, cakey, but fairly mild overall. Moderate bitterness with a fruity sweetness, basically the same character as found in the aroma. Lingering citrus oil bitterness. Light bodied and dry with moderate carbonation, fairly crisp. Quite drinkable and nicely balanced with hops and bitterness just surpassing the sweetness. Solid overall."
"The taste is light but zesty and intriguing, grain, crackers, citrus, 7-up, hints of grass and pine, light sweetness and balancing bitterness. It has great balance and is quenching."
"Not as easy drinking as one might think; the substantial malt profile more or less overwhelms the light hop character of grass, flowers and fruits and keeps this one from being a porch swing/lawnmower beer."
"I'm not entirely sold on the Kolsch description of this beer if only because there is a bit less spiceness, a bit less fruitiness, and more earthy hops that make this a bit of a cross between a modest APA and a rather weakish IPA. The kolsch description is more of a stretch for me. The beer was a very refreshing, decently carbonated, slightly floral beer that went down smoothly. It was unexceptional, but I did like things more in the finish as the beer settled, and then some residual dryness and nuttiness emerged. I would go at this again just to see if my initial trepidation with the kolsch labeling holds true at at later date."
"Overall, this is a pretty solid brew that I enjoyed drinking. It is perfect to enjoy on a warm summer day. Recommended."
"D - This reminds me of the cereals that I loved as a kid and for that it gets an A in my book! This is an oddball brew....especially for the usually unassuming style. This shit was $12 for the six pack in Fort Collins, CO but I can see why....this is good beer."
"Great beer that Im glad I tried.I will buy it more often.Thanks for coming to Pa."
"This is a near perfect beer when you are in the mood for a light, refreshing ale with some character."
"D: I really like this beer. All the flavors are subdued, but they work very well together. This beer does down easy and is very refreshing."
"To me this particular brew by Ballast lacks the brightness and crisp taste of other kolsch brews. And if labled as a pale ale I still would think the overall flavor subdued. Not a bad beer by any stretch though. In fact this might be a good beer to start a macro-drinker into craft beer. Its not too agressively flavored that it would scare anyone off."
"I think I like KÃ¶lsch"
" This one is a VERY crisp, very clean and refreshing semi-sweet malt that has a subtle clover-honey current with a dry- wheat and herbal hop balance. Yummy and amazingly drinkable."
"Overall, it was a good beer. Take it along on your next fishing trip or BBQ."
"UPDATE: 5/13/10: I'd just add that there's an interesting popcorn aroma and pleasant mineral character to the flavor and water."
"On tap at Lahainas in Pacific Beach. Clear golden color with no almost no head. Tastes more like a pilsener than an pale. Light floral aroma with just a bit of citrus. I drank about 3 pitchers of this beer just sitting out on the patio at Lahainas on a beautiful night."
"Yes, it's light of nature and character and sometimes that makes for a fine session beer, but in this case it makes for more of a boring beer. There's just not enough there to make it notable or especially desirable in any real way. It does drink easily enough, but there's not a lot of reward for the effort, as minimal as it may be. And the downside to a bomber is I just might doze off before I finish it."
"D - This is one of the best Kolsch-style ales that I've ever had. I liked the hop kick that it had."
"A crisp light beer. Flavor is very mild and subdued. Overall, nothing extraordinary though."
"Drinkability is ruined by the persistent metallic taste."
"Pours a clear gold with a white-ish head that wastes no time in falling. Flavor is a bit sweet and smooth. Noticeable grain attributes. But that sweet aftertaste sticks with you for quite some time. Feel has a biting carbonation. This is pretty easy to drink. I have to say this kÃ¶lsch style is growing on me lately."
"Drinkability: A little maltier than would be expected for the KÃ¶lsch style; when I reviewed this on tap I was overly critical as I thought it was a pale ale"
"Pours a clear yellow/straw with a large white head that leaves good lacing. The smell is somewhat pungent with bread yeast and floral scents. The taste is light,crisp,and clean with bread yeast,hops,and floral flavors. The m/f is light with all the flavors mixing well. A nice light summer beer with alot of taste."
"Drinkability- Haven't had many of this style, but it went down easy enough. Decent enough to try."
"Light body, watery finish, lightly carbonated."
"This wouldn't be the first beer I'd reach for, but it is innocent enough to enjoy. No flaws but no curiosities either."
"Pours a clear, rich yellow with minimal head. Smell is sweet, malty, inviting. taste is a rich blend of sweet malt on the front with a decent, slightly bitter hop finish. Mouthfeel is almost creamy, slighly chewy. Drinkability is enhanced by the creaminess and light hop finish."
"Surprisingly had never tasted this one until yesterday, not one of Ballast Point's best by any means but not bad for its style, might drink again, especially in the summer time, worth trying"
"Very clear pale gold in color, very thin head but has some lacing. Smell is reminds me of the BMC crowd. Taste is better than the smell, but leaves a yeastiness lingering. Light on the hops, carbonation is OK but not great. Not too bad, but I was expecting a little better."
"D : For a kolsch, it just doesn't do it for me. It is not a crisp and refreshing as I would expect."
"Drinkbaility: definite session beer here. I was surprised the label states pale ale but the liner notes explain this is a kolsch. Tasty and worth a try."
"D: This is a hell of a session brew. Very tasty, and I could see drinking this on a regular basis."
"A decent attempt at the style, though not quite as crisp and refreshing as some more classic examples of a Kolsch-style beer, IMO."
"22 ounce bomber, no freshness info offered. Pours light and clear, under a fairly thin off white tiny bubble head, that leaves plenty of sticky, fine sheeting. Resiny hop nose. Easy drinking, snappy, hopped up offering. I personally find it confusing when a brewery puts out a ""pale ale"" that actually is a Kolsch beer. Anyway, this beer is a pleasant enough light sipper. Nothing special going on here."
"D: An extremely clean, crisp drinking pale with a wet citrusy nature makes this a classic example and easy to drink and enjoy."
"Pours perfectly clear, with a beautiful bright gold hue but no head to speak of. The nose is pretty mild -- just some clear, pale German style malts and a dusting of hops. On the palate, surprisingly rich, almost chewy malt content that nonetheless remains light. Both hops and carbonation provide a sharp and balancing counterpoint to the malt. Mouthfeel is just right for the style -- or at least the American version of the style, as it's a bit thicker and bigger than the original kolsches. Overall, though, this is quite nice. It's not a bold, incredibly complex beer, but it is drinkable and satisfying and doesn't sport any flaws. Well done."
"D- This one was boring to me and was not fun to drink. Its an easy drinker and sessionable but nothing exciting."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not filling at all, mild kick, very good representation of style, this is very good beer to pound for and entire evening."
"Gold pour, light white head, short lived. Smell is of some light malt and hops with a slight grassy alcohol smell. Taste is fairly crisp, refreshing, with a decent bite to it reminiscent of a pilsner. A bit dryer than most kolsches and light to medium carbonation. One of the better ones of the style that I have had."
"Nice yellow, straw color with a rocky, puffy head. It also had a musty smell to it. The flavor was some must, subtle fruitiness, and the mouthfeel was crisp. I could see drinking a couple of these while doing yard work. Then again, I would probably just buy the Big Eye IPA instead."
"D- I purchased this beer at a Von's close to my San Diego resort and was unable to find a freshness date or code to find if I was drinking old beer. Ballast Point has such a great rep that I hope it was old and not them. I will give this one another shot if I can get it in the future."
"This brew is a slightly hazy, straw gold color. Nice sized white head floats above. Light malt on the nose with a touch of hops. Mostly light malt on the taste, a nice kiss of floral hops. Very refreshing brew. Too bad they don't offer these in six packs around here, you could put down quite a few of these on a nice summer day."
"It doesn't finish clean and dry which is another thing I would expect. Leaves a bit of a greasy feeling in the mouth. This is just a mediocre beer regardless of style."
"No real head, the mouthfeel is flat and thin, and there is a sour aftertaste that is neither pleasant, nor well integrated with the flavor of the beer. And the beer, itself, has no real hops, no malt-backbone, and other real flavors to speak of. Just not good, at all. Pours a yellow with a hint of amber/orange."
"Pours a light golden copper color with a small, dense, tightly packed head. Head-retention is lacking, but some lacing is left on the glass. Aroma is very sweet with a subdued hop presence. Taste is different. Definitely not the typical pale ale. Actually, it's a Kolsch-style ale. Not very much like a common American pale ale. Very sweet and malty with a very grainy/toasted malt flavor. A slight grassy hoppiness is noted. Mouthfeel is smooth and crisp, and the carbonation helps it go down. Overall a less-than average beer, but maybe its because they call it a pale ale. It might be a pale-colored ale, but in San Diego, this beer would not pass as the standard pale ale style. A note to Ballast Point: please label your brews accordingly."
"Pours a clear golden orange/yellow color, nice carbonation, tiny fizzy/creamy white head, some sticky lacing around the edges. The nose is slightly sweet, hoppy/malty, spicy, and some caramel. The taste is soury though, slightly hoppy, some spices thrown in and caramel. The finish is dry. Medium body. Drinkable, I bought this thinking is was a Pale Ale, WRONG! Not really a fan of Kolsch brew's."
"D- You would think with the inoffensive taste this brew would be pretty drinkable but I find myself not wanting to ever pick up another glass after the first. It only seems a bit better than something i'd pick up in a cheap 18 pack at the liquor store, quite dissapointing for a craft brew."
"...searching....searching....no, that's all I have to say on this..."
"A soapy head forms on top of this golden ale, albeit one that doesn't last too long. But it does the job on a pleasant warm day. It's semi-sweet with some hop grape and bready flavors. The crispness is light and finishes a touch dry. A great beer to have when the weather is too much to have something big."
"Bready and biscuit malt flavors. A tinge of lemony hops. Slight bitterness towards the edges of the tongue. A bit bland with not much going on. Thicker body then I expected as I was looking for something more crisp and cleaner. Slick through the mouth leaving a trail of buttery ooze behind. Again, like the aromas, the flavors are just middle of the road. Nothing stands out here. A mediocre brew at best, though actually quite drinkable, despite it's pedestrian disposition."
"Not bad, not great either. I had no trouble drinking this one, but I probably wouldn't buy it again."
"OK, but something off in taste or smell. Could be that this is not a fast mover at the Marriott. I would be willing to try again based on brewer's reputation, but not in any great hurry."
"12 oz. bottle- color of honey yellow , with a decent frothy off white head - nose of citrus (orange) , sweat , slight hops , and malts Â taste of grapefruit , dough , hops , and slight minty-ness - body is medium , dry chalky-ness, and with medium carbonation Â aftertaste of stale hops , sweat , and salty"
"An enjoyable beer, but nothing that particularly stands out. A bit too sweet for a beer this light, at least for me. But it's certainly worth trying."
"Pours a medium gold with little head and little hops aroma. I don't pick up any hops or malt aroma. Taste is a bit soapy? Not much body or hops. Mouthfeel is a light-which is good for a Kolsch. Drinkability-I have to give this beer a good because it is drinkable and is one I could have after mowing the lawn (if I had a lawn)"
"This is a great Western take on a traditional European style. It's really quite good. The name is confusing though, as this is definitely not your typical california Pale Ale, and the text on the label clearly calls it a golden Kolsch. Weird. I probably won't drink it again, but if you're into this style I'de highly recommend it."
"If you can find this fresh and like the style, it's worth a try. Very nicely integrated beer."
"Poured from a 22oz., this beer is very clear with a light orange tint, there was a decent head that faded away after a minute or two, good amount of carbonation. The smell is very nice, a light citrus fruit that was unexpected. The taste/mouthfeel is somewhat watery, yet not bad. It is very light on the tongue, not really much malt flavor, and leaves a slightly tangy finish that fades about 15 seconds later to a earthy aftertaste. Overall this was a very smooth and well balanced beer, very drinkable."
"This was an good tasting Kolsch style beer."
"Has the potential to be a good beer, so maybe IÂll try another bottle at some point. However, if this is the norm for this beer, then IÂll have to pass."
"Medium body with crisp, refreshing carbonation. The ABV makes this very sessionable. Ballast Point hasn't let me down yet. Nothing absolutely outstanding, but every one very solid."
"This beer is a little lighter than typical. There is a foamy head. The smell is similar to a lighter beer combined with a wheat beer. The taste is a bad bitter. Not a very desirable beer. this is kinda hard to drink. I don't think this beer will be in my cabinet again."
"This is a style I don't really have a lot of experience with, but this beer motivates me to explore more."
"What a good refreshing beert. Highly drinkable, and perfect for a hot Summer day."
"Overall I really like this beer, it has a really pleasant nutty malt. And for an ale it is really smooth, bordering on a lager. This is my first of the style so I dont have anthing to compare it to but i really like it."
"D- this is a good summer brew. Refreshing with good flavor. I'll reach for this when i need to cool down and unwind."
"The beer has a fairly light taste to it, in fact it is almost completely dry. The hops almost get it a tangy tartness though and there is a noticeable herbal hop character found throughout this beer. The flavor almost reminds me of those exotic, yet mellow, basils (e.g. cinnamon basil), but that is not quite it. A light lemon-like note is here as well as some spicy hop notes. This is not your typical American Pale Ale, but I really like its hop leanings. Light and quaffable as well and it makes for an easy drinking 22oz bottle."
"It has a smell of malty cider and is quite woody. The taste is a dry full flavored caramel with some nuttiness- cedar-like finish. Extremely drinkable --a little too chalky in the mouthfeel."
"D: eh. So why don't they bottle the DIPA?"
"nothing memorable, just a middle of the road quaffer. I'd drink again if offerd, but wouldn't seek it out."
"Quite a tasty beer that was light in body, had a good smooth mouthfeel, with a modest ABV making it a very easy beer to enjoy. I happily recommend this one, cheers!"
"Had on tap at Pizza Port Carlsbad. Crystal clear clear clear yellow pale straw. Fair size head that left bunch of white lace. Very light hop nose and malt as well. First sip light corn flavor and grain. Very crisp finish and very full mouthfeel for this type of light brew. No aftertaste which was nice for this type. Good drinkable beer on and on"
"NOTE: I just read up a little on Yellowtale brewing from their web site and found that they use 5% wheat in this beer...THAT is the crispness I was tasting...there is definately a bread thing going on in the taste and aftertaste. Wonderful!"
"Pale yellow with about a half finger of white head. Grassy, earthy hop aroma with a light biscuity background. Well balanced hop/malt flavor. The grassiness plays well with the caramel malt. The medium mouthfeel and slightly dry finish makes this really refreshing and enjoyable."
"A tasty Kolsch from Ballast Point. Dark yellow gold with a foamy white head, with hints of yeast in the aroma. Smooth and medium bodied with a great light hop bitterness that adds a little spiciness to this easy drinkin' brew. 12 oz bottle from a sixpack purchased at the Mission Valley(San Diego) BevMo."
"Notes: I like some hops to balance out a good kolsch. This stays on the bready side all the way through and it leans towards doughy. Good malt character. Delicate finish. Not one of my favorites but its an approachable offering with some depth."
"Light bodied. Would be great on a hot day, but overall pretty bleh and plain."
"Yellowtail Pale Ale is a decent Kolsch that doesn't put any kind of a serious scare into the world's best versions. After enjoying Big Eye IPA, it was my hope that this one would be just as good. No such luck. While I don't have any desire to throw it back, I won't be mounting it above my mantle either."
"Overall impression: A nicely drinkable beer. I always like it when beers that were previously bombers only show up in six packs! This would be a great choice for any spring/summer activity."
"Thanks for yet another Ballast Point offering Mr. Bum."
"Deep gold with a vigorous 1 inch pale yellow head. Sweet grain maltiness with a very mild hop citrus notes. Dry malt up front and a mild, soft hop finish. Typical pale ale, IMO. Nothing too exciting, but still a great offering from a good San Diego brewery. Give it a try when you find it."
"Had a yard of this at O'Hungry's in Old Town yesterday and was very impressed. It poured a nice medium yellow color with a small white head that left some lace down the glass. The smell was very refreshing with a crisp hop scent. The flavor was equally as smoothe and crisp with a slight hop kick that was more balanced towards the slighty spicy malt profile. This is a great session beer and just goes to show that you can make a very light and drinkable beer and still have a great flavor."
"Tasted at the Orange Blossom Festival in Riverside, California. Served very cold on a cold, rainy day. Pours a golden yellow with minimal head. Aroma & flavor follow each other fairly well- there is a nice hops balanced with a light citrusy and buttery tones. A complete lack of sweetness. Drinkability is, well, let's put it this way- my notes say: ""yes!!!""."
"A super drinkable brew, very mild brew."
"The beer after splitting from the 22 ounce bottle pours a translucent and lustrous gold with the head large and bright white with a pleasing creamy texture, lace a fine silky curtain to cover the glass. Nose is dominated by the sweet malt, crisp and fresh, with the start nicely malted, lightly sweet and the top fair in its feel to the palate. Finish is equable in its acidity, the hops are pleasing but a bit mild, the aftertaste quite dry and a fine session beer it will make."
"Very drinkable. This was an excellent session beer."
"This is a light golden colour with a fluffy head of all-white foam. The aromas are slightly fruity, with nice roasted malts, and slight citrus-y/floral hops in the aroma. The taste is super light and refreshing. You can really tell that this is a low alcohol brew that is crafted with the utmost care and passion. Truly 'artisinal'. The mouthfeel is pretty good, bordering on great and the drinkability is nice for this new age Kolsch as well. A good, solid, brew!"
"Overall- A good Kolsch that's a decent beer on a warm day."
"A clean and crisp brew that really hits the spot. The golden-hued body has a nice head and laces well. The nose is malty and bready with a good sense of grain. There is nice flavor from the malting and the feel is quite light and crisp, giving a very nice snappy finish. Easily drinkable in some volume."
"This is a very easy-drinking brew. I found Yellowtail Pale Ale (?) to be a delightful beer."
"This is a lawnmower beer. That's all. Slightly sweet on the tongue w/ a little bite. It has No aroma. The appearance is Clear yellow w/ a small head. You won't find much flavor here"
"Overall: Labeled as a Pale Ale in the style of a Cologne KÃ¶lsch. It is certainly a decent effort, the malt aspect is crisp and light hops are refreshing. Not a bad effort at all."
"Medium yellow color. Medium head. Aroma is malty and sweet. A medium bodied ale. Malts are mild, fruity and kind of sweet. Hops are present, but kind of hidden. They pop out at you every once in a while. Very smooth. More of a Kolsch than a pale ale. It's a great hot day/lawnmover beer. Mild and interesting. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"Advertised as a kolsch-style, one should expect this to be less a ""west coast"" pale than Ballast Point's other offering. The beer is a clear, very light copper in color, with a very thin head. Aroma is mild, wheaty and suffused with German hops. The flavor is surprisingly rich for such a crisp-feeling body, with a raw grainy malt and an earthy/herbal hop very dry finish. A refreshing yet substantial beer, and a nice entry in a style which, admittedly, I tend to find a bit uninspiring."
"This different pale ale has a sweet fruity aroma.  There is a hint of ester in the flavor as well as a good sweet smooth malt presence.  This brew is more reminiscent of a tasty golden ale.  The only really noticeable hop presence is a bit of a bitterness in the finish."
"Notes: Decent go at the KÃ¶lsch style, quite palatable with an impressive malt character for such a light coloured brew. Nice addition of hops to make for a perfect balance."
"I enjoy a good pale ale and this is a pretty good one.  Had it shipped for the holidays and I was the hit of the party.  Very drinkable, very balanced.  Everything you can hope for in an ale."
