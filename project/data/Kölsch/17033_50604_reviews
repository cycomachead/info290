"Franconia Kolsch is a cloudy yellow beer with almost no head which I found hard to move past at first. It smells like a light nutty sweet grain as you'd expect from this style, but it falls short of outstanding. On the tongue is a bit flat, but still refreshing and smooth. It's unique enough to warrant an outstanding rating for it's sweet grain flavor. Overall it's a good beer, but with a little better carbonation it could be a great beer."

"This kolsch beer is a decent example of the style, even if it is somewhat lighter than I prefer. Its appearance could stand to be improved, as there is almost no foam to speak of, and the sweetness level could prove too much for some. I donâ€™t rank it among my favorite examples of this style, but I can agree that it is extremely drinkable and it would make a good choice of beer for a hot summer day."

"Overall: Better than average but with a few tweaks it could be outstanding."

"It is one of the better Kolsch I've had."

"On tap at the brewery. The beer pours a golden yellow color with a white head. The aroma is wheat and grain with some lemon and grass notes. The flavor is more of the same. I get a lot of wheat with some lemon and grape notes. There is a little bit of grass and earth from the hops, but they contribute basically no bitterness. Light and refreshing, this is a very easy beer to drink. Medium carbonation. A great beer for a hot summer day."
"Good on a warm summer day."
"D: pleasant, a little sweeter than than I like my Kolschs. Maybe even a little macro brewer-y."
"Well done!"
"D - This is the definition of a ho hum beer and yes I know its not supposed to be big and bold but my ADD is to strong for this beer its average, boring, and just not worth it to me"
"I think this a very good Kolsch. There is a lot going on here. A surprisingly and deceivingly complex brew. Light, but enough body and flavor to satisfy. A great beer for the hot Texas summers, or just for an easy session. Recommended."
"Had this beer a few weeks ago, so this review is from the notes I wrote about it. It poured with a light light golden color with a clear body. It a nice hoppy smell with hints of fruits, which I thought were mostly apple. I was surprised with the taste though because the fruits were not nearly as strong as they were in the smell. It was very light and crisp in the mouth. It would be a good replacement for any light beer on a night out. Definitely worth a try."
"a very consistent beer. not riddled with a taste of corn like most american kolsch style beers. crisp... some apple malt qualities and some very subdued hop that just clears everything out. simple, and not astringent or acidic. tight in form and mild in taste."
"A recommended kolsch but not in the upper tier of the style."
