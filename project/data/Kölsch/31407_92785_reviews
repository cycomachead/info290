"Tastes like a generic, commercial pale ale. Not worth reviewing."
""
""
""
"Overall - A brew that is not sure what it is trying to be (a kölsch, a pilsner, a blonde?). This one needs to go back to the drawing board."

"An exquisite example of a Blonde ale. Straw golden and transparent with a white frothy head. Very clean with a hint of Vienna malt. Just enough flavor to not be distracting and leave you wanting to quaff more."
"Light beer I had on draft.  High drink ability but not as satisfying as I had hoped from a blonde ale."
""
"O- one of the more flavorful kolsch's that I've had and seems to follow the style, very good session option"
"Overall, good beer, refreshing, and very easy to drink."
"Not a fan. Empty taste."
""
"Overall: It may not be big, but it has plenty of subtler flavors mixed in that go very well together."

"Clean crisp and dry kolsch, nicely done for an American brewery. Finishes a touch more astringent than some of the finer German kolsch, but quite drinkable."

"D - Light beer, good flavors and very sessionable."

"Crisp as any Kolsch should be"

"The Verdict: Pretty good. Good taste, goes down smooth… a great session beer."
"Overall I enjoyed this beer. Not sure I'd drink it on a regular basis, but if it were on tap at my favorite pub, I'd give it a go again."

"A very tasty brew. I would have another once for sure."

"o: for the style, its solid. its a simpler style, but as i'm drinking it the sun is out and i'm enjoying sipping on it. if you're looking for some mind blowing beer, this isn't it. this is an easy drinking beer that has enough flavor to leave you enjoying each sip"

"Overall-Finish could be longer. I always wanted more than what I got out of both the nose and flavors. Overall just not a very complex beer."

"The beer is light golden colored and topped with a small white head with okay retention and a few strings of lacing. The aroma smells like a fresh kolsch, with hay, fruitiness, and a mineral note. A good start, which only continues into the taste. The taste is a little stronger per style with a brush of fruitness, pleasing hay, whispers of malt, complemented with a light body and gentle carbonation. For a beer lover who has had fresh kolsch in Cologne itself, Saint Archer has hit the target very well. Well worth the purchase, and a better option than Yellowtail Pale Ale among San Diego made kolsch-styled beers."

"Pours a hazy yellow with a foamy off-white head that fades to nothing. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and grassy aromas. Taste is much the same with grain and grassy flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty, refreshing, and very easy to drink."

"Overall: A beer of the month club selection. A very drinkable and refreshing Kolsch beer."

"If you are a fan of traditional Kolsch style beers, this is an amazing representation of the style. An amazing beer for these beautiful San Diego Summer Days!! Smell, taste and overall apperance of the beer was spot on!! Way to go Saint Archer!! Can't wait to try your other styles!!!"
"Overall, this is one of the best Kolsch beers I've had. It was very drinkable and refreshing. Would definitely have again and recommend. If you have someone that doesn't like craft beer, or is stuck on BMC, this is a great beer to have them try."
"Clean, true and what is expected of a Kolsch. Balanced and session able. I don't typically drink this style and have been handed many different things across the ""blonde"" lable. It is nice to order a Blonde and get this. ""goes down easy, just how I like my Blondes"""

"A little sharp, quite light bodied, with that distinctive perfumey flavor. Quite drinkable with a hoppiness that seems to grow as you sip. Perhaps more hoppy than some examples of the style, but so much better than many American examples. Pleasingly bitter and it's mellowed by something like graham crackers, though not sweet at all. From the 22 oz bottle purchased at Bottleworks in San Diego at a price I'd like to see more of: $4.15."
