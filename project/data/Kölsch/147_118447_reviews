"I like it a lot. There is a good amount of smokiness that I didn't expect. It's a hard beer to rate because it's outside it's style so much."
""
""
""
""
"Not a fan of Kolsch's for the most part. The dark roasts and rye contrasting the barnyard light kolsch tastes really make the Sprocketbier shine."
""
"O: This is not at all what I expected when I saw ""Kölch"" on the label at first. It's more indicative of a stout than a traditional pale of the name, but I have no complaints. Delicious, drinkable and sessionable. Another solid from Stone!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not a bad brew but could use a bit of tweaking, maybe it's because I haven't had a lot of experience with Kolsch beers. Worth sharing the bottle with friend, salad!"
""
""
"As to mouthfeel, this is obviously heavier than your average kolsch but still retains considerable drinkability. Once more the schwarzbier comparisons are in order. Moderate to high carbonation with some welcome hop resin prickliness. Faint wood char in the dry bread-like finish. Obviously this beer is supposed to be bastardized, cutting across multiple style domains. Faulting it for not tasting like a classic kolsch seems pedantic and persnickety. In my view this is a more than worthwhile exercise in tasting gymnastics."
"Would have been a lot better if it had more alc/vol. at least 9%"
"As dark as pumpernickel bread with a similar rye aroma. The smokiness and rye notes dominate up front here. This is an interesting beer, has a mealy mouthfeel. Almost like drinking a reuben sandwich. Enjoyable but would likely not seek out again unless pairing with food."
"Beer was ok. Not the best"
""
"O: [3.75] By look, smell, taste and mouthfeel I'd call this a stout.  The label says otherwise.  Either way it is really tasty.  A lot of flavor packed into 5.4% ABV.  A well made and well executed beer.  I would like to have it again."
""

"Final score: 4.13"

"(3.80) O: provides a deep dark roastiness in a 5.4% packaging which many may overlook or have trouble believing. Roasted coffee and yeasty fruitiness that drinks much bigger then expected. Nice blending. Don't expect a true  Kolsch style here, with more and more breweries blurring the lines its hard to hold one accountable when it doesn't fit snuggly into one clearly defined parameter, when it clearly was never intended to be in the first place. outside the box."

"Bottle: Poured a black color ale with a large off-white foamy head with good retention and some light lacing. Aroma consists of roasted malt with dry bitter notes with some citrus hoppy notes also noticeable. Taste is also dominated by dry bitter roasted malt notes with some light spicy rye notes with some hoppy citrus notes. Body is a bit light with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol.  Not bad but not great either and not sure I could have said this was a Kolsch had it not been mentioned on the label."

"Feeling adventurous. Thought I try it. The best way I could describe, it smells like a Porter but drinks like the lightest Porter you ever had."
"Certainly the darkest kolsch I've seen...  Aroma is dominated by roast malt, coffee grounds, dark chocolate, and nutty, deeply roasted notes. Flavor reveals a base of kolsch yeast fruitiness, which becomes roasty mid palate, turning nutty and fairly bitter at the smoky finish. More bitter than I prefer, but the kolsch yeast does shine."
""
"dark dark, hoppyish coffee. swoon."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's a good homebrew recipe that Stone has done justice to. But I would like to see more justice with the kolsch style, because being dark and not from Cologne are two strikes."

"I can't say I'm a huge fan of the dark rye kolsch style of beers, if such a thing exists outside of this one, but it's not a bad outing.  While it's not overly impressive, it's tasty enough.  And while it's not exactly a summer refresher, as far kolsches go, it's not bad on a hot 100-degree summer Texas day if you're hankering for a dark beer.  You could do worse.  The rye suggests it would be better to imbibe in the summer or fall, but whatever.  Good on Stone for trying this one."
"Serving type: bottle"
""
""
"Overall: A very enjoyable, interesting and unusual beer. The taste and texture of the beer will clash with your preconceptions of what a beer that looks like this one should taste and feel like (in a good way). Definitely worth a try if you can find it."
""
""
""
"Overall this beer is really well balanced and enjoyable. I liked it allot more than I thought I would. Hopefully they will re release it at some point."
""
""
"I love the nice toasty notes with hints of chocolate from the black rye. It's not too strong due to the fact that it's a Kölsch style, but it does add hints of spiciness to it. To me it drinks similar to a porter, but a bit more carbonated than a porter. One of my personal favorites."
""
"It is really hard to characterize this beer in any way other than ""good."" It is an incredibly interesting mix of the dark roast maltiness of something like a stout (or more accurately a Schwarzbier since it's a lager) with the slight hop bite of a Kölsch and the mild spiciness from the rye. These characteristics altogether render a very complex and strongly flavorful, yet incredibly drinkable beer that I could easily down pints of in a pub all day, or at least at lunchtime with a ploughman's or sandwich."
""
""
""
"It's dark, it's German-adjacent, and it tires more quickly than I might have initially thought - yup, that's Sprockets for me, from what I can recall. Calling this a Kolsch is sort of disingenuous at best, as all the light, crisp, and easy-drinking qualities of that style are shit all over by this venture - see American Black Ales for precedence."

"O: I like it. It seems a little schizo as far as its style identity, but its an example of pushing the creative envelope, and the guys at Stone definitely make it work."
""
""
""
""
"Aroma is dominated by roasty malts with hints of breadiness and minerals. Lots of roast on the palate with some spicy rye and little smoky char at the finish. Would not have called this a kolsch tasted blind, but this was damn good."

"Poured a rich, opaque black with brown highlights on the edges of the glass when held to light. Two and a half fingers of tan head that grew as it sat and left abundant lacing down the glass. A very nice looking beer, similar in appearance to a stout. Scents of rich roast malt, dark chocolate, coffee with a bit of cream, a bit of a pretzel-like aroma, hints of grassy hops, along with spicy rye in the background. As it sits a little bit of fruitiness comes into the foreground as is common in the Kolsch style. A very nice aroma profile that is an interesting combination of a porter, a rye beer and a Kolsch. Flavor begins with a roasted flavor malt profile, with notes of black coffee and rye. This moves into further roasted flavors with notes of burnt toast, black coffee and roast malt and a hint of fruitiness that is very faint. Finish is dry with roast malt, spicy rye, black coffee and a slight tang with some fruitiness faintly detectable. Aftertaste is dry with a strong roast malt presence and hints of black coffee. An interesting flavor profile that tastes very similar to a porter or stout and is quite removed from a Kolsch. It is quite nice and the addition of rye adds a nice spice and nuttiness to the flavor. Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with moderate-high carbonation and a smooth, creamy feel. Very nice and extremely easy to drink as a result. Overall this is a pretty interesting beer. It has a nice aroma and flavor that are more reminiscent of a porter than a Kolsch, with the nice spiciness that rye imparts. An extremely drinkable mouthfeel aids the beer and makes it quite the sessionable offering. Very well done and unique to boot."
""
"The aftertaste is a nice lingering goodness. I highly recommend this great beer - get it while you can!"
""
""
"Overall easy to drink, and unusual for a Stone brew. Serving temp and glass choice are very important."
""
""

"O: Better than expected. Great rye flavor mixed with light German lager. Pretty unique, and definitely delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Overall this just about works really well. Strong points are the nice rye kick & the drinkability, & I would never hesitate to have another; not only that, I think breweries should abandon the mostly failed ""Black IPA"" & go after the ""Black Rye"" category. I see potential. Good beer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- A delicious and very enjoyable beer. It reminded me at times of a porter or a black lager. I will be buying this again (if there is any left.)"
""
""
""
"stone, you do not have to release every beer that every employee thinks of. Your special beers are starting to stop being special."
""
""

"Overall: A pretty solid twist on the Kolsch style. Good creamy dark malt notes. Its kind of like a porter."

"22 ounce bottle into pint glass; worn off bottle date, but bottled in 4/2014. Pours crystal clear nearly pitch black color with a 1-2 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of chocolate, toast, dark bread, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, spicy rye, light char, herbal, light fruitiness, light grass, and roast/yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt, rye, earthy hop, and light-moderate kolsch yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of chocolate, cocoa, toast, dark bread, coffee, roasted malt, spicy rye, light char, light fruitiness, herbal, grass, and roast/yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy/roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, toast, dark bread, coffee, roasted malt, spicy rye, light char, light fruitiness, grass, and roast/yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice robustness and complexity of dark/roasted malt, rye, earthy hops, and light-moderate yeast ester flavors; with a great roasted malt bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, moderately creamy, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice experimental Kolsch style beer. All around good balance, complexity, and robustness of dark/roasted malt, rye, earthy hops, and light-moderate yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering; it tastes a lot like a robust porter."
""
""
"Overall, this let's me know that creativity and brewing culture in America is alive and well, we will never stop innovating because we have no boundaries in our brewing styles this 5.4% Sprocket beer labeled as a black rye kolsch proves it!"
""
"Overall: a good beer that is light but has some meatier flavors. Interesting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - it tastes good but what the hell is it? Not a Kolsch. I'd drink it again but cannot think of it as a Kolsch."
""
"O: This is definitely an experiment of a beer. It has its good points, but doesn't come off altogether."

"Poured into a standard pint glass, this is an opaque very dark brown with a thin tan head. The nose is very faint: just some lightly toasty black patent scent. Nice taste, but I don't get anything more than dark, lightly roasted malt, maybe with a little toffee. Blind tasting, I'd just call it a stout, and move on. It's not bad, but a ""black rye kolsch""? Sounds gmimicky."
"Overall – A decently charred and toasty tasting brew with a lighter palate and easy drinking feel. A pretty nice kolsh."
""
"O) don't know if this will ever return due to spotlight series status, but if it does it could become my go to beer during its release"
"O - So many great flavors and so drinkable, especially for a heavier beer. I thoroughly enjoyed this."

"Palate is medium to full, slightly creamy, carbonation is lively"
""
""
"I like this beer more than I would consider it authentic. I'm not trying to kill it, overall, but my score is compromised based on execution to style."
""
"This is nothing like a Kölsch, and I don't get why a rather specific historic style should be used as a catch-all category, like American Black Ale, where this would fit with the whacky recipe. But this is so strongly rye flavored, why do we have a Rye Beer category if it's not used for stuff like this? From the 22 oz bottle purchased at Trader Joes."
"Light bodied and easy drinking. Still too much of a stray cat to confer much love."
""
"Black with clear ruby edges and highlights and a short, thick cap of tan/brown foam. Good head retention, lots of sticky lacing. Dark malt aroma, a little burnt and roasted, char with bitter chocolate, faint hop character. Soft on the palate, light bodied with modest carbonation, smooth and a bit dry from the dark grains. Malty with moderate bitterness up front, chocolate and a hint of toffee/hops mid-palate, finishing on the bitter side. Lingering citrus/lemon bitterness. Overall, pretty good. Fairly refreshing, but with some real character from the dark malt."
""
""
"Mouthfeel is light and watery, with almost no carbonation, a light to medium body and general smoky taste that fades with a little bitterness and sweetness the dries up almost clean. Not a Kölsch, but a damn tasty beer that was fairly easy to drink if you are a fan of roasted malts and cocoa. The bottle said to drink this fresh, so I did, and now is ze time on Sprockets vhen ve daance…"
"MF – Medium-light body, dry finish, creaminess in the finish. 4.25"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a deep brown, almost devoid of light. It has a thick creamy tan head that has great retention and lacing. The aroma is distinct dark roasted malt. The taste is mostly schwarzbier with a peppery note from the rye and an earthy hops profile. The mouthfeel is is silky, with a nice weight to the body, but not too heavy. This is a tasty and unique beer."
""
""
"O: A little tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good variation of style, it’s decent beer to drink for a while if you’re looking for something a bit different."
"O - This has a ton of flavor for 5.4%, and is very crushable. The appearance is amazing, the head never completely dissipated for me and always was present. I don't get much of the rye flavor, maybe in some of the sweetness. Great beer all around."

"Pours a solid dark brown bordering on black with faint garnet at the edges and a decent sized tightly bubbled light tan head that persists forever. Aromas of chocolate, earthy hops, light spice and fruit. The flavor follows the aroma quite well. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation. Extremely flavorful easy to drink ale. Reminds me of a cross between a	schwarzbier and a black IPA. I really enjoyed this one."
""
""
""
""
"Works better as a black IPAor hell even a porter than a Kolsch, drinkable enough. Stone is starting to get a little out there, but I like they are still trying to push some boundries. Glad I got to try this, but not really buying the concept of a Black Rye Kolsch..."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a very tasty and sessionable beer. Roasted Rye!"
""
""
""
""
"I can't say that I've had a beer in a bomber go down this easily before and it's been a while since I polished off something that big in such short a time. This reminded me of a Porter in so may ways but it's a testament to Stone that they brewed a Kolsch and had me thinking that it was something else. The carbonation was present enough to make this light, like the idea behind this beer. This was a good-natured beer that was easygoing from start to finish and unlike anything else that I've ever had before. Props to Stone for pushing the edge and giving me a new appreciate for what a Kolsch is capable of being!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This was just a pretty good beer. I was even a bit surprised as I wasn’t expecting much."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Fairly satisfying. Yes, I understand this a tinkered-with, augmented Kolsch, but, I hoped that didn't mean totally tossing out the refreshing spirit of the beer out the window. Thankfully, while there is a little added heft, it remains nicely drinkable -- really, I'm just happy it didn't wander into unrefreshing territory."

" The flavors of a schwarzbier with the feel of a kolsch. Neat!"
""
""
""

""
""

"The beer could use a bit more kolsch quality without so much Stone quality in the back. However, still very flavorful for the ABV and well crafted. I hope to see more offerings like this from Stone."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a tasty brew, but not one I see myself seeking out again. They might have some success marketing this as a dark beer for the summertime, as it's fairly refreshing and sessionable."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall not bad, not very Kolsch like as it's a bit too heavy, but it does bring a little schwarzbier like notes which is lager like and an attempt at a dark kolsch, nice malts with roast, hint of choc and smoke, nice overall though, pretty tasty and quite drinkable."
""
""
"22 ounce bottle, stamped date on the bottle is worn off so I can only tell that it was bottled sometime in 2014. Served in a stange glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is nice, the brew smells like roasted and grainy/rye malt, bittersweet chocolate, coffee and some dark fruit. Taste is similar to the aroma, the brew tastes like roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate, spicy rye, bready/grainy malt, smoke and a bit of dark fruit, nuts and earthiness. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's somewhat dry and has moderate carbonation. This certainly isn't a traditional Kölsch, but I like it! It's a good, easy drinking brew."
"3.5/3.75/3.5/3.5/3.5"
""
"O - An interesting twist, a black rye kolsch. Definitely an A+ for originality. Its very drinkable and tasty."
""
""
"An interesting and enjoyable black ale. The taste combinations are distinctive and pretty well balanced with each other yet a tad subdued as far as the rye component goes. I first had this on tap at a local BBQ joint and wasn't quite as impressed with it, but this particular bottle was worth the second go round. I certainly wouldn't hesitate to have another when a dark ale style like a black IPA or Cascadian dark ale is what I'm craving."
""
"Overall - Decent, much like a waterdown porter with the roasty malts and chocolate. A little light and rather easy on the mouth. Seems like a black rye kolsch is just a fancy title to sell this beer."
"22oz bottle $6.99. I wasn't sure what to think of this being a black kolsch style ale but since it's Stone I will give the benefit of the doubt. Dark black color, looks like a stout. Aroma is nice and malty, chocolate, spice, really not bad at all. Nice flavor, really flavorful dark malts, chocolate and coffee. I didn't pick up too much rye in the flavor but this was a good beer. I don't know how it relates back to things like Sunner or Reissdorf but its good."
""
""
"This one off pours a near black color with a small tan head that quickly gives way to a nice film and lacing. The nose is a very subtle blend of coffee, roasted malt, and sweet European yeast. The mouthfeel is light and refreshing for such a dark beer. It drinks very smooth and easy like a great dark session ale. The flavor is more complex than the nose. There are notes of coffee, noble hops, and smoke intermingled with the sweetness of roasted malts and European yeast. This is a good and easy drinking beer with unexpected complexities. Not my favorite beer or style but very well done."

"A nice session ale that pairs well with pork loin grilled with herbs. The char on the loin works well with the richer, darker notes and the herbs and leanness of the meat compliments the fruit and bread aspects. Given this is a Stone product, it is interesting to not comment heavily on the hop bill!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a very dark brown, almost black color with a gorgeously thick, frothy head. Smooth, pleasant aromas of nutty chocolate, grassy hops, light rye bread, and sweetened coffee with some very light char permeating everything. Malty flavor, dry, nutty, and clean. Bready roast with some tasty fruity spice in the middle, finishing a little bitter. Some citrus and herbs to brighten things up. Light, creamy, and appropriately dry. About what I expected...a well made experimental beer that stays drinkable and doesn't try to be ""extreme"" beyond doing a bit of style blending."
""
""
"Overall, really quite wonderful stuff. This is interesting and unusual, but done with such conviction and integration of flavours that it seems classic."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a very tasty beer, not fantastic but very well done."
"i wasnt sure what to expect from this one. seemed like a bunch of styles mixed together. but the out come is pretty good. the smel has a bit of smoke, with some nuttiness. the color is pretty close to opaque black- you can see a slight copper color held up the light. the taste is nutty- not nearly as strong as you would expect from the color. slightly bitter but surprisingly drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It has basically a black color, but brown hints around the edges. It had a minimal off-white head and no real lacing. Beautiful rye and hoppy scent. A bit of a metallic scent."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Light-medium bodied with a slightly roasted background and hoppy finish. Not heavy, cloying or bitter. Best description is Sublimely Self-Righteous Lite."

""
""
""
""
"like others have voiced, not how I expected it to taste given the style compared to others I've had, but a decent brew. medium on the mouthfeel and overall a decent brew."
""
""
""
"This beer is innovative and a nice take on the style with a new spin. Overall, this beer was extremely drinkable and was clean from start to finish. Not what you'd expect from drinking a Kolsch, but I give it to them for being innovative. Was refreshing to drink a stone beer without the typical stone hop profile that all of there beers seem to have. 4/5. Worth picking up for sure (a little pricey IMHO)."
""
"Pours a black color. 1/2 inch head of a tan color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of roasted malt, sweet malt, dark citrus, slight spice, dry hop, hint of pepper, and hint of rye. This is a well balanced and well blended beer, but I don't believe it fits the category of a Kolsch. Mouth feel is sharp and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of roasted malt, sweet malt, spice, hint of rye, dry hops, and a hint of floral hops. Overall, great appearance, good aroma, body, and blend. No complaints about this beer, except for it being a poor representation of a Kolsch. The low score is due to rating the beer under Kolsch style characteristics."
""
"Poured into a Sester stange. Pours a very dark brown with hints of red at the margins and a three finger light brown head with great retention and heavy lacing. Aroma of bready and toasted malt, spicy rye, hints of chocolate. Really nice rye component to the aroma. Flavor is chocolatey toaste malt with light char, rye fruitiness and spiciness, finishes with nice lightly charred toasted malt, spicy rye and light grassy hops. Light to medium bodied with peppery carbonation. Flavors are quite nice, but somewhat subdued as expected from a kolsch style session beer, but with a surprisingly robust finish. Except that the flavors are toned down, this doesn't fit much with the light kolsch style, perhaps only because no one had thought to put a rich toasted malt and rye in one before. It delivers on it's name, a black rye ale that has been toned down to kolsch sessionability, without losing it's character. Interesting and well done. The first 80 degree day here this year and this is a wonderful accompaniment."
""
"Poured from a bomber into a shaker pint, the beer is a dark, blackish coloring with ruby highlights and a filmy, clingy, low profile, tan head. Aromas of dark roast coffee, subtle chocolate notes, char, toasted grains, and some earthy tones. Flavors are roasted forward, with hints of smoke and char throughout. Solid coffee notes throughout, too, with some chocolate highlights and smooth, toasted backbone. This tips the scales towards the bitter side, with a roasted and smoky aftertaste. Smooth and light in mouth, with a bitter and smoked linger. Interesting brew."
""
"This comes off like a very watered down porter, and it has no Kolsch character that I can discern, so it just comes off as just a light drinkable roasty beer, with an odd hop quality that doesn't match to style. It's clash of flavors and feel just doesn't draw me in, nothing seems to compliment, and while not offensive and easy drinkable this is not a beer I would drink again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Definitely wouldn't call this a kölsch, as it has much more of the black and rye ale characteristics than the kölsch. It's a very well done hybrid of the three styles, though. Definitely easy to drink while providing lots of different and interesting flavors that keep you coming back for more. Surprisingly refreshing as well. Pick some up for a game-changer"
""
"Overall: I get it, there's some kolsch characteristics with a lot of darker, fruit and tobacco accents. It's different and interesting and certainly glad that I gave it a shot. Thanks to Stone as well as Rick and Robbie for a change of pace and a unique brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Fuller bodied than expected with a bit more of a kolsch flavor profile but the prominent dark malt bill, resinous hops and subtle spice make it feel more like an experimental ABA. Strong hop presence with sticky hop oils, earthy pine needle, grass and spruce tip flavor that linger throughout into a bone dry finish. Slightly acrid but the roast isn't as extreme as in the nose. Hints of charcoal, burnt toast, coffee grounds and bittersweet dark chocolate countered by sweeter malt flavors and faint spicy rye. Again, the rye is subtle but it nicely compliments the earthy hop bitterness. Decent balance with low ABV and light mouthfeel make this beer pretty easy to drink. Nothing too out of the ordinary but it's an interesting take on the style."
"Overall: i don't go for stone often but this one sounded very interesting. and i'd say its a pretty good, not great but it does a good job at what it says. i'd prefer the dark malts to aim more at chocolate rather than char and espresso. just a step down from being a great experimental beer."
""
""
""
"O: Interesting Kolsch. Very tasty. Lots of rye and lots of roasted malt character. Especially impressive given the meager strength of this brew. Complex and well balanced. Drinkable. I enjoy all things rye and all things roasted malt so I'm slightly biased. But this was still tasty and I feel that they achieved exactly what they were going for."

"Didn't really sense the Kolsch style with this. But still, quite tasty."

"Pours an almost opaque super dark crimson-brown with a foamy beige head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, rye, herb, and char aromas. Taste is much the same with char, herb, and rye flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is quite roasty and has an interesting herb presence."
"Picked this up on a sale yesterday out of curiosity. Pours much darker than I was expecting (although I was thinking more kolsch than rye going into it), with medium carbonation and foam that quickly dissipates. Nothing much impressed me about this except the idea. No surprising spiciness from the rye, no outstanding trademark kolsch-ness, nothing. Overall seemed pretty bland. Didn't check for a bottling date to closely, may have been old? Either way, won't be having again."
"I love this beer as an ""imperial"": Schwarz bier or as a dry Porter. Those identifiable flavors are alive and well, but I contend, where's the Kolsch component?"
"Pours a dark brown with a tan head. Kind of a malty, almost coffee nose. But, I don't think there is any coffee in this one. Kind of spicy, which I like. Even though it's a somewhat robust flavor profile, it's still easy drinking. I like this. It's a good beer, even though I don't consider it a kolsch; though there are some kolsch aspects to it that I can pick up. Anyways. I like it."
"Overall, this is interesting, but not worth the price ($9.04 for 22oz). It should also not be classified as a kolsch"

"This is a surprisingly good beer. However, it comes across much more as a complex American Rye Black Ale; it is not, in any way, a Kölsch. I intended to hit it for that, but the truth is that, name aside, it's a very tasty beer."

"Opaque in body with misty khaki head. Aroma dark chocolate, ash, earth, coffee beans. Tastes of dark chocolate nibs, coffee, some earth, a little burnt meat and cola aftertaste. Medium bodied with medium carbonation. Interesting flavor profile that shows restraint. Refreshing in a morning coffee way."

"a dark rye kolsch? well this is new to me. soft but pungent too on the rye, not as peppery or as spicy, but the flavor of the grain is still quite prominent. dark coffee colored beer with a brighter carbonation accumulating an inch or so of mocha colored head. almost looks like a nitro tap with the size of these tiny bubbles. roasted barley and chocolate flavors smell strong, but the yeast and the general lightness of this dark brew are also evident. very clearly not a porter or stout. the flavor has all the rye on the front end which i like, and still feels german enough on the grain front for me to accept this as a kolsch. its lightness helps too, barely medium bodied and carbonated extremely well. the feel kind of makes it for me. i like the rye front loaded too, so the finish is still quick. a very flavorful yet approachable beer for anyone looking to try a little something different."

"22oz bottle. Pours an extremely dark brownish black with a 1/2 inch of khaki head. Some lacing. The aroma is earth, chocolate, charcoal, and some slight funk. The taste is a refreshing mix of chocolate, charcoal, floral hops, burnt coffee and some light rye. Chocolate and charcoal towards the finish with some floral hop notes and earth. Mouthfeel is light which surprised me a bit due to the color. Very little alcohol presence. Somewhat nutty as it warms. This is a very interesting beer to say the least. Light and crisp like a Kolsch but there is a fair amount of smoke and chocolate. Almost reminds me of a schwarzbier. Overall, a strange beer but I like it and would buy it again."

"Overall: Super well balanced, and really easy drinking. If this were cheap and in 6 packs I would go through a lot of this. Really impressive."
"A very slight grape like quality with this beer. Big roasted chocolate and coffee notes. Light in flavor. Slight hop character. Overall very easy to drink, and it gets better as it warms. Little lacing and head. A nice sweetness. Slight rye but not big."

"OVERALL: A fine beer, and an interesting one to describe. Sprocket Bier has a lot going on for it. Tastes like an ale drinks like a lager."
"Interesting twist on a session beer but it works very well - i'm on my second bottle as I type this review. Definite summer-time drinker that even Dieter himself would approve of!"

"Pours a translucent very dark brown with billowing head of dense light brown foam. Rings of thick lace on the glass. Smell: floral and slightly spicy with rye graininess, background sweetness and the impression of coffee wafting from across a room. Taste: light sweet fruit flavors upfront, then a blip of roast and toffee, into a big spicy rye thing with a vaguely lemony finish. Light bodied upfront then really explodes...silky feel... far more luxurious than your usual Kolsch. Dry finish. Very tasty. Should have added as a Rye Beer."
