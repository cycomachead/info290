"Nice delicious bright amber beer."
""
""
"Bomber poured into a nonic. This beer is clear, bright amber in color with a thin white head that settles to a ring. Aroma includes pale malt, grass/hay, honey, and corn. Taste is moderately sweet cracker, biscuit, honey, and grass, initially. There is a lightly hop bitterness on the swallow. Light bodied, moderate but assertive carbonation, smooth barely thick texture, dry, crisp finish."

"O- Not my favorite style of beer. I would rather drink this than Bud, but only because it has a cooler label."

"The Calumet Queen is a decent beer. The beer poured a pale yellow with no head and no lace. The scent had a slight lemon flare. The taste was crisp with a lemony finish. The mouthfeel was lighter in body with good carbonation. Overall this beer is decent and probably best drank in the summer."
""
"o - overall, rich in flavor, bold in body...exactly what you'd expect from three floyds. hitting the spot right now."
""
""
""
""
"Beer is medium-light to light in body, with carbonation of medium to medium-high intensity, resulting in a mouthfeel that is somewhat fizzy (1/3), then foamy (2/3): in essence fairly crisp. Closes semi-dry, with moderate stickiness on the palate and lips."
""
""
"The beer is crystal clear and pale yellow with an inch or so of white head. The aroma brings grain, corn, bread, sourdough yeast. A touch of fruity sweetness along with biscuit / grain character. Light bodied with moderate carbonation, finishing dry. Overall, a decent example of the style."

"Poured into tumbler. Pours straw yellow with a small white head. Smell is light, grains, some caramel. Taste is lots of light malt, straw grain, small amount of hop presence, some caramel, sourly dry. Carbonation is nice. Overall this is a refreshing nice representation of the style, very light, small hop bitterness and plenty of dryness from the grain. Glad I got to try it"

"O: A crisp, refreshing kolsch with some nice toasty notes to keep it more interesting then many I've had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A little less than medium bodied, lightish effervescence. Drying, slight warming. Pretty darned good, if you ask me, and if you've read this far, you did."

"O - Coast 32/50 spoils me. Not bad, but I wouldnt lose sleep if I didn't have this again"

"Overall, a solid kolsch, but unremarkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it might be a good beer, but if it is, the style doesn't work for me. It was a hot day and I still didn't care for it. Tastes only slightly different than a run of the mill macro, only with more character. Not something I want again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is enjoyable and easy to drink but is not anything special. I would have preferred if this beer had a little less sweetness and a little more hop bitterness."
""
"O: This beer has interesting flavors of grapes but seemed a little sweet for the style and could use more hop bitterness."

"Taste: Slightly tart/citrus type flavor with a sweetness following up. For the most part this is fairly mild in taste but not bad, just not very complex."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"My first ever Kolsch style! Pours a gorgeous, light, slightly hazy, yellow golden color with a pure white, foamy head. The head has decent retention. An 1/8 inch white cap sits on top of the beer and is perpetuated by carbonation bubbles rising from the bottom. Tart Czech Pilsener nose. A bit of green grape and some unripe banana peel. A pretty surprising mouthfeel given the appearance and the bouquet. One would expect something lighter and crisper. The mouthfeel is full and a bit thick, nearing chewy. Smooth on the finish. Really nice balance in the flavor. Sweetness and tartness work together nicely. Nothing obtrusive. It's a really good beer overall. However, it shouldn't be $7.99 a bomber."

"22 ounce bottle into pint glass; no bottle dating, but purchased recently. Pours lightly hazy golden straw color with a foamy 1-2 finger bright white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of lemon, pear, apple, cracker, bread, honey, grass, floral, herbal, and earthy spiciness. Nice, pleasant, and well balanced aromas with decent strength; on par for the style. Taste of pear, apple, lemon, cracker, bready grain, grass, floral, herbal, and earthy spiciness. Light yeast tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruits, cracker, bready grain, grass, floral, herbal, and earthy spiciness on the finish for a short bit. Very nice balance of flavors; with a typical flavor complexity for the style; and zero cloying flavors on the finish as expected. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and lightly crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Kolsch style! Nice balance of flavors with solid complexity; and extremely smooth and crisp to drink. Very enjoyable offering, and on par with the style as expected."

"O - FFF is my one of my 2-3 favorite breweries and I consider them the worlds best without question. While im not a kolsch fan at all it is a decent style for the summer. An ale with lager like characteristics. Hmm.. Idk.. while Calumet Queen wasn't horrible I can't say it's worthy of being Alpha King's girl friend or anything close to having a relationship for that matter. You are talking big time class in alpha and just so so with calumet. It was cool to get a not always released bottle from FFF and this experience will not stop the fact that I'll buy anything FFF if I see it, but this wasn't good enough for me to want again. But then again I don't think it's 3 Floyds, I think it's just the style. I mean in terms of this German style they hit it out of the park, but the kolsch ball park isn't all that big IMO. Worth a try, but nothing to get your hopes up on. This is one of my least favorite German styles and 3F did well with it.. But this just shows how hard it is to make a really good kolsch. But hey, that's just my tastebuds. I give them credit for doing it well, but how well can one do a kolsch? I doubt any better than Calumet. It shows how good FFF are, but in turn shows me how bad the Kolsch style is."
"O: FFF amazes me around every turn, and for them to turn out a hit from a style that in lesser hands tend to be bland, speaks volumes as to their talents. Now, if they could only do something about their poor attitude."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm not sure how Three Floyds does it, but they've managed to make yet another easy drinking, relatively light lager. Nothing aggressive or insane. This would be a fantastic beer in the dead heat of summer...or ever really. It's good."
""
""
"This is a really nice, lighter offering that is enjoyable and highly drinkable. If I had one complaint it would be the cereal grains. At points they were intense enough that it came close to eating corn flakes. But on the whole it was balanced and well put together. If you like Kolschs you'll like this."
""
""
"O-Not a style I'm a fan off, easily the worst FFF beer I've had. Still decent, would be a nice summer drinker."

"Clearish straw-yellow pour, with a cap of foamy white head that settled to a thin layer of bubbles. Looked Kolschy. Thin aroma, toasted grains, light malt sweetness, grassy hops. Smelled Kolshy. Taste...you guessed it: Kolschy. Toasted grains, light biscuit malt and honey sweetness, light notes of citrus and grass, with a bit of a metallic aftertaste. Pretty crisp and light-bodied, and good overall for the style."
""
""
""
""
"overall this beer is worth a try but noting that special i was a bit dissapointed would not buy again"
""
""
"O: Chalk up another satisfying release to Three Floyds – lots of flavor for a seemingly limited style. I’d enjoy this as a year-round release, especially since nobody seems to be able to put out a nice, flavorful lager."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Sweet, citrus, and light."
""
""
""
""
"Didn't seem fully like a kolsch. Instead it seemed more like a pilsner. Still, it's a solid beer that is easy to drink"
""
""
"Pours a glimmering gold with a two finger bright white head. Light pale malt, grass and flora, accents of apple and pear on the nose. Opens with grassy hops joined by apple peel with a touch of bitterness, a touch of honey, toasted grain, and some light citric notes. Finishes fairly dry and crisp. Light body with bubbly carbonation that tickles the inside of the mouth. Overall, a very solid kolsch."
"O. Refreshing, drinkable, but not incredibly memorable. Would drink again at the right price."
""
"O: Pretty solid flavor profile for a kolsch and it had a little more hop bite than normal which is on par with FFF. It's a little too cold in Chicago now for this guy, but on a hat summer day this would be great. Seasonal summer six packs would be good."
""
""
""
"O: Not the most flavorful kolsch I've had, but it does the job."
"Went down smooth, but really not much to write home about. Kolsch is a style that I don't always crave and when I do there are certainly better ones out there."
""
""
""
"O: Tastes like a Kölsch. A well made Kölsch, but its not exactly the most exciting of beer styles. That said, I do wish FFF would have put this into distribution at the beginning of summer instead of the beginning of fall, but I guess that's FFF for you."
""
""
""
"This poured out as a clear looking yellow color, very nice looking brew with a soapy white head on top. The smell of the beer is grainy and has some sweet corn aromas on the nose. The taste of the beer is very refreshing, it's clean and has some sweet grains and corn-like flavors in there. The mouthfeel is very light bodied with a good carbonation. Overall this beer is quite good for the style. I found it to be really impressive and I wouldn't probably drink it again."
""
"D - Not as musty or grapey as some German examples I've tried, but still pretty authentic as most German offerings are from 3 Floyds.. If you like Kölsch, you'll like this as it's a good American take on the style. Jason and I finished the bomber in roughly 10 minutes, so it's definitely a lawnmower sort of beer."
""
"I don't have a lot of experience with this style and had to review the style guidelines before trying this beer, but it seems to match the description nearly perfectly. I never thought I would say this about a FFF beer, but I would like to taste and smell just a bit more hop character. Other than that, I can't find anything to detract. FFF stayed true to the style here and made a nice traditional Kolsch. That said, it might be fun to see what this brewer could do if they decided to go crazy with this style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Nice beer, easy to drink, very crisp and refreshing. Drank the bomber by myself pretty easily."
""
"O - Nice, well balanced full flavored Kolsch from FFF. Definitely an easy drinking session beer that you could drink throughout the summer"
""
""
""
"Three Floyds continues to demonstrate that they are much more than Dark Lords and Dreadnaughts by branching into, and largely succeeding outside of their comfort zones with Gorch Fock and Calumet Queen. But with its strong malt presence, firm malt-hop balance and minerally undertones, I'm more comfortable with this beer as a Dortmunder Export-style lager despite its yeast or temperature in brewing technique."
""

"Poured into 3 Floyd's pint glass. Appearance is clear gold with a small dense layer of white head. Tons of lacing in this one. Aroma features significant dry grainy notes paired with lemon zest. Notes of wheat come in next with a touch of lemon on the end. Taste is malty up frot with dry bready grainy notes, just like the nose. Lemon and citrus are heavy in the mid palate with a zesty finish. Lots of flavor packed into this with a nice and refreshing balance. Mouthfeel is crisp with high carbonation an light body. Overall, solid take on the style, not bad."
""
""
""
""
"O- This is a pretty good beer. Im not extremely familiar with the Kolsch style quite yet but this one is solid. It feels and tastes like quality. Its simple and light but refreshing and smooth. I prefer their other two lagers I have tried (Jinx and Gorch Fock) but this isn't far off."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: a nice kolsch. Usually not a very exciting style but this one is full flavored and creamy providing both good tasting and a refreshing brew."

"This pours a cloudy and bright gold in color with a white lacing. U smells of a faded Kolsch. Pale malt, light spice, and light funk. Strange from FFF. The taste too of light almost pilsner esque malts and light citrus. It sounds alright but for this one its weak. It drinks light in body and doesn't feature all that much flavor. I consider it weak for the style. It's ok, just ok. I expect better from the guys who make a great dortmunder lager in Jinx Proof."
"Clean flavor, simple combo of apple, grape, and husky graininess. Light to medium feel, with seemingly lower carbonation. Very light malt flavor, sort of ho-hum. Finishes somewhat dry, but not as crisp as better examples of the style. It was ok, glad I tried it and easily finished it. Not sure if it would hold the attention of beer geeks for long, but it appeals to the broader customer base at the brewpub."
"Overall-- I tend to enjoy a good Kolsch on a hot day, and while this certainly meets the requirement for a refreshing drink, it doesn't wow me. I'd actually prefer a Krankshaft Kolsch by Metropolitan Brewing... But this is certainly worth trying and enjoyable in its own right."
"Pretty light in flavor overall, easy to drink a few."
"O: In Calumet Queen, Three Floyds aimed to brew a ""crisp and refreshing lighter summer offering"" and hit the target.  In addition, I find the vinous maltiness enchanting.  "
"D- This is a perfect summertime drinker. I would sip on this while I mowed the lawn or just having a good conversation with friends. Good beer to give to someone who is not into craft beers."
"I had this on tap at DLD 2009. Kolsch style doesn't get much respect but I enjoy its subtlety and I've wanted to try this one for a while. It was served in about a 12oz plastic cup. The beer was a little murky, bright orange color, thin white foam. The smell is classic, light and malty, a little fruity funk like Fruh or Reissdorf. Same with the taste, addictive and sweet, very mild, easy to drink a lot of. I would definitely buy a lot of this if it was available in bottles, a great summer deck beer."
"D= Damn drinkable and easily sessionable. A good one to have with food or to just kick back with."
"I had two pints of this at the pub but I could have easily had about six of them. Very good example of a Kolsch, I wish they had this one more often."
"This is a crisp, big-bodied and full-flavored beer that is also immensely refreshing and quaffable."
"D: They could bottle this as a summer seasonal and sell a lot of it. Very refreshing and highly drinkable."
"Calumet Queen is not one of the beers responsible for Three Floyds's much deserved reputation as one of the best breweries in the world. That doesn't mean, however, that it isn't worth a purchase. I had my doubts about buying an entire growler, but I'm now glad that I did. It may not be a typical Kolsch and it may not occupy the same lofty perch as Dreadnaught, Dark Lord and Gumballhead, but it's still a delicious beer that will go well with the cookout that I'll be heading for in a few minutes."
"Had this on tap this weekend at the brew pub. Orange and turbid. small head gone very fast. Mild odor, slightly spicy, some hops evident. Very diluted, watery tasting beer, like a tripel diluted 1:8. Some spice, not much else. My least favorite 3F so far."
"D- The hops are not that interesting and they hang on the tongue after each sip overpowering the malt. This is a tough style to pull off and I'm afraid they didn't do it."
"Draft poured by Nick Floyd. Can this be? A 3F thats not that great??! Well, maybe the tap was off because I tasted nothing that matched the style description or other reviews. I got a big off-flavor of raw grain. Mild citrus hop could not make up for it. I will have to re-sample sometime."
"Clear gold / straw color, with a thin head... leaves some lace on the glass. Aroma is slightly grainy, with a fairly strong herbal character... a lot of noble hops in there. Flavor begins cracker-like, the becomes herbal, spicy, and finally bitter. It's very heavily hopped... more than I'd normally expect for a Kölsch... then again, this is Three Floyds... ""It's not normal."" With a crisp taste, and light body... it's quite refreshing."
"Sampled on tap at the brewery and after from the growler I bought!"
"This beer was a light gold color and a little cloudy. It had a small white head that left trace lace.  An aroma of hops and slightly herbal/grainey.  A flavor of hops and grain.  The finish and body was light but a touch astrigent.  I am not really a fan of this stye, but not a bad beer.  A bit odd to pick this time of the year to put in on tap though."
"Pale golden and slightly hazy, nice white head.  Herbal aroma, with a bit of the 'new mown hay' smell, but not strong.  Taste is clean and crisp.  Fairly spicy, but not overwhelming.  Really seemed like a beer truer to the style than I've come to expect from Three Floyd's (""They're not normal!"").  Still, a good brew.  Light flavor and low abv make this a solid beer for the summertime."
