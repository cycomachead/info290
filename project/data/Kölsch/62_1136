2.5,-30.9,3,3,2,3,2.5,"Cracking into this box of Maine-y goodness from Paul. This one pours a clear golden amber topped by a half-finger of white foam. The nose comprises wheat, light toffee, and flowers. The taste is similar, though the toffee has morphed into burnt caramel and there is a strong sense of orange-peel bitterness in the background, lighting the sky so brightly the moon is no longer visible on this lovely evening. Ugh, this things hurts a bit, as the bitterness remains long after the liquid has settled down my throat. The body is a light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a dry-ish, lasting finish. Overall, a major disappointment, especially considering I was expecting either a kolsch (as the site lists this thing) or some sort of blonde ale or something. I got neither. The strong, strange bitterness keeps the drinkability way down, as I do not want to drink much more of this any time soon.","TMoney2591","Oct 18, 2010"

Maine is well known for its micro-breweries, and Geary's is a well known brewer that produces some quality stuff. Its summer ale is no exception to this quality. Unlike many summer ales, Gearys Summer Ale is inundated witha full bodied flavor, with just a touch of sweetness on the aftertaste tha makes it a summer ale. It isn't loaded down with lemon zest that makes it toooo sweet. It's a dark ale with subtle sweetness, not overwhelming but just enough flavor to enhance its drinkability. Along with its excellent taste, it has an extraordinary appearance, dark amber with a nice frothy head. I highly recommend this sensational Maine brew.","Snazzinator7290","Aug 22, 2010"

The beer is a clear amber I usually like amber/red beers, so this color is promising for me. There is very little aroma to this beer, just some floral scents and a bit of summer spice. The beer tastes of sweet malts and butterscotch. The mouthfeel is slightly syrupy, which I attribute to the sweetness. It fishes dry with no aftertastes. Its as if you didn't even drink it! I think the beers plays that to it's advantage. This is a simple beer good for a summer day. You wouldn't get this beer to impress your friends at a fancy bar, but you would certainly make them happy if you pulled out a six pack of it at your next barbecue. Geary's summer has it's place, and within that context, it excels; I haven't had all the other Portland, ME summer ales yet this season, but in years past, Geary's always out-shines its competitors.","ToasterChef","May 11, 2009"

There's a little popcorn malt going on, lightly citrus hopped. Pretty drinkable with fine carbonation.

This is a well balanced beer in total, but the hops really don't come out until the finish. The body of the beer is overpowered by the sweet malts and the butterscotch yeastiness.

Not too light so that it's bland, but it has a decent amount of hops to add some flavor. The hop profile is just enough to make it stand out but it doesn't overpower the beer.

Toothy grain and sweet malts shine through. An elucidating cranberry honey flows out behind. Light but complex and highly enticing. Pour is a crystal clear deep golden, with a fuming wall of percolating whale carbonation. Head is a rocky foam of crisp white. Flavor is a rich full sweet clean grain malt, with heavy honey, light malt vinegar and flowing apple and lemon juice. Crisp biting wheat edges and toasted almonds. So much flavor in something so pale. Body is full and the mouthfeel is satiating. It ends in a dryly smacking roundabout of pear skins and light figs.

3.3,-8.8,3,3,3.5,3,3.5,"This, and Gumballhead, are a couple of summer ales that I'm finally going to review after my tastings in July, didn't produce results that I felt comfortable posting. When I tried Geary's summer ale in July, I thought it was a Belgian style golden ale. After checking their website, I'm convinced that it is, indeed, based on a Kolsch. This one pours a crystal clear, burnished orange body with very little head and no lacing. Aroma is subdued, with some sweetish caramel and pale malt, floral hops, and a hint of vague tropical fruits. Mouthfeel is actively carbonated, with a light to medium body. Taste has biscuity malt, buttery yeast(Ringwood?), and a bitter, hop character. Tettnang and Saaz hops are used, and produce some floral notes, but very little of the fruitiness that I noted three months ago. The finish is bitter, but clean. I'm convinced, now, that this is not Belgian inspired, but it's an odd rendition of a Kolsch. Actually, I liked this better three months ago when it seemed to have more of a yeast presence along with some Belgian inspired, tropical fruitiness. This one was difficult to review on both occasions, but it's drinkable, just not a favorite.","merlin48","Oct 21, 2004"
3.11,-14.1,3.5,2.5,3.5,4,2.5,"Drinkability - it's got some nice parts to it, but it comes across as a bitterized Belgian, not the best combination, at least according to my palate. With so many flavor aspects, this would be an interesting beer to pair up with different foods to draw out the different tastes.","brewdlyhooked13","Aug 25, 2004"
3.65,0.8,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Nice dark copper color with a decent head. This offering had a malty, fruity and hopy aroma...very nice. Taste was sweet and fruity, with a light ending hop presence.

2.91,-19.6,3.5,2.5,3,3,3,"This poured an absolutely lucid orangey gold color. Low to no carbonation. Thin head dissolved away quickly. The aroma has a somewhat muddled fruity graininess and something like port wine. The taste is lemony and winey. Pungent fruits, tangy and bittersweet that carries through into the finish. On the whole, this is a unique and strange tasting beer. Bitter citrus, sweet and winey aftertaste. Floral and perumey. I enjoy Kolschbier, but this example isnt entirely my cup o tea.","pezoids","Aug 04, 2004"
3.63,0.3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Taste is grassy and fruity. Bitter, crisp malt followed by light hoppy flavors. Very crisp and clean. Very light, nothing very complex about this ale. But it is pretty tasty and a cut above most summer beers. A decent attempt at a kolsch.","ViveLaChouffe","Jul 08, 2004"
3.28,-9.4,4,3.5,3,4,3,"The website says this is a Kolsch but the description on the site reads differently. The flavor is similar to an overhopped Kolsch, more of a golden ale. The beer is not very refreshing due to the harshness in the hop bittering and flavors.","GCBrewingCo","Jun 20, 2004"
3.33,-8,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Pours a pale hazy stream resulting in surpring little head and even less retention and lacing. The malty butter caramel flavor was quick to notice as was the alcohol punch.

3.5,-3.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Solid, light cream colored head. Clear golden colored beer with streams of carbonation. Light caramel malt flavor, a bit of butterscotch, and a mildly bitter finish. Floral hop and caramel malt aroma. Light bodied, not the smoothest going down. Butterscotch flavor cuts down on the summer drinkability, but overall a decent beer.","HappyHourHero","Jun 17, 2004"
3.77,4.1,3,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Chill haze pale gold color, somewhat getting close to an amber hue, but not nearly enough. A waffer thin white cap adorns the top quickly disappearing to leave a very thin collar and very little lacing sticks. Aroma is mild and a bit subdued of a sweet bready maltyness and butter with a small hint of grassy hops. Taste is good, a bit sharp of hop spice and carbonation upon first notice. Surrounding it quickly is a nice buttery and dulled fruit maltyness. Malts seem to have the leg up on this one. A bit bready and chewy around the corners, yet keeps a little zip of yeast grab and hop spice right in the middle of the palate. Feel is about medium bodied, chewy and buttery with a certain carbonation hold, but there's a short bit of emptyness just before the finish. Malts keep it interesting and the front and middle is solid. Sweet, with a certain sharpness and crispness quality to it. A very unique amber, more fruity, then toasty, nearly maibock in likeness really. Thanks to Jason for the bottle!","tavernjef","Jun 17, 2004"

4.19,15.7,3.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Emeril beer. Kicks the concept of "summer ale" up a notch. Richer color -- a darker, tarnished coppery gold brew -- than most summer ales, I think. Deeper aromas. A thick, doughy, cookie-like malt backbone is smothered in floral and fruit aromas -- apple with a citric, piney twist. Lovely sweet malt flavors. Great big balance -- strong hop finish that brings its own level of herbs, fruit, and bitterness. Not your standard summer ale -- perhaps *should* be a standard BBQ summer ale.","marburg","Nov 18, 2003"

Taste is very good, with some wheat presence and a nice, slight hop taste. The swallow is where this beer shines as it begs for another sip or gulp, even. I am glad this is being distributed in Michigan. It offers up a wonderful alternative to Bell's Oberon and Arcadia's Whitsun.","proc","Aug 29, 2003"
4.3,18.8,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Their label artwork aside (but you got to check it out anyway--it's very cool that they support the budding artists in Maine) Geary's has always put a great product in their bottles, and the summer ale is among their best--the Hampshire Special is a winner too. It pours a deep amber, and the smell is of light, tangy citrus with an undercurrent of hoppiness. The taste does not disappoint--it is bright, wheaty, and happy (and hoppy); perfect for a summer night on the lakeshore here in interior downeast Maine. I'm having another. If only the Red Sox could produce such a consistent winner.","longpondbeerman","Aug 01, 2003"
4.3,18.8,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Geary's, the premier east coast revivalist, best beer in my opinion is not the HSA, but their summer ale. This is not only for the cool art, but for the incredible drinkability and taste of this brew. It pours a clear orange with a small white head. The smell is fruity with hints of peach and mild hoppy bitterness and notes of a summer wheat field that has been in the sun all day. The taste is crisp as a summer should be, proudly displaying the rather high ABV for a summer ale with mellow fruity esters, oak and vanilla, sharp hop bite and a wheaty dry finish. Perfectly carbonated for that summer feel as well. Get as much of this as possible for the summer haze.","GreatPondBrewer","Jul 30, 2003"
3.72,2.8,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Taste: Starts citrusy, even juicy in its lusciousness. This is a succulent beer. The hops and the yeast dry things out in the end, maybe a little too much. Wonderful summer sipper, but I could really do without the ringwood aftertaste.","rabidawg","Jul 22, 2003"
3.78,4.4,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"The Summer Ale poured nicely, a light copper color with a nice head that disappeared to the rim of the glass rather quickly. Not as light and refreshing as expected in a Summer Ale, it is full of flavor and a very slight citrus flavor emerges on the tongue after swallowing. This would be very drinkable on a spring or fall day in the sun or during a poker game, but this would not land in the top 5 of my summer ale list in battling the heat and looking for a great thirst quencher. That is why I marked drinkability at a 3.5.","Gavage","Jul 18, 2003"
3.88,7.2,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours a crystal clear deep-amber body topped by a short head of creamy ivory foam. The head holds well, maintaining a thin lid throughout most of the glass, and even leaves some nice lace along the way. The nose is buttery and lightly fruity above some mild, spicy hops. It's fine, slightly elevated carbonation leaves it initially crisp in the mouth; but it's medium and dextrinous body soon rounds it out. Buttery diacetyl remains in the flavor alongside some nice fruitiness (white grape, apple, light strawberry) over a lightly toasted malt base. Its well-balanced with a firm bitterness that leads into a long-lingering dry finish where a quick flash of fruit returns but is quickly replaced by a rising bitterness, some residual biscuity malt, and a light coating of spicy hop flavor. Buttery, fruity, malty, and full-flavored with a very long finish. Satisfying!","NeroFiddled","Jul 01, 2003"

The artist gets a prize and we get this outstanding beer. More taste than most summer brews, this one does not need any citris condiment. Full bodied, yet somehow light, it goes great with the foods of the season. I look forward to its appearence every year.","bewareOFpenguin","Oct 02, 2002"

If you look close enough you see a little guy swimming in the lake. Is that JohnnyP ? It might be........Thanks for beer JP.

This is not your typical summer beer. But it is a summer beer if you've been drinking Hampshire Special Ale for the last six months. I'm glad it's a seasonal, because otherwise it might not find its way to Jersey. No apparent wheat or lemon here, but a fine ale, any time of year.","RonfromJersey","Jul 21, 2002"

That sweetness is all over your mouth at first with flavors of honey and light vanilla, but thankfully hops become apparent going into the finish, partially saving this beer from complete malt domination. It's still a good bit sweeter than I want in a summer brew; "refreshing" is not a word that comes to mind with respect to this beer.","doerickson","Jul 17, 2002"
3.52,-2.8,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3,"Good light copper color with a decent head shows promise.  Smell is slightly sweet from the strong malt of this brew but also has some nice floral hop qualities to it.  Strong malty taste and a promise of some good hops that never quite comes through.  The slight lack of malts leaves this beer a little unbalanced and feeling slightly unfinished.  Somewhat sticky and cloying mouthfeel that takes a few points off the drinkability of this brew.  In my opinion one of the biggest aspects to a summer beer is the drinkability and this brew seems to be a little lacking in that department.  Definitely the weakest offering I have had from Geary's.  All that said this still isn't a bad brew just not nearly as good as I was hoping for.  Thanks to Bierman9 for the sample.","Murph","Jul 08, 2002"

Dark, dark gold, bordering on copper color, with full head that reduces but doesn't vanish. Some hints of the Geary's classic Pale, with lighter elements of lemon, wheat, and grass. Still a pretty thick beer with robust caramel malts and a spicy, lingering hop finish that recollects the buttery malts as well. Not too refined, a bit raw, but that's what makes it interesting. Great warm, but also delicious icy cold. The perfect brew for snatching out of a chest of ice and enjoying as it rapidly warms in the summer sun.","Thrasher","Jun 28, 2002"
