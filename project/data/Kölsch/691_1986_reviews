"I'm not sure if naming your kolsch ""Chaser"" is a genius attempt to lower expectations or not, but I liked this beer."

"O: Sometimes beer is best remembered in the environment in which you are drinking it. In this case, I was in my parents house (who my wife and I were visiting on vacation) and enjoyed their company... accompanying a local beer."
"A kolsch style beer that I kinda like, I think it's the bitterness and dryness coming through that sells this beer for me, I like me them hops."

"A very nice Kolsch!"
"Overall kinda meh, the malts aren't bad but not perfect for the style, and the hops are a completely different world, not close to what I expected for the style, more destined for a British Pale, and they come through too much IMO."

"O- A middle of the road kolsch that is what the style should be: easy drinking, with a interesting but light flavor. Unfortunately, the promise of the aroma got muddled in the flavor."
"Overall this isn't my favorite Blackstone beer, but makes for a good thirst quencher on a hot day."
"Overall: A highly drinkable and quite enjoyable Kolsch that shows nice balance between malt and fruity sweetness."
"It's a decent kolsch and went down easy in the Tennessee heat."

"Light texture in the mouthfeel and a clean finish. Very good overall for the style. Would be a solid session beer or summer regular."
"O- Not a bad beer at all, esp. considering the price. Also nice is that it is local, and an easy tailgating/session beer, or something that can be introductory for the non-craft drinkers."
"A prper summer quencher I was glad to try."
"O: Chaser Pale certainly isn't my favorite offering from Blackstone, but it's not bad. I could see myself drinking a few these on a hot summer day...would make a very good lawn mower beer."
"Very average beer. Golden colored with nice clarity, medium white head that retains well and leaves nice lace. The smell is of pale malts with a hint of fruity hops. The taste is bright, with fruity hints of citrus on top of pale malt. Quite watery, but crisp and refreshing. Easy to drink, just nothing to write home about."
"Had this as one of the samplers, standard clear-golden color with small amounts of fizz rising from the bottom of the glass. The smell is underwhelming, bits of pale malt is about all I get from this one. The taste is similar with a touch of fruitiness that helps the beer's character. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a nice, creamy carbonation. Overall a ddrinkable beer, not bad at all but not memorable either."
"On-tap as a part of the sampler. Not a bad beer here for the style, though I'm not a huge fan of the style, I guess. A nice yellow color with some bone-white head that leaves a bit of lacing. Smell is largely of pale malts, making me think macro, though I know it's of much better quality. Taste kind of follows suit--light malts with a bit of lemon and citrus splash. MF is light-bodied, well-carbonated. Refreshing. Good lawnmower beer, though not something I'd go to the pub for."
"Good brewery making another good beer."
"Notes from 11/7/06"
"Drinkability: very dull and medicore at best on the drinkability scale. After drinking 1/2 the pint I lost interest. Good beer for a typical macro fan."
"Overall, this isn't the best example of a Kolsch I've ever had. The finish and the metallic twang is somewhat bothersome. I just wish it was a bit more rounded and hoppy."
"Pours a hazy pale golden amber color with a small white head that quickly vanishes into a trace amount of lace. Nose has some lightly sweet fruitiness with a bit of apple as well as a clean maltiness. Taste is sweet malt, mild caramel, and a hint of fresh pear up front following by a fruity hoppiness. Would make for a very nice summertime beer. Thanks to coldchill for the sample!"
"Sounded pretty good upon ordering. Not sure I was expecting a Kolsch. No matter, I did like the beer, though it's pretty bold for the style. A little more malty than expected with a pronounced caramel, apple, pear flavor that expanded the brew quite a bit. The hops were also bold with a light spicy, citrus character. Not enough to change the beer to a new style, but certainly daring for a Kolsch. Reminds me a lot of Summit's Extra Pale."
"I'm not sure whether I was just in need of a lighter beer at the time I sampled this one at a local beer fest or what, but man was it good. A: Light gold with a nice thick head and moderate laicng. S: Graininess predominately with a fair amount of corn aroma T: Light crisp and refreshing with grain and malts trumping any hop flavors. M: Thin but appropriate D: Extremely drinkable and a good choice for any session that would occur in warmer weather."
"Very drinkable, this one! Thanks to BA Potsie for the bopple!"
"I could toss back these with gusto, especially in weather like this...though, I'd get a hankering for something heartier. Just how I am."
"Bright gold in colour with medium carbonation. ThereÂ’s bit of citrus fruit and light wheat maltiness on the nose. The flavors are somewhat cream ale like, with some slightly sweet honey malt notes. The body is relatively light, and it makes for a very drinkable brew. A decent enough summer sipper."
"Overall, very drinkable, and quite enjoyable. Very glad to have tried this one. It's hard to make a good Kolsh, and Blackstone seems to have succeeded."
"Pours with a light gold color and a nice white head that dissipates rather quickly. Intensely fresh aroma with a good burst of hop flavor up front, malt dominates the middle and finish. A modest but refreshing beer. Probably very good with food but rather boring by itself. A good transition beer to win converts to more flavorful beers."
"OG = 1.047, IBU = 18. Kolsch style. Pours a light golden color with a small head that doesn't stick around long and doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. Very clear. The aroma is mild, but there is a trace of malt in there, possibly some noble hops. Flavor was slightly malty with hints of the hops. Crisp and clean. Light body, easy to drink."
"On-tap at the 2004 Brewer's Jam in Knoxville TN, which this brewery has attended since the first event I think. The color is golden, with some slight head, probably hindered by the serving conditions. The aroma features euro-maltiness and a hint of saaz hops, spicy and minty. The beer features a crisp finish, nicely bittered, with great malt flavors that are subtle but very complimentary for the hop notes. The hop flavor is nice and strong without being overbearing. I haven't had a ""real Kolsch"" from Cologne but this has got to be pretty darn close. Great!"
"A pretty darn good impression of a Kolsch Beer."
"From a sampler: Pours a clear gold color with a thin white head. Barely-there hops aroma. Mild and smooth, like most beers of the style. Not particularly impressive, as the hops flavor is elusive. Finish is a little watery. Maybe good on a hot day but otherwise not really worth it."
"A pretty good take on the Kolsch style.  Very light and laid-back, with moderate hops bittering and not a lot of malt presence.  Easy drinking, but not particularly memorable."
