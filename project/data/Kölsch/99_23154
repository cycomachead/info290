One reviewer below called it boring and that underscores the lack of much distinctive taste. Better than most mainstream lagers though, a good warm weather refresher if you like something with a bit more presence than most pilseners or light lagers. However you may find other kolsches with more fruit tones than this one.","scotorum","Jun 14, 2014"

Underlying Euro flairs lean toward Germany, but get lost in the fray of cheapness. The intent is decent, I suppose, but there's no real punch other than a burst of crisp bubble and light bitterness in the forefront. All of that gets pushed aside with a half-toasted grainy middle and finishing with stints of sweet wort, fusel, and nut flesh. At least it's light-bodied and somewhat refreshing. Easy, maybe.

Flavors are bitter initially, with a sharpness from the light body and carbonation levels. Buttery tones once again, with a watery palate and feel at the end of each drink. Watery and muddled aftertaste, with a limp finish that has a kiss of hops that just can't right the ship.","GarthDanielson","Jun 11, 2013"

Nose had a grainy, grassy quality, like a field of hay. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was dry, slightly biscuity and very grassy. Finish was semi-dry with the malt and hops working well in tandem to create a very quaffable beer. Lacing was quite evident as I drank through the glass.

Crisp, slightly spicy hops that provides some subtle earthy and dry bitterness that lingers over the sweeter notes and pale malt. More floral than bitter with a slight earthy/soily character that is countered by an odd adjunct like sweetness. There hints of apple and pear but also a strange corn flavor that is pretty unpleasant. It starts off alright but the lingering aftertaste is pretty bad.","corby112","Jun 21, 2012"

Modest hoppingâ€”thatâ€™s all this brew really needed, though there is no real depth of flavor from the bitterness. Grain becomes almost a bit chalky in the bone-dry finish.

That great nose seems to be a tease as the flavor comes through kind of dull and flat. The finish is pretty nondescript and you can't really pull anything out about this beer other than the nose.

It does have a vinous character, very watery, light bodied, moderately carbonated, ultra clean and purified.

Then a clean drop off, of the nature that many adjunct lagers tell you to expect, that transitions into a dryness as the beer exits the palate.

3.58,11.9,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"A clear golden beer with a frothy white 2-finger head. Streams of bubbles rising from the bottom and some lacing produced. The aromas detected were hoppy and similar to wet straw or hay. I found the flavor to be slightly bitter and hoppy at first, but with hints of malting in the finish. Mouthfeel was light and refreshing. I am not sure of what to think of this beer. Perhaps I lack an appreciation for this style, but it was all right brew.","tomthumbsblues","May 02, 2005"
3.51,9.7,4,3,3.5,3.5,4,"I am sampling a chilled 12 oz bottle in a pint glass. The beer pours a bright clear gold color and a bleached white fluffy head of 2 cm foams up easily. Aroma is mild but I detect some grainy malt a very tiny hit of lemon and grassy and spicy hops. The first sip reveals an average bodied beer with small and tingly carbonation. Flavor is slightly sugary sweet up front with some lemon as well. The flavor quickly moves to a spicy peppery hop finish that dries my tongue. I also get a sweet sticky film on my lips. The beer is crisp and refreshing. Would be great on a hot day!","sulldaddy","Apr 30, 2005"

3,-6.3,3,3,3,3,3,"From their Beers of Summer sampler. Pours a bit deeper golden than your standard macro. Not much in the nose, some sweet malts and grains. Flavor is slightly malty, again the sweet side kind of taking over here...in serious need of some hop bitterness for both balance and flavor. Kind of fruity in the finish, with notes of cherry and apple. Light, bubbly carbonation. I guess this would be one of those ""transitional beers"" to get your macro drinking buddies to try. I'm pretty sure this is beefed up UCL.","IrishRedRock","Apr 21, 2005"

4,25,4,4,4,4,4,"The beer pours a gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice pale malt scent that is a bit grainy and dry, but also is bitter with hop aroma. The taste is good. It has a clean and crisp pale malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes dry and bitter. This has more malt flavor than most Kolsch beers I've had, but hey I'm not crying. The mouthfeel is good. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a good beer. I'm not sure how true to style it is, but it drinks well.","WesWes","Apr 14, 2005"
