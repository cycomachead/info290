"O: A little tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, it’s a decent beer but there are options within the style."

"09/02/13 On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. Not as light as I know Kolschs to be, but worth a try."

"O: decent but unexceptional light pale ale."

"O: This beer is easy to drink but seems like it could use a lot more in the way of bitterness and dryness to be representative of the style."

"Overall: Not bad really. I could see this as a fast-drinking beer for some, and a transition beer for those stuck on mainstream beers. There's some good stuff in there, but not a lot that would push someone new to the game away. They market it as a good summer lager/ale, and it does cool you down easily because of the easy drinkability. Good."

"Pours a clear golden orange with a foamy bone head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and slight grassy aromas. Taste is much the same with grain and grassy flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an average beer that is drinkable but there is nothing too exciting going on here."

"One of my all-time favorite beers. I may be going against the grain with this review, but to me, this is what a refreshing beer should taste like. Good flavors, but not overpowering. The old man and I threw back a few at Pyramid's tap house before going to watch TDKR. VERY good decision."

"O: A fairly decent blonde ale, but it languishes on the shelves. This is their summer seasonal, and cases are still being sent to stores in our market. What gives? The freshness date is not decipherable, but I know this stuff is pretty old. It shows in the appearance, smell, and taste. And who's going to buy a middling blonde ale at an $11 six pack price? Pyramid needs to take a look at how their accounts are being handled out here, and consider pulling out of this market."

"O: Overall a curveball, if you consider this wide left of its intended style. Another boring beer from pyramid that you can easily see coming like a softpitch lob rather curve. Very generic, bland and becomes insignificant half way through. pass"
""
"Pyramid Curve Ball Blonde Ale is a very sparkling, golden ale with no head and a turbulent surface. It has a bright, lemony aroma with light grain, maybe wheat. It's light bodied and crisp. It leaves my mouth feeling like I just ate an apple. It's lightly flavored with a grassy bitterness at the finish. There seems to be a very light sweetness throughout. There are hints of lemon, apple and pear. This was a good choice after mowing the lawn."

"O: not bad, sessionable and refreshing. Not all that complex but I don't think it is trying to be."
""
"O- Too bad. Not a good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: The term 'Blonde Ale' is usually not met with much excitement. The same is true with Pyramid's Curve Ball. It would probably taste the best on a beach somewhere with the sun beating down on the drinker. It is an average beer, nothing bad about it, but also nothing incredibly good."

"nice beer that goes down easy. Goes best with a warm summer day or BBQ."
""
"Overall, a fine lawnmower beer but I see no reason to drink this again if there's something else on the beer list I haven't tried."
""
""
""
"D - Very drinkable. Crisp and refreshing. The balance is a touch off and it is a bit thin but overall pretty good."
""
""
""

"O: Not an awesome beer. Seems more like Kolsch lite than anything else. Still, it is a step above the BMC crew and is light and refreshing for the summer. Pyramid Apricot was one of the first craft beers I got into, so I'll always have a soft spot for em."
"Wanted to give it a little bump in the score for having a baseball related name, but overall, the beer isn't anything I'd pay much more than $1 per 12oz. at a store."
"The score given is based on the style, for an American Kolsch, it aint bad."
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall better than I had anticipated. Would really like this on a warm summer day, just not sure if this beer would like being in the heat. Drink it cold."
""
""
"Pours out a paler semi-hazy straw color than most other Kolsches I have had. Has a flash head that disappears in a minute without lacing despite a somewhat aggressive pouring. Smells of light citrus peel, pale malt, and a small amount of something metallic. Thankfully the metal does not show up in the flavor. Rather, I get a nice combination of herbal / spice hopping with a dash of lemon peel and pale malt in the flavor, texture and carbonation are on the medium scale of things, finish is only semi-dry but lingers for a good long while."

"O - Picked this one up because it was on sale. Being that it was priced the same as all the other macro brews not bad. Would easiy pick this one over a Bud light."
"O- Better than I expected. A decent balance with some nice citrus flavors."
"Give it a shot. You will enjoy."
"Poured from a 12-oz. bottle into a pilsner glass. Looks light gold with a clean feel, maybe a ¼-inch head. Smells just like a Kolsch beer and a little bit heavy and skunky. Also tasted similar to a Kolsch. Heavy on the carbonation with a weird aftertaste. Maybe copper? Tastes fresh and clean, would be great on a hot summer day or after a good workout. Kolsch styles are hit and miss for me and I’d say this might actually have been right in the middle. Probably wouldn’t have it a second time, though."
"This beer was somewhat disappointing to me. Very bland and flavorless throughout. I was really hoping for a Belgian style blonde but lacked most of those characteristics. Watery, and lacking in most all flavor catagories. Its been a few years since I've had a Pyramid beer, which I remember being good, but now I'm not sure I want to sample others from them."
"This beer is OK, but too much like mass market beers I can get for much less. I had hoped for a bit more."
" O : This beer is a craft beer entry level stater for sure . A nice change from a hoppy ipa or a stout. On a hot day watching baseball ... GREAT !"
"Drink- This was just did not taste good to me. Very bland and much too malty without a balance behind the other flavors."
"D: An OK, drinkable beer, but not particularly memorable."
"O: It's a big commercial brew. Probably very profitable for them. But, not all that great."
"22 oz. Bottle. (4.0 / 5.0) Foamy lacy rocky dissapating frothy white head. Clear pretty bright yellow gold color. Buttery delicate floral hop front. Mild sweet refreshing delicate butter caramel mild fruit crisp clean smooth Blonde Ale body. Clean refreshing mild hop balanced easy end. Well made flavorful Blonde Ale. Sampled 3/13/2011. Purchased for $2.47 at Fred Meyer--Ballard, Seattle on 3/12/2011."
"Pours a nice orange color, sunny in complection with a nice head but it fades away pretty quick. Smells mostly fruity, some orange or citrus but only very slight. Tastes fresh and clean with some floral and fruit notes but again, its rather slight. Somewhat creamy mouthfeel but thins quickly and goes down very smooth. Good choice on a hot day out on the river."
"This one will work as a decent hot-weather beer; but compare it to its German counterparts, and it doesn't come close at all. Why not just label this as an American Blonde Ale or Extra Pale Ale--or was it that ""Curve Ball Kölsch"" just sounds good? Let the debate begin. For a pairing, throw this one at some warm pub pretzels."
"A decent summer seasonal, though nothing really stands out about it."
"Pours pale golden with a very, very slight haze. Nose is dominated by herbal notes and some mushroomy notes. Palate has plenty of that herbal hop zing, with a hint of metallic fling. Light cereal malt in the background, but overall it is very herbal tasting."
"Not exactly a dry, crisp Kolsch. For a blonde ale, it's ok, though the flavour wanes quickly, and it's mellow to start off with. Having had the Crystal Wheat Ale right before this, had I not seen the different bottles, I would have assumed that I was drinking the same beer, due mostly to the plain, simple nature of both beers."
"Pass this by for almost any other craft unless you are looking for something to pound and not think about."
"D- No thanks, one half of these is more than enough. I don't think I'm a big Kölsch fan."
"Overall, a decent brew, certainly drinkable, but nothing special."
"I poured the brew into a summer ale tasting glass. Nothing exceptional about the appearance, slight lacing and golen in color. The initial smell is spicy, cinnamon and some sweetness and citris. The taste in refreshing and balanced, just not alot going on. The mouthfeel is dry and the finsh is decent. Nothing I would go out of my way for, but a decent beer."
"Kölsch beers are fine if it is sunny, you're in Köln, otherwise leave them alone. They are supposed to be delicate and flavourless, this one fits the bill perfectly, so full marks for effort. The beer is well made, but it isn't the beer to be having if you're on a mission like I was."
"Overall, not the best Pyramid beer I have had by any means. I understand they were going for a refreshing summer ale, but this really lacks taste. I will not purchase this any time soon, as I will be much more inclined to buy new beers to try and other more pleasing beers I have had before..."
"New packaging relabels this old Pyramid offering a face lift. Their summer seasonal Kolsch is labeled as a blonde ale this time around, pours a brilliant golden body with a slight haze cast over it, bright white nicely carbonated head forms a dimpled cloud rising well above the edge of my glass. Chunky scattered lacing forms with each sip and as the head slowly dwindles down. Aroma has some mild citrus components with some cooked veggies and pale biscuit malt sweetness. A touch of herbal spicy hops and mineral water are there as well, let's see how it's tasting. A bit of harshness is present with mild grainy off flavors, the metallic edge seems to overshadow the rest of the flavors. Some nice sweetness with a kiss of citrus fruit are apparent but they become muddled within cooked veggies and that mineral rusty finish. Mouthfeel is thin but carbonation seems a bit unnatural and forced, where the metallic edge really weighs the palate down after just a few sips. Drinkability overall is pretty pour, I will reevaluate next year but so far the Fall seasonal beats the pants of this one."
"Seriously though decent summer time beer and goes down easy."
"Pours a clear, golden color. 1/3 inch head of a white color. Decent retention and decent lacing. Smells of yeast, pale malt, sweet malt, and slight grain. Fits the style of an American Blonde Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of yeast, hops, sweet malt, and slight citrus. Overall, a decent blonde with good body and nice aroma."
"It's a very good American made Kolsch."
"D- An easy one to drink, but not one to remember."
"Not a bad beer, but it makes for a poor Kolsch."
"One of my least favorites from Pyramid."
"D - I do not like this beer and I love the Kolsch and Blonde styles. This missed the mark."
"This one's generally drinkable and not a bad beer. As a Kolsch, though, there are others I'd pick first."
"M/D - light bodied and easy drinking, crisp and nice on a hot day. Nothing too overly amazing, but not bad."
"D: Easy to drink especially on a warm day. I enjoyed the beer but would pursue a different Kolsch next time."
"Kolsch are not one of my favorite beers it takes a little bit to get used to. But this is beer is true to it style."
"Light-medium in body and very drinkable."
"D - This is a nice, easy-drinking summer beer."
"I wasn't expecting a whole hell of a lot out of this beer as it only cost $1.35 (as part of a mixed six). Once again, this beer would be a good pick to get tipsy off of, but don't ever eat your dinner with it."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Light in body and quite easy to drink. This is one I'd consider buying again, though I think that I'll explore some more of the style first. Finish is clean and ends up dry in the end. Compared to the Full Circle this one isn't nearly as drinkable, for the style, that is."
"This poured a clear straw color with white head. It smelled like wild wheat malt with light lemon hops. It tasted like fresh wheat grain, sweet lemon hops, and a hint of delicate seasoning (perhaps thyme). It was very thin with some carbonation, and had a mildly bitter aftertaste. Overall this was a nice, clean beer that was perfectly light for summer drinking, but still flavorful enough to enjoy (and not too yeasty!)."
"Will definately revisit this beer each summer, a solid seasonal offering from Pyramid."
"Pours a apple juice amber with a small head of white creamy foam that leaves no lacing as it vanishes.Smells of lightly toasted malts and some tart apple.The taste is a bit less assuming than I had anticipated,overall very balanced.Roasted peanuts,toasted white bread,along with fruity flavors of pear and red apples can be found within this subtly satisfying brew.The body was light,but not as light as other Kolsh offerings,the carbonation is light and the finish is clean with a lingering sweetness.This went nicely with the steak burrito,a bit to plain jane for me to order a second."
"Tasted at the Lancaster brewing monthly get-together. Light yellow with bubbly head. Bit of head. Skunky aroma. Not at all a good kolsch, it's hard to nail this style. Acidic.A bit of spiciness. It's drinkable, if nothing better about. Not impressed.Bottle 6 months later just as mediocre."
"D: This is a very drinkable beer with subtle flavors. Definitely a thirst-quencher on a hot summer afternoon. Pyramid makes some great lawnmower/session brews, and this one is one of the best in their line."
"D: I could see drinking a few (6-pack) during a setting and being very happy with it. Very nice attempt at a Kolsch."
"Worth a go..."
"D- On a hot day this would be an easy beer to drink other than that I'll take something else."
"Golden, Light Honey-like color. The beer pours a generous, light, and quickly dissipating head; a light rim remains thoughout drinking. The beer has a light summery nose, but without the herbal notes mentioned on the bottle. The mouthfeel is crisp and effervescent as I would like with a Kolsch Ale. The taste is light and dry, with the ale character coming through to distinguish it from it's lighter lager counterparts. Hints of citrus and bitter greens. I would like to see just slightly more hop character for balance. Overall, a very drinkable yet not overly exciting offering. Good for a hot summer day."
"Drinkability: A light brew, but one should know that going in ahead of time. Overall, an acceptable lil' Kölsch-type brew, and not nearly as horrendous as everyone's making it out to be."
"An orangish brown color and a middling tan head. The nose has pale grainy malts and some mild bittering hops. The taste is quite light with an herby hop presence over subtle barley. A light body has ample carbonation. Not a bad version of the style, just a bit on the light side."
"D- If the flavor was a little better, this would be a great session beer. Although it would be much better than a light lager at a picnic or at the ballpark."
"This is easy to down. nothing too frightening that would sprain the taste buds, though. bummer. I would say this would be excellent at a summer party where not everybody was ready to experience an over the top IPA or a heavy RIS. Anybody interested in experimenting should be happy with this, anybody wanting a little more should also enjoy this."
"MK"
"It pours a very light clear yellow color, thin white head that settles very quickly. Smell is very faint fruit, very little if any hop presence. I'm not sure if i'd call this a kolsch, but it is a good brew. Taste has a very light malt sweetness, smooth and light mouthfeel. Low abv makes this a great session brew. I much prefer it on tap at the brewery before a game, but it's still good in bottles."
"D= if it's being poured and running somewhere, I'll definitely drink this for the night. If I wanted an interesting blonde-ale or golden-lager I might consider buying some more of this."
"This beer pours a hazy golden color. The head is two inches in height, and recedes slowly into nice lacing. The aroma is of spicy noble hops, biscuity malt, and fresh cut grass. The taste is full of spicy hops, and soft malt. The mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with a high level of carbonation. Overall, this is a pretty good kolsch. I could drink this again."
"Drinking this beer you need to be in a Summer frame of mind. This is patio fodder with enough hops and complexity to make it worth drinking. Clean finish with apple notes on the nose and midbody this is a solid version of the style. This won't blow your socks off but is a nice change from all the wheat beers out for the summer"
"Poured a light/medium gold, with little short lasting white head. Smell was grassy, sweet, grain, metal, and tea like at times too. On the light side of carbonation and a very smooth, almost creamy mouthfeel for a lighter beer, that is incredibly easy to drink. Tastes smooth and has a satisfying creamy sweetness with just enough bite to be refreshing. Not as good the 2nd time I tried this. Maybe worth a shot, but I dont think Ill crave it a 3rd time."
"Could probably pound way too many of these!...This beer was here in Summer and I chose to ignore it then...For some reason tonite I just had to give her a go...It's a good thing my Summer didn't know what she missed out on!..."
"Smell is ho-hum, kind of boring. There is some herbiness in there, but it does smell, as many have pointed out, like a wheat beer. Taste is mostly malt, some herbal hoppiness, bitterness balances out perfectly. Mouthfeel is light, drinkability is good. I bet this would have been better had i had it during the summer--hotter temperatures and lighter bodied beer go hand in hand, plus it would have been fresher. Certainly not a home run, but not a strike out either."
"On draught at Chilis in the Houston airport. Pours a slightly hazy yellow-gold color with columns of bubbles and a medium white head that dissipates steadily. Spotty lacing. Aroma of mild hops and citrus. Light-bodied and effervescent with notes of hops, sweet malt and citrus. The finish is mildly bitter hops with a touch of spice in the aftertaste. Overall about what you would expect from a summertime beer from a brewer like Pyramid."
"certainly worth it."
"Had this at my hotel in Durham, NC and it seemed pretty fresh. The appearance was a bit whimpy with a very light golden color, a whispy head and medium lacing. The aroma was skunky wheat to me. Not my favorite, although I am also generally not drawn to this style naturally despite a number of pleasant surprises. This one did have a very nice clean cereal flavor with some citrus highlights. It has a lively carbonation, fine bubbles, and is a refreshing, drinkable choice but it's maybe a little too dry for me to want to drink more than a couple of these. Not bad but worth a try on a hot summer day (good with salsa and chips perhaps?)."
"D: A good full-flavoured Kolsch, easy to drink on a summer's day or watching a ball game, as it suggests on the label, I could drink a lot of this, and at a good price, one of the cheaper craft brews that I have found. Good job Pyramid."
"It's not one that I'd go out of the way for, but my wife liked it. Worth a try if you like spiced beers. Also, I thought it was similar to American Wheats - so if you like those, try this. Maybe with a lemon."
"Light to medium-bodied, the carbonation leaves a bit of a tingle on the tongue and it dries out nicely. Easy to session, especially on a warm afternoon -- its sweetness makes me think of a gourmet High Life, but with some ale characteristics (grapes). Goes down easy. Pretty decent American Kolsch."
"D- Not really wanting another on this hot summer night."
"Not refreshing enough to justify the lack of flavor."
"It glows yellow when poured into my pint glass with a thin layer of head. There are a few nice flavors in this beer, such as a touch of cinnamon and herb with some grain. I could do without the cooked veggie flavor, but it's doesn't destroy the overall experiance. It's crisp and quaffable, two of the style's trademark qualities, which helps beat the heat."
"Crisp, clean malt notes with just a touch of tart apple and a grassy finish on the palate. Unremarkable, yet highly quaffable. A nice summer beer to keep the heat at bay."
"Pours a clean/clear golden yellow color, nice carbonation, little fizzy white head, some lacing around the edges. The nose is malty, hoppy, some spices, and some caramel. The taste pretty much follows the nose, slightly sweet, malty, and hoppy. The finish is slightly dry/bitter. Light body. Drinkable, not too bad, but most likely will not buy again."
"Bottom line: Interesting example of the style and is worth a try."
"12oz. bottle: This one pours a hazy, golden color. There was a small head, and it dropped away quickly. Milder aroma. It has floral and citrus notes, but nothing really standing out. Some sweetness to the taste, with a slightly citric finish. I wouldnt call it bitter, but there is a touch of hops in the finish. Not bad. Much better than your typical lawnmower beer."
"The Pyramid Curve Ball Kolsch pours a clean dark straw color with a thin head which quickly dissipates to a light, almost transparent layer of foam. Leaves no lace. The aroma, like the bottle label suggests is herbal in nature. Peppery too, with perhaps a faint hint of clove deep down. There are also floral components within, and some faint traces of citrus. A nice summertime aroma. The taste is not as complex as the aroma. It's thin, almost watery, with weak flavors and a strong alcohol-flavored finish. The mouthfeel is crisp and clean, which is how a kolsch should be, but I wouldn't say this is a very good beer. It might be refreshing on a really hot summer day, but there are better choices out there. Might be worth trying on tap somewhere if I see it, but I won't exactly seek this beer out again. There are better kolsch beers to be found for sure."
"Light and alright."
"Pours transparent gold with light carbonation and no head or lace of any kind. The aroma is overloaded with icky-sweet buttery honey and herb tones. Flavor shows somewhat better balance. The initial fruity honey notes develop into a slightly crisp herbal banana finish. Body is only thinly carbonated and rather too syrupy. Reasonably drinkable, but it's nearly a sweet mead rather than a kolsch."
"Notes: Not much to write about here as its not all that deep or complex. It hits all the marks for the style and was refreshing and clean. A bit more carbonation may crispen this up and make it even more enjoyable. All in all a solid offering."
"pours an oh-so-light, slightly hazy, golden bodywith a quicly receding head. lace is pretty decent, especially on the far side of the glass. smell is quite herbal, with some notes of wheat and banana. taste, initially was quite displeasing and sour, but as the beer warms up, and i warm up to it, there comes a pleasant grassiness and wheaty sweetness - tastes like a summer beer to me. body is pretty thin without being overly carbonated and the finish is nice, if not a little too drying on the cheeks and palate. refreshing, quafable, a bit sour... not bad. bland, but not bad. i bet it will go well with the pizza soon to be delivered."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle. The beer pours a clear gold, with very light spots of lace. Aroma is a mixture of spices and hops. The taste is smooth hops, spices, light fruit and malts. This almost tastes like a winter holiday brew. Light smooth mouthfeel. The fact that I would love to fill a stein with this at a German festival is enough to say that this is definitely a session ale. None of the other Kolsch style beers I've tried have even come close to this. Highly recommended!!!"
"Drinkability- A nice, easy dreinging beer good for working out in the yard. Next time you are tempted to pick up a sixer of Bud light t odrink during your home improvement project, do yourself a favor and pick this up instead."
"A reasonably drinkable beer, maybe a sessioner, but nothing too exotic. My first Kolsch, so it's hard to judge for style. Served maybe a little too warm too. Felt it might have been a little tastier at a slightly cooler temp. Went pretty well with a light turkey sandwich though."
"D: Not good. Pass."
"A mediocre beer. More ""funky"" than bad when it comes to the flavor and smell. Some may like this, but it's definitely not my thing."
"A bit watery with a sharp feel. I won't be revisiting this one."
"Pours a cloudy straw color with some orange highlights. Smells grassy with hints of oranges/lemons. Taste was less complex than I had anticipated, but it's good nonetheless; a little roasted malt action coupled with a strong carbonation and grassy aftertaste...it's a nice blend. Very drinkable Kolsch."
"When drinking this, I keep thinking that it is like a subdued roggenbier in that it is very sour, rank, and tart.... and a bit like a very very subdued rauchbier in that it is a little earthy and smokey. It's pretty damn complex, but in a muted way....this one whispers instead of yelling. I would drink this again in the summertime (very sessionable...mine went down in less than ten minutes) as a mildly entertaining thirst quencher, but it's nothing to write home about."
"Drinkability: A decent summer quaffer, but just doesn't thrill me with some of its elements"
"pours out a cloudy, dirty golden colour with a thin fine head and wispy rings of lace on my glass. sweet malty aroma, a bit of caramel apples, some vegetal notes and a bit of grainy, grassy notes. lightly malty in the taste...mostly herbal and grassy with metallic overtures dancing on my tongue. quite light and refreshing without any sweetness to speak of. body is light, even a touch watery at times. mouthfeel is crisp. drinkability is above average just for being the decent summer quencher it is."
"Not a bad beer."
"Poured from a bottle, this kolsch had a light amber, slightly orange color to it. It gave a very light head which did not hold, but that it typical for kolsch. Had a very mild smell, with sublte apple coming through. The taste was crisp and smooth, again with some mild fruit tones. Mouthfeel was light and crisp, went down smooth. All in all seemed light a decent kolsch."
"12 oz. bottle. Appearance was pale gold, with faint orange tone, slightly hazy. No head despite strong pour. Looked flat. The smell was primarily apple and a hint of wax? Taste was slightly sweet/fruity at first, then the hops came through, and it finished almost peppery. The mouthfeel was almost flat and somewhat drying. It was fairly drinkable, but it seemed to have more bite than you would expect from the style."
"Maybe some of their other stuff is better but I'll pass on this boy..."
"Drinkability - This is too citrusy for my liking. Interesting nonetheless."
"Overall not a bad beer, but there is nothing special about it. It's light and bland making it ok for a hot day, but not something I will buy again."
"Overall, not exactly an enjoyable Kolsch, and one you should avoid."
"Overall impression: Highly drinkable summer brew. This is a nice gateway beer, but it is also interesting enough to be a summer staple for those with broader tastes."
"Pours nice pale color with lots of carbonation and a ok head. Smells grassy and citric and a touch off in the malt. The off-ness contiues as I sip through this, I think it might be slightly oxidized or have some metal in the water I don't like. I don't know I don't care for this one. I couldn't finish this before dinner so I dumped it and got something better."
"this beer is ver refreshing, great for a hot summers day, there is one thing it is lacking the hint of sulfer that most kolsch's have."
"Low to medium bodied. A fairly refreshing beer for hot weather. Not too bad for a summer beer."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable beer. Not anything complex or aggressive. I do not know if this does justice to the Kolsch style, but I find this beer very enjoyable and imagine it would be great on a hot summer day. It makes sense as a summer seasonal and would be great with some grilled burgers."
"Not one I will drink again. Just not a good Kolsch."
"Mouthfeel is rather light with plenty of bubbles. Pretty thin and refreshing but a bit too bubbly. A bit bland...it really doesn't grab my attention in any way. Would make a nice lawn mower beer though."
"Very drinkable and quite refreshing on a hot day - like today - but not much character to distinguish from millions of other beers out there."
"Taste is very crisp with a sweetness that quickly turns to a hoppy bitterness and a dry finish. I would rate the bitterness as being medium in intensity which I prefer with the Kolsch style. The mouthfeel is perfect, light with a nice amount of carbonation. I could drink this beer all night long."
"This is a drinkable beer, but frankly the flavor is underwhelming. I would prefer something a little more full-bodied. I wouldnt mind having Curve Ball again, especially on a hot day, but I wouldnt go out of my way for it."
"Smells fruity--faintly reminds me of the fruity aroma of belgian ales. Not much head at all, thin and bubbly, and quickly disappears leaving no lacing. Looks light and blonde, but with a murky cloudiness. I like it! My first response was, ""Oh! This is a happy beer!"" Because of that fresh, germany herb taste that kicks into the back of my mouth. I feel like it's lifting my spirits already. Fairly straight-forward, light on the hops, but ""laesst sich leicht trinken"" (allows itself to be drank easily) as the Germans would say. This would be fantastic as a refresher on a hot summer afternoon...I'll try it again when it's not 24 degrees outside."
"Pours a medium gold with a 1 finger head after an aggresive pour. OK longevity and OK lace. Grassy sweet malt smells mixed with honey and a hint of citrus. Sweet malt with honey and slight bitterness. Definately a lawnmower beer - very unoffensive. Highly drinkable due to its lightness. Not a great beer but OK."
"Despite the out whack flavors still pretty quaffable if taken out of context of the style. I did like last years effort quite a bit more"
"As with most Kolshes, if you are thirsty and want a ""decent"" beer, this will work."
"Poured from a bottle - had a best by date of 10/12/06. Pale color with a little bit of head that quickly dissipated. Very little carbonation. Had a good smell that makes you think of summertime session beers. Unfortunately, the taste didn't live up to it. It was average for the sytle and would try again but if I want a Kolsch session beer then I'm going with St. Arnold's Lawnmower (a classic)."
"Overall Impression: A mild lawnmower beer, not exactly a session though, just not enough flavor going on for me. Enjoyable but mild."
"Not bad for a summer quaffer if you find it somewhere cheap."
"Not a bad beer and difinately drinkable, but not my favorite by any means."
"Drinkability: Refreshing. Corn not overwhelming. Not too bad. But I'm noticing a quality control problem with more delicate beers from Pyramid's bottles."
"Pours a golden straw color with a bit of a chill haze and a short white head that vanishes completely without a trace. Nose is somewhat herbal with notes of pungent hops though there is a malt sweetness in the background. The taste is bright and lively up front with a good deal of fruitiness followed by a bit of wheat and then some mild citrusy hops towards the finish. Crisp and refreshing. A good choice to enjoy outdoors on a hot day, or even better, as the label suggestsout at the ballpark."
"Soft mouthfeel, nice finish. Clean and refreshing. Good carbonation, very enjoyable. This is a unique and enjoyable beer. I am impressed by it and reccomend it on a hot day. I will definitely look for this again at some point."
"poured a clear moderate amber color with sparse head. Smell is light of herbs and a bit sour. Taste is unremarkable with maybe a bit of dryness and not much else. mouhtfeel is mildly dry. A very disappointing beer and I probably will not try it again."
"Nice drinkable brew but not really a session beer, this one is for enjoying with food."
"My first Kolsch. Pours a hazy golden yellow with very little head. Aroma of baked bread with just a ever so faint hint of lemon. Very smooth and light with just a hint of hop bitterness. Goes down smooth and easy. Not a bad brew for a hot summer day, just not one I would go out of my way for."
"Notes: This is what happens when you use american 2-row instead of german pilsener malt. The body is way too thick. Its not quite as refreshing, crisp, and thirst quenching as a real Cologne Kolsch. Its an OK try though."
"Pours a pale yellow color with a thin white head that doesnt retain. The aroma is a raw barley aroma with a hint of earthy, mineraly hops. Taste begins with a bready malt flavor and a mineraly hops flavor, different but not really good per se, as i've experienced with many of pyramid's beers. Mouthfeel is smooth and light, and the caronbation is moderate to high. Drinkability is pretty good. An interesting but not really exciting brew."
"Almost no head, but what's there is white and fizzy. Beer is slightly hazy gold, a little dirty. There's a touch of sour milk in the faint, sweet, nutty aroma. The beer starts nutty and fruity, Quite full and fruity through the middle. Grassy bitter in the end, with big nuts in the aftertaste. Good. Tasty. Bitter, fruity."
"Thanks to HardTarget for this very nice example."
"Light bodied, with a watery mouthfeel and tiny bubbles of easy carbonation. Nothing to write home about."
"Good suppin' beer, I suppose. Certainly light and drinkable. Completely inoffensive."
"Pale golden, clear, with not much head on it. Lightly fruity, lightly floral aroma, pleasant and subtle. Flavor is simple: a touch of malt and fairly low bitterness, and a clean, ever so slight tartness at the end. There's a slight wheat malt taste also, I think. Body is light, texture neutral. An uncomplex but moderately tasty beer, good for a session ale."
"The color is clear, light golden shade with an average, bright white head. Almost no carbonation. Aroma is fruity with a good bit of sweetness and just a little citrus smell. Taste has a good combination of sweet grains and fruitiness. Herbal hops provide some balance and a citrusy finish. Mouthfeel is very crisp and somewhat dry. Very thirst quinching and very easy to drink. Curve Ball does everything that I want of a summer seasonal."
"Poured out to a slighly cloudy golden yellow color with a nicely formed head and a touch of lace around the glass. Odors of bread and grain were slighly noticed, otherwise not much to tell. The taste is where I really think things need inmprovement; It needs more! It's not bad, relatively dry with hints of grassy like qualities, and the flavor of raw oats. Slightly bitter, with a hint of sourness. Finished crispy and slightly dry. Mouthfeel was pretty good, with the carbonation striking the tastebuds with the notion of something interesting on the way... unfortunately, it never comes. This brew just needs more flavor. Worth a try, but I must imagine there are better Kolsch beers out there."
"My overall impression of this beer is that it is the perfect beer for a hot day. Really easy drinking."
"Certainly drinkable. On a hot day I could knock back 4 and not realize it until the alcohol kicked in. Average marks across the board."
"Not Pyramid's best but nothing to be ashamed of. If you're one who doesn't like the beer too bitter, definately give this one a try."
"Slightly hazy gold color, small white head on the top. Light sweet malt nose. Light sweetness is capped by a more robust grainy taste. Kiss of flowery hops in the rear. Medium soft bodied. Again, certainly not bad, but there are others i would turn to first."
"The mouthfeel is light and crisp at the start, with a clean, dry, crisp finish. Drinkability is down a notch with since the flavors and look of the brew are not up to others."
"Beer is good. Happy Kölsch Beering."
"Drinkability- More impressed than I thought I was going to be. If I were to buy Pyramid I would take a stab at this one. Better than all the others I have tasted by a good margin. All except the Snow Cap (which is a whole different beer). Give it a try."
"Slightly hazed golden in color with tons of carbination rising to just a bit of head and a slight swirling, dusting and nice ring. Clean, malty aroma that is just nice and crisp. Alot of carbination in the mouthfeel, but not annoying. Tastes a bit lager-like. Balanced, malty, nice and crisp. Good hot day session beer, easy drinker."
"Hazy golden color with a touch of head. Low aroma-somewhat grassy,almost metallic like.Decent enough flavor-quite crisp. Slightly malty with a touch of bitterness in the backround. Body is ok-this is definately a warm weather beer and here I am having it in mid October. Would be worth having on a hot ummers day. Might not be a true Kolsch but a good ""summer"" beer none the less."
"Another lackluster beer from Pyramid although it's certainly not bad by any means. It's a light summer ale with not much in the way of traditional Kolsch characteristics, although the word has become shorthand for an American blonde ale, often available in the summer. The bottle had a disturbing amount of dark sediment, although the best-by date was 100304, and the beer poured with an unfiltered haze which was pleasing but definitely not true to style. Small amount of spidery lace. Some lemon and grass flavors are actually quite pleasing, and a wheaty tartness seemed to be evident. Best served at a cooler temperature and meant to be drunk quickly, although not in big gulps. Perhaps also best in the dead heat of summer."
"I've only had one other Kölsch and that one was on tap from a German style microbrewery. I liked it fairly well but wasn't blown away. That's about how I feel with the Curve Ball. Pyramid doesn't make too many bad beers. This isn't a bad beer, but it isn't especially great. Some head sat on the orange-brown beer. A nice, flowery smell, but mellow. The taste was smooth and malty and the beer went down well. The main problem with it is that I wasn't satisfied when I was finished despite having a beer with something to it."
"Very much a summer type ale, light bodied, light-medium carbonation and a cloudy pale yellow. Pours a two-fingered, pure white head that settles quickly but leaves some lace. Starts sweet and citrusy, finishes quietly with only a hint of hops. 12oz bottle $1.35, from Liquor Barn, Lexington, KY."
"Cloudy golden color with a small white frothy head that doesn't last long. Bready and flowery aroma, has a light bready flavor with some lemon, it is light bodied with somewhat of a thin, yet crisp mouthfeel, finishes dry and clean, not all that great."
"This goes down rather easy. No, it's not complex at all, but it's not meant to be. Like the name implies, this is a beer meant for quaffing during the hot summer months. This would be great during a baseball game on a long, summer day. At the Viking, they have this on-tap, and they sell it for $2 whenever the Mariners are on TV."
"I was not impressed by this beer at all. Do people really like this? Not for my taste at all!"
"An o.k. offering that I had at the Pyramid Alehouse in Walnut Creek. Straw colored and topped by a thin white head that did not last too long. Lacing was not around, at all. Grainy aroma was quite pronounced. malty, grainy, taste profile was light and refreshing. Some herbal hoppiness and a touch of lemony notes were present. Easy drinking with a light mouthfeel. A decent seasonal but not outstanding by any means. Good for a hot day but there are better to be had."
"This offering from Pyramid hit the spot on a nearly-100ºF day at the baseball game. Refreshing and light, Curveball had a nice taste and feel that lent itself to easy drinking. Definitely beats the macro offerings that dominate most venues."
"Overall: Not bad, and it does what I wanted it to  goes with Pizza perfectly, but it also a great drinking beer, neigh a good Six-Pack, to have in the fridge for the Summer on a hot afternoon."
"This beer poured a watery brownish yellow color with a head that faded very quickly. What happened to the head here and where is the lacing? Lots of bubbles though rise to the top. Smell is of toasted grain but it's also a bit buttery and skunky, not too nice. Taste starts off somewhat sweet, maybe apple like sweetness. Strong herbal flavors are there as well, kind of grassy. Middle is light and airy, almost watery but not quite. Finish is dry but not really that crisp. All in all this beer didn't do it for me. Good in really hot weather but that about it."
"The medium carbonation and mild hopping added a nice finish that cleared the palate after each sip, inviting another. I could see drinking a few of these and not getting tired of the experience; it was a nicely balanced ale that invites another round."
"I haven't been too thrilled with Pyramid beer in the past, but Curve Ball Kolsch surprised me by being pretty decent. Maybe they should have called it Change Up Kolsch."
"Not a bad beer, but if your looking for an even better interpretation, try the Goose Island Summer."
"Kolsch is often an underappreciated style, since a well-done beer in the style is still pretty reserved. I was quite pleased with this effort. Crisp, clean, with a touch of citric acidity for refreshment. Slightly herbal hops profile. A little cereal grain flavor crept in, but not so much as to throw the beer off. This is the beer mass produced pale lagers want to be when they are reincarnated as their next step to beer nirvana. If this were more available to me, it would be my go-to beer for the patio this summer."
"Thin, yellow body is slightly hazed. White head is small and completely vanishes in ten seconds, without lacing. Aroma has dry, biscuity malt and a faint herbal hops note. Mouthfeel is crisp and light bodied. Taste is very light bodied, with some grainy malt and nice, but faint, herbal hops bitterness for balance. Not very complex, but drinkability is good. I would call this one of those ""lawnmower beers", that would be refreshing after mowing the lawn on a hot day, but pretty useless in other settings. I'm not a fan of Kolsch or Kolsch styles, in general, and find them bland. This is not one of the better representations of the style, but it's very drinkable."
"This beer poured up very light in color. An aggressive pour did little to stir up some foam and what did come left just a fsat. It had a crisp, dry aroma and a mild citrus flavor. The m,outhfell was also dry. This beer might have been better on a hot day at the ball park."
"Not shockingly flavorful, but not so bland that it isn't worth drinking. It goes down rather easily, I must say. I think the bottle label depicting a game of baseball is appropriate, a simple ""summer stadium"" beer. It would be good with a well-dressed hot dog and a handful of salt n' vinegar potato chips."
"A pale yellow brew with a short-lived white and fizzy head that has little lace to leave. Smell is big and herbal with a little grassiness and a good fresh maltiness. Taste is altogether crisp and dominated by mellow caramel maltiness and spicy, herbal hops. Mouthfeel is light and bubbly...good for the style/season. Drinkability decent but the peculiar herbalness might make it less favorable for session use. Better than many examples of the style, this brew has character and alot else going for it. Nice!"
"Came in the ""Summer Beers"" sampler at World Market. Crystal clear slighty dark gold colored beer. Fairly noticable malt smell, although hops seeem to be a bit absent. Taste is malty, crisp and smooth. I like a hoppier beer, but this beer is above average for a kolsch. I would get it again if i had the chance."
"got a free glass though :-) That's their policy for seasonals on tuesday at the brewpub."
"12 ounce bottle."
"Pours a light blond with a slight head that is gone pretty quickly,a nice light grassy aroma with a note of toasted malt.A light crisp beer with some herbal qualities with a cracker-like malty aftertaste.I could drink many of theses on a hot day for sure."
"This beer pours a light gold with a nice white head than goes down in size. No lacing to speak of. The smell is of malts and caramels, citrus hints as well. The taste is light with malts and citrus notes, a crisp drink. Fells crisp and full in the mouth. A drinkable beer, great for the summertime heat."
"Fine overall example of style, along with good thirst quenching properties."
"Very easy to drink, low abv makes it even more so. A role-player, when it's hot out, when you want something 'decent' that you can knock back mindlessly, bottle after bottle."
"F"
"Clear, golden hue, skimpy white head that quickly faded to a bubbly collar. No lace was produced. The nose is typical, slightly malty with dry herbalness, caramel grains. Decent enough. Simplistic and straightforward palate, slight caramel grain/malt with underlying herbalness dry with firm carbonation, obviously geared towards being refreshing (it is a summer seasonal after all). The hops bitterness is light but noticeable, especially at the finish. Drinkable. Medium-light body. This is a batting practice beer slow pitched right down the middle. For a more complex offering, look elsewhere, for an easy drinking beer, step-up to the plate."
"Thanks to Blatzman for the sample."
"Overall Impression: A good beer, but nothing outstanding. Nice rendition of Kolsch, but when it comes to renditions I like Alaskan Summer Ale better. This is not one of my favorite styles, so I haven't tried a lot of them. Not even an actual kolsch from Cologne, but then again, most people haven't."
"Nice name. Pours a very carbonated, clear yellow with a small bubbly white head. Is this Miller Lite? Thank god no. Smells of apples and hops. Taste is like apple-flavored Jolly Ranchers up front, but followed quickly by a nice hop balance and a dry, crisp, quenching finish. A little sweet, but nice and light for the summer--quite refreshing."
"This is a clear light amber brew with a nice white head that laces reasonably well. The nose gives a sense of malt with hints of citrus. The flavor is pleasant but not impressive, again reflecting both a malt and citrus sense. The body is fairly light and a bit thin, but the drinkability is good due to the pleasant taste and light ABV."
"Slightly hazy and pale golden in color. The head is small and short lasting. Not much of an aroma....some slightly spicy hops. Crisp carbonation makes it easy to drink and refreshing....definitely the best quality. Also a nice quality is the hop presence. It's mellow but assertive enough to make for some high drinkability. I'll drink this on a hot day for sure."
"Clear and medium gold, lots of upcharging carbonation to replenish the 1/4 inch tall white head of very small bubbles. Laces in big spots that drip. Wheat bread aroma, some sense of caraway seeds. Very light bodied and a little too carbonated -- malt is fairly straightforward pale caramel with a vegetal celery sense. Mid to late mouth hop bittering with a watery close somewhat similar to a Miller High Life. Despite what might have been attempted, and fine drinkability, I didn't find a lot to like here."
"This beer is a fifth pitch with 3 - 1 count. Color is a pale light yellow, small bright white head that faded fast, leaves no lace and has lots of bubbly action within the color. Smell is very faint, hardly noticeable citrus and spice. Taste is sharp and zesty of yeast, somewhat herbal/spice quality, a bit of wheat and a small hop thats very quick to start with a slight tarty bite. Mellows out nicely which I found to be the best part of this beer. Feel is light bodied, moderately carbonated. Well done light styled beer, but not quite up to par comparatively speaking. Would fit perfectly for hot summer days."
"Pours a slightly hazy straw-gold body with a brass cast. The full and creamy bright white head holds well, bolstered by a solid release of tiny bubbles. And although the head slowly drops in size from an inch or more tall, it maintains a solid 1/4 to 1/2 inch throughout and leaves some nice lace. The fresh and welcoming aroma displays grainy malt amidst a light fruitiness and a touch of citrusy hops. The body is light/medium and the carbonation is only gently crisp at the outset before becoming smooth and creamy across the palate. The flavor offers a delicate but spirited combination of grainy and lightly wheat-ish malt that's well-balanced by firm bitterness. An herbal/floral hop flavor and yeasty fruitiness add the character that gives it life. It finishes dry due to the bitterness, but with a layer of honeyish and fruity malt that sticks in the mouth momentarily. A nice beer, and although it's not very authentic when compared to the beers of Köln, it is a fairly interesting American interpretation."
"This might be pretty drinkable stuff on a hot summer day."
"Nice and clear as expected with a larger head that quickly dies into almost nothing. Good crisp flavor with a mellow hop aroma. A little more bitter than I expected for a bitter but thats not a bad thing in my book. Overall not a bad beer, just wish there was a little better head retention."
"The taste is very mellow. That's what a kolsch is supposed to be, but this one hasn't quite hit the spot quite yet. I quickly feel full after drinking just one beer. That label is pretty cool though."
"Average beer. Clear as can be, golden in color. Very light aroma something akin to passing near a well-vegetated field. Kind of organic, herbal smell. Very little to the taste and pretty straightfoward. A little zest to it, and it goes down remarkably easy. A little more flavor would have done this beer wonders. Probably nicest as a softball game alternative to Miller Lite."
"Pale gold color, with a brief white head. Aromas of herbs, and some fruit. Minimal hops in the nose, but much more spark upon the tongue. Label illustration is a perfect application, for this is an ideal ballpark beer. A lingering spice/fruit flavor continues through the finish. Soft, satisfying, delicious."
"The pour a crystal clear bright golden amber color, the head a dazzling white, the size modest and the lace nice clinging sheets. Malt aromas dominate the sparklingly clean and fresh nose, Crisp malt start with a skinny top and the finish bitingly acidic. Sparsely hopped, and a pleasantly dry long lasting aftertaste, drinkable, but not a beer that I care for."
"Pours rose/gold with no spontaneous bubbles or head. Smells sweet and syrupy with hints of macadamia nuts. The flavors are of sun-dried veggies and toast with a decent, rich mouthfull of dry grain. The bubbles carve out a speckled trail of metal through the finish. Pretty average beer. Too bad."
"Thanks, Bighuge"
"Gold with a light creamy head...pretty clean looking, but there is a little cloudiness...nice sweet nose of malt...nice malt nose with a pilsener like hop bite...a little more bitterness on the finish than I anticipated...kind of like a sweeter pilsener...light-to-medium body...thirst quenching...more of a subtle beer than an in your fance powerhouse of flavor, but still a nice drink"
"Easy drinking and balanced. Similar to the Shiner Summer Stock Kolsch except less fruity and ale-like and a more balanced finish. I personally don't mind the grassy taste and aroma because that is what I expect and have learned to appreciate in German (style) beers."
"Pyramid Curve Ball:  Seasonal/summer beer in the style of a Kolsch.  The problem is the beer had an astringent aroma and taste that was not at all pleasant.  Further, had a pure white head that disappeared for good within thirty seconds.  The taste reminded me of grass, in a strange way.  Not worth the bother."
"The beer pours a chill-hazed golden with carbonation evident in the form of bubbles surfacing at a good clip.  What little head that forms is gone quickly.  A nice spicy hop aroma (seems like saaz) with an underlying malt scent noticeable also.  Body is medium. Very nice pils or cara-pils malt base. The hop nuances really dance around on the tongue nicely.  This is a nice tasting Kolsch.   Leaves a nice subdued lingering bitterness that makes you want to drink more.  After the Snowcap, this is probably my next favorite Pyramid Beer."
