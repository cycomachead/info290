"Serving type: can"

"Very Smooth, excellent head with very light hops and no bitterness.  Great find.  Thanks to the folks at the Strange Brew Tavern in Allentown, PA."
""
""
"Got this on a whim because it was on sale.   A lot more complex than the light summer beer I expected, with heavier feel, darker coloration, and some pleasingly bitter notes."
""
""
"Overall a solid, crisp and refreshing kolsch, but not as good as the ones I had in Cologne Germany."

"A very nice and refreshing Kölsch-style brew that ticks all the boxes for this particular style. Very nice color and aroma with a mild sour and smoky aftertaste. Not too carbonated. Overall a very pleasant drink that goes down easily."

"04/26/14 From a can. Thanks to AJ at Super Buyrite. This is more substantial than Kolschs I've know. Nothing wrong with that as long as it's balanced. Firm head atop a slightly darker beer than the light blondes in my past. Slight aroma doesn't give anything away as to the fullness of the mouth-feel & tastes. At 4.8 ABV it could be called a session beer by some, but I'd reserve that for beers of a lighter body. At the risk of sounding petty I'll say this is a great summer evening or night brew, but starting a session in the afternoon with this candidate may be costly. I will be looking out for it again this summer."

"O - Not true to style. Reminds me of a session IPA more than a Kolsch. Drinkable for sure but not soaring to the top of the leaderboard for me of Kolsch's I've had."

"Overall - If you like pear, it's good as Kolsch gets in USA."

"A nice American interpretation of the style. Perfect for noshing on coneys and potato salad."
"O: Some have said this is kind of like a macro lager. Well, I drank my share of macro lagers the night before, and let me tell you - this makes every one of them look like a sad joke. For one, it's actually hoppy. I would have no trouble drinking this all day, that's for sure."

"Overall – A rather decent kolsh, that is fairly refreshing and crisp, but that is nothing super out of the ordinary."

"High value, excellent drinkability, refreshing during the warmer summer days. We brought some of these to recent bbqs and beach parties where they really hit the spot. Plus it's $30 for a case, which is ridiculously cheap for a craft beer case in Center City Phila."

"O- Refreshing on a hot day, and it brings a lot of flavor. Something to chug, yet something to savor."
""
"Overall, I would not recommend this. I would rather have a stale Kolsch imported from Koln out of the bottle. Even without my judgement of this vs. German Kolsch beers, it does not stand on it's own as a summer beer or a session ale. There's MUCH better out there in those departments as well."
""

""
""
"O- This was the right fit on a beautiful summer day. Easy to drink, flavorful, some bite. And at 4.8% abv , gentle on the bloodstream."
""
""
""
""
""
"D: pretty mediocre/poor example of the style. not sure if this is a freshness issue or just not that good of a beer to start with. regardless, gets a big pass from this guy."

"Nothing incredibly extravagant about this kolsch, but it is an incredibly refreshing beer that I look forward to having every summer."
""
"Poured into a tall Kolsch glass...what else? Pillowy and bright white head that takes time settling atop clear brilliant straw-gold liquid. Light bready malty nose with a flowery hop tone tell me this is promising. Light and delicately hoppiness with light malt backing. Finishes crisp and hoppy. A quintessential hot weather session drinker...hits the mark here during the current NJ heatwave. Delicious."

"Overall..Blahh"
""
"Nothing glaringly bad about this, just not overly exciting. Solidly average."

"Real refreshing Kolsch, going to be enjoying these, great price for them too. I'd buy this again easily."

"Lancaster Kölsch poured a pretty yellow with a clean white head. The pour produced 2 fingers of foam that stayed at half a finger throughout with light lacing. The aroma had a light floral note with the characteristic kölsch backbone. True to form the taste was light and clean. A solid Kölsch offering from Lancaster Brewing!"

"Overall: A nice, easy drinking Kolsch. Would have another if I'm in the mood."
"Pours a semi hazy bronze color with and inch of soapy white head. Aroma is somewhere between bready and yeasty with some straw and barnyard elements. In the taste, malty, with some spicy hops and yeast. HopS are mild, herbal and tea like. There is a light and crisp malt body. Overall, a nice, clean example of a kolsch. Easy drinking and good flavor."
"O - A nice surprise to be sure. It would be great on a hot summer day after mowing the lawn. If it was local I'd probably buy it on occasion."
"Not sure if this is contract brewed, as the can says Wilkes-Barre PA. I bought my 12-pack at Lancaster Brewing Company on Plum Street in Lancaster."
"O- A great summer session beer, very refreshing and the 4.8% ABV isn’t going to wreck you. This in an under appreciated style of beer in my opinion, and one I always like to sample when I can find it. Great alternative to a pilsner or a wit."
"Pours a paper-thin head that dissipates into a ring around my glass, hazy gold in appearance. Aroma of malts, butterscotch and citrus fruits. Smooth and tasty, easy drinking with a malty citrus finish. Pretty good but not necessarily true to the kolsch style"
"Overall an easily quaffable kolsch. Excellent summer style."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. Overall it is a fairly well done example of the style that makes for an easy drinking brew on a warm day. This isn't a style of beer I get thirsty for frequently but today it hit the spot. Thanks for sharing Pete."
"A very crisp enjoyable beer for these hot July days. A pretty good example of the style, not an exemplar but good enough to know if you enjoy and appreciate the style for what it is."
"Overall, nicely done maybe a bit on the sweet side in terms of flavor, but good bitterness to back it up."
"I like this beer. It is nice and light and yet has good flavors or the summer."
"I am not the biggest fan of this style. But this is a good representation, easy drinking and sessionable. No head retention whatsoever hurts this brew. Overall, pretty good."
"Not very refreshing. Strong flavors without much complexity. I find it had to see the Kolsch pedigree, but it's not as hoppy as a pale ale. Next!"
"An incredibly sessionable, quenching brew. Definitely a summer hit at parties."
"I poured this into a perfect pint glass, it has a 2-3""white head that is on top of a golden color body. The smell is light of lemon and hops. The taste is very nice and crisp, i get a sense of lemon, citrus and not a strong taste of hops, but it is present. It has a great mouth feel, smooth and is very drinkable. Goes down nice."
"Pours clear with ample white pillowy head; head lasts a while and has a medium creamy texture. Body is medium gold, almost bronze. Smell is of spicy rust, mild grain aroma. Taste is hop bitter forward carried by light malt, I want to say they used Northern Brewer for bittering, light, very light grain however overshadowed by the hops. Some mild spicy hop flavor on the backside, light and fluffy mouthfeel, hop bitter lingering in the after taste mixed with some ""can"" flavor. If this didn't have the slippery and creamy mouthfeel, any more hop bitterness or it didn't have the subdued carbonation it does, I don't think this brew would do it for me."
"An easy drinker. Good take on the style"
"D: A good example of a kolsch, which is not a style that I particularly care for. But this beer is representative of the style and is done well. Light and easy drinking."
"This was rather middle of pack for me as far as the Kölsch styles go. Just a lot of spice here and that syrupy mix of sweetness and fruit could have maybe have used even more balancing bitterness than what was there. Not horrible by any means but there are some others out there that I would go to first. I do like the canning of this by Lancaster though. We need more cans in Central PA!"
"D-Very smooth and easy drinking. This may not be a spot on Kölsch, but it is very good and I will look for it again."
"d- good, this is a nice refreshing summer drinker, i got a case of this without tasting it, and didn't regret it. i heard they are making this a year round, i would pick this up again."
"Overall this beer is thrown off by the buttey flavor. It seems to have some potential, but it isn't quite there yet."
"D- I liked it, I would drink a sixer in no time and with the luck I've been having lately I may up that to a 24 pack in one of those funny hats that you sip from a straw out of two beer cans parched on the hat, homer simpson style."
"D: LBC's Kölsch makes it easy to realize the importance of drinking seasonally. I've bought 2 cases to drink throughout the summer's hottest days, which is the only way this brew should be enjoyed."
"Bright yellow in color with a light haze. A thin white head after the pour that leaves a nice white cap and wet lacings on the glass. Light, fresh floral aroma with hints of lemon and biscuit. Light bodied with lower than average carbonation. Light malt biscuit flavors in the beginning, followed by citrus lemon and orange hop flavor and very crisp finish with a bitter aftertaste."
"Overall: probably the best beer that Lancaster makes. I do like the sho-fly porter alot but this is much more enjoyable especially since I can get this locally."
"I enjoyed this offering. It's got a bit more going on than a traditional German Kölsch, but I appreciated the nuanced flavor in a light beer. The finish needs some work, though."
"great job on your first canned beer Lancaster - I did it right!"
"A Kolsch? I'm not so sure I would have guessed this one by style had I tried it blind. Maybe an American Wheat Ale."
"Color is a bit darker than I would expect it to be, but still a light gold, completely clear and with mild carbonation. Head is also a bit smaller and lacing is again a bit lacking. Aroma is clean, subtle and a bit floral. Some very delicate grassiness comes through in the finish. Body is moderate and appropriately so."
"D: A very drinkable beer in the summertime. I actually bought this especially because I was getting overloaded on too many pale ale and IPAs with the heat & high humidity. This beer really does the trick, compliments food well, and doesn't get you overly hammered at one sitting. A great beer to enjoy with some full flavor."
"D - somewhat easy to drink, really wish it had an extra spark or two of carbonation.- all around solid nonetheless."
"D -A tasty Ale which is masquerading as a kolsch, but really tastes like a German Pils with the malt very low in the flavor and yeast hidden. I think it is a tasty beer, just misses the mark for Kolsch slighly."
"d: I was really excited to try this, so I feel a bit let down. I haven't tried many kolsches, but I remember liking other examples a more. Still, the price is right and these aren't bad. I wouldn't rule out a case purchase in the future."
"D: Perfect beer for the summer, Lancaster has definitely created a beauty here. And it comes in a can! Crisp, clean and refreshing like the can claims. That's really all that needs to be said."
"Would I buy more of it? - absolutely. I could throw a 12-pack of this on ice and be set for a weekend. This may be the only beer these guys put in cans but they sure as hell did a great job with this one."
"Had a can for $4 at Tap and Table in Emmaus. It was a slightly hazy golden beer with a short head. This wasn't a perfect kolsch, but it was plenty tasty and went nicely with the Fromager d'Affinois. There's a crisp herbal citrus hop bite followed by a smooth berry fruit character. It's a good summer beer, check it out."
"Poured from a 12 oz, can. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smells of malts, a bit on the sweet side. Taste is crisp, a touch sweet, good malt and hops balance, finishing a tad bitter. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a good quality beer."
"The mouthfeel is on the lighter side overall, but feels a little heavier then others in the style. Carbonation is above average. Drinkability is pretty good, it went down pretty easy on this hot day. it had some nice clean and crisp flavors and was pretty easy drinking overall."
"Nice suprise seeing a new seasonal from LBC. And in cans!! At $22 a case, I couldn't resist. Can says Wilkes Barre, PA so I'm guessing this is another contract brew from The Lion. Poured a hazy straw color with 2 fingers head. A bit of lace sticks on the glass as the head recedes. The smell reminds me of a barn full of hay. Palate is nicely balanced with cracker malts and grassy german hops. Also notice a hint of lemon zest in there. Mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing with a nice body that coats the mouth and lingers a bit. Great brew for the summer months and a great example of the style."
"Nice surprise to see a Lancaster beer in the almighty can. This one pours a brilliant golden straw color with a big frothing bright eggshell white head. Fine speckled lacing coats the sides of my Hennepin chalice. Aroma has citrus lemon grass noted earthy fresh cut grass amongst a nice pale bready/cracker malt backbone. A nice balanced malty/hop mix going on, lays on some semi sweet biscuit malt presence with a lemon rind grassy earthy finish that really makes the beer crisper than most American brewed Kolsch. Great dryness in the finish, flavorful session beer this is great stuff the kind of light beer that you can sink you teeth into. Carbonation is on from the can sometimes I've seen carbonation issues that's not the case here good stuff. I'm glad I bought a case at just over 20 bucks in the Burgh to bring in the fourth this weekend."
"D- oh hells yes this is drinkable! Low ABV, nice tasting, plus, its sold in cans so you can bring it on the beach with you. Total summer beer, and one of the better ones I've had. Kudos to LBC for churning this one out...much better than the Rare Rooster I'm used to from them in the summer."
"It's about time Lancaster started moving in the right direction with new management and better beer quality. I can't wait to see what Bill Moore & Company have up their sleeves for the fall !"
"In general, this verion is much more flavorful than most Kolsches I've tried but far from too heavy for the warmest of days. I'm very interested in trying it in the can and took a 12pack home. All in all an extremely good beer. I really enjoyed this one."
"Drinkability: super sessionable beer. This is a great beer for a hot and humid summer day in the northeast."
"My pour produced just over a finger's worth of rocky bone-white head that fell like the raindrops outside my window on this hot, humid summer afternoon. Color was a hazy golden-yellow, darker than the straw mentioned on the CAN. I definitely smelled grassy hops on the nose, almost peppery in their intensity. Mouthfeel was medium with a dry, lager-like crispness on the tongue. The finish had the same hoppiness but accompanied by a light honey-like flavor. I am impressed by their first CANned offering and look forward to other of their beers in a CAN in the future. This would certainly go into my cooler and if others need help in getting some, just drop me a Beer Mail."
"D - Pretty good. Not sure if I would buy this at a bar though. 3.5"
