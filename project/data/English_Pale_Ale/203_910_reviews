"Lovely mild beer with fruity tones, faint cherry, banana like. Smooth finish. Clean finish. Very pleasant beer."
""
""
"There is a mild hop bite on the finish, as well. (Funny side note: big IPAs may have ruined bitterness in anything below like… 80 IBUs.)"
""
"On nitro tap-- it's amazing!"
""
""
"A strong beer and extremely drinkable. Very pleasant."
"Like most British ales, the traditional cask version is bland and tasteless. But it's alright for a football match."
""
"Perfect ale for everyday use. Very fine with cheese nuggets"
"A dazzling look, very clear dark orange or light amber with small white head, high carbonation. Weak smell of caramel and lager-like yeast. Taste is slightly sweet, slightly bitter. Absolutely no hop aroma. No complex maltiness. A weak specimen of bland English ale, only good as a summer refreshment."
"Amber colored beer with a fruity, flavorful bitterness and a smooth hop finish. I found this a pleasant beer to drink"
""
""
"Unappetizing sweet malt taste - thin mouthfeel - disappointing."

"500ml bottle from Tesco. Excellent for the price (1.25 £), overall a good beer."

"Pours a deep clear amber with a a short lasting creamy white head. The aroma is rich and malty, with caramel and dark fruits. The taste adds an earthy hop flavor on the finish. The body is still and smooth. A great bitter."

"O: Abbot ale offers a mild experience with a great deal of character. The smooth and fruity feel of the beer makes it great for a session or replacement for fruit juice."
"To me, it's a fruity, dark-ish beer with lots of character, at a great price. Seems like a winning combination."

"I think it is probably a decent beer for the style, just not my favorite ale - if this was maybe 10 ibu's less bitter I would enjoy it much more"
"Overall: I thought i would enjoy this more than i did, it was a bit too similar to the generic lagers in the pub to my untrained palette."

"Soft, but with some character. The Nitro gives the beer a very smooth and slick feel."
"Thin khaki hued head on the pour, clear medium reddish in the glass, gently carbonated. Biscuity/bready nose with some yeasty fruitiness, biscuity and nutty flavors then some nice hop bitterness and fruitiness. Easy drinking due to the levels of carbonation...I'd really like it if it had a little more 'oomph' in the body department. Finishes on the dry side. Good session ale."

"brilliant brew here, how have I missed this before? luxurious creamy off white head from the nitro tap, a dense clear maple color underneath. it smells and taste about the same, a balanced, clean, incredibly satiating blend of English pale malts and appropriate hops in greater proportion than I expected for an English brew. its got a nice crisp bitterness after the grains roll through, and even notes of pine forest and earthy must, which give this beer impressive depth. I love it on nitro, gives the body some life, and drinks like an old world classic. my first beer from green king here, and I look forward to trying more of the lineup, this is a really nice pub ale that deserves some attention. a fine all day drinker."

"Overall 4.25: Great example of a British pub beer. Four of five Imperials of this bad boy and the world will take on a different meaning. You'll start writing poetry and wearing shirts with lace on them. You'll start referring to football as ""sport."" Well, maybe not those last two things, but nonetheless, this is a great beer and you should seek it out and try it. To answer an English person's question: ""Is it nice?"" Yes, it is. Very much so."

"My last beer of the day shall be a nice English cask ale. Indeed. It pours a clear sunrise amber topped by a finger of cream foam. The nose comprises lightly-sweet biscuit, mild greens, and light honey. The taste brings in more of the same, though everything is slightly milder, and there's a touch of grass in there for good measure. The body is a light medium, with a light carbonation and a smooth feel. Overall, a pretty nice EPA, one that seems right at home in this cask engine."
"Nothing stellar, but a decent drinking beer. The can gives it a few bonus points and it's incredibly drinkable, but doesn't really hold up over the course of the 16oz can."

"Not hesitating to put half of this in a chorizo and bean stew."
""

""

"Pours a clear dark honey orange with a foamy beige head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, fruits, and a mild hop aromas. Taste is much the same with fruit and caramel flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a low level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is light and easy to drink."

"As I stated in my initial review, I did pick up this brew again. I must say I was utterly shocked when I took the first sip; It was not the beautiful Ale I remembered from months before. In fact, it was so horrid that I was compelled to pour it down the drain; a move that I rarely make. Moral of the story? If you don't like it the first time I encourage you to pick it up again. If you get a good batch you will be pleasantly surprised with an Ale that is one of the best that I have tried."
""
"I have to say, with a bit more body and tempered sweetness, this could be an outstanding beer. As is, the caramel sweetness tends to overwhelm the other flavors, and, aside from the front end, the body comes off a little watery. A solid and drinkable English ale, but less than it could have been."
""
""
"can to nonic pint glass."
"O: Good English pale ale. Has the characteristics of sweet malt with a hop bitter backbone to balance it. Low on aroma and flavour hops, carbonation is on spot."
"Sweet and mild beer, quite bready and yeasty. Although it is average in several aspects, it has its own personality, but far from extraordinary."
"Drinkability: This is a decent (canned) British import. I bet it is much better from a cask, though."

"Here in Peru there are not many places where you can sample beers from other countries, so when he had me between a place where European beers were selling did not think twice. The first beer I tried was this and go which was a surprise. It's a beer with a strong taste, excellent aroma and rich flavor, one of my favorites ever since."
""
""
"I’m sure it had more flavour years ago, but my memory is fading, so it might not have changed at all?"
""
"O= This isn't a bad beer. Not what I was expecting. I was thinking it would be like a dubbel or something. Eh jokes on me. Tastes good and I may buy it again."
""
""
""
""

"O - Abbot Ale is a very formidable ale. It brings forth all that is good in caramel malts with just enough hops to balance out the sweetness."
""
""
"O - This is a nice canned English ale. Greene King is a solid brewery that imports to the U.S."
"Sweet with some fruity malt and a hint of herbal hops. The smokey character pops up in the finish with almost an astringent quality. The carbonation is almost non existent, but it suits the beer well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is really a good example of an English Pale Ale. I'm glad it is not on nitro as is doesn't seem quite as harsh. A great beer that I will be sure to come back to again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Not bad."
""
""
""
""
"I'm somewhat conflicted about this beer; I like the apple note and the smoothness of the lower carbonation, but I feel like everything is too flattened out (aroma, taste, feel) and would prefer a nitro version if it's going to be this flat and smooth. Interesting but I don't know if I'd go back for another, there are too many beers in the sea to spend more time here. Does this review make sense? I'm not sure, just as I'm not sure about this beer..."

"Poured a darker amber color with a small soapy head. Light aroma, caramel and light fruits. Taste of sweet caramel and wort, lighter notes of toffee and dried apricot. Pretty nice, but not amazing. Light-medium body, and pretty smooth going down. Not something I'd get again, but definitely not bad."
"O- A pretty big letdown. I don't know what people see in this beer. I'll take Boddington's or Old Speckled Hen in its place any day."
"It is a nice change of pace and I used it as a cooler treat for a road trip. I probably would only buy it for the same purpose."

"An outstanding English ale! Poured from a pint can. It poured a nice chestnut brown color with a small head that lasted the enitire pint. I wish i find this on tap. Creamy and rich with a classic ale smell. Zero aftertaste. High quality no doubt. Ice cold pint can single ready to go from beer world in largo on ridge rd. A new favorite."

"Overall quite tasty and to the point. Drinking up as she goes rather nicely."

"Overall: This is a well balanced English Pale Ale, a very good representative of the style. There is nothing absolutely exceptional about the taste but the ""feel"" is amazing."
""

""
""
""
""
"O- Easily drinkable, simple but still decently complex. A beer you can drink for a while without getting tired"
""
""
"O: One of the best readily available English Pale Ales. Its nothing glorious but a great daily drinker."
""
""
""
"Notes: Clean tasting, dry and mildly fruity this is a good English Pale Ale.too bad it is Nitro"
"SUBLIME, TREAT YOURSELF!"
"O: I love this beer. Nothing pretentious just an awesome classic English pale ale."
"A decent but unexceptional Pale Ale. Nicely balanced."
"starting to feel a little heavy in the belly but this is a large can at 500ml. tasting a little bit of the tin flavor i always get from canned beer."
"O - Nice and full, perfectly creamy ale. Extreme sessionability. Just the thing to go with a hot curry."
"O - A nice sweet pub ale, with a proper balance of sweet and smooth."
"made a good session beer at 11000 feet under a blinding sun"
"O: A very stable, and balanced British ale. It's not a very provocative beer - but it's just so very well-made (and priceworthy). It'd be perfect with (for example) pork chops, or when you're just hanging out with the guys. I'll have another one. Right now."
"Overall: this is a solid session beer. It's not precisely to my taste, but it is drinkable and inoffensive."
"Taste - Ripe plum and peach, soft herbal hops, and buttered bread."
"Cheers!"
"Easy drinkng, English style personified!"
"O: In a nutshell I found this Ale to be very much the same as Old Speckled Hen. Perhaps a little more hoppy. Yet with the same high quality."
"Overall: Very pleasant. The bitterness is not overwhelming; seems to be well-balanced. The initial skunkiness is not off-putting. I'd drink it again."
"This beer pours out as an amber color with a creamy looking off white head. The lacing is minimal on the glass. The smell has some grassy caramel sweetness with some grainy malts in there too. The taste is a smooth creamy earth flavors, grainy, not much hops. The mouthfeel is very smooth, not much carbonation at all."
"O - decent english pale ale - enjoyed the mouthfeel and appearance the most"
"O: Overall very enjoyable, but not something I would likely by a lot of. A good example of some English traits, but perhaps not the greatest example."
"O/D - Standard quality English ale. Highly drinkable and fairly tasty without being a knockout."
"Overall: You know, it is rather tangy. Then bland. But initially tangy!"
"Overall – This beer is very well balanced and extremely drinkable. I’m happy I gave it a try and will surely pick some up again."
"O - across the board a real stand up English brew, Ill definitely keep an eye out for it in the future"
"O: This is tasty and good. It's one of the better English ales I've had and might be better with a nitro widget."
"Dr: It slides down easily enough, but it costs too much. Give it a go."
"D: Very easy drinking and well-balanced; a prime session ale."
"Pours flat-looking, then does the amazing head-formation thing, which is always cool. A lot of bubble-cling on the sides of the glass, and the beer itself is nice amber-honey with a cream head. Smell is rather muted, some mineral and lightly toasted, crackery malt. Taste is good and mellow, and yeasty. Rounded malts balanced with a slightly spicy hops. Smooth feel, maybe a bit flat per the can-style, but very easy to drink."
"Had this on cask after a Duelle Teve on tap. Twas a good beer drinking night! It is a totally well balanced beer. Not much fragrance, maybe from the cask. The head is almost soapy in appearance (not taste) - interesting. It is a more savory beer. The taste is fantastic definitely buttery, a bit salty even with a very slight toasted flavor. Like a cold buttery crossant just out of the oven. Subtle hops. With many of my favorite options on tap, I kept going to this one in cask. Truely brilliant!"
"D - This is a very easy drinking brew, and is especially good paired with spicy food."
"LCBO can- Pours slightly hazy yellow, with a medium sized white cap. Aromas of subtle english hops, white bread, some sugars. FLavours are fairly hoppy for what it is (Challenger?), herbal/floral leafy greens, touch of cookie dough, some varsol? Bitter fruity/sweet finish. The best out of the new batch of UK beers at the LCBO."

"I had quite a bit of this on tap in the UK on my honeymoon. I love it and still buy it on occasion."
"D - Very drinkable, definitely very smooth and easy to drink."
"D: Good drinkability. Good session beer"
"All in all, this is a pretty dang good EPA. Full flavored and very drinkable."
"Appearance has a nice deep copper amber with a thin but creamy head. Smell has that light English aroma of lightly sweet malts and low hops. Taste is lightly sweetened malt, bready with a light hop twang. Mouthfeel is a creamy medium with light carbonation. Overall a nicely balanced English ale thats easy to enjoy."
"Remember this brand from on tap in England. I was amazed to see the brand in my local beer store. Beautiful appearance, lovely balance of malt and hop flavors. Smooth, clean, with a substantial alcohol content and satisfying without heaviness. A fair value for an import, and a fine drink."
"Medium body, with a great cask mouthfeel that is soft and creamy. Is there alcohol in this? Surely does not feel that way. Excellent example of an English cask beer. Glad I tried."
"A reminiscing beer, one to put back a few as the night draws on. Delicious."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, it might not be the absolute best beer in the style but it's solid enough to be worth drinking for a long time."
"D - An interesting taste which makes drinkability suffer a touch. The effervescence was higher than expected in an English brew. I like the 'flatter' English ales like Caffreys, Boddington..."
"D very good and worth a second pull. 4"
"A very pleasant beer from a can. It's not stellar, but nicely balanced and crafted."
"Half finger of cream to eggshell white color, mostly dense foam with a few larger bubbles here and there, retention not an issue since not much to start from, no stick to the lacing, however, it does slide down in an extremely solid sheet. Creamy nose feel with a sour, lactose edge, banana pudding and milk, green apples and pears, hard toffee candies, somewhat floral yet you can't really say there's any hop-driven bite, the malt seems to win by default, smattering of mixed spices, stutters too much. Medium-bodied, for all the fluff and creaminess cannot achieve deeper mouth presence, carrot and celery notes there as much as toffee, butterscotch or cocoa. The hops are weak and cannot come close to lending spine to the whole. Little bit of citrus, the carbonation is soft and kind of a wuss. You get a very clear message which makes you think it is as it should be. Allowing for this, not this imbiber's cup of tea and pretty damn glad the glass is close to empty."
"Nice creamy carbonation, very low though."
"This is my very first review for the BA."
"Pours a pale orange with huge, thick white head. Head doesn't want to dissipate at all, leaving rings of lacing after sips. Smells of floral hops with toffee and caramel malt balancing it out. Nice bitterness in the flavour. Very creamy mouthfeel, makes this a smooth drinker. I had this on cask last year and preferred it, but still enjoyed the can."
"O: Nice to drink, but nothing special."
"Drinkability: Despite the faint hops and lack of carbonation, this beer really tastes good. Quite impressive."
"D: A good session ale, refreshing, but in my opinion could do with less spice in the flavor."
"Drinkability: Everything I expect from a good everyday English Ale. This deserves more attention in the US (I think it sells a lot in England on draft)."
"Goes down easy, but too thin to want to chase these one after another. Decent flavors, odd intensities. Worth a try."
"Notes: I was looking for a little more definition from both the malt and the hops but overall it was still enjoyable and easy to drink."
"This beer was exceptionally smooth and the primary elements of the taste mirrored its smell. Up front there is a pleasant hop/floral taste and a candied fruit element. I also detected the trademark diacetyl taste I find in many English beers and the (what I find to be) delightful taste imparted from the hard water. The beer had an excellent hop-malt balance that made it easy drinking. There was minimal carbonation, that added to the smoothness. Found it to be enjoyable, so I ordered a second."
"Pours a cloudy reddish tan with a very small amount of head. The aroma is very bready. The taste is malty with a small hint of hoppy flavoring. After I got over the flatness characteristic to the style, the beer really started to grow on me. Each sip I enjoyed the beer more. There really isn't much aftertaste at all as I finish through the beer. I really enjoyed this and might go out of my way to try this again."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is very flat and a bit creamy, nitro would do great things for this beer. The beer grew on me and would call this a very drinkable beer to enjoy."
"Very easy to drink. A very refreshing beer for a Saturday afternoon."
"500ml can from the LCBO. Pours a tawny burnt orange with dark golden hues and a thin white cap. Smell and taste are mild fruit, marmalade, floral and metallic hops, toffee, whole wheat biscuit, tangy and bittersweet finish. Mouthfeel is silky, lighter than medium, excellent hop bite, dryly citric and cracker-like aftertaste. There's some warmth going down as well. A basic but satisfying EPA, similar to the draught version of Headstrong Pale Ale. Good example of the style."
"Smells like some molasses and a hint of licorice. Pours to a deep golden color with a thin off white head. Taste is a tangy mix of maltiness and noble hops with a large presence of currant. Aftertaste is both sweet and bitter, balanced to say the most. Mouthfeel is a little thin and watery but this brew makes up for it in unique flavor. If this brew had a decent backbone it would be quite good. All in all a good drinker but I must downgrade for the lack of backbone."
"The aroma is sweet with caramel, toffee, yeast, lightly roasted malt, and a tiny bit of hops. The appearance is amber with an average head. The taste is like the aroma but it is also a bit fruity and astringent. The palate is smooth. Overall this is not as good as I remember it the first time I had it."
"Beer is full bodied, no real bitterness to detect, forward sweetness. Serious body. No carbonation in the palate to speak of but it doesn't need it. There is almost a fruity sweetness in the midpalate. Second taste, there is some lingering malt in the back of the mouth that nearly gives rise to an aftertaste. Overall its an unoffensive decent beer. Drinkability is good, its a little heavy methinks, otherwise its fine."
"I'm not a big fan of EPA's, but this one really stands out from the bunch I've had. Fruity, refreshing, and an easy quaffer. I think this would be great to have on tap. For the style, two thumbs up, and definitely recommended."
"Poured into a shaker pint. Pours a clear honey amber color with a very small off-white head that retains well and laces nicely. Caramel malty aroma. Sweet caramel malt flavor with a sweet finish, a very mild taste. Very low carbonation, almost reminds me of a cask ale. Very easy drinking and pleasant taste. Highly recommend this one."
"Pours a rather luminous pale amber with medium to thick head that is rather creamy. Nose is pretty much non-existent. Cannot detect any identifiable properties. On the palate there's a gentle, soft malty & biscuity flavor with light hop bitterness for balance. Easy drinking, and almost watery in fact which isn't appealing."
"D: Very drinkable. Could be quite sessionable, and the touch of spices and dryness make it a bit interesting."
"Interesting flavor and is quite British...the fruity ale yeast is complemented by a fair amount of toffee malts and mild floral hops. Bread dough is very prevalent. This is a decent drinker, but nothing I would want to purchase on a regular basis. Tastes like a good cask ale that does not translate well to life in a can."
"In all an average or above average beer."
"Contains plenty of character, without sacrificing the easy-drinking qualities that make it so enjoyable."
"Drinkability - quite high, the lower carbonation can = a good session offering, quite a bit of flavour here without feeling too heavy.. could go for a few of these if needed"
"D - Good. This is a good balanced English pale ale; pretty flavourful yet not heavy."
"One of my favourite widely-available English pales. Would love to try this one on draught!"
"This beer was good enough, I just felt like I wished there was just more taste to it, or a richer taste. I guess maybe I was expecting a little more from an English beer, they seem to have so many good ones that come across the pond."
"Poured from a 16.9 oz. can. Has a brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some malts. Taste is hoppy, bitter and somewhat sour. Feels light in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall not a terrible beer, but I was expecting a bit more from it."
"Updated November 18/09: The latest batch is in a can with puple colour instead of orange. Still a good beer and the hops are now more identifiable as ""earthy"" to me - not my favourite hopping flavour but still a good beer."
"Drinkability is high on this one, with enough character to keep you interested but not so much that you'd burn out on it. In theory. I'm only having the one tonight. Bugger."
"Drinkability: A perfect example of how an English Bitter should be, truly world class."
"D- Very drinkable... but I would expect the sweetness to become too much if several were consumed in one sitting..."
"D: A really nice one. Not the best on the market but I'll buy this one again."
"Very nice beer, not much going on flavor-wise, but very smooth and session-able."
"The mouth feel is medium in body, with sharp crispness, a little slick, and finally wetting to the palate."
"Not a bad pale ale, but it gets a little too clammy after a while."
"Light amber body with a very thin white head. Maybe it was just my nose or the particular can I bought, but there really wasn’t any distinct aroma that I could smell. Taste was fairly simple, some sweet malts with a hoppy aftertaste. Goes down smooth enough, no complaints there. Overall a decent beer, but nothing special."
"Drinkability is great. The scent is a definate downer but I could drink alot of this."
"How can a beer look so good and taste so blah. Poured a beautiful ruby red with a thin white head. Smell was quite alot like wheat and taste was nothing but bland wheat. This greatly hindered the drinkability. Beer was at least smooth though sadly that and its looks were all it had going for it."
"Very unimpressed with this ale and surprised it wasn't in a nitro-can. Very normal amber color with a bare minimal head after the pour that faded into edge lacing quickly. A bit of hops on the nose and maybe a bit of bread but so faint. It wasn't bad on the nose though, just fairly non-existent. About the same on the tongue with a bit more hoppiness coming through. Well carbonated and consistent over the tongue so it has that."
"Served in a Guinness pint glass; color is a clear tan-amber with a thick white head. Enjoyable nose that primarily says malt. Taste is an easy drinking, tea-like experience; a light, balanced hops/malt combination. Goes down very easily, and finishes without an obtrusive aftertaste. Seems like a great beer to drink while playing darts in a dark pub somewhere."
"EDIT: can not bottle. Also second can had huge head which held it's own, the extra head helped me warm up to this beer."
"Basically, this beer tasted to me as good as Boddington's did the first time I had it on tap. I can't say much for Boddington's nowadays, but what I can say is that Abbot Ale is everything that B'dington's SHOULD be."
"Pours a clear, amber/yellow color. 1/3 inch head of an off-white color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of earthy malt, English hops, slight biscuit, and very slight yeast aromas. Fits the style of an English Pale Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with a high carbonation level. Tastes of earthy malt up front, then some yeast cleanliness, and some strong English hops come through next. A dry finish dominates the feel. Overall, a little on the watery side, but a decent beer nonetheless."
"I don't even think I would dare to try this on tap in England. It was that nasty."
"Of all the dreadfully bastardized English bitters I've had from can, this one is far from the worst offender. I'll grant it some nice, distinctive attributes and the fact that, all considered, it is an enjoyable enough pint to drink. That said, I really don't plan on donating any more money to the Abbot, unless maybe I go to England and meet him in person."
"D= Certainly a very sessionable and tasty ale. I would have again if in the mood for a totally fuggled-up English ale with a nice balance and soft mouthfeel."
"Drinkability- Light and sessionable if you like this flavor. Earthy and sour qualities are not for me."
"A decent pale ale that comes in a can. It's nice and simple but otherwise, not much to see."
"MF&D - nothing special. could be a bit thicker and a bit more carbonation."
"Same great mouthfeel and drinkability. Recommended for fans of Old Speckled Hen, Fursty Ferret, etc."
"Tastes like a better version of bass to me"
"Overall a tasty treat from England."
"Overall- Smooth and easily sessionable. A good beer to start your day with."
"Pours a clear amber with minimal white head; appear lowly carbonated, but body is smoothly textured. Tastes of a very yummy earthiness: loam and wood, sweet malts, a vegetable bitterness. A very drinkable beer that goes with nearly any food and is perfect for a session. Doesn't need to be super cold to be enjoyable. I'm definitely a fan."
"Taste is sweet roasted smokey malts with a good amount of bitter hops. Great mouthfeel and excellent drinkability, esp. at 5.0% abv. Great British brew."
"Greene King Abbot Ale definitely goes down as one of my favorites."
"Drinkability - this strikes me as highly drinkable wiuthout ever being boring. The only risk I could think of is how rich it is... something to savour in due moderation."
"Drinkability: More an ESB than a pale ale in my book, this is nevertheless an enjoyable session beer"
"D- one of my favorite styles for a session, this one is good but i've had better. wouldn't turn one down though!"
"D: On the whole, a solidly made pale ale. Not my favorite by any means, but good."
"Overall: Nice elements, I just wish they were turned up a notch."
"Nothing to get really excited about"
"Very good flavor and refreshing. One of the best in its style."
"Authentic..."
"I love this brew. It's just really fresh and balanced. Quite a nice canned treat."
"D: Definitely a decent session beer. Low on carbonation, but decent body. Goes down almost too easy."
"Light medium body, light effervescence. A solid British brew."
"500mL can purchased from LCBO in Toronto. Pours a clear, medium gold with little head. Decent malty aroma. Enjoyed on a warm night, just after finishing some work and before a downpour started - so I could be ""refreshing beer"" biased. I'm even having it fridge-cold. And it IS hitting the spot right now. Not complicated. Smooth upfront with decent maltiness, turning into fruity English hoppiness as it goes down. Better than I expected."
"A nice session brew. Tasty enough that I wish I had more than one. Worth a try."
"A tasty and easy drinking English Pale."
"Not a bad beer, but not particularly essential, either. It had been a while since I'd consumed an English Pale Ale, so it made for an interesting change of pace. My last beer from Greene King was Old Speckled Hen, consumed from cask (my first time - from cask, anyway!) at a pub on Denmark Hill in London. Maybe I'd have appreciated this more that way. It's a little too sweet for session drinking, and not interesting enough for me to go back to as a stand-alone beer, either. For a bit of atmosphere I grabbed the closest at-hand CD that happened to be by an English band. This turned out to be ELP's Tarkus, which is ""busy"" in a way that I think would work better with an IPA. Perhaps that's why I found myself wishing the hops were more assertive, instead of my palate being permanently corrupted by west coast-versions of the style!"
"This beer is a beautiful deep amber colour and poured with a fluffy head which disintegrated within about 5 minutes of pouring. The first taste was a revelation, a balance of malt and fruit with just enough hop to make you long for a Ploughman's lunch in an English meadow in July. In the aftertaste there is sufficent zest so as not to leave your mouth feeling as though it is coated with treacle. With a fragrant bouquet and superb drinkability, this is an excellent ale."
"Drinkability is excellent. Overall, a delicious brew that is nice and complex yet remains easy to quaff and enjoy in quantity. A great example of an English pale ale - let it warm up to cellar temps and the flavors really shine through with the low carbonation. I could drink this all day and night."
"Drinkability. Smooth mouthfeel and clean finish make it very drinkable."
"D: I could go all night. (thats what she said)"
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"The finish features the hops as well, there's a light tickle of malt sweetness, and it's rather dry. Medium-thin mouthfeel, obviously a creamy, but not a great English pale."
"I'm hesitant to post a review of this stuff because the only two times I tried it were in the London Gatwick airport, and on both occasions it tasted as though this stuff had been sitting in the bottom of the keg for about Lord knows how long before I got to it. There was pretty much zero carbonation and it was very sour, which leads me to believe that I am correct in my assumption that both were spoiled batches (it was an airport, after all). I'll give it another shot if I can find it in a store stateside."
"This brew is a copper color and holds a thick tan head. The nose has soft sweet malts and some floral hops. The flavor profile starts with piney hops and has a mild sweet malt profile. Light crisp body is clean over the palate. A good English pale to wash down a meal."
"I tried this beer on May 9, 2008 after purchasing from the Queen's Quay LCBO outlet. The beer poured a translucent rusty brown colour with a thin white head. The aroma was caramel malt, a little hops, and some nuttiness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, slightly creamy, with little carbonation. The flavour is nutty, malty, with some hoppy bitterness"
"D: Good drinkability, moderately enjoyable, smooth with a nice clean malting and light bitterness makes this good for a few."
"A perfect strong ale."
"The taste is similar, with the same qualities noted in the aroma. It has an amazing sweet-bitter quality that is wonderfully balanced, being both at the same time. It's very tasty, with a great feel, never bland, and exceeddingly smooth and drinkable."
"Drinkability: Nice easy drinking English pale ale."
"It poured with a finger's worth of lovely ecru head that experienced good retention. The nose had a pleasant sweetness to it, like mild honey, or better yet, honeysuckle! The color was a deep honey-gold with NE-quality clarity. The mouthfeel was medium with a mild sweetness on the tongue. The finish had a slight bitterness, but enough to sustain the likes of me. I'd like to try this in an N2 can."
"D - Easily drinkable. Good malt character, though it may be a bit weak on hop flavor and aroma."
"D = This is a very enjoyable, drinkable pale ale, I definitely recommend it for a relaxing, relatively low ABV beer."
"1pt. .9oz Bomber was even more tasty than the can!"
"Drinkability- The more that is drank, the more it feels like can be drank. This is a wonderful beer, likely the 2nd best I've ever had from Greene King with the first being Ruddles County. I'll be pursuing more of this one in the future for sure."
"The beer poured a healthy amber with a nice bit of off white head. The aroma was of bicuity malt with a hint of floral hops. The taste was nice biscuit malt and a clean hop finish. The feel was medium a bit wet, but a dry finish. A nice beer that would make for a wonderful session."
"D - A very drinkable brew in my opinion..enjoyed very much"
"D - This is a great session brew, or pub brew as the English might say. This won't floor you with complexity or bash you over the head with outrageous flavors, but it is a study in balance and ""pleasant"" flavors. This is an all around good beer."
"In one swift opening of the can, the beer pours into a pint glass, leaving a filtered copper/orange with a creamy head on top. Diacetyl and faint esters make up the aroma. The taste, while a little metallic from sitting in the can, is enjoyable and easy on the palate. Again, mellow fruity esters and a little diacetyl mixed in. After a couple sips, the metallic taste vanishes, and paired with a smooth low carbonated feel, becomes a quaffer's delight."
"Pours a clear amber color with a thing frothy off white head. The aroma is weak. It lacks character all around, but some malt notes are apparent. Taste is alright. There is a slight hop bitterness with a mild sweet maltiness. Mouthfeel is thin and kind of boring, it lacks carbonation. Drinkability is fairly high though with low alcohol levels and simple flavors. I enjoyed it more as I drank and really enjoyed it as it warmed slightly."
"If you're not looking for humongous pale ale flavor, this is very drinkable. Found it enjoyable and would love to try it on tap in its homeland. Give it a chance...like I said, it's a real grower with a surprising bit of depth for what is usually a pretty simple style."
"Would be perfect to session."
"Drinkability: This is a lovely, light yet flavorsome ale with a full-on British character. I wish we could get more beers like this in Japan."
"16.9 oz. pub can - color of clear honey, with a thick tanish colored head - nose of light malts, cherry, and vanilla  taste of malt, light hops, and some red fruit - body is medium, and with light carbonation  aftertaste of vegetation , and coffee grounds"
"Reviewed 10-28-2007, translated from french 1-6-2008."
"D: Very drinkable - my favorite pale ale so far. I'll be buying more of this."
"Still, a nice beer with character and not too overpowering."
"D - Not for me thanks. Kind of one-dimensional and harsh."
"good drinkability... a good beer to fill up your imperial pint glass with, sit back and enjoy, and not think too hard about."
" Overall I was very impressed with this little brew that I really did not even know that I had. It was quite good and defiantly something worth taking a shot at. I would defiantly recommend trying this one If you can, it might surprise you a bit as it comes through with a lot more quality then I thought it would."
"Can: Poured a clear medium brown color ale with a small bubbly head with limited retention. Aroma of malt is slightly sweet with little hops distinguishable. Taste was also dominated by some discreet sweet malt with a dry ending. Body was about average with some average carbonation. A bit boring overall and would have profited from having more English hops to provide some floral notes."
"D: Very high."
"I had this on a couple occasions in England and it was never very exciting on tap, either. A fairly standard ale."
"Clear, amber with a flash of cherry depending on your lighting. Inch thick off-white head kept going by a host of lazy, slow moving bubbles. Sweet smell ... or is that malt? Smooth mouthfeel. Balanced bitterness, citrus overtones, fruity with an aftertaste of tangerine and a lingering, bitter finish ... hmmm, I could drink this more often. The carbonation did die down before I reached the end of the glass. That aroma had me a bit mystified, it was musty one moment and spearmint the next ... it's all good though, a pleasant and satisfying ale."
"All in all, good, but nothing special. A respectable reading of the style without any flourish."
"not horrible, but kind of average. definitely ""english"" though, esp. with those cider-like qualities."
"Went down easy. Overall the beer is appealing but no qualities that are outstanding by themselves. A solid, quaffable English ale."
"The beer had a medium mouthfeel, about right for its style, however the taste completely put me off this beer. I managed to force a quarter of the pint before giving up and moving onto another. This beer obviously has its fans, but I am not one. I strongly recommend asking for a taster before ordering a pint."
"Pours with a small head and not much in the lacing department. Has an amber like colour. Smells a bit metallic, some malt but I cant pick up much else. My mouth also has a hard time with this one, malty/sweet with some fading earth like notes. Not at the top of my list, but its no where near the bottom."
"Drinkability- Quite nice. The mouthfeel and taste work well together."
"This is one nice brew - not the best but pretty solid across the board. Nothing to complain about but nothing that is going to win first place either."
"Definately not my style of beer, but I could drink a pint of one (1) of these."
"Poured out of a can (that I thought to be nitro, but no widget?) a medium to a deep amber color with a white head. In the nose, hints of sweet malt, a bit citrusy, and a small lingering of tea. In the taste, I got a carmel-ish malt sweetness. It stays on the palate for a while. It is hardy tasting, but yet a lot sessionish. Lots of sticky lacing left in the glass."
"I could session this and not get bored with it as the night went on."
"This would make a good session beer."
"D: Solid cask ale, not overly complex, but certainly pleasant and nice english flavor"
"I really enjoyed the taste of this beer. Not great in all respects, but overall quite solid. It would certainly work well as a session beer. Will get this again, and recommend it to others."
"This has been a favorite of mine. Arguably one of the best more readily available session beers out there. Had only their price not recently gone up"
"Final Grade: 4.07, an A-."
"D- I don't like this much at all. It just isn't my style of beer? Does look good though."
"A very drinkable treat. Just like ice tea or pale ales."
"D - 5.0 I could drink this all day and night."
"in Switzerland I get this one in cans only and as such it is my medium price favorite ale .... finally (visiting England once again) I got to drink this one out of a bottle ... must say the difference is quite astonishing ... the flavors are fuller and more lucent ... an already great brew now truly reveals it's marvels ...."
"The pour into my Fuller's nonic raises a 1.5 finger head, the color of aged paper. The body has a nice amber-copper color, and there's nice lacing to boot. The nose has a mild bread, caramel, maple, and vanilla aroma. They're very comforting. This is a beer for deep draughts. It has a wonderful toasted caramel flavor, with just the right amount of sweetness. That seems to be it, but it's done so well. The mouth is exceptionally smooth, with both light body and carbonation. A very fine ale, and I wish I could sit in front of a hand pump and drink this all day."
"drinkability is good. the bitterness is moderate, but lingers. well balanced and enjoyable."
"Not too bad. I'd have it again."
"I remember drinking this one ten years ago, and I swear I could taste snuff (tobacco) back then. Nothing remotely close to that this time. Nice beer though. A good beer to finnish a night out. Delicate and light, but with taste and edge."
"Weak and undefined taste from front to finish...disappointing..like experiencing a cold glass of weak watery tea. I wouldnt even cook with this."
"D - Solid; the sweetness might mean I wouldn't drink too many, but overall a good beer with a lot of flavor, for me better than a lot of other English ales"
"Compentent, but not distinguished or memorable."
"Lovely toffee and red colour, with a thick two finger head that lasts. Some lacing to the glass, as well as a settled ring after every sip. Slight smell of malts, fruits, flowers and tea. Smooth flavour, with plenty of rich malts and a bit of alcohol. Their is a raw hop presence at the finish. Enough to balance the grains. Mouthfeel is smooth, with a slight dry finish. An excellent beer."
"An all-round good beer."
"Pours a clear copper, some orange, thick off white head, creamy looking, settles to a thin layer, lacing. Smell is toffee, sugar sweetness, citrus/floral, nice aroma. Taste is sweet, earthy, some toffee, thick citrus/floral flavour through the middle, almost sherrylike, medicinal finish, some bitterness. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, low carbonation, pretty smooth. Average Brit ale the LCBO loves to get, nothing special."
"This is very good for a canned English ale. Its good hop presence and some decent malt complexity. Maybe there should be a little less diactel, but its still very tastey."
"D: Fair. I'd have it again, but I'd like to try it from a nitro source first."
"D- Easy just not much to this."
"This beer has a nice apple phenol smell. Appearance was above average. Taste was slightly dry and almost cidery. However, it was very crisp and refreshing. It was fairly easy to drink, but I asked the question, ""Do I want another?"" No I really would rather have something else."
"Other reviews suggest more was to be found , so was it because it had travelled or because it was in a can ?"
"Cask conditioned at the Robin Hood & Little John, Cherry Hinton, Cambridge (a Greene King pub). Copper coloured, minimal carbonation. Moderate caramel and malt vinegar aroma. Malty flavour, caramel, low bitterness. ABV is well hidden. OKish, but not really exciting. Disappointing held up to my (failing?) memory of the bottled/canned version. The Old Speck is a better choice."
"A few years back I put a pint or two of this away in a pub in Bury St Edmunds, just a block from the brewery. That was great. This is a pretty good substitute, half a world away..."
"Could drink this stuff all night long. Full bodied, full flavor, yet mild mannered and smooth."
"Clockwork"
"A big miss and a big mess."
"Light to medium in body, the mouthfeel is watery, yet smooth. Good drinkability with mild ABV, it's worth a try for this style beer."
"Served on tap at the Old Ship in Fullerton, CA. Pale orange color and fluffy/dense white 3 finger head was beautful. Smell was faint, as would be reflected by the taste of the hops in the beer. Now, understanding this is an english pale ale, I think the lack of hops was pretty reflective.... don't get me wrong, there is still some bitterness and english hop aroma here which is nice. There was some sweetness detecable, and was enjoyable, even in a pale ale. Mouthfeel was pretty light- almost watery thin, not carbonated much, with a very, very dry finish, which would limit the drinkability to me."
"Poured very nicely into a pint glass, dark golden/reddish/brown hue, with a creamy offwhite head about a half inch think. The head lasted well and left decent lacing. The smell wasn't particularly strong, but was sweet and had notes of butterscotch, and caramel. The taste was simlar to what the smell suggests, sweet with caramel flavour, with a slight bitter edge at the end. The mouthfeel is nice, if just a little watery at times, and carbination is low. I found the beer very drinkable, and overall enjoyed it a lot, and would definately pick it up again."
"This was okay, but nothing about it would make me want to try another. I can see why this is also put in the nitro-can. I might buy it if I see it in that form, just to compare, but it is not smooth enough, nor tasty enough, for me to get it otherwise."
"Quite similar to most nitro pub ales. Extremely thick and rich looking with dense nitro carbonation and a beer flavored whipped cream on top. Aromas are very light of caramelized malts. Tastes similar with a subtle English Pale Ale spiciness and bittering. The nitro dulls the flavors quite a bit, but really amps up the body. Very creamy and silky smooth texture. If this beer were a little bolder in the flavor and aroma, it would be killer."
"Huge white head after an aggresive pour into a Sam Smith tulip. Body is clear copper, much carbonation visible. Light grain and a little sweet hoppiness, not a lot going on. Taste is mild and slightly bitter, metallic and a little sour. Not the best beer I have had. I would pass on this again, kind of boring, even vs. the style."
"From can into pint glass. Full frothy head. Had good appearance and was somewhat spicy at first. Tapred off to somewhat watery at mid glass., but had a good, fairly long finish. All their cans come with a peice of plastic inside, apparently to help retain carbonation (?). Caught me off guard. An interesting beer to try."
"Good friendly and relaxing British pale ale."
"Pretty drinkable though nitro-can beers generally aren't among my favorites. A very creamy, mild english bitter of sorts that sure is fun to look at..."
"D - high, a smooth poundable beer, i like this can very much"
"Pretty darn drinkable; this one needs to warm a little above fridge temp, but not to much or you start getting stale beer tastes/essence. Not nears as good as the stu ff i was getting in the early 90s on handpump, but not bad. Very nice canned ale."
"Mouth feel is watery and under carbonated."
"mouth is heavy, nothing there to help clean up. Carbonation is almost non existent and I drank this fast considering the writeup."
"Came in a 500 ml bottle. Poured a nice amber color with a head that dissipated quickly. Really a nicely balanced English ale flavor. Has a nice taste of hoppiness that does not overwhelm. I really like this beer, I would definitely drink it again. Absolutely worth a try."
"Flavor is pleasant, but very mild. Gentle malts, grainy, bready, with a very light hop bite at the end. I like this beer, very easy to drink, but not as complex and interesting as some others I've had from tap in the UK."
"Very traditional English ale, similar to my memories of the ales I had in London, although the atmosphere in front of my monitor writing this isn't quite the same."
"Copper colored with a medium creamy head. Aroma has equal parts of malt and hops. Fruity character and flavor. Medium body, long finish. Sweetish & malty with typical notes of nuts and caramel and only a discreet bitterness. Smooth and quite enjoyable!"
"Opinion: Well...I am not a huge fan of British Ales, but I just have to keep trying them to make sure. This is about a session beer, and one that I imagine you can put back upwards of a case of until you start catching a buzz. I think that I'll stick to Bocks for now."
"Bham UK"
"It pours a lovely copper colour with a thick, frothy tan head that just won't go away. The smell is really nice. I was expecting a sweet malty smell, but it's suprisingly well balanced and hops are evident. Those bitter, English sort of hops. The taste is Englishy and creamy and bitter. Those were the adjectives I first thought of. The taste is a bit caramel, followed by roasted barley, followed by bittering hops (Fuggles is my guess). Lacing coats the side of the glass like a sheet. Mouthfeel is creamy and slightly heavy, and drinkability is affected a little by the heavyness. All in all, a really good beer that I think I'll have again someday."
"Drinkability: Nice. It's a very good example of an English bitter. Reminds me of some nights spent sampling good bitters in London."
"Notes: nothing special, just good all around English ale"
"I always enjoy an Abbot Ale! No matter the time of year, where I am, what kind of mood Im in, its just plain good and friendly. It's a very consistent performer."
"Pours like most Nitro beers. White creamy head that lasts, rich amber color. Tastes of caramel malts and English floral hops. Nice balanced smell and taste. Nothing exceptional but it is better than most canned alternatives. goes nice with salt air and concerts on the beach!"
"Mouthfeel: it's rounded and throughout, but a bit sugary in the finish; medium-full flavoured ale with a quite balanced body b/w pale and crystal malts and bitter hops. A very quaffable strong bitter!"
"D - I have found my new hiking/picnic out door beer, when i dont want to carry bottles. Great stuff."
"Can obtained from the discount bin of a local liquor store. Opens with a hissing and pours th entire glass as a light yellowish cascading head. Took a couple minutes to settle to a fantasticly fine clingy light yellow head over a crystal clear apricot orange colored liquid. Smells malty sweet with caramel and an orangish hoppy aroma. Butterscotch and peaches. Tastes orange grassy hoppy playing in tune with an emerging malty caramel sweet. Diacetyl is here as is a bit of dry grainy finish (some tannins?). A bit of hay and fresh unbaked pizza dough. Md-light body with mild carbonation. The head has amazing staying power, as I think it hasn't gotten any smaller this whole time."
"All in all I think I'm done with Nitro-Charged English Pale Ales. There as so many high quality bottled EPA's that don't seem to need the aid of a widget and I think I'll stick with those..."
"It was enjoyable, safe. I would drink it again."
"Thin lasting head on a transparent dark orange copper color body. The smell is enjoyably mellow, nicely malty and woody with light fruity notes of hops. The taste shows a rich and round maltiness getting slightly chocolaty with light winy notes. A strong fruity character mixes cherries, ripe raspberries and a light sweet hint of lemon. The mouthfeel is round an rich with a sweet chewy hoppiness. Quite drinkable, character-full for the style, and overall very enjoyable."
"**reading other reviews, I've got it! Caramel Apple!"
"The taste is quite alright but just not great. sweet, but not far beyond that, seeming much more of a session thirst quencher than a tasteful brew. weak on the hops which are practically unpercievable at the end and- again with 'em brits- the carbonation is almost unexistent to the point of making it dull."
"Creamy mouthfeel and it goes down smooth."
"An ok beer, not outstanding."
"Not too bad, this makes a fair session beer. A little more hops would be appreciated. Also, since they got rid of the nitro, this is now one of the few good canned beers around, something to take to the pool or beach where glass isn't allowed."
"Drinkability  The smooth, session-like quality of this ale helped it along nicely, although the flavors were very different and at times even a bit funky."
"A regarded brewery, but this one needs Costello. Hop bubbles, too simplic, bitter and thin mouthfeel and nothing in taste. Maybe this works fresh and cask-conditioned, but was difficult to finish. Had it again two years later and it certainly was no better."
"Per GK website: Abbot Ale is brewed with pale crystal and amber malts to give an attractive colour and rich malty taste. Challenger hops give it bitterness with a spicy overtone and to really boost the taste and aroma to the maximum it is late-hopped with Fuggles to provide the floral tones and fruity esters. 5% ABV."
"Not a bad beer, a few complaints but I'd drink it again no problem."
"The nitro head is cream-colored and dense. Nice. The beer is clear, rosy amber. Sticky, thick sheets and mountains of lacing. Nice buttery, nutty nose with a little ink. A buttery caramel front leads to a thick, creamy, malty, rich middle. The slightly metallic finish has telltale nitro inkiness, but still manages some nice butter. There's actually quite a bit of flavor. I like it."
"Red (new graphics) Nitro can with widget, that produces the frothy super thick head and creamy mouthfeel of this brew. Tons of lacing, and tons of sheets of lace all over this quaffer. Notes of maple, caramel, vanilla up front, smooth and satisfying. The mouthfeel is what this brew is all about. Finish is long, creamy and, suprise, smooth. Decent, if somewhat bland, sessioner."
"Pretty drinkable, but a little too sweet. And metallic. Maybe could use more hoppiness and/or freshness."
"Notes: I've drank these before, but it's been a while. I thought I had remembered that these were better than this experience. Maybe my tastes have evolved or maybe something has changed since a few years ago. Cheers!"
"Pours translucent copper with a small tan head which evaporates quickly, leaving a film and light lace. Nose is sweet caramel malt; attractive if quite simplistic. Straight-forward caramel malt flavors with slightly sparse hop finish. Taste is two-dimensional at best, but not unpleasant. Creamy but somewhat thin body. Easy to drink, but not particularly outstanding. Not something I'd rush to buy in preference to more interesting brews."
"Nice maltiness, very creamy, worth a shot, especially out of a cask."
"Drinkability: a good solid cask ale, and a nice session beer"
"from the nitro can. poured copper with a smooth med size head that lasted a very long time.flavor sweet citrus, honey, caramel, malts, peaches. flavor,very weak caramel, floral, dryness. was disappointed I was hoping that aroma would be present in the flavor."
"It tastes very creamy and sweet. It's a really good English Style ale as it does not have the ""funk"" that is present in some others. It's similar to Boddingtons in taste."
"-Oelergud"
"738"
"A pleasant easy to drink brew that is really mellow, a good choice for most foods."
"It wasnt great before, and now they've started bottled in clear bottles...silly chaps"
"Drinkability - Expected a bit better. Just didn't have good complexity and transitions."
"Nothing to get excited about. Golden amber when served, it came with a thick cream of a head, which after reflection might have been the best part. Mostly all malt, it had an interesting green apple aftertaste. Not awful, but nothing I need to get again in a hurry."
"I first had this beer in England right near where it is brewed. It is much better fresh from the tap, but it still does well out of the can. When I am looking for an english nitro ale this is usually first on my list."
"Very good. Poured a nutty light brown with a very very thick and creamy head. Smell was quite malty. The taste, too, was very malty and had a very creamy consistency. Very similar to Wexford Irish Cream Ale if you have ever had that before. Overall, I was quite impressed with this one. Very smooth and very easy to drink, providing you like this style. Will likely buy again."
"Recommended if you like English beer."
"It poured a hazy brownish color with a large head (it is nitro) and lots of lacing. The aroma is one of malt and alcohol but little else. The taste to me is just bland. It tastes somewhat like a Boddington's but I think Boddington's has more flavor. It is medium bodied and can be drunk for a long time, but I didn't want to."
"Good drinkability. Not very complex, but extremely well balanced. Certainly, a different approach for a pale ale, as this one is a departure from most British and British style American pale ales I've sampled."
"This pale ale poured a hazy, amber color with creamy, off-white nitrogen foam that clung to the glass. The smell was modest: lightly malty. The taste was a bit thin but was malty with a slight tanginess and a chalky dry finish. The mouthfeel was dry and smooth with medium-light body and low carbonation. There was a mild lingering aftertaste. This was an OK beer, but thin on flavor and body."
"Pours a nice amber color with a fluffy white creamy head. The head is sweet and creamy, then the hop bitterness of the beer hits, definately an interesting tastebud experience. The beer is fairly light and easy to drink, goes down easy like other nitro cans. Overall its an interesting and good beer, nice hop bitterness , but not overwhelming. Definately well balanced and smooth."
"Very drinakable brew. Outstanding appearance of amber with a constant creamy head. Nose is malty with a light hint of fruit. Taste is lightly sweet until the finish with a light hop presence. Again, light frutiness,,very subtle. I also detected a very light hint of smoke that was very pleasant. Mouthfeel was somewhat light, but extremely smooth and creamy. Went down very easily....excellent drinkability."
"I can't decide if I like the nitro gimmick or not. I do like the creaminess that it imparts, but I've also heard that it masks the flavor to some extent. In any case, Abbot Ale is good beer. I've had better English ales, but this one is tasty and drinkable."
"ng"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, did the cascading thing, forming a huge, thick, frothy, slightly off-white head, which had amazing staying power, as expected for a nitro can. Ok, so I'm a sucker for a nitro. Light malt and hops nose drifts off the coppery brew. Smooth, smooth, smooth, with a taste of caramel malts and a late appearing hoppy bitterness. Not quite as good as when I had it on tap at British Beer Co. last spring, but I digress... Smoothness makes for great mouthfeel, and that combined with the taste makes for great drinkability. Can you say ""session""?"
"Lovely clear copper hue under an off-white two finger head that lingers briefly and leaves a few spots of lace. The nose is crisp with fresh malt and a touch of flowery hops. The mouth is very carbonated, quite light, and non-cloying. There's a good strong malt opening, followed by a typical British hoppy bite in the finish. Just a bit of a metallic edge in the taste, but this is pleasant within the overall picture. Quite an enjoyable brew."
"Clear coppery-bronze hue, it is rather thin in color, I fear it will be watery. Nitrogen induced creamy off-white head. Yes, the cascading affect is pleasant to look at but the widget is such an annoying gimmick. Anyway, the head settled at two fingers in height, very sturdy, the retention was fantastic. Also, the ensuing lacing was webby and active. The nose was lacking in potency, what I could detect was indifferent to the ol snout. There was some hints of fruity-malty sweetness, I cant help but think the nitrogen is masking some of the aromas. Wow, this is easy drinking! Obviously this was intended. The flavors are very weak, some vague maltiness, hints of fruitiness and marshmallows, clean and meager hop bitterness, and some sweetness is noticeable at the finish, as is a mineral twang. Abbot Ale easily defeats the Boddingtons Pub Ale abomination; too bad I cant get this in town as this would make a good session ale. Medium-light in body, a little watery, the carbonation is small and slick, as designed, Id say the mouthfeel is somewhere between good and tolerable. I picked up a nitro-can on a whim in Iowa City; it was a dollar at a grocery store. If I could find this locally at a reasonable priced Id buy it again, just to session with. Worth trying."
"The beer pours a hazy golden color with a perfect thick white head. The aroma is good also. It is rich in pale malts, but has some carapils to boot. The taste is decent. It is bitter and flavorful, but something about this beer just doesn't work. It is medium bodied and adequately carbonated. It goes down smooth and has a creamy finish; a real crowd pleaser over in England I'm sure, but I'm not completely sold on it's worth over in the USA. All in all, not a bad beer, but also not a great beer."
"Half decent body of malt with some buttery textures. This is suspiciously easy to drink. Almost too easy. Very enjoyable. Hey, whats not to like here?"
"Its dry, well-composed aftertaste is the best part of this beer. It might be a real gem on tap or as real ale, though."
"The beer pours an unblurred amber color with a light tan and very creamy modest sized head, with the lace a quite thick and sticky sheet upon the glass. Fresh malt nose that is sweet a clean to the senses, start is rich in malt, sweet and the top chumpy in feel to the palate. Finish is devoid of carbonation, as one would expect from a nitro can, with the hops inobtrusive in their bite and presence, not a bad beer, drinkable and a good first beer of the day, after the Big Beer Night of yesterday."
"Honey colored with a thick off-white head that hung around for the duration of the pint. It literally had a head from start to finish, and left fat rings around the glass. Aroma is sweet and doughey. Flavor is sweet, yeasty, with hints of apricot. Also a bit of a tangy finish. Smooth and velvety mouthfeel."
"Smell is, however, sweet and very faint. The taste, which perhaps being a step or two above Wexford Cream Ale, is still nothing too spectacular. This is a beer to be enjoyed visually more than anything else. That, and the unique creaminess that can only come from one of those nitro widgets makes this one go down nice and smooth. Definately one to try."
"what i really like about this one is its session potential. i find it quite easy to drink great volumes of this beer, but the flavor still strikes a chord with each can. it is infinately better out of the bottle, as the can has metallic overtones you find in all canned beers. but thats another thing that really impresses me. between all styles of casing for a beer, the difference in quality with abbot ale, while still noticable, has been kept to a bare minimum. you gotta love that. nothing worse than a beer that fluctuates wildy depending on what vessel its being drunk from."
"Presented in a green can with an abbot on the front. Poured a nitrogen cascade to create a thick white head atop an amber beer. Aroma is a bit sweet as well as floral. Taste is clean and crisp with a gentle hop balance with light malt flavor and a definte english water character. Light mouthfeel allows this beer to be easily drinkable."
"Medium-light body."
"Pours a darkish-amber, thick creamy white head and oodles of lacing from the nitro tap. Aroma is fairly dead, but mildly malty. Flavor is bready, biscuity, somewhat sweet, minimal hop presence. Body is creamy, but somewhat thin. Might not be too bad if it wasn't for the nitro tap sapping it's aroma and some of the flavors away."
"Bottom Line: Excellent!"
"Like all nitros, the thick creamy head easily marked which beer was mine. It was a abundant, and it lasted the entire beer. Underneath the full foam cap was a rosey amber body with a mildly fruity and malty fragrance, even with a hint of an aromatic hop like a Golding. The first and subsequent sips reveal a similarly fruity and aged malt body. Subtle but still interesting variety of flavors. A lighter body, standard to a British ale, it drank nicely, and really ought to have had another."
"This beer pours a clear medium dark red/brown color with a moderate dissipating off white head. The smell is of rich tea-like malt. The taste is earthy tea-like malt with a mild alcohol and caramel middle and mild piney hoppy finish with a firm mouthfeel. a drinkable fairly well balanced english ale."
"Tried this outta the bottle over a year ago and really liked so I tried it on the nitro-tap,poured a great creamy copper with a very sticky head,aroma is malty and more malty.Had that very disctintive Englisg hop taste with a malt backbone and a very dry finish.I was glad to try this on tap I really enjoy this beer."
"I finally decided to try this after seeing it many times in the local grocery store. Started out badly, with an unimpressive smell, and an even less impressive pour (virtually no head - maybe I should have tried the nitro). Taste isn't bad, hard to define. Almost reminds me of a German Alt or bock? Carbonation a little high, body a little thin. More malt than hops. I had a Fuller's ESB in between two of these, and it blew the Abbot away. (ESB is one of my absolute favorites). There was nothing that stood out with this beer. I have 4 left, so hopefully I'll enjoy it more next time."
"Deep rich amber brown, with a thick creamy almond head. My mouth is watering like crazy. Rating is for the second one, because I drank 3/4 of the first pint in one pull. I absolutely love beer like this. Rich full aroma, with a distinctive east kent goldings scent backed with lots of maltiness carrying a pear esteriness. Flavor is fantastic. Medium bodied, nitro carbonation. Lots of maltiness, with all the hops coming through in the finish, balancing some estery fruit flavors. Fairly dry, your tongue begs for more. I'm happy to oblige."
"A very round, soft malt character defines this beer, along with a very firm, earthy, spicy (Goldings? Fuggles?) hop character and bitterness. After every sip I found myself thinking ""What a fine session beer this is."" And then it was gone, confirming the fact."
"NERAX is less than a week away so I will once again have all the English Cask Ales that I can drink."
"This beer was tolerable at first, but as I drank more I disliked it more and more. The malt flavor is pretty unique, and the buttery maltiness of this was a bit hard to take after a little bit. Mouthfeel is very creamy as expected from the nitro can, but I couldnt get past the taste that just did not agree with me."
"A very intriguing brew in the great English Ale style. It poured so smotth with a legit and creamy head. It was a thing to behold. Better out of the tap than the bottle, the flavor from this ale was all that you would expect. It was slightly sharp, but very little in the way of hoppy-like snap. This is one I would like to try again, preferrably out of the tap. Bottoms Up!"
"I've got real troubles of pinpointing the diffrent tastes it gives because it really doesnt taste much, but that's maybe not bad if you want an easy drinkable bitter with less complex taste. Overall it's decent, drinkable yes, but not a tastebomb."
"All in all a wonderful English Bitter..the best I have tasted so far in the nitro-can..very drinkable!"
"I am a huge fan of English pales and bitters. This one was really nice, but, somewhat typical in comparison to other nitros of the same basic style(Tetly's, Ruddles County)."
"One of the better English Ales in Nitro-can. Pours out to a light-amber with a creamy luxurious white head and excellent retention. Chill haze is evident. Carbonation is very mild. Lacing is excellent, leaving one solid sheet. Aroma is very nice, with decent, but not overpowering, caramel...some toasty pale malts, vanilla, and butterscotch. Mouthfeel is, of course, very soft and smooth, with a watery medium-light body. Taste begins with some warm graininess, malt huskiness, a subtle dry-cider note, a firm malt body, and just enough hops to balance them. The hops are very smooth and linger in the finish, nicely complementing the slight astringency of the grain husks and alcohol. Just a hint of alcohol makes itself noticeable in the finish. Thankfully, I'm not picking up on much metallic taste, as I have found most English Ales to be unpleasant in this regard. A very well done mild."
"Ah the Nitro. Pours a huge cascading tan-off-white head. Beer itself has a deep orange. Nose is very yeasty (breadlike) and somewhat metallic (due to the can). Soft hops, herbs, and some fruityness. There is also a bit of maltiness as well. This stuff is super smooth, and fun to drink. I'd say it's slightly better than other nitro can English pub ales. All in all not bad, but I'd really love to try it on tap. England here I come!"
"Once the cascading head has settled the body is clear. It's deep copper with an orange-red tint; and the ivory colored head is dense and creamy. The aroma is intriguing: malty, bready, lightly fruity, gently caramel - almost butterscotch. The body is medium-light with a low level of carbonation and very fine bubbles from the nitrogen breakout. Very creamy in the mouth. The flavor is gently fruity upfront, revealing caramel and some buttery notes as it crosses the palate, and finishing nutty with some light residual bitterness. A very nice, highly drinkable, and enjoyable beer. A great session beer except that I think I'd find myself seeking more bitterness after the first or second pint. A hard beer to score because the nitrogen pour gives it such a nice head and creamy mouthfeel."
"A nice, clear copper color with amber highlights.  Pours with a two-finger dense, creamy head due to the widget.   The aroma is light and fruity.   Very light on the palate, a strong malt flavor with some hops bitterness.    I have a hard time defining what the flavor is, but it's interesting none the less.  It has a smooth mouthfeel, and is an easy drinker.    A good beer, but not my favorite style."
"Creamy smooth and well balanced ale leaves a quality lace behind a fast disappearing light amber liquid. Malty fruit nose, hints of floral. A draught is mellow sweet, a touch of caramel malt, a nice solid bitterness that stays and beckons. Good stuff. Me likey!"
"I like this one a little more than Boddington's. It is creamy and the flavor sits much better as you make your way through the brew. Score another for the guy who invented the widget!"
"Lovely copper color with a thick and creamy white head, very thick lace.  Roils quite impressively after being poured, a delicate stream of fine bubbles rises to the surface after the head settles.  Aroma has a sweet grassy aroma with honey notes.  Very smooth flavor with toasty malts dominating, the  hops assert themselves towards the finish, along with earthy flavors.  A touch of bitterness lingers after tasting.  Mouthfeel is quite smooth and creamy.  A very well-crafted ale."
"An all around pretty good beer. Nice copper amber color with the supercharged foamy head. The head stayed all the way to the bottom. Nice sweet smell hits your nose, toasted toffee sweetness jumps out. Very balanced taste, nitro makes for a creamy feel. Certain amount of sweetness thoughout, but thr strong bitterness reminds you of the style. A bit watery at the bottom of the glass. Very drinkable."
"A decent cask ale that had the usual great smoothness but was nothing spectacular. Dark amber and fruity, solid sheets of lace add to the ambience.  Subtle hop accent, I liked it but usually opted for Fullers or Sheperd Neame when in this fine pub. (favorite Wetherspoon pub)"
"Just your average English Bitter, malty then bitter, very enjoyable, but not super complex, a bit sweet at the start aswell, not bad."
"The can almost exploded on opening...one of those nitros that gives two ""heads", one under the other as it settles out.  The ""top"" head is extremely dense and creamy in mouthfeel.  Slight murky amber color, fresh bread smells.  Thick and smooth in first impression with a slight caramel flavor.  Perhaps one of the most cottony nitros I've had. Doesn't ""turn"" quite as watery as a Boddington's at the end.  Pleasant, straightforward and not a bad simulation of a hand-pulled cask pint.  Just a speck more complexity would have been groovy."
"All around great beer, clean nutty malt taste with just enough hops to balance and a lipsmacking finish. Incredibly tasty and each sip begs for another. It is tough to describe a precise flavor, in fact when you examine it closely it almost seems bland. But that finish/aftertaste brings it all together. Mouthfeel is watery but that's overlooking the exquisite head that pours forth the nitro can."
"Mild chill haze which means that this brew must have not been sterile filtered, still a bright orange amber colour with a thick two fingered nitro head shows something about this ale. Fruity aroma with a light caramel and floral hoppy company. Yum  nitro smooth, this is pseudo cask at its best. Creamy smooth, forced at that but it certainly adds to the drinkability for sure. Flavours are thrown around like junk in a cluttered house, clean but just in a scattered mess. Flavours of steeped hop tea, fruity with leafy hop all over. A drop of caramel and bready malt but the soft hop flavour keeps on coming back. Nitro starts to wear off a bit and then things seem to go thin and flat other than the hop flavour of course. One of the better non-stouts in a nitro can, something Id go back to over the others."
"Great British Ale.  Very smooth and creamy with a thick head that you can float a penny on.  The head comes from the C02 widget in the can.  The taste is mildly bitter, but not as much as most english bitters, with a nice hoppy finish.  Very drinkable and refreshing.  The can is very interesting and tends to attract the eye so that you to read it more than once.  The label claims the frementing process takes a full 7 days so all batches are ""Blessed by the Sabbath"".  Comes in 4 packs and is usually affordable but never cheap."
"I'm beginning to change my tune on these widget cans.  I hated he first ones I've had (Boddingtons, Caffreys).  I really like the last couple I've had (Abbot, Belhaven, Wexford)  Smooth mouthfeel with more body than most cans and just enough bitterness to offset the initial maltiness.  A nice aroma even escapes from the tight two-finger head.  Very quaffable."
"Had this on tap and thoroughly enjoyed the full flavored character of this brew. Fruity and malty are the predominate flavors. Some peat notes are subtle but evident. I also was able to enjoy it with an English rugger who played with our club briefly here in the US. It was his favorite local brew and was quite surprised to find it here."
"Notes: Abbot Ale is Greene King's flagship ale, and a damn fine English Ale. I'd love to try this brew on cask, but the widget can will do just fine in the meantime."
