I was unable to find a date on it, but If I assume it was bottled in April, May, or June then that would put the age at around 6 months. Perhaps I got a bad batch. The style is also not my first choice. Alas I may pick this up again next late spring/early summer and give it another shot, after all everyone deserves a second chance.","watermelon","Oct 06, 2013"

The taste is close to the same with a hint of rice and a slight dry bitter finish. Overall, not real impressed with this one.
