Nose of bitter and spicy hops, subtle citrus notes, and piney highlights. Flavors are smooth caramel sweetness, tropical fruit sweetness, bitter greens, and resinous hops notes. Smooth, light bodied, with a subtle resin and tropical fruit aftertaste. Smooth, slick finish. This is a tremendously easy drinker.","GarthDanielson","Beers"

It's light but not too light, thanks to the hops.  There are just a wee bit too much of them for my taste, but I don't like hoppy, IPA-type beers very much, so there you go.  Still worth a shot in the summer out on the patio.  I prefer other Odell beers more, but I like everything they put out, so it's not like I wouldn't drink this if given the opportunity.","dcscientist","Sep 22, 2014"

3.72,-2.4,3.75,3,4,3.75,4,"Overall - This is a good beer. Actually its great. I wasn't expecting much from it, but I honestly can say that I would probably opt for this one over stones pale ale (which I had before this) The hop bitterness comes through just enough to be enjoyable but doesn't take away from the other flavors offered in this brew. Where it lacks in the smell department, it makes up for in the taste and mouth department. I also quite like the bottle, nicely designed and a quality label. Go ahead and pick up a couple of these and you won't regret it.","SteadySippin","Nov 04, 2013"

Toasted and biscuit malts in the nose, with darker caramel malts and juicy, oily hops that contribute citrus and pine. Much the same on the palate, if a bit watery, with medium bitterness and nutty yeast that help fill out the flavor. It has a medium weight, with tongue-drying crispness and a lingering finish.

The hops surprised me as they are quite fruity, citrusy and refreshing, as opposed to the largely herbal qualities of the aroma. Crisp, dry, refreshing beer. Malt and hops are balanced very well, bitterness is low. Needs a little more body, but much like the 90 Shilling, this is a very drinkable beer. Smooth, almost creamy..

An exceptionally drinkable offering from one of the best craft breweries. This is good stuff and I'm glad I still have one bottle left. The beer poured gorgeous gold into the glass with a nice head that quickly dissipated and left very delicate lacing on the glass. Very subtle fruity, piney hops were evident in the nose, and that carried into initial taste. Nice balance of sweetness (very light but pleasantly noticeable) and the aforementioned hops, with a moderate malty body, punctuated by delicate carbonation. Those are two words I'd use a lot with this beer: delicate and subtle. Nothing "in your face" about it. No alcohol taste at all, with a very slight dry bitterness at the end. I never put the glass down--and it tasted great right through to the warmer last few swallows. It's an excellent session beer you'd never grow tired of. Clearly a winner all the way around.

There is the classic pale ale taste backed up with a little stronger hop profile. I tasted grass, pine and a little chocolate. The carbonation and body of the beer make it a beer for all seasons with just the right mix of body and liveliness. This is a super-drinkable beer it just goes down smooth.

Aromas are pretty hop forward: Fuggle and EKGs give off a nice floral, citrusy aroma, fresh. Some faint lightly toasty malts are there, but mostly hops. On the palate, the hops continue to take center stage with a nice open of mango and citrus. Unfortunately, it takes a weird turn from there.

It travelled will, and still has plenty of fizz! It was worth the drive! There are a half-dozen hops that go into the process of making this beer, Willamette being the most prominent. I tasted it green right out of the yeast tank - even then it was delicious! But the nitro version is SO creamy smooth!!

3.48,-8.7,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,4,"An all around good but average pale. This will be bottled in june of this year(2005). Im glad it is replacing the current cutthroat pale. It had a dark amber color and a some what small head. Nothing too out there about it. One of the better local pales on tap. I would take it over the New Belgium products.","RoBotGod","Beers"
3.75,-1.6,3.5,3.5,4,3,4,"Overall, it's a good mild American Pale Ale. The American hops differentiate it quite a bit from the English hops in the Cutthroat Pale. I like the dry hopped flavor. I wish it was even hoppier!","Beaver13","0"
