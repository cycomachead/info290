"By far the best Pale Ale I've ever had.  It has a great look out of the bottle - amber hue - although not much of a head or lacing.  The smell was just superb - not your run-of-the-mill pale ale scent.  Mouthfeel was okay, too carbonated for my taste, but speaking of the taste, it was great.  Hints of fruitiness to go mix quite well with the bitterness of the ale.  Overall, I consider this the best Shipyard offering I've had to date."

"Copper color. Nice dryish malt with some bread and caramel. Not hoppy. Very nice EPA."

"Best by date was still 5 months out... but this tasted dreadful. Malty, stale bread."
"O- eh....not again but worth trying."

"Poured into tapered pint glass.  Poured about an inch head with a pretty Amber color.  It has a super sweet smell with burnt sugar and malty caramel notes.  It has a strong malty bread notes upfront with a piney hoppy aftertaste.  Not a bad beer at all.  Nothing special, not a lot going on, but solid."

"Overall:  Very good beer, with good toasty, malty, slightly sweet, slightly bitter flavors.  I’m very glad to see that a beer named for one of my favorite historical American heroes also tastes good.  I’ll certainly get it again!"

"O: Not a bad pale ale, but I probably won't be acquiring it again. Caramel and amber malt complimented by English baker's yeast. Some hope presence, but not much."

"O- Good stuff! If you are a fan of crisp pale ales this is a great beer. Very refreshing after a warm day full of household activities!"
""
""
"That is a tasty English Pale Ale, very English, if you like the style you will definitely like this. If not, stay away. I did like its dryness and non-sweet profile, forces you to compulsively want more."

"The flavor is similar to the smell--quite British (earthy with dry caramel) with a good dollop of hop bitterness in the swallow. Relatively short aftertaste. Spritzy body. Round body."
""
"English pales aren't my favorite, but this is a balanced, easy-going beer. It actually reminds me of a slightly drier, slightly less sweet Boston Lager. Not a bad beer, and I wouldn't mind grabbing it again, but I'm not going to seek it out, either."

"o: A fine English style ale. Which is to say for me, a very fine brew indeed. It's clear many if not most of us Americans tend not to favor this style. When it's good, I love it, although admittedly it is not necessarily the most refreshing summer brew."

"a nice easy drinking english style pale ale. pours mostly clear, a bland bronze color with an inch or so of just off white foam. the nose is dry english biscuity malt, very little sweetness, which is key here. balanced by bittering hops only, this is a bready beer, malt forward, and quite crisp for its seeming lack of any hop intensity. its got a robust malt profile, but retains a lighter body, which is not easily achieved, and highly appreciated here. excellent carbonation also keeps this beer feeling light, as does its relatively lower abv compared to american styled pales. the finish is as crisp as any lager out there, clean and quick, refreshing and sessionable. i enjoy all the malt flavor without all the weight and sweetness, i thought this was a very well made beer. the perfect partner to some spicy garlic citrus chicken wings. bottle after bottle, ahhhh."

"Overall: Good beer, but not my first choice, I won't go out of my way to buy this one."
""
"O: It may be a slightly off 6-pack but the diacetyl and slight metallic flavor of this beer left me disappointed. a friend called it an ""insipid APA"" but I think that may be a bit harsh. Still, I don't know if I'll give it a 2nd chance to make a better impression."

"Overall: this one doesnt taste good or bad. Its just a beer for which no part is memorable. I am not even sure how drinkable it really is as the hops and aroma are all very dull and dry. Definitley too sour for my liking,"
""
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass. Pours a beautiful clear orange, with a one inch white head that leaves webs of lacing behind. Smell biscuit, carmel, citrus, and there signature ring wood yeast. Taste is similar all those flavors and the yeast in the finish. Body is medium, very lively, a dry finish, and very drinkable. This is a solid Pale Ale."
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Pours a nice straw/amber color but with very little head. Smells of earthy and piney hops and slight malt. Tastes of earthy tones with the hops and slight malt. Light/medium bodied beer goes down great with perfect carbonation. Overall a good beer."
""
""
"This one was made to be poured from a cask. Delicious nose and great overall taste. Balance was excellent. The Shipyard knows how to do Cask beer from a long time ago. I think it was the highlight of the the Cask Featival at the Bulls Head, 13/15 April."

"overall: didn't want to finish this one. We beer aficiandos drink for taste and this is where this beer fails. Only serious pale ale fans should try. Others, avoid."

"O: Dear good what an unpleasant beer. I hope this was a bad / old batch (the seasonal sold in the case was a summer ale). After this case though I am never buying another Shipyard beer again. Every beer has been mediocre at best or highly flawed."
""
""
""
""
"O: this is decent for its style and decent for me"
""
"I think it is English yes English. The low hop profile plus the excessive diacetyl tells me so."

"o - easily one of my favorite shipyard brews. highly recommend for a tasty inexpensive pale"
"O - Just an average APA that somewhat drinkable. I would recommend it."
"O- Pale ales are a hard catagory to compete in and unfortunately this one does not measure up. The odd bitterness taste and the off aftertaste make this an interesting but not great beer."
"Poured from 12 oz bottle into frosty mug in Sugarloaf. A is clean with rich two finger head. Slight reddish hue. S is friendly sweet and smooth peaches. Faint but really nice. T is a wonderful well rounded pale with a simcoe touch. Biscuit finish with good malt bill. M is well carbonated, and light for summer. O is a really smooth pale that I enjoyed. Nicely done. A face of Shipyard brews."
"Weird little beer here people. I poured it into a pint glass and was very much impressed with the Red orange color along with a 1 finger or so bright white head. That there is the only thing about this beer that was even impressive. It tasted like a light version of a light beer and it seemed to water down rather quickly. Very bitter and strong even with a ABV just below 5 % . Not my style."
"This will be a beer I will make a regular in my fridge."
"i wouldnt go looking for this beer, but i also wouldnt avoid it if there wasnt a better choice"
"The aroma was very earthy and malty. Not the usually hoppy pale ale I come across. Lots of bready malts and hints of light grain. Light hops as it warms, mostly piney. The flavor carried over quite well. Rich bready malts, hints of biscuit liek flavors and a light touch of pine hops. Nothign really standing out to me though and the whole thing comes across slightly average. Decent medium mouthfeel here with adequate carbonation and a smooth overall profile."
"This is a really delicious pale ale and I would love to try this on tap in Portland, Maine."
"Had it from a bottle, pours a nice dark gold color, smell is very average for this style with a nice malty touch to it. Pretty average APA, interestingly those I am getting a lot of buttery diacetyl type flavors with shipyards brews, must be their signature. Taste is very malt forward and the hops make their presence followed that buttery finish. Refreshing, but nothing spectacular."
"A rather light, but refreshing, beer."
"Poured a light amber like a southern ice tea - small head stayed a long time- even to the end. nice lace. Smells of malt - sweet. Taste of citrus and malt - well balanced - lighter than expected. An excellent well balanced beer A very nice, drinkable beer. I will keep some on hand. I have a hard time finding it in my area, but I will ask some stores to stock it."
"Yup, the butter is there. Yuck. I hate that stuff. For an APA I just can't justify it. It's caramel sweetness is tainted by it. The hops just don't live that long. Perhaps I'm overly sensitive to diacetyl, if that's what this is. blah. It's not all that powerful, which allowed me to finish the beer, but it takes a severe hit to taste rating."
"While it's not a ""reference"" pale ale-- it is a very enjoyable beer experience-- given the right circumstances. I think it's worth another bomber bottle in my cellar."
"Pours medium amber with light layer of white sticky foam. Good retention. Light malty smell. Taste is a flavorful malt backed by a modest hop for the close. Notes of something 3/4s of the way through. Pepper maybe? Good carbonation. Very drinkable, nice pale. Not as powerfully hoppy as most Americans."
"The mouth is smooth and never hash and is nice in the mouth"
"D...average thirst quenching, enjoyable..."
"D-Easy to drink but not a beer you really want to drink more than one or two. Lacks a unique taste."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a copper color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is dominated by hops. Taste is also hop heavy, not much else coming through. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this is a decent but unspectacular brew."
"Overall a good APA."
"D: Decent beer but I like my PA's with a little hop character. Was a bit too sweet for the style."
"Overall - If Magic Hat's Blind Faith had this mouthfeel or if this tasted good I would buy either of them again. As is though... not going to happen. I now officially give up completely on Shipyard."
"Shipyard Chamberlain Pale Ale was copper colored with a small white head that quickly faded into obscurity. The aroma was largely caramel malt. The taste was a weak caramel malt in the flavor lead with small hops acting as second banana. Supporting cast of butter. Chamberlain doesn't make a strong statement in either direction, malt or hops. Nothing here to write home about. The mouth feel was light to medium bodied, oily and lightly carbonated. Drinkability was only so-so, just not good enough to worry about having another one."
"A nice beer for sessioning, but a little too thin for my tastes."
"Would be a good summer beer with some pale hop flavors, but still too light overall."
"D: OK drinkability, if the mouthfeel was cleaned up a bit it would be a lot better."
"22oz brown bomber with no date, bought at RSVP in Portland, ME on 10/30/09, drank on 11/04/09. Poured into a shaker pint, tight two finger white head, dies to about half of a finger and the constant carbonation keeps it there over a bright copper hued body. A light, bright malt nose, a little herbal hopiness to it, though not too much. Again light malt in the taste, with the buttery diacetyl an almost graham cracker like taste? A little pine, a little bitterness. Mouthfeel is good, medium/light with good carbonation, a creamy feel to it. Overall not a bad pale, not my go to by any means but I would drink it if presented to me."
"An acceptable APA, but not really that exciting."
"Copper looking beer, very clear, with a thin head. Simple beer on the aroma. Typical Pale Ale smell, malts and hops... however, very little intensity. The taste is earthy, probably from the hops. A good beer to drink during a hot summer day... nothing out of this world 'tho."
"D) A well crafted PA. True to form. I'd drink another."
"It was somewhat heavy and felt pretty thick but it was a great session beer, very enjoyable with dinner."
"Poured with a small, off-white head, that diminished to hardly anything at all. Body was mostly clear and sparkling, with a slight haze, and a beautiful dark-orange color. No real lacing to speak of. Aroma wasn't anything special... lightly hoppy. Nice on the palate, with a light to medium body, slightly oily, and lively carbonation. Very nice flavor that starts off bitter and acidic, and finishes off... bitter, of course, but heavier hops than would have been expected. Overall, a very nice pale ale that I would easily drink again."
"D: Very drinkable and nothing to overpowering. Good and Average."
"Bitter and dry at the finishe."
"Thiner side for sure for body, but it leads into drinkability. This was from a bomber, and I had no trouble downing this. If you are into extreme beers with over the top flavors, then avoid this one. But if you are looking for an easy drinker or a good BBQ brew, this might just be it. I am not a Shipyard fan, but this became the second brew from them that I would drink on a regular basis."
"D - Decent pale ale, really fills the mouth. I would drink this again."
"I could've sworn that Concord Brewery made this, but then again, maybe it's the Union forces Civil War outfits that confused me. This special ale is a refreshing & simple pale ale that doesn't try anything funny or special. Simple & upfront. A nice golden pour to coppery brown & yelloe with thinnish head but nice lace. Nice mild florals & mild but flavorful malt up front that leads to a good clean, crisp hop bite. Easy to drink and not think about..."
"Froma 12 fl. oz. bottle with an Aug. '09 expiration date. Sampled on March 5, 2009. It pours a nice looking copper-orange with good carbonation and decent clarity. The aroma is a kind of caramel malt with a feint hop distinction. Taste is about the same but ends bitter like an ESB. Kind of nice."
"Pours a cloudy golden orange with a thin white head. Some retention,and decnt laceing. Aroma is buttery, with fruity hop notes as well. Body is medium with some carbonation. Taste is bready up front, fruity as well. Piney hops in the finish. I like it a lot!"
"Off the tap at the Sea Dog Brewery this one was a bright orange color with good clarity. The one-finger of white head retained itself as a clingy ring and left scattered lacing .The aroma was smoky (?) with a lot of roasted malt character for a pale ale along with some dry hops notes. The flavors were full of yeast, biscuity malt and some herbal hops that added a rather crisp and bitter finish. Rather weird for an APA but not bad at all. The body, mouthfeel and carbonation were all average."
"Pours a clear golden amber color with an average white head that settled into a light ring. The aroma is of buttery malt, light green apple and a touch of spicy hops. The taste is of buttery malt, graham cracker like, the hops don't really play a role here except for bittering. The feel is moderate with semi soft carbonation; finishes slightly bitter. An ok APA, a bit too buttery and not enough of a hop flavor for me."
"This beer has all the defining characteristics of a Shipyard brew. It pours a clear golden amber with a smallish white head, some retention. The beer is decently carbonated. The nose is buttery malt, with a goodly dose of yeast. The taste is all Shipyard. There is plenty of diacetyl, toffee, and yeast. There is a dry saltene cracker like finish to the beer, with a slightly sweeter buttery malty middle, with a touch of dry caramel throughout. There is a nice balance to the beer, but the buttery toffee, the dry caramel, the yeast consistency, and the salty finish have Shipyard written all over it. It's a good beer, but the brewer isn't pushing the boundaries any with this fine selection. This one came in a 12 variety pack. Luckily I was able to split it open rather than having to purchase way more Shipyard than I would have preferred."
"Thin on the tongue and crisp. Not bad I guess. Grainy and biscuity and not at all like an APA. Easy drinker. I will pass in the future."
"This Shipyard product, Chamberlain Pale Ale, was poured from a 22 ounce ""bomber"" into a clear, clean 16 ounce mixing glass. Normally a draft product for me, I was happy to have one at home. A: A thin, reddish-orange hue, with no haze or sediment. A quick bit of head, then nothing. During the drinking, there was no brewer's lace either. S: Slightly piney, or floral, but not overpowering. Actually, the smell was one of a dated beer, but only partially. T: Despite my average A & S, the taste, really the most important part of the review, was enjoyable. A slightly thin drinking pale ale, closer to a ""bitter"" or an ESB in my opinion. Not as hoppy as many of the newer pale ales, but very enjoyable. Really, this is closer to a session ale for me. When Shipyard started brewing, this beer was probably considered ""hoppy"". Now many other breweries have passed it by in the rush for hop domination. M: Again, the word thin comes to mind for the mouthfeel. D: Drinkability is very good, as I could have many of these. Again, a decent pale ale, but a highly enjoyable, very drinkable beer."
"Very nice, clean pale ale. Pours clear copper with the advertised white head. Crisp nose of crystal and pale malt, with golding and cascaded hops. Some peppery hops and a sour malt up front, with smoother caramel malt sweetness at the end. Nearly like an ESB. Far superior to Sierra Nevada."
"Part of the Shipyard Variety Pack picked up for a bargain at the local supermercado. Twist off cap, smell is an earthy hoppy smell with a little bit of barleywine smell. Pours to a metallic orange color with a fizzy head. Taste is the earthy but dull bitterness followed by a citrusy sweetness. The finish stays sweet but the aftertaste is slightly bitter. This as my previous taste appears to be a definite east coast (more English) pale ale v. a West Coast Pale ale. A refreshing change from the cascades, yet tasty and highly imbibeable. This so far appears to be the best of the Shipyard's selection. This brew would go great with fish and chips, preferably beer-battered walleye or fresh codfish.."
"American pale ale? There's nothing very American about it. The Ringwood yeast gives off a lot of creamy fruit in the aroma and taste while the hops are incredibly grassy. This beer also only leans to the bitter side of thing slightly, for a crisp and dry finish, but the IBU's here aren't too big. However, for what this beer is, and whatever it is, it's pretty decent and a nice session ale."
"2/8/2008. Just bought this one and a few other singles at a local store with quite a few craft beers. I generally haven't been a big fan of Shipyard but this one was a somewhat pleasant surprise. Pours a dark golden color with a moderate head. Not much in the way of aroma. Taste consists of a little malt, floral sweetness and a nice dry hoppy bite. Not bad and actually probably one of the better beers I've sampled from this company."
"Medium effervescence & medium bodied, this is a middle of the road pale ale although it is darker than most. Nothing bad really, though nothing for the nose to enjoy, there's nothing to make this stand out, either."
"Appears a pale copper slightly hazed with chill, large foaming off white head with fine even lacing strung on my imperial pint with each sip. Aroma is full of pungent citric hops mild floral tones as well, really citrus zest is the dominant scent going on. Some pale biscuit malt notes going on provide enough sweetness to compete with the hops. I have to mention the Ringwood yeast note that comes out in every Shipyard brew I've ever tasted, that edge brings a tart almost sourdough note with a touch of oak barrel character and leather. Flavors collide hops and malts and than the Ringwood hammer drops, touch of toasted biscuit and citrus hops among the flood of yeast character that I already described. Mouthfeel is medium bodied oily with hops and carbonation is sturdy almost tickling the back of the throat. Drinkability is decent but the never ending Ringwood edge gets in the way of my enjoyment, solid New England style pale ale."
"drinkability - Nice tasting beer from a cask. Would buy it again, abover average beer I would say."
"Drinkability was good. This stuff goes down quickly and surely enough, quicker than you'd expect from an ale. Shipyard has always made good beers, and this one joins the ranks. Cheers!"
"Bottle: Poured a deep copper color ale with a good size foamy head with good retention and some nice lacing notes. Aroma of English dry hops with a nice medium sweet caramel malt base. Taste is also a well balance mix between some English style hops with some notes of delicious caramel malt. Very well balance overall with loads of character but still easily drinkable. Full body with good carbonation. Really well made and possibly helps that I got a really fresh bottle directly from the brewery."
"Palate is very mild in flavors across the board - toasty malt with balancing hops, not too much, and rather thin bodied. Easy to drink, but not very exciting either."
"I really miss being up in PORME."
"D - A nice pale in more of the English style and very good drinkability on cask for sure. I have not had this in bottles, but I can almost bet it doesn't stand up to the smooth feel and sweet aroma this has. Very mild, made for sessioning, an easy to quaff pale"
"D: This is a good session brew with an alcohol below 5% (and there is no hint of the alcohol when you are drinking it). Cask tends to make everything taste just a bit better."
"D: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, mild kick, it's a decent beer and if you want to have cask beer for the sake of having cask beer, then it will suit you. However, I found it just be an ordinary beer overall."
"Taste is dryish, well-balanced with light sweetness and bitterness, leafy, toasty, with light caramel-butterscotch yeatiness and hint of toasted buttered bread. Hop character is light but noiticeable, a bit leafy and faintly citrusy. It is very nice, characterful, easy to drink, and with a well-rounded, firm body."
"The taste is quite rich. More than I was expecting based on the clarity of the beer. This is definitely akin to a nice British pale ale. Its not really a hoppy pale ale, but more of a balanced one with a nice smooth taste. The aftertaste has that familiar Ringwood flavor that I am trying to grow accustomed to and look past when I drink Shipyard's beers. Overall, this is a very enjoyable beer."
"Although my friends and I were blown away by the tastiness of this beer, I have a feeling my impression of a bottle would be very different. I 'm excited about trying other varieties on cask at Oldsmar Tap House - which I highly recommend if you live in the Tampa Bay Area."
"D: A bit bitter for my liking, otherwise I'd call it a session. Definitely worth a try. I'd pair with with anything grilled on a summer day."
"Very drinkable good session beer"
"D: Its a nice chill beer. Easy to drink and sit by, watching the day or night pass on by."
"D: Very nice, good summer beer. This is a malty pale vs a hoppy pale ale, hop heads may be disappointed."
"Hops mostly dominate the beer than one would expect, could have been slightly more sweet to balance it out, but the buttery aspect of the beer helps with that a little."
"Poured into a pint glass from a bottle. Had a very slight head and a little lacing. Looked a hazy copper. The smell was very piney to me in the hop form along with the taste. The taste also had a ""trub"" resembalence to me. Lighter to a medium mouthfeel it was not that bad of a brew. Drinkability seems OK."
"Pours a very clear golden amber color with a thick, pillowy head that reduced into a half inch white cap with little lacing. Smells faintly fruity. The taste is full of bready malt flavor; buttery in the finish. Subtle hop presence. Despite the difference in styles, I thought this beer had a distinctly Heineken-like flavor. Medium bodied and viscous, it stays on the tongue. Overall, a fine session beer. I'd have it again."
"Drinkability- One of the most drinkable beers Ive had in a long time."
"Filtered light orange in color, the head on this one rises very well, but gives back some. Smell has lemon zest, dry grain, and a dusty hop aroma. This brew has a biscuity flavor to it, a little bready too. A touch of buttery flavor creeps in, so this must mean those named flavors are its bread and butter. Haha! It's all good. This one tastes English inspired, not a hoppy brew at all."
"Drinkability: Union General Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain was a badass. This beer, not so much."
"Got this beer out of a Shipyard Variety pack. A great pale ale. Had a nice light amber color. Loved the portrait of Joshua Chamberlain on the bottle label. Smelled light and fruity, with just a hint of a hoppy smell. Tasted like it smelled with the right kick of hops, to where it was not overly bitter. Would be very easy to drink several of these in a sitting."
"Picked this up at the whole foods market. was attracted to it by the label. I'm a big history buff and chamberlain was one of my favorite figures from the civil war. the beer overall has a good taste, smoth flavor. easy to drink, not overtly hoppy, slight grain/.cprn aftertaste but not too much. overall i would rate this a good all around beer, it's a good beer for a bud light drinker to be able to enjoy something different and appritiate that a beer does not have to be watered down to be drinkable, ie taste isnt bad."
"This is a good beer that starts with a hoppy bite but balances just at the end with a touch of malt. It is definitly a beer that could be enjoyed no matter the season with a body thats not too much for warm days. The taste has many elements of citrus and metallic touches. The smell is typical of this type of beer with nothing standing out to me."
"Pours a light, reddish amber with gold highlights and no head. Aromas are predominantly hoppy, with lemony metals showing, and some biscuity malts backing things up. On the palate, bitterness is substantial first-off, with lots of metallic flavors from the hops coming through at the mid-palate. The bitterness of the hops is expertly balanced by the malt, though, in spite of the fact that the malt doesn't contribute much aside from a clover honey in tea kind of sweetness. Mouthfeel is a bit overcarbonated, but otherwise typical. Overall, this is a decent, drinkable amber ale. Nothing special, but certainly something that I could order a few times."
"22oz bomber with new yellow packaging. Pours a light orange amber. Very clear liquid. Lots of foam that recedes to an 1/8 inch cap. Aroma of ringwood yeast which includes buttery caramel and a banana fruitiness. Flavor is not aggressive but mellow and delicious. Hops are also mellow and a bitterness builds on the palate that increases the dryness. Well made with nothing out of balance. Marmalade flavors emerge as beer warms. This brew is mostly sweet and fruity with hops playing the role of taming with bitterness."
"Purchased: Bevmo, Palmdale CA"
"I found this one to be more of a Pale Ale overall than an Amber. Regardless, it was still nicely balanced and had a good amount of flavour to it. For whatever reason, I was a bit surprised at how enjoyable this one was."
"I definately would wash down some of Jack's whole belly clams with a couple of these any day."
"Drinkability: Moderate."
"light copper color with an off white head , big at first then a fade to blotch lacing that clung nicely to the glass in spots. Smell was mainly malt , with barely a hint of hops ,first nose hit was that of freshly mowed grass and bread. Taste is okay, nothing too impressive , although ,I thought the taste balance of malt and hops was very good. On the light side of most pale ales I've had lately, more like a matured lager. Quaffable, could drink these all day long. Overall , average, would not turn this down but wouldn't seek this out again with so many more to discover."
"22oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a golden amber color with a nice off-white head. The aroma is rather disappointing with some faint malt and a sweet soap-like fragrance. The taste is a decent balance between the malt and hops but lacks in flavor compared to some of the better pale ale's out there. Overall, this is a rather average pale ale that doesn't really stand out in any way among the rest."
"Pours light amber. Small to medium bubbly, off-white head; a couple of very long, bubbly arcs lace the glass. Aroma is dominated by sweet doughy malts and accented by distant herbal / spicy hops. Some yeasty notes. Mouthfeel is light bodied and well-carbonated. Flavor is warm, toasty, buttery malts with a few sourdough notes followed by light, distant pine hops and spice. A neutral yeast taste is surprisingly present throughout. More butter malts and some earthiness / woodiness in the finish. Aftertaste is lightly bitter and savory."
"A very middle-of-the road beer with great drinkability."
"I'd have to say that out of the sampler case I bought of this, the Pale Ale is probably the MOST drinkable of the four, and the one I tend to enjoy the most."
"This one is a decent pale ale - Nothing particularly special - Has nice qualities, but is a bit too buttery and yeasty for a truly ""sessionable"" ale, but is worth ""checking out""."
"This beer pours a beautiful copper color with a brown head of foam. Aroma is nice and malty with some hops and fruitiness. Seems sweet judging by the aroma. Taste is much of the same except that there's a sort of biscuity goodness to the flavor. Smooth and drinkable."
"Chamberlain Pale Ale pours a clear light copper with a nice creamy head. Aroma is darker crystal malts and crisp hops. Flavor is sharp and malty, with a solid bitterness and some toasted flavor towards the end. Ringwood flavor is there, but it's light and doesn't hurt the beer. I'm not sure why this one is listed as a Amber/Red Ale, although it might straddle the border between that and Pale Ale."
"Not bad. A 12oz bottle with a best before 1/08 on the label, poured into a pint glass. Gold color, medium head, a little lacing. Not much aroma, mostly grainy. A muted hops taste, nothing really stands out. A pleasant enough beer, probably a decent session beer."
"This was very easy to drink, but its quite ironic that a beer named after the Union officer who held the flank at Gettysburg (or everyone would be saying ""Y'all"" now) is a beer without real direction. There is stuff going on, but no real plan/course of taste action. It tastes confused, again a bitter (pun intended) irony given the namesake. I do think it would benefit greatly with some simple pub fair, and it probably would be very good with such. But alone I think, unless offered one, pass on getting more for myself."
"One of my favorite beers. I first tried it a couple years ago, not because I was a big beer fan, but because Chamberlain is my favorite historical figure. Overall, though, this beer is great. It has really nice hoppy flavor that's not too overpowering. Really pretty copper color and a pretty smooth drink. I'm happy it's coming to the Connecticut market, as I was making yearly trips to Maine to get a case of the 22oz bottles."
"Cheers."
"Pours a auburn copper color w/ a nice fluffy white head that lasts. Smells of caramel and maybe some honey with some hop. Tastes slightly sweet with a nice bitter kick to it. The flavor holds on to your tongue and has a slight carbonated hint to it as it goes down. Excellent beer, Shipyard has got to be getting big with the beers they are producing, they are no slouch to the beer scene. 2 thumbs up!"
"22oz bomber from Tiger Town. Amber-red translucent body with about a quarter inch of off-white head that leaves a fair bit of lacing. Aroma is slightly weaker than expected, and consists of hops with hints of yeast and diacetyl. Tastes caramelly and biscuity with some yeast and hops to support. Dry finish. On the lighter side of medium-bodied. A pretty good pale ale. Definitely one of their better offerings, and something I could see myself drinking on a regular basis."
"Overall: A good mellow pale ale, well balanced. Recommended."
"Shipyard's Chamberlain Pale Ale is a beautifully done English pale ale that can only be fully enjoyed at cellar temperature. It needs a rough pour to raise its head and release some CO2; and a bit of warming from the fridge. Otherwise, it's almost another beer entirely. It's clear golden-amber body is capped by a creamy head of off-white that holds well and leaves some nice splashes of lace behind. The nose is rich with yeast character (buttery diacetyl and some apricot/dried dates/figs). It just reeks of Ringwood! It's medium-bodied with a dextrinous edge, and somewhat creamy due to its moderate carbonation level. The malt is grainy and rich with a bright caramel edge, and some grassy and leafy hops add a tea-like note that nestles in nicely with the butteriness to leave it kind of nutty. Well-rounded, full flavored, beautifully balanced. Very drinkable! Kind of a very special bitter in my opinion. Well worth seeking out for fans of English ales."
"D - Yeah it goes down okay, but I'm not buying another one of these. If some else wants to buy one for me...well then I'll drink it, just to be nice."
"Pours a clear reddish amber with a medium foamy head. The smell is light with only a hint of malt sweetness. The taste is sweet malt,floral flavors,and abit of hops. The m/f is light with the flavors mixing OK, but there is a mettalic and medicinal aftertaste. This really is an average beer at best. Sorry Shipyard."
"D: Boring. Not necessarily bad but nothing really desirable. Characteristics are simple and lack luster."
"Clear color of gold  white head frothy but , short - nose of yeast , cobwebs , apricots , tar , and sour red berries  taste of yeast, dried apricots , cinnamon , and citrus  light bubbly body  sweet yeast aftertaste bitter apricots slightly acidic"
"Moderate mouthfeel. Clean and drying aftertaste. The Diacetyl disappears and leaves the mouth clean wanting another sip."
"Sinkability  No way Im finishing a bomber of this crap."
"22 ounce bomber without freshness indication/dating. Pours clear slightly reddish amber, with minor lacing left behind the off white head, initially this one showed alot of carbonation, but it quickly calmed down to just a few bubbles rising. Nose is just some dull malt and things dont get much better after that, a bit on the watery side, just minor feel of malt and a wimpy hop non wallop, C'mon shipyard, if you put as much effort into the brew as yoiu put into the nice label, you would produce a better product and likely sell more of em...Down the drain about 1/2 of this one went..."
"A medium body that turns kind of fluffy and cream like in the mouthfeel. An easy one to drink for sure with it's mild ABV and an interesting hop to it, in the taste. Worth a go...cheers!"
"Drinkability?.... Just doesn't work to well for me."
"This was in a 22 oz bomber. It poured into a pint glass with a white lace head and a golden hue. The aroma is that of an ale w/ a touch of floral hops. The taste though brings out a spicy hop profile. There is a thinish body that makes the brew easy to go down and you can feel and malt balance in the end. Overall the brew tastes a lot like an English PA or bitter. That's just MHO."
"Chamberlain Pale Ale isn't a head turner, but it is a reasonably tasty, sessionable offering that is one of Shipyard's best. Only Old Thumper (of the ones that I've had) is clearly the superior beer. I can't say that I'd drink a lot of it if I was a Maineite, but I still had a good time from start to finish."
"Rich auburn color with good head. Malty aroma with a little hops. Quite tasty with a good malty sweetness and a clean finish. Mouthfeel is a bit thin. A drinkable beer with its pleasing taste and low ABV that would be especially nice for those who don't like too much hops."
"Is it the best beer? Nowhere near, but as something worth buying, I'll give it points. (and it supports the restoration and maintence of the home of a true hero.)"
"This beer pours orange with a nice head from a 22 ounce brown bottle. The aroma is hoppy. Taste has some good hoppiness, but definitely strongly influenced by their yeast which gives a butterscotch like flavor, which either you like, or you don't (I tend not to like it very much). This is actually a pretty decent offering, well worth trying."
"Next"
"Extremely drinkable and mild beer. Next time I am in the mood for a British ale I will get this instead."
"I found this to be a refreshing brew that was interesting enough to keep my attention. Crispy and fairly dry. Pretty damn good and worthy of some future gobblage."
"What style is this? I was expecting APA, and the first notes made me think as much, but the BA style says Amber/Red ale. OK, maybe it's a little of all of these styles. Hard to categorize. But the real bottom line is that it really doesn't do anything for me."
"Just the label on the bottle makes this ale worthy (if you are a Civil War buff), but it does have some other good points too. It pours a pretty standard coppery and bubbly amber with a two finger khaki head. The Ringwood (a Shipyard signature) is evident in the aroma as is butter and pine (the latter particularly appropriate for a leading microbrewery from the Pine Tree State). The taste is exactly what the redolence would suggest, a bit more of the caramel than the pine, I would say, and the finish is bready. There's a smooth feel to the mouth and more subtle carbonation than the plethora of rising bubbles would suggest. A fine ale for a clear, warm summer evening on the shore of one of Maine's many beautiful lakes. I just wish I could get cases of this stuff!"
"The beer pours a dark gold/amber color with a 1/2"" white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice malt scent that boasts of pale and light crystal malts. It also has a fruity yeast scent and some mild hopping. The taste is decent. It has a smooth malty flavor that is light with some caramel notes. It also has a bitter hop finish that balances well with the Ringwood yeast. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a highly drinkable beer. It is nothing spectacular, but none of their beers are. It has good flavor and aroma. How can anyone really complain?"
"Although this won't go on my short list of beers to seek, I will order it again if I run across it. Fits nicely between APA and IPA."
"Mouthfeel is crisp at the start. The finish is crisp the malts softly linger on the tongue. Drinkability is down a notch for me, as this was somewhat bland on the flavor front."
"Excellent head and lacing -- very light and pleasing; long lasting. Nice pale color. Moderate carbonation. Nice whif of maltiness with a little bit of hop spiciness. What sold this brew, however, is the taste. Very nice and sweet malt signature with appropriate accompanying hops. A warning, however: if you are a ""hophead"" and are looking for a very hoppy pale ale, this beer might not be for you. That said, this is a very drinkable beer -- definitely could be a session beer. Almost feels like a ""throwback"" beer, a la Brooklyn's ""Pennant Ale."" A very nice and refreshing beer."
"Pours a nice copper color with a great fluffy head. Chewy, buttery malt mouthfeel. Classic Shipyard butter diacetyl flavors. Slight fruity profile mixed in as well. There is also a nice hoppy presence. Very smooth and drinkable. I enjoy this beer when it's available."
"Drinkability is above average, if only because the flavor is too mild to be offensive."
"Copper in color with a nice thick white head that leaves some lace. Sweetness in the aroma, caramel and toffee, along with some citrus and spicy hops. Well balanced, starts with some malt sweetness: toasted grain and light caramel. Hops come in and add citrus, spice, and some earthy flavors. Also has a touch of butter to it. Light lingering bitterness and finishes dry. Smooth and crisp, medium in body. Good drinkability, solid brew."
" A very good-lookind beer. Its clear copper color and thinner than expected off-white head made for a nice appearance. The head stayed around and did not fade as the lace ringed the glass with a thick film. The aroma had a citric hop to it. The taste was a well balanced blend of sweet creamy malt with some hop bitterness to crisp up the brew. An over-all buttery toffee mouthfeel made for a very drinkable, goes with a meal beer. At 4.9% abv, the lowest in the collection, it was easy for summer doings & busy times."
"My first Shipyard brew, and one of the better, bottled, Maine microbrews I sampled during my week in the Pine Tree State. This is an ale that I could enjoy time and time again. Very well done."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a light beige 1"" head above the lightly copper brew. Laces well. Aroma is malty, with a tinge of hops and maybe a sniff of vanilla as well. Taste is reasonably malts for a Pale Ale, and then closes with a nice hit of hops. Well-balanced in a good way. Mouthfeel and drinkability excellent."
"Very drinkable, but I would have liked to see a little more of a hop presence."
"Over all a very nice brew, probably the best I have had, from the Shipyard Brewing Company!"
"One of the better beers I had from Shipyard while up in Maine,pours a nice deep golden color with a big blooming head that leaves some nice lacing.Aroma is of lightly toasted malt and a little sweet,taste is malty dominat with some nice fruity estures that linger,light hop note in the finish to balance this brew out.Was told this is hard to find outside of Maine Iam glad I got a chance to try it."
"I kinda have to like this beer as I'm a Civil War reenactor in one of the companies of the 20th Maine. Chamberlain commanded the 20th at Gettysburg. Thankfully, this is a very good and drinkable pale ale. A light brown in colour with a lovely head - big and smelly. Hops and light spices to the nose. A smooth feel in the mouth, maybe a tad too thin, but I'm not complaining. At a reenacting event this beer is a must just as Little John's Root Beer."
"Overall a very surprising brew from shipyard. I dont like Chamberlain in the bottle and I only tried this because it was on cask. A good move by me. On cask it was much smoother and the complexity of the ingredients was much more noticeable. The flavor of the citrus hops were really standing out here as well as the biscuit malt flavors in the aftertaste. If I have to find a fault I would say that it is a wee bit heavy for a pale ale, IMHO."
"Another great beer from Maine."
"Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, the arch opponent of the temperance movement in Maine while he was governor, has a great pale ale named in his honor. Pours a nice brown color with a good head. Taste is perfect for the style. Almost like when you first drank sasperilla soda, you know what a pale ale is with this. Good carbonation, the dry, but not sweet taste. This is a winner."
"How could anyone not like a brew named for and bearing the likeness of Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain? The beer's appearance is a deep copper, with a thick head. I experienced a pleasant bite from my nose to my throat. The finish had an ever-so-slight hint of citrus. Overall, a good Pale Ale in a very nice package."
"I was very impressed by this pale ale. Nice artwork on the 22 oz. bomber. Deep copper color with a stick foamy head. The aroma of mellow spicy hops has just a hint of sweetness to it. The first sip presents a buttery spicy ale with a bold malt flavor. The body is quite smooth ad heavy enhancing the balance of the flavors. The bitterness is immediately apparent and lingers well through the experience. Very nice brew."
"Pours a nice sexy copper color with very little head, and lace.  Not a very strong malt smell but it taste pretty good with a good variation of hops that leaves a bitter after taste.  Finishes strong with the pale style.  Overall a pretty good Pale Ale."
"Nice crisp but creamy body and mouthfeel make this a very drinkable beer, I must join JohnnyP in asking ""why is this not sold in sixpacks?""."
"Dull copper color, maybe light brown depending on the light. I tried for a hard pour and a big head, got a nice foamy 2 inch cloud top that laced the glass nicely. Herbal, hop, nearly medicinal nose, somewhat odd sourness as well. Taste was very balanced, hoppy start, creamy, and very easy going down. Very good pale ale, better than most. A bit of a watery thin finish is the only downside, but this makes for a very drinkable pale ale. Cool name, fitting tribute to a great man. I like the beers that take a historical twist. I bought singles and bombers at the Shipyard brewery. Bottles were $1 and bombers $2, pretty cool."
"Pours a cream, two-fingered head, fades quickly and leaves some lace. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied. Clear amber color. Citrusy nose. Starts with a mix of hops and malt, faint sweetness in the background and finishes without an overpowering amount of hops like some pales can be. 83¢ for a 12oz bottle from Cumberland Convenience Greenland, NH."
"Pours a deep golden color with a good off white head with fades and leaves a nice lace behind.  Wonderful malt and subtle, earthy english type hops are in the nose.  Great malt backbone with some nice bittering hops but as in the nose they are much more subtle and earthy.  Wonderfully creamy yeat not heavy this brew is very drinkable.  I've only tried two brews from The Shipyard so far but they have both been excellent.  Highly suggested, just make sure you serve these north of 50° to get the true character of them.  Yet another huge thanks to the Bierman for this wonderful bier."
"163"
"Notes: Quite a bold pale ale for a humble bodied brew, the yeast plays a big part in the brew from its by-products from the buttery diacetyl to the aggressive dry side of the malt. You'll see this one in their Captain's Collection 12-pack."
