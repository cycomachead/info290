There is a different taste to this that some seem to not enjoy but that I just found to be unusual. A mild low abv choice that pairs well with a lot of food styles.","JimKal","Feb 12, 2015"

That said, Boddy was one of the beers that helped move me away from American macros many years ago, so some credit for that. Unfortunately, there are so many other more flavorful products on the market today. What was interesting 20+ years ago is unremarkable today. I read the review by kerouac from California and I think he nailed it; an easy beer to session.","BillyX","Jul 25, 2014"

A light bronze tea-like color with a pinkish cast, with the to-be-expected creamy rich head from the nitro-pour mechanism. This brew gets mentioned frequently as a ""classic"" example of an easy-drinking but now thoroughly commercialized English pale ale and that does about sum it up. Aroma is subtle and initially difficult to discern, although one does get some tinny caramel malt and musty floral hops after a few good sniffs. Palate starts with chalky sweet grains and sharper than expected Goldings hop, eventually progressing to a more tannic grain and metallic flavor that becomes quite pervasive. Some peach and perfumed tea flavor notes remain somewhere in the stew but the overall metal and grain impression is difficult to shake. Thin bodied and very light, maybe a wee bit thicker than a canned bitter like Tetley's, with the expected creamy smooth mouthfeel from the nitro bubbles. Finishes faintly earthy and floral but again the main taste is astringent and somewhat sour. Because of this, I cannot really see myself sessioning this in true English pub fashion.","CalgaryFMC","Mar 16, 2014"

Slightly perfumey; floral with a strong herbal scent near the end. Taste is very sharp, musty, maybe some corn adjuncts, biscuity, minerally and very chewy. Almost lightly skunky like a bottle thats been light struck, except that this was poured from a can. Extremely creamy mouthfeel; almost feels like a nitro poured draft beer. Very different from the American ales I am used to, and one that I would drink again.","Aaron_Ramson","Oct 24, 2013"

This is one of the sexiest pours I have ever seen from a lighter brew. Even with an experienced pour, the head will consume nearly 3/4 of the glass and quickly ""roll up"" the glass into a uber creamy 2 finger head. This creamy head sticks around. The nose is slight, but includes bananas and some malt. The taste is a disappointment from such an attractive pour. It's a little watery, with notes of bananas and very mild floral hops. I enjoy the creamy mouth feel and the brew isn't bad, it's actually very drinkable, but it's lacking in complexity and I wish it were more robust. All that said, I honestly have a similar view when drinking most standard British pub ales, at least this one pours sexy and has a cool mouth feel.","raszputini","May 01, 2012"

The smell of the beer had some light grainy malts on the nose and not a whole lot else. The flavor was a little too light also, but had just enough bitterness to keep me interested. The mouthfeel of the beer is very smooth, goes down super fast. Overall it could probably be better all around but for a simple brew it's pretty good.","Knapp85","Jul 21, 2011"

3.55,11.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"This beer ours a nice creamy one finger head, but that’s to be expected from a nitro beer. The head is completely white, and the body is a pretty standard ale look, dark orangey, reddish color, with hints of gold. The body is slightly see through, but for the most part it’s hard to see much on the other side. I dunno, I mean it looks good, but the color and the transparency makes me feel like the taste will be a little light on this (and that’s considering it’s a nitro beer). This beer does not smell too good though, it smells like a mix between a Blue Moon honey moon and a Guinness, it has that faint honey smell, but also that sour, english malt smell, not much in the way of hops. I mean a part of me wants to say that this smells good because it does smell creamy and honey-y, but another part of me thinks it will just be a lame nitro beer with not much flavor, oh well. I’m reluctant to give this a 3.5 on smell, but I suppose it barely qualifies. Well this beer tastes like it smells, but the tastes are better than I thought they would be. The honey is very nice and subtle, not overpowering at all, and the malts are pretty well balanced in with everything. In the end you get a nice sour taste, I usually wouldn’t like this, but it adds some character, and that’s good in these nitro beers. All the way through you get a nice creamy feeling, which I know is common in nitro beers as well, but I feel like this one is really good. The mouthfeel is very good for an english ale, like I said, it’s creamy. This beer is also very easy to drink, it goes to really fast, without any problems. Overall there are a few bad areas in this beer, but it’s yummy, smooth and pretty tasty!","MaltsOfGlory","Apr 29, 2011"

This is true-to style in terms of very faint hop bitterness balanced by overly smooth and buttery malts. Feels much heavier than you would expect from the beer's other aspects.

Very malty aroma with some slight hops possibly. Maybe a whiff of fruit in there too. After the first sip I am getting a metallic taste to start followed by some light hops and a long bitter finish.

The flavor starts out very bitter from the head, then malt and hops from the beer itself. And then comes my problem with this beer. It has a metallic aftertaste that I'm not really fond of. Sometimes I get it, sometimes I don't. Mostly I get the metallic flavor if I sip the beer. If I take a larger drink, I don't seem to get it. Go figure. Nice creamy mouthfeel, and very sessionable.

There's a slight metallic / astringent tint to this as well. These end up marring an otherwise pleasant finish.

The most abundant smell I detect is metal. Followed by light sweet malt and an extremely faint bit of hops. While the metal taste is present in the flavor, the carmel malt is more evident and there's a very slight bitter hop note. And I don't necessarily hate the metal characteristic. It tastes like clean metal at least... Like a dental pick during a cleaning. I like the creamy texture.

The big disappointment here is that, despite the nitro device, there is a total lack of carbonation. This stuff is like drinking ""flat beer"" or ale flavored water.

Its nose isn't incredibly pronounced, but is reflective of the subtle flavors within. The carbonation is nice and frothy and melts away quickly like the much wider known Guinness brews, leaving a creamy smoothness on the palate after a sip.

I learned my lesson about these things a while ago, but the Boddingtons widget seemed particularly aggressive. Initially, the beer appears to be a nearly solid off-white head, a roiling mass of tiny bubbles jostling their way to the top. The head settles into a stiff foam, like an over-frothed cappuccino. It looks like you could rest change on top of that head. The beer itself is a pale-yellow gold, a bit disappointing after the big special effects display of the nitrogen. The smell is quite weak, which seems counterintuitive to me with such a big head. If that many swirling bubbles can't coax more than a weak, pale malt nose out of this beer, then there isn't much there. The taste would almost certainly improve if the beer was poured from a tap. Right now, it's malty but thin and generic. The feel is a bit watery, which is particularly disappointing when compared to the tap version. I remember Boddingtons having a much creamier, richer feel from my trip to the UK. I had a particularly enjoyable night of drinking Boddingtons once on a ferry from France to Ireland.

3.35,5.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,"The main goal of the nitro widget contained in this can of Boddingtons is to reproduce the beer as you would get it on nitro-tap. It should have a dense, creamy head that remains atop the liquid and also provide a creamy mouthfeel. Making sure the can was not too cold, and my glass was big enough to pour the entire contents, I poured steadily at a medium pace to let the nitrogen exit the widget and into the liquid. If the beer is too cold on pouring I've noticed a complete lack of aroma. This is a very light beer so you've really got to coax out the flavors and aromas. When warm enough you can smell the banana yeast character. The light flavor mimics this banana note. This canned version of Boddingtons is a pale imitation of the tap version because the taste and smell of the head is a slight bit canny or metallic and also a bit thin in flavor and aroma. The mouthfeel ends more watery than creamy. Still, overall the Boddingtons flavor although one dimensional is pleasant.","mshallah","Sep 26, 2008"

The nitrogen does a good job of creating a nice white foamy head that lingers all the way to the bottom of the glass, even if you take a while to nurse the pint. When first poured, the ale has a nice convection-like action as the nitrogen stabilizes, but afterward you have just the thick white head atop a clear amber body. There's little nose on this one, but a very nice and full mouthfeel with a matching full hoppiness on both the palate and the finish. A pleasant bitter aftertaste polishes it off. As a pub ale with nitrogen rather than carbonation, it naturally is a little flat, and thus not as refreshing as some other brews of similar consistency.

The absence of the creaminess takes away from the charm of the nitro-can, but the ""true"" flavor of Boddingtons becomes more apparent.

There is a nectar-like silky smooth mouthfeel with a feint sweet taste, a hint of hops but not a lot by any stretch. There is just enough bitter to carry it and you're left with a mild, non-offensive aftertaste.

Almost as abrasively malty as a malt liquor beer, but not as pungent or acidic. A nice, thikc mouthfeel that was reminiscent of a Guinness (not the one straight from the tap in Dublin).

Mostly clear, just the slightest hint of opacity. Smell is malty, hoppy, smells very much like an ale. Taste is very similar to the scent, though the unbelievably creamy mouthfeel tricks the mind into sensing more maltiness than is probably there. The mouthfeel is amazing, rich like cream, and amazingly thick for an ale. The drinkability is good. I'm personally not a huge fan of ales in general, so it's not quite my favorite, but the mouthfeel really brings it together quite a bit.

Pleasant flavors of fresh plum juice, honeydew, and a hint of banana mix with barely-there biscuity malt and a nicely contrasting bitter bergamot-infused hop finish. A little bit of mineral character comes through in the finish as well. Hop bitterness lingers. As it warms, this hop flavor begins to resemble the spiciness of Saaz. It's surprising how much this tastes like an English attempt at a Belgian pale. Thin mouthfeel really makes this a close-but-no-cigar semblance of a cask ale. Actually, it's nowhere near the flavor or consistency of a cask ale, but the nitro widget is put to what is likely its maximum performance here. A quality beer in my book.","orfeu","Sep 28, 2006"

I've never had a beer to lace better. As for a pub ale, it's lightly hazy and medium straw colored--I expected more copper color. Aromas are extremely faint, but I can pick up some light malt, corn, and a little sourness. Tastes are fairly muted as well, but do pick up on some subtle sweetness, corn sugar, and maybe some other cereal grains. Light souring from fermentation provides a bit of granny smith apple flavor. That's basically it. Not much more exciting than Budweiser. But the mouthfeel is where it is at. Creamy and full feeling. Almost chewey. Finishes wet and fleeting. Dangerously close to watering down.

Abundant lacing creates a jigsaw pattern of lace. A winey aroma can be detected in the background, accompanied by pale malt and fuggles hops. A very even balance of sweet pale malt and fuggles is the foundation of the taste; but an annoying vinous flavor is apparent from the first sip to the last swig. Simple but pleasent taste, and appropriate to style. A fruity ester appears in the aftertaste only as it warms. The nitro creates a flat carbonation, but is creamy and very smooth in the medium body and boosts the drinkability. However, the finish is slick and the acidic vinous character ruin the overall presentation and knock this out of contention for a good session ale.","PBRstreetgang","Feb 28, 2006"

This time I took my time, and it does lose something if you wait too long and miss that creamyness.

From the cascade to the head consistency, the feel in the mouth to the fairly intense lacing - they're very similar. It's a smooth and very drinkable beer that you can just put down without even realizing. The appearance is simple but pleasant with a light honey color. The head is thick and marshmallow like, and it just won't go away. Not much of a nose, which would probably be its biggest problem. This is a classic though, and because of that, its not the most complex. It's a staple, not something that pushes the boundaries, and it should be appreciated as such.

I do enjoy this beer, but I usually like to eat something along with it, (eg: a meal, Chips or Penuts) otherwise towards the end of the beer a bad aftertaste develops and needs to be neutralized with a different taste.

There is a perfume-y apple juice smell, laden with pungent notes of other fruits (banana and pear, I think). The taste is bland and safe, but not bad--the same fruity smells surface on the palate. But there is an awful pang of plastic midway through that is really pretty disgusting. (Fortunately, the plastic pang is short-lived.) Tis very thick to drink, and the carbonation that I was expecting (given the head and bubbles) somehow hardly exists at all.

I'm not really sure why people swear by this beer, it must be a process of socialization. Just as bland and unsatisfying as it is on nitro-draught except with a further metallic, minerally taste. Creamy mouthfeel, but that's nothing new with a nitro can; that's about all it has going for it. I've been told from one Englishman, ""It's the best thing to come from Manchester"".

Tea and light hop aroma gives way to a mild herbal malt then disappears. If looks are deceiving, the malt body is thinner than it looks.

Exceedingly smooth and malty taste creates a nicely drinkable beer with a fine mouthfeel. That being said, nothing stands out about the taste, which starts out somewhat bitter and gets sweeter.

Nitro has to be a marketing gimic.  (ever compare nitro guiness to the bottle?)  On the outside Boddington is a decent and drinkable beer, inside however, a fraud.","Jordan","Jul 21, 2002"
2.62,-17.6,4,2,2.5,4,2.5,"Using a golf reference, if it's drive for show, putt for dough, this beer is all show.  The show is good too, is just doesn't make up for a below average flavor.  Clear dark gold with a very creamy, milk white head.  Not really much aroma, just a hint of malt is all I can catch.  There's a difference between bitterness that has flavor, like a good Am. Pale Ale, and a beer being just bitter, like some light beers.  Unfortunately, this seems to fall in the latter.  The finish has a metalic quality too that isn't enjoyable.  Mouthfeel is nice with an smoothness that makes is go down easily.  I guess I'm not overly impressed with nitro cans in general, beyond the opening.","garymuchow","Jul 21, 2002"

3.69,16,4.5,3,4,4,3.5,"This is a beautiful beer...ohh what a sweet pour! One of the creamiest beers I have tasted. It's very similar to Caffrey's, especially in appearance, but I think it has much more flavor. Very smooth, and the mouthfeel is excellent. Quite enjoyable!","IrishRedRock","Jul 17, 2002"
4.6,44.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"I love this beer. The cascading effects is amazing. Great session beer. I bet its even better on tap. It's taste is smooth and pure, with a nice amber color with a bueatiful head.","Reverand","Jul 14, 2002"

3.68,15.7,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"This is a very nice looking beer that doesn't quite live up to its appearance.  It's not bad and definitely better than its canned brother, but it's lacking a bit in flavor.","mickeymac","Jun 14, 2002"
2.93,-7.9,3,2.5,3,3.5,3,"Clearish darker gold, 3/8 inch head after settling in glass.  Head is milky but not impressve in size.  Very little aroma.  Literally no flavor other than a sense of malt denseness and a tad of hops at the close. Mouthfeel is average other than lack of carbonation.  Its almost like drinking a glass of slightly sweetened whole milk.  One of the poorer nitro cans I've tasted, nothing tastes bad, nothing tastes good.","ADR","Jun 10, 2002"
4.08,28.3,4,3.5,4,4,5,"This is one of my fall back beers.  I cannot believe I have not reviewed this yet; I guess it got lost.  Having this beer on tap, it's almost like a light Guiness.  I do love the Nitro, even though it does not add anything to the actual taste of the beer, it does make it creamy, and it does look terrific.  It is so smooth with some buttery/ nut flavor that invites you to drink more of it.  This is a great beer to drink at all times, all year round.  It is also a good beer to give to someone who is just beginning their venture into the world of real beer.","AaronRed","Jun 09, 2002"
3.23,1.6,4,3.5,3,3.5,3,"20 oz. nitro can. Has the potential to be a much better beer. Pours a thick creamy yellow, with a big fluffy head, the nitro really foams this beer up. Cascades nicely. Smell wasn't especially bitter or noticable. Taste was really average, not much that jumps on your taste buds. Some hoppy bitterness, but overwhelmed by the creamy head and bubbles. The creamy feel and then watery finish is what really takes over. I also tried it on tap at my local bar, and nothing changed. No real big flavors to note. I expected so much more.","StevieW","Jun 03, 2002"

3.84,20.8,4.5,3,4,4.5,4,"A very creamy brew. Pours an excellent golden color with a large creamy white head on top. Taste is very smooth, with a slight bitterness, but nothing overwhealming. The smell of the beer is about average, nothing really stands out about it in this area. Overall I like this beer, light, smooth and creamy, and easily drinkable.","usualpulp","May 30, 2002"
4.19,31.8,5,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Boddintons:  English pub ale.  Very creamy beer.  Thick amber color, thick dense head. Incredibly smooth and sweet.  Very easy to drink, highly recommended.","jackndan","May 29, 2002"
2.37,-25.5,4,2,2,3.5,2.5,"This is inferior to the draught. I bought this can because of my draught experience.  Looks somewhat similar to its brethern, but head is thinner and smaller.  Taste is more metallic, and the sweet biscut flavor is lighter. It is also more bitter.","psugrad98","May 29, 2002"
3.3,3.8,3,3,3.5,3,3.5,"I had a friend that kept trying to hook me on this stuff.  While it's not a bad beer, I tend to agree that it suffers being in the crazy can it is in.  Would be intersted in seeing a bottle version of it.  I like the taste, but it suffers from the influence of the can and the contraption they put in it.","Wildman","May 23, 2002"

2.69,-15.4,4,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,"Although the nitro widget is a total gimmick, one must admit it looks pretty cool.  Typical well - retained, thick, creamy head as expected from a nitro can.  Golden hue, nice clarity.  Just a hint of earthy Fuggles in the nose, not much else there.  Somewhat artificial hop bitterness and flavor, with a metallic note and the slightest bit of esteriness from the yeast.  A bit of diacetyl surfaces as the beer warms.  It's a bit weak and watery in mouthfeel.  Finishes clean and bland.  Boddingtons is nice to look at, but there's not much in the way of character in this brew.","marc77","Mar 19, 2002"
3.99,25.5,5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"the cascading effect was amazing...but that's where the amazement ends.  the head does coat the glass the whole way down.....but i found this ale sort of boring.   i wouldn't assasinate it like some reviews i read, but it's nothing special.  it's full bodied and creamy smooth but i do detect the slight metallic hoppy aftertaste which i didn't find too offensive.   i'd drink it again.","budgood1","Mar 08, 2002"
3.36,5.7,4,3,3,4,4,"I feel like I'm going against the grain here and rating this somewhat higher than the rest, but I enjoy this beer.  Its a blond Guinness.  I have no problem with blonds or brunettes (or redheads for that matter).  This pours to a very, Guineess-like creamy sideshow and settles into a very, low carbinated thirst-quencher.  These go down very quickly.","proc","Feb 19, 2002"
1.66,-47.8,3,2,1,2,2,"Extremely disappointing.  Typical nitro-widget can creamyness, but whatever flavor the beer had was overwhelmed by the nitrogen infusion.  What I did get was a fairly bland, slightly metallic flavor with hints of husky tannins.  Warming was of no benefit.","Brent","Jan 11, 2002"
