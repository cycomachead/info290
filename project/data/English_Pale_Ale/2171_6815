Aroma is bready, with a touch on the doughy side of things, a little herbal, a touch floral, and slight fruity essence. Flavor pretty much followed suit, but with a bit of it thinning out in the finish. A crisp, active thinner medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, I really enjoyed this session ale a lot. Nothing crazy or standout-ish, just a solid sessionable EPA that I could drink over and over. If it made it out Colorado, I am sure it would be a regular in my fridge come summertime.","denver10","Jun 24, 2013"

Lacing holds up nicely with carbonation giving the beer much fullness in the mouth. Very enjoyable for it's weight class. Featured hops are Golding and Fuggle- this isn't your West Coast pale ale, still full of flavor. 21 IBUs. Text on the bottle suggests you shouldn't drink this beer alone. Guess I blew it.

Taste is caramel forward, a bit grassy, some breadiness. Taste mirrors nose, fairly caramely, lacking a bit in balance, though for a EPA pretty close to style, hops really subsumed by the malt. Medium mouthfeel, soft, acceptable effervescence. Nothing remarkable, though the bready notes helped drinkability. Frankly, I'd rather have a Mirror Pond.","jdense","Jun 20, 2011"

Smell is somewhat muted, hard to smell it over the aromas wafting through the restaurant. Smells like fresh floral hops and bready malts, hints of citrus. Tastes especially like bready/biscuity malts and bittering hops up front, very malt forward pale ale, english style for sure. Some caramel and more bread in the middle, then a subtle hop bitterness in the finish that lingers for quite a while. Medium-light bodied with very low carbonation. Extremely smooth mouthfeel, sticky bitter lingering dryness coats the mouth. Tastes more like an ESB than a pale ale in my opinion, extremely balanced.

On the tongue, 8th Street packs a little more hopping in the bottle: there's a pleasing bite of citrus with a hint of resin. The English style malt is right there too.

I like this beer the first few times I drank it, but as I've had the chance to try some more complex beers, this one seems a little less impressive every time I drink it.

Wasn't sure what I was looking for, but saw they had the local microbrewery there and brought a 6-pack of their EPA home. Dark gold, light copperish, and very clear. Head doesn't last but leaves a light tan ring around my glass. Aroma of malt and English hops. Beer is well balanced, and a good example of the EPA style.

The flavor is nice, also crisp but with a pronounced hoppy flavor and a nicely balanced malt / bitterness combination. Some hints of cinnamon and maybe a little caramel are apparent. Very tasty, very nice for its style (I'd take it over a Bass any day), just also not very adventurous (granted, this isn't an extreme beer style, but it could use a little pep or more ale-like character.)

Server came back both times with a brew lacking any kind of a head, just a ghost of one ringing the circumference of the glass. Beer itself was a shade lighter than your standard amber...red-gold might be the best way to describe it. Good shot of hops up the nose in the aroma, some grain/floral notes. Beer had the same tea-tang I experienced with the brewery's Peach beer. Are they adding Lipton's to every batch? Not much bite in the taste, the hops seeming to expend their force in the nose. Maybe I've been conditioned by Sierra Nevada, but I usually expect the hops in a Pale Ale to grab me by the throat. finished with an aftertaste of tea.

Slight lacing, but what does form stays put. Light amber in hue, with a light malty aroma. Flavor is of light malt, which is partnered rather well a complementary amount of bitterness. A bit of a metallic aftertaste kind of detracts from the whole experience. Nothing terrible about this brew, but no cause to trumpet it's existance either.","ppoitras","Feb 04, 2004"
