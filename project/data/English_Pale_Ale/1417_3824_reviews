"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, no bottle dating. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy bright orange color with a 1-2 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon, orange zest, pear, apple, honey, toasted biscuit, light caramel, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of bready malt, fruity yeast, and earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon, orange zest, pear, apple, honey, toasted biscuit, light caramel, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Slight earthy herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, orange zest, pear, apple, honey, toasted biscuit, light caramel, and herbal/toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. very nice robustness and balance of bready malt, fruity yeast, and earthy hop flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and moderately creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 4.7%. Overall this is a very good English pale ale. All around good robustness and balance of bready malt, fruity yeast, and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"Very enjoyable."

"Its a fun themed beer that uses a gimick to get its audience. but decent for a gimmick."
"Bought it once for the gimmicky bottle, bought it twice for the smooth great taste"

"Holy Grail Ale is my favorite beer. I have only been only been drinking for ten years and i have had alot of different beers. I am by no means an expert connoisseur but i do enjoy its malty taste and feel."

"Murky deep gold pour with off white head. Lite floral nose. Biscuits and rose petal flavors. Lite mouthfeel. Ok."

"Sweet smelling and tasting beer. No sign of hop bitterness anywhere. Very thin body and feel. Beautiful dark caramel color. One dimensional taste, no different layers to the flavor. Easy drinking beer. Has a fuel kerosene smell that is not that unpleasant."
""
""
"Side note: poured from bottle at McNellie's Public House.in Oklahoma City. Cool bottle, not so cool beer."

"Little sweet malty scent but not too aromatic. Off white head dissipated quickly. Tastes slightly sweet, malty and maybe a little yeasty. Nothing to write home about but more than I expected from a gimmicky beer."

"Fun, novelty & not too bad.  I guess I expected more from it considering name, price & the fact that it is ""tempered over burning witches"".  Lots of understated flavor, just not overly remarkable.  I put it in the have to at least try it once category."

"O - Very enjoyable beer with a variety of flavors.  Light-medium body makes for easy drinkability.  Not overly complex but not expected to be.  Nice session beer.  3.5/5"

"Very nice ale, have consumed many and would recommend it. The fizzy head and lack of lacing detract from the appearance. Still not a tasty as a Yorkshire dark ale."

"This beer was ok. I liked the beer but it was ok to me. I would not mind trying it again, it has been so long since I have had this beer I actually have forgotten how it taste. I remember that it had a fruit flavor to it and that is all that I can remember. All I know is that I did not mind drinking this beer. If I could find this beer again I would have no problem trying it again. All that I can remember about this beer is that it was ok."

"Overall - It was good, but not great."

"Poured a clear amber with a thin foam of white and with a nice level of carbonation bubbles going up the glass. It looks rather nice, though it could use more head. Still rather true to style. Scents of toasted malt, floral, earthy and herbal English hops, that lend a nice, earthy, tea-like quality and a hint of caramel and slight, apple-like fruity esters. A fairly nice aroma that is true to style and inviting, if a bit subdued. Still quite well done. Flavor begins sweet, with hints apple, toffee and faint caramel and a mineral water quality. This sustains throughout the sip. In the middle an extremely faint hint of herbal hops comes through and sustains into the finish. Finish is very faint herbal hops, apple, toffee and hard water. Aftertaste is pale malt sweetness and mild herbal hop flavors with a bit of honey. Not a bad flavor profile for the style, though fairly subdued and mild. The flavors that are there are true to form and quite enjoyable on the palette. Mouthfeel is light bodied, with a moderate, yet smooth feeling carbonation level and a drying feel, slightly chalky feel. Quite good, feels like a pub-style ale and is easily drinkable. Overall this is a fairly good, though fairly standard, English Pale. It hits the style notes, but doesn't knock them out of the park. Still, it's easy to drink and there is certainly nothing wrong with it, so it's fine in my book and worth trying just to say you've had it."
"Overall: Pretty basic EPA. Nothing spectacular and nothing bad. Just really simple and easy to drink."

"great for a tasting party or the British humor fan. good beer all in all"
""
"O-a decent beer. I have had much better English ales, but also much worse. Sorry the Monty Python thing doesn't sway me either way."
""
""
"The taste has all the expected elements of a sweet English Pale Ale with sweet malts, toffee, and a slight bitter finish but nothing the overwhelms. I used to drink the original English version and I think it is superior to the American-brewed version. But this still holds its own in a pinch."
""
"I got this purely because of the name of the brew, which I'm sure was Black Sheep's market gimmick. It worked. Overall I was not disappointed, but I have had many beers that were better. The appearance suggested it would be an Amber or wheat ale, but the flavour was much more bitter."
"Had this one a while back, but was so s**t-faced I don't remember what I thought of it. Anyway, saw it again and had to grab it. I mean really, anything tempered over burning witches can't be bad, right? Well, for what I can only regard as a novelty beer, it's not bad. Not too bitter, nothing sweet, and with decent carbonation. It's beer. Very drinkable. I could easily pound a bunch of these and have a great time. Recommendable. Cheers!"

"O - An OK beer but will not get again."

"Overall: My first English Pale Ale, so I can't speak too much about how this stacks up to others in the style. Overall, this was a very easy drinking beer with some muted malty notes and a dry finish. Glad I had it, but I probably wouldn't get this again, as I prefer English Bitters over this."
""
""
"The carbonation in this beer starts off stronger than it finishes, as each sip flattens out on the end. It remains crisp, but it goes fairly limp on the tongue from time to time. Smoothness suffers a little. The overall dryness runs from beginning to end."

"OK though not mind-boggling. It looks lovely, but this is its best aspect. The aroma and flavour are balanced but rather dull; stewed hops and ale yeast notes abound. Body is alright. Not a bad brew but nothing special - its fame begins and ends with Monty Python. Goes down easily enough but no need to seek it out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not terribly unique, but good stuff. Much better all around if it's not so cold (yeah, well, it's English). Very, very drinkable. Think ""Green Onions"" by Booker T and the MGs; nothing earth shattering, but a groove that'll make you smile. I'd have another one."

"i really didn't care for this one, and after finally trying it, I see why ive overlooked it for so long. it pours a standard golden color, clear, with an oatmeal looking head without much retention. the nose is sweet English malts, a little on the stale side, and a slight skunky aroma. the flavor is about the same, with the sweetness being quite intense in the end. its got a tin body without nearly enough carbonation, and has a sort of spoiled aftertaste. its grainy and light, for those who get off on that sort of thing, but its a far cry from the best English ales. maybe its better from the bottle, but im not sure ill invest in another one of these anytime soon. average in every sense of the word."
""
""
""
"Overall: A decent session but lots of tart and tanginess."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is very easy to drink and can be considered sessionable. It's rather complex for a light-bodied beer."
""
""
""

""

"O: Overall a solid drinker and would have it again not the least bit unpleasant and very refreshing."

""
""
"3.25/5"
""
""
""
""
"Given the style and the taste, I recommend being cautious with your food pairings. This beer is probably best as a stand-alone session beer, or paired with something light. I was snacking on pita bread and hummus, which proved a good match."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Decent amber ale color. Smells like blatant gummy bears. Much more complex than you would expect. Definitely on the sweet and fruity end. Good beer for the summer sun. Decent drinkability. Tastes better than a shitty novelty beer--not awesome but better than you would expect."
""
""
""
"Overall: bit of floral and spicy bitterness, but nowhere near enough carbonation, not strong enough and not well put together. After 15 minutes it feels like a headache too."
"Drinkability: It is crisp, clean, and tasty. All around good stuff in my book."

"O- Still can't figure out how this is an ale. This is not an ale. This is definitely not the Holy Grail of Ales. This is a marketing ploy. The bottle is kind of cute, especially the part about being brewed over the bodies of burning witches, but this beer is all hipe, and no hops. Stay away, stay far away.... unless you like Miller Lite at 4 times the price."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- this one was a 'meh' for me. It's not ad but nothing about it makes it beyond average"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Now why aren't more beers tempered over burning witches?? Anyway, this stuff pours a clear copper topped by a finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises biscuit, dry grass, light honey, light flowers, and a touch of cedar. The taste holds notes of caramel, light biscuit, grass, and a pinch of vanilla and powdered sugar for the sake of it. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a nice EPA, one that's mild without being boring, and one that lends itself to a high degree of drinkability."
""
""
"O - a decent English Pale Ale"
""
"O-not something that I want to try again"
""
""

"Total 30/50"

"Monty Python's Holy Grail Ale poured a darker golden color, with not much head. The aroma was weak, and had hints of floral notes. The taste was had a profound malty backbone, with hints of a floral hoppy flavor. Easy to drink, and a little lite in flavor. Overall this is a solid average beer, has a stronger malt flavor then other pale ales; enjoyable but nothing spectacular."
"O=Not what I expected, but somewhat enjoyable. This would be worth trying again with a meal ...I could see this being consumed in quantities before a football game while grilling out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- No complaints here. This obviously isn't one to seek out but its a better alternative then adjunct lagers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I stayed away from this one for a while because of the negative reviews. I finally broke down and purchased it in a mixed six. I am glad I did."
""
""
""
""
"Food match: Roasted killer rabbit... if you can catch one (tip: you'll need the holy hand grenade of Antioch). Also African Swallow carried coconuts go well with this beer for some reason."

"O - Overall a decent brew that offers sessionability and a decent depth of flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: High drinkability. A British session beer. Not good as Monty Phyton"
""
"The beer is copper to amber in color with a tiny, fleeting head that leaves virtually no lacing on the pint glass. The aroma is weak, with faint scents of malt, biscuits, a hint of citrus. The flavor is unassertive and fairly bland. Hints of malt, bread. A bit of astringency in the finish. Overall, this was mediocre. Monty Python is hilarious, but this beer is unremarkable."
""
""
""
"O-very disappointing, gimmicky, won't seek out again..."
""
""
"Beer is thin, very thin, a little grainy, creamy, yeasty, mild biscuit, it tastes OK but it is a boring little beer. Not a repeat."
"O: Crisp, sessionable, yet more like a sequel than the real deal. It's just a flesh wound. If I'm going to drink like the Knights of the Round Table, quench my thirst with a brew that slaps me from my horse and dances silly jigs while farting in my general direction."
"O- One and done- it was a freebie, and went well with the pie- but the label is more appealing than the beer. Oh well, not bad."
""
""
""
""
""
"Review from 4/2011 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours an nice orange amber. Thin white head with no lacing. Aroma of sweet malt and with a buttery element. Taste is not quite as nice as the aroma, but pleasant. Sweet malt, slight grain and a hint of hops. A somewhat abrupt, dry finish. A pleasant, but not outstanding ale. Not bad really for a gimmick ale."
""
""
""
"O: Did I possibly get a bad batch? This is a terrible tasting beer. Would not recommend."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: It wasn't bad. I like it better than the aforementioned in taste. Not high on it though."
""
""
""
"O- Tempered witches? Nah. Decent beer? Yup."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a clear, pale, copper coloring with a thin, white, frothy film covering the surface of the brew. Aromas of toffee and roasted nut sweetness, with a hint of hops. Flavors are rich and tangy sweet, with toffee and hazelnut characteristics cleaned up by a peppery hopping at the end of the palate. Very light bodied and a steady carbonation feel throughout, with a thinning effect on the flavors. The aftertaste is light and short-lived, with some of the toffee and roasted characteristics shining through. The finish is quick and clean, leaving a clear palate behind."
""
""
""
""
"C+"
""
""
"O; Will drink this one again. Whimsical label"
"I wouldn't go out of my way to drink this if I were you. And I don't plan on having it again."
""
""
"Bottom Line - This is a dull boring beer that lacks flavor."
""
"Poured a clear amber, medium white head. Aroma and Taste is a light fruitiness, some toasted malt, and grains, and a bit of grassy notes. A medium body, carbonation is moderate. Finish is some toasted malt, barley yeast, light fruity and grassy notes and some light hops. Overall seems a bit lacking in flavor and aroma, just an average brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D/O - Drinkability is moderately low. This beer has a nice vision, but strays away from the path too erratically for me to fully get behind it. The hops are almost non-existent in the taste, replaced with a strange malt bill and sweetness. I'll leave this as a novelty beer; fun to try once, but I will not seek this out again."
""
""
"O: A beer that is some what out of balance and has a large amounts of yeast/musty smell and tast that over takes the rest of the flavors in the beer."
""
""
""
""
"O: An easy-drinking beer; I could see putting several of these down at a time. Originally I had this one scored lower, but then I read more about diacetyl and how it is an acceptable aspect in an English bitter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - If this were strictly novelty, it would be impressive, but I think they were shooting for a serious beer. I wish this was a bit more pulled together because it does have good flavor, it it just seems a little all over the place."
""
""
""
"O - Not impressed. Maybe it would be better for people who appreciate the nostalgia from the Monty Python movie, but I don't care for it and will definitely not buy this beer again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a pretty mediocre beer in my opinion. The flavor is light and simple. There's nothing intriguing here."
""
"Poured this English Pale ale from a bottle into a pint glass. Poured a hazy amber color, produced a very nice white head, very nice retention and lacing left on the glass. The aroma of the pale ale contained citrus hops, herbs and fruit. The ale is medium in body, with the flavor of sweet grain, sour apple and bitter hops, finishes slightly dry. Overall this ale was ok...okay session beer but nothing i would rush out to buy again."
""
""
"Says to serve cool, so I did. It has the color of copper with a thin, bright white head. Didn't notice any carbonation. Aroma and taste are the exact same, a faint grass/grain with a hint of malt. It's rather underwhelming in flavor & aroma but it is an ok beer. Its a fine grassy flavor, just weak. Very smooth and extremely easy to drink. Not bitter at all. A little dry afterfinish. Nothing really special, but a decent beer."
""
""
""
""
"Get rid of that weird funk so those hops can shine through, and make the mouth feel creamier and less astringent, and this would be a decent Pale."
"Notes: My 100th beer review. Meh, not bad. Easy drinking, not expensive and an abv < 5% make this a sessionable, if uninspired ale. Could do worse, merely a flesh wound."
""
""
""
""
"O - I have no idea if this bottle is old or what, but it doesn't taste like it is at its prime."
""
""
""
""
"Pretty average beer, if its free go for it but if not there are definitely better options."
"Overall it was an OK beer but not really for me. It was drinkable but I won't seek it out again."
"O - This is a decent English pale."
"O-its ok. not bad at all. mostly got it as homage to one of my favourite movies. you have to spell with ""ou"" as well"
"O: Decent English Pale ale. Thought this beer would be a gimmicky beer - but it was pretty decent."
"Reviewed on 10/24/11 @ apx 1800-1830 CST"
"RATHER NICE, WORTH TRYING!"
"Overall - This is very good for being a pale ale."
"O: Maybe the bottle I tried all those months ago wasn't so fresh? This was better than i remembered it being, and the tinny scent from the one I had in July was not present. It's still kind of a gimmicky brew, but worth picking up a sixer of."
"Nothing really spectacular tastes wise. I think of it more as a novelty beer. Perhaps it may taste better fresh from the brewery. It is a shame but I think the trip across the pond really does a number on these English beers."
"Light transparent yellow color with short-lived one finger head, very mild biscuity scent with a vague nuttiness and light whispers of floral hop scent, tastes rather on the sweeter side, with a wee touch of citric hoppiness, medium bodied, inoffensive but also somewhat generic. I'm probably not going to be seeking this one out again, because in my book it is the very definition of the word ""average."""
"O: Refreshing and very drinkable. Not much to smell or look at though."
"Pours a light golden color. Good head retention, with some lacing. At first, the taste of a slightly bitter grain, but after I swallowed, I noticed a distinct sweet fruitiness. Almost like sweet grapes. There's a subtle bitterness and it's just a little watery. Good, but not great. There's nothing that really stands out about it, other than the title."
"D - Overall, not bad; after it warmed up a bit, I started to like it but it really wasn't a beer I was fond of; I would pass on this, as its really struggling to figure out its identity, is it a ale or lager; stay away from this Jackal/Hyde drama"
"Overall - This is really smooth and actually pretty tasty. The balance is really nice, you get a bit of everything with it. Only draw back is its not a big beer, the flavor isnt over the top strong, this is pretty mild but still has plenty of flavor to enjoy. Really impressed."
"I poured this beer into a pint glass, it has a nice clear golden color body and has a nice 2"" white cramy head, that lays down quickly to a lace around the top of the body. The smell is hoppy and some malts. The taste is balanced well between the hops and malts. I get a little lemon and some spice coming through to. This beer has a good mouth feel and overall a good beer."
"O--This is an okay beer. I prefer my beers to be bigger and have a thicker mouthfeel. This one was just a bit too creamy for me."
"Eh, to hell with it, just drink it and enjoy it. It's not bad."
"The aroma is malty but a bit hoppy. There was not much head to it. I would say about a finger and the carbonation in the body was thin. The body itself was golden. It is mainly a malty beer with a well hopped finish. The mouthfeel is medium and a bit slick. It wasn't bad I would expect more for the price."
"I had been a fan of the Monty Python since I was in 7th grade, so when I came across this I had to try it. The beer poured out as a typical golden color with soapy white head on top. The smell of the beer smell like an ESB, lots of malts and grains on the nose. The taste of the beer has a solid bitterness to it with a semi-sweet flavor in the mix too. The mouthfeel was nice, had a pretty good amount of carbonation to it and was just a bit lighter than medium bodied. Overall I found this ale to be enjoyable and would probably have it again one day."
"Overall a decent quaffable ale."
"The mouthfeel is smooth but backed by a nice punch of carbonation. Not to much but enough to give it a nice acidity. A really a nice session beer that goes down easy and is a joy to drink."
"Bluh."
"Summary - Overall a good beer. Very drinkable and balanced. A neutral choice, which could be a disappoint to some, but if you're in the right mood, this is a good ale choice."
"Light bodied but not thin. Slightly creamy. Overall, a great session beer. Easy to drink summer guzzler."
"I have to admit that I boosted it's overall grade simply because I have an affinity for Monty Python. If I tried this in a blind taste, it would be the one I always forgot about. It's not a BAD beer, it's definitely drinkable, but there's nothing to set it apart."
"This was an enjoyable selection but nothing spectacular. There are other ales that I prefer over this."
"Overall: Its not a bad beer but its not a good beer could be better if there was a bit more going on"
"pretty hoppy nose - floral, maybe a bit earthy (is that the burning witches?). flavor is utterly non-descript. not bad, not good. as others have mentioned, feels like 95% a monty python gimmick. there's waaaay to many beers out there to be drinking gimmicks!"
"Not a beer i'd seek out to drink, but one I'd hand off to my buddies who appreciate Monty Python shows/movies."
"Absolutely underwhelming. Nice novelty for Monty Python fans, but beer fans will want to avoid this one otherwise!"
"I was genuinely surprised to see the group score on this was so high. Poured a 1/2"" soap suds head which quickly dissipated to nothing. Hazy tea color. Smell had a hint of skunk but also a little hops and malt in it. Very mild ale in flavor but there's a little caramel. Really a thoroughly average beer to me. And my sample says it's from Rochester NY so it's not like it genuinely was imported. Anyway, fun name, but I'd say you buy this once due to the label and then move on to other things."
"Overall: Had this before with better luck but this one is flawed."
"Overall- This is a good beer, but way overpriced. Its a good beer for a warm sunny day but its pretty much just an easy drinking beer."
"Overall I have had much better pale ales and this one was ok to sample but not really the full cost to buy a whole pint. Still very cool of Carnivores to do flights for beers like this so you don't throw down 5 bucks for something you didn't love. Pretty good beer."
"Cheers!!"
"12 ounce bottle, bought as a single at World Market. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a dark golden color with an inch off-white head. Head retention is good with a decent amount of lacing. Aroma ia bready malt, grassy hops, dried fruit and some butterscotch. Taste is similar to the aroma, but it seems a bit weak compared to the aroma and there's also a slight bitter finish. Mouthfeel/body is light, it's a bit crisp and has good carbonation. I think it's an average overall brew. Worth trying if you can buy it as a single, but I wouldn't pay for a 4 or 6 pack of this to drink by myself."
"Overall. Great session beer here. Enough flavour to keep a guy interested, but light and crisp enough to drink a bunch."
"Drinkability - I'd drink one just to say I had one. You know, it being Monty Python and all. But I don't see myself ever going out of my way to pick up another."
"Poured a clear light brown with a large frothy white head that dissapated quickly and had fair lacing. The aroma was pleasant with the scent of caramel malts, a sweet yeast and a mild grassy hop. It tasted mildly sweet in the beginning and finished about the same with a hint of caramel and hops with the flavor being very light and fading quickly at the finish. Mouthfeel was light in body and watery in texture with a soft carbonation. Overall a very, very mild tasting brew. I think I like the name better than the beer."
"I'd recommend this to anyone who likes an easy-drinking Monty Python themed beer. If you like both of those things this is definitely the beer for you!"
"It's just a damn good beer... like the Holy Grail, it cannot be described, only experienced."
"I purchased this at a local beer superstore. This is one of my favorite movies and the bottle caught my eye immediately. I chilled a mug and poured it from the bottle into the mug. The first thing I noticed is a nice color, it a light rust color. Then as I smelled it I couldnt wait any longer to drink it. It went down smooth with a little bite in the after taste. After I took one drink I couldnt wait to drink more. I drank six of them that night while watching a football game. I was very happy with this beer and will purchase it again."
"I bought the beer because I like Monty Python, and I could see a six-pack of this going quite well with a movie marathon. ;-)"
"Drinks pretty well. A very nice brew."
"This is not a terrible beer, but it is far from good. Or even adequate."
"D: I have never drain poured a beer as I always try to find something redeeming. I know just because I don't particularly care for something doesn't mean it is bad. But this was close. Honestly, if someone handed me one I would drink it, but if they asked before hand if I wanted them to get me one, I would turn it down. There is nothing overly wrong with this beer, but it is a constant disappointment at every turn. Honestly, I would save the $$$ for something else."
"Monty Python's Holy Grail Ale has a light orange colour and a crappy head that dissipates very quickly. The smell is slightly bitter and yeasty/grainy. The taste is grainy with a clean, slightly musty finish. It's quite carbonated, so it has good presence in the mouth. This beer is decent and very drinkable, but nothing exceptional."
"Mouthfeel is medium with a crisp amount of carbonation."
"D - Nice taste and a good mouthfeel and aroma results in a very sessionable brew. That being said, I feel I can do better."
"D: This is an entirely unremarkable English ale, not bad by any means, but absolutely nothing about it really jumps out at me. The entire time I was drinking it, I was thinking ""This tastes like beer"". I almost want to buy another one to see if I notice anything that I missed the first time through."
"D - An extremely drinkable ale, would work well as a session beer."
"Has a mild spicy bitter taste with hints of cinnamon. Has nice amber color with a moderate head that dissipates quickly. A lot better than I thought it would be. A nice drink on a cold winter night. I think the ""Knights of Ni"" would appreciate a pint of this"
"Not a beer that I would go out of my way to have, but at the same time I wouldn't mind having if it were on offer at, let's say, a party or get-together."
"Drinkability- Obviously, this isn't my favorite style, but this beer is okay. I might drink it again, but it would have to be another free bottle."
"I was looking for a nice tasty treat that doesn't knock your socks off and this was a good choice."
"Overall: I wasn't expecting too much, so I wasn't disappointed. This is ok."
"As a Monty Python fanatic, had to try this. Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Showed A light amber yellow with frothhy white head, little retention and lacing. Smelled earthy with some sweet malts. Taste bready up front then some earthy hop bitterness to balance the sweet malts. Medium carbonation, light-medium body but still fairly tasty, good session brew."
"D - This is an okay ale. Fairly typical to the style. Not amazing but tastes good."
"An easily enjoyed brew, you'll want more than one."
"Drinkability is pretty darn good. Thanks to the low ABV which is nigh undetectable, nonexistent bitterness and pleasing, if fleeting, taste, I could easily knock back a few of these in a session. A solid brew with an interesting theme. It still didn't tell me what the airspeed of an unladen swallow is though. Might have to dock it a few points for that."
"True to style, good session beer. Looking forward to the Life of Brian to come out hopefully made with wolf nipple chips."
"D - Refreshing and low in ABV."
"D - Definitely. I could see having a few of these. Nice English Ale."
"Further notes: Unless you've already got one, the search for the holy grail ale is not a bad idea if you want something on the cheap side, english tasting, sessionable, and like Monty Python. I was impressed to find more than a cheap gimmick (albeit one I loved) to this beer. It's not a top notch pale, but it's still quite good."
"17 September 2012 EDIT: Two years later, I can confirm my initial review. I am altering nothing but the letter D to O (and the rating from 4 to 2.5). There is a light, English Ale fruitiness in the maintaste unmentioned in my initial review."
"D- Drinks rather nicely on a hot summer night. A lot higher quality than I was expecting."
"Drinkability- 4 out of 5. I didn't expect a marketing gimmick like this to be so delicious. Considering its overall lightness and low ABV, it would be a victory for beer drinkers everywhere if Monty Python's Holy Grail Ale replaced the trashy light beers on tap around America. One could definitely make a session with this beer, as it's hard not to quaff."
"M / D. It's wet and sweet and frankly, stale tasting. I'm sure this is way past its prime, and this review would be patently unfair save for the fact that there is simply no way to tell how old the bottle is. Monty Python comedy is alright, but if you're going to use the name and logo on your beer, is it too much to ask that you make an effort to put your best product forward? Apparently it is. Disappointing, and left unfinished. Do not go out of your way to find this beer unless you have it on good authority that it is fresh. To this beer, I say ""Ni""."
"Overall, this is honestly not a bad beer. i have had much worse. i would drink it again, and i do recommend to give it a try at least once."
"D - Definitely more drinkable than the taste or mouthfeel would lead me to believe. It's good to sit back and have a few of. Great conversation piece too."
"I tried this beer on November 27, 2008 after purchasing from one of my local LCBO outlets. The beer poured a translucent reddish-gold with a bubbly tan coloured head and plenty of effervescence. The aroma was grainy and skunky and not at all appealing. Definitely an ESB. The mouthfeel was medium bodied and medium carbonation (despite the effervescence). The flavour is bitter with some grain and citrus notes thrown in."
"i would possibly drink this again. it's not my first choice, as english ales rarely are, but it's definitely quaffable. i expected something much worse considering the cheesy Monty Python theme."
"Tried again in 2012 - seems a bit more dialed in, light biscuit, honey, and lavender flavor. Carbonation is tamer. Still not great, but decent."
"Overall, I really liked this beer and hope to drink more in the future. It seems to be more on par with Samuel Smith's Pale Ale than Bass Pale Ale, it just has a higher quality feel to it. I highly recommend for anyone looking for a good session beer."
"The 4.7% ABV sits well within the brew and I thought it very easy to drink and I'll be having more."
"Overall, the mouth feel is smooth and lightly carbonated, but because this brew leaves no challenge for the pallet at all, and stirs no excitement for me to buy it again, I had to give it a 2.5 for drinkability."
" The fact that the bottle had Monty Python on the label it was safe to assume it was from the UK or at least a British Style Pale Ale. That is exactly what I found in the nose. Fruit, bready yeast, maybe some butter...a splash of alcohol and a dash of hops (the Earthy spicy kind). The taste fit to what I had smelled and been preparing for...very English. Toffee, caramel, toasted bread. The finish leaves a sweet buttery coating on the tongue that quickly passes. The thin body and medium carbonation make the HOLY AIL an easy drinker. So go ahead and grab a sixer... the brew is quite good not just a gimmick."
"D: Tried this one for the bottle. It tastes far too much like a bad brown ale for me to want to drink it again. Much too sweet and slick for my tastes."
" I'm not exactly going to be running back for more."
"Body is light. Carbonation is fairly light, as well. Watery feel. Not much to get excited about here."
"Overall there's nothing exceptional about this beer, nor anything really awful either. It's relatively cheap, so probably worth a try if you come across it. Otherwise it's nothing to go out of your way for."
"Very good clear, amber color. Head lacing like a champ. Super tasty brew - toasty malts balanced very well with the bitter end. Went down smooth and satisfactorily. A most excellent pair with my fish sandwich. Delicious."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. I could easily have another one. I think the beer is much better when cold and not as good as it warms up, which I think is odd for an English ale but I'm not complaining. For an ale it also has some lager-like qualities at times, but overall a good drinkable beer."
"I regretted ordering this one. This beer doesn't do justice to the group it attempts to honor."
"Overall, this is a decent example of an English pale ale, a style which I am not particularly a fan of. It's not hugely flavorful, but it is very smooth, which I suppose was the goal. All in all, it's an all right beer, but not one that I will drink again."
"This is definitely one of the worst craft brews I've ever tasted. I've had it on tap and in the bottle before, but nothing's changed."
"D- Did not feel myself wanting another sip of this beer very often other than to make sure that I was correct in my assessment of it. Maybe this was a bad batch of it, I will have to revisit."
"Just not much to say about this beer, cool bottle though (doesn't hurt that I'm a Monty Python fan), but this is a below average beer sullying the name of a funny comedy troupe."
"D) A nice brew. I'd have another."
"I got this beer in a Cleveland hotel bar, it was this first time I had ever seen it on draft, so I decided to get it. The beer is as one would expect, golden in color with a head that easily dissipates. The smell is all malt with no hint of hops. The first sip is sweet with slight carbonation that never dominates. Overall this beer is average, for malt lovers theirs plenty of malt but nothing for the hop lover in me. This is a traditional English pale good but not great"
"D- Not very good."
"D - Certainly drinkable at 4.7%, though I think my taste buds would grow tired of the unfortunate blandness long before my liver gave up the quest. To this beer I say Ni! Ni! Ni!"
"All in all, this beer starts off good, but definitely does not deliver. Not worth hunting down, let this one go."
"The body was the highlight of the beer, not that that's saying much, but the sharp creamy body was nice. Other than that.... I'm not impressed. It's probably safe to say my quest for the Holy Grail ended in disappointment."
"D - Over all, this beer is simply... well... simple. But not in the way that keeps the best English PAs well-rounded but still pleasing. I think that this beer's saving grace would be that it would probably be decent to pair with most foods. A fair attempt at the style, buoyed mainly by the kitsch of the name."
"Would definitely recommend this ale. Great with chicken and suspecet it may be good with pork too."
"Notes: Well balanced but fairly subtle flavors. Kind of a middle of the road beer, but it's a decent British session beer. Other than the novelty factor, I probably wouldn't search for this specifically, but it may be worth a try."
"I got this in a mixasix at Lakewood Spirits Unlimited. I poured this into a Sam Smith nonic. Appearance is a golden colour with fizzy white head and minimal lacing. Very grainy smell, and the taste is somewhat malty with a light hop profile. Mouthfeel is fizzy and light, and this is not one of the best pale ales I have ever tasted."
"D - Great. Good ""standard"" sessionable beer. I'll remember this one."
"D- Surprisingly refreshing drinking this beer. Compared to its american counterpart, this is definitely a lot more quaffable which isn't too surprising due to the low ABV. Overall I thought it was ok, but nothing too exciting."
"This poured a clear gold with quickly dissipating off-white head. It smelled like roasted barley and nutty malt, with sweet and creamy yeast and some copper hops. It tasted like nutty and light caramel malt, with creamy yeast and some copper hops. It was watery with moderate carbonation, and had a mild bitter aftertaste. Overall this had a very basic taste, but it was clean and decent. The body was passable, so the beer was no problem to drink. However, that's not a strong compliment. Aside from the name, this beer is totally forgettable. At least it wasn't offensive to try."
"It was an easy-to-drink light pale ale. Nothing fabulous but nothing to knock down either."
"I had tried this beer once before and not liked it, but I found it pretty good the second time. Certainly not a great beer, but not a bad beer either."
"D) Alright. Maybe its the style, but I did not particularly care for it. Boring."
"Overall - I would really enjoy this beer if it weren't for the bubblegum flavor, it's really off putting and not very pleasant. Really though, it's one of my favorite movies of all time so I just got it for the bottle."
"The whole thing is not a game changer, and it won't knock your socks off like the Killer Rabbit, but it is a solid session beer, and a nice example of an English Pale Ale. Very sessionable."
"Mouthfeel was light, a bit flat. Drinkability is very good, I've had this on tap and in the Bottle, I think I perfer tap."
"Overall a bit boring,"
"Drinkability - an easy beer to knock back, and a fine one to toast a job well done. Thanks Lori. ;-)"
"Drinkability: Good for the style but not great overall. This has a very smooth and nice biscuit taste. I could have two max."
"Very drinkable, good beer and one I avoided for a while, now with regret."
"12oz bottle purchased at McKinnon's in Salem. Pours a crystal-clear amber body with a good inch of short-lived off-white head. Smells biscuity with hints of nut and hay. Tastes malty for sure, with hints of nut, biscuit, butter, and herbal hops. Light bodied with ample carbonation. A pleasant, drinkable, subtle brew. Not horrible, but not much going on here really. Similar to Bass in many way. Not bad."
"Drinkability: Very enjoyable beer. Not too heavy on hops, very sessionable. Definitely something I'd drink again if given the chance."
"Drinkability: A decent drink for something I honestly just picked up for the novelty of the label. Little did I know that someone actually put some work into making this beer tasty. Try it!!"
"Subtle interesting complexity, as I would expect from a true English pale ale. Worth a try."
"this is a pretty drinkable beer, overall i was pleased with this brew."
"Drinkability: Not bad at all, more than just a gimmick. However, with so many different styles and brands out there, this won't be one I seek out again."
"(bottle poured into pint glass) Pours a dark amber, light copper color with small quickly diminishing head. Smells of flowers with a hint of citrus. Thin drink with lively carbonation finishes slightly dull and bland. I was hoping for some of the flower and citrus to translate but it did not. Interesting choice for name and label, but there are better examples of the style out there."
"D - To me theres nothing bad about it, its just average to me. Seems like a novelty pretty much the only reason I got it was because the bar was selling it with its ceramic goblet. Theres better Englih pales out there"
"The taste is lightly caramelly bread dough and grain, hint of apple, a bit sweet with light leafy-grassy bitterness and perhaps a hint of lemon right at the finish (I previously had noted light lemony-citrusy-leafy bitterness, toasty bread with hints of caramel and fruit). It is pleasant, but a bit thin and barely noticeable as an actual English ale. Feel is pretty good, solid, but a tad on the thin side and nothing particularly great."
"And now for something completely different..."
"T- Tastes very basic, like a lager, not really an ale. It is crisp, but with little flavor. Sells off its name more than its taste."
"I like this beer, but I don't love it. I'll certainly have it again, though. It is a refreshing, subtle beer that won't challenge, but also won't offend. Tends to get overwhelmed by food, though, so stick with lighter fare when enjoying this brew."
"Pours an orangish amber color. The smell is of generic grains, cereal and there is a hint of sweetness, an apple like smell. The taste is very crisp, a sweet apple taste is in there with some easy malt grains and a slight hop bite at the end that is very small. The mouthfeel is crisp and moderately carbonated. Overall it is a very drinkable beer, it is not overly complex but very smooth and refreshing."
"Not bad in its own right. Kind of a novelty. A one time purchase for me."
"A dark orange/amber color pour with a medium sized rocky white head , some light lacing left behind , medium carbonation .Aroma is lightly malty with a bit of floral hops . Flavor is of caramel malt, ripe apple , and a bit of hops, lightly bitter , short fruity finish . A crisp mouthfeel , medium body . A good try , nothing offensive but nothing to bring me back for another . Quite sessionable ."
"d - would definitely reach for a second if I had one on hand."
"This beer pours a golden yellow, with a 1-2 finger of of fluffy white head. Head retains rather well and leaves some decent sticky lacing. Nose is of grains, grassiness, some sweet fruits, and a bit of a malt character. Taste is well balanced, nothing overpowering or stands out - some grassiness hits you up front, grains and breadiness hit the middle with a sweet malaty character at the end. Lighter side of medium body with moderate to high carbonation, goes down rather smooth, slightly sweet aftertaste to it but it doesn't linger all that long. This is one to sit with for a night, nothing jumps out but well done and easy to sit with."
"A full flavored ale - decent bitterness with notes of roasted malt. Very easy to drink, but there is no sacrifice on taste. Carbonation is a little heavy, but would probably be tempered on cask (if it's available). Mid level ABV makes this an option for session drinking. Aside from the carbonation, this is a solid ale. Recommended."
"Something about this was really good. I loved the flavor of this beer. Super drinkable with a nice mouth feel and interesting flavor. good citrus flavor with some pine from hops. It wasn't very carbonated, but thats fine by me. I would love to have this again. I highly recommend this if you want a drinkable beer thats different than the from the usual."
"Overall a easy drinking pale ale."
"12oz bottle. Pours clear copper with a smallish eggshell head that disappears without leaving much of a trace. Smells of typical English malt, that's to say sweet, bready, and with some caramel. Light hop character. Very mild taste, with straightforward (boring) malt character again taking the lead. Hard to find any sign of hopping here; nothing really floral, nothing citric, no pronounced bitterness. Medium body. Nothing special, though I'm wondering how old this bottle is."
"Like a good Pale Ale, it was nice and rounded, balanced with a decent spice background."
"Notes/Overall: I have to say I was surprised. When I reached for it, I had a choice of the old reliables at my local beer warehouse. It was a sort of ""what-the-Hell"" choice, and in the end- a good one. A surprise. Pretty danged good!"
"Pours a clear, copper/orange color. 1/3 inch head of a white color. Poor retention and decent lacing. Smells of yeast cleanliness, grain, pale malt, and slight hops. Fits the style of an English Pale Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of pale malt up front, then grain, slight sweet malt, pale/dry hops, and some yeast cleanliness. Overall, a decent pale ale with good drinkability."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink EPA, but nothing out of the ordinary. Would love to have this at a pub in England, instead of bottled at home."
"D: Not exactly the most exciting beer around, but a sturdy, drinkable English Pale Ale. This would be very sessionable. Solid."
"Malt is definitely there on the palate, thick and sticky with a biscuity kind of sweetness, thick and full mouthfeel. Hops are there in their earthy, tart goodness but finish is grainy, like cereal, with a brown sugar kind of flavour to it that somehow manages to re-emerge after the hops have done their lingering magic. Hence very, very back of the palate is somehow quite sweet, although for the most part a slight lemongrass bitterness is prevalent. Not a bad English ale, apart from that lingering sweetness there's nothing unusual about it. Taste is a bit plain overall. Could well be used as a cleanser though."
""
"Not a terrible beer, but I was hoping for more than the gimmick."
"D- an easy beer to throw back however the tartness takes away from how many i could put down."
"T/M: Smooth beer that is perfect for a Florida summer's day. Starts sweet and tart with a slow transition to the hop bitterness in the back."
"D- Decent beer, not one of the best but not too bad."
"Overall, not an impressive beer, but the name is cool so you figure you need to try it."
"The taste is very clean and somewhat watery. I appreciate the light flavor as it's over eighty degrees outside, but I was looking for something a little more flavorful. There is so little flavor with this beer it really reminds me of a macro lager. Nothing at all special about it. It's very drinkable and I could see it possibly being a gateway beer, but it is substandard when compared to Sam Adams Boston ALe or Lager. I've seen this on the shelf for years and never tried it, now I'm glad I didn't buy more of it."
"Taste is very smooth and it is highly drinkable, although the taste is fairly limited in its complexity. Some rind added to the mix is nice though."
"Bring out your dead cause this one is actually pretty good! I expected some half-assed novelty beer to taste like shit but I was pleasantly surprised. It's not bad! It really is a true crowd pleaser as well, meaning your non-beer geek friends would enjoy it at the Memorial Day picnic and would be overwhelmed. It's a tad more malty and a touch more bitter than say a Heineken(with an Ale taste of course but not too bad, very clean.)"
"Hey, it's a drinkable beer. I just wonder if this is simply a ""plonk some branding on the beer"" beer. Relatively light, and while not terrible exciting, it goes down well enough."
"Not a great beer, not by a long shot. But much better than I was expecting for such a gimmick. I definitely don't begrudge the buck."
"pours a honey color with a short head quickly fading with a minimal lace. slightly fruity nose with a biscuit malt taste and not much else. mouthfeel weak, watery, carbonation was good, tight and crisp. thats the best i can say for this beer its a pass by in the store."
"I bought it for the novelty of the name, I suppose Black Sheep was banking on this. The movie is still one of my favorites, I laugh at it all the time; the beer... Not so much."
"The feel of this beer is a little less of a bitterness than expected. Refreshing and crisp it does have nice drinkability and can be quite refreshing."
"Had this at the Houston Flying Saucer. Poured into a pint glass. Appears a cloudy light brown color. Malty and fruity in the aroma with hints of orange, lemon and some honey. Fruity in the taste with some light spice and with the hop bitterness lightly kicking in the end. Very easy to drink. Will definately try again."
"Easy to drink. If the flavors were a bit more pronounced, I think this would be a much better beer. Overall good, a decent session beer."
"D - Went down smooth. I could finish one, but I don't know about more than that."
"D: Not bad. Given the light heft and basic blandness, it goes down pretty easily. It's not an offensive beer; it's just not an interesting or enjoyable experience to drink this one."
"D - You know, I don't think I'd ever buy this if something a little more interesting were available, but if someone brought a huge case over and forced me to drink it, I wouldn't object in the slightest. I'm probably drinking this in the wrong season - it'd be a perfect summer ale, and it's perfectly sessionable."
"D - Clean and light enough to drink alot of. After getting through about half the glass though, the stickiness gets to you."
"Overall - Nice bottle... shame about the beer. A very dull ale..."
"As others have noted, this is a typical English pale ale. It is a well-crafted brew with no obvious defects. Positives to note are the lovely, creamy head; a noticeable floral aroma; a smooth, well-balanced flavor with definiite hop presence but not so as to overpower the malt. The complexity and balance of the caramel malt and hops are such that this ale keeps ones interest over time while not overpowering the pallete. Could easily sip on more than one of these in an evening."
"Final Thoughts - This isn't exactly a beer you buy more then once. You buy it because you see the Monty Python reference, get a laugh and say you'll give it a shot. It's pretty good and a bit interesting, but it's nothing exceptional. I certainly didn't feel cheated, but it's not such a standout that it's worth a second purchase."
"On a side note: I don't think I'm getting enough burning witch flavor."
"Off-white head and a clear copper/orange body. The aroma is very floral and a little fruity. Taste is mainly of the floral hops, tiny amount of diacetyl as well. The aftertaste kind of reminds me of the skin of an apple. Overall it's a pretty solid beer."
"D: Quite drinkable. I didn't sense anything particularly special in this, but it was still nice."
"Golden colored beer with a rapidly fading head.Aroma is fruity.Taste is bready,fruity with a hint of caramel or toffee.Overall a beer that isn't great but it isn't bad either.I personally would buy again and would recommend for someone to try at least once!!"
"This beer was decent overall, nothing too out of the ordinary. They are drinkable, though, and with an under 5% ABV you could easily drink more of these. Not bad, but not great either."
"Drinkability: ""Blah"" is what I wrote as I reviewed. I guess that means low. Maybe I just got a pull off an old keg, but this one won't be on my list to try again."
"Served in a mug at a local pizza joint, this beer was a golden color with a small white head. Both the aroma and taste were subtle, to say the least. Very faint caramel, sweet fruit, biscuit. Nothing really stood out. Still, it was easy to drink, and one could probably down a few of these in a sitting."
"Drinkability: Not much goin' on here, but at 4.7%, that's ok. Just a reasonably balanced, simple, straightforward brew. Can't say it'd be a go to for me - it's not really my style - but it is what it is, and I won't knock it for that!"
"It's pretty smooth with good carbonation. Certainly worth the try ."
"D- Decent flavor with a nice clean finish. No funky aftertastes. Surprisingly good."
"Though it is decent or a little better, it seems more to be reaching for Monty Python fans than to be a great beer. I might revisit it just to tell everyone I found the Holy Grail."
"Pours a clear amber color with a thin white head. Not much in the way of lacing, but there is some. Smells of apples mostly. The taste is the same, green apple tartness. There is a bit of malt sweetness and a very nice hoppy finish. Its a bit thin, but overall a very drinkable brew. Most excellent, and deserving of the Python pedigree."
"Also, I loved the Python art work on the lable."
"Easy to drink but so is bud light. Seems more like a gimmick than a tasty craft beer. This would be a great gift for someone who drinks BMC and is a big fan on Monty Python."
"When the side of the bottle says serve cool, listen to it on this one. This is an ale that would benefit from some severe icing down."
"A good steady pale ale. Not mind-blowing, but certainly not bad."
"D-I expected more after the nice appearance and aroma. Not bad though."
"O- considering that their name is a clever marketing ploy, i wasn't expecting much. that being said, it's not a bad beer at all. at 4.7% its a good session beer. Not the most complex or most tremendous beer out there but worth a drink."
"This beer poured a clear golden yellow color with about a one finger white head that dissipated to a thin film across the top. The aroma was of fruit and also a bit yeasty. The flavor was a bit fruity, and was balanced by the hops. This just seemed to be lacking something. Okay, but forgettable."
"Glad I tried it once but this isn't anything special. The packaging was what initially sold me and it turned out better then I thought but it's not great."
"Overall very solid English Pale Ale. Not too bitter and pretty drinkable as well."
"Drinkability: This is an interesting beer- drinkable through the ABV. Flavor profiles are unique and would serve as a nice change-up from other pales."
"D: Good, not great, but for the entertainment value, worth the purchase.. Sit back and put on 'the Holy Grail"" and have a good time, with a good beer."
"Average beer but I probably wouldn't buy again though"
"Pours an amber brown colored body, with a small/medium sized head, good sized bubbles, and good lacing, but diminishing. Has a very malty aroma, some hops, nutty earthy. A malty, dry bitter taste, lightly acidic, with a metallic aftertaste."
"Good flavor, pretty decent atmosphere. Really solid for this style, in my opinion. Overall, good quaff."
"Drinkability: style is just like a typical English Pale Ale; easy to drink; not bad but definitely not a favorite, nothing so special here"
"Nikki"
"Future outlook: Decent, refreshing ale, but not terribly interesting, and not worth the premium price tag."
"D: Not a bad beer at all. I was expecting it to be a gimmick beer, but i picked it up at Marsh on State road 135 south of Greenwood. They have a little section where you can make your own sixer for 8.99. This beer is very drinkable you should try it on it fits quite nicely old chap."
"500 ml bottle. Pours a golden, orange-amber color with very little white head. Aroma is mainly malts, grain, bread, biscuit, and a touch of floral hops. Flavor is sweet, caramel malts, resiny hops. Light bodied, dry, flat mouthfeel. Very drinkable, sort of indistinguishable though."
"A very good, sessionable ale with only 4.7 % ABV. Nothing outstanding, but the flavor keeps this one interesting."
"All this makes for a very refreshing, and very sessionable beer."
"D: A great Pale Ale... Wish I had more of these !!!! I would love to have more..."
"Pours golden in colour. Thick white head that doesnt last long. Very little lacing. Can smell some citrus and caramel. Not that much carbonation. Buttery, caramel like taste with a little bit of bitterness. Overall it was a smooth, well balanced beer that I would definately have again."
"Drinkability: Not recommended. Save yourself the drain pour and dodge this one, folks."
"Mouthfeel is light and somewhat watery. There's no complexity to speak of but if you are looking for a simple session beer this might fit your needs."
"Notes: I ordered this (the ""glass of the month"" this month at Winking Lizard) with a bit of trepidation but it proved to be very enjoyable indeed. I would not hesitate to buy this again. I recommend it to anyone."
"Notes: A good session brew. Well balanced."
"Certainly not one of the best beers I've had...won't be trying another."
"A very average English Pale Ale."
"Overall, I was suprised that the beer is that good, I bought it only because I am a fan of Monthy Python and it is nice that it is drinkable as well."
"A watery mouthfeel, I wasnt too impressed by this, just a typical english ipa"
"Came to me a copper-amber color with a thin off-white head. Lacing wasn't to be seen here. Good color, though. The aroma was on the sweet side with honey, fruit and a little bit of lemon zest. The flavor was even sweeter and the lemony citrus was more prominent. There was some herbal hop flavor intertwining with the sweetness, but as it warmed the sweet toffee and lemon grew stronger and less enjoyable. Medium body with light carbonation. This is one I had never seen on-tap and had yet to try, so I couldn't pass it up...but I will for now on."
"Pours a cloudy golden color with a thin wisp of head. Has a faint hop smell. Taste is very crisp and there's a definite apple taste to it. Each sip is very refreshing and the apple flavoring adds a nice little touch.. a pretty solid english pale ale."
"Pleasantly surprised with this brew, really. Not bad."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Medium-light on the palate with a dry finish. Carbonation is delicate and is not over the top. In my opinion its level is just near perfect, it compliments the sweetness of this beer quite well. This is one I'll definitely pick up again, I really like this beer, its turned me back on to English styles. Unlike some of the English Ales I've had this one is not packed full of diacetyl...a characteristic I don't find all that appealing. Overall a well made beer, and one that I'll give another go round to."
"At first pour, the glass smells like an imported lager. I suppose being shipped across seas in the summer will do that to a bear. After a little time its warmed up and I get a crisp grain aroma with lemon. The flavor brings out more of the lemon and herb hops in the aftertaste and mellow malts up front. The flavor is pretty mellow, but it's got a nice finish and its very drinkable."
"The witty name of the brew drew me in, but it takes more than a name to bring me back for more."
"D - Not going to revisit my fridge if it costs $2/bottle in the future. I'd gladly pay $8.5 for the six pack but even that's pushing it simply for the vanity."
"d: quaffable. very easy drinking, lightly hopped, a tad on the boring side. Would be just another beer if not for the Monty Python connection."
"Poured a honey orange color with a thin white head. Nose was honey-like sweetness. Taste was a grainy with English malts mixed with some honey and a little bit of hops. It was pretty bland and not that good overall. I would not drink again. Many b etter English Pales out there."
"Pours a nice light copper, near yellow color, with some very nice head and good lacing. It has a slight pub bitter taste, but nothing very strong; well balanced. It goes down very smooth, nice and light. I had to give it some extra drinkability points due to my love of Monty Python."
"- Very refreshing and drinkable, but not as robust as I want in a good craft ale."
"Thick and heavy, belying it's low ABV. I would not drink this beer again soon."
"D - More than drinkable and I plan to purchase it again. This would be nice with all sorts of food."
"A keeper."
"Not as smooth as other English ales out there. Solid, but not spectacular."
"A slightly cloudy deep amber color with a whispy off-white head and moderate lacing. The aroma is pineapple banana with a toffee/caramel background. The flavor comes on as a tart banana and caramel malt blend in a very thin textured feel. Pretty easy drinking but I would like a little more body here. Carbonation is equally whimpy, not sure if it's the beer imported from the UK or the tap here at the British Beer Company in Hyannis, MA. Very sour though, which sort of spoils any of the banana malt subtleties of this ale. I would tend to say that this brew has gone bad but I have nothing to compare it to but good taste! The folks at the bar were good enough to sample the tap themselves but assured me that it was true to taste and I opted to leave about one-third of the pint for reclamation. The sourness just didn't taste natural to me and I've had this from a bottle and don't recall such a rough ride on the taste buds. It has some interesting notes but if this is really supposed to taste so dishwater sour, then I have to give this a low score and warn all comers of a let down."
"D- I would say overall this is less of a ""craft"" offering than I had expected. It about a one leg up on something such as bud."
"Drinkability: Looked great, smelled okay, tasted less okay. Still, worth getting (and keeping!) for the label alone."
"Serving - Bottle to pint"
"I recommend this for anyone to try at least once."
"Drinkability - A little more filling and substantial than I expected for a 4.7%. Still, a good English pale you could have a few of, even if it is just the novelty talking. try it"
"Overall, a pretty drinkable, slightly above-average EPA. Doesn't live up to the marketing of it (being a Python fan, I had hoped for something more impressive) but a generally decent brew."
"D - A little more filling and substantial than I expected for a 4.7%. Still, a good English pale you could have a few of, and could count on to be versatile at the table."
"A selection at the new local ""Pub"". Served in an imperial pint (20 oz) with a light medium bubble head and an orange bronze color. Smells of raw sugar cane and a bit of pineapple. Taste is bitter but dry with a brief sweetness followed by a sharp but not by any means overbearing bitterness finish. Very light and refreshing for an ale. Actually seems to lack some body. A good ale for a lager drinker to start on. Highly drinkable."
"It certainly looks good but fails to deliver in the taste Dept. It is a little thin on flavour - but it is a pint I could enjoy drinking all night"
"500 ml. bottle that pours a shady copper orange color with a huge rocky tan head that leaves nice lacing.The nose really has'nt much,a little fruity with some buttery caramel overtones.Taste is tangy,bitterness,and sweet hitting you in that order,the fruitness comes out at you right after and than the bitter kicks in again with some malt blending in.Medium with a satisfieing mouthfeel to this one.Quite a good ale,i must say,well worth a try,cause i'll surely have it again myself."
"Poured a 16.9oz bottle into my Boulevard pint glass. This beer pours an amber orange with a thin beige head. The aroma is bready up front with just a slight hint of citrus hops on the finish. The taste is mainly light caramel malts with a lemony finish. It's really a tasty brew. The mouthfeel is full but not overly so. It's a highly quaffable brew."
"Mf/D: Thin to moderate feel. I could drink a few pints of this with no problem. Not as good as black sheep, but its a good epa."
"There are too many weird, non-complementary things going on in this brew, which may work for its label namesakes, but not for the stuff in the bottle."
"I just love Monty Python's Holy Grail so naturally I had to watch it while drinking this brew. Between gufaws I took sips and was surprised by it's smooth, flavorful taste. Poured a rich tawny color with a head that can choke a ladened swallow. Initially aroma was of caramel malts, some sugars, and a piney hop backdrop. Taste was similar and nicely balanced with roasted caramel malts in the front and a bittering hop finish. All in all a decent brew that must be kept away from the killer bunny!!"
"This pours an organish-brown with a nice head. It smells very sweet, with grass, hops, and a touch of burnt malt. It starts out with caramel and brown sugar, then the hops kick in and turns very bitter. Personally, this was not my cup of tea. This beer has an excellent mouthfeel as it goes down. Overall, this beer did not warrant the price I paid for it, but it was pretty decent overall."
"The taste is light too, very drinkable, with a good bitterness, decent hop. Maybe even bitter orange."
"Pours a nice amber color with a short and thin tan colored head that laces the glass all the way down. The smell is of nice roasted malts and some peppery hoppy aroma as well. It tastes of nice roasted malts, then some citrisy and peppery hops as well. The mouthfeel is nice and fresh and crisp feeling which makes for a drinkable beer. I would recommend this beer for the taste and then for the collectable bottle for the monty python fan."
"The novelty of the name and label gave me low expectations for this beer, but it is a pretty solid drinker."
"Overall it's a decent beer, nothing to write home about except for the tempered over burning witches part."
"Good quality, but not the best value."
"A hoppy smell mostly, light and airy to be honest, but some faint citric notes and some pear/apple smells also. The hops come out at the start, as this beer some sharpness to it. Tart and citric (apples, pears, lemons), this beers also gave off a light coffee malt/biscuit impression. That may be just me, but it contained a malt presence on the backend. A good, balanced ale, but to be honest there's nothing spectacular about it and the MP thing is just a marketing tool to get people to try this beer...and it worked."
"Have a few, heck at 4.7% have a bunch. I don't have much to say about this one, but it is enjoyable."
"In my opinion if you want a easy to find English Pale Ale stick to Bass."
"D: Ok drinkability, a gimmicky name cant make this anymore then what it actually is, an ordinary English pale ale."
"D: Passable, I suppose, but really nothing to write home about."
"In the end this is an easily enjoyable ale. I've had it before and I will surely have some again."
"D-Drinks well, not heavy. Could drink several at one sitting."
"Don't drink and review."
"Not bad..."
"Drinkability : a good beer in the style English Pale ale"
"It should also be noted that I bought this beer along with a Fullers 1875 that had a freshness date of 2005, so this beer may be old too. Take this review with a grain of salt, chips, and more beer."
"I am a fan of English Ales ... Not English humor ... could never sit through an entire Monty Python movie.. but all and all .. this brew is pretty average."
"silliness."
"D: Not too drinkable. Not much of a taste to it and the mouthfeel did not do that good of a job to assist the taste overall. Definitely could have been better. The smell made me think it would have been better than it actually was."
"Slainte!"
"Overall, this is a surprisingly drinkable beer. Not the most complex taste, but it definitely keeps you interested."
"Notes: This one is a bit of a surprise. I like the sweetness of it it's intersting. Oddly enough it's not bad."
"D = Very drinkable. Would be great just for an occasion when in the mood for an English pale ale or excellent candidate for session drinking."
"D- as a fan of english beer, they all are highly drinkable to me. the bottle is gimmicky and fun and that adds to the experience."
"I would have to say that this is a beer one could get drunk to really fast, lets say 3 of these along with a couple of low point beers would get you shotally titfaced. I cannot say I would buy this one again. but I dont remember too much of the night when i started it out with this one."
"D - Smooth and easy drinking. A nice session beer."
"Still more drinkable than even Corona though."
"Final Statement: The green apple quality is a bit too much for me. Could not finish this beer."
"D - Overall very drinkable, had a nice balanced taste in my opinion for an english ale"
"Pours clear gold with a medium sized head. Nice lacing. Aroma is malty with some light fruit note. A touch of grassy hops. Light british malt flavor. Sharp hop bitterness. Finishes cleanly. Crisp. Well carbonated. Fairly drinkable. Not as malty as most English Ales I've had. Fairly average brew overall."
"Poured from bottle into pint glass. Pours a nice golden orange color with little head, no lace and very little retention. Smell was very enjoyable. Had a nice fruit aroma and my first impression was of pears. Taste was a little bland. Nothing terrible but nothing standout. Some malt, good amounts of fruit (apple being a standout) and it leaves a slightly sour aftertaste. Light carbonation and an easily drinkable beer. This isnt as memorable as Monty Python but a good beer."
"Not a bad beer per say, but nothing very impressive..."
"I'll be honest, I only bought this beer becuase I am a huge fan of Python, and thought it was funny. I was plesantly surprised however. This is a good ale. Nothing award winning or ground breaking, but a solid beer, I would recommened. I good, full bodied, well rounded ale. I would certianly get this again, in fact, I know I will."
"Overall a good ale. It's like Monty Python comedy, not everyone will like it but it's worth a shot."
"Still the poo element is not overpowering and something like skunky Corona is much worse. I should emphasize that it doesn't have a poo taste (I guess?!) but does have a waft of toilet smell.Will i buy it again? Sure, but not for my own consumption."
"D: Pale ales in general aren't very drinkable for me, and this one is no exception."
"A brand new bottle will oftentimes taste overly bitter with the first swig but then the flavors begin opening up and blend together as you drink the bottle, it's a great beer to drink during the winter but may be a bit too heavy to drink during the summertime."
"all, a pretty appetizing brew."
"A very distinct beer. A little bit on the bitter side right at first, but as you get near the bottom of the glass, it gets a little sweeter with a slight hoppy taste to it. Pours in a dark brown color, with a light cream colored head that really doesn't last, but still has a slight appeal to it as you finish the beer off. Not the best beer i've had, but not the worst. Try it if you get the chance, just to get a good look at the bottle."
"The bottle is a little bit larger than your average beer, making it difficult to pour. Showed a rich amber colour, cloudy, with a large and lasting rather creamy head. Not very complicated flavour; slight hoppiness in the beginning, and it finished out bitter. Warm and full bodied."
"Pours a clean pale golden color, with a small white head. Aromas that a sweet, and kind of like a gingerbread cookie. Tastes of a standard English ale, dry with a sweet end. Aftertastes of a dry alcohol feeling. More to the novelty aspect, but a decent English ale."
"Pours a reddish amber color with about a finger of off-white head that leaves some spotty lacing. Aroma is fairly mild but pleasant, malts dominate but also present are some fruity esters all of which is accompanied by hints of hops and earthiness. Taste seems even more subdued than the aroma. all of the aromas I mentioned were present in the taste. At the very beginning there is a tinge of malty sweetness which is overtaken by a pleasant fruitiness. The fruitiness lingers into the finish where it is joined by a mild hoppiness with a small bite of bitterness at the very end of the finish when all of the other flavors have fallen away. Medium-light in body with low-moderate carbonation that isn't very noticeable. Drinkability is ok. This really isn't anything special, I'm fairly indifferent about this beer overall."
"D - I guess it's a solid English brew; characteristically bitter (no offense) and the sour apple notes give it a little spice (unless I just happened to get a bad bottle). Nothing wrong with it, but nothing terribly memorable besides the gimmicky label, which, to be fair, is most of the reason this was bought."
"Anything Monty Python gets my attention. Getting past that, this was a delightful beginnning to the end of a warm day. Paid $3.99, I suppose was worth the price of admission. Wish I had another one..bummer."
"I have to admit it, like many others, I bought this beer just because of the name. Looked fine, a light amber color. Two finger thick foamy white head that did not go away. Small was soft grainy malt with a honey-like sweetness to it, but with an earth tone as well. The taste was a mix of grain and wheat malt with a touch of honey and caramel, with a hoppy bite at the end. Even with that complexity, I still came away with the feeling that the flavor was a little macro, a little thin. Above average carbonation and a runny mouthfeel. Somewhat of a session beer, worth a try for the gimmick, but if you want a pale ale, I would sample others."
"having a love for english ales I would say that this one was rather satisfing and enjoyable. Smooth and malty with a dry hoppiness."
"I have seen this all over the place for several years, and now that I work for the company the distributes this, I felt I should give it a go. It poured up rather average looking for an English Pale Ale, with a nice looking white foamy head. Smell was earthy hops with a caramel-like malty note, but otherwise, rather average for the style. Taste was more malty than hoppy, which I enjoyed somewhat. Almost thirst quenching. Mouthfeel wasn't out of the ordinary, but this was very drinkable. I could see myself buying this again."
"From the bottle this poured a orange to brown color with a big foamy head that left lots of big lacing rings. Nose of sweet malts and a creamy mouthfeel. Flavor is again sweet malts, and finish is slightly bitter. Nothing fancy here bout overall a decent brew."
"D- An okay beer, nothing to seek out."
"this bottle must have been old...obviously it was bought for the name/label. poured a light hazy straw/apricot color. off aromas-fishy, funky. also some vegetal and petrol notes. taste was dry, thin, and sour. light and spritzy mouthfeel. drinkability would be fine at this abv but this one had gone bad. i don't imagine they intended to make beer that smelled/tasted like this."
"Re-visit November 2009: I'm adding points to this one. I must have had a bad bottle because the nose is at worst inoffensive, but has some plum and grape skin aromas. It's quite nice. The taste is also quite nice. It is certainly a light beer, a tad watery, nothing outstanding, but certainly a respectable beer."
"The taste started surprisingly bitter and hoppy, but sweet malt balanced it out. The hoppiness became less pronounced as the beer went down. Moderate carbonation and medium body  overall a decent beer, but Black Sheep Ale is a far better choice from this brewery."
"It's a fuzzy yellow beer...do NOT waste your time or money. The only reason to have this beer would be to display the bottle if you've got a collection of beer bottles. The name is pretty cool."
"An OK ale, Ill be spending my $$$ on others"
"Copper in appearance with a thick creamy head that stays awhile. Smell of slight malt, but not much else. Taste is slightly sweet with a hoppy bite to it. Mouthfeel is light - medium. Probably one I wouldn't readily try again, it has the hoppiness but it's not one that finishes clean."
"My first sip shows a large malt profile and strong toasted notes drowning out the fruit and hops I was expecting to at least detect. Metal also sounds in early and often, which is unfortunate, almost like the knights soaked their swords in this beer for a week before it was bottled, not cool. The aftertaste in particular is rubbish. I really wanted to like this beer but I wont be dropping four bucks on this stinker again."
"A nice English pale ale that is pretty tasty. I thought it might be a bit gimmicky with the name and all, but it's definitely a solid beer. A bit on the pricey side, but I'll probably have this again at some point"
"I should have guessed a beer named ""Monty Python"" would be more of a gimmick than a master crafted brew. This beer really didn't appeal to me at all. I probably would have rather had a decent American Macro. I tried to rate it as fairly as possible given my dislike for it. I suggest something else."
"Overall I would say this is just a ""good"" beer, hence the reason I gave it all 4's but like I said up front I thought the movie was a whole heck of a lot better."
"A decent stab at the english pale ale style. Not great, though. and slightly above average taste. Mouthfeel is poor and there is little carbonation on the palate. This beer had a thick frothy head though and it made me look forward to drinking it, but the beer itself was just decent. Not much to it. No frills, but not bad. I want a little more flavor for a session beer. This is a beer to chug in my opinion. It is very very light."
"The bottle is worth collecting!"
"All in all its tasty and I'll probably buy it again, particularly when I want something refreshing, but I don't see it making its way into common rotation in my beer consumption."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a light amber color with a two-finger, off-white, thick head. Smell is not overwhelming but pleasant, with a slight sweetness and bit of hops. The flavor has a sweet fruitiness about it but is well balanced by a moderate hop profile. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with little carbonation. This is a drinkable beer, not bad but nothing outstanding either."
"Drinkability: Nice flavorful ale that goes down easy."
"Drinkability- Not great, but worth trying. There's nothing objectionable about it, it's just not superb. An average English pale ale."
"Drinkable yes, anytime in my new, very fragle, but very cool glass. A nice touch indeed!!"
"Poured a clear nice amber with a huge white head, very slow fade to leave a nice half inch lace filled head. Lots of carbonation. No real gooey glass clinging lace on this. Left a clean glass. Not a whole lot of smell here, what is there is a bready, yeasty smell from the malts, but again not real strong. Pretty typical for the style. Taste fared the same, not strong, not bad at all, pretty average. Some bready and grain tastes, but that was about it, nothing to make it stand out in a crowd. It did have a nice smooth feel, crisp, light, dare I say refreshing, and excellent session beer. All and all this was a typical sessionable english brown ale, more notable for the name then whats in the bottle. A good one off try for the novelity if nothing else."
"I would not go out of my way to buy this again, but it was worth a shot for the novelty, and it was a fairly pleasant brew to boot. Definitely worth a shot."
"Overall: A pretty average ale without any outstanding characteristics. Meh."
"To me this tastes more like a bitter, but I'm no expert on English style brews."
"Drinkability - Nope, not another one for me. Nice to say I tried it, but not a good representation of the style. At least to my taste."
"T/M/D- Almost light on the the pallet...overall bitter body with a very light herbal characteristic. While the body is bitter, the beer finishes pretty clean.... with a very slight fruity sweetness. Not bad, but not great...there are definitively other English pale ales I would grab first."
"Taste is a standard British pale ale. While decently carbonated in terms of head, it is slightly flat in mouthfeel. Taste elements are a nice balance of malt and hops but clearly a bit more emphasis on the hoppy aspect. Woody and somewhat chalky as well. Low abv makes it a decent session beer. Seems like it would be versatile for pairing with food."
"I wasn't all that impressed with this pale ale. It pours a basic amber with a decent head, with some retention and lacing. It's smells quite yeasty, and a bit skunking. The taste is strong and too bitter. There is a notable sulfur and skunky quality to it and it leaves a bit of a sour aftertaste. It's mouthfeel is fair, but I don't see really drinking this one."
"To me, this is a text book English Pale Ale. A tad overpriced, but very true to the style and enjoyable."
"Like so many others, I picked this one up mostly for the name. Pours a deep golden color, carbonation freely flowing upwards, full head that quickly deflates without dissipating. Smell is fruity, with some hops. Taste is hard to pin down...hints of fruits (orange, apple maybe?), hops, slight bitterness, and a dull metallic taste. Mouthfeel is very light, almost feels more like lightly carbonated seltzer water than beer. Drinkability is excellent, goes down smooth and easy. Perfectly capable beer, I could easily see myself picking this one up again."
"Medium bodied and astringintley sticky, I think this batch has an unfortunate amount of tannins or something. Not a pleasant drinking experience."
"It's a decent English ""session"" pale ale. Nothing particularly special about it, IMO. If you are a Monty Python fan, go out and get some - It is ""tempered over burning witches"" after all. I think that if it had more of a nvtty character, it would be more fitting. As a beer itself, it's not bad, either."
"Pours a very clear medium-dark copper with a fairly large off-white head that lasts well and leaves some good lacing. Smell is of fruity hops, lots of esters going on here. Apple and berry, along with some caramel and malt sugars, and a touch of buttery diacetyl. Taste is less hoppy, with the toffees taking the lead. Malts and grains show prominently. Modest butter in the finish. Mouthfeel is a bit watery, lacks the crispness that I hope for in a pale ale, and drinkability is good. Not bad at all, the guys at Black Sheep come through again."
"Like others,I bought this beer because of its name, and I must say that although it's not that bad I probably won't buy this one again;but if it's offered to me I won't think twice about taking it.It has a semi-light amber color to itand has a slight alcohol scent. It produces a nice head that quickly disappears and has very little lace.It's moouthfeel leaves somthing to be desired, but isn't bad, and it has a mild bitter after taste."
"had this on tap at the Berkley Front earlier this summer. poured a nice amber with a nice sizes light tan head that left some nice lacing. aroma got some caramelized malts with some hops, a bit of fruitiness and that is all folks. flavor, not much going on here did get some malt and hops, has a bitter finish which would be the only thing going for it."
"Pours a hazy amberish copper color with a creamy off white head. Aroma is a lot of malt and a slight herbal hoppiness with some diacetyl and strangely a bit of apple. The taste features a good dose of herbal hops, some diacetyl, a bit of mustiness and is a slight bit metallic. Overall, this is a decent brew but certainly nothing that makes me want to drop the few dollars on this again."
"In the nature of its style, this beer is by definition 'mild'. A pretty fun label and name, but unfortuantly quite clement. Amiable certainly, pleasant yes, soothing to an extent maybe, I have only good things to say: but none of them really amount to anything more than temperate. My opinion too, was mild."
"Easy to find beer here, nice gimmick, average beer. Pours orange, brownish color like a regular ale should. Barely smell anything in the beer, what I can is sweet malt. Tastes like candied citrus fruits like orange or tangerine but it's not overwhelmingly sweet, a little bit of bitter aftertaste. Overall it's not bad, nothing to get overexcited about, but nice to try at least once."
"A great show, and a great name for a not so great beer. Pours from the bottle to a reddish orange with medium off-white head that lingers, and excellent lacing. From there, I must say NEE! Aroma is faint grassy, floral hops. Taste is OK, but no flavor in particular jumps out. Palate is immediately too dry, not bitter enough, and slightly metallic. Nice try, but not there."
"Notes: I liked this one. One of the best from a style I generally avoid. This one hits the mark though and could easily be a favorite session beer if priced right."
"Overall: Initial taste was very good, again I didn't like that dried out my mouth."
"The aftertaste is again light, with again a good bitterness. Maybe some light sugary here again."
"Decent beer, but not as good as the movie, run away!"
"This is a tastey beer, but it's one that I want only once in a while. It's not that it's bad, I think one or two satisfies me for a while and I can move on to something else. Finally, I am seriously wanting a Monty Python tap handle. It is a thing of beauty."
"D - In some ways, this is an unremarkable EPA - it expresses the style well. Good session beer IMO, and well executed."
"A fine example of a good english ale, Definitely worth a try."
"This is easy to drink. Very predictable as an English Ale."
"Monty Python's Holy Grail Ale pours a hazy copper color with an off white head from a brown 16.9 ounce bottle. A bit of caramel or toffee is noticeable in the smell. The flavor starts out with the caramel/toffee flavor with perhaps a hint of diacetyl then fades into a lightly metallic hop flavor. Not a bad ale, but not outstanding. Worth a try."
"Notes: I found this one appears to be all about the marketing and label, and could use more substance behind it."
"Taste is zippy with a zesty lemon sourness, unfortunately the malts don't shine through in the taste, a faint roasted flavour the only evidence of them. The Hop flavour is exceptional though, light yet full of life. Not a very good malt/hop balance in my opinion, but not unpleasant either. Mouthfeel is full bodied, and this beer dances on the tongue, unlike so many English ales I've had. Dry and sticks to the throat a little. This walks the line between light and heavy so well, and the hoppiness is quite welcome and refreshing on my palate. A very enjoyable EPA, recommended."
" Seek out this one on-tap."
"Not a bad beer: complex, but the hops are a little dominating, which some people may prefer."
"Buy it for the bottle, I did! It's not a bad beer at all, just less interesting than I expected or hoped for."
"orange-yellow body. Small off white head. Aroma is caramel malt, orange, and a little skunk. Average pale ale flavor here. light hops, bready, sweet background. Mouthfeel is the best aspect of this beer. Not a very good brew IMO, but something I will drink if it's the only beer around."
"A solid example of the English Pale Ale style. Give one of these a try."
"Drinkability: damn good. It would be better if it was a normal price."
"Cheers!"
"Overall, this isn't a bad beer. It seems oddly more bland from the tap then out of the bottle. It's none too exciting either way. As stated in my other review, I can see this as a great ""training wheels"" beer for the uninitiated. Not too hoppy, not overly tasty, but enough there to know it's a good beer. I'll try it again sometime, but it won't be at the top of my list any time soon."
"Light-medium body with a brisk, somewhat watery mouthfeel. With the mild ABV and a pleasant balanced flavor, this one's a very easy drinker worth a try...cheers."
"M&D: not quite complex, this beer retains a very healthy balance and a medium body, while the softly-carbonated mouthfeel ensures an above-average ""quaffability"". It's hard to dislike this beer, just like most British Bitters on form. Yet it's also hard to rate it higher than Black Sheep's other brews, as it's slightly pale in terms of overall complexity, apart from the floral motif. I personally would place it under the Bitter category, but since Bitter also derives from Pale Ale, I'm fine with its identity as it is."
"I will definitely have one again. Now go away or I will taunt you a second time!"
"Pours vibrantly with a towering dimpled head of eggshell colored bubbles of all sizes. Slowly settles with lost of divots forming, leaving sheets of sticky lacing clinging to the sides. A hazy golden caramel color, with minimal carbonation streams. The smell is restrained, slightly fruity, dark fruits rather than citrus. The taste is slightly flat, bittered fruit. Only modest malt sweetness initially, followed by quiet hop bitterness. No hop bite, more of a nibble. There are some barely perceptible caramel notes, but the taste is generally flaccid. There is perhaps a slightly off bitterness that maybe shouldnt be present. The mouthfeel is light with minimal carbonation. Lacking character and commitment to the cause, something seems just a bit askew. Perhaps it was a bad batch of burning witches used for tempering."
"Drinkability: I'd pass on this one."
"Definitely drinkable, and I love to support any beer that's been ""tempered over burning witches", but I'll spend my poundpencefarthings on other choices from now on."
"This brew poured an orange-amber color with a decent white head that is leaving a generous lacing. Nose is of English hops and apples. Taste is of sour apples and finishes with a nice bittering hop. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with a hint of creaminess. Drinkability is good, quite refreshing and sessionable at 4.7 abv."
"Light to medium body, decent but not abundantly carbonated. Overall a little thin, and not as flavorful as I might have hoped. Doesn't really have anything that would have me coming back for more."
"Moutfeel and Drinkability: Very smooth. The cider quality stays with you, which can be a good or bad thing depending on your taste."
"I don't think I will seek this beer out in the future."
"Pours an amber gold with a frothy, thick head. Smells strong of grapes much like a wine. Tastes very much as it smells: much like a watered down wine with a slightly hoppy aftertaste. Quite tasty and better than I expected actually. Mouthfeel is smooth as this ale goes down very easily. Overall I could drink this on a regular basis."
"Bottom line: Here's another session English Ale that delivers nicely in the taste department. I'll certainly buy this again."
"The taste is alright, but really not my favourite of this style. The herbal bitterness at the finish is like finishing a night of wild sex with a kick to the groin. It doesn't quite ruin things, and doesn't make the whole affair totally bad, but it sure leaves a bad taste in your mouth. Appearance and mouthfeel are top notch and the aroma is pretty good too, making this a pretty decent beer."
"I overheard someone at the store decide not to buy this beer because they thought it was joke, and personally I was expecting about the same. After tasting it though.. It's really quite good. Classic English pale ale. This beer could hold it's own against any fullers or youngs any day of the week. Might be amazing on cask."
"Body is just a whisper above light, although the body feels a little beefier with a creamy texture and slick, dextrinous mouthfeel. I do not think I shall have this again. Not even with Spam, dead parrots, lumberjacks, and Mr. Creosote."
"This pours a cloudy reddish orange honey color with a large tan foamy head. The smell has a large cinnamon and apple aroma,it smells good,but it's a little weird for a beer. The taste has a sweet maltly flavor,but it also has some sour apple tartness. The mixture of these two flavors doesn't go well together. The aftertaste is watery and a little metalic. The m/f is light. This is a beer that I would pass on in the future."
"Okay drinakbility, just doesn't come together a s sum of it parts. Will try again if I can some warm fuzzies about freshness or maybe it was the burnt witches?"
"drinkable anytime."
"Drinkability: What's that proverb about some coloured sky at night, shepherd's delight? Well you and all other drinkers of this beer can talk about such things as the weather, your flock of sheep, the young ladies in the village and the details of the local cattle market, over a pint of this fine local ale in your smoky pub. Enjoy your pipe and overgrown sideburns/chops. Remember, this is a LOCAL ale for LOCAL people, there's nothing for you here!"
"All in all it isn't bad, but it is easy enough to find a better example of the style."
"I'll admit it - I bought this for the name. I'm not enamored by the British Isles yet - I'm an American/Belgian/German kind of guy - but dang if this doesn't have a good character to it."
"I must admit that I bought this because of the novelty factor (I was entertaining friends), but was pleasently surprised at how good this pale ale is. Very enjoyable."
"It was the ""Monty Python"" name that made me try the beer and I'm sure that's what the company was going for. It wasn't quite what I expected, but it was certainly a pleasant surprise, especially since I got the bottles on a ""buy one, get one free"" special. I think this beer may be more conducive to being consumed with a meal rather than by itself, but I think this is a very good beer."
"I thought this was a novelty beer, which I rarely think of trying. I love Monty Python so I decided to give it a try. I was very delighted with the taste. It went well with meatloaf and baked potato meal I made last night. I would definitely recomend this ale."
"This is the second time I've tried this beer and it's better now than it was the first go-around. I think there may have been something off about that first bottle because now I find this beer to be quite enjoyable as a basic EPA, and imminently drinkable. Worth a try if you want something simple yet satisfying."
"I have been resistant to tying this due to the novelty factor… Pours an orange/copper color with a nice full and rocky head – good retention. Light co2 and some chill haze. Aroma is lightly metallic/acrid with some aroma hop. Palate is full and effervescent. Flavor has a quick but light hop bite, with a metallic finish– quite the residual twang of tartness. A decent flavor, but not necessarily representational of the style. What the hell do I know?"
"Overall: Given to me as a half-joke gift, and it ended up being a nice surprise. Worth trying."
"I drank this beer while soaking my aching feet. Feet soaking and Holy Grail Ale went together like swimmingly. Very relaxing."
"Hope bitterness slowly fades to something like sweet fruits and malts. Mild carbonation, smooth on the palate and quite drinkable. Nothing too complex, but a vrey pleasant ale, better than average."
". Smooth, drinkable and refreshing. Borders on Brown Ale character. Maybe not great, but definitely respectable and better than average. Went very well with enchiladas and should do well with barbecued beef or pork."
"Overall a decent brew... don't know if I'd crack another one."
"Taste is tangy and twangy (this is what I feel defines this brew), like a sour Granny Smith apple. There's an o-so-anglo earthy bitterness and a bit of softened wheat bread sweetness too. I like it."
"Hey, this was tasty and well put together. If it weighs the same as a duck it must be a duck."
"cheers..."
"This beer presented itself as an American macro brew, CMB. I had to reread the label to make sure it wasn't from one of the jumbo 3! This beer poured a yellow color with very little head. What head did form faded quickly into almost nothing. The taste was slightly bitter and was very average for a typical pale brew. The mouth feel was watery and the earthy aftertaste makes this beer not very drinkable. The name and the label are witty, but unfortunately the beer inside is rather uninspired."
"I will not be ordering this again and I would be very hesitant to try any of their other products. I comes across as more of a gimick beer then anything else - before finding it here, I thought it was a bud product."
"Newly available in Alberta, though I think BC has had access to Black Sheep brews for a while now. This beer is definitely a treat for the Monty Python disciples. Typical Holy Grail labelling. Holy Grail poured with a superb and massive, chunky, bone-white head that slowly and noiselessly churned. It became meringue-like, with pockets and indentations forming, providing an amusing show of carbonation. Very sticky lacing. The beer's colour is rusty water, hints of light maple and even light orange. Nice colour and great head for an English pale. The aroma is that wonderful balance of caramel malt and English hops I love so much. There is nothing out of the ordinary here, but it is all very well done: the elements mix nicely to give a great deal of satisfying aromas, all in their right places. Earthy, woodlike hops first greet the nose, a little ticklish to the nostrils and warming. There are some dark fruits here as well: blackberries, faint pear and apple, and plum. Good malty sweetness, balanced exceedingly well with the hops, coming through as brown sugar, raisins, brownies, and butterscotch. Rice-pudding. All throughout there seems to be a very dry, balsam-wood note. The aroma really is superb: fresh, creamy and inducing. The taste was a little disappointing at first, only in that the aroma seems to promise more. This is still a very good tasting English pale, but just not as flavourful as some others. The taste on the front of the tongue brings wood flavours, and some sourish malt, almost a little cardboardish. In the middle the malts add some vanilla-like sweetness, a little cream, light fruitiness, and some wateriness. The taste as a whole is just not too full. The hops definitely arrive in the finish and leave their bitterness; cinnamon and cloves. Oak flavours really seem evident to my taste in this beer. Oddly enough the alcohol seems quite noticeable in this pale, even though it is only 4.7%. The beer is medium to full bodied, spritzy in carbonation, but extremely drinkable, as any good English pale ale should be. I could drink this all night. This is not really the Holy Grail of English pales, but a discovery worth making all the same. I suppose the Monty Python excerpts are only natural for this beer, so...""Not some farcical aquatic ceremony by some moistened bink!"""
"Expecting a gimmick, I was pleasantly surprised with this very good beer. Auburn/copper in colour, with a decent one finger head that lasted. Whisps of lace stick to the glass. Bit of toffee, fruit, malts, earth, grass and caramel in the nose. A rather odd blend that smells pretty damn good. Taste, hmm... Delicious. Lightly sweetened with malts, toffee and fruit, mingling with this down to earth bitterness. Mouthfeel is a bit dry and buttery. However, this is quite the exceptional pale ale and one I shall be buying again."
"The taste was very sweet with well a green apple flavor. It had a slight nip of bitterness in there but not much. It finishes off very dry and sour."
"Pours a clear orange/brown, big off white head, sticky lace all over the glass. Smell is citrus, bread, some grains, sharp iron aroma, and pineapple. Taste is malty and citrusy at first, some floral, iron and light bitterness. MOuthfeel is light bodied, low carbonation, watery and unpleasant. I haven't really found an English ale I like much, evidently because of the water."
"Gold orange in color. Large creamy white lasting head. Foamy. Faint on the nez. Maybe a bit bitter. Taste is better than the smell. Nicely hopped and bitter. Much better than I expected after putting the glass to my nose. Mouthfeel is thin and watery. Like a Dasani. Very drinkable and smooth. I bought this because of the cool label and name. In someways it was better than I expected. It is a good beer. The smell and mouthfeel are letdowns though."
"Poured into a glass with a nice orange color and a thick head. It tastes slightly better than it smells. It smells hoppy and tastes bitter as a result. A little thin for the mouth feel. I would probubly drink another one. I will try it again sometime."
"Taste was a bit sour, couldn't find a date on this bottle, so not sure if I just got an old one or not, but i'm not really feelng this one, it's kinda sweet at first than sour and it lingers."
"Very clear, medium copper beer with a big, fluffy, off-white head that reduced quickly but left a nice lacing behind. Apple and caramel in the aroma, with a grassy hop character and just a bit of earthiness. Fresh, fruity flavour with lots of malt and a balancing bitterness. Finishes off-dry with continued fruit and a hint of diacetyl. Smooth, silky texture with moderate carbonation. This is another great English ale with decent complexity that remains highly drinkable."
"Overall, I was not impressed with Black Sheep's version of an English Pale Ale. It does not hold up to the style well, but if you're a Monty Python fan it's definitely a must."
"If it were about $1 a bottle, it'd be a decent cheap alternative if you really wanted a British Pale, but at $3 a bottle it's just not worth it."
"The name and the label are definitely gimmicky, which made me wary of the beer's quality, but as a Monty Python fan I just had to buy it. Pours a slightly hazy dull copper with a huge almost overflowing cream colored head and some nice retention. Nose is a light fruity apple with some floral notes and a slight biscuity malt. Taste has a lot more of the slightly tart green apple taste with a slightly buttery bready malt base and a decent amount of bitterness lingering after the tart finish. The mouthfeel is nice and smooth, maybe a tad bit overcarbonated. To be honest, this beer is better than I expected, a very nice flavorful English ale, but at $3.50 a bottle I don't if it's worth it."
"Good carbonation tingle. Easy to drink but unremarkable. One and done."
"It's what you'd expect from an English Pale Ale. Pours a golden-to-copper color, with some haze. Nice carbonation and retention. Soft barley grain aromas, lightly bready, yeasty, and modestly spicy. Flavors are similar with emphasis on grain flavor from barley. Lower body than normal brings out more hop flavor, leading to grassy or herbal flavors. Body starts off medium, but becomes watery durring the finish. Easily drinkable. A nice beer, but not one I'll be craving soon."
"Drinkability: I wanted to try this beer more for the Monty Python reference than anything else. Its a sales gimmick, and without the bottle youre left with a very lackluster, average beer. But the bottle will definitely make it onto my beer wall in the basement."
"overall: sorry if i sound like i'm beating a dead horse, but this beer smells and tastes like apples. like it, and you'll like the beer. don't like it and you'll hate the beer. if you're like me and you're in the middle, it can become annoying. decent english pale ale."
"Pours a cloudy golden yellow with a snow-white frothy head - resembles a hefe-weisen or cream ale more than a pale. Smell is grassy and lemony with a hint of apple juice. Taste is similarly grassy, lemon grass actually, with a strong citrus backbone and a crisp hop bite. Reminded me of Tommyknocker's Jack Whacker wheat with lemon grass. Drinkable for sure, but it's a nothing mindblowing and a little pricey. Still refreshing on a hot summer day."
"D- For the alcohol content I don't really notice that much complexity of malt and hop flavors. The toasted malt is not a true flavor in this beer and it should come out a bit more. Interesting to try but I'm afraid its more of a gimmick."
"Lighter bodied. Worth a try for the bottle, but otherwise a typical if not sub par British ale."
"Light clear orange-amber color. Nice foamy yellowish white head. Head sticks all over the glass. First thing I notice from the aroma is the sweet apple smell. Faint diacetyl and some sweet malts. The taste is dominated by apple like fruitness and maltiness. Medium bodied with a smooth slightly carbonated mouthfeel. Drinkability is great. At $3.50 a bottle it is money well spent."
"The Ail poured a nice full amber but very clear with an off white head. The aroma was of malt with a lot of floral hops. It had a light malt taste with a big hop finish. The feel was medium, smooth, and somewhat oily. It was a very pleasant beer except when it wasn't."
"While I won't go out of my way to seek it out (other than for the occasional novelty of a Monty Python beer), I won't turn my nose up at it either. Monty Python's Holy Grail Ale is worth a try."
"Sampled 06/11/2005. Pours a bright reddih to copper color with a dense white head, looks good. Bottle did gush upon opening, not good. Nose is neutral maybe leaning towards slight maltiness. Flavor introduces itself malty, very subtly but then a ""tinny"" metallic undertone arrives. Mouthfell is very dry, slightly chalky, finish is long and leaves you thirsty!!!"
"Monty pours a nice golden amber with a gorgeous frothy foam head. The head is thick like a shake. The smell is slight skunky at first, then the citrus aromas will peak through, lemon peppers and biscuits swirl around the nose. The hop presence is delicate and makes it every bit english. The taste is of thick buttered biscuits and grain yeast with caramel malts. Hint of bitterness will linger.Thick and delicious. A nice beer even with the gimmicky name."
"Drinkability/notes: Very good, especially considering that it is marketed as a novelty beer, certainly good enough to stand on its own merits."
"After months away from any real beer I finally hit 'The Tavern' in Cambridge and tried a few brews. This was the first and it was served out of the bottle into a goblet. A reasonable amber hue with a fluffy bleached white head that laced the glass all the way down. Smelled sweet on the nose, something like wheatgrass and citrus. Mine was very hoppy and my first reaction was 'Why is this an IPA?' until the sweetness hit me. After the initial roll, you can certainly get the fruity hoppiness and the sweet malts. There was a somewhat unreasonable aftertaste though that felt like film on my tongue."
"Pours medium rusty amber color, looks rather old to start. Very large bubbles in the head, a couple of fingers at least. Aromas include some bitter fruits, hops, and alcohol. Taste follows with some bitter fruitiness, moderate hoppiness, and a little weak in foundation. All in all, it's drinkable, probably a decent session beer. Nothing special."
"Drinkability: This is the style of beer I find myself drinking most often these days. It is a favorite style of mine. This beer in particular is easy to drink and interesting to the palate. This beer is more than a curiosity for those only interested in the label or those that would pass it up like a cartoon beer."
"Comments - Looks good, feels good, everything else is pretty suspect. I'm concerned that it might not be very fresh. Sadly, this beer makes me think ""gimmick."" The beer has some good qualities, but ultimately does not cut it."
"Drinkability: Perhaps it is the ""burning witches"" but this one just doesn't come together well for me; the flavors are schizophrenic and while I prefer an ale that is full of flavor, I just can't see returning to this one anytime soon"
"16.9 ouncer, without freshness dating. Pours typical darkish honey amber, off white head, and moderate lacing. Minor nose of some fruity hops and malt. This is a middle of the road Brit ale, decent balance, malt/hops, nothing special IMHO, but still a pleasant, drinkable sessioner. Worth a try."
"Overall drinkability was very good I think. I thought it was pretty smooth and the bitter-sweet aftertaste kept me reaching for the pint glass."
"It is drinkable, but the sour flavor got to me by the end of the bottle."
"The movie was excellent. Left this in the freezer too long and it got slushy, messed up the pour. Looks good its dark orange with a good head. Weak smell, tastes good, malt and hop flavors are evident, some more complex flavors are tangible. I like 500ml bottles. I recommend this brew for those who enjoy both English Ales and Monty Python movies."
"Just alright."
"This was ok, but really not something i would look forward to tasting again."
"Last swigs: Not familiar with Black Sheep, but a bit too bitter for my tastes. Ale? Hmmm..."
"Comes in a bottle with several concepts from the movie. On the pour, this brew is a clear, darker-golden color, with lots of steadily rising little bubbles. Big frothy cream head, leaves good amounts of lace. Lightly malty with bitter hops on the nose. There is some degree of malt, which is dominated by a blast of bitter hops. Thin mouth. My first batch of homebrew was somewhat similar to this, good hop levels, much too weak on the malt. Sure the english style shouldnt be overbearing, but this isnt mixed well enough to give a nice score."
"OK, I admit I tried this the first time because of the Monty Python name on the label. But I am glad to see the beer is as good as the program/movies are funny. This was the 3rd time I've had this beer and was surprised to find I hadn't reveiwed it yet. I must have been overcome by grief over the loss of my parrot (a Norwegian Blue). Pours an absolutely gorgeous orange/amber color with a huge wheat-like head. Big, fluffy, off-white head. (HUGE tracts of head - sorry). Very good retention and great lacing from rim to bottom. Smell is like few other pale ales I've ever had. In fact, my mouth started watering the instant I smelled it, the anticipation was so great. Malt, enough fruit to make a shrubber's heart happy (citrus, apple, grape), spice, oak and vanilla and a nice sweetness over it all.Taste is malt, hops, oak and vanilla. Fruit and spice are present as well but less pronounced than in the nose. Personally, I blame the Knights Who Say ""Ni"" for that. Mouthfeel is good. Medium-bodied with just the right amount of hop bittering. Could be a bit smoother but quite enjoyable. A fairly dry finish with a pleasant hop/malt aftertaste. Don't let the Black Knight stop you from trying this brew. Good flavor and balance make this a good beer anytime."
"Great label. reason why i bought it. But at 4.99 for 16.9 oz???Pours out a nice golden yellow. Smelled a little floral, but nothing stuck out. taste was hoppy and bitter, but by no means that bitter... very drinkable if you're looking for multiple pints. Oh, and the head was foamy white that stuck on the glass like there's no tomorrow. Very smooth beer, mouthfeel was smooth and not overbearing, just a good average mouthfeel. I would say this beer is a good ale overall and very enjoyable, but for the price i paid, just a novelty purchase... great bottle."
"Whoa, started off good, nice clear amber / orange with a 1 Tan head. Could smell the citrus / orange hops, really ready for a quaff. And the first 3 or 4 drinks were pretty good, left a dry, hoppy, and slightly earthy taste. But as the pint progressed the flavors really diminished and by the end the flavors were plain and worn out - kinda like old hoppy tea. Disappointed in this ale, its not bad but I wont go out of my way for another. Seems to be a novelty type ale."
"Pours a foggy amber color into my Duvel tulip glass with a small white head that dissipates quickly. Smells: sourdough bread, grapes, bananna, with a hint of phenolic esters. No hops noticable at all. Taste is much of the same with more complexity appearing as the ale warms. An overtone of white grapes and green apple. A bit of an oily, buttery aftertaste. Mouthfeel is decently peppery, with a bit of oily smoothness. It is quite drinkable, especially as a session ale."
"Taste is similar, but with a good amount of malts. A typical English ale; very enjoyable. Carbonation is good. A nice refreshing ale."
"Nicely done session ale with nearly flawless balance that leans slightly on the bitter side."
"Overall, a good beer, though I liked it more for the Monty Python aspect. The bottle and label added some additional character that made the drinking experience more pleasant."
" - Roger the Shrubber"
"The taste has a strong hoppy front expected of the style, but certainly nothing that will knock your socks off. The mid taste is malty sweet with plenty of plum fruit tones. A heavy hop brings up the rear. The phases are very distinct, and each hits you completely separately."
"Even if you don't like ales, this is worth trying."
"Overall this ale was excellent. I was quite surprised."
"Drinkability  The label is kind of cheesy, but its whats inside that counts. This is a terrific session ale."
"While not exactly a joke beer without any redeeming qualities, Black Sheep Brewery could have made a better effort to put quality inside this classically (for fans) named and labeled bottle. The other Black Sheep offerings that I've had have been solid, but Holy Grail Ale is anything but. Buy it for the bottle, not the beer."
"Pours out a nice copper-orange with a hazy body and a smallish but high quality off-white head. Head settles slowly over the next several minutes to a thin collar. Leaves some average lacing on the sides of the glass. Smell has some distinct notes of banana as well as yeast. Taste is malty but with a high degree of hop bitterness providing balance. The flavors seem to layer, with the hops taking the forefront and the maltiness coming in underneath and slightly understated. The flavor is further complicated by carbonation that makes a bold statement of its presence. However, the carbonation is not such that it takes hold of the beer and makes it seem thin and fizzy. Very nice. The mouthfeel is just a hair thinner than I would have prefered due to the carbonation, but not to the point that I would call it truly overcarbonated. I think it helps create a balance that makes this a unique offering. Overall, a fairly drinkable beer. Not something that is going to become a staple of my refridgerator, but a solid offering that is true to the style, but unique and different all at the same time. Definitely worth a try."
"Feel is quick, smooth, and somewhat bready with sweetness, lighter bodied with a decent carbonation making up for it. Again, the finish is subtle and approachable with some drying fruit skin action. Gets better with some warmth. Easy goin', simple, clean, and fairly drinkable. Sessionable but a tad on the nonexcitement side."
"I love how the Black Sheep brewery, instead of having a range of different styles, focuses mainly on my favorite style, the English bitter/pale ale, and has several very good variations on that theme."
"This is definitely an English pale ale, and a mild one at that . While certainly a pleasant beer to quaff, it's not terribly distinctive. The most distinctive thing about it is the Monty Python packaging. Now that I've had it, I see no reason to have another one when there are other, more distinctive beers at a cheaper price."
"16.9oz bottle with Monty Python inspired label. Poured a medium amber with good amount of head and carbonation. Head had good retention and good lacing. The smell was above average. The taste however was disappointing. I'll admit that this is not my normal sytle of beer but even so it was lackluster. After looking at the other reviews, maybe I had a bad bottle but since I got it from Whole Foods which is normally top notch I doubt it. Worth a try once but not twice. PR 2.0 LMH."
"Slightly hazy light amber color, pours with a big head -- well over an inch but easily controllable in the glass. Laces are intricate at the top, thin down below. Pretty hoppy aroma for a UK entry, prickly, slightly orangish with burnt rind tones. Hops assert well in the taste as well, though there is plenty of rolling toffee maltiness, some cashew nutiness, enhanced by an easy going smooth mouthfeel. But you remain aware of a counteracting bitterness early and its turned up by the time the aftertaste rolls around. By no means a hop grenade like many North American Pale Ales, just a touch more than I expected. Easy-going and easy-to-drink beer with a little more bite."
"Overall, an average pale ale."
"Easily a session beer, a good English ale. Love the whole ""Tempered over burning witches"" thing."
"Look my liege...its Camelot, therein lies the holy ale!..aww its only a model....sorry, couldnt resist the Pythonesque refferences... its hard to with this being the packaging gimmik on this beer. I must say I was pleasantly surprised that there was actually a fair English bitter under the novelty wrapper. Poured a deep amber with a nice sticky, rocky off white cap that had good retention...medium-heavy carbonation. Very light grassy aromas under a barely detectable sweet malt mustiness. Front side is overly fizzy and kind of weakly malted with the hop oils dominating the tongue.... fairly quick bitter finish with a metallic after taste. Not a bad bitter but a tad too unbalanced for me and slighly too fizzy. On second thought, lets not go to Camalot...it IS a rather silly place."
"Intriguing package; Monty Python script and artwork. Label indicates it has been ""Tempered over burning witches"". Nose--herbal hoppy aroma, fresh apples in a wood box. Pours a hazy orange with average head, some lacing. Initial taste hop, hop, light on the malt. (Does not fit with the classic blending of malts that the English are known for). Finish is very long with lots of hop bitterness. Body seemed a bit thin and watery. Chalky finish with what can only be described as teeth coating alpha acids. Overall an ? beer; hop and malt are definitely out of balance."
"A pleasant English Pale that has some nice character. I'd gladly have another pint. Nothing to really search for but if it's available it's worth a try."
"This would probably have a higher ranking if it had a different name than it does. A very good english ale with spice. Chewy maltiness and good bitterness after. I'd love to have a draft pint of this."
"(500 ml bottle, bought in Denmark). Im a big fan of Monthy Python movies, which, however, is irrelevant when sampling this beer. Inside the gimmicky bottle is a decent English bitter, and decent English bitters are always welcome in my home (no cask ales available around here, Im afraid). Colour is deep golden, pours with a good head which leaves a nice lacing. Decent hoppy aroma (oranges and some toffee), flavour has sufficient malts and a pleasant hoppiness that lasts through the long aftertaste. Maybe not a true masterpiece, but a nice beer indeed!"
"Overall this was a damn fine beer. I was afraid, from the ""cute"" label it would be quite frankly another crappy beer hidden in a cute container. I was fooled, I'm quite glad I found this beer. Don't be afraid to buy this one, it's well worth the money."
"The body is a little thin but it still satisfies, and it goes down smooth."
"Overall, pretty drinkable though not much to write home about."
"Overall, interesting to try (just for the Monty Python connection if nothing else) but there are lots better things to spend your money on."
"Taste: ever-so lame...sorry, nothing to recommend here...in fact, it feels like a joke. Not much of an ale, certainly not the type that the knights of the round table would make a fuss over...the citric/sour qualities take over, and it's not a pleasant drink at all....if they make the effort to ink a deal with the Python boys, why not brew something worth drinking? this, however, is not,... worth one try, and then, regrets away, we move on..."
"Drinking an English ale on inpedendance day how ironic,anways pours a golden color with a little orange tint with a pretty nice frothy head that settles pretty well into a soapy-like consistancy.Aroma is a little herbal with some toffee notes,taste is pretty mild and restrained but good with some light brown sugar and mint intertwining nicely.A respectable ale very easy to drink and pretty good even in the heat,I passed this beer up alot thinking it was just a gimmick but I actually liked it."
"Overall a very smooth easy to drink beer, that isnt high in alcohol so it would make a nice beer to have a few of on a summer day."
"I would have it again, without any problems. Good for sitting around and eating nachos."
"Half a liter bottle poured into a pint glass. It pours a slightly hazy medium copper color with two fingers of head. There is a bit of lacing left on the sides of the glass. The smell is fairly malty and sweet, but has some hops present. The taste also has that sweet malt flavor mixed with some hops, but it leaves something to be desired. Just a little bland and just plain average. The mouthfeel is fairly light and watery as well. The drinkability is pretty good, cause of the low alcohol content. Just your average pale ale."
"I could definately drink more even thought the most spectacular part of this beer is the Monty Python tie-in. I'll drink again."
"Not bad overall, but far from outstanding."
"Nice drinkability if it weren't so expensive. I can't help but enjoy an English ale that evokes the Monty Python Show theme song running through my brain."
"Won't be making the drive out again for any of this stuff, that's for sure. But all is not lost, the Pixies were amazing, and I now have a fine bottle for my own home brew. Always look on the bright side of life! (oops, wrong Monty Python film)."
"Not bad, not bad at all, but not as good as the label."
"Drinkability: You probably COULD drink a lot of these, if you were so inclined. But I'd be chasing after a better beer."
"Alright, this isn't bad for a gimmick beer. It's gotta be better than the ""Governator"" beer. It pours a tarnished amber in color, with a thick head and ridiculously stubborn lace. The beer itself is pleasantly bitter. There's hints of citrus flavoring interlaced around the hops. The alcohol is kind of strong and I can detect hints of it on my tongue. This would be a dangerous beer for me if I am looking to get drunk."
"actual beer."
"There's a big, cream-colored head. Almost white. It's dense and slow, collapsing to uneven, lumpy foam. Thick, clumpy lacing. The beer is clear, dark orange. Tea-colored. The nose gives up sweet, butter toffee. Fruity toffee in the sweet front is just a little coppery when cool. It turns tangy: good, buttery, sour, malty. The finish is bitter with ample tangy toffee. I like this. It's a nice, tangy, bitter Brit."
"Light in body, finishes dry and clean. Quite a refreshing blend. Surprising, as I expected less out of this marketing gimmick but this is quite good."
"Notes: The bottle reads ""Tempered over burning witches"". Must be some bland and boring witches and this is one very boring beer. The label is rather flamboyant therefore reiterating the old cliche ""Don't judge a book by it's cover"". Holds very true here! Cheers!"
"Appearance: Amber hue nice sized cream colored head leaves nicely spread fine formed lacing. Aroma: Sweet grains with a touch of fruity malt characteristics some hop nose is also present painfully English balance going on. Taste: Rolling malt sweetness with a weird twang of tartness seems a bit off almost acidic there's a nutty edge here as well not too uniform flavor finishes with a blunt bittereness. Mouthfeel: Thin bodied watery texture light carbonation. Drinkability: Next time I will pass on this novelty beer, it was a decent English ale but somewhat mediocre for me I was hoping for something great from an ale based off of one of my favorite movies."
"It is a light amber color with a huge head. There is cedar and citrus aromas. The body is firm with some orange notes as well as some anise and cedar. It finishes with a dry balanced bitterness. It is somewhat different than I am accustomed from English Ales, but it is a good thing. I can almost taste the screams of the burning witches."
"Not a joke beer, tasty yet different. Not really a pale ale, more of a brown ale. A brew that even Sir Robin would not run away from! ;)"
"-Oelergud"
"This one looked like a perfect pint of Sierra Nevada Pale Ale or St. Peter's Brewery Pale Ale and that didn't give up on taking after them in other attributes as well. Imitable yes, but unoriginality meets more liberal scrutiny than incompetence earns. Well done!! (-And there was much rejoicing-)"
"Overall, the taste is straightforward: First comes a pleasant bitterness, then a dry mouth feel and at last some flavours of dried fruit and whale nuts. The aftertaste could be described as dry, balanced bitterness."
"Taste is coppery as well, at least up front. Lightly fruity in the middle and lightly bitter in the finish. Unfortunately, the lightly fruity and the lightly bitter don't make up for the assertive metallic taste up front. It ends up dominating the palate. Not terribly so but enough to annoy you. It is creamy and smooth though. Virtually no aftertaste. An unoffensive (mostly) below average English ale. I split this purchase with a buddy because he wanted the bottle and I'm glad I did. The selling point is the label though, not the contents."
"what i figured was just a gimmick brew ended up being not half bad. pours an awesome looking amber/copper colour, with a huge frothy head that lasts and also leaves a nice stickiness. the smell here is pretty good: slight sweetness, hops, a bit of malt and a little touch of fruit. the taste is similar to the smell but with a bit of a cream flavour running through it. there's a nice hop flavour as well but overall the taste is pretty bland. mouthfeel is just right for an ale and this one is very drinkable, but nothing terribly exciting overall. i'd have another, most definitely, but it's not high on the list for a repeat purchase."
"Overall: Pretty average really  reminds me of that day I first tried Black Sheep beers."
"I could drink a few at a time. Better than most of the commercial English ales that make it to may area."
"This is a gag beer. It, like its label, might not really offend too many people, but besides the unevitable alcohol content, there's not much that will make me want to ask for another. This must be something they brewed solely so that they'd have something to stick their humorous label on."
"Slightly dissapointing but decent."
"A slightly foggy deep amber color as it sets in the glass with a mountainous frothy light tan head and the resultant lace a nice and sealing sheet to obscure the glass. Malt sweetness rules the day in this nose, clean, crisp, fresh and quite pleasing to the senses, start is quite sweet with a nice malt profile that leads to a fair to middling top. Finish is quite modest in its acidity with the traditional English hopping that makes for a fine quaff, sweet and dry aftertaste that has just a slight hint of sourness, quite decent English Ale in my books."
"Even as you know you want to try it for the name alone, something in the back of your mind says this could be another 3 Stooges Panther Pilsner. But no, instead, it's a pretty nice bitter. Maybe a little carbonated to please American tastes, but that's the only concession it seems to make. Bitter is not a style I've had a lot of experience in, but I'll suspect this is somewhat middling against the well done ones. Good light brown color and maltiness, slight fruitiness. Just fun to bring out. And I found at the Whole Food Market in Chicago, so it may not have traveled as well as it might."
"I admit that I'm a big Monty Python fan (where did you think the geek part came from?), but I saw myself getting this one only for the bottle. I'm surprised that it's not bad at all...not a world-beater, but solid. I'd probably have another one."
"I enjoyed this for the variety of things happening in the glass, but couldn't see drinking a ton of it."
"500ml bottle - Amber colour brew with a nice generous head that stayed on for a while. This is a standard english ale with the usual bitter aftertaste and good hops taste. It is a good brew but nothing out of the usual or to distinguish himself from the pack."
"As cute as the marketing ploy may be, this is actually a nice brew."
"An enormous ivory head crowns this beautiful hazy amber brew and produces incredible lace effect. The nose is light and somewhat grainy. The taste is full of nice sweet malt and a nice hop balance, but finishes on sour notes. The feel is smooth and creamy and the drinkability very good."
"Deep golden color with good head retention, thick lace adorned the glass. Yeasty aroma, some hops, typical butterscotch taste profile that many bottled English beers seem to have. Very smooth as is also typical of the style. Full bodied and decently drinkable. Not on the same plane as Young's or Fullers but not bad either. Worth trying if you come across it."
"Finish is a bit harsh, kind of astringent. There's an odd concentration of herb-flavored hoppiness that catches me in the back of the throat with this. The aftertaste lingers a bit and isn't great, but it's not a deal-breaker. Not bad at all. And hey, it's got friggin Monty Python on the bottle. I picked up the ol' guitar and smacked out a rousing rendition of ""Always Look on the Bright Side of Life."" ;-)"
"The aroma is a very familiar rustic malt blend. The taste combines that rustic malt blend with the warm, dank sourness of a barn. The pleasant fruitiness of the yeast compliments its earthy flavors, and makes for a swell pint that easily holds up to expectations. A clean drink that really is pleasant and should be enjoyed in more than one."
"Cloudy and hazy light copper color, has a decent white foamy head, light caramel and bready aroma. Light body and watery mouthfeel, flavors of stale bread and butterscotch, finish a little bit sweet, a very average english pale ale, Jesus christ...run away!!!"
"This was very easy to drink and I could have more of these if it wasn't for the $7.50 a bottle."
"Medium orange gold color. Large head. Malty and fairly hoppy. Medium bodied bitter. A little spicy and citrusy. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is sharp. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. I will admit that I bought it this beer for the label Not bad, but nothing special."
"I had to buy this beer (Ne!). The beer is a clear, golden color, with a hint of red to it. There waas a fair amount of head, but it dissapated quickly. The aroma is a bit malty. Not too much in the way of hops in the nose. The taste is fairly malty, with a little bitterness. I didn't pick up any of the roasted witches in the taste. A pretty typical English Bitter beer. Not too bad! A fine beer to drink while making a shrubbery!"
"The beer pours a dark golden color with a lacey white head. The smell is of pale malts and light aroma hops. There seems to be a bit a fruitiness about it; possibly some light crystal or munich malts to add character. The taste is decent, but nothing special. Again, it's a pale beer with a bit of malty character. There is a good balance between malts and hops. The mouthfeel is good. There is a medium body. This is a good drinking beer, but nothing I would probably buy again."
"This Holy Grail  pours a deep gold, almost orange color. This ale gave off a tight thick white head that left a very thin lace in the end. The aroma was more grassy than hoppy. Hints of wet hay hit the nose, nothing over impressive. There is a bit of malt sweetness present. The taste starts of with a malt start but the grassy hops flavor hits in. The flavor has a TWANG at the end, maybe sour apples? Over all a very nice bit above average enjoyable ale. Now I must find a shrubbery and cut it down with a herring."
"The name of this beer made it so that I couldn't pass it up. It pours a light amber color with a nice, full head and a lot of lacing on the glass. The aroma is very malty and slightly sweet. The flavor was hinting at a malt liquor but had a very odd sweetness to it that gave it a pretty enjoyable taste. The aftertaste is pretty dry but it was surprisingly smooth to drink."
"This brew poured a very large invigorated head of large light brown bubbles and a cloudy amber body with carbonation rising up the side of my mug. It has nice malty aroma and an initially smooth taste that builds somewhat bitter finish. It's receding head left good lacing. It is a nice all around brew."
"The taste: Very gassy. Bright sharp prickles of gas disallow any richness from registering at first. Its there though. A cottony, weathered, dried malt flavor that delivers, in addition to the elements available to the nose, graphite and toast."
"""Tempered over burning witches."" With a tag-line like that, how can you not buy a bottle? Fortunately, this is not a gimmick beer - very much the traditional ""ordinary bitter."" A little tannic in the hops bite, but not so much as to pose a problem. Slight acidity in the background, smoothed over by some nice malt flavors. Won't be a regular in the fridge, but certainly worth a try."
"Pours a medium amber color with lots of visible carbonation (tiny bubbles stuck all over the sides of the glass in the beer) and a thick and frothy whipped cream head that slowly dissipates in chunks leaving a heavy and patchy foam behind. Nose has a bit of an herbal and grassy twang with notes of musty grains and wet wood. Medium in body with a slick mouth feel. Taste starts off with flavors of iced tea and diacetyl followed by some oily hop resins and notes of green apple peel with a bit of tobacco in the finish. Being a fan of Monty Python, I was really looking forward to trying this beer, and while not great, it was still quite enjoyable. Thanks to Loki for the sample!"
"Like everyone else it was the label that caught my eye first. This pours a deep hazy golden with a huge head that lasts, and leaves fine lace to the bottom of the glass. The aroma was a mild maltiness. Nothing jumps out at you in the taste, and seemed to be a little thin, with no real finish. But still I enjoyed this ale. Would love to try this as a draught, to see how it compared."
"This beer poured a large head. It had good lacing that clung to the side of my mug. The aroma to me was a combination of fruity and nutty. The beer went down smooth with a bit of a sweet aftertaste that was noticed. It had a lot of carbonation. All in all this beer was drinkable."
"All-in-all, a great pint of beer and much better than I believed due to the packaging. Tried twice, must better when chilled than slightly warm."
"1 pint, 9 oz bottle. Pours a deep amber with a delightful frothy white head that remains throughout comsuption. Aroma consists of malt and toasted bread with a pretzel dough-like quality to it. Thinnish mouthfeel is not a detraction. The taste is actually pretty decent. Hops and malt balance are kept in check. Light hop bitterness is washed away with a pleasant doughy pretzel flavored finish. Bitterness imparts some residual saltiness. Not bad, certainly worth a try at the very least."
"Nice, puffy white head. Chestnut to almond color...relatively clear. Doughy and sweet with a great hop aroma. Extremely drinkable and satisfying."
"Overall an average English style pale ale/bitter. The label seems more entertaining than the ale itself. Enough said."
"Paired with a grilled barbecue chicken breast and greenbeans. Left off the cornbread, that would have made the redneck trilogy complete. It was very good paired with dinner, but not a beer that stands alone. For $3.99 a bottle here, a bit pricey. I am looking forward to the other 2 beers from this brewery I bought, the Black Sheep Ale and the Riggwelter."
"This ale poured a hazy, golden amber color with creamy, white foam that left very good lace down the glass. The smell was malty with a trace of citrus, but no hop nose. The taste was malty with some bitter hops in the background (sort of like a thin Bass ale). There was a very, very faint caramel flavor. The mouthfeel was medium-thin bodied: clean, crisp, with a light, astringent hop finish. The drinkability was OK, but this ale was thin on flavor and body."
"Pours with a good head that leaves a lace, color is a hazy orange probably caused by the burning witches. Nose is very slight with malt. A nice pale ale that is very smooth and a slightly hoppy finish. Even though the ABV is on the low side, there is good flavor and is not as hoppy as some English pales."
"Cheers"
"All Monty Python references aside, not much to this beer other than the label."
"Drinkability: Decent. The faint burnt flavor at the end doesn't sit well with me. Take that away and you have a very average brew with a cool label. I won't go out of my way to buy this one again."
"(Yes I'm a dork)"
"I think you are taking your chances with any ""novelty"" beer like this. I am still having nightmares about the ""Romulan Ale"". This one wasn't nearly that bad but I still won't get it again. Cloudy honey color with a medium foamy white head. Sweet malt and caramel aroma. No sweetness in the flavor though, the bitterness was prevalent throughout. The beer really ended up thin and too sour toward the end, which really detracted from the whole experience."
"Monty Python’s Holy Grail Ale:  “Tempered over burning witches.” In a half liter bottle, with embossed hops on the side of the bottle.  Great looking beer, deep copper color, thick creamy white head.  Soapy aroma.  Initial taste had a very powerful cider taste, but as it warmed up, and I got used to it, the taste seemed to improve considerably.  Some bready malts, and a crisp bite of hops.  Not bad for what I assume is a novelty item."
"Pours a hugh airy sticky head, which setttles into a nice top. Body is a light orange hue, with some mild carbonation. Nose is herbs and grass and a pinch of good English sulfur, and maybe a little caramel. Taste is a swirling blend of malt and hops basically exchanging pleasantries as you drink. Malt, hop, malt, hop. Neither overpowers, neither runs away and hides. A fine English ale. What's next, Fawlty Towers Porter?"
"The ale was a little pricey, but it'll be in my fridge again. I liked it a lot. Like Arnie said...""Oll be bock!"""
"Pours a nice pale amber/copper color with a decent creamy off-white head that slowly sinks to a nice film that completely lines the glass.  Nice toasty/biscuity malt aroma with some nice fruity esters as well, apples and others.  After the great nose on this brew the taste is a little dissappointing.  Light toasty maltiness with some vague fruity esters again but I was hoping for a little more definition here, there is a nice lingering light bitterness in this one though.  Very creamy and fairly smooth on the tongue, but a bit of tangyness that I didn't really like, this brew is rather drinkable however."
"Clear, light to deep copper in color throughout the length of an Imperial Pint glass - let's just call it tawny. It has a light cream colored, massive, rocky head which dies down but holds a very good collar and whisp across the glass. Immense lace at the top of the glass, although it receeds as it lowers in the glass. The aroma is herbal (and I mean Ganja), somewhat metallic, grassy, with some light caramel malt at the back (and possibly some very light diacetyl butterscotch). There are surely some Fuggles in here. Quite an interesting and complex aroma, but not necessarily more than pleasing. The body is light-medium, but with a gentle creaminess. The flavor is quite metallic in nature, but has more of a mineral-like quality as opposed the the ""bloodiness"" of Bateman's XXX for example. This beer needs to be served at cellar temperature to be enjoyed, otherwise this becomes the leading note of the beer. Combined with a slight fruity character (that reveals itself quite readily on the lips but not so well in the mouth), there is also a dryish, woody maltiness that is quite enjoyable as it lays itself across the mouth and tongue. This is the flavor that represents the beer in the finish, along with a nice dose of bitterness and a dull, lightly tart note. Extremely English. So much so that I believe it will be misinterpereted by most. I don't think alot of tasters will be able to find the complexity here."
"Ohh yeah, this is a beauty. I love English ales like this, pack with flavour and complexities yet very quaffable at the same time. This was worth every penny of the $3.50 I spent."
"Regardless, a nice little treat from our beer brothers in the UK, and well worth seeking out for at least one try -- especially if you are a fan of traditional UK ales and/or Monty Python."
"Maybe it was just me, but it had a funky sweet herbal taste, besides this it was quite nice, malty body, soggy hops and Ok bitterness, medium bodied and different, quite a cool name, but a bit gimicky and tacky."
"I was very impressed with this beer from the dark amber color to the small but light head.  The brew had almost no aroma to speak of but what was there wasn't bad.  Great mouthfeel to it and a very malty taste that did lack on the hop notes.  But all in all I really liked this beer and will drink many more........CHEERS"
"I would have to agree with the initial review of this brew.  I am a fan of the ""burning witch"" reference as well.  Not too bad a brew.  The head was light and lacey, the aroma was slightly spicey and fruity...not great, but not horrible.  Try one on for you and your best llama."
"Pours a light copper and decent head with considerable lacing. Nose is citric hops and some grain. Not much going on in the malt side of town, but hops abound, fruity tart and oily. Body is pretty thin. Nothing special except the name."
