"Very nice—tasty and super drinkable, almost to a fault."
"Sweet but not too much, full-body taste for a light beer"
"Overall : Enjoying the tender taste and unique feel."
"Ok Could be a lot better"
""
""
""
""
"- sweet but thin, relatively mild and plain tasting"
""
"Never mind,a well made EPA with the honey adder."

"Overall: Refreshing, different and easy to drink. Was expecting more of a honey taste but the sweetness/bitterness combination is good. I could chug this all night..."

"Nice moderate carbonation."

"Overall-I like sweet beer so I was a fan. The honey flavor was stronger than other beers with honey I have had."
"500 ml bottle poured into an English pub glass. A dark lemon drop yellow with quick-breaking white head and a rather sweet buttered biscuit, orchard fruit spread, and floral hop aroma. More of the same on the palate, buttered biscuit and lightly honeyed breakfast cereal, subtle citrus (lemon and orange) and gooseberry/vinous fruit notes, nothing overly bold or assertive yet not bland either. Carbonation is low-key although the beer is not flat, with more mouthfeel than expected and a lingering doughy sweetness that carries through into the slightly chalky finish, where some lightly floral hops again make their presence known. Although there are no obvious flaws and the expected taste elements are there, I am struggling a little with the pedestrian and unassuming demeanor of this brew. What's there holds promise but one is left wanting more."

"O: Sweet beer, no pun intended.  I thought I’d had this one, but I am enjoying it more than I remember. Clear honey qualities, and a light sweetness makes it pleasant.  Bought in Bangkok at Paragon, drank in Songklha March 3rd, 2015."
""
""
""
"O: This beer is very easy to drink and the honey makes things a bit more interesting and prevents this from being a band pale ale."

"Totally recommended!"
"Nice honey flavour, sweet, mild, slightly bitter and tart aftertaste. Easy drinking and even flavours, but overly carbonated."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Basically a floral pilsner with a bit more body. Missing some taste at start, the honey incorporation is very light and subtle, kinda works, but could probably be a lot more."
""
""

"Food match: Honey-roasted peanuts. Ingredients: Salt, artificial honey-roasting agents, pressed peanut sweepings, Mmmm... (Simpson's reference)."
""
"Not much honey, but it was a decent EPA."
"500 ml bottle into pint glass, best before 4/6/2014. Pours slightly hazy bright golden color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense white head with solid retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings to the glass, with moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of honey, bread, cracker, biscuit, pear, apple, floral, grass, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of malt, honey, and fruity yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of honey, bread, cracker, biscuit, pear, apple, herbal, floral, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. No bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of honey, bread, cracker, biscuit, pear, apple, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Nice and pleasant flavors with balanced honey, bready malt, fruity yeast, and herbal hop flavors; with decent robustness and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a very smooth and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a good English blonde ale. Good balance of honey, malt, yeast, and herbal hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A pleasantly enjoyable offering."

"Overall: euch! I really don't understand honey beers. Most of them just taste like this one - a pretty ordinary beer that tastes like it has had warmed honey poured into it. Pretty awful stuff. At least this ordinary stuff would only be AU$130+ per equivalent case of 24 x 330mL bottles. Seriously, Fullers??"
""
""
""
""
""
"I really like it... not as macho-proof but as everyday feel good beer!"
"O - I expected more from this one...it looked really good but let down on the smell and i found the flavor not really that interesting. It was a light and easy to drink beer with really no major flaws but overall this was just okay and nothing special. I would drink this again but i wouldn't really seek it out."
""
"Pours to a nice white thin head that stays around with no lacing. Color is a rich gold with some floaties. Aroma is fruity and sweet with apple, pear and white grapes and some grainy malt. Flavor is grainy, fruity and crisp. Not as sweet as nose would suggest but actually quite sharp and balanced, yet no distinct hop character of any kind. Weird. Mouthfeel is fizzy and cider-like. Overall, this is a decent quaff, although it is more like some of my nicer homebrewed blonde honey ales than any sort of EPA."

"Remarks: Did not score A, T, S, M at that time; disregard those scores"
""

"Pretty much what you'd expect this to be. Sunny, yellow-golden in color, clear with a bit of a glow and wispy foam. The essence of honey more or less defines the aromas and flavors. Some toasty pale malt certainly factors in there as well, mostly in the aftertaste. A touch of light sweetness up front, though this all but disappears into a delicately bitter-floral, dry finish. Damn soft on the palate, quiet. All in all, not terribly complex, but delectable and drinkable for what it is. Probably would go well with a creamy flan or pudding."
""
"Pours a clear golden orange with a foamy beige head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, honey, and grassy aromas. Taste is much the same with grain and grassy flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."

"O: Love the taste, love the look. Summertime in a glass as one Hammersmith bartender memorably told me."
""
""
""
""
""
"Luckily, this ale is being widely promoted in Hong Kong, so there are many more places it can be found, and it's the least expensive Fuller's bottle available here."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a solid beer to drink for a while but there are better beers in the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Well balanced and packed with refreshing hops. Excellent drinkability, I could be drinking this all day long."

"An English drinking ale for certain. Has an easy drinking quality. I surprised it's 5% as it drinks and feels smaller than that. Richness and fullness of flavors start to open up as it warms. Not a knockout, but I'll never pass something from this brewery."
"An OK honey beer, though nothing special. Quite light in aroma and flavour, though the honey comes through. Would probably be alright on a hot day, but frankly there's not enough going on to hold my attention. Worth trying but no need to seek it out."
"Overall: another success from Fuller's - flavour is spot on, great mouthfeel - fantastic summer brew"
""
""
""
"Pours a clear, amber color. 1/3 inch head of a white color. Great retention and good lacing. Smells clearly of fresh honey, slight pale malt, sweet malt, and a hint of hops. Fits the style of an English Pale Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with a low carbonation level. Tastes of honey, pale malt, sweet malt, and a hint of hops. Overall, this is the first time I've ever discerned the distinct flavor of honey in a beer brewed with honey. That alone, would be enough for me to give this a high rating. Also, good appearance and feel."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - The honey aspect is definitely raw and natural, and although the result tastes a little odd it is easy drinking and worth a try"
"overall: I must say. I wasn't that impressed with the first one, nor the second. But somehow this one grows on me. Especially when hot and very thirsty this is an insanely satisfying drink. If you want to sit down and enjoy a good complex beer, this is definitely not the one. But if you're thirsty and just want something refreshing this is a great beer."
""
""
""
"O: I'd buy more of this if it was made locally, but for the price there are other honey browns and similar that I prefer."
"Final Grade: 3.7, an acceptable B grade. Fuller's Organic Honeydew is probably the best organic beer I've ever tried, but that's really not saying much. In fact, to be a bit blunt I could just as easily have said that it's the weakest brew from Fuller's I have yet tried. That being said, it's still well above average, and it makes for an enjoyable pint. Worth a try I suppose, but in the future I'll probably just stick to London Pride."
""
"This is quite a good representation, and is both drinkable and flavourful. Could be better on the finish and maybe a couple off notes (probably due to staleness), but worth a try if you see it."
""
""
""
""
""
"A decent brew from fullers that is perfect for summer."
""
""
""
"Honey Dew - The bottle says: “THIS AWARD WINNING BEER, DELIGHTFULLY TASTY, GOLDEN AND REFRESHING, IS THE U.K.’S LEADING ORGANICALLY PRODUCED ALE. BREWED USING CAREFULLY CHOSEN INGREDIENTS, ORGANIC ENGLISH MALT, ORGANIC HOPS AND THE FINEST ORGANIC HONEY, TOGETHER WITH OUR UNIQUE YEAST AND WATER, HONEY DEW HAS A MELLOW, ROUNDED CHARACTER DELICIOUSLY BALANCED WITH A ZESTY CITRUS FINISH.”"
"Overall: this is an interesting beer. I have a bit of a sweet tooth, so it rather appeals to me. I could see myself drinking quite a few of these in a session."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"This brew pours out a clear golden color with a finger of head that quickly drops. The aroma is very sweet, with a very realistic honey note dominating the proceedings, along with some lightly toasted malts. The taste is excellent, it's got the sweet honey tastes at first, but it fades to an absolutely sublime lightly toasted malt helped out by just a touch of honey. Delicious. The mouthfeel is quite quaffable. Overall, it's a great summer ale that I wish came in six packs."
""
""
"O: I am hooked on this Ale. Highly recommend it to be tried at least once, preferably cold on a warmer day. Relatively pricey compared to U.S. Domestic Beers, but as the old saying goes, You get what you pay for. In this case it is an amazing Ale."
""
"A good average beer that is very refreshing and easy to drink."
""
""
""
"Golden ale with a foamy head that has lots of retention. The color reminds me of mead, or maybe I just think that because I know there's honey in it. Aromas of sweet cereal and fruits. Honey is present and isn't overpowering. The flavor reminds me a bit of mead as well. Tart, fruity candy with a touch of honey. Grains are present as well. It's crisp and refreshing on the palate. This is a really lovely ale."
""
""
""
"pretty far from some of the better Fullers products I've tried but worth a try if you like honey"
""
""
"D - Great beer for a warm day, and a good alternative to a boring lager. Not an exceptional beer overall, but a tasty one regardless. Nothing I'll go looking for again in the future though."
""
"O: Crisp, fun, and refreshing. I'd love to try this again on a nice summer day."
""
""
"O/D - Meh. Not special but certainly not offensive. Sessionable for sure if it had more flavour aside from the honey note. No hops and little malty goodness to speak of, but the honey note is alright. Weak for Fuller's but I can see their target market here."
"O - This is a very nice English Pale Ale. A nice sessionable brew from Fuller's."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: An English Pale Ale that would certainly lend itself to summer drinking. Served at a slightly lower temperature than normal for English ales (as per the back of the bottle) this would be quite refreshing as a warm wealther quaffing beer, yet there's enough flavor to keep things interesting. Not a ton of depth, but it's a solid English pale ale, and it's certainly the best 'honey' beer I've ever had. The presence of honey is easily discernable both on the nose and on the palate but it's not overly sweet or artificial tasting. This would likely be a solid B if it wasn't for the fact that it's $4.00 a bottle. For what it is, that's just a bit on the pricey side."
"Pours a very vibrant blonde with an intense white foam head which dissipates into a thin layer atop the brew. Decent lacing. Smells very pleasant; earthy hops, malt, honey sweetness. Taste is also very nice; honey sweet with a present malt backbone. Slight floral/honey aftertaste which doesn't bother me at all. I could drink this one all night without a problem."
"overall, needs more flavor. just comes off as lacking."
"I wasn't sure what to expect with this beer. I usually like what Fuller's does and ended up being happily surprised. It's a nicely sweet beer with just enough citrus hops to keep it away from being too sweet. The honey comes through in the taste and also lightens the body. It would be cool to see this on draft somewhere in the Twin Cities."
"Overall, this beer has a lot of very refreshing lager-like qualities. As an alternative to a pale lager, this would be high on my list. It's smooth and malty without having any overbearing features and having any off flavours."
"Organic Honeydew is yet another in a long line of easily enjoyed Fullers beers. While it's undoubtedly an average sort of offering, it's a proper example of what an average sort of offering aught to taste and drink like; few breweries as large as Fullers can keep up this level of quality, especially with regards to their more mainstream-minded offerings."
"O - An ok beer, it beats Wells honey beer but isn't spectacular. I honestly expect much more from Fuller's whose brews are normally fantastic."
"O: OK"
"Overall this was a tasty beer. It got a little sweet but I could go for it again."
"Very average mouthfeel with little carbonation. Overall, a good beer, but nothing exceptional. Glad I was able to try it."
"Pours a golden yellow, with a transient white head. Some bigger bubbles fall to a thin film and a collar remains. Nose has some sweet honey, grainy bread and only a hint of the honey dew. Taste reflects the nose substantially, honey sweetness and some grain - the honey dew (melon) only becomes more apparent as it lingers on the palate after the fact. Some alcohol is detectable which isn't too desirable for this ABV. Medium carbonation and good drinkability. Good for what it is, but far from spectacular."
"Up to the Fuller's standard and a good organic in general. Nice summer beer and a great meal compliment, but too sweet as a session ale for my taste."
"very tasty stuff, a definite cut above."
"Pale blonde, one finger of white head, nice colour, no real head retention. Smell is biscuity, malty, semi-sweet notes of honey, subtle but notable hop profile. Taste is malty up front with a light sweetness rolling in, honey notes in the finish, bitter as well but remains throughout. Light to medium carbonation, creamy, medium to full body, good weight and very nice on the palate. Not bad, approachable and refreshing, solid and would revisit from time to time."
"Taste - Buttered toast and honey predominate, with bit of spicy hops for balance. Finishes very clean."
"O: Lovely beer to try. But not again. Maybe not in the near future. Miss-able beer."
"The honey would make it a bit too much to have a few of these, but a single feels about right."
"Deep, shiny gold in colour. Tight white head settles to a thin cap, leaving little lace. Delicate honey aroma with light biscuit and floral notes. Tastes like honey spread over lightly toasted white bread, finishes with subtly lemony hops. Low bitterness. Balanced and quite crisp, with very little aftertaste. Shy of medium-bodied, with light carbonation. While the flavour is quite simple, it delivers on the promise of its name and yellow-honeycombed, bee-adorned label. Nice beer."
"Pours a bright golden orange colour with thick white head that dissipates fairly quickly with some mild lacing. Smells of floral hops, fairly sweet bready malt. Flavour is quite sweet, I guess from the honey, but I'm not getting a lot of honey flavour. Nice bitterness in the aftertaste. Very smooth mouthfeel. Quite a nice English ale."
"Overall: Tastes like a glass of that Bit-O-Honey candy. Honey Dew is amply honey-tasting without being overly sweet. Simple but satisfying and refreshing, if the price were just a skosh less, I'd consider stocking up on it."
"Had a pint at the Anchor and Crown in Monterey, CA. I will say, for a honey beer this has a nice distinct clover honey aroma and flavor that doesn't overpower or over-sweeten the beer. There's still a mild pale ale in the background with a little grassy lemon hops and bready malt. Not a bad beer for the summer."
"From the bottle marked 22-APR-11-203-08:25. Sampled on April 12, 2011. the pour is a cloudy pale yellow-orange. Honey is easily noted in the aroma along with a grainy and malty sweetness. The body is light but also rather smooth and creamy. Fresh honey comes up in the taste in a likeable way with a thin hoppy ending. The sweet overtakes the hops all told."
"BBD: 2011-03-01 - I had it on 2011-03-19 (19 days after BB date)"
"Overall not a beer I would want to drink again, but the smell was spot on."
"Opinion: This is an OK beer overall. I like that it doesn't try to put a bunch of hops in there to compete and muddle up the honey. It showcases the honey pretty well, so for what it is, it really isn't that bad of a beer. That said, I was looking for something a little more ""boozy"" or something like it had mead mixed with it. As it is, it is kinda a sweet ""girlie"" beer...which is OK, but not one that I will be coming back to."
"D - No."
"D/M: Good weight and slight carbonation. Full balanced flavor that pairs very well with dessert."
"D- Tasty, but a little bit too sweet. Not the most drinkable English Pale Ale around."
"Overall, this beer is alright. Is has a few good features in the taste but it lacks a kick. Still, it's light and refreshing. Worth a try if your into honey beers."
"Medium body good carbonation, but not very helpful in drinkabliity. Run of the mill sweeter pale ale. Nothing worth going back to. Ok with food, but not a sipper on its own."
"Pretty clean, slightly sweet taste. Pretty much what I was expecting and what it is aiming for. One of the nicer honey beers I've had. Not cloying at all. Nothing complex, but I would strongly suspect that's what they were going for."
"D: I was hoping for a bit more honey in the taste but overall it was pretty good. The label says ""refreshing golden beer"" and the refreshing part is very true. The light watery feeling body would really cool you down on a hot summer day."
"Drinkability - This brew is ok. A nice change and a nice summer refresher. The honey gets a bit sweet as you drink and gets a bit overwhelming, but this could still be alright for a pint or two. It's different and worth a try just for the experience."
"Verdict: I'm really torn on whether this beer has gone out like a dud or whether my palate just needs some refining. Obviously, the honey content is easily distinguishable in this beer and no flavors are too bold to repel and lighthearted beer drinkers out there. Get it as far away from the BBD as you can and just consider the style of the beer as you drink it. Nice balance, good honey, some unexciting flavors. C+ (3.25)"
"Drink - Not a spectacular beer by any means, but one that warrants trying. The honey taste is actually pretty good and I can see how this beer would work well in the summer months."
"This bottle's best by date is November 26, 2009; it's about a year and 2 months off to be precise. Storage conditions were not fantastic also, admittedly so I will have to cut this one some slack here."
"D: Very drinkable. Balanced and light taste. Very session-able beer."
"Pint ant Barrowboy and Banker, London Bridge. Looks like a macro i,e Fosters etc. Pale, clear with bubbles, no head. Can't escape the honey taste, quite sweet. Wheaty aftertaste. Has a bit off fiz. It reminds me of a Kristalweizen. Of all the fullers I've had until now I think this is the best to session, especially as its organic"
"Drinkability: The honey really jumps out in this one. It almost tastes like a sweet pilsner. Not an overly complex brew, but very sessionable...Great for a warm day."
"A typical golden brown look for a honey lager doesn't try to put anything past you. With a nice, light refreshing honey-sweet aftertaste, this delicious import isn't necessarily anything to write home about but is a perfect accompaniment for a slice of pizza while playing poker. A full flavoured beer with a good body, I would certainly try this again."
"Fuller's Organic Honeydew has its merits, although a half-liter of it is plenty. Now let's see if Golden Pride ever hits the US shore."
"The sweetness from the nose dries out on the tastebuds and most of the flavor comes from a nice, grainy malt presence and the signature yeast. A notable, grassy hop presence makes this beer quite refreshing. Mild honey notes float in on the aftertaste. Feels good on the palate...nicely carbonated and does not come across as thin, despite being on the lighter side. I am glad I picked up this brew as an impulse buy...hell, I would not be opposed to drinking another one sometime soon."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. Yes, i know thats too cold! The beer had no head and what little there was dissipated fast. The beer really did not have a heavy honey taste, but was more rich tasting than most beers. I liked it and will buy it again."
"Poured into a imperial nonic a medium golden with a tinge of burnt orane,a 1/2 finger white head that had good definition atop.Mild aromas,mainly some hard water and biscuit malt.Flavors are lightly sweet with biscuit malt mainly standing out,a yeasty fruitiness is pleasant,not much hop presence to be had.Standard and no frills here but its quaffable, and food friendly."
"This is one of my favorite breweries, but this is just kind of standard. I would love to try this from a fresh cask in the UK, but out of the bottle this is just kind of generic. It is enjoyable however."
"A very nice Honey Ale that takes on Pilsner-esque flavors from time to time. Honey gives more of a honey suckle aroma but with true honey flavor and smooth feel. A pleasure to drink."
"Interesting to try, but ultimately not that great. Kinda neat flavor, but, even though it isn't obviously sweet, it creeps up and the flavor gets a bit much after a while."
"The beer is light but the taste is fairly assertive, very firm and well-rounded with some nice complexity. It has a lot of bread and leafy-herbal hops up front with strong honey and grain and bread dough taking over right at the finish. All the elements linger nicely, but the honey-bread dough character lingers longest. It is nicely balanced, with clear light sweetness and tingly-zesty, leafy herbal hop bitterness balancing nicely. Neither oily nor watery, it has a good, firm feel and it is highly drinkable."
"It does lack some complexity though, and it is not a beer I'd want to go for regularly."
"D: Despite the sweetness, this was actually pretty easy to drink. The light body probably helps that."
"Pours a three finger white head that fades slowly to a thin layer, leaving some lace. Crystal clear light amber color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Light grainy hop nose. Flavor is just as advertised - honey in ale, hops are subtle. $4.95 for a 500ml bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"D: Another quality effort from Fuller's. I liked that they advertised honey and it was there. A no brainer to pick up, it's Fuller's."
"This is certainly drinkable, too bad it doesn't taste like ale. They should reclassify this as a lager."
"On-tap at Chancey Smith's in London, Ontario. Clear golden yellow in colour with soft amber hues and a thin ring of bubbly white froth that persists for the duration of the beer. Some dots of lace speckle the pint glass. Smell and taste are biscuit, grainy pale malts, Honeycomb cereal, toasted wheat, light sweetness, and grassy, citric hops. The slightly sour aftertaste is probably unintended. Mouthfeel is a tad syrupy, resinous, refreshing tangy spice through the middle, bone dry, cracker-like finish. A decent and agreeable English pale ale, not much to dislike, but nothing to write home about either."
"A little bit dissapointing, i would not buy this beer again"
"Nothing too outlandish, but it's simple, not bad, and just a little different."
"D: If this beer weren't so hard to find, I would be drinking it far more often. Absolutely great session style beer with a great honey sweetness that strays from the typical mild English session ale. After spending a week in England drinking cask milds and the like, this was a surprising beer for me. Very unique and definitely worth picking up some."
"An easy-drinking palate, offering honey to taste, but without being really convincing. Honey is also present in the nose, in a style more grilled. The body is a little too soft and watery to really satisfy. Moreover, the lack of bitterness, often characteristic of Fuller's brewery is also disadvantageous. A model of Honey Ale, which gives an impression of poorly controlled, perhaps due to the absence of a higher ABV to compensate for the missing body, which remains light years ahead of Belgian models."
"Lacking in complexity, but fairly enjoyable. Certainly worth a go on draught."
"D: Really a nicely crafted ale. 'Balanced' comes to mind. Not outstandingly perfect, there are a few nits to be picked I suppose, but this is something a bit out of the ordinary, and I like that."
"Pours a clear straw yellowish (it was a dark room so I can't be 100% sure) with a short lived head atop it. Left light to no lacing. The nose of the beer had a sweetness to it and a bit of straw and apple. The beer itself was thin and had a touch of sweetness, but didn't have any substantive flavours or character that left me thinking it was much other than a macro. Once again the apple flavour was there, making me wonder if something was wrong with this beer. Bubbly in the mouth, and not a beer I would be reaching for again when given a decent second option."
"This started off like an unassuming, if tame, English honey pale, but ended falling on the poor side of drinkable. I find honey beers very often lack something, and this is no exception. Spice them, like mead, give them some character, or do something guys... This is at best bland; at worst undrinkable."
"D: It's not bad and easy to drink, but it could use some stronger flavours and aromas."
"D: Honey and hops in the very end. Fair enough, as a Fuller's should be."
"It's ok but nothing exciting."
"A beer you could have with ribs and fries while watching the game at the local sports bar, much better than most ales served at these places."
"The weakest (in flavour, not ABV) beer in the Fuller's range that I have tried to date. Clearly made for the Stella crowd. Decent, but not for beer enthusiasts or lovers of real ale."
"Not a very rewarding beer, unlike the rest of the fuller's commercial export line (Vintage, London Pride, London Porter, ESB)."
"D: I'm not a huge fan of honey-brewed ales. About 1/2 of them I've tried I liked, and the other half I don't care about, but this one is nice."
"A joy to drink, mellow and well rounded, just like the rear label claims!"
"D- In my opinion, this beer would be enjoyable all year round...as a session beer or while enjoying a hot summer day on the patio. I think this would go well with barbecued chicken and would even suggest that this could be enjoyed as a dessert beer. This has been one of my favorite beers since I discovered it and am surprised at myself for getting around to reviewing it only now. I highly recommend this one!"
"This is a pleasant enough offering, the honey employed deftly, I suppose, and agreeable in a drink the whole bottle sense, and never approaching cloying, always an asset when considering any sort of honey beer."
"Sweet, but balanced enough - though honey is certainly the outstanding character, this is a refreshing brew."
"Pours out into a very clear golden color, with a thing frothy head that quickly evaporates. Slight aroma of honey and hops. You can definitely taste the honey and a touch of bitterness, but the flavor is over very quickly. Goes down smooth and is fairly refreshing. Something for a sunny day while mowing the lawn."
"Not one I could drink a lot of but something to have every now and then."
"I probably wouldn't drink more than one of these because of the taste but if you were to dig it you could easily pound these back for a while. Just not much there."
"NOTE: ABV is 5% according to the bottle."
"Drinkability: This is yummy. It can be two kinds of beer: a refreshing, lagery blonde-ale type quaffer when chilled, or a more subtle, sweet real ale at cellar temperature."
"Pours golden colour with decent white head which dissapeared quickly. Smell - slight honey smell with touch of malts. Aroma is not very strong though. Taste - malts mostly with a slight honey sweetness, very pleasant actually. Crisp, balanced beer with very refreshing taste. Quite drinkable. Nice brew, goes down very smoothly."
"smooth, although slightly thin. gentle to moderate carbonation."
"Light and fairly sweet, this is a decently tasty and refreshing brew."
"Fullers Honey Dew is a good summer brew and ice cold is a great refresher. The taste is biscuity and there is a slight honey sweetness, not to strong but this is a good beer to have a few of and is perfect for the summer witha BBQ and also beats a lot of honey beers on the market."
"d: could definitely be a refreshing summer beer with just a hint of honey but a little on the boring side"
"Overall this was a fairly solid brew (as I would expect from Fullers), but maybe I don't really get the ""honey beer"" thing, though I recall a 't Smisje honey beer a few years ago that appealed to me."
"ABV listed at 5.0%. Pretty decent beet without being outstanding, worth a punt."
"Bottle from the LCBO. Nice golden colour, but no head. Aroma of honey was not overpowering, and I liked the subtlety it implied. Flavour was sweet, but too me it was a generic sweetness, and didnt identify with the honey aroma. There is also a malty kick in there. Refreshing, but boring."
"I've had this one a few times before, and every time it is a treat. Straightforward and tasty, perfect in summer. I really like this one."
"D - A nice beer that I'd drink more often if it was a bit cheaper."
"I have yet to try a honey beer that has blown me away, oh well this is still a very well made beer. Nice frothy white head that leaves some nice lacing but disappears half way through. Smells a bit off, but it gets better as it warms, the honey and malt are evident on the nose with some floral hop just sneaking in. The taste is sweet with some fruit notes followed by a slight bitterness and of course some honey. Clean and refreshing."
"Had on tap at Twisted Kilt 2.4 years later and it was honeyish, decent mouthfeel."
"Overall I like it and I plan on getting more soon. It will be great for a summer day, especially good for BBQ's."
"Very nice product...has me wishing it was easier to find and a bit cheaper because it could easily become my brew of choice in the summer."
"A taste of summer with a London accent. Light , well balanced and flavorfull with that distinctive Fullers brewery taste. I liked the subtle honey taste on the finish that arose when the beer warmed. Well done for a sessionable summer beer that has a certain English flair"
"Overall: A nice summer ale, very refreshing. The sour edge makes this beer very moreish  pity this is the only bottle I have."
"Would make a great session ale, but the spicy herbal clover from the honey eventually starts to overwhelm the malt and get to me. Would make a nice glass of ale to relax with on a late summer/autumn evening."
"Doesn't rate too high for me. Nothing bad about it, but nothing that gets me going."
"I take this brew as a second Fuller's favorite next to their porter. It's so drinkable and enjoyable I'd be tempted to make this a favored session ale and daily drinker but the price prohibits that."
"Very drinkable summer fare. Would make great session or crossover fare. Nothing challenging here, but i may be looking for this one when the next heatwave strikes."
"Crystal clear, pale gold with a short-lived, rocky, bright white head. There was a bit of coarse, clumpy lacing, but that died off after a few minutes. Sweet, honey-malt aroma with floral hops. Very mild bitterness, malty sweet, melon fruitiness, and floral hops in the slightly spicy finish. Medium/light body and carbonation, slightly drying with a decent texture. Not bad, nothing exciting. Fuller's makes a solid brew and this is no exception. It's just not a ""must have in the fridge at all times"" kind of beer."
"Part of the LCBO summer release. Pours a clear golden, big white head forms, billowy, goes fast, no lace to speak of. Smell is very grassy, citrus, honey, quite sweet, but pleasant. Taste is malty, grains, grass citrus and honey again, but once again pleasant. Mouthfeel is light bodied with low carbonation. I actually enjoyed this beer, pretty light, but a nice balanced flavour."
"500ml bottle....golden pour medium head...the nose is bready and grainy, some sweet notes. Taste was a little metallic, some malts & grainy bits....corn sweetness maybe? Lingering bitter-sweetness, not overly pleasant Light bodied, crisp & light mouthfeel. To be honest i can't give this very good drinlkability makrs. With every sip i'm constantly reminded of mediocre lables like Lakeport Honey Lager etc etc....it was dosappointing compared to Fuller's other offerings."
"A bit thick on the tongue, but drinkable as a sipper beer. Not one to gulp...just sit back an enjoy!"
"Bottle: Poured a deep yellow color ale with a surprisingly big white puffy head with good retention. Aroma of honey is quite dominating with some malt also discernable. Taste is way sweeter then expected with honey making a huger impact then expected (I guess Im getting used to those American honey brown beer where honey is quite subdued). Definitely too sweet for my own personal liking and one of the worst from this brewery."
"This is a honey beer that tastes like honey without it being overwhelming. It's smooth and very refreshing. Not a session beer but a nice one off. Not much head at all but a nice honey colour. There are a lot of beers out there that claim to be honey lagers that have none of the qualities of honey. This one does. It's a very well crafted quality product."
"Overall - An OK beer... nothing ground breaking but quite drinkable although it gets a little sweet towards the end.... worth a try..."
"Its a shame that this beer seems like an underachiever compared to the London Porter."
"D: Easily approachable & quite quaffable!"
"This is quite a nice honey ale, I will likely get this one again."
"I was surprised by this beer, its got plenty of honey flavor and a good deal of complexity. My only criticism is it could use more hop and malt flavors."
"D - It's alright, but nothing special. Definitely on the sweet side, and needs some balance."
"Pours yellow, with a bit of an orange colour tinge. Small head, about a half finger thick, which disipated slowly. Sharp, grass scent with a bit of honey and malt sweetness. Very refreshing taste. Sharp hop bite with a pleasant sweetness of honey and flowers. Smooth mouthfeel, though not creamy. Has enough carbonation to have a bit of sharpness to it. Overall, a decent beer."
"This actually reminds me more of a lager than a pale ale. Reasonably refreshing and smooth, but no real wow factor. Very nice on a hot day like today."
"Fuller's is capable of far better. Not to my taste at all."
"Nice bite on the tongue and invites you to hold it in your mouth for a while before swallowing., Smooth going down, but still, I can't say I'd drink more than one of these at a time, due to the fact that I'm not a sweettooth."
"M&D: very smooth and only softly-carbonated on the mouthfeel, this beer is very light-bodied for its alc. strength. Easy drinking but slightly boring, if compared with other British honey beers on offer; even the same beer's tap-version is slightly more complex than this bottle~~"
"Pours absolutely golden, as if it were a pils. Smells mildly of fruity hops. Taste is slightly bitter and fruity, followed by massive grain that won't be ignored. I like the grain at first but it becomes tiresome halfway through the glass. Nice full mouth. I'd drink one again if offered, but there are many beers out there I'd rather have."
"D = Average because it's an ok beer but a bit on the pricey side."
"500 ml bottle, bought in Denmark. ABV is 5.0%. Golden colour, moderate head, good lacing. Moderate carbonation. Aroma of malts and honey, some flowery notes too. Flavour is honey sweet and mellow but not cloying, fairly well balanced with the Target hops. Nice enough."
"I dont really get this one. I reviewed it chilled; maybe I should try it really cold?"
"I was really surprised by this beer. It pours a golden color with little or no head. The taste is very fragrant and sweet, like a pinch of fruits mixed with honey. The synthesis of the two create an almost chocolaty sense. The taste is all encompassing, yet not overbearing. You can taste the wheat in it, and the hops come in at the end. There is little after taste, and if anything it is just the bubbling of the carbonation in your throat."
"Other comments: Not a bad beer as it definitely reflects the quality that is common with Fullers. And I swear I'm not imagining the honeydew thing just because of the name."
"A fairly good ale, better than waggledance"
"Pours a beautiful golden color. Almost no head and the bubbles dissapated quickly. At first taste it doesn't really taste like beer because it has some sweetness to it. You can detect some of the honeydew flavor. It sort of has a mead flavor. It was pretty malty after the first taste, and finished off kind of odd. Just too sweet I guess. It was definitely good and could try some more."
"Pretty good, one of the best of the honey beers (better than youngs waggledance), slightly sweet honey-like start, decent malty middle, a few bready sort of notes, and a decently hoppy finish (slight citrus), my only problems were the slight sweetness, and general lightness of the beer, but besides that, i have no problems."
