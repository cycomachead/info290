"Watery, tasteless. Very foamy after opening the can. Only redeeming factor is that it's easy to drink, since it tastes like nothing."
""
""
"Love it, very creamy, smooth all the way through."
"Had this for the first time recently and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Not the best beer I have had but was easy to drink"
""
""
"Bland, soft, tasteless, dark, mediocre."

"I like this for being out with my buddies and drinking session that leaves me good the next morning."

"The nitro offers lots of creaminess and a nice flow in the light body with its gentle crispness. What I notice in this beer, though, is that it falls off at the end of every sip and thins out. Still, it doesn't fall too far, and keeps up a pretty good smoothness."

"Very happy I recently ran into this"
"Really did not enjoy this one, maybe I got an old can, but it was pretty bad"
"All in all, Tetley's is good stuff. Recommended."

"Overall - Quite a good beer, and one that you wouldn't worry too much if you threw a couple back, with remarkable complexity in the feel of it light yet perceptible, complex but not bewildering."
""

"Cheers!"

"Overall, a nice mild fairly well-balanced ale. I'd prefer more maltiness and body. Probably won't buy this again as I'm sure there are others out there worth trying that are easy to obtain."
""
"Pours a clear dark orange with a foamy light tan head that settles to a dense cap on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, fruits, and a some grassy aromas. Taste is much the same with malt and grain flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a low level of carbonation with an almost flat but creamy mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer that looks great in the glass but is quite mild aroma and flavor wise."
""
""
"O- A very drinkable beer. When I sit down for a review, I find it quite flavorful. I'd make it my session beer if it weren't still near $10 for the four tall cans. Why can't somebody make a sub-4% beer at a discounted price???"
""

"Poured from a nitro-can into a pint glass. Caramel-colored appearance with a foamy, sticky head that remains after the last drop. Light-bodied, watery, but holds onto a distinctly creamy taste. Hints of lemon citrus, malt and a slight grassiness upfront with a clean finish. A little lighter than I prefer, but very smooth and the creaminess of the ale keeps it interesting."
""
""
""
"Poured into standard pint glass. First impression I like the color copper with slight orange hue not much aroma hint of bread. After carbonation settled 1/4"" head nice lacing as the glass emptied. Good flavor the smallest bit of bitterness very low alcohol content not an issue for me as I don't drink for the purpose of getting drunk. I really enjoyed this ale. Pairs well with a variety of foods although I prefer stronger tasting beers with Spicey foods. Overall I am quite happy with tettley's. I would buy again."

"This beer has a nice coppery colour and a creamy look and texture. Surprisingly so for such a light beer. It has some hints of bready malts and also tea leaves, if I'm not mistaken. Just a slight bitterness is present. Very smooth with moderate carbonation. This definitely falls into the session beer category at 3.7% abv. Probably the lowest alcohol beer I've had, discounting the diet/low-carb beers. Definitely gets a thumbs-up from me!"

"Random can from my fridge. Poured into an UK Imperial pint glass. Nice rush of carbonation forms a thick but thin white head. Sunset orange colored body. Smell was faintly of marmalade. Taste was mild, with a smooth malt flavor and just a subtle hint of hops at the end. Mouthfeel was creamy, which is one reason I always enjoy nitro beers. Real low abv could lead to numerous cans being consumed. A light but satisfyingly rich beer to drink."
""
"O: This beer is very sessionable; I would have no problem drinking a few of these in one sitting due to its light body and low alcohol content."
"If I was choosing a session beer this wouldn't be first on the list, but not last either."
"O: Very refreshing, very light, and very easy to drink. This beer is extremely sessionable and definitely one that I could have many of in a single session. I really enjoy the creaminess and it is just as good as I remember it from nitro-tap when I was in the UK."
""
"A lot of flavor considering it's 3.6%, but compared to most beer it's just average."
""
""
"Nitro pour is always cool looking. Creamy - cream colored head, clear amber body. Smells faintly of English yeast. Not the most aromatic beer. Creamy mouthfeel, easy to drink. Nothing offensive or off balanced. Caramel cereal malt flavors. Hardly any bitterness. Fun to drink, highlight is the mouthfeel. Could be that I'm drinking a 3.6% English beer in America, but really no hop presence."
""
"I'm here in the USA, I had this beer once many years ago when I was in England with the US Marines. A few years ago, while living in South Florida, I was able to buy this again, however I moved to Pennsylvania, and I can not find it anywhere. I was searching and found this site tonight, can someone PLEASE send me some info on where I can order this and have it shipped to me? Thank you very much if you can. Jim at "

"O - this is a tasty, and very drinkable brew; I will have to look for this style/container more often"
"Overall: good to have only one will never have again. I hate to bash a beer but looks can be recovering. Can be compared to other like beers but doesn't step to that level. Salud!"
"O) I admittedly enjoy these nitro can English Ales more than most. This one is pretty good. Hell, at 3.6% ABV, I might plan to put back a bunch of these while I watch the Euro 2012 Football Championship. If you like Boddington's and Speckled Hen out of the nitro can, you'll likely enjoy this as well."
"3.0 D: Straightforward, average beer. It'd probably be tastier without the nitro."
""
"O - This is a really good beer for the style. Definitely could session a few of these."
""
""
"Great tasting, nice looking. Real filling and light bodied, super sessionable. Great beer."
""
"Overall this is a decent English beer but not the best that is out there. Pretty run of the mill. Would like to have it on tap sometime."
"Overall – interesting in general, but might be appreciated more from a tap."
""
""
""
""
"Simple, absolutely quaffable, so soft and creamy. Only knocks might be a very faint metallic aroma and aftertaste and a slight overall wateriness. Still, I really enjoyed this beer. Don't be an anti-nitro bigot!"

"This appears a ruddy brown with a lot of foam. One of those widget cans. Is there any aroma? I’m not picking up on it. Doesn’t bode well for the flavor either—tastes very thin, watery, like its mocking better British beers. There’s a somewhat unwelcome tartness that I didn’t expect nor desire. Not a lot else going on here, and not any reason to try it again."

"the appearance good, very nice foamy head,robust nutty color,with an aroma that compliments. Nice malty,bready,odor,with some sweetness too. BUT all this down the hatch....well not as rewarding. Tasted almost like dirty water. suprisingly I tasted water over everything?!! Will give it another try maybe this winter."
"There's something that really does it for me with this beer. I like the nuance of the aroma and bitterness along with very high drinkability. Might be a bit dull for some, but one of my favorites."
""
"O: Tetley's is a true disappointment. I have to wonder if its appeal is due to a degree of sentimentality, or whether it all boils down to availability. In any regard, I will not likely be drinking a can of this stuff again."
"O - If it had more flavor I would love it, but they just didn't pack quite enough in there."
"DELIGHTFUL, ENJOY YOURSELF!"
"From a widget can a large crack and hiss then in one fluid motion I pour into an awaiting glass. Foam filled glass slowly turns brilliant copper with a good two finger white head that has great retention and lace. Faint lack luster aroma is malty, earthy, with a bit of wet dog. Taste is subtle with light fruit and dark sugars. Malty and earthy taste. Medium to thin body, light level of carbonation with a creamy watery mouthfeel. Not a bad beer, but not especially complex or overly flavorful. At 3.6 abv I could probably pound these all night, but the real question is would I want to?"
"This poured out as a clear golden color with a verything white head on top that vanishes quickly. The smell of the beer has some lager like aromas mixedwith some sweet malts and grains. The taste of the beer is light but had some bread like flavors and a dry aftertaste. The mouthfeel is on the lighter side, some light carobation and has an easy going drinkability. Overall this is a decent brew in my opinion, Not too much else to say really."
"O: Nothing fancy, easy drinker. Another decent session beer."
"This is a good everyday session brew, if that's what your looking for. Beats Hell out of Lite Lager."
"Overall = A-"
"O - This was recommended to me by a Brit who just happened to be perusing the beer aisle when I was. I took his interest in Samuel Smith's as a sign of good taste. In the end, it's a pleasant beer, but not outstanding. You'd have to drink the whole four pack to get buzzed off this stuff, and that's a bit upsetting. Oh well. It'll be good for those who are just getting into beer."
"O: The taste was a bit disappointing given the appearance and smell."
"Overall: A decent beer but not what I commonly look for."
"Not sure why I had to have this one at Armanetti's...I just did. Good for me, right? It pours a clear pale straw topped by a finger of stoic lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises grass, light lemon zest, light-ish biscuit, and balsa. The taste brings in more of the same, along with some very light orange peel, white bread, and a moderate touch of dark greens. The body is a rather light medium, with a light carbonation and a decidedly smooth feel. Overall, an enjoyable, easy-to-drink brew. Not bad at all."
"Overall: I truly believe this to be a great beer, in a can. I would love to try this fresh on draft. I paid $8.99 for 4 pint cans and I believe it was more than worth it. I would recommend this beer to anyone...especially an ol' English chap."
"Tea-colored ale with a dense off-white head that retains for a long time. Very subtle aroma. Lightly sweet, toasted, bready. Flavors of bread and honey. Some mild, smoky biscuit and fruits as well. Not a very creamy ale, despite having a head that resembles vanilla milkshake."
"Overall / Drinkability: Well, for something that may be over a year old it's held up pretty well, although I wonder what I'm missing due to its age. Very sessionable beer...and as much as some of the parts are not really amazing, I actually could have another one. I think I'd have to have it with a meal though for more than one. By itself it's just okay, but again, I do wonder how much age is affecting the flavor and aroma here."
"O: This is a fine, low/medium alcohol nitro ale. Low hop presence overall and that might be it's weakest point besides being a bit low on the ""gravity"" side. Tasty Ale!!"
"Overall: Just an average pub ale."
"O: Pretty average. Nice to try...not up to par for regular use."
"Pours a 2"" head of tiny velvet bubbles which dissipates to 1/4"" head. Looks like clear Lipton tea. Smells and tastes like corn water, like most any other mass produced New World watered down beer. The only saving grace to this thing is the froth caused by the widget in the can. Pick most any other generic beer, can it with a widget, and you'd have Tetley's. Plus the froth wasn't even as long lasting or effective as other products with that same feature (like Boddingtons)."
"Slainte."
"Drinkability: Very easy to drink, this would be a great session beer. I could see drinking several of these, no problem."
"The taste was initially metallic but after the next few sips that subsided into a very basic and very good light malt and light hop profile. Definitely recommend this for some long term sessioning. Solid brew."
"nothing special in the taste, but definitely a super drinkable session beer"
"Overall: Great beer. Totally drinkable, but still plenty of complexity in this guy. I always find myself wishing that this were the style of beer that one could find on tap in every American bar, instead of Bud Light. At 3.6% ABV, this is a wonderful session beer that I could just drink all night."
"Drinkability- incredibly drinkable a great session beer at 3.6 percent you could drink these all day and has a flavor that was enjoyable enough to me to want to have quite a few, this beer will probably be one I would enjoy to visit from time to time"
"M- Creamy smooth, slightly dry."
"An easy drinker...at this low ABV, you could drink these seemingly all day. It's tasty, and just something you don't have to think much about when drinking."
"The best example of an english ale I have encountered."
"Every now and then I get on a kick for a certain type, country of origin etc type of beer. Since I had dinner last night at an English pub/resteraunt and had a few Old Speckled Hen's, I wanted to try some more British brews. I got a four pack of this one at the local BevMo today. Golden amber with a nice creamy nitro head. Smooth and creamy with gentle fruitiness and some faint roasty malts. I like it but like others have reviewed there just isn't much there. It's very subdued to say the least yet enjoyably drinkable."
"Drinkability is fine. Aside from the ""old tool shed"" thing, this is pretty enjoyable. I may make a point to keep this on hand in the fridge."
"	Drinkability: Looks great, feels great, just wished it tasted great. Doesn't taste bad, it just lacks any real flavor at all."
"D: I love the look and feel of nitro-beers in general, although I don't really like what it does for the flavor. This beer is no exception. The nitrogen flattens out what is already a very basic flavor profile to me. As unthinkingly easy to drink as it is, it doesn't quite offer enough to peak the interest for multiple takes."
"Is this manufactured by the tea company? It's darn good anyway. Pours spectacularly with the widget. Super creamy, with a pretty, bright white head. Much less metallic taste than any other nitro-can I've ever had. Amazing how complex such a seemingly simple-looking beer can be. Very good."
"Sure looks pretty though..."
"Drinkability - definitely a session beer. Does great as a refreshing post-exertion beer. Might go well with a garnish of citrus. I would definitely recommend this beer."
"Atmosphere is really solid. The appearance is quite majestic really; the nose not so impressive, but it's what the style dictates. Does well for what it is. The flavor is nice and full, nothing all that impressive, but full. Great texture and feel with this one too. I'd say presentation (appearance and feel) is it's strong suit; with the tangibles (nose and palette) not as outstanding, but not bad either. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
"The aroma is malty and yeasty with a bit of hops. The appearance is amber with a creamy - foamy head. The taste is like the aroma with a bit of caramel and cream and a lightly bitter finish. The palate is average for the style but the nitro head give it a creamy - oily feel. Overall this beer has high drink ability."
"Pours golden tan with a really pretty 1"" head. Smells lightly of malts. The flavor is also light malts. The first can I had was nice malts, and that's about it. The second can has just a hint of metallic, which is why I only gave it a 3 on taste. I love the mouthfeel on these nitro cans. Feels like cream. Very nice. You could probably put several away at only 3.8%."
"Medium-bodied with very little ""carbonation"". Easily drinkable and an excellent candidate for a session beer."
"Poured into a tall pint glass. The whole thing appeared to foam, but slowly gave way to dark yellow. There was a nice three finger head. There wasn't anything notable when taking a whiff. The first sip was great. This beer had been in the fridge for a bit, bit it fortunately wasn't all that cold. The thing I love about these specific english ales is the mouth feel. it's so thick and creamy. If anything it's the only why i really enjoyed this beer. It's light enough that I could go for another one, but nothing drastically grabbed my attention. It has a very light taste that borded some cheaper american beers, but the thickness of it makes this beer better than pabts or something. This is one of those good beers you have in the fridge when you want something good n light, not heavy."
"First time having this classic pub ale. Nice looking beer with an inch of creamy head that stays till the job's done. Smell is of english malt and bread from the yorkshire yeast. Not a big nose though. Taste is not as flavorable as I expected but still enjoyable. The hops weren't very pronounced which made for a malt forward experience with very low bitterness. Super smooth and creamy mouthfeel from the nitrogen. Very mild beer that makes for a great meal companion. In this case, english onion soup and fish and chips."
"D - This beer drinks smooth and goes down well, but I could see this being a beer that I'd only like to drink every so often, so as not to get tired of it."
"Drinkability: a pretty good pub session ale. I bet this would go very well with deep fried bits."
"The can almost exploded when I opened it up, never had a widget beer that did that before. Pours slightly orange with about three fingers of eggshell colored head. The aroma initially comes off as somewhat skunky, but gets better as I grow used to the smell. The taste is slightly bitter, but not due to any appreciable hop taste. Very creamy, Although the nitro can produces plenty of perfect head, the flat character of the beer takes some getting used to. I feel that the slightly skunky flavor makes this beer harder to drink. I could see myself being in the mood and craving this beer."
"D - This one is an outrageously easy chugger."
"very drinkable. i'd session this with fish and chips. of course."
"D - Just as intended for the style, this beer in infinitely drinkable. Flavorful, but mild on the palate. Not heavily carbonated, so doesn't bloat you very easily. Alcohol is low so you can have one after another and still find your way to bed without any help."
"Overall this is a fairly good beer. The obvious knock is the nitro gimmick, but some like this - so to each his own. I don't know that I would seek it out again, but it was worth the try."
"D - It was worth a try on tap at a British themed pub. It is a classic English Ale."
"Poured a hazy orange amber into an American pint glass, with a thin white head, very little carbonation (if any), and very good lacing. The smell consisted of caramel, toffee, biscuit, pear, and apple, and the taste revealed a beautiful blend of all of these individual flavors. Very smooth, light-bodied mouthfeel, more than likely the result of the nitro. Excellent sessionability."
"D- It is a little sweet, but it does drink decently well. A good English beer."
"D: This beer is pretty light and very drinkable. Would make for a good session brew, but is not overly palatable. About on par with a Guinness."
"Poured from nitrocan. Great agitation and firm head - fruity smell. Taste - subtle sweetness with smooth finish. Very drinkable. Session beer extraordinaire - only bought one but need about four. I will buy some more. I see why this is pub popular. Now all I need is a fireplace, a beautiful redheaded girl, and some celtic music."
"Drinkability is good. For an pale on nitro, this is fresh, well composed, and just flavorful enough to warrent a second. nicely crafted, and drinkable while staying extremely smooth."
"Overall a solid beer for drinking all night. I will look for this next time I'm at an authentic english or irish pub."
"D: This is a beer you can pound with it's low alcohol and drink all night, but the flavour is not really there. The pastuerization and nitro-canning probably took out the qualities of what could be a good cask beer. Unfortunately this is the only way we can try it here in the States."
"D: It's light in body and alcohol, but also on flavor. However, it's still a solid option for a session and was a refreshing change of pace. I followed up a few cans of this with a Samuel Smith's English IPA and it tasted like a bold American IPA, though."
"D= A good example of the style, which I would compare to Boddington's pub ale. Decent enough to want to session with an ABV that would allow it!"
"D- I will definitely be purchasing this beer again in the future....it's too bad that the pubs where I live don't have this on tap, b/c I'd be ordering this a whole lot! It's very easy to drink, the low alcohol just provides a nice little kick and it's not a heavy drink to be enjoying as a session beer! Great stuff and hopefully my next one tastes a little fresher!"
"d: VEry light tasting beer. The nitro and creamyness hide any particular full flavor notes."
"Pours out as all foam and ends up light brown with a light creamy head as it quickly settles. Not much of an aroma. Very little taste too, although nothing offensive either. Typical of some of the other english pale ales I've had. No body despite all the foam, no carbonation left either. Very light, you could pound these, if you wanted to."
"From a 14.9 oz. nitro can. Pours a cloudy brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some barley notes. Taste is light and very refreshing. Creamy with no bitterness. Feels light in the mouth and goes down very smooth. Overall this is a fine brew."
"Very light feel, the nitro creaminess makes this stupidly easy to drink, not a bad beer, not memorable either."
"I can see this, at 3.6%, being the beer to gulp down at your local with the lads before you head to Elland Road to watch Leeds kick some Carlisle backsides, but it's pretty pitiful in any other context. It's not even very sessionable because it just isn't enjoyable. Mild and inoffensive, but at the expense of the heart."
"From the 14.9 fl. oz can no. BB028L-23:30-02 DEC 09A. Sampled on June 27, 2009. The pour is a foamy, nitro-exploded reddish-amber with about a half a pint glass of frothy head that simmers donw after several minutes. The aroma is clean and malty. The mouthfeel is very creamy and foamy but that is because all you get is the nitro foam for the first 3 minutes. Once that dies down the taste is mildly hopped, sweet like caramel, and pleasant. I enjoy these English nitro cans"
"D: Incredibly drinkable! At 3.6% abv (the version I tried), you'd be hard-pressed to find a better session beer, especially out of other beer styles."
"Wow great beer...."
"The other reviews are pretty good, so maybe I had a rotten can"
"The taste is likewise not overly powerful but is mellow and very easy to drink. The grainy, yeasty base has a tiny late hop deposit that balances the aftertaste very well. Overall, the thin texture lets all the complexities come out. Definitely worth trying for the style."
"Conclusion: Nothing offensive, but nothing to really make me remember this either. If you want something for comparison, Black Sheep makes an a Yorkshire Pale Ale at 4.4% that is absolutely outstanding and more complex than many beers twice its strength."
"D: It's taken me a while to 'get' this style; what once was a mundane pour of low-hopped ale is now a symphony of subtleties. Extremely easy to drink, like water. Marry this with a plate of fish & chips and you've got a match made in heaven. Naysayers will find this 'boring', I find it exceptionally quaffable and perfectly 'English'. A must try."
"D - This is truly a session beer that I could drink all night. I enjoy the occasional nitro brew, and this is a good one. Obviously it's not a good choice if you're looking for bold flavor. But if you want a mild, clean tasting ale, give Tetley's a try."
"Amber colored beer with a rich creamy head.Aroma is spices.Taste is the same mixture of spiciness.This feels good in the mouth but that where it stops.Imagine a teaspoon of spices,water and cream that's what you're pretty much getting here.Will I buy again?? No thanks one has nauseated me enough thank you."
"Appearance has a nice copper color with a creamy head with good retention. Smell is faint with molassas and light malts. Taste is light with malt and hops having an earthy bitterness with a creamy mouthfeel. A very drinkable ale indeed thats a little light on the flavor, but good smooth body."
"I would drink this beer again. Its good for when you want to have a couple of tasty beers but don't want to feel the effects... Cheers!"
"MF&D - another watery beer, dammit. this could have had some more thickness to it to make it a bit more substantial, but perhaps that is something one give up when going nitro, not always the case I have noticed."
"D- excellent. I could drink too many of these..."
"This was one of the few nitro based beers that I have had and this was a bit more livelier than expected."
"Final Thought: The beer has great elements, just not enough of them!"
"The nitrogen is unnecessary, and it makes me crave a real casked ale from England, but that's better than a lot of these nitro cans. The nitro widgets makes the beer look great. I'm a sucker for that bizarre head. On the down side, it seems to pull some fullness out of the feel as the nitrogen subsides. The nose is all caramel, maybe with a touch of earthy hops. The flavors are buttery caramel, biscuit, some slight bitter tartness and some subtle hops. This beer isn't bad, but I can imagine how much better a traditional English ale could be and that's a rough comparison. Good beer for the style, but there's not a huge amount of high quality competition with wide distribution. I imagine that this beer could be combined interestingly with other beers."
"d: Not bad, just bland. Better than Boddington's though."
"D: Very easy to drink and the definition of a session beer. I enjoy this and would drink it again when in the mood for something simple."
"The pour is beautiful thing to behold: comes of the can a clear amber but with a swirling tan cloud of carbonation that verrry slowly works it's way up to a pitted, cream, off-white head with excellent retention. Aromas are extremely subtle but enticing: sweet molasses and buttermilk pancakes. Taste is okay: biscuity malts with a dull, earthy bitterness that is sadly mediocre for such an initially attractive beer. It's body, unfortunately, is fatally flawed: this beer feels more watery than water. An interesting beer that starts off at a sprinter's pace for excellence and quickly slides downhill."
"A great beer to revisit."
"Easy drinking, but it gets old about 1/4 of the way through the pint."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, silky, and very flat carbonation-wise compared to what Americans are used to. I like it though, makes for a very sessionable Ale."
"Drinkability is fairly high. It's an inoffensive beer, fairly enjoyable, and certainly sessionable."
"My can says 3.6% ABV."
"Some weird thing I noticed is the BA website lists it as 5% alcohol, the can in the picture says 4.4% and the can I have says 3.6%, so I am unsure which one is correct, or if they dropped the alcohol content in it. Either way it is still very good."
"Wonderful creamy mouthfeel with light carbonation, it finishes slightly sweet, slightly bitter. Pretty good stuff and worthy of revisits."
"This is a fun beer that just looks great. I could drink an average tasting and smelling beer if it looked like this. Good thing, Tetley's other qualities aren't that bad either."
"Pours out a light amber brew with nice dense nitro head. Scent of sweet malt with hops faintly in the backdrop. Taste is toasty.Tastes of some darker malts. A very good beer. Mouthfeel is good,, a tiny bit watery. Drinkability is high,,i didnt check but im sure the alcohol content is manageable,,no alcohol detected in taste."
"d: Super easy drinking as all nitros are. Don't know how much credit to give the beer, seems like nitrogen does most of the work in these things. Still, it is tasty and I could drink it all day long. Gains more flavor as it warms. More hops than most nitros. Good Stuff."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, very good representation of style, this is a very nice session beer with some substance that is worth drinking for a long time."
"I'd like to try this in a non-nitro version, preferably in a can so it can survive the journey from Britain. Not likely to happen though. I'd say this is like a mild, more than a Pale Ale. Recommended."
"Extremely easy to drink. With the low ABV of 3.6% I could drink these all day and night and not get too stupid. Not the boldest of beers so it might get boring after a few."
"I was really pleased to have been able to try this on tap but it was a bit weak in my opinion. If the flavors were stronger and more pronounced this beer would have been much more enjoyable."
"Overall, this would make an excellent session beer. Quite easy drinking, smooth and only 5% abv."
"A good, solid cream ale. Very easy to drink, inexpensive to buy and not too hard to find. Don't expect explosions of flavour though."
"D - With such a lucious mouthfeel, low alcohol, and mild flavor, this is some of the easiest drinking stuff there is."
"A good, solid cream ale. Very easy to drink, inexpensive to buy and not too hard to find. Don't expect explosions of flavour, and there is very little to dislike in this one."
"This guy suprised me a bit. It posesses just enough character to keep you interested while that nitro blast gives this a wonderufl look and feel in the mouth. Oh and did I mention that this is sub 4%? I'm ready to pop another!"
"The drink is medium-bodied with a wonderful creaminess, and is extremely mild and drinkable despite a dearth of real flavor."
"Very drinkable session beer that has minimal flavor for a somewhat quality beer. Nice to have around."
"<p>Purchased: Plaza Liquors; Tucson AZ"
"An amber colored brew with a big light tan head. The nose has mostly light malt, but some dry hops can be found. The flavor has toasted sweet malts with a light hop bitterness. The body is light but clean and smooth. This is a good English ale, but not worth the price they charge for a four pack."
"Packaging - I love a can with a widget, but that's just me. It is nice to note that they tell you about said widget right on the cans. Nice bright colors. It just about shouts, ""hey, I'm a British beer."" I'd say they marketers are also trying to give it the, look our label is in an old style, we've been around a long time, type of treatment."
"D: With only 3.6% abv and a nitro widget how can this be anything short of easy and smooth to consume."
"I never do, but the drinkability on this beer gets its own paragraph. While the flavor might make me want to switch to something else after many pints, the smoothness and initial drinkability in this beer is not fair. I really mean it when I say it's too easy to drink. Is this what the English drink at soccer matches? Great choice for a session brew."
"This one opened with a big rush of air and bubbles. It poured very foamy with loads of tiny little bubbles that slowly formed a thick, white and creamy head. Very cool looking! The body was a nice golden honey color with good clarity after it settled down. The aroma is light. Carmel malts and peach. The favor is buttery smooth and malty sweet up front. This fades to an odd watery and metallic middle that finishes with some herbal tea like hops. The palate is velvety smooth and medium bodied. Overall this is a grate looking beer not much flavor. Tetley's is interesting however and I would like to try it on tap."
"I tried this beer by itself and with food, and I suggest it be tasted with food as well. That compensates for the total lack of flavor and takes advantage of the watery nature."
"MF&D - Smooth & Creamy, just as the can reads. A little watery, with very little in the way of carbonation. Great session ale, I just wish it had a little more flavor."
"As soon as I cracked the top, it began making hissing noises as though something were angry inside and looking to escape. I was happy to help and as I poured, I got a lovely cascading action as the pour eventually settled into a finger's worth of solid, eggshell-white head. The beer was a beautiful deep amber color with NE-quality clarity. The nose was slightly caramel-like, perhaps buttery, but not in a diacetyl way. Let's stick with caramel. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium with a mild hoppiness on the tongue. Finish was very smooth with a faint, lingering hoppiness after the swallow. Its low ABV makes it a session candidate, plus given its inexpensive cost and portability in a nitro-can, I would say that this is a winner!"
"D- Very easy to knock back a few of these beers. Well balanced all around with good taste and mouthfeel. I wish I had stumbled onto it sooner. Reminded me of Boddingtons only a bit smoother."
"D-A good beer to sit down with and have a few"
"D = A nice light, flavorful beer, I could happily drink this on many occasions. The can I have is marked 3.6% ABV and it would make a great session beer."
"Poured from a widget can - always fun to watch the cascade. Turns out a nice light brown with a rocky head. The aroma is initially banana like with some sweet malty notes. The taste is light and malty - not very strong. The mouthfeel is medium. This is a non-offensive and easy to drink brew, but nothing to go out of the way for."
"D: Quite drinkable. Almost too. The light body and low ABV makes this go down easy. It's becoming one of my favorite beers to keep around the house."
"This was from a widget-can. Poured a nice golden color with cascading head that was reminiscent of a golden-colored Guinness. After that I was kind of disappointed with the blandness of both the aroma and flavor. Very easy drinking, but definitely lacking in character."
"Pours a wonderful amber with great head and nice lacing (it almost seemed tri-toned for a brief moment). Excellent scent, a heady/earthy aroma. Good taste, a nice spicy maltiness with a slight bitter aftertaste. It's not the strongest tasting ale, but very light and pleasing. Goes down very smoothly, it's a very creamy ale."
"D: This is a decent representation of a classic English Pub ale. It's low ABV, decently light body, and smooth texture makes it easy to throw back. It would certainly make an excellent session beer as you could probably have 6 of them before you even feel anything! However, it's not my favourite style so I don't know if I will be buying it again in the near future. I would like to try Boddington's version of this style however..."
"Overall, I was hoping a little more out of this one, but i just dont get anything in it. It's not bad, but not for me. If in the mood for something similar, i would rather grab a boddington's."
"I'm not a huge fan of nitros, but this one was so smooth that I found myself quaffing it down quite easilly. This is a very drinkable ale, and I was very happy with it. I didn't get the ""watered down"" taste that I have had with others like it. Its low ABC of 3.6% makes this beer ideal for sessions, and it's going to become one of my new favorites. Highly recommended."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Even though this style should be cooperative and well behaved in the mouth, this is extremely thin and uneventful. If it weren't for the wad of foam slamming into my teeth on that last gulp, I would have had to call the texture police. The drinkability factor is terrific, I could easily quaff six of these godzilla cans in a single bound. Lovely for what it is... I would gladly enjoy this again."
"mouthfeel was average a little sharper towards the end but not over powering or unpleasant in any way. ruby colored but to me, was comparable to boddingtons. definitely worth a try would buy again...good change of pace"
"Very creamy and thick on the palate, especially the head. The body is creamy but not particularly viscous. The carbonation is mellow due to the tiny nitro-bubbles. The finish is clean and semidry. Not to terribly exciting but better, in my opinion, than others advised."
"Pours a sudsy light amber with a dense thick white head. Aroma is malty with some dust and a dab of pine. Taste is pretty simple; malty and a faint touch of citrus with a soapy bitter finish. Creamy! Heavy body with dense bubbles. Quite a bit of lacing. Pretty straightforeward."
"This beer took a little time to grow on me, so it's probably a good thing the can is nearly 15 oz. One friend has likened this beer to bath water, and with the soft nitro feel and light flavor, I can understand that, but disagree. It had a pleasant mellow caramel malt matched by a long-lasting grassy hop bitter. Super smooth and I can imagine this being quite nice from a cask and fresh."
"The beer poured a pleasant amber with a light tan head. The smell is nice and sweet with a bit of maltiness. The taste is very smooth with a little sweetness and just the tiniest hops touch towards the end. The taste is pleasant but rather muted. The mouthfeel is nice and creamy and very enjoyable. This beer is incredibly drinkable, and I could imagine putting back quite a few."
"D= you could drink this forever but you might eventually get a little bored and switch to something more exciting, if available."
"Dark gold color with the smooth creamy nitro head. Faint nose of hay and fruit. Tastes like plain biscotti with a mild fruitiness and a slightly bitter finish. Real rich and creamy nitro character aids in the slip-down-the-throat factor. Mine is one of those 3.6% versions, so this is the real deal session beer. All night long baby - yeah!"
"Drinkability: Definitely a pleasantly drinkable session beer."
"Unless you've experienced real British pub ale, then this may come as somewhat of an unpleasant beer. The nitro can creates a very smooth and creamy head, similar to what you'd experience with a Guinness or Beamish nitro-can. The smell is malt, bready, some sweet notes as well. The lacing and retention are first rate. The carbonation is nil, and I'm not sure if I had this on tap whether it would come off quite this flat, or whether this is the physics of the nitro-can. The taste is very smooth, very flat, somewhat dry, and overall quite a light body. There is no real hop characteristic until the very end, where it does come through to an extent. The mouthfeel is watery, light, and somewhat creamy on the tongue. Not a bad beer, but unless you have an appreciation for the style, it could be a real turn-off."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink and it sure does smell nice, but it's weakest area is, unfortunately, in the taste department."
"D- With the low ABV, it's easy to put back a few of these. Very similar overall to Boddington's, but with a more pronounced hoppiness in the finish"
"Pours a orangey bronze color with a good size off white head that stays at a 1/4 inch collar all the way through and leaves sticky lacing down the glass.The nose is fruity malts with a hint of caramel.Taste is rather watery thin,very easy to consume,malt flavoring with the caramel coming through leaving a hint of bitterness behind.Very light body feel and low carbs.Goes down too easy,can polish these off like nothing,low on the alcohol too,overall,not bad,got a creamy feel to it as you sip on it,i enjoyed it,but hard to get a buzz off of it."
"drinkability - Easy drinking beer, enjoyed it alot."
"D: Too drinkable. Will not be buying again."
"This is a fairly average ale; almost like a fair-haired Guinness, but not as much flavor. It sure was smooth, with little carbonation and very low bitterness. There's just not too much to this beer in terms of flavor. Slight hints of fruits I suppose. And, despite the low ABV (3.8% on the can I had), it felt a bit filling. Give it to your friends who only like Guinness, and they'll probably enjoy it."
"Smooth & creamy, I can detect this has unfortunately lost some its strength as far as the flavor profile is concerned. Tasty, but thin. It drops off way too quick. Easy to drink, but I won't remember to ask for this tomorrow. But if you put six in front of me, I wouldn't argue. Recommended."
"This was presented in a 20 oz imperial pint glass with a perfect pour and still cascading as it was set down. Two fingers of white head and an amber hued beer. There isn't much smell going on here just a touch of malt is all I can really pick up. The first sip is very light and very creamy and light textured. Taste is slightly sweet with some slight maltiness. Good mouthfeel with light carbonation and very drinkable."
"D: It's so mild that you could drink many in one sitting. Not too bad."
"Served a nice pale orange with the normal thick lasting nitro head. The aroma is some mild earthy hops and sweet malts. The taste is a decent balance of sweet malts and hops, but a little week. The beer is light bodied and the nitrogen makes for a good smoothness. This one was mildly enjoyable and worth trying on $3 pint night, but not something I'd likely seek out again."
"Poured into a Guinness pint glass. Neat nitro pour effect precipitating up the height of the glass like a curtain being raised. Settles to a thick and dense creamy off white head. The beer is golden colored with just a hint of red at the thickest part of the glass. No carbonation, really. The smell not so awesome. Hints of dirty corn and cardboard get in the way of a relatively nice malty aroma. The malty smell reminds me of that in a czech pils, or a german kölsch. The taste is surprisingly good, despite the unfortunate smell. The best parts of that smooth malt come out and are complemented well with a light hop affect at the end. Light and dry, yet the nitro provides a silky-smooth, and creamy mouthfeel. Drinkability gets an average because of the dank aroma."
"D: Low alcohol content so have three or four they just keep getting better. I give her an A!"
"Nothing remarkable about smell. I have had this beer a few times now, and almost always wish it was a tad hoppier otherwise, Tetley's has a good taste, a little bit malty at times, but none the less pleasant. Good clean ending. Somehwat creamy. I could sit here all evening and drink these without feeling over loaded, but I'm sure that due to the fact that it is lower in alcohol."
"This site says it is 5.0% alcohol by volume, but the can says 3.8% alcohol by volume. Not sure which is right, but either way it would make a good session beer."
"Drinkability: At 3.8% Alc by volume this is easily a sessionable beer. Goes down smooth and taste is pleasant enough"
"at just 5%, highly drinkable"
"D- a light and tasty brew i could easily drink all 4 pints, i would just like a lil more carbonation and a some stronger flavor"
"Overall: An excellent session brew. I would definitely buy it again."
"Also got to sample this one on tap at Brit's pub in Minneapolis. The imperial British pint glass just adds to the aura of this delightful English ale. This was a good looking ale, deep amber in color with just a hint of a fluffy head, riding regally on top. Smell reminded me of pub crawling around England. A definite malt presence with fruity notes. Taste was of a tradition-tied English ale; not overpowering, but good and refreshing. Malty throughout with just a note of hops thrown in for good measure. Overall, this was just a good beer. If you want a real English ale, definitely give this one a shot."
"Tetley's English Ale was amber in color with good clarity. It had a nice large creamy off-white head with excellent retention and left lots of lacing stuck to the glass. The aroma was malty and a little fruity with some floral hops. The taste was light malt with floral hops in the background. The finish was fairly dry. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy. Drinkablity was good. It's a decent beer, but I think it would be better without the nitrogen."
"Can sez this is only 3.8% ABV, and considering that it has an awful lot of character and flavor. I could drink it all night!"
"D- Very drinkable. Sadly, it's mostly because of the lack of complexity."
"Poured into a 20 ounce pint a hazy orange - ish color, with a thick white head. Has the aroma of sweet malt and light fruit. Thicker body and a sweet taste. This is a very English style ale. Light and rich, easy to drink and really non-offending. A good session style ale."
"Pours a hazy amber color with a silky smooth one-finger head that just sits there. No matter what you do, you cannot disrupt this head. I love the way the foam just sits there. Waiting. Waiting. Not moving. Awesome. The aroma is lightly fruity and malty sweet. Very subtle and nice. I get some pear and banana scents here, but nothing too strong. The taste is pleasantly subdued as well. Very British, this Tetley's. Nothing too wild on any front. But consistently pleasing, for sure. Tastes malty and a bit sweet. Very yeasty/bready in flavor, with some mellowing hops hard at work. Finishes bitter and chalky. Mouthfeel is silky smooth at first, but that chalkiness is hard to ignore at the end. On the whole, however, I'd call this a very drinkable session beer. Reminds me very much of my college semester abroad in England. I do love a good English pale ale, and Tetley's nitro can doesn't disappoint."
"A good lighter English Mild."
"D - An extremely easy drinking brew! Mild mannered but refined and intriguing...very British. Would go well with a burger for sure."
"Dangerously easy to drink. A pleasant English ale. Flavor is unified and so smooth. Certainly worth a try if you are in mood for something mild."
"The body on this is getting mighty thin, but it really stands out as a session drink, one I would enjoy drinking throughout an evening  or the day, for that matter."
"I wouldn't want more than one of these at a time"
"This beer pours an attractive honey amber in color and is capped with the creamy and dense nitro head. It is a good looking beer. I enjoyed the aroma of this beer even though I felt that it was stifled by the nitro head. Sweet biscuity and caramel aromas are evident with just a suggestion of the hops. This beer is just a bit leaning to the bitter side but nicely balanced. Despite the smallish nature of this beer it does not lack in flavor. The flavors evident mimic the aromas and this produces a very smooth drinking beer. I would like to have this beer on cask rather than in the nitro bottle. It is my impression that it only detracts from the overall sensory experience of this beer, with the exception of appearance. Seems to be a good example of style."
"Final Statement: Had previously in a can and it was terrible. This draught version was so highly drinkable it makes for a dangerous session beer. Ultimately, I'm a bigger fan of North American craft ales, but there will always be a place for a quaffable mild english ale such as this."
"A generally average English ale. Nothing impressive -- it's quite lacking in some areas, but (aside from the somewhat watery taste) there's nothing outrightly objectionable. I'll pass in the future, most likely."
"easy to drink..but then so is water..won't be searching for this one any time soon."
"Easy to drink, but I will pass."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable, and well worth a shot if you see it in a store."
"The taste reminds me of lightly salted saltine crackers. It feels a little too flat for me, though. Not enough carbonation."
"Slightly sweet, a bit thin and watery, but creamy and easy enough to drink. If you like mild English ales, this could be worth a try."
"You could probably drink these one after another, but wouldn't be too motivated to do so. Okay, but not real interesting."
"Very light and thin with a smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Bitter flavor at the start, but with a chemical aftertaste that grows as the beer warms. Flavor is very disappointing."
"D - Medium drink so you could drink a fair bit, not anything objectionable but such a mild flavor that it's not something I would pursue."
"This is a good all around pale ale. The color is dark brown with a bit of amber, and has a nice head that melts into some lovely lace. The smell is light, with a good balance of malt, hops and a hint of earthy fruit. The taste is mild and pleasant, with a lot of creaminess and grain. Roasted malts and some alcohol is also noted. The mouthfeel is almost silky, with mild carbonation. An excellent ale for any occasion."
"Incredibly smooth and easy to drink. Quite Satisfying. Goes down easy I like to grab one for a change of pace."
"D: Good. I'd drink this on a hot summer day. Very creamy and enjoyable."
"D: I don't love the flavour, but given its strength, it'd certainly be sessionable."
"Drinkability: Smooth and easy to drink, but I could do without the floaties for this style. I will try this one again maybe this 4 pack was sitting for a while."
"14.9 oz smoothflow draught can. Alc listing of 3.8%. Pours a nice creamy sunshine-yellow-wheat color. Head is thick and creamy which is typical of the widget-type cans. Smells nice with a mix of butterscotch and an old stock ale. Taste and mouthfeel are weak. Mild, watery and like butterscotch. No hop bitterness at all."
"By the end of the glass there's not much left to desire."
"I could see this beer going down in a hurry, in fact, I'm seeing it right now. I didn't expect to like it as much as I do. Glad I picked it up."
"Of course once the bubbles settle things normalize. The settled beer is a deep straw and the thick head sticks around throughout the drink. Because of the slight carbonation you can easily drink several of these beers, making the beer a fine session choice. The smell is interesting but forgettable. The taste is serious hops but not flowery."
"I had my first Tetley's at bar I frequent with a bunch of friends of mine called McGregor Food and Spirits. This turned out to be an decent brew. Not as flavorful as I hoped but smooth as silk. I poured the beer into a glass and watched the huge head quickly disappear. Nitrogen bubbles were tiny and a buddy of mine explained that this quick ""deheading"" is called cascading as the bubble force the beer to the surface. It has a mildly sweet taste but I'd use this beer in some sort of drinking game so it can be imbibed swiftly."
"This is a strong flavor english ale. It pours with a thick head, and the nitro can makes the entire beer look white for a few minites, it's quite interesting. It has a strong almost coffee like taste. Reminds me in a way of newcastle brown ale. This is a pretty good english pub ale, i perfer ti to boodingtons."
"Pours a slightly lighter copper than I'd anticipated, very clear, and with a bright white head that builds to nearly three fingers before dissipating, leaving some lacing. Smell is underwhelming, just a touch of bitterness and caramel present. Taste is fuller, English hops providing a substantial bite, and the malts are caramel a bit fruity, with some berries and apple present. A grainy note and some diacetyl impair the flavour a bit. Mouthfeel is well carbonated, crisp, and full, and drinkability is good. Not a great bitter, but entirely acceptable. I might have it again if I found it somewhere, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it."
"Poured a reddish golden colour with a slight off white head which dissipated rather quickly and left a little lacing. The smell was slight, but i picked up on a fruity character and a very sweet malt aroma. The taste is pretty enjoyable, sweet honey/caramel malt character mixed with some spicy & nut flavors and some mild bittering hops in the finish. Overall i found the taste to be well balanced but i was expecting a little more bitterness due to the style. The mouthfeel is crisp and dry and i think i would have enjoyed a little more body on this as it comes across a little thin. Overall i did enjoy this beer enough to drink it again, but not the best bitter i've had."
"Terribly downable and awfully likable. A pub ale to keep a smile on your face even when you're losing at darts."
"All in all, Tetley's English Ale isn't a bad little beer. Like Boddingtons, its mild, creamy and smooth, but with a touch more flavour that BAs might be looking for. I'm not sure if I'll ever buy more, but it's still certainly worth a try."
"This is a brew I used to drink a lot before my BA days. And it is as wonderful as I remember it being. I look forward to drinking more of this in the future."
"Tetley's is dark copper in color with the typical slick, creamy head produced by a nitro can. As expected, retention is very high. Aroma is a combination of sweet grainy malts, mild herbal English hop, and nitro can smell. Taste is smooth, yet very flavorful. This is easily the best nitro can expirience I can remember having. Sweet english malts are paired with a very full leafy hop. Drinkability is very good, I wish we had this in Texas, this would probably be my EPA of choice."
"I could see this one as a great session beer. It goes down smooth and is quite refreshing. My review may be a bit low, but this is not a bad beer, though it is not a great one either. It's just a bit too bland."
"Mouth: Not much mouthfeel at all - in fact, it's pretty horrible, like it's completely flat. There's a nice, light bitterness and a touch of sweetness to the front but the terrible mouthfeel and the addition of a metallic flavor make this beer a real loser."
"Typical nitro pour, after settling, a flat creamy 1/2 inch head stays on top of a chill-hazed amber beer. Thick sheets of lace on the glass. Some hops to the aroma, slightly tart and sulfurous. Mouthfeel is on the thin side with well-spaced fine carbonation. Musky caramel malt backdrop, a little bit of cocoanut. Not a bad leafy hop balance to start, nothing distinctive however. Slides into a somewhat watery finish while hanging on to some residual sweetness. This one has more flavor than Boddington's Pub Ale, at least."
"Overall, not a bad session beer to sit around and watch football. Nothing too exciting."
"Dear Lord I thought this was a good tasting brew! The appearance is medium brown with a one inch white head. Leaves a consistent lacing on the glass. The taste is excellent -- smooth, a little bitter, and you can really taste the malts. High drinkability. I could have drank this all night. If you haven't tried it, give it a shot!"
"Djust ok. Would I have another? Sure, but would pick something else if I had a choice."
"Drinkability: This beer is easy drinking, low in standout taste and very low in alcohol. This a very sessionable beer. However, I would not likely seek out more of this anytime soon."
"Because of its simple taste, refreshing qualities and low abv makes this quite drinkable!"
"The frothy head acts as a layer of insulation between my nose and the aroma of the beer but after taking a sip I am able to distinguish a malty, grainy smell. The taste is ever so slightly hoppy with a warm loaf of bread taste to it. The smooth mouthfeel and the cozy taste make this a very drinkable beer."
"Loud opening, smooth pour resulted in a yellowish creamy looking brew that settles in moments to a gorgeous tarnished bronze with a stubborn tightly tiny-bubbled head. Smell is mildly ashy, almost the scent of peanut skins or shells sans nuts. Taste is mild malt with a dash of English hoppiness. The mouthfeel undermines the experience. This beer looks so delicious. Easy to quaff. An alternative at parties and not unreasonably priced at $1.59 for the single 500ml can."
"Drinkability: One, I think, is enough. I want something a bit more substantial in taste and in mouthfeel."
"Comments: I think this is a good occasional English pale ale, but would not choose it when given a range of choices. The flavor is a bit on the bland side & I personally prefer more carbonated ales. Again, good for when looking for something mild, but don't anticipate a flavor burst when ordering."
"Mouth feel is medium bodied and a bit light on the carbonation."
"Mouthfeel is just as creamy as the appearance would suggest- soooo creamy and smooth, very nice. Quite drinkable- I'd enjoy a few of these at one sitting. A wonderful find that I'll be sure to keep a few spare of in the back of the fridge."
"Tasty enough and very very smooth."
"Drank this beer straight from the nitro can at a party. Taste is fairly bland, but inoffensive. Bit of caramel in the taste, mild hop flavor. Overall this is a decent but unexciting beer. I wouldn't go looking for it, but I wouldn't turn it down either."
"D - This might be an excellent beer to wash down bangers and mash in some quaint village in England, but anywhere in the world this is just forgettable swill."
"This is a pretty good English Ale. It pours just a beautiful creamy head with even for a nitro-can. The near-golden color of the beer is also very inviting. The beer smells a lot more rich than it tastes. It smells of malt with a touch of hops. This is also how it tastes, also with some buttery diacetyl. I find it to be very thirst-quenching but not really all that satisfying."
"Served on a nitro tap, after it settles this is a nice bright clear copper with a finger of creamy smooth off-white head, curtains of lace left behind. Nose is muted--slight haylike grassiness, slight hint of a malt, not much to smell. Taste is that of a simple pale ale, nice pale malts, slightly caramel, gentle touch of grassy hops. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy and somewhat flat tasting, just like any nitro, but with this simple ale it works well. I love nitro beers--they don't give me gas like regular ones--and I could literally drink this nice little pale ale all day long."
"Well I don't like this at all on the nitro and I think it would be worse just in a bottle. Tall tan and a thick white nitro head that laces the whole fucking glass. I don't really smell anything except the memory of a beer. Taste is a pale ale of BMC quality. So bland and at the bottom edge of style that I might as well have got a water. This is too thick for its own good and not something I really care for and I won't drink again anytime soon."
"I think possibly the only reason I enjoyed this beer was because I just got off work and I was tired and thirsty and a beer - any beer - really hit the spot. Its basically like a lighter colored Guinness. If that is your thing, by all means give Tetley's a try. Its not my thing, and I wont be having this beer again. To me - average, straight down the line."
"D - I'm going to go ahead and assume that Tetley's is probably better from the cask, cause this nitro can is really bland. At 3.8%, this is definitely intended for a session, but there's way better stuff out there. I don't think I'll be buying any more of this."
"A cheap and simple bitter from the Carlsberg group."
"I enjoyed Tetley's English Ale because it has a creamy taste without feeling like you drank a glass of milk."
"The ale lacks complexity and any fruit character so it is not a beer to excite me. I suppose its boring , without being offensive."
"At first I liked this but the more I tried it the less I was a fan. Typically, I don't mind nitrogen widget canned beers, but this just seemed to take away from the ale itself. I think it works for stouts, but here it just seemed to come up short."
"Review done from notes."
"Very smooth, creamy and easy to drink. Sugary sweet with a touch of butter and caramel. Toasted grains with a mini hop snap on the finish. As with any nitro can I've ever had, this has a good drinkability level that deserves to be noted."
"Overall, a solid offering for this style. It's very drinkable, but go for a Boddington's for a richer, more satisfying EPA."
"A very drinkable product, unbalanced acidic and burnt taste, and the almost chalky finish lingers a slightly burnt grapefruit flavor."
"Maybe I got a crap can but this stuff was crap. No carbonation what so ever. Tasted like lightly hopped tea with a sickenly sweet aftertaste. Terrible. Avoid."
"poured an explosive medium copper color with a slightly off-white blustery head that lasted throughout, Smell is hoppy with a touch of caramel. Taste is nice with toasted grains and a nice finishing dryness. Nice and easy to drink, but one is enough. Nothing special."
"I am convinced, If you put Coors Light on nitro, I'd probably like it! This one pours a standard yellow with a white haze from the nitro. Smells slight on all categories: malt, hop, yeast, vegetable. Tastes creamy malty sweet, albeit very light. Mild hops give a plesant souring effect. Body is creamy and a wee bit grainy. Finishes clean, crisp, and a little watery after the nitro disipates. Slight tones of diacety are present in the finish. Again, a good session beer that is easily drinkable."
" Appearance is amber with a nice foam that has some lace. Hops give a flowery and light aroma. Initial taste has both malt and hops, the hops predominate to the finish which is a little bitter. There is some diacetyl that coats the tongue and leaves a lingering impression of margarine. Interesting sensation."
"All in all a pretty run of the mill English Pale Ale. I'd like to think the nitrogen would have made this a more interesting brew but that's not to be the case this time."
"Good amount of malt for the style. Pairs well with the english hop bitterness. Clean hops in the finish. Nice light mouthfeel, good session beer."
"Thoroughly unimpressive."
"Truly a smooth ride that sticks just a bit; could session this all day long with no problem."
"After working your way through the cream on top, you have a smooth feeling liquid and light malty flavor in your mouth. This is a good, solid beer but it doesn't give you much flair. Very filling and great over conversation at the bar but if you want more than one, it seems like you want a lot of time to work on them."
"The taste was ok....i think here they undermine carbonation a bit. the taste is quite sweet although watery and seems to lack something despite it all. bitter? well just at the end but i'll take plenty IPAs or APAs if i actually want the bitter. this is just a decent, mild beer you could just find in any pub here."
"This is a nice, easy to drink mild English ale which is well-balanced and without imposing off-flavors that I tend to dislike in most English ales. Thank god, an English beer that doesn't taste like wet cardboard or butter! I like this one. Pleasantly surprised. I would drink this again. Would be great ice cold on a hot summer day in a lawn chair with a cool breeze. A plain and simple brew for plain and simple times."
"Fun to watch Pours thick and milky. Eventually clears to a copper with a thick foamy head. Taste is slightly sweet, but quickly becomes sour. Not sure if it is the hops or not. Slightly appley. Mouthfeel is nice and full, creamy finish. Nose is all malt. Easy enough to drink, but not sure I would get this one again."
"Pop the nitro can and hear the rush of the widget breaking. Pours a nice golden hue topped by a one-inch creamy white head that stays around for a while. Nice cascading. Slightly sweet aroma at first, but upon closer inspection there's a hint of sour, cheap adjunct malt. Not a whole lot of flavor, but what's there is a nice balance of mild hops and light malt. Body is a bit thin, with almost no carbonation. Decent, especially for the price."
"Pours into the glass as a opaque milky colored liquid which transforms into clear russet/amber liquid topped with a compact creamy ivory head. The nose is lighty fruity/candy-like sweet. The taste is bittersweet and somewhat fruity with a smooth creamy mouthfeel and good hop bitterness with a somewhat tea-like astringency which complements the fruitiness quite nicely. Finishes bittersweet and very easy to drink."
"i've been wanting to try this one for some time. this sample is from a nitro-can. color is a gold and copper. a nice creamy head. smell is a very nice balance of hops and malt. taste like so many other english pale ales, is very well balanced but the smooth malt flavor does linger over the hops. drinkability is awsome. when i first started digging into this 4-pack I was wondering if the ABV was around 4% because it was so easy to drink. but they say it's 5% and that makes me happy."
"Taste isnt offensive, just bland. Hard to detect anything but the malt. A pretty boring taste but it is smooth and goes down nice. A good quaffing beer."
"I wasn't sure what to expect from this one. Not much on the nose. A nice malty flavor that goes down very easily. Some buttery, lip smacking aftertaste. A nice sessionable brew, but not one I'd likely buy again. Well worth a try if you see it, but not my cup of tea...pardon the pun."
"Mouthfeel is thin, surprisingly thin. Drinkability is ok, nothing special."
"From a nitro can from the corner store. I found this to be pretty good for a cheap beer. The beer poured wigolden with a rich & creamy head, which made the mouthfeel wonderful. Very creamy in character. The aroma was only slightly malty, with some hops barely showing up in the taste. The mouthfeel makes up for it. One complaint is the chemical taste in the aftertaste - just not quite right there. Still, for a cheap session beer, I would take this any day, all day long."
"14.9 ounce widget-induced can. A swirling murky off-brown settles into a solid copper in hue, with a huge off-white capped head. Sweety aroma, some malts and fruit can be detected. A slick and thin mouthfeel with a quick shot of malts and some caramel backing; mild bitter hops in the back. Not much going on in the flavor department, bordering on average for the style. More than 1 of these in the can is probably too many for a setting."
"Pint nitro widget can. Poured an unusual but interesting tan - like coffee with loads of milk. Aroma was a bit sour. Flavor was, well, pretty much MIA. Just some vague, watery slightly sweet malt. I went through the entire glass trying to get enough flavor to make an indentification, but in the end my reaction was just ""blah."" This may be great stuff on tap, but it was certainly bland from the nitro can."
"this cracked open with a loud ""whoosh"" and after all the nitro cascading stuff it settled to a lovely deep copper with a huge thick biscuit like head. aroma is subdued, malty if anything. very creamy in the mouth, milkshake like. smooth as hell. flavorwise it is somewhat weak, caramel malts thumbwrestling with light bits of hops with a noticable metallic taste always present. not bad, but not impressive either. a ""small"" beer that is more than drinkable, mainly due to its awesome texture."
"This is a very tastey bitter, if a little comercial and lacking in hops. Id recommend it."
"Quite surprised to find this at a local hole in the wall type bar. Appearance was typical of other nitro injected ""pub ales"". Cascading aggressively to form a creamy head. Hue was a pleasant copper. Smell is one of the weaker aspects of this beer. Everything was really muted but there a little bit of malt does linger. Taste had nice notes of pine and hay followed by a sweet caramel finish. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both obviously high. I actually enjoyed this quite a bit more than I do Boddington's. Unquestionably this was a great find in a pretty beer deprived city."
"This beer isn't particularly stunning in any category, but decently balanced overall, making it easy to drink as a session beer."
"A bright clean dark golden beer. Has a rich spoonable creamy off white head that leaves anice lace. I always have a hard time getting any aroma out of any nitro beer, the head is so thick it hard to pick up much through it. I did manage to get a light sweetness in the aroma. The taste starts out with a good bitterness followed by a light applely sweetness. The finish is a nicely balanced hop finish that has an almost tea like character."
"Taste: Creamy, smooth mouthfeel, watery a the end. Slightly bitter with some honey. the bitterness stays until the end and sticks around just for a bit."
"Fortunately, it was a gift."
"Can: Poured a light clear brown ale with just above average head with medium retention. Aroma is light bitter with some malt in the back. Taste is quite weak with some bitterness but also a watery feeling that was quite a letdown. Probably below your average English bitter."
"Consumed from the 16oz nitro-can with widget. Poured just as I expected. Full head with decent lace. A beautiful butterscotch color. Didn't have much nose to it. A bit of a bitter smell. Tasted a bit bland, with a bitter aftertaste. Pretty easy to drink and went down very smooth. A decent beer, but would like to try it on tap to compare."
"The colour's kind of a light gold and brown. Sort of looks like it could be tea. Nice head which lasted. Lace? This beer doesn't lace, it coats the glass like paint. Sadly, this is where the positive attributes end. The smells bland. Bit sweet and weak. Taste is boring. A pathetic malt presence followed by a nutrasweet aftertaste. Mouthfeel is thin and watery. I have three cans left, and I think I'll be giving them away. Swill."
"Smells a bit like wet tobacco, but not horribly. Pours nice, pretty stadard nitro can look. Color is a dark orange/brown. Head is creamy and lasting, but thats were every bit of carbonation went. Mouth feel is flat and syrupy, get really thin at the end, kinda like old keg beer. Taste is pretty bitter, and a little sour. Slighly sweet and malty, but mostly just bitter. Doens't go down very easy. Finnish before it gets warm. Wouldn't be bad with a dry pot roast I guess, but I doubt I'll ever go here again. Looks much better than it really is."
"14.9 oz can,with no freshness dating. Pours w/ a widget supplying a great creamy,bubbly show in the glass. What results is a very smooth,soft,creamy light British style ale. Light chestnut in color. White, well developed head, some sticky lacing. Not much nose. malty, medium bodied. long malty finish, lightly hopped. Very pleasant and clean session brew."
"#12 at Fort York Beer Fest 2004. Nothing special here. Creamy head on dark tea-like body. Rather still and watery-thin mouthfeel. Faint citrus. Not much carbonation, but i am not tempted to try the nitro-can. Smooth, no aftertaste to speak of, boring."
"The beer after its emancipation from the nitro can pours a somewhat hazy yellow with a creamy bright white head and a thick sheet of lace to obfuscate the glass. Nose is sweet malt and has a hint of yeast, earthy I guess is a good term, start is rich in malt, lightly sweet and the top a bit thin. Light carbonation with a delicate hop presence, quite dry aftertaste, a drinkable brew, but I prefer these beers from cask or tap, something just seems lost in the translation."
"on the lid of the can it says ""serve cold", maybe that would help to cut the sourness."
"Creamy base with some mid palate bitterness. Good malty flavour which suffers to the lack of length. Love the creaminess of nitro cans, but the length really does let it down. Not overly strong, but not underdone either, this is very easy to drink."
"I find myself without much to say about Tetley's English Ale since it's so simple and straightforward. That's not a knock though, because I do like the bold flavor and the easy drinkability. Unchallenging, but oh so enjoyable. That just about sums it up."
"Drinkability is decent but certainly nothing spectacular."
"The aroma is malty with strong milky maltose notes. The smell reminds me of warm out-of-the-oven caramels. Nearly no hop spice. The taste mimics the aroma: rich and creamy malt except the aftertaste draws out distinctly British hops that couldn't be detected in the nose. Even though this is highly carbonated, the bubbles are extremely fine making for an excellent texture."
"Extremely smooth due to nitro, with an excellent herbal/floral flavor imparted by the hops. There are some malt characteristics, but the hops prevail in this one, but in a muted, pleasant sort of way. Would make an excellent session beer."
"Presentation is an imperial pint glass, with an excellent 3/4"" super-dense nitro head over the amber-hued brew. Laced excellently with foam coated the glass sides from top to bottom at the end of the drinking experience. Aroma is minimal, just some slight malts apparent. Taste was balanced well, but somewhat low in intensity. Mouthfeel and drinkability enhanced by the smoothness of the nitro presentation."
"The beer pours an amber color with a thick creamy white head; very nice. The aroma is good. It has a nice light malt scent to it. It boasts mainly of pale malts, but there are also some light crystal malts present. It has a slight bitter aroma. The taste is good. It has a thick creamy malty flavor. It goes down with ease and finishes smooth. The mouthfeel is great. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking beer. It usually don't care for these pub ales, but this one is exceptional."
"Pours a dark reddish amber. Nitro can creates a great looking smooth head which lasts and sticks to the sides of the glass very well. Smell is sweet like candy. Also a little fruity with a nice english hop aroma. Taste is light overall with a good malt base. Noticeable diacetyl flavor right away. A complex fruitiness to this brew with a solid hop bitterness that comes through in the end. Dark roasted malt aftertaste. Grassy and leafy notes pull through as well. Silky smooth mouthfeel but a little on the thin side."
"I have to say, there's nothing here not to like, but it falls short slightly in the crucial aroma and flavor arenas. It's so smooth and creamy that you want to give it higher marks for those benchmarks, but objectivity prevents me from doing so. It goes down like a dream, and I could and would drink more in a sitting, but it's not going to be the first beer I reach for at the end of my day. It's simple and tasty, and for what it's worth, it's alright with me. It's just not more than that."
"Definitely a beer I coul drink several of."
"A good session ale but there are better ones in a can."
"No need to getting into how a nitro can is poured... creamy beige colored foam atop an amber to copper colored brew. Aromas of floral hops, hard water, and faint crystal malt. Smooth transition on the palate from diluted malt to organic mellowed hop astringency. Minerally tasting, in it's weakness. Rather quaffable (with a sidenote that I typically don't enjoy N2 beers as much as their CO2 counterparts). This beer has a good English feel to it, but leaves the overall experience rather lacking. I didn't actually know that it was contracted to Carlsberg."
"I was very impressed by this beer. I believe I had it once before when I conquered England (part of a 100 beer club experience). At any rate, the beer pours a smooth golden brown color. It has a thick, rich head. The smell was weak, but unoffensive. A slight scent of the malts invovled in this beer, but otherwise scentless. It was delicious and smooth to drink too. It fills the mouth with a creamy, malty wonderment (oh yeh, I said wonderment) and leaves with just a tinge of balancing bitter. I could drink this beer over and over...assuming I could afford to do so."
"This beer is the definition of ""average"". Though featuring no particular off tastes, the nitro also wipes out much of any other tastes, so it's neither good nor bad, but simply average. I'd definitely love to give a non-nitro a try."
"This is a pretty nice beer, but there is always room for improvment. I'd like to try this on tap, and I can imagine paring this with some NY strip steaks or fried seafood. The bitterness was a bit surprising, but the beer ends up being a pretty drinkable offering."
"A nutty brown attack which fades a bit to a clean finish. There's a thin hop-tea mouthfeel that is not bold enough for the style, and the hop-tea quality of the bittering is also less than stellar. But the mildness makes it overall very drinkable when you might want something British-mild in character. Recommended for warm days and football games, but only when on the couch. Tetley's would not survive the frozen tundra...."
"Hey, Tetley's what's up?! Where's the taste?! Very disappointed but at least I have a floating widget!?"
"there are plenty better tasting and more complex english ales than this, but if youre looking for a beer than can sustain you adequately till the early hours, especially when youre up for a biggun, this is a top beer for the occasion. it wont pop your cork, but itll hang tough when the going gets ruff."
"This is a most wonderful brew! The mere appearance of this stuff is fantastic, pouring at first with about the clarity and colour of brown gravy. The immensly thick ""tight"" head (almost no bubbles, just cream) was nearly as good as the ale itself. The smell was about typical for this style which is unparalelled by any other style of brew in my personal opinion. As you drink this truly exeptional liquid, the thick, creamy head leaves a most lovely lace, which is so thick, one would hesitate to call it a lacing at all. Coating, perhaps, more closley describes it. The taste is quite strong of malt, with a faint hint of banana on the finish. The mouthfeel is near heavanly, aswell. It's quite lightweight and goes down smooth and easy. I don't know why I even bother with so many other styles of brew. This style, and this one in particular, are truly marvelous."
"A good English bitter. Not a complicated one, but wholesome - a very balanced flavour - just the quintessential bitter. In some parts of England unblessed with good large local breweries (i.e. Liverpool), I have seen this cherished by good pub landlords, and always excellently presented. However, in other towns, it has to play second fiddle to the likes of Marstons Pedigree, Samuel Smiths, etc."
"Widget can - Medium brown color, medium head. A medium bodied brown ale. Light malts and hops. Slightly sweet malts and slightly hoppy. Mouthfeel is a little thin. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. There is an off flavor to this beer that makes it undrinkable."
"Really bad, especially for a cask bitter. I'd been avoiding this for a while, but finally decided to give it a go the other night. Citrus, caramel and grain, rank bitterness, thin, can't say too much more about it. Thank god i had it on cask, i don't think i could have sat through a 500ml can of this."
"Poured from a 440 ml nitro can, 4.4% abv. This is a very appealing looking ale, a very clear light amber/butterscotch colour, massive creamy head which lasts the ride down the glass, leaving some impressive lacing. Nose is full of sweet malt, slight toffee, ripe starchy fruit, and a hint of floral hops. Flavour is quite balanced, the sweet malt blends right into a mild hop finish, with some weird alchemical event occuring between them that I can't seem to peg. It's spicy but it isn't, and it's fruity, but it isn't. There and gone before you know it. Mouthfeel is more watery than I had anticipated from such an intense head, but it goes down very easy all the same."
"I had this at a British-style pub in Moscow. It came in the appropriate pint glass with a Tetley's logo. It was a deep reddish amber under an off-white head that stood the test of time well and left some very nice lace patterns down the side. The nose was a bit on the sweet side, while the mouth was flat, smooth and sweet - as it should be, but not awesomely good. The taste was smooth and creamy, with sweet malts and a nice bitter finish. For someone starved of ales in this lager drenched land, it was a refreshing change."
"Had this one on-tap at the Plough and Stars in Cambridge, MA, nitro tap. Pours a very nice amber color with a very creamy head. Smells hoppy and light. Taste is extremely smooth and creamy somewhat watery with a sharp hop bite but tempered by some malts which make this quite drinkable. Head clings and coats the entire side of the glass all the way to the finish. Very nice. More hop presence as the beer warms."
"Nuts, cream, caramel and butterscotch are the flavors. No bubblegum or metal or banana...well, maybe butter-fried bananas with brown sugar and burning brandy...spanish coffee...not sweet though. Boiled hops must be helping to keep this dry, but they are distant. Quite roasty on the finish. Mmmm."
"The taste is definitely faint, but the beer is very drinkable. Only question is, why should I buy it at $8/4 pack when it doesn't rock my socks off? Probably shouldn't, and probably won't."
"This is the second nitro-canned English ale I've had recently (along with Boddington's). I have to admit, although it's clearly a gimmick (and the beer is extraordinarily watery), I kind of like this stuff. It gives you the refreshing feel of drinking beer from a keg or tap (as is intended), but you get some taste and bitterness that you don't find in a lager. I would love to try the real thing, like Fuller's, on tap in England. These are not beers I will drink that often, but in Florida in August, I find it quite refreshing. I would much rather have this than one of the macros."
"The taste has a short malty start and finishes to the hops but seems a little flat despite all the glass actions."
"I kind of liked this beer. Nice caramelly malt supports a nice little bite of hops that makes this quite quaffable. There's a bit of melon-like fruitiness that keeps things interesting. I'm not big on nitro dispensed beers, but you do have to admit that they make for gorgeous beers. The big soapy head on top of the copper body was quite the sight."
"Not a bad brew, but certainely nothing to get excited about. Actually a bit blah. A beer I would get once a year only. pat"
"Thx"
"Poured a honey amber with a thick creamy head that you could float a quarter on. Well, I didn't try to actually float a quarter on it, but I'm pretty sure you could if you tried. The smell was malty with a hint of hops at the end. The taste is caramel smooth at the beginning, but the hops comes up and kicks that out of the way like a hounddog off the front porch. Far from overpowering, just lightly assertive and demanding of your attention. The battle for the tip of your tongue is over very quickly. Quite drinkable, this beer disappear from my glass very quickly."
"Monstrously large creamy, cascading head tops a clear copper body. Quite lovely looking. Aroma is weak malt. Body is luxuriously creamy -- almost too much so. Flavor is dominated by a mildly toasty malt, a bit nutty in flavor, with a very restrained bitterness. Struck me as more of a cream ale than a bitter -- too creamy and not enough bite. But this lack of complexity doesn't really affect the drinkability. A pint of this was gone before I knew it!"
"For being so unremarkable, it was a really good rink. Very creamy, very light, yet oddly toasty. Smooth, not much of a finish. It is enjoyable, but I will admitt for no appearant reason. Enjoy, is it s a fun drink. The pub can is a good run, howevere I have never seen it on tap, so maybe if you get that it might be a wee bit different, enjoy"
"It looks like a french vanilla milkshake when first poured. Then as the cascading settles, you're left with a darker shade of amber and the expected nitro head. There's not much of an aroma, nitro and some toastiness. It's very smooth and creamy on the palate, highly drinkable. Sweetness hits first with touched of nuttiness and toastiness. Then some hops kick in for a dry finish. Not a bad beer and not a great beer either. The hop kick in the end if what makes it a little interesting."
"i would recommend this to anyone, anytime. it's one of the best english bitter ales i've ever tasted."
"Amber with a nice creamy white head. Gotta love that nitro! This is leaps and bounds better than Boddington's in my opinion. Oh so very smoooooth. Toasty malt and a touch of fruity balanced by a touch of hops. Goes down very easy. I could drink this all night long."
"On draught at Mac's Cafe in Columbus. Darker amber color with a medium thin and creamy white head. Nice lacing. Aroma is lightly malty with a faint roasted quality. Flavor is very smooth, consisting mostly of malt, but there is a little caramel hanging in there as well. Finish is lightly bitter hops. Decent, but nothing great."
"I liked this beer a lot..will drink this more often will go down well with a nice dinner..not to heavy and not too light."
"Definetly not your typical english style brew. I was not very impressed by this beer 1st time I tried it. It did go down rather smooth and I didn't only have one, you never can. The taste was slightly bland. I thought it left a bad after taste in my mouth that I could've done without but it was prbably because of the can. It pours rather nicely into a pint and leaves a nice head, clears up to a smooth amber color. Very nice appearance. I won't turn this beer down if its offered to me but I won't go out of my way to buy it again."
"Avoid at all costs unless the bar only serves pretend Lagers in an English bar !!!"
"Medium amber color, huge white head, toasted malt aroma. Toasted malt flavor up front, then the hops takes over, finishing with a sharp bitter hops aftertaste with the malt hanging in the background."
"The off-white nitro head settles fairly quickly atop a very nice (and clear) amber body. It holds exceptionally well and leaves sheets of lace with rims that indicate the level of each sip. An excellent appearance! The aroma is bold with lots of ripe fruit and a richly nutty & caramel maltiness as well as a light touch of butter. The body is medium with an exceptionally fine carbonation that leaves it quite creamy and silky smooth in the mouth. The flavor is surprisingly full starting with light buttery toffee/ caramel / nutty maltiness, revealing some fruit towards the swallow, and finishing with a powdery dryness that lingers. Very well balanced. This is an excellent ale to enjoy at the pub as it is, but I'd really love to try this without the nitrogenation as I suspect it may be softening the overall impression of the beer, and particuarily the bitterness."
"This beer is a bit of a mixed bag for me.  I love the way it looks... copper with a majestic foam on top.  The nitro definately makes this beer look great.  Otherwise, it's a pretty average ale.  Slight notes of butterscotch and floral esters, with a bit of a bitter hops finish.  This is one very smooth beer, but maybe slightly thin.  I don't mind putting a few of these back though.  Very easy to drink when I'm not wanting something to challenge me."
"my first impression was that it was surprisingly bitter for a beer that advertises ""creamy and smooth"".  After I got over that  I found a decent beer, however not quite on par with Boddington's or Kilkenny.  The colour is auburn (tetley's tea, anyone?), with a creamy head.  The taste, as I mentioned, begins bitter then smooths towards the finish.  A good brew, but it would probably lose out to the aforementioned favourites when I pulled out my wallet."
"One of my local brit pubs here in Oregon has this on draught. It takes a while to pour, and comes out with a beautiful creamy head. While it initially looks a bit daunting, particularly with mood lighting, it is a very smooth ride. This was the perfect companion to enjoy with the World Cup, as it goes down effortlessly (nothing to detract from the action). The malty flavor is quite mild. Very drinkable."
"Tetley's has a Copper-Golden Color with a thick, dense tan head.  Sweeter than I expected, and much less hoppy.  I perceived butterscotch and nuts, but the flavors seemed right at home, and not flaws. It was better than I expected."
"You really can't go wrong with this one- that is if you like creamy English ales.  The nitro can produced a nice creamy head, cascading down the glass.  Somewhat sweet, yet with a bit of bitterness that keeps the ale honest.  The flavor was tempered, but this is the style.  Some nut flavor also present , but after a few sips, you just focus on the smoothness.  One could drink many of these."
"Tetley’s English Pub Ale: From the tap.  Beautiful bronze color, a rich dense head, very cloudy.  The aroma reminded me of a Belgian dubbel, with bananas, and yeast.  The taste was initially very similar to a Belgian like Duvel, but as it warmed up it became much more like a rich sweet cider.  Had a sweet aftertaste, very nice."
"Thick and rich. Clear amber in color with thick meranguie like head.  Trace of toasted malt in aroma. Tastes smooth and rich almost like a milkshake.  Slighlty sweet with fruit like quality. Finishes clean with a toasted nut like aftertaste."
"Bit more malt flavour than I expected, hops are quite impressive also. This ale is really starting to grow on me, odd because I am not too fond of the canned nitro type."
"I really enjoy these widget beers, a real nice change of pace in terms of the drinkability of regular bottled beers, although I wouldn't always want beer in this cream-style, quite nice when I am in the mood. Gotta bang down at least 2 of these at a sitting."
"Classic ordinary bitter, smooth and easy to drink. Not bad, but you're likely to want something more substantial after a couple of these."
"Didn't care for it. I think that the hop and malt pairing was just a little weird. I know this is suppose to be English style draft (read low carbonation) but these wigets leave a great head and too little carbonation in the beer. Tried it, didn't like it, now I can move on."
"This is Tetley's export only product. They also produce an export only nitro keg version."
