"Easy drinking ale. Amber color and slightly bitter like a true English ale."
"Overall-Run of the mill ale to me, I love the packaging but that was the best part of the experience."

"O- My introduction to Ipswich, and I'm very much looking forward to trying the other three in the variety pack! Great stuff. Reminds me a bit of Brooklyn Pennant Ale."
""

"O: I hate to be so blunt, but this beer sucked. Not sure if I got a bad batch or what, but there's a lot of cleaning up to be done here."

"O - If I had to compare this to something it would be more Finest Kind then Whales Tale Pale Ale. The appearance in particular was well out of the norm. I really enjoyed this beer and will be on the lookout for more varieties from Ipswich."
""
""
""
""
"Looking forward to drinking the other three from the variety twelvepack. A great value, by the way, since I paid only $11 for the twelver when it was on sale. A helluva buy for 92 cents a bottle."

"I drank a lot of this when I was first getting into beer. Years later, it's actually a bit different than I remember. It's way more complex. And it's very unique. From my experience, this is actually best on tap. This is definitely worth seeking out."
""
""
""
"pours a pale yellow. Thin white head, some lacing, cloudy/unfiltered. taste/aroma is a nice balance, english yeast, bread crust, biscuit, nutty, piney grassy hops. I'm guessing cascade hops. Some toffee too. Buttery/bready yeast flavors. Very rich body, full mouthfeel, high carbonation. Very solid brew."
""
""
""
""
"O: Not bad but not really my cup of tea. Very easy to drink but nothing really memorable however."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Light to medium bodied, plenty of carb, very nice. Overall, this is far from my favorite style, but it's a decent example. Worth a shot."
"This beer doesn't match the others I've had in this category, so definitely worth a visit."
""
""
""
"The beer was served in 12oz pint glass and appeared a nice, bright, and clear amber color with a nice slightly off-white foamy head that was well retained that ultimately settled into a thin cap that lasted throughout the beer. The aroma is malty, as expected from the style, with some hop presence, but the aroma is pretty well balanced, again as expected for the style. The taste follows the nose well, a nice toasted malt flavor with a hint of yeast and some earthy hops. The combination worked very well together. The beer had a nice feel to it and was exceptionally smooth and easy to drink. Overall, a good beer and one that I would definitely drink again."

"Taste is dry, bittersweet character with nutty-caramelly toasty malt & peppery-woody hop bitterness. It has light juicy zesty yeastiness. It is very good, with nicely rounded character."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours a nice clear amber with an average off-white head. Malty aroma is a little fruity and a little yeasty, promising if not outstanding. Flavor is mainly malty with some fruit and a hoppy-bitter undertone. Not too shabby. Smooth texture has about average body and fizz. Overall, fair to middlinâ€™."
"Superbly drinkable- light to medium body with very good carbonation. In general this is not my type of pale ale- I like the bolder American variety and if I want more malt I'll go for a kolsch or a munich helles. Definitely good stuff for the price though."

"O: Great session beer. The toasted malt flavor was excellent and this ale was very smooth. I liked it slightly more than the DPA."
""
""
""

"Overall: This beer fits well with the EPA style. Will have more in the future."

"Overall: This beer fits the English Style Pale Ale style very well. The beer had a very inviting appearance, attractive smell, and full flavor. All properties of this brew seemed to work together very well."
"Poured from a cask and served in a 20 oz tumbler, the beer is a hazy, unfiltered, honey-brown coloring with a dense, foamy, frothy, off-white head of about an inch. Aromas are a nice, subtle blend of citrus and hops on a sweet toffee backbone. Flavors have a good roasted quality to them, with a resiny and bitter hopping that balances the toffee and caramel sweetness from the malt profiles. Citrus influence is light, with a lemon zest flavor peeking out here and there. Good use of wet hops to clean the palate and impart some strong, peppery characters without being overly bitter. The beer leaves a decent lacing along the glass, and the body is smooth and light. The lack of carbonation from the cask permits all the flavors to truly blend together. The aftertaste is tangy and bitter hops, with a slight, drying finish. Decent brew."
""
"Overall, this was a good ale. Fairly well-balanced with good flavor and very easy to drink. Doesn't push boundaries or blow my mind, but my guess is that's not the intent. Solid beer."
"Overall: I've always enjoyed this beer very much; makes a great seesion beer. The balance of base ingredients and adjuncts is outstanding. Has never failed to satisfy. Mercury knows its #*!* Try their oatmeal stout."
"Overall: Simple and easy-going, but pleasant overall. Refreshing."
""

"Poured a 1"" off-white head. Body is an interesting raw sienna yellow color with a slight haze. Smells of malt and caramel. Taste doesn't quite match the smell, it's more standard BMC with a little malt, and definitely more bitter hops coming through in the finish. It's OK, I just don't think it stands out much higher than upper average."
""
"Reminds me alot of Berkshire's English IPAs but with a big emphasis on the malts. Not much to it but a good, authentic English ale from the states."

"D: This one is excellent, lower ABV for huge flavor, simply great."
"This is an enjoyable beer. Of all parts of the US, it seems the New England breweries mimic British styles the best, and this one doesn't disappoint."
"This is a crisp yummy beer that allows you to imagine yourself sitting on the Cape and sipping away while your thoughts float to brisk summer days. Okay, enough imagery. This ale is surprisingly refreshing, pours a little light without much head, but makes up for appearance in taste."
"Overall, this is a lovely pale ale, being largely well-balanced, with a slight emphasis on a citrus tang. The brew doesn't necessarily bring anything new to the table for the style, but it does prove an excellent example of it, and is worth a taste."
"Slight amount of haze in an brownish orange. Almost no head just a small puddle floating around. Nose contains a lot of malty bread, some small amounts of toast. Fruity hop character. The balance between rich malty bread and fruity hops seems off. A large amount of malt and toasty bread with some slight hop character. Hops were present more in the nose. Bready malts transition to a metallic tang and some bitterness that cloys at the back of your throat. Scratchy and tangy bitter, old fruits."
"O/D-Have always loved Ipswich IPA. I may like this one a bit more. It is definitely a more apt 12 pack beer than the IPA. The mild yet attractive flavor makes you yearn for another bottle. I think this might be my 'go-to' 12-pack brew when I'm not feeling like burning the enamel off my teeth with some good ol' 'Finest Kind' by Smuttynose. Sessionable, local, and pretty damn addictive. Not bad Mercury Brew Co."
"Really like this beer, and it doesn't break the bank."
"overall a delightful beer true to style the food pairings are endless."
"Pours amnce two fingers worth of creamy white head. Crystal clear pale golden color. The most sticky lacing I've seen in a while remains half way through the glass. Smells slightly floral and some Carmel malts, maybe some bready yeast. Tastes sweet,carmel, earthy hops, medium bitterness to balance it. Light body, medium carbonation. The finish is neutral and watery tasting. Overall this is lackluster to me."
"O= session forever, should go great with most red-meat or fowl meals, probably even nice with pasta."
"I'm glad I've got a sixtel of this in the bar room"
"An assertive bitterness from earthy hops jumps to the front of the palate. It is followed by some impressive fruitiness, toasty malts, and then a well-rounded caramel character. The beer is nicely carbonated, and it really is pleasant on the palate. Overall, this is one of my more favorite English-style offerings, and if there are more like this, I am definitely looking forward to more."
"M- Lively carbonation, dry and crisp."
"Drinkability: I would have no problem purchasing this beer again in the future. Nor will I have any difficulty in finishing the rest of the supply I have now. A Very nice beer overall."
"The feel of this beer is medium but is a full medium body with lots to think about. There is a smoothness that engulfs this beer as it goes down and then smack of the hops. It's like sliding down a slide and hitting the flat end."
"Drinkability is ok. Crisp and clean enough with a low enough ABV for multiple pints but the flavors aren't really interesting enough to stop you from reaching for something else."
"Very good drinkability, I wouldn't turn another one down."
"Also if you like this beer, I implore you give the Goose Island ""Honker"" a shot. Delicious in very similar ways."
"D: Goes down easily, tasty, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style. This is a decent English Pale that is worth sitting with for a while."
"grapefruit citrus hop flavor, particularly at the finish. sufficient sweetness to keep up with the hops, but actually a dry finish. hop flavor is robust but bitterness subdued. a very complete flavor profile with a nice easy mouthfeel."
"i'm surprised at how much i enjoyed this. not something i'd buy again, but i definitely wouldn't turn one down."
"I whole heartedly agree with the Bros, this ale is world class."
"mouthfeel is medium and appropriate for style. drinkability is off the charts with this going down very easily. very satisfying"
"I want to have another go at this one under better conditions. Maybe if I had sat at the bah."
"Overall: A pleasant surprise, for sure. Never heard much about this brewery even though it is right up the road. I'll seek this one out again for sure, especially for any winter time get-togethers."
"drinks well. nothing wows me, but its a solid beer."
"Pours a hazy orange with a fluffy head. A waft of hops floats from the glass, and the aroma is clean and bready with a nice hop floweriness. The flavor has very light caramel and a cloverlike floweriness and some honey. The finish, however, is thin and suggests an extract brew. There is a tight bitterness at the end. The mouthfeel is clingy and aspriny dry."
"12oz. bottle served in a standard pint glass. Poured a hazy, dull burnt orange with a frothy, two inch off-white head that eventually settles into a solid, half inch cap. Some strands of lacing, but no legs. Nose reveals toasted malt, a slightly nutty quality and a little bit of citrus towards the back. Characteristics in the nose also present in the flavor profile; however, a bit watered down - also, the slightest suggestion of bittering hops expresses itself lightly at the finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a light carbonation. Simple and quaffable. A pretty solid English Pale Ale. I bet this would be excellent on cask."
"D: A great English pale and easy to turn it into as session at 5.4% ABV. Amidst the sea of English pales on the American market, this one honestly stands out and would replace the Otter Creeks and Some of the Berkshire offerings we see here in CT as a regular fix."
"Notes: This is a nicely balanced beer to be enjoyed anytime of year. One of the more underated beers. Cheers"
"Medium bodied and above average carbonation. The flavor makes the beer. Sweet malts with hint of toastyness. Citrus Hops come through nicely and perfectly balance this Pale Ale. Finishes a little dry. Bigger flavor than most in this style, well balanced, refreshing and drinkable."
"Cheers!!!"
"Very nice. I'm surprised I haven't noticed before that this really is a nice brew."
"This is another winner from Ipswich. I am so glad I picked up the variety pack. If you see this grab it. Doesn't seem to be plentiful around where I live, but really good stuff. I could get into this anytime, but with summer just around the corner, I am thinking that this will make its way with me on vacation."
"Nice pour, dark brown-amber, small amount of foam, tasted along the lines of an IPA but less hoppy and darker, I liked it for a change of pace, has a nice tangy bite to it, but not over the top, rich, but not anything close to a porter. Overall satisfying , probably best for a fall beer in early september I think I will get a twelver. Full body/flavored, hit it right on the head, don't need to change a thing."
"Overall, I'd consider this a fantastic ale - maybe a little heavy for a true session brew but definitely a good addition to the opening line-up."
"D - Quite drinkable, this beer displays all of the hallmarks of its style, especially with its rich malt flavor and strong hoppy finish. The sharp, chalky bitterness and musty/spicy hop flavors are particularly well done. It is very sessionable and I imagine it would be particularly nice on cask."
"The mouthfeel is on the light side of medium and there is lots of carbonation. This is VERY drinkable. I could easily have a few of these without seeking out a new flavor for my palate"
"The beer pours a slightly murky orangish-brown with a white head. The aroma is wet grass with some citrus. The flavor is grass, citrus, iced tea and medium bitterness. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. An enjoyable English IPA."
"This beer is incredibly drinkable. The malt and hops are in perfect balance for me. I'm not too much of a hop-head (Ipswich IPA is actually a little too hoppy for my taste) and it's really nice to have such a smooth drinking Pale Ale that doesn't overpower with sweetness or bitterness. I think Mercury Brewing Company hit the nail on the head with this brew - the perfect go-to beer for any weekend when you want a smooth drinking, flavorful full bodied craft beer that doesn't wear you out after one or two drinks."
"Poured amber/copper into a pint glass, with one finger of white head, and spotty lacing. Smelled very malty, caramel'ish, and earthy; surprisingly not much fruitiness to speak of. However, the taste was in fact more revealing; malty sweetness gives way to apple/plum, and then to a fairly balanced finish. The beer did maintain good flavor as it warmed to room temperature. the mouthfeel was fuller than expected; with the head imparting a little creaminess. Drinkability was certainly apparent, but it may have been just a tad on the thick side for me to session more than a couple of pints."
"I had this one on tap at an Applebee's restaurant on January 20, 2010. It pours a slightly cloudy looking amber-copper with about a finger of long-lasting foamy cream colored head. The aroma is a bit malty with a dash of swet caramel and toffee in the mix. The body is in the medium range with a taste that draws out the hops in a subtle but pleasing way. It ends dry. It was nice to have this available at a chain restaurant."
"This beer is great. Do not pass up an opportunity to have it!"
"Very drinkable, refreshing but not filling. Altogether, what I consider a ""polite"" pale ale, using bitter hops and pretty flavorful honey malts, but subdued and unobtrusive. Figured I'd try a different local brew while I'm visiting Boston, and it was a good move in my opinion. Got to try a few other from this brewery later."
"Overall very delicious; excellent sweet malt profile, very nice hop character. Very, very drinkable."
"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a Unibroue tulip. White head reduces pretty quickly, really no lacing to speak of. Aroma is of mild hops, moderate malt and some citrus with a touch of spice. Taste is very dry and smooth with a mild hop bitterness and extremely pleasing on the palate. Took me a while to drink because I was busy stuffing my face with breakfast and the beer was allowed time to warm and still tasted great warm (sign of a good ale). Paired very well with my French toast, bacon and sausage late night breakfast."
"D-- Nice beer. This is a good ale and fairly complex and does have good character. Could do 2 of these easily."
"M and D: Somewhat aggressive carbonation, but a nice medium body make this pleasant to drink."
"BOTMC the gift that keeps giving.... This brew smells like a earthy ale a slight molasses smell with earthy hop undertones. Pours into my pint glass with a nice foamy two finger head. Color is a slightly hazy orange bronze. Head stands nicely. Taste is sweet and malty with some caramel. Hops kick in quickly with citrusy, grapefruity flavor and a sharp bite. Balanced and delicious. Mouthfeel is very good, good fizz but not overpowering. Nice lacing on the glass as it empties. This is a staple brew. Very good and a sessioner without a doubt."
"Probably my least favorite of the mixed 12 pack but still a pretty good beer none the less. I knew right when I tasted this is was an ""English"" pale ale.. just has that sort of fruity taste to it and isn't as hop forward and bitter as the Americanized version of the style. Nothing off putting just not my particular sort of taste. Definitely still a solid beer and a nice session beer, but the other beers in the mixed pack are just really good."
"Pours a cloudy golden orange color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy off-white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, very slight hop note, with some caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, slightly bitter, with some caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, not a bad little brew, thanks Chuck."
"D: Rich, complex malt flavor but easy drinkability. Very flavorful and exciting to have such a wonderful drinking ale. It is refreshing as well and will satisfy those who are more of a maltster. It is worth seeking this one out."
"Nice nose - a tight, dryish malt package, surrounded by a strong echo of whiskey and a general booziness that makes you pay attention. Powerful, yet cleanly built. These big notes don't correlate completely with a mouthfeel that is slight, watery on the edges. The carbonation though is a great asset, as the beer opens with some clean metallic notes, dry biscuit maltiness, then recedes into a softer, floral hop presence that swims throughout the finish. Just a hint of filmy earthiness lingers on the top of my mouth to remind me of the style. I find this highly drinkable and a well packaged version of the classic IPA."
"Don't drink and review."
"Medium amber with a bit of cloudiness from loose sediment. A thin beige cap appeared after the pour, a combination of fine and soapy bubbles. Sticky lace, good head retention. Light citrus aroma (grapefruit and tangerine) with some caramel maltiness. Moderate bitterness, slightly sharp up front, grapefruit with a hint of resin. Malt sweetness was mostly caramel with a bit of biscuit. Medium to light bodied, average carbonation, slight dryness, nice texture. Easy drinking and enjoyable."
"Final Thoughts: It starts with lots of malts and finishes with some light hops, the malts are done very well as it seems to layer and has a lot of earthiness, the light hops tease you on the finish almost as if it wants to get very hoppy but doesn't. This is very drinkable and has a lot of character. Reminds me of when I first had it years ago and loved it back then, even though my tastes have changed this seems to have stayed very tasty."
"This is one superb ale. Balance, balance and more balance! Nothing predominates here but you get a good mix of hops, malt and complex beer characteristics. Coffee, toffee, chocolate, backberry, citrus, caramel yummy! It is best in summer and fall but can really be drunk year round it is that good!"
"Poured into a nonic a hazed burnt orange with a great fluffy crown atop leaving multiple layers of lace as it settled slowly into a cramy mass,nice to see this is unfiltered.Mild aromas of herbal hop and caramel/biscuit malt.Flavors are also on the mild side staying more true to the intended style,leafy and herbal mixing with toffee and caramel/biscuit malt.iam not a huge fan of the subtle style but this is a nice quaffing EPA."
"Notes: An excellent brew with session appeal and easy enough to drink."
"D - very drinkable, I could have a lot of these if I wanted to"
"looks like the color of cloudy tea short head and a light lace. earthy aromas, white bread crust, slight fruity note. bready malt dry grainy taste lingering bitter tea after taste. medium mouthfeel with a aggressive carbontion. not a big fan of the style but tried to be as fair as possible."
"This is by far my favorite session beer."
"12oz bottle into a Corsendonk tulip pours a hazy orange with a nice thin off-white head that leaves decent lacing on the glass. Aroma was a decent amount of Earthy hops and sweet malts. The taste was a nice amount of sweet malts and crisp hops providing a nice balance. The beer is quite light and smooth with decent carbonation. This is a very enjoyable English Ale, one I could certainly see having again."
"This is a very good ale."
"A very unique American beer. True to the English style, very fruity aromas from the yeast with a mild toffee and caramel malt backbone. I thought the taste didn't live up to the hype of the aromas, but overall, this beer is incredibly smooth, clean and very sessionable."
"Some muted floral hops on the nose along with a bit of caramel malts, opening up later as the head diminishes. Smooth on the tongue initially with some buttery malts and finishing slightly bitter with a hop bite and a sense of cooked caramel. Bitterness is well balanced however and makes sense as I was unaware that this was a British Pale originally. Offers a good feel and drink given the balance and structure."
"Overall, I was not overly impressed by this offering, especially considering the other reviews I saw. The flavor was decent but not in balance. Perhaps I would enjoy this better on draft."
"D- Excellent, a perfectly balanced ale."
"Wonderful, fresh, delicious, eye-openingly good...you may not want to share! Definitely a step up from the bottle having this growler available...Not that the bottle is bad though. Ipswich is indeed one of the unsung local heroes in my book. Perhaps since they don't do much in the ""extreme"" area, their wonderful simple but near perfect ales simply speak for themselves. The pour is a nice bright orange-brown that darkens in the glass with an off-white 1 finger head & good lacing later. The aroma is simple: malt with hop & slight ginger-cinnamon. A nice, crisp bite and creamy head make this a pleasure!"
"Could easily drink a few of these. I guess the ABV puts it out of session range, but this is a decent, no frills ale that I can see spending an evening with."
"Although I've had this on tap and it was much fruitier, Ipswich Ale is one of the most enjoyable and unique pales around."
"The pour looked nice: clody, a light orange-amber color, a good-looking fluffy head with lace around the edges. The smell was crisp and clean: a combination of bready malts and some hop bitterness, plus honey, some fruit, and some yeast thrown into the mix. The beer had a big, malty, powerful taste that hit me with the first sip. It was bready up front, but the aftertaste had a mixture of bitter hops and sweet fruit. The beer was smooth and well-bodied, more so than a lot of other ales, with just the right amount of carbonation. This beer packs a big flavor, but doesn't feel too heavy. Delicious!"
"D: Easily drinkable would drink again and again."
"D: Hops balance out the malts up front well. Good easy drinking beer. Cleanses the palette well, the hop finish is long for such a sweet beer."
"Notes: This is a nicely balanced beer to be enjoyed anytime of year. One of the more underated beers. Cheers"
"A really nice beer. I usually am not very fond of this style; I prefer the APA. This one, however, was really well done. Perfect balance all the way around with a touch of fruitiness in the hops as well as a hunger stopping breadiness."
"Overall I was not very impressed with this beer after my first sip, but it definitely grew on me. This had a lot more flavor than Boddington's and a little more flavor than Fuller's. Give this one a shot."
"d - a pleasure to drink, won't get old, buy it and try it"
"D: Nice, good session ale."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a standard pint glass. The beer pours a hazy orange with a moderate white head. The beer does leave nice lacing. The aroma is of bread and faint hops. The flavor is slightly bitter up front and then the malt kicks in. The finish lingers and is pleasantly bitter. The beer is medium bodied and has moderate carbonation. The beer is highly drinkable and would accompany most food well."
"D: Gonna go pour another right now. I'll probably be drinking this all night."
"Thanks, donkeyrunner, for the opportunity to try this"
"The Original Ale pours rich and light brown and cloudy in the glass, with a nice head of foam that dissipates quickly and leaves lather-like lacing all the way down. The smell is instantly malt in the nose with a very pleasant fruity hops that subtley balances the whole. Taste is far more complex than I thought--a mix of the aforementioned malt and hops (fruity and piney and a bit of bitterness... more than expected but extremely welcome in the flavor matrix) with a touch of malty sweetness that, along with the subtle carbonation and rich body, renders this one a beer you can't easily put down (on the table that is). It's wonderful. I savored every sip. Easily as good as any Ale (English or APA) I've ever tried."
"12oz bottle obtained as part of a mix pack at Market Basket. Pours a hazy amber red with a thin film of off-white head. Smells fruity with toffee and caramel with some grassy tea-like English hops playing a strong role. Grassy tea-like hops hit first, with a fair bit of caramel hitting shortly thereafter. Medium in body with moderate carbonation. Very drinkable, perhaps one of the easiest to finish English Pale Ales I've had. Balanced, full flavored, not overpowering. Near perfect in every way. A solid choice."
"A very solid English style Pale."
"D: A nice big dry English style ale that was malty, dry and enjoyable."
"Decent carbonation in this one. Medium body but still very very drinkable. Easy to put good portion of a six pack down -- great for all seasons. A real winner."
"D- This is a session brew for sure. Enjoyable. Always great stuff from Ipswich."
"The Ipswich ales have been some of my favorite locals for a while now. Good to see an old friend in this one. Easy-drinking, sessionable offering. Good job."
"Had a pint while at lunch at the Sports Depot in Allston. Color was dark ruby red. Not much head though and no noticeable smell. Not as hoppy as most pale ales on the market. Hint of citrus to the taste. I mainly drink Ipswich Ale due to it's excellent drinkability. It's not the best PA out there, but it's a decent offering by a local brewer and it goes well with food. I could easily have a few of these in one sitting."
"Special thanks to Aaronjr123 (who doesn't post and is not very active on BA) for bringing this one back to me from his recent vacation to Boston."
"Pours cloudy amber with a short lived offwhite head. Smell is slightly tart, and lighty musty, earthy hops. Taste is fairly bitter with grassy hops coming in at first and it finishes a little sweeter with some caramel maltiness. Moderately full mouthfeel with nice carbonation. Much more bitter and hoppy than expected of an EPA. Pretty solid and drinkable. Thanks Joe!"
"Had on tap at the Moan and Dove. The beverage had a murky orange look to it with some good lacing and a thin head. Aromas were slightly honey-ish with malts and grains wrapping around the sweet smells. The drink was really sweet even with its earthy tones. Mouthfeel helped the drink from not being too overpowering. Overall, an enjoyable pale ale."
"Drinkability - The mix of smell, taste, and feel are a very nice combination. The beer is very drinkable. I would definitely order one when I was at the bar."
"Very nice beer for an English Pale."
" This is a ""local"" brew for me, being that this Brewery is not more than an hour away so for us in New Hampshire it's still really fresh."
"A solid beer with great drinkability. A great session beer."
"I haven't had this in awhile, and I don't know why. Ipswich is one of those beers that have been around awhile and are just taken for granted, and that's too bad. The downside to this beer was its appearance. It pours a nice hazy orange copper color but there is just no head to this beer to speak of. The smell is a little musty, a bit floral, and a nice indication of balance to come. The beer is fairly medium bodied, modestly carbonated, but I did wish it had more of a lasting head. The beer is very creamy on the tongue and enjoyable throughout. The taste is just so well balanced with a nice spicy hop bite in the finish. The beer is not too dry, not too sweet, and doesn't have any cloying syrupy consistency at all. There is some biscuity overtones, some bready malts, some florals, and then there is the spicy hop bite at the end that brings it all together. This is a really good beer worth seeking out, I just wish its appearance matched everything else. L'Chaim."
"12 oz. bottle with no freshness date; 30 IBUs. The beer is an unfiltered orangey copper, with medium carbonation and two fingers of foamy, light tan head that leaves a few wisps of lace. Not much in the way of aroma, but there are notes of malts and bitter, leafy hops. Apples and oranges are the first flavors to hit, but there are also flavorful malts, grapefruit, a big bitterness and some astringent notes. The body is medium, smooth and very dry, with apple skins lingering on the palate. Not too shabby - a tasty session brew that is hoppy without being too bitter."
"Nice to see Ipswich back in NJ. If you're a fan of traditional ale give this a try."
"Very balanced malt and hop mix. Very drinkable and well made beer."
"when it's on cask, why not give it a try? otherwise, pass..."
"Pours a nice red amber color with a nice thick tan colored head that laces very nicely. It smells of nice medium roasted malts witha nice earthy hop aroma that smells like a really good beer. It tastes of really rich malted grains followed by a crisp earthy hop bitterness that rounds out the flavor for a really good ale. The mouthfeel is great - nice and crisp with the right amount of carbonation which makes it a pretty drinkable beer. Definately worth it, try this if you can."
"Drinkability- Great! Easy to drink and I think it does well in all categories."
"Pours a totally clouded brown amber. Nose is like syrup and sweet. Flavor is meaty with some hop character, but not completely dominated by it. Overall it is mostly an earthy toned kind of beer. Feel is thick on the liquid and good on the bubble. Overall pretty drinkable. A bit thick and a touch of salt on the flavor are the only real detractors."
"Good beer, could drink these for a while. Nice balance."
"OK, pretty strong hops for style."
"A nice balanced beer with a decent head of foam. Copper/pumpkin like color. This was a real nice sipping beer. I had a growler of this for Thanksgiving, and just left it out on the back porch. It was about 48-50 degrees outside, so it was the perfect temperature for this beer (in my opinion). It tasted very fresh. I would buy this again."
"This is a fabulous beer. The balance of hops, fruit and malt is perfect in a hazy, yeasty brew. In its style it is the best I've had. I find it quite hoppy but it puts one-note hop bombs to shame. If you want hops more over the top, try Ipswich's IPA, but for my money this one's got everything."
"Pours a murky medium copper hue with a two finger white head that slowly dies down to a very nice creamy layer. Lacing is pretty good on the sides. Smell is an almost apple malt with a slightly pine hop odor. Taste is a metalic malt flavor with an earth hop sting. Some woody dirt hops and granny smith flavors towards the end. Mouthfeel is an almost medium body with a decent amount of carbonation. This brewery has surprised me with many of their beers, the oatmeal stout especially."
"D - Not my favorite style (I greatly prefer American Pales) but still has great potential as a session brew."
"12 fl. oz bottle, thanks to BA richgo6. Orange coloured beer, slightly hazy, with a huge off-white head. Nice hoppy aroma, very fruity. The flavour is also quite hoppy throughout, with resinous notes and some malty sweetness. Not bad at all. The style seems more American than English to me, though - but what do I know?"
"This is the second time I have had this beer in Bahston and I look forward to the third."
"A 12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Amber in color with a fairly thick head that retained well. Not a whole lot in the aroma, primarily sweet grain. Nice taste, malt, some subtle fruit, and some light hops. Very well put together, and quite easy to drink."
"Ipswich Original Ale pours orange amber with a white head. Aroma is very fruity with some caramel and toasted grain. Taste has the fruitiness for sure with a pleasant dried apricot note as well as caramel, toasted malt and a balancing bitterness that shows how well this beer is crafted. The hopping is dead on as it doesn't mask the fruitiness and makes this a regular in my fridge and at meal times. The freshness in the taste and aroma makes me think of freshly baked bread(apricot glazed brioche) and evokes the same mouth watering response. A pale ale that stands out in a craft beer scene flooded with mediocre pale ales. English ale inspired and perfectly excecuted this beer is a New England classic."
"This unfiltered pale ale poured a cloudy orange color with a solid off white head that is sustaining well. Nose is slightly malty with not much else to offer. Taste is very well balanced. This is a very malty pale with hints of sour apple. Hop bitterness is fairly light for the style but all elements pull together nicely. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and very smooth. Overall drinkability is very good. This is a very enjoyable beer that I am sure contribures nicely to a tailgate at Patriot home games!"
"An average drinker. Really glad that i had the opportunity to try it."
"Poured this ugly beer into a tumbler at 50 degrees. The color was a wierd cloudy orange with yeast, dirt or something floating around on the bottom. Nice head at first but then went away. Bready tasting with a yeasty smell and taste. Slighly hoppy and a little bitter. I will not buy again."
"It's going to ease your mind, not blow it."
"Peach colour base with little fizzy head. A very nice fruity pale, with good hop bitterness. Only the high carbonation detracted, though it was very fresh. Yet some creaminess. Some lemon and orange and peach flavours. Malty aroma and dry finish.Refreshing."
"D: Tasty, goes down easy, good kick to it, not very filling, I could drink a few of these, but after a while I might look for something else more flavorful. However, this is one of the better beers that Iâ€™ve had in a style that I haven't really like to much."
"Overall- Man this is good! I bought a single for $2 but this is case worthy! If you can find this buy it!! Mercury Brewing is new to NJ!!"
"Aggressively hoppy with a firm malt backbone that balances it out nicely. Smooth, tasty and easily drinkable despite a certain rawness about it."
"This beer is a classic. A true New England pale ale."
"Poured out a nice light tan head, lingered for a bit. Amber in color and quite hazy. Has a grainy-sweet nose with solid hops. The taste is dominated by maltiness that is then joined by a bitterness and finally an earthy bitterness. Has a slightly heavy, medium-plus body. Overall, a well balanced beer, but not as balanced and refreshing as I expec from the style."
"A well-balanced and very solid beer."
"This beer looks delicious when poured. A perfect, even, amber. Nice and hazy. Dense head. Super malty. A good staple to keep in the fridge."
"Brew pours to a dull copper color with a medium head that has great retention and leaves a good amount of lacing. The aroma has a sweet and roasted malt scent along with a light hop scent. The taste is solid but really is not overly exciting; noticeable are grain and caramel malt flavors up front an then a nice hop end. The hops are not over powering what so ever they just complement things nicely. Also has a taste that I am not quite able to put my finger on but might be a bread like quality? Finish is quite dry. Over all a good brew, a nice sessionsal but not sure it would be one I would go out of my way to get."
"Overall a nice rendition of the style. A nice session beer."
"Appearance is a really cloudy, similar to that of a freshly squeezed apple juice with little to no head. Some hops are there but the malt dominates the less than large nose. This is one great tasting beer malty with some bittering hops. Mouthfeel is smooth/ malty with little carbonation. As for drinkability, you could give the to a BMC drinker or a seasoned BA and either would be happy."
"Drinkability: super session ale. This is one that accompanied great conversation in a bar and the pints could just keep flowing all night."
"Pleasing palate, carbonation is just right. Taste is slightly sweet, mild citrus fruit bouquet and pine balanced with some pleasant hops. Excellent hop flavor and smell, I would have loved more (I love my hops) but seems right on for the style. Aftertaste is a nice bitter, earthy piney flavor that leaves you looking forward to another sip."
"Taste was quite fruity, sweet and syrupy up front. Intense malts, burnt sugar and a touch of spice came through. Hops dominated on the back end and lasted well into the huge, hoppy, bitter aftertaste. Dry and crisp, yet refreshing."
"All too easy to drink, and I was happy to see it on cask again last Monday (July 17)"
"On tap this beer comes together. Plenty of the malt sweetness I felt I was missing from the bottle. Hops are spot-on, herbal and tea-like. Quite balanced and feels authentically British, even with a bit of a mineral flavor. I'm pleased. I do think that Miracle of Science should serve this quite a bit warmer, though."
"Classic middle of the road New England Pale Ale. Not my favorite beer from Ipswich, but a great beer none the less."
"I have to get this off the brewery's tap asap."
"This is a nice, refreshing English style ale."
"Exhibits a hazy orange body topped by a thin off-white head. The aroma is primarily malt with a bit of fruity esters. Not outstanding, but appealing to the nose. Flavor is a well balanced malt sweetness with a fair bit of hop flavor, more than I was expecting. The bitterness balances the malt well and does not completely fade once you swallow. The dry finish is refreshing and lends a bit more to the drinkability of this very well balanced beer. The mouthfeel is solid with decent carbonation, and as mentioned before a bit of a dry finish just begs you to take another sip. This was a pleasant find on a recent trip to the Boston area."
"mouthfeel is full and rich, very nice. drinkability, what can i say? i usually get it by the growler. it's a great brew. a nice hearty, rich full bodied sweet ale."
"Poured a cloudy, opaque orange amber color. Smell is of ripe apples with a subtle malt background. Mouthfeel is on the creamy side, nice. Taste is fruity followed by the hop bitterness which is very understated. Has a sour apple cider flavor that I just didn't care for. I doubt I would buy this one again."
"Unbalanced in terms of flavor and texture. Flawed; nothing exciting about the 'original'."
"I would definately suggest this beer cask conditioned. It was just that much better."
"Growler from LukeÂ’s liquors in Brewster. Being a resident of Western Mass, I rarely have the opportunity to have and Eastern Mass. Growler. This was the first true craft brew I ever had. So long ago, it used to come it a clear growler, where you could see the sediment. Nice looking beer. Deep amber color, with the right amount of carbonation to give righteous head retention. Fruitiness followed by hops, different transition from othe East Coast IPAÂ’s. It had been several years since IÂ’ve had this beer, I am glad I revisited it."
"Very balanced, smooth, and easy to drink. I'll be back to this again soon. Overall: very well done, but I think I prefer their Dark just by just a tad."
"This is a great little ale from Ipswich. It pours with a decent head and the classic ale color. The taste is quite hoppy, but well balanced, rich, and smooth. The carbonation and overall feel is just about perfect, with makes me want to have another. This one is going to find it's way into my fridge quite a bit this summer."
"I picked up a mixed 12-pack of Ipswich Ale after doing some field work all day in Ipswich, MA. I enjoyed this beer and can't wait to try the IPA, Oatmeal Stout, and Dark Ale."
"One thing it wasn't was uneventful and, as I review more of these, that is becoming a bigger issue of mine... the journey that is the drink. I would try this again to continue that journey. Another solid effort from Mercury."
"Overall, a very nice beer. I believe that my bottle my have been over-exposed to some of the winter elements, yet this was still delicious."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a scant 1/4"" light beige head over the orangey amber brew, which has numerous large and small floaties throughout, even though great care was taken pouring. Head is gone quickly, leaving an uneven layer of bubbles, and lacing is average. Aroma is earthy, malty, with a tinge of hoppiness. Taste is also pervaded with earthiness, but the balance of this brew is appreciated. Mouthfeel and drinkability are okay, but could be cleaner, overall better. Will keep an eye out for another to revisit, in case of an off bottle..."
"this is just a rock solid pale ale all around. it pours a lovely orange to amber colour with a big sticky fluffed head. the smell is of burnt grain, fruity hops and earthy malt. there's a nice underlying sweetness as well. this one presents itself as hearty but restrained (in a good way) and it delivers. the flavour starts out a touch hoppy before moving into a malt flavour that is dirty and bark like at times with hints of bread and biscuit. hops are revisited again at the finish which is slightly sweeter than the beginning. there is somewhat of a dry iced tea feel and flavour here as well. it's just a nice brew all around that makes for a great sessional. a great version of this style."
"quite hazy copper with a tan head that doesn't stick around, but laces well. malty, nutty, citrus and fruity smells, not what i was expecting, a bit of hops too. nice malty toasty flavor with nice big caramel presence. sweet brown sugar and cinnamon, with plum and light chocolate flavors, thow in some hoppy bitterness to clean things up towards the end. almost IPA like. medium bodied with snappy carbonation. this is one beer that definietly needs to warm some in the glass, it tastes much bettter close to room temp. really nice pale ale that i come back to frequently."
"The beer after its debarkation from the 12-ounce brown bottle sets in the glass a lightly hazed golden amber color with a frothy off-white head that is modest in size, the resultant lace a thin blanket to lie upon the glass. Nose has a slight hop floral spiciness backed by sweet malt, citrus crisp and clean, start is sweet with a pleasant grain profile, top is middling in its feel to the palate. Finish is patiently hopped and pleasing in its acidity with the aftertaste droughty and long lasting, Ipswich makes some fine session beers, just sorry my friends, who visit, only visit once a year, but IÂ’m thankful they always bring back a six pack of beer for poor old Gusler. lol"
"Half inch frothy head which subsided to a full-coverage sheen by the end; lacing present. Mellow golden hue that poured somewhat hazy and I wondered if that was usual Â– I didnÂ’t remember that it was for some reason. Hops are the first thing noticed in the bouquet, followed by an odd key lime presence. Great pale profile to taste, with just the weird aforementioned tartness. A little slippery on the palate, but thatÂ’s balanced by the acidity."
"I am really glad I sampled this beer. This could be one perfect session beer for a long evening of drinking."
"In a sentence, I would describe an bold ale with far more flavor than expected.. Pours a nice gold amber. Good head retention, lacy and white. Smell is light and spicy. Taste is surprisingly hoppy; almost, but not quite, IPA-like. I got much more from this beer than I thought possible, and I highly applaud it!"
"A fluffy white head aboard a hazy golden body. Good retention and lacing. Smell is spicy, grassy, and herbal with a bit of buttered biscuit caramel sweetness behind it. Taste is big vegetal hoppage with said spiciness, then a grain ride takes it slowly out. Great lasting finish is so damn smooth. Very fresh farm taste, like you are running through fields of golden barley with kent golding hops in a crown on your head. Feel is medium bodied and semi-slick with low carbonation. There is a little sting and a little oxidation (no bottling date), but both can be overlooked with such a great feel and drinkability. Another great one from Ipswich, my favorite local bottling brewery."
"Unfiltered, orangey-tan in hue with a hint of amber, it is a very lovely color. A rocky white head of two fingers in height gracefully tops of the beer. The head retention was very good; it faded in time to a foamy cap. A collar lasted the entire consumption. The subsequent lacing was spotty and it poorly clung to the side of the glass. The bouquet is pleasantly fruity, quite amble, and very juicy. Succulent in a word, I just love the apple, grape, orange, and pear aromas. The malty smells blend perfectly with the fruity aspects, the kisses of caramel kick up the fruitiness a notch. Pleasantly earthy too, the hops also add some hay notes with a kiss of citrus zest. It is very nice; the potency is modest. I find it very inviting. The nose seems East Coast Pale Ale all the way but the palate has a larger English say with just an East Coast twist! The bouquetÂ’s invitation matches the palate perfectly. Honestly the palate is more flavorful than the nose indicated. This is a major plus. The earthy flavors are very big and very bold. This is needed to balance out the burst of fruit and solid hop bitterness. Mixed in with the pear, grape, and orange flavors are a hint of bubblegum, a kiss of hay, prickly citrus bitterness, and more earthy flavors. This is damn tasty! The flavors are very wide and quite encompassing. There are a lot of small complexities working in the beer. Good, wholesome sweetness, a little bready. This is an awesome beer. Long aftertaste. Medium/medium-full in body, the carbonation is modest but natural, the mouthfeel is very pleasant, I like it. This is an amazingly tasty beer. Tremendously awesome, very drinkable, this beer would be great at anytime, anywhere. Thank you drweizen for the bottle in the BIF 5 package!"
"12 oz bottle, no freshness dating. Pours light amber, white head, nice lacing in my glass, some small chunk sediment in bottle. Nice resiny hop aroma. English style ale, balanced malts, respectable hopping level. all in all a nice well crafted brew. Good session staple. Would go nicely with a wide variety of foods."
"A big thanks to noclueaboutbeer for hauling this one out to Kansas all the way from Connecticut."
"A very nice beer. A bit too fruity for my taste but certainly a good brew to have while out every now and then."
"The beer pours a hazy golden color with a frothy white head. The aroma is a bit fruity with pale ale malt undertones. The taste is good. A refreshing pale ale that's well balanced; not too bitter, not too malty; just right. The mouthfeel is fine. This is a light bodied beer that goes down in a hurry. A fine example of a pale ale."
"Perfectly bracing mouthfeel, with tastes of biscuits, yeast, a little hops, and maybe even a hint of citrus zest just to make it supremely drinkable."
"Rust-like orangy color. Bit of floaters and some cakiness left on bottom of bottle. Light carbonation, but within its style. Biscuity, almost peaty notes in the nose with faint hop aromas. Smooth caramel crystal malt taste backed up with a bit of hop dryness in the finish. Has the same slightly-sweet tea flavor I've experienced in other pale ales. Beautiful example of its style, from the English Pale Ale roots. Right on target."
"Johnny P delivers the goods again....Thanks to JP I can now assert that Ipswich is one damn fine brewery..or Mercury Cat or whatever...great beers....perhaps underrated and underappreciated by some....their beers are worth seeking out..."
"Poured a beautiful orangeish copper color with a small white head. Smells of bread and citrus. The taste was a huge letdown for me. It seemed quite hop dominated at the end. Not my idea of a traditional ale, but that's just me. Mouthfeel was solid with some malts and carbonation. It's an ok ale, just not one of my favorites. I'll stick with Ipswich's dark beers."
"now, where can i find this one on cask?"
"A beer with attitude. Whenever I think of the Pilgrims drinking ale, II think it must have tasted like this beer. Cloudy orange, with just a whimpsy head, this beer has a great hopped bite that gets your attention. The bitter taste does not fade. This is beer thhat goes the distance, an American Classic."
"A great basic ale. This beer is done right all the way. Nice orange amber with a solid head. Balance is beauty. Nice malts and hops. Great mouthfeel. Good with food or without. A dependable brew. Worth a pint for sure if you can get it."
"The appearance of this ale was a bright golden color, with plenty of carbonation, and a foamy white head with very good retention, receeding to a lace-leaving film midway. Malt aromas are present but are overpowered by the floral hop aroma. Light mouthfeel, citrusy, crisp, and perfectly balanced with hops. A very light, refreshing, and easy drinking beer from Ipswich"
"Slightly hazy, orange amber with a thin, off white head that recedes quickly leaving specks of lace. Very unique and inviting aroma of nutty grains, sweet tangerines and wet hay. Light to medium bodied with flavors of toast and marmalade fading quickly to a dry, earthy hop finish. A very nice session ale. More of an Amber style than a Pale ale , easy to drink and very tasty stuff. This is a great beer to give to a person just starting thier journey into micro's."
"A solid beer with crisp hop bite that flirts with IPA status. A hoppy, refreshing APA in the Sierra Nevada style."
"A cloudly, light orange color with a soft (and thin) white head, and very little lacing. This beer has a pungent piney aroma, with some additional, more delicate fruity notes. The bold hoppy presence, alongside a strongly carbonated body, make this an exciting brew, especially in the first few sips. The flavor profile is dominated by a hoppy bite that gives way to fruity and herbal notes at the back of the palate. There is also a strange character to the finish that I want to call ""bubblegum," though that's a flavor that I do not normally associate with this style. This is a solid offering from Ipswich, a beer I'd be happy to revisit."
"This ale pours a cloudy golden orange. The head is light tan and active. The aroma is hoppy with a hint of sweetness. The taste is refreshing with a sweet malt start and a dry hoppy finish. This is a good all purpose draft ale. It goes well with food or alone by it self. It pleases in the winter as well as in the summer. To bad the bottled product (12oz.) is not the same brew. When on the North Shore of Massachusetts you've got to have an Ipswich on-tap."
"Thanks to pbrian for the sample."
"Bright orange with fluffy head, hazy with little appetizing flecks of yeast. Great forceful malts with fruits, wood characteristics. Hops are not too strong but surprisingly bitter, they pinch the flavor somewhat. Aftertaste goes down nice. Smooth and creamy, quite unique. It almost doesn't seem like a pale, there is just a sweet malt backbone to this reminiscent of a saison or something. Very American, very New England, and not quite refined enough to be one of the true greats. Hops are just a tad too sharp and make the overall flavor slightly vinegary. Still I could happily down these all night if called upon to do so."
"Beautiful murky, golden brown colour with a creamy, whtie head that maintains a full coverage down the pint.  Nice earthy, bready malts and estery hops in the air.  Great bitter hop bite mellowed with rounding malts, great balance.  Very smooth meduim body with a less pronounced carbonation.  This beer drinks great, anyday, any situation.  The brew leaves a pleasant aftertaste to remeber the beer by and induce continued consumption.  A fantatstic choice.  Cheers"
