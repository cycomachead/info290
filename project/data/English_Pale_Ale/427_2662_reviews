"I didn´t notice this could be interesting in previous tastings. Not near a London Pride but still coming on it´s own. tiA bit watery and bland, like other ales from Marston´s, but honest and surely true to the style. Those waters at Burton on Trent, English hops and malts, are very well balanced and i could have this again."

"Overall, this is a very well done English Bitter. Better than many bitters that come to the USA and I would absolutely love to have this out of a cask one day."
"Enjoy"

"500ml bottle. ½ pt glass. Earthy & caramel notes as cap is removed. Copper color, chill haze appearance. Off-white medium bubbled froth creates close crown showing fairly good retention & leaving rocky rings. Slight sulfur, wet stone, caramel, slight wood & piney aromas. Sweetish upfront yields to nutty bitterness, slightly grassy & mineralized notes. Medium body. Moderate to low carbonation. Oily to watery texture. Controlled bitterness by malty bed, slight caramel & earthy flavors linger into a dry bitter finish. Biscuit & mild toasted hues on the aftertaste. Nice Session beer."

"As it is plonked down on the bar there is the delight of wonderful cascades flowing down the glass. By the time I get to my seat it has settled into a warm, golden colored ale with a good half inch head. The first sip, usually a big sip, doesn't usually reveal too many of the beers bitter, or more fruity notes. But about half way down, wow. Suddenly the beer comes alive and reasserts itself at the top of the drinkability board. It has a really smooth finish that makes for easy drinking. And fast drinking if your not careful. Or you are careful! I usually find 3 or 4 pints of this ale starts the night off splendidly. As I say, if this beer is done right and looked after and poured well, it is the best. But a bad Pedigree, that hasn't been stored right, or is poured badly, or even chilled(!) ruins the flavors of this excellent English ale. There is no real smell as I find; slight, and only very slight fruity notes, but mostly a light hoppy style of aroma. This is a truly remarkable beer. I find this beer is at it's best when served from an old fashioned pump in an English pub. The canned variety doesn't quite work for me. Although I wouldn't refuse a 4 pack."
"I would drink this beer again"

"O: An average beer. Very drinkable. Tasty but nothing out of the ordinary. Solid but not exceptional."
"Overall - Pretty good overall beer, reminds me a lot of an English Bitter crossed With and English Pale Ale."

"3.25/5"
"Classic English Pale Ale with a nice bitterness."
"Very good overall....definite session beer with some huntsman cheese."
""
""
""
""
"Notes: An outstanding, complex English session ale."

"Good stuff. I was told this was a nuttier, breadier Speckled Hen and I'll buy that. Not as fruity either."
""
""
""
"Lacks identity, development and the all important doting care from the brewery. Very much a case now of stack'em high, sell'em cheap and keep the cookie cutter rolling."
"Taste is nice jammy-juicy-caramelly-toasted-bread sweetness, hint of apple, faintly spicy earthy wood bitterness to balanced. It has strong freshly baked bread with topasted crust, slightly caramelised, in the finish along with some jammy-earhty-woody spicy bitterness. It is wonderful, complex, full-bodied, yet easy to drink and light, a classic English ale."
"water that goes into this Clearly is one of the stars here."
"M: Hmm, maybe could be a little bublier for a bottled version."
"Beautiful cask pour with an inch of thick head. Silky mouthfeel with balance of bitter and floral characteristics. This beer was made for cask. amber color with consistent lace as it goes down. I'm not a big English beer drinker but might try more on cask now."
""
""
"A solid beer to wash down dinner. Nothing more or less."
"Nitro made for a creamy mouth feel that coated the palate. All in all a good session able beer but it lacked the flavor I was looking for."
""
""
""
""
"overall - this is not a bad beer. it's not a great beer either but it's nice. Given a choice of some other British pub style beers and this I would opt for something else."

"O - this aspect I gave a 5 due to style concerns. this beer embodies in every way why I love getting down with a good, basic English ale every once in a while. they are often balanced perfectly, taste soft and subtle, and go with just about any food you might be eating at the time. it's a great style to have when you just want to drink a good, solid beer, and not shell out a ton of money for something that's hopped to high hell, aged in some over the top manner and $15 a bottle."
""
"A nice ale that can suit any occasion."
"Final Grade: 3.43, a B-."
"Pours a ruddy orange with a loose two-finger head; nice cap, lots of lacing. The smell is buttery oak, clover, rising dough. The taste is a lot of biscuit up front, some buttery notes, a sharp wood sorrel zing, and a mellow oak undertone right through. It's moderately carbonated, medium in body, a little viscous on the palate. A very nice Burton ale, one that I will return to from time to time."
"O - my only other offering from this brewery was disappointing and I walked by this one for some time before finally decided to give it a try. Glad I did, I relatively enjoyed this brew although I would likely not seek it out again given the plethora of good brews available for the style"
"Overall a pleasant English Pale. Plenty of subtle flavor. Worth a try."
"A very nice english pale, has ver fresh clean flavor, very sessionable."
"Pours a clear light orange with a 2 inch orange-white head that settles to a dome floating on the top of the beer. Thin rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, honey, and light citrus and grape aromas. Taste is of malt, honey, citrus, and grape juice. There are also some nutty flavors I am picking up. Medium bitterness on the palate after each sip. A low carbonation level with an almost flat mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good English pale ale that claims to be the ""official ale of England"". However, this is not as good as other English beers in my opinion."
"M: The sensation is balanced but again turns a little more into the bitterness, sweetness is present at the beginning turning fast into bittersweetness and then into bitterness for a bitter long ending on the back of the mouth."
"Not bad beer. Let the bottle warm a bit out of the fridge. Poured with a nice, off-white, textured, foamy, frothy, fluffy head that slowly settled down and a little lace. Color is a clear honey amber with some bubble trails. Aroma is subdued and is of malt, yeast, hops, caramel and fresh bread. Flavor is similar to nose and has good balance between bitter, sweet, and tang. Body is great and so is carbonation. Finish is like flavor and tapers from sweet to bitter. Session beer."
"Overall: in my mind, this beer is not particularly to-style compared to other English pales I've had, but on its own it is quite a tasty beer. I'd definitely have this again."
"Clear and clean pour from the can but head dissipated quickly. Aromas were golden syrup, malt and bread which was very nice. My wife has just been drinking this on tap in the UK and says its not as robust as in the pub. Still, flavours are nice and malty sweet with some late bitterness which should prevent cloying but found it a bit out of balance and weakened the drinkability score for me. Carbonation was almost non-existent and it is a little watery. I prefer John Smiths which is very similar but more drinkable. Not a bad beer but not exciting."
"Overall; very tasteful Pale Ale, but at the same time balanced and easy to drink. While there’s the problem that there’s no strong features to it, I think it’s almost a staple for English Ales. Definitely worth a try."
"O: Nothing special. Run of the mill English Ale."
"Taste - not much going on here at all. A bit of wood, faint and subdued citrus, and a mineral finish. Not much malt character to speak of. Very dry and quite refreshing."
"Overall, this was a good drink, easy and refreshing. One more to my plus list."
"The mouthfeel seemed typical for the style, a bit undercarbonated. Medium to light bodied."
"D: A solid, downright archetypal example of the English Pale Ale, but only really distinguished by its exceptional mouthfeel. It may be the most sessionable EPA I've had yet."
"Very easy to go beer, a good start for getting in this style as well as no offensive to revisit."
"D: A generally well made and drinkable English Pale Ale."
"This beer isn't too bad but it's still just a standard English Bitter. It's a good beer to wet your whistle with. It's light in flavor and mouthfeel. Not overly watered down but not thick either. The average drinker would probably enjoy this quite a bit. It's an easy beer to drink a lot of. I would get bored drinking too many of these though. The color is a minimal hazy yellow with not much head. Would have liked to try this one on tap because it sounds much better than way."
"Must have had this at a pivotal moment. A lot of things were clicking. Not only did the flavor wow me a good bit, it rolled through the palate velvety smooth, reminding me of the first time I had a cask ale - the carbonation had yet (or failed) to take hold, but it was alien and lovely. I see on their website that they distribute this to the US. Where? (Oh, State Line, of course)"
"O - A very sessionable drop that is quite balanced"
"Dr: A wonderful example of cream done right, kind of a kilkenny meets belhaven, but sadly lacking in the body. I'd recommend it to fellow brewers just to see how creamy it is, but I wouldn't order it again at Glasgow prices. Lacks the usual bitterness of pale ales, which is actually quite nice in this case."
"D: A classic of English brewing, I'm delighted to see it back. Good now, but begs to be on cask."
"Almost seems to drink bigger than 4.5%. I need to knock this category a couple points, as the beer seems filling and burpy. I have no doubt this would be easier-drinking off a cask, and would appreciate the opportunity to do so."
"D - Its okay, not any better than any other widely available EPA (Boddington's, Abbot, etc.)"
"D- Compared to other similar beers, this one translates well in the bottle. Nothing amazing. Good for what it is."
"Very easy to drink, so high on the drinkability scale. Feels fine in the mouth, not thick but you know it's there."
"An OK ale, but rather bland. I won't be drinking this on a regular basis."
"I get a resin-syrup type aftertaste, meaning I'd probably never have more than one or two in a session. It does feel a bit heavy overall, but I'll definitely try it again."
"http://abarwithnoname.wordpress.com"
"D - Very smooth and drinkable, definitely a session beer."
"Drinakabilty is above average; I could have some more but possibly would levitate more to Marston's IPA. Cheers."
"Wow. This is certainly an excellent example of the english pale ale style. I like it more so than a few other examples I've had. I would highly recommend it."
"O: Easy to drink, but boring after a while"
"D: Overall a decent EPA, not bad at all."
"D: A classic British session beer."
"Not complex or bold, but very very drinkable."
"Interestingly I found some differences between this Swedish can version and the English bottle version - to the English bottle's advantage."
"D- This is a highly drinkable brew, and as per usual with English Bitters, I could enjoy this all night, with or without food to accompany it. Clean, refreshing, yet still does retain some smooth richness. Highly recommended!"
"Fairly drinkable if you want an average bitter but overall nothing remarkable here, no need to search out or pay the inflated export price."
"Almost feels a bit undercarbonated to be honest, which makes it feel slightly watery, but it's not too bad."
"A very pleasant and easy drinking English Pale Ale that reminds me a lot of what Bass Ale used to taste like."
"Drinkability is perfect. This is the ideal session beer IMHO."
"Drink - A nice moderately flavorful brew that would be decent for a session. It isn't overpowering, just a nice all around beer."
"Thanks to Sebastian for the bottle!"
"Overall, decent. The fruit was a nice surprise, and it was easy to drink. There are much better out there, but this isn't bad."
"Feels quite creamy and smooth at first but the hops give it quite a dry character towards the end - very nice. Very good mouthfeel, carbonated just enough so it the end is dry, but not so much that it becomes a fizzy soda. Very drinkable, overall nothing amazing, but a solid English ale overall. Will have to try this on cask since I've previously been quite put off by Pedigree."
"M & D: Decent feel, simple and straightforward low alcohol beer. A nice choice for a rainy summer day. I'd drink this again, especially on draft."
"D - Very dry and toasty with little malt sweetness and fairly weak yeast character. The hops are strong in terms of both flavor and bitterness with a chalky mineral twang. Not bad, but I would prefer a little yeast fruit to cut the harshness of the hops."
"From the 500 ml. bottle marked OAHK-04:54. Sampled on July 16, 2010. It pours a handsome looking amber-copper with about three-quarters of an inch of beige, silky head that lasts for quite some time. The aroma has a pleasing balance of creamy, caramel malts and English hops. The hops are steeped in bread and biscuit for afters. The mouthfeel falls in the medium territory but is has a smooth creaminess to it. Definitly an English style bitter in the classic sense with a sharp, but easy to drink finish. Ah yes, a nice brew."
"According to its bottle cap, Marston's claims to be the ""official ale of England"". While I think the country may be selling itself a bit short on that, I do appreciate that this bitter is still brewed according to traditional methods, with locally grown ingredients and that it embodies the virtues of balance and sessionability that define the English brewing tradition."
"D - Quite enjoyable and easy to drink. A very Good Pale Ale."
"Very unimpressed with this one, and am glad I only ordered a small glass at Churchkey."
"It's not a phenomenal beer, but it's solid enough. There's nothing off or offensive about it, but nor is there anything unique or exciting about it."
"It is like drinking water, goes down smooth and easy, but the flavor is kind of weak. It has more character than most form this category but it still could have more."
"Well the official beer of the English cricket team lives up to the hype i've been hearing about for years. It's nice to know that a beer that is still made traditionally can be not only a well loved beer but can be a marketing success."
"D. An excellent quaffing beer which I personally prefer in bottle form rather than cask. A well crafted beer from Marston's brewery"
"An above-average EPA, certainly one to knock back in a pub. Nose isn't fantastic, but the taste is wonderfully smooth."
"500ml bottle purchased at the Wellington & Bradley LCBO. Pours a light amber with one finger of white head and speckled lacing on the shaker. Bubbly carbonation in the body. Smell and taste are sulphur, mineral water, sweet fruitiness, a bit floral, caramel malt, Triscuit crackers, and a leafy, English hop bitterness, somewhat citric. Mouthfeel is silky soft, medium, great bite on the palate, a little spicy, dry and fleeting finish. I can see why this is a British institution. Awesome example of an EPA, and surprisingly good for such a widely distributed beer. Worth my three dollars!"
"In the end, this is a very easy to drink beer."
"Drinkability: Uninspiring, quite a light drink"
"Overall, a decent brew, and one that I thought I appreciated more by reviewing it. If I was drinking this straight from the bottle in another setting, I wouldn't think this beer was above average by any means. It could definitely be more flavourful, but what's there makes for a nice, easy drinking beer."
"Notes: Decent beer that is a pretty good session beer. The flavors are a little light and watered down. Good for a everyday beer but not outstanding."
"D: highly drinkable!"
"it's easy going down, but it just lacks character."
"Drinkability : a good beer in the style Pale ale."
"Poured from a brown 16.9 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy dark brown color with a small head. Smell is sweet, some malts and hops. Taste is good, hops, malts, maybe some fruit, a bit sweet. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a quality beer worth trying."
"The malt taste is mild but has a good herbal hop balance. The back half has some mineral taste that finishes dry with medium bitterness. The aftertaste might be the most interesting with light citrus, then slight diactyl, fading to cotten candy..."
"Mouthfeel is a bit flat - true to style"
"Drinkability: A well respected British bitter, which provides well rounded flavours with a dangerously drinkable quality."
"Drinkable enough, this, but leans too heavily on the bland English hoppiness. Suitable for downing, but not for Downing street. If that makes sense."
"A nicely drinkable brew, it has 'sessionable' plastered all over it."
"a bit thin on mouthfeel, but that probably helps drinkability. you would struggle to fill up on this beer, which is good because i could pass hours drinking this."
"Maple bronze with a soft ivory head that is small but retains well and has an even, smooth texture. Mild, slightly fruity nose of unripe bananas, oak, honey, and wheat bran, with a hint of white wine. Solid and well-developed flavor, fruity and light yet earthy and deep. Lighter notes of honey, lavender, lemon, lime, and champagne interplay with shadows of oak, pine, maple syrup, and sourdough and rye breads. The carbonation is just about spot-on, soft yet lively and buoyant. Not terrifically dry, but still fairly clean and refreshing. Very good - I'll have to give it ago on cask next time I see it."
"Not bad, not great, overall."
"Corny aroma with a hint of diacetyl, but caramel and malt dominate. There are light apple esters in both the aroma and flavor, but the flavor is dominated by lighter crystal malts. The body is very thin and the finish is watery. Served with a minimal head at cellar temperatures (this is in the UK, after all) and poured a lovely deep gold with crystal clarity."
"Drinkability: Good price/quality ratio. Good representation of the style (i myself am not an enthusiast of EPA's but enjoyed this one very much). Little potential for aging. Easy to drink and complex enough to make you want to drink more."
"M&D: in general, the overall profile is way less sulphurous, less smooth, and slightly more bitter than the cask version; as regards any woodiness endowed by the Union System consisting of lots of aligned oak barrels, it's very understated but quite rightly, supposedly so. I always have problems with the fizz level of Marston's bottled beers, but this slightly spritzy bottle doesn't show much trace of ""bad pasteurisation"" or skunkiness, hence a plus for the drinkability. While this new, 5% bottle version proves to be an easy-drinking one without any hint of alc. (at all!) to me, I'd still choose the cask version when I fancy a pint of traditional, oak-aged pale ale, AND WHEN my preferred Wadworth 6X is unavailable from my local pubs (served on gravity straight from the wooden cask!)."
"Overall a decent ale, just not much in the flavor department."
"Moutfheel is medium..oh, it doesn't matter. This wasn't a horrible beer but it wasn't anything I would recommend or try again."
"Taste was quite bitter with nice combination of hops and maltiness. It was interesting that I had tasted Mac's Gold All Malt lager beforehand, but there was much more maltiness to this brew. Overall a solid bitter from the bottle."
"overall very pleasent, good start."
"Definitely worth seeking out."
"Pours a clear dark amber, dull orange colour, big fluffy white head forms, drops to a patchy layer and ring around the glass, some lacing on the glass, big bubbles, looks okay. Smell is nice and malty, sweet and biscuity, some caramel, toast, light floral hopping, some fruit, apricots, well balanced and malty, nice fruity sweetness to it. Taste is similar, malty up front, some caramel and toast, light fruits, very dry wheaty middle, slightly grainy, touch of iron, apricots and floral in the finish, nice herbal bitterness. Mouthfeel is light bodied with low carbonation, very smooth and drinkable. Pretty average pale ale, decent but nothing special about it."
"This is a light and refreshing beer, pretty drinkable. If the sweetness was toned down just a tad I'd be more enthused to drink more."
"Definitely one of Marston's better beers. Quite a malty taste but quite flavoursome. Recommended to any ale fans out there."
"Overall: Very good stuff, Much better than I initially expected. Don't know why I came into it with low expectations but it totally showed me up in every aspect. Would buy again!"
"Overall, I just might not be the best qualified to review English Bitters, but this doesn't really compete with some of the other examples that I've had. Still, not too bad."
"I really have to save up my money to go to England, to experience this ""on-cask"". Wonderful ""sessionability"" with subtle, yet complex aroma and flavors."
"You could do worse than Marston's pedigree for sure.. but if you are looking for something remarkable - keep clicking."
"There are lot's of EPA's out there that can run laps around this one. Glad I tried one, but given the price of beer these days my money will be spent elsewhere"
"There is no knockout punch here, but this is a solid allrounder, very much a superior session beer. I'm sure this won't be my last."
"This one didn't impress too much. Flavour profile just didn't work for me."
"Well balanced and drinkable. Tastes of pale malts, good hop bitterness and a bit of skunk."
"d: ok but not something i would go out of my way to have again"
"On tap at the Village Idiot. Arrived at the table with a copper colour and a small off-white creamy head. Sweet malty aroma, with floral hops. In the taste the malt seems to come through as lightly fruity flavours with notes of honey and lightly floral hops. There's hardly any bitterness and the finish is a touch bland. Very smooth body with minimal carbonation. The whole thing is subdued enough to be suitable for sessioning, but I'd really be looking for something a bit better."
"An extremely drinkable ale, one I wouldn't mind quaffing a litre of every so often. Cheers!"
"This is a traditional English bitter that I have drunk for decades albeit normally on draft. Dark amber with lively head. Malty caramel nose, while on the palate there is nuttiness and a touch of caramel. Reasonable body at this alcohol level, restrained hop. It's nicely balanced and drinkable even if it doesn't set the world on fire."
"D: Smooth enough to consume a few before calling it quits"
"Apple aroma, disappeared very quickly. Clear golden color with a frothy off-white head and very fine bubbles coming up through the glass. Some lace. Initial salty, apple/fruit flavor followed by a mellow spicy hop flavor and slight bitterness. Aftertaste a nice blend of fruit, spicy hops, bitterness. Medium/light carbonation with a smooth mouthfeel. Subtle yet complex."
"Overall: very interesting and well balanced beer. Great bitterness presence. A must have."
"This beer pours a hazy red-amber color with little to no head. After it has settled, there is a queer sentiment that settles on the bottom of the glass. The smell is strong of candied fruits, almost like a good quadrupel with heaps of sugar. The taste has a resemblance to apple juice, with the same carbonation as cider. Its very malty with not a hint of bitterness. There is a good aftertaste which lingers for a while, but better than that is the drinkability--this beer goes down easy and begs for another sip!"
"D - A pretty decent & tasty EPA at 4.5%. Not the most interesting around, just nice & well balanced."
"I wonder if this beer is better on tap? I bet that a nitrogen charge would really aerate this beer and bring out the flavor."
"The taste was off watered-down bagged tea, distant smacks of honey, and a copper penny. Overall, it was like iced tea mixed half and half with tepid creek water. Not at all good. Locals told me it can be hit and miss on tap. Not a good sign."
"I first had a Marston's Pedigree when I was over in England a few years back. I remember it being sharp to the tongue. This bottled version is much smoother and sweeter than I recall it being. There's a rich maltiness within the brown body that overrides any hoppy flavor. Good head on the pour. Very drinkable if you don't mind the sweetness."
"d: Not too flashy.."
"Overall, it's ok. I could drink this again."
"A nice mild and sweet malty intro with notes of oak and vanilla that eventually fade to a nice bitter finish. Nicely balanced medium body with good flavor...this ale goes down effortlessly. Give it a go!"
"Overall, I was very surprised with the fullness of this beer. I'll definitaley buy again."
"The beer I reviewed was purchased in a Weatherspoon's pub in Birmingham, England on 13th Jan 2007."
"drinkability isn't that great. the aroma is kind of unpleasant, and the taste is fairly similar."
"D - Decent, sessionable EPA."
"Fairly drinkable if you like bitterness but overall nothing remarkable here."
"A typical english pale ale, but seems to become stale very quickly, not one ill pick up again."
"Not something I'd pick up again, basically ranks in with most macros for me."
"50 cl. bottle. It pours a little, almost inexistent head, with a copper - orange colour. Smell of limestone, floral hops and cookies or biscuit. Mouth of fruits, limestone, nuts and some butter. A bit of lemon too, dry and sulphury finish, with some dessert sweetness."
"This beer pour a golden copper, with some reddish undertones, slight head and lacing and some visible carbonation. The nose has some fruity notes, as well as a hop presence. The taste has almost spicy elements, with some bitter hops lingering around, and a slight woody finish. Mouthfeel was pretty decent, crisp and dry, with noticable carbonation, somewhat light bodied, but i think that actually works in the beer's favour. Overall, i like this ale quite a bit, its flavourful, but at the same time not too heavy, a good option when looking for something refreshing and tasty, and pretty easy to down a few."
"Extremely drinkable- a very well done session beer."
"Pours a hazy, coper/red color, with suspended yeat. Minimal head and okay lacing. Aroma of hops and dark fruits. While initial flavor was okay, the finish seemed very metallic at first. However, as beer warmed, the flavor became more fruity and subtle, and finish smoother..actually left a warming sensation, which is uncommon for a beer with this low abv. Not a bad beer."
" This is a perfectly OK average English beer, average, that's what it is, and for me that's not good enough. I'm sure I remember it as memorable (if that makes sense)"
"Nice to try this old world classic on tap @ Drop off Laundry in NYC, Pours dark orangy amber, semi cloudy, with a long lasting light tan head, and leaving pleanty of lacing. Mildly malty nose, this is a very smooth in the mouth, pleasant, tasty, and easy drinking Brit. all the way ale. Low alcohol, balanced, a fine sessioner. If you see it on tap its well worth a try."
"The beer poured gold and a bit amber with an.off white head. The aroma was of malt and floral hops. The taste was malty with a light floral hop finish. The feel was light and dry. This beer was OK, I didn't find anything that would steer me away from it, but nothing that would steer me back."
"Man, I'd like to try this on cask!"
"Overall, Good Stuff."
"Marston's Pedigree pours a cloudy copper with a fluffy off white head from a 500ml brown bottle. The aroma is very mild and I really can't pick much out from it. Tastes like a fairly light but very well balanced English pale ale. The bottle indicates that it was brewed in oak casks. I may be picking up some flavor from the oak, but its not particularly strong. Overall, not bad. Worth a try, nothing to get to excited about though."
"The first taste seems to confirm this. Roasted, nutty caramel malt character predominates, but there's enough hop bitterness to keep this one interesting. Soft on the tongue, dry in the throat. I thought this one might be a bit sweet for my taste, but it's not too bad. This is a very British Beer, and a fairly well executed one. The lower ABV keeps it pretty quaffable, I can see downing a few pints of these in a London pub next time I go..."
"being labelled 'exceptional premium ale' sounds a bit odd, however an expectional brew this definitely is ... a typical Burton ale, not very rich, not very fruity, not very sweet, not very dry ... however all nots in a perfect and very soft harmony ...if Bass is one of the best large quantity ales this one does even better ...."
"Pours a medium golden-copper with a small white head that dissipates quite quickly and leaves no lacing, but maintains a ring around the edge of the glass. Smells of caramel and sweet maltiness with fruits and a touch of hops. Tastes are dominated by butter and caramels, with a hoppy finish and some spices in the mix as well. Mouthfeel is watery, but well carbonated. Drinkability is good, but the beer is unimpressive overall."
"Quite average overall. Not exactly unpleasant, but nothing to particularly recommend it either."
"Very refreshing and great for sipping with sausage and chips."
"Best I can say is that it's nice. Competently done, but not remarkable."
"A nice enough brew that has the potential to be great when it's fresh. I wish I could decipher the dating system on the back label, and save my $3 for a non-elderly bottle. I'll have to bug a friend for a bottle or can next time someone hops across the pond."
"A pleasing brownish copper colour. Soilid floral hoppy aroma, with a very assertive hoppy flavor, as one would expect. Not much else going on though, aside from a slight undercurrent of bread without much of an interesting flavor contribution from the malt or yeast. Solid, but I was expecting more."
"Notes: Not bad. Nothing really impressive here."
"The beer pours a hazy dark gold/amber color with a thick and creamy offwhite head. There are suspended yeast floaties present. The aroma is good. It has a sweet and fruity malt scent that boasts of pale and light crystal malts along with bitter noble hop aroma. The taste is average. It has a weak and watery malt flavor that borders on an ice tea taste. It is light and bitter with a slight yeast fruitiness in the finish. The mouthfeel is average as well. It is a low bodied beer with adequate carbonation. There is no real substance to this beer. This is a big let down. I was expecting something much better with a little more malt flavor."
"A pleasure to finally try this Burton classic,pours a rich golden with a large two finger white head settling into a creamy mass leaving a ring of lace behind.Whoo this is brewed in oak casks and it shows in the aroma very woody with a touch of sulpher,flavors are very dry firm biscuity malt backbone followed by just a touch of herbal hop my guess fuggles?Now this is a sessionable ale dry enough to make the mouth want more not earth shattering but glad I gotta a chance to try it for sure."
"Clear amber, off-white head that reduced quickly to a thin lace. Malty aroma was a combination of graininess and light caramel. A bit of fruitiness was also present, and hops appeared as it warmed a bit. The flavour was very much like the aroma, nicely balanced, with a drying bitterness at the finish. Medium body and carbonation, mild buttery texture. This could definitely work as a session beer."
"This pale ale could become one of my regulars."
"Mourhfeel moderate- a nice pint to sit around with."
"A decent reliable beer this. A slightly nutty flavour, the hops are there but only on the background. It's a darkish colour. The amount of foam you get is variable, but it doesn't really last though it will lace down the side of the glass. At 4.5% it really ought to be a little strong for a session beer, but it is surprisingly drinkable. Reccommended."
"Seems a bit thick for a bitter, but ultimately easy to drink. A decent session beer."
"of remaining foam. Balanced earthy and woody smell some sourness also but nothing unpleasant. Taste is smooth and very british pale ale type taste. A smooth, soft, slightly malty taste with just enough bitterness to keep it real. This thing is versatile with food but it makes me want cheese and bread/mustard and Branstons pickle-- maybe some apples thrown in too. Quite smooth and quaffable. I bet this one is a lot better on-tap or cask."
"A nice ""Still Brewed In Wood"" cap for my collection. Pedigree is caramel coloured, or rusty brown, topped with a large-bubble head that goes down rather rapidly, but never disappears entirely. On the second pour, the head is much more creamy, small bubbled and more consistent. The lacing leaves moderate amounts on the glass, but when the beer is moving the lace is actually quite good. Tapioca-coloured foam. Very clear, and it probably takes on some colours from the oak wood. Aroma is at first all caramel, sweet malt and butter, sourdough. In close, definite wood notes, though it does not smell like oak to me--more like balsam. The wood gives it a dryer aroma, which mitigates the rich malt I smelt at first. I like it: it adds rather an unexpected nuance. Grassy, dusty hops are behind the wood and malt. Raisins and cream, some honey, prunes, lightly toasted bread. The wood is even stronger once in the mouth, felt up front and in the finish. While at first I thought it masked some good potential malt, the oakiness becomes very pleasant after a few sips. The malt gives butterscotch and lactose. A low-to-medium dryness in the finish, woody, dusty, but actually there is almost no aftertaste to this beer. Taste is definitely not as good as the aroma. The feel is a little watery, not very substantial in the mouth, but it makes the beer quite potable. This beer reminds me of some of Granville Island's beers from BC: woody, cardboard-like. I like the wood in this beer's character, but there is not much else happening in the flavour profile; it is too light tasting, too unoffensive."
"I thought I'd try the cask version since I remember being a bit let down by the bottled product. Poured a nice amber gold topped by a thin white head. Aroma was strong on the malt side with a hint of sulphur? could be the Burton water. Refreshing session bitter with nice hop tones, lightinsh mouhfeel, refreshing and drinkable. Another example of the superiority of cask ale. Not my favorite ale but another drinkable one at that."
"All in all, not a half bad pint. You can probably do a little more exciting, but if you're in the mood for just a nice pint (or two or three) than this is a good beer."
"Medium bodied and smooth, good solid English Pale ale, good session beer at 4.5% ABV."
"Very clean and biscuity flavours make my first impression, with a touch of bitter in the finish. A slight appley sweetness is coming through as well. It's understated, but mostly in a good way. In the mouth, it feels smooth but light and easy drinking. This is definitely a good session ale candidate. I like it a lot."
" Medium light body is malt pronounced...smooth mouth feel...apple, bready tastes with a twang of lemon-grass hop in the background...toned back hop astringency gives this beer a mild mellow character....finishes mild and wet with apple tastes yielding to a piney hop bitterness and a light metallic after taste. A comfortable mild bitter."
"Drinkability - very tasty, also rather pricey at around $4 per half liter."
"Somewhat below the 1845 tried the day before. Malty and nicely hopped and bitter vegetable cabbage-like finish. White head on golden colour. Grainy, Mid-sip woody, and roasty. Apple carmel and lemon. Mild alcohol a plus. Nice creamy pale. Better at room temperature."
"On form, this is a Classic Burton Pale Ale, that is still under British ownership and brewed in Burton upon Trent. I dearly miss the sulphury noses and smells of rotten eggs though!!!"
"Dark Gold with a big fluffy head this beer looks great. The nose is yeasty, hoppy and sulphurous all at once. The beer tastes of refined hops and a malty backbone. This is really a classic British Bitter with that sulphurlike finish and subtle fruity notes. Drink slowly to savour the small nuances or drink deep as a session beer that never tires."
"Bottle: Poured a light brown beer with a quite decent head with standard retention. Aroma is comprised solely of malt. Taste is mostly comprised of malts with some well balance bitterness at the end. Decent session bitter but nothing extraordinary is going to happen here."
"The inconvienient placement of a label band around the neck of the bottle made it almost impossible to avoid pouring in a few bits of yeast. There is nothing on the label about bottle conditioning either which makes it equally difficult to avoid flakes of yeast sediment. It poured an amber beer with a thin white head that subsided to a thin film. Aroma was of light fruity esters and a touch of hops. The flavor had a nice mineral dryness which transitioned into a crisp hop bitterness. The malt flavors were really present on the finish while the hops bitterness completly went away to leave with a clean finish."
"Presented in a 500 ml brown bottle, best before date printed onto the back label (31 May 05--which would make this pretty fresh). A crystal clear light copper colour for the body, medium foamy head that recedes to a very thing cap, and leaves small patches of lacing. There is faint caramel malt and dried fruit on the nose, some sweet booziness as well, orange citrus and flowery hops. Flavour is subdued, crisp grains become more apparent, some spicey orange in the middle, and floral hops to finish with some herbal spice on the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is full, a bit of carbonation bite on the finish, a texture that blends with the hops. Enough carbonation to make me belch after every 2-5 sips. A pretty average pale ale, the oak casks that the front label boasts that this was brewed in doesn't even make a dent in the mediocrity. I'll pass next time. Excuse me, I just burped again."
"pours a rusty orange color with a big rocky head with incredible retention. Gobs of foam are left behind on the glass. The aroma is not very strong, but pleasant. Bitter hops, an astrigent tartness and sweetish fruity malts. The taste is bitter, with a tongue tingling tartness (alcohol esters?), grassy hops and rather subdued malts. The mouthfeel is very smooth and even. There is a somewhat astringent aftertaste which I find pleasant. The drinkability of this beer is very high. Would make a great session brew."
"Inoffensive but just a really dull ale, there seems to be alot of them about. Stick to fullers or landlord"
"Light to medium-bodied, reasonably smooth. A decent beer, not great, good flavor, expected more though."
"I gotta admit, I like this beer. Alot. A bit more than I suspected. Pedigree pours an auburn, honey colour with a tremendously fluffy head. I've finished the beer and lace is still clinging still to the glass. It hasn't moved. Initial smell of hops, followed by a smooth maltiness. First taste is a bit bready, then the hops kick it. Bittering and sour and delicious. Creamy head. The head actually has a taste and mouthfeel to it. Bonus. Smooth, lighter mouthfeel. The lighter spectrum of medium bodied ale. Good, drinkable beer that's great for sipping, not meant for pounding."
"Drinkability: I came in having high expectations because I'd heard about the Burton Union cask system. And while this beer is a perfectly cromulent beer, I can't say that I'm particularly enthused."
"Pours a two-fingered white head that goes slowly and leaves a good lace. Cloudy, light amber color. Moderate carbonation. Starts with a good mix of malt and hops, finishes clean but very slightly hoppy. Light - medium bodied. $3.20 for a 500ml bottle."
"A tasty easy to drink brew, seems to be under flavored though."
"I had to push myself along a bit in order to finish the whole bottle."
"I *did* like the low carbonation and med-low body of this beer - these qualities made for a good mouthfeel and drinkability. Because of this, Pedigree could've been a contender for a ""session beer."" However, there are oh so many other excellent ""session beers"" out there that, in addition to being delightfully easy to drink, are also thoroughly interesting. Pass me a Sam Smith's Old Brewery Pale Ale..."
"This beer poured a brownish/amber hue with a smaller than expected white head. Not much lacing. Carbonation is lower than I expected. Smell was quite fruity and yeasty. Taste seemed to be very light at first but then the flavors opened up the more I drank it. Fruity flavors mainly apple is what I noticed. These fruity flavors didn't seem coming from the malts but rather from the yeast. Slight caramel and earthy flavors seem to be what's coming from the malts. Hops become more apparent the more I drank this beer but it never really becomes too bitter (maybe I'm too used to those American IPA's). The balance and drinkability in this beer is extroadinary. The body is light but I do notice a slight roasty, woodsy element to it. This is a beer I could drink all night long at an English pub."
"The drinkability is lowered slightly for its heaviness, but a very good beer nonetheless."
"I could happily spend a rainy day with a good book next to a fire and pop pint after pint of this. Not a huge beer in any respect; just a very flavorful session brew. Me likey."
"Does the yeast live in the casks? Premium beers? I guess that means something else in the UK. I was just a bit insulted by that label, so simplistic and silly sounding. Beers good tho!"
"16.9 ounce bottle."
"Overall a fine English bitter that I'm sure tastes much better from cask or in the motherland. But this does me just fine."
"When poured, it was a hazy brownish reddish copper color with some white foam. The smell of mild roasted malts and some hops, were very evident. There is a taste of the roasted malts and hops with a hint of caramel. The bitter/sweetness in the after taste was pleasant along with taste and flavor of this ale. A pleasant surprise to this ale."
"This is a refreshment for tastebuds that that are accustomed to a good cigar, gin, black coffee and claret. Highly extracted hops and dense layers of roasted grain flavors threaten to unbalance this beer, as it is light bodied to begin with. Still, I feel it manages to make terrific sense. If I were a lawyer I'd drink this stuff."
"Overall Impression: Though it is not highly complex, it is quite a nice beer. The bitterness from the hops and the oak is quite assertive, so it really perks up the tastebuds."
"I had a pint of this at the halfway house in North Camden Town in London. This ale was a light creamy colour with a nice white head. The taste was a nice light blend of honeyed hops and malts. The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth and the drinkability is nice."
"This is just one well made ale."
"Absolutely yummy. I could have several of these, though my wallet would suffer."
"the poms really know how to brew a beer that you can drink a few of without getting too toasted, and marstons pedigree is heading the list. the bottle says better brewed in wood, and to me its no idle boast. its also great to see a brewery of their standing not just maintain but develop the traditions of brewing (the burton union style) with an absloute pearler of a brew here."
"Drinkability  This one is well put together and would make a terrific session beer."
"I still don't drink the bottled version, but now I've moved nearer to Staffordshire, my new local sells good pedigree, and it is a great beer when kept well."
"Medium gold color. Medium head. Aroma is malty and slightly hoppy. A medium bodied bitter. Nice mild malts and slightly bitter hops. Very smooth taste. Sweetish, apples, buttery taste. Very drinkable. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is very smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"Slightly on the full side for the style, it's quite smooth and creamy. All in all, one of the best English Pales I've come across."
" Kind of dry and sweet at the same time(is that possible?) Still for it's shortcomings I could quaff a few on short notice. A huge step up from Boddingtons pub ale and a little better than Tetley's, there's nothing really wrong with a few pint's of Pedigree."
"Color is light orange, not quite amber, closer to yellow, nice off-white foamy head with very tight bubbles and left a skin-like lace. Smell is very faint and soft, not much, mostly light citrus, but very fresh and clean. Taste is good, very subtle flavors of nutty maltiness and easy citrus hoppiness thats dry and sweetly bitter. Its a very easy drinker, light bodied, clean, fresh, and a well balanced malty, nutty, bitter dryness throughout. Smooth and subtle pale thats made for drinkin'."
"Not my style, but very nice....Recomended."
"Fruity apple and pear on the palate and nice bitter finish (which would explain why its called an english bitter), quite tasty indeed, very yummy."
