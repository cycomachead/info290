"O - Underrated English pale ale, and probably BBC's best regular offering. I remember enjoying these many moons ago and I am pleased to see how well this one has held up over time. Would love to see this included in variety packs over the lager. Not as good as the very best English Pales (Fullers, etc.), but solid nonetheless. I can see me picking up a few of these over the course of a year."

"Later edit: I just noticed the freshness date on the bottle. It says best if enjoyed before ""August 2014."" Oops... well I will review this one again soon when I can find a fresh batch."
""
""
"Very good beer. Good taste, consistent flavor."
"In my opinion this tastes ALOT like boston lager, just in an ale (lighter) fare. A wonderful beer for me especially seeing as my favorite beer is the Boston Lager. Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
"Medium body, medium carbonation, leaves a bit of residue that sticks around for awhile."
"Completely over rated beer. I hate the flavor tastes like soap."

"Not bad; taste like an ale!"

"This isn't their original 'Boston Lager' at all as the label is different as well as the brew. This 'English Pale Ale' style brew pours a pretty clear copper-amber in color with about a 1/2 finger white head that settles down to around 2mm after a while. A decent amount of lacing is seen when sipped that sticks to the glass. The aroma is very pleasant and is of grains, biscuit, with a hint of caramel also. More going on with the taste with a hint of fruit (dark?) also. Finishes just a tad dry but good. Actually, wasn't sure how this brew was going to be overall. Medium-bodied with perfect carbonation. Overall, it was good and probably even better on tap."
"I have had roughly two dozen different types of Sam Adams beer and this is in my opinion by far the worst.  Nearly undrinkable, this beer is a disgrace to the brewery."

"A pretty nice ale that delivers a satisfying, easy drinking experience. When you're tired of hop bombs and deep, dark, thick ales won't cut it, this ale should fit the bill. It's always refreshing to find a good tasting, basic beer, and this beer is one of them."

"O - Samuel Adams' Boston Ale is a simple brew that, despite faint fruity yeast esters in the nose, borders on being lager-like with it's dry and crisp finish. Easy drinking and delicious malt breadiness balanced by slightly spicy English hops makes for a nice English-style ale worthy of a pub session."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Beautiful maltness in the scent with a three fingers high foam. The beer lacks some character but is otherwise almost perfect with the long and smoked aftertaste."

"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, best before 7/2014. Pours slightly hazy bright orange copper color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, light nuttiness, golden raisin, pear, apple, herbal, floral, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with well balanced dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, light nuttiness, golden raisin, pear, apple, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Light earthy herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, golden raisin, pear, apple, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Nice balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice English pale ale. Well balanced dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"DATE TASTED: May 3, 2014... GLASSWARE: Kisatsky's Tavern pint... OCCASION: unwinding after the annual M&M Mars Fest in Hackettstown--thanks for the free candy!... APPEARANCE: thick white head the consistency of carwash soap--remains two fingers well after pour; copper orange body with vibrant carbonation--a looker... AROMA: sweet caramel aroma; fragrant hops are bright, soft and alluring without being distinguishable... PALATE: solid, medium-bodied with slight effervescence; highly drinkable, with zero suggestion of alcohol...TASTE: sweet caramel delivers underneath a mellow, soft pine flavor; a stereotypical ale (?), one to set expectations to... OVERALL: a recipe that wins in its simplicity--some bubblegum late in the glass adds to its otherwise ""stock"" profile--shout-out to neighbor Scott for bringing it over!"
""

"Overall- Nice refreshing beer, good balance of malt and hops with a bit of a kick to it. Would buy again and makes me curious to try other Sam Adams beers as we only get this and Boston lager here in N.Z."
"A very drinkable, yet big enough body to not disappoint really anyone of us in the craft beer community. A nice bitterness with enough of a sweetness to not let the bitterness overpower the overall flavor of this almost red ale. This type of beer pretty much goes with just about anything!"

"Overall, a very smooth and drinkable ale from Sam Adams. While I prefer their Boston Lager to this Boston Ale, I'll be picking up more of this beer."
""
"O-Good session beer. If I saw Boston Ale in stores I would buy it here and there. Pass it up half the time. Wouldn't search it out, I'd let it ""come to me"". The beer is a bit watery in taste and feel. But tastes good. Beers of this nature are great to cook with. A good under-achieving beer that you still root for to get better. If only it were timeless..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, not a great beer. Barely a good one, really. It would be a lot more palatable if not for that really prominent tin/copper flavor, which is unfortunate."

""
""
""
""
"O: Overall, I was hoping that this would equate to other ales in the north Atlantic on either coast and I was not disappointed. The best aspects of this brew are the appearance and mouth-feel. I can see buying a case of this two or three times a year to add variety to the stock in my refrigerator."
""
""
""
"Drink it regularily when outside. Very good beer, near the top of my choice, goes nicely with a pot beef or with a beef steak for that reason :-). Nicely bittered, crisp, a bit sweet, refreshing and fresh with a right amount of bubbles. Would definitelly recommend during autmns in Sunshine state."

"I love the foundations of Sammy A....Boston B. The Stock Ale is delicious. The beer pours a nice copper with 1/2 finger thick head that is lacing nicely. The scent is simple...hints of malt mixed with bittering hops. The taste is a nice even ale....seemingly a little lighter in body than the Lager version. Overall this beer is as sessionable as they come...a great stand-by."

"O - This is one of my favorite brews from Sam Adams ever since I had my first pint at a local pub. They tend to get a bad rep for some sub-par brews that take the ""craft"" label and, in my opinion, tarnish what craft beer can be for newcomers. However, this brew make for a delicious sixer at a reasonable price. My mind sees it as a more complex (and sweeter) version of a stock Newcastle. Certainly not the best beer on the planet, but damn good for the style. Bravo Sam Adams."

"So I don't know what spices, hops, or malts are used for this beer, by my brains seems to translate the marriage of them into a sensory reminder of Ragu. It wasn't as cumbersome or off-putting as something like Mama Mia's Pizza Beer; it was actually drinkable and not *that* bad. But it's still something I'll be leaving on the shelf next time."
""

""
""
""

"Overall: This is not a bad ales, but I’ve had a lot better. In fact, I’ve had better beers from Samuel Adams, so I’m more than a little disappointed in this one. It’s decent, but forgettable."

"Bright copper in color, quite clear with a two finger head after the pour that falls to leave a thin layer of fine bubbles and laces a bit. The smell is of caramel and biscuit malts with a bit of citrus and floral hop. The caramel malts are the leader in the taste as well with a full range of smooth buttered biscuit tastes. The malt is balanced by enough earthy floral hop flavor and bitterness to keep things under control and from becoming overly cloying or too sweet. This is a very smooth beer almost creamy in the mouth due to the perfect level of carbonation and its malty nature. In the end this is a really great session beer not challenging by any stretch of the imagination but that is part of what makes this so good. It is simply a great ale that you could literally drink all day without tiring of it."

"Taste/feel: Really a sweet ale on the front, but then the bitterness comes in... and it's an odd bitterness. I'm not sure what I mean by that, but it's almost the metallic bitterness that I get in canned beers that have adjuncts. I don't get it on every sip, but when it comes in, I don't care for it that much. The feel on this one is very good... makes this beer super drinkable. Medium carbonation, and a medium-light body with it. After taste is a lot like Boston Lager with crackery flavors. To be honest, I prefer Boston Ale to Boston Lager... I'm surprised it took me so long to try this beer. Really, really nice, and for a super reasonable price."
""
""
""
"Overall- A pretty good ale. A bit more of earthy and herbal hop then that standard ale, but nothing totally out of the ordinary."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A robust, malty take on an English pale ale. It's similar to Boston Lager in its overall flavor profile: malt forward but still nicely hopped. While a far cry from England's finest, this is a well-made English style ale."

"O -- Very good, straight up ale right here. Like it a lot, wish SA would push it a little more. They do a lot of solid six packs that often slip my mind (black lager, cream stout, and this). It might seem a little boring, but if I was at a party and they were serving this, I would go back again and again. Cheers!"

"O: Easy to drink and sessionable - good flavors and relatively low ABV, reminds me of the local ales I drank when in the UK. Well balanced."
""
"O: Definitely follows the English style more than the American style, but not bad overall. Well balanced and easy to drink. A solid stock ale"

"O: Meh. It's completely middle of the road in every way imaginable. Not too far off from Boston Lager in terms of a similar flavor profile, but somehow not as enjoyable. Just an average beer in all aspects."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: not bad. However, I think I would only have this again on tap."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I liked this one pretty well. I think my issue is that there are simply beers I like better than this one. Not saying it is poorly brewed, but I probably would choose another beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is nice and refreshing but maybe a little sweet- medium body, light prickly carbonation. This is a pretty good offering from Sam Adams, good session beer. A little too sweet for me."
"Overall, its a very tasty beer that I will buy again. Its very enjoyable and I will purchase it again. I enjoy the caramel and herbal hop taste and aroma."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"12oz bottle, pours copper in color with a tall frothy ivory head that holds excellent retention and leaves lacing rings all the way down the glass. Aromas are malty, bready, caramel, herbal hop. Tastes are nutty, earthy, caramel, herbal hop, bready malt. Mouth-feel is medium bodied, sharp, and crisp. Overall, loved the appearance of this one, decent APA and what I expected from this brewery."
"Red/Copper in color. Minimal lacing. Smell is mostly buiscity malts, molasses, rasins. Tastes is similar, nice smooth breadyness, very similar to boston lager, but a bit less roasted, and more spicey with a little more of a citrus hop kick as opposed to grassy hop kick. Minimal hops though. One of the weaker ones in the lineup."

"Overall: this one is much more drinkable than Boston Lager. The flavor and hop character is better than expected as I feel this is the best year-round Samuel Adams beer."
""
""
""
"Overall / Drinkability: I think overall, it's just okay. On the good side - very nice lacing but a bit of a weak color and a good mouthfeel. On the weak side - smell is weak (almost non existent) and the taste is balanced but not good enough to make up for the lack of aroma. So just okay. Drinkability - I can't see getting this again. Oh well - not every beer can be great."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is an easy drinking APA, but it lacks the depth and character of some of the others on the market. The caramel is overly sweet and a bit sticky and the hops are more subtle and can't stand up to the sweetness. Overall, it's not bad but there are better."

"This is truly one of my favorite pale ales. You can never go wrong with a fresh 6 pack of Boston Ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The palate, however, isn't quite there. Opening with a surprising level of hop flavor, with rose water, green leaves and twigs, it does take me by surprise. The mid-palate follows with some malt character, not quite as balanced as on the nose. Biscuit, caramel and Vienna malt are present, though it does feel a little watery here. Drying and quite bitter on the finish with dried herbs, and a level of Hallertauer bitterness that almost seems overdone. Medium-light in body with moderate carbonation, this beer is quite nice. Not an APA by any stretch of the imagination, but as a beer, it's a success."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall - 4.5/5 - Seems to be what Bud's American Ale was aiming for, but of course, done to Samuel Adams level of quality. All I would ask of this beer would be a tiny bit more hops, but it's quite wonderful as is."

"Pours deep amber with a fluffy off-white head. there's a strong aroma of malt. The sweet malt flavor is well balanced with the bitterness from the hops. There's a pleasant medium mouthfeel. This is a very well balanced, drinkable beer from start to finish."
""
""
""
"Pours a clean orange-ish to copper color with an off white head. In the aroma, a small, sweet gingerbread like malt. In the taste, a small sweetness that rides through the mellow maltiness of gingerbread. A small bite and a medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry spice in the aftertaste. A bit spicy, but just about average for an ale."
"O - This isn't the best beer in the world, but it's a solid choice. When faced with the decision between this and some piece of crap BMC-whatever ... choose this beer every time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This style was always my favorite of the SA line when I was just getting into craft beers. Haven't tried it in a few years. It's still a great beer; very sessionable. Wonder why it's not as readily available as all the other SA flavors. I'll be having more, soon."
""
"A pretty solid and simple straightforward brew from the Sam Adams gang."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Very disappointing. It seems (or am I just hoping?) that the beer was not fresh as it would explain the lack of hops and the malt presence."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O - Pretty damn good stuff. This is a good go to beer if nothing else better is available. Not to say this beer can't stand amongst the greats."

"Appearance is amber, light and clear. Smell is smooth and clean to the nose. This is a nicely hopped APA. The mouthfeel is great with the right balance of hops and is lingers well, wow. Taste is well blended and hit the tongue in all the right places. Overall this is a well brewed American Pale Ale, one worth having in the fridge. This brew will leave you wanting more. Eat some peanuts."
""
"Overall: An excellent brew and something to grab if I'm in the mood for something malty, cheap, and good."

"I poured this Carmel colored concoction right after I finished a Dogfish 60 Minute IPA. It was a terrific transition. Sam Ale had a cherry, malt, sweetness that I don't think I would have enjoyed if I didn't start with an IPA. Great head and lacing. Sudsy mouthfeel. An all around great brew. I will keep it in the fridge at all times."

"I like this beer simply because its a very malty beer that I enjoy drinking. it seems to be a beer for anybody whether you like extra hops or whatever. I normally like extra hoppiness but this has little of that but I still really like it. by the way the mouth feel is very smooth and not harsh so its very smooth. give this one a try."

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a bronze color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some malts detected. Taste is also very mild, some malts, very lightly hopped, not very big on flavor. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall this is a mediocre beer."
"Overall: More ""just OK"" stuff from SA. That being said, this beer has no real flaws and I feel like it would be excellent on cask...I'll keep on the lookout for that."
"The beer is transparent and orange hued, with a half inch of white head that leaves some decent lacing on the glass. The aroma is rather weak, offering faint scents of lightly sweetened malts, biscuits, bread. The flavor is a bit sweet, but not too. Bready and malty, with only a light hop presence evident in the finish. Easy to drink, but not the most exciting flavor. I would prefer a bit less sweetness in favor of some hop bitterness and/or biscuit flavors. Decent feel. Light to medium bodied. Overall, a decent beer and worth a try, though I prefer the Samuel Adams Boston Lager."
"SOLID, NOT MUST HAVE!"
"Pours an Amber color that’s clear with some head that dissipates relatively soon (not instant but certainly not holding on for too long). Smells like a Sam Adams, nothing too special but better than a generic lager. The taste really holds up on this beer, it’s very balanced and while there’s not all that much going on except for some caramel malts, is never fads during the mouthful nor does it taste to watery. I don’t usually drink the Boston Ale as I prefer to go for something that has more flavor but this beer really holds up and doesn’t fall apart which I find to be quite rare for a generic non-flavored ale. Certainly something to have around for a refreshing day."
"from a six pack. Poured a nice dark red color, with a bit of creamy white head. Pretty standard all around, both on the nose and on the palate. Some earthy hops, sweet malt, a little caramel and an easy drinking medium body. Not bad but not much more."
"I usually feel like Boston Brewing Company makes good drinks, but this is not one of them. It's just so far from being special and memorable. Its not completely horrible, but I feel bad that I bought a 6 pack of this. I feel like I have to give the rest of these to people who don't have taste and I could only hope that they enjoy it because I won't."
"Orange with a fair bit of lacing and a strong caramel smell. Earthy hops, biscuit/caramel malt, some bitter hop oils. I found that it became too sweet throughout the glass, so I'm marking it down a bit for that. Creamy in the mouth with good carbonation. Nothing particularly memorable, but a solid, classic, enjoyable session ale."
"O- I think that this deserves much more praise, and likely gets looked over due to Boston Lager."
"A very balanced and sessionable pale ale. I've had this on a few occasions and wouldn't hesitate to go back to it."
"Overall: It’s pretty generic ale with the classic Sam Adam’s hop twist. The crispness and roasted malt help give it a little personality. Try it if you see it."
"O- A solid pale ale, esp. if hop overkill is not your style."
"EDIT: I didn't really like this beer, so I made the mistake of letting it sit for about an hour. Warmer, this beer is absolutely foul. Drink as cold as possible!"
"Overall: This is one of the more balanced Ales I have had in awhile but being so balanced can make you average. Good beer all around."
"RJT"
"O - Overall a perfectly passable offering. Yet another example of BBC making a beer that is a great introduction to a style, but with little risk or excitement involved."
"The appearance was good, a nice amber color, a fluffy white head with some light foamy lacing. The smell is of caramel malts a little hops but not very prominent. The body is medium light with carbonation. The taste is good, some malty sweetness followed by a little hoppy bitterness on the way down (which was more than expected from the smell). Overall this is a good beer, I prefer the Boston Lager but this is one I'll get again, an easy to drink tasty beer."
"Notes: This version of an English Bitter is a great American Beer, full of sublety, balance and flavor. This is two thirds the price of Fuller's London Pride but every bit as flavorful and refreshing. Widely available, affordable and delicious this ranks up there with GLBC Edmund Fitzgerald as one of the great contributions to Brewcraft. I love this beer."
"M/O: Crisp and refreshing session style beer with great aroma/flavor and texture."
"This brew pours out as a an amber color with a white head on top. The beer looks pretty clean and crisp looking. The smell is a little less hoppy as the Boston Lager. The taste of the beer is good, it's a little bit lighter. Overall it's a good ale, it probably won't ever have the popularity of the Lager but is deserves a fair chance."
"O/D-Nothing bad to be said about this one, I find Boston Lager to be superior to this beer however. I just can't see myself going into a liquor store and coming out with a six-pack of this. Just doesn't wow me enough. But if anyone is looking for a mellow, easy drinker, give this a shot."
"M/D: This is where im giving big points. Its silky smooth and could drink this all day. Very enjoyable!!!!"
"This was decent. Maybe a touch too earthy and bitter in spots but this seems mostly well balanced for the most part and the crisp yet smooth body helped keep this fairly approachable. Ultimately though, if I was going to buy of sixer of something from Sam Adams, I’d just settle for their Lager."
"Color certainly isn't pale but rather a light amber. Head is fairly big and lacing is present. Smell is of hops and flowers and there is actually a bit of a roasted smell there too. The taste threw me off a little bit. The hops that are present in the style are there but not as ""forward"" as other types. A bit of spiciness too. Mouthfeel is very smooth. I think I would prefer its cousin, the SA Pale Ale, over this. The Boston Ale isn't bad but perhaps a little average."
"It's been many years since I had this one, and I used to think it was fairly hoppy. No more, but that doesn't make it a bad beer; will definitely come back to this more often, as it is a tasty, sessionable beer, something that is getting hard to find these days."
"D - Only gave it a three because it's not quite as drinkable as it should be considering the low ABV. That said, wouldn't have a problem doing at least two."
"Not a bad beer, poured into a tumbler with that classic head to be expected from Sam Adams above the orange copper body. Head leaves behind some lacing. A little biscuit-y/metallic in the nose with a herbal hop note as well. As the brew warms, of course the metal fades. The taste follows through but all in all, these two senses are mild. Decent body, with good carbonation. A good, sessionable beer, but I want more from it."
"D- great drinkable beer. Nothing else about it."
"has in between a golden and amber look to it. Smell of some caramel. Taste of apricot and caramel. The mouthful says it all. A sweet feeling and taste that begs you to drink more and more. Drinkabilty is fine, Goes down easy and able to drink a good six pack"
"Drinkabilty: Very heavy, but drinkable. This would be a one or two brew, very hearty."
"Summary: This is a good beer. I gave it 7.9/10 or C+. I like the color and appearance. I'm particularly impressed in the head. It has a nice smell to it. This beer works my appetite up and makes me hungry, which makes me think it would be great with appetizers for company. This being the first ale I've tasted with no other ales to compare it too, I would say this is a fine ale and I would drink it again."
"Defintely a quality brew to quaff."
"D - I had 2 and that was enough for me. I wouldn't seek it out again, but I wouldn't turn it down either."
"Its good, but not great."
"Bought this on a whim this afternoon, and it REALLY hit the spot. Lots of flavor, with a normal ABV which allows for maximum enjoyment with minimum revenge later on. Excellent!"
"A very drinkable ""good"" beer that isn't complex but also avoids being boring. This isn't something I would seek out, but I would certainly enjoy it if someone handed it to me."
"Drinkability: Certainly aesthetically pleasing, but the bitterness ends up dominating the taste, although the caramel malt and fruity flavor adds mild complexity. Though it may be of no surprise to some, Boston Ale is an entirely different beast in comparison to Boston Lager, which is a good thing to bear in mind if you consider drinking this beer."
"This is great, reminds me of some scottish and english ales."
"More caramel malts carry the load here, hops in place but not on the assertive side. I get a more Brit. style take on things here. Minor citrus notes. Tasty and highly sessionable ale. Respectable if unspectacular offering. Would work fine in a lack of higher quality craft beer pinch."
"Poured into a perfect pint glass straight from the bottle. A small head that doesn't linger too long. The aroma was bitter sweet. There was author bit of hop to it, but it could have been more. It was Very smooth going down, but it could had a little bit more of something else. A sweet caramel/honey after taste that lingers on the palate."
"Cheers!!"
"Drinkability - not a bad tasting brew at all, but not terribly complex in the taste either. Not many surprises. But again, nice taste."
"I enjoy this over Boston Lager."
"session friendly and goes well with burgers and such."
"Under a finger of foam settles over a deep golden to copper-hued beer. Aromas are actually more European than I expected ... mildly cooked grains come to mind. Toasted biscuit. Flavors are a bit metallic, and biscuity. Caramel sweetness is heavily present with a bit of warmth. This beer is listed under APA, but it seems like more of an english style. Not sure I'd go out of my way for this one."
"The beer gushes upon opening. Once calmed down, it pours an orange-amber color with a white head. The aroma is heavy on the biscuit malt, with a little bit of grassy and citrus hop notes. The flavor is biscuit and bread malt, with a touch of grass and orange notes. Low bitterness. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"D- A nice beer that is enjoyable. The smell is the best part of this beer and it has a very nice smell. I would not go out of my way to get this beer, but would definitely drink it at a bar or party with limited selection."
"Verdict: An enjoyable selection when you are financially limited or unable to make the pilgrimage to a specialty store, easy to drink in moderate amounts but lacks the character and depth that I am looking for in my ultimate choice Ale. Regardless, a decent Ale for any average run-of-the-mill beer drinker. B (3.75)"
"12 oz bottle. Pours an amber with a small but long lasting head. Aroma of mostly earthy hops with some bread and caramel malt notes. Medium body with soft carbonation. Flavor starts with moderate herbal hops which faints to a sweet caramel malt, lasting finish. I have drank this beer for years and just love it the same as Boston Lager."
"One of Sam Adams's best beers in my opinion. Good hoppy flavor, without being as bitter as the Sierra Nevada Pale Ale that I normally get. Only have one at my disposal so not sure about its drinkability, but would definately recommend this one to BA members."
"D: Tastes like a light English ale to me. There are some interesting flavors, though subdued. Easily a session beer for these reasons, but I prefer something more vibrant"
"This is an american pale ale? This is far closer to a British bitter in my opinion. It's a good session beer, nothing over the top. A crowd pleaser. Would score higher as a bitter than an American pale ale."
"Notes: Interesting to finally taste and rate this beer which I did not see in stores for a very long time!"
"D-this actually has a very thick body for the abv. it'll take a lot to get you drunk but it doesn't take a lot to fill up your stomach. i had a 16 ounce from the tap...which i enjoyed...but i do not want a second one."
"Drinkability: A pretty good beer- but far from a great pale ale. This one has good flavor to start with, but then finishes just tasting like, well, beer with little nuance. Still, this can make for good sessioning and is a step up from the BMC norm."
"drinkable, but not worth seeking out again."
"Drinkability: Easy as easy gets. Not too bitter, not too heavy. You could drink the whole thing before you know it, and you wouldn't feel bad restocking. This is one I always want to have just sitting around."
"Pours a amber with a nice creamy offwhite head. Aroma of malt, caramel, some light fruitiness. Taste is malt and caramel with some light hops. Palate is nice med body with moderate carbonation. Finish is caramel malt nicely balance by some light hops. This a very nice all around Ale. Would drink again."
"Can't really complain about this beer. Pours a nice semi-dark amber color with a bit of head. On the nose slight toasted malts with a bit of caramel sweetness and grain. The taste is pretty smooth with a nice sweetness and malt with a touch of bitter hops in the taste. With the mouth-feel being moderate this beer is easily drinkable but hoppy ales are more appreciated in my book."
"D - The drinkability is decent. It goes down easy, and it's pretty refreshing. It's a decent beer, but easily forgettable."
"Another solid BBC beer, I wouldn't go after this if you're looking for a typical APA, but if you're looking for something between a brown ale and an English pale ale, this might be for you."
"Sam Adam's Boston Ale honestly hits about the average mark, as an APA and a beer overall. It is flavorful and full bodied, but really nothing to write home about."
"From the bottle to my glass, to my mouth, yum. Lovely brownish amber color with a one finger head. Color is a 12 on the SRM chart. Head is a light tan, with about two minute lasting power. Light, lace with little cling. Aroma of honey, citrus, lilac, golden wheat, sweet malt and green hops. Flavor is a well balanced refinement of wheat, citrus, malt, and a crisp edge of hops. Smooth, creamy feeling in my mouth with a great amount of tingle. One of the better ale's I have had, good drinkability, widely available, good price."
"Overall, this is a pretty good representation of an APA, albeit a little different from others. Not as hop forward as some in the style, but very balanced and well put-together on all fronts. I would probably buy this again if the price was right and I couldn't get to a SNPA. I might like this better than Boston Lager, too... I'll have to experiment some more with both in the future."
"D- Overall this is an ok brew but nothing special."
"Poured from the bottle into a snifter a reddish copper color with a whitish head that laced an average amount. Smell is malty primarily caramel malts. Taste is similar with caramel the noticed flavor and a hint of roasted malts in the background. Feel is quite carbonated with a medium body. Overall a good beer."
"This beer is a refresher and very drinkable, and goes down easy...if for no other reason that the flavors are somewhat restrained and how cleanly it finishes. It won't blow anybody away I'm sure, but I approve."
"This Sam Adams Boston ale pours a golden amber color with a decent head of foam. It has a surprisingly light taste but with a heavier mouthfeel. It does drink very smooth, but there's just something missing in the taste. It's a good beer to have a few of here and there. I would basically consider it a high end Miller Lite."
"Doesn't blow me away but I could genuinely enjoy drinking this regularly."
"A watery stock ale? A rather odd APA? I have no idea what this beer is. Not much nose on this one and what there is isn't great. Pours like most sam adams, large but thin bodied head, lots of carbonation and this one is a dark amber copper color. Taste...well it's like a watery stock ale with some European style pale ale characteristics...which begs why this is called an APA. Sierra, stone, and every other great American brewer is doing a face palm at this being called an APA. It's not as drinkable as you'd think given everything else and the mouth feel is a bit off for the flavors. I just feel this is a failed beer that's got a lot of potential."
"Boston Ale poured a amber color, with a small head that presistet throught out the beer. It had a unquie smell very hard to describe. The taste was slightly strong, very unquie not too many flavors to pick out, but had a nice initial bite to it. Pretty easy to drink, but not really for the new palatee. Overall not a bad beer, different."
"D-Wow, this is one of those ridiculously easy drinking, really flavorful beers that's a personal favorite when I can find it."
"Recommended. Sort of."
"Pours an almost-clear golden amber color with a big white head. Scent is roasted malts with a decent amount of barley and light hops. A bit of sweetness as well. Taste is light caramel with some great malty flavors. The hops are present, but very well-balanced. I feel like this beer's flavor is extremely complex and well-balanced. I get some nice roasted flavors as well. Mouthfeel is extremely light, but full at the same time (if that makes any sense). Drinkability is quite high. I could definitely put a sixer of this away in one setting."
"D - This is a beer I used to love to quaff in the bottle, it is slightly different on tap, while the malt brings to mind a red, the hops are full enough in the taste to justify the pale categorization - a tasty brew, but average drinkability wise. I would probably choose others before this"
"Mouthfeel is medium with a smooth amount of carbonation."
"A moderate degree of carbonation cuts the medium heavy body and the lingering orangy sweetness leaving a cleaner than expected palate and lending some repeat drinkability in this otherwise undemanding and somewhat uninteresting brew."
"Well, I think I'd say this may be better than Boston lager, or at least on par for what it brings to the table. I can't say that I would seek this beer out, or the rest of the Sam Adams line, due to the price tag, but if I had no other option at a bar, this would be it."
"D- All in all a decent pale ale. Nothing overly complex or demanding. A good reliable beer."
"Decent drinkability, a little heavy, but crisp. Would get again."
"This is a very drinkable brew. I prefer most beer at warmer serving but this one shines at 40F."
"As many beers from the Boston Beer company a bit too sweet - but not bad."
"Another fantastic brew from the Boston Beer Company."
"D - Good but I prefer the bold grapefruit & rind like characteristics in other APA's. Average drinkability I'd say, not bad but I'm not going out of my way to buy this one again."
"D - Only gave it a three because it's not quite as drinkable as it should be considering the low ABV. That said, wouldn't have a problem doing at least two."
"Nice and crisp, but still complex for a lower abv beer."
"I poured into a pint glass. It had a nice copper/orange color to it. It didn't have a lot of head, that lay to a nice lace around the top. The smell is a nice roasted malt. Has a great taste that is malty and of biscuit. This beer has a nice mouth feel and great drink ability."
"D- this goes down well. The flavor is very light but still quite good. There is no question that many of these can be put down and enjoyed at the same time"
"All together it is a good beer, however it does not stand out from the rest of the Samuel Adams line. For better or for worse it has that same signature taste that you expect from Sam Adams."
"The flavor is sweet and malty with a slightly fruity undertone. The hops are floral and grassy, and lead to a mildly bitter finish. Medium bodied and moderately carbonated. Easy to drink and refreshing."
"D- A little sweet for my tastes, but it is nice for a change of pace. Surprisingly rich for the alcohol content. Well made and worth trying."
"D - This is a beer that I wouldn't mind having again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to look for it."
"Morey's Bottom Line: A good ale. Nothing flashy or extremely memorable, but if your looking for a good session beer with flavor, this could be your huckleberry."
"D - Pretty solid, but not something I'd buy extremely often; would drink if offered to me ;)"
"Notes: This is an ok beer. I was looking for more after the promising start. It definitely isn't bad, just about average."
"pours a transparent copper color with a good half inch of white head. light carbonation and light lacing. has a slightly hoppy smell and taste that is also a tad bit bitter. average beer with average taste. not terrible but by no means great. probably wouldn't drink again unless it was the best thing available."
"This was just okay for me. Not as hoppy as I would like for an apa. Would not purchase again."
"Overall: Boston Ale might be the best gateway beer for anyone wanting to try Sam Adams. In other words, its a more neutral version of Boston Lager."
"A very nice everyday beer that I always enjoy-good work Sam..."
"This was the first ""craft"" brew I tried back in 1993 on tap at the Bull and Finch pub in Boston. The front of the pub was used in the sitcom, ""Cheers"". It is not as complex and heavy as I remembered it back then, but that was hundreds of beers ago."
"Nice and malty, with a decent hoppy backdrop -- though a bit more hopped up would've been nice (might've been bordering on an ESB then). That does speak to its incredible smoothness and balance though. Wonderful medium mouthfeel with an easy-drinking quality."
"This is a very sessionable brew, and would be a great party brew. Another good brew from SA."
"Drinkability is good. It goes down easy and is fairly refreshing. Would make a decent session beer but I've certainly had more impressive examples of the style. A good stand by if others I liked weren't available."
"A solid ale from Samuel Adams. Will definitely be a crowd pleaser. Caseworthy to say the least."
"Light body, slightly bitter, but thin on the finish. A solid, if mostly average APA."
"Pours golden amber and produces a multiple inch head that settles very gradually, leaving a look of soft-peak egg-whites with a hint of tan. The nose suggests yeast and hops, but is lacking in the expected ale esters. Belgian lace does form. The ody is medium-light with a modest malt and hop lingering. Very quaffable, but uninspiring. I will not decline this ale if offered, but I will neither seek it out nor order it."
"drinkabiility - to me this is SA's best year round"
"Overall: A fine offering, but a disappointment for me. I greatly respect Samuel Adams as a brewery of mass-produced products that still retain the taste of small-batch beer, and this doesn't seem to be up to the standard to me."
"Another good offering from Sam, bought the mix pack, Brewmaster, and I've been happy with it. Red colored ale, nice pour, the foam is a bit obnoxious, or at least on the one I just had, good taste, smooth going down and smooth finish. Taste is good to very good, tasted like an irish red to me, but a god one. Seemed like a classic beer for the city of Boston, they should sell this and 12 packs and get it in more bars here are St. Patty's day."
"Drinkability: A solid beer. This one falls squarely into SA's lineup. I've found that while most of SA's beers aren't outstanding, they are solid and faithful representations of the style. This beer isn't life-changing but it's pretty solid."
"Pours orange copper with around a finger of cream colored head. Plenty of retention and fairly high carbonation evident and decent lace. The aroma is toasty and somewhat nutty with a bit of a nondescript hoppy bite in the middle. The flavor has a pretty strong balance between toasty malt character and some bitter hops with a touch of earth and citrus. Finish has bitter citrus and earthy cookielike malts. Pretty well balanced yet also unapologetically bitter. Nice flavors. Moderately full in body but the carbonation is too prickly and harsh. Quite a balanced ale, however none of the the flavors really pop or tickle my palate. Decent brew but not so thrilling."
"Golden amber in color and a thin lacy head. Moderate carbonation provides a pleasant mouth feel. Nothing outstanding in the aroma, some minor floral notes. Good malty sweetness upfront gives way to a nice hop floral taste. The aftertaste is a nice lasting combination of the sweet and bitter. Overall this is a nice balanced brew worth of spot in the fridge."
"I'm not quite sure what others will say, but this beer reminds me of the Boston Lager. Aside from the obvious differences between yeast, I found the overall taste to be quite similar. However, I think that the Ale is a bit more smooth and a bit less crisp than the Lager. I'm quite pleased with this beer. In the future, I would love to do a side-by-side tasting because I'm not sure if I experienced some sort of ""memory bias"" during the tasting."
"D: In a great range for a sessioner. Easy to put back and while not terribly interesting, its a good beer."
"I poured this bottle into a glass, and the head stayed a while (didn't count as my kids were driving me crazy). I liked the taste. I am becoming more of Sam's fan, surprosing since I remember not caring for Sam's original beer that much, but the last two ales (this one and the Scott) have been good. I got this one in a 12 pack variety model and am enjoying it immensely."
"Overall, I believe this is one of the best beers with a Samuel Adams label. Once again, I'm perfectly satisfied. I plan on keeping a steady supply of Boston Ale in my fridge. This would be a great beer as part of the transitioning process to more extreme beers, for a less experienced drinker. For me, it's simply a great, satisfying beer to fall back on and it always satisfies."
"Had this once before from a Summer pack, it was the best one of that bunch, and so far this is the best of the current bunch. Better than Fat Tire, cheaper too."
"D - could have a few of these, just not sure if i'd really care to. im more of a fan of hoppy APA's and this one drinks more like a lighter Amber ale. not bad, but there are plenty of Samuel Adam's beers i prefer."
"Drinkability: This beer was middle of the road for me but sometimes I think there's nothing wrong with that. I don't think every beer should blow your socks off with flavors. I would probably grab this at a bar when not feeling adventurous and just in the mood to pound beers with some buddies."
"O: Who labeled this an APA?! The closest style this beer relates to is more like an American Amber. Simple, though enjoyable beer."
"This was an okay one. Not my favorite Sam Adams, but it was fine, nonetheless. Pours orange/yellow with a white head that stays and stays. The smell was fine. Malt and bread. Taste is VERY bready with a rather bitter aftertaste. Carbonation is good. I could drink a few of these, though again, they're not my favorite. Refrigerated well, and on a hot day, I think it would be the best way for this one."
"In the Chicago market, I've noticed that this one is becoming a little more difficult to find. Six packs seem to be rare, although I always seem to get a few Boston Ale bottles in a mix pack or the like. It's a shame since I really like this Sam Adams classic. Pours light amber in color and leaves a light lacing on my standard pint glass. These are very drinkable and as many others have stated, I wish this one was easier to find on tap. Everywhere I go seems to have Sam Lager, Sam Light, or a Sam seasonal (white, summer, Oktober). Would be nice to see this one make a comeback."
"Drinkability: Easy drinking ale. This may be an old-fashioned ""American Stock Ale", but it is essentially an English Pale Ale that has been lagered. Simple, but nice."
"Poured from the bottle this beer was a darker gold/amber color with between average/large head and average lacing. I got this in the brewmaster collection and while it certainly wasnt the best of the bunch it was an all around decent beer. This beer had a good taste but I did not like the way it finished. The mouthfeel was also good (not too watery or carbonated) but overall it's nothing special. A solid beer from SA but not their best work."
"Drinkability- Not bad, not the most exciting beer in the world but I'd have a second if there was nothing else around."
"Value: Eh."
"Notes: Nothing over the top or incredibly impressive, but a nice brew that would probably be great on tap. Probably a nice one to keep around in the fridge for some easy drinking."
"Drink: Nice, light and refreshing. easily drinkable. But as an American Pale Ale...meh."
"Poured into a pint glass, amber with a frothy head that dissipated quickly. Smell is bready and caramely, some oily hops notes. Very carbonated up front, light and then moving to a malty body, with some sweet caramel and slight citrus notes. Sweet balanced by dry hops in the finish. Not bad at all, worthy beer, worth keeping around as a session beer."
"Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass. Good looking beer, light amber color with excellent clarity. It has an orange creamy colored head that produces great lacing. A very good looking beer. For this style of beer, it's incredibly malted in my opinion and it really shows in the smell. It has a sweet caramelized/toffee smell followed by some earthy pine hops. Really well balanced in the smell, pretty impressive. The taste is much like the smell. Sweet initially from the caramelized malts has a toffee and buttery taste as well then the hops follow to provide a nice flavor. It's an incredibly well balanced ale. It's I'd say medium bodied, but I must say I'm impressed on how light it feels for how well malted it is. It has a buttery smooth feel that has a nice bitter finish from the hops. With all that's going on it's really drinkable. I'd love to have it on tap on a nice hot summer day."
"D-Pretty drinkable brew. We bought some of this for a party at work trying to steer clear of the BMC stuff....Solid and roundly enjoyed."
"Clear orange amber with a finger of eggshell head that leaves scraps of lace on the glass. The nose is biscuity malt, bubblegum and minty hops. This brew is very similar to BBC's flagship Boston lager but in ale form, hoppier and a little more flavor concentration in general. Medium bodied with a slightly bitter finish. A good beer that is almost forgotten."
"An underrated brew,this is a really tasty ale - perhaps a notch better than the signature Boston Lager."
"D: Very solid ale, something I could see myself picking up a sixer of in the summertime. Easy and mellow beer, very good overall."
"D -- Very good. What can you say about this beer, but it's a nice drinker. I mentioned Goose Island Honker's above, this is a good counterpart."
"This ale goes down so easy and tastes so agreeable. I could drink a ton of these. A great fall-back beer."
"Drinkability: High, with a light body and complex flavors it is definitely worth trying again."
"Drinkability: This wasn't bad, but the flavors were all very muted. It went down quickly and easily, but there wasn't a whole lot of flavor behind it. Not a bad APA, but not one I would seek out actively again."
"D: I prefer this to the Boston lager, a nice well balanced full flavored brew that isn't too robust or bold, just a nice easy drinking ale"
"This was a good beginner beer for me a few years ago because the caramel/toffee flavors are so easy to identify, but I don't think I'll be going back to this any time soon."
"This is a middle of the road beer. Drinkable enough, but hasn't kept my attention much. It's an okay beer to drink, but not real interesting to think about. I'd categorize it as an English Pale Ale in style, but perhaps the ingredients suggest otherwise."
"Pours a clear copper with a fluffy white head with excellent retention. Malts dominate the nose. Smells like toast. The palate is also malt-forward with a nice earthiness lending the flavor some backbone. Toffee lingers long on the finish. Overall a very enjoyable beer."
"Good session beer for a football afternoon. Don't know that I'd pick it over many other things given a decent tap list."
"CHEERS!"
"Drinkability: Smooth, no bitterness, the caramel really gives it a candy flavor to the beer."
"Drinkability - I am pretty hapy with the beer overall. It's not something I would choose everyday, but I have no problem sipping on a few."
"This beer is all over the place. The aroma and appearance is average but the flavor is rather special. Overall it's good but still more interesting than exceptional."
"D: Very drinkable, this one is easy going down. Flavors blend well together."
"Overall: I would recommend this beer. It's not the cream of the Samuel Adams crop, but it's very solid."
"Pours a nice clear slightly coppery amber with a fairly thick and somewhat persistent white head. Aroma is malty and just a little bit fruity with a whisper of sweet. Malty and slightly fruity flavor has a hoppy and bitter undertone. Texture is smooth and just a little fizzy."
"For a pale ale this certainly has a lot of body and good flavor. It's sort of like the Boston Lager but a tad lighter with a bit of added spice. It's a red/brown mix color with a bunch of head and good carbonation. The aroma is slightly malty with cinnamon added. The flavor is comparable. It's rather smooth and finishes with a good sweetness. I'll definitely have this one again."
"Look: Amber color with orange shades, very good amount of creamy foam; Smell: Perfumed with floral hops and sweet malt; Taste: Roasted malt, biscuity, citric hops, very tasty; Mouthfeel: Slightly dry, medium bitterness, medium body and carbonation; Drinkability: Was the first beer i drink from this excellent brewery."
"Highly drinkable, classic Sam Adams."
"This is a good round malty stock ale, not really a good APA, more like an amber. Very easy drinker with a bready malt flavor, the hop nose is soft, light, not bright, more malt forward, kind of an amber look, good lace, with a nice medium heavy mouthfeel. Finish is full and balaced. If I'm seeking an APA this is not it, if I want a nice session drinker closer to an amber ale heck yes."
"Pours a dark amber with a beige head that quickly dissipates. Aroma was pretty weak, couldn't get to much out of it other than some malts. Taste was a bit plain. Some malty bits initially with some hoppiness to finish off. Neither was particularly strong. Also, a little bit too thin going down. Overall not bad, but not great either."
"Mouthfeel, eh, you can get it down, because it is ilghter on the malt end, it makes it a little more drikable than your average SA earthy wood minus hops experience."
"Hey, I like some hops bitter, but give it some flavor or balance, too. I find Boston Ale unsatisfying."
"D - it is kinda drinkable"
"Thoughts- This beer is a mind bender at best it is well balanced and easy to drink, but will not make you say, WOW."
"Serving type: 12oz bottle, 12-pack"
"D: Decent. I would probably have it again, but Boston Lager is better and much more available."
"MF/D: Slightly overcarbonated for my liking, medium in body, metallic/bready lingering finish"
"D: Like many sam adams beer this is very easy to drink multiple of."
"Not as citrusy or bitter as the Boston Lager. More subdued and mellow yet still hoppy. Dry and crisp with a heavy feel and low carbonation. Slight spice and vanilla in the taste with an amber ale quality to it. Very drinkable and equal to the Boston lager in that way. Better than the Lager in some ways, not in others."
"Serving type: Bottle"
"The drinkability is high, and the mellow taste is rather easy to digest, providing you like ale. I would, however, desire some more complexity in the taste, and I feel that the beer goes down a little too fast."
"I like this beer. Appearance is deep and rich coppery color, lacing is nice and consistent. Smell is both malt and hop, kinda lightly astringent, but not unpleasantly so, by any means...just aromatic. Taste is pleasant and smooth, some bitter and some sweet blended nicely. Mouthfeel is filling but not overly so, I don't feel like I'm chewing a steak by any means. Drinkability is better than average for a beer like this, I could drink this for a few hours and not get bored."
"A good beer that always seems better on tap, but the bottle version is also a pretty good standard beer. It's a very drinkable and enjoyable beer with above average flavor, and is a good representation of a classic American ale."
"Sam Adams is so well known for it's Boston Lager and I think the ale often gets over looked. I had both the Ale and Lager back to back the other day. It's not the best Pale Ale out there but, like all of Boston Beer's selctions, a very solid beer that's always great to have. Very good Sam flavor, darker than a typical pale ale but very nice in look. Very tasty and a good amount of hops."
"The smel featured a soft sweet caramel malt with a smattering of aroma hops. The taste was upfront sweet caramel with a semi-dry grassy hop finish. Decent doughy finish. The mouthfeel was light with a very dry finish. Overall a very drinkable and sessionable ale. Easy and simpl"
"Drinkable?- Certainly. This is a great session beer, and a great standard to keep in your fridge. A six pack of this would keep you satisfied for sure. Goes down easy and crisp, yet has the body to keep you interested. Another great offering from the Boston Beer Company."
"It is poured an amber color with touches of orange along the sides the glass. A half inch head forms on top that is cream in color. The head stays there for some time. Malty and bread fragrances hit the nose at first scent. That is then overtaken by the strong scents of grass and pine. The malt flavor flows across the palate for a hearty bread and biscuit flavors. Then as hits the back of the palate a mild bitterness hits, mostly of grass and touches of tobacco. A medium bodied feel and staying that way evenly all the way through. This is an easy to drink beer the color and look are make you thirsty, the aroma makes you want to take a sip. Then the flavor makes you to keep drinking and the feel makes you glad beer is the best beverage on earth, a great session beer."
"Drinkability: I could easily get through several of these - it's really a nice tasting beer with that butterscotch sweetness and the complimenting flavors - the ABV is also pretty manageable at a lower 4.9%."
"It didn't shake me by the collar, as a good ale should, and I may not remember it so much tomorrow; however, Samuel Adams Boston Ale was a pleasure to drink today."
"Pours a nice golden color, nice head to it... tons of lacing down the glass. Nice hoppy smell to it.. very IPA like. Taste is pretty good more light bodied than heavy, some nice floral notes can be detected, nice hop bitterness on the tongue. Sweet finish to this one, maybe a little too sweet. I remember having this back in the day and absolutely hating it. While I don't think it's a great beer by any means, it's definitely in the 'pretty good' category... I guess I matured, eh? No surprise here, a solid beer by SA."
"Pours a clear amber color with faint particles stuck in suspension. Has a thick 2 finger head of big bubbly white foam that leaves a bunch of lacing on the glass. Aroma is full of hops, malt and a bit of butter. Taste is malty with some slight diacetyl notes upfront and finishes a little bitter but is quite enjoyable. It is crisp with a medium mouthfeel and overall quite enjoyable."
"D: Very easy to drink... the best thing about this beer is just how nicely balanced it is. The flavors and aroma may not be anything special, but there's a perfect balance between the malt and the hops... easy to have several of these in a row."
"Despite all its deficiencies, the drinkability of this beer has to be rated good for the style. I could have used about twelve of them at work y'day in 90+ deg. heat."
"D: A nice beer, but it doesn't stand out. It goes down smoothly."
"Pours a deep auburn, clear with thick, foamy off-white head. Pretty much no aroma to even notice in the glass. Sniffing the bottle gives a bit of pale malt aroma but again, nothing in the glass. Very light in flavor, not much particular to notice. Some malt with a faint hop resemblance in there, but no real distinctions to make. Mouth is fairly full with crisp carbonation. More full-bodied than you might expect for the light flavor and low abv. Drinkability is just above avg.. Its very easy to drink and you could probably put down a few, especially at a party, but the lack of much flavor takes away from my desire to have it. I wouldn't buy it again, but I'd gladly choose it over most beers you typically come across in public."
"D - I would pick this over SNPA if it were available in as many places..."
"Very smooth and drinkable ale."
"D- This stuff goes down easy enough. It's a nicely balanced ale... a solid brew. Would definitely have it again."
"A solid ale from SA. Initially, I wasn't too fond of this beer, but it's growing on me."
"Fruity and bready this beer is. Hop bitterness with a little help from some toasty malts finishes the beer clean and bitter. I think of this beer as more of an amber ale and was surprised to see this classified as an APA. Not bad and I find myself picking up a sixer of this every once in a while, found it on sale for 5.99 last week."
"D - very good brew, one of my favorite session beers. i tend to like ales more than lagers, anyway."
"Mouthfeel- Lighter and Crisp crisp and a slight a lingering dryness. Drinkable- Its average but I would still fight for a space in my fridge."
"Pours a copper color that is competely transparent with a nice one finger head that gives way to some good lacing. The smell is of malt with some hints of fruits. The overall taste is of malt and of a slight fruity hop taste. The mouthfeel is medium carbonation. The overall drinkability is very high. A very solid beer that you can enjoy over and over."
"I greatly enjoy this beer and would take one over many others of this style. I honestly forget about little things that make up the beer and give it a wonderful flavor until I take my first sip."
"Notes: I t has been quite a while since I last had this beer nad it's still one of the best a.p.a's I have ever had. A great session beer. Cheers"
"Poured beer into a pint glass. It is a red and brown color with a decent sized head that sits atop the beer for some time after pouring. I smells like malts and brown sugar, certainly an inviting smell. It tastes of some hops, with more of that brown sugar, and a classic, clean american pale ale taste that does not tire no matter how long the foundations of this recipe have existed. Mouthfeel is earthy, a little dry, with some lingering sweetness from the brown sugar. Drinkability is average. I would pair this with a hamburger or pork tenderloin."
"Drinkability: Taste is good, and everything else going for it works for me. This is easy to drink, I could have another"
"d- super drinkable, i'm such a sucker for apas, very tasty, i'll definately buy this again, another great offering from sam adams, can't say i've ever had a bad beer from mister koch."
"I had this at the Atlanta International Airport while waiting for my connecting flight. Not a bad beer at all. I enjoyed it. Worth a try."
"Pours a light amber with pillowy shade of white head. A light subtle scent but pleasing: hops, wet grass, slight citrus, strawberries. Flavors of cherries, honey, some wheat, light alcohol. Smooth in the palate, light, warming. A pleasant session that beckons for summer weather."
"The mouthfeel was a bit run of the mill, very average."
"Prost!"
"Drinkability: Although this beer fits the style, it is not to my liking. It goes down easily, but it feels like it is missing something."
"WTF? I don't know what went wrong here, but I would not drink this one again. Terrible pale ale. It was nearing the ""best by"" date, but even if it was past it, I don't see any justification of these flaws. Sam Adams is hit or miss for me... and this is definitely a miss."
"D. This beer has alot of character, perhaps a bit more than Samual Adams boston lager. Flavor is there in spades, Solid."
"D - This is a very drinkable pale ale. I would definately rank Alpha King and Yazoo above this one but it's a decent APA"
"A refreshing sipper and a nice drinker that is smooth."
"D - A drinkable, malt oriented pale ale with a weak hop character. The lack of hop character is the only flaw and it is still a drinkable beer."
"Pours a seethru auburn sunset shade with one-finger white head and minimal lacing. A mild spicy, floral/herbal tea-like hop bitterness smell w/ very mild caramel/honey notes. Thin-bodied and a little slick and smooth, but packs a good herbal hop bite with some citric notes as a semi-sweet/roasted malt base. Good balance and it is a little chewey. Finishes with some crispness. A good pale ale that is easy to relax with and lets you know you're drinking a beer."
"Easy to drink. A sessionable beer."
"m/d- a great beer with or with out food. i could easily kill a sixer of this beer. two thumbs up"
"Very good ale."
"Very little aroma with just a bit sweet malt and hops. Poured fairly cold which may be holding the taste back a bit. Bitterness is just right with each sip and there is a little sweetness but not too much. I am enjoying this and it is very easy to drink."
"Drinkable enough, but pretty average all around. It is not readily available in this area, and if it were I'm not sure I'd choose it over Sierra Nevada Pale, Fire Rock Widmer Drifter or some others."
"D: A bit heavier on the malt than the hops, but a good balance, nonetheless. Good secondary flavors. Good Pale Ale."
"A good drinkable ale, but not much above average even for a Sam Adams product."
"Overall: ordinary"
"D: Highly drinkable. A very underrated beer out of Sam Adams."
"D- Really great session beer and definite go-to beer for me."
"This isn't my go-to pale, but it's an enjoyable selection as part of the SA Brewmaster's Variety case."
"[Drinkability]: Very drinkable!! I would drink this beer again."
"This one seems to be in the middle of about any beer. Pretty balanced, moderate feel and good flavor, yet not overpowering at all. It would be an excellent session beer, probably any season. If you're looking for a good tasting ale that won't overpower your senses and will is refreshing more than it is complex and rich, this is a good one."
"High bitterness to flavor ratio hinders the drinkability."
"Mouthfeel is is light bodied and thin with good carbonation."
"This is another solid beer from the Boston Beer Company. Not a whole lot of complexity, but something you could drink for any occasion. Good balance. Of note, I think this seems like more of an amber ale or even an English pale ale than an APA."
"Nice beer nice and drinkable with good flavor."
"D- Could have a few of these--decent session beer--but I would also probably be grabbing for something more."
"This was a sunny afternoon beer enjoyed in the cellar atmosphere of The Dugout on Comm Ave. On tap and served into a pint glass. Light orange in color. Large whispy foamy head. Noticed a bit of lacing. Smell was a faint aroma of pine. Taste was pretty average, but good. Bit malty, bit hoppy. Run of the mill. Easy going down, very light, low in abv. I prefer to order the Boston Ale over the Lager for two reasons. First, you don't see the Ale on tap nearly as much as the Lager. Secondly, I think that the Ale is more more drinkable than the Lager if you are looking for a quick and easy pint. Give me the Ale any day."
"Good carbonation. I drank this with a bison cheeseburger, and cut through the fat of the cheese (and the little fat in the bison) well. Medium-light mouthfeel. Drinkable enough, I suppose, but I don't know in what situation I'd really care for another."
"It's not a bad beer, by any means, but not memorable enough to be a repeat performer."
"Poured a nice orange/copper color with about a 1-2 finger head that seemed to keep decent retention. Nice looking lacing throughout. Somewhat vague hop aroma. This is where I should probably point out that this is the first I've had this in roughly ten years. When I was in college a nearby bar had it on tap and I also treated myself to bottles when I got sick of getting hammered on macros. I don't know if my palate has become jaded, but this just doesn't seem as good as I remember. I don't know if Sam Adams quit brewing this for a while (there seemed to be quite a few years I never saw it) and then brought it back changed or what. This ale is mildly pleasant in it's hoppy taste, but just isn't as flavorful as I remember. All in all, it is still a pretty good beer and would be a great choice for a session beer."
"D: A really decent pale ale, nothing too complex, makes it really easy to drink."
"Overall, a very easy drinking beer. I would choose this as one of my top session beers as I can easily drink a lot of these."
"D: Very drinkable stuff. Overall, this beer just has a very good amount of flavor for how light it seems to be in the mouth and in the stomach. If they had this stuff on tap, I'd go nuts."
"Final Thoughts - My first Sam Adams review (though I have had my fair share of Sam Adams). I love the Boston Ale, and wish they would sell it in 12 packs at my local store. Great session beer to enjoy, especially while catching some rugby matches."
"Creamy mouthfeel and very easy to drink. Overall, exhibits characteristics similar to the Boston Lager but taken a step further. Nothing I would actively seek out but for the price, this isn't a bad find."
"glad to have rediscovered this classic and true bargain. a 12 pack for 11.99 is awesome. truly an everyday brew, a session brew, not an extreme at all, but if anything, it was extreme compared to what was available to me back in mississippi in the late 80s..."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable, goes down easy."
"mouthfeel is great! probably my favorite thing about this beer, nice and creamy, the malt and hops follow through with great balance.. overall just as sessionable as its lager counterpart but tastier :D"
"A good beer, i wouldn't go out of my way to get this, but not bad."
"D: Drinkability is solid. More flavor would aid it somewhat, but it's still a decent brew. It's well-balanced and enjoyable. Definitely a good party/social beer--something I could drink a lot of at a bar."
"D: Not one I would go out of my way for. Better than the lager. Flavorful and medium bodied."
"Drinkability- very Drinkable and enjoyable ale, I really enjoy the balance in this one, its got plenty of hops but not overally bitter, its got plenty of malts but not overally sweet, good balance to it, great seasonable beer at very fair price, preferred by me alot over the now more popular lager,"
"Clear pumpkin color with a beige head. Aroma is pale and caramel malts with a kiss of sweet citrus, melon, and honey. Flavor is much less sweet, in fact it's very neutral. Some lightly toasty malts are countered by an earthy hoppiness that leaves a very very slight bitterness on the finish. Tastes more English than American. Mouthfeel is great. Light and refreshing without being watery. Characterful enough to maintain interest."
"Interesting beer. Although an APA I think this could easily pass as an Amber. Pours reddish copper, clear, with fluffy head and minimal retention and no lacing. Smell is strong of caramel malt, some sweetness, and a touch of hops. Taste is about the same. A somewhat dry and bicuity malt backbone, some caramel as well. I really cant say I detect much, if any, hops. Mouthfeel was fine. Not really thin, a little more to the medium side with a slightly dry aftertaste. Overall a good beer, and easy drinker, just not a standout APA."
"D: It's drinkable, but I'm probably not going to get another 6pk of it. Very leafy hop flavors take a while to develop and the maltiness is nice, but a tad on the dry side."
"Not a bad beer, but nothing great either. To me its not worth the price tag. Much better ales out there for the same price, some cheaper."
"Fairly nice. Nothing epic but good."
"D: Very easy to drink. A slightly fuller, hoppier version of the Boston Lager in many respects, although the brewing process is obviously different. Along those lines, it's not spectacular, but it's very well done and wonderfully balanced."
"D - Very good. I can sip it for sometime and enjoy the flavor without worrying that the flavor will be gone after the last taste."
"D- Excellent. A nice easy drinking, well balanced ale."
"Cheers!"
"It pours a orange to amber color with very little head. I definitely get a floral scent with a bit of citrus. I was disappointed with the taste. Left a bad aftertaste. Feels like it coated my throat. I expected more from the hops. It had a sweetness to it. Overall it was not one of the best ales that I have had. I prefer Budweiser American Ale to the Boston Ale. Sam Adams has better products on the market."
"I was a little disappointed, but overall not that bad of a brew... Ive had better for less price"
"This beer(at least in name) used to rock. Now, a shadow of its former self, I sense a long and slow decline."
"All in all, it's not a bad beer, but it's just not all that good."
"Great overall beer. One of my favorites in the Sam Adams 21"
"MF&D - Meduim bodied, crisp and refreshing. Would make a nice session ale."
"This is a nice beer from Sam Adams. I am likely to try it again."
"Pours a huge tan creamy head, big bubbles, decent lacing. Light a brown color, very clear. Malty sweet aroma, some kind of dark fruit like raisins, some hops. Sweet malty taste, plasticy acidic. Bad beer? Or maybe too warm? Sweet, malty lagery taste."
"Drinkability: More complex than most ""popular"" beers, I realy enjoy drinking these. This beer pairs well with most comfort food. Most casual ""go with the flow"" beer drinkers may not like this one saying its too bitter. However if you introduce this one to someone who is tired of the run of the mill pizza parlor beer they may catch a glimpse of the power of the hop gods."
"This is medium bodied with thinner flavors (!). It is drinkable, but I wish it had a tad bit more force in the flavor department. Overall, a decent one. I hadn't had this in years, and the beer cooler was full of SA. Glad I gave this another try."
"The taste was mildly hopped. Overall it was a good experience even though I knew I was drinking a Sam Adams that I've had under its real label in the past."
"Love this beer. Similar taste as the Lager (even though it's an ale), but a bit more full bodied and fruitier. I think Sam Adams brews are very reliable and tasty. Always been good to me, and this is no exception. I also like the fact that it is under 5% ABV. I consider it a session beer, and it's mild but memorable flavor invites another pour."
"12oz bottle into a Boston Lager glass. Pours a crisp pale orange with a decent off-white head that diminishes to a ring and leaves spotty lacing. Aroma is some crisp Earthy hops and slight sweet malts. The taste is a nice balance with crisp hops and sweet malts mingling nicely. The beer is nice and light and crisp with decent carbonation. This is a decent pale ale to say the least."
"D= just about as average as you can get. Pretty decent beer but nothing that great about it. Yet another average representation of a style by Sam Adams. Not a bad thing. I think that's what makes Sammy such a great gateway beer for all styles"
"Pretty well balanced and very tasty. Goes down nice and smooth. Also has a really nice finnish as well."
"Very quaffable and enjoyable, but certainly nothing to seek out."
"All told, a good beer. It's best feature is that it is readily available most places and not really over-priced."
"Decent mouth feel but overall a disappointment from a usually solid distributor"
"Pours a clear, golden color. One inch head with good retention and good lacing. Smells strongly of hops. Fits the style quite nicely. Smooth, crisp, and a tartness of a mouth feel. High carbonation levels are present. Tastes strongly of hops. There is a small malt background noticeable. Overall, a good beer - not too overpowering with the hops - worth a try."
"Decent atmosphere. Good flavor and feel. Good solid pale ale. Nice quaff."
"A strange thing, as this is a great ""common"" beer that is readily available nation-wide, for which we ought to feel some thanks. By no means not the best out there, this ale deserves the accolades (& presence) dedicated to its lesser sibling, the lager (which is a far simpler basic beer). The ale pours a nice clean, clear, but nice amber with a decent lacey head that sticks around. The aroma is nice, clean & crisp bitter malt. The flavor is a good, basic bread malt (hint of graham) with some minor hops that linger together nicely. A fine, drinkable ale."
"Pours a very clear amber with medium off-white, creamy head. Medium smell, bitter throughout, including lasting finish. Malty, caramel flavoring but bitter. Good lacing throughout. Medium body. Tolerable, but only if nothing else is around. Still rates higher than anything Bud or Pabst ever created. A bit above average."
"D - Great, very sessionable."
"Overall - Well balanced ale that complements a number of dishes. A good session beer as well. Got this at Uno's Pizzeria. Reviewed from notes."
"Cheers!"
"Overall it's a beer that had some potential, but ultimately didn't pan out."
"It has great head with nice retention. Smell is nice and a bit sweet. Taste is really nicely balanced and like the hoping. On the milder side like an EPA. Mouthfeel is decent and not to heavy so it makes it quite drinkable. cheers"
"D - Malty with just enough hop bitterness, but I definitely enjoy being hit over the head more -- IPAs and strong coffee porters are more my style. You could drink a lot of these Boston Ales without any problem."
"Right now it's probably my beer of choice along with the SA Honey Porter."
"Samuel Adams Boston Ale poured a nice cloudy caramel/amber color, with a nice head, and pretty good lacing. The smell was light with sweet and hoppy notes. The taste showed light sweetness at first with not much hop bight. However as it warmed a bit more hop was revealed. Mouthfeel was good as was the drinkability. Overall I found this to be a decent ale, one I might go back to. I find that with almost all Sam Adams products, I enjoy drinking them, but I feel that they are missing something. They are good beers, but to me seem less challenging then other craft beers out there."
"D - eh.. thin and malty.. nothing special, but its easy to drink."
"D: A good low key pale ale on the hop profile but a good bookend on the taste profile leaning towards the sweet. I will break my credo of a same six pack when it comes to Sam's Boston Stock Ale the next time I'm backing up the truck."
"Overall, a good beer. Not exceptional by any means, but a solid offering."
"Not impressed with the beer. It does not compare with other quality apa's."
"(rated Feb 9, 2007)"
"(3.5/5)"
"Poured into my Samuel Adams perfect pint glass. Medium clean amber with a small head and moderate carbonation. Aroma is carameled and candied. Light hops and malts with a slight bitterness in the finish. This is a very solid brew. Straight 4's across the board."
"People may knock Sam Adams brewery but they have some pretty good brews. This is one of them . While not there best this is definately a tasty ale. Not to be confused with the Boston Lager which is one of my least favorites by SA. The Boston Ale is a winner and I will gladly drink it again!"
"Poured to a nice offwhite head that had some big bubbles. Ale was very clear and brown in color with reddish tints. Head hung around awhile and left some heavy lacing. Had some nice rings with every swallow. Smelled of hops and caramel. Smell was actually very light. Tasted mainly of hops and caramel with some citrus notes. Had that slightly bitter aftertaste. Felt good in the mouth, carbonation was right. Thought maybe a hair on the dry side. Would love to buy a 12er of this Ale and sit around a campfire in the winter. Ale and fire to keep you warm. Alcohol was inline with most session beers, so you could enjoy a few and cozy up to the fire."
"Smells hoppy, caramel. Beautiful, golden brown, almost copper appearance. Really good looking amber. Foamy head that leaves a spotty lacing. Strong caramel malt, good hoppy finish. Quality brew. The Boston Brewing Company is highly underrated by the craft beer enthusiast community, possibly because of an elitist attitude due to the fact that they're so widely available. Fact is, they just can flat out brew."
"Overall: This is an okay beer, although this isn't my style it is good."
"The Boston Ale poured a beautiful copper color, about a 2 finger head with nice head retention throughout. Thick, spider web lacing throughout. Slight hop aroma, but nothing that jumped out at me. This ale had a mild, pleasant, hoppy taste, with carbonation felt on the tongue. Definitely a drinkable and enjoyable brew. I'm not a big fan of Sam's in general, but this is a very drinkable brew."
" Pours a nice pretty color in my glass,my first couple of sips I thought this may not be a beer for me but half way through my first glass I was in love, sort of a fruitty,nutty,semi sweet ale,I buy this from timt to time,goes VERY well with bratts on the grill,very drinkable. Thanks Sam"
"Drinkabiliy: Besides Boston Lager, this is easily Samuel Adams easiest, yet most appealing brew to chill out with. It's got robust flavor and is something that isn't generally boring after 2 or 3. Kudos to Samuel Adams for continuing to keep this Ale on the market and not in the retired forum like alot of other BBC favorites I've had in the past."
"Samuel Adams Boston Ale from Boston Beer Company pours a golden orange with a pretty good sized head that laced the upper portion of my glass. Upon smelling the brew, one would be inclined to say that the aroma is strictly typical APA. There's malt and hops in there. The taste is where the disappointment lies. Despite the nice color and fine mouthfeel, Boston ale just does not deliver American Pale Ale taste to my tongue. It seems to be more in line with a milder English Pale Ale in my opinion. It's not bad, but there are better options available. Brew on, Patriot, brew on!"
"D- Great beer for refreshment"
"Clear amber pour, short off-white head. Weak aroma of hops, toffee, and earth. Watery taste that is mostly crisp hops. Some malt and caramel in the back. Just never had the full compliment of both to make this better. In the end, it tasted matery and somewhat skunked."
"Highly recommendable"
"Drinkability: This is an underrated beer. Sessionable at 5% abv, tasty, and well-balanced."
"D - This Pale Ale screamed session beer to me, great taste and body for a session beer, Samuel Adams scores with this creation, very tasty"
"D: Pretty tasty and very easy to drink. A nice compliment for Thanksgiving dinner, especially the starches and the oily fried turkey. No problem to finish six of these over the course of three days."
"Will I buy it again? It was actually very good, despite my quite harsh interview, so yeah I'm gonna buy it again :)"
"Overall, try this beer. Good luck."
"D: Very drinkable. An excellent session beer."
"Pours a really nice & clear coppery/amber color, darker around the edges, big giant foamy tan head fades into a nice film, sheets and sheets of lacing in the glass. Pretty mild on the nose, some faint caramel and grassy/citrus notes. Caramel malt flavor, not too sweet, biscuity flavor, and some faint bitter citrus, tangerine/grapefruit. Medium-bodied brew, and drinkability is just great here...you could pair this with damn near anything, and have a few."
"Fairly bitter in nature but a wonderful beer whose finish leaves on wanting for more. The bitterness may be a bit extreme for some; it isn't overpowering but it is certainly dominating, though a balance exists that is hard to explain. Overall a delicious brew and a good, decently complex and widely available beer to fall back on."
"I like this beer. It has all the marks of a session ale. I would never hesitate to reach for this one."
"Poured from 12 oz bottle to Sam Adams Pint glass a clear honey copper color with 2 inches of white foamy head that reduced to a minimal sheen with some spotty lacing. Minor metalic smell here with a hint of malts. Tastes better than smell but not much. It seems watered down like so many other Sam Adams beers with a sweet malty taste and a very mellow hop finish. Watery thin feel with decent carbonation. Very easy drinking with only a hint of the nasty flavor almost every Sam Adams has."
"This beer is very drinkable because of the very smooth mouthfeel. I wouldn't want to drink a ton of these because of the thickness and nothing exciting about the taste, but a good drink to have a couple with dinner."
"D: The hops weren't that well-balanced. They overpower the other flavors. This wouldn't be a good session beer."
"Not to be confused with their more famous and wide-spread Boston Lager. You will be tested. Out of the bottle this brew was a light copper color with a huge, foamy, tan head. Great retention and it left sticky ribbons of lacing all down the glass. The aroma was malty, biscuits and some semi-sweet caramel notes with herbal hops behind that. The flavors were a little off balance, the first flavor was the semi-sweet caramel malt followed by some nuttiness and roasted malt. The finish was bitter and a bit astringent as though the hops flavor was 'forced.' It's only at the end where the beer really lost me. Otherwise, the mouthfeel is smooth and the carbonation on-point. With a little tinkering this one could be as good as it looks."
"Highly drinkable, easy and refreshing. Good session beer."
"A quaffable beer. Definitely a session beer if I have ever seen one, and it was at a decent price of $7 for a six pack (which is good for the north side of Chicago)."
"I am continually amazed by the quality brews put forth by the guys from Sam Adams..."
"The taste is earthy and leafy as well, with bread, fruit, a little caramel, citrus and pine. Clean, leafy bitterness nicely balances the sweetness. It is a bit like Old Speckled Hen."
"Overall this isn't a SA beer I'd seek out but it's good. There are just too many other SA beers I enjoy more."
"Really pretty drinkable stuff, though it's really nothing extraordinary. The kind of thing you drink when Bud is the only other thing available."
"the only sam adams i know of that i would want to drink regularly (4)"
"This beer is very similar to Samuel Adams Boston Lager. It pours dark amber with a strong head that lasts until the last drop. Smell is very malty, with citrus and piney tones. Carbonation is medium. Mouthfeel is very strong for the type. Almost a ginger or heavy syrup aftertaste. overall, this is very good. excellent brew on a cold winter night."
"It taste as awesome as it looks!"
"Very good ale!"
"D: Goes down fairly easily, even if it's not terribly interesting."
"Drinkability: I finally realized that Samuel Adams has so many beers out there that I have nto tried and they are always a safe bet. This is my attempt to ""catch up"" so to speak and I am pleased. Great session ale."
"I'd stick with the Lager if given a choice between the two.."
"I wish this was as readily available as the lager."
"D - Goes down smoothly, and the hop finish isn't overpowering."
"It was really malty in taste and had limited hoppiness. It really seemed to me this was more of an old ale than an American Pale Ale. It had a similar mouthfeel to an old ale and the hop quotient was missing in what I like in the APA category. As a Old Ale this would definitely score higher."
"Brown in color and pours a medium head, with a nice amount of lacing. Smooth hoppy flavor with spices and some sweet caramel mixed in with a sour note in the finish. It falls a little short of their Lager but it's pretty good and a nice session choice."
"D - this was an okay beer. It was nicely balanced, but in a weird way to me. I didn't like the roasty bitterness that lingered in my mouth. This was part of a mix pack and I probably will not seek it out unless it comes in another mix pack..."
"D: Decent drinkability for an everyday ale, the noble flowery hops saves this from being ordinary."
"D - Love it... Smooth... Great session beer... Best Sam Adams offering I've ever tried..."
"Mouth feel is very crisp and smooth.Very Drinkable."
"D - Good for sessioning if it is all you got but I won't be buying it again."
"Thought this might stand out as one of their better brews but It's rather average at best. Sweet malty aroma, dark copper pour with decent head and adequate lacing. Filling mouthfeel with an awkward aftertaste. Flavor is fine, sweet and bready. Some bitterness present. Kind of buttery."
"by far the best beer brewed by the boston beer company. it is a peg above the boston lager which is also very good. as do all samuel adams' beers, it has a strong hop content in it. some may feel it is overwhelming but i think its delicious. i had a homeless guy in new york buy me a six pack of this, which he payed for it with his money believe it or not. his name was homeless charlie look him up he was on opie and anthony."
"Drinkability: This is one great ale that is done right. You can find it just about anywhere and is great as a staple in your fridge."
"Drinkability is fairly high. Decent flavor and low alcohol makes this brew quite sessionable. Not bad."
"D - Very drinkable beer. Incredibly smooth and enough flavor to keep your palate satisfied. I could drink it all day."
"Drinkability: Very high, I could drink this all night."
"Drinkability is outstanding. I specifically search for this beer every year. Oddly enough, it's hard for me to find in my area as you can easily find almost every other Sam Adams product easier than this one, excepting Utopias and the brewery-specific area-limited-releases. Give this one a try and you won't be sorry. I try to sample this beer every year as part of my annual rotation."
"Body is below medium, with an average mouthfeel and good drinkability."
"Nice reddish/orange color. Medium head moderate lacing. I smell a nice sweet and citrus aroma along with a carmel malt smell. All of those flavors are present as well but you get the addition of slight hop bitterness too. Good body. Good drinking ale. One of the better ales I've had in some time."
"D - Good beer. I still like the lager better than the ale."
"I was dissapointed with this one but it was still an okay beer"
"D- Not hard to drink at all. Has a very good taste and not to heavy."
"I always forget how much I enjoy this brew. It pours with a huge rich and creamy head on it. The taste is very balanced to my palate. Most noticeable about the beer is a mild hop kick in the aftertaste that is quite pleasing. Just a great refreshing taste left on the tongue after each sip - it oddly got more tastier as it warmed up slightly. It's a great session brew that probably doesn't get the respect it deserves."
"I can't believe it's taken me this long to try this beer. It was pretty good, although not a stand out. I was drinking it on its own, and I feel it could use a touch more bitterness for balance. I think it would pair nicely with grilled beef."
"Drinkability: Not a great APA, but still alright. I don't like the artificial flavorings too much, but other than that it's very agreeable."
"Good stuff from Sam Adams..."
"Best before OCT 2008 notched on the side of the label. 12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours an amber color wtih an off-white head that leaves a decent amount of lacing around the glass. The aroma is sweet toasted malts and slightly biscuity with some citrusy hops, not overly aromatic but pleasant nonetheless. The taste is toasted malts with a kick of citrusy hops in the finish. The drinkability is very high, this would make a great session beer, and I could easily throw down a few of these without getting bored. Good classic American brew, enjoyed on 4th of July weekend! Overall, Sam Adam's Boston Ale is definitely worth a shot!"
"Pours out a slightly opaque dark orange color with a somewhat weak head. In the aroma I notice caramel, general sweetness, and banana. The flavor is lightly sweet and refreshing with mild flavors that I couldn't name, although I noticed some lemon. The carbonation was good in the mouth, and it felt full-bodied but not thick. As usual, Sam Adams doesn't hit a lot of homeruns with their mainstream offerings, but this one is another solid stand-up double."
"The mouthfeel is fairly light, and while it's not my favorite APA, this could be a good session ale."
"Not a bad beer. Exactly what I would expect from SA Boston Ale. Not a west coast hoppy pale ale, but a well balanced subdued session beer."
"Body is a little bit less than medium and the carbonation is perfect.... I have always really liked this beer... I just wish it was available locally in 6'ers."
"D: Not very exciting to me. Good session beer, but not one I would seek out."
"Delicous! I have passed this beer up way too many times in favor of the lager. From now I will buy whichever is fresher and be happy!"
"D: A less than robust taste profile lends itself to prime summertime poundability."
"Annother good solid beer from Jim Koch."
"Easy to quaff, Boston Ale fares nicely, more malted than hopped. Sam Adams has again created a fine ale, different from its other brews. I'd love to see this supercharged with more malt and hops, but it has appeal nonetheless."
"D: A very good beer from Sam Adams, don't know why it took me so long to revisit it. Similar flavour profile to the ubiquitous Boston Lager, but a smooth overall feel and I think the ale fruitiness complimented the malt better than in the lager. An easy beer to find, and relatively inexpensive for a craft, recommended."
"Pours a transparent red/brown color with ok head that leaves minute yet visible lace. Nose is slight copper and a bit of english malt. Taste is english malt with some slight hop flavors. Very lagery taste, red lager. Mouthfeel is on the thin side, but drinkability is poundable. Overall a good summer brew, but If you are expecting a very full flavored robust ale, you will be dissapointed."
"D- I'm not sure I'd consider this an apa, Sam Adams refers to it as a Stock Ale. A decent beer all around, just don't expect an apa out of it."
"Smell is malty and citrusy. Taste is good, nice malt flavor, fruity hops accents, and a nice, clean finish. This is a great beer to just kick back and drink while you're grilling on a fine spring day. Nice interpretation of an English Pale Ale."
"Why is this called an APA? Sam Adams calls it a stock ale (which can also mean old ale) and has a very British character in my opinion. Tastes and smells like an English pale ale really. The aroma is a smooth, creamy bread and carries over in the flavor. Mellow caramel malt with a slight herbal hops note make up most of the flavor. Mostly its all smooth sailing with the creamy yeast character and sweet malts. Quite delicious in all, though not as complex as I'd wish."
" Everything is great about this ber except the flavor. I wouldn't buy it again because of that though. Too many other fine beers out there in this style."
"I feel that stock ale describes this one quite well. It pour a clear amber and has a light tan head. The nose has some grainy malt with some light fruity hops. Taste is malty and has a bit of sweet caramel or honey in there. Body was average with decent carbonation. A good session brew, but needs a bigger malt and hop profile."
"d: Not bad. I like the hop profile and the caramel malt. Maltier than the Boston Lager, but the hops aren't as pronounced."
"Unforunately this brew is hard to find since the lager, light, and seasonal brews are always on display. I was lucky enough to find one 12 pack in my local Shaws on sale for $10.99. The brew is and has always been my favorite from Sam Adams. Well, nothing changed with this purchase, in fact I think I got a pretty lively batch. I have nothing more to say except seek out an American classic- stock ale."
"M: A pretty standard, medium body, with a touch of stickiness on the finish. It would be far more sessionable in the heat if that were not there, but it's alright. A tasty beer, an easy going beer, and certainly a reasonable session beer. I think I might go with the standard Boston Lager in most cases, but this one stands up well."
"D- This is an ok brew that I can see being a good crossover piece for one entering the craft beer world."
"Drinkability & Notes: Not my favorite Sammy A's but certainly one of the most drinkable in my opinion. Has a solid taste if not quite great. Decent hops but wouldn't classify a hoppy pale ale like a Sierra Nevada."
"D - Very drinkable if not for that damn bitterness. It's not even that the bitterness is overbearing, it's just out of place, and I have this problem with about half of Sam Adams' beers. Whatever great flavors they may have bottled are offset by a bitterness that does nothing but bring the beer down."
"D: A cut above average, this is an enjoyable brew to drink. It's similar in so many ways to the Boston Lager but there is a nice edginess to the flavor that I like in a brew. Recommended."
"Good feel and body. Extremely drinkable. An all around solid, flavorful beer. Not fancy, just good."
"I haven't had their Boston Ale in years because their more ubiquitous lager is more standard fare. The ale is much better than their lager and I'm glad that I had this again. It pours a frothy off white thick head with crisp malts in the aroma. The carbonation is modest and what is most impressive in this beer is the creamy mouthfeel, medium body, big malt flavors, and the nice balance with some hops in the finish. The beer isn't brilliant, but it is an old standby for most any occasion. The maltiness is a bit carmelized, somewhat bready, definitely creamy in texture, and maybe a tad bit of spice, but that's hard to detect. The beer hits all the right notes, and the malts are neither overdone, nor too thin. Again, the balance is what makes the beer, rather than any fancy tastes, spices, or frills. L'Chaim."
"T: Overall, this is just an OK beer. Sam Adams has done better. The taste just wasn't enough of one thing or another to make it compelling."
"Always a good choice. The Boston Ale has a golden amber color with good clarity and carbonation. It forms a thick off white head that leaves nice lacing on the glass. Its aroma is malty sweet with a hint of honey and floral hops. On the tongue the malts are bready and lightly toasty. The hops are light and have a nice piney and citrus bitterness that fades slowly into the finish. I really like the balance on this ale and I fined it to be very drinkable and refreshing. Cheers!"
"Bottle smell is sweet and malty with hints of cinnamon. Pours to a yellow bronze with a lacy foamy head. Taste is sweet with hints a cinnamon and a hoppy finish. Mouthfeel is good, carbonation is just right. A good brew, a liitle sweet for my tastes. A little more hopping would make it very delicious. I wouldn't go out of my way to look for it but if someone gave me one I'd have seconds."
"I didn't think I would find a better beer than the Boston Lager for an everyday session beer, this is it. Excellent for what it is."
"Overall impression: This is a bit different, lots of flavors I normally encounter more in British beers, but it comes together in a nice drinkable offering."
"Overall - A very good APA... i wish i could get this on a regular basis as it would be an excellent beer for everyday drinking... recommended..."
"D: this is definitely okay at best for my taste. I really like the feel of the creamy carbonation, but the taste is so bland it really doesn't do anything for me."
"Samuel Adams Boston Ale is a well-rounded brew. Not too bitter, not too sweet, and not too expensive."
"Drinkability: good beer. I would buy this one again. Not my favorite from the brewery and not a typical american pale ale, but very nice."
"Pours deep amber color with a bit of head which dissipates with nice lacing. Smells like malt with some citrus notes. Tastes good, low-to-medium carbonation with a hint of alcohol. Leaves a 'dry' flavor on the palette. Great drinkability and a bit lighter than their Boston Lager."
"Drinkablity: Very good brew. Great taste and easy sessionability."
"Lightly carbonated, smooth and refreshing in the mouth. Infinitely drinkable."
"The flavor is so close to the Boston Lager as to be splitting hairs when comparing them, except their flagship lager is actually a bit more flavorful."
"The beer had a thin head on it that left some nice lacing. A nice clear copper, amber color. The smell was clean and crisp, giving off a little hint of nuts. The mouthfeel was light with a bitter, hoppy finish. The body had a nutty flavor to it, hence it going well with the fontina. Overall a smooth flavorful beer."
"When drinking the beer I noticed that the beer is light and almost watery like a lager. You get the carmel to nutty taste that goes away as you drink it down. This beer will do in a pinch but, its not something that I would buy again. Kinda like drinking butterscotch."
"Part of their Brewmaster's collection, this poured a copper color with very nice head. The taste had a little hops up front quickly followed by ample smooth malt flavors, then slight hops bitterness in the aftertaste. It had a good weight and carbonation for the texture. It was easy to drink and overall an enjoyable ale."
"Note: Not too strong,not too light and a decent brew any day of the week."
"Pretty much Sam Adam's sister beer to Boston Lager, fairly similar except this one tries harder and is more assertive in the taste yet slightly more harsh and unrefined."
"Certainly not the best sam adams brewers collection but still a decent and refreshing ale."
"D - This is a pretty good beer. Could make a good session beer."
"Pours amber with nearly two finger head in standard pint glass. Head retains well and leaves lots of lacing. Smell is herbal and fresh. Taste is ultra smooth, on the hoppy, fruity side with malt playing admirable second fiddle. Clean and not overly dry finish. Mouthfeel is sound with light to medium body. Extremely drinkable - a very refreshing beer that just hits the spot any time of year."
"Reasonably drinkable - little heavy for preference"
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"I would not drink this regularly."
"The beer poured with a nice light amber color and a medium sized head that left an large amount of lacing. The taste was unique, with a hop profile I haven't experienced before in an APA and a long, delicious malt finish. It was very balanced and mild for an ale but retained the full ale mouthfeel. Excellent, I want to get a case."
"Pours a nice orange amber. Very sweet and malty. Not much hop bitterness here at all -- well balanced. Head pours nicely and settles down to a hearty lace. Overall, I enjoyed it better then the Boston Lager. This is a great summer beer. I recommend it when you're looking for something above average and acceptable to the non-beer-snobs."
"Got this one at Uno Pizzeria under the alias Uno Amber Ale, just after having the Winter Lager. I actually preferred this one. Very tasty. Pours a nice deep amber color with a good bit of head and a touch of lacing. Nose is very fruity, with a nice balance of malt. Grapefruit and other citrus as well. Taste is likewise, a little stronger than the nose, which is a positive. A very tasty beer, nothing really mind-blowing, but good all around. Body is fairly thick, perfect for the style. Overall, one I could drink a lot of. Maybe sessionable with the low ABV."
"Rich amber color with a medium white head from a bottle. Smell was of sweet caramel like malt, and almost a touch of alcohol or tartness to go along with it. Taste was very mild bittering hops, but mostly of sweet sticky caramel, and a touch of unique tartness. Definitely a slightly unique amber, from my experiences, and I'd say, slightly above average as well. Got in a sampler pack and wasn't disappointed."
"This beer pours a nice amberish colour with an orange hue that is very impressive! This one caught me off guard with the perfect balance of hops and malts for a ale, it's very delicious and fairly similar the the lager which isn't bad at all another delicious brew from SA!"
"D = This is a very drinkable APA, less hoppy than many and with a very satisfying malt character."
"Notes: A good balanced brew that's pretty easy to find which gives it points."
"What can I say? I'm an ale man, through and through, but I find the Boston Lager to be superior to the Boston Ale. As I say regarding the SABL, ""better than Pete's Wicked," but that's not saying a whole lot. The appearance has a strange fogginess to it that I can't quite fathom. The taste is a sweet-over-bitter combo that leaves me scratching my head slightly, and the finish is not quite as smooth as I'd like. Still, I'd have a pint in a pinch."
"M: Has a very dry finish with some malt in the backend the leaves an aftertaste."
"I bought this at Walmart!! Price is nice too. This is a very good pale ale."
"Note: When I ordered this beer, our waiter told us it was very similiar to a Sam Adams??"
"This beer poured a deep rich red harvest color. The smells were average. Taste was smokey, woody flavors; well rounded. The mouthfeel was a nice carbonation and great silky smoothness. The drinkability of this one is pretty good, definately not the best; but a good everyday drinker."
"This arrived with a big, rocky, off-white head. The color was a beautiful, deep-golden amber. The nose had a malty sweetness, which seemed a bit odd for an ale. The mouthfeel was medium with a fair amount of sweetness on the tongue. The finish had a nice, hoppy bite, but too little, too late. It also created decent lacing throughout. I'd take the BOS Lager over this."
"Overall this seems to be a rather average ale, definitely a bit middle of the road in most aspects. Not one of my favorite Sam Adams offerings, but not bad. I doubt I will buy it again but I wouldn't turn one down. It may just be that it has a flavor profile that isn't my favorite as it seems to be well appreciated by most."
"Pours a translucent amber, with a small off-white head. Smells earthy and malty. Taste is a malt-oriented pale ale, with a slight lemon twang and good bitterness. The hop profile is earthy as well. Full mouthfeel, good carbonation. Quite drinkable, a good session ale."
"This is Sam Adam's crowning achievement. Perfect in every way. It's smooth as hell going down but has a lot of character. I love their lager, but this is a cut above anything else they've ever done. This may just be the best mass produced beer around. This and Guiness are my two favorites. If I were rich and could afford to drink as much as I wanted I'd be dead within a few days from drinking this beer 12 hours out of every day."
"Coppery-orange and very clear pour with signs of mid-heavy carbonation. A shade off-white head settles into a light layer atop the ale. Small spots stick along the sides of the glass. The aroma is balanced between sweet malts and light spicy hops. The flavor is much the same. Balanced light caramel sweetness, medium hops flavors and bitters. Light fruit/ citrus hints. Sweet and bitter finish. A bit heavy on the carbonation, medium body. Smooth drink, good balance."
"Smooth tasting and very drinkable. Good session beer. I have always thought that this beer was one of SA's best offerings."
"D: Not incredibly complex but easy to drink. There are too many better APA's out there."
"I prefer the Boston Ale to the Boston Lager, primarily because I'm a hophead. This SA brand won;t wow you, but like most of their ales and lagers, it's reliable. It's a good call for an APA."
"D - This is easy to drink. Nothing spectacular, but a good session beer nevertheless. I find most offerings from Sam Adams quite easy to drink."
"D - Very drinkable, and full of flavor for a beer under 5%. A nice beer, but not an APA."
"Sam Adams labels this as a ""stock ale", and while I am not entirely sure what the characteristics of a stock ale are, it does seem to vary from an APA. Maybe, the English Pale Ale is a more apt classification for this beer, due to the balance of the ingredients and the lack of a more intense hoppiness. With that being said, I really enjoyed this brew. Fairly complex flavor, along with extreme drinkability, make this a staple and a winner for Samuel Adams."
"Strong caramel color with a decent 1/2 in cream color head. Head doesn't last long at all with minimal lacing. This beer doesn't have an overwhelming aroma. There is a nice hops smell and maybe a little oak. This beer has a decent mouth feel with light carbonation. There definitely is a mild bitterness to the aftertaste but nothing too impressive. This is a decent beer, but nothing to write home about."
"Nice coloring (fairly dark) and pretty good head. It has a nice scent, soft and not overpowering, just a good crisp hoppy aroma. Goes down smooth, with a nice crisp taste. It has a great hoppy (bitter) aftertaste that lets you know you just drank a pale ale, but it's not overly strong."
"pours a clear, golden amber with a one-finger off-white head that sticks around for the duration. Smells of floral hops and bready malt. Taste is a refreshing hoppiness rounded out with malty sweetness with a little bit of a butterscotch feel to it toward the middle. Crisp to the palate and very drinkable. Exceptionally versatile beer -- could be either a quencher or a comfort beer on a cold day. A good one to keep around and an underappreciated part of the Sam Adams canon."
"D- pretty good drinkability better than most APA's I can remember. I could definitely drink a few of these; quite good in the fall."
"Extremely drinkable, almost too easy. Fortunately its only at 5% ABV and not heavy on the stomach at all. I look forward to cooking up a pepperoni pizza and enjoying some of these ales. A great starter beer for your BMC friends and family."
"There's not a ton to say here, it's a solid pale ale that delivers huge drinkability, but also doesn't floor you with character-overload. Another confident entry from this champion of craft beer."
"This is a pretty good american pale ale. Great blend of hops and malt that creates a very smooth beer."
"The malt dominates this beer. The hops are evident on the finish. It has a nice clean and crisp mouthfeel and very good carbonation. It is not a great APA because of its lack of hoppiness, but it is a solid beer that tastes good. It is easy to drink so very sessionable with its low alcohol."
"D- malt balanced sessionable brew, definitely warrants a try with its surprising complexity"
"D: Not hoppy enough for an APA, but it's a lot better than the English PA's I've had. Would make a good session beer."
"Bright reddish-brown pour comes from the bottle. It's smell is pretty strong of citrus-like hops but with an almost earthy aroma. It's pretty sour and crisp but with a sweet aftertaste. It has an average mouthfeel: light and carbonated. Overall, a pretty drinkable beer."
"This is a very sessional brew. Very easy to drink, not complex by any means, but a solid ale. This is does not quite have the hop profile I would like in of most APAs, but still a very drinkable brew."
"i saved this last one for the game; poured a light copper w/ very little white head, some lacing; nice malt-hop aroma, floral undertones; crisp malt flavor w/ some toasty malt, good hop balance; a little lighter on the palate than advertised, but not ""watered down"" at all; i would (and will) definitly drink this beer again ..."
"Drinkability- A delicious beer, one of the better SA's Ive had, I would love to kick back with the Pats or Red Sox and a few of these!"
"Poured a light brown almost orangy with off white head that leaves lacing on my glass. The smell is sweet and malty good smell. It has a good taste sweet malts and finishes a little hoppy. Good amount of carbonation light body fairly smooth. Over all this is a drinkable beer good taste and fairly smooth I'd get it again."
"D- this is the boston beer company meyn! u know what it iz."
"D: Really smooth and distinctive with esters mixed with a nice hoppy bite."
"Decent ale. Not hoppy like I expected, which to me, is GOOD! Very nice balance of malts and hops. Very crisp, clean, and drinkable, in my opinion. Good malt flavors and a tiny hop bite at the end...but not too much. Nice brew. Recommended! Cheers and SAAALUTE my BA friends!"
"Mouthfeel is full, yet also crisp and a bit dry. Nice"
"D: This beer has a great flavor. This beer is not overly heavy. This beer is not hard to drink."
"This beer poured an amber color with a nice light head. The head settled into a small layer over the length of the beer and left a lacing down the side of the glass. Good carbonation. It has a strong malt aroma with a flowery hop in the back. Its a light smell over all but sweet and enticing. The beer tastes strong of malt with a little grain and a nice hop finish. Not a lot of bit but rather a sweet hop that finishes nicely. The beer is clean and crisp. It had a good carbonation that helps the beer go down smooth and refreshing. This beer is very drinkable. It has all the qualities that you would expect from Sam Adams Boston Ale. Its a smooth beer that drinks easy and has a good flavor. Its nothing that will knock you down but for a beer with dinner or after a long days work this is the Sam Adams to grab."
" Overall I was happy to finally try the Boston Ale. I could not belive that I had actually never tried it earlier. I would have thought I had this one years ago but it was also the lager that crossed my path. I found this to be very enjoyable and a true session ale in every sense of the word. Perfect with dinner or the game or mowing the yard, quality offering here."
"This was not one of my favorites out of the mix-pack. It has a decent drinkability but nothing too exciting overall..."
"This beer is very drinkable. A nice overall ale. I wouldn't mind draining a few on a warm summer day."
"A very good way to start off the Samuel Adams collection. I think this brew is much better than SA's Boston Lager. 12 oz. bottle with a nice frothy head that retains real well. Citrusy smells and light caramel malts. Taste is an immediate sour tang from the citrus, followed by sweet malts and hops in the back. Very crisp taste and medium-bodied. I think for someone knew to Samuel Adams, Boston Ale would be a better choice than Boston Lager. Consistency, taste, mouthfeel are all higher in quality in its Ale over its Lager."
"This is a malt-mouth's pale ale, and one that tastes more English than American. Lots of caramel, toasty, and dextrin flavors in the beer, ended by a touch of hops. When this beer warms up, it is at its optimal window for consumption. I was delighted by this beer, as well as the first time I found this on draft."
"This is a very sessionable beer. Decent taste for an ale."
"You can taste the light hops along with some maltiness and sweetness-very easy going down and tasty but not too strong. Not too complex, but definitely a nice tasting session beer that I would try more of if I get my chance."
"D: Definitely a drinkable beer. Good tasting, crisp, and refreshing that was very easy to drink. Definitley a nice, chill beer to have before bed."
"Another solid beer from Sam Adams that I wouldn't turn my nose up at, but it's doubtful I'll purchase this one again although I'd try it on tap if given the chance."
"This orangey beer has a very sweet malty aroma absent of any hops. Taste is solid, some sweet maltiness at the front with a nice hop bite at the end with a smooth dry finish. I like this as a session beer more than the lager because of the hoppiness at the end. A very tasty and drinkable pale ale."
"The taste has a great malt flavour up front....semi sweet caramel dominates initially. In the background, I get some good hop character by way of hop oil and some grassiness. Further sips in and some grain shows up and it's all done very well. Very smooth, very tasty, both of which make it very drinkable. Now I'm noting some earthy tones as well. How the heck did this one fly so long under my radar?? Very very well crafted brew that I should start enjoying more often. The mouthfeel is just right for the style and the finish is just slightly bitter but overall, the balance just leaves me shaking my head. Darn good stuff!!"
"I could drink a million of these... while not exceptional, it's a solid, flavorful beer that goes down very easily! Much better than the SA Cherry Wheat; I'm glad I gave ole' Sam another chance."
"I really enjoyed this. Attractive reddish-amber color with slight head. Smoother and more flavorful than the Boston Lager which I prefer it to. A very drinkable beer. Flavor has a bit of citrus and also fruity aroma. Nothing spectacular but a very drinkable ale."
"Personally I would call this an English pale ale since the hopping is a little more earthy and balanced but it's still a fine beer regardless of style jargon. This is a pretty difficult beer to find which is a shame since it's probably my favorite Sam Adam's beer."
"Tastes dry malt grainy. Hops are modest but facilitate the dried out malt that has a hint of baker's chocolate. Strong carbonation adds a sour tinge. Overall, missing the esters I'd espect in an ale and the hops are less than I'd expect for an APA. Not very complex, but was enjoyable. Md-thick mouthfeel."
"D: I've had better pale ales and would choose a lot of others above this before comming back to this one, but to be fair this beer is not too hard to drink and is quite refreshing."
"Overall a nice offering, has a little of everything, very sessionable."
"Pours a clear golden amber with a nice dense off-white head that left some nice lacing on the side of the glass. The smell is rather faint, some caramel malt, some fruity esters, and a hint of hops. The taste is of buttery caramel malt, maybe a bit toasted. Some hops detected on the backend to add a bitter kick. The feel is moderate and has a creamy texture to it, finishes a tad bitter. One of the better SA offerings, this brew is well balanced for some easy drinking."
"Recommended"
"The thickness is a nice creamy feel that leaves a film behind. It's easy to drink, even if it is just a *little* too sweet for my liking. Still, it's quite a solid, sweeter-than-normal ale."
"Drank this from a 12 oz bottle with a best-by date of December 2007. Poured into my new Mikasa ale glass. Medium-sized white head that dissipated pretty quickly after the pour. It's a beautiful golden-red color. Very appealing. Smells and tastes center around the toasted malts. Nice, toasted sweet flavors. Hints of dark fruit like cherries. Little bit of hop bitterness in the aftertaste. Clean, malty finish that I love. Perfect medium mouthfeel. Overall, a nice balanced ale. Not terribly complex, but still wonderfully drinkable. A very strong offering from Sam Adams."
"Very mellow ale, well balanced and easy to drink. Not really exceptional in any way, but more than adequate."
"drinkability - Haven't had this one in a long time. My ol stompin grounds. Wish I had this on tap right now. great beer."
"This beer tastes slightly different from the last time I had it. It's less malty and more buttery than I remember. Still quite good, though."
"Drinkability: Again, another solid brew from Sam Adams excluding a seasonal variety. There are bolder and more experimental brews in the style of course, but this is especially nice for a balanced brew with a bite for summer."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle with best by notch on side of label into a pint glass. It was a clear copper color. It had a good sized head that slowly settled to a film. Very good lacing. The mouthfeel was nice and crisp with good carb. The aroma was toasted caramel malts and a slighly fruity sweetness. Did really make think of an APA though. The taste was good at first but then got better as it warmed up. Not a ""taste"" beer but could be a decent session beer. Overall, pretty good and worth trying and one of the few Sam Adams to live up to the hype. (3.5, RB-mOAY, T, Y)"
"I think I'd take SABL over this, but a solid brew. This is the other end of the APA spectrum, totally different than SNPA or Stone. I find it has some similar characteristics to SABL in the hop taste and overall experience, but obviously sweeter and less toasty. Nice beer."
"M/D - Fairly carbonated which contributes to the spicy feel. I've always liked Boston Ale, but wouldn't ask for it w/ other Sammy's styles on tap. Drinks well during this cold spring day but doesn't seem to go well w/ summer weather like I thought it would, being a Pale Ale."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied. Extremely easy to drink. Definitely a decent session beer. Overall, it's a pretty good beer. I don't think it's one of the best Sam Adams beers out there. But, it's a good solid beer nonetheless."
"Drinkability is very good, the easy and agreeable flavors make this a definite session beer."
"This was very nice, very easy to drink, and a well balanced ale. There were no dead spots that I noticed. While not a taste bomb, it isn't meant to be, and its a good, easy to drink example of the style. Could be sessioned easily, and I could see it going great with anything involving cheddar cheese (cheeseburger, soup, a hearty salad, deli sandwich, etc.). Would definitely drink this again, and would encourage others to give it a try."
"D- this is fairly drinkable. Im surprised I didnt pick this one up earlier. very solid."
"You can find it everywhere and you can stock it easily. Very well done to Sammy A."
"I have no idea why breweries brew more than one style of beer and slap different names on them? Anyway, Sam Adam's Boston Ale pours a reddish-copper color. The aroma resembles mostly malt with some hint of alcohol in the background. The taste is much of the same. There's that sweetness at the beginning that I also noticed in the Pale Ale. Still too much malt flavor for my liking. It feels to me like SA didn't really try on this beer and that's never a good thing. I hope SA doesn't decide to make an IPA because so far, their Pale Ales are too similar and unimpressive."
"D - Smooth, not too heavy. Good session beer, though not my favorite."
"Good brown tan color, not much head that dissipates quickly into no head. Smell is strong sweet malt. Little hops in the nose. Taste is again strong malt, cereal grains, medicinal hops creep up next. The bitter is too dominating in the finish. Mouthfeel is a bit fizzy, but the gravity is good for this brew. Easy drinking for sure, but the taste leaves a bit to be desired."
"there actually seems to be a bit of caramel in the beer. the smell is not strong the appearance is standard. This beer overall is a good standard ale. it does not wow me at all, but its above the avg beer you might get. if you want to start at an ale, or get a better than avg beer on a menue, get this beer. I good standbye beer."
"On the palate the light caramel malt comes through plenty of hops to round it out. To me this is a very balanced, highly drinkable pale ale. Nice caramel malt focus, British leanings perhaps, and also very drinkable."
"Poured into a pint glass, pours a nice orange rustic color with a fluffy head that leaves some serious lace on the glass. Smell is very bready and yeasty with just a bit of citrus bite. Taste is very dry and earty with a bit of weed and bark in this just a bit of hop bitterness, not very balanced at all and very heavy carbonation. I guess this is a allright offering but nothing to write home about."
"My friends and I used to refer to this one as ""The Streets of Boston"" because we thought it tasted dirty... in a good way. This unique beer may not be the best choice for the uninitiated, but it is worth cracking once in a while for those with the ability to decipher the unusual combination of flavors."
"Not bad. Another beer worth grabbing once and awhile from SA."
"Samuel Adams was born and died in Boston, but this ale has a much more European feel to it than American. I'm not really sure what to call it, but you can't really compare it to other pale ales. ""Stock Ale"" makes me think of Old Ale, which I wouldn't call this either...it doesn't really matter, its something different that you can find just about anywhere."
"Not bad for a macro, but it can get a lot better."
"Nice combo between a lager and ale, most everybody should enjoy this brew"
"Pours from the bottle a lovely copper color with a one finger head that settles into a light collar. Modest carbonation, a few bubbles rise slowly to the top. There is a sweetness to the aroma, an unexpected fruity/bubblegum aroma that is a pleasant surprise. Taste starts out with a mild maltiness that turns into a sharp, dry, biting hoppiness. Mouthfeel is somewhat light but I can't really classify it as watery. All-in-all, this is a pretty good beer, right up there with Sierra Nevada Pale Ale (my current benchmark for APAs). SNPA is my #1 choice, but if it's not available i'll gladly drink Sam Adams Ale all day long instead."
"A pretty good pale ale from Sam Adams. Not my first choice but worth drinking."
"Overall, a satisfyingly tasty beer. Nothing more nothing less."
"D: I remember loving this beer a few years ago. What happened? Drinkable but extremely dull and boring. Not enough hop character for evena n English pale ale. Pass."
"The smell reminded me of cotton candy. Don't ask me why, it just did. The flavor was just average. While drinking this ale, I was trying to figure out what the flavor was, but, the sour/tart feel in the mouth kept masking the flavor of the hops and roasted malts. It was jus an OK ale that will be good for hot summer day's to cool one off!"
"this beer looks really nice in the glass. deep amber with a nice off-white head. good lacing. i picked up some caramel sweetness in the smell but pretty mellow. the taste is a nice balance of caramel, herbal notes, and good hop bitterness. finishes bitter but nicely so. i think i prefer this over the boston lager. would love to try it on tap."
"Pours a slightly dull, toasty amber with beaten gold highlights and a thin head that fades to a ghost of a collar in no time. The nose is quite bracing with malts and zesty hops balancing each other out. Lemon grass notes and dry, toasty English malts. On the palate, brisk hops first off, then some very well-balanced sweet malts/dusky hops at the mid-palate. Toasty, lightly malty and very sessionable. Mouthfeel is excellent -- just enough weight to the malts, with hops that make things a little lighter, quench the thirst, and prompt further drinking. Very good beer. Highly drinkable and sessionable, with some integrated flavors that are tasty and smooth."
"Bottle smell is sweet and malty with hints of cinnamon. Pours to a yellow bronze with a lacy foamy head. Taste is sweet with hints a cinnamon and a hoppy finish. Mouthfeel is good, carbonation is just right. A good brew, a liitle sweet for my tastes. A little more hopping would make it very delicious. I wouldn't go out of my way to look for it but if someone gave me one I'd quaff it."
"Another middle of the road beer from Sam Adams."
"D - Although it tastes almost exactly like the other darker SA beers I wont take points off. It is a really boring beer though."
"Crystal clear amber with a fluffy, off-white head. Long lasting foam produced a good amount of lacing. There was a nice mix of malt, earthy hops and light fruit in the aroma. Solid, herbal bitterness that really lingered long into the finish. Malt was prominent in the front, with a bit of brown sugar and toasted marshmallow flavour. Hops were less evident, but still earthy, maybe a bit spicy as well. The body was on the light side, carbonation moderate, with a creamy texture and light dryness. Overall, a well made beer. I was surprised by the bitterness level and restrained hop character, but enjoyed it quite a bit."
"Poured from 12oz bottle. pours reddish brown color with head that subsides to just a thin layer. Not much smell going on but you can smell a tad of the hops in this. first taste is has big carbonation on the back of the throat and you can taste a bit of a bitterness in it. After the initial taste the carbonation subsides and I can taste some roastiness in it. I can tell it is very low in alcohol content by the taste too. This is a beer I would definitely recommend to someone who wants to have more than a few drinks and not get too intoxicated. This is a very good drinkable beer! First time trying it too."
"Hearty Pale Ale. Refreshing and decently tasty. Sweet malt base is understated with a fine hop flavor and bitter edge. Nothing wonderful, nothing bad. I would gladly drink Boston Ale with dinner, a meat & potato type meal."
"Drinkability is like...WOW.... Thelow alcohol content is nice because it makes this great tasting beer so drinkable... I love a strong ale but this one is fun because you can keep drinking it without getting too trashed lol...."
"This ale pours a brilliant golden/light amber color with a white head that lingered through most the beer leaving a nice lace on the glass, an impressive appearance. The aroma is moderately sweet, caramel sweetness, it almost smells like there may be a small amount of some black malt and there are also elements of alcohol or wine-like aroma. Hop aroma is low, just a bit of spicy hop aroma. The beer has an initially caramel sweet taste, yet still balanced by hop bitterness. After the initial sweetness, the beer turns and finishes dry and almost wine-like, there also seems to be a bit of a metallic after taste. The carbonation is moderate with a medium body and somewhat smooth. Overall I found this beer to be decent, not the best beer from Sam Adams. It is an attractive looking beer, has a good balance, but I really do not care for the finish. I dont know if the wine-like, metallic finish and after taste is intended by yeast strain selection or an off-flavor. The aroma advertised the taste well, but I didnt find it overly inviting."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle purchased as part of a ""Brewmasters Collection"". Nice copper color with decent head. Malty caramel aroma. Not terribly heavy. Not overly carbonated. Very easy to drink. Not nearly as 'flavorful' as some other beers i've had recently, but it would be a good lunch or early dinner beer."
"Heartier in flavor than their Boston Lager. SA Boston Ale isn't quite as bitter as the Boston Bee company's flagship beer either. Solid session beer that would seem to pair well with most foods."
"Mouthfeel is spot on for an APA. Easy to drink, perfect session beer. Classic American Pale."
"Drinkability: I really don't care for the flavors here - the sweetness becomes almost cloying and really conlicts with the bitter flavors creating an almost medicinal flavor"
"Pours a light amber color with a solid 1/2 inch head. Aroma: quite malty and candyish with a good bit of perfumy hops. Taste: lots of sweet caramelly malt flavors with a nice hop bitterness in the finish. Hops have a definite British character(Fuggles or Goldings?). Mouthfeel was pretty light, however this beer still packs quite a bit of flavor. Drinkability was very good. If I remember correctly, this was Sam Adams second offering after Boston Lager back in the late 80's or early 90's. It used to be one of my favorites and now I know why. It's a solid beer, tasty and sessionable."
"Drinkability: Though simple, it is a fairly tasty, satisfying session beer."
"pours a bright copper penny color with a two or three finger head depending on your pour with a fair lacing to the finish. very simular to samuel adams boston lager. smell is bready, toffee, and hoppy. taste same with middle of the road flavor not weak but not to strong. very good balance of malt and hop, smooth with lots of carbonation. just a great beer for your everyday drinking."
"d - goes down smoothly but this is overall a nondescript brew."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a honey-orange color with a minimal white, soapy head. The smell is very sweet and of grain. The taste is very interesting, well balanced with hops, but it has a flavor I can't quite put my finger on... but I like it. The mouthfeel is light, but it has viscous, creamy carbonation. This is a very drinkable beer and pretty tasty too. I prefer this over the Boston Lager any day."
"Medium-light bodied with perhaps just a bit too much carbonation, feels almost like I'm drinking a heavy soda. Finishes somewhat dry with a metallic tang. All in all mouthfeel is ok, I wouldn't call it average, but I don't think that it deserves below a three. Drinkability-there's much better out there, from just the few APAs I've sampled this I know. This just doesn't cut it."
"D: Easily a beer to be repetitively quaffed at any occasion. A beer that would be equally at home while mowing the yard as it would be washing down a $30 New York strip. A fine beer for sure."
"Ive always enjoyed this beer, often preferring it to the ubiquitous SA lager. It pours a rich and clear copper color. The head is brilliant white, stable, but modestly thin. A welcoming caramel smell greets the nose, followed by an herbal hoppiness, and some fruit (apricots). As the brew warms, a decidedly doughiness comes out as well. The taste presents a nice toasted malt flavor, but is slightly dry. Its a medium-light bodied brew, and incredibly easy to drink. This is a heck of a session brew."
"I guess when it comes right down to it, this is the stuff taht first made me think there could be beer that was just plain better, better ingresients, better taste, just as consistent as the macros. Even if it is a ""craft beer with training wheels""- this one is pretty good."
"I definately suggest that if you are either a beginner drinker, or want a type of ""stock beer"" that you can go to again and again, then Sam Adams Boston Ale is the beer for you. It gives you all the base characteristics of a good beer, and allows you to have a good platform to other beers. Try it out (I definately suggest the Sam Adams mix pack or six or twelve) ... you won't be dissapointed."
"extremely drinkable."
"I used to like this more years ago. Since then it seems eclipsed by the ever-growing number of craft pale ales. It's a bit bland by today's standards. Still, it's easy enough to drink and serves as a decent ""session"" brew."
"Boston Ale pours a golden orange color with small white head and a few bubbles of carbonation working their way up from the bottom of the glass. The head fades to a thin cap after a few minutes and there is some lacing. The smell is dominated by sweet caramel malt and that same character is prevalent in the taste. There is a nice clean hop finish to the taste as well. Mouthfeel is good for the style, not watery, but not too full either. This beer would be a good one to session. Recommended."
"Overall a very drinkable and sessionable ale. Easy and simple."
"On a winter day watching football I preferred this ""Stock Ale"" to the Sam Adams Lager"
"please drink responsibly or just pass out on your own couch!"
"Slainte!"
"D-very drinkable, an easy sessionable brew"
"You could drink a whole bunch of these but who in their right mind would want to?"
"Served in a pint glass, the beer pours an amber color with about an inch frothy off-white head. It smells like sweet malt, caramel, and a bit of hops. The taste starts out with malty, toasted sweetness and has a nice hop bitterness to it. Mouthfeel is light/medium, but very smooth and refreshing. Drinkability is pretty good. Overall I think it's a pretty decent beer, nice and sessionable."
"This is one of my favorite Sam Adams basically because i like Pale Ales and similar Lagers. It poured a dark amber similar to the Boston Lager but a little more brown rather than red. Its taste is also similar to the Bosotn Lager but its much more dry and has a more hopy taste. Overall a great beer."
"Overall, not among Sam's best but not terrible either."
"Samual Adams Boston Ale was orange-amber in color with good clarity. The off-white head was medium in size and had good retention, leaving lots of lace behind. The aroma was nice and malty. The taste was malty as well, a little toasty with some refreshing hops and a dry finish. This beer was medium bodied with medium carbonation. Drinkability was good. It's another fine beer from the Boston Beer Company."
"drinkability: fine"
"12 oz bottle with a date of Feb 2007. A very nice looking brown/amber color with a nice one finger head that dissapates rather quickly. It has a nice full sweet aroma to it. Very smooth when it hits the tounge with good carbonation (a little too much, but still good). It could have had a little more kick to it, but still tasted good. The beer laces nicely down the side of the glass. A very good Ale, and very drinkable. This is everything I have come to expect with Sam Adams. This went well with a meatloaf and pasta, and really brought out the seasoning choices of a 75+ year old recipie. Another great beer by Sam Adams."
"12oz. bottle, with a freshness date of May, 2007. The beer poured a nice brown, with a 1/2 inch head, that left nice lacing on the glass. The aroma is slightly sweet, maltiness. Mouthfeel is medium, just above light. The flavor is wonderful! Everything you would expect from a Sam Adams. Slight roastiness, that balances out just right with the other flavors. Easily a session beer, and the quality that you would expect from Sam Adams. This is what a session beer should be."
"Goes very well with some salty pigs in the blanket. Accentuates the sweetness & tart to balance the spread that the Giants will obviously never cover."
"Drinkability: A very drinkable stock ale. Really nice flavors to the brew , i like the slight toasted / burnt sugar quality. Would be a welcome sight to see it on tap."
"I consider this an everyday drinkable beer. Not great, but certainly far above anything AB has to offer. It was a clear orange color with a pretty thick white head. Not much aroma, kind of outdoorsy. A nice hops presence, a little bread. A good beer to drink a few of."
"This isn't a bad ale but there are many better out there. It pours a decent head and does leave nice lacing down the glass. Has a boozy aftertaste with some nice caramel and some fruit (cherry maybe) sprinkled in there. A nice beer, kinda hard to find and although not my favorite, I will drink it anywhere I can find it."
"It has a typical Amber color for an ale with a nice aroma. A good bitter intitial flavor leaving the mouth tingly at the start and at the finish giving a good portion of hops for an American mass produced product. Leaves a nice malty flavor on ones palate. Overall a good drinking ale."
"I get this everytime we go to Uno's. It's really the only draft selection I can drink. Overall, a solid enough beer for me to get by."
"I find the Ale to be very good and easy to drink. It is refreshing and light. It is definately worth drinking regularly."
"D: This is defenitely meant to be a session beer, as it's not a ""knock your socks off"" pale ale. I really like this style, and the beer is highly drinkable. The BBC does it again, with a very well balanced sessionable brew. They may never be known for the greatest beers among enthusiasts as most of their brews don't have the most flavor, but in my opinion, they are the absolute king of session beers."
"Pours a hazy orange color with a huge thick head of large off white bubbles. Head is creamy and lasts the entire drinking experience. Aroma is caramel sweetness. Flavor follows suit. Moderate bitterness shows up in the aftertaste. This is a perfect session beer. Not too much of anything, just a very well balanced easy drinking brew. I would agree with the label that states smoother than most ales and richer than most lagers with a round, robust taste. Nice, simple beer."
"D: Nice interpretation in the vein of a straight up ale. Would have another for the mouthfeel and dynamic of flavors, yet also its simplicity."
"Pours a nice amber color with a somewhat creamy off-white head. Smells of sweet malts, spices and floral hops; very inviting. Taste is very well balanced with sweet malts upfront with some hop bitterness at the finish and some indescribable fruit flavors. Mouthfeel is good, nice medium body with a nice bit of crisp carbonation. Good drinkability with nicely balanced flavors and low ABV. I think this beer is under-rated. Give this a try."
"grabbed this at the atlanta airport for $6 for 20 ounces on draft. didn't know too much about this ale, like that is was a pale ale. just like its lager counterpart, I thought this was one well rounded beer. nice creamy head and great amount of hops. a bit costly, but that's the airport for you."
"This beer is getting a high score not because I'm biased towards Sam Adams, but because this beer is truely exceptional. It's comforting to know you can find a beer of this quality with this flavor just about anywhere in the country, on-tap or in the bottle. To me this beer is more of an English Pale Ale, with the hops being present but not potent or bittering like in the American Pale Ale versions. All classificatoins aside, there is only way to describe this beer: solid."
"Pours a medium amber color with a moderate head that has modest retention. Mild hoppy aroma, smells well balanced, and is. The carbonation gives a crisp, refreshing taste that makes this go down smoothly; adding to it's drinkability. Ranks up there with the Black Lager as my favorite Sam Adams offerings."
"Overall it's a fairly average ale, but by no means bad."
"The perfect everyday beer.The perfect beer to give to the BMC drinker wanting to try something different."
"Drinkability--This is a fun beer to drink"
"for those who don't want a light beer, but don't want to compromise taste...this is a good brew...not as full flavored as their lager..but a good pale ale...very much like other good pale ales...not too sweet..but very flavorful."
"Overall not a bad APA, I like mine a bit more on the hoppy side but this was a quality brew."
"A bit hoppy, a bit earthy / musty with a lageresque finish. Not bad and easy to drink as a session brew. The crew enjoyed it. Lot's of other reviews already posted so I'll leave it at micro classic and still worth bringing to a party. Easy to find as well."
"On tap at the original Pizzeria Uno in Chicago on Ohio Street. The glass arrived at the table with almost no head. The beer is amber in color. The aroma is on the malty side. I don't think this is that great of a beer tastewise, almost seems like there's some diacetyl, or something along those lines going on. Malt comes out up front with some hop toward the end. I'd probably go with something else."
"A solid beer. Not fantastic, but pretty good. I was expecting more hoppiness. Still miles above any macro, but I've had better pale ales and better beers from Sam Adams (their Boston Lager, for one). Still a good drinker with no obvious flaws. Recommended, but don't expect to be blown away."
"I had this at Samual Adams Celebrates Pittsburgh in the Pittsburgh airport. An all-around tasty ale. Copper-colored body covered with a fairly sticky off-white head. The smell is familiar -- it smells a lot like their lager. Which is not necessarily a bad thing. It tastes a lot like it, too. Where it differs is that familiar fruity yeasty zing that tickles your tongue at the end of the swallow. It's nice. Pretty well balanced (maybe on the sweet side, if you ask me). With a slightly heavy mouthfeel, moderate carbonation and good drinkability."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodided, nicely carbonated, and the finish is just slightly dry. This highly highly drinkable, and could easily become a staple in my fridge. I love this stuff."
"A solid drinker."
"CONDITIONS: MOWING/WORKING ON CAR- n WITH FRIENDS- y SIPPING- y GET MY BUZZ ON- y"
"Once again, another fine brew from the Boston Beer Company."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into pint glass. Nice two finger head that stuck around for a while and left some nice lacing. Beer tastes sweet, but balanced with hints of caramel. You don't taste the hops very much on this one, but you notice them enough for it to taste refreshing. Personally I prefer this over their flagship Boston Lager."
"Mouthfeel is decent. There is a nice carbonation level and the beer is medium bodied, and a little sticky. Pretty decent brew from Boston Beer, I would prefer a little more hoppieness but it is a solid beer and I am likely to pick it up again."
"This beer poured a deep golden amber color. The smell is sweet and malty. The taste is malty and well balanced with light hops. This is a nice mellow beer. The mouthfeel is full and slightly chewy. I consider this a highly drinkable beer that goes down smooth."
"Smell hints at caramel... Smells similar to a scotch ale. Amber body with little head to speak of. Tastest yeasty and sweet, with some malt. Definitely different than I thought. Not such a bad little beer. Not something Id seek out, but I like it better than most of the Sam Adams beers Ive tried."
"I don't know where this beer has been all my life. Somehow I've never picked it up."
"Pours a hazy orange color with creamy white head and some lacing. The aroma is sweet malts, fruit and some herbal hop aromas. Taste is malty with some noticeable hop bitterness and vague fruit flavor. Medium bodied. This is one of Sam Adam's better beers in my opinion."
"Pours a dark amber, perfectly transparent, with a white head that fades fast. Smell has caramel, cream, and wheat notes. Start is rough, wet, and bitter. Settles even more rough and quite full-bodied. Lots of hop bitterness and caramel character are obvious. This beer also seems slightly sweet to me; perhaps there is a hint of orange included? Finish is dry and bitter (duh!) with a pleasant aftertaste."
"Fairly low alcohol and the great taste with a nice balance make this very drinkalble. I don't think this beer gets enough credit."
"D: This is nice. A buddy once told me that he thought the Boston Ale and Boston Lager were the same beer. They taste totally different, though the color may be similar. And I'm not sure I would have guessed ""American Pale Ale"" if I did this tasting blind. It's too malty, more English than American."
"Very drinkable ale. One of the best ""True"" american pale ales."
"Eric"
"Hard to find as I only tried it as a part of a SA Mix 12'er."
"12oz. bottle. The beer poured a slightly hazy dark gold, with some hints of orange. A large off-white head formed and faded fast. The aroma was mainly hops of the citrus variety, with a bit of malt coming through and providing a honey smell. Taste was qutie good, the malts hit first and had a bit of a toasted flavor - not much, but surprising. The malt increased in sweetness/fruit as the beer warmed. The hops were quite mild and balanced the malt nicely. The finish seemed to be a bit peppery and acidic, but again, nicely in balance. Mouthfeel was a medium bodied beer, with medium carbonation and very thirst quenching. Overall, an enjoyable beer which improved as it warmed."
"Drinkability-Very refreshing. I find good Ales to be very refreshing. This one caught me by surprise. I never tried any Sam Adams beers until recently because I felt that they were too macro. I was wrong."
"12 ounce bottle."
"Only an average beer offering from a brewery I had come to regard with higher esteem. Would work as a pairing for a chicken dish without much additional flavor, such as grilled or fried chicken sandwich. Better then a macro, but there are better choices for pale ale."
"This one tasted just like Sam Adams Boston Lager but a bit lighter, however, not as light as Sam Adams Light. So I guess you could call it Sam Adams Not-So-Light."
"Pours clean and light golden with a small off white head. I get more hops than anything else in the head, a little grass, some spice. IT tastes fairly clean, a little malt, but again, hops are dominating here. The hops do a linger a bit on the finish, but basically it's fairly refreshing."
"Clean and refreshing feel, goes down pretty easy."
"I like this beer better than the Boston Lager; it's a bit more complex (but not much more). Pretty decent brew."
"This beer is pretty easy to find at most good beer shops. It's a reliable beer for a meal or a night out."
"The combined smell and taste followed by a great body and drinkability measure make this an excellent choice for any palate. An excellent choice for a fridge stocker."
"Nice pale color with a soft white head leaving a nice lacing. Toffee, caramel, and light floral hops in the nose. Much of the same in the taste, with a slight hoppy finish. High carbonation and medium bodied. Pretty solid choice here, I could have this on occasion."
"I had to edit this, the malt flavor comes out more as it warms up. When it's cold it's all hops."
"I like this. I didn't immediately label it as a Pale Ale upon trying it: maybe a decently hopped ESB or Amber Ale? It has a really nice maltiness and maybe a more spicy, peppery hop flavor (as opposed to fruit/pine oriented which i find prominent in other easily-acquired, major market pale ales). I used to disrespect Sam Adams, but lately I've retried several of their beers and found all three passable or better. May this review serve as a retraction of those statements. Except for the one to the effect that their television ads are indeed as corny and contrived as the commercials for any other product. I'm impressed with the product, though, so I'm willing to ignore the advertisements and proceed to pick more of these up (I only bought one this evening) on the way home from work tomorrow."
"Adam"
"From the tap, and far too cold. Yellow appearance with a small head of white foam. Not so amber, more golden brown. Aromas of fresh mashed malts and grain. Taste is similar to smell; malt, grain, raw molassas, a touch of hops. Mouthfeel was unremarkable, yet acceptable. Drinkability is decent. Not bad with the pizza I had. Worth a try. Then move on."
"A very nice pale ale which can be enjoyed with about any dish or gathering. The alcohol is low enough to to drink a few without worrying about calling a taxis."
"This is by far my favorite Sam Adams brew, it's just so damn solid. All around this is quite possibly the most well-rounded brew I have tasted. All the qualitys just blend so nicely together. Great session brew, and defintely one of the best American brewed ale to date. Sam Adams has a gem with these, and at $5.99 a 6 pack, it's quite a wonderful deal."
"D - slightly above average, a nice ale that is easy to throw back, and not too bitter throw off the casual beer enthusiast"
"Sam Adams Boston Ale is quite decent. Its a good beer to have on a chill friday night of catching up with friends."
"Slàinte!"
"This doesn't seem like a beer I could get into, but without a doubt I will try this again at warmer temperatures and see if it's better like everyone says it is."
"That being said...you can never go wrong with a Sam Adams Boston Ale. It's well-made, easy to drink, and has just enough flavor to satisfy..."
"Taste & Mouthfeel - Delicious. Malt dominates as expected, but there is a very very fesh hop presence. Kent goldings? Slight Grainyness . About mid sip there is a slight bitterness like a hint of grapefruit peel. Finishes with what tastes like sweet wort. Carbonation is moderate. Very smooth- nearly lager-like in some respects."
"Drinkability - Beer could eventually wear on me because of the mildly bitter aftertaste, but I would buy a six-pack of this brew. Recommended."
"PH"
"Notes: Pretty boring. Along the line of most brews I've had from this company. Inoffensive, decent, but nothing more."
"CRUX: GOOD ALE HERE. I like this better than their Boston lager, and have yet to meet someone who didn't like this beer. Solid. Solid. Solid. (Like a Rock.) This beer is welcome in my DBF (and pallette) at any time."
"I wonder what this would taste like on tap. My best bet for that is to hit the Sam Adams brew pub at Concourse A at Hartsfield Int'l in Atlanta. One reason to fly Delta!"
"Verysimiliar to an english ESB. Flavors are balanced, buttery, and mellow. A solid brew."
"Overall a very easy to drink and enjoyable offering."
"This is a really solid English pale/bitter and definately one of the better Samuel Adams brews."
"Golden amber with sparse carbonation and a just slightly off-white head. Aroma is sweet caramel with some spicy hop notes -- seems to be an English buttery diacetyl thing going on, too. Bready caramel flavors up front with some floral and not-quite-citrusy hop character. Slight diacetyl flavor. Mineral finish and earthy-floral-doughy aftertaste. This reminds me quite a bit of Middle Ages Syracuse Pale Ale, with less fruit characteristics. Nicely attenuated carbonation in the mouthfeel. Light (but not extremely so) body, and overall lively. Quaffable, indeed, but maybe only when in the mood for a bit of butter in your beer."
"Wow, I am very impressed. I am not one to get excited about pale ale's, but this is the best I've had thus far. It's tastes kind of leafy in the same way that really good unsweetened tea does. I think this would be a great cross-over beer for somone who wants to get away from the fizzy yellow stuff. I don't think it's the best Sam Adam's has to offer, but I would never turn one down."
"Excellent session beer for those that are partial to malt dominated beers, enjoyable."
"This is a very basic beer. The beer appears a reddish color with a nice frothy head. It has a grainy smell with a slight sweetness. It tastes a little caramelly, with a slight biting hoppiness over the tongue. Overall, not much here, but it is pretty pleasant."
"D: I guess it is okay for steady APA drinkers, but nothing to quaff; just like other APAs."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer has a light body and ample carbonation. The beer is very easy to drink. The beer is a very sessionable beer treat. I would never turn down an offer to drink this beer."
"Cheers2Beers"
"A high-quality brew that lives in the shadow of the lager. Great stuff."
"The mouthfeel is good and heavy, lots of carbonation on the tongue. Finishes with some hop dryness. Good but not great."
"Highly drinkable..."
"D- i'd definitely have this again(next time im at unos, probably!)"
"Drinkability: Another relaxing, unpretentious offering from SA. Definitely easy to drink!"
"In short, there's not going to be anything new here for anybody who has run out of fingers and toes with which to count the number of different beers tried, but you could definitely do a lot worse than this one."
"Pours a very rich golden tan with a frothy white head. Looks like a standard beer with a bit deeper hue. Not much aroma here, mostly hops with a bit of the Sam Adams kick. A lighter flavor for Sam, but as in all their selections this is a very balanced beer. I can appreciate this even though it does not necessarily fit the style of beer it is titled to. The taste is driven by a slight taste of hops which is more apparent in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is again balanced and really hits the spot. The lighter feel and weak flavor actually compliment each other here with a powerful aftertaste which allows for easy consumption. A beer I would recommend for those who are not fans of hoppy beers but would like to respect them for the flavor they can bring to a beer. This beer is worth a try, but I wouldnt go out of my way to find it."
"Pale muted amber, between a dark pale ale and a light amber ale. Pours a steady yellow head, and leaves a dolop of foam in the bottom of the glass. Smells like their Boston lager mostly, but slightly more muted and not as clean, more ale like of course. Taste is not as expected, an odd aftertaste that I'm not sure I like, I detect cotton candy somewhere in there, too. Rich flavor compared to a macro lager, light for an amber ale, and slightly off for an APA. Of course, it's actually a ""stock ale."" Makes me wish I were drinking the boston lager instead, though. Taste is fair though. Mouthfeel is excessively carbonated with a medium low depth of body. Taste is better when carbonation dissipates some, and the subtlties come through. But overall, not for me. Your mileage may very."
"Not sure whether all of this was the bar's fault or the brewer's, but not a good time. I will try the bottle at some point and re-review."
"Notes: Reminds me of an ESB, not an APA. The hop flavors are way off, but overall it is a good beer. Its drinkable. The low carbonation really hurt the head formation."
"This is a great ale, like a lightly hopped ESB. Ive been waiting to try it for years and Im not dissapointed. Not as hoppy or complex as the Boston lager, but still great."
"Yummm. This poured a pretty orange-gold color with a decent amount of carbonation and a foamy white head. The smell is sweet and tasty with a nice balance of hop and malt presence. The taste was sweet and caramelly with great malt aftertaste and a nice but light hop presence. The mouthfeel was kinda tingly from the carbonation but overall quite moderate that leaves a nice slick coated feeling to the tounge. Oh man, this is so drinkable! A lot more than the boston lager(which I enjoy). A perfectly balanced brew."
"What a big butter bomb. Hard to drink."
"Light amber in color with a reasonable white head. The smell has grassy hops, sweet malts, and even a little funky yeasty smell. The taste is similar to the smell, but I get a tiny hint of something fruity as well. The mouthfeel is highly carbonated, and the body is pretty light. Overall this beer is not great, but that wont stop me from lining them up and knocking them down."
"First draught tasted of thick, full-bodied, grassy malts, with a robust bitterness the nicely balanced the mouth feel from start to finish. The descriptor on the bottle tells of a cellar-aging process. I suspect that is an aspect of the brewing that brough out the depth of flavor in this hearty, satisfying drink. Yum and YUM!"
"Pours an amber color with a thin head that fades quickly. Aroma of toasted malt with a slight hop overtone. Taste is fruity, and slightly hoppy but with an odd sourness in the finish. The sourness turns me off a bit on this brew, I much prefer the Boston Lager. This doesn't seem very balanced, I can think of many APA's I would prefer over it. A bit tiresome to drink more than a couple."
"Other than that there is nothing special about this one. Is it a bad beer? No, but it doesn't do anything for me."
"Well, it's beer. Not any real problems, but no real stand out contributing flavors either. Medium body; not too sweet and not dull. Moderate malty sweetness, but not cloying. Nutty, fruity, and spicy, but not bold on either. Fruity (peaches and appricots) with hop spiciness. Hopped for solid bitterness and a mild hop flavor. Copper colored with a fair head retention. Finishes clean and fresh. Good beer, just nothing to latch on to."
"Nice, copper color. No head by the time it hits the table. Wonder what it ws like at the bar. Low aroma-decent mix of hops and malt though none of the two stand out. Nice, somewhat carmel like flavor. Definate hop bitterness to it. Reminds me of a mellowed Sam Adams. Good enough mouthfeel. Damn drinkable. I have had this several times at my local Uno Grill. Sometimes it is much fresher then others. Nice step up from my usual BUD at places like this. I often thought it tasted like a ""baby Sam"". I had NO IDEA it was contract brewed by them. Big world out there I guess..."
"Overall: This beer pulled me in a lot more than I guess I was expecting. There are a lot more nuances to this beer than my review attests to. Everything is very fresh and clean. A friend described it as being like after a short rain in the summer and I really can't argue with that fitting the beer."
"Clear copper color. Aroma is thick toffee & caramel. Hints of diacetyl in the flavor, but nothing overwhelming. It's definitely a wave of butterscotch and toffee that comes to a very bready and sweet finish. The mouthfeel is fairly thin, which makes this very easy to drink while still having enough body to hold the flavors well. Their Boston Ale has always been a solid beer, and it hasn't changed much over time."
"From a mix pack. Pours a nice amber gold color, similar to the boston lager. Can't smell much but that might just be me. Taste is really nice, a balance of sweet malt and hops with a dry biscuity flavor too. Nice mouthfeel, not thin. Overall a really nice beer. One of my faves, they can sell this along with their flagship lager as a regular beer. Sam Adams may be a big company but most of their beers are damn good."
"Notes- this is a very underated ale ( as in my opinon many SA offerings are) this is my go to ale when an English Brown is not availible. A person can also get this anywhere ( I assume you can, but I am from Western MA) and it is perfectly balanced, just enough complexity for a BA yet nothing over powering for someone used to macros."
"DA good solid beer. I have a hard time finding a dominate tasteits really well balanced. Could easily have a few more."
"Very satisfying."
"mapley color, very clear. spotty, patchy foam. has that sweet, malty, rich sam adams nose.. very similar to alot of their other low abv ales. marzen-ey in its malt richness with accenting spice. initially flavor kicks off with raw cinnamon stick dust followed up by caramel swirls.. finishes with a distinctive hop bitterness without much hop flavor. distinctly tin-foil aftertaste thing happening. very odd beer.. flavorful but lacking in any direction. koch has managed to make a rich, delicious beer here that leaves me frankly puzzled as to what the hell it is that i'm drinking. respectable, but i wouldn't opt for a six-pack."
"The sediment made me suspect the freshness of this beer; there was no packaging date, but this bottle claims not to ""expire"" until July '06."
"D - It's better than your average pale ale and really screams SESSION BEER!!!. An interesting enough flavor to make you want more and a beer you can put down all night. Wish they actually had this on tap at some bars in my area."
"Dry mouthfeel with some bitterness. Light bodied. This could be an everyday beer. Certainly better than some of the macros in my opinion. If the price were a little more affordable, this might be in my fridge everyday."
"D - The more I drink, the more I like the flavor. This would be a good beer to keep in mind if you are ordering in an establishment with limited selection."
"Verdict- This might be my favorite Sam Adams offering. It's deceptively complex, and very quaffable."
"Another good beer from Boston Brewing Company. Keep up the great work!!!"
"Taste:"
"A pretty tasty beer overall. Went well with the pizza. I'd not hesitate to order this again next time I visit Uno."
"A vigorous pour produced a prodigious head ... which was short lived. Not much in the way of aroma, as I stuck my nose into the glass. Initial aroma seemed almost spicy and peppery. The taste is on the hoppy side, in fact, its almost all I tasted. Some pretty decent lacing was evident during the session. Mouthfeel is a bit thin; no boldness there. The finish is dry with a hoppy aftertaste. For a session beer, its not bad, but a good Pale or IPA would be much better, IMHO."
"Pours a dark amber color with some orange and gold hues shining through. Thin head that is now gone. Little lacing and lot's of carbonation bubbles. Smell is fruity, cherry like, somewhat medicinal. Taste is of some piney hops with a very strong malt background. I think in this particular APA the malts dominate the hops. Leaves a medicine like cherry aftertaste. The mouthfeel is dominated by carbonation. Over all this is a decent brew. Not outstanding but a good beer to fall back on when some of your favorites aren't available."
"A brownish-tan color with very little nose. Was hoping for a lot more hops, but was met with a somewhat balanced hoppy/malty brew (stronger on the malt unfortunately - IMHO). There was zero head retention and its mouthfeel was a bit flat (I liked this since I am a big fan of cask drawn bitters - wonder if this would benefit such treatment ... wishful thinking for a macro), though I did have this served to me at a Sam Adams airport bar, so a quality pour was not expected. Though the beer wasn't my preferred style, I would recommend trying it out for yourself. It's an easy drinking beer that would go well with bar fare or a night out with the boys. I think I'll give it another chance to see if it's any different ... maybe from the bottle this time around."
"This is a pretty good offering from Sam Adams. The color is a light tea color. The beer had a nice one inch head that quickly dissolved into a thin layer. There is quite a bit of lacing on the glass. The smell is of spices and honey. The taste is similar to an old ale. The mouthfeel is good with no harsh tones and a nice lingering bitterness. The drinkability is near the top as far as Sam Adams brews go. I would drink this beer again. This would be an excellent session beer."
"This beer could use some more balance and personally, I'd appreciate more hop flavor and aroma. I'd turn to Smuttynose Shoal's Pale Ale for a similar but better beer. Despite being about an average APA, this made a good lunch-time beer with a sandwich."
"This beer pours a dark copper color with an almost white head that quickly disappears. The smell is dominated by carmel from the malt. The hop aroma is there, but extremely subdued. The taste is dominated by the malt - carmel comes through. The hop bitterness is there, but the flavors are overpowered by the malt. The mouthfeel is rich and heavier than what I'd expect from an APA. The beer is definitely drinkable, but it took me some time to get over my expectations for an APA. I don't think this beer fits the style very well and think it might be a stretch to even call it an English Pale Ale. That being said, it's a smooth, consistant brew, but certainly not what one might expect within the APA category."
"A medium-copper color with a bit of head that leaves behind just a touch of lacing. Aromas of malt, hops, and caramel seem to come out. The taste is much sweeter than might be expected for this style. The malt profile is more like a German lager with hints of spices and a subtle aftertaste that sits in the back of my throat. Drinking this beer makes me think it was prepared ever so carefully with just the right amount of this with that. Together, the components make a good session beer, but not one that works within the style."
"Cheers!"
"Not too much to pontificate about here but a smooth, tasty, crisp ale that really hits the spot when you don't crave a super over-the-top type brew."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Slick but rolling, effortless to put down. Balanced as anything I've drunk, this beer was definitely worth the wait to enjoy. The key strong points here are clean, fresh ingredients that come together and present a totally drinkable brew."
"Not sure why the (relatively) low reviews for this one. Kind of light colored for an amber ale, but still looks appetizing. There are fruity notes in both the scent and taste. Maybe banana? That's what it seems like to me. Pretty light drinking. I suppose this beer is geared to appeal toward the macro lager crowd without offending them. Its still a good Samuel Adams beer, though. I had a 20oz glass for $5.19, and I'm sure I could have had another. Goes down smooth and tasty. If you find regular Samuel Adams too 'powerful,' then this beer might be better suited for you."
"Overall, not really a beer I would look for to buy, possible if it is on sale."
"Drinkability - Great with a meal. Very drinkable."
"Overall a good beer. Certainly one that i can fall back on. a great session beer, though i wish it showed more hops."
"Not as big on the hops as some other APAs, but thats not necessarily a bad thing. It's well-balanced, very smooth and dangerously sessionable."
"It pours out a good copper/amber color with a sizeable head that maintains decent retention during the entire drinking of the beer. Huge malt profile in the aroma. The taste is all malt sweetness. A It does not feel too watery and there is a good level of carbonation. A decently drinkable beer."
"Pours a decent copper/amber pale ale color. Very little head retention, almost non-existent. The nose is very faint. I'm having trouble pulling much of anything from this one. Maybe a hint of citrus. The taste is okay. A little bland for an APA at first, the middle is choppy and robust, and it finishes with a tangy and citrusy flavor. The mouthfeel is thick and soft. Drinkability is good as well, I seem to be getting more and more interested in this beer after each sip."
"Overall a bit more of a bite to it than one of my favorites - the Boston Lager - Goes down smooth without the sweetness. Highly recommended."
"I liked at first but for some reason the dryness and overall paled sense kept me from enjoying it fully. Not really all that bad of a beer really it just wasn't doing it for me."
"This is an exceptional beer, another winner from BBC, I am definitely a big fan of this brewery, despite its detractors it continues to produce a very solid and consistent line of tasty brews that are available almost everywhere."
"Yeah. Pretty good."
"This brew pours a clear amber color with a large fluffy white head. The aroma is hoppy, but has some matl mixed in (the way a good APA should have). The taste is of citric hops witha nice malt backbone. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with ample carbonation. Overall, this is a wonderful session beer, and a very solid APA."
"A light coppery color with a nice two finger head.The color is a little too light for my taste,but thats me.A nice hop and yeast smell,but not too many spices which is a little surprising.This has an OK taste,but it leaves a watery aftertaste.This is a pretty good ale,but it's a little too weak to compare with others.Not Sam's best."
"this may be my replacement as a standby beer taking over the spot of Victory's Hopdevil."
"This is a darn solid beer--good in every category. It looks good, smells good, tastes good, and I wouldn't mind another..."
"Drinkable, but not my first choice. An OK ale, but nothing I would buy a six pack of."
"A tasty beer that's still good no matter how many amazing beers I drink. This is an old standby beer of mine, and trying it again now after not having it in a long time, I think it should be a regular standby again. One of the beers that got me into craft beer, and for that I'll never forget it."
"Nice copper color with an initially thick foamy white head that dissipates fairly quickly leaving some nice lacing. The nose is mostly citrusy hops with some floral hints as well. Taste is mostly citrusy hops again with enough malt to balance it out. It's really not all that hoppy but it's balanced and pretty good. Very nice medium to full mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Definitely drinkable- good ale."
"The caramel and fruit carry over onto the palate. Bitterness is at a decent level and there is a good level of residual sweetness. Hop flavors linger in the finish along with a nice toasted malt grain characteristic. It is an enjoyable beer all around."
"Drinkability: A very good easy drinking APA. I have long gone to Sam Adams Boston Lager as a good stand-by beer, available almost anywhere and good in a pinch. I have recently began re-examing the rest of their line, as I have not had many of their beers in some time. I have forgotton how good some of their beers are, and am enjoying having them again. It may be awhile til I get back to theLager. A solid APA, worth having."
"I prefer a few more hops and would have loved a little bit more of sting on the end but that is what IPA's are for."
"The smell is slightly fruity with a spicy mix. There is a touch of citrus in the smell too. The taste is mildly malty and nicely hopped. There is a good balance of hops in this one. Not much grapefruit flavor like an ipa, but a definite lean toward one. This is a very good ale."
"Cloudy dark copper color with a two finger head. Good retention and good lacing. Smell is mostly hops with toasted malt and faint apple cider. Taste is rich and well balanced between initial hop bitterness and sweet dark malts following after. Medium body with low carbonation, but very smooth. Flavorfull and very drinkable due to it's dry aftertaste and a clean finish. More like a Euro pale ale than an APA, even those who don't care for beers with a high IBU count can enjoy this beer."
"This Sam Adams Boston Ale has a full, round mouthfeel.It is a very good beer, well balanced and full of rich flavor. The drinkability rating was not higher for me only because of a sweetness that lingered in the back of my mouth that, IMHO, I did not care for. By far, one of my 2 favorites by Sam Adams so far. Give it a try."
"I had this at the Pizzeria Uno at the South Street Seaport in New York. I thought it was a decent amber ale though I was hoping for something with a little more malt and less hops. It arrived at the table with no head just a thin collar of lace. It left no further lacing but I attribute that to the glass. The aroma was floral with very faint biscuit notes, The taste was largely the same. Mouth feel was somewhat thin. It was drinkable overall, especially considering the only alternatives were macros but nothing to go out of your way to try."
"Overall: I was not overly impressed with this offering and would not purchase it again considering all of the alternatives in this category that one has to choose from."
"The taste is very hoppy, with enough malty sweetness underneath to provide balance. The hop profile is both leafy and citric. Nice moderate with a clean bitter finish that does not linger. Great choice for a session brew."
"Drinkability: This is refreshing, sweet, tasty, balanced. Anything I could expect. Would probably like it more if it was just a little more hopped."
"Very smooth in both aroma and flavor. A nice beer from Samuel Adams."
"Draught at a Pizzeria Uno: I had hopes that it may be a good beer, but those hopes were dashed with the first sip. The color was a fairly clear amber hue. There ws some head. The aroma was ok, just a bit thin. Some malts and hops coming through. The flavor was passable, but not exciting at all. I switched to Sam Adams as it was the best thing available there. I was suprised to see that the beer had been brewed by Sam."
"Though I'm still not sure what a ""stock"" ale is, this is pretty good. As an APA, it's real good. Recommended."
"It impressed me as a more potent version of Sam Adam's Boston Lager. Very similar characteristics while being bolder in every category."
"Drinkability: This Ale would make a good selecton for a session beer that can be found very easily. Another good one from Samuel Adams."
"A very easy drinking ale and one I prefer to there Boston lager. An easy find throughout Boston and one I like to keep around."
"A pleasant amber ale. Served in a pint glass the head was absent (perhaps the fault of the server and not the beer). It was a nice golden color. The smell was sweet. The taste nicley balanced. This is a beer worthy of your time, when the other selections are ordinary."
"Drinkability: This makes for a great session ale!"
"SA's Boston Ale was my gateway to the world of good american ales, because I already liked the Sam Adams taste, but the hoppiness of this brew led me to try other better beers. If you can find it, give it a try. Great for getting your friends to try better beers."
"While Boston Lager may be Samuel Adams' best selling and best known brew, this one stands heads and tails above it in character."
"Had this at UNO's just a little bit ago. It had a very malty tasted to it, definitely had some floral hops in it as well. Had a white frothy head that lasted a minute, maybe two minutes tops. Its a decent beer, kinda disappointed as far as Sam Adams is concerned for brewing it. Recommended but not real highly as far as a Sam Adams prodigy goes."
"Mouthfeel is bubbly and delicious, smooth, light. Very very drinkable- the perfect beer to have lying around in your fridge always. Lip-smacking good."
"Pours a clear golden color with a foaming head which takes a little while to disapate. Basically no lacing at all. This ale has a very nice taste, light-medium body. One of the better Ale's from Sam Adam's. I like this ale quite a bit, it's very drinkable (watch out, LOL)."
"Pours a hazy amber with a finger of off-white head and moderate lacing. Floral hops dominate the nose with some caramel and biscuity malt as well. Honey and sweet bready malts first hit the tongue, with a piney hop flavor following up and leaving a pleasant lingering bitterness on the tongue. Mouthfeel is a little on the thin side and carbonation is med/high. This is a really nice APA from Sam Adam's, definitely their best ""Boston"" beer."
"Its a highly drinkable beer, smooth enough for a macro drinker yet flavorful enough for the BAs. This could easily make a session beer."
"Orange-golden tone with a thin off-white head that was dense and laced. Too much hop on the nose and not enough on the tongue. It tasted like it was watered down a bit or not developed enough before bottling. Typical feel and drinkability. Nothing remarkable here."
"This is great Ale. I like this beer because it is filling unlike some of Samuels other brews. I also enjoy the slightly bitter after taste from the hops. This is a very clean brew. What makes this a preferred beer of mine is its availability in grocery stores."
"Purchased as part of the 'Brewmaster collection', it's been a few years since I last saw the Stock Ale in these parts. It's always been my opinion that this early offering from the Boston Beer company is a bit on the uninteresting side."
"Pours a clear medium amber with a 2 finger head and good lace. Smells of nice caramel malt with a slight floral hoppiness. Not as hoppy as other APA's I have tried. Slightly fruity. A nice hop presence hits at first, not overpowering as you can definately taste the malt underneath it. Fruitier than I expected. Cleaner and crisper than I expected also - I mean this in a good way. Highly drinkable. A nice APA."
"Nice start, picturesque deep and clear amber with foamy tan head. Nose was more malty than hoppy, although it did have a touch of floral. Quaffable, well balanced brew  perhaps needing a touch more hop bite. Slightly over carbonated, nit-picking here. This would be a good any-season frosty to enjoy."
"Pours orangish gold in a glass with a one finger head that lasts a good while - over couple of minutes. Smell is of faint piney hops. Taste is really dry and faintly of piney hops. This is part of a variety six pack that was good before Sept. 2005. However, this taste seems much more subdued than what I would expect. Is this a move by Sam Adams to be more macro like or is this a spoiled batch? I was expecting more hops. Crisp and light mouthfeel. But not much substance to this."
"Overall-a nice balanced APA, more malty and bready than many I've tried which tend to be more hoppy but I enjoyed this one nonetheless. A nice balanced APA and definitely a good way to introduce non-craft drinkers. This beer has a cult following for a reason."
"Pours a nice crisp golden/orange with a head that struggles to stick around with a mixture of small bubbles and a few soapy looking bubbles as well. Nose has strong notes of caramel and an earthy aroma which i can't pin down. Taste is a bit of a dissappointment in the hop department. Sweet malts dominate this APA, in fact it tastes more like an extremely mild EPA. More piney hop notes come out as the brew warms but not nearly enough to redeem it. I've had much better Sam Adam's brews and I'm hoping this was just a fluke."
"This beer is really pretty average to me. I'll probably buy it again (although in the six-pack instead of the sampler), but I won't seek it out immediately. Not really to my taste, but I can see why it's such a fan favorite."
"Would pair well with salty bar snacks, or light chicken or beef dishes. Recommended."
"Mouthfeel is a bit light and harsh from the carbonation, but still a highly drinkable brew. Sam Adams not only has a good line of beers for people looking to get their feet wet with craft brew, but meanwhile they also make a damn solid product for the dedicated craft brew drinker as well."
"It seems hoppier than I remember, like an old friend who's changed a bit, but it's still reliable. Good, good, good."
"Pours with a light tan head, lots of staying power. The body is an orange-brown. On the nose, toasty malt, there's also a bready aroma with some subtle hops. I can't decide anything about the flavor. It hides under the strong carbonation. When it makes an appearance there is again toasty malt. The finish is a medium puckering feel, with some aftertaste.. at most I would only have one of these."
"A bit of a hop uptick at the end. This is refreshing, quite drinkable, but didn't feel in style."
"The color is a light red and the head was pretty good, a pale bit of fluff. The aroma is a touch hoppy, with a little bit of malt and a touch of fruitiness, but not very strong overall and a little disappointing for an ale. The flavor was good, a nice blend of malt and hops. This isn't a killer beer but its solid and tasty. Overall this isn't quite as creative as a lot of micro APAs but it has its place."
"Drinkability: Sam Adams sets the bar for ongoing quality and goodness. Another amazingly good beer that I would of course have another of. This was perfect for the first 70+ day of the summer, chillin out on the deck."
"golden lager-ish appearance, one finger head with farily minimal retention. Smell is leafy organic hops with tangy malt in the background. Mouthfell is light and fairly thin for an APA in my opinion. Taste is immediately hoppy but balances out in the middle with a fruity malt taste and finishes dry. An easy drinking American Pale Ale that would be excellent as a transition or gateway beer for new converts. A light and somewhat complex ale that grows on you as you go and would function well as a session beer or a fall back choice"
"I've recenty rediscovered Sam Adams. Since it's around so much and it regarded as one of the more commercial ""micro"" breweries I think I tend to overlook it. I've recently been reminded by this beer and their new black lager that they make some damn fine stuff. This one pours a drab iced-tea amber color with highlights of red and orange. A bit of white bubbly head. Smell is nice and malty, soft and sweet, with some dusty hops thrown in. To me, this tastes like maybe it has an English-style influence even though it's technically classified as an APA. Nice soft malts and mellow sweetness. A little biscuity buttery taste and some toffee, which is what reminds me of an English ale. This beer does have a typical APA style hop profile; a little bitter, piney, and nicely citrusy and fruity. I find that the hop characteristics mesh really well with the sweeter maltier side. A really well balanced beer actually, I'll have to remember that I like this stuff."
"Overall - Definitely one of the better Sammy Adams brews i've had. Might be my all time favorite from Jim."
"The taste is similar to a British bitter. Strong hop bite in the swallow (and aftertaste), but the initial sip is malty. Very smooth--richer than most bitters with a typical amount of carbonation. I think this beer would do very well in a blind flight."
"All and all a beer worth trying. Quite frankly I'd like to try cooking with this beer I think it would hold up well as a poultry maranade."
"Drinkability is like I said before not bad wouldn't be my regular choice but would be a nice backup. Sure goes down easy and grows on you as you drink it low ABV make a good sessions brew."
"A couple of days ago I reviewed Dominion Ale. The similarities are stunning. I wish I had tasted these blind. The Sam Adams has a fuller mouthfeel upfront, downright creamy. This is a carmel, dark orange ale with a 3/4 white head that left lace when it died down (about a minute). After the creaminess there is a smooth segue into the hop bite that lingers for good long while. This beer is highly drinkable. I believe that APAs will become my session beer of choice."
"Mild aroma of lightly sweet malt and a pinch of butterscotch. Short, dense, light cream colored head leaves some string of lace. Transparent deep copper colored beer with a few streams of medium sized bubbles running up the middle. Malty flavor is a mix of berries and butterscotch, and becomes slightly bitter towards the end. Body is solid, and the mouthfeel is watery soft. A tasty brew that's easy drinking."
"Strained my eyes to make out the little Uno Amber Lager logo on the menu, so I had to try it. Served in a 20 oz. glass, the beer had a nice thick head and a good copper color. The smell was somewhat lacking but the mouthfeel made up for it. The taste itself was maltly and bordered on a bitter ale side. I personally wouldn't add this to my must have list but I could make this a session beer if need be."
"Very drinkable, goes down smooth, not too strong, good flavor for just about anything but a hot summer day."
"Better on tap than on bottle, not spectacular either though."
"D- great hops that bring in a bold flavor but it has the malt to compliment them. It is a very nice beer and I was a bit surprised based on Samuel Adams track record. They make a solid lager and now I know they make a solid APA."
"12 oz brown bottle. Purchase by August 2005. Pour a dark orange/amber color with an ample head. Wonderful aroma of lightly toasted malts and mild hops. Toasted malt sweetness dominate this brew with a slight bitterness from the English hops. A well made American Ale."
"Well my mug is empty, so this review is now officially over. Thanks for listening."
"From the Brewmaster's 6-pack. 12 oz. with purchase by April '05 notched on the label. Pours into the imperial pint glass an orange/brown with a 2 finger head that leaves decent lacing. Smells buttery with caramel and a hop spiciness. Initially the malts are stronger, with butterscotch, caramel, bubblegum, and some fruit, but the hops become stronger toward the end with a nice bitterness and a citric/floral flavor. Hoppy enough to handle spicy foods and sweet enough to handle desserts."
"The taste is dominated by a full-bodied, dry, burned taste of malt; there is some bitterness and taste of rye bread. The aftertaste is a complex one with flavours of sweet corn, dark bread, apricots and some sweet notes."
"Drinkability: Not bad. A very accessible APA both in terms of taste and ubiquity. I'd go for SNPA over this any day, however."
"The mouthfeel is fine with carbonation that seems well suited to the beer. Drinkabity is also good, but this is not a session beer for me as it lacks a bit of complexity and the taste is a bit mild. Still, this is a fine ale and one along with its lager stable mate, is often the only decent beer many places offer."
"This beer is an orange/amber color it had a one finger head that lasted about two minutes and it had some moderate lacing. The aroma was faint but citrus/pine like. The taste was sweetly malty at first but finishes with plenty of hop bitterness. The beer was thin bodied but well balanced and very drinkable."
"This beer, depending on what mood I'm in, makes me wish I was drinking either Rouge Dead Guy or Sierra Nevada Pale. Right now I wish I had a pint of Dead Guy. Still, it's a tasty beer."
"Taste is earthy, herbal fruit, with dry biscuit malts. Nice, spicy hop flavors come in midway and lead to a bitter finish with lingering apple-y malt. Medium-bodied, smooth feel. A fine crafted ale, although not one of my favorites."
"Pours a deep golden hue with a quarter-inch white head that holds its place for a while. Aroma of fresh-baked bread, ale yeast, and a touch of malt. Slightly thick, sturdy body holds an up-front palate of toasty caramel malt, becoming more balanced towards the back of the mouth. Finishes with a nice dry hoppiness. Not bad."
"Drinkable beer thar would pair with most mild pub foods."
"My first sampling of the boston ale,,im a fan of the boston lager so i wanted to try this.A clean sweet tasting beer with some hops lingering in the background.2 finger head leaves lacing down the glass.All in all a good beer , in the future ill sample this and the lager side by side to determine which is my fave."
"Another ""alright"" Samuel Adams beer. Tastes a lot like their Pale Ale, a little maltier, but very similar. Boston Ale pours a medium amber shade with average head size and retention. Smell is malty, more so than expected from an APA, with some slight hops presence. Taste is maltier than I'd like, the sweetness seems a little artificial and forced. Still, this is fairly tasty and very easy to drink. Considering the score here, I was expecting a bit more."
"Final Thought: Another HQ beer from the pioneer microbrew of the USA, can't go wrong with a Samuel Adams!"
"This is simply a great session beer. Caramel and butterscotch sweetness upfront are followed by an estery and dry yeasty flavor. The thing that really stands out to me is the hop profile. It's very interesting and complex to me. Lots of spicy and bitter hops mixing back and forth. The finish is acidic and spicy. The body is a bit thin and the malts could mix better with the hops but all in all this is another solid beer from Sam Adams."
"Very pleasant and drinkable. Probably one of my favorites from Sam's since most of their other beers suck IMO. A bit off for the American Pale Ale style, but a nice tasting English Pale."
"Drinkability: Not a bad ale, but I guess I was looking for a stronger flavor."
"Copper in color with a decent head and some lacing. Aroma of floral hops and some maltiness. Nice malt flavor with some hops but not much yeast flavor similar to a lager. I was really surprised at the flavor of this beer, somewhere between a craft and a macro."
"-Oelergud"
"Can't remember when I have ever given all 3.5's to a beer! Guess that says it all  just above average. Not a bad beer, but I felt it could have benefited from some more complexity in the hops. Orange Topaz in color, some white foam with some sticky lacing. Softly hopped, some herb and fruit: even Allspice. A smooth, raw, mildly bitter ale with some malt that balances the middle. Medium to light body. Nice floral finish. Aged to add a robust smoothness. Would be great for picnics, and it is available nationally."
"Pours a nice clear golden orange with a bubbly one inch head...nice and inviting. Smell has some hops in it along with citrusy grainy tones. A nice pale ale flavor comes through with some subdued hops flavor and a nice malt. Slight bitterness on the back of the palate along with citrus notes. Overall, it's a nice APA that's not to hard on the wallet and easy to drink. One of the better Sam brews that I've tried."
"The beer pours an amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a dry, yet malty scent which boasts of pale and crystal malts. It has a slightly fruity yeast aroma. The taste is good as well. It has a nice malty flavor with a dry fruity finish. It goes down smooth and with good mouthfeel. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a fine amber ale. It has excellent aroma and flavor; a good drinker."
"This is a really good beer when it's fresh. When given the option, I prefer this over the Sam Adams Lager. This has a better overall profile and is a solid ale."
"Take everything that's good about the Boston Lager and improve it by just a little bit and you get this beer."
"The beer pours a nice golden amber color. The head is about a finger tall but falls fast to a thin cover over the beer with a nice ring around the top. The nose is sweet with a lot of caramel coming through. Not bad at all. There is a light caramel malt taste that finishes with a decent floral hop. The carbonation is just right for the taste and feel. Much more than I expected from a Sam Adams product. The beer is suprisingly moderately thick, more-so that I had expected. This is an easy drinking beer, easily something to sit down and have more than one of. This was a nice surprise for me, as I tend not to like the Sam products."
"While I never drink more than one to two beers a nite, I could have enjoyed a few more of these on the cool Cape Cod nights."
"The words that keep coming to mind as I drink are 'classic' and 'solid'. If I wanted to nitpick I'd say that I prefer my APAs more citrus hoppy than this, but I'm not in a nitpicking mood today. Besides, this is really more of a British-style pale ale and it hits that target directly. Boston Ale is excellent beer and I'll be sure to look for it from now on."
"Pours a nice amber clear liquid with a white foamy head. The head stayed only briefly. There was a slight amount of lace on the glass. Smells slightly toasty, along with slightly floral. Taste is a nice richly toasted malt, to go along with a floral, slightly herbal finish. The bitterness was not very high, and the finish was pretty dry. Slightly astringent. Medium body with a good amunt of carbonation, maybe a bit too much. Overall, this was a pretty drinkable beer to go with my pizza. I would have enjoyed more hops in this one."
"Cheers"
"Not bad. I typically do not seek out ales of this sort. I am a tremendous fan of porters and stouts. This however, is quite tasty. Poured a orange/golden colour with a slightly off-white foamy head about a half inch thick that lingered for a while. Smell was hoppy with a little bit of yeast in there as well. Not usually a big hop fan, either, but in this configuration, it was quite nice. Very easy to drink and almost thirst quenching. Seemed to have a very faintly cream-like mouth feel that I also enjoied. Again, I do not usually seek out this style of brew, but I was kind of impressed with this one and will likely buy it again. Definately worth a try if you've never had it."
"Overall a very good ale."
"Looks good, Smells malty, of bread, nuts. Starts with a little malty taste, then some nice hops, then more malt, a good balance of relatively strong flavors. Mouthfeel was a little strange for me, something about the aftertaste wasn't quite right. Good drinkability, good session brew. Overall, very solid, not a strong standout but one to always come back to."
"Pours medium to dark golden colored. Smells a little of malt and alcohol, but very lightly. This brew goes down quite smoothly, a very solid and thorough taste with a bit of alcohol. Was medium strong. The Boston Lager is a very good choice if you're just up for drinking some beer without any frills."
"Tasted: 07/03/04"
"This beer is a clear, reddish amber with lots of fine carbonation. Its head is medium-sized, cream-colored and coarse. It leaves thin, spotty lacing. The aroma is tangy caramel; some sour milk (ok); some toasty grains. The beer starts sourish and caramelly. A butter malt middle is quite darkly fruity. Buttery, bitter, nutty finish. Nutty burps. This is really good. Nutty and fruity."
"The hops may prove to present too much for some as it overpowers the smooth malt quality of the middle. As for me, I liked this."
"This brews average appearance, with a reddish-gold body and a misty white head, is its best feature. The subtle aroma of dried hopes wasnt too bad  but the watery brew went down hill from there. Stale, or over-dried hops dominated the flavor, all but silencing hints of caramel malts. Remarkably, low taste brew retained notes of the quintessential S.A. house flavor. While I could drink a fair amount of this brew, I dont see why Id try."
"Much smoother than a typical Sam Adams. Fruit flavors are apparent as well which is an oddity for Sam. Good malt flavors are first sampled to be replaced by the fruit flavors imparted by the hops which make their appearance at the finish with a faint bi"
"The thin head receded very quickly from atop this clear, tawny ale. The smell is mostly buttery malts, no distinguishable hops or spiciness. The mouthfeel is silky and worthy. The taste, however: bland. Some light nutty flavor, a touch of citrus, and at least I get the hops here, but really there is no movement from start to finish--flat line. Perhaps I've become a more discriminating beer drinker or maybe Sam Adams has dumbed down (or both), because I'm sure ten or fifteen years ago, I would have given this rave reviews. And the price is not right!"
"I'm not a fan of the lager, but I needed to try the ale to give it a fair shake. Copper colored with a thick white head that rises up a full inch and a half high, and then settles quickly, leaving a thin layer. Aroma is light, but mostly of malt and some toffee. Flavor is very thin and not complex at all. It's all malt, no hops, and seems to have that Bud burnt rubber lingering aftertaste. Mouthfeel is big, fat, and creamy, but it's all that this beer has going for it (IMO)."
"Overall, a good session type beer. I always enjoy this one."
"This brew from Sam Adams is a very good beer, probably their best (in my book, so read into it as you will) year around offering. I really like this brew. It pours to a nice deep coppery color with a nice thick off white head that breaks down slowly to excellent lacing through out the entire brew. The aroma is sweet from a good amount of malt with nice spicy and toasted highlights. The taste is very pleasing with malts dominating and a slight hop hit that balances it out nicely along with those toasted highlights from the aroma. This is a brew that I can enjoy year around and one that has quite a bit of character!"
"Poured out a copper color with the right amount of carbonation I thought. Dark for a pale ale. Sweet malts hit the nose with a little bit of toasted aroma as well. So far so good with this beer. Taste is what makes this beer come alive. Malts come upfront with a hint of sweetness, then mixes with some hops in the middle, then blends in with some toasted flavors all the way through the end. For once this is balanced somewhat. This is what Bass wants to be but never will. Nice flavors with this beer, and one of the better beers from Sam Adams."
"This review was written on the ""Brewmaster's Collection"" edition... not the standard Stock Ale. I am not sure what the differences are, if any."
"Nice beer. I never sampled the original recipe, only the new ""brewmaster series"" stlye, so I do not know of the difference (if there is any). Nice beer, looking forward to having more"
"Anyway, a quality brew from Sam Adams that isn't ""dumbed down"" as some of their other offerings are accused of being."
"A clear deep golden color with a thin white head, Sam Adams Boston Ale has an slightly hoppy, slightly malty, fruity aroma. The taste has a firm malt backbone, with some floral/fruity sweetness up front and a dry finish with just a small amount of hop bitterness. A very smooth ale that has some lager-like characteristics, possibly due to the cold aging this beer had (according to the label). A quality session brew."
"On tap at Piccadilly Pub in Auburn....Light amber appearance with a nice half-inch head with very nice lacing. Smell was barely noticeable with a hint of a malt presence. Taste was very nice with an intial malty sweetness and a light hop taste on the finish. Mouthfeel was light and creamy. Very easy to drink with a nice smooth character."
"Today, I picked up the brewmaster collection today and sampled the Boston Ale first. The appearance is a copper colour, with some serious foam. However, the foam settles down after about two minutes. The smell is malty; not too strong but not weak either. The taste is also malty, with a hop to it. Not much of an aftertaste, though you feel the flavor at the mid-point of your tongue. As for drinkability, it is easy to enjoy more than one bottle. I must say that the Boston Ale goes very well with a barbeque chicken pizza. A good one from Jim Koch."
"Overall: Definately along the lines of an English style pale ale. I personally would choose their lager every time over the stock ale but it is still a decent beer."
"Overall Impression: A different and enjoyable ale. It may benefit from a little aging, which is an odd thing to say about an ale, but the tastes are just a bit disjointed. No problem with drinkability, this could make a pretty good session."
"I was definitely surprised by this ale. I had little expectations for it and ended up being very pleased with my selection. I recommend you try this ale if you go to Pizzeria Uno's. With about 15 beers on tap, the only ones that would have been a better choice, in my opinion, would be Guinness and Newcastle."
"A nice alternative to the Boston Lager. Would like to see this in more places."
"This is a world-class brew in my book, comparable to Rogue Dead-Guy Ale in many ways. I would certainly pick this over the Boston Lager, and it is my favorite Sam Adams. Rich, easy to drink, great mouthfeel....a feel good beer all over. Highly recommended."
"Super drinkable brew, hard to find on the West Coast now."
"Samuel Adams Boston Ale is one of the better Sam Adams brews and an above-average ale. Forms a nice pair with their Winter Lager."
"Hmmm...certainly drinkable. I would always prefer the boston lager though."
"When my wife and I visit my parents, my dad always tries to make sure he gets some good beer for me (it sure beats Bud). This visit saw some SA Boston Ale in the fridge, one of the few SA beers I've not tried. Poured a clear and bright amber in color, with a long-lasting thin layer of white head that does a good job of hanging around and lacing the glass. Aromas of malt step up first, but there is an earthy/grassy hop note as well. Flavor is quite tasty, and very well-balanced between the sweet malts and the bittering hops. Finishes quite clean, with not much of an aftertaste. Good creamy mouthfeel. A great session beer. My favorite SA beer to date."
"Nice creamy white head on top of (no surprise) amber brew. Not much aroma to speak of, good or bad. Taste is good for the style, but a little lacking in substance for me, both the hops and malt. A bit of an aftertaste, but a very drinkable offering, nice that they go through the trouble of having Sam make a beer for them."
"One thing I love about all the Sam Adams I've ever poured--no matter how bad my pour, it creates a beautiful, lasting head. That said, this beer is very pretty in itself: orangy-gold with a white foam head. At first it seemed a little overcarbonated, but that wore off as it mellowed in my mug. All these wonderful ales I'm drinking these days are turning me to the dark side (aka, those who like hops) and this beer has a nice amount of the stuff for a ""beginning hop-head"". It's tasting better and better, too, as it gets warmer. Hats off to another nice BBC brew."
"Poured a beautifully clear and bright orange amber. The head was large and lively. A wall of lacy white foam dressed the side of the glass. The aroma yields sweet caramel and citrus malts (lemon) and some other fruity notes, including ripe apples. The taste is buttery smooth and mellow, almost creamy. Theres a bitterness here but its barely detectable. Nice body of creamy butter malts and slightly caramelized grains. Creamy and delicious. Very nice."
" Its appearance was a clean looking red amber with some carbonation while only a thin off-white film lay atop the beer. While no head made it to the table, it did lace alittle in spots. The aroma was sweet grain with hints of both caramel and hop. The taste starts out abit sweet, malty caramel and grain. Not over-done for its followed by a crisp clean hop that lingers and leaves the mouth with a slight bitter feel. A decent beer to be had with the Uno menu. I set out to try this beer/place. Overall everything was good and id support this beer as long as they take the time to offer it."
"Light orange hue, decent head, sheets of lacing noticeable throughout. A slightly hoppy aroma, biscuit notes as well. The body of this beer is nearly a half-n-half combo of malts and hops; plain and simple. Sweet malts dominate early on, a decent and more powering blast of hops is noticed as this beer warms. Maintains some nice toasty qualities, somewhat astringent, barely carbonated. This bad boy has session beer written all over it! Good stuff."
"Taste is very bitter up front, followed by a fruity pale maltiness, and then followed by the bitter hops finish. A nice balance. Creamy, creamy, creamy. Very smooth but alot of flavor. Medium bodied with a nice hoppy aftertaste. Very smooth and very drinkable. Why don't I get this more often? Oh yeah, lots of good pale ales made by local brewers I try to support. Very good though."
"A great beer offering from Boston Beer. A nice pale ale (though reading about the stock ale was interesting as well) that seems just right to be refreshing. One of the top of the line from Boston Beer, and one that I'll look for again."
"I know it's sad, but this is the first time I have ever had this one. If it wasn't for the Brewmaster's Collection, I don't know if I ever would have had it either. Oh well, thanks be to the brewmaster in the sky that I did get it. I was pleasantly suprised by this one. It was a nice creamy brew, with an almost perfect balance of malt and hops. This is by far the best Stock Ale that I have ever had. I guess it's the perfect balance of everything that makes it that way. I sure hope I can find this in 6 packs!"
"This is a beer that has similar look to the Boston Lager, but a much better taste. It pours a dark amber with an off-white head that seems to hang around long enough to get a little lacing down the first third of the glass (Depending upon how fast you drink it, of course). There is more ester present in the aroma than the lager due to an ale yeast being used, and there are less citrus overtones. I love the mild floral note from the goldings. The taste is crisp with a caramel sweetness from the crystal malt. The hops provide slight bittering and a slight hoppy flavor. This beer has good body from the crystal, and a decent amount of carbonation."
"clear color of slightly worn copper. decent white head that disappears rather quickly. mild toasted grain, soft floral hops and a yeasty fruitiness on the nose. medium carbonation, smooth easy drinking texture. the malt side is balanced rather well against a soft floral and subtle citric hop profile. quite a fruity and refreshing ale, i'll take this any day over the boston lager. quite a good session beer that is usually easy to find."
"Pours a dark reddish brown with a nice tight white head. Smells of fruity esters, malts, and slight hops. Tastes nice, well balanced, apple, pear, mild lemony hops. Could be a little less carbonated, but as the beer warmed it seemed to settle down some. A nice offering and would be a good session beer."
"Glad I revisited this one. A solid Pale Ale. Would make a nice session brew."
"A very impressive session ale, I wish it was as widely available on-tap as their Lager. Straightforward but not boring, this beer is much better than I expected."
"Light amber color, little white head, lots of visible carbonation. Smells faintly of citrus and hops. Has a very malty start, that finishes off by a nice hops bitterness. A big mouthfeel from the carbonation and hops. One of the better Sam's I have had."
" And please note if you are so inclined, that this place is located on the corner of College and 2nd, not Tryon and 2nd as it's listed. I found out the hard way."
"Drinkability: This is a beer that is very easy to enjoy. It has stood the test of time very well with me, I could drink these all night long and not get bored with them. It's a lot easier to find than some of the higher rated beers, but IMHO, stands up well to most of them."
"Poured copper red in a 22 oz. UNO Pilsner glass with very little head. Lacing was evident, but just barely. The smell was surprisingly slightly hoppy. The first sip was pretty unimpressive, but subsequent sips revealed a slight hop flavor as well as a slight sour/metallic taste that stays with one as a bitter aftertaste. Still, it was a pretty good brew. Light-bodied but with too much carbonation, perhaps to mask flavor. I would say this is a good session beer, but I'd rather not spend any more time at UNO's than I have to, particularly if I've been dragged there."
"Very clear light amber, very impressive off-white head - sticky and retentive. Smells of diacetyl and toasted malts, some spicy and earthy hops. Big caramel flavor with buttery backing. Very dry, and seems a hint smoky to me. The dryness makes the hop flavor seem a bit metallic. Feel is rather slick on the tongue. Very drinkable. I like this beer more out of the bottle than on draft, where the butteriness can seem overwhelming. A nice brew for sure, but not that memorable for me. I will drink it occasionally."
"John"
"Very nice."
"Mouthfeel: Above average mouthfeel. Medium carbonation overall though you get a quick shot of high carbonation in the beginning of your sip. Pretty smooth overall."
"Overall: For this type of beer I will have a hard time buying it over, say SNPA, but it's a good brew worth drinking"
"Stunning clear amber appearance with a medium head that is slightly off-white in color. Quite a bit of lacing. Subdued floral hop aroma is inviting to the nose. Mouthful is nice, even pleasant, with plenty of carbonation that is well balanced with hops and malt. Taste is well balanced and easy to enjoy. Crisp finish is dry enough to make this ale a very nice experience. Very good drinkability overall. This is a tasty ale that I prefer over most of the west coast's pale ales. The best Sam Adams brew I've had so far."
"Heard much about this one, couldn't find it anywhere though.. until I ""accidently"" found it at my local grocery. Quite strange. Poured a crystal clear copper hue. Good chunky offwhite head, that dissipated after a couple of minutes. Delicate grainy nose with caramel undertones and minimal hop presence. Mouthfeel is creamy and pleasant. There is a distinct caramel flavor from the outset, with a delicate hop balance. Seemed more mild that your average Pale Ale.. very smooth, very drinkable."
"Sampled 10/18/03"
"Overall a Very good beer, a great session beer. The low alcohol content makes it verrry drinkable. Mmmmm"
"This is a beer you can build a session around. One of my favorite ales, it may not be as strong in some areas as others, but it's balanced, and readily available in the bottle. To find it on draft is even better, I wish the BBC would push this one more"
"Pours a hazed golden amber with very minimal head. Aroma is sweet with some hints of grain. Taste is dominated by an unspecific sweetness which is followed by a very light hop finish. There is a little bit of a crispness to the mouthfeel which makes the hops seem more apparent than I believe they are. Overall this is not a bad pale ale, certainly distinct and one I could pick out easily in a blind tasting. Not as drinkable as the lager, but easily a session beer."
"Deep bright red in color with a sticky white head. Not much in way of aroma, raw hops and some peppery spice. Taste is full of raw leafy hops. Some malts balance the hops and there is a more spicy notes as well, I really like these raw unrefined flavors. Unique and very tasty. Wish that this one was as available as the Boston Lager."
"I can somewhat imagine this being the type of beer that was drunk by the founding fathers of this country. For some reason, it has a down-home, patriotic feel to it. A well-balanced beer that is very drinkable."
"Mr. Koch, you should promote/advertise this brand...it's a winner ."
"just a solid, solid overall beer. although they have distinctly different tastes, SA boston ale is in my opinion our east coast version of SNPA. simple, too the point brews that are damn good. this one just oozes new england to me. pours a nice orange colour with a decent head that comes down to a sticky lasting lace. the hop/malt balance here is superb, combined with a bit of a citrus flavour, it really can't be beat. the really is an american pale ale at it's best. sadly (to an extent, as i also love SNPA) you can find it's west coast partner in crime in far more pubs. maybe it because the BBC pushes the SA lager as it's main brew, along with SA light. they should really push this one some more as well, as it really is a gem. definitely a well made, standard type brew that is a nice fridge filler that can appeal to the masses."
"Not a half bad ale, really. Lacks the kick of many of the more expensive ales out there, but it's completely drinkable. Not too fancy, but sometimes you just want a solid, basic, no frills cup of ale."
"Light Amber color, large white head. Aroma is malty and sweet. Mild ale, medium malts, slightly roasted, hoppy. A mild tasting ale, smooth. Bottle aged. A lighter taste, but full flavor. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is crisp. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"I think this is a good beer and its availability makes it even better."
"Overall: Well, I have to admit that I was quietly impressed with this offering from Samuel Adams, to the extent that I had a couple of these. Very nice."
"Clear copper bronze appearance, good pale head of rocky foam and 1/2 inches of height to start. Decently intricate lace. Floral aroma, some sense of peach fruitiness and vanilla. Malt leans toward a heath bar toffee, creamy carbonation carries the first impression well and leads the beer into a nice hop balance -- sweetened orange, perfumey, and not shocking. Agreable finish and aftertaste. Not a challenging beer but it may be one of Sammy's best session Ales. As a product, it may have lost out on the early promotion front to the Lager because of an early public's wariness of ""Ale"" as a word."
"Awesome looking beer copper amber with a huge peach colored head just like a whipped cream sitting on top, heavy patches of lacing great appearance. Aromatics have some fruit tones and a strong backbone of malted barley rich tones fulfilling to the senses but not overpowering. Flavor perfect balance of bready yeast tones, sweet malt and fruity tones a bit of a citrus bite not bad at all very drinkable. Mouthfeel is fluffy textured medium in body and perfect carbonation fine crafted ale, and could very well be a fall back beer in my opinion with all of the bashing of Sam lately it's kinda funny I have found two great beers of theirs."
"Overall, this is just an amazing and so often overlooked beer. It's so good I'm amazed Sam Adams hasn't discontinued it. Not your complex belgian trapist or anything like that, just a great drinkable all around fridge beer."
"Notes: Hop profile is blissfully distinct from that of your typical west coast style APA; to my dismay, however, malt backbone has a touch of scoliosis. Would have preferred a slightly firmer malt presence."
"Flavor is definitely hoppy, with bitterness all the way through. Malts are light, and provide a light estery floral and fruity flavor, particularly towards the end. Body is light to medium, carbonation is perhaps a bit high for my tastes. I think the beer would be a bit better without the overwhelming effervescence. I was really surprised at how good this beer is. Probably one of the best beers I've had in a while. Very robust, complex flavor."
"I first sampled this when I toured the brewery last spring, and upon the recommendation of the tour guide, I purchased a case to enjoy at home. The beer pours a nice reddish brown, not overwhelmingly dark. The nose is that of malt, nuts, and some faint burnt aromas. The taste is that of the smell, yet balanced out with a nice blend of hops. The taste is reminsicent of the lager, and I feel as if the blend of hops is similar, only this is brewed as an ale. The taste is really quite good, and like my tour guide I prefer this to some other offerings from Boston Beer. Very drinkable, and I had no problems with getting an entire case."
"Clear, chestnut brown/amber hue, a nice color, the light beige head reached a smidge over a finger in height, fair head retention, it does fade to a soapy cap. As I removed the liquid some lace was produced albeit in an unorganized manner. The bouquet is pleasant with biscuit toastiness, vague earthy sweetness, notes of butter, and clean hoppiness. It is a very inviting and contrasting nose. The palate is exceedingly friendly with a perfectly balance of toasty biscuit malt, crackers, a distant note of fruit, earth, mineral water, tangy hops with perfect bitterness (modest in attitude). The finish is long and dry, kind of husky but savory. The mouthfeel is largely uneventful, the carbonation is firm and the body is smooth and a little thin. It is plenty easy to drink and damn enjoyable too! This is a terrific session beer and a great companion to steak or burgers. This is another winner from Sam Adams. It is well worth trying. Better than the Boston Lager? That is for you to decide. I do wish this were more available in Omaha."
"dark amber color with a really creamy nice looking head. not a verys trong smell to this, with only a little hops and nuttiness. somethin almost smokey, but not quite. good hops flavor with plenty of malt to go around as well, has a nice balance. the nuttiness comes through here a little also. good medium/full mouthfeel suits this beer well. one of the only sam adams beers i will buy consistently."
"A little plain for my tastes. American Bass or some other very basic ale, really. Herbal and nutty aromas and flavors are expected and are had. A little wet and sticky in the mouth but drinkable nonetheless. It's easy and non-offensive, but it's not remarkable either."
"Amber colored, very transparent, it pours with a thick, foamy head. As the bubbles of the head very slowly diminish, some are left behind lacing the glass. The aroma is very mild, and the taste somewhat plain--a bit of hops and some sweetness comes through. In both taste and smell I found this beer to be very average. It feels smooth in the mouth and is light to medium in body. Not a beer I usually seek out, although it does frequently make appearances at various parties etc. and I find it fairly easy to drink several of these despite the fact that I'm not really impressed by it."
"This one is clear and light amber with small head and a surprising heavy lacing straight down the glass. Smell is on the sweet side and taste is a little thin with little bitterness. I guess this is Sam Adams Boston Ale in disguise because that's exactly what it tastes like. You could do alot worse but went well with the pizza."
"It's pale copper with a one inch chunky fluffy head. Sweet malts and caramel are all I got out of the nose, very enticing. Malty flavor is enjoyed first, then the finish is spicy hops with a lingering aftertaste of mellow bitterness. The mouthfeel is rather thin but the flavors compensate for that. I love the balance and hoppiness."
"This beer pours a slightly lighter umber color than I had expected. The head is thick and antique white in color; the life is well lived settling to leave a lot of lace on the class. The Flavor is a nice dry malt flavor that has a healthy portion of hopping. There are sweet and lively undertones that are kept in check by the hop bitter that follows afterward. The mouthfeel is soft and pillowy. Overall a very enjoyable beer"
"Just about as average as you can get. This is the only house beer currently available in the downtown Dayton Uno's. Amber indeed it has a little beige head and some light lacing. Not much nose, but that might be the serving temperature. Mostly malt, for what it's worth. Somewhat balanced flavor with a malt skew. OK for a pizza beer I guess, but Oggi's does real beer and real pizza; why can't others?"
"On draught at the Uno near Tuttle Mall in Dublin, OH. Came in an unfrosted glass which was a nice surprise. Pours a deep amber color with a medium thick light beige head. Aroma is lightly sweet caramel malt. On the lighter side body-wise with a malty and earthy flavor. Finish is lightly hopped and just a tiny bit metallic. A lot better than I was expecting but not something I wish I could take home or anything."
"Bottom line - this is such a dangerously smooth beer, I could drink it all night, perhaps more so than the Lager. A no-brainer for a session beer, I would drink all you brought me, or fall off my chair trying."
"Pours a nice amber with some white head. Maybe the best macro brew out there. Good malt flavor with a nice soft hop balance. Slighty fruity/sweet on the malt side and slightly spicy/bitter on the hop side, but the balance is perfection. Goes down smooth. A great beer."
"I had no idea that Boston Beer Company was behind this one,have had 3 or 4 times at the Uno here in Greensboro.Poured into frozen mug wich I didnt care for much,not much head but a little lace,smelles sweet and a little grainy.Taste is malty and a little fruity but nothing spectacular.It is better than almost everything on tap there (except Sammy's)so its not to bad I guess."
"This is a good tasting beer. Nice fluffy white head, its a deep orange color. Its got a bit of a malty taste, i think its safe to say that this beer could be a good benchmark to compare other pale ales by. Nothing to crazy going on, but definately a nice beer."
"On the palate, though, this beer plays it cool, with meager hops and moderate malt. A little oily tasting, too, and an indistinct finish. The brew came and left without a trace. Very mild, and easily drunk, but with precious little to hold my interest. The label calls it a ""stock ale", but they seem to have hit the ESB style right on."
"A nice offering from BBC. I don't think that I have had this beer before, but I would not hesitate to pick it up again. Very nicely balanced, in my opinion."
"This is my favorite SA brew by far. Pours an orangey-red amber with a thick, sticky, creamy head. Hoppy, herbal aroma was prevalent. Medium bodied. Slightly smooth to start out, with some nice fruit esters, and some herbal, hoppy taste that makes it a little bitter. This is a beer I'll always come back to. It is basically a great all-purpose beer. Definitely even better on tap."
"Sam Adams Boston Ale/Stock Ale is my favorite ""everyday"" ale. When researching and rating a vast array of ales and lagers, from delicate pilsners to over-whelming imperial stouts and barleywines, it's good to find an ale with which to refresh the palette or to simply enjoy without research in mind (yes, at times we need a break from the daily grind). This ale has a deep copper color with reddish hues, nice malty body and is amply hopped. The separation between the distinct malt and hops flavors, smooth out and become more balanced after a few gulps. The fresh finishing hop aroma lingers. There's a clean fruity finish and nice long lasting head. Now Ive gone and made myself thirsty for one!"
"On tap the the Pic in Tewksbury. Pours clear amber, with a decent sized white head, long lasting, but no lacing. Aroma is malty and sweet, mostly hinting of caramel. Flavor is intenselt caramel, maybe overly sweet. No hops to speak of. Pretty thin mouthfeel also."
"Aroma is fairly rich, with a biscuity and nutty malt character. The beer itself is an orangeish shade of amber, with a very thin head and a slight haze. Toasted malt dominates the flavor also, with more nutty and biscuity notes. The hops are fairly mild but lend a bit of citric and earthy flavor to the finish. Medium bodied, with a lightly dry finish. A very drinkable beer, to say the least!"
"One of the few beers that has any kind of real beer flavour at most Pizzeria Uno establishments. Very easy to drink … a no brainer beer."
"Presented in a 20oz glass.Left a ring of lace with every sip.Straw yellow to light gold in color.Very bitter with decent amounts of hops.Nice crisp mouthfeel with medium malt thickness.Notes of honey,lemon,and wheat are tasted.Overall very good and well balanced.I drank two 20oz glasses with no problem.Leaves a long bitter after taste in the back of the throat.Everytime I go to Uno's I get this over any other beer they have on tap.I think it is outstanding.It goes great with everything they serve.Very refreshing,well-balanced,and malty.Has a crisp and clean taste.Boston Beer Co. should bottle this!Why doesnt the rest of their Sam Adams line taste this good?"
"Pours a slightly reddish medium amber color with a thick white head that fades into a sticky lace. Nose is light floral hops and is a bit herbal. Taste of lightly roasted sweet malts comes through up front followed by a strong herbal and spicy hop bite. Yet, despite the raw hop leaf flavor, the beer only has a mild level of bitterness. Finish is crisp with a touch of citrus. Very nice! This is one of my favorite offerings from Sam Adams."
"I went to a friend's wedding last summer and they had this on tap. I drank it all night. Then recently I tried SA's Boston Lager which I believe has gone downhill as of late, around the time they switched the labels and started promoting SA Light. Well I was a bit worried for Sam Adams but someone got this for me at the grocery store and this beer is still doing just fine, as good as I remember it from last summer. A basic pale ale with quite characterful malts, severely sweet at the beginning, but then a restrained amount of hops kicks in, mellowing and unifying the beer. Great big head, perfectly tempting aroma, somewhat thin mouthfeel. Fresh and on the warmer side, very yummy; a fine beer that anyone could like. I would like to see more brewers age their pale ales to get a mellower effect like they claim to do here. Koch and co. should be promoting this instead of the Light or Boston Lager."
"Nice amber color with a foamy white head. Smells of malt and hops are very clear together with a citrustone. Mediumbitter with a hoppy slightly roasted taste. Long aftertaste with a bitterness on the palate. A decent ale I quite like. Very drinkable."
"A bright white head on top of amber brown color with light orange hue. Similiar taste to the boston lager but has a stock maltiness that is sour. I kept tasting this strong sour cream and onion aftertaste with every sip. Maybe this one was a little skunk because I have had this before and I dont remember it tasting like this."
"What a great overall beer, inviting amber gold with a Hollywood head, light and foamy, and a down to earth taste, bitter and dry. Born in Quincy, raised in Boston, what more can I say? Hail to Boston! Hail To Ale! Hail to Sammy's Boston ale! Love that dirty water, but adore your local beer."
"Pours a reddish brown with a white head. A little bit of maltiness & hopiness to the aroma. A medium bodied ale with enough hops to keep things in line, the second Sam Adams product I ever tried; and it's certainly on old friend."
"Amber (fairly light) in color with a white frothy head. Malty nose. Sweet malty taste, light hoppiness. Medium bodied but slightly watery. Leaves a sweet aftertaste."
"One of the better Session beers to be found anywhere along with the Boston Lager, and a beer I look for if there is nothing else on tap worth sampling. The beer pours a deep copper color, the head masterful and the lace nice sheets to cover the glass. Big malt nose, fresh and clean and lightly sweet, front malt sweet and the top middling in mouth feel. Finish is perky in its acidity, the hops quite pronounced in their bite and the dry lingering aftertaste adds much to the enjoyment, one damn fine Session beer and always a treat to the palate."
"Light amber with an almost orange hue, and a thick pillowy cream-colored head. Aromas of apple fruitiness and biscuity malts, with a hint of diacetyl. Light carbonation; somewhat watery mouthfeel. Grassy and earthy hop flavors are predominant, with a little toasty malt for balance. I seem to remember this being better than I thought it was tonight, but it's still a dependable pale ale."
"you can jump right in to the welcoming smoothness and fine maltiness of this beer. i found it to be nice and rich. it is a great drinker, not heavy or light. i just plain like it. sam has always been able to put together a good beer, and this one did not fail."
"Beautiful looking ale, reddish amber with a huge rocky head with excellent retention. I don't pick up much in the aroma but an earthy/malty aroma. Mouthfeel is quite slick, and leaves a strange astringent flavor on the tip of the tongue. Lots of malty flavor and a subtle fruitiness in the background. Has a very buttery flavor to it as well. I prefer my ales a bit more hopped, although this is pretty good. The tip of my tongue feels quite strange though...tingly almost. Interesting feature."
"I can't believe I have neglected to review this one. This is one of Sammy's best beers. Boston Ale is tastier than the lager and has a very nice hop to malt balance. To be honest, this beer should be on tap over the Lager in a bar. Pours out to a nice amber/brown with a malty aroma. A session beer if there ever was one."
"This brew pours a clear brilliant copper color with a modest off-white head with staying power. The smell reveals a light twang with a biscuity background. The taste of roasted malt and earthy grain with some nice medium hopped bitter make for a mild balance. This light bodied brew finishes a semi dry bitter and drinks down pretty easy.Plenty likeable. Cheers!"
"Boston ale is an excellent part of the sam adams line. it has a good taste, it isnt bitter, smeels and appears nice also. not overwhelming flavor but not watered down. tastes the way an ale should, has to be one of my all time favortie from sam adams."
"The Boston Ale poured a very beautiful copper color, with nice head retention throughout. Intriguing lace left over on the glass too. Slight hop aroma, but nothing that jumped out at me (or up my nose). This ale had a mild, pleasant, hoppy taste, with prickly carbonation felt on the tongue. Definitely a drinkable and enjoyable brew, and a decent representative of its style."
"A very nice, humble ale."
"This was an above average beer in my opinion.  I am not a big fan of Boston Lager, but I am a fan of this Boston Beer Co. offering, Boston Ale(Stock Ale)  This beer poured a wonderful copper colour with some orange highlights.  The head on this beer was quite large, and remained so for a while.  The overall head retention and appearance of this beer was magnificent.  This beer had a great aroma, a nice silky mouthfeel and a great flavour.  This has to be one of Sam Adams' most drinkable beers, everything is done right here.  This beer is not exceptional but it is everything that an ale should be."
"Beautiful clear copper color with carbonation evident.  A sticky, medium sized pillowy white head sits on top.  It has nice retention and laces nicely as well.  There's really a nice hop nose on this beer.  An herbal, yet also perfumey blend which melds nicely with the malts on the nose.  I really like the taste of this one.  Smooth and mellow caramel malt profile really provides a nice backbone.  The hops are equally important.  They add some herbal spiciness.  A nice blend.  Body is about medium-full.  Very drinkable beer.  Reminds me of an alt in some ways."
"Not a bad looking brew, amber in color with a pizza dough, sweet wortish aroma. The head on this was impressive. The flavor fell flat though IMHO. I had this pegged as a ""specialty"" AB product similar to Aruba Red, as it turns out, it's being brewed by BBC, so I wasn't too far off. Strictly an inocuous amber ale. A notch above the rest of the macros at Pizzeria Uno."
"A red-amber appearance colors the glass as this one is poured. Nice head, although it diminishes a bit too much as you drink. A definitely nice hop aroma. A sweet malty and slight hop flavor. Smooth and calm across the palate, but noticeably present."
"Brewed by Boston Beer Co., Cincinnati, OH"
"Good stuff.  The hops are a lot more raw than in the Boston Lager.  The extra dose of hops are balanced nicely with a carmel-type sweetness.  The sweets and bitter are kept in very good proportion.  It's an ale, a very good ale, through and through.  I like the lager a bit better, but this is a very good brew.  Like almost all BBC products, it's top rate and I will continue to drink it, regardless of what is said of their management."
"Pours a bright copper color with a decent light tan/off-white head that leaves a nice lace down the glass.  A great fruity maltiness is present in this brews nose as well as some light earthy hoppiness.  Great fruity and toasty maltiness form th character of this brew with some very nice, slightly bitter noble hops at the end.  Very smooth and fairly creamy for the style, this is one of my favorite brews from th BBC.  Hopefully they can stop embarassing themselves and concentrate on making more good beers in the future."
"Ed's Note: On tap at the ""Cheers Bar"" last Christmas '01 Boston Trip."
"Clear, amber-copper in color with a dense, rocky off-white head that holds up very well and leaves some nice lace. Exceptional!  The aroma is lightly malty, slightly fruity, and offers a nice, but light, earthy hop note. Fullish mouthfeel with a medium body and moderate carbonation. Gently zesty and creamy. The flavor starts with a firm malt and bitterness, allowing some hop flavors to come into play towards the swallow. Well balanced. The finish is short lived with a moderate bitterness and mineral-like hop flavor resting in residual malt sugars. Not as hoppy as it once was, but a very lively, dry ale with a distinct character and excellent drinkablility."
"Nice amber color  with a thick creamy head which leaves  lace trails and rings on the glass. Flavor is rich with some spice and a unique hop flavor.  A very drinkable ale with good flavor."
"Clear amber with a frothy head that dissapated quickly.  Slightly hoppy aroma.  Somewhat thin mouthfeel, but with a nice spice / hop flavor.  Decent amber ale, but not nearly as good as others in the same genre."
"Beautiful looking beer, nice red-amber color with a thick creamy head, which leaves a multitude of lace trails and rings on the glass.  Aroma is sweet and malty, with earthy hops.  Flavor is solid, sweet malt dominates at the beginning and in the finish.  Hops come in to play somewhere in the middle.  I'd like the hop bite to linger through the finish of the beer, but then I'd also like to have a Ferrari 360 Modena.  Such is life.  Mouthfeel is a bit watery, though has some smoothness to it.  Very good as a session brew, but don't let it warm much, because the taste can go south pretty quickly."
"Nice sweet malt. Moderate hoppage but nothing overpowering. Good easy drinking beer. It's something I'd probably take to parties and cookouts since I'm not big on the typical lagers."
"I was very impressed with this offering from Boston Beer.  Having just experienced a poor case of Double Bock and a slightly dissapointing Weiss, this beer was truly a treat.  I love the way the malt flavors play off the bitterness of the hops.  Wonderful, inviting color and aroma, with a nice thick head that slowly dissipates but leaves a reminder that it was there.  Very good ale.  It would be easy to drink too many of these."
"Rich copper color, good carbonation. A rocky, multi-level just-slightly-off-white head with popping bubbles. Nice lacing. A deep floral and fruity hoppy nose. Outstanding balance between the hops and the malt in the mouth. They are both there, working in harmony. Smooth, rich mouthfeel. Bottle doesn't list recipe, but it  seems like there might be some chocolate or roasted malt. A neglected star in the Sammy galaxy. The seasonals, the experiments, the Light and the Lager get the pushes, but this one deserves more attention. Next time Jim needs to  trim the line, drop the Pale Ale, it might distract people from this."
"Aside from Sammy's Double Bock, this is perhaps my favorite Sam Adams. Very, very nice English-style ale! Rich orange/copper hue, with a creamy, just-this-side-of-tan head. Aroma of crisp floral and herbal hops balanced by a delicate sweetness. Initial taste of mild citrus, followed by a mellow, creamy, smooth maltiness. Slightly bitter, refreshing finish. A terrific summer treat!"
"Amber color with an orange hue, foamy white head, clinging lace to the end.  Spicy floral hoppy slightly sweet aroma. Spicy, hoppy, toasted, malty flavor.  Very well balanced.  Very nice slightly dry finish.  Nice lasting aftertaste.  Medium body.  Definitely a staple in the frig along with SA Boston Lager.  Great on those hot Florida days, before, during and after the yard work.  Goes great with food, especially grilled hotdogs, hamburgers, chicken, steaks, seafood and all the fixings.  Did someone say ""Backyard cookout?""  Prosit!"
"Finishes dry and a bit hoppy.   A very good beer, no faults at all."
"This is very similar to Boston Lager, because they use the same grains.  The hop character is as assertive as in the lager, but somehow smoother and spicier due to the English and Czech hops and ale yeast, versus the German hops and lager yeast in the other beer. If you want to try a slightly stronger, fruitier, more complex and less grassy tasting verson of the Boston Lager, this is the one. This is good, well crafted beer. It is not the best beer of this type that I have tasted, but it is very respectable in my opinion."
"Mild sweet/flower nose.  Golden with a slightly amber hue.  Cream/beige color to the head.  BIG bubbbles.  Medium to hight maltiness.  clean finish.  But it lacks hop bitterness for my taste.  solid but nothing special for me in this beer."
"For years Sam Adams' lager, like Sierra Nevada pale ale, has held a special place in my heart because SA managed to combine wide distribution and still maintain a consistent level of quality.  Even in a bar or restaurant where they sell Bud Lite by the tankerload, you can usually count on a bottle of SA lager in the cooler.  For some reason, I just never got around to trying SA's stock ale (distracted by more exotic lures, I guess).  Now I'm kicking myself for ignoring this tasty ale for so long.  Solid malt and a respectable hops kick - nothing over the top, but quality beer, through and through."
"This is by far and away my favorite beer in my favorite style, and thus it is my first and only perfect 5.  I’ve always loved most of Jim Koch’s beers, but when I’ve got to convince a doubter as to the quality of American beers, I tell them to have a Sam Adams Boston Ale, as it is simply world class.  The Beer Advocate, Todd A., hits the nail on the head when he said this was a perfectly balanced beer.  This is a “mass produced” (almost) beer you can give to the greatest beer snobs of Europe, and convince them that the Colonies can produce a unique, yet world class, beer. A great beer."
"everything i enjoy in an ale.  orange-copper in color...a nice sticky head, a combination english/american hop aroma and a balanced malt flavor that leans towards the spicy (hoppy) side.   an quintessentially american style ale, it balances everything we all love in ales into one brew. sound impossible? try this stuff."
"Good solid Ale that I have always thought well of. Believe it or not it is not a regular staple in my fridge... Very smooth and highly drinkable, comes the closest for me to English ales. I have revised my opinion of this brew to a slighlty lower plane. While I still have a high opinion of it, I just don't seek it out all that much. In fact that is kind of what Johnny P. said about Sam Adams beers. Good but they just don't inspire."
"Light orange in color and very clear.  The head retention is sufficient enough to leave a lace.  The mildly grassy and floral hop nose is accompanied by a mellow and pleasant diacetyl note, as well as crystal malt sweetness.  Yeast esters are minimal.  Boston Ale is very clean all around in flavor profile.  The moderate hop bitterness is well balanced by a firm maltiness and fairly dextrinous body.  The hop flavor is quite earthy w/ a mellow floral note, and isn't overbearing.  Lots of biscuit malt flavors in the somewhat dry finish.  Although much cleaner and less estery than a good British pale, this makes for a good session brew if you're into British hop flavor."
"Presentation: Packaged in a brown twelve-ounce custom long neck bottle with a pop-off crown, served in a syandard pint tap glass."
"This stuff is great, I always drink the lager... I didnt know what I was missing...It pours a very nice dark amber color with a nice fluffy tan head that dies pretty quick. On the nose it has pleasant floral hops and light caramel malt, as well as vanilla aromas. A hint of hop flavor and a light medium body and malt content round out this brew, grainy. Long, smooth, clean finish."
"An average ale, with an easy drinking character, not too complex and perhaps a bit of a metallic finish, there are better beers from samuel adams."
"10"
"Boy I love the aroma of this beer...initially floral, but then a citrucy fruity smell comes through...the hops aren't as strong as you'd expect in the taste but they are very nice...Good maltiness balances this out perfectly.  Very flavorfull for a lighter ale...an excellent beer top-to-bottom.."
"Stock ale is one of the few classic beer styles to have originated in the United States, and the style has a strong New England heritage. Stock ales were brewed and fermented in the traditional ale manner and then aged in cool rooms called ""stock cellars."" The special ales were called ""stock"" ales because of this extra aging, which gave them a characteristic body and smoothness."
"I'm in the same boat as Gary.  I just picked up a six after a many-year hiatus and really enjoyed the beer.  I'll be back for more sooner next time."
"It has been quite a while since I've tried Sam Adams Ale.  Had to try one on my way through Boston Airport last weekend.  This is a very drinkable beer, while not great, it has something that will bring me back - this time I won't go six years without having another."
"A light taste of caramel and spicy hops."
"Execellent, smooth ale, not as recognized as their other beers.  Goes with all types of food.   A good starter beer for someone trying to expand their tastes to full bodied ales."
