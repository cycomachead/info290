The taste was very clean with focus on the hops in the beginning leading to a lot of great citrus notes. The finish had a nice bite with little aftertaste which was very refreshing.","WhiteHillsStore","Oct 14, 2014"

Smell is of malt, grape juice, and slight herbal aromas. Taste is much the same with malt, fruit, and some charcoal like flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and dry mouthfeel. Overall, this is an average beer with an odd charcoal quality that reminds me of burnt steak.","UCLABrewN84","Jan 30, 2014"

It's a good beer, but it's size and substance make it more of a one-and-done type of brew than a sessionable option. Perhaps not quite as approachable to the neophyte as you'd want a flagship beer to be, but it certainly has its place. It's a good pairing option for pub fare and comfort foods.","ryan1788a5","Mar 22, 2013"

Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, earth, earth hop, spicy hop, and subtle milk chocolate. The flavor was of sweet malt, earth, fruit, earth hop, and skunky hop. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a fairly average brew. Out of the pale ales that I had in this sampler flight this was my least favorite of the bunch. The skunky note I picked up on in this one really wasn’t that pleasant at all and really took me back at first. As it warmed this became a little more sharp. Also the milk chocolate note on the nose felt a little out of place as well. I think this brew might have had an identity crisis if I am honest and didn’t know what it wanted to be when it grew up. Worth trying, but I doubt I will be having it again.","thagr81us","Nov 21, 2012"

Nice breadiness from the yeast and malts utilized here, definitely a beer that can be drank in number wouldn't mind the 12 pack of cans for tailgating. I'm sure this one is meant to be consumed fresh. Still has a fair amount of bitterness but it's completely different kind of hop flavor more earthy/floral notes coming out rather than the high alpha acid hops that our beers typically are brewed with. There's almost a layer of brine that brings the sweet malts, floral/fruity notes all together along with the thick crusted artisan bread like notes that I get with each sip from the yeast. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied what a great drinking session ale it really packs in the flavor I'm glad I tried this beer after seeing it in BA mag ads for the past few years, it's about time I scored a few bottles.

The malt base isn't particularly complex here, this doesn't has the depth I'd expect from a MO-forward beer. Light in body with high carbonation, providing a crisp finish.

Nice hopping with a bite expected for a pale ale. Sweet for a pale ale with notes of licorice and butterscotch. Mouthfeel is thick and chewy.

As the beer mellows a bit, some toasted toffee malts pull through, but there's an off-note that reminds me of tart fruits--not exactly fitting for the style. A bit of spiced wood finishes with a dry bitterness of raw hop leaves. This beer could use a boost in the malts department, if only to make the body a bit fuller and not so dry on the finish; feels like it's sucking the moisture out of my tongue with each sip. The carbonation could also stand to be toned down a bit. A bit difficult to drink, especially for a style that should go down easily and refresh the palate.","wagenvolks","Jun 14, 2009"

A decent head for a pale ale, about 1 finger of creamy white head sat for a bit before dissolving down, but leaving a nice stick white lace throughout. The aroma lacked the pungent hop in-your-face that many have, likely since this ale balances malt & hop nicely. Floral hops meet grainy malt met the nose & palate.

It is medium bodied, and for a beer with a 6.8 ABV, you won't notice the alcohol. I don't detect much in the way of floral overtones, but you can taste some of the hoppy esters as the beer warms. The mouthfeel is excellent. This is a pure vanilla cream on the tongue and very satisfying. The only negative is a overly hoppy aftertaste that becomes a bit more pronounced as the beer warms.

Overall, though, this beer sits on the front of the tongue, with a slight malt sweetness present. The mouthfeel is quite smooth for a pale ale and very nice.

Maybe a little too much balance in favor of malt qualities. But it's a pretty beer overall. The midsection is heavy with caramel and nougat. Some piney hop tones prick the tongue every once in a while. There's a lingering huskiness and bitterness. Not really astringent, but not your typical ""APA"" bitter finish either.

It's full and frothy ivory head eventually settles to a short cap of creamy foam that leaves rings and sheets of lace about the glass; and it's clear amber-copper body reveals glowing highlights of orange. The nose is clean, and a bit subdued for the style, but offers a nice combination of sweetish biscuity and bready malt laced with mildly citrusy and floral hops. A very fine-bubbled and moderate carbonation leaves it smooth across the palate with just a delicate zest on the tip of the tongue. Sweetish, biscuity malts return in the flavor, vibrantly infused with the same citrusy (tangerine, mild grapefruit) and floral hop character found in the nose; and backed by a brisk bitterness that leads to a dry and refreshing finish. Nicely done! This is a really drinkable beer and I'd suggest it as a session beer except for its surprising 6.8% alcohol content.","NeroFiddled","Dec 21, 2004"

The appearance is nice, a cloudy apricot color, with a huge head that looks like sea foam. Smell is extremely fruity, with cherry and apricots, mixed with spice. The taste is very tart (hinting at the lambic style) with the taste of sour apples and limes. The mouthfeel is overly carbonated, with tiny bubbles hitting the tongue.

The smell is very tart at the outset, with citrus overtones, and not much else, and I was interested to see if the lemony tang would follow through in the taste. It did, to the point that my nose tickled. There's a thin but sharp, almost lambic, tint to this pale ale.

A thin layer of foam sticks to the lip as the first sip is taken. The flavor incorporates the above mentioned aromas, along with a well balanced grainy/worty malt that renders a smooth as silk mouthfeel. The hops are prominent but not overwhelming. The balance may be near perfect with this brew. The aroma and flavor hops are right on the money. Well calculated bitterness is countered by a semi-sweet grain middle, then a fruity citrus hop finish. Satisfying and drinkable. Had the pleasure of enjoying on tap at Anam Cara - 25 Sep, 03.

3.5,-3.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"If you go to Nantucket, it's here, it's there, it's everywhere. Pours a light orange, slight head. The taste is slightly pale, nothing biting here. The hops are there but, nothing overwhelming. Just a slightly above average beer, good for a long ferry ride.","bewareOFpenguin","Jul 21, 2003"
3.26,-10.2,4,3,3.5,3,3,"Nice presentationGewurztraminer style, brown 750 Ml, cap-finished bottle with a sophisticated looking brown label, matching the style of the other Cisco labels. No dating system was evident. This sure is a pricey offering though, at almost $7 for a 750 of pale ale The beer pours a slightly hazed, orangey-amber with a massive, bottle-conditioned head of soapy-looking beach foam, which had an interesting tendency to collapse like a soufflé. I had a hard time coaxing much of an aroma out of this onethere were some hops, but mostly I smelled yeast. The flavor started the same way-yeasty, with some hops underneath. Talk about clean: the intensely-prickly carbonation washed away any flavor before it had a chance to take root in my mouth. A more vigorous top-up pour released an even larger head, but also allowed some of the subtle, pale maltiness to come through. The bottle claims this to be an IPA style, though the web page makes a seemingly contradictory claim of an English style beer. Id put my money on the latter, as I certainly dont taste any American hops. The web page goes on to mention a kiss of Kent Goldings, which seem to be evident in their tart earthiness, though not abundant. Style buffs may call this an English IPA. Personally, I wish it had more hops and/or more malt character. Sub 1.070 OG beers can be wonderful to drink, but it helps if theres something interesting going oninteresting, estery yeast strain, aromatic malts, bold hop expression, Maris Otter sweetnessjust give me something This beers biggest attraction was its simplicity, its cleanliness and its spritzy yeastiness. Its possible that this is an old bottle, but it tasted fresh enough. Boring overall","TXHops","Jun 06, 2003"

3.38,-6.9,4,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Drinkability: Average... This could be a enjoyable brew if they tweaked the recipe and/or brewing process to get the flavor balance right, and lowered the carbonation to an acceptable level. For an IPA, the hops were practically nonexistent. A decent beer, but with considerable flaws...","MJR","Jun 02, 2003"
3.03,-16.5,3.5,3,3,3,3,"Large bubbly head that goes quick. Cloudy amber color - traces of yeast - and faint nose of malt and hops. For a pale it isn't loaded with hops like most are. Starts with a malt/hop mix and finishes with a mild hoppy flavor, it is better after warming some. Look for a black bottle.","jdhilt","Jun 01, 2003"
4.55,25.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,5,"Thanks to Loren (VENOM) for sending this to me. I made this my #200 because I knew that any beer that he sent me would never disappoint and would be worthy of a century mark or 2.","Jarod","Apr 14, 2003"
3.6,-0.8,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,"On the last sip, one begins to wonder where it all went wrong. This ale seems to have some real substance but it just never comes together harmoniously. I'm certainly hoping that the carbonation issue with my sample was simply a fluke but its worth reviewing for just that reason--to help keep BAs informed.","Riggo","Mar 07, 2003"
3.48,-4.1,2.5,4.5,4,2.5,2,"Note: I have had repeated problems with the carbonation and the size of the head on this beer (multiple samples, different purchases over a period of three months). Even with a very delicate pour, the head is out of control (i.e., well over three inches), and this makes it difficult for me to judge the beer's appearance (distorted), mouthfeel (way too fizzy) and drinkability (annoying). I plan on returning to this one in a few months with the hope that these problems will be corrected, so that I can adjust my review accordingly.","jward","Feb 08, 2003"
4.42,21.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"1/24/03 Currently drinking the 750mL version. Noticeably more carbonation, with a denser creamier head that works very well in smoothing out the beer. Also a more prominent yeast flavor, dare I say overabundant, which I have noticed in other Cisco beers. While this is still very good, I have to recommend the smaller bottle which will seem perverse to many seasoned beer drinkers. However, the smaller bottle has a truer pale ale flavor, with less yeast, sweeter malts and more prominent hops. It is also more bang for your buck: my 4pack of 12-ozers was 9.99, while I believe the 750 is typically 6.99 (although it some places it may be cheaper).","Thrasher","Jan 13, 2003"
4.12,13.5,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,"On the pour dreary deep amber to burnished copper color with a portly head and the texture frothy, color a light tan with oodles of fine lace to coat the glass. A light scent of the hop flower, which blends well with the orange like sweetness and the underlying malt, caps this fine nose. Malt and somewhat sweet beginning, the top middle of the road in feel the finish gratifying in its hops spiciness, the carbonation agreeable with the aftertaste dry and lingering. A very drinkable and quite refreshing beer, which once again I wish, were more readily available here in the destitute West.","Gusler","Jan 08, 2003"
4.2,15.7,4,4,4.5,4,4,"This brewery's beers all seem to be a half step off style - which, as someone who never colored inside the lines, I appreciate.","sponberg","Sep 28, 2002"
4.1,12.9,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Deep golden with an orange hue; minimal white head with little retention (the bartender at Redbones tonight was not concerned with pouring beers with any head whatsoever). Nose is mostly floral/citric hops.  Taste is primarily hoppy with a citric bite; a toasted malt flavor becomes apparent as the beer warms. This is a brew I'd return to with no hesitation.","doerickson","Sep 26, 2002"
4.53,24.8,4.5,4,5,4,4.5,"Pours a nice cloudy peach color with a huge frothy white head that dissipates rather slowly and leaves a monster lace all the way down the glass.  The aroma is of subtle, earthy hops with a bit of fruitenes thrown in and some light biscuity malt.  The flavor starts off with some mild biscuity maltiness before going to a great light fruity flavor that is accompanied by just enough hop bitterness for the rest of the brew.  This is one seriously carbonated brew, as all of Cisco's beers seem to be be, but it remains creamy and crisp and exceedingly drinkable.  I need to try some Cisco brews on draught and that is all their is to it.","Murph","Aug 13, 2002"

4.17,14.9,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Cisco lists this one as an IPA, but its bitterness is closer to an American pale.  The brew is unfiltered which is fine from the tap, but creates way too much carbonation from the bottle. Whale's Tale has a distinct earthy/grassy character which definitely is a plus.  This is a unique beer in its style and worth a try.","beernut7","May 05, 2002"
