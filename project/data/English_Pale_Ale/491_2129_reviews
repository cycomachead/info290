"It's been a few years since I have had this beer. It is a pretty darn good English pale ale."
""
"Giving this a 5 because its a great beer from a great country I like to call home. Only Aussie beer I can get here in Chicago pretty much, which totally sux"
"So here I am, eating some 'roo and watching some cricket, and decide to try this bad boy. Smells better than it tastes, but still a very tasty beer. Definitely will drink again."
"I'm sorry but this is Something like a a plain light beer, nothing of a pale ale."
"Nice balance and good finish. Difficult to find and worth the wait"

"375 ml bottle into pint glass, best after 8/22/2013. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy golden straw color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of lemon, pear, apple, cracker, bread, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste lemon, pear, apple, cracker, lightly toasted bread, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Light earthy herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, pear, apple, cracker, lightly toasted bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Good balance and robustness of pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and slightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 4.5%. Overall this is a very solid English pale ale style. All around good balance and robustness of pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."
"It's like a bud light"

"Light fruit in the aroma while appearance is gold-yellow and lightly sedimented.  The flavor is of citrus and has a background of grain/bread."
""
""
""
"Overall - Well balanced in the flavour but off style in some of the categories having said that it is still very drinkable and very tasty."
""
"Upfront there is a light to moderate flavor of pale and grainy malts with minimal amounts of sweetness. That is followed by light flavors of light fruit/spicy yeast and just a light amount of floral hops. A light amount of bitterness is present in the finish and fades away fairly quickly."
"O: Light and refreshing, somewhat thirst quenching - this would be a good sessionable beer for a hot summer day. Easy to drink."
"Overall: this is definitely Coopers most popular beer and their best seller. Although they have better beers such as Best Extra Stout and Extra Strong Vintage Ale, this is the one that they are best known for. Decent flavours across the palate, and now for a good price at AU44 a case (though I think they usually retail closer to $50)."

"Cooper's Pale Ale from Australia. Unfiltered, pours cloudy, light golden color. Light and refreshing. Just a slight citrus note. I like this one, even though I'm not a big fan of the citrus. If I ever move to Australia I think I would drink a lot of Cooper's."

"Easy to drink, with a pleasant flavour, albeit on the weak end of the flavour scale. The beer equivalent of a soda with lime; a tad on the bland side, but crisp and refreshing. Not the best Coopers brew, but it's usually cheap on tap and there is no better beer in its price range. Get a cheap jug of this next time you're at a bar in an Aussie uni; made for many good nights."

"Poured from a brown 12.7 oz. bottle. Has a light golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of grains, actually a bit skunky. Taste is grains, mild hops, a bit of malts, refreshing but not exactly flavorful. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is OK, but nothing special."

"Overall: Not a bad beer, but nothing too exciting either. I wouldn't seek this beer out again, but I wouldn't be opposed to drinking it again, either."

"o - what the ... was that? just awful or did I get a bad bottling?"

"Pours a murky light yellow-orange with a foamy tan head that fades to nothing. No lacing on the drink down. Tiny particles of sediment are seen suspended in the beer after the pour. Smell is of malt, yeast, and some floral hop aromas. Taste is much the same with grain and slight herbal hop flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an average beer that is drinkable but pretty boring all around in my opinion."
"Beer with yellow liquid and with good foaming with good duration. The foam is white and the last drops beer made ​​from this slightly brown foam. Malt aroma. In taste the bitterness of the hops leaving a bitter aftertaste and fast. Light beer good drinkability. Good for summer."

"Pretty decent quaff, great as a Session beer, but still reasonably flavorful. You can really tell the English influence which I liked. I wish I had in my country a major brewery with such decent quality, good beer for the masses."
"Coopers Pale Ale looks great, on account of the bottle fermentation and subsequent sediment. The smell is ok as is the taste. It's a little too high on the carbonation for my liking, but it will have its adherents due to the marketing of their unique approach to brewing."

"Decent, and ok for the summer. I kinda liked this one, and could drink it again."
""
""
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Unusual hue, fair head, and spotty lacing. Smell of pungent citrus notes accentuate a light bread malt, and a soapy hop. A little grainy, with a light citrusy hop. Overall, this is a pretty decent quaff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pretty bland and unexciting with not a whoe lot going for it really. It didn't seem much like an English pale ale or even a golden ale to me either, it was just so ordinary and bland. The carbonation was a bit strong and the body a bit light with almost no taste or smell to speak of."

"I would definitely never choose this over Coopers Sparkling Ale, and there are a bunch of other pale ales that are better."

"I tried Coopers Pale Ale after a friend spoke highly of it while in Australia a few years ago. years later trying it while listening to a band from Australia. Maybe a faint grain malt smell. The malt character is bread, yeast. Most of the sediment was mixed, would leave that out next time.Not enough hops for my liking. I'll stick with the band before the brew."
""
"O: Classic Pale Ale. A session Ale for hot wheater. Simple but pleasant. Quite average..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Really not that good of a beer certainly won't buy again. Their sparkling ale is better!"
""
""
""
"Wasn't impressed with this at all. Didn't make me think of an English pale at all. Tasted like macro-swill."
""
""
""
"Quite like this as an everyday type beer. It's nothing special but I'd rather drink this over a macro any day of the week."
""
""
"Would really like to try this one again as I only had it once. Has a lovely appearance with the top fermenting and secondary fermenting process giving this one that distinctive Cooper's cloudy appearance. Nice aromas with noticeable hops and malts but really nice how this one does not go overboard with the bitter taste. It really finds a nice balance and this is one of Cooper's most easy-drinking beers and should be suitable for most palates. This is more of an entry-level beer for a brewer that does some interesting things and should be recommended to anyone that wants to try something other than the multitude of lagers and carbonated lagers that are available. Having a really pale ale like this one is a nice change with a nice head, nice taste and strikes a beautiful balance. This is highly recommended for those wanting a step up from the ordinary lager but someone who doesn't have as much experience as other drinkers. It's a solid beer."
"OVERALL: Much nicer than I remember but then it's the first time I've had it without condensation around the glass. I think its citrusy wateriness suits the scorching Aussie heat."
""
"O - Fairly low profile pale ale, nothing spectacular but drinkable when faced with lesser alternatives."
"Poured into a pint glass, this beer has a semi dark(dirty blonde) with a gritty body and is topped off with a tan thick head that’s very frothy and has hints fermentation. It has some faint smells of lemons, apple, and orange. Its crisp and harsh on the tip of your tongue, the hops are pretty present but not overpowering-it is slightly bitter overall. It’s pretty easy to drink and the bitterness becomes more tames in its aftertaste. It does has a light to medium mouth feel."
""
""
""
""
""
"I love Cooper's Sparkling Ale, their stout, their Vintage but this really is a blemish on their reputation. and that's always been the case I'm afraid."
""
"Pours a clear, typical sunny yellow with a decent, if not persistent, white head. Aroma is - hello? OK, not strong, just malty, a teeny fruity, nothing special but still acceptable. Malty flavor has hints of fruit and hops, and is on the wan side. Smooth texture has average body and little fizz. This is best as a party beer or along with a meal."
""
""
"O: Could have been better than it was. Not a terrible beer, but pretty forgettable."
""
"O/D - Quite lemony and not too interesting of a pale ale. Doesn't really fit the style but it's decently enjoyable. Quite cheap as well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Another worthy brew from Coopers, no regret for picking it up."
"O- with lager being nearly the only option at most pubs of the area, its nice to find something to revive a guy from a boredom induced coma. There are better examples of Oz Pale Ale, but there are worse too. This is worth a try."
""
"Pours an opaque amber with foamy energetic head that dissipates quickly. Little on the nose except some bread notes. Flavour is crisp and bready but no mid-palate which makes it a little unsatisfying. Pride of Ringwood hops are very bland and are a common Oz hop which explains a lot I suppose. Drinkability is good with a nice sparkly mouthfeel so it is good at a BBQ. Not a great beer for art's sake."
""
""
""
"O --- Boring and lacking. i'm not sure what the goal of this beer was, but it misses it on all fronts."
""
""
"Overall - not remarkable - though still better than the average joe beers around."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a very basic boring beer. I know that the beer is suppose to be like this, but man I want more hops. Just not very good."
"This beer poured out with a golden color and a ton of flakey sediment in the bottle. The head was fluffy and white. The smell of the beer was a little bit on the hoppy side and then there were some malt aromas too. The taste of the beer was pretty crisp I thought, leaving a bitterness in the back of the tongue. The mouthfeel of the beer isn't too bad, It's light and drinkable. Overall not my favorite pale ale, they could have filtered it a little better I think but too each his/her own."
""
"Overall it's not too bad, better than other (non-Belgian) pales ales I've tried, but nothing I'd seek out in the future."
"O: Easy drinker, not a unique pale ale but still an enjuoyable beer. Goes good with food."
"Sorry Cooper's I wanted to like this. I'll give you a try on tap if I ever make my way down under, but until then it's adieu to Cooper's Pale ale."
"probably my favourite bottled pale ale right now."
"overall; this was a pleasant surprise, a pale ale with some saison-like hops. A great pale ale for people who appreciate hops but don't seek their overwhelming dominance in a beer."
"you know what? in australia where by and large, beer is awful and over priced, this coopers product really gets the job done. its much more of a beer than tooheys or carlton or any of the other domestic offerings, and its available everywhere. pours a cloudy (bottle-conditioned) golden color with a good head on it. its a crisp beer with a body on the lighter side of medium. i cant count the nights i split a slab of these with the boys on the beach. always refreshing, and even better on tap. if you live in australia, this makes a great daily brew."
"O: This is a decent pale ale. Nothing extradionary but pretty well rounded and balanced."
"O- What a shame! I find this brewery can definitely make some good beer. It's just, their pale ale recipe is quite mediocre. I was expecting a fair bit more than this."
"Overall a decent beer that suffers a bit from comparisons to style guidelines."
"Note: NOT reviewed to style."
"Pours a see through pale straw hue with floaties and decent carbonation that leaves behind a fast vanishing two finger head and only a rim of lacing,the smell is grains,herbal hops and pale malts,the mouthfeel is light bodied and has tastes of white grapes,grains and herbal hops and overall another average big Aussie brewery beer thats better than a couple but not alot."
"Bland, and at times unenjoyable, this is a very meh drop of ale."
"O: There’s nothing particularly unique about the taste, but it is very light, refreshing and thirst quenching. This would make for a very sessionable beer on a hot summer day."
"O- I will buy this beer again, pour good and all the yeast settles at bottom of bottle so my glass was pretty with this beer. If you see it buy it, may not be you, but buy it. I could drink a few and be ok for a while. Not a typical pale ale in my sense, but a good beer.B"
"O: Fairly solid beer, I reckon I'd pick this one up on occasion in the future."
"It's got pretty solid drinkablility given it's basic flavor profile. Not the best Aussie beer I've had, but solid."
"Prefer out of bottle, actually. More complex."
"O - Tasty, but not the pale ale I was expecting. I was hoping for something a with a bit more hops, and this one was certainly a bit of a disappointment. I'm wondering if it's an age thing, and they mellowed or if it's meant to be rather light on the hops."
"Dr: It's unfairly priced, and not particularly good even for the style."
"D: Good to kick back a few and enjoy."
"Light on the flavor, but very refreshing. Perfect lawnmower beer."
"D: Given the abv, I can easily put away a few of these away."
"Food match: Grilled chicken or fish with a light salad drizzled with balsamic vinegar, maybe calamari or other seafood (crab, lobster)."
"A classic Aussie Pale Ale with plenty to like."
"D - All in all, this is an extremely sessionable brew. It may npt be the perfect example of the style, but it is something that you could drink all day long on a hot Summer day."
"Liam"
"It's an odd tasting take on the style but it sure is easy enough to drink despite the overload of carbo."
"Fruity aromas greet the nose, with a yeasty background. This is carried through in the taste, which has some light grapefruit notes and good grain characteristics that are hard to isolate due to the exuberant carbonation. Enough hops to brighten the flavor, but not too bitter or overpowering. Altogether a mellow mouthful."
"Drinkability: While in Sydney I've had this several times both from the bottle and on tap. I'm only reviewing this on tap since that is where it shows best. Also based on the bottles I've had in Sydney, I'm suspecting that the subtle flavors involved here simply don't stand up well to being bottled and shipped great distances. The beer when fresh is lightly crisp, quite refreshing to drink and a great option when out for an evening with friends."
"Once upon a time I drank a lot of this beer, mainly directly from the stubby. My palate has changed a lot since then & know I find it nowhere as drinkable. Still a good starting point for lager drinkers to get into ales."
"I'm a little surprised this one doesn't get more love, I liked it but it's a pricey here in Alberta"
" Im a fan of Coopers beers they are easy to get hold of here and are good value."
"Taste was just carbonation and corn. Very light mouthfeel, no hops. Might as well call this Coors Light or Foster's. And its expensive. Forget you! There just wasn't any redeeming quality in this beer."
"Drinkability: flavor and feel are pretty darn good. Though this beer basically smells like nothing, it is refreshing, tasty and quite drinkable indeed."
"a lemony pale with a light color of yellow/orange. has a hop quality more so than anything else. not too good for a malt character. giving it a lack luster body. nose of lemon and lemon grass. i wouldn't call it a grassy beer. not particularly sweet in palate with a citrus quality hop. no really finish of bitter. some protein after a bit. had much better from this brewery."
"Overall, a very nicely sweet beer with lots of 'indulgent' flavours of chocolates and sweets."
"D: Low abv and nothing seriously wrong make it drinkable. Just nothing special."
"D - Overall it's a nice beer. But there is nothing remarkable about it. It's not really a pale ale though. What is it really?"
"Above average. Sierra is probably a more flavorful and cheaper option, but this is a nice change of pace too. I bet most of the really bad reviews here had some pretty old bottles. New/fresh - this one is pretty hard to dislike."
"Very subtle malt taste. No roasted grains, very little hop bitterness, and a semi-tart flavor. Very little carbonation. Drinkability is below average. I don't know if this beer is bad, or what, but something is just off about it."
"Had this cold from the bottle, showing a slightly orange-ish clear yellow gold with a fair white head and minor lacing. Noted a good deal of brownish sediment at the bottom, like cinnamon. The nose picks up a decided sour mash and bayberry, sort of a dry grass hop perhaps. The flavor gives a pretty good grassy kick, again a dry hop effect, fairly sharp and no sweetness. It's hard to pick up much else, a little malt maybe way in the background, and a clove-orange hint if you stretch your imagination. It has a spicy overtone, fair carbonation in a mid to light body. The feel is generally crisp and refreshing but a bit aqueous. I can't say this floats my boat but I can drink it. Would be fine with pizza but otherwise, not one to search out. Drinkable but not highly desirable."
"D: Low alcohol and low flavor so yeah, drinkable, although I wouldn't be bothered having more than one because I don't enjoy it enough."
"D: Goes down OK, but I would only drink it with a meal. On its own it's a little mundane."
"D-- Can drink several of these easily. Solid beer...BUT... If you are a hophead avoid this beer. You will be disappointed. Much smoother and balanced than the APA style. This is no longer one of my first choices in Australia for accessible beer. Little Creatures is far more aggressive and bolder than this. Still think Coopers Stout, Sparkling and Vintage Ale are far superior to this. If I grade this against AU APA's this is a D. As an EPA it is a good beer and a good choice for a Sunday session. I think holds up well against the UK style."
"Not heavy, but very flavorful for a refreshing type beer. Miss it greatly, some imported bottles in the US. Draught is the way to go."
"And yes, it was rolled."
"D: Somewhat tasty, goes down easily, not a bad macro alternative in a place that doesn't offer craft beers."
"Poured from a 12.7 ounce stubby bottle with best after date on label. Light yellow color with very little head. Scents of sweetness, other than that no outstanding smell. Crisp flavor, with citrus notes. Little bit of spice notes. More hoppy than malts. Pretty mild flavor, very subtle. Very drinkable."
"Drinkability- ok, I would drink it again. Not too bad"
"Overall I remember it being more flavorful when I was halfway around the world and I'm sure it loses at least a little bit of flavor when it's not fresh. Not one to seek out but not a terrible option."
"Bought this at a foreign grocery store in Beijing, craving a taste of real beer. I was not particularly impressed by this offer from Coopers. It poured cloudy, opaque and strawgold into the cup. About one finger of head. From the smell, I got mostly the bitterness of hops, perhaps a slight hint of butter if you are looking for it. The taste really accented the bitterness of hops also, leaving almost no trace of malt, or pine or citrus or anything else. It's crisp, if not a little bit fizzy on the tongue. The beer is drinkable, but to me, neither interesting nor really enjoyably well-balanced."
" D- There is no depth just a pungent bitterness from the hops and no real malt flavors."
"Overall it is one of the better mass produced Australian beers. If you do plan to come to Australia, this should be a good place to start your tour of what is on offer!"
"Right up there with Little Creatures Pale Ale as the best Pale Ale in Australia (to my knowledge anyway)"
"One of the more common ales to be found at your average pub. Used to be my mainstay but recently James Squire Golden Ale has taken over as the beer I drink when I can't see anything better on offer."
"It's drinkable, this is true, but it isn't really what I'd expect for a beer of this style or any beer, really."
"drinkability not bad"
"Pours a hazy straw color, half a finger of head with not much retention on the pour. Taste is like a mildly sweeter, fruity corona or something. Very very grainy, not a flavor I would like to enjoy often. Very fizzy mouthfeel, harsh."
"D: The Sparkling Ale was decent, but this beer is a mess with a puckering astringency that puts this one in the ""skip it"" category for me."
"Drinkability- Just not much happening here. Perhaps good for a hot day."
"A very interesting pale ale."
"not a gold winning, but still good."
"Pours a slightly hazy pale golden color with an average white head that settles into a light ring. The aroma is light, some lemon tea like characteristics. The taste is lemony, perhaps some green apple skins, light grassy notes and an earthy bitterness in the end. The feel is light and very fizzy, a bit tart on the palate; finishes quite dry. An ok EPA, probably a bit too fizzy and too dry. Could use more malt flavor."
"Not bad, but not really a pale ale in bearing, there's just no sweetness to the malt, and that becomes a drag after a short while. Dryness usually has lots to recommend it, but it must be used much more deftly than it is here. One and done, I'm afraid."
"The taste is light, very subdued, and a bit thin, but it's persistent and it at least hold up well. It has light grain that lasts from start to finish with a faint bubblegum quality near the finish along with toasted grain. Initially, there is brief sweetness with definite grassy bitterness and flavour coming up before the finish. The start seems a buit creamy but the finish is dry and a bit watery."
"(P.S. it's better than Fosters)"
"Wow I had quite a different experience than the rest of you bottle drinkers. I am sorry, but its a nice sessionable PA. Great with a fish n'chips or back deck beer."
"Very watery, too much carbonation."
"375mL bottle. Pours nearly opaque ruddy gold with a small, fizzy white head. Some sediment present. Smells of honey-like malt with some faint floral character. Tastes of sweet grainy malt and a bit of pepper, with only the slightest bitterness at the end. Fairly weak and boring."
"Pale and a cloudy orange color without the cloudiness (get it?). No head. Smells faintly of budweiser. Sigh. Very light flavor - macro-lager bitterness (??). Surely it's being served too cold, here. Would being warmer help it? Well, it would probably take some of the bite off and it might not seem quite so over-carbonated. But would it help? I don't really think so."
"I've tried Cooper's Pale Ale a few times now and I'm always left a little unsatisfied. It's bottle conditioned and it looks and smells very interesting - it pours a murky wheat-beer sort of texture with a decent head and has a nice bit of bacteria floating in the bottom of the bottle. Its smells fresh and hoppy too yet while the mouthfeel is nice, the taste is disappointing. It's refreshing alright but it just doesn't have the hoppy bite of a good pale ale. This isn't a bad brew (it certainly beats the hell out of any of the more commercial Australian beers) but I just feel it promises a bit more than it delivers."
"interesting brew, but not a love at first sight ...."
"This brew is crisp and light as I drink it. It is definitel refreshing. Good for drinking while out in the sun. An improvement over say, Foster's or Heineken for sure. But it is not a beer I would seek out."
"Whole > Σ Parts"
"Not a bad beer. Not world shattering, but not a disappointment."
"Pours a pale golden yellow with a thin white head. Clear with some sediment. Head dissipates quickly, no collar or laciness. Faint citruis, hoppy scent with some malt. Taste is also faint with hops and malt. Slight bitterness and decent balance. Not robust with flavor, on the watered down side. Decent body and thin texture. Not a bad beer, on the light side. Could handle a couple of these at a BBQ on a hot day."
"This poured a golder amber. The smell was weak but hinted at a flowery aroma. The taste was, like the aroma, was weak. Not bad overall but weak. It presented light and smooth mouthfeel. Was easy to drink but I would rather drink Pabst Blue Ribbon (my favorite cheap beer) than this stuff."
"6/3/7/3/13 (3.2/5)"
"My first foray into good beer started with unfiltered wheat beers. This reminds me of a very average wheat beer. It is drinkable, mild, smooth, crisp and sweet. I could drink this on a summer afternoon while enjoying some BBQ or I could drink this with a few friends over. This is a definite session beer for me, but nothing spectacular."
"D: Pretty easy to drink, lighter bodied and nice mouthfeel. All in all, this is an easy-drinking pale ale that would do well in the summer or springtime months. Nothing too complex or bold, but still nuanced enough to get the job done."
"Yuck. I like pale ales, I like blond ales, and I even like unfiltered/bottle conditioned ales (i.e. AleSmith Extra Pale). This beer tastes like none of the above. Its almost as if it was pre-skunked. Pours cloudy copper with plenty of floaties. Stinky nose of sour fruit and malt. Dry, harsh grainy taste with fruity hops that I can't quite place. Sour, not bitter, aftertaste. Keep this down-under, mate."
"D: Moderate flavor and moderate drinkability, would get boring quickly."
"Highly carbonated beer that does go down smooth. I won't be running out to get this one again."
"D. Nothing great but still enjoyable."
"overall a dull brew."
"An averagely OK beer, nothing special nothing stand out. Something you drink with pizza or other strong flavored foods."
"The taste has a hint of lemony tartness once things settle a bit, but overall the beer is quite crisp but also very smooth. There is a combination of bittering hops and peppery spice in the finish. The beer isn't particularly dry, and it might have some florals hidden underneath, but the peppery bite in the finish is what is most pronounced and is the signature element to this beer. The beer is decent but it lacks the creaminess, the hop esters, and the old world taste to make this an interesting EPA. If you have the itch to try Coopers, go for their sparkling beer, which is much better."
"Drinkability however is pretty damn good. A bottle of this is great to commence with friends over, and a great looking beer! Coopers is certainly a great summer brew to indulge into."
"Poured a nice translucent orange color, with carbonation bubbles floating around the center of the beer. Little head that fizzled to just about nothing. Smell was a nice mix of grainy malts and some floral hops, plus a touch of sweetness (orange?). Taste, overall, was fairly bland: generically malty flavor, with a touch of bitter hops at the end, but not much. Became more watered down as it warmed up, and the taste evaporated from my mouth within seconds of swallowing it. It was better than a macro light beer, it was a more full body and nice carbonation, but it was a farily forgetable beer, and I had no intention of drinking another."
"D: Taste is ok, smell blows. It is so light, you can drink this as a lawnmower beer. Its not bad, but I wanted more because I am such a fan of the Cooper's Sparkling Ale. Ah well, not every girl at the party is going to be pretty."
"Poured a very hazy golden golder with a lot of little floaties hanging about, not much in the way of foam or lacing, but otherwise looks pretty good. Smell is right up there as well. Good hop aroma backed up by some sweet malts. Taste is about average. Definite malt sweetness up front, followed by a crisp, fruity hop middle, and dry finish. Mouthfeel is decent, average carbonation and pretty easy to drink. An average Pale, and I like them unfiltered like this one."
"Grabbed a bottle of this at the Phoenix Landing in Cambridge last Saturday night. This is not a bottle you see often at an Irish bar, so I gave it a shot. Poured into a hoegaarden style short pint glass. Orange color, bit cloudy, lots of carbonation. Smell was a bit hoppy. Taste was above average. If I had to choose between a Bass and this, I'd go with this beer. A bit lighter and smoother. A nice surprise."
"Drinkability: A bit of a disappointment, really."
"Pours a slightly cloudy golden with a thin white head. Smells sort of sour and skunky, not very good. Taste is better, the beer is sort of cidery, with a hint of malt. A tiny bit of hops balance. Mouthfeel is pretty good with slightly high carbonation. An easy drinking beer that tastes ok, but I would not consider this an English Pale Ale, it tastes much more like an Americanized Kolsch."
" ~ I'm not going to be purchasing anymore of this pale ale. However, because of the uniqueness of this brew I will likely buy other Coopers Brewery beers in order to round my Australian tastes."
"drinkability is bad. this brew is very weak in flavor, not to mention the watery texture. not impressive."
"Feels overly carbonated, but not a bad beer. Much better ice cold, tends to get too sweet as it warms."
"Very unremarkable beer. It'll sit in the back of my fridge for a good long wile. Maybe I'll use it to steep some brats in. That might be something..."
"Honestly this reminded me very much of Molson Canadian, a lager, in both smell and taste. Next time I'll grab Molson--I'll know what I'm getting, and it's much cheaper. Ordinary."
"D: it's a refreshing beer on a hot day, but the flavour dies off far too quickly and it leaves somewhat of an unpleasant minerally, metallic aftertaste. I'd drink it again if it was offered to me, but I wont be buying it again."
"D: Good - quite easy to drink and completely sessionable at 4.5%. Has it's weaknesses, appearance being the most glaring, but it's one I would be happy to have again."
"I liked it and would certainly enjoy trying this brewery's other offerings, however, I won't seek it out again. I would agree with others on this site that it's worth a try."
"The skunk left after a bit of breathing in my glass. It's unfiltered and bottle conditioned qualities saved this one from being a C/C-."
"D- Very drinkable but I would prefer something a little stronger in the taste."
"D: A very good session or social beer. The light body makes is go down easy. Very unassuming. Perhaps a good beer for a macro drinker who wants to get their feet wet with better beers. I would buy this again."
"Meh. I've enjoyed better versions of the English pale ale (mostly from England!). The Coopers is okay, but not great. I'd call it a lawnmower beer - certainly better than a macro alternative, but not my first (or second) choice off the shelf."
"Pours a nice light amber color with a bit of floaties in it, almost like a wheat ale, with a very fizzy head from a massive amount of carbonation. It does have a hoppy scent, but it's very faint and weak, not very crisp, clean, or fresh. It has a decent taste, nothing great. The flavor and feel is almost like a wheat ale, too, clean and crisp, very refreshing, but it has a very low hoppy/bitter aspect to it. It does go down very smoothly, though. It's worth a try, but there are much better pale ales out there, unless you're looking for something a bit more thirst quenching than hoppy."
"Very easy to drink and pretty much a dead one lawnmower beer. Light beer for a hot climate."
"not horrible, and certainly cheaper than other import ales here in bejing."
"D - I expected more out of it nothing really special just ok but its better than a macro"
"Drinkability: Overall a very easy drinking brew."
"It's winter here, and lots of winter ales are available. But it's summer in Australia, and that's what I think this beer is for. It's sort of like a Fosters pale ale, a pseudo-micro? suitable as a pale-ale lawnmower beer? Not bad to drink, but nothing really special. Just mighty thin for this time of year."
"Pours a pale yellow color with a one-finger head. and some lacing. Aroma is mainly malty/bready and somewhat sweet. Taste is thin and biscuity/bready. Also somewhat fruity. Fades very thin in the aftertaste. Little or no hop bitterness. Just not too impressive here. Barely drinkable."
"Seeing as they are from Australia, the $$$ tag makes sense. Pours a hazy hay yellow with a some head retension and attempts at lacing before settling down to a fairy robust white ring. No overly complex aromas, some floral hop and slight husky, grainy malt. Hop and carbonation tend to bite. The hop really takes hold with a dry, almost puckering feel. Some smooth, grainy maltiness makes the ride more than one dimensional. Found it a bit overcarbonated initially, but otherwise a decent ale that could serve as a decent thirst quencer due to the dryness of the aftertaste."
"Had this at a poker party not to long ago. Not that it is that rare of a beer, but a guy from Australia brought this and the sparkling ale (did not get a chance to try that one though). I was not impressed with this beer. I find it about the same as macro lager crap. Next time I go for the sparkling ale."
"Thin white head that dissipates quickly leaving no lacing. Nice golden hue with specks of sediment floating about. A little hazy but not completely as I didn't pour all of the yeast into the glass. Nice bready yeast smell with a small hidden citrus hint. Nice hops taste but surprisingly not too bitter. Smooth feel with a sweet but disappointing finish. Worth a try but nothing spectacular."
"Not bad for my first Coopers, this would be a decent summer beer, recommended if you are interested in trying something else other than Foster's from the land down under"
"The mouth is slick with lots of carbonation. May be a good hot weather beer, but it really is one and done for me."
"Golden ale in colour with a large thick off white head. Aroma is pretty weak, just malty, slightly caramel. Pretty basic malty flavoured ale, a touch of grassy hop and la touch of citric. Palte is quite nice but nothing stunning Average beer all round."
"Pours out a hazy gold brew with one finger head that dissipates quiickly,highly carbonated.Has a bit of yeasty estery smell to it,,kinda lika a belgian.Taste hmmm,,mild,,a bit dry,,lightly hopped.Not bad,,not one i would crave either. Mouthfeel is ok,,drinkability is ok also i dont know if i could totally session this beer. Definitely worth a try but i wouldnt buy a case."
"12.7oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Best before date clearly shown on neck (19.02.08). Pours a slightly golden yellow color with one finger fizzy white head. The aroma is extremely faint with just a touch of malt and hops. The taste much like the aroma is pretty underwhelming in flavor with some malt and ops in a dry and watery finish. Overall, this was simply not a very enjoyable beer. The aroma and tastes were watered down and the mouthfeel was overly fizzy. Not recommended."
"Drinkable."
"D- Not a bad call when it comes to value for money. It was priced the same as xxxx, VB, and Fosters. This one is easier to drink then Victoria Bitter since less polluted by Aussie favorite Pride Of Ringwood."
"Taste was also very poor."
"D-Easy drinking yet there are some complexities to it. The complexities aren't neccessarily what the type I love but it does make it interesting."
"Straw color with lots of bubbles, but little head. Strange. Bit of dark colored sediment at the end (I say hooray for bottle-conditioning). Smells a bit of apple candy, definitely heavy on the pale malts, as befits the English style. A bit of leafy hops came out on the finish. It's thin and fizzy, but I think it tastes decent enough, and it certainly would work well as a session pale ale. I'm thinking summer barbecues for this one. BTW, regarding what other reviewers have written, I found this has much more of the subtle characteristics of an English pale or mild ale than of macro lager. Would definitely drink this over Heineken any day."
"The carbonation is very good, lots of small bubbles. Very drinkable"
"Light easy beer. Not good for solo consumption, needs to be a food accompaniment. Also, it-a be better really cold."
"DA: not to shabby concidering this stuff travels a long way."
"The pizza restaurant next door to my work has this alongside the typical euro lagers & shitty mainstream aussie beers so it comes in handy from time to time if I'm eating there."
"This gem pours out looking like cloudy and dirty white grapefruit juice. Has a thin ring of ""head."" This really smells akin to a macro lager: just clean and with nothing standing out. Flavor is grainy and nearly tasteless: like drinking a cocktail of 90% club soda and 10% beer. Light and fizzy doesn't begin to describe the mouthfeel here. I'd take a Budweiser or Coors Banquet over this any day."
"I taste, expecting maybe this sampole is spoiled, but it doesn't really seem so. I just get slightly skunky, old, noble hops, booze, soapiness, and a cracked grain finish. It's not doin much for me really and that smell is just horrendous. Drainpour."
"M/D: its ok, its solid, but too weak and waery, too macro in nature, though that may not be fair or descriptive enough"
"Sweet bubblegum and sugarcane in the aroma, progressing into a lite and tasty quaff. Sweetish molasses, lemon and toffee also sneak in there. Fairly reminiscent of a summer Wit brew. Finishes crisp and clean  I could go for a sixer of these critters."
"On a hot summer's day this stuff is pure magic, as it is really refreshing, even when it is not ice cold. The yeast residue may put off some, but when drinking it is hardly detectable. This is a little more expensive than the mainstream Aussie beers, but then it is better quality, so actually pretty good value. Not the most interesting pale ale, but it's easy-drinking, affordable and above all, tastes pretty damn good!"
"You could drink this a long time, but it might sour after a few. Still drinkable and not too bad. Probably willn't buy again, though."
"Ho-hum. This beer comes off like a pale Euro lager even though its an ale. This is probably because it's fairly light but has a mellow, creamy fruit (without any specific fruit discernible) flavor. Basically its light and sweet beer. You know, its like Heineken and its ilk with a little heavier mouthfeel and a bready aroma."
"Slightly let down by this beer as expected something more. Perhaps it's a grower. Felt there was a blandness, maybe needs to be tried again...."
"Overall a pretty much average beer, good for starters on the style, due to its low bitterness."
"It felt this one was a little bland, and missing some of the good characteristics I look for in a good English Pale Ale."
"hop at all. No aftertaste. This is a premium beer?"
"Due to its well-priced nature, it's extremely popular and something I'll continue to buy despite far superior imports."
"The body is remarkably light. There is little to no mouth coat. Carbonation is low to moderate"
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle. The beer poured a very hazy dark yellow, with a 1/4 inch head, that quickly faded, but left decent lacing on the glass. Slightly sweet aroma, but not as strong as most pale ales. Mouthfeel is about average for the style. Taste is very weak for a pale ale, resembling more of a light lager, than the style it is being passed as. An easy enough beer to drink, but if you're looking for the characters of a pale ale , I would recommend looking elsewhere."
"This one fills the glass with a hazy yellow liquid (bottle conditioned?) with tiny yeast particles floating. Head is short lived, and bleached white. Aromas are mildly yeasty and bready, and mild mannered hops that are well behaved. FLavours are funky yeast with some semi-sweet bready malts/cookie, and subtle soft hops (like fuggels?). Finishes quick, and fairly spritzy. Session style."
"Kind of a weird pale ale as it has low hops but a nice citrus finish that almost suggest Belgian in its softness. I like this beer though it doesn't fit the type. Like the other Cooper's I have tried, the sublte nuances are the best part of the beer. You have to slow down to really enjoy the light mix of flavours."
"D: I am only drinking it to review it. Sad really. I will never buy it again, and I was so excited when I did buy it because I have worked at Outback as a side job through college all my life. Australian beer you know? What a let down..."
"Cheers!"
"Other comments: All in all, a bit disappointing. I like thier Sparkling Ale, but this is like a club soda with a dash of pale ale. Had to dump in the yeast dregs to get a bit of flavor."
"M&D: if one was to taste Coopers for the first time, the texture of this beer could be overly spritzy, but since I've luckily tried some of their beers, I guess I could try to appreciate it from a slightly objective perspective. This bottle shows a more lively (yet still thin) body throughout than my last bottle, maybe due to younger bottling yeasts. I wouldn't say I'd love this beer as of its own category, but for what it is and the brewery's consistent efforts to make good ales, one has to try this beer to form his/her own fair judgement. A different, yeasty and dry-ish pale ale this is."
"This on is intersting for sure, but not very good. I don't really think I'll ever drink another one. The carbonation is the only thing making this even slighty drinkable. I'm gonna hurry and get this one down before it gets warm and goes flat....I have a feeling that it will be pretty disgusting if I let that happen."
"Pale yellow cloudy color. Thin bone white head. Smell - nothing, maybe a little bit of malt. Taste - very thin. Mouthfeel - watery. Drinkability - i guess it's a little better than water. There is nothing really bad about this brew it's just very bland, which is the only reason it scored as high as it did. To get 1's there has to be something really wrong and I can't say I noticed anything wrong with this one, can't really say I noticed anything at all."
"Drinkable, but not exceptional. Really, it resembles more of a continental pils--or maybe a slightly bitter helles--than a pale ale."
"On drinking it, I noted that it had an almost cordial quality to it, not really nasty, but unimpressive. A watery brew it be, with a seltzer like feel to it at first, before it goes flat due to lack of attention. Maybe the bottle suffered in transit, so to be fair, I'll review another bottle some day, but not in the near future."
"This beer is a lighter shade of yellow with a very thin head. There is a ton of suspended matter. The smell is strong. The taste is of a lighter beer with some hops thrown in. I guess this beer could be sessioned but there are better choices for that. Average for a session beer. Nothing outstanding. This beer is better cold."
"Overall it's not a bad beer, but I don't know if I will revisit again."
"12 oz. bottle. Poured a cloudy, golden yellow, with a the residue of fermentation suspended in the bottle. Very little head or lacing, which kept this score from going higher. Started out slightly bitter, but settled in around mid-bottle, to a nice smooth tasty beer with a good finish. Not quite qwhat I expected from a Pale Ale, almost more like a Weiss at the end, but at on 4.5% abv, I could, and probably will, drink several on a hot day this summer."
"Drinks easy, just not much character there for a bottle conditioned beer. I remember this being slighlty better in OZ. Worth a shot, especially as a summer time change of pace"
"Pours a hazy pale straw yellow color. Aroma is quite piney topped off with a citrus zest. The taste is wonderfully hopped and flavorful. All citrus hops up front, with some kind of yeasty malty something in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is great and drinkability is nice too. This beer is fluent in the citrusy piney hop bigness that I feel is too minimally done in the other english pale ale's I've tried. This is a good beer here, I'll empty my glass with satisfaction."
"Upon opening of the 12.7-ounce brown bottle, the beer pours a hazy light lemon yellow with a smallish white frothy head that dissipates quickly, leaving a rather thin coating of lace upon the glass. Nose has the rich aroma of malt, citrus like in its crispness; start is lightly sweet with a fair to middling grain presence, and the top feels moderate to my palate. Finish is stingingly acidic, the hops pleasantly spicy, and the aftertaste quite dry, bought a six pack of this brew along with a sixer of the Sparkling Ale, supposed to hit 109 by the end of the week, need a clean refreshing beer to fend of the heat! lol"
"Pours a cloudy straw color, not unlike cloudy apple juice. Probably would have poured clearer, but I rolled the bottle like the website tells me to do. Wouldn't want to review it under unfavorable circumstances. Smells faintly of yeast, and a little citrus. Taste is fairly yeasty and a little sweet, not much in the way of malt flavor. Not unpleasant, but not great either. Finishes a little sour. Mouthfeel isn't too bad, not creamy, but no carbonation burn either. All in all, it's a fairly average beer. Wish I could say it was better because I really like Coopers' other beers."
"No how, no way is Cooper's Original Pale Ale an English Pale Ale. I think these guys should release Cooper's New-and-Improved Pale Ale because this one doesn't cut it, not by a long shot. I've now had two good to excellent beers from this 'down under' brewery (Best Extra Stout and Extra Strong Vintage Ale) and two lousy ones (Sparkling Ale and this one). Maybe it's time to re-name Coopers Brewery Limited the Jekyl and Hyde Brewing Company."
"Opinion: This is an OK beer. There really isn't anything to set it apart from a bunch of other beers like it. There is a bit of graininess to this brew that you don't get with others, but I wouldn't say that it is a good thing in this case. It is not bad, and is definitely a drinkable brew, but with the amount of sediment on the bottom it is a shame to loose an ounce or two on every beer for one that is just ""OK"". If it was fresh and cheap, I may feel a little differently about this beer. Perhaps I need to take a trip to Australia?"
"Honestly, this is not a bad beer but it isnt very flavorful either. Im not going to spend extra cash on an import beer that is so lame. I am very happy to see unfiltered and bottle conditioned beers like this. Maybe my sample is off but the best by date is 08.02.07. Its fresh, right? I purchased my bottle in Lawrence, KS but I can buy it in Council Bluffs, IA if I was so inclined. Im not. Skip it."
"Cloudy yellow color and a thin white lace for a head. The aroma is light. Has a zesty lemon hint. Some grains back up the the herbal hop. Has a clean a crisp mouthfeel. Hints of pale malts and zesty citrus hop. Some yeast and grains can be found. Finishes clean and dry. Not really what I expected out of a pale ale. Ok but not really big on flavor."
"Best buy date of 08)-07, a bottle conditioned pale ale with a neat bottle, a stubby little bottom. Poured some sediment in, left some in the bottle. A nice hazy, but pale, golden color with fizzy bubbly head, with lacing at a minimum. Nose has a little straw, a twinge of lemon, and I think I'm starting to get this whole 'bready' thing, as I'm picking some up here. Taste is a good balance of all things going into a beer. The mouth made a good first impression, good carbonation and body. Lemon citris hops, slightly herbal i suppose, balanced out by nutty, somewhat grainy malts, and I can't pick up much of that yeastiness I poured. Finishes smooth and crisp. Overall, a pretty decent beer, nothing too extraordinary, but a very good session beer, something appropriate for pretty much any time, any where."
"The mouth feel is light bodied and a bit over carbonated."
"I liked this beer. It would make a good session beer for me. Not a lot to it, but very drinkable."
"This beer pours a golden color with a thick head that dissipated quickly from a 1 pint 9.4 ounce brown bottle. The aroma seems very faint, I can barely smell anything at all. I have to say the same thing about the taste, it's quite light, maybe a hint of lemon. I'm sure I could pound back quite a few of these, but I'm not sure why I would want to. Better than a macro lager (I know, this is an ale), but not anything to get excited about."
"Note: The beer is marked best before 21-09-07 which leads me to believe two tings. One, that it is not very old (since there is a lot of shelf life ahead) so unless the shipping was traumatic, my bottle should be pretty much what it is supposed to taste like. Two, Coopers thinks their beers (even bottled conditioned ones) keep longer than they probably do."
"for years, I've always walked past Coopers. Maybe its because every other sample of brew I've tried from Australia I've been dissapointed. Lets just say I learned my lesson on being biased against all offerings as this one breaks the mold and breaks my bias. Solid offering and I""m looking forward to sampling all of their products."
"The taste is also mild biscuity, yeasty, slightly sweet with just a hint of caramel. Finishes somewhat dry and carbonic with just a hint of hops. Taste is slightly thin and flat but still smooth, easy to drink and refreshing for a hot summer day. Some rusty looking sediment in the bottom.."
"12.7 ounce bottle. Coopers pale ale pours out a hazy orange color with lots of white floaties. The small head quickly fades to nothing. Weak grain aroma. There's not that much going on in the nose. Smooth, buttery malt flavor. Hops are more bitter than flavorful. Nice balance. A little bit fruity. Bottle conditioning gives this beer some character, but other than that, this is just an average pale ale. Pretty good drinkability too."
"Drinkability/Overall: I could knock these back all day. Refreshing in the mouth and goes down smooth. Ive had this beer for ever since I started drinking and it has always been a fave. This one was particularly nice."
"Not much of a head or lacing on this one. Bright yellow in color but cloudy with lots of little bubbles streaming to the top. A little bit of sediment in the glass, but I tried to keep most of it in the bottle. Smells like a lager to me, mostly sweet malts. Tastes like a lager too, but not bad with pale malts coming through. Mouthfeel is light, dry and smooth which makes it very easy to drink, but not real big in the flavor department."
"""It's not such a bad beer, Charlie Brown."" For the distance this beer must travel, and the low abv, I thought this beer fared surprisingly well. Poured an amber-tinged gold. Lively carbonation. Some tiny brown flecks of sediment that can be avoided with careful decant. Overall, the character was quite bright, with some Bavarian lager-like influences. A bit fizzy and light. Not a bad session beer."
"Overall: I preferred the Sparkling Ale that I tried last night, but this is another very nice flavorful brew from the Coopers Brewery. Real Aussie Ale  Brewed in Australia so says the neck label. Heres to listening the 2nd Day of the 5th and Final Test of the 2005 Ashes from the Oval on the BBC World Service in a few hours time. Gud on ya mate"
"A cloudy ale, similar in looks to a wheat beer with a bright white head that likes to stick to the side of the glass. Not a whole lot of smell. Faint hops and a sweet malt smell. Not nearly the citrus smell as its Sparkling Ale brother. Taste is nice and crisp. Nothing at all offensive about this beer, but it wont knock your socks off, either. A good summer session brew."
"Overall, I hope that this beer was not a true representative for this brew. Maybe it was spoiled, but I won't be in a hurry to try another one."
"Label 7/10"
"Not that much of an head and golden beercolor. Big particles floating in it. Nose is making shure this one is filled with lots of oxigen. Sweet hint of orange with it, some malts detectable. Taste is almost horrible; completely oxidated taste and no bitterness anymore, watery creamy sauce to me that was a poorout after just some tiny sips. Hopefully it's not always as bad as this bottle I tried but off course it came a long way.."
"A little too pale for a pale ale. Looks murky yellow, much like a wheat beer. Moderate carbonation. White dense head with nice retention. Smells a little malty and a little fruity, like you would expect from a wheat beer. Quite sour smelling for a pale ale. Faint hop aroma. Tastes fruity, like citrus lemons and oranges. Faint hop flavor and souring. Low hop bittering. Beer gets weak through the body and finish. Bitter grainy mouthfeel. A bit too acidic and metalic. Thin and remains a bit sour. Some vegetable like and earthy. Not a particularly good pale ale, but glad I tried it. Tastes like a failed attempt of an American Blonde."
"Note: If you empty the entire bottle int a glass you will get a cloudy beer."
"This beer sits right around average. I like the bottle conditioned character but question the hops in this brew. There seems to be no aromatic hops whatsoever, leaving the smell very dull. The taste is a bit bitter but the yeasty character is overwhelming with this absence. The mouthfeel is not too bad, but some floaties seem to tingle in my mouth. Drinkability is average. I would choose this beer over some, but not many."
"Good one."
"Drink the sparkling ale instead."
"Overall- not a bad beer, not something good either. A definite out of the Aussie Macro's and if I can find it cheap enough an excellent chugging, or Beirut beer!"
"It is not a good beer to follow on from big beers, unless you are suffering from palate fatigue and need a refresher. It is, however, a good beer to choose from the tap when you are limited in your other choices. Hold it up to other mainstream australian tap beers and it an excellent session beer."
"A pretty crappy and bland ale, similar to the sparkling ale, but this is actually worse...., time to crack the goudenband and get some flavour on these taste buds"
"Pours golden with a rapidly dissipating white head; a little cloudy from the yeast in the bottle. Has a light aroma of grass and citrus. A little more on the taste with the slightest bannna as well. Nice crisp taste with a mild bitterness that's just a little more than other Aussie beers I've had. Full, slick mouthfeel and easy drinking, but I did have a slight headache the next day (likely more quantity related)"
"Drinkability & Notes: A decent pale, thankfully this is unfiltered and bottle conditioned and was able to retain a good amount of character. Not as good as the Sparkling Ale but something Id definitely have again."
"While this is not one of my particular favourites (and I do consider the Coopers like a little overrated here in Oz), it's a drinkable, hell, even enjoyable beer."
"taste was slightly hoppy, little citrus in there and it was quitye thin. Actually reminded alot of Fosters only with a slightly hoppy bite to it."
"Pours a two-finger white head that goes quickly leaving nothing. Cloudy amber color with a lot of chunky bits. Medium carbonation and light bodied. Nose is faintly hoppy. Starts with a light mix of hops and malts with the hops dominating, hoppy finish but not a lot of flavor. $1.80 for a 375ml bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, MA. Best by 11/28/05."
"I didn't realize this was bottle conditioned until I accidentally poured the whole bottle into my pint glass, turning the beer into a snow-globe. Straw yellow in color with a light white head that quickly fizzles off. Zero lace. Smell is mild, bready and sweet/sour. Flavor is light, way too light. Slight bready malts upfront with a faint dose of hops. Light buttery green apple flavor, lemony, and grassy. Simply too mild for me to enjoy. Extreme carbonation and light watery body. Some may find this appealing, but it is not for me."
"A stand up pale ale. Give it a try."
"12.7 ounce bottle. Best before 23.03.05. Easy drinking yet boring beer...YAWN..."
"The beer pours a cloudy pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that quickly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a pale malt scent along with a slightly fruity English yeast finish. t seems a bit bitter and bisquity. The taste is average. It has a pale malt flavor with a slight zing in the aftertaste. It is light and a bit watery. I don't detect much in the hop department. It is dry and musty. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is an average pale ale at best. It just doesn't have much flavor and what little it has sucks. It's one and done for me."
"The taste is that of a light bitter with the late introduction of a sweet biscuit that tones down the bitterness but ever so lightly."
" Would have been much better with more carbonation"
"Very smooth drinking. Unfortunately, the bar would not give me a glass (they did not have any). The carbonation was very weak. Sweet hops with a backnote of what made me think of vanilla. The sweet hops came with the finish, they were ever-so-slightly bitter at first, but quickly became sweet."
"Good drinkability, would be a good beer for potential crossovers."
"Poured from a 12.7 oz (whoo-hoo, an extra .7 oz.!) bottle, it's vibrant gold with lots of floating yeasty bits. The yeast settles at the bottom, with a reddish tint that makes it look a bit like a pile of rust. The smell and taste are lightly fruity with hops that are just detectable. Nothing spectacular, but a nice flavor. It went down well over a hot barbecue on a scorching mid-summer afternoon."
"This beer is a clear, rich gold with hallucinations of amber. A cloudy last pour turns it an opaque orangey-gold and adds dark floaties. Head is medium-sized, off-white, bubbly, fizzy. There's a touch of spoonk in the nose, with some grains, some sugar and a little citrus. Fresh! in the front: a little nutty and quite bitter. The middle turns sweet, tingly, quenching but thin. Finish is very dry, bitter, fresh. This is a good, bitter/dry beer. It gets a little fruitier and less bitter with temperature: more pale aley. Nice."
"Cloudy appearance with very little head. Smell was oddly wheaty. Taste was wheaty but nothing spectacular. Mouthfeel was medium bodied with a bit of carbonation that was somewhat pleasant. Drinkability was not too bad. This reminded me of a wheat beer rather than a pale ale. Wouldn't be too bad on a hot day, although under other circumstances, I would not rush out to buy it."
"Altogether a decent looking beer, with a nice smell to it, but the appearance is below average. Head dissipated very quickly. Smell seemed citrusy, sweet. Taste is OK, kind of thick, yeasty taste at first, leaves a funky gym sock aftertaste. I am not a big fan of this beer."
"Overall, I've had worse but thought this would be better."
"pretty basic, easy drinking pale. still, a much better alternative to the usuall draught offerings around."
"Drinkability  I was able to finish this one, but it was very unpleasant and I will definitely not buy again."
"Onto the 2nd Beer of the World...This immediately reminded me of apple cider in appearance, cloudy with a lot of sediment. No head to speak of. Nice citrusy smell and citrusy hop finish but the taste is definitely lacking a lot. The mouthfeel is very thin, nothing that holds my interest. I would drink this beer if offered to me but would definitely not buy it."
"A lightly hazy gold color. It forms a white head when roused in my glass. A weak beery aroma emanates from my glass, a bit of spicy hop notes as well. Fairly mild tasting, it ends with a bit of carbonic acid bite. Slightly bready, and a tad too thin. Really not much here, not offensive, but nothing worth drinking either."
"Sampled 10/3/03"
"il go for the sparkling ale any day of the week, but occasionally if im looking at a long night and i want a nice intro to a big night of drinking, this is a fair place to start. its not hard to drink a worse beer in australia than this one. while its not a huse beer, its quite tasty, and stacks up well compared to a lot of other beers i could be drinking locally."
"This poured strangely, a hazy yellow color, thin head, and large chunks of sediment. I did not expect this. The small head quickly disappeared. The aroma was weak, barely a hint of hops was present. The mouthfeel was smooth and medium bodied. The malt flavor was most prevelent, with some hints of fruit. Slight bitterness came through on the aftertaste. Drinkable but not overly exciting."
"Coopers Original Pale Ale: from Australia. I am immediately struck by how cloudy this beer is. Does not spill out a lot of head. The color is yellow with a deep orange tint. The aroma is somewhat cidery. Hmm, this beer does not quite want to leave an impression on me, a bare wisp of malt sweetness, and it quickly disappears. There are some fruit/citrus flavors here, but little aftertaste of hops, in fact not much taste at all. Fairly smooth mouthfeel, which just helps it leave the palate that much more quickly. I guess youd call this a session beer, because there isnt much to it."
"Appearance: Cloudy golden orange tint with a nice creamy textured white head, no lacing forms on this one. Aroma: A slight citrus note here a bit zesty with deep bready malt tones heavy sediment as well adds to the breadiness I speak of. Taste: A mild biscuit sweetness with some balancing light hops main component here is the yeast and malt tones providing for a bready finish and overall profile in the flavor. Mouthfeel: Somewhat of a residual texture that coats the tongue not bad at all very nice crisp tone brought on by the medium body and mild carbonation. Drinkability: Not crazy but solid ale from Austrailia just glad to see another brand other than Foster's on American shores."
"Another good Cooper's beer. Probably a bit less than the Sparkling Ale, but I don't think the gap is that great. I'll probably definitely have this one again."
"Overall a good simple ale."
"Had a friend who drank this alot on tap in Australia during a recent trip. We finally located the beer here in Chicago, and he claims it tastes pretty much the same as in Aust. The beer pours a slightly hazy pale golden with a bit of sediment if you look close. This is what I call a slammer beer. Not overly memorable, but real easy to drink. I'd be happy to shoot some pool and suck a few of these down in a dark Aussie pub. The nose is rather malty and hints of sweet corn. The taste also is a bit malty/corny with just a faint bit of cloying fruitiness and not much in the way of hops. My only fear is that in a lot of brews that I encounter this malty/corny character I find that it means adjunct/filler and hence-headache. I call it the PBR syndrome. Never drink more than three in a sitting! I don't think I'll drink more that two or three of these at time to play it safe. Not a bad little slammer though all in all."
"Pours a hazy light gold color with a medium off-white head. Aroma is a little citrusy and a little hoppy, but neither is very assertive. Thin- to medium-bodied, with flavors of hops, wheat and fruit. Finish is a little flat and fruity. I enjoyed their Stout but this beer leaves a lot to be desired."
"Pours a murky light golden color with a medium-sized white head and lively carbonation. Flakes of sediment rise and fall in the streams of carbonation, rendering the appearance of a snow globe. The lacing is quite good. Aroma consists of bready yeast and citrus hops. Taste begins with lively carbonation, light malts, and lemony hops. The hops dominate the taste towards the dry finish, leaving in their wake a crisp citrus oil bitterness. The mouth feel is creamy and pleasant. A refreshing warm weather beer."
"Pours a hazy golden color with tiny yet noticeable flakes of sediment floating in the beer. The head is creamy white and fades into a good amount of lace. Nose is sourdough bread and a bit of citrusy hops. Taste starts off with sweet malts and a mild fruitiness followed by some nutty yeast flavors. Some bitter hops and acidic lemon notes come through in the end leaving a crisp finish. A pretty nice pale ale but nothing special."
"Overall a fairly average Aussie pale ale. Great potential that never seems to go anywhere. Nice visually with good aroma but no balance in the taste and a watery mouthfeel; IMO."
"Kinda liked this one,the guy at the beer store said the bottle was sitting there for awhile but it held up great.Real hazy-orange color with a good head,smelled fresh and citriusy,body was a little thin to me for the style.Refreshing taste with some citrius-yeast note very easy to drink.I also think this would be a good warm weather ale."
"I don't know that this beer is a pale ale or a lager. O.K. the label says pale ale but... A very cloudy pale gold topped by a nice sugar white head, lacing was solid and offset the rather strange color and appearance. Fresh lager like aroma was standard. Taste was pretty standard too but had a bit of lemony zest to it and actually was quite refreshing. I think this would be a good warm weather quaffer. This sample came out of a Beers Of The World gift box. I have never seen this brew anywhere before now."
"Hazy orange color, under a small white head. Aroma is fresh and fruity, notes of peach apricot, some citrus. Mellow mouthfeel, decent showing of hops, but very minimal bitterness, and a lackluster finish. Pleasant and sweet, but nothing really sticks out. A fine session ale, if you don't mind unassuming, easy-going flavor in your mug."
"Extremely light, hazy straw color. Fine, suspended yeast particles are visible from bottle conditioning. Nose is fruity with granny smith apples, bosc pear notes. Odd, very nontraditional English pale. Actually reminds me more of a wheat beer with similarities to a Belgian wit. Interesting brew and very drinkable too."
"The cloudiness is part of the character and charm of this bottle conditioned beer. It's golden/peach in color with a bold, rocky, bright-white head that holds extremely well (as it's constantly buoyed by an intense effervescence) and leaves some excellent lace. The aroma is fruity and lightly malty. The body is light-medium, and when combined with the very fine & effervescent carbonation - as well as it's light acidity - the mouthfeel is quite crisp. The flavor offers the standard Cooper's yeast character with lots of fruitiness (apples, pears, apricot, mild banana) and a good deal of hop bitterness. There's a light acidity and a minor hop flavor from Pride of Ringwood. It finishes dry with just a minimal, lingering yeastiness. Very nice. Quite similar to their Sparkling Ale but with far less character."
"Cloudy gold with a large foamy head.  Head had very good retention, and eventually became a fine lace which left rings all the way down the glass.  The appearance aside, this is not a very good beer.  Smell had very faint malt and hop presence, with nothing else really going on.  Slightly malty taste, with a slightly acidic bite.  Not at all complex, and not what I would call an English Pale Ale."
"Coopers Pale poured a hazy golden color with substantial head, which left some decent lace in the glass, not to mention some yeast. There weren't any particular smells that popped out at me. Taste-wise, this beer was relatively dull. There was a hint of hops and some malt profile, but not enough of either. The mouthfeel was a bit too grainy and dry for this style. This is average beer."
"Hazy dark straw in hue, topped by a quickly dissapating head. Flecks of yeast ride the released carbonation... Similar in appearance to the Sparkling Ale, but a touch more hazy and lighter in color.  The aroma consists of tart fruity esters and mild caramel malt sweetness, but there's not much else there. The hop nose is a touch citric, and a woody and earthy (Pride of Ringwood?) hop flavor is discernable.  The malt profile of this brew is subdued and light, and much of its character is provided by the signature fruity yeast esters. Only a light sweetness and bready note is perceptible in the finish. The high carbonation lends an almost prickly mouthfeel, but the overall crisp and light nature of this brew lends it good drinkability.  Cooper's Pale exhibits no outstanding qualities, but is flavorful enough to make it a very drinkable session brew."
"Hazy yellow (quite light), dark yeasty chunks in the bottle-conditioned style.  Decent body in the head.  Tangy aroma.  Flavor has decent hop/malt balance, mostly a mild flowery hop impression in mid mouth, but far from overpowering.  OK beer in most aspects, not complex but with subdued impressions of both malts and hops in the British style.  A little chalkiness in the mouth, though."
"A good beer, but i guess its not my style, kind of reminded me of Bass, but a mile better, very drinkable in summer, refreshing and slightly fruity."
