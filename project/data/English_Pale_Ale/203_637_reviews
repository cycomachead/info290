"I have had this beer only in a tin can. It's either been absolutely horrible, or phenomenal. Worth a second taste if you have had a bad experience from years ago."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not my thing.  A bit creamy"
""
""
""
"Nitro can pours amber with perfect nitro foam. Smells of bread, biscuit, and cooked sugar. Flavors are the same in this highly drinkable brew, a staple. If not the most interesting, certainly reliable and enjoyable en masse."
"A bit disappointed with this beer. Had a decent color but lacked any strong scent. Hint of a bitter caramel. Tasted watered down. Pretty dull and disappointing but there is worse out there."
""
""
""
""
"I am neutral on this beer."
""
""
"This beer is a solid English pale ale. Delicious. Not earth shattering, but completely solid."
""
""
""
""
""
"An exceptional beer that looks and tastes outstanding."
"Nose malt, caramel, biscuit, faint hay, slight metallic & citrus. Taste malt, hops, slight honey, nuttiness, & herbal, toast, earthy."
""
""
""
"Very fine out of draught and fine in bottle."
""
"For me was okay but nothing special"
""
""

"This was an average brew at best."
"Pretty much the pinnacle of an amber/copper color, typical of ESBs/English pale ales. One finger of head ,even after a vigorous pour, suggests low carbonation typical of imitation cask ale; head stuck around throughout the experience, however. On the nose I get mostly caramel malts, a touch of bready malts and yeast, some fruit esters, and perhaps a touch of English hops, just to tie everything together. On the palate i get a rich , yet balanced and not overly dense, caramel flavor, coupled with some slight fruity esters. Toffee and a touch of butterscotch are also there. Bitterness is well managed and makes the beer very quaffable. This could be easy to drink many of. I personally found it subtle, yet refreshing. It embodies many of the qualities that make a good bitter, yet in a more subtle, drinker friendly manner"
""
"I wasn't expecting much and what I got was slightly more than that. Nice on the front end but the after taste was reminiscent of a run-of-the mill brew."
""
"Smelled like a dead skunk on the road and didn't taste much better"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Had one a few years back and enjoyed it, baught a case as it was on sale.  Think I got a bad batch the taste was quite savoury almost like a V8, very unexpected"

"Clear amber colour, samll not lasting head, minimal lace. Smell of sulphurs, toffee. Light body, soft carbonation. Taste of toffee and malts."
"Overall: quite a nice traditional English Pale Ale - driven by sweet malts, and definitely something one doesn't put away too quickly. I found it a bit cloying if I tried to down it - better to just read the paper, chat to the barman and enjoy it over a decent session. By the time it gets to us in Aus it is usually expensive at AU$83 a case, but I'll take a 6-pack every now and then."

"The Old Speckled Hen is a caramel colored ale with a  thin head and very light lacing and low to medium carbonation. I found this beer to be very hoppy and bitter with a mediciny aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall (4):  Solid beer.  I am going to purchase another one next time I'm at the beer store."
""
""
""
""
""
"Drink this everyweek. Best home beer in a bottle you could want. Not a big fan of chilled beer but a cool 'specklage' hits the spot. Love this beer. If you have not tried it please do."
"Nice English Ale, smooth and easy to drink... Doesn't have an overwhelming taste either way. Makes a great session ale with nice malt presence~"
""
""
""
"I tell you what, wrong I was.  That's a really smooth and wide pale ale, with strong taste and smell of grassy hops and a fantastic, bitter, aftertaste. Low carbonation like from a cask, it's a real pleasure to drink."
""
"Good from a bottle, surprisingly pours out like a draft out of a can, smoooooth premium beer."
"Just saw that this is the same brewery that makes Innis & Gunn Oak Aged. Both are bottled in clear bottles. I was warned long ago about beer that is not protected from the light. Never had a reason to come down on one side or the other on this point. What I do know is this brew needs a little sumpin' sumpin'. Gnome sayin'?"

"Reviewing from a distant memory, but this one always stuck out in my head as being dominated by toasted, lightly sweet malt that reminded me of caramel corn, accompanied by floral hops."
""
""
"Again I do feel a bit bad about this review, and based on what others are saying here I wonder if I got a bad one or the bar hadn't cleaned their pipes in a while. Certainly I have had Speckled Hen before a long time ago and I don't remember it being that bad, so I feel there is a good chance something was up here. SO, I promise to give it another day in court back in the UK and see if it improves any, If it does I will re-post."

"such a different beer (and far superior) from the nitro tap than it is from the bottle. this is often thin and skunky in its clear glass, but its rich and frothy and malty in that nutty but not too sweet way from the nitro tap. the infusion of the nitro gas helps its feel too, creamy and puffy on the palate with a lasting white head and ring lacing as it sips down. plenty of bittering hops, characteristic more of an esb type than an english pale to me, but it sort of traverses style norms in a number of respects. i like the almost almond flavored malt on the front end, and that it stays pretty light throughout. enough hops to balance it, but remain drinkable. i know this one is a classic overseas that has been largely under appreciated by the north american crowd, but i think thats a little unfair, and that that the clear glass hasnt done it any favors. overall a beer that demands a time and a place, but when those to occur, its delicious."

"Poured from can. Strong aroma of caramel. Clear amber color with white head.   A light sweet taste.  Medium body, creamy texture, with average carbonation, and a very mild bitter finish.  Overall a very smooth brew that goes down easy."

"Would have again; worth trying.  (3.75)"

"At 5%, this is a little higher ABV than what I would call a good session beer.  But then again, I probably drink a little more than I should, so I'm likely to find myself drinking a few more of these until I find myself a good supplier of better micros."
""
"Solid brew overall.  Really drinkable and approachable.  Mellow body and slight cinnamon apple feel going on towards the end of the palate.  Apple feel is more on the green side.  One of the first beers that I really enjoyed when getting into craft beers nearly 15 years ago."

"Had from cask at the Iron Duke Pub in Victoiia Station, London. Had a bit of a sour taste from the cask. Don't remember that from a bottle. Love most cask ales but would pass on this one in the future - unless it was all hey had. We are in the UK and Ireland for 42-days are hitting 2 to 3 pubs per day."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 11/30/2013. Pours crystal clear reddish copper color with a 1 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, toast, brown bread, plum, apple, honey, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, yeast ester, and earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, toast, brown bread, plum, apple, nuttiness, light roast, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Light earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, brown bread, nuttiness, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and robustness of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Very clean in flavor as well. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth and fairly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with no warming present after the finish as expected of 5%. Overall this is a very nice English pale ale! All around good balance and robustness of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"An extra note (bitch) for you English exporters out there: What gives with the chincy, metric 440 ml can (a weird, odd size that doesn't correlate to anything except a ball park proximity to an American pint). GIVE US IMPERIAL PINTS!! If these cans were a wee bit bigger, they would fly off the shelves and we wouldn't feel like you were trying to pull a fast one on us (Perfidius Albion!)."

"D: very drinkable - at 5.0 id say it's a true session beer."
""
""
""
""

"Taste / Palate: The flavor has a nice bready maltiness up front along with some mild caramel and toffee sweetness. Hop flavor comes in quickly and adds some dryness and mellow bitterness to the finish."

"A very nice beer."

"from a mixed six from Uncle Mike."
"I like it. I'm not sure it is worth what I sometimes see it priced at, but it is very good. I will buy it again if it is on sale."
"Mouthfeel is really light; the end is dry, really nice."
""
""
"I may try another and update this, as it's dissapointing, it's a big brewery, and usually consistent. Green king IPA is a good choice if no other ale is available, even if it's not that exciting."

"O: ""Owld Speckled Un"" is probably my first true example of this style. It has so much more flavor and character than I expected. Very sessionable. I enjoyed it but won't seek it out again anytime soon."

"O. Not enjoying the hop profile on this very much. Has a bit of a syrupy taste to it."
""
""
""
""
"Perhaps I have not had one in a while or am just remembering how good it tasted on tap in England, but I guess I am in the minority on this one. I have always thought it to be a fine English pale/bitter with such a lovely aroma. The creamy, buttery body and malt-hop balance always impressed me. On some level, I do object to so many English ales being overlooked in the U.S. That may be due to lack of freshness, but with some of the sturdier, higher alcohol level bitters, that should not be as much of an issue. Perhaps English pales and bitters are just not en vogue right now like IPA's and strong stouts."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste: strong wheat bread overtones followed by smooth and creamy malts fading into a spicy hop finish. It is like a liquid loaf of bread!"
"Overall: a wonderful example of an English Pale Ale. Hits all of the points I expect an EPA to hit."
""
"O: Well, it's a nitro-can beer, ergo it wasn't going to be plagued by the skunk you get from clear bottles. That, and it's drop dead gorgeous look, is about where my praise ends. There's nothing BAD about it...there's just not much good about it, either. It's really telling that this is far less drinkable than the 8.7% DIPA I had right before this."
""
"This certainly felt stronger than it was in actuality and had I bought another one of these, I could have easily downed it after finishing this off. There wasn't a lot of body to the malt here and because this was so light, it wasn't heavy or even as bitter as other English beers that I've rated highly in the past. This is a no-frills Ale that's a good example of the style but at the same time, needed something to go along with it as a snack. Perhaps some fish and chips?"
"Overall: a good pale with Classic British malt character and a nice ""noble"" hop balance. At 5.2 this beer approaches being sessionable. The draught on nitro added to the drinkability."
""
"Poured out a nice clear amber with a thick creamy off-white head. The head has great retention and leaves some nice lacing. The aroma is pretty mild, with slight hints of dark fruit and bread. The taste comes through, though, with more developed flavors similar to the aroma with a nice earthy hops character in addition. It's not a huge flavor, but it works well. The body is a little lighter, but mirrors the flavor profile. It's not the most outstanding English Pale, but a good one all the same."

"it feels flat to me but tastes great. something to continue experimenting with ..."
""

"Overall: This is one of my favorite session beers, especially on tap. I love the malty, toffee flavor and the smooth finish."

"Overall - A similar expieriance to Guinness on nitro tap. Unlike Guinness, however, this beer is a little lacking in character. There is nothing wrong with this beer (aside from the unique aroma). The mouthfeel is cool and it sure is pretty to look at. The taste, however, is underwhelming."
""
"A promising ale let down by the draught can format. Except for some visual flair, it just doesn't work for pale ales."
""
"Usually though, I agree that this is a reasonably solid standby, on draft at least. I remember liking it best the first time I had it, for its hearty bready malt. Really like a freshly baked loaf of whole-grain bread in refreshing liquid form. Since then I have liked it a little less each time but still regard it as a good first beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear ruby amber with a medium slowly fading beige head. Aroma and Taste of toasted cereal, malt, yeast, slightly fruity with a bit of toffee flavor. A medium body, smooth with good carbonation on the palate. The finish is toasted caramel malt, light fruity and yeast notes ending with some sweet toffee and nutty flavors. Overall a good, refreshing session brew"

"O: Still a good staple ale."

"Gorgeous summertime ale. Enjoyed poured from bottle on a beach in perfect sunshine! bright golden amber colour, clear as the sky I drank it under with a single centimeter of cloudlike head resting and holding for some time. Scent perhaps obscured by the saltiness of the sea but caught pleasant wiffs of apricot and berrys. distict peachy taste with slight hop bittering just like so many of the ales I like the most. 5.2% but didn't realise until part way through the fourth bottle!! Aha!"
""
""
""
"o: Somewhat similar to the Old Golden Hen already reviewed in its refreshing fruitiness, but OSH is lighter and with more of a distinct peach-like tinge. It was great as a dinner ale, and continued to delight as it was finished afterwards. Perhaps ironic that the entree was...chicken. Surely a fine choice in warm weather."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"There's a touch of smoothness in this beer that isn't particularly crisp. Barely more than light in body, it does seem to be stretching for medium and just makes it."
""
"Malt driven, and there is a baseline of quality, but all toned down and a bit dull. A butter bomb when fresh on cask. A case study for Maris Otter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Kind of a niche beer. Very similar to Boddingtons, and definitely better."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium brown ale with a thin head that dissipates quickly. Aromas of nuts, caramel and wood. Flavors of mild spice and wood/leaves. Has a light, sessionable body and plenty of flavor. There was some mild skunk when the bottle was first opened but it became imperceptible after pouring. A great example of English ale."
""
""
"O: Would drink again if it was presented."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall it's what you'd expect from an English Pale Ale. Easy drinking with just enough bitterness, but not too much."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Nothing special here but I would drink this any day over anything in the BMC portfolio"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I would give this beer high 3s out of five. It's an excellent beer, but not what I would call world class. Would I seek this out. Probably not as I have built up a list of beers in this realm that I like better. I do like it though! Would I recommend this beer? HAYLE YES! Just as I would recommend trying any new beer just to try something different because you never know if this could be the one! There is the chance this could be it for you."
""
""
""
""
"An easy beer to drink for all occasions. Pairs well with almost any hearty food and can be enjoyed just as well on its own."
""
""
""
"Overall, a beer that is mild and drinkable and should accompany many dishes well (for you somaliers out there). I have been on something of a British Beer kick lately and will probably try several other new ones (new to me that is) before returning to this one."
""
""
""
""

""

"Food match: Old speckled roasted hen would go great with this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A nice, basic English ale. The mix of very traditional malt and hop flavors and the bigger-than-average body makes this an excellent readily available brew. It's not explosive, innovative, or exciting, but this is very tasty and very well-crafted for a mass-produced ale. Definitely worth checking out for fans of English ales and those curious about them."
""
""
"O: I would definitely have this beer again. It's a pleasant, easy-drinking beer."
""
""
""
"I'm on a Pale Ale trip right now. I tried this, Mirror Pond and Belhaven at the same time. This beer placed third behind Belhaven and Mirror Pond. I enjoyed it but like the other two better. It was third in flavor. Third in finish. If it were on sale I'm in."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It pours a nice, clear amber with a white head that fades fast. very little lacing. The smell is a little earthy. Notes of fig and molasses with a slight vegetative quality on the nose, with a little butterscotch as well. The taste is comparable to that of an oatmeal raisin cookie. There is also a slight underlying bitterness. The carbonation is delightfully light and it has a heavier mouthfeel than I was expecting."

"Nice amber color with a thick cream top a la nitro-can. Smells of light, sweet malts, some caramel, some milk, some tea and light grassy hops. Pleasant nose. Flavor carries plenty of amber malts, some tea, some slight wood character; overall not particularly complex, but quite well balanced. Full bodied with nitro carb and a forgettable finish. Overall, I find this can of beer pretty enjoyable."

"O: I bought this to use in a beer cheddar soup (naturally I drank some while I cooked). Definitely a beer you can drink with food. Not offensive, not super high alcohol, thin, and easy drinking. For a session beer, it gets the job done. Worked very well in the soup. Nothing spectcular here, like a good bar band. Fits in, makes things feel right, but never going to have a gold record."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This is just a simple, light pale ale. Pretty drinkable"
""

"Pours a clear orange with a foamy bone colored head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, caramel, and some slightly fruity aromas. Taste is much the same with a mild bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is drinkable but nothing too exciting."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I would have no problem sharing a couple of these with ""me mates"" (*receive 2 points for apropos British ref), although it wouldn't be my choice were it my turn to buy a round."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
"Well balance and very easy drinkable ale, the overall feeling is not too thin and not too bold with great mouthfeel by the way."

"Overall: Very good beer and looks beautiful in a glass but the sourness at the end of the sip becomes cloying towards the end of the glass. I imagine it would be great to pair this beer with steak. Definitely couldn't finish the four pack I have in a night or even probably a week, it has too much going on to be anything more than a sipper through the night."
""
""
""
"Overall - I enjoyed this beer, but it is almost too much like a india pale ale and not my daily drinker. This would good with a steak or a fine saucy meal"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not my favorite. A friend showed up with six of these. This is the first and maybe the last. She thought I would like it."
"Overall: A strange beer, but not without merit. I wasn't expecting such a firm ester profile."
""
"On hand pump at Teresa's. Dark amber with huge creamy pinkie width white head. Tons of lace here. Great head retention. Faint malts here in the nose, caramel stands out. Creamy feel, smooth caramel malts, good flavors and a bit understated in terms of flavor, but made up for in feel. Good drinking ale here, good stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- if drink ability were still a factor, it would get top marks in this category. Overall it's a very pleasant, simple beer that is best enjoyed while relaxing on the back patio outside, as I am doing right now."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: It's OK, nothing special. I have trouble getting past the smell, and I wish I knew what was in here that gave it that aroma. Tastes better than it smells."

"OVERALL: If this beer were a football team it would be at the bottom of the Championship. However, having drunk my first English ale for six months here in Korea it tastes sublime."
"*to be expected from a nitro can"
""
""
""
""
"Solid beer, this. Easy to drink, tasty enough."
""
""

"This is one of the better nitro canned version of an English Pale Ale out there. Not something I would keep in my fridge at all times, but still tasty!!"

"Overall - Disappointing beer overall, despite all I had heard about how great this was. It's easy to drink but it's about as watery as beer can get without being actually being considered water."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall Impression - Not too bad. I don't mind drinking it, but I'm in no hurry to buy another bottle."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I had low expectations due to the clear bottle, but it turned out to be slightly above average."
""
""
"O: Nice middle-of-the-road beer for the style. Good for a few."
""
""
""
"O - Decent light-bodied English brew. No hop characteristics to pick out. Not very complex. Decent mouth feel. Definitely sessionable."
""
"O: Super easy to drink and very refreshing with a light flavor and wonderful creaminess."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The color is like caramel with a foamy head that is soap looking. The head is made up of different bubbles size. The aroma is bitter and shows signs of hops and some caramel malts. On the taste, it is caramel malts with a dry finish with a light bitterness. Carbonation is present in the mouth. Medium to thin body. This is an good Pale Ale, however it is a bit pricy."
"Poured from a 14.9oz nitro can into a chilled pint glass. Beautiful coppery color with a creamy 1/2 head which remained after the initial foamy cascade. Minimal lacing. Very nice malty aroma with an equally nice creamy mouthfeel. Taste is malty with a minimal amount of hops. Hints of caramel also present. Overall a very drinkable, enjoyable English ale."

"O: Old Speckled Hen is definitely worth the (low) price I paid for it: it’s moderately full-bodied and complex enough to please. This mild British beer won’t overwhelm your palate with thick flavors, but hey – sometimes something mild and drinkable is just what you need."
""
"Poured from a nitro-tap into a tumbler pint, the beer has a foamy, bright, and lively cascade as the creamy smooth off-white head settles in on the top. It looks like buttercream frosting it is so smooth. The body of the beer is a bright, crystal clear, vibrant ruby-orange coloring. Aromas are rich and buttery toffee sweetness, with a slight tang and a biscuit backbone. Flavors are smooth and somewhat fruity, with berry and cherry highlights on a toffee and caramel malt backbone. The body is light, but velvety smooth, with a creamy feel overall to go along with the curtains of lacing left on the glass. Subtle roasting throughout, with a slick, tangy transition into a caramel sweet aftertaste. The finish is smooth and quick, with only a slight filmy linger left behind. Decent served this way, as I was never a huge fan from a bottle or can."

"D: A decent english pale ale, with a fairly smooth and velvety taste. Perhaps not the most flavourful but certainly sessionable."
""
"Thankfully vinegar was not the taste, old english style beer, absent hopping, sweet taste of alcohol to it, corny. As it warms, it gains an even greater alcohol mouthfeel. Wow, how do people like this is kind of my thinking, I'm usually pretty tolerant, but for some of the people who swear by this stuff, sheesh. Gets all musty on you."
"Nothing special. I still don't understand the point of injecting beer with nitrogen. A lighter, less flavorful beer is just not as good in my opinion."

"O: I'd say just above average. I didn't dislike it, but I thought it was underwhelming. Unique, biscuity flavor was enjoyable. While I can see why some people really like OSH, I probably wouldn't order it again."
""
"O- Standard English Pale Ale. It has all the classic aromas and flavors one would associate with a good EPA and is worth a try if you're in the mood for a flavorful, non citrus/pine, hop forward Pale Ale. Cheers."
""
"It's not a massive beer, in your face or otherwise, but it is a great example of style, and as such , the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. Simple beer, well done, top notch."
""
"O: Probably a decent session beer, comparable in quality to most popular English imports a la Newcastle. This beer could be a lot more interesting, then again it could be worse. You shouldn't really expect a beer named ""Old Speckled Hen"" to be some sort of refined English craft brew, anyway. For what it is, it is alright."
"Pours an amber color with a 1/2 in white head. Head is dense, due to the nitro-can, retention is great, as I drink it leaves concentric circles of lacing. Smell is sweet like caramel, I think I'm also getting some malt and dark fruit sort of scent. Taste starts with a overly clean sort of taste, maybe it's just a dry flavor. Then I get a touch of English malt and more of that dark fruit taste. Aftertaste is a touch bitter. Mouthfeel is thin. Not terribly impressed with this beer. Don't think i'll buy it again unless I am in England."

"O/D: Just one word: Yum! Excellent in all regards, this is much better than I recall from my previous samplings of this brew.

"Overall I really enjoy this beer. Probably one of my favorite EPA's."
"This beer came out a nice coppery red with that great lingering head that lasted the whole time of drinking. The head was creamy looking and texture and pure white and made up small bubbles. The smell was mildly acidic and kind of vinegary. The taste was also kind of vinegary with a little bit of hops (just a touch) and a little bit of maltiness as well. The main flavor profile was the acidity. The mouthfeel was so smooth and creamy, it felt really great on the palate. Overall this beer is lacking in the flavor profile. There just isn't much of it there and the the taste that is there isn't an exceptionally good one."

"O: I will avoid this in the future. The consistency is what really killed this drink for me. In all reality the reason I picked this up was just because it was a nitro-can and this was obviously a bad way to pick a beer. If you enjoy a watery beer then you might enjoy this, but this is not for me."
"Overall - A beer that is very easy to drink but at the same time quite boring. For the price there are many other beers I would rather be having."
"O: Tasty and drinkable, but not a stand-out. A good, safe-bet for everyday drinking, either alone for quenching thirst or with mild-flavored foods (fish and chips comes to mind as a good pairing for this English pale ale)."
"Check it off the list, and on to the next one. Won't have again for awhile."
"Appearance is clear with a slight amber tint. Smell is typical euro ale aroma. Mouthfeel is ok and the good thing is it does not linger. The taste is that of a pale ale and it does have that euro taste. For us americanized tasters it is not what we desire, some may prefer. Overall this is a drinkable beer, not one we will seek out."
"It has a mild pleasant odor and fairly mild taste of hops. It is not especially bitter. I was glad the restaurant had something to offer, but this was a bland choice."
"QUITE NICE, NOT MUST HAVE!"
"overall: very boring beer, the color of the beer was what drew me too it, but it just fell flat. just a bland British beer."
"O: All fur coat and no trousers, a decent pint, nicely balanced just not a huge fan of the balanced flavors"
"O: This is a nutty and very clean beer. Much better than I anticipated."
"O - A tasty English Pale Ale and not too shabby for a mass produced ale. I could easily drink this stuff all night long."
"Final Grade: 3.62, a B."
"Fresh bottle sampled in April 2014 produced a higher taste rating (3.75) but a lesser mouthfeel and appearance."
"Pours a nice dark amber with decent head, little retention but leaves a nice lace. The nose is warm, malty and inviting. A little bitter has a malty fruity flavor with a biting finish. Light and smooth on the palate. Overall its a good beer, nothing amazing but enjoyable."
"O- Easily drinkable, decently refreshing, enough flavourful and complex. All you could ask, but nothing really special"
"First time I've ever enjoyed a canned beer more than the cask version, might have been the occasion of course. I'll remember that though, I usually slag off the tins!"
"I don't think I'd like this beer as much as I do if it wasn't nitro-tapped. But it is and I do."
"O: A great beer with a ton of complexity that is never fowl."
"O- Better than Bass or some of the other well-known English Pale Ales, but it's still only a slightly above average beer for me. The odd tinny note in the finish didn't help much."
"D ~ Session level beer with tons of flavor & a pretty decent price tag. Check it out if you haven't had it (out of the can). Even if you don't prefer English brews, this is still a must-try."
"Color is a clear dark amber. The head is composed of rather large bubbles, but leaves a lot of lacing on the glass. It smelled much like a glass of wine to me - some alcohol and fruity scents. The taste was different though, with malts in the forefront. An initial biscuit flavor from the malts was followed by a lemony-grassy flavor from the hops. Nicely balanced. There is a slight alcohol flavor in the aftertaste, much like after drinking champagne. Aggressive carbonation created a prickly feel on the tongue. Enjoyable and very drinkable."
"Orangey copper in color. Small-bubbled, white, foamy head diminishes quickly. Very mild aroma. Medium body and buttery on the tip of the tongue. Seems slightly less carbonated out of the bottle. Taste is earthy, piney, a bit toasty; there are slight hints of citrus, champagne and biscuit. The flavor is surprisingly strong and complex considering the lack of aroma. Very drinkable."
"Overall: tasty beer which I would like to try on draught or just on CO2 sometime. Quite refreshing and satisfying."
"Average is the word that best describes this brew. It poured a one finger head of pillowy foam over an amber(light) coloured body with some lacing. The smell was malt with somehops coming through. The tastes was much the same with a a cloying sweetness coming through. It had a little hops bite and was somewhat dry. A medium bodied brew with little carbonation. Overall this brew did nothing to impress although it is certainly drinkable."
"Overall: Nice brew, easy to drink"
"I'm glad I tried a this classic, but not sure I'd seek it out again."
"O/D-Pretty confused by this one. Has good points, but is one of the skunkier beers I have had. As it warms it gets better. But as it gets better, I am already thinking of what I should be drinking next."
"O: The beer is very easy to drink and also goes down very smoothly."
"Good mouthfeel for what its worth but did not hit the spot. Overall just lacking in real pronounced character. Drinkable for sure, but not real quenching."
"Prost!!!"
"Creamy and very drinkable."
"O - I never have any trouble taking this one nice and slow, especially as a substitution for dessert. Great beer"
"Good job from the blokes across the pond"
"Cheers!"
"A very different taste that caught me offguard at first but as it warmed a bit the flavor started coming out and I found myself thinking the more I tasted it the better it got."
"O) I've always enjoyed English pale ales, and Old Speckled Hen is no exception. I haven't had the pleasure of enjoying it on tap since my last visit to the UK, which was unfortunately eight years ago. I have found that marriage and children tend to keep you stateside."
"Overall: Worth having had but not by any means my favorite of the style..."
"What a difference a fresh sample makes. First time I tried this it was a skunked bottle past it's prime and I wasn't impressed. But last night I had it fresh and on tap. Huge difference. Poured a 1/4"" silky head which lasted almost to the last drop in the glass. Color as far as I could tell in the dark bar was a lovely clear reddish hue. Taste was pretty mild but followed with a long lasting bitterness which I could still taste after I got home. And the body itself is fairly silky smooth. Not a favorite of mine but a perfectly acceptable beer on tap."
"Easy to drink with a light to medium feel, this is one of those 'go out and buy a case' beers. I could drink this every day. Granted, probably better the closer to England you go, the better it will be, with the clear glass bottle and everything..."
"Give me a newspaper and a comfortable chair and I'd be happy just to sit there and sip Old Speckled Hen all afternoon long. Likewise, a few of these - along with some grub - over a Sunday afternoon footy match would do the trick. When it comes down to it, whether solitary relaxation or social shindigs, English ales like this are a perfectly suited drink."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and unobtrusive. Mildly carbonated. Overall a reliable albeit somewhat unremarkable English Pale Ale. It's good, but I know there are others out there calling my name."
"I don't know what the deal is with nitro beers, but all of them taste the same to me, which isn't necessarily a bad thing because they all taste good, just get kinda boring after a while. I mean I know nitro is supposed to make the beer more creamy, and it does, but I wish that creaminess didn't overpower the other tastes in the beer, and it usually does. Now on to the beer review: Pours a very solid one finger head, very creamy looking, tiny tiny bubbles, completely white in color. Excellent lacing on this beer, as would be expected with any nitro beer. The body is a dark and cloudy amber color, not much visibility through this beer at all. Not much carbonation in this beer at all, at least from what I can tell, that might be a problem, we'll see. Very nice contrast between the head and the body, it looks really cool. Overall it looks like a pretty standard nitro beer, but that doesn't mean it doesn't look awesome! Very creamy on the smell, you get the idea that it's just really smooth. Very nice malt smell as well, as I would expect with a nitro english beer. Not much hop aroma what so ever, I know it's an english pale ale, but still, there needs to be some hop aroma here. I may detect hints of honey as well, which is strange, because I don't remember this smelling at all like Boddingtons, but it kinda does the second time around. Perhaps brown sugar on the smell as well? Overall a really great smell, needs hops though, even though it is an english nitro beer, it's still a pale ale. Pretty disappointing on the flavor, you get a tiny bit of all the flavors I was talking about, the brown sugar, the honey, and some caramel, but it's hardly there, like barely at all. The flavor overall is just really bland and boring, it's just all malt and not much else to it. There is also an unwanted alcohol flavor to it, it's only 5.2%, I really shouldn't be tasting alcohol. I detect a tiny bitter/sour taste, so maybe there are some hops in here, but it could also be a metallic taste, because it's not a crisp bitter/sour, it's just...unpleasant. Overall the taste is ok at best, it's smooth and easy drinking, but it has a lot of unwanted flavors. It has a few nice flavors, it is very sweet in some areas, but for the most part the bads over ride the goods. The mouthfeel is pretty standard for a nitro beer, creamy, smooth, medium bodied. It has also no carbonation, which is unfortunate, most nitro beers have very little carbonation, and maybe I just usually don't notice how little they have, but on this beer I for sure did notice it. So overall the mouthfeel was just ok. Drinkability isn't bad, but honestly it should be higher, that alcohol and bland bitter/sour taste really detract from the drinkability, still it's smooth and goes down well, but overall not too great. Overall on this beer, what more can I say, on some sips it has a nice sweet malty flavor, and on other a very unwanted alcohol, bitter/sour flavor. It's a good beer, but very very close to being average and not a good beer."
"O: nyur.. Will have to re-review from cask.."
"This Old Speckled Hen pours out as a nice amber color with a decent white head on it. The head settles and leaves behind just axiom without a whole lot of lacing. The smell of the beer is of malts. Much like most of the English Ales I've had. No hops on the nose or anything else really. It smells a little sweet, and has some fresh grains in there too. The taste of the beer is very much full of rich malts and just a slight amount of hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is pretty smooth, the carbonation is very light here. This is something I'd like to try from a cask. I feel that the style would go better with that then from a can. Overall it's a decent brew and worth trying."
"Definitely worth a try."
"This is a well balanced beer with typical British ale characteristics (malty, metallic, floral hops, etc.) A good intro into European ales."
"O: High quality Ale here. That's the bottom line."
"O: I still can’t believe this wasn’t a nitro can. It had all the qualities in appearance and mouth feel. Anyways this isn’t a bad beer. It’s simple but I would be able to drink this all night."
"D: I like it, more complex than I was expecting by the clear bottle."
"I thought it was terrible. I'd try it again, I suppose, but I won't buy it again. And now I have a few bottles I really don't want."
"Tastes of toffee, malty sweetness, finished with a bit of bitterness."
"Overall: A nice refreshing ale. This should go well with nuts or other salty fare. I will have this one again."
"Overall, this was good tasting beer. I thought it made for a nice lighter offering and definitely something that I will have again."
"Overall. Not much in this beer for me. Was hard to get the last half down."
"Verdict: Good beer, and possibly great if it had a touch of carbonation and a tiny bit of aroma to it...Worth trying."
"A decent brew, one I wouldn't turn down for another go."
"Overall it did come off more as a fruity brown ale rather than a pale but it was very drinkable and full flavored. If it was cheaper I would consider getting it again but it's pretty pricey for a non pale. Good beer though."
"On-tap. Pours copper hue with a white, long lasting head and a lot of lacing. Aroma is of apples and pears. Body is medium and smooth. Taste is bitter, earthy hops with some apple juice. Short, unremarkable finish. Too much of fruity esters. Forgettable brew."
"A lighter bodied beer that is pretty easy to drink. I've had this beer before and I did enjoy it at that time. It's a pretty decent beer but they really need to move to darker bottles if they're going to export it across an ocean."
"Final Notes: This beer is alright. I'm not super impressed with it by any stretch of the imagination, but it's definitely palatable. I wouldn't seek it out, though."
"Dear God..I never thought that bastard would be me. Onward and upward. A second try with this beer proves it to be more tolerable than the first. Still unimpressive, and I'm not sure what the point of nitro is besides a dumb gimmick. However, I'm going to tick this up just a bit on principle."
"D: Pretty standard for an English pale ale, though not quite as sessionable for me on account of the carbonation."
"Half inch creamy off white head on a clear, sparkling deep amber body. Very little lacing. Pleasant aroma and light initial taste, with a hint of hops in the finish. Despite the bubbles racing to the top, the mouthfeel was soft and creamy. Very smooth taste, goes down easily."
"An interesting but not especially good ale. Worth trying for what I at least perceive as some level of novelty. Doesn't look or taste like any pale ale I've ever had before. Outside of that, probably won't bother to seek this out again."
"This is pretty good stuff. It's moderately alcoholic and is pleasing on the palate. With it's creamy mouthfeel, it goes down very well."
"Notes: I'm not a huge fan of traditional English beers. This seems like a good example, but I can't get behind it. (Would rather drink Tanner's Jack. )The nitro helps and gives the beer better mouthfeel, but there's some flavors here that don't work for me, thus the low ""Drinkability"" score."
"A tasty, refreshing and satisfying ale. Sweet smell of roasted barley, caramel and malt. Pours a dark amber body, slightly carbonated with hardly any head. Despite its appearance, this beverage is a wonderfully balanced brew, with flavors including coffee, toffee, malted barley, hops, yeast and has a slight bitter, metallic aftertaste. Carbonated, watery palate."
"D - highly recommended. Picked up a tall boy for about $1.5 US and would do so again."
"Overall: Very drinkable and nice. I would enjoy a single malt scotch someplace in the session, throw in some beef or pork, and good times to be had. Cheers!!"
"I was happy and suprised to see a 4 pk of Old Speckled Hen at a local beverage store---especially in the nitro-can. Had to try it! I had had this brew once, in the bottle, many moons ago. I confess, I enjoy a good English pale ale. This brew qualifies in my book. Opens and pours with the typical nitro pop and cascade. Settles to a pretty butterscotch color with great thick head. Lots of lacing left on glass as the head remains to the end of glass. Nose is simple and has some honey and biscuity scents. Taste is creamy and of typical English ale. I picked up some malt, biscuity yeast, mineral and toffee. Flavors all grew as the beer warmed. I prefered it cool to cold. Overall, a nice ale and one I would return to occasionally."
"Looks rather average, pours a pale to light golden, head is thick but recedes with some lacing. Smell has some toffee or caramel notes. Tastes of lightly roasted malts and muted toffee. Creamy mouthfeel, definitely drinkable. Not a bad pale ale and one I wouldn't mind ordering again."
"Good, but not overall amazing."
"Despite all the great qualities I've mentioned, I'm having trouble actually finishing my beer! It doesn't sit well in my stomach and I'm beginning to notice other less-welcome flavours as it warms up. Regardless, I haven't changed what I've written above because it was true at the time I wrote it."
"Drinks very well and leaves a full malty flavor on the palate."
"D- A very sessionable tasty ale."
"D: Not bad, just boring."
"Drinkability - Not overly awful just not my cup of tea - doubt I try it again unless on tap."
"A fine enough, old-school English ale, to be sure, stiff upper lip and all that, but still just kind of dull, all things being relative. The sweetness does go a certain distance in allaying the heat from my more piquant choices from the lunch buffet, so all is not lost."
"super easy to drink, great session beer."
"Overall, a solid and easy-to-drink English ale that should please most palates."
"D- Overly sweet and skunky with booze taste. Won't buy it again."
"When they poured this beer and handed it to me, it had a 95% creamy head on it. It took a few minutes but the head slowly smoothed out into the beer. Not sure if this had anything to do with the odd taste and smell."
"Pours a red-amber body with a 2 finger head dwindling down to a thin layer of foam on the body. Looks quite appealing. Smells of toffee, sweet hints of alcohol and biscuit-y malt. Tastes of the biscuit malt along with a lingering bittersweetness and cooked vegetable flavour resulting in a very dry finish. Overall, a nice beer but the finish is almost too dry along with the vegetable-like finish. It is good, not great."
"Drinkability: Great beer. I'd drink it again. Great pub fall season beer. Might try blending it with guinness"
"One of my favorites available locally. Worth a try."
"Thanks to Daniel for bringing this down. Cheers Mate! It's the dog's bollocks!"
"I will be avoiding English Ales in the future."
"This was a well balanced beer that I would have again if available on tap. Certainly better than your average pale ale."
"Goes down easy. Not a bad beer at all."
"Really I can't say enough about how just plain pretty this beer is."
"Nice cascading effect with the nitro can going on, leaves a thick and creamy white 1/2 inch head patiently sitting on top of the amber colored brew. Aromas of sweet, malty goodness hit the nose first, along with some cinnamon and a random veg-all smell that seems out of place. The extremely smooth mouthfeel is evident upon first sip, followed by a sweet caramel flavor, some alcohol presence, and bitter hops that show up just long enough to let you know that they are there. The hop bitterness quickly retreats, and you are left with a slight metallic aftertaste that lingers on the tongue for a while. Very low carbonation in the beer, but it adds to the creamy, smooth texture, leading to an extremely high drinkability."
"My first cask experience. A very smooth creamy flavor with just a hint of grass or iron maybe. There is just something hiding in there. But on cask its really good. The lack of carbonation and the warmer temp gives it a nice smooth creamy flavor and feel. You could definately drink several. But you need to enjoy that earthy grassy flavor and aroma. I did."
"Pours a glorious deep but clear reddish amber color and a respectable creamy off-white head that unfortunately doesn't hang around long. The aroma is sweet and malty. In fact, it gives the impression of being a little too sweet at first, but the flavor actually has a nice balance, with a pleasant, muddled combination of toffee, caramel, and cherries being held in check by a dull, mild, and somewhat nondescript hop bitterness. The smooth texture works with the flavors, but it doesn't necessarily stand out on its own. Overall, this was different, unexpected, and quite pleasant."
"Crossed paths with it on-tap last night. Thought I'd give it another shot. Yeah, it's alright. The pour was nice (fond of the nitro-file). Despite a smooth, creamy first look, the head petered out rather early and the sheeted lacing stopped halfway down (not a spotless class, hmm?). The aroma is a tad bready and certainly a larger degree 'fruity', but there's a decidedly whiskey quality overall. Not just the aroma but the color and flavor as well. Reminds me vaguely of Bass...maybe. But, anyway, yes, the whiskey edge is strong - a watered-down beer version of the spirit. Decent smoothness in feel - the nitro certainly blandifies the drinkiness and flavor-taste. This is an ideal session or fish-n-chips (et al - pub food) drink, notwithstanding."
"A classic beer, I always have to consume in significant quantities when I visit the English pubs, but the bottled version is indeed worth the money too (if you can muster it)."
"Not sure I'd buy it again in a bottle, but will most certainly grab it on tap if I ever see it."
"I got these in a 4-pack, and I'll certainly drink the rest now that they're in my fridge, but I can't see myself buying it (especially in this serving type) again."
"Still a very nice beer for a change. Bit of nostalgia value too, of course."
"As far as the bottle? Not a chance I would buy it again."
"Pours a moderate amber-copper color with a creamy off-white head that persists and leaves a good deal of lacing. The nose is quite plain with a bit of bready malt and some very, very faint floral hops. The taste suffers from the same fate as there really is just not much to this one. Mouthfeel is light and creamy. Drinks well enough but just is not a terribly flavorful or complicated beer."
"D - Easy drinking, partially because it is near-flavorless."
"It tastes very smooth, about the same as the nose. Mouthfeel is good, but the lack of carbonation really hurts. Still, it's non-offensive. And that makes it drinkable, if a bit overly boring."
"I wish it was a bit more carbonated, but the that would take away from the drinkability. This beer is very smooth. I would def give a try."
"Pours an amber-orange colour with thick white head and lots of lacing. Looks like a nitro-tap, but no widget in can. Smells of huge caramel malt with faint floral hops. Almost no bitterness, but lots of sweetness. Very creamy mouthfeel. A nice enough beer, but not quite enough hops for a pale ale."
"Pours a clean orange-ish copper color with a light tan head. In the aroma, a light sweet, gingerbread like maltiness. In the taste, a light and dry malt. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfel, with a small sweet malt to clean aftertaste. Kind of like Boddington's with more flavor."
"Old Speckled Hen is a bold work within the pale ale style but it falls short of its ambition."
"Not bad, but certainly very different in this clear bottle from what I remember the draught version tastes like. Certainly a more manufactured feel to it here, a very run-of-the-mill English pale. Still, it's going down well and I'll probably come back to it again, just next time in another serving type."
"Pours a pretty copper color with a thick white head and some residual lacing. Smells of strong hops and toasted grain. A very well blended mix of hops, semi sweet malts, and nice grain flavors all hit the tongue well. Mouthfeel is average and a little fizzy. Drinkability is not too shabby. A classic brew here."
"Clear bottle, eh? Alright, fair enough. The beer inside pours a straight amber topped by a thin half-finger of off-white foam. The nose is strictly a combination of rye bread and walnuts. Nothing more, nothing less. The taste adds in a touch of oak, a drop or two of light maple syrup, and some light greenery. The body is a heavy light/light medium, with a very light carbonation and a very smooth feel. Overall, a nice EPA, nothing eye-catching (or 'bud-catching, I guess) but tasty enough and highly drinkable."
"Overall, I wouldn't rank this offering above average in my quest through the world of beer. I chalk it up as a learning experience and will forge ahead."
"Still trying to find the ideal version of this beer as nitro mutes the malts and the clear bottle is usually a little off. Guess I need to go to England for a cask beer for the real thing."
"And as for the Chelsea Hotel... enjoy the ambience from the sidewalk, from a Leonard Cohen song or a Virgil Thomson composition. Don't waste a dollar on the accommodations."
"D: Like most british beers I had the chance to drink, this one is also extremely drinkable with being very balanced. Good brew."
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle. Sampled on September 18, 2010. It pours a reddish-amber with about an inch of puffy off-white head that bubbles downward little by little and leaves some nice lacing. Caramel malts and molasses seem to greet the nose with a crisp thin hoppiness in the background. There is a fine bitterness to the flavor with a buttery-caramel sweetness and with a sharp hop bite at the end. Very English. I used to buy this one frequently but not as much anymore. But I still like it from time to time."
"Simple beer and easy enough to drink. I wouldn't turn it down but wouldn't go looking for it ."
"Had this one on tap at The Olde Ship in Fullerton last night. Tried this beer years ago from the bottle and thought it was ok so let's see how it is from a nitro tap. Smooth, creamy, crisp with just a bit of hop kiss at the finish. Very good on tap. Hit the spot for me and worked well with the bangers and mash I ordered."
"I could drink these all night."
"Still, this is a very decent English ale - probably one of my favourites, even though I'm not a huge fan of the style in general."
"Pours a clear dark copper with a creamy off-white head. Smells of sulfur, and butter. Taste is juicy grapes up front, with a toasted bread middle, and an earthy, dry bitter finish. Mouthfeel is good, low carbonation. Quite drinkable, I would imagine this is loads better at the source (on cask), but in bottled form its a pretty good beer too."
"A decent beer that I'd drink again, especially on-tap because it looks cool being poured. However, I still like the bottle version better. While it may be good, I couldn't see myself drinking too many of these."
"Overall - A pretty nice English Pale ale. Haven't got around to trying too many EPA's yet, but they're most definitely a different animal than APA's. For those looking for a smooth, subtle, malty pale, this one delivers."
"Bought at the SAQ. From a translucid 500ml bottle. Very nice clear copper colour ale. White head, little retention. Nice cristal malt nose, with some roastiness. Sharp hop bitterness, nice flavor, little malt but lots of hops. Nice English style pale ale."
"Drinkability: Overall the great mouthfeel and interesting taste makes this a very fun beer to enjoy. Quite good."
"d- really drinkable, i had this a little bit ago for the first time, and i would drink it again for sure."
"The taste is not particularly sweet, it has a nice caramel malty mid section, lots of toffee and butterscotch flavors, a good deal of drying and slightly bittering leafy hop in the finish. The beer is just a classic English Pale, with the herbal caramels, slightly roasted toffee flavors, and the drying finish. There is subdued sweetness here and this is what really separates this out from faux EPAs. As the beer settles, it really brings out the pale malts. There is a touch of minty mouthfeel to the beer as well."
"Poured into a pint glass a ruby-like amber orange with a creamy one finger head. Substantial amount of lacing. Smells of fresh cut spring flowers and caramel sweetness. Sweet bubblegum taste offset by a slight bitter hoppiness. Considerable carbonation and a medium to light body. Quite refreshing with a dry finish and nice aftertaste. A pleasant surprise, I would happily buy and drink a sixer of this brew without regret."
"Poured a translucent copper/amber into a pint glass, with one finger of off-white, great Guinness-like waterfall and retention, and excellent lacing. The aroma consisted of toffee, caramel, apple, and pear. The taste equaled the aroma, with a nice caramel malty dissolve at the finish. Silky smooth feel, with no carbonation, excellent lacing, and excellent retention. Truly an awesome session brew. Had this on a nitro-tap at a small wannabe Irish pub around the corner from dba Manhattan, and it was amazing as well. Presentation and texture is KEY to this beer, as I couldn't imagine this beer tasting as good in a regular bottle or carbonated tap."
"D: High. Delicious bitter. I would drink all they long, you can bet it... ;)"
"Wow! This is probably the best beer Ive ever had in a can other than Guinness. The bottles are even better and would rank a quarter point higher, but the taste of this beer is velvety smooth, and you can taste the hardwork and character of this reddish color brew. If you happen to see this beer, buy it!"
"Thanks to woodychandler for the trade.Poured from a 14.9 oz. nitro can. When it finally settled down has a caramel color with a 1.5 inch head, considerable lacing throughout. Smells of malts and hops, a bit of sweetness to it. Taste is of caramel up front, the hops coming out later, slightly sweet. Feels creamy in the mouth and is very drinkable. Overall this is a fine quality beer."
"Not exactly ho-hum, as there are other English ales out there more worthy of that distinction, and it's pretty unique among other English pale ales, but I'm definitely not crazy about it."
"Old Speckled Hen has an inviting appearance- a distinct amber color and a foamy head. The ale will continue to lace the glass. The aroma is a combination of overripe fruit and the sweetness of caramel. The taste is at first sweet and followed by bitterness. The two are so separate that it cannot be described as balanced. The texture is smooth and velvety. For me, I can drink one glass and then move one to something more balanced."
"D: Easy to drink and nice however the flavor is lacking."
"HV"
"this poured beautifully but then just settled to a average appearance. Not much smell. Taste... average with a corn like flavor. no great mouthfeel. nothing special happening here. Except for the beautiful initial pour there is nothing special about this English Pale Ale."
"CAN I add? Great lacing throughout!"
"All in all, an ok ale. Easy."
"D: Great, is brew is easy drinking and good for a session beer. No heavy feeling."
"I'm curious to try it on tap. It's interesting and sessionable, but not the first or even second pale ale I'd grab for."
"Served fron a bottle, poured a light amber, almost like a dark tea color with a reddish hue. Thin foamy head that didn't last. Wasn't overly impressed with the character until I let it sit and warm up a bit. Sweet toasted malt aromas with hints of fruit. Similar tastes with sweet malty toasted flavors and a clean fruity, dark cherry finish. Easy to drink. Although I'm used to ice cold beer, this one showed it's character when it was more at +50F. Pleasantly surprised by this English Ale."
"D- A very sessionable ale, would be no problem to drink this all evening."
"This is a refreshing, drinkable, and delicious ale. The nitro can serving smooths the taste considerably."
"Pretty drinkable. Nothing extravagant, but still a good beer. Much better than the bottled verrsion."
"Drinkability: A solid Nitro pub ale. Not much different from the Guinness and Boddingtons of the world."
"D- Well as most nitro-can english pub ales this is a session beer in all aspects. Drink up and cheers!"
"I haven't had enough EPA to know how good an example this is. I wouldn't really buy this again but I would recommend it."
"D: Pretty decent session beer if you're considering sticking with EPAs for the night."
"Well, I almost suspect that this bottle was a bit old. Would have liked more hops to balance the sweetness."
"Overall, might go back if I have nothing to drink in the pub or if it's on sale."
"D- I have to be honest i struggled to put this one down. It just had too much of a bitter malty graininess to me."
"Drinkability. I could easily have another, and I thought it went well with a meal. It has an unusual taste the more I drink it, and I can't decide if I like it or not."
"Drinkability: Not bad, not great. A pretty simple, moderately drinkable English pale ale."
"Good ol' Speckled Hen. Always on nitro-tap at Britts in Pasadena just east of Pasadena City College on Colorado Blvd. This is a unique pale ale most Californians don't seem to know, but probably should! Like afternoon sunshine in a glass, the nitro-tap produced an incredibly creamy three finger lingering head with great retention and lacing. A mild and sweet aroma gives way to an exceedingly pleasant velvety smooth mouthfeel, offering a slightly sweet taste with a mildly sour finish. Neither robust nor bold, nevertheless excellent with food and always easy. I would happily drink this one all night."
"The taste is sweet, roasty, and fresh-baked bread and malt flavors with gentle hop bitterness are very tasty. Medium-bodied, very smooth, and flavorful, Old Speckled Hen has good drinkability."
"Drinkabality is just average. It does go down easy but lacks and flavor or anything that would make me want to have it again as I've had much better examples from the style. Not a bad beer, but nothing special."
"Future outlook: Not a standout to seek out, but a solid brew to enjoy if given again."
"This is a beer that I drank a lot when I started getting into good beer and I haven't had one in a while, it was a pleasant time revisiting this beer."
"I prefer this to Boddingtons."
"Nitro can.. After settling: 1-inch thick, creamy, tan head above golden-amber ale. Caramel-toffee, butter nose! Very smooth, medium weight body. Slightly bitter finish, albeit short. Creamy, thick ""lace."" Just OK. I will not seek it out again."
"The chalky minerals really come through in the taste and give it a decidedly British feel. Hops are there mainly in a bittering role, but do lend some floral and herbaceous undertones. Malt is mildly sweet and boasts some toffee and burnt toast characteristics. Mouthfeel is somewhat thin, but not much of a detraction. Drinks pretty nice, I would imagine this tasting quite a bit better fresh from a cask across the pond. Glad I picked up this single bottle and will probably give it a go next time I see it on tap at a local pub."
"This is a very balanced brew. Extremely easy going down and a case of this would be welcome..."
"D-its a great english pale ale, very clean bitterness, nice caramel and biscuit notes followed with a very evident english yeast flavor."
"D: I really was not a big fan of this beer. Just too many disjointed things happening in terms of the flavor."
"An old standby of sorts, think ive had better in the bottled version."
"Buy Again? No"
"The aroma is malty and yeasty with a small amount of hops to balance. The appearance is amber with a nitro head that makes a nice foam. The taste is like the aroma and quite balanced as well. The palate is smooth. Overall a very good session beer. I can drink this often."
"D: Not a bad little brew.... ABV is good and the mix of flavors is worth grabbing one and giving it a try...."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The body is light. The carbonation is appropriate to the beer. Pretty much the throwback beer I remember. A bit more flavorful and a bit more aromatic than I remembered. Still tempted to throw back in a bottle but I think in a glass and just short of cold temperature is the way to go."
"Notes: Good beer with some interesting flavors. Not a lot of hops so it turns out being a somewhat sweet beer, although I don't think it is too sweet or really malty. Good but not amazing."
"D: higher ABV for a traditional English ale, but not bad after a meal."
"Smooov drinking; light on the chops yet showing some substance to it. The 14.9oz can didn't last to the end of the rating. Call me a romantic dreamer, but right or wrong this is sort of how I have imagined English bitters in any local, unassuming pub in England. My family is from there, and I am feelin the Call of the Mild."
"Tastes like it smells - a bit of malt, a bit of hops but overall very watery. Doesn't really leave much of a taste in your mouth. I guess you could describe it as smooth, but it doesn't exactly make me want to down pints of it. Not dreadful, but a far cry from some of the much better EPA's."
"The beer I had before this one was an Arrogant Bastard, which seemed to highlight the blandness of the OSH."
"D - The flavor is a bit too ""rich"" for me to think to have several in a row, but I'd definitely enjoy one or two."
"I am interested to try the canned an draft versions for comparison."
"Really drinkable, impressive English ale. I could session this every day and not complain."
"Drinkability: Not as good as I remembered this in the bottle, unfortunately; the nut-skin bitterness doesn't appear to work very well"
"Overall - I love it, a nice silky smooth mild beer that leaves a good aftertaste. However I wouldn't drink this beer after an IPA as I don't think I would taste anything."
"Overall, it's a pretty good beer, though I prefer English Bitters with a bit more character like Fuller's or Samuel Smith's. Cheers."
"D- Next."
"The history of the beer is pretty interesting. The making of ""old Speckled Hen has something to do with the 50th anniversary of the MG Car company."
"Ordered a pint at St. James' gate in JP last Saturday night. Man, the bartender certainly took her time finishing off pouring this beer. Took forever. Sunset yellow color body. Thin white head finally settles at the top. Smells creamy like a cappuccino, warming and thick. Taste was slightly above average. Not a lot too it, but enough flavor to be satisfying. The nitro really makes this beer shine. Gives it a creamy texture that helps keep each successive sip just as thick as the last. Low in abv helps make this beer a great session choice. Old Speckled Hen is a mainstay in Brit/Irish pub for a reason: it's good."
"Poured from a 335ml bottle a perfect rich copper color into a pint glass, barely any head on this, alittle dissapointed with that but maybe it was my pour. Nearly no bubbles or indication of carbonation but it still looks inviting. Smells malty sweet, and tastes of hops and malt blended near perfectly. Sweet but not intense, a slight bitter. A full rich medium feel with little carbonation or liveliness, but overall a very solid drinkable ale, very well rounded and im pleased. Ill be getting this again, ill be looking to try this on tap also. The color of this in the bottles makes them look very nice and interesting and is probably the reason for the use of clear bottles, but i dont think its really worth possibly letting damaging light get at the beer, especially a good beer."
"I can remember finding this beer on tap at the Gingerman in Albany about 15 years ago and being blown away by it. Over the years I have had it a number of time but solely from the bottle with not so great results. Was able to give it a try last evening on Cask at Mahars and once again was really impressed. Brew was pulled to a nice golden color with some amber/orange highlights. Good sized frothy head that had nice retention and lacing. The aroma is nice, toffee and caramel, slight hop. Very impressed with the delicacy of it. The flavors are similar to the nose, hops feel seems to come out a little more. Nice toffee flavor, extremely smooth feel. An excellent English brew IMO. Now at 5.2 ABV this might not be a sessional brew but it sure has that feel."
"when it's on par in price with our macros here in Canada it's a pretty easy choice."
"Notes: I have seen this beer in so many places and finally having one shows me why it is so popular. I was pleasantly surprised by it."
"Notes: I find this beer incredibly unique and like nothing I've ever tasted....however it makes me feel like I'm losing my mind since no one else seems to have a similar experience regarding its smell/flavor profiles. I find this beer fascinating, but difficult to drink much of."
"Overall, I enjoy drinking this beer and would recomend it to fans of English Pale Ales. I know some people do not like nitro-taps, but I for one, love them. I will definitely drink this again in the future."
"Tasted clean, backed by a hop, tad watery, but overall a good brew. Very creamy in the mouthfeel, low carbonation. A drinkable english pale - not exceedingly flavorful, but easy to drink."
"(bottle into pint glass) Poured a rich dark amber with half finger head with good lacing. Aroma of faint citrus and spice with no other real distinguishing notes. Very lively in the mouth, but left a bit of a bitter aftertaste that hung on a little longer than pleasurable."
"First time I've tried this old standby on tap. The appearance is a clear amber copper color with a thick and healthy sized off-white head and bullish lacing. The aroma is slightly fruity bread, bright but light, pretty neutral. The taste is a tart fruity hop with toffee bread and sour mash malt. There's somewhat of a dry finish. It's more than mid-bodied and very creamy. Tiny bubbles with good mouth action, refreshing and very drinkable."
"I found this one to be reminiscent of a pilsner because of it's sharp taste, even though it's amber in color and doesn't produce a mountain of head. It has medium body and carbonation. The sharp taste doesn't last all the way through, smoothing out on the way down. In the end, I'm damn confused. What is this beer suppose to be?"
"D: I can drink this beer ice cold on nitro, but from the bottle is not to my liking because of two factors: perceived skunk and soapy finish. The best thing about this beer is what it looks like, but really we are after the taste here."
"The drinkability of this beer is unequalled, in my opinion. Smooth, distinct, refreshing, and with an aftertaste that will not offend the inexperienced beer drinker. This beer is one that I come back to very often and I never regret it! The reasonable price it can be had for seals the deal for me..."
"This brew poured a medium head of Med. white bubbles with a good lacing. Its body is a beautiful amber brown color with carbonated bubbles rising up the side of the glass. I smelled an aroma of hops and citrus. It has a fizzy hoppy kinda grainy taste that starts off slightly bitter and finishes slightly bitter too. Not a bad brew but it could be better. not my favorite Pale. this is the 3rd time I gave this beer a try, and still it's just OK."
"Drinkability - sessionable, sure, but more so any other way."
"drinkability is decent. for a cask beer, this is a bit underwhelming. thin and watery without much of a character. usually cask beers are exercises in subtleties, but this is more of a one-trick-pony without much of a trick. decent, but nothig to seek out."
"I'm a sucker for English beers, and this one hits the spot. Not an elite brew by any means, but damn fine in it's own right."
"Great pour out of the nitro can. Long time cascading effect, big, thick sheets of lace as you drink it and when you tip the glass the foam just sticks-suspended in place along the wall of the pint, ebbing away as fast as clouds move. The color is a beautiful reddish amber color. The nose offers sweet red taffy, fresh macadamia nuts, caramel malt and mild notes of warm biscuit. The taste is effected by the lack of a mouthfeel. Still pleasant with caramel, honey, ginger shavings and a malty, nutty sweetness. Not much of a finish, thin mouthfeel with low carbonation-still a good beer just pour it slowly, don't try and make your head crest the glass."
"It's too cloying to be really solidly drinkable, or much of a quencher."
"Mouthfeel/Drink: Light bodied, enough carbonation, a little bit dry feeling aroud mouth when finished. Enough drinkability, worth a try."
"A good sessionable beer with excellent visual appeal."
"Overall: Not a great beer but also not too bad. I'd be very interested in trying this on draft or maybe even cask. The metallic taste was a bit of a turn off but I didn't take off points because it did go away when the beer hit proper serving temp."
"Drinkability: I don’t think this brew gets the credit it deserves. I’m a huge fan of Old Speckled Hen. It smells good, it tastes good and it all comes at a good price. I don’t care where you are or what you’re doing you need to be drinking this beer right now. Except maybe if you’re in a job interview. No, wait, even if you’re in a job interview. Do you really want to work for someone who doesn’t like this stuff?"
"For those who want to try a nitro-tapped brew but like the more traditional look, unlike guiness, this is the beer to get. Head settles quickly over a bronze body of this brew. This beer is very famous but not because of the scent. It as a smooth feel in the mouth but has a slightly fruity malt and hop balance."
"This beer pours a clear light red color. The head is a quarter inch in height, and recedes quickly into no lacing. The aroma is of mild skunk (you've got to love clear bottles), and even milder malt. The taste is has more caramel malt than the aroma, but there is still enough skunk that it isn't a pleasant taste. The mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium bodied with a watery texture, and low carbonation. Overall, this beer might be better if it weren't skunked. However, I blame the brewery for skunking it by putting it in a clear bottle. I might try this again, and probably on tap. I won't be drinking this again otherwise."
"Taste: Metallic taste from the nitrogen. Mild bitterness in the finish. Seems a little dry."
"D: Not much to this beer, I don't know why but it was flavourless."
"D: Overall it was good, and I enjoyed the beer, but felt a little heavy after a few of these. I had a couple of these beers with some steak for dinner and thought it really enhanced my meal!"
"D: Would be better without the soapyness."
"Ok so the first thing that hits is malt sweetness followed by a slight bitterness that reminds me of cooked veggies a little bit. There is also a real bread taste towards the end too. The mothfeel is a little watery but overall its fine."
"Flavours include some light caramel malt, some not-so-nice grassy hops, and finishes with a lingering noble hop bitterness. Needs more of a malty backbone."
"had this on tap at brits pub in Minneapolis it poured a medium golden color with a thick 1 inch cotton head..the smell was bitter and malty ..the taste was the same it was a bitter ale with metallic hops and bittersweet malts..it slid down with my fish and chips ..but no way would i buy this beer in a sixer..i guess its ok at an English pub.. i will say we had a great time on the rooftop on a beautiful autumn night in the north land..what a beautiful setting"
"Wow, just looking for a single with which to share my evening and by the looks of this beer's overall scores, I should have had a pretty good one. The price, I guess, should have tipped me off, but I still gave it a go. When it comes down to it, this beer did live up to its name. It appears to taste as an old speckled hen might."
"Pours an amber copper color with minimal white head. Smell is some toffee, butterscotch, a little bit of skunk. Taste is more butterscotch and toffee. Some hops and toasted malt. A little bit of diacetyl but not in a bad way. Creamy mouthfeel. Good drinkability. Tastes like England, if that makes sense."
"D: A nice beer at the pub - sit down and talk-beer."
"D: I prefer this beer from the bottle. I've been lucky enough to have a non-skunked bottle, but only the can was available for this review."
"M - Smooth and creamy start with diacetyl slickness that transitions to a slightly course finish with the carbonation and dry bitterness."
"Served in a standard pint glass. Poured a hazy copper with a tight, almost solid, half-inch white head. Some lacing, but weak legs during the tasting. Nose was pale malts, a hint of tea and some hops. Taste consistent with nose, with a lemony quality coming out in the mix. Mouthfeel was fairly light in body and creamy smooth. An easy drinking session beer on nitro; however, the tea-like flavors, coupled with the lemon character get in the way after a while."
"Clear amber with a beautifully dense white head that disappear into copious lace. Nondistinct cereal aroma. Wonderfully smooth mouthfeel, but not much of anything else that would make this beer standout. Bitter finish. If it weren't for the nitro, this would be one boring brew."
"Try with roast beef sandwiches, fish & chips, mild cheese and pickles, or your drinking buddy."
"OVERALL: A pretty solid brew all around, though the thinner airy palate was not quite up to par. An enjoyable and drinkable brew that I'd have again, though I wouldn't go on a wile goose chase for it."
"Drinkability: Pretty good. A good session beer."
"A nice drinking ale. Should complement foods well, especially those that do well with drier beers. A drink that could be enjoyed several pours over the evening."
"MF/D: Very nice mouthfeel, surprisingly thick, smooth woody and sweet malt finish."
"D: So so easy going down, the smoothness from the nitro widget makes this incredibly quaffable, but remains something to ruminate on due to the complexity this beer displays in flavor profile. A beer worth paying attention to."
"My chicks feel slightly chalky after things have dried out, but not annoyingly so. When all is said and done, ""Old Speckled Hen"" is a fairly good english ale."
"Pours a oft-amber color. Scents of roasted nuts and caramel come through on the nose. Half-decent head with some lacing, but goes down quickly. Goes down rather smoothly and has just below a medium body feel. A bit unbalanced. Some fuggles hops shine on the back end. A nice session beer."
"D: The lack of carbonation makes this one sort of weird and I'm not sure I'd want to drink a lot of it, but it is a pretty drinkable beer regardless, so I guess I'll go easy on it."
"D - Pretty easy to drink - abv is manageable. Carbonation is pretty potent however, making it somewhat filling. Astringency is somewhat tiring to the palette."
"Has a nice amber color with a beautiful smooth beige head. Smells slightly of bread and malts, nothing really strong or distinct. The taste is a mix of slightly sweet bread and bitter hops, pretty god combination. Could be a little bit thicker, but I'm not really complaining, goes down real well. Good taste, not too strong, definitely an anytime beer."
"D: Alright beer, more novelty than anything. The appearance is the best part."
"The taste is lightly caramelly toasted grain, a lot of leafiness, slightly spicey, with nuts and hints of fruit and pine, a great sweet-bitter balance and a slight spicy, leafy-nutty bitterness with faint earthiness. It has nice, light, subtle complexity. Moreover, this beer, unlike some, still has a good feel from the nitrocan, even if the underlying body is somewhat on the watery side. Not only does is have the creaminess from the creamy head, but this carries down through the beer, giving a lasting, balanced, smooth, and creamy texture, rather than leaving one with a thin, watery body under the nice head."
"D-Very drinkable Pale Ale as it goes down very easy."
"D - Very enjoyable and easy to drink."
"D: I only had one of these, wanted another"
"Drinkability: I suffered trying to finish the last bit of the pint. The saving grace was my steak and guinness Pot Pie I had."
"Smooth. Goes down very easily and it's kind of unique. I can dig it."
"Reddish orange in color, it comes in a clear bottle so you get what you see. Good head that doesn't last, but leaves a collar while beer lasts. Not very aromatic. Nice clean, crisp, slightly malty with little bitterness. I like, but have an admitted preference for English pale ales. Some carbonation that leaves a little bite at the front of the tongue. Very drinkable; a bit dull, but safe beer."
"Clear, light amber body, with a decent head. There wasn't much to taste, but a slightly bitter aftertaste. I really can't think of another way to describe this except a watered down beer. There are plenty of other pale ales to try, but this one could have definitely been left on the shelf."
"A clear copper color body with a small white head,leaving some jagged lacing behind, light carbonation. Aroma is caramel malt , slightly fruity,lightly spicy and a hint of bread dough. Flavor is of sweet caramel malt , butterscotch,spicy hops and ripe fruit,lightly bitter,short finish with a sweet aftertaste ,creamy mouthfeel,medium body , drinkable but nothing special enough to buy again."
"Overall the Old Speckled Hen was nothing mindblowing or groundbreaking, but it's still a solid beer that I would recommend if you had limited selection."
"Overall I think its a good beer, beautiful color and smell. The taste is good but for me it is a beer to have for a quick drink or maybe something with BBQ not something I would want to drink all night"
"D: Tastes like it's made to drink a lot of."
"Not the most amazing of flavors, it is just an ale. A good ale, with a definite sweetness to it, but nothing outstanding in any way. Slightly buttery, I am again reminded of a few whiskeys."
"Mouthfeel was smooth but on the thin side."
"D) Nice casual brew to kick back and relax with, but not a ""wow-ing"" taste."
"Drinkability: alcohol never seems to play a part in this beer. Refreshing and rather easy to drink."
"Drinkability: Perhaps one to strictly stick to draft or possibly the nitro cans. It certainly has potential, but initial skunk and lingering metal are a real turn-off."
"d: good, but a bit bitter."
"Pours a seethru light brown with a solid one-finger head that slowly dies and leaves some lace patches on top of a grassy, smokey smelling-beer with light roasted malts and some minor sweetness like honey. A pleasurable blance of a smooth, slightly creamy medium-bodied beer with a good amount of citric hops and caramelized malts with a hint of roasted and toffee malts as well. Finishes slightly dry with some herbal tea-like hop bitterness and a little bit of breadi- and woodiness. Nothing complex but an easy drinking ale that I could sip on all night."
"Just an average pub ale to drink if nothing else is around. I would not recommend it, but much worse could be had."
"Drinkability: I gave this beer a try, but I really just did not fall in love with it. Sadly enough, pale ale's are one of my variety style and this was just a let down. I wish I could say I would be okay with sessioning this beer, but with the dry finish this is not a thirst quenching beer that I could drink all day long."
"D: Very, very easy to drink; I have no complaints whatsoever about the smoothness and balance of this Pale Ale. Would be hard to find a more balanced/drinkable English Pale...I will return."
"D: I had one at lunch and I don't think I'll ever order it again. It wasn't terrible, just not my thing."
"I will say that the taste and smell are the weak points but the mouthfeel and drinkability are just about right to nearly perfect. I would easily reach for another Old Speckled Hen on a hot day. I could make this my lawn mower beer without a problem. I won't be seeking it out but if one is offered I wouldn't turn it down. It's better than any macro - whether domestic or foreign. Overall - not bad."
"D: It goes down easy. Overall it was good, but touch over priced for me being in college and all. But worth a try. As a side note it has a cool bottle design."
"cask is definitely the way to do this."
"(I just read the style blurb and I now realize it's the 'hard water' that causes the 'cold watery' mouthfeel. Review edited accordingly)."
"D: Decent. Not extremely drinkable, as it starts feeling a little heavy after a while."
"M/D: The beer had a medium body to it, light carbonation, smooth, creamy and excellent drinkability. Good for a session."
"Final Thoughts - This beer is a bit off the beaten path, and it's not bad for a single sample. However, this isn't a beer you have more then once. It's a bit too expensive, it's a bit off and while it is unique, that doesn't make it good. Worth one shot, not much more. I applaud the effort, even if it isn't my cup of tea."
"50 cl clear (?) glass bottle pulled from the back of the store's shelf, poured into a pint glass, a coppery color that almost seems a bit pink. Slight white head that quickly disappears. Bready, nutty malt aroma with a hint of floral hops, aroma improves as it warms. Flavor leans toward the malt side of the spectrum, even a little sweet without getting a heavier mouthfeel. Fruitness of the yeast becomes more prominent as it warms. Definitely sessionable, can see where this would benefit from being served from a cask. All in all a pleasant, true-to-form English Ale, most notable for a rather dry finish despite a bit of sweet malt flavor."
"D: This beer has some decent attributes, but it didn't wow me in any way. Not terrible, not great."
"d: I would not turn one down; it tasted different from other Pale Ales I've had, and that alone might make me buy more."
"Dark copper with a slight, light tan head that leaves a small amount of lace just above the head. Smells of caramel malt and toffee with some faint skunkiness (They still use a clear bottle?) and fruity hops. Mild, sweet malt and buttery toffee with toasted bread and english hoppy bitterness in the finish to balance, skunkiness fades after a few minutes. Light bodied with mild carbonation. Decent."
"Drinkability:A good, if not almost very-good beer. Could be a bit bolder on the flavor, but otherwise, quite nice. Really nice as a Nitro-Tap."
"D - overall quite refreshing, I've definitely enjoyed the remainder of the sixer left here by one of my buddies a couple weeks ago."
"D: A nice beer overall, nothing offensive, just smooth all around."
"This one is medium bodied and well carbonated -- fizziness is a plus with this one, and might be the tipping point for a drinkability standpoint. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by this one. Wasn't expecting much, but got alot more. A fairly decent brew with some good qualities. Would love to try this on tap."
"On tap with nitro is really the only way to enjoy this beer (in the US anyways). There are other beers that have this characteristic, but it's important with this one. A simple, fun brew to enjoy a few of. Even gets better as it warms up, but will not last too long if you enjoy it as much as I did..."
"Pours from the bottle a clear orangey-amber with about a finger of head that quickly dissipates to nothing. At first smell, a bit of skunk alarmed me, but perhaps it was the grassy, herbal notes and my wariness of the clear bottle playing a trick on me. Also noticeable was a milky, maltiness. I taste a lot of buttery, caramel malt, but the finish has a touch of hops, all of which leave the mouth feeling a little sticky. On the whole, a nice, affordable beer that is extremely drinkable."
"this beer pours a very nice crystal clear dark gold color wihth a slightly off white head. the nitrus can was deffinitely a good call weswes. the aroma has a good bit of sweet malt and not much else maybe a hint of floral hops. the taste is a bit bland a bit of sweet malt and just a bit of hops at the end. the light body and the nitrus carbonation make it seem a little too flat, despite the head that wouldn't die. not a bad beer, I'd like to try it on tap."
"A very nice rounded beer."
"D: I might try again to see if it is just this bottle, or if it is supposed to taste this way..."
"Drinkability: I personally think this tastes like Budweiser with a kick. Very light and indistinguishable for me. I would not turn this down, but will not be picking this up."
"Conclusion: It's ok...nothing special...mediocre English Pale"
"I expected to be less impressed than when I had it on cask at the George Canning, Camberwell, but I was a little unprepared for just how lame it turned out to be. Made it about halfway through the bottle before I concluded it's best use would be to pass through my apartment's plumbing. If I encounter a fresher sample on cask, I'd try this again. Otherwise, drinking this beer has been the beer equivalent to the old saying, ""You can never go home again."""
"Drinkable, yes, but not really for quaffing I don't think. Too sticky. Really nice with food. I'd happily drink it again, but I prefer Innis & Gunn and Fuller's."
"Verdict: Old Speckled Hen is a solid, but generally unexciting beer. Nice enough flavor profile, very sessionable, and has the brilliant creaminess that you get with a nitro-can. If you're looking for something in a nitro-can besides Guinness and Boddingtons, you won't go wrong here."
"Drinkability - weak. One is enough. One is enough for a long time."
"D: Nutty flavor, overall sweetness and gentle bittering finish that let the tastes linger a bit was very enjoyable."
"Pours a very warm orange brown color with a tight knit half inch pure white cap. Very nice cascading effect, gotta love the show that the nitro can puts on. The nose is pretty nice, twiggy grain, hints of sugary sweetness, lots of caramel and toffee. The flavor nearly mimics its aroma, it leaves my palate wanting some more balance, i find it too sweet. The creamy mouthfeel and body add more to this balance issue, a crisp hop bite would surely change this beers character for the better. Light in overall body, low carbonation and a decent beer to have once in a while, i dont think it would ever classify as a go to for me though."
"Drinkability: Nothing really excited or put me off about this beer. I like to have it every now and then but will usually go for other craft offerings."
"D: This is a nice English Pale Ale. I could have done without the initial skunky aromas, but they eventually subsided into the background and left a nice, very drinkable, if somewhat sub-stellar brew."
"Poured a translucent copped-hued reddish amber color into a pint glass. Aroma is light, mostly musty grassy hops and caramel malt undertones. Taste is a nicely balanced blend of lightly bitter musty hoppiness and slightly sweet caramel maltiness. Mouthfeel is smooth, low carbonation levels and light to medium bodied Drinkability is good, nothing stands out in a major way in this ale, but it remains true to the style and is an easy drinker. Recommend trying, would purchase again."
"D - not so much"
"Nothing extraordinary, but a unique macro brew that is certainly better than average. I think I'll get this once in a while as it is a good 'average' session brew."
"I like this ale... Yet the special flavours make me not want to drink it too often. A few pints a year is enough."
"3 M&3 D: different from the cask version, the body is way too thin and doubled by the sour fruity edge. On average it's not bad but requires a richer body to round off the overall flavour and its 5.2%abv. Better on cask."
"Overall- a good decent and balanced stand-by which I really enjoyed on tap. Recommended."
"MF&D - I find that the good amount of carbonation in the beer makes of for its lackluster taste, and seems to cover it up. now, in reality, that shouldn't need to happen, but in turn it does make the beer nice to drink!"
"This is a mild mannered, middle of the road offering."
"Not a bad session ale at all. I wouldn't mind getting a four pack of these some night and going to town on them. Better than Boddington's, the only other Bitter in a nitro can I've had to compare directly to."
"Overall: Decent ale. Tastes more like a brown ale than an English Pale Ale, though."
"D: A must drink for all beer enthusiasts. I hope to taste it on cask some day."
"Drinkability was good. Would like another please."
"Smells malty with a slight nuttiness. Has that traditional earthy and almost ""old basement"" taste to it. Drinks really easy, but bubbles seem nonexistent on palate. I could definitely have another or two."
"This one was a pretty good beer that I had tried. Not only did I enjoy the brew, but all of my friends enjoyed the brews tasted as welll. I really enjoyed this one, it was smooth, but this beer was very red in colour, it happened to be a really good beer, I will definatley be a part of this one again."
"Drinkability: Great session beer."
"Had this one from the can with the accompanying widget. Poured a light copper color with fluffy cascading white head. Aroma was not a dominant feature of this beer, but it had notes of caramel, toffee, and wood. Flavor was about the same with hop bitterness from start to finish. Mouthfeel was good. Drinkability was good as this goes down with little effort. The whole of this beer seemed to greater than the sum of its parts."
"Overall - I was quite impressed with this beer on tap. I was somewhat skeptical at first... a beer that looks orange-brown?! Then I gave it a smell.... not bad at all! Diacetyl perhaps? Well, something sweet and fruity, like a good Riesling... in any case, it was a delightful session beer that I am sure to have more of in the future. Looking forward to trying it from the bottle. Cheers to the Old Speckled Hen!"
"This is a very pleasant brew, pretty good balance makes it an easy-drinker. Doesn't really amaze you with complexity or bursts of flavour, but it's nice nonetheless."
"I poured this off tasting beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer was amber colored and poured a tan head with nice bubbles. However the head did not last long. The smell was bland and the taste was bitter and very flat or stale musty tasting. I will not buy again."
"Poured into a pint glass (not that is was necessary with the clear bottle) this brew has a nice light amber color with a thicker 1/2 inch head the settled into a nice cap leaving some lacing on the glass. An unusual observation was larger bubbles leaving holes in the cap, much larger than seen in most brews. The aroma is definitely hop heavy, but the smell is not overpowering. There are hints of some citrus and floral notes, along with some mild sweetness. The taste is above average, but lacks the bite I enjoy in a Pale Ale. This is much simpler and isn't as aggressive. Despite the larger ""bubble holes"" in the cap, the carbonation was on the light side, also disappointing to me. This was a decent brew that I could sip on for a while, but for the import price can find better."
"like it."
"D: Not bad. I could have another if I were so inclined, but it doesn't stand out so I probably won't."
"Very drinkable when served this way. I'll have to check it out in bottle form."
"Maybe this is what mung tastes like."
"Not a big fan of English bitters but my father brought this home so I decided to give it a try. The clear bottle is an immediate turn-off, the aroma follows suit. Horribly skunky, so much so that it blocks out any discernible beer aroma. The beer looks alright, though- rust colored with a medium, lasting head. The taste follows the aroma -- horribly skunky. Nothing really here. I really need to get this brew on tap and re-rate, the clear bottle was awful."
"Dry beer. Pours hazy gold with a big white head. Straw, stale, dank aroma with a sugary metal. Somewhat sour, but not in a good, hoppy way. Has a mild flavor that is tough to pin down. Kind of like hay, but not in a bad way. It leaves you a little disappointed, but not enough to complain."
"Overall: A medium bodied beer I thought ita was a tad bit watery. There is no finish."
"A good beer that I would like to try on draft."
"D- Very drinkable beer. I recommend it to everyone. I will say that this beer taste radically different on tap. Not a big fan of this out of a tap, but it is excellent in a bottle."
"A pub I used to frequent several times a week used to have this on draught about 10yrs ago. I have missed it as a highly drinkable pale ale with a lower hop but nice malty finish. I always got a decent pour and have only ever had slightly skunked occasions from the occasional bottle."
"For my first review this was a tough one nothing really jumped out at me but I would definatley drink this brew again."
"I tried this one out of the 500mL bottle purchased from the LCBO. Anyway, pours out a nice golden orangey color, looks real nice. Just screams tastey ale! Smell is also good, smells of floral hops and malt. Real nice. This is a really tastey brew, nice and bitter and smooth! Goes down nice and smooth then the hops kick in, very nice. I docked the mouth .5 because, to me it felt watery and not full, I was rather surprised at this. The drinkability on this one is good, once its at optimal temperature, it really goes down nice, and keeps sucking in you for more of this delicious brew. Good stuff. Highly Recommended!"
"D- from a different planet than the bottle, this nitro can is still as good, but in much much different ways. this ale makes me wanna party."
"Not my favorite."
"I had this with bbqed chicken, green beans, and potatoes and it hit the spot."
"Pours with the cascading bubbles like a Guinness can to leave a lightish brown body that is clear with a perfect white frothy head. Pleasant malty aroma with a little caramel. The IF is a little weak but not bad either. Decent malt background leading to a boderately bitter aftertaste. Very creamy mouthfeel with a mild carbonation and a dry finish. This is a decent beer, but I prefer a little more lively carbonation and hoppier flavor."
"D: I liked it, but everything seemed scaled-down. Nothing stuck out as a particularly strong flavor or characteristic. Easy to drink, just a little boring."
"D: Quite good...will & do drink again"
"There is some good here with Old Speckled Hen, but nothing really noteworthy... and given it's high price, this beer will likely get a pass from me in the future."
"Overall not bad. Might want to try it on tap or in a bottle sometime, I am not a real big fan of nitro cans."
"Overall: tried it. Next!"
"Very drinkable flavorful beer. Nothing spectacular, but very solid. Everytime I've had this on tap I've enjoyed it. Avoid the clear glass bottles it comes in, everytime I've tried it in that form resulted in disaster."
"It's got a fairly smooth taste. Drink this one cold, because as it warms it gets rather wretching due to the malt forward sweetness. Chewy and kinda light mouthfeel. An okay toffee caramel flavor is there, and the finish can get a bit bitter, which is nice. As a whole, it's just not a very outstanding brew, and the clar bottle gives some funly flavors due to getting lightstruck."
"Drinkability: Pretty good for this, not ""refreshing"" by any means, but a good beer to have every now and then. Could have a couple of these at once without a problem."
"A 14.9 ounce can of Old Speckled Hen with the wonderful widget inside. Pours an amber color with waves of microscopic bubbles agitating furiously about, each fighting for its eventual spot in the dense cap of foam which forms and then leaves a trail in its path on the way down. A husky grain aroma complemented by subtle earthy tones. Smooth and uncarbonated on the palate. Flavors of husky malt but sweet as well. More subtle hops provide a semblance of balance. This beer is smooth and highly drinkable. I have a soft spot for English ales and this is a fine one."
"I think I'd like this one a lot more in a bottle or on nitro-tap."
"A good English Ale from the nitro-can. I imagine it would be unimpressive from a standard bottle. The higher ABV seems a little out of place with this light beer. Still within session range."
"Overall a nice ale from the mother country. Peculiar enough to be interesting, yet normal enough to be enjoyed/"
"4/1/2005. Saw someone else order this at a local bar and it immediately interested me because I hadn't tried it yet (I thought I had tried everything there several times :-) Sampled out of the can, so it poured an amber body with a very thick, long-lasting head. Similar to a pour of Boddingtons. Creamy with a caramel maltiness flavor. Bitter and relatively smooth. Something just wasn't quite right with it though. Overall a decent beer and I want to try it again and figure out what exactly I think was missing."
"I like this beer. After a delightfully woody start, it is much more hoppy than the nose suggests with an almost minty fresh bite accompanied by just the right amount of carbonation and enough sweetness in the aftertaste to avoid being overpowering. A hint of the raisin I identified earlier on lingers on the tongue once the bitterness has completely subsided. This beer packs a big punch for the style and thus has to be well worth investigating."
"the taste however is not fruity at all .... cobnut with a hint of smoked almond and lots of charred wood (teak, basswood) .... nice bitterness, however a bit sourly ..."
"Had on tap at the Sierre Grille. This had a great, great appearance. Really extra creamy head that was an inch or two thick head. Colors were a clear, dark amberish gold color. Frothy aromas of creamy biscuit aspects with a slight spice to it. The taste was awesome with a sweet and spiced flavoring to it. Slight malt mixed with roasted coffee hints. Mouthfeel was excellently creamy, helping the flavors really come out. Overall, a fantastic drink."
"This is a really nice beer. Its orangish hue with nice lingering head is very appealing and unusual. The nose is subtle but distinctively malty. The taste is also mostly malty with a caramel sweetness that is very satisfying, and is accentuated by the smooth and thick mouthfeel. A well-balanced lingering hop bitterness finishes it off. For such a rich ale, this is pretty drinkable as well -- a nice choice for an evening with friends as the sun sets."
"Interesting beer with some nicely unusual aspects. Aroma is extremely pleasant very flowery and sweet with some bitter overtones. Pours creamy with a nice cascade effect that leads to a light amber medium copper color. Thick white head that sticks around and medium lacing. Mouthfeel is watery but the finish is decent. Flavor is weak compared to the awesome aroma but it is pleasant. Dominated by a sweet maltiness there is a nice subtle bitter finish. Being a true English Ale this one is rather nice."
"Old Specked Hen poured a nice light amber with one finger fluffy white head. The smell was light, but malty. Taste was loads of malty sweetness, with an ok hop bight. Mouthfeel was very creamy and nice. Drinkability was nice, with good balance, a good English pale pub ale."
"Always satisfying when I'm in the mood for a malty English ale. No problems enjoying multiple bottles in one sitting."
"Think I'll pass next time."
"Drinkability - A rich ale that is a joy to drink on draught. Can't wait until that next trip to the UK."
"Overall a pretty nice and well done british ale."
"Went down pretty easy, with a mess of creamy foam from the head clinging to the bottom of the glass. A good change of pace from over-carbonated beers and in-your-face craft brews. Definitely would get this one again."
"D : Easy to drink and a good English ale to go back to."
"This, the nitro can version of this drink is creamy and smooth and superior to the bottle in almost every way I can think of."
"In the world of Olde."
"A solid EPA and not bad from the nitro cans; in te past I always had from their clear bottles. A friend I had not seen in 10 years brought then over and I am now guiding him through the American Craft Beer selection."
"On tap at the Rose & Crown, Palo Alto. Served in a tall Old Speckled Hen glass. Superb presentation. Orange/amber with that creamy nitro-head, nice clarity once it settles, with constant racing bubbles. Armoas of toasted grain and carmel malt. Full malt flavors, with an initial sweetness that's pulled back into line by a subtle bitter finish. Medium to light bodied with a creamy mouthfeel. A perfect companion to fish and chips. This is what beer should be."
"I am a big fan of this beer. I prefer it on the nitro-tap. I feel that is how it is meant to be. The charged can is also a great pour. You need to be careful with the glass bottles because they tend to very susceptible to skunking. Hen is a lighter side, refreshingly simple beer. It does not have a lot of fancy flavor, just all around good."
"16.9 oz can. Poured a brilliant deep amber color and a soft creamy head that laced all over the glass while drinking. Drank this one strait out of the cooler and the aroma was quite subdued at first but after warming up revealed a subtle bouquet of cararmel and bitter hops. Taste was a bit metallic at first but cleaned up nicely after a few more sips. Finish is slightly bitter but clean. Respectable beer but not enough hoppiness for what I'd expect from an ESB or Pale Ale."
"I'd be interested to see if the same results came from the bottle experience. Probably wouldn't stick out among a larger list of imports, but it's in the top half, for sure."
"A true session beer. Drinks down well. Line 'em up!"
"Pale orange color with a creamy hed on top. Aroma is faint with a little creaminess. As for the taste, it's a bit earthy and sweet (like butterscotch). Hard minerals are noticable and the there's some drying husk for a brief moment. Very creamy mouthfeel, one which I dig of these nitro infused pale ales, and sessionable. This beer did the job washing down a plate of bangers and mash, and certainly the draft is a safer pick than picking up a clear bottle of it at a beer store."
"Notes: An ok beer. Nothing special. I would have it for free. I think it is over rated."
"Drinkability is very good, as the bottle will finish quicker than you believe. This is a truly satisfying ale."
"D: Pour me another!"
"I like pub ale. Nitro for the win."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"Drinkability is good as well. So smooth I could enjoy one of these all day. I feel this beer could fit almost all weather and circumstances as well."
"Poured a light amber color. Minimal head which passed quickly. Light carbonation. Smelled of floral, sweet. Very smooth and easy to drink. Maybe it's better across the pond, but I rather enjoyed it here. Would drink again."
"I poured from a bottle into a glass. The beer was a reddish copper color with a thin foam that dissipated into a thin line pretty quickly. I was unable to discern a strong aroma, other than a hoppy malt. The taste was much better than the smell. It had a fairly good malty, biscuit like taste on the front that finished with a mildly hoppiness. The mouthfeel was full bodied. Overall a good drinkable beer, but nothing special."
"This stuff is pretty good for an English pale. The brew is light brown with a tan head. A clean nose of mild malts and some quiet floral hops. The taste is primarily malt based, but has some soft bitter hops. A medium body is well carbonated. A good pub ale and likely better on tap."
"NOTE - This beer is always served at room temperature, or slightly below, at most English pubs."
"If and when I ever go back to England to visit, I wouldn't snub my nose at this brew in a pub, unless it's too over priced with the crap that's going on over there with the jacked up beer prices."
"Poured a brilliant deep amber color and a soft creamy head that laced all over the glass while drinking. Taste was a bit metallic at first but cleaned up nicely after a few more sips. Finish is slightly bitter but clean. Respectable beer but not enough hoppiness for what I'd expect from an ESB."
"I would not recommend this or try it again."
"D: I could easily see myself drinking a few of these in succession. The flavor is acceptable and balanced, though nothing to write home about. The light body and dry finish really beckons you to keep on drinking."
"D - Not my cup of tea. Anything with too much rye is bound to throw me off. Could compliment a bland meal very well though."
"Served by nitro tap to try and approximate cask ale, I assume. Amber colored with a finger of white head that lasts longer than the liquid. Leaves some really thick lacing. The nitro really gives it a good look. Smell is toffee and toast. Flavor is much the same with an earl grey finish that's quite dry. A little watery. Mouthfeel is very creamy but awfully flat. The nitro giveth and the nitro taketh away."
"Gets better as it warms."
"I remember liking this when i had a bottle of it, so I'll have to give that another go before I write this brew off."
"Overall- Bland!! Almost flavorless. Avoid!"
"14.9 ounce draught nitro-can. Served in a snifter, the beer pours a reddish/copper color with almost an inch creamy off-white head. Head retention and lacing is very good. The aroma isn't very strong, but I can smell some toasted malt, bread and caramel. Finishes a little bitter. The taste is a bit different compared to the aroma, it's nutty, there's also caramel, floral hops, bread and some butterscotch noticable. Mouthfeel/body is medium, and very creamy and smooth. Drinkaiblity is good too, it's easy to drink and not a bad choice as a session beer. I think this is a decent brew, it's worth a try. Not too bad at all."
"This was a very creamy nitrogen draught, like Guinness but an ale instead of a stout. It poured a bright golden color with creamy white head. It had a very nice amount of bitterness, and a well balanced flavor. It was quite enjoyable and drinkable (most similar to, and better than a Boddingtons)."
"Drinkability is truly almost exceptional. I find myself rushing to take another sip, and then another, and then another. This is definitely a beer I'll find myself calling for and searching out. It wouldn't be one that I'd rend life and limb for, so perfection misses out."
"good for an english ale , not out standing but good. Will keep this one on hand for poker night with the buds."
"This is a beer that you can get hooked on. Beautiful copper colour in the glass with a fair amount of effervescence. A very plesant fresh bread nose when sniffed. Creamy blond head that hangs around for awhile. Mouth feel is short. When drunk I enjoyed subtle fruit followed by a good hint of malt. A good bitters finish along with it being dry and crisp. A very nice beer to enjoy a chat with a pal."
"D: if not for the widget this would have a below average drinkability with a no thrill factor."
"Not the best out there, but worth a try..."
"D - Nice, smooth, easy going brew, very nice. I'd say this would be a sessionable pale, and it is one that I will revisit. Recommended."
"the aftertaste was a little sweet very pleasant for a finish"
"This beer was a very average English Pale Ale. Nice amount of hops, but slightly on the bitter side. The appearance was good, smell was slightly bitter, and like I said.. the taste was bitter as well. I could only have one of these.. I don't think I've ever realized, but I prefer IPA's to EPA's."
"I enjoyed the amber color in the clear glass bottle. This ale poured nicely and left a creamy head. It had a pleasant slightly hoppy smell, and was extremely drinkable. Nothing too exciting here, but definitely worth a try if you haven't already. A good session ale."
"The clear bottle allows examination of the color which is a nice clear amber. Sweet malt and caramel on the nose. On the palate it is quite sweet, a touch of the Belgian about the finish, which is not so much to my taste, malty and caramel. Restrained in the hop department. Very drinkable."
"This was one smooth beer. It's something you could enjoy all night, without the taste of your typical corn and rice macros. I'm usually picky with pale ales, but this one was easy to drink."
" ~ All in all I'm impressed with this English Ale. The ""Old Speckled Hen"" is certainly on my list of brews to tap into again sometime in the future."
"D = This is a pleasant enough beer, but it is a little too watery in the taste and little too thin in the mouthfeel. I will probably end up drinking it again though, because it is a fair representation of the style and I do like English Pales."
"Easy to drink. Easy to session. This beer serves it's purpose well."
"Mine was from a clear bottle and skunked fairly badly, but it opened up and faded a bit. Otherwise sweet malt smell. Pours rich amber with medium lasting head. Taste was malty, smooth, caramel, with light carbonation and basically no bitterness. Decent, especially if fresh, I'm sure, but this was just barely ok."
"D: Not the greatest beer in the world, but a good example of a nitro-bitter that could keep you content for the night."
"D: A definite keeper. This beer has a subtle complexity that kept me going back."
"When you need to take a palate (and mental) break from in-your-face hop bombs, intoxicating triples, and challenging imperial stouts, Old Speckled Hen is the perfect vacation."
"I think it's worth a try. When I'm really in the mood for a good English ale I would grab this. Of course if I want something darker, I grab a Sam Smith Oatmeal Stout or Nut Brown Ale."
"D - Very refreshing, wouldn't want more than two max! Oaky maybe three. Not a bad beer, I would recommend, but there are many, many better beers on the market for your money. Good effort!"
"Overall good flavor and outstanding drinkability make for a pretty good EPA, not the best example, but worth checking out, decent price too."
"D - This would be easy and quaff several pints in an evening..low ABV makes it a good session brew"
"From the bottle, this pours a nice light copper body with a thin yet resilient head that leaves nice lacing throughout the pint glass. The smell is rather sweet with a honey-like presence that is not evident in the taste at all. Conversely, the taste is rather bitter with a strong copper-metallic presence. There is also a fairly present sherry/wine-like taste at the finish that continues to linger into the aftertaste. Finally tried this, not wowed but not turned off by it either. Although I did not do this, I think this would be much better if paired with food."
"This pale ale did not strike me as being anything other than a bit above average. However, it was rather easy drinking and had a very perfected hop profile that stood out on the palate, but allowed the malt tastes to remain. It's a good ale, and I'd recommend it."
"D: Too sweet for my taste, but the smoothness of the mouthfeel makes up some ground in this category."
"Drinkability: I drink this one as often as I can. I just love the unique flavors of this beer."
"D - the drinkability is good. allthough i don't think i could ever make a solid session out of these, it has a syrupy quality that comes out after a few and makes it a bit satiating. i could do about 3 of these though, not bad."
"Decent and drinkable... an ok session beer."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied. Carbonation and abv are fine for this beer. Goes down smooth enough. Probably would be more drinkable if I liked it more. Pretty basic and straight forward. Not something I'd seek out."
"D: This a good english seesion with a bit more ABV than most. This is something that I would like to try on cask but there are others that I enjoy more but an OK beer none the less."
"Body is light and very creamy due to the nitro pour. Somewhat thin and watery but super easy to drink. A mellow anytime beer."
"Pours a brownish amber. Nose is almost non-existent I think. I feel like I am taking a whiff of a macro. Flavor is good. Nice and hearty, but there seems to be a bit of a bitter edge to it at too many points. Feel is a bit of a clogging carbonation but a decent enough liquid. Overall pretty drinkable. It is what it is. And this is basically more mass produced ale than anything."
"A sort of nutty amber color with a creamy nitro head that is a very light beige. Aroma is butter cookies and cream with a little biscuit malt. Taste is mild caramel, toffee, and orchard fruit with a little bitter hop finish. The mouthfeel of most nitro brews are quite creamy and soothing. The general texture and flavor makes me wish this was a cure-all for stomach problems."
" It was a shame I only received one in the basket but there were several other of the style that I will try this weekend."
"D - A big time session brew. It's light in body and alcohol content, but it's got some pretty complex flavors going on, and the mouthfeel is downright amazing. Plus, it looks really nice in a glass."
"Creamy to be sure but finishes a touch watery considering. Hardly any carbonated feel, although that's permissible for something mimicking a Real Ale. Drinkable without a doubt and I enjoyed revisiting a style that I used to indulge in frequently during my beer infancy."
"Poured fron nitro can into english pint glass. Poured a cascade of gold amber and white that finally settled into a gold amber color with thick cream like foam. smell is light stale biscuit with slight yeast odor followed by a even fainter earth hop aroma. Taste is slightly bitter without much of the hop taste, and slight burnt malt flavor. Mouthfeel is light body and thin but because of the nitro holds a semi satin finish. This beer while not the best english pale ale is not that bad and is really a easy beer to drink."
"This beer is quite different from what I usually drink but I would enjoy another one. It is very drinkable, goes down easy but gives you some interesting flavors if you wait for them. You have to hold the beer in your mouth a little bit for the entire flavor to come through."
"Amber color with a tint of Red makes it an interesting color already. It has a nice white head that is fairly thin. It has a very sweet aroma and it kind of reminds me of an iced tea almost. It doesn't taste like it though until the aftertaste. It starts out sweet and malty with a hint of fruity taste. Overall a nice break from different beers. The aftertaste is very smooth and it is a pretty drinkable beer. It has a really nice mouthfeel all around as well. Definately recommend this."
"D: This beer goes down nicely."
"I like this beer. I would recommend that they stop selling it in clear glass though. It's too good of a beer for that."
"Flavors of butterscotch, caramel, sawed wood, with a mild hop bitterness that surfaces midway and lingers into the aftertaste. Clean feeling, and easily consumable. It leaves a favorable impression, but isn't too suprising or bold. Slightly above average, but worth a try."
"D - Horrible. This was just about undrinkable. I seem to recall the canned version being a lot better, but it has been a long time. They should never have put this in a clear bottle."
"D - I'll be drinking more of this. Sure, not the most exciting beer but certainly a well balanced one. Probably the best canned beer I've had."
"It's certainly a good beer. Very smooth, just missing some of that bite that I like in a Pale Ale."
"Drinkability : une bonne bière dans le style pale ale"
"Poured out of the can nice, and had a nice reddish-golden appearance and an all right head. It also had a pretty good scent, interesting with a sharp tang to it. The initial taste is fine, but as it got to the very end of each draw, there was a sharp tang of whiskey. It may be how it's aged, but I personally don't think the beer should be over ridden by such a powerful and unbeerlike flavor. I don't think I'll try it again, although someone who enjoys bourbon a lot more than me may really enjoy it."
"Pours a pretty reddish gold with a very nice constant white head. Aroma is mellow sweet malt with caramel and light fruit notes. Taste is mellow as well. Light sweetness. Apple and other fruit flavors. Just a touch of hops are noticable in the finish. Very low bitterness. Nice flavor overall if a bit muted. Mouthfeel is creamy. Pretty drinkable. Interesting and a good beer overall."
"D: Light enough for me to enjoy a couple during an Indians game. A regular for me."
"Overall, not something I would want again."
"It poured a medium brown with a small head that didn't last for long. It had a very fresh smell and to my untrained nose there seemed to have an almost fruity characteristic to it. The smell was very pleasant, and I wouldn't mind having an air freshener that smelled like it. The taste is a little malty with some subtler notes towards the end that seemed a little like apricot to me. The mouthfeel is pretty standard with a middling amount of carbonation. I'd say this beer is fairly drinkable, but I can't imagine myself enjoying it more than a bottle or two at a time. I'm not in love, but I think I definitely fell on the positive side of the fence with this one. I'll definitely have to pick up a couple more bottles sometime."
"Chestnut brown with flashes of red, a few large bubbles on pouring settled quickly. Not much head but some lacing. Starchy smell. a bit of pine, carbonation barely visible. Taste is bitter, some yeast, a shot of tartness here and there. Thin mildly hoppy mouthfeel, swirling produced a milky way over most of the glass surface; crisp malty aftertaste. Overall this is a fine ale but doesn't really distinguish itself in any particular way."
"."
"Not a bad brew, could drink a few of these, but too many"
"Not too shabby. A nice, clean, simple ale with a touch of malt sweetness and enough hops to dry and tart-en up the experience. Pours a bright amber color that leaves more lace than I expected. Some caramel sweetness in the nose that is mostly clean and fresh. The clear bottle worries me but clearly this fellow hasn't been mangled by light exposure. This is the sort of brew one tends to think of when going out to grab a pint or two. This brew doesn't make it into my regular rotation but I'd easily take this before a macro lager."
"The mouthfeel is pretty impressive though, thick and syrupy just the way I like my beer, very mellow too. This was easily drinkable and I could suggest it to a lot of people I think would really dig it, I don't think it's for just anyone though, despite how mellow it is and the low abv."
"It's a good pub beer, i'll probably be getting it again."
"I tried this beer on reccomendation from Sam Matson at Red White And Brew in Florence NJ . It poured to a pint glass real smooth , Its taste is typical of the european ale's that I have tried. I am not sure about the availability elsewhere but Red White and Brew just brought it back so I know I will be buying it. It is a beer that I have told lots of people to buy and they have echoed my sentiments"
"D: Very High."
"Very balanced, creamy & smooth, resonating with caramel to open your eyes."
"Overall,,,,this is one of my fav's and i highly reccomend trying this one...very good with a sandwich and some hot mustard and nibbling on some strong cheese.Hell...this one is good anytime....!!"
"Pours a reddish bronze color with good clarity and a dusting of a head. Some skunky smells overlay everything, with some orange marmalade and crystal malts as the base. On the palate, sweetness and orangey malts come in initially, then some hop bitterness hits with a snap, along with a hard water flavor that's rough but short of Burton. Toward the end, the skunkiness comes out, comprising the majority of the finish. Mouthfeel is crisp with hop bitterness and light to medium in weight. Light carbonation, even for the [bottled] style. Overall, this is alright. I would prefer a brown bottle or a non-nitro can, though."
"D - one or two of these is all I could drink or would want to drink, for that matter."
"drinkability - one is good enough for me."
"D= With a smell and taste this noxious, I can't see anyone asking for a second."
"Poured from a 12oz clear bottle with no dating system into a pint glass. It was a clear orange/amber color. It had a good sized white head that quickly faded to a thin collar. Good carb and slight lacing. The aroma was not very good. Started off skunky then grew into a weird smell that I can't pin down - some herbal hops. The taste was also not very good. I had this several years ago and hated it. Thought I'd give it another try and see if I had grown into it. Big nope - just isn't for me. Don't recommend. (2.5, NA, ML, N)"
"Drinkability: I could most likely drink just this for a night and be okay"
"This is an old favorite I haven't had in a long time. It pours a beautiful clear coppery-brown with just a little head. Aroma is strong and malty. Flavor is richly malty, with some hop bitterness, not complex but smooth and very satisfying. This is a good beer to have with a meal, or at a party, or with good friends."
"Looks like a bottle of Copper Fox Whiskey in the clear glass container. Poured gorgeous copper in the glass, perfectly clear with a nice though small head that disappeared quickly. Not much in the nose other than a mild English malt, but the mouthfeel was surprisingly satisfying, with great, if relatively invisible, carbonation. Taste was all malt with a touch of bitterness in the end. Not too sweet. Very refreshing. A bit of alcohol as the glass got low (and the ale warmed); but I can see why this is a good call on tap. Wonderful example of the style."
"Aroma is slightly hoppy and malty like a good ESB should, Taste, very smooth slightly sweet/hoppy, i paired this one up with a light sandwich (honey smoked turkey, lettuce and tomato on a crossant) and it was a perfect fit... Nothing outstand about this beer however if i was in the mood for an ESB this wouldnt be a bad choice."
"Appearance in a nonic pint glass reminded me of jolly old England. Just a good looking ale, gold to amber in color with a slight lacing of billowy head to top it off. Smell was of malt sweetness with various fruits, maybe apricot and pear. It tasted like a consistently good old English ale. Sweetness from the malt was balanced just right with a touch of hops, probably Kent goldings. Just a glancing of fruityness along the palate. Mouthfeel was rather light; what you'd expect from an ale. Overall, this was just a great English ale. Reminded me of the old country. Could definitely make this a great session brew, if I could just get it more easily. Plus, you gotta love the name!"
"Poured from a widget-can, it gave the usual widget effect to the appearance (thick creamy head). The beer was clear amber colored, maybe just a hint of haze to it. The aroma was neutralish, mildly malty if anything, and the flavor was malt. Nothing exceptionally rich, just a good session beer with creamy mouthfeel."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable beer, well balanced and rich flavor. Very impressed with all the English and Scottish imported ales I've tasted lately and recommend trying some."
"Feels awesomely creamy in the mouth, and I could drink it all night."
"Pours a deep orange brown color with very little in the way of head, but what is there is white, creamy and lacy. Smells spicy, floral & hoppy. The taste is very malty with just enough bitterness to balance it out. Very smooth. Mouthfeel is fairly heavy without much carbonation there. Overall, it's very drinkable. I don't know if I'll spend the premium price on it, but I wouldn't turn one down."
"That was very enjoyable, a very drinkable brew that I could have easily had many more of. It paired very well with my ubiquitous corned beef Reuben with fries, and I could see it paring with any standard pub fare or a very mild cheese. I recommend this and would definitely seek it out again."
"Nitro can, pours with a frothy tan head, very creamy; the body's a rich mahogany. Nose is slightly metallic, sweet with dark fruits (raisins, some plums), finishes with a bready edge like saltines. Taste: opens far from the back with soft bitterness wrapped up in a grape-like sweetness; the middle is flat to me without much progression; and it closes on a very thin hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is light, as light as the style should be but still too light -- almost airy -- for my liking. Drinkable, for sure."
"D-a good mild beer. This is sessionable and a great beer on a hot summer day."
"D - Pretty good. worth a try, a nice ESB."
"ok drinkability. I liked this but I wish the taste impressed me more. I'll have to have it again soon."
"Overall, I like it, I will drink it again...but I hate the clear bottles!!"
"with an odd paint job, and not some barnyard fowl. Brits are wierd."
"This beer poured with a cascading effect from the widget. It settled into a deep copper/brown with a thick head. The aroma is hoppy with some malt characteristics in the background. This is a malty beer that has enough hops to keep it balanced. The mouthfeel is creamy and full. This is a smooth beer which goes down easily, making it a nice session choice."
"a pale ale"
"Creamy mouthfeel at first , later becomes quite watery. Goes down real easy. Great session beer."
"D - Easily accessible and a sessionable bitter with sweet creaminess and nice spicy hop dashes."
"I would luv to try this fresh, on cask."
"Overall a very refreshing English Pale Ale."
"D: Definitely a sub par English pale ale. I think this might have to do with the age of the bottle I purchased. Primarily lacking characteristic malt presence needed for balance. Mediocre flavor doesn't get too much in the way of drinkability."
"pours a clear whiskey color with a egg shell two finger head that holds to a quarter inch and good lacing to the finish. smell is of fresh mint and herbal aromas. taste follows the same with a hint of toffee malt and medium hop finish. mouthfeel smooth and balanced. smell and taste were unusual to me but not in a bad way. need to try again to really see about drinkability."
"Footnote: looked on their website and they claim that, ""In the premium bottled beer sector, Old Speckled Hen even outsells Newcastle Brown Ale!"""
"440ml nitro can. Pours with a billowing white head and the classic cascading nitro bubbles. Color is an amber/honey color. Smells very much of yeast or bread. Tastes of pale malt with metallic notes. Mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy, but unfortunately not nearly hoppy enough for my tastes. Some extra bitterness would've been nice. I suppose it's a fine example of the style, but i'd prefer something with a bit more flavour."
"Would love to give this beer a second chance if I knew it wasn't tainted. It shows great potential."
"It's a nice English pale ale, but I get the feeling that it loses a lot being in a nitro can. Has a bit of a personal significance, attached to a now-deceased family friend, so I might get it again for that... but otherwise I'd probably hold off until I could get it from a cask."
"I can see this being good in a cask, but as a skunked, bland pale ale, it's not too fun to drink. The aroma is a nose-full of skunk and the taste is dull, slightly sweet malt with mellow bitter kick punctuated by more skunk. Avoid the bottles of this. I'll try it again when I'm on the proper side of the pond for this beer."
"A pretty decent pale ale, would make for a great session beer."
"This beer is very drinkable, especially if you like your beers malty."
"Sometimes nitro tends to really kill off some of the flavors in a beer, but in this case it works alright. The pale malts show off pretty well, but there's a slight cigarette ash taste that I could have gone without. Flavor fades quickly after each sip, as the body is a little on the weak side. That being said, it is a nitro and goes down very smoothly. I'd have no hesitation about trying this on-tap if given the opportunity."
"Heavy Engliish hop flavors with some roasted malt balance but the aftertaste is all bitter metal. Not so good. This beer has an unidentifyable sourness to it that I just can't abide. Mouthfeel is okay and this beer slowly grows on me as I drink it but not enough to make me want to try it again. Why one of these when you could have a Royal Oak or London Pride?"
"Pours light copper with a white head that is short lived. Has a toasty malt smell. Taste is sour and nutty. The mouthfeel is bitter and dry esspecially at finish. Carbonation is low which added to the drinksbility. It was a pleasure to drink this beer and looking forward to drinking it again."
"Maybe a little heavy for a session, but a very nice Pale Ale."
"Ah, an oldie but a goodie. I first got into this on cask when living in England for a year. It wasn't until I returned home before I realized it was also available in our Ontario liquor stores. It's certainly different bottled than on cask, but it's still a very enjoyable drink. 500ml bottle pours a nice copper with no head and carbonation. Nicely malty with some hops in there as well. I think I'll always have a soft spot for this being my regular tipple at my Friday pub in Leatherhead."
"a very smooth mouthfeel and not at all thin like some others i've tried. Could drink this stuff by the litre easily."
"Overall impression: Definitely balanced toward the hop end of things. A slightly stronger, still sessionable beer. The nitro can probably lends itself a better offering than the clear glass. Still, there are other ESB's out there that are more worthy than this."
"The pour into my Sam Smith pint raises a modest one finger off white head that falls pretty quickly to surface lacing. The body is a bright transparent amber. The nose is a bit malty and bready, with a bit of English hoppiness. The taste is quite sour, with hints of the breadiness from the nose. There's really not that much to it. The mouth is very light, and the carbonation seems a bit high for this type of beer. Not a very good beer."
"""Just another beer"" - ie, pleasant, but nothing special."
"This one doesn't seem very appealing to me. I'm sure it's better in England when it's fresher. The distance it has to travel, along with the clear bottle, probably take this one down a few notches. I haven't seen too many positive responses to this one unless it's on tap or in England. See what you find."
"Pours out a still-looking copper body with a barely there head that eventually settles to a ring, leaving no lacing. Some decent maltiness and a touch of diacetyl and noble hop in the nose, but there's an odd aroma of rubber bands. Starts off with a bit of toasty malt then comes a bit of hop bitterness. All of a sudden this horrible flavor of rubber bands comes through and rides it out. Gross. Mouthfeel is so-so, nothing bad nor good about it. This is a pretty hard to drink beer. The rubber bands flavor and a weird yeastiness make this hard for me to finish. Maybe I got a bad bottle."
"Definitely a drinkable beer but not one I think I'd buy again."
"D: Not very tasty, goes down OK, not too filling, I think it’s better than Boddingtons’s but I’m just not a fan of the style."
"Got this bottle from beers of the world in rochester, stop by if you're ever in the area and be floored by their selection. Average looking brew, nothing special here, copper beer with a thin white head. Smell is quite off-putting, smells of corn, caramel and overall badness. Smells like a macro. Skunky in a word. Taste is equally unimpressing, caramel, sweet maltiness at the start with a very dry almost metallic middle that lingers all the way through the finish and hangs in your mouth indefinitely. Tastes like pennies. Stay away from this one, save those precious dollars for something else. Perhaps it went bad in that ingenious clear bottle of theirs, who does that?? Even so, I won't grace old speckled hen with a second visit to see if that's the case. Adios!"
"Mouthfeel is a bit creamy and highly carbonated. Altogether, the beer goes down alright. Not a treat, but drinkable."
"Picked this up on a whim, I see this sold a lot of places so decided to give it a shot. Pours a deep copper color with a foamy head thanks to the nitro widget. Smells sweet and fruity, almost like prunes. Tastes the same with some slight bitterness or metallic flavor, not a lot. Creamy mouthfeel. Overall I am not impressed, I'm not sure if it's because it was canned or something with the nitro widget, may review this again in bottled form."
"D = Drinkable."
"Typical euro pale ale style. Bready malt aromas and flavor, with a very subdued hop presence. Slight mineral taste. Pours a pale copper with a slight head. Very easy going down, refreshing. Better tasting than others of the same style, but not much here in the way of flavor or imagination. Solid sessioner."
"The taste is very smooth and sweet tasting, followed by some hoppiness. All the while, I detect some white wine notes. The mouthfeel is very smooth, but, there is some tartness. Would not try it from the can again."
"Drinkability: overall this is a so-so beer, but not one that leans towards the ""crappy"" or ""wonderful"" side of the scale. Worth a try, but don't expect much other than a standard fare English Ale."
"Beer that has a very nice color to it, probably one of the better looking beers I have seen. Smell was a little weak, but rather intersting and different than others. Taste is smooth with a hint of something I can't put my finger on right now. Good aftertaste as it goes down very smooth. Could drink many of these in a row I believe."
"First 5.0 I ever gave on an appearance. This beer poured a copper color w/ a nice almost peachy-white colored head that was fluffy and very appealing. Smell was subtle, nothing spectacular, some grass and nuts or something, hard to pick it up. Tasted somewhat bitter with a smooth aftertaste. Goes down fairly easy with little carbonation. Enjoyable."
"Definitely better in a can than I've ever had in the clear bottles. Smart move to start importing in cans. I might actually buy one or two of these on occassion now."
"A decent, easy-to-drink English ""session"" ale. Not very fresh - could be in transportation, and not overly flavorful. Still, decent enough to grab for an easy drinker."
"Overall - A tasty treat. I won't go out of my way to find it, but if I see it, and the mood is right, I'd have no trouble tearing a couple of these puppies down!"
"Drinkability: Stantard pale ale, good for a session, but nothing to savour here. Average!"
"I feel like is has a nice little English vibe. Fun to try, wouldnt go out of my way to seek it again. Not bad."
"Overall not something that I would try again."
" I consider myself to be a fan of English Pale Ales. To date this may be my least favorite. I found the acidic tart aftertaste be vinegar-like and wholly unpleasant."
"D - I was mildly surprised by how good this beer was. It is a nice English Pale Ale."
"Pours a clear copper color with an off white creamy head that sticks all over the glass. The smell is a bit skunky, medicinal and metallic that is slightly buttery and nutty. Taste is herbal with with a little bit of malt hiding in the background and a respectable amount of hops in the dry finish. Overall, an average beer that is nothing that I am dying to have again."
"The clear bottle was a bit of a negative, but beer pours to a golden orange colr with thick off-white head that reduces to a foam cap for the entire bottle, and leaves very good lacing on the glass. Aroma was a nice blend of hops and malt, and smelled somewhat like roasted nuts. Taste was somewhat bitter, and more of the hops, with alcohol becoming more evident in both the aroma and taste at mid-glass. Finish was slightly bitter aftertaste, but mostly smooth and a bit dry. I enjoyed the ""Hen"""
"Decent solid brew."
"Overall: Very enjoyable. I've had both versions and I prefer the nitro over the traditional."
"A red-like translucent colour. Dense and creamy head. Very soft smell of coffee and malt. A little hop smell on finish. Dry and bitter hop taste. Beer is full on mouth, good for drinking in cold weather seasons. Overall not a heavy beer, not that easygoing."
"Can: Poured an amber color ale with a medium white bubbly head with average retention. Aroma of floral malt with some fruit-like sweetness. Taste of floral malt is pleasant with some faint fruit-like sweetness and some slightly bitter finish. Overall this is a nice standard ESB that I wouldnt mind revisiting again."
"Poured an initially clody(from the nitrogen) medium copper colorwith massive slightly off-white creamy head. Beautiful lacing. Smell is pf caramel and toffee and very pleasant. Taste follows through on the smell with nice caramel and roasted notes to be found. Nice creamy and full bodied. An excellent brew with great drinkability. Good session beer."
"Drinkability: It was ok. I would drink it again but I wouldnt go out of the way to buy any. Maybe it was because it was canned. I might have to find it on tap and review it served that way."
"Pours a deep reddish copper, with a decent off white head and some lacing. The smell was pretty much all sweet malts to me. The taste starts with some caramel and other sweet and nutty flavours, before being joined by some spicy hops. Both flavours enjoyably lingered on in the aftertaste, with the hops being more prevalant. I found the taste enjoyable, with adequate complexities and a nice body. Mouthfeel was good, sufficiently carbonated and refreshing. I found it struck a fine balance, avoiding being too syrupy, but at the same time it had a medium body, and didnt feel too watery. I think drinkability is pretty good with this one, the beer is not spectacular, but has a very decent taste, and holds up all around, a definite session beer."
"D- I tend to lean more toward the bitter and hoppy range of pale ales myself and this just didn't quite make it. I prefer this on nitro than draft or bottle as it gives it a much creamier and smooth feel. Not real robust or rich but goes down easy."
"[Drunk among jogging beauties, across the way from a toothless bag man feeding pigeons and gobbling a pudding cup.]"
"the flavor was malty, hint of honey, bit of hopsack, with a clean toffee finish."
"Sweet toasty biscuit malts up front sweetness develops then is cancelled by bittering that comes in late near the finish...finish is lightly dry and bitter...but overall this ale is soft, 2 dimensional and unoffensive...not bad but fair and that isnt enough to hold this bock drinkers interests."
"Its light body makes it moderately drinkable, but the aftertaste begins to wear on the palate quickly. It is considerably improved when on-tap. Not bad if it's the best option in a pub (which is sometimes the case), but far from sublime."
"440 mL can with nitro widget - served in a nonic. After the pour, it cascades for about 45 seconds and settles to an unfiltered dark tea/copper color with low carbonation and a 2 finger almost white head that consists of insanely small bubbles that slowly recede and leave huge sheets of lace on the glass. Beautiful. However, it's all downhill from here. It smells sweet - almost too sweet - with a touch of caramel and it's rather flavorless, with light cardboard, caramel, maybe some vinous malts, and a mild bitterness at the end. The body is light to medium and fairly smooth, but it is really hard to drink and I came close to pouring it down the sink. I chose the can because I didn't want to risk a skunked beer from their clear bottles, but I'm not sure if I made the right choice. Doubt if I'll try it from the bottle, but if so I'll post a review."
"D: Tough to get this one down."
"D - Tasty with a very agreeable mouthfeel. Makes a great session beer. :)"
"All in all a good version of an English Pale Ale."
"Very drinkable and a pleasant change of pace for a Pale Ale...I mean English Pale Ale."
"Taste is perhaps a little sweeter than I normally like, with all that sweet roasted caramel flavour right on the forefront and dominating the palate. The pleasant thing is that the hop presence is more pronounced than the nose would suggest, which offsets the sweet stuff enough that I can enjoy it. An enjoyable citrusy sourness is present, and the roasted character is pleasant as well. Mouthfeel is a bit softer than I like, but typically British in that respect, and befitting the style. I enjoyed it, but after more than one pint this might get a bit sweet and cloying for my taste."
"D: for cool nights, tasty cheeses, it goes on and on..."
"In my part of the world (Sydney, Aus) there is the occasional pub that will have this on tap. I would rather have reviewed a draft Hen, than a clear bottle. I'll seek one out, and update accordingly."
"A well crafted English Pale. Flavors are tasty, but not overly complex. A good session ale."
"Easy to drink and tasty, a nice english pale."
"I could drink a lot of this, but the price was just too high. I would be just as happy buying a domestic pale ale. But if you can find it at a decent price, give it a try."
"An OK beer. Amber color with a thick white head and some lacing. It had a sweet, grainy aroma, pretty nondescript. Taste also pretty nondescript; sweet,bready, a little hops. Decent mouthfeel, and drinkable. I'm not a huge fan of most British beers, so I'm probably knocking some points off for that."
"It is at the lower end of being good"
"M/D-Medium bodied, lower carbonation than I was expecting. Always nice...but not something I pick up too often."
"Poured a crystal clear rich amber color witha thick white nitro head. The aroma is full of delicious fruity esters and a slightly herbal hop presence. The flavor is very nice as it has a superb balance of sweet and bitter. The malt is the first flavor you taste it is a slightly carmelly malt that is very smooth from the nitro. Then the hop bitterness comes into the flavor but it is still balance by the malts. The flavor of the bitterness is nice and herbal with a touch of a citrus like taste. Towards the end the malt drops out and the bitterness is left to be tasted by itself which to my taste makes this a nicely hoppy brew. The mouthfeel is very creamy and smooth from the nitro. I haven't had this in a bottle but after having this on nitro i probably wouldn't try the other as the carbonation would have too much bite. Very drinkable this is an excellent session beer."
"Pours clear bronze with a thin one finger head. Excellent retention but weak lacing. Aromas of toasted pale malt and a hint of crystal malt. Sour nitro tap taste upfront, toasted pale malt sweetness and mild floral hop flavor. Semi-dry aftertaste- very fruity and leaves a buttery diacetyl coating on the tounge. The low carbonation and medium body accentuate the slick mouthfeel. Low hop presence throws off the balance. Slight dryness in the finish helps drinkability but the diacetyl is the only notable character and it just seems kind of bland."
"Overall this beer to me is a good solid beer, but not unique. just a good beer."
"Beer poured a golden orange with a OK head to start. Nose did not detect much there. Taste was bittering hops with a slight citrus finish. Mouthfeel was light to medium bodied and fairly smooth. Drinkability was definitely OK to try as this was a sessionable beer."
"D - Quite nice. Could be more flavourful."
"Simple and easy to drink, I admit to enjoying many others of the style much more when in Britain, but since this is all I can get on tap in my hometown, it makes for a reasonable substitute."
"Cheers."
"D: I love this beer. I always end up extremely refreshed and satisfied after putting one of thse away. I'm not sure it's sessionable as it's very filling, but it's extremely drinkable."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Simple, easy, moderately effervescent texture that feels right for the style. Super sessionable, and that's really the key here. Nevermind swirling and swishing this one, this here's a drinkin' beer. Not my favorite, but enjoyable nonetheless."
"Light body."
"Final Statement: One of my old favourites. I went to Boston recently, and on my list of things to do was to get this on tap, which i accomplished at Cornwalls Pub."
"Speckled Hen is a mildly hazy copper with moderate carbonation. Head is tan, creamy, and of a medium height. Aroma is of sweet lightly toasted English grain with a touch of grassiness. Taste is also of toasted English grain, sweet and somewhat earthy. Herbal hops are in the mix and provide an edge of fruitiness. Overall Speckled Hen provides a mellow, balanced flavor that has enough complexity to keep things interesting."
"I had reservations about trying this in bottle form after having it on tap in England. Unfortunately it taste about the same, only maybe not quite as fresh. Same slightly overbearing alcohol taste that is always present through out the entire pint. Old Speckled Hen has won awards, so why don't I like better? I think the judges were in Greene King's pocket, lol!"
"D- It was a bit odd to see a Pale Ale that pours with a nitrous swirl but it was that taste that was more interesting. The can says it uses a special yeast to give it that unique flavor. I didn't care for the butter and butterscotch flavors and they sort of got in the way of the malt flavors. A bit more of a bitterness in the hops instead of a green floral flavor would balance out the malt bill."
"As basic as it is, this beer will always be my go to, my Miller Lite so to speak, because if it's hot out, slamming one of these is so damn satisfying!"
"Pours a medium copper with a small off-white head that dissipates pretty quickly and leaves little lacing. Smell is slightly sweet and a bit fruity, with caramel apparent and a metallic note hanging in the background. Taste is malty, with some odd fruitiness and a buttery note, along with a sour finish and virtually no hops. Mouthfeel is watery and flat, and drinkability is acceptable. Not one of my favourites."
"You could probably drink a lot of these in a row, but I would definitely keep looking for other beers to try rather than continue drinking these. I was faily disappointed in this beer."
"Light/medium bodied and decently easy to drink. Definitely worth a try."
"Drinkability is very good , I could have these for breakfast with an english muffin."
"The beer emerges from the clear 12-ounce bottle a limpid burnished copper with a substantial semi-creamy light tan head that after its decomposition leave a thick coating of lace upon the glass. Nose has nice malt sweetness, fresh and clean to the senses; the start is minimally sweet, the grain profile acceptable and the top light. Finish is peacefully acidic; the hops dainty but present, aftertaste is quite dry and lingers long on the palate. Been a long time since I sample this beer, and I certainly think theres room in my fridge for a few more, I like these mild beers when I just dont feel like having my normal over the top brews."
"Average beer at best. Probably wouldnt try this again. Maybe a brown bottle would be better than the nitro can, but I wasnt impressed."
"Overall: A good floral ale."
"light orange, aggressive carbonation but some pleasant taste of hops, a touch metallic finish. Good amount of lace and creaminess of head Very dry aftertaste. Have had mixed results from this brewery, and it seems the LCBO have a relationship so we see a number coming through. OK to share a bottle."
"Dglad I tried it, but wont have it again. I am confused by this one. It is like two different beers in one. Started like a porter, then switched to a Belgian, then finished like an English Bitter. Maybe it is just meI hope so."
"A nice one to fall back on. I certainly won't refuse it, although it's not an 'exciter.'"
"This beer pours a cloudy orange from a 440ml nitro can. Caramel predominates the aroma. Caramel is also present in the flavor, with some hop toward the end. Creamy mouthfeel from the nitro. Not bad, definitely worth a try (tough choice here, nitro can or clear bottle - I kind of like the nitro thing now and then, but I may have to try the bottled version - but I'm not thrilled they are putting it in a clear bottle, that's a lot of traveling and potential for bad handling)."
"This beer was a golden color with a thick creamy head. Lots of lacing left in the glass. The smell was fairly hoppy. The taste was bitter but very smooth. There was plenty of foamy head to sip up. You gotta love these nitro beers. I could drink these again. A good representation of the style."
"One of many beers that I am tired of passing on without trying. Glad I did. Quite Pale Ale-ish in nature. Moderately bready, caramelly, nutty, and hopped to balance. The nitro gave a terrific creamy texture while remaining clean and refreshing. Nicely malty and yeasty through to the finish. Lightly estery due to the fermentation and hopping adds to the complexity. Easy to drink until the finish where a lightly phenolic-plastic-ey flavor was pronounced that made the swallowing a bit tough. Otherwise, I'm glad I tried it."
"Drinkability-- Very drinkable English pale ale. I could imagine throwin back quite a few of these in an English Pub."
"Overall: A really nice pale ale, good aroma and great balance. Fault: It lacks a little body, but hay, I could drink this to I fell over (with a smile on my face)!"
"Taste: nice maltiness, bitter and hoppy. Caramel like in a caramel pudding or like the topping on a McDonalds ice cream. Although this beer is bitter, it is magnificently in balance and very pleasant to drink."
"Tastes- while I found the malt to prevail in smell, the hop bitterness won slightly in taste. Nothing too exciting, but there is a bit of caramel, and maybe even some medicinal notes."
"I'd be curious to try this on tap in England  I wonder if I'd like it more if I drank it fresher and closer to its home."
"A decent brew, but not for drinking in large quantities."
"Weird I have been playa hating this beer for years and yet here i am enjoying a glass of this same beer. All those memories of a anemic ale that had off flavours is no longer. The malty nose is very prominent, the taste is full and creamy hops with good malt on the backend. A quality English ale that sells for not a bad price in cans no less. Sorry OSH I will start to buy you again."
"It goes down pretty easy, but it's not impressive by any means. I don't think I'll be having another one of these."
"Not horrible by any stretch...but also not noteworthy. I guess I should've known by the fact that this 'English Fine Ale' has yet to be reviewed by The Long Beach Bum."
"Cheers."
"Bham UK"
"Pours a dull copper color with a head that quickly dies. Yellow-leather highlights appear when I hold the glass next to a lamp, but no carbonation is visible. Smells pretty good, like light, biscuity malt with a backdrop of reedy hops. An element of wet paper bag wafts through, but not enough to ruin things. There's a slight--but definite--cidery sharpness right at the top of the nosefeel. Going down, the taste is something like graham crackers or wheat bread dough with a suggestion of nectarine. The aftertaste is surprisingly full of mealy, dried green apple, and bitter, earthy hops spilling out of dusty burlap bags. Unfortunately, the beer stumbles when the deflated-cola mouthfeel catches up to it. Pinpricks of bitterness through the aftertaste aren't enough to prevent things from being a watery wash. Easy to drink, though. If this were coming out of a cask, I could do a session of it."
"I tend to have a pint of speckled hen from time to time, not my usual beer, but its still a nice solid ale."
"Mouthfeel is okay, but there is a bit of acidity perhaps attributed to the fact this beer comes from a can. Overall, a good session beer, especially with a meal. I would love to try this cask conditioned."
"Easy to drink but this is a bit light in the flavor department. This would work well for eating a bland dish like fresh bread or potatoes."
"Drinkability is moderate. I will enjoy another, but I don't know that I would call it a good session beer."
"In short, some bottles, at least from the LCBO, are better than others."
"A fruitty flavor, like a pure english beer, i try this beer from Carrefour, almost a year, a rare beer in my country, well ballanced ingredients, very flematic like english men, i visit its site regularly ""www.oldspeckledhen.co.uk", very attractive, its holding Greene King, its famous for good beers; recommended for a six o´clock with a snack or american food."
"Notes: nothing special, just good all around English ale"
"Easy to drink, and light on the palate."
"Looking a bit reddish in the glass and pours with 1,5 finger of foam. It's a pretty palealey taste although very dry and with a strong bitterness. The mouthfeel is oily and not so inviting. Bottle version is too carbonated. The taste actually reminds me of a wormwood beer I had at Appolo Micro Brewery in Copenhagen (yes, it's true!)."
"I got a nutty, wood, earthy type aroma that was heavily malted. Tasted more caramel than I could pick up in the smell but it was challenged by a mild hop finish. This brew has alot of flavors sprea out through each drink and changed complexity as it warmed up. Smooth creamy mouthfeel and extremely drinkable as it is interesting enough to keep my attention and silky mouthfeel is a joy."
"This is one of the better British beers that I have tried here lately. It is definitely worth a shot."
"Overall drinkability is low-average, because I really don't find myself wanting another after I finish the first one. Nothing special in these bottles, but it might be worth a try if you're looking for something easy-drinking but more flavorful than Bud, et al."
"The O.S.H. poured a light copper brownwith a big frothy head. The aroma was of hops, glue, and some wine, like a cabernet. The taste of it was also glue, malt and like 1% of smoke. The mouthfeel is light and easy, with the slight bitterness of hops on the end. This is a 100% session beer. These were so easy to put back one after another. Overall, it's not something I'm going out of my way again to get."
"Mouthfeel is light and clean, very drinkable. A wonderful example of fine English ale and one of my all-time faves, ultimately sessionable. Believe it or not, the bottled version is far superior to either a tap serving or the nitrous can (ugh). Find yourself a fresh, well-kept (clear) bottle and enjoy."
"I had this on tap at the Full Shilling, Pearl Street near corner of wall. Tasty from the brewery glass. Strangely it tasted like it would be stronger than the 5.2% listed. I initially enjoyed the creamy balance between the caramel malts and the English Hops. There were not many other options that appealed to me so I stuck to this stuff most of the evening. Could be a good session beer, perhaps a tad sweet, but not very remarkable otherwise."
"Orange in colour with medium carbonation. Aromas are of caremel malts, fruity yeast, and perhaps a bit of licorice. Flavors are about what Id expect from a typical bitter: sweet malt, goldings hops, cooked apples, a bit of spice, and a slightly woody note. The only flaw with this beer is its body, which is way too light... almost like a pale lager. Close, but no cigar."
"Drinkability: Not bad. Not nearly as good as the I&G, though; too unbalanced."
"Drinkability: This beer is fantastic on tap. It is exceptionally drinkable, earthy, and just great flavors to forget yourself in."
"Cute name. But I won't be buying the bottled version of this brew in the future."
"Don't bother with the bottle, the nitro can is an entirely different experience. I like it better than any taps I've had of it. Orange with maroon highlights, a near-bleach white head that was dense and at least three fingers out of two pours. Classic beer-book look. Can't smell anything but acid & bubbles but it's not offensive, don't want to take away too much for that. Perhaps a bit sweeter than some would prefer but this isn't an IPA. The sense of caramel, malts, and hops on the finish was consistent between each can's pour. The density makes it feel more like a decent thick stout or porter which I really enjoyed (the texture so to speak). Drinkable for most environments."
"This beer pours a golden amber color, it leaves a thin tan lace of head that disapates pretty quickly. Has a faint ""skunky"" oder with a finish of vanilla and hops. The taste when it first hits the palate is smoothe, goes down easy def session quality. The strongest flavors on the tounge are honey, sour grapes, with a malty finish. This beer would be paired well with some classic english eats such as fish and chips, or shepard pie."
"Overall: Not so great, especially for the money. The tap version may be better, but I find this one too sweet and too offputting to warrant further purchases."
"I must say that I was pleasantly surprised. In the store the color looked darker than the light brown it was. Not too much head. However, it had a good balance between the subtle sweetness I detected and the hops. The drinkability was quite smooth as the mouthfeel was good enough to savor each sip (or gulp if that's your style). I'd buy this one again."
"Old Speckled Hen looks great, with that wonderful nitro masking effect from the can and a big creamy head. It also has a very smooth, buttery mouthfeel. But other than that, it isn't all that great. Smell is just a typical beer smell, the kind of scent I associate with American mass-produced beers. Taste-wise its decent, with a nice mild, hoppy character, but that's about it."
"Fish n' chips would do just fine."
"The taste didnt finish as well as I wouldve liked but it is a solid beer for the flavor and drinkability. I can understand the Pale Ale of this as the hops really do come out with that roasted flavor. Not as good as the Tadcaster but as I said before its different because of the carbonation. Pretty good I must say."
"I'm glad I tried this as a draft instead of a bottle . . . I may have lowered by rating on appearance with the clear glass and very light color. Instead, I found a very impressive brew. this did not seem to be a Pale Ale in terms of hops. One of the smoothest drinks to go down, very creamy in taste and appearance. Great lacing and head around the glass. i only tried this in 5 ounce taster and may have a different opinion next time, but my initial response was great."
"Medium to heavier mouthfeel. I tried this on tap in NY, both were good. However, after a week or so drinking cask conditioned real ales, this was very average."
"The color is clear golden bronze, with a fine fine tan head. Pillowy and long lasting. The scent of river grass and piney herbal hops is what greets you at first, then a sweet subtle fruity malt aroma. It's wonderfully bitter, the hops takes precedence here over the malt, but it doesn't drown it. After a few sips and a bit of warmth, there's plenty of toasty malt to chew on - and it's all so smooth and refreshing. A very nice pale ale. I would order this over most of the usual fare we get here."
"Poured a nice amber in color, with a 1"" thick head with great retention. Not as much fins watchig this settles as a Guiness ot a Boddington's. The aroma is kind of soured vegetables. The taste is hoppy, but it has a unhappy sour tinge to it. The malts are slightly overdone(?). Not sure, just way too heavy on the palate (at least for me). The mouthfeel is pretty heavy, and does nothing for me. However, I don;t find it a complete loss, and still find this beer fairly drinkable."
"This one goes down like water. Nothing special but nothing bad either."
"A very average, pedestrian English Pale ale. Well, it does pour pale, and it has a decent head. Aromas are grassy and slightly floral, with a hint or caramel there. Malt forward taste with the grassy hops bringing up the rear. Smooth tasting, easy to drink. Not bad as English Pale Ales go, but not great."
"Dry and bitter with a crazy sour malt flavor. This is just a great example of traditional English bitter. The nitro can makes me yearn for cask ales. The bitterness really overpowers the malt, but damn, I like this. Hook me up with another."
"Served from a clear bottle into an imperial pint glass. Pours a nice, clear amber color, with an ample creamy head. Not much in the way of odor to talk about. Delicious from the first sip. This is a very well balanced beer; after getting used to the American super-hopped IPA's, it's great to drink something that so nicely balances out hops and malt. If I ever find a bar with this on tap, I may have a new session beer!"
"Thie beer pours relatively clear and amber with a light set of yeasty tracings across the top. I'm not too much a fan of these watery euro pales but this beer is greatly drinkable. It is a little bit offensive to the taste buds (delightfully) but goes down lightly and quickly. Not bad, not great. Try Tetley's or Boddington's instead."
"Overall, not too bad. A little light for me, but a good change of pace."
"A clean golden amber beer. Has a small very creamy off white head that coats the glass all the way to the bottom. The aroma has a very light malt sweetness with ahint of hop spiceyness. A hint of sweetness on the tip of your tongue with some bitterness on the finish. But the watery mouthfeel washes away all the flavor on the end."
"Well balanced for the style. Probably overpriced at most places and there are certainly better options on the shelves, but worth trying. The clear bottle presentation is scary and I have had some skunky encounters in the past with this beer, but this time around everything was okay."
"Drinkability- Brought back one of these from the UK in 1998, but gave it away to someone. Not bad, would love to try it from a tap in London."
"Pours a deep red-amber with a head that dissapears almost instantly. Smell is of the caramel malt with a tinge of citrus. Taste is well-rounded, but no hops to speak of and none of the bitterness that I am fond of in this style. To me it was a bit bland. As it warms, some of the subtler tones come out, maybe spiced apple and a bit of light yeast. The moutfeel is lacking something. Just doesn't hit the palate like it should. Maybe it was what I ate beforehand, but this ale is not the best of it's style in my opinion. Drinkable, though."
"OSH poured from the distinctive 500ml clear bottle, a clear copper tone, topped by a small but fine layer of cream-coloured head. At first, the head did not seem very consistent, however, after a few sips, the head actually began to form up, to become a little more velvety, but still remaining at about 1 finger. Appealing mixture of light red and rust colours in the beer. The lace, too, became better after a few minutes of sitting, and it then leaves thick sheets of lacing. The aroma is a delightful hit of roasted caramel, delicious Goldings hops, musty fruits, butterscotch, candy apple, maple syrup, cream and butter, raisins, light roasted meat, but of all these I get caramel/butterscotch the heaviest. OSH has an extremely mouth-watering, very English, aroma. Masterful English malt/hops balance. Initially the malt dominates the taste, bringing with it some fruity and buttery nuances. The middle senses the hops beginning their drying effect, and this follows through on the finish, leaving a noted bitterness, but absolutely nothing overwhelming; in fact there is just enough grassy herbal dryness to make this an outstanding English Pale Ale as regards balance, with the hops outdoing the malt in the finish perfectly, but not overly. Indeed, a balance which I prefer over some overhopped NA Pale Ales. In the long aftertaste, the hops bring some metallic notes, some sourish burnt toast from the crystal malt, and more caramel. Butter, raisins, subdued fruits, compared to the aroma, toasted bread, and fruitcake. The mouthfeel could use just a tad more fullness, as it becomes somewhat watery after a few sips, which adds to the drinkability while detracting from the mouthfeel. A very balanced British Pale Ale, and one which almost no one would find disagreeable for the style."
"Nitro pour at Chumley's in Lafayette. This has been something I've always wanted to try but has always been pushed to the back burner. Typical cascading nitro effect leaves this beer with a substantial creamy head atop of darker golden body. Aroma is practically nonexistent. Hints of biscuit are present but that's about it. Taste is very biscuity with malt dominating this beer. Hints of apple peak out around the finish. Smooth creamy mouthfeel. OK session beer. Not much to keep coming back, but nothing that would send me running away."
"Light brown copper color, slightly red. Pours with a 3/4"" head, and fades into a quarter inch layer covering the top of the beer. Smells very sweet, with a fruity tart smell, most likely hops presence. Taste is very vinous, with lots of fermented fruit flavors. Pretty good beer, very unique, I think I like Ol' Dirty Hen is better from a bottle than a nitro can."
"Old Speckled Hen is a pretty decent quaff. Like the bird that it's named for (okay, like the bird that the car that it's named for is named for) it glides along for brief periods without ever really taking flight. I found it to be enjoyable though and just might buy it again if I could be certain that my next bottle(s) will have avoided that razor-clawed, black and white, odor-spewing, beer-hating little bastard, as this one seems to have done."
"Damn tasty EPA, would probably be better outside of a nitro atmosphere. Going to have to find a non-nitro version. Definately a beer I would drink more often than not."
"It pours copper with a big foamy almond collar and moderate lacing. The aroma is bready, with caramel and some diacytel and a bit of fruityness from the yeast. A nice bit of Goldings aroma is also detectable on the nose. The taste is nicely malty with a noticeably dry yeasty finish. The hop flavor is moderate, but complimentary. Theres some signs of oxidization, a slightly metallic astringent finish being one of them. The mouthfeel is medium and only moderately carbonated. This beer is worth a try, but try to get a fresh bottle because it is prone to getting skunked."
"Very little here to encourage drinkability. It is actually better in the widget cans which at least lack the skunkiness. Stores in central Kentucky, stopped selling this by the bottle because of complaints similar to what I have noted here. If you can kind this from a fresh keg or cask, I would recommend trying it. By all means, avoid this in the clear bottles, unless you're certain they are fresh and have been kept away from light and extreme temperatures. The Old Hen,obviously, does not like to travel far from the coop."
"Nitro can poured into a snifter. It pours a medium copper color with one finger of creamy white head. Some lace. The smell is malty and light, not too much coming out in the smell. The taste is the same, malty, but there's not much else there. A little more bland than what I'm used to. The body is light and watery (damn nitro) but the drinkability is alright. It's there."
"All in all, not a superior beer."
"500 mL can with clearly marked best before date on the bottom."
"(500 ml clear bottle, now available in Norway). Pours with a beautiful brown / dark golden colour with a moderate to low head. Inspiring glug-glug sound due to the shape of the bottle neck.This classic English ale has a moderate malty aroma and a pleasant malty flavour with a good bitterness. Very nice."
"This beer was a lovely mahogony color topped by a creamy thick head which resembled egg nog. Good lacing about the glass. Smell was hoppy and a bit sweet. Taste was really a dream being a sorty of cross between a smooth creamy caramel and what I can only describe as something like whiskey. Very bitter in the mouth, but it left a good lasting impression on my tastebuds. A pretty damn good beer, I may say!"
"This beer poured a nice amber with a nice head that stuck around. The smell was the downfall of this beer. It smelled as if it were skunky. It kinda smelled like a botttle of Heineken. I wasn't really suprised seeing that it comes in a clear bottle. The taste however was a very smooth sweet malty taste with undertones of caramel and toffee, with a light crisp hop finish. The mouthfeel was nice and thick with a full body. This was a very good beer with the exception of the smell. I can't wait to get a hold of another one. Cheers."
"An excellent export bitter, definitely in my top 10 favorite English beers available in the US. Also, far superior to the nitrogenated canned version of this beer (though I admit a prejudice against nitrogen-injected beers)."
"-Oelergud"
"After all this time I still love to see a good nitro beer settle. The beer pours a deep golden to amber color with about two fingers of very creamy head. The nose is nothing but sweet malts...no hint of any hop. Hmm. There was an overpowering metallic flavor in my first sip. Bad bad and bad. Its there again in the second sip as well. I just can't get past that. The mouthfeel is hard for me since I don't want to keep it in my mouth long enough to get much of a feel. The feel is thick, but it lacks the creamy texture I would want. I just can't get past the metallic flavor. It is still with every sip I take from the beer. I don't know if this is a function of the can I have here to drink or if this is common, I think if I do try it again, I will go for a different presentation."
"Sadly, this had a poor showing in the flight of British Ales tested. I suspect that it would do well against beers that differ from the pale ale category. Head to head, this one falls short."
"doesnt make much of an impression, though its not exactly bad. more memorable for its name than anything else."
"Overall: This is one of my favorite English ales - great flavor and smooth body. This is a highly drinkable beer and is highly recommended. This makes for a great session beer."
"Drinkability is average to slightly above."
"A decent session beer I think but was not overly impressed beyond that. Don't get me wrong, still an above average beer, but my palate has been spoiled by all the wonderful beers I 've tried, thanks in part to this web site. Color reminds me of a macro, Molsen golden maybe. Not much head to write of. aroma subltly sweet, and taste strongly of malts with not much hop character. An enjoyable English ale but again not one that I would be apt to include in my regualr drinking rotation. May stick to trying this next in England. am also open to revise my opinion after another taste."
"Clear, tawny-gold in hue with typical nitro characteristics such as the reverse cascading effect that helped form the solid marshmallow-like head of one finger in height. Sturdy head retention, as expected, the subsequent lacing was spotty. This is a good looking beer but doctored with nitrogen IMO. Soft, airy nose with weak, clean malty notes and faint earthy/herbal hops. There is nothing complex or loud in the bouquet, in fact it is a hardly talkative enough to be considered inviting. The nose can be summed-up as better than bland. The palate is a little tastier than insipid (is that a compliment?). Id say it is a tickle more tasty than Boddingtons. The malt is clean with a hint of caramel, there is short but crisp bitterness from the hops mainly at the back. Flavor-wise, the hops add a suggestion of earthiness. This is an easy drinking beer; almost good enough to be a session brew. Medium in body, with a creamy and moderately filling mouthfeel, typical nitro qualities, seems to be lacking a little heft but still the mouthfeel is okay. This is a likable beer, easy to drink. Ive seen this a few times in Iowa but Ive always passed because clear bottles scare me. On nitro-tap (or nitro-can) Id drink it again. I tried this at a British pub in downtown Minneapolis."
"Drinkability: Low abv and unintrusive taste make this a possible session brew."
"I won't buy this again. Probably won't drink it again. Completely unimpressive."
"1 out of 5 swills."
"Color is dark golden orange with a small compact foamy dusty browned head, lacing in broken strings. Aroma is of a weaker sweet malt base and some herbal, stingey grassiness, notes of buttered nuts. Taste has a strange grassy hop, very pungent yet weakly bittered and backed by a bit of a buttered toast-like malt with some sweeter things mixing in. Feel is slick and smooth, quite creamy yet unfullfilling in its body, a thin sided mediumness overall. It can be drinkable for sure, but for me the flavors and body seemed a bit off, perhaps this was about to turn skunky as these sit on the top shelves sucking at the light through its clear bottle. I've had this before and couldn't remember liking it so I thought I'd give it a go again. This may become a reoccuring theme with this beer, as its not to memorable."
"The dense head is classic nitro: creamy, cafe-au-lait colored with cascading. Once the show is over, there's a clear, amber-gold beer underneath. Fine, sticky swoops of lacing. A yeasty, bready nose. Taste starts tangy with a slight metal/fish nitro thing. Creamy and malty through the middle. The finish bitters gently, also showing milk and a little sweet fruit. It's light and tasty. I'm not religiously opposed to nitro, and I like the creamy effect, but it really masks the flavors."
"Notes: This is an interesting, drinkable brew. Not great, but far from bad."
"D&N: Nothing impressive here. I'm going to avoid this one."
"Good tasting but I like stronger flavored beer."
" taste is very smooth and creamy. very drinkable. the flavors i pick up are mostly sweet malt. i wish i had a case of it. i don't that it is as good in bottles though."
"The first beer from this six-pack had a slight skunky smell and taste. Fortunately, the others somehow seem to have avoided the curse of the skunk. It's amber with a thickish head that leaves little bubbles on top of the beer. The smell is slightly nutty but a bit on the light side otherwise. The taste is classic English Pale Ale. It has a pleasant malt sweetness with just enough bitterness to keep things interesting. It went down very well on a 90-plus-degree late spring afternoon."
"The taste is slightly adjuncty, sweet, and noble in being. If you like easy drinking semi-generic pale ales with nitro, this is a damned good one. The bottle is a bit more complex, and the Hen's Tooth is a more proper example of bottled real ale."
"Amber color body with a smooth creamy tan head. Smell is very musty and a little fruity. Taste is malty with a big yeasty flavor that I dont really care for. Mouthfeel is supersmooth. Not very drinkable because of the flavor. For some reason I just dont care for this."
"Interesting brew, makes me think of a belgian english ale."
"This was my first nito can, I actually liked the beer better in a bottle. The nitro added a weird aspect that, in my opinion, should be reserved for porters and stouts. I thought it hurt the drinkabality of a damn fine ale."
"this beer is one of the only beers that really ""wowed"" me. i feel the high scores ive given this beer are more than appropriate."
"A very easy drinking ale, not particularly exciting though."
"Medium bodied and smooth, pleasant but not spectacular, good session beer, not too high in ABV or too high in flavor."
"Not a bad ale, its robustness makes it a little hard to drink, much too yeasty and unbalanced"
"This solid session brew pours with the great cascading effect and large creamy head that the nitro can provides. The head is thick and white and lasts to the end. The color is a dark amber that is clear once it has settled. The smell is somewhat masked by the foamy cap, but there are hints of sweet smells that escape. The flavor is a slight tilt to the malty side with a bit of hoppiness to balance. Mouthfeel is very creamy with a soft feel going down. As I mentioned this makes an excellent session brew as it is very drinkable."
"Overall a nice flavorful beer. Goes down smooth and has a moderately bitter after taste."
"Real good experience, I would buy this again."
"A solid example of an English-style pale ale, with especially good use of malt and an excellent mouthfeel. Definitely one to try, and something I'll come back to from time to time."
"On-tap this beer was a dark/amber color capped by big creamy head that lasted for a while. It also had really good lace. The aroma was herbal/earthy. The taste was slightly metallic with some sweetness and elements of caramel and citrus. I didn't care for the finish. It seemed to be metallic/grassy and dry with a bit of astringent aftertaste. I've tried this beer a few times and it never tastes any better."
"Taste is creamy pale malt with hints of caramel followed by some well-balanced hops and light citrusy flavors. A light hops finish but it does it's job in this subtle ale. Very creamy with a light hoppy aftertaste. Nothing earth-shattering here but a pretty fine, smooth-drinking brew. Much, much better than the bottle. I'll get it this way or on tap from now on."
"Poured from a nitro-can, the beer looked beautifulperfect, thick head with a creamy consistencytoo bad I always think its a big gimmick. The color is a burnt golden hueIt really is attractive. Biscuit like, bread aroma and flavor. Moderate sweetness up front and subtle English hop balance. Very mellow, very creamy, very smooth. Its certainly drinkable, but its also restrained, understated, and polite. Not bad for a relaxing afternoon with friends, but Id rather reach for a more flavorful brew."
"A good beer to drink when with friends. This one pours a clear gold colour with a moderate head. It has a nutty aroma and taste that everyone will like. Well balaced with a slight hop feel evened out with the right amount of malts. Just a good one to sit down to every now and then."
"Upon opening, the widget goes to work nitrogenating the contents. Poured in a pint glass, excellent cascading effect, which concludes with a tall, thick head on the dark golden contents. Nothing much jumps out to the nose, but the smoothness of the product down the hatch is incredible. Pleasant bitterness, nice body, all in all, a great beer, and one of my favorites. Always a standby whether you're having one at the pub, or a few watching the game."
"A big thanks to noclueaboutbeer for hauling this one out to Kansas all the way from Connecticut."
"This is the first nitro beer I have had that I found enjoyable. Four pints of this put me down for the night."
"In the mouth it's clean and refreshing. It's very easy to drink, though the aftertaste kinda gets to me a liiitle bit after a while."
"Good. Beer."
"This beer poured a nice copper color with a nice white head. The smell is of caramel and malt. This beer had a very nice English quality to it not in your face and yet with some very subtle notes in the background. Not my favorite English Pale Ale but it is a nice example of the style. This is a very drinkable beer while this would not be my first choice it would also not be my last. I feel this beer is a little better then average."
"Pours a clear deep copper under a thin off white head that settles to film fairly quickly, leaving a bit of lace. The nose is big, with some malt, but mostly flowery hops and just of touch of cough syrup. The mouth is very prickly and surprisingly light for an English ale. I like the taste, starting with a bit of malt, but quickly transitioning to some fairly hearty hops and a bit of bready yeast. The hops linger nicely, with a bitter tingle in the jowels lasting well past the disappearance of the liquid. Not a great beer, but a perfectly respectable brew."
"Enjoyed this more on nitro than I did out of the bottle, with the cream adding another dimension to this beer."
"Not my cup of tea at all. I can get why it's so popular (been showing up on numerous taplines these past few years), for those who enjoy the untroubled and the uninteresting, but I can't forgive that awful smell, and will pass on this one from here on out."
"id never buy bottles of this, but on tap, im always giving it a nudge. and geez, why wouldnt ya? comapred to what else id be drinking in oppostion, i know where im at."
"A strong malty smell to the beer. No off flavours, malty with a dry finish, a middle road english ale taste. Weak on the mouth feel. Drinkable but not a must drink."
"Very appleish hop aroma, amber gold color, carmelly taste, the regular nitro smooth mouth feel, sweetness seems to stay but carmel taste disappears, what first seems creamy turns a little flat towards the end. Slight bitterness comes on at the end. I would drink somebody else's but would never buy a 4 pack"
"The feel is medium to full with a very fine crisp and clean finish. Very nicely drinkable - this could become a favorite quite easily."
"Orangey color with an off-white head. Flowery aroma and tingly mouthfeel followed by an oddly sweet burnt flavor. Reminds me (not kidding) of a burnt toasted marshmallow. This follows though in the aftertaste. This flavor is too strange, can't finish the glass."
"This one looked spectacular. Poured a copper color with a luscious tan head. Nose was of strong malt flavor, mainly caramel. Taste was also dominated by caramel along with slight fruit malt flavor and some dextrin sweetness. A hop flavor gives a little kick in the end. However, the flavors were light in taste and texture thus lowering my rating of this beer. This one is alright and goes down easy enough, but not worth the price in my opinion."
"balanced and very rich, some hoppy bitterness towards the end. Great first impression from the nitro pour; an awesome session brew, very smooth and quenching."
"If offered the choice (as I was) between the Hen and Stella, I'd choose the Hen any day. However, give me just about any Brit import or most NA microbrews."
"Sabina @ The Berkley Front is to blame. She's more surly than you-know-who."
"Passable, but not special."
"A good session beer, have some with friends. Obviously not a great but a tasty one."
"I must say I was indeed disappointed with this one. It poured a reddish brown colour (almost like watered down tea) which I typically like. The smell was decent and I grew quite anxious to taste it. ...and then came utter disappointment of the highest order. The taste wasn't actually terrible, it was just quite bland; almost bitter. Old Speckled Hen has almost no head at all, although it does lace fairly evenly and delicately. Mouthfeel is really not all that great, especially after enduring such grave disappointment that came with the taste. As for the drinkability, allow me to make mention again of the near bitterness in its after-taste. This wasn't totally terrible, but a huge let down never the less."
"If I could write the word ""bland"" and be done with it, I would. It poured the color it appeared in the clear bottle it was in, an amberish color. I couldn't get a head out of it. It just had a ""flat"" non-inspired taste, like drinking a dreary countryside. The last two frm the six pack have been regulated to the fridge for at least a year."
"This beer is an awful lot like the MG its logo is modeled after, Looks better than it runs.. The colour is nice a kinda coppery reddish brown colour. The smell isnt that strong but it has a bit of floral from the hops and just a bit of burnt sugar on the nose as well. Taste..well it looked good it smelled ok and tasted... Well it tasted just kinda boring.. There is some nice malt on the tongue and enough hop bitterness to make it well balanced, there were no over whelming flaws at all, it was just kinda boring. I would not turn one down but I would not go out of my way to buy this in the bottle or on tap."
"Pours copper amber with a cream hued fluffy textured off white creamy head. Formed huge thick patches of lacing with the nitro/CO2 mixture one complement toward the beer. Aroma contains slightly sweet malt with just a touch of roasted nuts and fruit some kind of berry. Taste is sweet but mild slight charcoal notes followed by rush of bitteness but still smooth all in all just lacking any complexities. Kind of tastes like polluted smog ridden air with the foul yeast tones trying to add some flavor to this brew wow, how can this be a popular ale from England. Mouthfeel is creamy but it's light thin and unfulfilling toward the beer lover's soul. Drinkability pass for something drinkable let alone extraordinary, damn was this beer trying to be good."
"The beer pours an amber color with a thin white lace head. The aroma is malty witha bit of English ale yeast to increase the scent. The smell of crystal malts hits you; a nice aroma. The taste is dry at the start and at the finish. The crystal malts that are so present in the aroma are gone. There is not much complexity here either; very plain. The mouthfeel is good. This is a light bodied beer. It drinks well despite it's dull palate."
"The taste was good but not the best. Again, there is a mat sweetess but this is a dry ale, not very much like other English Pale Ales I have had. The mouthfeel is very good, smooth and crisp. A refreshing beer for a night of drinking or as a thirst quencher. Not very complex but a simple ale, ripe for drinking."
"I think this had some decent underlying flavors, but may have been skunked a bit or is just off. Aftertaste and finish wasnt good and was thin. Overall not horibble though."
"This beer poured a medium white head with medium sized bubbles.The body had carbonation present and an amber hue.The lacing was good on the sides of my glass.The nose was that of hops as well as citrusy.There was a strong lingering bitter aftertaste observed.This was just an okay beer to me.Nothing special."
"fairlly deep amber color with medium sized whit head. very mild smell a little bit spicey and a little citrusy. a taste to match the smell, malty at the begining with the spices coming through somewhat, almost, but not quite cinnamony. slightest bit bitter at the end. body suited the taste i suppose it was a little thin, but not bad. i felt like this should have ben better than it was, no bad by any means, but kind of bland, gets better as it warms though. i will probably give it another try sometime."
"This brew poured a medium head of small to large white bubbles with a good lacing. Its body is a beautiful amber brown color with carbonated bubbles rising up the side of the glass. I smelled an aroma of hops and citrus. It has a fizzy hoppy taste that starts off slightly bitter and finishes slightly bitter too. Not a bad brew but it could be better."
"I have had this a few times and always think its gonna be better each time I drink it,its not a bad beer but just seems to be missing a little something.Pours a deep copper/amber with a light head,aroma is slightly musty and malty.A pretty big pale ale nice maltiness but I would like maybe some more fruitiness to it.It is a pretty drinkable ale for the big maltiness."
"Pours a dark orange amber color with a thin and bubbly white head that dissipates into a patchy lace. Nose is toasted sweet malts and grains blended with some caramel notes and a bit of wood. Not at all skunky despite being in a clear bottle. Taste is dominated by toasted sweet malts and caramel with some additional notes of mildly spicy hops. Finish is crisp and quite dry. A decent brew, but fairly unremarkable."
"Drinkability: I'd drink another - I just wouldn't go out of my way (at all) to find one if they all taste like that. Off-style with the (far too strong) diacetyl and fruit flavors."
"Rather surprising for something poured out of a clear bottle. White frothy head that makes a stage left exit the moment you turn your back. Cloudy rich amber hue, with an aroma of carmelized butter toffee, a touch of burnt malts. Possesses a butter toffee taste followed by a bitter/sour one. Difficult to tell whether the latter is due to hops, or being light-struck from the clear bottle, or a hint of preservatives. An ale that starts out strong but begins losing its character farther down the glass. Would prefer to try this one on tap."
"Pours to a deep copper color with orange hues. It forms a creamy tan head with excellent lacing. It has a sweet caramel malt aroma. The flavor is also of sweet caramel malts, with a bit of hop fruitiness. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. It finishes with a slight dry bitterness. Not a bad beer, very easy drinking."
"I'm not a big fan of beer in cans but this one in a nitro can seemed quite inoffensive. I've also had it in the bottle but wouldn't rate the canned version in a significantly different way. The impact of the widget did a good job of establishing and holding a head until the can was finished. As English pale ales go (or at least those that I've tried), this one seems quite typical and lacks the bite which I associate with many of the better American versions. A bit less sweetness would give it a better flavor profile but I'd enjoy Old Speckled Hen as a session beer any time."
"This is a decent beer, though I believe a little too sweet for it too be a bitter. Poured from the bottle into the pilzner glass, leaving a 1.5 finger head that lasted til the end. Pale copper colour with lace sticking to the edge. Wow, what a smell. Malt dominated the hops on the nose, but in a manner that was pleasant to the nostrils. Now a taste. Hmmmmm. First taste was a tad sweet. Too much malt sugarness. Second taste, more of the same. The bitterness comes out when this beer gets warmer, but that malt sweetness can't seem too come off my tongue. Perhaps it was because of the mild sweetness, but this beer seemed sticky. After every tip, I would smack my lips. This is an average drinking brew. Others I know could drink it all day. For me, I can' t overcome that sweetness, so 2-3 tops would be it fore I move on. Oh, it is a good beer, one worth trying, but I'll try others before I buy this again. Unless, of course, it's on sale."
"Happy Drinking"
"This bitter pours a nice amber color with a very thick white head. This head just will not go away. A buttery malt sweet aroma hits your nose, average. There is a sweet butter taste with a slight hop finish to give it a bit of a bitter taste. This beer is very easy to drink and has a good mouth feel. A good session brew."
"Plae amber color served with an off-white head. VG retention as well. Malty aroma with a hint of fruit. The taste is similar, again with a husky malt sweetness flowwed by some fruitiness. Then a funky bitterness comes in and it won't go away. The mouthfeel is a bit light, and the drinkabilkity is OK. I just couldn't get into this beer."
"This pours a perfect amber color that has a strong long lived head that leaves thick traces down the side of the glass. The beer is effervescent and more lively than champagne. The nose is rich with hops and buttery malt tones that are truly exceptional. The flavor is refreshing with a spicy maltiness that is well balanced with strong hops and goes to a warming feeling in the stomach. The hops are just awesome. The mouthfeel is excellent as well with a nice pillowy soft body that is quickly subdued by the hops. Very bitter in the middle of the quaffed finishing even more bitter, but leaving very little aftertaste for the amount of hop flavor. I am so glad I bought a few of the 50cl bottles."
"F."
"Comments: A decent beer, but probably one that I would not actively seek out. Would still choose it over any macro offerings."
"Not sure how this would be as a nitro draught beer, as a lot of other reviews have been. Doesn't seem like the beer I had would be nearly the same as a nitro."
"The taste is not complex, but very smooth. Mouthfeel has a slight tingle of carbonation that fades away into bitter hops. Buttery malts make up the majority of the flavor, in addition to a sweet caramel taste as well. Nothing great, but a very easy drinker and worth a try."
"Starts out with a good butterscotch base (diacetyl?) with a slight but noticeable lemon/spice hoppy bite. I noticed a slight tang, sort of an ""English beer from a can"" flavor halfway through that I found distracting. I've noticed this before in this beer - maybe it's a hop thing? Pours down extremely easy, with light to medium body. A nice session beer, even if there are others I'd prefer."
"Nice amber/copper color. A creamy, thick head topped the brew. Retention of head and lacing ability were good. Aroma of herbal hops and slight caramel malts. The mouthfeel was very smooth and creamy. This aspect, combined with a nice flavor, rendered the beer very drinkable. The flavor profile exhibited a nice little caramel/crystal malt backbone. The hops were not over bearing or citrus like as in APAs, but they accented nicely. They added a perfume-like and herbal quality. All in all, this was a pretty solid session beer."
"The taste is about the same like the smell, sweetish and a bit of corn. I don't think this is as very bitter as I've read on other sites, and here, but still there is a little of it. I think it has good drinkability, not because of it's abv because it's just easy to swallow. ;)"
"For my money, the best name for a beer that I can recall seeing (Perhaps a good frivolous beer forum topic). Sampled from the hand-pump at d.b.a. in NYC. In the glass this English ale is an orange-copper color with a moderate off-white head. The nose is fruity and toffeeish with notes of butterscotch. On palate, buttery (in taste and mouthfeel), malty and sweet. A very comforting ale, very malty and yet not cloying, with late bitterness in the finish. For me, the difference in this hand-pump version as compared to the regular tap version was a depth of flavor/character, especially the toffee and butterscotch notes."
"Aroma was a mixture of fruity dominance. Taste was thinner than I expected, and it was difficult to finish off the last few ounces as it got warmer. Flavor was well-balanced but nothing really impressive. Mouthfeel, due to the thick head, was good. Finished rather dry, which was surprising, given the 5.2% alcohol content."
"This beer does nothing for me....it pours a light amber in colour and cloudy.....head is limited with a slight island lace....aroma is a mild skunkiness....very full in body almost thick and the taste is bitter/sweet and lingering..........nuff said?"
"The longest lasting head that I have seen in weeks. A nice white lace that covers the entire glass and, um, stays. The smell reminds me of a Corona, and the taste leans towards a sour hops. Thats the biggest flavor I get, sour..but light. Not really impressed, to sour for me. The color is the best thing about the beer, its a nice burnt orange color. Lovely looking with the head."
"Pours a clear fairly dark amber with a small off-white head. The aroma is predominantly alcohol with traces of sweet bready malt. The taste is a sweet caramel and diacety with a burnt twangy aftertaste. Rather mild hopping, but blends nicely with the flavor. This is a light bodied brew and finishes slightly dry. I would consider this a session beer as you could drink several in a row ;-). Cheers!"
"First off I realy like this brew as you can tell the scores. A gorgeous amber color with a off white head that clings all the way down to the bottom of the glass. Amazingly smooth that makes for a great session beer."
"For those expecting the assertiveness of an American Pale Ale this beer will be a dissapointment, but for those searching for a closer approximation to a British session beer served in a Suffolk pub, this is a nice try."
"I noticed that several negative remarks pertained to this beer when the serving type was the nitro can.  This only reinforces my view that beer in nitro cans should be avoided if possible."
"Old Speckled Hen Strong Pale Ale: On tap.  I not overly impressed with this beer.  It looked great, huge creamy head, and thick lace throughout.  Although undoubtedly fresh, this beer had an annoying combination of cloying sweetness, with a background vinegar taste.  Pleasant, but just not up my alley."
"Hazy, amber-orange body topped by a thick, very creamy, deep ivory head that holds extremely well and leaves some very good lace. The aroma is limited (possibly due to the thick nitrogen head blocking the surface of the beer) with just a slight caramel maltiness. The flavor offers a nicely fruity, slightly buttery, nutty, and sweetly caramel maltiness that's balanced by an underlying earthy hoppiness. (I'm going to have to try a bottle of this to compare it to, as the nitrogen pour has clearly altered the flavor). The body is medium with a silky smooth and creamy mouthfeel from the nitrogen breakout and low carbonation level. Well balanced. Finishes with a gently lingering soft malt & hop. An interesting beer that is probably better on draft or in bottle."
"Once the smell of skunked hop oils receeded there wasn't much else there. A little disappointing smell. Taste was alright with nice balance, but it wasn't very exciting. I'd like to try this fresh on tap as well as the nitro can for reference."
"11/19/02 The bottled sample is good, perhaps superior although lacking in texture. The sour flavor in the middle is still present but less pronounced. Overall the beer just tastes a little worn out; the clear bottle and incomprehensible dating code don't help matters."
"If your buying the bottles, make sure (if possible) its fresh.  This can and will get skunked up if not handled properly."
"Aftertaste exits cleanly with only a mild hop, which does not linger."
"Clear copper in hue, topped by a typically creamy, dense & well retained nitro can head.  Light butterscotch & caramel w/ a hint of earthy hop.  Cidery sweetness upfront, ensued by moderate hop bitterness, bready grain & mild fruitiness...(but only if you concentrate.) Hop flavor is meager, but a touch of earthy Fuggles can be discerned.  Diacetyl becomes more apparent as the beer warms.  Finishes w/ fading hop bitterness & not much else.  Although Speckled Hen is a slightly above average nitro bitter, it still suffers from the blandness of the nitrogenation gimmick."
"Decent pour (nice cascade!) but the color and aroma were kind of on the bland side. Definitely creamier than most Pale Ales I have tried so it was a unique experience. However, the enjoyment definitely diminished as I worked my way through the glass. The widget is always cool though."
"Okay, I followed the instructions and let it set.  Had a fairly foamy head in the can.  When I poured it, it settled into a slightly more bubbly white head which left little lace.   The aroma was of malt and some floral hops smell.  The taste was flat and had a slight aspect of malt.  The mouthfeel was thin and watery.  Other people seem to like it, so maybe I got an old can.  I just can't find much that I like about this beer."
"I noticed this beer because of its packaging, a clear glass longneck.  Clear glass bottles as a packaging for beer have become uncommon and for good reason: light struck beer is terrible.  That being said, it was fine."
"A new offering from the local liquor warehouse, OSH made me nervous because of that skunk-bait clear glass bottle.  I knew it couldn't have been there more than a few days, so I took a chance, and I'm glad I did.  Nice amber color and a light tan head with decent retention.  A light hoppy nose with no evidence of skunkiness.  Great balance in the flavor between malt and a slightly citrusy hop finish.  Medium-bodied, creamy mouthfeel.  I will buy this one again, as long as I know it's fresh!"
"Deep bronze/amber in color with thick creamy head.  Faint alcohol smell with hint of sweetness.  Sweet malt flavor with floral hoppiness.  Very smooth velvetty mouthfeel.  Very drinkable."
"Forms two heads, one 1/2 inch thick ""milk"" head on top and one 3 inch frothing layer bellow. This effect lasts about 15 seconds. Very creamy bubbles. Copper-colored and clear when settled. Very non-assertive sweet malt flavor, subtle as white chocolate. Very quaffable brew, three deep pulls and the pint can be history. Very skewed toward the malt end, hops are just a brief pepper at the end. I can imagine numerous pints in an English pub but I think that the nitro can is better suited to the more roasted malt styles like Stouts. The nitro can masks lots of things, the bottled version is nothing special."
"I had the pint nitro can. Big fluffy, extra creamy head, that cascaded nicely. The color was orange to copper. It looked inviting. Smelled alot of floral and honey maybe. Definitly hoppy on the tongue. I also noticed more sweetness than I expected in a bitter. Overall, I thought it was bit thin and watery. After the initial burst of hops, not much else was very noticable. I will say, it went down very quickly. Which is why the Brits call it a session beer, I guess.  I think this might be a little more for tweed hat wearing, umbrella carrying, MG driving,  lymies among us. (-think of the economics professor in the classic Back to School. Just kidding guys !)"
"An average english bitter, nice and light, malty and sweetish with a bit of hops on the finish, better cask conditioned, if not its OK."
"The nose is flowery and mild. The head is thin to start with and fades quickly. The color is a medium orange brown that glows in the right light because of the slight cloudiness. The taste is a little thin and watery, but pleasant. I might have picked up a little citrus in the taste. It's a refreshing beer and the carbonation gives a little bite."
"nitro can.......of course pours a nice and thick head which sticks and sticks.  the smell was slightly of the can but not unpleasant.  full bodied mouthfeel which was slick and creamy.  nice balance of malts and hops.  nothing mind blowing but oh-so good.  i could drink many of these i imagine because it just slides down sooooooooo smooth."
"(Widget can or nitrogen draft version) My favorite widget can beer, but still suffers from the muted aroma and taste profile that accompany all nitro beers."
"A very true to style English ale. A good session brew and impressive when served on draft in the Speckled Hen glassware."
"This ale really surprised me..I'm usually not a big ale person but I really enjoyed this one..Beer was slightly bitter and sweet at the same time...Color was reddish amber and cloudy like a yeast beer...I'll be sure to get more of this in the future."
"I bought this in spite of my reluctance to gamble on beer in a clear bottle, but fortunately it had avoided 'beer sunburn.""  Overall a very nice ale, but it finished with just a little too much bittering, which seemed to throw it off balance."
"Notes: This is a fairly rich, robust and extremely drinkable Pale Ale. Makes for a great session beer as it goes down with no effort."
