" I got this out of pure curiosity and now I'm not sure why. I doubt I will get again unless I'm in an actual pub in England."
""
"Very good ale. Would choose this over most pilsners at a bar. Semi brownish color with hints of nuts & cream. Very smooth finish on draft. Easy drinkin beer."
""
"Very bland. It's like drinking poor tasting water with a slight bit of creaminess to it"
"Overall: This beer is all over the place. It smells so much better than it tastes, which is weird. I remember liking this beer a whole lot more before I got into craft. But honestly, I think it was brewed better back then, too."
""
"O: appearance and smell were great.  The taste and feel?  awful.  I was tricked."
""
""
""
"Not sure why people drink this. Pretty and creamy, but has a distinct taste that I associate with cheap beer, and got worse as it warmed up a little bit. Couldn't finish it. Creaminess caused it to be heavier than rice lager alternatives so it's not even much good as an ice cold binge drinking beer."
"Overall:  I'd take this over a Bud, Miller, or Coors, but that's about it.  It's not bad, it just isn't good. At all."
"By far a disgusting beer... Enjoy"
""
"On Nitro which I don't think helped it. Unpleasant smell, taste is ok but rough."
""
""
""
""
"Aroma is buttery and toffee-like, with soft floral notes.  Flavor reveals fruity undertones that I don't recall being there in the past. Seems oxidized. There's a bit of cardboard. Body is thin. Moderately bitter finish. Metallic notes surface late, and this is draft..."
""
""
"Smooth, slightly creamy, but too lite."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Creamy and easy drinking beer."
"I like the nitro but the taste isnt there"
"This beer is the smoothest creamiest beer ive ever tried i love it"
""
"Not bad, just not good either."
"This was just really weird."
"Great feel - very smooth"
""
""
"The smoothest easiest drinking beer that I ever had"
""
"Sometimes it's worth cause it costs 1.79 for a 16oz. But still..."
""
""
"Overall: Pass on this. It looks great, smells good, and is very drinkable...but it just doesn't have any flavor at all! I won't be buying this again."
""
"I really like the way this one looks as its poured fron the nitro can. Big head that dissipates slowly to finally settle to a half inch head that stays to the end. You do get a creamy mouthfeel with this one that is nice bet there is no visible carbonation. There was, for me, no detectable hop bitterness. There is a different taste to this that some seem to not enjoy but that I just found to be unusual. A mild low abv choice that pairs well with a lot of food styles."
""
""
"the worst beer i have ever had"
""
""
""
""
"I think I just drank watered down iced tea."
"Nice color to it. No bitterness. Smooth and creamy texture. Lacking in taste, tasted watery."
""
""
"Wow... Pretty awful beer from across the pond"
""
"Creamy & smooth with an average pale lager type aroma & taste."
""
""
""
"Overall: an okay English Bitter, but certainly too flat in feel for my liking. I'd really enjoy trying this one on tap instead of from the bottle. Nonetheless, decent for AU$83 for a 24 x 440mL case."
"I seem to keep coming back to this one.  Definitely better draft than in the can.  Smooth taste and very creamy head.  Easy to knock lots of these back at the pub."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"pours and sits in glass like a quintessential beer"
"Smooth style and very light. Easy on the taste and easy to drink. Cool and refreshing for a quick ""light and easy"" party beer or summer refresher on the pond!"
"Better than Hen's Tooth...still not as good as New Castle."
""
""
""
""
"This is a horrible beer"
""
""
"Creamy and good as any once you're a handful of beers in to the night."
""
"I do not write reviews."
""
""
""
""
"I love this beer. Not sure why it's reviews are so low."
""
"Good beer, fairly easy to find and satisfying. Has a nice smoothness to it with almost no carbonation, and a mellow flavor. Not very hoppy; however it has strong citrus tones to it. Nice pale, yellow head, with a moderate alcohol content. Pairs well with light fish (tilapia, trout, catfish, halibut, etc.) and cold sandwiches."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a great beer anyone who has a chance to enjoy one should."
""
""
""
""
"Boddingtons is unique because of its mouth-feel. Especially out of the pub can with widget (think Guinness). The best way I can describe the feel is velvety, definitely nitro-ish. The taste is very much like what you'd expect. Not too impressive, standard pub fare. Easy to drink. I would recommend trying it based purely on the unique combination of mouth-feel and taste. Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a nice burnt orange and gold color with a little cloudiness and a nice off-white head.  Smell is exactly as noted above. Very intense citrus and pine hops. Tastes  of citrus and fairly hoppy, but not overbearing, perfect for all night drinking. Light mouthfeel that goes down smooth and almost creamy. A very yummy brew!"

"O: while I wouldn't drive to the bar to get this one, I was surprised by the nice finish on the beer other than that the beer is fairly forgettable."
"Not sure I would call it the fair Guinness. It is a bit overly sweet and lacks complexity."
"Enjoyable for buying in a can. (I prefer draft.) Relatively smooth and creamy pour."

"Nitro can poured into glass. Thick, cascading carbonation. Settled to an almost 2 finger head. Smelled dry and malty. Malty, dry, not much hop if any noticeable. Creamy, but medium feel not heavy but not watery, no carbonation. I really liked this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Appropriately poured into a pint glass.  Beautiful cascading.  Super thick and creamy head.  Beer is between golden and amber.  Very subtle malt characters and sweet caramel aromas. Very smooth and creamy, not too much taste but I actually really like this.  It's extremely drinkable.  The start with the creamy head is nicely complimented with a watery/smooth finish."

"Outstanding. One of my favorites. Amber, foamy, creamy, just the right amount of bitter.....I love this one."
""
""
"Would I recommend it ? No, for my part I won't buy again. It's really special. But if you are in England you can still give it a try and see."
""
"Pours from nitro can a golden brew. Creamy head, lots of lacing. Hints of banana. A very smooth and refreshing beer. I almost always have one in my fridge. I sometimes use it to cleanse the mouth after a more complex beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"The blonde Guiness.  Not big on flavor or aroma, but a highly drinkable, smooth character.  Possibly a hint of honey hiding in there.  Multiple beers easily shared among friends."

""
""
""
""
""

"I really like this,  great flavor,  very well rounded.  It's not your everyday beer,  and you need to pour it and let it settle,  or you aren't giving it a fair shake,  but I highly recommend it!"

"Yikes... Is this really considered good beer in England?  If so than I am REALLY proud to be an American!  Smells like astringent mixed with rubbing alcohol... The taste is awful... Not sure what piss tastes like but I imagine this is pretty close... If I was in a desert and this was the only liquid I had to drink I would rather die of dehydration... Awful... Just plain awful..."

"Not horrible, just one-dimensional with a somewhat unpleasant aftertaste. Thin, as if a more flavorful ale was watered-down some. That said, Boddy was one of the beers that helped move me away from American macros many years ago, so some credit for that. Unfortunately, there are so many other more flavorful products on the market today. What was interesting 20+ years ago is unremarkable today. I read the review by kerouac from California and I think he nailed it; an easy beer to session."

"I've been helplessly in love with this brew since working in Warrington for a summer back in the early 90s. Always my first choice if an establishment carries it. The golden color is amazing and the low carbonation sweet taste is just wonderful to me. Man I wish I had a pint or 10 right now!"

"I know this beer tends to get really negative reviews, and out of the can I agree it's not great. However, there is something about this beer on tap that I just absolutely love. There is almost a honey like quality to the taste and it is very drinkable. When I go somewhere and they have this on tap, I will almost always have a couple of pints. I just can't help myself."
""

""
""
""

"Overall, I liked this brew. Would have scored a little higher if the bitterness was toned down."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours darker golden-amber in color with a large head that cascades down to a 1-finger white creamy head due from the 'widget' inside the can. Spotty lacing is seen which each sip. The aroma is of grains but not much else really. The taste starts out VERY smooth with the mild creamy head from the 'widget' followed by grains and yeast. Actually goes down easy and smooth with no bitter or harsh aftertaste. Perfect carbonation of this one. Overall, it's a good brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Pretty average and simple EPA. Nitro can is cool though."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: If it's on draft and it's happy hour, have one!"
""
""
""
"This is certainly not an awful tasting brew. All the components come across so lightly that the end result feels just slightly thicker and more flavorful than water."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a ""meh"" beer. Basically, I don't hate it. I wouldn't buy it again... BUT, if I went to a friend's house and he was like ""sorry bruh, all I got is Boddington's."" I would drink it still lol."
""
""
"A nice cream ale, some off notes in its taste."
""
""
""
"i wouldn't be against having this again but since then i've had better cream ales."
"I like this beer. It isn't complicated and does what it was intended to do, be a cream ale which is light and smooth and simply refreshing. It has good color and smell and it's great in the summer when you don't want a lager. And on top of all that, I like their little do dad in the can because it works. Done."
""
""
""

"Nitro-can poured into a standard pint glass at neighborhood pub. A light bronze tea-like color with a pinkish cast, with the to-be-expected creamy rich head from the nitro-pour mechanism. This brew gets mentioned frequently as a ""classic"" example of an easy-drinking but now thoroughly commercialized English pale ale and that does about sum it up. Aroma is subtle and initially difficult to discern, although one does get some tinny caramel malt and musty floral hops after a few good sniffs. Palate starts with chalky sweet grains and sharper than expected Goldings hop, eventually progressing to a more tannic grain and metallic flavor that becomes quite pervasive. Some peach and perfumed tea flavor notes remain somewhere in the stew but the overall metal and grain impression is difficult to shake. Thin bodied and very light, maybe a wee bit thicker than a canned bitter like Tetley's, with the expected creamy smooth mouthfeel from the nitro bubbles. Finishes faintly earthy and floral but again the main taste is astringent and somewhat sour. Because of this, I cannot really see myself sessioning this in true English pub fashion."
""
""
""
"Overall this beer is slightly better than average, but not much. It's very light in character and body. But the grains and caramel malts play well together. C+/B- is where I'm at on Boddington's Pub Ale."

"overall this beer is nothing special, a league above many american macro brews, but still a good refreshing session beer on a warm day with friends"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, certainly a respectable beer and one I'd choose over most domestic macros in the states, but not at the level of an artisan beer."
""
"Taste follows the nose. Husky, herbal, earthy and with a bit of bitter in the finish. I looked hard for any metallic quality and could not find any. The mouthfeel is soft and creamy from the nitro and it is a surprise if you are not expecting it. I did feel that the beer was a bit thin but not really bland and the grass and herbal , although not fruity offered plenty of flavor and texture. Just a touch of diacetyl in this to remind you of popcorn. Goes to the finish dry and with more grass and a moderate bitter. Husky earthy, grainy, grassy, pungent and herbal."
""
""
""
""
"In short, on a cool autumn afternoon, I doubt very much that one could find a more drinkable and enjoyable cream ale available in any store in America for such a low price. Put aside your prejudices that every ""good beer"" must have the exact characteristics of Pliny the Elder and try to enjoy a distinctly British style of traditional workingman's ale on its own merits. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised."
"Easy to knock back. Smooth and refreshing."
""
"I tried this beer from a nitro-can poured into a mug It had a good head about a 1/2 inch thick. Looked great but was all smoke and mirrors. Its like someone got a can and scooped some lake water into a can. This was an awful beer and I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Innocuous in the way that we thought Newcastle was. Definitely nothing at all of the extra bite/kick of something like Hobgoblin."

"Overall - Enjoyable, just not as good as I remembered, and definitely not as good as it looks. Still wouldn't turn it down if offered one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The most unique aspects of this brew are its aroma and flavor. The nose is extremely minerally; lots of metallic overtones that look over the biscuity malt aromas. Slightly perfumey; floral with a strong herbal scent near the end. Taste is very sharp, musty, maybe some corn adjuncts, biscuity, minerally and very chewy. Almost lightly skunky like a bottle thats been light struck, except that this was poured from a can. Extremely creamy mouthfeel; almost feels like a nitro poured draft beer. Very different from the American ales I am used to, and one that I would drink again."

"I would buy it again. Not my favorite, but given a limited selection and being in the mood I would drink it. It's strange, it is hoppy, but it does by linger at all. Not bitter but not sweet. Darker gold color for such a light flavor. Really nice packaging and advertising. The can likes to say ""import"" on it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This one is fairly easy locate and it is too bad it isn't better. Nice appearance with a large foamy head and a pleasant yellow hue. Taste is simply mediocre to poor. Tastes like some macro concoction with off-putting flavours. Nothing really in common with a real English bitter. Nice marketing though."

"Drinkability: Though nothing spectacular, I like it. It is unpretentious, the packaging is attractive, its appearance is inviting, and it makes for light and easy drinking on a beautiful and cool July evening."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I was unpleasantly surprised by how much this tasted like a less-carbonated Bud Light. The ""darughtology"" is a definite gimmick, and although the beer pours with a medium head and has a gold look and creamy feel, it definitely lacks real substance and is a forgettable experience. I suppose you could cut open the can and you would have a pretty decent dreidel to play with, but that's where the interesting characteristics of this beer end."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Over all I would say it is smooth. A little light on taste for a dark beer but very drinkable. Leaves you wanting a little more bite. Pours easy with a classic head that remains there until the last sip. My friend from the CZ really liked that (something the Europeans like i guess.) Without going into a lot of colorful words, it is the kind of beer you sit around at a Pub with friends and drink all night. Goes good with pizza, fish & chips and nachos. Enjoy!"
""
""
""
"This was an import that sung out to me from the racks of Wegmans. Sadly, my instinct failed me. This isn't bad... And I like it more than standard American adjunct lager beer, but I wouldn't buy this in most instances. 2.5/5"
"Overall it's drinkable but really not that enjoyable, and it tastes cheap. Much better ones out there than this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I am not to crazy about English Pale Ale's. It's pretty sweet. I prefer the american counterpart."
"overall: AI've lived in England and I guess I just don't like english beer. This however isn't even available in the UK, as it's their export version. Very watered down and the mouthfeel is horrendously absent, but the subtle Banana and cream flavors creep through to make something about this beer enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer, is a really creamy beer. The appearance is perfect, I ve never see a beer from can appear like just poured from a pub tap. Taste is a bit weak for the tipe of beer, but terrific if consedered that is in can. Really good, I will fdefinetly buy again!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O - If you're looking for a sessionable ale with decent presentation and a non-offensive taste you could do a lot worse than this."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-I haven't had a ton of english pale ales but I can tell this falls a bit short."
""
""
""
""
"From there it becomes an extremely one dimensional beer. Not much aroma. Pale malts and a little honey sweetness. The taste is virtually nonexistent and leaves a metallic aftertaste. Other than the thick creamy head this feels flat and watery. Wouldn't get again"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- this beer would problay fall flat if not for the nirto can. its pretty basic with a strange metal malt flavor most of ur bmc,ers would problay get turned off by. but i see what flavor this is here and for the style is pretty good."
""
"All in all I enjoy Boddingtons, as it is one of the few decent English beers I can get on tap in Southern California."
""
""
""
"This is a very creamy and smooth ale that will stay on my list of great beers."

"Four times out of five, this is my beer of choice when there aren't any specialty beers available."
""
""
"While we're on the subject, they need to bring Caffreys back to the US."
""
""
"Boddingtons is a terrifically easy and refreshing beer to drink for almost any occasion(though it is particularly well-suited for colder weather)"
""
""
""
""
"O - Goes down extremely easy. Though it could serve as one, I don't see it as a session beer for me, not quite enough to hold my interest. Probably best paired with a meal rather than drank on its own."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"However, I did NOT have the same impression when I have had Boddies from the nitro can. I thought it hat a somewhat bitter and chemical after taste. Not pleasant at all."
""
""
""
"In fact, I think the flavor and the mouthfeel are both flat. There really aren't many redeeming qualities that I like about this beer. I can session it and it's not horrible. But I most likely given a choice would drink something else. If someone gave them to me for free, I'd do a handstand and sing Gilligan's Island like I would for any free beer!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: If the taste wasn't watered down and subdued, this would be fantastic. As it stands it's a good session ale that has a great mouthfeel and looks nearly perfect. Sometimes that's all I need."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - The taste is lighter than the color. Its OK but not a standout. I'm trying different styles to decide what to brew for the summer and this is the first bitter I've tasted. Easy to drink, but not my favorite style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear amber with a fluffy white smooth nitro head. The smell is slightly sweet with some fruit and very mild toffee. The flavor is malty and quite fruity. Just a touch of bitterness, especially in the finish. The bosy could be a bit thocker. Nothing super special."

"I don't think the nitro aspect of this beer enhances it in any way. It just feels watery to me and that doesn't help the buttery, popcorn kernel flavor going on. Potential is there but it just doesn't work out for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
"Boddingtons is part of my effort to review the least interesting beer ever, and I may have succeeded. It's something that even a turn of the century librarian would find too bland. I can't imagine a situation in which I'd willingly want to drink this beer; unless you're the type to be distracted by cat toys, you'll likely feel the same."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Unfortunately, this beers high point was the pour. For such an impressive looking beverage, it came up short in a big way, like the 2012 USC Trojans. Good looking, no substance. Absolutely awful beer, not recommended for anyone. I ended up having to drain pour it, and that doesn't happen often."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Not special. I like nitro-cans though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Love the mouthfeel and the head. Flavor is smooth and easy to drink. Like to drink it when I want something a bit lighter. Even my best friend likes it and she does not typically like beer. She said it is a better alternative to Bud/Bud Light. Basically it's my go-to for something smooth and easy to drink."

"O - This is a different take on the English ordinary bitter and one that I really like. The hop notes are pleasant, but offset wonderfully by the cream sweet maltiness. I'm sure my rating is going to be significantly higher than the average, but I really believe this is an under-appreciated beer."

"i like boddingtons, and i dont care what anyone says about it. pours a nice nitro powered cream color from the can, but it does its thing much faster than a guinness, with the whole cascade process lasting just a few seconds. it settles into a nice honey colored liquid with an inch or so of foamy white head. the nose is pretty basic, and frankly quite bland. some english pale malts and thats about it. flavor is light and balanced, low alcohol, and perfect for sessioning. kind of tastes like a pancake. love the mouthfeel on this the most, it foesnt have much carbonation, almost like a cask pour, except that its cold. its real smooth and milky in texture. i could drink these all day. i know its nothing too exciting in terms of flavor, but its a classic beer in my world."

"bought this beer about a week ago. pours nicely from the can into the pint glass and produces a great head that last the entire time in the glass. goes down really well and i can taste a little honey/butterscotch in the aftertaste. all in all, i think its a good brew."

"Other than the appearance and mouthfeel, there isn't much to say about this beer. Nothing great going on, just a simple session ale."
""
""
""
""
""
"It feels light and slick, with diacetyl coming through."
"O: If you love malt, then this beer is for you. Creamy caramel toffee. No bitterness at all."
""
""
""
"Drinkability is high from a sessionability perspective. There is enough flavor to keep it interesting, yet light enough to not fatigue the palate. Better than I ever remebering those cans tasting at home!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a medium amber, big creamy nitro head settles in too quickly. Scent is very pale caramel malts, light nuttyness and some stale earthy and grassy hop notes. Taste has notable slightly stale earthy hop presence with mildly sweet and nutty caramel malts, faint fruityness. Medium bodied, nitro seems to settle out quickly. Solid, highly drinkable ale."

"It's very mild. Drinks more like milk than beer. I can see how someone who prefers a more flavorful beverage would dislike like beer. Still, it's not anything to scoff at. It's drinkable, and mildly enjoyable. I doubt I'll be seeking it out in the future, but I won't cringe if offered a glass of Boddingtons Pub Ale. You could probably pass on this one, but I don't think it deserves the scathing reviews it has gotten."
"Final Thoughts: I can understand why this beer isn't highly rated but I think it deserves credit for being very unique (at least for those of us who live in the US). It would be the perfect session beer for an evening in a British pub. Although it doesn't have much flavor to offer, there is nothing off about the taste."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear amber orange color with the perfect long lasting head. Scent is sweet with malts with some hints of grain. Taste is light almost like it lighter than water. Has this cheap grain taste while having a bitter crispness to it. It finishes with a chalky malt after taste. Not my kind of beer by any means."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I know many like to blast this beer for being bland, but I find it to be very refreshing and balanced, despite being quite mild. From what I remember, the nitro cans are also good, but not as good as having it on nitro-tap. Happy to finally review this, as I used to have it often in my pre-review days."

"Had on tap, poured into a shaker glass. Decent, creamy, off-white head with OK lacing. Slight floral, citrus aroma, mostly malty though. Creamy texture with a malty taste. Some hops were present, but I didn't think that they balanced the sweetness the way I like it. I had heard a lot about the beer and it wasn't bad, just not sure that it measured up to the hype...maybe it's me?..."

"500ml can. Pours a crystal clear copper amber with a small white lasting head. Aroma and Taste is of light grains, fruity with some light biscuit malt. Palate is a light body with very light carbonation. Finish is sweet light biscuit malt, grainy, light fruity notes. Flavor and aroma is a bit flat as well as the carbonation. Overall an ok brew not much else."

"Pours golden brown with an abundance of creamy head. Plenty of retention on the head and the clinging frothy lace lasted and lasted. A distinctly malty nose with a touch of roast to compliment. Mild and malty with a semi-dry finish. Definitely a beer meant for sessioning, but not too bad for what it is."

"My friend brought a 4 pack over to a very drunken game of pool, and really talked this stuff up.The can looked so inviting with its bright yellow color, and the name made me think it was going to taste something like that beer stuff in Harry Potter. It poured with a beautiful bubbly head and from across the room looked very appetizing. As I went over to claim my pint, I thought someone might have shit themselves, when suddenly I realized THE BEER SMELLED LIKE F**KING PUKE!!!! poured it down the drain and then poured wet cement down the drain to make sure it wouldn't come back up. Not sure if maybe they were just ancient stock from Publix or what, but oh god it was terrible..."

"O: That lingering soapy bitterness is a little distracting. It's not that it's a bad beer, but I was hoping for more, especially given its popularly."

"Too light, almost watery with some off-flavours. Naah."
""
""
"I love this beer as a light drinking with friends beer. Not too sophisticated, just pleasant drinking. It has a creamy feel, with a great flavour. One cannot expect a stout or a Belgian style flavour from this ale, rather expect simple and clean beer taste."
""
""
"Everything about this beer is pretty solid...except how it tastes and smells! It's metallic and off putting, sweet and grainy, thin and watery. This a very poor example of the style. Ignore!"
""
""
"This is a full-bodied ale, but very smooth and refreshing. The can produces a lot of head, but it's part of the experience. Serve very cold, either alone or with hearty foods, such as steaks or other meats on the grill. This beer has the ultimate draught can ~ it only pales in comparison to the real thing. On tap, this is my absolute favorite beer. It's as smooth and refreshing as a cool glass of water on a hot day, but full and rich as any quality brewed pale ale. This beer is my standard."
""
""

"A light bodied ale that has a little stale feel to it. Not my taste."

"Let me begin by saying I am not a super fan of British ales, with the exception of bitters. Take that in mind when reading this review. This is one of the sexiest pours I have ever seen from a lighter brew. Even with an experienced pour, the head will consume nearly 3/4 of the glass and quickly ""roll up"" the glass into a uber creamy 2 finger head. This creamy head sticks around. The nose is slight, but includes bananas and some malt. The taste is a disappointment from such an attractive pour. It's a little watery, with notes of bananas and very mild floral hops. I enjoy the creamy mouth feel and the brew isn't bad, it's actually very drinkable, but it's lacking in complexity and I wish it were more robust. All that said, I honestly have a similar view when drinking most standard British pub ales, at least this one pours sexy and has a cool mouth feel."
""
"Overall - This is definitely one of the better pale ales."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – Really the only thing this brew has is a decent smell and look. The breadiness was nice, but the herbal and astringent flavors really took away from it and as for its mouthfeel, a non-nitrogen driven nature may have suited the flavors better."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall not the best beer but not the worsed. The let-down of flavors really isnt cool but had you never seen the pour and had a close-pin over your nose when drank, the beers flavor isnt suffering... just nothing too standout about that."

""
""

"This beer tastes watery, build the feel is a nice medium bodied creaminess. It's slightly drying on the back end and slightly bitter, good going down if not great tasting."

""
""
"Gross, flat and bizarre. Im not a fan"
""
""
""
""
"Not much in the aroma, but faintly sweet. Beer itself is creamy and mild. Super high drinkability: no off flavors, and the nitro-cream texture goes well with the mild flavor. And while the balance is good, there's hardly any flavor there. Still, could be worse."

"Seems like any basic american pilsner or lager. Just not a whole lot too it other than appearance. This is a great aesthetic beer but a poor drinking beer."
""

"The beer is very easy to drink and is a great product to get a person in to better beer, but it still leaves much to be desired. I do remember it being more palatable on nitro-tap. Until then...2.5"
""
""

""

"O - I think Boddington's has its place as a beer to drink at the pub on a warm summer day. It's cheap, easy to drink and tastes...good enough. But I think compared to other cheaper brews, it falls far short on flavor. This may be due to the fact that it's been imported and didn't survive the trip, though I won't be able to say until I make another trip over to the UK and try it on-tap. 2.0"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Over all I thought this was a very good beer, i prefer a unique feel and taste in my beer, however after drinking the four pack of draught cans i had no strong desire to drink anymore as the creamy flavor really became over whelming. The beer is not great, not terrible, just good. I will be drinking this again."

"D: I could pound this. It doesn't carry the profile for appreciating at a sit down."

"I just love boddingtons on nitro tap. Clear straw with a creamy white head and mild carbonation. Very easy to drink with a soft silken mouthfeel. Soft hay notes, apricots, mild bitterness and low ABV, I could drink this all night. It's not a flavor bomb nor is it supposed to be. It's a very sessionable English pale, and in that, it succeeds in droves."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'v only had this beer on tap. Its pale yellow with a smooth creamy feel to it. Pours similar to guiness and it seems to taste better if you let it settle after they give you the pint. A little oily and just a bit bitter it doesnt finish as crisp as i'd like but it has that classic english feel and taste. Just grab the darts and a pint of this and your golden!"

"i have had Bodddingtons in a can and had thought not that much of it. when i had it off tap i was very impressed. It pours very nice and has a great pale yellow color.it has a very nice head to it, very creamy. It taste bitter like you would expect but has a very nice creamyness to it. the only down side i found is how low its ABV is. it could have a bit more bitterness too. i think this beer is a very good intro bitter beer if you have not had a lot of bitter beers."

"Overall, understandably a classic pub ale for its texture and smoothness. Not much depth, but that is not what you look for in a Boddington's."

"Food Pairing- I would say butter bc it just taste so bready but in all seriousness, maybe something spicy since the beer is malty and bready, so maybe like a crawfish etouffee."

"Body is brownish amber-orange in color topped by a creamy head from the nitro widget. No lacing. Earthy, light esters, and a slight metallic note characterize the aroma. The taste is similar, though some biscuity malts do come through in the flavor. Creamy on the palate, as one would expect from nitro. My main beef is that this beer is very one-dimensional in that the metallic yeast notes really overwhelm anything else that I can discern."
""
""
"Overall this beer is ok but is far from being a good example of an english ale. Make sure this beer isn't drank ice cold as it is much more enjoyable at a warmer temperature."
"O) This is not a great beer, but it is pretty darn good. If you like English pale ales, this one is readily available, and a solid option."
"Nitro beers suck"
"SOLID, NOT MUST HAVE!"
"T - a light flavor, hops are dominatei get a tiny but of malt in the background."
"O: Not outstanding by any means, but a comfortable choice for a casual social drink, which is most likely exactly what it was intended for."
"Overall: Once upon a time I thought this was a good beer. I must have fallen for the nitro mouthfeel as a substitute for taste, because this beer is really not that good. One problem with nitro is that it seems to leave a gaping whole in the flavor, and this beer is no exception."
"Pours a clear light brown with a 1 inch solid creamy off-white head that lasts. Foamy patches of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is pretty subdued with some malt/grain and nutty aromas. Taste is of sweet malt with nutty and fruity flavors and some citrus zest on the finish. A mild bitterness lingers after each sip. This beer has a low level of carbonation from the nitro tap but has a nice creamy and smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer on nitro tap but I really didn't care for it from the nitro-can when I have tried it in the past."
"On a second tasting, I tried it warm (never in fridge) and it was an improvement... barely. So if you like warm, flat beer, this is for you."
"Overall: For me there is no other beer quite like it. This can comes with a widget which results in that excellent creamy, silky head. Its refreshing, crisp and satisfying. The spice really shows in this beer. Average on the alcohol side. These go down easy and smooth. If you get a chance to try this beer, do yourself the favor and go ahead."
"O: There is nothing special about this beer. It's decent and very close to sub par. It doesn't benefit from being poured into a glass. I actually prefer it from the can. To be honest, I haven't seen a beer truly benefit from the whole nitro-can widget hype. My rating may be too generous. I defiantly wouldn't recommend. This is close to being called beer pong beer."
"O - Overall a terrible beer in my opinion. A few of my buddies liked it, claiming it was ""Smooth and Creamy"" as the label described. Planning to give it another shot. Stay thirsty my friends!"
"this is always a go to session beer for me. Pretty straightforward with a good creamy style to it. It won't blow you away, but it does provide some good flavor at a low abv"
"Dr: Easy to drink but pricey. That said, I'd have it again."
"There’s a pleasant body to this as well, a nice easy drinking beer. It retains its head as it warms and each sip gives you a foam mustache. Starts out sweet but with a mild bitterness on the finish. Dry, with something that reminds me (in my limited knowledge of vino) of a white wine. Light, flavorful, and highly enjoyable."
"Overall – A pretty enjoyable beer that has enough taste to keep it interesting throughout the glass and also make it very sessionable. Also the appearance once poured is really something to see. I'd drink this again anytime."
"Not the least complex nitro ale I've ever had; it's plenty drinkable and moderately tasty but nothing to write home about. I don't regret trying it, and I might get it again but it definitely won't be a priority. Worth a try if you love nitro beer, but otherwise it's probably something to pass on."
" Imagine a golden light copper colored beer that is creamy like Guinness, but no black coffee taste/smell/appearance."
"O: I do like the looks, and the color of the beer is very nice. For the price, it's decent, but there are better offers for around the same price point. I wouldn't refuse, but also wouldn't go out of my way to find one either."
"Overall: It's not awful, and if someone offered it to me, I would take it over a lot of other beers, but I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to have it again. I do think the can looks pretty cool, though, and has a classic look to it."
"Overall: Not really impressed with this beer. The only reason why I woudl buy it again is the cheap price."
"Drinkability- I thought it was pretty good. I would drink it again. Definitely good pub beer"
"I believe that if I had this beer on cask, I might be in love. I find this to be a very appealing English Pale Ale, one that I could drink all night. I know that it could use a bit more complexity, and if the cask could deliver that, I think this would be the benchmark for these so-called ""cream ales."""
"O/D - It was OK. Didn't taste much like anything but it kept me entertained while Russian football was on. The creaminess is a little over the top and it lacks flavour."
"A dirty yellow/golden color but with a thick two finger head that is extremely creamy. Light grainy aroma along with some caramel sweetness and a faint sourness. Thick creamy body but a light flavor. Honey and caramel malt flavors come through but finishes dry and with some earthy sourness. The most impressive thing about the beer is the creamy body made from the nitro. Not a bad beer but not worth the $8 for a four pack."
"The taste was extremely light, not impressive, and not really packing much of anything. Just light, little bits of floral and fruit. It was refreshing given the heat."
"Flavor is mild all the way, and even watery. I'll give it points for being ""creamy"" and ""smooth", yes, but this beer has little character or body. Thin and uninteresting, this is one to avoid."
"D: Enjoyable, but I expected more complexity from this otherwise very drinkable brew."
"Final Thoughts: Not to be rude, but this one can be sumed up in three words: apple flavored water. Just like that sexy brunette you know, she's got the looks but nothing much going on inside."
"Light to medium bodied with very little carbonation, this beer goes down like heavy water. It is slick and watery. A little more carbonation would go a long way here."
"O: Beer is quite tame even for an English Pale Ale. Nice for a change."
"O: This beer goes down easy, but I couldn't see myself going out of my way to try this one again."
"The mouthfeel was medium body, this beer was a decent beer ,not something fantastic, but definetely a go to beer if the bar selection sucks."
"O - A really good beer. Nothing mindblowing, but one of the best cream ales I've had. This is basically my default beer, since it's fairly easy to find and is so damn drinkable."
"This was probably one of my first nitro English ales. I gotta say I will always love the surge effect that the nitro had on these. This ale poured out as a clear golden yellow color with a creamy thick white looking head. The lacing sticks like a Guinness does, very nice. The smell of the beer had some light grainy malts on the nose and not a whole lot else. The flavor was a little too light also, but had just enough bitterness to keep me interested. The mouthfeel of the beer is very smooth, goes down super fast. Overall it could probably be better all around but for a simple brew it's pretty good."
"Pours a beautiful golden color with thick, frothy Guinness-like white head. Smells malty, perhaps some honey in there... not much smell. Tastes surprisingly creamy, even though it is a bit watered down. Lots of malts, slight metallic tinge, not much else going on. Not bad, not really a fan of bitters."
"This one pours a clear copper with a huge nitro head that slowly settles into a finger's of dense, creamy head. Aroma is primarily malty, with just a hint of sharp hops. The taste is mostly caramel malts, with some bitter leafy hops and a metallic taste. The mouthfeel is nice and creamy, but almost too dense for how light the brew is. The drinkability is alright. Overall, this is an OK beer, and an entertaining novelty for the pour, but really nothing special beyond that. The best part was cutting open the can and using the widget as a top."
"I was looking forward to a light, refreshing ale with low ABV to enjoy on a very warm and muggy July day. I should have chosen a lager. This ale could be a ""macro"" style ale."
"I haven't had this beer in a long time, maybe about two years ago when I thought this was a quality beer. Now that I know they're so many choices of great beer, this one kind of falls short since my palate has changed so much. The highlight to this ale is the look and feel. Taste is average, it's not horrible. The flavors are not as in your face as I like them to be. This is a good BBQ beer to have with friends. Alcohol content is on the lower side so you can definitely session it."
"However, it would make for a good refreshing ale on a very, very hot day. A simple, uncomplicated beverage that is borderline refreshing with respect to my palate."
"O – A tasty English pale ale, but a bit bland for my liking. Certainly not a bold drink, but easily drinkable nonetheless."
"Pours a yellow color with a on and a half finger creamy white head. Smell is faint, but is of bready malts. Taste is mostly like the head, very bready, some earthy hops in the mix, and a slightly sweet character. Goes down easy and is highly sessionable. On the whole, it's a decent EPA that does what is expected. Nothing outstanding, but not bad either."
"Cheers!"
"O - An ok beer at best. I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it but I could see purchasing it again given no better choice. Which I doubt would ever happen."
"Body feels a little watery. Very drinkable stuff though."
"D: A pretty bland English pale ale, and, partially for that very reason, it's incredibly easy-drinking. Decent for sessioning and socialising, but even then, there are better EPAs."
"Beer #5 from my China trip. I've seen this in the US but never tried it until now. I was pleasantly surprised with it as I normally don't care for English pale ales. This one had a nice creamy toffee taste without too much tea bitterness which usually turns me off on EPAs."
"I'm now totally convinced that any kind of ""nitro-can"" beer is a total joke."
"O - I feel like drinking this straight out of the fridge was a bad call. Should've kept it in the cupboard. I'm sure it would have had more impact and complexity."
"D: Pass."
"Overall this is decent...nothing to call home about, but quite tolerable."
"Overall / Drinkability: This is a beer that is all appearance and mouthfeel. Smell and taste are lacking. That being said, it is very drinkable - I could easily have another one if this was all there was but if there was other choices I think I would reach for a different pale ale."
"O - its a great session beer but outside of that its just another average beer."
"$2 per pint is what I paid....I got what I paid."
"Boddington's has a mild, creamy flavor, followed by a smoky, creamy, and maybe slightly metallic finish. It's an easy drinker; not my favorite, but if you find yourself in an Irish pub watching some soccer or even just hanging out, it's tried, true, and highly sessionable."
"O: Good British ale specimen. To enjoy in the pub"
"Overall- I have had Boddington's Pub Ale out of a can before but having it on-nitro-tap was a very different experience. This apple aroma and taste was very shocking but didn't offend me. What I didn't like that it wasn't like many English Pale Ales I've had in the past and so I can't give it the marks it deserves. Would be easily enjoyed by anyone out there but after this one went straight for a Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale."
"Overall/drinkability- This is one of those fun beers to get again every so often simply for me because of the nitro characteristics, its not certainly one I go to all the time as its overall a little simple and bland, but its a beer I will probably see in my life every so often especially when seen at a bar on tap,"
"Very nice to drink it."
"This beer is definetly a nice summer sessioner. Very thirst quenching and mighty tasty too!"
"Narrative: You said this would be the last time, you curse yourself, breath swilling cold in circlets from your lips, ""you ARE A BLGIUM ALE"" you told yourself that when you looked in the bezzled mirror, you told yourself when you fill up your handbag, dont sell yourself short, you can do this. A john approaches in a Mitsubishi Mirage, not exactly your market but hey, ""Belgium strong, what's your pleasure"" he looks displased...is it...my color? No...I look almost how I should.."" YOU? You're a belgium strong? I had you pegged more for a French farmhouse girl...whats youre into?"" He's judgmental, and I am nervous, he knows, he knows I am mediocre and he's smelling it as well ""I am into whatever can foot the bill sweetie"" He gestures knowingly that this baleful ale will be costly but ultimately fulfilling. The mighty 4 cylinder revvs towards consumption."
"The taste is very smooth and mellow. Very well balanced. Slight hop flavor, but not strong or intense. This is an excellent beer to start the night with, or for session drinking."
"T: Dear God, this was bad. It reminded me of licking a penny when you have a cold. There was this metallic taste that seemed to be the only flavor in the beer and even that tasted watered down like crazy. One of the worst I've ever had."
"O- A good beer to drink on a hot day. Nothing complex, eh, I'm not sure even all that interesting. But it tastes nice and drinks easy."
"This beer ours a nice creamy one finger head, but that’s to be expected from a nitro beer. The head is completely white, and the body is a pretty standard ale look, dark orangey, reddish color, with hints of gold. The body is slightly see through, but for the most part it’s hard to see much on the other side. I dunno, I mean it looks good, but the color and the transparency makes me feel like the taste will be a little light on this (and that’s considering it’s a nitro beer). This beer does not smell too good though, it smells like a mix between a Blue Moon honey moon and a Guinness, it has that faint honey smell, but also that sour, english malt smell, not much in the way of hops. I mean a part of me wants to say that this smells good because it does smell creamy and honey-y, but another part of me thinks it will just be a lame nitro beer with not much flavor, oh well. I’m reluctant to give this a 3.5 on smell, but I suppose it barely qualifies. Well this beer tastes like it smells, but the tastes are better than I thought they would be. The honey is very nice and subtle, not overpowering at all, and the malts are pretty well balanced in with everything. In the end you get a nice sour taste, I usually wouldn’t like this, but it adds some character, and that’s good in these nitro beers. All the way through you get a nice creamy feeling, which I know is common in nitro beers as well, but I feel like this one is really good. The mouthfeel is very good for an english ale, like I said, it’s creamy. This beer is also very easy to drink, it goes to really fast, without any problems. Overall there are a few bad areas in this beer, but it’s yummy, smooth and pretty tasty!"
"Serving Type: Nitro Can"
"Overall: Straight forward ale, no flaws, but no highlights."
"Pours dark orange with a frothy white head due to the nitro can. The foam rises neatly to the top. There is a faint smell, not much to speak of, but grainy and very subtle. The taste starts sweet with an earthy flavor that kicks in. No real aftertaste to speak of, but extremely smooth and enjoyable feel. The mouthfeel is the best part of this beer because of how creamy it is. This is an overall average beer, the flavor isn't great, but the beer is nice."
"O - I suppose this is what you get when you hear a beer name on a rerun of Friends. This beer will not be permitted in my fridge, even for temporary storage. Rarely does a beer get poured out....but this one isn't even worth finishing."
"D: Not a great brew, but drinkable by any standard."
"The fact that I compared this to seltzer water pretty much sums it up..."
"It's not a bad beer, very drinkable. It's not very malty, not too hoppy, and could use a little more flavor in general. I realize that's the idea, but still, my palate was searching for a flavor to latch on to."
"Overall: Why did I go and try this beer again? Why? I thought that I had enjoyed it before, but now that I have tried so many that are so good I know better... Sigh. Why must I no longer like a crap beer?"
"This beer is as creamy as any beer I've enjoyed. It is a medium brown color and has a solid head - not too big, not too small - the kind where you don't have to wait for the head to settle but will still decorate the upper lip with a beautiful beer 'stache. The creamy mouthfeel of this beer is it's best feature and it's weakest is taste, I'd like it to have a little more flavor. I'd recommend this beer to anyone without reserve simply due to the fact you can rip off the top of the can and pull out the carbonation device and bring it home to your child as a marvelous spin top toy - it like a box of cracker jacks, a prize in every can!"
"D - Extremely drinkable. Goes down really easy and doesn't weigh you down."
"Overall, this`ll do in a pinch. Its still better than the other garbage you find in Québec dépanneurs."
"Was surprised by the light flavors, but not bad overall."
"D: I'm just not a fan of nitro-can beers. I find them way too watery and hate the feel to them. About the only good thing about them is the appearance of the beer which is perfect."
"D- An easy drinking beer. Not the best English Pale ale out there, but its easy to kick a few of these back at the bar."
"Poured a clear medium amber with a medium sized creamy head that was fully lasting and had excellent lacing. The aroma was very light with notes of sweet bread malts, grainy hops and a and a mild doughy yeast. It tasted mild an slightly bitter from start to finish with the flavor lasting quite a long time. Mouthfeel was watery yet very creamy in texture and light to medium in body. Overall I would have to say the CO-2 disc made all the difference (it rolled up the glass like a Guiness). Although it was very creamy it was a bit to light."
"D - How anyone can rate this beer below a 4 for appearance or mouth feel is beyond me. I think sometimes we get a little precious about mass produced beer. This is a great example of a mass produced ale of quality."
"The CPJ"
"Poured from a can this has Guinness esque activity, meaning it's very foamy and smooth and keeps moving while you're waiting for it. It is a light gold in color and has a two finger off white head. It even looks creamy. The smell is similar to that of a Belgian pale. It has a nice honey sweetness. It smells great. The flavors too are similar to a Belgian pale with honey. I had this after a Poppaskull and the honey kept resonating. Again, it's very creamy making the mouthfeel outstanding, especially for the style. It's nitro tap smooth and drinks light. This beer is delicious. I can't believe I'd never tried it before. As another BA put it, this is ""white"" Guinness."
"Pours a clean orange-ish to yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, gingerbread like malt. In the taste, watery and a hint of gingerbread like malt. A smooth and medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry, small malt in the aftertaste. Watery and not much flavor. Maybe a in between beer, but nothing exciting here."
"Reminds me of a pale malt version of Guinness. I guess this has to do with the widget."
"The aftertaste really dampens this beer's drinkability. I want to get to a lambic to compliment the sweetness or a hefeweisen to make up for the lack of mouthfeel. Almost there, but not quite."
"D: I don't like this beer, if the only positive notes are in the mouthfeel and appearance it one I'll avoid from now on."
"Note: I really hate this beer and I wouldn't advise anyone to drink it."
"Pours a golden-copper color with a pretty big white head that leaves a fair amount of lacing, though not what I would expect from a hoppy style with nitro. Nose brings a bit of diacetyl along with some mild hops and a bit of bread crust. The taste is a bit of light bread and butter. Mouthfeel is low in carbonation on a low to medium body. Drinks fairly well. Goes down smooth though there's nothing too memorable about it."
"Drinkability - I could drink this beer all day long."
"Easy drinkable without doubt but I prefer a beer that has more attributes to appear."
"Drinkability.... after you get over the fact that you're drinking flat beer, it's not bad. Makes me drink faster just to get it over with."
"Boddingtons Pub Ale is a classic English Pale Ale. Had one just after work this evening (2/6/11). It's been a hot minute since I'd had a Boddingtons and I was reminded of just how good of an ale this is. England knows how to brew & I'm stoked for Liverpool taking out Chelsea today too!"
"Very thin flavors all around. Pretty watery tasting. Definitely sessionable."
"overall - the best thing about this beer is the nitro. aside from that its crap."
"drinkability is good - this beer drinks like water low abv - i could drink these all day long but the price tag is a little steep for what flavors you get"
"Usually poured on tap or from tall can. Pours a medium, frothy, white head, and a clear, golden appearance, with tiny roiling bubbles. There is a lot of creamy, thick lacing left down the glass, much like a milk shake. The aroma is almost undetectable, but one can pick up some barley malt, with effort. Taste is mostly malt, but there is some hop bitterness showing up at the end of the sip, which gives the ale a minimal bite. Mouth-feel is light to medium, and Boddingtons Pub Ale finishes semi-dry. Overall, this is a rather bland product, but I'd say it's pretty good."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. It would be easy to put several of these down, but if I wanted to drink like that, I'd choose a different beer. There just isn't enough taste here to hold my interest past the first one."
"I usually avoid cans, but after several positive reviews from some respected beer tasting locals, I decided to give this one a go. Pleasantly surprised. A quick pour from the can will give an effect similar to Guinness Draft. The big difference was the light amber color. The thick head could easily float a penny and left a thick lacing as I enjoyed every taste. The first impression is very creamy with a hint of freshly mowed grass. The finish is clean and light. This beer is very drinkable."
"Very mild with a slightly metalic aftertaste."
"Thanks to Chance for sharing this. The beer pours an orange-amber color with a white head. The aroma is bubblegum and grass. The flavor is grass and biscuit malt. Some light fruit. Thin mouthfeel and creamy carbonation. Pour mouthfeel. A little bit disappointing overall."
"RJT"
"Overall, this is an ok beer. I think it would go well along with a meal, just about any meal because it is so watery and neutral. I could probably have a few of these after drinking something a little more intense and flavorful."
"I enjoyed this beer and glad I tried it. It might not be my first choice next time but I will come back to it again as drinking it is a delightful experience."
"Worth the experience. Looks and smells great. But not anxious to try it again..."
"Has a less than aromatic smell and the has a bitter metallic taste. I did chug it down but near painful at the end. I would not recomend this beer."
"Well, into a plastic cup (I'm at work--friday beer cart) it's a nice clear amber color with a smooth nitro head, dense and lasting. Very grainy nose, sweet with only a hint of hops. Flavor follows the nose: quite grainy, though not as sweet, and hops but a distant impression, lightly felt. Not an interesting beer, not tasty... but it's better than the Bud Light and MGD 64 that they also bought for the beer cart."
"This pours a clear-light amber after the nitro-ed fizz dies off, leaving a thick frothy one-finger head. Light, earthy, yet slightly metallic smell reveals a smooth, well-balanced flavor that suffers mightily from a metallic canned taste. This is true-to style in terms of very faint hop bitterness balanced by overly smooth and buttery malts. Feels much heavier than you would expect from the beer's other aspects. All in all, I think this one is a very sessionable pub ale - satisfies, without demanding much from you or your taste buds."
"Nitro-can gives way to the cascading effect of colors into the pint glass. After settling, a perfect golden-copper color with a two finger head forms. Some hops, maltiness and metal in the nose. Taste is very smooth, with a touch of hoppiness that allows for a very mild citrus flavor. Slight bitterness in the aftertaste, very malty and fresh tasting beer. Some faint metallic can taste that lingers around on the taste buds. Mouthfeel is insanely creamy and smooth with a very mild carbonation. The drinkability of this beer is off the charts. Not a very complex beer, but it is one heck of a drinker for sure."
"Consumed on a cruise to the Mexican Riveria. Brought to the table in the can and a mug. Popped the top and heard the fizz. Poured into the mug and I am met with an amber colored ale and a bright white foam that stays the entire session. Unfortunately this was the highlight of the session. Very malty aroma with some slight hops possibly. Maybe a whiff of fruit in there too. After the first sip I am getting a metallic taste to start followed by some light hops and a long bitter finish. Dull beer. The drinkablility was very low as the metallic taste was tiresome and there are too many beers to try. I will say I would be happy to try this at the source someday and re-review."
"Transparent golden body topped by creamy white head that sticks around for a while. Aroma of sugar, floral, cream, and slight hop leaf. Cream, milk, slight cereal, flour, hop dryness towards the finish. Thick, creamy mouthfeel with little carbonation. Lacking flavor and containing no standout characteristics other than creaminess, this beer is average in all aspects."
"From notes. Poured into a pint at Elephant and Castle in Grove City, PA. Paired with fish n chips. Nice copper color and one finger head. It may have been the atmosphere but this is exactly how I wanted my brew to look. The aroma was nice and clean with a malt base and a kiss of hops. Body was medium and the mouthfeel was extremely creamy. Is the draft version nitro? Washed down my fish n chips quite well. Is it fantastic? No. Is it cool to have at a pretend English Pub? Yes, for me it was."
"Also, It's fairly cheap for an import. I It's just as good as most other British beers."
"D - A nice beer. Better than average and I'm generally not a huge Brit-beer fan. This would wash down some fish-n-chips rather well."
"This is without a doubt, my wintertime beer. Love the fact that it pours like a Guinness, but it is an ale. The lack of traditional carbonation allows you to drink more and not get that one gets from traditional beers. I wouldn't drink this in a warm climate, but once the temperature dips below 60˚, this is the beer I turn to."
"D - by no means is this unfinishable, but the late blooming malt finish is really the only thing that would keep me coming back. now if you'll excuse me, I have to get beer out of my keyboard"
"D - I was overall pleased with this beer. I could see how someone could knock a few of these back."
"D-the taste gets better as it goes on. this is the perfect drink to have after a good sitting of stronger beers. but i had to pick any beer to have a lot of...this would be far from the top."
"All in all, I enjoyed the beer quite a bit, I loved the formation of the head, and I enjoyed the aftertaste quite a bit. I would definetly buy this beer again and recommend it to someone who is just dicovering the world of ""good ass beers."""
"1pt can. Pours golden-amber in color with a huge, fast disappearing white head. Aroma of stale bread, yeast with some earthy hops and spoiled fruit in the background. Thin body. Flavor was bitter, earthy hops that produced stale, skunky aftertaste. Terrible beer that went into a sink."
"Pours from the can forming a thick, creamy, white head. The beer itself is honey/amber in color. Very little smell if any at all, I can detect creamy and a slight floral smells if I really concentrate on it. Taste is fruity, a hint of hops, and a creamy sort of flavor, all in all it is pretty watery in taste. The mouthfeel is creamy and ends dry. This beer is quite easy-drinking, goes down smooth, and is pretty enjoyable. Definitely one I would consider as a pretty decent session beer regardless of the occasion."
"M/D: A bit on the creamy side (thanks to the nitro and the creamy head), however this beer is very thin and lacks flavor."
"Other than that where's the beer? It is so mild and sweet it hardly even registered to reach American Pilsner levels. I'd still choose it over those, because at least it has something interesting going on. But it's probably among the most watery beers I've had. Plus that charming effervescence leaves pretty quickly so if you don't drink up you're left with just colored water."
"Bought this pint can as a single at a local food store not knowing the surprise that was inside. Poured into WWI vintage authentic German military beer stein because I figured a pint glass would not be large enough. Turned out that was a wise decision. My goodness, I exclaimed, when I saw the profusion of bubbles and foam. Beneath the abundant froth and lace, the liquid portion was a rich golden color lines of bubbles going up the sides of the mug. A delightful light hoppy and straw-like smell was noted. Taste was nice and smooth, very light with a hoppy crispness at the finish. Mouthfeel was also smooth and very creamy from the nitro. For a light pale ale, this is not bad, but not to my taste. For some folks it might be a fun beer to see the nitro-ness."
"Boddingtons in a can is alright. Boddingtons on tap is pretty decent. A solid English pale, if a bit light and occasionally watery in taste. In an english pub with few options, if I'm not in the mood for a guinness, I usually turn to Boddingtons. and I can't say I'm ever disappointed. Goes down smooth and definitely works nicely with food. I wouldn't seek it out, but sometimes, it hits the spot perfectly."
"It drinks like water as there is not very much flavor to the beer. I however don't want to drink another one of these because it is so boring."
"Overall: Beautiful appearance, not much else. I would drink this on tap though."
"Very drinkable beer - Not much to it as far as beers go - easily enjoyed and easy to drink ."
"D - Very drinkable and crisp, but a little low on flavor."
"Overall this is a good easy going season beer. Nothing crazy going on here just simple straight forward flavors. I like to pick this up from time to time."
"This isn't the best beer I've had, but it's not the worst either. Average, that's the best description. I won't go looking for this one, but if there wasn't anything else offered I wouldn't mind having another one."
"Check out an expanded review of Boddy's Pub Ale on our show, On Tap: http://www.taverncast.com/shows/taverncast-on-tap-03.mp3"
"D: Overall, an ok beer. While I wouldn't necessarily seek it out, I often select it when at a pub offering little to no craft beer options."
"D) Surprizingly filling -- one was enough for me"
"This is a pretty solid beer. My brother raved about this beer to me for a long time so I decided to give it a shot. It was pretty good but nothing special at all. I would recommend it but cannot say I would drink it much more. Fairly boring taste and smell but smooth and goes down very easy. If you are just wanting something to new to try give it a shot but don't expect anything out of the ordinary."
"Very boring beer. Not to much going on with this pub ale, looks great as it pours, and settles, but soon after that it all goes bad. Taste is soft very week and somewhat of a sweet bread type of taste. Easy to drink but does not offer to much for the palate. Okay for a once and a while but not really something to get excited about."
"D. see taste and smell comments."
"D - Hmm this is going to be a short review. This is a beer that looks nice and is very easy to drink but is boring that it's not worth the price."
"I do not think I would buy this again, at least not in can form. I am sad to say I could not even finish the glass, because I knew I had Full Sail's Barleywine waiting for me."
"I really did feel as if a piece of my childhood (you know, 21 years old, cough cough) had been lost, or tainted, when I revisited this beer. Such disappointment. But I should say, that disappointment was only because of my high expectations. I'd drink this over many, many, many beers."
"Had this one last night at the Robin Hood British pub in Van Nuys. Light bronze in color with that creamy nitro head. Mellow crackery malts with a hint a fruit. Finishes with somewhat of a mineral hop bitterness. Not too bad if there isn't anything better on tap."
"D: This is a really laid back brew that goes with everything with some notable qualities. That wouldn't justify a ""5" in and of itself were it not for one of these qualities which I find to be exceptional: This is the ONLY beer that I have had, to date, that I can drink warm, straight from the can, and enjoy."
"Update: Toward the end of this beer, the flavors started to meld together much better. The metallic aftertaste turned into a somewhat more agressive bitterness throughout the whole sip and was less heavy on the later-end. Not sure if it was warming up a little or breathing a bit, but I think my next pint ought to sit for a few minutes before I approach it."
"Drain Pour. Never Again."
"D - The finish brought out a wheaty flavour with time, but never really improved the taste. This beer is decently drinkable if you aren't looking to have a ton of flavour, just something cold. Overall, not very impressed."
"From the nitro-can, started as a full glass of thick, creamy foam. Slowly the foam turned over from bottom to top revealing a deep yellow beer with a steady half-inch foamy white cap. After that, everything went down hill. Grassy aromas with stale biscuit. Despite the dramatic pour, there was no carbonation to speak of. Light, stale malty flavors with a very light hint of pear and a stale bread aftertaste."
"You could sit and drink this beer all night long. I really do enjoy this beer, but put it up against a fine craft brew and it falls a bit short on character."
"Drinkability: It's water, it'll get down."
"Pours a hazy light orange colour with thick white head that doesn't dissipate and leaves a lot of lacing. Smells of mild floral hops with some fruity malt. Very dry flavour with a small amount of bitterness from the hops. Creamy mouthfeel. I used to drink this a lot a few years ago as I started to move to more flavourful beer. Still good enough to drink now, but it's just ok."
"D: I think it's very drinkable. It is the definition of a beer that would be nice to drink at a party and goes well with food and snacks. Low ABV means it will fill you up long before you feel the effects. It's not really a beer that I would have a craving for, but I could probably drink ten of them."
"D: I could tolerate a few of these, but not my session pick."
"D - Bitter without much flavor means I only finished this beer because I paid for it."
"This is a highly drinkable/sessionable brew that will go down very easily. I wish the flavors were a bit more pronounced, but overall, this is a pretty nice English Pale Ale."
"drinkability: not unpleasant, but nothing to keep you coming back for more, may be bitter enough to deter some expecting a more hearty or hoppy ale."
"Never heard of this so I picked one up off the shelf at a local shop. A quick look at my reviews will show the reader that I'm typically a pretty generous scorer on this site. This beer gets my first ""F."" Simply disgusting, I took at small sip of this and the rest went down the drain. The can in which this beer was shipped looks a bit like motor oil, the taste lived up to the billing, or at least a highly watered-down version of the same. It's astonishing to me that this beer was shipped 6 thousand miles when I would have had a much more satisfying experience drinking the local tap water."
"Drinkability: This beer is highly drinkable/sessionable, but lacks much flavor. Not a bad English pale ale, but very very average overall. I could drink this all day, but I would definitely want something more flavorful and with more character. This does taste like it would be perfect with fish and chips, though."
"Drinkability is good, though - really a decent beer, though not exactly one that I'd call well-crafted. Still perfectly drinkable."
"Poured a golden-amber, with very little head or visible carbonation, and poor lacing. Some pear and apple in the nose, but exceedingly caramelly and malty. The taste confirmed this; very little balance in the flavor, with a thin finish. The feel overall was thin and watery, which I'm sure makes it good for sessioning, but the lack of flavor contradicts that."
"Maybe this beer has a story, or a place in a culture or scene that I'm unfamiliar with, but in my scene, it has no place. Don't really see the point of it and it wasn't worth my time."
"Wow, I was recently in London and this really reminds me of the Real Ale I had there, different obviously but the closest thing I've had that wasn't on cask! Bitterness is very low and it's super well balanced, light carbonations and it's so hot that it's about cask temp, malty adn slightly sweet, overall pretty decent!"
"i remember this being a lot nicer. remember there being a nice honey quality to it. seems to be missing in this batch. pour is nitrocan. eye candy but nothing along the lines of appealing after the fun is over. nose of hay and a bit of lemon, color of hay. the palate was not as enjoyable. not sweet but with a strange bitter quality that wasn't malt backed. very one dimensional. will have to have maybe one more time in the future."
"It is easy to drink because it goes down like water. I wouldn't mind drinking it again as long as I didn't have to pay for it."
"Taste is much the same - drinkable but slightly unpleasant. In all the beer went down ok with creamy mouthfeel and served at refreshing temperature but wont go there again."
"Drinkability: decent beer but probably will look elsewhere in the future. I was at a Irish bar will little to choose from."
"Boddingtons pours a deep gold color. The beer has a very clean feel in your mouth that is refreshing, but this ale promises a taste that it cannot deliver. There is a very good taste hiding in the beer, but it is very subtle. Honestly, it tastes like a light beer in that it tastes like a watered down version of a beer, which is disappointing because there is a good, refreshing taste hiding there."
"I tried this beer on on tap on May 14, 2009 at ""Smokeless Joe's"" in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The beer poured a translucent golden-brown with a thick foamy long-lasting white head out of a can with a widget. The aroma was grainy malt, some hops, and citrusy notes. The mouthfeel was medium bodied with medium carbonation. The flavour was grainy malt, and some hops. Refreshingly good, but not outstanding."
"O: An unremarkable beer. Certainly drinkable but there is almost no character."
"I originally had this during my Boilermaker days for the beer passport deal over at Chumley's. I figured I'd give it another go, now that I've gotten further into the world of beer. It pours a clear light orange-copper (bronze, maybe?) topped by a half-finger of white froth that stoically hangs around for quite some time. The nose is nearly objectionable, with notes of funky wheat and corn coupled with bland puffed rice. Hmm. The taste comprises a very blunt bitterness (kinda like hard water), some very light wheat, and flowers (I think they're daisies). The body is light, with a light carbonation and a thickish, milky feel. Man, I think I remember something quite different, definitely less objectionable."
"D- I was able to keep drinking it, but I think only because I didn't want to waste the money I spent on it. Eventually I kind of got used to it so I'll just say it was an average drinkability"
"Overall: I only bought this beer because it was next to the Guinness at the liquor store. I was not expecting much, but I was very pleasantly surprised. Boddington's Pub Ale was average in appearance and smell, but exceeded your average ales in taste, mouthfeel, and drinkability. Try it, you'll enjoy it!"
"D - Very drinkable. I can drink this much easier than I can bud lite, which apparently has superior drinkability, if you believe everything that you are told."
"D- I have no problem doing two of these in a sitting."
"Notes: I like it for mixing with stouts when they go flat. It can help resurrect them. All-in-all, it's better than a macrolager but I don't think it's worth the price."
"D - eh...a lady at work keeps giving these to me as thank-you's so I usually pass them off to guests. not awful, I think I might prefer it non nitro'ed though"
"Poured from the nitro can into my Samuel Smith pint glass. After popping the top on the can in exploded all over the coffee table. So, I rushed to pour it slowly into the glass. Beautiful action moved quicker than off the tap, but still looked nice. Not much on the nose. Taste is much more subtle (watery) than on tap. Hard to describe the flavor, so I won't. This one is all looks and no substance for me. It has a cool looking can and pours a creamy cascading head. The mouthfeel is very creamy. Very thin though after the initial creamy feel. There is something I like about it. It goes down very easy. I drank this thing in about 5 minutes and I was telling myself to slow down and enjoy. I will probably stick to the draft version. Don't recommend in the can, especially if you have white carpet."
"Boddington's in a can would be enjoyed by those who are sessioning or who want something a little more exotic than an American pale lager. The draft version, like most beers, is preferable."
"This beer is a good session beer."
"D- It is very drinkable, although it does fill you up quicker then your average beer, but I can definitely say I could drink this beer trough out the evening, so the next time your in the mood for a real eye opener ask your bartender for a Boddingtons Pub Ale, and never look back!"
"Drinkibility: Low. I've had this in cans and now on tap and there are few differences. I won't drink this again."
"Pours a golden amber color with a one-finger head that holds for the count. Bright clarity with evident carbonation and phenomenal lacing. Aromas of freshly cut grass, green apple and biscuit. Creamy, velvet smoothness in a big way -- like an Elvis painting. (Shout out to Jeff.) Opens with malt sweetness and a slight tang of apricot. Moves into flavors of light biscuit and grain. Unpleasant metallic note surfaces. Subtle play of hops on the back end delivers much needed bitterness. As it warms, apple begins to reign. Finishes powder-dry with a borderline astringent quality. As for its session worthiness, the Cream of Manchester offers unparalleled poundability. Quite possibly, the most highly evolved form of the lawnmower brew. Cheers!"
"Because of the passivity this is one to drink mugs of. Water might be a better choice, it's better for you. Choose a beer with some flavor."
"O- Everything from the pour to the last sip is engaging about this beer which which makes appealing to drink."
"I had the beer on tap about a month ago and really liked it. I picked up a case of the nitro cans. When I opened the first can, it shot out and overflowed some. The second can didnt have this problem as much. I poured it into a Guinness glass to drink. Very smooth and creamy and has a good taste. Slightly bitter at the end, but in a good way. It is a great looking beer. I will be enjoying this case."
"Beautiful pour from the nitro can with the cool cascading effect. Nice silky white head and deep golden color. Nose is very, very weak with some cereal grain. Palate is almost flavorless with a faint malt flavor, light & watery body, and little to no finish. It's like this is just a nitro BMC or something. Fail."
"This is a simple ale but a good one for everyday. A true session beer IMO. A good solid pale ale to drink when all you want is to quench your thirst... Not a sipper. Does do her well to sit there and warm up... better drink this one fast and cold."
"Golden colored beer with a slowly fading rich head.Aroma is grainy.Taste is creamy and also grainy.It is smooth and drinkable and goes down very easy.Probably a summer time beer since it is very lager like.I would recommend and would purchase this again."
"The aroma is malty and yeast with a bit of plastic and grass. The appearance is light amber with a creamy head but not a large head. The flavor is like the aroma with a bitter finish. The palate is average for the style. Overall this one is not as good the second time as the first. I feel like it's got adjuncts in it."
"Of the limited canon of my locally-available UK-style pub sessioners, Boddy's sits somewhere in the middle - not all that huge on flavour, but nothing off about it either, and it slides down nice and easy. It's also pretty, well, pretty in its disposition, I gotta say, which doesn't detract in the least."
"1 pint nitro can served at 50 degrees in my Sam Smith tulip. Poured a translucent brownish-reddish copper with a creamy, two inch bright white head with excellent retention. Not much happening in the nose - cereal grains with perhaps a touch of sweetness. Taste is somewhat bland and watery and comes off a little bit skunky with a hint of bitterness coming out at the finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied with a creamy texture and a somewhat flat character. Easy drinking session beer, but there are much better session beers out there. Any port in a storm though."
"D: good beer to watch with a sports game...don't have to think about what you are tasting...straight-forward everyday beer"
"There's really not much flavor, and yet there is a measure of ""drinkability"". I don't mind it--it's good even, but it's pretty unimpressive. I wish it had a bit more to offer. I do think for a nice hot day it might be a real nice departure from the usual crisp and hoppy beers. Goodish-not great."
"D - like glasses of water, why bother? This is easily drinkable, but not worth paying for."
"Drinkability - I guess it's OK, if you're willing to put up with blandness all night."
"D: Pretty good from the lack of carbonation, low abv. Easy drinking."
"D: Quite drinkable because of the balance and the lack of carbonation. It is smooth, if not creamy, and definitely suited to a long session. Just not something I would necessarily choose unless it was the least of many evils."
"Pours clear autumn orange with a pillowy white head. Cream soda like in the aroma, maybe a lightly hopped cream soda. Really mellow flavor, a little bland but the hops do come in late and offer a shot of bitterness if you're looking. Typical mouthfeel for a nitro-can. Chuggable though not really desirable."
"D - I could have a few of these in the sense that there's nothing to write home about. Easy enough to get down."
"pours a golden a colour with a decent cream head. smells of nothing in particular,smells very weak to be honest and unfortunately thats how it tastes too. way too watery for my liking. but its not all bad it is very easy to drink lots of it. i would class this as a beginners ale. so if you have started drinking ale and want to build your way up start with this ale. overall it's a mediocre ale that i would recommend to people who dont like very strong tasting and smelling beers."
"Pours foamy like a Guinness, and comes in the same ""nitro"" can. After the foam settles, there's not much carbonation left. The first sip is kind of a disappointment, and it doesn't improve too much as the glass empties. ""Bitter"" is definitely here, but it's really a bit tart or sour. The foamy/flat, thick/creamy quality stays on your mind while you're downing this one. If you like that, great, but it didn't score any major points with me. Overall an average tasting English ""bitter"" beer with a mediocre flavor."
"Feel is good coming from the nitro can, I'll have to try this on tap one day and see any differences. Smooth and creamy with a medium build and light/subtle carb. While I liked this, I won't be going out of my way for it, I'll hit it up at my local pub/dive. good beer."
"In all a really good english pale ale."
"D- I could see having a few of these if there wasnt any better choices. Not as good as I remember though. Probably wont pick this one up again."
" The smell is of light malty banana bread with wisps of nutmeg (no one else I know smells nutmeg, though). The taste is oh so very mild and un-challenging that some may find it boring. I find it comforting and lovely, like a slightly slow old friend who lacks depth, yet is agreeable with good aesthetics. The drinkability is off the charts...certainly no challenge whatsoever. I love this beer."
"This is a real disappointment. Not sure what went wrong here, but it seemingly all did. Really surprised how disappointed I was in this one."
"Very flat tasting, not pleasant on the palate."
"drinkability is great as well. I love to have a few of these after dinner to cap off a meal. Nothing to heavy and very complementary due to its non-obective flavor."
"Nitro can. Pours amber with a one-finger white head that lasts the duration. Having a hard time thinking of what to say about this one. A very average beer...sweet with a little bitterness on the finish. Fairly refreshing, but I wouldn't pay too much for it (this can was a freebie)."
"D: It goes down fairly easy, but there's not much to really like about this one."
" cheers... i guess."
"Leaves nothing for mouthfeel, but is drinkable in an unintentional way, as a good tea substitute if you let it warm up a bit."
"Beer is smooth, medium to full bodied, odd back of the mouth bitterness and a strong aftertaste. Abbreviates my pleasure with this beer. Hopefully my bad Christmas weekend of terrible beers is nearly over."
"D: a drinkable beer. Nothing special, but worth having as a stand-by."
"The beer starts out as all foam. The foam slowly rolls upward into a thick white pancake a leaves a deep golden beer body. The smell is big on the familiar floral, yeasty scents of a pale ale. The taste is unique to my American taste-buds. A short taste of spicy, floral malts hit the tongue and ends in an oily, metallic taste I'm not too big on. (I'd like to think that the metallic taste might have more to do with the can.) The mouthfeel is really smooth and is missing that carbonation bite I've learn to associate with beer. It's also not too thin and not too thick. The drinkability is manageable if you can get over the metallic aftertaste. I think this must be a mainstream beer for our former colonial oppressors. Probably dynamite on tap."
"D - Very mild and easy to drink though the aftertaste can be a bit of a turn off. Nothing special really, but not bad by any means. Kind of like a dumbed down English Pale... I suspect it has gone this direction intentionally over the last couple of decades."
"D: It's easy to drink b/c it's so bland, but I would not seek this out an buy it again. All around it is a weak beer."
"D: It is a very easy drink."
"Drinkability: Terrible. I can finish almost any beer but not this one. Even tried a second to see if I had a bad can. No carbonation."
"Although this beer isn't the best English pale (by a long shot), it's very drinkable and certainly one of the better imported options available in the standard 'Irish Pub' chain establishment. An old friend, and a good go-to in a pinch. Not terrible in a can either, but certainly preferable on draught."
"D: Easy to drink but it doesn't really do the little things (aroma, feel) to make this more than an average brew."
"This beer is only drinkable considering I haven't seen this beer on tap anywhere within a 9 hour drive. I haven't done an exhaustive search of the area, but I'm sure one is forthcoming."
"Notes: This beer isn't great, and positive characteristics it does have seem to come from the nitro-can. Pity the few beers in nitro cans that are easily accessible to me aren't that great of beers."
"It's interesting to go back every once in a while and re-drink the old beers that your palate stopped by at some point in its development. I hate to say that Boddingtons is kind of like that old friend that you rarely see and you realize, it's because you outgrew it/him."
"Drinkability: It's not horrible. But this is not something I think I would get again."
"Just an easy drinking ale. Creamy, sweet, well balanced. Yes, it's a touch watery and not terribly complex, but nonetheless it is worth a drink every once in a while. The nitro can gives the perfect amount of head if poured properly. Would be an ideal session brew - I only drink it once in a while, though. Recommended."
"D - Very high. This is one of the few reasons I keep coming back to this beer every once in a while. You can drink this loads and it will still taste about the same. Definitely a session ale. Also a good introduction for people who have never tried an ale."
"D- It ended up being a bit nondescript, leaving me with a thin review. I could drink a bunch in a sitting, but it doesn't do much for me. It would be a good ""gateway"" beer, especially to introduce a nitro-pour."
"pours a clear golden /tan color with a HUGE head that settles to an almost blanket 11/2 inch crusty head the smell was thin hops and malt and spice its ok..the taste was to bitter for me it was on the metallic side with subdued malts spices and hop just not alot going on in this ale to keep my interest in drinking very often,,maybe with some fish and chips on a summer afternoon would be better"
"If I were to attempt to clone this, I think I'd go 100% maris otter, mashed medium - maybe 152 to 154, bittered to about 25 or 30 IBU's and no flavour, aroma or dry hops. I'd use Irish ale yeast fermented warm to produce a similar ester profile."
"D: Some good basic flavors and a great mouthfeel. Overall a very drinkable brew. You could definitely throw back more than one of these in a sitting. Some may be thrown by the lack of carbonation."
"Is this a great beer that you sit and admire it? No it is not. But this is one drinkable brew with a good creamy taste and poundable drinkability. For the price this is a very good session beer that I have no problem picking up for a night of beer drinking. It is my favorite English Pale Ale, although I admit the Nitro can has a different taste then off the tap. Still worth a go though."
"D: Overall, this was a pretty average English pale ale with a creamier head from the nitro-can. It was fine with a meal, but I would probably not just drink it by itself. This beer reminds me of 8th Street Ale from Four Peaks Brewing Company, but I enjoy the latter more."
"D - Easy to drink, could be a session beer."
"I could personally drink this for a while. I enjoy the creamy taste. In addition, I don't like pale ales in general, so the fact that this tastes nothing like a pale ale makes it enjoyable."
"This was difficult to finish, there was almost no taste. Aside from the appearance this was pretty awful."
"Overall - not impressed. But then again....I'm a spoiled American Craft beer drinker..."
"Drinkablilty is rather good. I could definitely see these as a good session beer!"
"Drinkability: I think this beer is pretty drinkable. Its taste is pretty good and the overall experience is quite enjoyable."
"Drinkability: Very easy to put down. Very light can consume a number of these in one session."
"My overwhelming impression is that this is one weak-ass beer. Water has considerably more flavor. Wait, there is a taste, but it is like dissolving a gram of sugar into a five gallon jug of water. It pours a cascade of foam out of the nitro can and quickly resolves itself into a clear, dark yellow with a very respectable head. There is no appreciable aroma to the common man. Mouthfeel falls right into line with taste. The highlight of this beer is it's drinkability; I could detect no alcohol and could drink this all day...but why would I want to? Boddingtons Pub Ale is not so much a ""drain pour"" as a ""why bother."" It is not, however, the worst beer I have ever tasted."
"Drinkability: I guess it is the sweeetness that makes this popular but the beer has so many drawbacks to my palate that I don't know where to begin"
"D: Well, I like it enough to drink a lot of it, but it's a fairly mediocre brew, so I don't see myself ever actually doing that when I could get things I like more for less money."
"I will have Boddington's again, suspecting something simply went terribly wrong this time, but I won't be expecting too much!"
"Very drinkable... I have a feeling I could kick these guys back all day long."
"(Taken, in part from my beer blog.)"
"At first the whole glass was frothy and off-white. After the nitro bubbles had a chance to seperate from the beer I could see the clear light amber body and the thick cool looking nitro head. Not much to the smell or taste to speak of. Pretty dry. Kind of has a light medicinal/herbal hoppiness."
"D: This was a strange experience: One of the best looking beers I had in a long time (the best looking English Pale Ale I've ever had), with nice aftertaste and mouthfeel falls flat when it comes to smell and taste - far to week. I had no expectations when I popped the can open, but I got dissapointed when I first smelled it and then tasted it after looking at something that looked really great. At the pub watching a game it would go down (but then again what wouldn't go down in that condition?)"
"dr. yes, buy why? I had remembered Boddinton's a pretty good. Perhaps my palate has improved over the last couple of years."
"OK, so it hasn't astonished me. Hell, it hasn't even particularly impressed me, but it has just enough character to be pleasant and a subtle insinuating drinkability that's hard to ignore."
"This is not great beer. I like English ales - particularly nitro-pressurised ones because they're smooth and clean and a good way to finish the night, but this one has a real mean streak to it, quite aseptic and unpleasant."
"D-Quite drinkable, attributable mostly to its easy body and the smoothness of the nitro can. At the same time, if you're looking for that ""pub can"" feel, why not go to a local brewpub and get some real cask ale?"
"D: Goes down real easy."
"D - Pretty darn good, I enjoyed it alot, but its not an everyday ale"
"(D)- A super easy drinker! Creamy, dry, and slightly sweet. These go down almost as easy as drinking water. Ridiculously simple and straightforward, but it works."
"D- Probably couldve had a few more. Low abv, and relatively light body while still having the taste. Nice."
"Taste & Mouthfeel - these are so smooth and tasty. The creamy head adds to the smoothness, having you crave more, leading me into the drinkability of this beer, definitely a session beer. Perfect for sitting at a barstool and yelling at a West Ham game on TV. It's sad that this brand gets lost in the shuffle by its parent company."
"Creamy like a Guinness, due to the nitrous widget in the can. The ale itself is rather thin and not very carbonated, but get a sip of that creamy nitrous head with every gulp. I could have a couple of these easily. Like a better, less watery version of Guinness."
"first time i had this. out of a 1 pint can. bought in a 4 pack. cracked this bad boy open and it foamed on me. after a qick clean up i poured it into a glass mug. it is a nice amber color pour. i drank it a little warmer than its suggested 41 degrees. smells sweet and slightly hoppy. its a very thick but not filling beer. creamy for sure but still drinkable. starts off sweet and finishes with a slight bite. if you've ever had honeymoon imagine it much thicker but slightly sweet. not bad but not mind blowing. not bad too try but not worth coming back to again and again."
"All in all, a good representation of an English Pale. I really liked the novelty of the creamy head that it has and the thicker body. I enjoyed it...Wouldn't mind making a session of these"
"This brew may be the easiest brew to drink I have ever had that tastes very good. An absolute delight to drink the brew. It is a very, very sessionable brew. Could drink by the truck loads. Wow - think Guinness, but lighter and more appealing to the masses."
"Overall I honestly think I would rather drink a PBR or High Life and for me that's saying something. Just not something enjoyable in this can. I would be willing to give it a try on tap though."
"When poured, a strawish yellow with a nice foam top. A distinct aroma of malt, nothing special. Same can be said with the taste; nothing real complex. Thick enough to go down well, however, there is a lingering metallic aftertaste that kind of kills it."
"Tastes like really smooth...nothing. No really, this beer doesn't tastes like anything. I was thinking honey for a second but I think that's just because the can has a couple bees on it. It's tasteless, but damn it's a creamy tastelessness!"
"Drinkability is average. This isn't much better than your average grocery store beer selection, I'd drink it again but it depends."
"D: Very very very easy to drink, and not a bad way to spend the evening."
"The pint poured from a nitro tap was a cloudy blond creme until the bubbles settled to the top, overall a great presentation like all other nitro taps. Smell of faint hop wisps leapt out of the pure foam head and greeted my nose. The beer has a crispness that isn't present in other pale ales. the bitterness of the beer keeps to the back of the tongue. I suppose the best advice I could give to a person is to have it on tap, where it performs as a great beer to enjoy during the warmer months. I have not had the occasion to try the canned version but judging from the reviews, I am in no rush to try."
"I wish there was more to say about it but this beer just did not do it for me."
"It's possibly better off of tap and I will review it again when I get a chance to."
"Overall a tasty ale. Not great but easily drinkable."
"I poured into a pint glass to a large frothy head. It pours like Guinness but is a light amber color. I think it looks a lot better than Guinness. I think it is the best looking beer out there. It got my first 5. The smell and taste are nothing spectacular. It's just a good solid beer. It is one of my favorite U.K. beers along with Young's Double Chocolate Stout."
"Creamy mouthfeel, low carbonation. Not bad at all, but also not great. I guess it's drinkable in that it's not off putting at all, but I wouldn't have another just because I'd rather seek out a more flavorful option."
"D: While the taste was nothing overwhelming it was still a nice beer that could be worth drinking all day. Hopefully I can get across the pond one day to try it there. I used about 6oz of my pint for a cod batter and it turned out remarkable."
"M-D- Mouthfeel is smooth as water on the tongue. Rich milk-like feel is then off set with an easy light cabonation to finish. Pub like beer with heavy drinking qualities. Definitly a dinner beer light and great tasting."
"D: While the flavor of this beer is not that great, I could for some reason drink it all day. Its not horrible and I do prefer it to BMCs the only big problem with drinking this all day is the price tag. 4 cans for $8.99"
"Nevertheless, the ""bee"" is a British classic; unique and enjoyable."
"MF/D: The mouthfeel is awesome...chewy, thick, oily. Nice finish as well. Not exactly my cup, but I can see why people would like this one"
"D-Pretty drinkable, I could probably drink of 2 or 3 of these due to the lack of carbonation, but I think the flavor of this beer would get boring to me after a while"
"For myself, this is a good session beer at 4.7% and very thirst quenching on a hot summer's day."
"Before I started drinking these types of beer, I absolutely despised this. Now, I really appreciate it. It goes down easy, has a good balance between thick malt and lingering bitterness, and is a mainstay for me."
"Drinkability - I could have a couple of these easily, but probably wouldn't do a session with this one."
"M - Exceptionally creamy, it's almost like drinking liquid silk or butter. Thank the nitro for that one. The thickness of this beer makes me drink it exceptionally slowly, and lasts a long time. Fortunately the long drinking time and warming up doesn't effect the flavor badly."
"This is sort of a study in contrasts. The appearance is really great. Poured from a nitro can (pour quickly...) the head is great, and stays with it the entire class. The color is a really pretty amber with a pure white head. A very pretty beer. The aroma is almost non-existent. If anything, it has a rather floral smell to it. The flavor starts out very bitter from the head, then malt and hops from the beer itself. And then comes my problem with this beer. It has a metallic aftertaste that I'm not really fond of. Sometimes I get it, sometimes I don't. Mostly I get the metallic flavor if I sip the beer. If I take a larger drink, I don't seem to get it. Go figure. Nice creamy mouthfeel, and very sessionable. All in all it's a good brew. Don't overchill it, as it will be more metallic. It's worth a try, and you may find you really like it. I like it, but there are other styles I like better. Once in a while, I really want one of these though."
"D. Very drinkable session beer - Not something I crave, probably wouldn't by a nitro-can. But could definately see buying at the pub again."
"Poured from a nitro can into a weizen glass. Has a beautiful amber color with a 1 inch head. Pleasent, mild malty aroma. Good, smooth flavor with a slight aftertaste. Feels a little creamy in the mouth. A little dry but overall drinkable. This is a quality beer worth checking out."
"This goes down pretty doggone easy. I can see talking my macro loving buddies into trying this and liking it. This is pretty creamy, mild and inoffensive. Good for a warm summer day."
"The color is a nice clear, bright amber. I don't get the nice head and lacing I got from the nitro can. An uncomplicated blend of mild bitter hops and light malt are on the nose. The taste is light herbal citrus hops with a light bitterness and grains. Malt is somewhat shy but does make an appearance. There's a slight metallic / astringent tint to this as well. These end up marring an otherwise pleasant finish. Mouthfeel is a little thin and light-bodied, and this one loses the extreme smoothness and creaminess the nitro can gave it. This is one to try, but It's nothing spectacular."
"This beer looks pretty neat as all of the micro bubbles cascade down the inside of the glass. It acts much like a nitro can of Guinness but the show doesn't last as long. When it's over I'm left with a clear copper-colored beer with a dense creamy head. Almost looks like off-white Cool Whip sitting atop the beer. Not much to boast about in the smell category. The most abundant smell I detect is metal. Followed by light sweet malt and an extremely faint bit of hops. While the metal taste is present in the flavor, the carmel malt is more evident and there's a very slight bitter hop note. And I don't necessarily hate the metal characteristic. It tastes like clean metal at least... Like a dental pick during a cleaning. I like the creamy texture. Light, low carbonation, and creamy body make the mouthfeel by far the best characteristic of this beer. Low alcohol, nice body, and mild taste make this beer pretty easy to drink."
"D - Wow. I could go through a 4 pack of these so quickly. So drinkable with a fantastic mouthfeel and good taste. Damn."
"Nice nitro creamy mouthfeel, a bit too thin though, but very smooth and drinkable."
"Poured nitro-can into pint glass. Creamy, decently persistent head, amber color after it settles down. Not a very distinctive smell, but had a more going on in the taste category. I like the fact that it is light on the carbonation. A very easy beer to drink."
"D: Quite drinkable. I didn't sense anything particularly special in this, but it was still nice."
"You have to be in the mood for a thick smooth beer, but when you get a good batch it's quite good."
"From can no. L8-305MK-17:55. Sampled on May 7, 2009. The nitro can fizzes open with an engulfing widget-driven creamy foamy head. The color is a clear amber-copper. The aroma smacks of sweet malts and light hops, mild and not overwhelming. The mouthfeel gets skewed to the foamy side with the fluffy nitro head skittering across my tongue but overall I would call it a medium body. The taste is mildly bitter and vaguely hopped. I like this one and drink it often."
"This beer was light bodies but crisp and a creamy smooth. A pretty easy drinking english bitter."
"When it comes to drinkability...this is a nitro can. What else did you expect. I just don't like it though."
"Drinkability: Taste is ok with a decent mouthfeel..but its nothing to rave about"
"1 pint can. Pours a perfectly clear gold with the typical cascading white nitrogenous head. Smells very faintly of sweet, slightly grassy malt; kind of reminiscent of an adjunct lager in its non-description. The taste is quite muted as well, coming across as lightly malty, a bit peppery, and with a somewhat bitter finish. Body is light and smooth. As bland and uninspiring as this is, it's unoffensive and drinkable."
"Drinkability:this is a desent pub ale .very fitting to the style it`s going for although a find this to be almost average."
"Decent beer. Would have it again."
"I was not very impressed with this beer, if this is a good pub ale then I'll stick to lagers and stouts"
"Drinkability (3.5): The positive to the thin body is that estery English ales tend to be heavy, and this one gives the light-bodied beer drinker a chance to appreciate their deliciousness. Still, even at 4.7% ABV, one does not find oneself going back for more with the enthusiasm that should be present with a session beer."
"This is drinkable because of the non-offensive tastes, but I'm not going to buy this brew in the future."
"[Drinkability]: Nope! Not this one."
"I'd really like to drink this on tap though. I'm sure it'd be a much better way to taste it."
"Edit: 2 out of 4 of the cans did not have the acrid metallic taste. Adding 0.5 point to taste and 0.5 point to drinkability."
"Pours a yellowish, pale golden color with a 1/2"" head that lasted. Smelled of some spice and fruitiness, but overall not too much aroma at all. Taste was very smooth; a light fruitiness with a slight floral, hoppy bitterness at the finish. Definitely light-bodied. Subtle creaminess for mouthfeel but wish there was more. It's just kind of uneventful, and kind of watery. Thinner than I would have expected. Certainly drinkable though - nothing offensive but nothing too memorable either."
"D: Not doin it for me anymore. The metallic taste is just a tad too much. I hate to say it but this beer has fallen out of good graces with me. Something is just not quite how I remember it. Sad. Day."
"A lot of production value, but a plot that is very ordinary. Still, drinkable."
"D= Though this was not a ""challenging"" beer in the flavor department, it sure is easy to drink a bunch of."
"At the end of the day, I'd say its at about the same level as Guinness, all things considered. I'd probably prefer Guinny if given the choice, but I could certainly see myself picking this up again in the future, if only for a wiff of the good ol' days."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink, and makes you want to drink more. Ate tortilla chips with is, the saltiness went well with the beer. You'll find it easy to have more than 2 or 3."
"With the little nitro pellet this offers a full sized thick white head that holds forever over a clear golden orange-brown color brew with hints of splotchy lacing. The aroma is grassy wheat malt, skunky but fairly polite. The flavor is smooth creamy malt with a somewhat tart edge of melon. Very nice body, lots of gentle carbonation. Easy drinking. A very decent choice with medium flavor appeal."
"Drinkability is good. I think this is probably the Miller/Bud for Englanders. Although this definetly has more character then those two. It goes down super easy. Not much to contemplate as you drink. Something to slam as you watch futbol."
"D- Ok, this stuff is like English Pale Ale Light. It does go down very easy though."
"Pretty decent atmosphere. Appearance typical with a nitro-can, and a pleasant, albeit subdued, nose. Decent flavor and light body. Pretty decent quaff."
"Drinkability - not poor, but I'd spend my time and money on something else on most occasions."
"Tastes like a Guinness, though I think this is a notch above that. I'm not a huge fan of these pub ales."
"This is a very one dimensional beer, but it is one I can drink 6 pack of no problem. Boddingtons pours super smooth and creamy with 2 fingers of head. No complexity, but oh so smooth. A great beer if you're looking for a thirst quencher that's incredibly smooth, consistent in flavor and easy to drink, then Boddingtons is for you."
"Don't drink and review."
"The drinkability is middle of the road. It's good because of the creaminess and simplicity of the brew, but the weird metallic notes in the taste deter it from being a good session-er."
"In closing, this beer is not incredible, and It wasn't brewed to be. I still buy it often."
"over all...worth the try but not my cup o tea."
"Truth be told, I like both. Boddingtons was a sort of crossover beer for me and it has a special place in my heart, haha. But I do enjoy and would definitely get it again."
"D- a nice beer to have as a change up but nothing purchase worthy."
"Overall Impression: I would buy this beer again at a pub or to have around on a hot summer day. It's a good quaff-er if you're not looking for something that will blow your pallet or be hard on your taste buds. It's not a complex beer, but satisfying and does the job a light pub ale should"
"Poured a golden yellow with a cascading carbonation that seems to fall down to the bottom of the glass, similar to Guiness. Creamy, frothy white head leaves a slight lacing around the glass. Nose is almost non-existent. Taste is corn and a slight malt presence. No hops detected."
"D - very drinkable as mentioned above, but again, too drinkable. It is very much chug-able like a similar nitro-can stout I know and disdain."
"Drinkability: Not too far from a drainpour. It was in front of me, so I drank it."
"Mouthfeel - Very thin and I couldn't order another pint. I'm contemplating if this is a slow mover at this restaurant. Will have to seek out the draught cans and reevaluate."
"Oh Boddington's. This is one of my favorite beers to have when served on tap. The can is so-so, but on tap, there's something about a lighter nitrogen beer that I can't quite resist. The thick white head sticks around for most of the beverage unlike most other beers, this perhaps traps some of the aroma in though, which is for the most part not really there at all. Other than the lack of aroma, there are no complaints on my end about it."
"I'd like to try another because I generally don't disagree this badly with my fellow ba's...I'm gonna need some time though."
"Overall I don't think this is the best of the style but it's pretty damn good, and better than I expected it to be. It's not overly complex, but it makes up in drinkability. Very nice session ale."
"Overall-really enjoyed this on tap, flavorful compared to most English Pales but very drinkable."
"Bright yellow-gold pour, hazy, with a huge pillow of tiny white bubble for a head. These nitro-cans seem to always give beautiful pours. Bready aroma, butterscotch malt. Creamy, and has a light flavor. More butterscotch, caramel, and a tiny bite of golding hops. Very smooth drinking. Although, I can't imagine what the other version tastes like if this is the ""stronger version."" Decent."
"D - This is a very drinkable session beer I could easily drink this all night while hanging out with friends at the bar nothing mind blowing just a good session beer"
"From the nitro can we get an amber/gold pour with lots of tiny bubbles that help this totally flat brew produce a nice creamy head that quickly recedes to a quarter of an inch, but to its credit, lasts to the end. As does the fairly nice lace. The ale itself has a pleasant malty, not too hopped, taste and an aroma largely of malt, a little of banana, and a touch of floral, but this brew lacks body and bubble. The big disappointment here is that, despite the nitro device, there is a total lack of carbonation. This stuff is like drinking ""flat beer"" or ale flavored water. Not nearly as good as the Boddington's I've had on tap while in London. At $8 for 4 pint cans, I'd opt for 3 big Bass bottles."
"i highly recommend."
"Love this beer. A bit of a more mass-produced beer but none-the-less a great drink. A great taste and a great drink. And not too heavy so there is no issue in not be able to drink plenty. Best out of the tap but the nitro-can is not a bad second option."
"Ahhh, an old favorite, this is one of the first beers that really showed me what beer could be. Has it lived up to my memories as my tastes have matured? Not quite . . .but I still feel like this is a quality mass-produced brew. A decent looking pour with an attractive head, a nice creamy, frothy, taste, I sense banana, am I crazy or is it there. A beer milkshake type of feel to it. Really the taste is a bit empty compared to what I'm used to, it comes and goes so quickly. Not offensive, just a bit weak. It doesn't live up to the better brews I have graduated too, but it does live up to the memories."
"Drinkability: While bitter, the alcohol content is relativity low, so if it suits your taste you can drink this all night (much like Guinness)."
"It excited me at first with the creamy, thick, white head. The head tasted great, reminded me of a foamy marshmallow type taste. The aroma, however, left something to be desired. As nice as the thick, creamy head was, I didn't really care for the beer all that much. It was extremely watery in contrast with the head and just felt weak overall to me."
"The nitro in the can made a very foamy thick head that lasted through most of the beer. The mouthfeel was a little bit too creamy for me which seemed to hid some the beers attributes. It had mild grain flavor couldn't tell to much more. Could drink again."
"Overall - definitely not worth the $5/pint. If it was $3 then yes. A good session beer but that's about all it has going for it. Rather pay a few bucks more for Guinness... but then again, it's only Guinness Draught... no Extra Stout here..."
"Overall this was a decent beer. I can't say that I'm terribly familiar with the style, but I feel like it should have more flavor."
"Despite other reviews, I found this beer to be an exceptional antithesis of the flavor-exploding beers in large production these days. I've had Boddingtons a number of times over the past two months, in cans and from tap at the Flying Saucer in Austin Texas, and I'm always excited to rely on it as an incredibly drinkable, low-gravity beer with delicate hints of sweet corn, and even, light banana on the after taste. Its nose isn't incredibly pronounced, but is reflective of the subtle flavors within. The carbonation is nice and frothy and melts away quickly like the much wider known Guinness brews, leaving a creamy smoothness on the palate after a sip. For those who want a great beer to drink during events that you wouldn't normally want high-gravity (movies, football games, socials with important guests that you cant turn into a drunken ass in front of) then Boddington's Pub Ale is for you. Cheers!"
"Pours a clear yellow color, domesticy looking. Big white creamy head, lasting. Very malty aroma, not much else. Creamy malty but balanced taste. A little bitter aftertaste. Fruity aftertaste. Very light, not too flavorful."
"This nitro can produced an amusing explosion and only a quick grab of my glass prevented a mess. I learned my lesson about these things a while ago, but the Boddingtons widget seemed particularly aggressive. Initially, the beer appears to be a nearly solid off-white head, a roiling mass of tiny bubbles jostling their way to the top. The head settles into a stiff foam, like an over-frothed cappuccino. It looks like you could rest change on top of that head. The beer itself is a pale-yellow gold, a bit disappointing after the big special effects display of the nitrogen. The smell is quite weak, which seems counterintuitive to me with such a big head. If that many swirling bubbles can't coax more than a weak, pale malt nose out of this beer, then there isn't much there. The taste would almost certainly improve if the beer was poured from a tap. Right now, it's malty but thin and generic. The feel is a bit watery, which is particularly disappointing when compared to the tap version. I remember Boddingtons having a much creamier, richer feel from my trip to the UK. I had a particularly enjoyable night of drinking Boddingtons once on a ferry from France to Ireland. That was a weird twenty or so hours."
"Once the head settles and all the commotion comes to a halt, this beer looks like its made of styrofoam or wax. If I turn it upside-down will it spill. I just don't know. A pale malt aroma without much else. A bland nose. I can't complain about the taste but I can't rave about it either. Starts out clean and creamy and finishes watery and slightly bitter. Very drinkable and more enjoyable if your not reviewing or thinking too much about the flavor."
"A foamy gold beer. The smell is grainy with a hint of nutmeg. Taste is bland with hint of something in the spice cabinet. I'm glad I tasted it. But I don't think I'd want a bunch of them. They aren't bad or offensive though and go down easy. All and all, a nice uncomplicated casual ale."
"I had this ale for the first time a couple years back in a little pub in Brighton, England. I immediately fell in love with it. It's extremely smooth, thick creamy head and the bitter notes hit the back of the tounge just right. Luckily it's really easy to find here in Phoenix and Churchill's Pub and Grill always have it on tap."
"Verdict: A very different beer, Boddingtons in a can is an experience all beer lovers should try at least once. Perhaps the taste is not the most remarkable in the English Pale Ale category, but the appearance and mouthfeel are so unique that the beer will always stand out to me. A worthy survivor of more than two centuries."
"D: Not my favorite beer to drink but a really easy beer to drink. Smooth but needs more to it."
"Mild caramel maly aroma, some cooked hops, fresh. Flavor has some fresh hoppy bitterness up front, mouthfeel smooth and creamy. But unfortuantely there is a sour edge to the beer that leaves a somewhat unpleasant finish. Drinkable only with food...having rough time finishing this alone."
"drinkability - Was an ok beer. i don't think it was easy drinking beer. I tried this at Disney's Epcot."
"The key feature of this beer is the drinkability. Since there isn't too much present in terms of mouthfeel or flavor, I could easily picture myself throwing down a bunch of these at a bar or otherwise in the company of friends. I wasn't too impressed in terms of flavor, but I suppose that I can't knock the biscuit character too much. It's not BAD, I just don't think it's anything other than average."
"The beer pours a clear darker gold. Roughly a 3/8 inch head after settling in glass. Head is white but not impressive in size or stature. There isn't much of an aroma to speak of. Literally no flavor other than a sense of malt denseness and a tad of hops at the close. Mouthfeel is average other and there is very little carbonation. I had really high hopes for this beer. I wouldn't turn it away, but won't purchase it on my own again."
"The main goal of the nitro widget contained in this can of Boddingtons is to reproduce the beer as you would get it on nitro-tap. It should have a dense, creamy head that remains atop the liquid and also provide a creamy mouthfeel. Making sure the can was not too cold, and my glass was big enough to pour the entire contents, I poured steadily at a medium pace to let the nitrogen exit the widget and into the liquid. If the beer is too cold on pouring I've noticed a complete lack of aroma. This is a very light beer so you've really got to coax out the flavors and aromas. When warm enough you can smell the banana yeast character. The light flavor mimics this banana note. This canned version of Boddingtons is a pale imitation of the tap version because the taste and smell of the head is a slight bit canny or metallic and also a bit thin in flavor and aroma. The mouthfeel ends more watery than creamy. Still, overall the Boddingtons flavor although one dimensional is pleasant."
"heard some decent things about this beer, thought i'd give it a whirl. like guinness or murphys its a nitro can so its neat to hear the nitro widget go crazy after you open it and pour it in the glass and see the big white head develop, thats where all the good ends, and the bad begins, smell reaks of corn, more than budlight, its crazy how unappealing it smells. taste is even less, appealing, just a bitter and skunky watery mess.. mouthfeel is like distilled water, i woud say avoid"
"Very easy drinking and sessionable."
"d: very heavy, i couldn't do more than a few of these per session. great as a final drink of the evening"
" Refreshing on a hot day."
"D - Boddingtons. The embodiment of drinkability. I still really like this beer. I can't help it."
"Went down smooth and medium-bodied, but there wasn't much of a discernable taste. Some bread and sweet malts and a little rough backbite from either roasted/coffee malt and some hop prickness, but still a tad bland. This isn't a bad beer, but I'd much rather have it on draft than out of the can."
"Pours a clear, golden yellow in color with a thick creamy head that did not dissipated entirely. Very little aroma, some cereal grains and a slight hint of malt. Taste was honey and malty, slight hops in the aftertaste and a hint of ripe fruit. Taste was very crisp and clean. Mouthfeel was excellent, sorta of like cream with a smooth finish. Drinkability is excellent, might need a little more flavor but very smooth and tasty."
"A pretty easy-drinking brew, but drinkability suffers from the beer's flavor which, while not bad, isn't the most desirable, and the rather flat nature due to lack of carbonation keeps it from really refreshing at all. Overall rather inoffensive, but doesn't leave me screaming -- or whispering, for that matter -- for another round."
"Decent. Nothing really overly stood out here except for the look, easy body, and mellow drinkibility. Not offensive by any means but unfortunately not that memorable either."
"So, to summarize: Great head, great mouthfeel, highly sessionable == gargantuan burps that may or may not annoy others, depending on the company you keep. Otherwise average taste."
"Drinkability> Sometimes I'm in a mood where I feel like Guinness but want something that is more refreshing (read: less tasty) and I'll order it at the pub. Its a safe bet generally, and a whole hell of a lot better on tap than in a can."
"This is a very exceptional beer in my opinion. The widget gives one perhaps a BETTER than tap experience. I highly recommend....especially while watching soccer...err...football."
"Pours a golden color with a very thick, creamy head. Almost out of control. Fairly smooth and creamy with sweet malts and leaves somewhat of a bitter taste. Good beer, for a while it was a regular of mine. At $5 for 4 pint size cans, it comes at a decent price too."
"D- The nitro foam and buttery taste slightly put me off, however it's such an enjoyable beer to drink I am tempted to pickup a few more."
"D - not bad. Not sure I could do more than 2-3 (I have before at parties, ha) without already being a state of liquid bliss, but it is certainly a change of pace from all the Terrapin Rye and other IPAs I drank last night. Worth trying at least once"
"Could drink a few of these."
"A rather dissapointing brew. It also seemed to loose its carbonation a little too quickly. I probably wouldn't get it again."
"an alright beer aftertaste is definately its downfall but the mouthfeel makes it better"
"I am not impressed at all. I don't think I will get this again, and there is no reason to recommend this."
"Wouldn't recommend it..."
"Poured from the can with the widget into a tall glass. Beautiful cascade effect that soon settled to a crisp golden light amber ale with a full head and minimal lacing. Aroma is a faint mixture of light malt with some sweetness perhaps from honey. There is a bread like quality with the aroma, pleasant just needs to be stronger. Mouthfeel is very watery and slightly thin, although the finish is decent which keeps this category from tanking. Flavor is OK but really lacks especially in the malt department. Slightly bitter to the tongue there is that watery aspect again that really makes this ale fall way short. Glad I only bought a single can."
"M&D- Feels and drinks excellent. Silky smooth and easy to drink through a pint in no time."
"The nitro-can on this classic pale ale does a good job of simulating what you get in hand-drawn pint served in an English pub, but there's still something lacking. The nitrogen does a good job of creating a nice white foamy head that lingers all the way to the bottom of the glass, even if you take a while to nurse the pint. When first poured, the ale has a nice convection-like action as the nitrogen stabilizes, but afterward you have just the thick white head atop a clear amber body. There's little nose on this one, but a very nice and full mouthfeel with a matching full hoppiness on both the palate and the finish. A pleasant bitter aftertaste polishes it off. As a pub ale with nitrogen rather than carbonation, it naturally is a little flat, and thus not as refreshing as some other brews of similar consistency. For me, this makes it less enticing for drinking more than one."
"I wouldn't refuse one, but I wouldn't buy one again. A summer quencher at best. Shame."
"This was a pretty good beer overall. To my surprise the first can I opened burst over onto my hand and the carpet, so I handed that one to my friend. The next one I cracked open i poured directly into a pint glass and it poured a golden yellow and created a beautiful head. Not much smell to the beer, and compared to many other beers not much carbonation. Its a very hard beer to describe in taste and the best I can come up with is a creamy Budweiser with a lot less carbonation. Very drinkable and refreshing. I would recommend it if your looking to switch things up."
"Golden yellow body with lots of bubbles on the sides of the glass. Healthy head with very small bubbles, giving it a creamy appearance. Sweet, almost citrusy aroma. Mouthfeel is full but not heavy, and low in carbonation. Taste is good, but very hard for me to describe. Light, hoppy, slightly floral. Good all-around beer."
"Typical of the style, maybe a bit bland, but very refreshing with just enough flavor and low enough alcohol to make it a nice session beer."
"Purchased as part of ""build-your-own-six-pack"" at local grocer. Medium thick foamy head on a medium amber body. Smelled of cheap, flat wine, with the taste being about the same. Just not pleasant in any fashion. This was my first ""nitro"" can, and if this is what I can expect from them all, I'll pass."
"A truly golden amber forms a thick white head that stays clinging to the glass as it goes down. The sweet airy, with a hint of honey scent made the pour of this brew quite enjoyable. The sweet, malty taste is nice and creamy. After a couple of gulps the creamy thickness with a slight bitter taste at the end makes this for an enjoyable drink. In the end my only thought was give me more."
"poured thick and goldan and settled slowley, it smells sweet. my first sip and i was in love this is sweet and malty and goes down smooth, this one is the smothist beer i have ever had. this one goes down like drinking creem. the taste is light but hardy at the same time, this is the closest to cream and honey in a beer i have ever had."
"1069"
"Boddingtons is a pleasant English ale - clearly not the best, but its one of those beers I can always turn to and be pleased with."
"D - Ok I suppose, the nitro-widget seems a bit gimmicky to cover up an otherwise average beer."
"D - I pretty much drink this whenever they bust out the beers for company happy hours as it is easily the best beer that we regularly get. Very enjoyable anytime of the year, works great for sessions."
"Drinkabillity: I'm not sure if I'll finish this 4pack, what does that tell you."
"Drinkability is very good here. Straight from the can, this stuff goes down easy and quickly. There's no doubt many of these can be consumed in one sitting. Cheers mate!"
"The taste is malty and pleasing, with just enough hops to make it worthwhile. Nutty and roasted tones combine well with the obvious creamy texture to create a satisfying, mellow drinking experience. There is some metal briefly in the aftertaste but it rounds into shape quickly. Definitely a great pub, watching the match type ale. Stupid and immature, collect your winnings."
"Overall a very clean and non-offensive pale ale/bitter. Not the best example of the style and it doesn't go out of it's way to be 'unique' or different, but it still fits in nicely. Much improvement as it warms up a little bit. Very drinkable! As always, will get some more."
"D: I'm glad I tried this beer but I can't say that I'll be having again after I finish off this four pack."
"Nice look to it, deep copper-amber color with a smallish head and a touch of lacing. Nose is extremely mild, just a subtle hint of malt. Flavor is similar, light caramel malt comes through, slightly metallic as well, no real hop presence. Feel is nice and creamy, with a good body. Overall, it's mild as hell, but not really objectionable. Not a lot going on."
"Head is so thick and foamy, almost like a meringue. Body is thin, with low carbonation. Bitter notes are too overpowering to make this very drinkable."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors; Tucson AZ"
" This was part of a 5 beer flight of pale ales and was easily the worst of them."
"Palate is inoffensive, hint of bitterness but quite a bit pungent maltiness to it. Could use lower abv. Pretty easy drinking in nitro format, at least."
"I remember it being better than this in England, but I was an 18 year old novice at the time."
"This pours a golden amber color and has an average beige head. Not really much smell or taste. There are some really mild malts and faint hops. The body is nice initially, but turns too watery as the beers warms. Nothing bad here, just a light mild ale that drinks easy."
"I was glad I had the chance to review this on tap, and my review is mainly a comparison to the nitro-can version. Boddington's on tap definitely expresses more of a pale ale character as opposed to it's nearly flavorless nitro-can counterpart, but it's still a bit of an inferior beer. The absence of the creaminess takes away from the charm of the nitro-can, but the ""true"" flavor of Boddingtons becomes more apparent. Slight carbonation really helps this brew, and for some reason I found the tap version to be largely devoid of the horrid metallic aftertaste."
"MF&D - The little amount of carbonation help this ale maintain its creamy smoothness. Although not packed with too much flavor this ale is enjoyable and easily sessioned."
"D: While it is easy to consume it comes off rather to basic and I would probably tire easily of this one in session. Good I guess for slugging them back at the local pub and turning your brain off while you drink."
"Like I said, I don't have a lot of faith in nitro-based serving devices. A little extra CO2 could make this beer significantly more enjoyable."
"D: Easy to drink many at a time, but for the price, I would not drink many."
"drinkability is decent. the flavors and aromas here create nice profiles, but the mouthfeel just kills the enjoyment. a bit of CO2 and a thicker body would really make this brew come alive in the mouth."
"D: If you are at a pub that has no micros, its a good choice to break the monotony of Guinness and Newcastle."
"Look out for the big rush of air and bubbles from the nitro can and have your pint glass ready. This beer pours with a thick and foamy head. Wonderful active bubbles slowly float to the top to form a thick white head. This creamy white head sits on top of a golden amber body with tons of tiny slow rising bubbles. The aroma is floral with some malty notes. The flavor is creamy, sweet and smooth. It has a very light malt character with a watery middle and some bitter hops in the finish. Overall it's a very interesting beer with smooth light flavors."
"Overall, an excellent English Beer I will be more than happy to come back to from time to time"
"Overflowed slightly from the can after opening. Poured a huge creamy white which formed a great big 4 inch creamy white head taking about 5 minutes to settle completely. Left tons of white lace all over the pint. Very mild scent of malt with not much else. Nice creamy flavor. Very mild but not bland. Light malt with very mild hint of hops and slightly sweet. 5.0 on the mouthfeel with a huge creamy full-bodied mouthcoating that covers every bit. Without a doubt one of those beers you can pound all day. Not huge flavor but tasty nonetheless. Perfect warm-weather summertime brew."
"drinkability? ... one and thats enough for me. I just cant enjoy more than a pint of it. I think that being out of a can has a lot to do with it."
"The taste is similar, being very mild toasted grain with faint hint of caramel, light hint of leaves and grass, with a lightly bitter finish. Its feel is conflicted, both creamy from the head yet a little thin, watery, and flat. Overall, the flavours are good and they do hold up quite well to food, etc., but it needs more. It is, however, very easy to drink and has at least some character, even if a bit one-dimensional."
"Probably would not drink this again."
"D-This is a beer i can drink better out of the tap then in the can being very crisp and light makes it easy to drink"
"Poured from a nitro can, which provided a very nice milky cascade, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Upon finishing the pour, it had a very nice white head that seemed to linger, but not for too long. It had a nice golden yellow haze to it that I could not see through. Not much nose to it at all. The mouthful was very creamy, a bit watery, but yet full and heavy. I find the beer very easy to drink, as it is very smooth. Great beer with any type of pub grub and one that I try to enjoy often."
"Boddingtons is one of the few beers than I prefer out of a can instead of on tap. Poured from a can into a pint glass, Boddingtons reveals its beautiful golden color and surprisingly creamy head. Not much of a scent to it, but a very clean tasting bear with very subtle citrus notes. The mouth feel is full and smooth, and the second pint goes down as easy as the first. I'd definitely recommend Boddingtons to any beer connoisseur regardless of taste."
"Drinkability was lower due to me not enjoying watery beers."
"D poor. I will not seek this one out again."
"MF/D: Watery, goes down rather quickly. It's easy to drink, that's for sure, but I have a hard time getting past it's flavour - what little of it there is, just isn't pleasant to me, and it really makes me feel like I'm drinking something that's literally been diluted. Oh, those silly English, they should know better, and leave the creamy beers to us Irish!!! ;)"
"Truly a session beer."
"It is increasingly easy to amuse my small mind. Watching the pour cascade from a milky liquid into a nice amber-colored beer brought a smile to my face. The finger's worth of thick, creamy, ecru head sat like a blanket of fresh snow atop the beer. The nose was faint and slightly sweet, almost in a lager-like way. The color was a medium amber with NE-quality clarity. The mouthfeel was full and creamy, even kind of silky on the swallow. This was a very mild beer, both on the tongue and on the finish. These factors, coupled with its low ABV make it a session candidate, especially when you include its fairly common availability."
"The texture of this beer is a lot like a Guiness, but the flavor doesn't have any of the coffee flavor. It's a pretty mild beer without much bitterness at all, but the flavor that is there tastes really good. This beer is easy to drink and very enjoyable if you like the heavier drinks."
"Drinkable but not a session beer to me."
"D - This is okay. I think that it is far better on tap than from a nitro can."
"D: A refreshing beer, good with the salmon mashed potatoes that I had at Finnegan's Wake in Key West Fla. I touristy macro place but still you have a descent selection and they do have really good food. Go there if you need a descent beer."
"D: This is a great Pub ale - In my opinion, much better than tetleys. It has more flavour and provides a more pleasing drinking experience - I love the touch of honey in this one. This stuff is sooo easy to drink - I think I could have ten! Hey it's St. Patricks day after all... I will definitely buy this beer again."
"This beer has become one of my favorite go-to beers. I especially like the 4.7% abv which really helps the sessionability of this tasty English beer. IMO this beer is closer to an English Bitter than a pale ale. Whatever, it is a delicious pour."
"This can was pretty weird. When I opened it the beer began to gush out uncontrollably. I then poured it into a glass, it was a very light yellow color that had a huge head and a some what musty smell. It was very watery and extremley flat. Not a good brew."
"T: its very watery you get a little creamy malt taste, but there is very little back bone and the beer could be better. Its very easy to session and not notice, but its not the kinda beer that will smack you in the face and make you take notice"
"Pours a crystal clear, dark straw, just slight amber color with the classic nitro thick, white head. Aroma is very mild with the a watery, thin malt note. A bit of grassy, floral hop character. On the palate, a caramel, lightly toasted malt flavor comes through, very clean. It finishes with a firm, and floral bitterness, medium dry. The low carbonation from the nitro makes it very easy drinking. Overall, I could certainly see myself drinking several, but there's a strange stale hop flavor that limits over consumption."
"This can exploded when i opened it. Not much to say about this beer. Gold in color. nice white head though. smell has very faint hops. taste is ugly bitter. Too watery for me. All in all, i would rather hump the hell out of a yak's sweet ass and then lap up the hot sweat dripping off of its scrodum."
"behold...Boddingtons Ale, the finest drink. our band, The Ill Mayhem, loves this beer for post session sessions. this beer is a great pub ale, you can pour it as fast and hard as you like, and the beer cascades out to a foamy half inch head which maintains for the duration. the frothy head also has a creamy or marshmellowy swseetness, if you decided to down it as well. the ill mayhem loves this beer, we endorse it, and would like to be sponsored by it. Our bass player, Rootin Tootin Rasputin has been quoted as saying "" Boddingtons Pub Ale is proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy"" from his treetop perch. The first time i bought Boddingtons, the old man at the liquor store declared ""that is the SMOOTHEST beer ive EVER had."" cheers bro"
"Golden to copper in color, after it has settled, with a dense creamy eggshell head and sticky. Powdered coffee creamer aroma with a bit of fruit in the back, very general. The taste begins with sweet grains, slightly fruity and DMS. Mild bittering hops grow into the finish with floral notes and a slightly soapy astringent. Aftertaste is herbal, dry, straw and tea notes. Thin body, low carbonation and nearly watery mouthfeel makes it pretty easy to throw back."
"This is a really pretty good ale that is mellow in flavor, smooth, and well balanced. I've only seen it in nitro-cans or on tap at a couple places. Worth a taste for yourself."
"D - The look was great, but got steadily worse from there. Not a terrible beer, but I probably won't be drinking again anytime soon. Fun to give someone and not mention the gusher part!"
"When poured, it created a cream coloured moussy head. Mouthfeel was full and round, quite plesant. In the glass the beer was dark amber colour with a lot of effervecense. The nose was soft and sweet with hints of toast. A very good malt flavour finished with a slight hint of bitters."
"D:A very light beer to wrap up my evening of drinking, but not a normal choice for me."
"Was at an irish bar and wanted something other then my usual Guinness. Waitress suggested This wonderful beer. it is like a creamy Bass Ale, only better. Just a great drinking experience. Not too hoppy but right. Almost as wonderul as Guinness but nothing comes close to the original"
"D: Pretty easy to drink. Alcohol isn't very high, so it's easy to drink plenty. This isn't really a drink that's going to make you think and contemplate its nature, but you don't have to prepare yourself for each sip."
"D- Great session beer, tasty"
"D - I'll probably revisit this one actually, it has some excellent session qualities and isn't a shabby brew by any means. Definitely worth a try."
"Poured a 16 oz can into a pint glass. Pours a crisp golden with a big, creamy white head that sticks around in full force for the entirety of the beer. Leaves really sticky lacing. Aroma is a nondescript sweetness. Almost like banana but lacking that Hefe quality. Taste is nothing. I remember loving this beer before becoming a full out beer geek. Wow, how palates change. Mouthfeel is as good as you would expect with an aerator. All in all, you can drink it for the mouthfeel but don't drink it for the taste. Definitely not worth the cost of this beer."
"rerate: on tap.. looks the part but the flavour is odd..i prefer the can i think but who knows.. if i feel like a widget beer go with guinness or youngs double choc..."
"D. The low ABV and traditional English label make this a great one to session at the pub. Judging from other reviews I wouldn't buy this unless it's on tap."
"I found this beer to be ok for drinkability."
"Boddington's is a mixed bag of a beer. While the technical aspects - appearance, mouthfeel - were solid, the taste was a little to harsh. Not a bad beer, but I wouldn't want to make it a regular thing. Also, buying it in a bar around here is pretty expensive."
"D - The fruit finish is a little difficult to overcome, but the mouthfeel is very good. An average beer."
"It poured nicely into the mug with a reddish hue and a thick white head that persisted through the drinking. Unfortunately, it was downhill form there. There wasn't much smell to speak of and the taste was bland and watery, with mild bitterness on the finish. I felt that the beer was under-carbonated and a bit of a chore to drink. I wouldn't get it again."
"Drinkability: If you're looking for an extreme taste sensation, then you'll be sorely disappointed. If you're looking for a relatively low-alcohol, smooth, easy-drinking beer, then this'll do in a pinch. Unfortunately, I prefer the former."
"Got this beer on-tap at a new irish pub in Frisco. It arrived in a pint glass. A nice amber color with a white 2-finger head. The smell wasn't very stong, could smell a touch of malt, but nothing that jumped out at me. The taste was kinda bland, and watery. I wouldn't say this is a bad beer, but it's not going to be a 1st choice. The mouthfeel was light and watery. Overall, I could see this beer being a decent beer to drink if you want to drink a lot. No real effect considering the 4%abv."
"Feels creamy but kind of thin. Not very appealing, but not too bad either."
"D - It's a good session beer and I'm glad I had a chance to try it and if it were available on a limited beer menu I'd surely pick it out again..not offensive..just not very adventerous either..but then again not every beer should be I guess..it is what it is..and it does what the brewer intended..overall not bad"
"D - Mild and easily drinkable. It would be easy to fault this beer for being bland (and make no mistake, it is bland), but one must keep in mind that it is, as it says on the can, a pub ale. This is not meant to be pondered, but consumed casually in good company; and for that it is adequate. I have certainly had better british ales, but this does its job."
"On tap at the Draught house. White rich creamy lasting head like a squirt of shaving cream. Lightly sweet floral, honey and alcohol aroma. Extremely smooth creamy mouthfeel, very lightly carbonated. Slighty sweet aftertaste with a twinge of bitterness and alcohol. Decent, but it could use just a tad more carbonation, but I understand this is the style of the beer. Not bad, but not something I crave."
"Very very drinkable, but not flavorful enough to really entice me."
"I've had it out of the nitro-can, and thought it wasn't as good, probably just didn't get the right head out of it. It's nice, mellow, and great for just hanging out and having a few late-night."
"D- Besides the strange aftertaste, these are pretty decent. I wouldn't run out and buy a bunch, but it is worth a try."
"D- I can drink several of these no problem its definitely worth a try."
"Quite forgettable ale. Very light copper color with a dense white head. Faint aroma of fuggles in the background. Very thin body and mouthfeel. The front end and middle was oily with little to no malt character. Weak bitterness can be detected in the finish. Not worth the 7 bucks a 4-pack they ask for."
"On tap down in New Haven at Bar. I liked it out of the tap. At first it poured an all white beer that stayed for about 10 minutes until it settled into a golden yellow color with a very thick and creamy white head. The head stuck around the length of the beer but since it was so thick and creamy, it was a nice touch. It had a light malty aroma with a sweet smell at the end. The taste was pretty good. It was really smooth with light malty/hoppiness and then a sweet almost creamy taste afterwards. The mouthfeel is excellent and it is a pretty drinkable beer."
"Draft pours beautifully. Has that middle section that forms into foam on top and beer on the bottom. The aroma is weak and the taste begins the same but finishes with a very pleasant bitter bite. Not an outstanding beer. It wont impress your beer-geek buddies but it is a nice little brew to drink in a pub with some food."
"One of the worst beers I've had in a while."
"16oz Nitro can from a local grocery store. Pours a translucent golden-amber with a respectivle inch or more of off-white head. Biscuit malts show through in the aroma with very little else I can notice. Biscuity and somewhat roasty malts along with a good dose of English hops characterize the flavor initially, but give way to a fairly clean finish. Thick (no doubt due to the nitro), yet oddly aqueous in the mouthfeel with few to no bubbles - almost flat. An easy drinker for sure, but by no means as complex or flavorful as its counterparts in the style. Not much going on here. Not that impressed with this one overall, though at 5.99$ per 4-pack, it's at least cheaper than a lot of its competition."
"D - A very sessionable brew indeed. What it lacks in complexity or assertiveness it makes up for with a pleasantly mild and tasty drinkability."
"My old roommate at Ft. Stweart introduced me to this beauty, thanks McElroy. I love the way this beer pours, downward flowing bubbles like Guinness. Super creamy head, amazing clarity and decent carbonation. Nose is a bit weak, very malt forward with a sweet/creamy feel to it. Taste is a tame, creamy and approachable. This beer, and the style it represent, is meant to be consumed pint after pint and not destroy you. Even though the score is low on this beer it is enjoyable and has its time and place."
"Overall, a run-of-the mill pale ale that doesn't seem to gain much from a nitro-head. I feel that stouts work better for nitro-cans than pale ales. It's still a decent beer and that isn't enough to take away from it."
"The taste matches the smell...good hop bitterness(no citrus really, just bitter) with some honey sweetness and some metallic taste. Silky smooth mouthfeel here and it finishes slightly bitter; the finish is actually the only part that I don't fancy too much but over all, this is a pretty good taster and so darn easy to drink. I don't know why I like Boddingtons, I just do and I buy it every so often."
"A no frills beer really."
"The mouth feel and taste are very thin, almost like the beer was watered down. I just can't get past that. Sure there are other things to say, but they are minor compared to the wateriness."
"This beer is a light british ale with a smooth mouthfeel due to the nitro head produced from the widget. Hops bitterness was very present in this beer, with a light, thin mouthfeel. Low ABV makes this a very drinkable thirst quencher. The last can I had had a slight metallic twinge to it that didn't play well with the hops. I feel they could have gone a little lighter on the hops to balance out the beer."
"D- With a relatively low ABV, it is easy to kill the 4 pack at a hurried pace."
"D- Not quick sure why I like this so much it is almost like drinking air, it goes down very smooth and I find myself always ready for another. The 4 pack just seems to disappear over the course of the night. The price is right for it when it is on sale. It is a nice beer to have around and goes with everything."
"Drinkability: A treat to drink. This beer makes a nice addition to a drinking session featuring beers that are more aggressive. It soothes the senses and prepares them for the next round."
"Pours clear gold. Nice dense long lasting head. Sweet malty aroma with fruit notes. Mild with a malty flavor. Biscuity. Very light bitterness in the finish, otherwise no real noticable hop flavor. Balanced and mild overall. Low carbonation and creamy texture. Very drinkable. Definitely a session beer."
"This beer is one that everyone should have. You can quaff this one all night as its flavor is not going to be overpowering nor will the alcohol content kick you in the ass. This is one for drinking with a ton of friends at the local dive bar when all you want to do is have hearty fun and conversation. Better on tap, so if you can find a place that serves it, go there, and knock on the gates to Heaven."
"Pours a dark yellow with a very creamy head. Looks like a yellow Guinness. Good amount of lacing on the glass. Smell is a little grainy, a bit non-descript. Taste is incredibly smooth and dry, which makes for a very pleasant mouthfeel. Easy to see why this would be a great session beer as it is incredibyl easy to drink."
"You can expect to get a thick, creamy head, the cascading effect, and darker yellowish body. Smell is a little weird; metallic, grainy, and a light esters. To my surprise, this was not very tasty. It fact, it reminded me of a creamy, nitro-infused Budweiser. I think the creamy head had more taste than the beer itself. The very smooth mouthfeel is forgiving and keeps my interest. Although the beer is a bit boring, I could actually see myself having one of these from time to time; it's quite sessionable."
"I'll admit that I really wanted to get this beer to check out the nitro-can. It poured a light brown with golden highlights and a nice creamy foamy two finger head. The smell is nice and malty with with a little bit of floral hoppiness. The taste is a little more watery than I expected, with a nice little bit of sweetness with a little bit of maltiness and a slight touch of hops bitterness. The mouthfeel was really nice and creamy while the head was in full effect and a little bit thin after the head dissipates. I'd consider this beer extremely drinkable and I could imagine sitting a pub and knocking back quite a few of these, but I probably won't get it again just for the taste."
"since nitrotap...not a whole lot of acidic taste..."
"Review added 10-28-2007, translated from french 1-26-2008."
"I found this to be a very nice beer. It was purchased in a can and it contained one of those nitrogen balls that when busted is supposed to release nitrogen into the drink and cause a nice head to form. I found it to work rather nicely and the head was beautiful. Overall, the appearance, smell, taste, mouthfeel, and drinkability was exceptional. This is something I could drink regularly."
"Drinkability: Not the most exciting beer I've had, but I really enjoy this one as a session beer. It is quite easy to drink several of these and w/ a low ABV overall, it doesn't hurt too much in the morning."
"This beer is an all around great draught that can be quaffed by the pint in a good pub or at home. In many other beers I would consider the nitro aspect to be a negative factor, but the easy drinkability of Boddingtons captures the essence of a lighter pub draught in my mind. If I want a good bitter or pale ale, I'll get one. If I want an easy drink that quenches the thirst and palate, I'll order a Boddingtons."
"This beer had a nice look to it, a nice dark golden hue that allowed the light to shine through it. Very nice scent, very unique. I could not place many of the scents, and each time I took a sniff there was a nice swirl of new scents. Very unique taste, too. A nice balance, seemed slightly more malty to me than bitter. Again, like the smell, each taste had subtle changes from the previous one. Goes down very smooth. This is going to be a nice addition to my list of ""usuals"" to have on hand."
"This was one of my ""transition"" beers that opened me up to the non-mainstream world. For that I am grateful to it. However, because it opened me up to this world, I now know that there are far superior beers to be had."
"This beer is a step up from drinking Miller, Bud, ect. Not a great beer. But the can always looks cool. An old classic of mine for many many years."
"1 pt can from Albertsons. Poured copper-gold color with a foamy-creamy head. There was virtually no aroma, just an odd sort of metallic scent. Flavor was mild with malts, nuts, pears, and hops. Mouthfeel was light but creamy. (Clearly the palate is this beers appeal.) The finish was short, clean and just a bit biter. Overall this is a quite session-able biter, but it lacks pizazz."
"Pours a golden yellow with a cascading carbonation/nitrogenation that seems to fall down to the bottom of the glass, similar to Guiness. Creamy, frothy white head leaves a slight lacing around the glass. Aroma is almost non-existent. Taste is corn and a slight malt presence. No hops detected. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy, similar to Guiness, but unlike Guiness the taste is rather lacking. Overall, this is simply an average beer. I will not be wasting my money on this beer again."
"Super heavy beer, a meal in a can, but the ABV is not that high"
"Pours 90% frothy creamy head, appears in three layers briefly, then settles into a clear, transluscent auburn ale with a two finger creamy-white head. No observable carbonation which makes me wonder what's holding up that generous head that hangs on with foamy lacing. No discernable smell. Creamy appearance continues. There is a nectar-like silky smooth mouthfeel with a feint sweet taste, a hint of hops but not a lot by any stretch. There is just enough bitter to carry it and you're left with a mild, non-offensive aftertaste. This is a good one to spring on your macro-beer friends but doesn't offer much for anyone who really likes English Ales."
"Overall, I'd say it's an average beer. With all the outstanding British ales available, there's not much to particularly recommend this one."
"Comment: Another unremarkable product from our friends across the pond. Despite my love of ales I guess when consuming products from the empire the sun never set on I will stick with fish and chips."
"This beer pours a clear spun gold color. The head is small, but creamy and lasts until the beer is gone. The aroma is of citrus, but is covered up by so much by the nitro that it is almost none decectable. The taste is only slightly more pronounced than the aroma. It is of citrus with a hint of pine, and a mild finishing bitterness. The mouthfeel is light bodied even though the nitro tries to cover it up. Overall, this is a disappointment. I will not drink this again."
"This brew is golden orange and has a nice creamy white head. I couldn't smell much of anything, but it has a nice taste to it, malty with a hint of banana. The mouthfeel is a bit creamy, but also a bit watery, I need something more. It goes down very smooth...it would be very easy to have more than one."
"Still, a very nice, light bodied, refreshing, simple beer. It really takes talent to make something like this, but it could be better. I still like it."
"Simple beer that goes down easy. Could have a couple of these on a hot day."
"Drinkability: This is the easiest drinking brew I've ever had the pleasure of tasting. A great session beer no doubt. Do not hesitate to try this beer."
"Pours dark yellow from the can into a glass. A nice head which leaves some lacing on the glass. Pleasant aroma, some hop scents and a bit of grainy malt, but nothing to write home about. Some sweet malt in the flavor with some very mild fruitiness and a bit of hop bitterness in the finish. Again, nothing to write home about. Creamy mouthfeel thanks to the nitro cartridge in the can. Nothing really objectionable about this beer, just nothing too exciting either. This could make a decent session beer, but there are lots of ales out there with more interesting flavors."
" Sorry for the shameless plug"
"D- A pretty good beer. Nothing all that special, but would make a good sessionable beverage."
"eh, there are worse things out there."
"D - Overall this was pretty nice on a Thursday night. I would have enjoyed it more had I been outside. Not at all complex but what's there is good."
"Appearance is a clear copper with a thin but creamy head that hangs around. Aroma, A light hint of honey and malt. Taste has light malt and hops that seems watered down, flat. Mouthfeel is light - medium and creamy with light carbonation that makes for an easy drinker though."
"Mouthfeel- Full bodied and thick."
"the nitro in this makes for a beautiful, thick, creamy, long-lasting pure white head and lacing in this clear light copper ale. not much of a nose on this, maybe a hint of sweet malt and some grassy, floral notes. very thin taste...a bit grainy with a lack of malt and hop presence. mouthfeel is helped by the creamy nitro but still kinda watery. this is a sessionable beer but kind of a one-trick pony (the nitro)."
"Drinkability: About as close to perfect as you can come without quite being there."
"Pours a nice golden color with remarkable 2 finger head. The head can definately hold it's own. Very sweet smelling, with little to no hop nose. Taste is almost honey sweet with a pleasant but not exceptional aftertaste. Mouth feel is very smooth and creamy. (cream ale) Drinkablilty is very good since this is a very mild brew. Not a regular by any stretch of the imagination, but a passive cream ale for occasional consumption."
"I had a couple of these yesterday with lunch. Pours into a creamy head, very similar to a golden-colored Guinness. I really wanted to like this beer, but the flavor was slightly bland. Might have been too cold to bring out all the flavors, as most Americans dont know that all beers are not best served ice-cold. Still, a very drinkable beer that I will give another try at a slightly less cold temperature."
"I definatly love this beer. Many people shy away from nitro beers but I feel that it only makes them easier to drink. It gives this beer a very smooth and full bodied taste."
"Must try."
"Beautiful cascading looks with a tightly packed head, golden color. Slight sweetness in the smell. Smooth creamy texture, with hints of sweetness at the front of the mouth that blend nicely with a mild hops in the aftertaste. One of my favorite beers, I could drink this one all night."
"Smells ok. Grassy, a little skunky. Not sold on the taste. Slightly bitter. I'd say it actually leans towards malts rather than hops, which isn't what I was expecting. Not awful, but nothing I'm gonna enjoy. The nice thick creamy head keeps this from being a disastrous choice. The beer itself is quite watery and light. Probably an ok session beer."
"Mouthfeel is all about the creaminess. If this wasn't from England, I would call it a cream ale. I had this with a plate of hot wings, and it was pefect to tame the heat."
"D- the complex yet mild taste and delicate carbonation makes it hard to resist chuggin the entire thing down. i can, and have drank the whole 4 pint can pack in one sitting. thumbs up to boddingtons. i hope they stick around for another couple hundred years."
"Overall, a somewhat generic beer. I know that pales generally are more straight-forward in their profile, but I would like to have something try to take centre stage, and it didn't feel like that was happening here."
"D: Its mildness makes for easy sipping, but it just doesn't have the characteristics I look for in a beer worth trying again. Oddly enough, the cream of Manchester was one of the earliest beers that brought me into the specialty import/craft beer fold. Now, it doesn't seem to stack up against other similar beers, or even the way I used to remember it."
"1 pint of this at a time is enough for me."
"D: Average in the can, but much better on draft."
"This beer has sentimental value for me as it reminds me of my time living in England. It is not the best beer out there but still one that I would have no worries about ordering in a pub or even a can. Thx"
"D - this beer wasnt terrible, but its not bitter enough for me."
"Drinkability: If I must.... but I hope I can get some others to help me finish this f pack of cans...."
"D- Simply put, this is a good, decent beer....very easy to drink with the low carbonation and balanced flavor. I think that I could handle at least a couple of these in a sitting as it's not overly heavy, but heavy enough. I was definately satisfied and have come back to it on a few occasions already in my short beer drinking career and enjoy it a little more each time."
"An easy to drink English Pale, but lacking in the depth and complexity compartment."
"Probably a good session beer. I bet it's better in the pub!"
"The mouthfeel is this beer's only saving grace (if I had to come up with one). Very creamy and smooth with mild carbonation. Certainly does not merit another can in the near future."
"Drinkabity - Not great, but not bad. Well worth a try."
"Overall, a personal favorite, especially on draft. The can has a more disappointing feel, you just don't get the same full head. It's really hard to pour into a pint glass immediately after opening. Minus points for that. On tap it's a different story though. Flavor is satisfyingly crisp and green, and mouthfeel is caresssing."
"Not a beer I enjoy. Would try again in a different serving type, but I wouldn't be hoping for much."
"D- This was good. I will probably pick this up again- if I can find it again."
"Makes a fantastic Black and Tan when used with a Guinness nitro can."
"Slightly thin mouthfeel, but about right for the style. Low abv and smooth taste equal good drinkability."
"After watching the ferocious air bubbles from the nitro can subside, I observed a rich golden color that is not quite copper, but looked similar to some lagers I have seen. The head is creamy and tan. The smell is a hardly noticible sweet English-type scent. Though the flavor is quite watered down, I really liked it and it tastes like pure malt. Very mild, sweet, and flat. This beer is very easy to drink and I could probably chug these all night. It would be best to balance this one out with something more bitter because it really does drink like water."
"This is high-class session beer. The only thing that would limit drinkability is that honestly, I might start to want something with a little more chutzpah as the night progresses. But that's just me."
"Mouthfeel is watery. Can drink a lot of these in a sitting, though I would prefer something with flavor. If you really have the craving for a nitrogenated bitter/pale ale go for Old Speckled Hen."
"I tried this beer for the 1st time on tap and find myself purchasing a 4 pack every now and then. It has a very weak aroma but it surprisingly sweet, it's one of the sweetest beers I've ever tasted. The head filters smoothly and quickly and disappears rather rapidly. Despite the sweetness, this is a very drinkable and enjoyable beer. It goes well with spicy foods (like a nice set of boneless wings). I have yet to homebrew this for various reasons but highly recommend it. Most women love this beer, I think because of it's sweetness."
"Eric"
"I'd call it the dessert beer, because it was the sweetest beer I've ever tried. I didn't find a hint of bitterness with this beer. IMO, it's like no other Ale I tried, not to say it's the best Ale, but in my experience it's the most original so far."
"Despite the over-powering malt sweetness, I think I could do a few of these over the course of an evening"
"All in all, this it the best hiss-pop nitro-thingy beer I've tasted so far."
"This beer was very interesting. Looked like it was going to be very thick at first. It poured an opaque, golden color with a thick white head. After the few minutes, the body became clearer as the beer began to settle. Once the body of the beer settles, the head has good retention and the body becomes a nice, dark amber color. The smell was farily malty although not overbearing. The taste was nice and smooth going down with malts very prevalent. Almost as abrasively malty as a malt liquor beer, but not as pungent or acidic. A nice, thikc mouthfeel that was reminiscent of a Guinness (not the one straight from the tap in Dublin). Nice, smooth, easy drinking. Type of a beer you can drink all night and not even worry about it. Despite the thickness and malty characteristics, not too filling."
"This is my bmc killer; when I want a smooth, cold, somewhat watery beer that I can chug mercilessly, this is it right here. I know that doesn't sound like a ringing endorsement, but to me there are different beers that serve different roles, and this beer fills its role with aplomb. And there's nothing wrong with that."
"Very much a session pint...and a good drink."
"D - I could easily drink this."
"Tried this in a nitro-can. I still don't have the Guinness ""perfect pour"" down, but these Boddingtons cans makes it a cinch. Pours completely head, settles over the course of 2-3 minutes to a 1/4 inch, very creamy, very sturdy head. Almost pure white in color. The beer itself is a golden, coppery color. Mostly clear, just the slightest hint of opacity. Smell is malty, hoppy, smells very much like an ale. Taste is very similar to the scent, though the unbelievably creamy mouthfeel tricks the mind into sensing more maltiness than is probably there. The mouthfeel is amazing, rich like cream, and amazingly thick for an ale. The drinkability is good. I'm personally not a huge fan of ales in general, so it's not quite my favorite, but the mouthfeel really brings it together quite a bit. I'm sure for an ale lover this would be a must-have."
"Pours a very clear, slightly copper color with a thick, soapy white head, and the classic nitro cascading bubbles. lots of little bubbles clinging to the glass. Nice head retention. Relatively fresh smelling. Smells a bit of yeast and malt. Not alot of hop presence. Nice maltiness to the taste i wish it had more hops to balance it out. Very creamy mouthfeel. An interesting beer for me to try, but i wish it had more flavor."
"I hadn't ever tried this beer, but we were at a high-priced restaurant for dinner, and this seemed like the best offering from their beer list. It is rather pretty, a nice gold color with a very thick white head. Mostly nondescript thereafter. A mild grain aroma. Somewhat sweet taste with a little bit of hops. But it was refreshing, and I would imagine it to be sessionable."
"this is actually the first time i've ever tried this beer i think. i am really suprised. the beer practically bursts out of the can upon opening and when poured produces a super creamy white head. tiny bubbles float to the top giving it nice eye appeal. the smell has something to be desired. a cross between beer and cat urine. definitly not a great smell but 100 times better than some american macros i've tried. the taste is very creamy. very smooth. i can definitly feel the pub style thing going on. if you close your eyes you're almost there. very mellow flavors. very sessionable. i definitly dig the nitro version of this more than the guinness nitro, if the two can be compared."
"I like this stuff. It was what I expected it to be for a Pub-style Ale. I drank it from the can, so I can't say much about appearance. The head was very creamy though. It smells a little bitter, but in a good way. I could definitely buy a 4-pack and enjoy them through the night. When drinking it, it makes you feel like you're in an English Pub. It's a smooth, very drinkable pale ale and has just the right bitterness. Authentic and enjoyable. Pick it up."
"D- Certainly could be worse, but for someone looking for a lot of varying aromas or flavors it doesn't have a whole lot to offer, yet nonetheless, I certainly found it drinkable and would have no problem drinking another."
"This beer looks much better than it tastes or smells. It produces a rich creamy looking head from the nitro wigit, and the body is golden with a slight amount of haze. This Pub Ale smells very metallic, and that's pretty much it. It seems to have a slight ginger taste. Something I find unique. Lastly, for an ale this tastes a bit ""lagery."""
"Very smooth and easy to drink...will order this one again and not just to amuse the local 'bar flys'."
"Overall an eh beer cause there's not much there, there. Realiable and dependably boring."
"Drinkability: as its called  pub ale - means a nice session beer to have while talking it up at the pub. Just wish there was some aroma here."
"Virtually no aroma here. Slight maltiness. No hop scent. The taste is smooth and creamy, with a crispness at the end not really a hop character to me, but a definite finish to the taste is present. As much as I love the nitro can widget, I have to say that on tap there is absolutely no off-flavor present that the widget can sometimes provide."
"D--- To much cane sugar in the grist most likely caused the cider aroma and thinned out the body. The metallic taste could only come from the can so I'm not sure if the aluminum was exposed or just a poorly crafted can. Honestly, it was just awful"
"D- Bland mouthfeel detracts. The mild flavour and light feel make it easy enough to down. Would quench your thirst on a hot day. An OK beer, but not one I intend to ever buy again."
"Pours a deep golden color with a nice white head. Always nice to watch the nitros settle in my opinion, although this isnt as nice as the stouts. Aroma is faint with a little fruit in there. Taste is a little malty and more of the fruit. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth with little carbonation as typical of the nitro. This is an easy drinker, decent towards the end of a session. Nothing spectacular here, just an easy drinking, low flavor, pale ale."
"Overall impression: Very enjoyable. Well balanced and dead-on for the style. Not sure if the nitro can affected the clarity or what. I'm assuming they filter this beer but the clarity was pretty dull on this one. Nothing outstanding but it's beer. I guess that's why it's an ""ordinary"" bitter. Lives up to it's classification."
"And then my opinion began to fade a bit. This beer smelled like nothing. Taste was also very mild and (dare I say it?) boring. Mouthfeel was extremely flat, particularly given how much head this beer initially had. I feel like there's an appeal that I'm not detecting, but as it was, I thought it was pretty marginal."
"A very bland beer, and not nearly what I expected."
"Have had this several times: initially, when I didn't know any better, I was a bit taken by it. The color is a pale pale translucent yellow. This has a massive head (due to the nitro); it just comes pouring out. While this is pleasing to watch, I can't help but feel that using the nitro is cheating. This had a weak smell: faint hops and esters. The taste was fairly bland: creamy and buttery. Not very complex at all. The nitro again helped out with the mouthfeel; it is a pleasure to drink something with this much carbonation. However, there are better beers to go to then this."
"(16 oz. tall nitro/widget can)"
"Mouthfeel, in my opinion, is exceptional. It has that creamy feel to it that helps it go down better. The flavor is of honey and light fruit. It's very hard to find a flavorful, thick beer around here and this is definitely that. I don't understand why the rating on this site isn't a little bit higher."
"Pint-sized nitro-can, served in a nonic. After pouring, it cascades for awhile and settles to an unfiltered, almost lifeless, light amber that is topped with a thick inch of dense, cream head that leaves heavy sheets of lacing and retains a half-inch throughout. The aroma is light, sweet and doughy, with hints of caramel/bubblegum and maybe some fruits (pear?) .The flavor adds to this only hints of leafy/green hops and the beer is light in body, carbonation, and finish, but it is fairly smooth. Seem to remember it being a little better than this - definitely not seeking it out again."
"I generally will not buy beer in a can because of that tinny taste that it lends the beer. This one is quite bitter and void of malty sweetness so perhaps that masks that quality. One thing I like about this beer is the nitrous which makes it truly creamy. It's not the most amazing beer I've ever had but it's very pleasant. It's comforting like a mashed potatoes."
"D: I'd have a few as the lower abv and the decent taste make it a good one to have when you are having a few."
"Cheers!"
"Excellent readily available pale ale. Pop the top and pour quickly for a good head, with an full-bodied hearty taste. Pours clear and a deep dark amber with a pleasant crisp smell. Very easy to drink several of these, with the 4.7% ABV, and it's a pleasant everyday ale, great with a meal."
"Pours a golden color with creamy off white head that it retains very well. Aroma is malty and grainy. Some fruitiness is there. Malty flavor with noticeable but not prominant hop bitterness in the finish. Medium light mouthfeel. This beer is clearly well made, but its not very interesting."
"Drinkability is decent."
"Drinkability: I thought this was highly sessionable and drinkable beer. An honest working class british brew. I will buy it again!"
"Pours a creamy, yellow white color before the nitrogen head separates. After that, it's got that thick, tenacious nitro head (bone white) atop a very clear, light orange amber body. The nose features some banana notes, cooked grains, and mild caramel malts. On the palate, there's a touch of carbonation first off, then mild, slightly sour pale malts and a dry, biscuity finish. Mouthfeel is very smooth and light, but not, to my mind, in a bad way -- it just makes this beer very drinkable. Overall, this beer is not nearly as good out of the can as it is on draft, but it's still a decent session beer."
"It was happy hour and I figured this would be a better way to try this beer than buying a 4 pack. Golden color with a nice white head and retention. Almost no smell, and what there was just reminded me of stale bread. Taste was very light with a hint of earthy hops. Couldn't make out any grain, but at least it was inoffensive and washed down my food."
"The taste is not overwhelming either. It is more bitter than anything, with a pretty strong aftertaste. There is a malt balance, but it's muted. It's not offensive, but it's not anything special either. Pretty average. Mouthfeel is nice and creamy, but the body is a bit thin. Overall this beer is nicer to look at than to drink. I don't know how many I would have of these, but I'm glad I tried it. It's worth at least that."
"Beer pours cloudy thanks to the nitro. Its a very light gold/yellow and a head which sticks around (again thanks to the nitro). Smell is slightly sweet. The mouthfeel is very creamy and light. I would compare this to a vanilla Guinness. Smooth and easy to drink, this is one British beer I'll be returning to."
"D -This is pretty much as quaffable as a beer can be, unfortunately, it isn't a bit more refreshing and it has virtually no flavor. It is easy for something to be drinkable with no flavor."
"Drinkability: I'm sure it's easy to chug a pint of Boddies, but it's not particularly exciting to sip and I have no desire to pick up another four-pack."
"D: Quite good."
"Overall this beer is easy to drink and session. There is not anything offensive but also not much to impress. It is much like most other nitro beersit looks great but things are downhill after that."
"This beer poured a clear golden color with a thick head that formed after the cascading effect of the nitro-can. The smell is a bit floral and malty. The taste is bitter but not overpowering. It is well balanced with the malt. The mouthfeel is full and creamy but not chewy. I find this to be a delightful beer which I have enjoyed on many occasions and hope to do so again."
"This is one of my favorite beers to session."
"The beer pours into a gorgeous cascading whirlpool of goodness. It really is a sight. The head is snow white and thick. It never lets up throughout the whole journey. Unfortunately it's the best thing about the ale. The smell is kind of wheaty like budweiser or miller. Not that bad, but not much better. The taste is kind of bland in my opinion. Not a whole lot going on. It has a slight hoppy taste and a pretty strong apple taste. It's fruity but not very complex. The mouthfeel is similar to guiness, but I prefer guiness. It's a refreshing beer. Easy to drink and above average. Not all that special though."
"DA: Good feel, not so great flavor."
"D- a very drinkable beer, could go through a few of them, tastes much, MUCH better off tap"
"This beer's cascade effect rivals that of Guinness's, which as you may know is quite a feat. It pours a creamy white liquid that slowly and wavily transforms into a golden translucent lager. The smell is non existant. The taste is big, and much like what you'd think a cream ale would be. Lots of body to it which is thick to move your tongue through. A foamy head stays on for the duration of this beer, even when the liquid itself has been finished. A great example of a cream ale."
"Utterly still golden amber with a thick and dense milk-white nitro-induced head. The head is going nowhere fast, and there is a considerable amount of splotchy lacing left on the glass. Nose is melon, green apple, floral hops, and a light presence of caramel malts. Pleasant flavors of fresh plum juice, honeydew, and a hint of banana mix with barely-there biscuity malt and a nicely contrasting bitter bergamot-infused hop finish. A little bit of mineral character comes through in the finish as well. Hop bitterness lingers. As it warms, this hop flavor begins to resemble the spiciness of Saaz. It's surprising how much this tastes like an English attempt at a Belgian pale. Thin mouthfeel really makes this a close-but-no-cigar semblance of a cask ale. Actually, it's nowhere near the flavor or consistency of a cask ale, but the nitro widget is put to what is likely its maximum performance here. A quality beer in my book."
"I really enjoy Boddingtons. I have had it in a pint sized nitro can, that one must take care when opening. I learned the hard way, beer on the poker table...anyhow. A fine gold in color with a one to two fingered head. Very creamy in both taste and smell. Very easy drinking. It goes down easy."
"Cheers! What a great over all drinking beer. The nitrogen makes it taste like a milk shake. Honey flavor was detected as well as coffee. I could just see going to a pub in England and sharing this brew in a tall mug with my good buddys. The big, yellow can stands out in the crowd of boring, drab colored beers. Pour a cold one and watch the giant head vanish before your eyes."
"Drinkability- I could drink about eight with out trouble but any more I may fall a few times"
"Pours a nice Nitro style orange...nose is fruity (apples and pears)....slight biscuit...medium bodied but the nitro gives it a watery, creamy feel....decent enough taste for the style...fruity (apples and pears) with a subtle biscuity maltiness....finishes dry...low hops...more of a mild in my opinion....decent enough but nothing I'll buy again.."
"Pours honey golden yellow with typical nitro-style can head. The head is very dense, creamy and leaves Belgian lacing all the way down to the end. Smells mild overall but has an weak clove and honey aroma. Tastes very watery. Low ratings on taste and mouth feel reflect the lack of flavor rather than bad flavor."
" When I opened this beer it gushed out all over the counter. I guess thats why it says ""carefully open"" on the back of the can."
"Get my buzz on- n"
"On tap at Fionn MacCools in Jacksonville Beach. Straw yellow, hazed from streaming bubbles. Huge head. Aroma was very mild and almost all malt. Taste was similar, mild malt with a soft hop balance. Mouthfeel was creamy and medium body, although this probably was due to the high carbonation. Overall, quite pleasant and refreshing, but nothing to excite you from a taste standpoint."
"The flavor is interesting. There is no complexity whatsoever to this beer. There is no chemistry on the tongue or the pallet--just a consistant, creamy taste. I like this beer quite a bit for some reason. Maybe it's the presentation. I have also had it at the bar and I can say it tastes better when being pumped from a hand pump, cask style."
"Drinkability: This is a fairly well-balanced brew. It is sweet, creamy, and unoffensive, especially when consumed around the lower temp. range (I found it best around 40°F). Sessionable if you like English Ales."
"If you can find it, and lets be honest - if this is available in NZ, its available everywhere - give it a go."
"Drinkability-- this goes with about anything. It's not a strong dark beer, it's not overly dark, and was liked even by the party-goers who are more light-ale or even US-fodder fans."
"Boddingtons has been enjoyed by beer drinkers in England for more than 200 years, and is well known for its creamy head and smooth body. It is now sold in over 30 countries worldwide, and can be drunk on tap in places as far afield as New Zealand and Hong Kong. Boddingtons is positioned as a premium import in its overseas markets, and this sector has seen rapid growth in the last ten years, as drinkers are keen to experiment with different beer styles and tastes, and often drink beers they remember from places they have traveled to."
"Personally, I find it slightly sweet and mild. Not a beer of choice, but worth a shot."
"Drinkability: With no overpowering flavors, this beer is fairly drinkable. It certainly is much better on tap. I have had these out at bars and remembered enjoying them much more. Overall, the can is a disappointment."
"Drinkability - this is not very good, so it's not sessionable."
"D: This is good session beer if youre into the taste. It goes down easy and isnt too filling, but I found the taste and kick lacking pretty significantly."
"Boddingtons, when you get down to it, is just downright nasty. It looks good. Pours an awesome crème' head with a sort of horse piss looking body. The smell is interesting, a little buttery, but not much else. Taste is just $#@%#^T awkward! Its creamy, offensive, and bitter at the same time. I keep giving it chances to win me over, but every time I try before I finish a pint it hits my yacking mechanism. Its much better to start out drinking this, because if you have any other beer before this, it reminds you of milk. The mouthfeel is typical nitro flat fluff. The drinkability is just gross, I still can't get used to it. Don't know how the Brit's drink it, but I gotta hand it to them blokes for staying with it!"
"A good session beer, and one that's readily available."
"Poured from a yellow nitro can, complete with serving instructions on the label. Appearance is a clear golden yellow with a full thick bright white head that slowly fell to about a half finger that lingered the duration of the pint glass. Smells light and mild, very light nose, mostly sweet and light aromas of grain and malt. Taste is also mild and has a light bready sweetness, similar to light honey and wheat. Has a light bitterness about it in the start and finish of the taste. Mouthfeel is slippery smooth and creamy on the tongue. Low levels of carbonation pairs well with this beer's lighter body. Drinkability is high, due to the excellent smoothness and refreshing characteristics that make this an ideal easy drinker. Although practically every characteristic of this beer could be considered light and far from outstanding, I found this beer to be quite enjoyable and easy to find anywhere beer is sold."
"Drinkability - I would recommend this to others but in mild doses. Relatively bland compared to other flavorful beers that I've tried."
"This is one of my favorites from the nitro-can, so I jumped on the opportunity to try it on draft at cobblestones in York, PA. Set in front of me with all but an inch being creamy, upside down waterfall head. Beautiful. The smell is slightly bitter, nothing extraordinary. When the head finally settled to an inch or two, the first sip is deep and refreshing, with a slightly more berrylike finish than the canned version. I love the mustache people get when drinking this beer. As drinkable as water, you can really throw these down if you want to. You don't much feel the alchohol until the second or third boddingtons, as it comes on rather smooth. If you like the can, you'll love the draft."
"Dull gold appearance  decent head- nose cream, honey and skunk- bitter taste has honey and basil - aftertaste bitter taste lingering  this beer looks gorgeous in a glass, however , the taste does not stand up to its beauty Dull gold appearance  decent head- nose cream, honey and skunk- bitter taste has honey and basil - aftertaste bitter taste lingering  this beer looks gorgeous in a glass, however , the taste does not stand up to its beauty"
"great beer, goes down easy, great example of english ale."
"Cool yellow nitro-can ... pours a crisp and lively amber color, starting as all head! The head is epic in size and lasts forever. Nose is of roasted malts, slightly floral, and modest hop notes. Palate is super smooth malt, a little bready, and a touch of hop bitterness throughout. Mouthfeel is excellent ... silky, medium-bodied, and sufficient carbonation. This is one of the better beeers I've had ... in a can anyway. Very, very drinkable and enjoyable. Worth a try for sure ..."
"For such a popular ale, this is quite a disappointment. Granted, it's not bad, but it's fairly dull. Give it a try if you're curious. If you prefer a beer with lighter flavor, this might be for you. Otherwise, it's hardly a beer you'll come back to."
"Boddington's Pub Ale pours a light copper color with a white head after a typical nitro pour from a one pint can. I really just can't smell anything. Might as well not have anything in my glass from the aroma. Some caramel flavors, but also tannic/woody like flavors to finish it off. Hops are slightly noticeable, but not a major component. Creamy head and silky texture from the nitro. Worth a try."
"I do enjoy this beer. Consider it a guilty pleasure, I takes the place of Guinness in the summer. I suggest this as the first step to get some one off bud, miller etc. onto real beer,"
"Boddingtons advertises itself as ""Smooth and Creamy."" This is definitely true, and the one redeeming characteristic of this beer. This stuff actually seems like the British equivalent of our BMC, though they do a much, much better job than A-B, Coors, and the like (though that's not saying much). Good session beer, but for the same price I'd much rather grab a Tetley's."
"Creamy smooth mouthfeel."
"I'd prefer it on tap, but Boddingtons Pub Ale is a respectable little brew. Mild, creamy, and smooth - it's perhaps the antithesis of what most BeerAdvocates are looking for, but a good occasional treat nonetheless."
"16 ounce nitro can. Pours a beautiful light, golden amber color with a thin off white head that lingers gracefully in the glass. Some sticky lacing clings to the glass after every sip. Aroma is of mild sweet malt. Taste is mild and slightly sweet with just touch of hop bitterness. I think I will have another."
"Drinkability: this beer is easy to drink. Its balanced body (not too thick, not too light), sizeable head, excellent lacing, smooth taste and moderate alcohol content make it a respectable pale ale."
"It's amazing what nitro can do to an otherwise boring beer. As with all nitros, this has incredible thickness and creaminess in the head. I've never had a beer to lace better. As for a pub ale, it's lightly hazy and medium straw colored--I expected more copper color. Aromas are extremely faint, but I can pick up some light malt, corn, and a little sourness. Tastes are fairly muted as well, but do pick up on some subtle sweetness, corn sugar, and maybe some other cereal grains. Light souring from fermentation provides a bit of granny smith apple flavor. That's basically it. Not much more exciting than Budweiser. But the mouthfeel is where it is at. Creamy and full feeling. Almost chewey. Finishes wet and fleeting. Dangerously close to watering down. My advice: Drink it quickly, because after the nitro disipates, this beer gets boring in a hurry."
"D: Very easy to drink. Maybe too easy."
"Not a lot to this beer. The pour was the best part. But there isn't a lot to say about this beer. Good to have when you're having more than one, I guess."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkable? While it doesn't win many points for taste, I have to admit that Boddingtons really just slides down my gullet. It's a light, weak, watery beer that looks real pretty. If quantity is your thing, then Boddingtons may be also. A curious beer."
"The mouthfeel is a bit creamy but mostly just watery and thin, little to no bite on the tongue. You could almost drink this like water, but it would be about as exciting. There are great qualities about this brew, but its inconsistencies are unpleasant. There's a lot better EPA's out there."
"Mouthfeel is creamy but there is a lack of any flavors that make me want to continue drinking this. There is also a vague graininess that doesn't seem like it should be there. It should be a bit more clean. Tiny bitter finish is barely enough for an enjoyment. This is a palate cleanser for me."
"Goes down easy doesn't necessarily taste bad, but there's nothing to make me want another either."
"I really did not like this. It just seemed extremely watery. I dont' think this had any carbonation whatsoever. Maybe it was flat, who knows? But even if I got a bad brew I don't see how this would possibly be something I'd get time and time again. I could taste the hops towards the middle, but the beer got pretty nasty towards the bottom. I would never drink this again, unless it was free. I'm kind of upset I bought this."
"drinkability: a little to bitter without the sweetness or taste to balance it out."
"Drinkability; Drinkable? Yes. Sessionable? Yes. Memorable? No. I purchased one can to try for $2. I'm not disappointed I gave this a shot, but I probably will not go out of my way to try this again."
"Boddingtons Pub Ale has a time and a place, unfortunatly that place in not at the top of a BAs list. The appearance of this beer is pretty cool, the nice cascading pour and the crisp golden color with a creamy white head. That is when the novelty wears off. Taste is of an ale thats pale, but not the other way around. Slight hoppy aroma and flavor but nothing that jumps out at you, a pale malt flavor that is more grainy and anything. It tastes sort of watered down. They have this at one of my favourite downtown bars on tap, Brits Pub, and I can drink the hell out of it down there when I am out for a night, but for someone trying to enjoy a beer at home, well, NEXT!"
"Notes: I'll pass on this one and I'll pass on ""almost"" every english pale."
"Drinkability: This was frankly almost unbearable to drink as I had better choices in the fridge. Hopefully you have better choices than this beer. I will not purchase this again."
"D - Easy to drink for sure, maybe a bit low in the flavour profile."
"Despite its lack of substantial taste, it is really quite drinkable. Nothing offensive in either, just a creamy taste and feeling."
"D=this beer is really smooth, with low carbonation, I guess that is due to the nitro can/its style. I could not drink alot of it, but I know many people who can."
"I thought this was a very nice ale. One of the best 'smooth' pale ales I've ever had. I ordered a pint at the pub and I was really glad to see the thick head that would last 'till the very last sip. It has a very smooth mouthfeel and it's really easy to drink. There wasn't much hop presence or bitterness at all, although I could sense a slight bitterness after a few sec. The sweet malt was very inviting, but probably not strong enough for experienced drinkers. A very good pub ale, though."
"This is a good, drinkable ale. It's so creamy and smooth (and perhaps watery) you almost don't notice it going down. Great foamy head. Good golden look. Smell and taste, well, not very strong. It's a great beer to start or finish with, cuz it'll either get you into the flow of things or cleanse your palate. It's kind of like a mouthwash if you will, which probably isn't the kindest description, but apt none the less."
"Overall: An average ale saved by mediocrity by virtue of its nitro head."
"Definitely a good session beer. It's not very exciting, but it has a good flavor and there's nothing offensive about it."
"Drinkability: Since there was little flavor in this, You can probably chug a couple down if you wanted to. Everything except for the appearance, was just bad. I won't spend another $2 for this beer again."
"D - easily downed, and very light"
"Now if someone would please show me how to play poker."
"Overall this is pretty drinkable. It's not the best beer ever, but it seems to be a good sessioner and would probably make for an inoffensive beer to serve to someone only used to Bud and Miller. The nitro might be taking a lot of the flavor from the beer -- I'd be interested in trying it on-tap at some point."
"D - Not much to make me want more of this but for a person who wants to sit for a long session and not wear out their palate this c ould be ok."
"overall this is a nice kick back beer to have on a hot day. would be nice to have while doing yard work."
"Best widget beer I've tried. Recommended."
"Drinkability: I like this beer it is very clean tating especially from a can I would love to try this on nitro tap."
"Poured from the nitro can with a thin body and very thick, creamy head. The head was white and creamy as hell and the body was a shade lighter than the average pale ale, but still ambery and stuff. Smells like alkaline water, grain and light floral hops with an equal mix of bittering hops. The mouth is smooth, very light hops, light malt, just an all around good drinking beer. Very easy to drink, but not one I'm going to be looking out for in the future."
"Nitro can poured a beautiful white head that is sustaining very well. Nose is of very faint graininess and not much else. Taste is of British water, grains, and finishes with a decent bittering hop. Mouthfeel is extremely creamy, top-notch, but a bit thin for the style. Drinkability is pretty good, definitely a session beer that is creamy smooth. Worth a try but not one i would go out of my way for."
"Body is below medium, with a very creamy mouthfeel from the nitro pour, and a somewhat thin texture with medium drinkability."
"Final verdict: Meh. If it's around, I'll drink it, but I don't think I'll buy it again. These nitro-capsules aren't really a good idea when you're talking about taste."
"This beer pours a cloudy cream color that quicly clears up into a golden color with a creamy head. There is a slight smell of vanilla. The taste is like a watered down ipa. It has a certain degree of bite with it. The mouthfeel is quite bitter. A lasting bitterness in the aftertaste that is less than desireable. The drinkability is average but this is not a beer I will likely purchase again."
"The overall flavor is good, but with a metallic, slightly bitter aftertaste. That is really the only real fault this beer has in my opinion. Great color and appearance add to the overall rating."
"Fairly drinkable. Would be a nice session brew if not for the aftertaste."
"Pours deep gold, with a slightly imperfect clarity. An eggshell colored head of whipped cream consistency shows the typical nitro-can retention. Abundant lacing creates a jigsaw pattern of lace. A winey aroma can be detected in the background, accompanied by pale malt and fuggles hops. A very even balance of sweet pale malt and fuggles is the foundation of the taste; but an annoying vinous flavor is apparent from the first sip to the last swig. Simple but pleasent taste, and appropriate to style. A fruity ester appears in the aftertaste only as it warms. The nitro creates a flat carbonation, but is creamy and very smooth in the medium body and boosts the drinkability. However, the finish is slick and the acidic vinous character ruin the overall presentation and knock this out of contention for a good session ale."
"Not a whole lot going on in the smell department, but nothing bad either. That's probably this beer's weakest point. Tastes of malt, with a little bit of bite to it. Mouthfeel is where Boddingtons really shines. Creamy - I often find myself drinking these faster than I should to get the creaminess out of that middle layer, before it settles out. This time I took my time, and it does lose something if you wait too long and miss that creamyness. I could drink a lot of these - it's a consistent, tasty and reliable beer."
"Pours a very clear, golden yellow witha big, foamy white head that settles and laces the glass nicely. Very faint aromas, traces of some sweetness (honey?) and some hoppy/floral aromas as well. Mild in taste. More of the same. A little sweetness, a little bitterness, but overall very clean. Mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy. This is definately the highlight of the beer, and why I regularly return to it. Very drinkable. The mild taste and nice mouthfeel make this this beer. Nothing too special, but it is nice too drink. Not one of my alltime favourites or the best in the world, but I would recommend it."
"				~Benjamin Franklin"
"To me, Boddingtons is the ""caramel"" version of the ""chocolate"" Guinness if that makes sense. From the cascade to the head consistency, the feel in the mouth to the fairly intense lacing - they're very similar. It's a smooth and very drinkable beer that you can just put down without even realizing. The appearance is simple but pleasant with a light honey color. The head is thick and marshmallow like, and it just won't go away. Not much of a nose, which would probably be its biggest problem. This is a classic though, and because of that, its not the most complex. It's a staple, not something that pushes the boundaries, and it should be appreciated as such. It's best on draught and pairs well with many deserts."
"Picked up a nicely chilled 4 pack. Popped the top and got a great surge that I poured into a goblet. What a cool 2 stage head! Creamy white top, off white center and cloudy golden ale on the bottom. Very creamy head. Ale smells hoppy. The head sticks strongly to the side of the goblet. Taste is smooth and creamy, great carbonation. The sweet flavor shoots right down the center of the mouth and the finish is strong but reserved. This is a very creamy and tasty ale. I have tanked down quite a few of these ales in the past but now I am finally reviewing. I recommend. Need to try it topping a nice thick stout."
"drinkability: well i must say i have found a new session beer. this could be drank by the case."
"Pours out a foamed up nitro concotion that loses its carbonated look quickly. Turns to a gold\amber clear brew with a 1 finger head. Has a yeast type smell to it not much else.Very neutral tasting,slightly sweet,kinda watery but in reality not too bad,,a summery beer. Mouthfeel ,,there is none drinkability is pretty good i could have a few of these."
"Da nice light ale that I could drink several of. Very smooth, creamy and light."
"It has a nice, light mouthfeel. Very low carbonation with a light body. Quite creamy. Overall, this beer is very drinkable. The low carbonation makes it go down smooth. While it is not a particularly interesting or complex beer, it is a good beer if stuck in a bar with a limited selection and hanging around with friends [that's how I ended up with it]."
"It does pour nice into a pint glass and settles also very nicely. Taste seems to be greatly affected by temp. more so than other beers and ales. If this is chilled just to much, it seems to lose all its flavor. When at the correct serving temp, it does have a nice taste to it. This is my ""Oh why did I drink so much of (INSERT BEER NAME HERE) last night"" beer. It is a very silky drink and much easier going down if you had a few to many of a mass produced beer the night before. Nothing amazing here but nothing offending either. At $7.99us for a 4-pack, you can probably do a LOT better..."
"Pours a medium golden yellow, with the classic nitro precipitation that settles into a tight, uniform white head that doesn't dissipate the whole way down and leaves substantial lacing. Smell is a little on the light side, the downside of the nitro injection: Looks fabulous, but tends to impact the smell and taste. Anyway, what there is smells of roasted malts and grains. Taste is along the same lines, malty with a burnt overtone. Mouthfeel is creamy and very smooth, but kind of thin, but the drinkability is very good. This is a nice looking english pale, although a little light and not at all hoppy. Sort of an americanized english beer with a great deal of the traditional British character taken out in favour of North American aesthetics."
"Good, not stellar."
"It's a slightly above average brew and certainly better on draught. I wish there were some more complexity for this style. Mainstream in it's own way, but also an enjoyable beer in the big picture of beers available."
"worth a try."
"This Pale Ale pours a thick yellow, sort of semi-clear with thick big creamy white head of nitro-foam. Has all the characteristic lacing of a nitro-beer. Smell is citrus and is it my imagination stoked by the bees on the can or is it honey? Nope the taste is honey with citrus flowers and a hint of butter. It's smooth, very smooth with a quick bite at the end. Mouthfeel is light bodied but full with the nitro. A lot of folk don't like the use of nitrogen in beer and it does even the flavor out a bit but I do like the creaminess it imparts to the brew."
"I tried this out of the can. Light colored. Very thick head but it disapates well. Nice creamy, malty, roasted flavor. Like the aftertaste. Maybe even a dry flavor. Very smooth on the carbonation. Not my favorite, but a good casual beer that would go well with food or without."
"This is one of my old favorites. Apparently its a very weak version if the original but its still tastey, among the best of nitro can beers."
"Fantastically smooth, creamy pub ale. Pours thick with a nice big head that lasts and lasts. This a lick-foam-off-your-lip-and-grin type of beer. Smell has a hint of honey and steel. mouthfeel is incredibly smooth like melted ice cream. Tastes fine, with hints of malt, milk, nuts. The hops in here are evident and maybe a bit overdone. i want my pub ales to be creamy and smooth, not really hoppy at all. i can take this or leave it from the can, but i hear its better on draft."
"Pours a clear yellow, thick big creamy white head forms, laces well and sticks around. Smell is honey, vanilla, citrus and dirty socks. Taste is honey and vanilla, little bit of citrus and floral. Mouthfeel is light bodied, with low carbonation. Not too bad, better fresh."
"Poured on-tap at Brit's pub in Pasadena, CA, a pub owned by a Liverpudlian ex-pat. This beer poured beautifully with a nice thick head and decent lacing. The color was mainly yellow and there was mild carbonation. The smell was much like an american macro-lager with a bit more malt: somewhat of chemicals. The taste was not as good as some other bitters I've had, but it wasn't awful either. Not too complex. It had a very clean and refreshing mouthfeel but the aftertaste ruined it for me. I used to enjoy this beer greatly, now I find it a nice beer once in a while when I am in the mood for it, but not something I would drink regularly."
"I'm not much of a fan of nitro-beer. I think this may be the first one I've ever reviewed. It pours a golden color with a bodacious foamy head. The white foam across the top almost has the consistency of pudding. The smell is pretty faint and boring. The taste is decent, sweet malts, and a fruity hop taste here and there. I just dislike the mouthfeel on these nitros. Too thin and watery. Always seems to remind me of an old beer that was opened, put back in the fridge, and then resorted to several days later. Not a bad beer otherwise, I'd like to try it on-tap, or atleast in a different serving type."
"The taste is not much to write home about however. The taste was ok and very buttery with smooth malts and hints of sweetness, but nothing really notable. It was quite a bland mix, but something you must buy if only to admire the beauty of these nitro heads."
"not something that i would drink on a regular basis, or ever again. just not my glass of beer i guess."
"I have known Bodingtons for over a year but this is the first time I am reviewing it. I love the initial pour of the beer as it settles, the color and the sight of the beer setteling is a sight to behold, as well as the creamy head it leaves behind. I really enjoy the fact that the head stays throughout the entire beer, even at the very end there is still a head in which to enjoy the beer. Although, the smell is a bit wheaty, and I find, that there is not too much to the smell. The taste is very good, coupled with the incredibly smooth mouthfeel, this is pure pleasure to the tastebuds. I do enjoy this beer, but I usually like to eat something along with it, (eg: a meal, Chips or Penuts) otherwise towards the end of the beer a bad aftertaste develops and needs to be neutralized with a different taste. Overall this is a really good beer and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking to try something new."
"The flavor was, as the can proclaims ""smooth and creamy"". It could have been fuller, however it was quite complex. Started bitter, became a bit sweet, and then finished bitter."
"Luckily I got a single of this at a dollar rack somewhere. Very glad I never shelled out the $8-$9 for a 4 pack of pints."
"This is one that I have been drinking for years and continually pick up when I find a place that sells the four pack of pint cans. Even better when you can find it on tap."
"Fortunately this one is available all over the place on tap. The appearance of this one is so unique and awesome. It fizzes off 3 shaded with dark yellow, pale yellow, and the most enduring white head you've ever seen. Can't be beat. Banana in the nose and the flavor with English bitterness. I get a glass of this one 90% of the time I find it."
"Overall Impression: A very enjoyable beer. It just screams session. Im going to have to pick some up just for football games. Flavor is unique and mild, looks just outstanding, about the only dings are aroma and the mouthfeel gets a bit flat toward end, but I wouldnt change a thing. Obvious why its lasted since 1778, theyll be drinking this in 2078 and beyond. Classic beer!"
"the appearance is a caramel/honey color with a nice white head. the smell is very slight with an almost sweet odor. the taste is a mixture of sweet and bitter with a nasty almost chemical-like aftertaste. the mouthfeel is medium-bodied with a slightly creamy texture. this beer is not all that great of a drinker IMO."
"This is quite possibly the only beer that I'll give rave reviews about because of mouthfeel and apperance instead of taste & smell. Everyone should try Boddingtons at least a few times in their life, it's a treat."
"I was pleasantly surprised with this beer. For some reason I was expecting something less. I think I'll go grab another..."
"D - This is my kind of light beer!!!!"
"This one deserves respect."
"The caramel sweetness and bitterness balance nicely and invite another pint."
"Short, dense, creamy, white nitro head. Milky gold/orange cascade settles to a clear, clear orange-gold beer. Nose is fairly faint, with fruity bananas shouldered out some by that creamy nitro ink. More nitro ink in front, some cream and fruit. Creamy thick through the middle, with pronounced apples. Finish is somewhat bitter with sourish apples. The nitro obscures what are probably some nice, fruity, malty tastes. Still, enjoyable and chock full of nice memories for me."
"Drinkability: 4.0"
"This is a very nice and smooth pub ale that goes down wonderfuly after a long day at work. It Pours into a glass somewhat resembling a pint of Caffereys or Kilkenny but slightly lighter in color, certainly nice to look at. Smell is nothing special, but it does taste quite good, slightly bitter with a delicate caramel-esque aftertaste. Mouthfeel is interesting, the foam is very thick and creamy and that makes for an interesting feeling in the mouth. This beer is very very drinkable, nothing offensive in this beer at all and i would definitely reccomend this one."
"If I'm at bar with only macro stuff or lame micro options sometimes I'll get this on nitro (tap) which is better than the can. This is one of the few beers I do not mind drinking, on nitro (tap), cold."
"I've always wanted to try this beer since i see it at my local meijer grocery store as well as the high class liqour store i got to. The head was awesome, to put it in very un-eloquent terms, but the flavor did not back up the apperance of the beer. The smell reminded me of cream soda. But the flavor of the beer didn't back up the smell. The beer tasted as if it were flat but the head proved otherwise. My rocomendation, do not try this beer unless you like flat tasting beer."
"What a bizarre beer! Pours a ridiculously thick head which, when viewed from directly above, looks like milk. A thick, orange beer with loads of carbonation evident. It's pretty frightening to look at, to tell the truth. Smell isn't half bad--just relatively simple. There is a perfume-y apple juice smell, laden with pungent notes of other fruits (banana and pear, I think). The taste is bland and safe, but not bad--the same fruity smells surface on the palate. But there is an awful pang of plastic midway through that is really pretty disgusting. (Fortunately, the plastic pang is short-lived.) Tis very thick to drink, and the carbonation that I was expecting (given the head and bubbles) somehow hardly exists at all. While this is no favorite of mine, I can see myself pulling one out of the fridge once in a blue moon just for the camp-factor."
"Compared to normal bottled pale ales, this is very drinkable. There's not a lot of new flavors to consider, but it's a pleasure to pour, admire, and consume. This couldn't be the focus of a beer drinking session, but as something to drink casually while chatting with friends in the pub, it's ideal."
"One can criticism the nitro system, but it sure produces a good looking beer: clear copper under a one finger white head of very thick cream that lasts forever. Oddly, the lacing is a bit thin. There is remarkably little nose - basically none. The mouth is heavy and sticky, with mild carbonation. The taste is neither grainy nor sweet, with tinny hops emerging quite early, accompanied by a touch of grassiness. The finish is more metallic than bitter, whith shisps of sweetness (grape?) mixed in. Nice lip-smacking aftertaste invites another swig. It will do."
"Very drinkable, smooth, refreshing. Should go well with just about any kind of food or just by itself."
"The taste is very mild and well balanced. Nothing jumps out from this beer as a dominating flavor; a standard amber ale. The creamy head and malty body give this beer a good mouth feel for those who enjoy a beer with body. The thickness of the beer does limit its drinkability to one or two in a night."
"Cheers"
"Appearance is a cloudy golden color, with great foam and lacing. Aroma is crisp with sweet flowers and banana. Initial taste is a smoot experience that is like a good latte. Medium body and a sweet roasted coffee malt flavor predominates and overcome the flowery yet bitter hops. Adry finish that ends in astringent tannins and barley. So so."
"Unfortunately, like Newcastle Brown Ale, it suffers from a watery soda-like flavor and body, lightened presumably for mass-market consumption. The creamy character is somewhat special, but it needs more of everything to become a real ale."
"Like the look of this can. It is black and yellow with a simple brewing barrel as the label. I just love the name as well it it oozes english beer tradition. this one pours from a can at 44ml @4.7%. Overall taste quality. This is a fantastic beer. The taste is well rounded on the palate and the taste is well balanced. There is a subtle hint of honey which works exceedingly well. If I could afford to drink this beer in vast quantities I would. I suspect the more of this beer i drink the more I would love it."
"Edit 11/21: Only six months later and this one is not nearly what I once thought it was. The nitro leaves a nice impression but the beer is at best unimpressive. Very watery body and no outstanding flavors...not poor but not good."
"Update: ever since the closing of strangeways, this beer has lost what made it great. Still a good session beer, but nothing special among similars."
"Now that I've had this ale a few times, from the can, not much of a rating difference. I've had a chance to whiff the aroma, and upped the rating a half point, but everything else is still the same. Compared to the on-tap review I did. This ale is very good. Beyond drinkable in my opinion at this time."
"I would not reccomend it from the nitro can unless you just like watching reverse cascades ;>)"
"A really nice brew. Poured out to a clear medium dark golden color with a respectable head. Medium carbonation. Traces of lace were slightly present. Aroma of hops and sweetness. Taste was suprisingly smooth and inviting. Flavors of hops and grain were present, as was a buttery smooth mouthfeel that really got my attention. Finished crisp and quite refreshing. This could be a session beer. In fact, on more than one occasion, for me and my buddies, it has been. Recommended."
"Goes down smooth as silk making you want to drink more and more. A very drinkable lighter beer to give yourself a break in a long session."
"The beer looked great. The formation and retention of the head was nice to look at. Unfortunately the liquid was seriously devoid of any recognizable flavor. No hops, no malt, not even a bad flavor, just very,very bland. I have never been a big fan of nitro cans. These were a freebie from a friend so I am not out anything. I am going to try the other two 16oz cans later, if the taste changes I will revise my review. If not I will just look forward to trying something new!"
"Pours a bright, deep golden hue with a creamy, stark white half-inch head that has some staying power. Aroma of light, sweet malt, honey, a touch of hops, and a whiff of something slightly sour that suggests the use of a bit of adjunct malt. Palate is well balanced between sweet malt and mild English hops, with a subtle honey background and a lightly bitter finish. Beautifully creamy mouthfeel as a result of the nitro cartridge in the can. A great session beer, whether in the can or on draught."
"Well, its not fantastically remarkable but it does have two worthwhile qualities: for one, it doesnt really have too much of that nitro-funk that you get with most beers that come in nitro-cans, but you still get that great, creamy head-retention (thanks to the nitro-can). Secondly, its REALLY drinkable, would make a great session beer. So, its worth a try."
"This is like a can full of nitrogen and chemcials. Barely even resembles a beer. I hear this stuff used to be really good, too. What a shame."
"i dont think i like the mouthfeel too much but i does go good with the beer. on draft i say its good, when i get in in cans i'll re-rate it."
"Pours a light, clear, amber color with a beautiful head. The head is creamy and looks like whipped egg whites. Nice and fluffy. I'd comment on the aroma but it is practically non-existant. Maybe a faint malt aroma. The taste is very light and smooth. Mild maltiness with hardly any hop bitterness at all. The mouthfeel is very good. Creamy, but the carbonation seems light. I think it is a good drinkable beer although it really isn't very complex and is kind of bland. It isn't a beer you would want to drink if you've just had a beer with explosive flavor."
"Pouring from the nitro can causes a beautiful, creamy head on top this clear amber liquid. Foam lasts the whole glass and with a deep swallow leaves a mustache of creamy bubbles. Not a lot of aroma, maybe a bit of malt, but any smell tends to get killed by the nitro. No strong flavors (good or bad), pretty average taste all around. Thick and creamy mouthfeel, goes down smooth."
"Taste: it's there, lightly fruity, touch of hops, a touch sour (?, but altogether smooth. Slim body, neglible finish, this ale quits the mouth with a quickness. I understand the appeal of pub ales, but it just doesn't apply in my case. Generally, I like ales with bigger flavor than this, but you can't knock it's popularity, and it delivers to those who subscribe. Not for me, though."
"On-tap at Fiddlers Green in Orlando. Awesome!! Perfect cascading in a clear, amber yellow with a tan head that laced the pint glass all the way down. Lite aromas of malt and citrus that matched the creamy smooth taste, a lemon was in the background. Thin, of course, cream ale that you could drink all night, easily. Nice lite hoppy finish."
"Overall this is just an average beer. It's good for when you want something light to quench your thirst. The best thing about it by far is its appearance."
"While I wouldn't say it's well-rounded, it's certainly pleasant enough. For me, it just doesn't declare itself enough."
"Looks great but has really no taste to it."
"Overall, a decent brew. I would recommend this possibly as a crossover beer."
"Pours with that wonderful ""waterfall"" effect (a la Guinness). A 2"" tall, creamy,fluffy, almost edible off-white head forms. The brew is a nice golden color. Smell is light, with hops, amlt and just a slight hint of spice. Taste is hops, a little spice, and some malt. Not much in the way of complexity here. A smooth drinking beer with light effervescence and not much aftertaste. Overall, considering it came from a can, a pretty good beer, but doesn't hold up like, say, Young's Double Chocolate stout. Get this on tap, it is much better there."
"I can see this being a good session, with the low carbonation and mild flavour. Overall, the flavour and aroma feel a little muted. 440 mL can."
"More beers should be carbonated with nitrogen. It gives the beer such a full-bodied, satisfying feel. It poured with a thick, thick creamy head and on top there is a darker thicker head on top of an off-head that disappears as the beer settles. The aroma does not stand out as anything original or complicated, just simple hops and sweet maltsbut strangely pleasing. The mouthfeel is fairly heavy for an ale, but if served cold enough, is nicely crisp and satisfying. This is a favorite beer of mine and I find it incredibly drinkable."
"Pours a clear golden color with a consistent off-white, creamy nitrogenated head. White bready malt aroma with a touch of clover honey and faint hopping. Predominant taste is iron-laden Manchester water with a light toasty malt profile, diacetyl, and a faint hop bitterness. I'm not really sure why people swear by this beer, it must be a process of socialization. Just as bland and unsatisfying as it is on nitro-draught except with a further metallic, minerally taste. Creamy mouthfeel, but that's nothing new with a nitro can; that's about all it has going for it. I've been told from one Englishman, ""It's the best thing to come from Manchester"". Obviously, that bloke doesn't care for football, the Stone Roses, Oasis, Happy Mondays, New Order, the Smiths or the Charlatans UK. I'm wondering whether he was faking an accent... Nah, just pride, gotta defend the hometown."
"The draught can leaves you with a thick, tan head and lots of lacing on the glass. The beer is an amber color with a good amount of bubbles visible in the glass. The smell is very sweet with strong suggestions of caramel. Hops are not very aromatic and seem to be hard to detect in the nose. The taste is very mild, with caramel coming through here as well. The mouthfeel is a bit thin. Drinkablility is great...would make a nice session."
"Since production was taken over by InBev/InterBrew/whatever they call themselves now and has been moved to Luton, I no longer find Boddingtons as enjoyable. The cream has been robbed from Manchester and has suffered greatly. Luton brewed Boddingtons has lost its creaminess and now has a harsh ""aluminum can"" edge to it, Formerly drinkable, this is now just unbearable. My review, however, is based upon Manchester brewed Boddingtons and shall thus not be altered."
"Comments - Although not particularly exciting, this beer would probably be a good session beer. Call me crazy, but there is something refreshing about occasionally drinking a beer that is simple and smooth without an American ""adjunct"" flavor to it."
"A good clean bright yellow beer. Has a big spoonable creamy white head and leaves lace effect. There was a light sweet grassy aroma with a hint of lemon to it. The flavor was light and had a little sweetness with that same hint of lemon just before the quick hop bitterness on the finish."
"Boddingtons. I just don't get it."
"Pours a nice light amber with a frothy white, nitro head. It smells really sweet... like caramel.The flavor is equally sweet with a very bitter, metallic aftertaste that is not too pleasant, but is by no means repulsive. The body is very thin and watery overall...not the best EPA, but definitely not the worst."
" Drinkability is ok not something I would buy normally but the boss at work mentioned he enjoyed it and I hadn't tried it so here we are. Would by in a restaurant or pub with limited options but not something to keep around."
"I can't believe that I have not reviewed this beer yet. It poured from the can a slightly golden yellow color with a finger and a half of thick creamy head. The nose was slightly creamy, caramely, with some fruity esters as well. The flavor had good caramel sweetness and a creamy flavor with some strawberry-like fruity esters finishing slightly hoppy. The feel was velvety smooth, creamy and thick. I do enjoy this beer. I find this to be highly drinkable and enjoyable. Its a nice beer to fall back on."
"This is my first nitro-can expirience. Boddingtons Pub Ale is light copper in color with a super-creamy nitro induced head. The head never disappates and leaves thick lacings around the inside of my glass. The aroma is very light. Smell is fairly similar to American macros, just a little more clean. The taste is very bland, no real malt or hop character. Also this is a little too dry, especially since there isn't enough flavor to go around. The mouthfeel is creamy which adds some drinkability. This isn't something I'll pick up again and I wasn't impressed with the nitro can."
"Great head, perfectly milky and dense like snow. Lasting, on a pale yellow color body. The smell is quite pleasing, although I have a bit of a cold and can't really describe it adequately. Still, not bad, quite fruity and sweet. The taste is nothing amazing, but it's a nice beer to sip on. The hoppiness gets a bit oily but it isn't annoying. A bit dry in the end. The maltiness is round but not very expressive. Maybe some wooden notes. Mouthfeel is soft, smooth and creamy, decent. Overall not a bad beer."
"No aroma, yellow appearance with such foam, not much taste, just a slight bitterness. Some creaminess, probably owing to gas tap. Passable drink at seasonal party. Bit of sweetness and grassiness. Moderately dry aftertaste. Medium but still watery mouthfeel."
"Bottom line - don't give up on this beer if you only try it in the nitro cans. The tap version is like a whole different beer, and you are likely to enjoy it much more, if you like this style of beer."
"Beerookie below does amuch better job of describing the appearnce of a Boddington's Pub Ale poured out of a Nitro can, especially the effects of the widget for the twofold foaming. Good carbonation and lacing as well. No bitterness at all, almost too creamy and mild. This makes it an exceptionally easy pint to drink. Wouldn't mind a bit more hoppiness but no problems overall here."
"From the can this beer poured a golden honey color. It produced a about a finger thick lasting head. There was no other evidence of carbonation. The smell was good and malty. The taste had a honey character. It was slightly bitter from the hops, but not too strong. This ale was nice and smooth and light in the mouth, maybe a bit too light...A good ale, not the best I've had, but I sure wouldn't mind downing a few of these!"
"Not a bad beer, but not ourstanding either, guess I should resample to get the true measure of it."
"Beautiful appearance, pale hazy gold color with a thick creamy head that left my glass sheathed in a thick coating of creamy lace. Head lasted till the last sip. The smell was very faint floral hops but mostly a doughy yeasty smell, not bad at all. Very mild taste, no high or low points, just no real substance in any category. It was good to try again, will keep some around next summer as a good quencher."
"A champion beer in every sense of the word. I am surprised at the low ratings for this. It has a wonderful appearance (and I am not a big amber guy) and a perfect head. The taste is toasty and comforting. Probably the best of the more ""popular"" beers."
"poured a orange copper color with a nice size white head that left some lacing. aroma, malts, caramel, some fruits. flavor not much of anything did get hints of toffee and some bitterness. a little to light on the mouth feel for me.I am just glad I didn't buy this somebody gave a can of this to try."
"Drinkability: This is a hard beer to categorize here. People have mixed reviews on this..some love it, some hate it...and some are like me. I think it's an interesting and unique beer, but I really can't see myself drinking this very often. Maybe above average drinkability due to the creamy, smooth mouthfeel and light body. I recommend people to at least try it, and I'd love to try it on-tap if I ever got the opportunity."
"Consumed in October 2004 at The Prince of Wales Pub in San Mateo, CA. Spilled about an ounce of it all over the counter after I ""thought"" I opened it slow enough. Pour was beautiful as most nitro cans do. A huge creamy head the slowly faded but still had a bit left at the end of the glass. Didn't smell much. Maybe a bit like Guinness. Some roasted malts. Not a real strong scent. A bit more carbonation than expected. Tastes of malt, maybe a hop or two and maybe a very very slight fruit taste (lemon?). Still went down very nicely. Kind of an odd taste. A hard to describe taste. Not bad, but just strange. Decent enough brew though."
"A very easy drinking beer."
"Pours out golden colored with a nice, creamy head. Great lacing on the glass as it goes down. Not a huge aroma here at all. Could barely detect anything. Very creamy mouthfeel that coats the palate nicely. A drinkable beer, but not many exciting or interesting characteristics about it."
"ng"
"Pours hazy amber with nice frothy head. Smells skunky with alcohol and malt. Tastes rather bitter with a lot of alcohol. Mouthfeel was smooth, surprisingly compared to the taste. Although I didn't enjoy this beer much at all, I do suppose it was a decent example of the type."
"This seems to be a very unique beer. I liked it but I wouldn't search it out."
"this beer has a kick. Nice flavor and for what it is it is smooth. the plastic thingy inside is interesting, similar to the guiness tap in bottle. i dont know if it reallt enhances the flavor a lot or if it has a psycological affect more than a real effect. but in any event, it doesent taste bad at all."
"The last 4 times I've had Boddington's it was terrible. I've lowered my scores accordingly. It will be a while before I try again."
"An interesting experience, but when I finished, I did not want another! Try it once for the show!"
"I've had good nitro pub ales and I've had bad nitro pub ales. Count Boddingtons Pub Ale as one of the latter. Thumbs down."
"Smooth mouthfeel, average drinkabilty, I could have it again but I'd rather a Beamish please!"
"It poured with lots of bubbles forming a light gold cascade the finished in a fairly clear light gold with a decent white head. The smell was pretty well straight up malt. The taste was a nice combination of sweet and bitter. It started out with a blast of sweet creamy beer and finished with a bit of a hoppy edge. It was medium and creamy a real pleasure in the mouth. Definately a possible decision, but not a primary."
"I tried this beer yesterday (8/21/04) in some taste tournaments of the various beers that were available on tap at a downtown Boston pub. The others we compared and tested (there were 3 of us) were Pilsner Urquel, Harpoon IPA, Smithwicks, Sam Adams blue label, Sam Adams Summer Ale, and Bass. I really thought this was the worst beer of all. Each other beer had something going for it except this one. My friends felt the same way. Bitter and a woody finish but woody in a dirty piece of wood way. Nothing to like about the mouthfeel or drinkability either."
"Overall: A very subpar English pale ale. Little body and flavor make for a flat, boring, uninspiring beer. Skip this one at all costs."
"A nice mild bitter, or is this a hoppy mild? Either way it is a very pleasant beer to have."
"Sampled this common brew on tap (nitro). As expected it arrived with a huge super creamy head which dissolved into a smaller creamy head. This brew is all about the mouthfeel. velvet in a glass. Malty nose, sweet malt center. Notes of honey, vanilla, flowers. tasty stuff. Mildly hoppped. Super pleasant summer quaffer."
"overall, not bad, but just lacking a bit on flavor."
"There are oodles of bitters that I prefer. I like it to a small degree for its visuals and availability at those same places where Guinness is considered exotic."
"This was a very clean and drinkable beer. I think it would go well with steak, or just with friends."
"This is one beautiful beer. While yellow in color, the head is very impressive. The smell is almost nonexistant however, as this beer proves to be very mellow. What the beer lacks malty and hoppy goodness, it makes up in creaminess. There is not a lot of flavor, and the beer goes down quickly and seems light. This is a beer that is nice for very occasional drinking, but it certainly does have its place in the world of beer."
"just as everyone else had said, the nitro can is a hassle, the beer tends to go everywhere. poured a goldish/reddish color with a wonderful cascading effect. a white frothy head that stays the same all the way to the bottom of the glass. Not much of a smell to speak of honestly. Had a rather sweet taste to it that becomes more prevalent as the glass warmed up. not a very strong taste. a very mellow beer, that never had a bite to it. mouthfeel was well... creamy. a smooth beer that went down nicely. However, the after taste was like i was eating the can. every time i finished a swallow thats all i got. Could be a very nice beer if it weren't for that. i would like to try it on tap sometime. a good beer but probably not something id keep my fridge stocked with."
"The best thing about this beer is that, like Guiness, This can easily be consumed in more than mass quantities. Unfortunately for $5 a pop, my pocketbook tells me otherwise."
"my local store had 4 pint packs for 7 dollers, so i figured i'd give this a whirl, and first off, i had to change my shirt after opening it *thank you nitro can ;)* Now pouring it into a pint glass, wow, perfect ale color, nice creamy head, took a long bit to settle, and a pleasant, yet slightly skunky smell to it. however the taste was anything but. it tasted sort of like an average run of the mill ale, but the mouthfeel was what set this beer apart. it was quite creamy, and in fact reminded me of a ale form of murphy's stout. all in all, this was a very drinkable beer. now excuse me, i still have half a pint to finish with lunch :)"
"the pour was a clean, headless bright straw with just some bubbles floating up irregularly. served cold as well. The smell, quite bitter as I've seen in the english, is also a bit sour at the nose. The taste isn't all that good but passes my test. it is not abundant in its bitterness, which i liked, but really is moderate in every sense. It's an alright company for the euro2004 at the pub."
"Seriously, I could drink this stuff all night long."
"Im on the fence about this one, generally not my ideal of something Id enjoy, but I could see myself having a craving for this if I wanted something soft, light, and INSANELY quaffable."
"Golden with very light carbination. Pours with that lovely Guinness like nitro pour that you just have to admire the glass. Thick ring of head that was about 1/8 inch when it sat there. Nitro tap so it comes out sooo nice and creamy and smooth tasting.... yum. Very balanced in flavor. Great bitterness, but not overly done. Hoppy, yet not too much. It is just such a great drinking beer. One you know you are safe with anywhere and anytime of the year."
"Overall not a bad brew but there are many better ones out there."
"I just hate these nitro cans. The only beer that I have tasted that is better/good in the nitro can is youngs dc stout. Enough of my rant i just had to get that off my chest. The pour is nice with a golden hue and a creamy head that settles about an inch thick. I seriously can't smell anything, the creamy head is blocking my sniffing abilities. The taste is also nothing. The nitro can has a way of blocking the actual taste of the beer. The creamy head is sticking to my mouth blocking all other tastes. Maybe a slight dextrin sweet taste at the back of my mouth. This beer also seems flat in my mouth, i dont get any carbonation when tasting it (i have no idea why this is). This is essentially brown water."
"Everything about this beer is soft. No. Not soft. Whimpy. Utterly limp. This is a beer that can't be bothered  so neither can I. I pass."
"poured out thick and hearty with that fat nitro head. loods pretty good. the aroma is faint, very light hops and a somewhat boring ""beer smell"". in the mouth it is creamy and smooth, the head is frothy and it goes down easily. flavor wise it is weak, not terribly so, but pretty blah. faint malt here, very light hops there and all with an odd/off metallic taste. not bad but not good either. it is drinkable though, if there isnt anything better around."
"Nice deep darker yellow with thick creamy off-white head. Mildly sweet-malty aroma curbed by some neutral hops. Malty and creamy and rounded with some noble hops. Starts with medium body and finishes a bit fuller. I enjoy these as an easy drinking beer, primarily when there is nothing else ""hoppy"" available."
"The nitro can results in an attractive ""active"" pour as there is a nice cascade of bubbles. Once all the action has died down, a very light golden beer is left with the standard sharp white ""collar"" of a nitro beer. A very mild, grassy aroma comes forth. Creamy, mild taste with a virtually non-existent finish, and an almost absence of hops. Not terrible tasting, but it certainly lacks most of the flavors present in the beers I really like. Very smooth and creamy (mostly from the nitro can) and as a result its easy to drink one of these. Overall, rather unimpressive, not a bad beer, but certainly far from spectacular, and one I'm unlikely to try again."
"thick, just like guinness. It also had just a tiny bit of carbonation just like guinness. I think of it as a light guinness. It's not quite as thick and pours a hazy golden color with a white head. It definitely had some bitterness to it. Just so similar to guinness I have nothing else to compare it too."
"Hey, it's a gorgeous beer. I wish it tasted as good as it looks, very drinkable nevertheless."
"Wow, this beer really looks like it was poured from a bar tap...great body. Boddingtons is so unique for being a light-looking golden beer that pours like an Irish stout; those widget things work well. Moving past the appearence, this is a very mild tasting brew. Not much smell to speak of, but while swallowing it feels like a Beamish or Murphys thanks once again to the nitrogen blast. Slightly sweet, this a good smooth drinking session brew that pairs great with spicey food."
"Sampled 12/30/03"
"What a beautiful pour. Golden orange on the bottom, carbination bubbling up to the $5 milk shake head (""I dont know if it was worth $5, but it was f'ing good""). Head kept its thickness and presence for a week and a half. Thick, rich full taste that doesn't overstay its welcome. Weak smell of hops and smooth creamy flow over the lips and past the gums. An old favorite, I've often heard of it as ""Guinness Lite"" and ""White Guinness"". This is extremely easy to drink, suitable for marathon nights of putting back the wet stuff or just enjoying with dinner. Not a bad run of the mill brew."
"Nitro can  Poured a golden brew with a nice creamy white head. Aroma is sweet with some malts coming through. Taste is very light but similar to Kilkenney or Guiness in a nitro can. This is not a bad beer just a good session beer. Probably wont try that again since there is a lot more interesting session beer out there."
"If only it tasted and smelled as good as it looks, or even as good as it feels in the mouth, it would be more well-rounded. As it is, it's all over the board, with the assets lessened by the almost-liabilities. I enjoyed it overall, but it's just so inconsistent in its various components. One has to love that creamy mouthfeel, but it doesn't overcome the thin aroma and flavor. It is indeed drinkable, because the basic consituents and mild ABV lend themselves to easy consumption. But I just can't get past the ups and downs to justify drinking this over something I know I'd enjoy more, or at least something new I want to try. Oh well, so it goes."
"They have some canoes in Britain too, apparently."
"Not a particularly flavorful brew, but I could definitely drink several of these. Worth a try."
"Light bodied and smooth, a mild session beer, seemed even lower in ABV than 4.7. Nothing too special, but a quality beer."
"Taste is a bit thin but creamy. A nice hoppy finish as it warms. But overall pretty plain. Very drinkable and smooth but nothing special."
"A decent beer overall, but that look was just too much to live up to."
"Dense golden/copper color body with a rich and creamy looking head. Light malt aroma with bready notes. A very mellow tasting brew with a sweet malty taste throughout and just enough bitterness in the end. Bready/biscuity aftertaste. Though this beer is light tasting, the mouthfeel is creamy and thick and has a low carbonation. This pairing of a light taste with a heavy mouthfeel adds to the beers complexity and makes it very enjoyable. Also surprisingly refreshing despite the thick and creamy mouthfeel. You can really pound these either on a hot summer day or during a cold night at the pub. A great session beer anytime."
"The King recommends drinking this beer with a double chocolate fudge brownie"
"Very drinkable if you want some thing light."
"when i first asked about this drink a lady patron said ""it's like a beer milkshake"". i was highly confused with this remark until i drank it. it really is like a beer flavored milk-shake. hard to explain but definetly worth a shot."
"After having this on tap and enjoying it, I picked up a 4-pack of the nitro cans. Not the same at all. Tasted like a run-of-the mill pale ale that was creamier. Stick to this on tap."
"This ale pours a pale golden yellow with a frothy white head that reminds me of a cafe frappe with milk that I've had in Greece. There isn't too much presence of anything in the aroma, slight floral hop, but no malt. The taste however is an interesting mix of fruitiness and vanilla, with a good balance of slight sweetness and bitterness. I'm partial to the nitrogenated beers, and this one is no exception, as it makes the beer velvety-smooth. It's a fairly average alcohol content that you can't taste or feel, yielding a very high drinkability."
"Drinkability  I enjoyed this one, although Ive never had the opportunity to knock back a few Pale Ales in England proper. Maybe it doesnt compare  but for the time being and keeping this one on my list of buy again."
"Tastes weakly malty/hoppy with no real character. Thin in body and mouthfeel, low in alcohol. Guess it makes for something you can drink all night with your friends."
"Drinkability is very good, but why would you want to? I found no qualities in this beer that aren't better executed elsewhere."
"My favorite ale. Served from a can, this beer poured an extremely thick, creamy head that dissipated quickly. The color was a lightish yellow. Smelled rich and creamy. This was the first time I had experienced such a sweet dairy-like smell. Could have sworn there was milk in it. Tasted incredibly sweet and creamy, but felt a little harsh in the mouth for some reason, however this harshness was countered by the incredible taste. Easy to drink since the flavor was so incredible!"
"I didn't take points off for appearance, even though I was tempted to when the contents of my can proceded to explode all over me upon opening it (and the same thing happened to my brother as well). Seeing as how these weren't even shook up, I would advise opening these in the sink. As for the beer, it is quite average in all respects and it doesn't pull any punches. Tetley's is in a similar vein to this beer but I found that one to be a bit more enjoyable than this."
"Can opens extremely violently, every one opens with beer spraying. Pours with a huge thick, creamy head that hangs around, and leaves residue on your upper lip. I have heard that the US version can't compare to the UK version, which I hope is right. The head is delcious. The rest of the beer isn't very interesting. Malt and cereal grains, with nothing that special. I wouldn't get this again."
"The mouthfeel is quite thin and light, and the carbonation is nonexistant. It's not so great. However, it's light and inoffensive, so it's fairly drinkable."
"a fairly boring brew here. it has the standard nitro tap look...awesome cascading effect which leaves a nice creamy head on top of a creamy golden body. the head of course lasts and lasts throughout the brew. in terms of smell an taste, i was hard pressed to come up with something definitive. there was a bit of floral sweetness in the smell, less so in the taste, which was watery overall with a slight bitterness, but certainly not as watery as a macro. this is a very smooth, very creamy brew that's easy to drink, and even though it's a 'different' choice while being fairly easy to find on tap, i'd prefer another commonly tapped brew, such as a sam adams or SNPA just about any time over this one."
"Nice to look at, I guess, pours a very see-through gold color with the nitro-head. Smooth mouthfeel due to the nitro and no real carbonation, which works for guiness because of the richness of the brew, but here just points out the places where this one truly lacks. Slightly sweet flavor, very little hops, in the nose or on the palate. The after-feel in the mouth is slightly chalky, like drinking dust. Tastes like a flat, bad, near-macro. Not impressed."
"I had a bad pint of this at the Goose in Brixton. The lines were obviously not cared for at that establishment and you can tell as this murky beer with no head arrived. The aroma was sour and bad, as was the taste. The mouthfeel was still creamy, but that did not save the drinkability at all on this one!"
"its a shame that this is one of the most readily available english ales available over here, because there are just so many better. but then a suppose for the beer drinking appreciation levels of most aussies, im almost certain theyd think this was one of the most tasty and complex beers theyd ever tried. i suppose in the end it shows how good english brewers are. even their dud beers are drinkable."
"Poured a golden yellow with its traditional very dense and creamy white head. A lot of lace - solid in places. Not much of a nose - a mild malt at best. Very thin mouthfeel and, really, not much aftertaste which I seek in my beer - some hops - but not flavourful enough for me. Its OK. If you bought it as your round I would be happy to drink it! Interbrew calls this a session beer which should explain it in a nutshell. As an aside: Interbrew lists this as 3.8 abv and my Canadian import says 4.7% abv."
"Drinkability: Well.. this is one sorry ass replacement for Caffrey's. Curse you to hell, Coors! Still, this swill can be slammed home with ease. Stick with Guinness, you at least give off the appearance of looking manly."
"I guess this is supposed to be an example of an English session beer, but it doesn't really rock my American palate. The widget-type bubbler gave a good tall, cascading head (and this from a can that sat in my fridge for two years) that stayed with the beer and left a nice lace on the sides. Could not detect much aroma, which is better than smelling skunky, I guess. English pub style watery mouthfeel was uninspiring, and I couldn't pick up much taste, just a little residual sweetness. Nothing lingers much after the swallow. Nothing terrible, just not great."
"Call me silly, but I've always liked this beer, especially from the tap. Pours a crystal clear gold color, the head large, creamy, bright white and the lace a fine sealing sheet upon the glass. Nose fresh and clean, mostly malt and somewhat sweet, just like the start, top skinny in feel. Finish is lightly hopped, dry and a fine ""Session"" beer in my humble opinion."
"In my effort to learn about English beer I decided to try Boddingtons. This beer pours a golden color with cascading and ending in a thick white head that has staying power. The hop and malt smells are present but they are very slight. This beer is classic to the style being extremely easy to drink and light and having a creamy mouthfeel. It could be considered mellow and maybe even a little watery. I could drink a couple of these in a sitting but this is a beer that you would have to start with. It would not be good to have after a in your face beer because it would be hard to appreciate its subtle tastes."
"Still, if you offer me one I will not turn it down. After the initial excitement, it's a mellow ale best suited for a mellow drinking session."
"This poured a rich golden color with spiraling lines of carbonation bubbles going up the sides of the glass. Head retains at about 1/4 inch for the entire length, and displayed a cascading effect while it was settling. The smell had some hoppiness, but mostly a light, mead-like crispness to it, with lemony citrus and grass. Taste was nice and smooth, very light with a hoppy crispness at the finish. Mouthfeel was also smooth, very creamy from the nitro. I was satisfied at the end."
"Definitely a smooth drinkin' ale that you can down two at a time. Simple, yet effective. I wish this was available without the nitro, I think it hurts the flavor, with that deadening nitro pour."
"Bought this can for a buck. Not bad a deal for a not bad a brew. Poured a frothy head upon an amber pond. Surely the nitro widget now banging around in the empty can effected the appearance immensely. Too bad it doesn't improve taste and smell. This was a very metallic brew. Is their no protective lining in the can? Or is this intentional? Some floral hops and odd smelling malt comes through the steel factory aroma. Taste. Hmm, not bad. If I was the tinman. Again, very metallic taste. But it's cold. After a while to warm, some bitterness comes through, so as not too disappoint. Creamy mouthfeel. Almost like an Irish creme. Though the taste is bad, the mouthfeel is good, allowing for a drinkable brew."
"Had this at the local pub. Pours a yellow color with a surprisingly thick white head that sticks around. Loved the head on this one. The aroma is a little bread-like, but there's really not much aroma here. The flavor is very smooth and a little malty. There is a little sweetness and a little hops to keep things fun, but the drinkability of this beer is amazing. It is a little bitter, but just a little. Great beer."
"While not overwhelming in the taste department, I really enjoy this beer."
"This is a weird looking beer and nitro cans should be reserved for stouts was my opinion after drinking it. First off the beer shot out of the can apon breaking the cans seal so make sure you have a glass within a seconds reaching after cracking the seal. Back to why pale beers shouldnt be nitrogen induced was the appearance it looked like really weird whipped egg whites on top of a flat looking yellowish beer. Smells like bread dough not bad but not good either. Tasted decent but would do much better if it actually had some body to it with no carbonation it just tasted like flat beer with almost no flavor and became a task to finish. This beer would be much better having been bottle conditioned, force carbonated in the bottle or have been served from a tap that is non-nitrogen."
"One of my favourite ""widget can"" brews from the U.K.. The appearance is a bit weak. The first word that comes to mind is ""thin"". The quality of the brew, however, is quite different. I really enjoy the head off of a fresh poured Boddingtons. I small glass of Boddingtons' foam would be great! The smell is quite mild mannered, but pleasant, a wee bit ""yeasty"" or bready. The taste itself is quite mild, too. It isn't near thirst quenching, like some brews I've had, but it is still quite good indeed. It has a nice ""mouthfeel", also. The drinkability of Boddingtons is quite good, too. Overall, Boddingtons is a wonderful brew that smells good and is easy to drink with little aftertaste."
"is ok, nothing special, but no matter if I have one or three I get a hangover. Not sure why, but that is why I will not drink it anymore."
"If this is the only beer available, seek out water or a soft drink"
"Have had this many times either in the nitro can or nitro tap I had a few days ago at the Spring House Drafting Room.Pours a deep yellow with a very nice looking creamy head,not much smell to it somewhat metallic and a little biscuit malt but not much.The flavor is pretty bland and dry with some slight maltiness.It does not taste as good as it looks for sure."
"Sadly, there is just not alot happening with this ale. Mild is the key word."
"Drinkability: not bad, just not great. I can think of any number of other beers in this style I'd rather drink. All in all, a pretty average brew."
"Its possible this beer was meant to compliment the nitro pour system. Though its a fairly standard British Pale, it has a wonderful mouth-feel and drinkability due to its rich creamy body and clean taste. The attractive pour in an imperial pint, it sets a nice mood. Though the aroma is quite weak, possibly due to the thick foam, its still nice for the style. The taste is fairly standard, a creamy and malty taste with little hop presence. It certainly compliments fish & chips well, and it is entirely too drinkable."
"Overall this beer is very drinkable and i would enjoy this one as a session beer or as a thirst quencher, one at a time."
"Darker gold color. Large creamy head. Aroma is malty and sweet. A medium bodied English ale, mild taste, some hop bitterness. Full flavor, full body. Mouthfeel is creamy, full and round. Some malt sweetness. Finish is smooth. Aftertaste is very slightly bitter."
"Cloudy orange in color with a very thick head. Lots of lacing on the glass. Aroma ( what their was of it) was slightly malty, but nothing to rave about. Taste was not too impressive ether. Rather bland and unimpressive. Mouthfeel was creamy, and this was the the flavor. i would rather drink water than have another one of these so I'll pass on this one in the future."
"All in all, a decent ale that feels wonderful going down."
"I was pleasantly suprised by this. I knew the pour would be impressive after reading the reviews, but many seemed unimpressed with the taste. While I agree that it is a relatively mild tasting beer, that is more than made up for by the creamy mouthfeel and refreshing nature of this beer.Goes down so nicely, and there is nothing wrong with the taste. Even in the can, this blows away the ""big three"" on tap. If it's that much better in England, I would love to try it. I will be buying more of this (today!). Re-review - It's amazing how your opinion can change. As you can see, I really enjoyed this the first time. Must've been the hot day, drinking it outside? Tonight, it was so watery and bland that I poured it down the drain after two sips. Amazing. Maybe I'll like it more next time (if there ever is a next time!)."
"The beer pours a pale golden color with a beautiful frothy white head. A perfect appearance! The nose is fruity. Their are smells of pale malts and yeast. The taste is very plain and dull. There is no complexity here. The mouthfeel is nice; not to carbonated. It is a light bodied ale. The drinkability is rough. The mouthfeel is right, but the head is too thick and the taste just isn't that good. This is not a favorite of mine."
"Cloudy orange in color with a very thick head. Lots of lacing on the glass. Aroma was slightly malty, but nothing to rave about. Taste was not too earth-shattering as well. Rather bland and unimpressive. Mouthfeel was creamy, and I think this covered up some of the flavor. Not really reaching for the glass for another pull with this one. I'll pass on this one in the future."
"This brew poured a long lasting creamy large white head of fine to medium sized bubbles. It has a light transparent golden brown body. It also has a mild malty/ hoppy aroma. It had a smooth full bodied hoppy taste with no bit and a slight tartness in its finish. There was nothing special about this brew, but it was just nice none-the-less."
"This is a mild, creamy ale through and through, nothing exceptional, yet nothing that makes it anything that bad either, no off flavours or rank smells. Pours a pleasing clear honey amber hue, creamy thick white head from the nitro can, and the head lasts the whole glass. Aroma is of muted malt, and so is the flavour. No discernable hops at all. Creamy mouthfeel and it goes down very smoothly. Would make a decent session beer in a pinch, it's easy enough to drink up, but I prefer something with a lot more flavour to offer. A lot more flavour."
"All in all, this is a good, refreshing beer. I would have no problem drinking it at a pub, especially if it is on tap."
"The widget makes the presentation very nice. I love to watch a beer with nitro settle out, and this one leaves a very nice, thick head on top that stays there, and the beer is crystal clear. Its downhill from there though. I smelled it...kinda fruity, a little sweet. I battled through the head to take the first drink, and there's frankly not much to taste. Its quite bland. Mouthfeel is nice..feels thick, but yet there is no malty thickness in the taste. Some bittering is present, so I know its not completely hop-free, but its pretty close. Its not a bad beer at all...its just boring."
"Had to try this is a little pub in Pennsylvania. Nitrous head, thick and creamy - that was nice. Smelled floral and wheaty too, and had a nice color. Tasted like water. I kid you not. Just nothing there. No aftertaste either. Was really a suprise, most of these nitrous bitters are kinda strong ... oh well. I wouldn't order it again."
"I decided to try Boddingtons based sheerly on the amount we generally sell in a week at work. Nitro can fizzes and the ale pours a frothy honey/gold color. Looks pretty nice, with a guinness-sized head that's just as thick looking. Smells of little malt, mostly a generic beer smell with some hops. Taste is unremarkable, creamy, but little flavor. Hardly any maltiness, but there is a decent hop finish. Very little to recommend in this beer, but it is quite drinkable. Probably won't buy again, due to the fact that there are many more tasty brews out there."
"I had this in a London Pub. The beer pours a just barely hazy golden color. As you would expect with a nitro beer, it has a thick, dense head of small bubbles. The head does linger awhile. The aroma is a little light, with some hops and malts coming through. Very smooth taste. It is somewhat sweet, with a lightly bitter finish."
"Cheers! Go United!"
"Pours a nice golder color with a thick creamy white head. Not carbonated at all, except for the initial cascade. It has a nice malt/hops balance with a bit more malt than hops. Definately not for a hophead. The drinkibility is so high because I could easily see myself in a pub in Manchester ordering pint after pint of these draughts and never really tiring of the taste. there isnt anything special at first sip, but it is just a good overall beer with mass comsumption in mind."
"Very drinkable, even after all this time. I'll buy this one again."
"Served a hazy bright amber in appearance with a creamy off-white head similar to Guinness. Aroma seemed pretty light. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Finish has a citrus-like quality to it with a mild bitterness. Nothing mind-blowing, but just a good, drinkable English pub ale."
"This beer poured a golden color. The head was creamy with a white top. The lacing was just so-so on the sides of my mug. It had a fruity aroma to it. It had a bitter taste and it also had a lingering aftertaste. There was nothing outstanding about this particular beer."
"Creamy thick white head and golden orange in color. Smooth, creamy mouthfeel. Fruit (grapefruit) and a slight biscuit aroma come across in the nose. Moderate bitterness on the side of the tongue with a grapefruit character. Smooth with pretty subdued flavors overall. The more I drank the more I percieved a biscuity, bready flavor. Quite easily downable as a session beer."
"This nitro-can tends to shoot to life once the tab is pulled. Meaning three of the four pack if not in or near a sink, tended to make a mess before the pour. Once you do pour, let the brew settle for a good 60 seconds-plus as the nitro cascades and a creamy white head is made to feel pillow soft on the lip. The beers gold color stands alone, I mean it just stands with little to no carbon activity. The beer looks like its flat. The taste or smell offer little malt or hop. The taste is grainy, grassy or strawlike. Mouthfeel is left dry. The body was abit watery as well. This brew is a sipping beer rather than one to grab for thirst. Just open it by a sink!"
"A nice looking beer. This guy was very smooth, creamy, and really easy to drink. My school's pub serves this on tap, and I really wish I'd gotten around to tasting it earlier. Easily a session beer. It would be nice if it had a bit more malt flavor, and some kind (ANY) kind of smell."
"An interesting beer to say the least. I commented to my friends that while Boddington's is not the most complex beer I've ever tasted it just may be the creamiest and for this I give it some respect. I got an awful pour by the bartender at my school bar, but my friends was done correctly and the results were a glorious, fluffy, light head that settled out of the nitro. Good for sessions and as a creamy treat."
"Well it looked real good in the glass with the creamy white head sitting on the enticing amber brew. But other than that this beer is nothing special. There is no great smell to grab your attention, maybe just a hint of malt and floral hops. The taste is creamy and smooth with just a hint of hops, but I wouldn't say it's very bitter at all. Overall this is a very smooth and creamy beer that has no spectacular taste. At the same time it's enjoyable enough and it's easy to put back a few. Not usually my first choice at my local pub, but I also would never complain is someone bought me one."
"This is the first beer that Ive tried out of a nitro can and Ill have to say that Im impressed. Initial pour is a hazy orange/golden color with a thick creamy white froth. Once the foam settles from the pour, the color is a clear gold topped off with a rich 1-inch head that retains itself through the entire duration. Aromas are malty and sweet. The taste is so mild that I had to ask myself, This is a Bitter? It was so smooth and easy to drink. I could definitely see myself drinking several of these in one setting."
"I've sampled both draught and nitro cans and quite frankly, not a great deal different. Initially, pale gold in color transforming to dull amber with a billowing, multi-layered head, which begins 3/4 of the way from the bottom of the glass and rapidly rises to create a creamy, frothy white head. Tea and light hop aroma gives way to a mild herbal malt then disappears. If looks are deceiving, the malt body is thinner than it looks. The Light to medium tea with a twist of lemon peel hops remains constant throughout the glass. A smooth and frothy, lick your lips sort of ale. You cant help gulping."
"Drinkably good, but was a little flat, I was suprised that out of the tap it wasn't much better than out the can."
"Prost!"
"I love this stuff right here. It pours a creamy brown color with an excellent head. Once the foam settle it is a nice evenly brown color. It smells delicious and tastes even better. The malts are rich and smooth and the hops are just the right amount of pale flavor. It is very smooth and drinks easy. Like I said, I love this stuff. I can't get enough."
"Decent enough pub ale that mimics the Guinness nitro approach. Nicely decorated can contains the zealous mix that will cause the cascading head even before the pour. Cloudy amber coloration and a voluminous head of white cream is the appearance. Ample lacing. Smooth light taste with significant bitterness and a slight metallic edge. A bit too light on body and watery sense though there is a light cream sense. Starts stronger than it finishes."
"Not a powerhouse by any means, but still a pleasant and highly drinkable brew. I sucked this pint down in no time. My rating is based totally on this beers own merits. If I were to look at it compared to other pales/bitters, it would not hold up at all."
"Hazy amber with a nice white head. Creamy smooth. A bit of a malty sweet with a lack luster bitter. The ending/aftertaste is slightly unpleasant. Better than American macros, but not a super beer by any means. Without the nitro I'm sure this would be just another crappy beer."
"This rating is certainly higher than I would afford this beer because of the awesome cascade that accompanies it. It reminded me of some sort of science experiment when I poured it. The beer was a pretty basic light copper ale color, but the cascade was this interesting yellow cloud that sank and then rose in my glass. The smell was overly metallic without much in the way of flavors. Taste was like guiness light, if it existed. Probably the major problem with nitro cans. It had a creamy mouthfeel which masked my preoccupation with the lack of taste. Ohk brew."
"Not one of my fav's, but not my least fav. It was a very light pale yellow color, with a short lived foamy white head. I thought it was quite carbonated, maybe just me though. Quite a bitter taste in the beginning, that lead to a bitter aftertaste. I'm usually not a big fan of bitters though. Probably not going to venture into it anymore though."
"Average on the taste and average on the entire beer. This is one of the most over-rated ales in the world. It is bland either in a can or on tap, I'm glad there are so many other choices at the bar. It is fizzy, light, a session beer for the English with low ABV. I am not an English beer lover but this one is not worth seeking."
"Always a special treat!"
"But oddly enough, it's *so* creamy, that you don't want more than one. On tap or out of the can, as was the most recent serving, I've never been able to finish a second pint. It always begins to turn my stomach -- almost as though I was drinking cream straight from the container. Worth having on occassion, and I can see how folks might absolutely love this beer. But it's not my cup of tea...er, cream...er, beer."
"Wow, I've never seen that cascading effect in a light colored beer, pretty neat. This brew was sort of a dark golden color with a thick creamy pure white head. Thats probably the best part about this beer. The aroma is sort of lacking, the little smell that is there is sort of grassy, not much else coming through. The taste is very bland imo. If anything maybe a little bit of a hoppy finish, with a slight tinge of bitterness, but it is a struggle to pick it out. This brew has the creamy draught system mouthfeel, but not near the same quality as say Beamish or Guinness. I would not purchase this beer again."
"Interesting brew. Orange in color, which suprised me. Lots of malt taste, and you had to really think of hops to taste them. Nice head, lasted til gone, went well with the steak dinner I ordered it with. I recommend it, but nothing really exceptional about it."
"Poured an orange with a big cascading fluffy head. Clean smelling with some flowery and estery scents, but not too much more. Very smooth tasting. Some toasted malt and very mild hops. There is a tea-like aftertaste that I really was not keen on at all. Maybe this is the grain tannins the bros. write of. I'd say this is a good session beer, although I don't know that I'd buy it again. I'm positive there are better pub ales out there like Abbot, etc."
"I didn't care for it and don't consider this beer very drinkable. Damn impressive pour though."
"The pour itself is entertaining, but after the cascade (less pronounced than with a Guinness), you're left with something less than remarkable. A clear, golden ale topped with a tight, impressive cake of foam that looks like freshly whipped cream and ain't going anywhere. Light, crisp grains dominate the weak smell of this beer. Exceedingly smooth and malty taste creates a nicely drinkable beer with a fine mouthfeel. That being said, nothing stands out about the taste, which starts out somewhat bitter and gets sweeter. But this one's a one-trick pony. The smell and taste seem dominated by the foaminess that is concentrated in the persistent head. The beer below brings little to the table."
"At first I thought this was going to be a very thick bitter, and it didn't look to tempting. But after it settled and I got my first taste I was not disappointed. The color was a nice golden/orangish type of color. The Froth was creamy and thick. The only bad thing I did notice was when you open the can you get an explosion of beer. This was a bitter sweet brew, with a good smooth taste. A descent beer, that some can enjoy."
"Excellent drinkability..goodbye Lights hello bitters !!"
"This bitter came in a nitro can of 440ml and ABV 3.8%. I was really amazed with this beer. Pours a beautiful pale orangy colour topped by a thick creamy white head that did not settle until the last sip. The first thing i noticed with the beer is that it goes down like water... and i mean WATER. Perhaps not the best choice for heavy drinkers but in my humble opinion it goes great with food. Great bitter from UK"
"This is not a bitter I can recommend at all, neither of my friends liked it either but my mom said she did, that's always something. ;)"
"The taste is rather bland but not bad. Drinkablity is higher because of this blandness - you could easily drink lots of these."
"Pours a deep amber color with a creamy white head that stays until the end. Nose is floral hops with some notes of fresh grains. Taste is lightly toasted grains with strong notes of hop resins and grain husks. Fairly heavy in the mouth. Bitter hop resins and tannins are present in the aftertaste. A decent beer, but somewhat overpowering."
"This beer was not what I expected.....I liked it.......Nice golden colour with a crowning glory that just does not quit, I found the taste to be very unique, is it me or does this brew taste like grapefruit? I would recomend this brew to anyone......."
"Pours clear with a darker golden yellow color than most American pilsners. Brilliant white head forms rising out of the rising top of beer with extremely small bubbles of carbonation. You are familiar with this pour if you have ever had any nitro can. I can't pick up much aroma. The taste is very subtle. This beer is mostly a delivery device for the creamy mouthfeel you get. Very low carbonation present in the beer. If this is a bitter you would hardly know it. $1.69 a can. Nothing objectionable, just nothing to bring me back unless I wanted to use this as a session beer in between something stronger."
"After a small explosion it pours a nice golden color (at least through my beer covered glasses that's what it looks like). After cleaning my glasses off I admired the excellent head on this brew. Nice and solid ale, with a little bit of honey sweetness. As far as I can tell this is a great session beer. no overwhelming bitterness or heaviness. The only fault I can see is that the can almost exploded when I opened it."
" Not my can of tea it looks a lot better taste!"
"High recommendation."
"I prefer to drink American Psuedo-Craft Beers (e.g. Sam Adams) long before this - anyday, and I'm English."
"Bright orangish-yellow with whipped cream on top. There is a more plant-like quality to this beer vis a vis Ruddles County. Orange tree branches, herbal tea (red zinger) etc. The flavors are balanced with sufficient bitterness to sharpen and focus the creamy texture. There is a twang of tart lemon pith too. A refresher and suitable for fish'n chips."
"Liking the taste of Boddington on tap, I decided to try the nitro-draught. Upon opening the can, the beer came out right away. As I poured it into a glass, the head became larger then the liquid. I waited for the beer to settle, then I took a sip of the yellowish liquid. This ruined Boddington for me. It had very little taste, almost a completely different beer. I will continue to drink Boddington on tap, but this is not the same beer."
"Somewhat of a gusher of a can when first opened, clarity and head is great. Clean floral and mildly estery aroma and flavour. Thin malt with one simple flavour throughout. Flavours are flat and seem not to meld together well in an odd processed way. This is not my can of beer."
"Its worth trying this beer to just watch the pour.  It has a head that goes on and on and on.  But after the pour it goes downhill.  Hardly andy aroma to wet your tastebuds and it was a very bland and like a previous post said boring beer......CHEERS"
"Another good widget beer. I thought this could be Caffrey's twin brother so I am rating it exactly the same. Similar bronze color, creamy, somewhat flavorless Ale."
"Awesome cascading head that races to the top of the glass, super thick, creamy off-white head, millions of tiny bubbles. Excellent retention produced minimal specks of lace. Clear, coppery-amber in hue. Eye candy. The nose is muffled, vaguely sweet rather empty, boring. Lifeless palate, lacks bitterness maltiness is very weak, hints of caramel... some metallic influences. The nitrogen kills most of the flavors. Yawn. It has a mildly disconcerting aftertaste. Creamy, thin, mouthfeel. Easy to drink but not very enjoyable maybe Id drink it in a pinch."
"There is a definite hop profile that skims just above the surface of the body and hangs steady throughout.  It is a little numbing after a while, but the afterglow helps to compensate."
"Thick white head that has a following and lasting lace as you drink.  Not much nose at all .. this was a shock.  Slightly sweet taste but no balance at all on the hop side.  It bored my tongue.  The mouth was nice and smooth.. but there is this flat slightly sweet unbalenced effect overall.  It is not bad tasting but is not a ale with any real depth of taste."
"This beer makes me laugh.  I was a little apprehensive when I could not find any reference to 'style' on the packaging, and after pouring and drinking I feel duped.  Nitro has to be a marketing gimic.  (ever compare nitro guiness to the bottle?)  On the outside Boddington is a decent and drinkable beer, inside however, a fraud."
"Using a golf reference, if it's drive for show, putt for dough, this beer is all show.  The show is good too, is just doesn't make up for a below average flavor.  Clear dark gold with a very creamy, milk white head.  Not really much aroma, just a hint of malt is all I can catch.  There's a difference between bitterness that has flavor, like a good Am. Pale Ale, and a beer being just bitter, like some light beers.  Unfortunately, this seems to fall in the latter.  The finish has a metalic quality too that isn't enjoyable.  Mouthfeel is nice with an smoothness that makes is go down easily.  I guess I'm not overly impressed with nitro cans in general, beyond the opening."
"creamy and silky silky smooth. a mild body that went right down. it was truly enjoyable to throw back. felt great all the way down. quality pub ale and truly top shelf"
"This is a beautiful beer...ohh what a sweet pour! One of the creamiest beers I have tasted. It's very similar to Caffrey's, especially in appearance, but I think it has much more flavor. Very smooth, and the mouthfeel is excellent. Quite enjoyable!"
"I love this beer. The cascading effects is amazing. Great session beer. I bet its even better on tap. It's taste is smooth and pure, with a nice amber color with a bueatiful head."
"Raincoats are optional, I dont think Boddingtons has that widget perfected yet, and Im not into ale sports..."
"This is a very nice looking beer that doesn't quite live up to its appearance.  It's not bad and definitely better than its canned brother, but it's lacking a bit in flavor."
"Clearish darker gold, 3/8 inch head after settling in glass.  Head is milky but not impressve in size.  Very little aroma.  Literally no flavor other than a sense of malt denseness and a tad of hops at the close. Mouthfeel is average other than lack of carbonation.  Its almost like drinking a glass of slightly sweetened whole milk.  One of the poorer nitro cans I've tasted, nothing tastes bad, nothing tastes good."
"This is one of my fall back beers.  I cannot believe I have not reviewed this yet; I guess it got lost.  Having this beer on tap, it's almost like a light Guiness.  I do love the Nitro, even though it does not add anything to the actual taste of the beer, it does make it creamy, and it does look terrific.  It is so smooth with some buttery/ nut flavor that invites you to drink more of it.  This is a great beer to drink at all times, all year round.  It is also a good beer to give to someone who is just beginning their venture into the world of real beer."
"20 oz. nitro can. Has the potential to be a much better beer. Pours a thick creamy yellow, with a big fluffy head, the nitro really foams this beer up. Cascades nicely. Smell wasn't especially bitter or noticable. Taste was really average, not much that jumps on your taste buds. Some hoppy bitterness, but overwhelmed by the creamy head and bubbles. The creamy feel and then watery finish is what really takes over. I also tried it on tap at my local bar, and nothing changed. No real big flavors to note. I expected so much more."
"Presentation: Packaged in a sixteen-ounce aluminum can with a nitro device, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"A very creamy brew. Pours an excellent golden color with a large creamy white head on top. Taste is very smooth, with a slight bitterness, but nothing overwhealming. The smell of the beer is about average, nothing really stands out about it in this area. Overall I like this beer, light, smooth and creamy, and easily drinkable."
"Boddintons:  English pub ale.  Very creamy beer.  Thick amber color, thick dense head. Incredibly smooth and sweet.  Very easy to drink, highly recommended."
"This is inferior to the draught. I bought this can because of my draught experience.  Looks somewhat similar to its brethern, but head is thinner and smaller.  Taste is more metallic, and the sweet biscut flavor is lighter. It is also more bitter."
"I had a friend that kept trying to hook me on this stuff.  While it's not a bad beer, I tend to agree that it suffers being in the crazy can it is in.  Would be intersted in seeing a bottle version of it.  I like the taste, but it suffers from the influence of the can and the contraption they put in it."
"it was just to creamy and buttery for me, i'm not really a fan of the whole nitro thing really, this wasn't good, cloyingly creamy."
"Just not as good from the can. A big differential IMO. Still has the creamy feel and decent taste. On tap I still feel this is my favorit ~anytime~ beer."
"Finished quite dry."
"Just average. I went to Fado's in Atlanta and it was the only thing on tap that I hadn't tried before. Pretty much run of the mill."
"Although the nitro widget is a total gimmick, one must admit it looks pretty cool.  Typical well - retained, thick, creamy head as expected from a nitro can.  Golden hue, nice clarity.  Just a hint of earthy Fuggles in the nose, not much else there.  Somewhat artificial hop bitterness and flavor, with a metallic note and the slightest bit of esteriness from the yeast.  A bit of diacetyl surfaces as the beer warms.  It's a bit weak and watery in mouthfeel.  Finishes clean and bland.  Boddingtons is nice to look at, but there's not much in the way of character in this brew."
"the cascading effect was amazing...but that's where the amazement ends.  the head does coat the glass the whole way down.....but i found this ale sort of boring.   i wouldn't assasinate it like some reviews i read, but it's nothing special.  it's full bodied and creamy smooth but i do detect the slight metallic hoppy aftertaste which i didn't find too offensive.   i'd drink it again."
"I feel like I'm going against the grain here and rating this somewhat higher than the rest, but I enjoy this beer.  Its a blond Guinness.  I have no problem with blonds or brunettes (or redheads for that matter).  This pours to a very, Guineess-like creamy sideshow and settles into a very, low carbinated thirst-quencher.  These go down very quickly."
"Extremely disappointing.  Typical nitro-widget can creamyness, but whatever flavor the beer had was overwhelmed by the nitrogen infusion.  What I did get was a fairly bland, slightly metallic flavor with hints of husky tannins.  Warming was of no benefit."
"Astringent, tinny taste. Not much else."
"And, too bad about the nitro. Nitro beers, in general, tend to mask a lot of the beers character ... which is why most nitro beers share common characteristics, regardless of their style."
