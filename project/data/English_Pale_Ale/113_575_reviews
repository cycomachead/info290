"One of my favorite friends from across the pond. Sessionable, very drinkable. I even love the bottles!"

"To me, it's the perfect beverage.  I've been drinking it since 1982 when I was stationed in England while in the US Air Force."

"Overall: Not what I was expecting even for an English Pale Ale. The astringency is overpowering and unpleasant, and I had not had any beer, let alone a pale ale with such a strong caramel flavor. However, I suspect there was something wrong with this bottle: The color was darker than most others described it, the astringency was overpowering, even for an English Pale ale the hops were non-existent, and it really just seemed off. I'm leaving this review for future comparison to other English Pale Ales."

"I've had much better from Sam Smith's- I'd like to try this in England, possibly- this was likely an old bottle."

"Bottle purchased from Oak & Vine on 16 Ave in Calgary, only place so far in this city I have found this classic. Pours an amazing bronze amber hue, almost marmalade orange, with a lot of white foam. I had to rush to contain the initial fizzy blast but things very quickly settled down. Aroma was heady and multifaceted, with sweet malts, stone fruits, and earthy hops predominating. This beer is a classic quintessential English ale, with ample character and complexity. Earthy woody English hops lead the way with a hint of apricot (Goldings aroma) against a rich toffee backdrop, considerable crystal malt sweetness but a lot of hop character to provide balance. Some sour crabapple and marmalade citrus flavors add complexity. Dark fruit (raisin) character and diacetyl butterscotch emerge in the finish, along with a mineral bite and old wine fermented notes. Great tapestry of English beer flavors. Body medium thick, with a lingering syrupy sweetness. Lots of residual sugars here. I am an unabashed Samuel Smith fan and this is one of the classics of the genre. Bottles may come off as a bit ""old"" in flavor but the overall effect is that of a timeless examplar of one of the great beer styles of the world."

"O- An outstanding pale. Highly recommended for those that don't care to be bombarded with IBUs. A delicious herbal flavor."
""

"A well executed, authentic pale ale. Sweet, malty aroma with notes of burnt sugar or molasses. Appearance is bright, clear copper, with a light, relatively fast-dissipating head. Flavour is quite sweet with a strong hop-layered finish, that lingers and hints at toffee. The balance is slightly toward bitter, but a well-balanced beer overall. The mouthfeel is generally light and effervescent, and contrasts sharply with the complexities within the malt and hop flavours."

"Old Brewery pale ale pours a darker cooper color with a small lacing head. There is a floral aroma with a creamy note that Is full of nut and toffee notes, but its enjoyable. The taste has some floral notes, but it has a very unique okay undertone, and the flavor has some warmth from the alcohol, strong nut and toffee flavors. Easy to drink, just a tad watery. Overall its a pale, with some very unique flavors."

"Overall, a very enjoyable english pale. Samuel Smiths brewery seems to do nothing bad, they just have more offerings that are better. A solid English Pale Ale, but not my most favorite pale and definitely not my most favorite from this brewery. You should try this at least once."

"the glory of these beers is their price, less than 4 bucks per go? are you kidding me?! the quality to price point is unrivaled in the beer world. while some are outstanding, standard setters, others are just okay. this pale ale is somewhere in between. its clear in the pours, more red than copper, with a finger of off white bubbles that pop down to a thin skin before long. the nose is quintessentially English, with all the caramel malt dusty attic you could ever want, but with a welcomed touch of vanilla extract. the yeast doesn't really manifest itself until the flavor, neither do the hops. the yeast combines with the caramel malt to give a doughy cereal profile, while the hops finish the beer nice and bitter, balancing the vanilla expertly. tastes just a tad old at the end, but ill bet this is nearly perfect at the source on tap. thinner body, which im back and forth between liking and not, and airy carbonation that keeps this beer drinking easily. overall this isn't my favorite beer from sam smiths, but now that I have worked my well into their lineup, I can safely say that the quality of this brew is up to the high bar of the others. again, the economics cannot be beat."
"O: I have been really into the English session ales lately and this one is another treat."
"Samuel Smith's Old Brewery Pale Ale might be spot-on for the style, but I found it rather boring. If you have an affinity for British session ales, this might be your cup of tea."

"3.8/5.00"
"BUT my bet is I am going to find better at a cheaper price. Still, when in doubt, this brew is fine."
""

"Overall decent, but not nearly as special as everyone else seems to think."

"The reddish-brown of this excellent beer looked very nice, but the soon-to-follow aroma... oh, it was impressive! The caramelized malty character shows itself so well, but yet so unobtrusively. We also have a background tofee-like smell. The controlled bitterness at the beginning, which precedes an unexpected, but real, carbonation impression at the palate, is very soothing actually. In the end, the hops appear more clearly, which is pleasant and refreshing. Fantastic beer!"
""

"Samuel Smith's Old Brewery Pale Ale ---4/5."
""
"T: This isn't the hop bomb I've come to look for in pale ales, but it's sneaky good. Some toasted caramel malt, honey malt, and grain with just a touch of hop bitterness. Some fruity esters linger in the background. Finish is squeaky clean. Super drinkable."
""
""

"O: A good little English pale with a nice profile and great drinkability. Worthy of the name and a purchase"

"Malty beer, traditional English Pale ale, don’t look for complexity. Second time I tried and this one didn’t go well, maybe because I had it too warm, I will need to give it a new try."
""
"O - There seems to be a decent reason why I looked past this brew for such a long time. The other brews out of Sammy Smith's dwarf what this beer presents."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a well balanced and easy drinking brew. A good break from the super hopped up American pale ales. Just what I would expect from the Brits, balance and modesty."
""
""
""
""
""

"A most enjoyable beer; nicely balanced with a low-key complexity."

"This, to me, is the benchmark for pale ales in my young beer tasting career.."

"Very enjoyable beer with a great fruity flavour and plenty of hops on top of a strong malt base. Everything was well-balanced and worked well together giving a lingering, sweet hoppy taste."

"Drinkability : a good beer ine English style Pale Ale."
""
""
"Nice pale ale to enjoy the malt side of the ale without having to fight through the bitterness of American Pale Ales."
"one more note- i noticed the pictureon the site has the words on the label with a BLACK background and the bottle i have has a BLUE background. i remember it always being black. wonder if i have something different? or did they change the color?"

"O: Not too familiar with a lot of English style ales except for Brown ales and Stouts. But as far as a Pale ale goes, it has a nice twist to what im used to drinking. Not quite 6 pack worthy, but good for an English style bomber."

"Good example of style."
"Poured into a pint glass. Pours copperr with a biege head. The head dissipates slowly, leaving some lacing on the side of the glass. The aroma is of sweet bready malt and some mild floral hops. The taste is sweet and bready. There are some mild hops on the back end. The flavors are very well balanced. The body is medium with adequate carbonation. The beer is smooth. The drinkability is very high. This is an excellent pale ale and certainly the best English pale ale I've tried."
""
""
"This beer is known as the brewery's flagship beer! When you pour it in a glass, its a copper coloured beer. The head and big and fluffy. When you gulp it, the beer will tease your palate and you will get the aroma of malt, hops and even a hint of apple. It has great flavours and aromatics. A nice drink for the holiday season!"
"O: Samuel Smith does not make a bad beer, period; I’m convinced. Chalk this one up as another English great, and add one more brew to my must-find-on-cask list."
""
""
"One of the best English pale ales I've tried. It makes me want to travel back over to England."
""
"Samuel Smith’s Old Brewery Pale Ale - The bottle says: “Brewed with hard well water (the original well sunk in 1758 is still in use), best barley malt, yeast, and aromatic hops to create a copper-coloured ale with a full, rounded flavor; fermented in ‘stone Yorkshire squares’; the finish is a perfect balance of malt and hops. A good many British beers were very dark before the Industrial Revolution; new malting techniques led to pale malts allowing the evolution of this classic brewing style - a cornerstone of British pub culture."
"The palate opens rather full, moderately mineral-rich (more cationic flavors) and with a nice balance between toffee, caramel and a mildly earthy hop flavor. Bitterness is mild, perfectly complementing the toffee flavors. A touch of butterscotch is present as well. Light in body with moderate carbonation, this is drying on the finish with a blend of toffee, hoppy bitterness, a little butterscotch and minerals. The bitterness and minerals, in particular, make this stand apart from other beers of the style that I've had. Very good stuff, highly recommended."
"What a great beer! Simple, refreshing, and surprisingly full of complex flavors. Another victory for Samuel Smith."
""
""
"O: I have to say that this was a surprisingly drinkable Pale Ale. Quite complex and uniquely different than an American style pale ale. I will be sipping this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
" Pouted into a pint glass, the first thing that stands out with this Pale Ale is its bright orange appearance; a quick whiff reveals a wonderful sweetness. Taste is sweet at first and bitter at the back end; an exhale after swallowing reveals a nice caramel note. I enjoyed the second half of the bottle with (spicy) Indian food--paired extremely well."
""
""
"O: A refreshing and enjoyable pale ale. Just don't expect it to be nearly as hoppy as an American Pale."
""
""
"Interesting pale, but not earth-shattering."
""
"O- A solid English Pale Ale. Drinkable and tasty."
""
"O: I really love flavorful English Pale and this is a fine example. Sometimes I prefer it to the American variant, as they tend to be more on the side of IPA that's toned down a bit. But this beer, with its distinctive English flavors, really is enjoyable and I will have again and again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Impressive pale ale. Lots of complex interesting flavor and aromas. Would definitely grab this again."
"Finishes clean and dry. Has a nice and creamy mouth feel. This is truly a very drinkable English pale ale."
"O: Wow, such a clean...tasty, complex beer. A true session beer in my opinion. I could drink this straight through dinner and into dessert. The Samuel Smith's India Pale Ale is next for tonight and I couldn't be more excited!"
""
"O - This is a well made English pale ale. Very enjoyable and much different than an american Pale Ale."
""
"O- A very fine, perfectly balanced ale that manages to feel highly satisfying despite not having loads of flavours or high compexity. Highly drinkable and even decently refreshing"
"Pours a hazy amber with a small white lasting beige with good retention. Aroma and Taste is sweet caramel malt, some citrus and fruity notes, some yeast and bread, with some light piney hops. A medium body brew with moderate carbonation on the palate with a smooth mouthfeel. Finishes with a good sweet caramel malt character, some yeast, followed by some fruity citrus notes ending with some good bitter hops to balance the sweetness. Overall a good, balanced session brew."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I continuously read and hear that England knows how to pay attention to balance, and this beer is living proof. Can't wait to enjoy another!"
""
""

""
""

"overall: very drinkable beer"
"This is just a fantastic pale ale, complex layers of flavour and just a great beer. I'd recommend this to anyone."
"very good, loads of flavor for this english pale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a very easy drinking Pale Ale. There is a sort of musty feel about it that I find in all of Samuel Smith's beers, but I'm not saying that's a bad quality, I like it, and I think this beer falls in line with all of their other wonderful brews."
"Final Thoughts: I find myself finding the English and Scottish styles far better suited to my pallet then their American counterparts. I think this unseats St-Ambroise as my pale ale of choice. I think the best part is that they kept bitterness in check and didn't aim closer to IPA territory. Highly recommend this one."
""
"Overall - Despite loving Samuel Smith's, I have steered clear of this one for years because the Nut Brown and the Oatmeal and the Imperial were always sitting right next to it and because I'm not a pale ale or IPA guy in general. But this is great. What a nice and drinkable pairing of honey malty sweet and mild hop bitter in a light and refreshing package. If I could ask for anything it might be a bit more robustness on the back end to increase the richness and to slow me down a bit. But on the whole it's a very pleasant, sessionable, well-made, and pleasingly flavored beer."
""
""
"O: I've always really liked this beer and my opinion has not changed in the slightest over the years. Few English pale ales, or at least few that I've tried, are as flavorful as Samuel Smith's Old Brewery Pale Ale. This is an exquisite ale. If your familiarity with English pales stops at Whitbread and/or Bass, then this beer should be a must try for you."
""
""
"D: If American craft beers are renowned for being innovative, the Brits are known for doing the same exact thing fairly well for generations. This is most certainly a British beer. Could easily see throwing a few of these back in a pub."
""
""

"D ok but nothing special. Overall a textbook English pale"

"This was a very nice pale ale. The color and the smell were fine but the taste was very traditional barley malt with just a touch of hops. The balance of the malt and hops are what make this ale so good. First there is the malt smell then the tasted of malt which trails off into the mild hop crispness. I liked this ale very much and recommend it to those who enjoy English traditional ales."
""
""
""
""
""
"Anyway, going off the bottle I had, I'd say this isn't a bad beer, but it doesn't compare well to the Fuller's London Pride I had earlier in the evening."
"WELL DONE, GIVE IT A GO!"
"This is a well balanced, malty, delicious example of the style. I've had it on several occasions, and I've enjoyed it every time."
"Notes: Killer. This beer instantly joins the Pantheon. I allow the sweetness of this beer to pass through the gates unmolested as the overall composition of this masterpiece works in every way."
"O: I was a bit dissappointed by the head retention and lacing. The smell was a bit too mild. Overall, very drinkable though, and very smooth. I like the flavor."
"This is an ale for all times. Definitely worth a try and comes highly recommended."
"Overall: A very fine English pale ale. Very malty but the sweetness is nice and not too much. Pretty well balanced."
"Copper with slightly cloudy consistency. Thin, off-white head, though definite lacing. Malty apple aroma with hints of berry. Creamy medium body with med-high bitterness. Malty, caramel taste, slightly toasty with a refreshing finish. Nice representation of an ESB."
"Small amount of fluffy head over a golden orange body. Nose is bready white toast with a faint fruity hop character. Flavor is the same as nose. Light bready flavor with a metallic sourness. Some fruity hops notes but I'm thrown off by this malty sourness. It doesn't taste infect but just a bad mix of malts. I drank the whole bottle but won't be buying this again."
"O: An easy beer to drink, light for a medium bodied beer"
"Pours copper with a beautifully frothy off white head... Lacing stays glued to the glass as you drink it down. Aroma is unique. Kind of a toasty banana scent, caramel and bready malts with hint of floral hops. Flavor has a sweet caramel malt flavor with a light bitter finish. Exceptionally creamy mouthfeel, medium body. Very pleasant beer. Thanks Sam."
"Overall: I enjoyed this, it may have been my first English Pale Ale and is not comparable to American Pale Ales. I little heavier because of the sweetness and not as hoppy bitter."
"T/M/O- Dry, Carmel malts upfront, sweet candy type flavor; I've read prior to this review of other saying flavors of jolly rancher, grape flavor comes to mind or maybe a hint of watermelon. Hop bitterness is minimal, I really like the dry bite to this brew, flavor is there with a strong complex presence, and then dissipates quickly. Very good stuff, although one or two of these is plenty for my tastes. To strong in the Carmel maltiness of it, i could see getting fatigued with that. Overall its a good beer."
"O: a very very fine representation of the style. Would love to have this on tap. Like all Samuel Smith's beers, this is afire, fine beer. Recommended!"
"Overall-Simple, and straight to the point. Like all Sam Smith beers it's very drinkable. This 550 will be finished shortly."
"Really good and highly drinkable. Maybe just a little too sweet for the style maybe? But really good. I could sit and drink a pile of these."
"Notes: The Nut Brown was quite nice, the Imperial Stout was amazing, and this beer falls somewhere between those two. I've still got two more bottles of Sam Smith's to try before I pick my favorite. As far as pale ales go, I think I have a new champion."
"O - Easily one of my favorite EPA's, a beer I could easily have 3 or 4 of in a night."
"O: This beer is very sessionable as it’s easy to drink and goes down very smoothly."
"Mine is a heavy brown bottle, vice the clear one in the picture. My pour created a finger of tawny head with decent retention. Color was a slightly hazy orangish-amber. Nose was highly malty, underlain with grassy hops. Mouthfeel was silky smooth with tastes of honey and raspberries on the tongue. Great goshdarn! How have I overlooked this beer for so long?!? Finish was very fruity with a little butteriness, to boot. How do they do that? I gotta make a mental note of this one."
"All-in-all I think this beer is a little too mild on the bitterness for a English Pale Ale (SB). With that said, this is a very enjoyable drink."
"This is what I think of when I think of a British Pale ale. Lots of malt, easy to drink and very flavorful."
"D: eh, good but not great. maybe im just not a fan of EPA's but i cant really get stoked on this one. a little too sweet in my opinion."
"overall - good beverage trhat was a pleasure to drink"
"O: Wish I could give this one a higher score, but the nose was just off-putting. Too bad."
"A twist on what I was expecting for a pale. This being my first EPA i was sadly surprised at the lack of a hop character. The flavor profile was excellent but lacked in that citric bite. Glad I tried it but would probably not purchase again. Good brew Samuel Smith Old Brewery."
"Overall - somewhat interesting in taste, and even still good tasting in general. Worth a try!"
"Serving type: bottle"
"This Pale ale pours out slightly darker than most of the typical pale ales out there today. This look more like an IPA with its really nice copper color. The head is white and doesn't have the best retention. The aroma is earthy and had a strong backbone of malts coming from it. The flavor is a little hoppy, but it's more grainy than anything. The mouthfeel was decent, good carbonation and drinkable on mostly all aspects."
"Overall - No freshness date on the bottle, but guessing the single bottle I picked up at Trader Joes isn't exactly brewery fresh. Put an asterisk on this review - given the reputation of the brewery I'm sure a quality sample of the beer is significantly better!"
"O - A very sesionable ale with plenty on offer."
"When this is fresh and well-kept - sophisticated, transcendent, satisfying as hell."
"Overall - The beer is good but doesnt offer anything new or special to the pale ales. Solid and easy to drink, a good starter beer or if you enjoy bitter beers. I could live without this one imo."
"Drinkability - This beer is very easy to drink. Solid all around. Could be enjoyed year round also. I thought it might be a bit fuller, but that's ok. It is what it is. I mean it's Sam Smith's, how bad could it be? It's still head and shoulders above any macro."
"Picked this up at the biggest beer store in the UK, Beers of Europe Ltd. Clear copper-amber pour with two finger head, decent retention and nice lacing. Earthy, malty nose with hints of caramel, butterscotch, perfume, and a touch of metal. The taste follows suit. Earthy, fruity and nutty with a nice tangy, herbal fresh hop bite. A solid toffee, malty base balances it out nicely with a hint of butterscotch and a touch of molasses. A little fizzy at first, but smoothed out nicely becoming very drinkable as it warmed. Great balance with a nice slightly dry, tangy bitter finish. Another great beer from Samuel Smith's."
"I don't often purchase this product when I visit the local beer store. Perhaps it is the price and no freshness date. I was delighted with the freshness of this bottle. This is a complex but quaffable ale for any season."
"Overall, I was pleased with this brew, not as much as other Samuel Smiths brews, but I would definitely have another."
"The beer goes down well enough, but the apple juice/cider qualities are a limiting factor for me. They are a but too strong for my tastes."
"Drinkability is high. I could drink pint after pint of this excellent Pale Ale from Tadcaster!"
"Clear copper with an off white head. Decent head with moderate lacing. Smell is full of caramel and brown bread. A big fruity aspect brings plums and light figs. Taste features the aforementioned with a mineral edge. Earthy finish brings more minerals to the fore. Not a bad thing just a bit sharp and metallic. Body is full of caramel and fruit. Sweet yeasty brown bread with toasted notes as well. Feel is smooth and gently carbonated with a touch of creaminess. Medium weight has a touch of chew to it. Goes down nicely with a satisfying heartiness for a pale ale."
"12 oz. bottle. Pours copper with a foamy off-white head. Aroma is of bready malt, caramel and ripe fruit. Medium, slightly crisp body. Taste is dominated by earthy, peppery hops while caramel malt provide some balance. Long, peppery finish. Quite an ordinary bitter."
"The color when poured was a dark amber, with a reddish hue. Very little foam, but fair lace retention on the glass. The taste was of mild roasted malts with a lack luster hoppy flavor. Weak on the aftertaste, but a bit to bitter. Overall, not a big smell, weak flavor and a little to bitter."
"D- A malty, light to medium body amber ale that I'd only choose if the only other choices were regular lager."
"Feels smooth, crisp, and dry to the palate. Altogether a nice sessionable pale ale."
"Pours a clear golden abber with a nice fluffy white head, leaving decent lacing. Grassy, grainy, and herbal tones hit the nose. Sweet malts, a biscuit-like grain tone and the slightest of hops in the taste. Medium bodied with a dry feel, and a toasted feeling in the aftertaste. A decent drinker, one I imagine would be even better off tap."
"Russet in color with a 1/2"" pillowy cream colored head. Head quickly fades to a tight lace on top. Lot's of sweet malt in the nose with some herbal and grassy hop aromas. It's the simple complexity that makes this beer so delicious. Caramal malts, sweet breads, just enough grassy and herbal hops. Incredibly balanced. Incredibly simple. Incredibly delicious. This is the standard to which I hold all English Pale Ales. Very dry mouthfeel with a toasty aftertaste. Easy to drink and very enjoyable."
"D - Well I like it and its hard to believe its an English pale ale since most offend me with herb notes this one is sweet yet bitter and kind of a dry finish. Not something I would hunt for but I would pick it up at the same price."
"O: Very drinkable beer. I really like the earthiness of this one. Aroma is especially pleasant. Hits the spot some days. This is one of the beers that made me fall in love with beer in general, and I still haven't gotten tired of it. Though it's not the best beer I've ever tried, it might just be the best in its category (the organic version is great too). Anyways, I'd recommend this beer to anyone - you might not love it, but I bet you'll appreciate it."
"Overall: A good balanced, drinkable pale ale. This beer does not have all the qualities I was hoping to taste, however it is still very enjoyable."
"Pour resulted in a two finger head of light brown thick suds. Great clinging lace with nice pattern. The color is a 20 on the SRM beer color chart with just a slight bit of haziness. Smells of sour dough bread, caramel, and some earthly tones. Flavorful, with hints of bread, caramel, molasses, sweet malt, and hops. Full body of creaminess in my mouth. Good tight flavor with lots of character, will have more of this in the future."
"Overall, this is another great offering from Samuel Smith's. I was genuinely impressed, as I was not expecting that much from it. Truly English, Truly Ale. Recommended!"
"drinkability; the aftertaste hangs around for a bit too long but besides that a pretty drinkable beer."
"I have always been a big fan of Samuel Smith beers. Unfortunately the Old Brewery Pale Ale did not work for me. There was an undescribable flavor/taste to this particular S.S. that I just did not care for. I plan to stick with many of the other beers from their line."
"Would certainly drink again, though might not choose over other examples of the style."
"drinkability is ok - good price good taste - its just the mouthfeel that kills it a little"
"D - quite drinkable, but not my overall style."
"Drinkability: An excellent exemplar of the English Pale Ale style. Definitely something lovers of the style should try and something I certainly wouldn't mind having again."
"Poured a 2"" head which dissipates to 1/8"". Surprisingly dark for a pale ale, looks like Lipton tea. In fact both in bottle and in glass my sample looks surprisingly dark compared to the photo in the BA reviews. Has a nice creaminess, some malt, and a hint of coffee in the flavor. Honestly, to me this seems like an aborted stout, like they started to make multiple things out of their stout process and with more time or a little tweaking this pale ale would indeed have been a stout. Enjoyable, but not what I expect from a pale ale."
"The price was reasonable, but I would not buy this beer again so I guess it is not worth it."
"The pale ale, unfortunately, was my least favorite of the evening. But it paired well with the roast beef, horseradish mashed potatoes, and yorkshire pudding we enjoyed with it. I just wish it was a bit more flavor-forward and expressive. While discussing this with Samuel, we talked about American Pale Ales and he mentioned he enjoyed a few in Seattle the previous evening and said they were fantastic but certainly too hoppy for a session ;)"
"drink up chaps"
"Overall, this is big on flavour, without any particular one standing out. Nicely drinkable, and what I imagine a proper EPA to be. Could see sessioning a few rounds of this in a dim pub, arguing the various inconsequential merits of Champions or Premier league play."
"D-Another fine beer from Samuel Smith's. Not my favorite beer in their fine lineup due to style. But, they are among the best at getting so much flavor and other characteristics in a 5% ABV beer."
"D - If one can handle a heavy beer by just by sipping and savoring, this beer is for you."
"d - very easy and enjoyable to drink"
"It goes down smooth but leave a nice little complex hoppy taste behind. I can't really pin-point any exact flavors in here but it sure is good. I could defiantly drink a few of these in a row and not get tired of it. I would say this Pale Ale is a step above most Pale Ale's."
"Drinkability: With its fairly mild flavor and smoothness this beer is pretty drinkable."
"Notes: Well done. Another Sam Smith classic."
"Drinkability: Went well with a meal (pork chops and homemade ginger gold applesauce) and I suspect it would be good on it's own, but I'll admit to getting bored with this beer by the end. It's a single flavor profile beer. It showcases malts and that's about it. It is however, a good example of a British beer, and maybe I needed something less sweet in the meal to go with it and then I would have appreciated it more."
"Drinkability: Really good beer, the taste is quite complex yet contains nothing too overbearing. Simple, smooth, and good."
"A very solid drinkable beer."
"all in all a good beer. I think it is a great execution of the style. Seems very traditional. It did not let me down...in the age of super hoppy beers a refreshing more malty change. All in balance."
"Poured from a bottle into a glass where it formed a thick white head. The liquid turned to a dark orangish brown color. The smell was not strong but on first sip you could taste the flavor of the beer. There was no strong after taste and it went down clean. As you continued to drink you could continue to see the remains of the head sticking to the side of the glass. Overall a very drinkable beer."
"A little bit of sweetness lingers on the finish. Rather clean for the most part though. Pretty drinkable and refreshing beer with character."
"Drinkability is very good. Refreshing and tasty."
"Pours an orangy brown color with minimal off white head. Scent is of fresh bread, toffee, roasted nuts and a faint touch of watery fruit. Taste brings again the taste of fresh bread, touches of sweet carmel, toffee, nuts, butter, watery fruit. Medium bodied, slightly grainy, perfect carbonation, slightly dry. An all around fresh tasting, highly drinakable and enjoyable malt forward english ale."
"Had a nice medium body to it, very smooth. Very drinkable too, I polished the bottle off easily and could have kept drinking more. I could see drinking a bunch of these in a pub. Went will with some grilled catfish and corn, I imagine it's a pretty good all-around food beer. Not flashy but a solid and delicious beer."
"Taste is nicely balanced between slightly sweet malts and floral hop flavoring and bitterness. Malts are toasty and caramely. Mouthfeel is very nice on this one...very creamy feeling and perfectly carbonated. Probably the most refreshing British pale Ale I have had thus far. Minerality comes through, chalky even. Fruit is kept surprisingly mild for an EPA. I really like it and cannot believe it took 12 years of craft beer drinking to finally try it!"
"pretty drinkable overall"
"I actually like this a lot better than Fullers but I know I am crazy to say this, but I like the much lighter colored Sam Adams Pale Ale better than both. Much better drinkablity."
"Samuel smith is always great for full flavored beers.. you can really taste this from the front to the back of the mouth.. nice soft feel but enough dryness to leave a lasting finish.. this is a classic pale ale. it is light enough to drink as a session..yet the flavor is powerful and lasting. this ranks very highly in my opinion."
"Decent beer, not somthing I'd seek out. Although I'd really like to taste this fresh, I think it would be a completely different beer."
"Excellent mouthfeel. A medium-full body and modest carbonation render quite a smooth texture. This beer is good but not great, as it falls short in the flavor department. Not one of my favorite styles, nor my favorite brew from Mr. Smith."
"Copper colored, this beer has a light haze to the body with an ample bone-colored head atop. Stonefruit and butter toffee permeate the nose, the fruit being especially prominent, lightly sweet and lightly tart. It has a bit of graininess to it as well, pale and amber malts with a touch of biscuit. The taste is similar to the aroma, but rearranged; the biscuit-like malts are foreward, with a mild jam-like fruitiness behind. It's like taking a bite of toast covered in peach preserves and butter. Hearty but light, this has a lot of depth yet it's very quaffable and balanced. It ends on a malty and mildly buttery and fruity note with only a hint of bitterness, ultimately drying and crackery. Very good."
"This is a clear and brassy brew which sports a prolific and stubborn bubbly tan head. Lace is thin and spotty where it exists. Smells of caramel malts, some light fruits, grain, some faint hops and tannins. Really complex for the style. Tastes of sweet malts, more light fruits, faint cinnamon and tea leaves. A slight nuttiness comes out later on. Goes down smooth and almost creamy. Highly drinkable yet interesting makes for a great combo."
"Poured from a brown 18.7 oz. bottle. Has a dark brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is nutty, hops, maybe a touch of honey. Taste is also nutty, balanced hops and malts, some honey. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this is a good quality beer."
"Drinkability: I can really enjoy one of these, but alas, I find myself wanting something else after that. I seem to recall enjoying this much more a couple of years ago, to the point of its being one of my favorite pale ales, but now I think it's just pretty good. Definitely worth a try if you haven't had it; I don't think most people would regret getting a four-pack. Also interesting for being a maltier kind of pale ale than many I've had."
"A medium light body with relatively low carbonation this one is very quaffable."
"Mouthfeel is medium."
"The body is mild with a silky-smooth texture and a clean finish, making it very drinkable."
"D - Very tasty. Another great offering from Samuel Smith."
"Drinkability: It has been a while since I have consumed a true English Pale Ale, the style pretty much having been abandoned by American craft brewers; an enjoyable change of pace, even though the style is not one I would reach for every day"
"Good session beer."
"Drinkability: quite drinkable indeed. I'm going to go enjoy the rest of this out on the patio."
"Notes: I really like this style and this is a good example. Very traditionally British, but will please almost anyone."
"O: Good drinkability. Quite light and refreshing beer but at the same time with strong British personality. An authentic British Ale. Light in alcohol, balanced bitterness, dry taste, good perfume of earthy yeasts and fresh hops. Recommended"
"Beer is oddly bitter, highly drinkable, medium to full body. Overall its really smooth and there is almost a red like flavor / sweetness in the front of the mouth. Overall its pretty good."
"This just has such a nice combination of complex but mild flavors that it's hard to stop quaffing."
"D: A very solid English Pale Ale that is slightly light on bitterness and high on fruitiness, as is common in the style."
"Poured into my favorite beer glass toasted English malt fills the aroma. It has a full white head and a almost cloudy amber color. The flavor starts sweet with a slight amount of carbonation but finished dry but a slightly nutty aftertaste. A very good English and I like its complexity despite the lack of hops that I've come to like in an American style"
"D - HIGHLY drinkable. Added to my short list of session standby's, I'll pick this up whenever it's available."
"Taste, a little earthy grassy minimal hop presence. Tastes mild and balanced. Easygoing. Smooth mouthfeel. Approaches the nut brown ale in that characteristic. Tea flavor. Toffee too."
"Poured this into Sam Smith's nonic, included in gift pack. Poured amber colour with creamy white head which retains well and has good lacing. The smell and taste consists of earthy hops with a touch of fruitiness. Mouthfeel is smooth, light, and a little bit of dry as well. Overall, a great beer, but I prefer the nut brown."
"D - One word: DAMN! 5.0"
"Very well balanced flavors make this a great drinkable session beer."
"Drinkablity: An English pale ale done properly. This beer amazes me, it has all the strong & complex malt and fruity esters of an English Barley wine yet remains with a modest Alcohol content. Its not as warming alcohol wise of course but all the flavor is there. If you really want a sessionable ale that is complex and extremely flavorful this your beer. I've always been a fan of American Pale Ales with a strong malt taste and a touch of bitter hops. This beer however is changing my mind a bit, instead of floral flavors this is packed full of malt and fruit. A total English Classic and world class Pale ale."
"D: A classic Pale Ale from Sam Smith's. A great beer that will tell you what English pale ales/bitters are about. Great complexity and nuance."
"Slainte."
"Pours a deep amber with a big tan head that laces the glass. Aroma is almost entirely of toasted malt, with some wet earth also detectable. The taste is simple, not very catchy. The toasted malts are supported by a mineral and black tea bitterness that is good but not eyebrow raising. Given how expensive it is I expected more. Probably my least favorite of the major Samuel Smith beers."
"The feel and bodyy was a little on the light side. The carbonation was very sharp initially and kept my cheeks puckered through the finish. This one's not bad, but not the brewery""s best."
"Beer #2 from the sampler pack, the pale ale is a solid English pale, very balanced between malt and bitterness. I'd like to try this on cask sometime."
"Overall this reaffirms my conclusion that I prefer the American hop strains versus those out of the UK. But this is certainly a nice change of pace and the first beer that's impressed me out of Samuel Smith's stable."
"D: It's not my favorite Samuel Smith beer but it might be the most drinkable, this could easily be a session beer."
"Drinkability - Very nice in the sense that it dries nicely towards the end and leaves your mouth wanting more. Keeps my tastebuds very inquisitive wanting to know what else is in this very well put together beer."
"550ml brown bottle served in my Samuel Smith nonic. Poured a translucent copper with a frothy, creamy white head embedded with sizzling and popping ringlets. Head settles into a half inch cap, leaving strands of lacing adhering to the walls of the glass during the session. Nose is light - cereal grains and a kiss of aromatic hops. Taste consistent with nose - a little bit watery, perhaps a little earthy/peppery in the mix and finishes slightly bready/malty/caramely. Mouthfeel is fairly light in body with a lively carbonation level and a somewhat clean finish. Pretty easy drinking session beer and a solid example of the style."
"Realize that, as one who is used to an American Pale Ale, this needs to be judged on a different scale, but this doesn't really do it for me. It's a bit ""blah", and though the hops start to come through a bit more as it warms, it's still not what you expect from a pale ale. The fact that you can sense the alcohol (not in a good way, for me) is telling. This is a classic and I'm in the minority here, but this one's not in my wheelhouse."
"Overall, this is a solid example of a ""English Pale Ale"". It seems to have a bit more dark roasted character then usual for the style. Great if you like that sort of thing. The flavors are somewhat subtle and it's fairly easy drinking and not too heavy. If you love hoppy American style pale ales and ipa, then you might not care for this one. Cheers."
"Notes: This is one of my lesser favorite beers I've had from Samuel Smith. However, this is more of a commentary on my preference, or lack thereof, for pale ales, and not on the beer itself. When I do crave an English pale ale in the future, I most likely will drink this. I'll also have to try Samuel Smith's organic version of a pale ale to compare the two."
"D: very solid to style, like the sweetness, hops play an interesting and very non-american role."
"Medium and very drinkable..."
"Samuel Smith's Old Brewery Pale Ale was a good beer, although I prefer the Oatmeal Stout. It actually isn't that pale. It poured a golden brown color with a very foamy head. It smells fairly sweet and tastes sweet as well. It has a slight bitter after taste, but not too over powering. I also thought it was a little more carbonated than other beers I've had. The Pale Ale was a good beer, give it a try if you get the chance."
"This is one of the better pale ales out there. I'd have liked just a bit more boldness in the color and a slightly more assertive taste, but if you enjoy a good pale ale now and then this is one you'd do well to try."
"Remember before you review this beer: this is an English Pale Ale, not an American Pale Ale. Nice Pale Ale appearance with an orange-straw colored body and an ivory cap. Lots of biscuity notes in the nose from what I'm guessing is a monstrous malt profile, sweet, ripe fruits and mild toffee. Not a complete lack of hops in the taste but almost. Toasted sweet malts and a buttery, nutty, almost honey-like character. Mouthfeel is smooth, not to dry and creamy like a good EPA should be. Nice classic-won't knock your socks of but quality example and a nice friend to turn to when there is isn't a great selection surrounding it."
"Not extremely sessionable due to the heft. It's a pretty good beer though. Not particularly cheap, so this is probably something I'd drink seldomly. Probably everything else I've had from the brewery will get the nod over this."
"Great atmosphere. Big beautiful head, full complex nose with a multitude of components. Very well done. Flavor has equal complexity. Mostly grain components, but all the bases are covered, and finished with a nice bitter and sweet touch. Overall, this is a great quaff."
"D: One of the classic English pale ales. If you're a Bass drinker, treat yourself to a higher breed of English pales and grab the highly sessionable Sam Smith pale ale."
"Drinkability: Excellent. Something you could see Sherlock Holmes drinking in his favorite pub with Watson by his side."
"Part of a gift pack poured into the pint glass that came with set. Pours a beautiful clear cooper color with a nice big head that stays around. Was surprised by the lack of lacing minimal at best. A very neutral aroma to my nose. This ale is well balanced and not real big on flavor but pleasant to drink, would pair nicely with a large variety of foods. Would make a good session brew."
"D- overall a spectacular drinker, i could make a night of drinking these"
"I have always had a liking for English pale ales, Old Brewery Pale Ale was no exception."
"Another great beer from Sam Smith. I love their stuff. Everything is the benchmark example of an English ale."
"Pours a clear deep copper color with a frothy/creamy white head that persists forever. Smells of light caramel with an earthy/mineral edge in there as well. A light fruitiness and a hint of prunes and dark sugar round out the aroma for me. Taste is heavy on the malt. Caramel and sugar on top of light fruit and butterscotch. I almost pick up some cherries in there, but they seem to disappear as soon as I look for them. Slight earthy element from the almost non existent hops. Slightly sweet mouthfeel, medium carbonation and body. I think this one is decent, definitely not hoppy enough for my American palette. I would love to one day revisit this one at the source, because I'm not so sure this bottle is anywhere near fresh and with no bottle dating I have no way of knowing."
"D= I dunno what is wrong with this beer. Minerally and sort of unrefined tasting. I won't be buying it again but I would have no problem drinking it again. Just a weird beer."
"Not the best Samuel Smith beer, but still pretty damn good."
"Copper color with a two finger off white head and nice retention. Leaves a nice lace. Smell is hops, some sweet and biscuit malt, and caramel. The taste is sweeter than expected, with the hops and biscuit malt also present. Very smooth and easy to drink. Medium bodied, smooth carbonation, and very easy to drink. I should drink this more often when I want a break from high abv beers."
"Pleasant malt base, caramel plus a slightly toasty pale malt, hint of fruit and grass and summer meadows, slightly metallic, pleasant herbal, grassy hop profile that provides a nice dry 'twang' to the finish, not over the top but certainly there. Nothing too flashy but that's the English style in my mind. Low/medium carbonation adds to the drinkability as well, could easily see myself drinking a couple of these at a pub or with a meal into the evening. Nothing wrong going on here."
"F: A little bitter, but slightly fruity and sweet actually. Pretty pale and a little tangy. A slight juicy hop flavor sticks around with that fruit punch taste. A little bit more of the earthy hop qualities as well."
"Try it. You'll probably like it."
"Very round. Carbonation makes this a creamy ale and very enjoyable to drink! Tasty, full bodied and refreshing as a pale can be. This is what i'm looking for when I talk pale ale and I couldn't think of getting enough of this."
"Another solid beer from Samuel Smiths, but the least preferable of the other two I've had from them (RIS, and Nut Brown). As I've found in their other offerings, as well as several other English styled beers I've had, the smell is much more pronounced than the taste. But with that being said, that's most likely due to the style and not the beer itself, so I still give it a thumbs up."
"Overall, it's a pretty good beer. One that I would recommend to anyone who likes a light beer now and then."
"body isn't quite as pale as it is a slightly copper tinged brown. the body is completely transparent, and the head is a slightly off white orange colour. the nose is dull, a slight aroma of hops at the most. the taste is also quite dull, a touch of hops that leave a long biter aftertaste and a bit of a grainy taste. just kind of a 'meh'. the body has some heft to it and the carbonation is fine."
"A deep copper red body that turns a brilliant ruby when held to the light. Generously topped by a thick, fluffy, off-white cap of foam. The moderately retentive head leaves behind a beautiful lace as it recedes. Aromas of toffee and biscuit with hints of dried fruit, apple, and brown sugar. A very quiet hint of nuts. Tastes a little bit toasty, with notes of caramel, butterscotch, apple, and nuts. Finishes with a leafy, tea-like bitterness. Light-medium bodied with smooth carbonation. Feels slick. A very balanced and easy drinking English pale ale."
"Probably one of the less impressive Sam Smith beers I've tried, but still pretty good. It's a well executed but plain pale ale."
"This is a solid example of an English pale ale and I could see myself drinking more than a few of these quite happily in a single session."
"Flavorful and drinkable. I could put down quite a few of these."
"while I've scored this beer pretty well in every category, I can simply say it's not my cup of tea. personal drinkability doesn't rank all that high for the style."
"Drinkability: Above average EPA that would be a great session beer. I was expecting more though, but I think I like Bitters and ESBs more than EPAs."
"D-This beer is very sessionable. I could drink this beer all night and be goood. I highly suggest this wonderful beer."
"Drink ability: A very good beer that I would love to drink all the time."
"taste is creamy up front, well balanced hops and malts, grain, some caramel, and hops in the back, end is dry and a tad bitter."
"I must admit the Samuel Smiths brewery is a consistent brewer of good beers in my mind that has been for ages and once again im proud to review one of their beers,it pours a copper hue with nice carbonation that leaves a one finger head with really nice sticky lacing all down the glass,it has a subtle aroma for a EPA not much hop aroma to it more of a caramel,toffee,malty smell to it,the mouthfeel starts off nice with a silky medium feel to it and finishes very smooth with a subtle hop caramel finish quite a nice beer thats easy enough to drink."
"Pours a reddish amber with a slight head that settles to a thin cap. Some sweet malt comes through first in the nose, followed by some copper notes that are typical for the style, and some bready notes on the finish. Tastes of classic biscuity malts, copper, crisp with a soft bitterness, bready on the finish. Crisp with late earthy hoppy bitterbess in the mouth. Very pleasant and a classic of the style."
"D- This beer has a smooth clean flavor with a soft hop flavor that is very soft on the bitterness. It is not to exciting with little complexity but I think it has great potential on cask or draft as it is a well built beer."
"This is nothing like a true English Ale."
"Overall, I refuse to drain pour any beer, but if I were to do so, this would be the beer to do it. There was really nothing I enjoyed about this beer and I probably won't have it again. Maybe I got a bad bottle."
"A very good, very tasty pale ale that came close to scoring higher than it did. For me the only negative is an alcohol character that is stronger than most of the style, remembering that this is supposed to be a session beer. Beautifully balanced, I would definitely drink it again."
"Overall: I really liked this beer a lot. Would love to grab this on tap some time. Samuel Smith's has yet to disappoint me. Everything they brew is delicious. I gave it a 5 for drinkability, because I can't think on any situation this beer wouldn't be appropriate for."
"In my opinion, This was an exceptional example of an English pale ale. I loved it. I plan to try more from Samuel Smith."
"Fair balance, not as bitter, malty, or hoppy as some EPAs."
"From the 550 ml. bottle no. SH28C1. Sampled on June 25, 2009. It pours dark amber with medicore clarity but a nearly two fingers of chunky beige head that diminishes in about 30 seconds. The smell is rich of roasted malts, caramel, and sugar. The mouthfeel comes in at about medium and the first sip stays in tact for a few moments on the tongue. The taste is very sweet in roasted malts, sugars, and some light hops holding up the rear. There is a hint of bitterness in it as well. You usually get a decent brew from Samuel Smith's no matter what the style."
"Overall, a decent, slightly above average offering in my book, that satisfies, but doesn't necessarily stimulate."
"not my favorite EPA but definitely not a bad selection."
"Tart, dark cherry syrup. Sexy amber bod with a tight, pillowy cap. Light sweet scent, touch of malt backed up by dry fruity, estery yeast. Tart and zesty, dry, red wine like finish. Light on the belly, light on the ABV, heavy on the historic interpretation. Work of art ring lacing, cyrstl clear, light carbed feel. Thirst quenching with tinge of metal. Nonetheless, a superb bench mark for bottled English ale."
"The mouthfeel is medium full with smooth body and moderate carbonation."
"D: low ABV and good tasting. It's an easy drinker"
"Pours a very nice brown color, nice carbonation, nice two-finger foamy off-white head, nice sticky lacing to follow. The nose is sweet, malty, with some caramel. The taste follows the nose pretty much. Medium body. Drinkable, a nice brew, but I still like the American version better."
"Poured with a light, amber-like color. Not much retention with patchy lacing. Yeasty aromas with hints of sweet berries and malts. The taste was quite dry and clean. Every sip had hints of hops but dissipated quickly. Crisp carbonation. Overall, not too bad."
"55cL bottle. Pours clear dark copper with a large, rocky tan head. Smells of sweet, honey-like malt, slightly floral, earthy notes, and a hint of brown sugar. The taste is again mostly sweet, earthy malt, along with some light hop character. Buttery flavors from diacetyl; they actually add to it though. Medium, smooth body. Nice, mild, flavorful beer."
"This is a good ale, well-balanced and interesting. Too polite and British to offend or excite me."
"A very drinkable brew, well balanced and well made. If it seems a tad on the sweet side at first, it manages to balance itself out by the end."
"Got this as part of a 4 pack gift set. Pours a very shimmery gold and amber with a very white head. Smells of fruit and some light citrus. Bit of unplaced sweetness in there as well. The taste is super clean with the malt sweetness working very well with the clean hop profile. Extremely refreshing. Leaves the mouth slightly dry and wanting another sip. This is one to drink all day."
"like their other offerings this brew is good but not great. Looks good with a hazy copper... 1"" head. The nose is awesome with lots of floral and fruit(citrus and mellon). Probobly the easiest drinker of the sammy brews I've had and they all go down pretty easy. Lacks kick.... wish it delivered the same with the taste as it does with the nose. I'm sure this is traditional and I know it's fine quality... but for the price hand me an American Pale... or somethin with some hop bang which this lacks."
"Pours amber with a thick head. Very good carbonation. Smells ""earthy"" with hop aroma. Taste is toasted malts followed by a very muted floral grassy hop flavor and then a bitterness in the finish. Don't know why, but it reminded me of an herbal tea. Good drinkability and flavor."
"Beer poured an amber-orange with a decent off white head. Nose is toasted biscuity malts and a hint of hop flower. Taste is well balanced with biscuity malts and a pear-apple hop finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, well carbonated, and pretty smooth. Overall drinkability is good. This is a well balanced session pale ale that is a bit spendy but definitely worth trying if you are a English pale ale fan."
"D- Very drinkable, nice alcohol content, makes this one a great ""session"" ale...although not for the price...I like this beer, but will probably continue to drink on a pretty infrequent basis...I do like this beer though..."
"This beer pours a hefty shade of pale orange to amber with a finger's worth of solid, slightly off-white head. The head does dissipate to a scamp covering after several slugs but continuous to leave some nice lacing. Nose is more malty than hopy unlike many of its American cousins. Taste is also on the malty side and actually quite refreshing given all the crazy over the top hop beers around. Additional flavors include light caramel and some faint toasty notes - almost like an amber. Body is medium light and the carbonation level is relatively high. Overall this is a great beer that I will be having again."
"Very nice, easy to session ale."
"Overall, I'm quite impressed once again with Samuel Smith's beers. This one was perfect for this spring Sunday afternoon."
"Highly drinkable. While not the best offering from Sam Smith, this is a solid brew, and one I come back to every few months or so. Always reliably tasty."
"D: Another really nice Samuel Smith offering. Refined to a T and very drinkable. Not there most impressive offering, but still an excellent example of the style."
"Very drinkable and solid English Ale. I would consider it a benchmark English pale."
"Average drinkability I guess. I'm not much on the style and the English brews always seem to have a rum candy or brandy flavor to them that I find a bit off"
"d: the beer is very mellow and light and very english standard in terms of all of its parts except the overcarbing. I think this is a good drinkable beer that is perhaps more than the sum of its parts in its classic drinkability, but it may be a little boring for some (like me)"
"D- Excellent. Perfect balance, I could could drink quite a few of these."
"D: Solid. Easy-drinking."
"Drinkability- Medium to high. Excellent pale ale, not too much alcohol, sweet buttery flavor could be overpowering after a few."
"I was a bit underwhelmed by this beer at first, perhaps because I've become somewhat jaded on the hop monsters in the U.S.A. However, it grew on me as I drank it, and as I realized what it was supposed to be: a good solid English pub ale. Makes me wish I had some fish and chips to go with it."
"Boy, I am NOT an English ale kinda guy, but damn is this good. Scent is the only thing holding this one back. Smell is a bit light and kinda metallic. Great pour, excellent head retention. Tracing on the glass. Tastes terrific, of toffee and is creamy and very nutty. Really nice flavors in the beer, shoot all around the palate. Nice hop balance on the back end. Great session brew. Way tooo expensive. A fair price for this beer may be $11 bucks a sixer but it is that for only four. If it were affordable, Old Brewery Ale would be in my fridge daily!"
"D - This is a very drinkable beer with a balanced flavor and low ABV. Perfect for downing a few pints or enjoying with a meal."
"Pours a clear brown colored body, with a white-brownish colored head, average to small in size. Has a malty aroma, with some honey. Malty effervescent, honey taste. Fresh tasting. Lots of honey aftertaste. Nice session beer."
"Overall, I wasn't really impressed by this and have had better English Pales. Still, it's not a bad beer, just not worth the cost."
"D- An outstanding pale ale with nice layers. Eternally drinkable."
"drinkability is good. nicely balanced, hiding its alcohol very well. a solid and tasty english pale."
"Overall; decent."
"Drinkability- A very nice English Pale Ale. Would have liked a little more of a hoppy aspect though."
"D- A tad on the expensive side, though it is quite a good representation of an English Pale Ale."
"Mouthfeel is great, lightly carbonated with a light-medium body. Drinkability is also great. Goes down smooth, an easy drinker with plenty of complexity to sit back and enjoy. A bit pricey, but save some pennies and buy a pair of bottles for a lazy evening."
"Pours a beautiful clear dark amber with a nice foamy white head that lasts, moderate lacing. This one looks nice. The first sip, and I'm very impressed. Smooth, light carbonation, a fantastic blend of malt and a hint of bitterness, with a little nut flavor and very smooth and highly drinkable. I am blown away by this. I'm not too familiar with the style, but I'm definitely going to have to seek out similar beers because this is very enjoyable."
"I tend to prefer the doughy breadlike epa's with a hint of butteriness and this a malty explosion of sugar but i still enjoyed it. I was reminded of a shitty bass or a nasty old speckled hen but good. I would definitely get this again if i had some appropriate food to pair with it."
"Silky smooth mouthfeel and a light round sweetness with good bittering. This is a nice light beer with a medium richness that is satisfying. Not too complex but leaves a good taste on the palate."
"Overall, very drinkable, but could use a little more hops in it."
"This beer is a great beer on it's own .A better I.P.A. A sweet taste, it will give you the incentive to come back for more."
"Pours a clear copper color with a large white head that hangs around for awhile. The head eventually settles to a thin cap but plenty of lacing is left in its wake. The aroma is full of floral and earthy hops. Wonderful English hops. The flavor likewise is full of English hops balanced by biscuit and caramel malt flavors. Bitterness is fairly low for having this much hop flavor. The body is a little thin and the carbonation is fizzy. About the only thing I can complain about in this beer. I was hesitant about this beer because bottled English Ales do not hold their flavor for long. After being assured about the freshness of the bottle, I pulled the trigger and brought it home. Glad I did. Find a fresh bottle and bring one home with you."
"This is a great beer. I could drink a lot of it."
"Pours a slightly cloudy amber color. Good 3/4 inch head of an off-white color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of malt and hops. Fits the style quite nicely. The bitterness is the first sense; chewy, smooth, average carbonation. Tastes of hops first, with a strong malt background. Overall, one of the better English Pale Ale's I've ever had - worth a try."
"Taste follows the nose with the caramel and orange/honey on moderately lingering finish. A long lasting and effervescent carbonation yields an easy drinking ale with a moderate body for the style, yet without what might be an anticipated sweetness given that body."
"Notes: A solid pale ale in the English style, exactly as advertised. I will always give high marks for beers that deliver on what is promised."
"Pours a solid burnt orange with a thick, quickly simmering head that flattens out evenly to an off-white ring--a steady stream of effervescence accompanies... bright, fragrant aroma that boasts fresh hops, doughy yeast and sweet malts--a well-balanced scent... soft, smooth vivacious approach with a tickling presence on the teeth--medium to full-bodied, almost demands like an IPA in its heft... first and foremost, punchy hops; last yet least, hearty malts--a crisp, clean and sweet balance that does not usually occur on American soil... not surprisingly, another stud for the Samuel Smith stable...pairing this would be a joyous endeavor... in a pleasant war with Sierra Nevada to be the plae ale I sip in heaven (God willing!)"
"Overall I thought this was a great beer. It was much better than other English Pale Ales I have had, such as Bass. It is a great session beer that goes down smooth and easy. Truly a top notch brew, if you have the means I highly recommend picking some up."
"Pours a clear light coppery orange, thin big bubbled off white head forms, quickly settles down to a thin collar, not really any lacing, looks okay. Smell is malty, quite sweet and bready, some caramel, biscuits, brown sugar, light raisin, some fruit, not too bad. Taste is similar, light flavour, bit of caramel and raisin, quite toasty, a bit of fruit, light floral hopping, nutty in the finish, weak and watery. Mouthfeel is light bodied with low to medium carbonation, goes down like water. I really remember this one being quite a bit better, weak watery pale ale."
"Nose in the bottle leads to a really odd, funky smell at first- like stinky feet. After the pour it opens up and smells a bit more of sour hops. Still not a great smell... reminds me of sour dog piss, no kidding. Nice bronze color to it, though. As long as I keep my nose away I can easily handle it- some good bitter, a bit sour hops. Sam Smith loves their ESB, and they do them well. This is an enjoyable beer but not a pale ale in the least. A bit tart, very malty. Average mouthfeel- what I expected. Another good brew from Samuel Smiths. I'm becoming an enormous Samuel Smiths fan, these are some high quality brews for no more than $3. Thumbs up."
"D - This, like all the other Samuel Smith products, is spot on. Nothing big or adventurous, but true to the original style and reasonably priced."
"Another well constructed and subtle beverage from Samuel Smith's. Don't pass this one by."
"Overall: I'd rate this as a very solid Pale Ale. Another great effort by Samuel Smith's."
"Pours a crystal clear copper color with an average off-white head that dissipated into a slight cap. The aroma is extraordinarily faint, I cannot pick up anything. The taste is of a slightly sweet caramel malt, not too buttery, and a subtle tea like hop and some white grape sweetness. Not very flavorful but I appreciate that it is not very buttery or metallic. The feel is clean and crisp, not odd flavors or bitterness getting in the way here. Samuel Smith delivers another highly sessionable brew. I could easily knock back several of these."
"Great aroma right after pouring. Oh man, I'm getting fresh apple with frosting, oak, French bread and hops spice. The flavor has almost a mild barleywine/old ale malt profile with a dry hit of sugar cookie and soupy caramel. It finishes with a long, moderate strength, slightly grassy, peppercone hops note. Delicious and drinkable. Get this beer."
"Poured with a rather loose tan head, the aroma of malty sweetness was subdued and pleasant, with hints of bread and perhaps some nicely toasted white bread. The body was rather light, and although I anticipated more robust flavor I found the taste to be rather undistinguished. Carbonation was somewhat flat; a bit more would have added some more oomph to the body. As offerings from Samuel Smith go, this one was good but not great, like so many of their other beers."
"This beer has a brown body with a full tan head that sticks around almost the whole time it is in the glass. The lace on the other hand disappears quickly. It has mild malty aroma which is different for a pale ale there is a metallic hop aroma in the background. The taste is also malty and not really as bitter as we are used to on this side of the pond but it is still a great beer. It has medium mouthfeel and the right amount of carbonation."
"Nothing wrong with this beer, its a little toned down compared to some American pale ales around but honestly this is textbook right here. Nothing but good things to say."
"D: Very drinkable beer as all of the flavors blended well and it has a nice feel to it. This is a very good beer."
"A light beige head, foamy and tightly-bubbled, capped an orange-red body. I loved the smooth creaminess and the beer was carbonated exactly to my liking."
"a solid brew but not something i buy much of even though it is availible in my area."
"Samuel Smith's Old Brewery Pale Ale pours a light copper color with a tan head from a brown half liter bottle. The aroma is malty. The flavor is dominated by malt, caramel being the lead taste, and a bit fruity and buttery too. Hops are minimal, but this is a very good English pale ale nonetheless."
"Although this particular bottle may (or may not) have been a little off, I still think really highly of Samuel Smith. They do a great job at producing a range of styles and most importantly, their beers make a great starting place for those looking to expand their palate."
"Pours a golden amber with a big tan head. Smells of raisins and an English Yeast strain. Taste is malty, a bit woody, with a fruity layer as well. There is a toasty biscuit flavor, with a hint of earthy hops in the finish. Bitterness levels help balance the brew. Mouthfeel is good, carbonation levels somewhat high. Quite drinkable, this is a good British Ale that I plan to have again."
"Medium body, fair carbonation. A drinkable pale ale for sure. I find it a little on the mild side. Very smooth, with no bold distinctive flavors. Very well crafted and balanced."
"Poured with a nice head and a bit of lace. Clear dark amber color. Malty hoppy aroma. Great flavor with very interesting English hops going on. Plenty of malt to balance. Excellent beer. Decent finish. Easy session beer. Pale ale in name but similar to a special bitter."
"Caramel malt hits first on the palate and is balanced very well by the hops. Finishes with a bready malt. Very drinkable with a great flavor and balance. Great session beer."
"D: This beer wasn't exactly like other pale ales I've had before - there was much more malt in this one. Not a bad beer, but not my favorite."
"I wanted to rate this now, even though it maybe be skewed by a bad beer. Will re-rate."
"Pretty good beer but not as good as some of their others. The color is a little darker than most Pale Ales I've tried. It does have a nice foamy tan head and a lot of lace on the glass. The aroma is mild, I just didn't get a whole lot. Malty and spicy flavors with a hoppy, fruity finish. Decent EPA."
"An English style pale as opposed to an IPA thus showing less hops and a deeper character. Pours beautifully, frothy cream-colored head comprised of small bubbles that form a nice cap. Good retention and lacing, quality already. Malty nose reflects the forward malt flavors followed by a quick, dry hop finish. Clean. Medium body, nice mouthfeel, true amber color. Delightful. A great example of what a beer can be and what an English Pale should be."
"overall big hit. I'll pick up a stack."
"D - Love the mouthfeel... Slick and enjoyable... Nothing is overboard, but still a very well crafted brew... Slightly more hops would make this brew a homerun..."
"D= This was a very good English pale ale. I drank this an hour or so after drinking (and reviewing) the Fuller's London Pride, and I have to say it takes second seat to the Fullers. That said though, this is a great beer in its own right and proves again that Samuel Smith's knows what they are doing."
"Overall, Daddy likes it."
"Nice and if I was in a pub 'over there' I certainly could have more than one, but I found something about it that was slightly off compared to other EPA's i've tried."
"D - Hits all the right spots for what it's supposed to be. Not a beer that will blow your mind but rather a good quality & quite tasty sessioner."
"D - Pretty good. A classic English pale ale. I might have again, but I doubt it. It isn't really my style."
"Pours a clear copper with creamy head. Smell: candied fruit, buttery, hint of earthy hops. Taste: sweet malts upfront, fruit, biscuity, followed by earthy slightly spicy hops. Grain and bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel: smooth with soft carbonation, sticky finish. Well-balanced tasty pale ale, sessionable too."
"D- This isn't a chugging beer! I'd probably have a couple of pints before getting filled up. Lots of flavor and a great texture contribute to me recommending this to anyone who wants to drink what I consider a very good version of this style. I will definately pick up more of this when I get the chance again."
"Poured from a bottle into half-pint glasses."
"D - Low abv and great flavor make this an easy beer to drink"
"This is a true English Ale, a session beer for anyone."
"All in all a wonderfully drinkable English pale; does everything right & nothing wrong. I'll have another, please..."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, mild kick, very good representation of style, it's a little sweeter than I've seen in most EPA's but it's a nice beer to drink for a long time."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. The tight lacey white foam head is creamy in texture. The color is light copper/amber. Carbonation is pronounced. The aroma is of garden variety english hops. The taste is a splash of clean bitterness and a carmel, buttery costing of the mouth. The body is ideal for a pale ale and it is a session brew that could go on for the entire night."
"Everything here is in fine and subtle balance, with a toasted bread-like malt and a spicy, tart English hop flavor. Crisp, clean, and toned. A light citrus hop buzzes through the brew as well. Delightful from beginning to end. Mouthfeel is well carbonated. I could truly drink this all day, the consummate English pale ale. If there is a finer brewery in England, I know not of it."
"Smooth and medium-bodied; mild, crisp, and nicely carbonated. Superb drinkability."
"D,notes: Appropriately bitter with a reasonable amount of malt backing. Smooth and fluffy mouthfeel adds to drinkability. Obviously a very good session beer."
"Very easy drinking and nicely balanced. A fine session ale that is more complex than is first apparent."
"The taste is fairly rich and full-bodied with earthy and very leafy malt, light toasted quality, excellent sweet-bitter balance, a hint of sourness, with a nice long, slightly bitter finish of nutty grain and leafy hops."
"A fairly poor representation of a pale ale if you ask me, but a tasty beer nonetheless. The hops don't shine through at all, one of the hallmarks of the style, and the malts are far too dark to constitute ""pale."" The beer is on point, but like their India Ale, I feel the name is a misnomer."
"D: this is a very enjoyable PAle ale, I could drink this one a while."
"D-Easy to drink i could see having a few very easily."
"D: This is a very drinkable session ale. The hoppy finish beckons you to drink more, but it's not overpowering at all. This is a really refreshing pale ale. Yet another wonderful offering from the Tadcaster brewery. This is one hell of a refreshing and tasty pale ale."
"Overall a very decent beer but a little disappointing as I was hoping for more."
"Overall: A weaker IPA, left me wanting alittle more."
"Pours a good clear amber orange brown with good fizzy off white head that dissipates fairly quick. Nose is appley as hell with a bit of a coppery smell. Taste is nice and complex, but simple enough to session quite easily. Maltiness is most noticeable with a good kiss of english hops on the finish. An overall smooth flavor with a bit of apple flavor, some very smooth earthy malts, but not overpowering or too sweet. A nice dry finish is graced with some slight hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is quite good, Drinkability is about as good as it gets. This is one of my all time favorite session brews for summertime at the cabin. I absolutely love this brew for session drinking, or even to enjoy just one. I think when my tax returns arrive I will stock my fridge with these. Great brew."
"O- A decent pale ale, particularly good when paired with food."
"This pale ale is a deep amber colored brew with a modest white head and similar lace. It brings a very mild caramel aroma, some brown sugar, but pretty weak. The taste is nutty with charcoal and caramel with mild floral dry hops. Hops and brown sugar become most prominent as you work your way through the glass. It's reasonably drinkable but pretty dry overall. Based on my experience with most Sam Smith's stuff, I expected this would wow me more than it did, but it is certainly a good ale and one you should try for yourself."
"Verdict: Drinkable and smooth. Not much else. Classic pale ale here. It would taste better fresh but because I can't decipher the production codes, I have no clue."
"The pour was straight out of the bottle into a Samuel Smith Pint Glass. It was a copper orange with a thick three finger white/tan head. Honey, citrus, and hops were all present in the smell. It had a good blend of malts, spices, honey, citrus, and hops in the taste. The mouthfeel was smooth and it was a very easy beer to drink."
"This poured a clear, light amber with nice off-white head. It smelled like hazelnut and malt with a bit of orange hops. It tasted very much like it smelled - nutty and malty with some subtle hops. It was smooth and semi-thick with no carbonation and a slightly bitter aftertaste. Overall this was a different sort of pale ale, not quite as dark as a brown ale, but pretty good."
"A good beer here. Copper red and clear in the glass. Great hints of malt and caramel in the nose. Blonde frothy head with lots of lace. A good dry finish yet it is mellow. Mouthfeel was satisfying. Nice warm hops flavour with a generous bitters yet not overwhelming."
"What a standard, great on the nose, light balanced flavors with a mouthfeel leaning on the lighter side. A highly drinkable brew."
"I enjoyed this beer. A nice malt and hop presents on the tongue and nose that makes for a very well balanced beer."
"Crystal clear amber color with a big thick head. Retention is insane, with a half-inch cap lasting the duration. Leaves lots of sticky lacing. Aroma is a bit typical, with sweet maltiness and mild fruitiness. Flavor is mostly toffee and caramel, maybe some diacetyl. Hops are all but undetectable. A little tannic bitterness comes out in the finish. Dry, and smooth with a medium-light body. Really easy to drink, but not really as robust as I like my pales."
"D - This is a very good EPA I think one of the best that I've had I would recommend this beer to my friends very enjoyable"
"Overall a very impressive beer. The taste was super and I could definitely drink a bunch of these, though they are definitely not a pounding beer. Dont pass-up the chance to try this one. I have not been let down by any ofSamuel Smith's beers."
"Overall, I forget about the Samuel Smith brews because I always seem to have access to the main stable... I really should pick these up more often and I definitely will next time I am going to try and brew anything with an English profile."
"mouthfeel is ok, but over carbonated for me, I could have a couple of these they just really seem plain, but not even that good."
"This was a very drinkable pale ale and was of a very high quality. It had good balance and a nice ABV which give it good drinkability. Great beer!"
"Pairs well with spicy food. This would definatly qualify as a top notch session beer."
"Very nice brew, easy to drink."
"D: Definitely a drinkable brew. Excellent combination of taste and mouthfeel. Definitely worth a try if you can get your hands on it."
"As an APA - mediocre to bad. EPA - pretty darn good."
"D - Very good as an occational beer, but not an everyday choice."
"Not nearly at the same level as the organic ale, but this is still worth a look. For the optimal experience, give it some time to warm up."
"D - Not bad at all, a finely crafted sessionable brew that seems perfect to take the edge off after a hard day's work. I could see this as being a reliable fallback beer and one to have in stock. Reco!"
"This is what I would call a mellow pale ale. There is none of the in-your-face hop that is common in the American versions of pale ales."
"D- Easy drinking, this could be a nice everyday beer"
"Poured into a pint glass and received a one-finger head that stuck around due to carbonation. A mix between between copper and oragne is how I would describe the light, seethru body. A strong smell eminates, giving off a strong hop presence but also underlined by a small malt and bread presence with a hint og citrus. The beer has a ryeish, dry hop taste that contains earthy tones and is not very complex but good. Balanced out by the malts for a refreshing, smooth ale that keeps you wanting more. I wouldn't session this beer, one or two is fine and perhaps I was a overly critical since I know Samuel Smith makes better beers."
"Pours a hazy orange-ish/ yellow color with a small light tan head. In the aroma, sweet and somewhat buttery. In the taste, a small hop and fruity, like pears. A bitter mouthfeel and a semi dry fruity pear aftertaste. Smooth and easy, and interesting fruity pear taste."
"It's fine pale ale, a little shy on flavor for me, but smooth and finely crafted as all Samuel Smith beers are. Well worth the purchase."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a pleasing aftertaste. This is a very drinkable beer - one to find if you love a good English Pale Ale."
"Anyone know of any clone recipes?"
"Very good beer."
"Bottle from the LCBO. Split with the missus, and accompanied by roast beef and yorkshire puddings. Complimented the dinner perfectly. Pours a dark amber, with a good muddied white head. The aroma of hops and malt is continued in the flavour, and replaced with a nutty finish. There is a nice mild hoppy bitterness to this brew."
"Drinkabilty is ok, I don't care for the tinny, grassy taste, but it's pretty light and easy drinking. Nice to see they dropped the clear glass and started using brown bottles."
"D - To me this is the epitome of what a Pale Ale should be...I could literally drink this all night long..at 5% it's the perfect session brew and it's taste is satisfying and left me wanting more...I was bummed when I finished it and didn't have any more to go...I will be making this a regular place in my weekly beer stock"
"Not overly sweet and not overly hoppy (although herbal), not overly anything to be special for a pale ale. Beer has a good amount of carbonation though and is quite smooth and buttery which helps."
"D: This is a true session beer if I ever had one. Could down plenty of these."
"The third brew from this company and I have yet to be dissapointed... top quality from all their products, and this pale ale goes above and beyond... the appearance was great... a ruby-red slightly brownish color that frothed with a nice head... smell was full of malts and caramel, and the taste was creamy, slightly bready with a nice hint of malts, caramel, butter, and a slight vanilla after-taste... the mouthfeel and drinkability were exceptional.. the beer went down so easily and had no bitter traces at all... Copped a 550 ml bottle that came in a Samuel Smith gift set that included a nice pint glass... I will definitely purchase this beer again and its quality has made me eager to sample more brews from this outstanding company... Definitely recommended..."
"D - This is an okay beer. It just isn't something I'd run out a buy every week."
"this is a very drinkable brew. well balanced and bold in flavor, this one is another great from Samuel Smith. cheers!"
"D - Good beer. Wish it was a little more complex and fuller bodied."
"D = I give this high drinkability. It has a very distinctive taste, while still being firmly a representative English Pale Ale. If it weren't somewhat expensive, I could easily make this my standard beer to always have on hand for guests and myself."
"English session ale, you could toss a few back, I'm sure it would be a beauty from the cask. A good example of my favourite style, a balanced, malt focused pale ale."
" This is Pale ale English style!"
"Overall: This being my second English pale this seemed like the hops were lacking but that could be my American pales skewing my palate. It was very drinkable and wouldn't mind have a couple more...."
"Sorry limies. We do it better. ;-)"
"d - easily quaffed and a nice session brew."
"D: Goes down smoother than other pale ale's I've tried. No problem finishing this one. My girlfriend even stole some from me - and she doesn't usually like beer!"
"Big fan of this beer. It's a nice hefty beer with ample flavor."
"A nice bronze color -- kind of dark for the style, but attractive -- with a thin head that left thin lacing all the way down. Very subtle aromas, but I love it -- rich malts (toasty caramel), grassy hops, peat? The malt dominates the flavor, as I understand an English pale ale should, but it's fairly mild regardless. I think some spiciness might liven it up a bit. An earthy, simple pale ale, but well crafted, as I'd expect from Sammy Smith."
"D- totally dude this is like winter welcome with hops substituted for the spiciness."
"Tasty, satisfying brew."
"Poured amber and clear, presented a copper hue in the glass. Modest half finger tan head with good carbonation. Smell of all spice, fruit zest, hops. Taste of orange rind, hops again, bitter but with a slightly sour finish. Sharp, dry texture, mouthfull of spiced apple and some oak showing but I thought the overall experience was slightly less than I expected from the appearance and fragrance."
"D: Very high."
"Clear red/copper with a nice persistant off white head. Smell is carmel and toasted malt. Taste is light toasted malt with a carmel note. Some herbal hops. Just a touch of bitterness. Nice bready carmel aftertaste. Very british tasting pale ale (obviously). Mouthfeel is medium, maybe a bit on the light side. Really nice for this beer. Very drinkable and a very nice pale ale overall. I'd like to find this on tap."
"Drinkability: Very sessionable at 5%. This large pint went pretty quickly for me. I'll probably pick this one up again sometime in the future for it's uniquely sweet and balanced flavor."
"Appearance is a rich amber with a nice creamy head. Aroma of sweet malts and hops. Taste: roasted malts, nutty, lightly sweet and a slight grassy note having a good amount of hop and carbonation making it crisp and refreshing, but still lacking something. Mouthfeel is light - medium that goes down smooth, I should try more of these British PA's, a good one to try."
"Flavor is a solid pleasant malt base and interesting floral herbal hoppiness that is very subtle (compared to our American Pale Ales) and quite interesting. A bit of black pepper in the generally mild hops. I obviously missed all of this the first time. Now it is quite enjoyable, just not over the top. A good sipper!"
"White head didnt hang around too long. Nice lacing. Aroma is a bit caramelly and fruity. A roasty maltiness is the dominating character of the flavor with hints of fruit. Very balanced flavor. Mouthfeel is medium. Very drinkable beer with low amount of carbonation."
"Overall impression: Nicely balanced and highly drinkable."
"550ml brown bottle from Lou's in Augusta. Red-copper translucent body with around an inch of initial off-white head that dissipates rather quickly. Smells caramelly and fruity, with hints if a peaty quality. A roasty maltiness dominates the flavor with hints of fruit, diacetyl (coming through as a very pleasing butterscotch flavor). No one quality of the flavor overpowers another I would say. A nice balance and a medium-bodied mouthfeel make this extremely drinkable. Definitely glad I finally tried it, and I'm sure the brown bottle helped the flavor. A new favorite!"
"This is one of the best session beers in a bottle ever! It's not the greatest ale ever brewed, but it's just really drinkable and tasty. From brown body, solid head with decent lacing, great mix of hops and malts with a touch a yeasty goodness, which spreads across the tongue and touches nearly every tastebud, this one from Sam Smith's goes down smooth and easy...again and again!"
"D- an easy drinking ale that goes well with any food pairing or very quaffable all on its own"
"A nice head forms when poured and lasts till the end. Lacing is well distributed. The aroma is hard to pick up on, caramel, some fruits and the hops are barely noticeable. Very clean and refreshing on my young palate has some creamy toffee/caramel notes. Not much on the hop scale but an extremely balanced delight."
"D: Goes down ok, but it's not special enough to make me want a lot of them. A nice changeup, but that's about it."
"The mouthfeel could set a good standard for the style. Active carbonation and a smooth but light body make for an easy drinker. I could easily imagine sitting in a pub somewhere and sessioning this brew. Better than I remember it being."
"Overall, it's not the greatest English Pale Ale that I've ever had. It was alright though, not a bad Beer either. Probably one of the highest levels of diacetyl that I have been able to detect in a Beer, it is very obvious."
"Drinkability: This is nice, but not my favorite. Certainly an easy drinker, but it could be even more so if it were a little bit more interesting and/or a bit cleaner."
"Drinkability: A humdrum offering from Samuel Smith's Old Brewery that really pales in comparison to their Imperial Stout, Oatmeal Stout, Taddy Porter, and Nut Brown Ale. Ah well."
"A very drinkable beer."
"This beer has grown on me as I reach the bottom of the glass. I wouldn't mind trying this again. Nice brew."
"The mouthfeel and drinkability, though, are excellent. This would make a great sippin' brew, being that it is very light bodied and it's not an all out assault on the senses."
"D: It is so mild that I could pound 3 to 4 in any given time. I'm just a tad dissapointed with this one because overall, the companies brews are pretty good."
"very good beer, a little different than american pale ales, and should not be compared(obviously since this is an english pale ale) but it fits the profile extremely well. very enjoyable"
"I haven't had a Sam Smith in awhile and almost forgot how enjoyable it truly is. This is a pale ale worthy of name. The color is a nice copper, decent sized head, good carbonation and retention of both head and carbonation. The smell is very good, a little on the malty sweetish side, very enticing. The taste is excellent. This is a British pale ale! Medium bodied, a little on the dry side, malty, a little sweet in the middle, very subdued bitterness, no after bite at all. Very drinkable. I won't wait so long this timeto have my next one. L'Chaim."
"This beer pours a very thick and beautiful head. It has a light copper color. This is a very smooth beer with a clean aftertaste. The aroma is similar to the nut brown ale. This is a very drinkable beer due to the clean aftertaste. Follow this beer with a stout or the brown ale."
"Overall - Another excellent brew from Samuel Smiths... so drinkable and thirst quenching... recommended...."
"D  Easy drinker, with subtle flavours. Well worth a try."
"Poured from a brown 16.9oz bottle. The appearance was a beautiful amber/orange crystal clear with a generous white soft fluffy head. Taste was sweet with toffee, and slight hops to balance it. It was more tilted toward the malt side though. Carbonation was moderate and mouthfeel was light."
"Flavor is of roasted nuts, biscuits, acidic hops."
"A good friend of mine shared his bottle of this with me. Pours a slightly hazy caramel color, with a thin, tan head. Pretty good retention. Smells of sweet caramel, toffee, bourbon, and toasted grain. Touch of the alcohol as it warms. Taste starts out small, but it's growing on me. Light and sweet flavors of the toasted grains. A touch of bitterness in the aftertaste, then a nice, grainy finish. Light-to-medium mouthfeel completes the simplicity of the beer. Very easily drinkable, nice introduction to the style. Would gladly reach for another!"
"A bitterness seemed to linger in my mouth for longer than I would have liked after each drink. But I cannot argue that it goes down fairly smooth. A beer that I would drink again would I have the chance but I have the feeling that there is probably better out there."
"Drinkability: Not a bad session English Pale Ale. Perhaps curiously for an American beer drinker, I think I prefer this to their IPA - I find the diacetyl lower in this one, and maybe just as bitter."
"D - Good drinkability. Another solid Sam Smith's."
"D - A very good beer with a complicated flavor, very drinkable, only minus is the carbonation's a little high for me"
"Pours out exactly what I imagine when I think of a pale ale. Copper body, off-white, fluffy, head that clings to the glass leaving beautiful lacing. Aroma is malty, bready, nutty, slightly buttery, herbal, toasty. Flavor starts off rather malty and bready, leading into an herbal hops middle, which then finishes toasty, bitter, and dry. Maybe a little too dry for me, but this is a delicious one. Mouthfeel is very good, but the carbonation could be a little more mellow in the tongue and the body could use a little more beefing up as it kind of sweeps off the palate a LITTLE watery. Great session."
"Overall, quite a tasty beer, and a bit different from other English pale ales that I've had. Nothing spectacular, but definitely a solid and enjoyable beer that I'd be more than happy to have again."
"The beverage is altogether smooth and easy to drink. I feel that I've just imbibed an authentic English brew for sure."
"The note was a bit thinner and more vague than I anticipated, but the flavor won me over with a bold but subtle blending of good things from England. It's easily as drinkable as one could hope for, with one leaving the urge for another in its wake. This is a testament to a classic style, one that came before ""extreme"" was the hot trend. And while I do love extreme, sometimes a little pat is more in line than a big smack."
"Final Statement: A bit of a dissapointment for me. As a pale ale fiend, I was excited about this one. Hop presence was minimal, tasted somewhat astringent. I should note that I am a hophead, and the lack of hop character in this beer made me pretty dissapointed. I was a bit harder on this Ale because they have a big reputation, however, It was not bad. It was worth a try."
"[ serving type: bottle ]"
"Old brewery pale ale pours a beautiful deep red copper with a slight white head which laces a bit. The smell is a bit week but I can dectect low levels of bready malts, light malts and floral hops. The taste is classic pale ale light maltiness with a fair bit of floral hops. The finish is dry with no aftertaste. The mouthfeel is good for a pale ale, good levels of carbonation with a body that is light enough to make drinking enjoyable. On to drinkability this is really hard to top, this is a very solid pale ale."
"This is a good example of the style, in my mind, and while not a superb beer, a very easy drink after a long day. And, in a brown bottle no less! So refreshing to see Sammy Smith finally switch, would that they had done so years sooner."
"This beer is pretty much everything that an English pale ale should be and a few American pale ales should also take notes from this fine beer."
"Pours brown with tan head, leaves some lacing. Aroma is sweet and bread like malts. Malty sweetness, along with some fruitiness. Kind of a buttery flavor, there must be a lot as I rarely detect diactlyl. Noticeable hop bitterness in the finish. Medium bodied. Overall, an enjoyable beer."
"A classic English-style ale, the subtleties and craftsmanship apparent in this ale are welcome at any time. Expecting it to be a hop bomb will lead to disappointment, and is a great disservice to a stellar ale. Take it for what it is trying to be, and one can't fail to appreciate what the brewers at Sam Smith's achieve with virtually every single one of their brews."
"Hurrah for the brown bottle. Pours a clear copper with a big ole head. Aroma is buttery and metallic with faint lemony notes. Flavour is roasted grain, clean lemony hops, with lingering mild bitter aftertaste. Dry, refreshing, and easy to drink, this is a classic EPA, and most certainly sessionable."
"Poors a rich brwon with a small creamy head which quickly disappears. Color is wonderful. Some lace present. Smell is a classic english ale smell. More malt then hops. Not much hops on the taste, all malt on this one. Very smooth going down, no real after taste to seak of, but again very smooth and drinkable. Would drink this again, not a goto kinda of drink, but would turn it down if served."
"An above average beer. Would go great with Greek cuisine involving lamb. If this is a style that appeals to you then you need to try this one yourself."
"Pretty much your standard English Pale Ale with buttery notes and light balancing hops. Pretty much your typical session beer. Recommended."
"The beer pours a dark orange with a tan head. The aroma is fairly malty with a hint of chocolate malt. Very little hop aroma. The flavor is also malty, with toffee and burnt malt flavors dominating. Medium body with little carbonation. Overall it's ok, a little light on the hops for me."
"Pours a hazed red-copper with an off-white one and a half finger head. Shows good retention but leaves minimal spotty lacing. A fruity, toasted pale malt nose with crystal malt, faint diacetyl and weak english hop aromas. Initial pale malt sweetness, caramel, and toasted notes are met by an assertive sugarplum fruitiness and butterscotch flavor. Semi-dry aftertaste, mild fuggle or E. Kent hop flavor and subdued bitterness keep the taste on the sweeter side. Medium in body, with a comfortable hard-water texture that never quite becomes cloying. Medium-high carbonation aids in keeping the mouthfeel crisp and not slick. There are an abundance of flavors here, but it finishes remarkably soft and drinkable. Probably one of the best examples of the English style Pale Ale commercially available."
"Dits good and worth the try. Id have it again for sure."
"Another winner from a brewery that does not disappoint."
"This beer poured and orange  brown cloudy color with a thick head (darkest pale ale Ive seen). The smell is slightly sweet and nutty. The taste is bitter and nutty..very well balanced for a Pale Ale. The mouthfeel is full. This beer is smooth and drinkable."
"Having given all those praises, I still like American Pale Ales better!"
"This is a fine example of a classic English Pale Ale. Mild, yet tasty, smooth and drinkable."
"another classic from Samuel Smith ...."
"After passing this beer by for close to two decades i am taking the plunge. It pours a nice solid copper hue, Quickly a nice white head develops leaving nice lacing down the sides of my Samuel Smith pint glass. Its nice to take a trip back to where it started. A nice hoppy aroma preceeds a nice malty taste with a pleasant smack of hops. Not a double anything but it doesnt need to be, a very solid pleasant beer that should be distributed in a more economical manner. I am a fan none the less."
"Pours an deep amber color with good head and lacing. Smells slightly floral with hops up front. The ale is medium-bodied with some strong hop flavors and slightly creamy and buttery. It's very balanced and some of the beer snobs on here might think it's a little uninteresting, but I found it very refreshing. This is a great brew and one I will be coming back to."
"Medium body with a clean finish and a moderately low ABV, give this Pale a sessionable, easy too drink quality. Cheers."
"Pours a nice deep dark copper, amber hue. Head is abundant (almost excessive with an aggressive pour) at first but within time reduces into a nice thick layer on which a coin could be floated upon. Smell, where is it? For such a nice beer the nose is weak but the scents are pleasant. Spice and pine nut. Very tasty and drinkable English ale."
"This is not a bad brew, but it is certainly not great either. Shipping this in brown bottles would certainly help this brew immensely. Still I am perfectly happy sipping an Imperial pint of this brew. While some flavors may be too much, or others lacking, this beer really struck a nice balance between the hoppy bitterness and the multifaceted malt character; it is something the English seem to do well, even in a beer like this."
"Overall this is an average pale ale, in my opinion. While it has a fantastic appearance, everything else is only slightly above average (for microbrews)."
"I personally like a beer to grab me by the balls and beg for attention, and this one is really just not catching my interest. There is nothing bad about this one, but there isn't enough going on to really burn it into my memory. If you ask me what this beer is like a month from now, It will have passed from all memory and just be remembered as a decent pale ale. A really good thing about it though is that It might be a good ale to recomend to those just starting to make the cross-over from the macro world. It's not too intimidating, but for me that's not a good thing. Intimidate me...please!"
"Drinkability: Could knock a few of these back."
"Light-medium bodied. Not too good, not too bad, but definitely not as good as some other brews I've had from Samuel Smith's. Worth a try."
"Drinkability: All in all, I found this a very average and unremarkable pale. It is wicked easy to drink, even with the sour finish. All in all, I can suggest this as a session beer but would go for a pale with a bit more to distinguish it from the pack."
"If you are not fimiliar with English Pale Ales this is certaintly one to try. If you are a fan already, you are sure to enjoy this as much as I did."
"Certainly a drinkable ale, but nothing that really holds my attention."
"M&D: almost fullsome for an English pale ale, it's quite easy to quaff thanks to the lightly-carbonated body and a sort of balance achieved b/w bitterness and sweetness... There's no beer in my brain's database to compare with this ale (esp. when I'm ""merry"" now...), but it's definitely a good pale ale or premium bitter with some added fruitiness to its advantage. I could only imagine the taste of the cask-conditioned version, which, alas, does not exist. Samuel Smith really should cask-condition more of their brilliant beers~~"
"22 oz. bottle. This has an okay aroma and appearance of pale orange with an off-white head, and decent lacing. I thought it tasted good, slightly malty, but unfortunately, it seemed to have a sour, slightly metallic finish that really did not leave me wanting more anytime soon."
"Pours an amber color with a nice off-white head. Smell is malty and slightly hoppy. Taste is malty that finishes very dry as the hops set in. The taste is also slightly nutty and there is a kind of metallic taste as well. The mouthfeel is medium and lightly carbonated. Overall this is another superb brew from Samuel Smith's that I will enjoy time and time again."
"Prost. MK"
"Great Beer. Period."
"M/D: Moderate carbonation decreased as I drank. Medium bodied. The bitterness of a wonderful pale ale was present, and this was complemented by a great malt balance. The smell is amazing every time you take a sip."
"Another solid offering from Sam Smith."
"Copper in color with a thick half inch head. Fruity smell with hops overtones. Dry, clean, and crisp in taste. A solid pale ale and overall an incredibly balanced beer. Standard but good. Highly drinkable. Of the Samuel Smith beers I would probably wander towards the Oatmeal Stout or the Nut Brown Ale before this beer."
"Cheers2Beers"
"Mouth feel is a bit light, but the carbonation levels are done right."
"12 ounce clear bottle. Bright copper with dense, off-white foam. Aromas of English hops and toasty malts, but leaning toward skunkiness, even though I grabbed this bottle from the back of the shelf. Grassy hops dominate the flavor at first, toasted biscuit malt cuts through (briefly and slightly) in mid sip, and finish is distinctly metallic. Unfortunately, the taste is leaning towards the skunk side of things, too. Enough with the clear glass already, eh guys? Anyway, brisk mouthfeel, clean and almost juicy. Easy enough to drink, but the risk of skunked beer for the high price is not worth it in my opinion."
"Dark amber with a moderate tan head. Nose is apply, woodsy sweet, like an apple juice or apple tea. Mouth is sweet, again of tea, perhaps some light coffee, nuts, and the slightest touch of bitterness. Overall, the flavor is very complex and quite good. Mouth is watery with minor carbonation. Theres a nice clean finish with light bitterness along with some sweet apple and again a hint of coffee. Drinkability is above average, these go down easy. Overall, an excellent and complex ale."
"Poured from the bottle into a glass mug. Poured an old copper color with a good looking 1 inch head. Mildly carbonated. Strong malt aroma with little to no hop bitterness in the nose. A sweet, caramel aroma. The flavor reflects the strong malt backbone but is balanced a little more than the aroma would indicate. Smooth easy to drink and a good example of an English Pale Ale."
"Overall thoughts: Aa good example of an English pale ale. Easy to drink, definitely sessionable as good as any in Sam Smith's lineup."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Solid, good carbonation. Bold, in a good way... not quite as slick and rolling as what I'd consider the ""perfect"" mouthfeel, but good. I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed this beer."
"I don't think Sam Smith makes any bad beers, but I was a little less blown away by this one. It is a tasty, drinkable, down to earth pale. Interestingly, I had it with a gingery dish and that slight cinnamon came out in a big way that was quite pleasing. Try it sometime."
"As always it is in the mouthfeel department that the Samuel Smith brew truly shines. A little heavier than most pale ales I've encountered, it is silky across the tongue. A joy to swallow, and at 5% a very suitable session beer."
"Pours up nice from bottle to pint glass. A 2.5 finger head rises frothy and rich and then falls to a ring and some spotting on the surface with a nice thin lace on the glass. The nice translucent brown/amber color is really appealing. Smells of roasted malts carmels, and some earthy organic tones. A nice full taste toasty and smooth with ample hop integrity as the drink warms. Plenty malty right through the middle and definately in the finish....some nice alchohol hints in the finish as well. The mouthfeel is incredibly full nice carbonation balance a great feel. Over all very drinkable beer. A nice addition from sam smiths...not too surprising I guess."
"Could use a thicker head."
"This entry to the Samuel Smith line disappoints. Like all SS brews, drinkability is its strong suit, and this pale ale goes down as smooth as silk. But the taste just disappears off my tongue with very little redeeming qualities. Not a bad session brew, but I'm sticking with my tried-and-true SS favorites..."
"The alcohol content is strong enough to make it iffy as a session beer, but this is very drinkable and would make a good one, nevertheless. The fact that I can get this at area grocery stores (while the OSH and Bod's requires a trip out of state) gives it an extra point or two as well."
"Not bad. There something about these English Pale Ales that's appealing to me. This wouldn't make a bad session beer, but I think I'd prefer it on-tap if it were available."
"Smell is biscuit and fermentation smells. Slight hop bitterness in the nose. Taste is similar. Hint of toasted biscuit and a little bit of grass. Nothing overwhelming. English hop flavor with a good amount of hop flavor, although not the piney/citrus of APAs. Finishes very clean; dry. You can feel the bubbles. Very nice drinking beer."
"This is one fine Pale Ale. It far more balanced than the American versions of the style, but retains great depth and complexity, particularly in the malts profile. A great session ale."
"The bottom line: if you want to give Mr. Sam Smith your money, exchange it for some Oatmeal Stout or Imperial Stout."
"the bitterness boasted a dry hop tang toward the end"
"This was the first English Pale Ale I have tried. I noticed a lot of carbonation as I opened the bottle. The bubbles rushed to the top of the bottle and bubbles formed at the top of the bottle. I was expecting an impressive head after this but there was almost no head and it dissipated very quickly. The color was dark, clear amber. The taste reminded me of a Marzen and also a bit like Smithwick's. The mouthfeel was a bit thin (I'm comparing it to Smithwick's). Drinkability was ok, but this is not a beer I would necessarily seek out. Pretty average."
"Very well balanced, smooth and easy to drink."
"Bready malt flavor with a dry, roasted finish. I picked up just a hint of caramel in the flavor, but it's subtle. Very well balanced and wonderfully drinkable. I'm not normally a big fan of English ales, but I found this one very enjoyable and will be picking some up again."
"I'm sure I'll be having this again sooner or later (the gift pack with the logo glass always sucks me in). High marks all around."
"Quite refreshing. Surprisingly nice in flavor and very drinkable."
"Like every Samuel Smith brew Ive ever had its exceptional. Balanced with subtle complexity and a great malt profile. Highly recommended."
"D: Well rounded, easily approachable, very drinkable. Would be an excellent session beer."
"Overall: A very nice offering, better than most English pales I've had."
"Dont expect even a hint of American pale ale here. I must say I didnt really like it at first. But about half way through I found myself getting used to the astringency and enjoying it."
"D - I could see this being a good session beer for some but it really just lacks too much in the flavor dept in my opinion."
"But the taste, superb! Malts and coffee, with just a hint of floral hops in the finish- the balance between the two sides was excellent. Lightly carbonated, very smooth to drink and enjoy. I hope to have this one in the market basket again!"
"Overall = A respectable English pale ale on all fronts. One I could drink every day without complaint. Recommended."
"Drinkability: I would definately drink this beer again. The clear glass bottles make me leery, but I bought this one as a boxed gift set for the holidays so I was pretty sure of freshness. I got a nice SS pint glass and coaster also. Packaged with Nut brown Ale and Celebrated Oatmeal Stout which will be my next 2 reviews."
"Beer pours a clear amber color with a nice off white head that lasted quite a bit before turning to lace. Looks great. Hops as well as a nut smell is present. Taste is just average. Slight malt taste, hops become apparent halfway through but nowhere near as apparent very subdued. Medium bodied with a dry finish. High drinkability due to low alc % and sublte taste."
"Overall not a bad beer. A bit average, just not great."
"Tasty pale ale, and very drinkable, but nothing spectacular enough to get me to stop drinking mt local APAs."
"This generally seems to be among the higher rated breweries in England if not the whole of the British Isles and this isn't even one of their signature products. Most impressive. I like hoppy pale ales and this one is pretty special, even for the ""specter'd isle""."
"Opinion: I would suspect that there is a bit of a lower-attenuating yeast that was in charge of this brew. The finish isn't syrupy, but it is pretty sugary considering that this is only a 5%ABV beer. The bittering hops is very well balanced to keep it from being cloying. This really is a pretty well crafted brew, and one I would recommend trying at least once. I personally prefer Youngs Special London Ale, but this is a fine brew from an outstanding brewery!"
"poured a beautifeul copper-reddish color with abundant tannish head. Head was long lasting and presented attractive lacing to the sides of the glass. Smell is fruity (cherries), molasses-like, with a toasty presence. Some hoppiness also noted. Very enjoyable to the nose. Taste is very understated initally, with caramel, fruits, toasted malt dominating, but slowly a stong hoppiness presents itself. The hoppiness becomes bolder with each sip, but still blends very well with the maltiness. Finishes both dry and malty in just the right proportions to be tasty, but not overpowering. The is an extremely drinkable berr that I thoroughly enjoyed. I had expected something rather bland and unassuming, but I was pleasingly suprised."
"It poured a copper color with a nice head of white foam that some lace in my Samuel Smith pint glass. The aroma was that of sweet hops, malt, fruits, and with a floral background. The taste had some friuts, little malt, and at the end, a dry bitter hop aftertaste. The mouthfeel was light, carbonated and with that dry bitter hop aftertaste that I discussed before. This was my first English Pale Ale and would make a nice readily available Pale Ale to get into the style. Again, watch out because this is a beer that can't stand out in light for very long and get skunky."
"Had a hearty body that was impressive for this style. I could sweart this is almost a torn down version of the nut brown. Alot of the same characteristics just a moderate version. Malts were dominant and fairly chewey. Hops cleaned up and the usual dry finish for this style held true. A unique version and fairly earthy but definately session material. I'm a big fan of the beer and the brewery. Now If I could get this stuff at non-import prices I'd have this all the time."
"All in all very drinkable. The clear glass bottle didn't seem to have harmed the brew in the least (good handling or just good luck?) If you're looking for a good English Pale Ale there are a few major brands you can choose without going wrong (Youngs, Fullers) It's safe to say you can add Samuel Smith to that list."
"Pulled from a Samuel Smith sampler (which also includes their Oatmeal Stout and Nut Brown, as well as a Samuel Smith), and I'm pleased to say that this will have to be a regular for me! It's a lovely, medium-dark brown with a bit of red. The head is a fluffy, off-white which disappeared before long to leave some lacing. It smells much sweeter than I'd expect--lots of carmel with coffee and chocolate as well. It is a beautifully well-rounded beer with not-too-in-your-face hops and it's not-overpoweringly either. Medium bodied with carbonation, and it finishes slightly dry. I love this beer!!!"
"Samuel Smith is a quality brewery. Given the fact that Old Brewery Pale Ale leans so heavily toward malt, I'm a little surprised that I like it as much as I do. Quality is quality, though, and I will happily continue to give these guys my hard-earned money for their well-brewed beer."
"Goes down smooth."
"Pours a cream, one-finger head that vanishes quickly leaving no lace. Slightly cloudy amber color. Medium-strong carbonation and medium bodied. Nose is faintly sweet. Starts on the sweet side with some hops hiding in the background. Clean finish, this is a good pale not loaded with hops. $3 for a 550ml bottle from Northend Superette Manchester, NH."
"Drinkability: A great beer for session drinking. Good flavor but not overwhelming."
"A wonderful way to begin a dinner of cajun-style sausage and rice. Would do well with a grilled steak paired up with a bleu cheese maitre d' butter. Or drink it on its own and honor a tried and true tradition."
"Copper and crystal clear. I was a little worried about the clear bottle but this one is not skunked. Two finger persistent nitrous like head. Aroma of earthy Fuggles and Goldings hops mingle with fruity British yeast esters and a mild butterscotch diacetyl. A medium light body with stonger carbonation than I expected for the style. The sweetness from crystal malt balanced with hops. Improves with warming - showing off its lightly roasted malt base and burnt caramel that lingers with light hop and finishes with dry biscuit malt notes."
"My last of the Samuel Smith beers. Until, of course, I'm lucky enough to find more. This ale pours a nice, copper colour with a small but firm white head. About a finger's worth of foam floating atop the copper. Their are a few whisps of lace. But, not much. No more than a few strings here and their. Smells of fruit candy, grass, lemon and bread. Taste is mild. Bready, sweet, with a bit of a bitter grass finish. Mouthfeel is a bit granular, rough. I like it. Drinkable as a session beer. But, not overly complex. Simplicity is what makes this beer good."
"Sammy Smith is Always worth a try, do so!"
"Impression: A classic strong ale. Maybe not as strong as I am used to , but well balanced and appropriate."
"Drinkability: An excellent rendering of the English Pale Ale style and, perhaps, a benchmark for the style. Very enjoyable, with superb drinkability, essentially a session ale."
"A good version of the style; a standard of Sammy Smith's. The aromais sweet and inviting, but the flavor somewhat drops off (or is that due to that damn clear bottle?). Nevertheless, a good version of the style I'd be happy to drink anytime."
"A nice pale ale from Samuel Smith, that I have had many times before and that I will have many times again."
"This beer pours a clear light amber color with a fluffy white head that sticks around for a few minutes. The aroma is the only part of this beer that isn't suprisingly good. It has a mild malt aroma coupled with a mild floral hopping. The taste is mostly malty with a nice little hoppiness in the middle and in the finish. Medium carbonation, overall a good mouthfeel. I think this is a very drinkable beer. I like this one and would recommend it to anyone. Try this one and then buy a Fullers London Pride. Let the competition begin."
"A little thin bodied with some nice carbonation. Pretty drinkable and pairs well with pork and chicken dishes."
"The taste has a wash of mineral fizz at the start, delivering a nutty, round malt and a bit of butterscotch. It has a dry hoppy finish and a lingering beautifully bitter aftertaste. It's a nice mouthful and a great session beer."
"I found this beer to be very drinkable and I definately recommend it."
" A good English pale ale considering the long boat ride to the colonies."
"This bottle came in a 3 bottle variety pack and came with a Samuel Smith glass. Pouring the beer into that glass yielded a nice 1 finger head. Color was a brown amber and the beer had nice carbonation. Aroma is of dried fruits, English malts, caramel and a tad of hops. Tastes like sweet malts but is very dry in the mouth and again just a tad of hop flavor. I also seem to taste a little hazelnut flavor. This beer is very easy to drink and is a good solid English pale ale."
"Another excellent brew from the Sam Smith brewery."
"Drinkability: Well, it was not what I was expecting, but it was still good, I went through this bottle with relative ease, and Id probably have another if they werent so stinkin expensive."
"Pours a coppery brown with a cream coloured-domed frothy head which diminishes rather quickly to a layer of bubbles on the surface. Some malts with some hops in the nose, but not much. Grainy malts in the taste lead to a very nice lingering bitter hop finish. Good mouthfeel with not too aggressive carbonation. A classic English Pale Ale, and a good solid beer. Too bad Samuel Smith only cask-conditions the OBB."
"Old Brewery Pale Ale has a distinct, almost glowing bright copper color. The head is about average in size and moderately creamy. The aroma is of lightly sweet toasted malts with just a touch of English hops. The taste is of light caramel malt with a dry hop backbone. The finish is dry with a touch of sweet grain. This brew is very tasty and almost too easy to drink. I see this being in my shopping cart often in the future."
"Rests in the glass a misty dark amber with an off-white head that sticks with the pint all the way to the base of the glass. Smeel is sour - perhaps similar to white grapes - and has its own distinct bite. This pale ale starts incredibly smooth, light, and velvety but without much flavor. That changes as the beer settles full-bodied onto your tongue and presents a crisp flavor that at once resembles both lemon and berries over a solid matly base. Leaves the tongue dry, then semi-sweet with a metallic, sour, hop edge. Shockingly enough the aftertaste is actually pleasant."
"The taste had a slightly bitter upfront flavor and is followed by a blend of caramel sweetness on the tip of tongue and hops bitterness in the back upon the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is light to medium in body and reveals a delightful blend of sweetness and hops when swished through the mouth. I could picture myself drinking more of this further along the road, but I have yet to try the Sam Smith Organic Pale (or whatever it's called). As far as this goes, I think I liked Fuller's London Pride better for a good English Pale Ale, but only slightly."
"Finishes clean enough with a thin mouthfeel. Pretty average by the standards of the style."
"550 mL clear bottle with no freshness date."
"This is a very drinkable pale ale. Next time I'm going to try with some kind of food, as I think it would lend itself pretty well as a dinner beer. I think I'll stick with the oatmeal stout or nut brown ale."
"One of my favorite beers since I learned to drink good beer. I first tasted Sam Smith Pale Bitter (a slightly different, less strong version) in Yorkshire in 1992, and I've drunk many bottles over the years. It's my favorite of the line, and though occasionally I've gotten a skunked bottle, most times I've been completely satisfied."
"But it just seems like it is lacking flavor. It seems like the beer finished a little dry and bland. I can't really put my finger on it though. Maybe my palate is accustomed to American Pale Ales that are higher hopped. Overall, not bad. But I don't think it is worth over $2 a bottle, which I will gladly pay for their Nut Brown or Oatmeal Stout."
"A bit fizzy on the tongue, but still smooth drinking."
"Surprisingly and thankfully, I experienced no skunkiness from the clear bottle offering. This ale poured a deep amber that bordered on a copper color. Head retention was good and wispy lace patterns stuck to my British pint glass. Heavily tilted toward the malt in both aroma and taste. Slight hop with some buttery tones. Very smooth and drinkable. Good ale when you can find them unskunked. I don't get the clear bottles, but this one was fine."
"A nice ale. Pours a moderate amber color. A nice off-white head forms and lasts. Smell is slightly hoppy. The taste is somewhat better than average, with a pleasant balance of hops and malt. A nice pale ale to enjoy, although not so special that it should be searched out."
"The taste is nice and malty with a nice hop balance. I detect a little vanilla in the smooth finish. The mouthfeel and drinkablity of this beer are good. A good overall beer."
"I could drink a lot of this, which is good since the bottle is big."
"Pours amber with a white head that laces very well. Smell was subdued, perhaps served a little too cold. Smells like a good bitter, some floral qualities as well. Taste was a very drinkable toffee malt with a great roasted finish, some hops as well. Light mouthfeel that definitely helps its drinkability. I have tried Sam's Russian Stout and Oatmeal Stout, and while those are amazing, I find this one more drinkable. I hope to try this on draft in England some day."
"This is actually one of the first times I have had this offering from SS. Over all it is a nice beer, poured to a copper color with a nice foamy off white head that left a fair amount of lacing on the sides of the glass. The aromas are of Malt, a sweet slight nutty scent along with a pinch of hop. Nothing extreme with this brew, very subtle aromas. The taste is very similar to the aromas, nothing extreme. A well-balanced brew with flavors of buttery malt, hints of caramel and a slight hop taste. This seems to be a classic English version of a pale ale. Over all it is a good beer but not one of my favorites from Samuel Smiths."
"Bought this beer at TJ's for about 2.49. Presented in a 1 pt2.7 oz bottle. I poured this beer into a regular pint pub glass. A nice amber color with a nice head which diminishes to a nice lace on the glass. The nose, I get some nice fruity hops. The taste is hoppy with a nice sutle malty finish. The mouthfeel is nice, creamy and effervescent. Pretty good beer, I could drink a few."
"Well as with the other SS this is metallic and this is probably the worst. I must have been chewing my bronze gum while drinking this, note to self no more light SS. Anyway from this years gift set this beer was a nice copper taste, I mean color and a unforgiving metal taste that was only tolerable being chugged. It had a decent body and it smelled like a beer in a rusty can."
"This beer pours an amber color with a medium head that stays around a while and leaves a little bit of lacing on the glass. The aroma has a fruity character and floral hops. The flavor is surprisingly malty, but finishes with a nice bitterness. This seemed a bit malty and dark for a Pale Ale. This is an ok beer, but I like the other Samuel Smith stuff better."
"A clean honey/amber ale with a small beige head. Beer has a lightly sweet kind of grassy aroma. The flavor has a light spicey hop bitterness that is followed by a nice malty sweetness that settles on the middle of your tongue. A nice session ale but not outstanding."
"One down side of Sam Smiths is the terrible clear glass bottles, Ive had many skunked samples. Luckily this one was packaged it a box as well."
"1/2 liter clear export bottle...no date codes ..I assume this is parsturized or sterile. Poured a lovely deep amber-orange with a fluffy rocky cap that laces well to the glass. Moderate carbonation. Aroma of floral hopping and apricot tones over the honey malts. Malty body is balanced with some semi bitter hopping some mild complexity and a rather short finish...for all I had heard about this beer , Im underwhelmed..perhaps this beer suffered from being an export and had its normal character killed by pastrurization or serile filtering but this is an average pale....and there are better domestics IMHO."
"Pours an orange color with a thick off white head, little carbonatoin noted. As I opened the beer I was taken back by the skunky odor, damn clear bottles. Skunkyness dissapated as the beer settled in the glass but then was replaced by fruitty esters with a sulfury winey characteristic. I don't care too much for the yeast strain Samuel Smith uses. Taste is earthy and aftertaste of grain builds up, some fruitty esters in there, again with a vinous characteristic. Body is thin and watery and beer is lightly carbonated. Once you get past the taste the drinkablity isn't bad. Definatly not worth the price."
"Another clear bottle. I'm not sure of this. The beer pours a ruby amber color, with a finger of head that falls to coat the beer. The initial scent is a skunked beer, but after letting it sit, the nose is a lot of caramel sweetness, and not much hop. The flavor is mosthy caramel malt, very sweet without much hop to bring balance. Its not bd, but not great. The feel is just moderate at bes, with a decent carbonation that works well with the beer. The drinkability is okay on this as well. I'd drink this again."
"This beer worked perfectly with dessert that included tiramisu and key lime pie. The sweetness of the tiramisu and this brew work very well together."
"Clear bottles creep me out and it seems the light got to this pale. It pours a nice dark brown with light streaks throughout, the head is off white and nice at first then settles to a line. No lacing on the glass. The smell is off the bat skunky, once you get past that you will detect caramel malts and syrup. The taste has hints of roasted grain and strong caramel sweetness, the floral hop is weak and doesn't blend the sweetness of the pale. A little over sweeted for my liking. Medium bodied, better from this brewery out there, better pale ale's as well."
"Revisiting this beer today, it seems a bit different than I remember, but it's still a fine English ale with a unique character. The aroma is earthy and accented by toasted grains. These same grains add to the flavor of this ale and mingle carefully with the hops and other grains, along with the minerally-tasting yeast flavors.Though the malt component of this beer is put forward, the hops help achieve a balance and add a bitterness that is distinct in a British manner, but not by any means assertive or overwhelming in an American way. The English ales are about subtlety and grace when compared to brighter and more assertive American ale. I can still appreciate this beer, despite being hooked on American hops."
"Overall Impression: A nice English Pale Ale. Its drinkable, refreshing, interesting and has some complexity which lends itself toward a decent session beer. A good representative of its style, but I prefer its American cousins when thinking Pale Ale."
"Overall- a delicious beer that went well after my jog. A beer you can treat yourself with from time to time."
"One of the great english pale ales."
"Pours a deep amber color with one finger of head. A bit of lacing left on the glass. The smell is light, with some sweetness from malt mixed in with a hoppy aroma. The taste has caramel maltiness and is sweet at first. The finish has a good bit of hops. The body is pretty thick and smooth, and the drinkability is nice. A solid pale ale."
"It pours a nice opaque brown with a thin off-white head. It smells heavily of malt with hops and spice in the background. This a good tasty malty ale with some spicieness and a sweet cherry finish. The feel is very smooth and oily. While I don't buy it as often as the Pure Lager, it's my choice of Pale Ales"
"Sorry I wasn't totally impressed with this beer. I could have gotten Heiniken for less money, but I didn't dog it because I like Heiniken."
"The mouthfeel is smooth with a slightly dry finish. The malt lingers a bit after swallowing. Nicely drinkable and it is always a pleasure to drink this simple and pleasurable english style pale ale."
"A very nice little pale ale, slick hop oils also sit around on the palette for a while after"
"Taste is malts punctuated by high carbonation in the mouth. Not sweet at all. Creamy finish fades into more fresh bread crusts and mild hops, with some lasting malt accents. Medium body, combined with the carbonation, made this beer very filling in my tummy."
"again, not the pick of sammy smiths beers, but still a well constructed, well balanced beer that is satisfactory in every department. wont blow your mind but cant be classified as a disappointment either."
"I am disappointed in this offering from Sam Smith. It is smooth, but doesn't offer a lot of flavor, or leave you wanting more as the rest of their beverages do. A so-so beer from a spectacular brewer."
"A distinctive beer with a lot of flavor to it. Can't wait to crack open that Oatmeal Stout when I get home from work tonight and start grilling!"
"Nice dark amber colour with a nice malted nose. This beer is something I would pair with a BBQ rack of ribs, since that is what I think of as I drink. Nice and filling and yet has a delicate finish that lets you ponder the subtle spice. This is a very nice brew."
"chenge of pace from american pale ales. i guess thats obvious since its not american. trades in the blatant hop influence for a more restrained character."
"Notes: Meh. Not fantastic, but certainly not bad, and very drinkable. The standard you expect from this brewery. Not my favorite style though so while its good I probably wont be specifically looking for this bottle again."
"Thick, viscous, bubbly head tops a rich red/copper, very clear but not weak looking, beer. I see amber, light red, and light brown colouration. It leaves islands of lace of varying sizes on the glass, with good longevity. The aroma is ideally balanced with caramel malt and perfumy, fragrant, spicy hop notes. Besides the delightful caramel and butter smells, there exist touches of coffee, cream, sweet candy, pepper, dark fruits, fresh lettuce or other dark vegetables(yes, vegetables), and even meat, such as roast or peppered steak, most easily detectable immediately after pouring. The aroma is very organic; earthy. This is the way a good pale ale should smell, for my personal tastes: nicely balanced, with no overpowering, numbing hop presence, but still with a definite hop character. A grainy maltiness introduces itself to the palate upon the first sip: immediately detectable are the roasted qualities of the beer. Toasted bread tastes, with a very granular presence on the tongue, oatmeal-like. Strong cereal taste, but balanced enough with the bittering hops, which is felt nicely on the finish: oily and satisfactorily dry. Actually the hop feel becomes more and more pronounced with each subsequent sip. Adequate carbonation. For those who like a good bitter Pale Ale, this should be engagingly effortless to consume. Old Brewery Tadcaster does it again. I taste merry old England in every swallow."
"Pours an amber-ruby color with a thick, puffy off-white head, not much smell to speak of. Very effervescent, tickels the tongue nicely however makes for quite a belch engine. Silky-smooth in the mouth with a caramelized grain flavor, with a bit of cinnamon. Not very complex but the mellow flavor by itself makes it pretty drinkable, however the excessive carbonation will keep you from drinking very many."
"Other than the aroma this beer stands out for me for its variety of stimulating the senses and its complexity (subtle as it is) of the drinking experience. Really smooths out as warms becoming a very good drink."
"This is a quite drinkable, tasty English pale ale. It might be a little bit too thick to be considered a good lawnmower beer, but it still hits the spot nicely"
"I think I may have a bias for English Pale Ales. I just can't get enough of the rich, tangy, toffee, buttery, nutty, bitter goodness. This one gives up two fingers of noisy, uneven, foamy, cream-colored head. The color of the beer is a nice rusty-red-amber-brown and clear. Sweet, tangy, caramel, toffee, Brit-malt, awesome nose. Caramel starts the show turning full, malty, buttery toward a tangy, nutty, bitter finish. Absolutely delicious."
"Iced tea colored with a dark beige tight head that rises up and settles quickly. Aroma is hoppy, with notes of malt and raisin. Smooth mouthfeel with light carbonation leads to a pungent flavor of sharp malt, burnt brown sugar, fig and raisin. Bits of caramel and toffee come through in the finish. Lots of depth for a pale ale."
"This beer is another good one from the excellent Samuel Smith. This is a pale ale to seek out."
"When I took my first drink of this beer, I felt like I was sucking the smelt off of a copper mine. This beer has a bitter, unforgiving and relentless afterbite. More bitter than my ex girlfriend, and an aftertaste that haunts you like her memory, and will not go away. I needed crackers to remove the aftertaste. I needed therapy to remove her memory. I did not like this beer, not one bit."
"This beer pours a copper color with a small white head that held for a few minutes. The smell is really bready, akin to biscuits with honey poured on top. The main flavor I get when tasting this beer is caramel. There seems to be a lot of caramel which is complemented by various fruit esters, green apple leading the way. Kind of like a caramel covered apple. There is a grainy base to this which helps the flavors from getting too sweet and works with a floral hop element to complement the caramel. The finish is slightly yeasty sour and quite thirst quenching. Very creamy and smooth with a medium body. This is a classic."
"Overall, I would classify this as a very average Pale Ale. As far as drinkability is concerned, it goes down extremely smooth but there doesn't appear to be much going on in the way of complexities here."
"Got this one in the Samuel Smith varity pack with the pint glass included (very good value). I had pretty high expectations from this brew as every Sammy Smith beer i've had has been excellent. This one didn't disappoint but i don't think it'll be making my regular rotation. I've have yet to gain an apreciation for subtlety. It poured a proud copper with a small white head, pretty appealing. Smell was very faint with some notes of fruit and malt. Taste... Hmmm.. I wish I could give this higher marks but it was very plain to me. Some sweet malt flavor was present and it was balanced very well, but nothing really jumped out at me Mouthfeel was fine as was drinkability. I'm hoping this will be a beer i grow to love, but as of this moment it just seemed very basic, very subtle. I plan to revisit this beer in a year, as my palate refines, to see what i think of it. It is obviously a solid brew and i wish i could appreciate it more."
"Very good, but not a session beer. This would be great with a bowl of jambalaya or gumbo. Pulled pork would also pair nicely with this."
"And to Merchant duVin (and the manufacturer): Put an end to the CLEAR glass!"
"SSPA is another great offering by this great brewery. Looking for a bridge beer for your friends, try this at your next BBQ. Solid and refreshing."
"Taste is a bit matallic and sweet pale malt. Creamy and smooth with a very mild body. Light hops finish. Very drinkable and pretty light-bodied. Nothing really special here."
"Pours a copper color with a white creamy/foamy head. Nice lace present on the glass throughout. Faint toast or biscuit smell, and not much else. Tastes slightly buttery with a nice bitter finish. This is a drinkable beer. This seems to be an old reliable of mine that I revisit every now and again. Sometimes there is a thirst for a English Pale, and this seems to hit the spot."
"Very drinkable, a beer for all year long."
"One note: what the hell is with the clear bottle??"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, a creamy off-white head forms on top of a deeply golden liquid. The head has staying power, and leaves thick lace all over the glass. Pleasant hops aroma, which couples with the tastes of an optimal amount bitterness and a bit more malt than most pales ales, which is a plus in my book. Not particularly a pale ale fan, but this one does it for me."
"Pours a beautiful, full golden-copper color with a small creamy head. The smell is tangy and sweet, clearly favoring the malt side of the equation, but with a spicy hoppiness as well. The taste, sorry to say, was less to my liking than expected. I suppose I'm just used to PNW Pale that are hop-heavy, but the sweet, malty nature of the taste was a little cloying. Notes of caramel are abundant, with a slight piney hopiness and a peculiar tinny aftertaste battling for the finish. Crisp nonetheless, and good in the mouth due to strong carbonation and relatively full body. Drinkability is average. A solid English Pale Ale when I want something different."
"pours out a beautiful deep amber colour, with a huge, rich,frothy off white head. pretty lacy, too. aroma of earthy maltiness, sweet and full of caramel. light english hop nose, too. tastes refreshing...medium maltiness that has a real grainy tone is balanced nicely by a fair dose of english hops...nicely bittered for a english ale. i could really pick up on the mineral aspects of the water...definitely part of the profile. mouthfeel isn't exactly smooth, but slightly rough and raw feeling. body is medium to full. overall, nice tasting and easily quaffable. a classy english ale."
"The beer pours an amber color with a thin white lace head. The aroma is good. It is full of pale malts and a mild hop aroma. The taste is also good. This is a fine English-style pale ale. It is light and bitter with a dry finish and a mild hop flavor. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low/medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This drinks well and is a good sessions beer."
"Came in a clear pint bottle, in a gift set that included coasters and a Samuel Smith tulip. Hazy rust colored with an off-white head. Smells of fruit, hops, and sweetness. Has a hearty flavor that gives way to a layer of hops to finish. Pretty tasty, I could drink several of these. I would like more hops, but I say that about every beer."
"A pleasant ambour color with nice creamy white head. Proves that pale means traditionally, an ale that is not dark but ratehr clarified. Astringent, bitter taste but modified by food. Can be appreciated a mug member. They have superior products to this."
"Down it went - with nothing but pleasure on the horizon. It left a sweet and sour mixture on my pallette, that faded into a gentle bitter that left me begging for more. Each sip was more enjoyable. I promised myself that this would not be my last affair with the Samuel Smith Old Brewery Pale Ale."
"550ml bottle - Pourred a light brown brew with a nice head with short retention span. Powerful floral aroma coming out of my glass is wonderful. Taste is bit sour with great hops balance. Body is medium. Overall, this is an above average english pale ale."
"I do see this beer as being a good pairing for pub grub: perhaps some bangers and mash, fish and chips, or maybe even a prime rib. This is a good drinkable pale ale, and other strong offering from Sam Smith's."
"I really enjoyed this beer. I thought it was very mellow and full of flowery hop aroma. Poured a nice rich head. A very clear and crisp amberish color. Taste was very light. Not much of a hoppy flavor at all. Most seemed to come from the aroma. Very light and refereshing mouthfeel as well."
"Clear glowing dark amber colored beer. A light tan head formed when poured, and sank down to a thin coating after a while. The smell is of butterscotch and sweet malt, not much in the hop department. Smooth, clean body. The flavor is a splash of floral hops, and ringwood yeast? Most of what I thought was flavor was the aroma carried over into the light flavor. I like this one, and I'm assuming the characteristics of an English pale ale are different than an American style Pale Ale."
"A nice beer that reminded me what an English pale ale is all about. Almost too sweet for me, though."
"Drinkability  What can I say? It went great with my sandwich and chips and would make a nice session ale."
"Served at around 5 degrees Kelvin, a lot of this brew was lost on me until it warmed up enough to taste. Tasty and drinkable."
"Very smooth, an easy sipper, medium body. Samuel Smith has yet to let me down."
"Notes: Very well balanced; enjoyed this quite a bit."
"Paler copper colored with a thin beige head. Notes of diacetyl, butterscotch and a healthy dose of floral English nobles present. Hoppy and smooth; quite enjoyable. Malty and rich with a silky mouthfeel. Slightly effervescent. Hoppier than one might expect, not in an American pale ale way, though. Very drinkable."
"A nice looking amber pour with a generous off-white head. A sweet and lightly hoppy nose with floral notes. The taste is modeartely hoppy with a fruity sweetness and hints of carmel. nice maltiness as well. very smooth mouthfeel and a very easy drinker. while it's not my favorite pale ale, i think it is very good and has excellent drinkability."
"A solid Pale Ale. The color is very nice indeed-burnt orange in hue with a solid cap of buttery head initially, then a ""hey I'm still here"" cap for the duration. Sticky, spider web lace adds to the visuals. In the mouth hops lead the charge and exhibit a rather citric profile, almost like a summer Saison from Belgium. Tangy hop flavors are balanced by butter toffee and toasty malt. What a treat! I bet this would be delicious on tap at an English pub-accompanied by some pub grub of course. I can almost taste the malt vinegar on my chips!"
" A bit lighter in impact than I expected. Quite drinkable, I would be happy to have it again."
"Justin"
"Drinkability: Wonderfully balanced and consistant. Easily a session beer that could be enjoyed everyday without tire. While not boring it is not challenging either. A beer that could be enjoyed by nearly anyone."
"Note: I got this beer in a gift box (Pale Ale, Nut Brown Ale, Oatmeal Stout) along with a glass, a couple of coasters and a printed beer guide. The beer is great, but the packaging of the gift box left a lot to be desired. The glass was filthy with greasy fingerprints and had a flawed logo. Now I could wash the glass easily enough, but I took the whole works back because I wanted a glass in good condition. Well the next glass had a clean logo but was equally filthy with greasy fingerprints. These guys could do a better job of presentation given it's a gift box. Safe to treat yourself, but don't plan on buying one of these and giving it away unless you want to be embarassed. And there is no opening the box to polish up the glass before hand as it's sealed up with a bunch of logo-printed stickers."
"The aroma is light without much other than a hint of hops with a full boat of malt overlaying the bittering. The taste is mostly of the malts with enough hops to balance the sweetness and finish with good dryness. The feel is medium with only light carbonation. Nice biscuit sense in the taste as well. Exceedingly drinkable."
"Not a big fan of Samuel Smith's Brewery...but, me thinks this may be there best product."
"Haven't had this one in quite awhile, this time around it pours a pale copper hue with a billowing off white light khaki head. Clouded texture which rises above the rim of my glass adds to the eye candy. Served slightly chilled, lacing is sporadic and spotty but this beer is nice. Served into an official Samuel Smith imperial pint glass. Aroma is quite fruiy with some green apple and and bready qualities coming togther. An interesting layer of earthy hops and a touch of mineral water colliding together. I bought a nice gift sampler with big 550 ml bottles of this, the Nut Brown Ale, and Oatmeal Stout with the glass included for around 11 bucks. Flavor is semi sweet with a mix of caramel malt, bready yeast tones, and balanced with fruity ale notes and herbal earthy English hops. The well water used does impart a nice mineral water character that doesn't impart any off flavors, it just really works well here. Mouthfeel is well rounded carbonation is subdued and very smooth on the palate, medium bodied session ale for sure. Drinkability is pretty effortless the only thing better would be a couple pints pulled from a hand pump while hanging in a London pub."
"Drinkability - if it wasn't for the metallic taste this would easily score much higher. Edit - a different beer when fresh, adjusting score from 2.5 to 4.0."
"Medium brown color, medium head. Aroma is malty with some hops. Medium bodied pale ale. Mild flavor, kind of typical for English Pale Ale. Malts and hops are evident, but not overpowering. Kind of buttery tasting. Well-balanced beer. Nice taste. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is crisp and a touch dry. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"I must have gotten a better bottle of this than some of the other reviewers.Although it comes in a clear bottle, (something that I frown upon) there was no skunky smell or taste whatsoever.It poured very well and maintained a healthy head with good color and aroma.It's light in the mouthfeel compared to other ales of this style, but it is highly drinkable and I will continue to enjoy it.Would love to try it on tap."
"The lingering bitter taste was not to my liking. Nor was the slight skunkiness. Not a bad beer but I've had better pale ales."
"Nice one inch thick white head with a little lace to be left behind and it dosen't dissipate that quickly either. There is an aroma of a carmelly sweet malt and a floral hop accent. The taste is salty due to the water with a definte sweetness due to tha carmel malt and a hop flavor that follows up to finish with a hop bitterness. Body is horrible as this beer has so much carbonic bite that it is a task in itself to find the flavors while the carbonation attacks your tongue. This beer is probably excellent if it is on cask but with artificial carbonation it is not very good, though maybe i served it too cold and too much of the carbonation was in solution instead of dissipating on opening the bottle."
"This is a very light, floral brew that pours a clear light amber that is typical of the English Pale Ales. There's little head, and less lace, and by the smell, you'd almost think you were about to consume water laced with a hop or two and some lemon. The taste is fortunately more full-bodied, even complicated. It's not too bitter, but what bitterness there is sticks with you throughout. It does not fade. The sweetness, that floral taste, is of rose hips offset by a twist of lemon--a fun and tantalizing feature. The mouthfeel is light and more bubbly than I expected. A good brew, really--though costly over on this side of the Atlantic."
"Pours a medium brown with slight amber tones with a real nice big head,the aroma was more malty with some light hop aromas lingering.The taste up front is of lightly sweet malt with a hop smack that hits and lingers thru the finish.There is a winey,fruity undertone to this beer wich I like and havent tasted on any other pale,a good solid English classic."
"I realized recently, after reading an article about English ales, that I had never tried this one (despite the fact that I love Samuel Smith's beers). This is a very tasty (albeit subdued) ale. Typical butterscotch-like flavor (like a lot of other English ales), nice balance - which seems to be Smith's calling card. Goes down incredibly easy for an ale, which is the high point of this offering. Certainly nothing earth shattering, but holds up well against the competition (Fuller's, Young's etc.) As good as most pale ales I've had."
"Overall impression - A solid Sam Smiths offering. Less complex I thought then some of their other beers, but what it may not have had in the complexity department is made up in drinkability. A prototypical English pale ale."
"Poured a nice dark brown with a very small white head. Aroma was instantly of british hoppiness, with some maltiness in the background. Taste is nice & bitter up front, then finishes with a beautiful butterscotch taste. Nice carbonation and very clean mouthfeel too to make this one drinkable beer. Went great with some traditional style cheese fondue - I could have drank all night, but I was too stuffed after such a great meal!!"
"Its drinkable..but I would rather have an American Pale..this is below my expectations for Sam Smith."
"I found this beer to have a very smooth flavor to it along with a fruity aroma.There was no overwhelming bitter aftertaste observed with this beer.While I would not consider this to be an outstanding beer, it is one that I would consider drinking for the evening."
"Ah much better than that lousey Budweiser I just had. The aroma was very hard for me to place, but its color is a nice amber brown and yielded an invigorating head of small to medium light brown bubbles. A slightly above average taste yet very drinkable."
"Drinkability: Fairly good. This is a well made English pale ale. No great characteristics, but no serious flaws either. I could do without the astrigency on the finish, but it's a small issue in an otherwise solid brew."
"A rich bodied pale ale done just the way it should be. Big sweet malts come in first and are then met with hops. This is an english pale that defines the style. A little bit sweet, but definitely not cloying. It does have a somewhat nutty flavor. It seems like a bit of the nut brown was presenet in this one. This is one great ale."
"The beer is a deep copper color with a thin, but steady head. Its quite clear, and has medium carbonation. Aroma is a mix of floral hops and a sweet mustiness. The taste is exactly what Id expect from a good pale. Fine balance of hops and malt. Its a bit on the sweeter side, with a woody-nutty tone, and has a medium mouthfeel. Finish is a mildly hoppy, and could certainly stand additional bitterness. This is a pleasant, drinkable pale ale.no off-flavors, and its certainly better than average."
"Dark amber hue, a struggling head with spotted lacing. Faint, dull aroma, some hops and raisins tough to detect. English malts and hops, some fruit noted off the top, somewhat bitter, yearning for the hops. Some spices and a dry and rich body. Hoppy and bitter balanced makes it a good drink, anytime, anyplace. Another SS top quality brew, mark as a staple."
"Rich malty flavour balanced out nicely by the hops, goes down very easy and is quite refreshing. The malt definitelty dominates over the hop content in this pale ale. A formidable session brew."
"Deep amber color with a pillowy creamy white head on top. Nice malty aroma. The taste is pretty similar to some other english style PAs that ive had. A pretty malty taste with a nice blast of hops. I can definately picture myself having another one of these soon. Damn fine beer."
"The mouthfeel is nice and creamy, with medium carbonation. The carbonation is just a touch more than I'd like it to be, but I'm not really complaining."
"Finally, proof that my Samuel Smith run tonight was not in vain. This ale poured a copper color with a thick head that took forever to go away. The remnants followed the beer all the way down. Fragrant hops reach my nose from the glass. The taste is fantastic. Sharp, crisp, lightly bitter, and then gone, with a lingering maltiness and bitterness duking it out on the back of my tongue. This is what I like from a pale ale. Simply fantastic."
"A subtle yet charming brew that gives me what I think may just be a hint of what real cask beer in England might be like. I suspect that this ale loses a good deal on the trip overseas and even in being bottled rather than on tap or handpump in the motherland. (Incidentally, I have had a few bottles of this beer that were most likely lightstruck. I had reason to believe that this particular bottle was kept relatively protected from light and that seemed to be borne out in tasting.)"
"Hazy amber colored with a large off-white head, good carbonation, and lots of sticky lace. Substantial aroma of floral hops, lesser notes of malt. Tasting begins with toasted malts and slight fruit notes, soon the taste flows into mildly bitter hops. Finishes dry with dark malt notes. The mouth feel is quite pleasant. A rather fine pale ale."
"Pours with a nice off white head, slowly settling on top of beautifully clear golden-amber liquid tinged with red. Nose is the ""patented"" Sam Smith buttery/diacetyl, with grassy notes & little hop. Taste is marvelously smooth and fruity, nice gentle carbonation makes this go down quickly. Restrained but adequate hoppiness mixes nicely with a medium-bodied maltiness. Finishes slightly sweet, with a bit of dryness coming back after the swallow. All in all, a fine English-style Pale Ale, unique in character and taste."
"Cheers!!!"
"This brew poured a deep amber color with an impressive head. However it dwindled quickly leaving just a ring around the glass. The aroma was malt and maybe a little bit of maple or molasses. The smell was also a bit skunky, but it wasn't bad. The taste was a bit calm with nothing really jumping out at first. There is a little bit of sweet malt up front. The finish balances out well with just a little bit of a bitter hop taste. This beer goes down smooth with just the right amount of carbonation. I will probably drink this brew again. I'm not a big fan of Pales but this one was decent."
"Samuel Smiths is well known for its great beers and this ones no exception. Pours a hazy golden color with a thin, bubbly head that dissipates quickly, leaving a very thin lace on the glass. Nose is full of floral hops with small hints of sweet malts and caramel. Taste is sweet with mild hops. Very well balanced. This is a very smooth and refreshing brew."
"An excellent beer! I liked this better than the Nut Brown Ale, very smooth and drinkable. A good session ale."
"Regarding the clear bottles and skunkiness, I offer three possibilites. 1. I 've been incredibly lucky in never having a skunked Sam Smith. 2. Some reviewers imagine skunkiness at the sight of a clear bottle. 3. What some call skunkiness is the sulfur quality characteristic of many English ales."
"My least favorite Samuel Smith's beer, just too mild and pale for my taste, although perfect for what it tries to be. I compare all ""pale ales", sometimes unfavorably, against hoppier American craftbrew versions."
"The poured appearance is richly golden with a light amber hue (hey, I said it looked good), with a thick short-lived head. Aroma wasn't bad, but it was on the malty side -- not citrusy such as I expect with a Pale Ale. The taste was very Budweiser-esque, or warm canned Carling Black Label: overly sweet (corn, no doubt) with a putrid (skunky) finish. Carbonation, which may have helped this brew, was almost nonexistent."
"Personal notes: I didn't finish this. I'm not sure if the skunyness was due to the clear bottle or if this is on purpose."
"Drinkabilty: Definitely one of the more ""puckering"" type PA's I've had. This one really finishes dry. That was kind of a turn off for me."
"Clear bottle gold foil. Where is the beer here? What is up with the clear bottles? Reddish color, thin head, no lace. Barely perceptible malty aroma. Weak bitterness. I imagine a fine beer here out of respect for the brewers other products, but it must be the clear bottle that has sapped all the character from this beer. I cant believe I will bother much more with these brews. Why would I spend big money on them when their character is sapped by the brewer putting them in clear bottles? This is simply a waste of craftsmanship"
"I still have to say my favorite beer from Sam Smith's is the Oatmeal Stout. I have yet to try the Imperial Stout but have heard great things."
"Pours a slightly orange copper color with a thin white head that dissipates into a nice lace. Nose is sweet and fruity, almost candy like. Smells a lot like a Fruit Rollup. Taste is a sweet fruitiness up front with a touch of spice, a malty and bready middle, and a dry finish with a mild hop bitterness. Nice full mouth feel. A very nice pale ale!"
"-Oelergud"
"Id kill every one of you to try this on cask, seriously."
"A clear russet body (with orange highlights when held to the light) is topped by a rocky light tan head that holds quite well and leaves excellent lace. The nose displays an earthy malt and lightly grassy hops as well as an affirmative diacetyl / butterscotch note. The body is medium light, and combines with a very fine & gentle carbonation to create a nicely creamy mouthfeel. The flavor is mainly of a lightly caramel & biscuity malt that's enhanced by a touch of buttery diacetyl, a distinct earthiness, some mild fruitiness, a light hop flavor and a firm balancing bitterness. In the finish, the hoppiness combines with the sweet buttery malt to give a light spiciness on the tongue and throat similar to that of black licorice candy. A really enjoyable English pale that probably deserves more attention than it gets."
"A truly great English Pale Ale, a taste of home and simply just, well -Bloody Marvellous."
"Hazy, amber/orangish in color, with an off-white head. The aroma is full of grain and fruity, floral hops. The taste is of caramel malt, as well as grain. The hop flavor is floral. Hop bitterness is medium, subdued by the malt flavors. It is a medium-bodied brew with light carbonation. Overall, it is an easy drinking, well balanced English Pale Ale."
"As always this was a great product from Sam Smiths! A classic Engligh Pale Ale packed with flavour! This beer poured a beautiful copper colour and smelled of hops and malts. It tasted wonderfully sharp and had a nice level of carbonation as well. This had a very big creamy mouthfeel and an awesome drinkability to boot. One of the best Pale Ales!"
"The color on the pour a translucent burnished copper, the head mountainous in size, the consistency is that of butter crème frosting with thick glutinous sheets of lace to envelope the glass, both a light tan color. Nose malt, and sweet black walnuts, pleasing to the old nose. First taste is ambrosial, top is fair to middling in mouth feel, the finish is enchantingly hopped, charmingly acidic, delightfully dry aftertaste. What a Wonderful World it would be if all beers were as masterfully brewed as Samuel Smiths Bravo to the brewers of this most exquisite line of beers, a regular on my Beer Shopping List!"
"It seems I can get this regularly in Ottawa, I just have to pay through the nose at Pub Italia... Still a fantastic beer. One of my favourites, now. The colour is quite distinctive, after a year in England I don't think I ever found another beer with quite the same appearance. I certainly didn't find many with the same abundance of flavour. While I dearly love the crazy hoppy pale ales we produce on this side of the Atlantic, there really is something to be said for a more subtle, complex ale like this one. It reaches Orval-like heights of elusiveness of flavour and impressions. Two beers that are hard to pinpoint because you always notice something different when drinking them. But both beers I can't do without (and can't buy in stores here)."
"Great beer. Prosit."
"Fresh hop nose.  Lasting slightly tan thick head.  Red crystal clear look with lots of little bubbles in the glass.  Toasted malt husk taste with some bitterness in the finish . Lively mouth but it does lack any real tongue coverage.  This brew is above average, but is not a ""special"" pale ale.  This style is so competitive and this beer does not ""stand out"" it just ""hangs out"".  It is a solid beer, but not one I'd buy again for the money in relation to local american competition."
"Creamy fat head rests over an English amber liquid explosion of flavor. Rich and mellow buttery caramel spine is superbly balanced against loamy hops all mineral-like and tasty. Subdued carbonation makes it a pleasure to coat your throat with this stirring pale."
"Light carbonation on the tongue with a delicious mild hop flavor. Nothing overpowering and exceptionally smooth. Just another ""common"" kick-ass brew from the Old Brewery."
"Brew pours a deep copper color with a faomy thick head wafting the malty aroma all the beers from Samuel Smith seem to exude.  Smooth body with a buttery sweet malty flavor.  The sweet spicy hop profile blends well with the malt to create a tasty easy-drinking pale.  I enjoyed this much."
"Amber-orange color with an off white head that stays thick.  Why use clear bottles?  Preserving the freshness of the beer is much more important than being able to see the color through the bottle before buying or pouring it.  A bit of skunky aroma escaped when the bottle was opened, but it went away quickly.  My aroma rating would definitely be higher if it wasn't for that.  Sweet and fruity malt and subtle spicy hops in the nose, similar to other Samuel Smith brews.  Extremely well balanced flavor profile packed into a medium body.   Malty grain sweetness is almost one with the slight spicy hop character.  Very traditional feel.  Nice and refreshing, just an all-around pleasure to drink.  Good session brew, too.  A craft beer classic!"
"My bottle was slightly skunked (they love those clear bottles at Sam Smith's),but even that aside I was kind of disappointed at the quality, given how much I love their Oatmeal and Imperial Stouts. The aroma was malty and had a stale aspect to it. The flavor was lacking in hops but still managed some bitterness in the finish. All in all I expected better."
"Pours a clear but dark caramel color with a 2 finger head that that leaves a lace all the way down.  The appearance is beautiful!  The smell is slightly fruity and lightly hoppy.  The taste is consistant with the smell but also reveals a malty taste and mouthfeel.  It surprisingly doesn't finish as dry/hoppy as some other pale ales that I've tried.  I wasn't overly impressed, but wasn't too disappointed either.  Cheers!"
"This is beer I last had on tap in Lincoln, England.  In a bottle here, it poured a nice amber color and formed an off white head with some nice lace.  The aroma was of hops and some fruit(non-citrus).  The flavor sweet and of hops, malt and caramel.  Finish was a bit sweeter than I usually expect in pale ales.  A good beer, but definately over here in the States in a bottle, a different brew."
"Clear and amber, spicy aroma and 1/4 inch pillowy head.  Hops in the flavor are restrained, malts are more niticeable and a little like pumpkin pie filling.  Not a lot of finish despite a medium-bodied mouthfeel.  but there is little fade in the mouth.  Pretty good balance in the hop/malt arena but then again Sam knows what they're doing.  I tend to prefer American Pales but would love to try this stuff on tap."
"Overall, an everyman's beer. (Or it should be instead of commercial swill).  Nice balance of malt and hops.  Not very assertive, as it mellows with any food.  This beer has a creamy texture for a pale ale, but with enough bite to keep it going."
"Round and balanced mouthfeel.  High acidity, medium to high bitterness shows great balance. The toffee, orangey, toasty taste make this another of the old tadcaster brewerey must do's. Very well balanced between malt and hops. Dry, hoppy finish."
"Not my favourite, but i got a feeling that the place that served it hadn't cleaned there equipment for a while, coz it tasted off, so thats what my ratings based on."
"Copper in color and very clear.  Moderate, but persistent head.  Unfortunately, this bottle was a tad skunked (you might get lucky and get a better bottle) What would be a leafy and earthy Fuggles hop nose has become masked by skunky mercaptans.  The skunkiness does dissapate as the beer breathes, and thankfully signature fruity British yeast esters and a butterscotch note assert themselves. Luckily, the skunkiness didn't make its way into the flavor.  The moderate hop bitterness is quite clean and adequately balances sweetness from crystal malt and residual sugars left by the yeast. Pleasant mild diacetyl rounds out the flavor.  This pale finishes w/ dry biscuit malt notes.  The skunkiness prevented this from reaching its potential.  My suggestion is to pour the entire bottle into an imperial pint glass and let it ""breathe"" for several minutes before tasting."
"There's not much head to this beer at all, although I've come to not expect much in the head department from Samuel Smith. What it lacks in head, it makes up (partly) in coloration with it's nice medium brown transparent color. It feels really smooth on the tongue, which is nice. The taste starts out sweet and malty and then you notice a bit of roastiness. The bitterness is very mild. I'm not overly big on Pale Ales, but this is a good pale ale."
"Notes: Clean to the tongue with lots of complexity, perfect quaffing material ... A Pale Ale to reckon with."
"Somewhat on the tart side.  Seemed to be a little more flavorful as it warmed."
