It was a rather impromptu decision to attend the game in the first play, but once we got there we searched high and low for something on the crafty side.  This was clearly our best option, but for the $13 each we paid, it was made that much more bittersweet.  The aroma and flavoring were pretty generic, and the hearty toast of those adjuncts effectively blocked out any balancing hoppiness lingering in the background.  We were glad to get to sip on something more our style, and something local, during the game, but with that markup it clearly wasn’t worth it.","TheBrewo","Feb 07, 2015"

A drinkable pale with enough malt to balance the hops is what I look for and this is one of those brews.","The-Adjunct-Hippie","Nov 20, 2014"

There's a pretty awesome amount of lacing down the glass. The smell and taste is pretty unique. Not sure of the hops or malts they use in this one, but seeing it labelled an English Pale Ale makes sense to me. Caramel and maybe some munich malts with herbal hops and a kind of citrus rind bitterness that's not too heavy makes for a solid, flavorful, easy-drinking beer. I was disappointed at first thinking it was an IPA (since I was told it was), but this is pretty tasty for the style. Quite nicely done.","Alextricity","Aug 24, 2014"

3.72,0.5,4,3.75,3.75,3.25,3.75,"Pours out to a frothy, sticky head that leaves significant lace, Color is hazy copper. Aroma is a balanced blend of sweet, biscuity malts and subtle earthy/floral hops. Flavor is a balanced blend of caramel malt and noble hop bitterness and aroma. Very much an old school US craft beer in terms of hop characteristics--moderate bitterness and no loud, weird new breed domestic hop signatures (pine, grapefruit, sharp spiciness etc.). Mouthfeel is light-medium and CO2 is at American levels. Overall a very good American-ish EPA that nods to British restraint. If you like Boulevard Pale Ale, this is a good choice for you.","EagleTalon","Mar 29, 2014"

Pours lightly hazy golden orange color with a 2 finger dense and rocky off white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a small cap that lasts. Spotty foamy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of orange zest, grapefruit, lemon zest, pear, apple, floral, grass, toast, biscuit, light caramel, and floral/yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with balanced malt and hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of grapefruit, lemon zest, orange zest, pear, apple, floral, grass, toast, biscuit, light caramel, and floral earthiness. Light earthy floral bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, lemon/orange zest, pear, apple, toast, biscuit, light caramel, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance and complexity of citrus/earthy hops and bready malt flavors; with a nice malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy, smooth, and moderately crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice English pale ale. Good balance and complexity of malt and hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 30, 2014"

I definitely smell some pineapple and maybe a little orange. Taste is slightly malty with a nice slightly bitter hop bill that let's a little of the nice sweet fruit in. Mouthfeel is fairly normal for the style if not a little thicker which is nice. This is the Minnesota beer almost everybody started drinking first long ago. Great beer that has been a staple for probably 20 years.","NeedBeerHere","Dec 08, 2013"

The aroma of this beer was mild, malted grain, fresh bread and some floral hops. Light in body, malted grain base, cereal grains, and a mild hop bite. Semi dry finish- excellent representative of the style. Great, session ale, would be a wonderful entry level craft beer for a Bud drinker. Overall, this is not the best English Style Pale Ale, but it is above average and worth a try.","GossageBrewery","Sep 08, 2012"

Most of the time it has been excellent although I am not sure it ages well. I have had a number of them that have not tasted that fresh. When fresh on tap, it is an excellent choice for an IPA lover. The appearance is a somewhat light and clear pale ale, but a pretty good balance of hops to barley. It has a decent aroma, but is not the best I have had. One good thing is that it has a fairly full body, but doesn't get you loaded after one or two pints.","tjhuot","Feb 05, 2012"

The head is thick and foamy, like old school shaving cream, with sticky lacing. Really gorgeous. There's a playfull level of carbonation along with the beer. From an appearance standpoint this one is really solid. I think of picnics when I smell the beer, specifically honeydew melon, maybe cantelope. There's a hint of lightly sweet bready malt in the background as well. Lightly carbonated with a fizzy mouthfeel and a moderate amount of bitterness at the end. Nice malt sweetness helps to balance this out. Taste is pretty solid, with citrus-style hop characteristic up front followed by malt sweetness. I'm picking up some dried fruit - apricots maybe - the more I drink it. The main flaw with this beer is that it doesn't have quite enough body to stand up to everything that's going on - the whole experience, from start to finish, is gone in a flash, which requires multiple sips to really capture what's going on. I'm guessing that's kind of the point.","eclaycamp","Sep 28, 2010"

Nice clean malty grainy hoppy smell. It tastes very clean and crisp. Some tangy fruity flavors are picked up first. Then It blends into a pleasantly balanced sweet, malty, biscuity flavor that is mixed with a spicy bitterness. Good beer flavor throughout. It ends very crisp and dry with a clean bubbly mouthfeel that makes the drinkability very easy. To sum it up, it is a good beer with clean straight forward beer flavors.

Aroma is a bit underwhelming, with notes of butterscotch in the forefront. Taste exhibits a nice level of hoppiness up front, and subdued malts in the background, along with a hint of a metallic aftertaste. Mouthfeel is a bit thin for what I expect in this style. Overall, this is far from the best example of a pale ale I've ever had. On the other hand, it's still a pleasant enough brew, and has above average drinkability.","bristol2120","Aug 02, 2010"

Definitely lacking in the nose department. Not a whole lot of carbonation to this. Taste is very thin and watery, with a slight metallic taste. Again, no hops to speak of nor malt flavors. All in all, a very boring, bland beer. If I hadn't known better, I'd have assumed someone added food coloring to a bud light.

Hops are there, but not overpowering, mostly the bitter/herbal variety, backed up by a light, bready maltiness. Taste is crisp and refreshing. Hop bitterness is low, but decent hop flavor. Lightly toasted malts, but a bit thin for my liking. This is beer that is a regular for me. I do really like it, and it's hard to find a better American representation of the style.

There is a slight fruity presence, but the hops rule. The mouthfeel is refreshing. The crispness I usually taste with Summit beers is absent here, but that only emphasizes the difference from the usual EPA.

I also pick up a subtle spice here. Very decent for a reasonably tastey brew that is very drinkable. Hoppy enough to bring a little sourness into the equation.

The beer has a copper color with moderate prickel and a light head. The nose is mildly hoppy. The attack is consistent with the nose but starts off with an understate sweet malt flavor that perhaps brings to mind some fruit. The flavor is smooth and the finish is a bit tart with some residual hops. Mildly bitter aftertaste and decent beer. This beer obviously has broad appeal because you can find it virtually everywhere in the Twin Cities to include public events such as sporting events, concerts and the State fair. It is for this reason that I will have to upgrade what I normally would have given the beer in drinkability from 4.0 to 4.5. Its quite obviously very drinkable.","Ragingbull","Aug 03, 2008"
3.68,-0.5,3.5,3,4,3.5,4,"Extra Pale Ale, not quite sure what that means except perhaps the hop characteristic is to be more mellow, which is the case with this solid ale. Aroma is faint and bitter not too much to detect outside of a typical pale ale. Poured a vibrant copper color with an enormous head that soon settled. Strong carbonation and lots of sticky lacing. Mouthfeel is bitter and crisp with a somewhat clean finish. A well rounded flavor makes this one good beer. Citrus and bitter hops are there but they fade out after they make their presence known. Good malty backbone sure compliments the hops, very well balanced and drinkable. Spicy and peppery this one wakes up the senses but it doesn't send them into shock.","kinger","Aug 03, 2008"

Taste begins with a funky sour grapefruit with toasted grains. Midway the caramel malt emerges with a dry metallic flavor. Aftertaste is dry and tastes a bit like sawdust...ehhh.

Pretty sweet overall. Intially a sweet hit of caramel and biscuit flows over the tongue in the form of pale malts, a teensy moment of toffee appears after before giving way to a grassy, slight hop bite that's just a bit too muted for my liking. Also a minor orange note, then finishes dry with a caramel twang. Has a lightly creamy mouthfeel, slightly resinous, with a fair amount of carbonation. Nicely balanced throughout and quite quaffable.

The flavor is finely balanced; there are rich malt overtones, but enough hops to keep it interesting. After drinking a lot of "hop soup" lately on the IPA circuit, its a pleasure to find this well-crafted, humble gem. It's available pretty much anywhere in Minnesota, often the only alternative to macro brew, for which I am grateful. At 5.1%, and with its balanced flavor, it is very drinkable.

Many first-timers feel EPA to be a bit too chewy, and that first impression remains with a few of them ever after. As for myself I've enjoyed so much of this fine brew over the past twenty years that it hardly impinges upon my sessioning as such, but I will acknowledge its heft and complexity to the palate of the many, many neophytes: it's a great beer to cut your ale-teeth on! There has also always been an *excellent* hop profile to EPA, something that initially snares the Pilsener-lovers (for one) and reels them in . . .only to later confounded them with the mildly-fruity characteristics of ale! Not a light or 'thin' brew at all, but a long ways from a strong ale, and lacking in the richer malt complexity of certain of the British renditions. I'd call this the 'hall monitor' of ales, to whit: once you've passed the gateway, once you've left the training wheels at home, Summit EPA will be the beer to keep you on track through the sometimes weedy, sometimes downright rough halls of Aledom (where's Perry King?) Also, from its looks alone EPA could pass for an all-malt Amber Lager ala Boston Lager, and I've often seen folks mistake two freshly-poured taps of these in a dimly-lit bar with a hilarious result! Am I waxing nostalgic already? Yes, apologies all-around, and my sincere apologies to Mr. Grossman and his fine flagship ale but . . . my sense of hometown pride would be sorely abused if I didn't admit that I prefer our local 300 lb gorilla to his 900 lb offering! Fact is, Summit was the first American Pale Ale I'd tried and remains my personal benchmark for the style. The fact that I can get this in 50% of the bars in Minnesota, in one form or another (and usually quite fresh, and with clean lines : ), only makes me prouder of the work that the folks at Summit have done over the years.

The taste is a well balanced mix of sweet malt and citric hop. The mouth is left crisp as a slight hop lingers on awhile. The drinkability, oh ya! A good mix that goes well with itself and a meal.

Some small amounts of lacing down the side of the glass, but limited due to the low head generation. Smell is yeasty with some clear citrus notes. Also a very small amount of hop floral character as an understated backdrop. Pleasant, but not overwhelming. Taste is of well balanced maltiness up front, followed by distinctly bitter hop tones. The bitterness seems to also have notes of orange peel or other citrus-generated bitterness. Finishes dry and somewhat sour. Overall, a very good, very complex balance of flavors. Mouthfeel is slightly thin, and carbonation is quite high. Not quite beyond the line into over-carbonation, but definitely on the high side.

Long dry finish.  I like how the bitterness mellows as it warms.  This is a good beer, I guess I just enjoy others versions of pale ale better.","garymuchow","Beers"
4.62,24.9,4,4.5,5,4,4.5,"Absolutely the grapefruity-chewy ale of choice for me, frankly clobbers Sierra Nevada in my book...nice aroma and a clear medium amber color. I'm currently living in Minnesota but I wasn't looking for a beer this good when I moved here. A really distinct example of an American Pale...hoppy, to be sure, but with a good deal of nutty malts, superior fruitiness, and a complexity all the way to the aftertaste...a very refreshing beer on tap, but with enough guts to last through Fall...","ADR","0"
