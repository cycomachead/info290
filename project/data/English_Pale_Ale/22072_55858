Really, though, that's the case with many members of Revolution's standard rotation: tasty, drinkable, and of an even, dependable quality, but decidedly less avant garde than the brewery's name might suggest.  This is, again, not a slight: it's just a necessary remark in a region that boasts such heavy-hitting tinkerers and boundary-pushers as Three Floyds, Half Acre, Off Color, Two Brothers, and even (when considering the stuff they still brew in Chicago) Goose Island.","OrestesMethuon","Beers"

Pours lightly hazy/cloudy bright golden color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of big orange peel, grapefruit, lemon zest, orange rind, floral, grass, wheat, light honey, and floral earthiness. Very nice aromas with big citrus hop presence and moderate malt balance; with good strength. Taste of orange zest, tangerine, grapefruit, lemon zest, floral, grass, bread, wheat, light honey, and floral earthiness. Slight floral bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, floral, grass, bread, wheat, light honey, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity of citrus hop flavors with a moderate malt balance; with good flavor robustness and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a very smooth and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice blond ale! All around good balance and complexity of hop and malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Oct 06, 2013"

Smell is of malt, fruits, and citrus zest. Taste is much the same with a mild hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is light and refreshing.","UCLABrewN84","Nov 30, 2012"

Plenty of lacing left behind. Nose starts with faint green hop presence and lemon, sturdy bread presence as well. Smells fresh and tasty. Taste starts off with light caramel sweetness followed by fruity hops. Moderate amount of bitterness comes through and is countered by dry bready finish. Everything is working in balance here, and there is quite a bit of character for a blonde ale. Mouthfeel is light with moderate to high carbonation. A solid brew from an amazing brewery.","homebrew311","Aug 13, 2012"

3.85,2.7,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Gotta love any beer that references William Jennings Bryan, amiright? This stuff pours a clear golden brass topped by a finger or so of white foam. The nose comprises light citrus (I hate being that vague, but, frankly, the citrus smell was that vague, so...), light biscuit, and a very slight hint of lemongrass. The taste brings in more of the same, with the biscuit and citrus (now mostly identified as a lemon-orange blend) leading the way in geminic (yeah, I just coined a new word, folks!) harmony. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a crisp, lightly dry finish. Overall, a nice, simple, straightforward little blonde, one I wouldn't mind spending some more time with later...","TMoney2591","Jun 18, 2012"

3.78,0.8,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"I've had this one a number of times. Usually when I feel like bouncing around their beer menu for the day, and I've already had their Porter, IPA, and whatever's on cask . The last time I had it, I was informed by my server that the batch was not only really fresh, but was a generation zero yeast crop. The spankin-new yeast produced a product that was far crisper, clearer, and cleaner than any other trial with this ale. The near absent bitterness and hop profile were suddenly quite apparent, and I even detected some fun little spicy esters, though very mild. Near-brilliant gold in color, and exceptionally drinkable. It's downfall is that it's just not that interesting a brew, which is why it's also their no.2 most popular. It's the "fun microbrew option" for your mojito drinking gal pals, though again, it's not bad either.","Hopfist","Jul 21, 2011"

The nose is a bit light and then hits fairly well with a nice hop aroma resembling the better versions of the style that I've encountered. Milt citrus with a bit of tangerine.

When I first had this beer, I thought I was drinking an IPA; my server told me that it's actually a lager which is brewed with "a bit" of hops. Needless to say, I thought that it had more than "a bit" of hops. This is a unique beer that you will find enjoyable if you don't mind what would seem like a mis-categorization. I rated this beer highly because I liked it even though it doesn't seem to fit what the brewers call an "American Pale/Blonde Ale."","diabecktic","0"
