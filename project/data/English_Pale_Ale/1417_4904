The aroma was malty with a hint of fruit hut all in all the aroma is low with a very little citrusy hop presence. Taste is malt forward rich bread and caramel notes throughout the palate. Bitterness is strong which leaves a nice dry finish. A very refreshing sessionable beer that is one on my favorite English bitters I had while in the UK.","CStang67","Feb 21, 2015"

4.1,10.5,4,4,4,4,4.5,"500 ml bottle into pint glass, L31 bottle code. Pours slightly hazy deep orange/copper color with a 1-2 finger dense and fluffy off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, toast, brown bread, light nuttiness, herbal, grass, light pepper, light pear/apple, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with well balanced dark/bready malt, earthy hop, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, toast, brown bread, nuttiness, herbal, grass, light pepper, light pear/apple, and yeast earthiness. Light earthy herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, brown bread, nuttiness, herbal, grass, light pepper, light pear/apple, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice robustness and balance of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester notes; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Quite restrained on yeast fruitiness which was surprising. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish as expected of 4.4%. Overall this is an excellent English bitter style. All around great robustness and balance of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 12, 2014"

APPEARANCE: orange-amber, semi-translucent body akin to tea; white, frothy, thin head; lacing twists and turns somewhat seductively... AROMA: luxuriant scotch-like notes; light, buttery English muffin; some malty elements too--attractive... PALATE: active, medium-bodied and drinkable; a pub compatriot for certain...TASTE: buttery, slightly doughy malts as an ESB would be; mellow with an unmistakable, oaky, highland fortitude; a dry, thin finish akin to sherry--though not nearly as powerful... OVERALL: A pleasant draught from a brewery I've had little else from, but in seeking to rate this beer (one I'd last drunk in 2005, if my records are accurate), I am pleased with the experience; it's no nonsense, light fragrance invites quick sips and rewards with thirst-quenching malts and enough hops to achieve a worthwhile balance ....","dacrza1","Feb 04, 2014"

This stuff pours a clear brass topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises lightly-toasted biscuit, mild grass, and sweet flowers. The taste brings in more of the same, with a stronger vein of sweetness stemming from the biscuit, though this serves only to perfectly balance the grassy and flowery hops. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a smooth feel. Overall, this stuff is not gonna set the world on fire, by any means, but it is a very tasty, very easy-to-drink little brew. Something tells me it would taste just grand (Wow, did I just say that?

4.32,16.4,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"In a blind taste test, even I could pick out the country: England. Far more than some other Pale Ales, Black Sheep has the aroma and flavor profile of a bitter or an ESB. That esthery smell, with yeast and caramel malt, is one of a kind. Complex flavor. You'd think this is a dark, almost black beer from the name, but no, just the classic copper look with a fine head, classic being the key term. The dark brown bottle simply preserves the freshness better. A solid recommendation here.","angusdegraosta","Jan 17, 2012"

Pours a nice amber, not copper colored, but not as pale as some pale ales from England either. A medium head that eventually fades away away to nothing. Very little of the often present metallic aroma in present, but there is a bit of a buttery note that is not out of place in the style, as well as some earthiness, some clean graininess, and a decent bitterness, particularly on the finish. A light biscuity sweetness on the palate as well, but that plays well with the hops. The more I drink of this, the more I like it- always a good sign.","Georgiabeer","Jul 27, 2011"

Flavor is balanced not overly sweet or bitter in either direction, very much an English session ale finishes pretty dry. Some definite hop character with some mineral water tones, a bit of caramelized fruit and earthy herbal hop flavor blend nicely. Mouthfeel is well rounded medium bodied dry semi bitter finish left behind on the palate between each sip.

Medium-bodied, dry and, even with above average carbonation, seems reluctant to move forward. Same crisp, sour profile of sourdough, rye, pumpernickel bread, gets drier and drier with each sip.

It poured hazy orange with almost one finger of off white head that stuck around just for a bit. Nose is malty, sweet and has a bit of sour note in there like the vinegar you use for deep fried fish. Taste is different than I expected and dissimilar from other pale ales that I've had. That sour note I detected in my nose comes through as slightly acidic, pleasant and altogether unique. Predominant flavor is a dry slightly roasted malt backbone supported by bittering hops. Mouthfeel is medium light and the carbonation light and very fine.

The first taste is firm malt grain and wheat bread with a very fine carbonation. It's a pretty clean flavor, with a vague smokiness, almost peaty. The body feel is nice middle of the road, drinkable stuff. Not too much sweetness here, some grassy dryness but not too much. Likeable ale, definitely recommended.

More malty characteristics came through with some bitterness. The overpowering bitter finish isn't there making it smooth and complex. A very good example of an English Pale Ale.

Perhaps this was because I gave this one more time to sit. Anyway, the cool thing about this beer is that I tasted and smelled flavors I've never tasted or smelled in beer before. The smell was like an English garden--lemongrass, cut grass, lemon thyme, orange blossom, and something floral like lavender, honeysuckle, or heather. The beer tasted great! It was well balanced between the carmelly and slightly buttery malts, the bitter and citrusy hops, and then, coming through toward the end of the glass, lemons, grapefruits, and tangerines. Also toward the end of the glass, a new garden smell came through--Mint. Really! My wife commented that it smelled more like clover, but I swear it was mint and could almost start to tast it. This beer started out so-so, but finished grand. All in all, it did very well with the somewhat greasy shepherd's pie that had cheddar cheese, onions, tabasco, and herbed mashed potatos.

This poured very smoothly into my glass and gave birth to a billowing bright white head full of tiny bubbles and leaving rings of lacing. Copper coloured beer, hints of light red and tangerine orange. Clear and rich looking liquid. The head settles permanently as a centimetre-thick cream top to the beer. There is really nothing else for which you could ask apropos of this beer's appearance for the style. The aroma is burnt biscuit malt, with plently of the expected toffee and caramel notes, but all very well balanced with some earthy almost continental-style hopping, but they are Goldings. Complex fruitiness almost like an ESB, nutty brown bread. A little flowery sometimes, but the dark fruits make the malt intensely appetising. The taste up front is burnt toffee maltiness: quite bitter from the beginning. In the middle is the sweetness of the malt, honeyed, and the Goldings adding a big dash of dryness right to the end. The finish leaves a strong, mouth-puckering dryness, with tastes of sticky malt and a little citrus. A very good English pale. Medium carbonation and good drinkability, with plenty of complexity at 4.4%. Lovely drink. Paired interestingly with brie cheese.","Cwrw","Oct 17, 2005"

This clear, amber brew has a great half-inch head of foam that is sustained for a few minutes and some nice lacing is left down the sides of the glass as the head falls. The aroma is weak, but bits of fruity esters and woody hops are present. My tongue is greeted by sweet malt and spicy hops (unusual for a British ale) followed by a fairly assertive and somewhat tannic hop bitterness that teases the side of tongue and dries out the mouth; this an unpleasant effect.

The first couple of sips seem overly bitter, but then as Black Sheep warms up, a nice fruity malt flavor comes to life. A decent English hop flavor comes in towards the finish. Still, I find this a little too bitter and hopped for the style. Which is strange, because I love an APA to be this hoppy.

It looks good for the type, slightly redder than usual, but with a nice head at the start. Retention lessens as the glass is emptied. As others have said, it has more effervescence than is ordinary, prompting more burps than the usual English cask ale. It's a nice beer, lots of different tastes, quite distinct hops, surprisingly warming, a good one to have drink at the Old Bell Tavern on a cold night in the Yorkshire winter. Carbonation does not spoil the mouthfeel but it is unusual. Overall, this is a true real ale that some Northerners would die for, and for good reason.

Though it won't be my highest rated, nor perhaps my favourite(though it will be damn close), this will perhaps be my most respected. Pours a ruby orange colour, with a head that's not quite two fingers. Plenty of victorian lace sticks to the glass, giving the impression that doilies are stuck on the glass. Beautiful to look at. First smell. Oooh, pleasant. I have the feeling after I eventually finish this divine nectar, my nose will still be inside the glass, sniffing at what once was. Big, bold malts, yeast and butter that reminds me of a bakery. Light pears and green apples. Even toffee. Smell this beer and the mind wanders to an old England countryside, where bicycles still outnumber the automobile. The taste. Oh, the taste. Beautiful. Big malt profile upfront, mellowed by a diacetyl flavour and texture. Soon follows a light fruit presence. Pears, apples and even a bit of apple cider. Toffee on the tongue as well, accompanied by a dark friend. Is it coffee? Could it be dark chocolate? I can't quite tell, but I also don't care. It's enjoyable, that's all that matters. For simplicity, I'll say it's both. Smooth, full bodied and heavy mouthfeel that gives the illusion I'm not drinking beer, I'm drinking nectar given by God himself. Drinkable. Too damn drinkable and too damn good. I've got half a glass left, and I don't want to finish it, knowing that once it's finished, it's gone. And I can't get another bottle for quite some time. A terrific beer. I highly suggest seeking this out to anyone and everyone who likes a good, wholesome ale.","slitherySOB","Oct 19, 2004"

Odd aroma for an English ale, with nectarines, and what seems to be a tart apple note dominating the nose over the usual malts. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, smooth, and even. Taste is slightly bitter, with some funky hops going on. Malt profile is some very faint caramel. Earthy yeastiness, and some wild fruitiness provide most of the flavors. The hoppiness seems more herbal than fruity or floral in the taste. Spearmint comes to mind. It's light and refreshing and finishes with a herbal bitterness.

Freshly yeasty up front in the aroma, with mild breadiness... not much malt to speak of; hops are soft and fruity with a green-apple character. Flavor is also yeasty at the outset; immediately this is a very British pale ale. With warmth, flavors emerge suggesting rye bread (caraway seeds) and fruit, particularly green apple and even banana (?). Leafy hop with a twang that develops substantially with warmth. Mouthfeel is firm, smooth; lightly carbonated and with a decent hop tingle; aftertaste lingery with some chewiness. Good drinkability; after sampling the first half of the bottle for review, I matched up the rest of this beer with a pot roast, to very good effect.
