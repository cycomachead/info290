3.58,12.6,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"375 ml bottle into pint glass, best after 8/22/2013. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy golden straw color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of lemon, pear, apple, cracker, bread, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste lemon, pear, apple, cracker, lightly toasted bread, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Light earthy herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, pear, apple, cracker, lightly toasted bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Good balance and robustness of pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and slightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 4.5%. Overall this is a very solid English pale ale style. All around good balance and robustness of pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 21, 2015"

Has a lovely appearance with the top fermenting and secondary fermenting process giving this one that distinctive Cooper's cloudy appearance. Nice aromas with noticeable hops and malts but really nice how this one does not go overboard with the bitter taste. It really finds a nice balance and this is one of Cooper's most easy-drinking beers and should be suitable for most palates. This is more of an entry-level beer for a brewer that does some interesting things and should be recommended to anyone that wants to try something other than the multitude of lagers and carbonated lagers that are available. Having a really pale ale like this one is a nice change with a nice head, nice taste and strikes a beautiful balance. This is highly recommended for those wanting a step up from the ordinary lager but someone who doesn't have as much experience as other drinkers. It's a solid beer.","Gazza","Jul 01, 2012"

The flavor gives a pretty good grassy kick, again a dry hop effect, fairly sharp and no sweetness. It's hard to pick up much else, a little malt maybe way in the background, and a clove-orange hint if you stretch your imagination. It has a spicy overtone, fair carbonation in a mid to light body.

The taste really accented the bitterness of hops also, leaving almost no trace of malt, or pine or citrus or anything else. It's crisp, if not a little bit fizzy on the tongue.

This bottle shows a more lively (yet still thin) body throughout than my last bottle, maybe due to younger bottling yeasts. I wouldn't say I'd love this beer as of its own category, but for what it is and the brewery's consistent efforts to make good ales, one has to try this beer to form his/her own fair judgement.

Lemon citris hops, slightly herbal i suppose, balanced out by nutty, somewhat grainy malts, and I can't pick up much of that yeastiness I poured. Finishes smooth and crisp.

The color is yellow with a deep orange tint. The aroma is somewhat cidery. Hmm, this beer does not quite want to leave an impression on me, a bare wisp of malt sweetness, and it quickly disappears. There are some fruit/citrus flavors here, but little aftertaste of hops, in fact not much taste at all. Fairly smooth mouthfeel, which just helps it leave the palate that much more quickly. I guess youd call this a session beer, because there isnt much to it.","jackndan","Oct 17, 2003"
2.95,-7.2,3,3,3,2.5,3,"Appearance: Cloudy golden orange tint with a nice creamy textured white head, no lacing forms on this one. Aroma: A slight citrus note here a bit zesty with deep bready malt tones heavy sediment as well adds to the breadiness I speak of. Taste: A mild biscuit sweetness with some balancing light hops main component here is the yeast and malt tones providing for a bready finish and overall profile in the flavor. Mouthfeel: Somewhat of a residual texture that coats the tongue not bad at all very nice crisp tone brought on by the medium body and mild carbonation. Drinkability: Not crazy but solid ale from Austrailia just glad to see another brand other than Foster's on American shores.","WVbeergeek","Oct 15, 2003"
3.62,13.8,3,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Another good Cooper's beer. Probably a bit less than the Sparkling Ale, but I don't think the gap is that great. I'll probably definitely have this one again.","beergeek279","Sep 26, 2003"

3.45,8.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Had a friend who drank this alot on tap in Australia during a recent trip. We finally located the beer here in Chicago, and he claims it tastes pretty much the same as in Aust. The beer pours a slightly hazy pale golden with a bit of sediment if you look close. This is what I call a slammer beer. Not overly memorable, but real easy to drink. I'd be happy to shoot some pool and suck a few of these down in a dark Aussie pub. The nose is rather malty and hints of sweet corn. The taste also is a bit malty/corny with just a faint bit of cloying fruitiness and not much in the way of hops. My only fear is that in a lot of brews that I encounter this malty/corny character I find that it means adjunct/filler and hence-headache. I call it the PBR syndrome. Never drink more than three in a sitting! I don't think I'll drink more that two or three of these at time to play it safe. Not a bad little slammer though all in all.","moulefrite","Aug 30, 2003"
2.74,-13.8,2,3,2.5,3,3,"Pours a hazy light gold color with a medium off-white head. Aroma is a little citrusy and a little hoppy, but neither is very assertive. Thin- to medium-bodied, with flavors of hops, wheat and fruit. Finish is a little flat and fruity. I enjoyed their Stout but this beer leaves a lot to be desired.","Dogbrick","May 12, 2003"
3.5,10.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a murky light golden color with a medium-sized white head and lively carbonation. Flakes of sediment rise and fall in the streams of carbonation, rendering the appearance of a snow globe. The lacing is quite good. Aroma consists of bready yeast and citrus hops. Taste begins with lively carbonation, light malts, and lemony hops. The hops dominate the taste towards the dry finish, leaving in their wake a crisp citrus oil bitterness. The mouth feel is creamy and pleasant. A refreshing warm weather beer.","Pegasus","Apr 06, 2003"
3.6,13.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a hazy golden color with tiny yet noticeable flakes of sediment floating in the beer. The head is creamy white and fades into a good amount of lace. Nose is sourdough bread and a bit of citrusy hops. Taste starts off with sweet malts and a mild fruitiness followed by some nutty yeast flavors. Some bitter hops and acidic lemon notes come through in the end leaving a crisp finish. A pretty nice pale ale but nothing special.","Morris729","Mar 27, 2003"
3.1,-2.5,3.5,3.5,3,2.5,3,"Overall a fairly average Aussie pale ale. Great potential that never seems to go anywhere. Nice visually with good aroma but no balance in the taste and a watery mouthfeel; IMO.","purplehops","Mar 06, 2003"
3.97,24.8,3.5,4,4,3,4.5,"Kinda liked this one,the guy at the beer store said the bottle was sitting there for awhile but it held up great.Real hazy-orange color with a good head,smelled fresh and citriusy,body was a little thin to me for the style.Refreshing taste with some citrius-yeast note very easy to drink.I also think this would be a good warm weather ale.","oberon","Feb 05, 2003"
3.61,13.5,4,3,3.5,3.5,4.5,"I don't know that this beer is a pale ale or a lager. O.K. the label says pale ale but... A very cloudy pale gold topped by a nice sugar white head, lacing was solid and offset the rather strange color and appearance. Fresh lager like aroma was standard. Taste was pretty standard too but had a bit of lemony zest to it and actually was quite refreshing. I think this would be a good warm weather quaffer. This sample came out of a Beers Of The World gift box. I have never seen this brew anywhere before now.","Mark","Feb 01, 2003"
3.25,2.2,3.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,"Hazy orange color, under a small white head. Aroma is fresh and fruity, notes of peach apricot, some citrus. Mellow mouthfeel, decent showing of hops, but very minimal bitterness, and a lackluster finish. Pleasant and sweet, but nothing really sticks out. A fine session ale, if you don't mind unassuming, easy-going flavor in your mug.","feloniousmonk","Jan 20, 2003"
3.1,-2.5,3,3,3,3,3.5,"Extremely light, hazy straw color. Fine, suspended yeast particles are visible from bottle conditioning. Nose is fruity with granny smith apples, bosc pear notes. Odd, very nontraditional English pale. Actually reminds me more of a wheat beer with similarities to a Belgian wit. Interesting brew and very drinkable too.","John","Oct 24, 2002"
3.6,13.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"The cloudiness is part of the character and charm of this bottle conditioned beer. It's golden/peach in color with a bold, rocky, bright-white head that holds extremely well (as it's constantly buoyed by an intense effervescence) and leaves some excellent lace. The aroma is fruity and lightly malty. The body is light-medium, and when combined with the very fine & effervescent carbonation - as well as it's light acidity - the mouthfeel is quite crisp. The flavor offers the standard Cooper's yeast character with lots of fruitiness (apples, pears, apricot, mild banana) and a good deal of hop bitterness. There's a light acidity and a minor hop flavor from Pride of Ringwood. It finishes dry with just a minimal, lingering yeastiness. Very nice. Quite similar to their Sparkling Ale but with far less character.","NeroFiddled","Sep 21, 2002"
2.57,-19.2,4.5,2.5,2,3,3,"Cloudy gold with a large foamy head.  Head had very good retention, and eventually became a fine lace which left rings all the way down the glass.  The appearance aside, this is not a very good beer.  Smell had very faint malt and hop presence, with nothing else really going on.  Slightly malty taste, with a slightly acidic bite.  Not at all complex, and not what I would call an English Pale Ale.","zerk","Aug 28, 2002"
3.03,-4.7,3.5,3,3,3,3,"Coopers Pale poured a hazy golden color with substantial head, which left some decent lace in the glass, not to mention some yeast. There weren't any particular smells that popped out at me. Taste-wise, this beer was relatively dull. There was a hint of hops and some malt profile, but not enough of either. The mouthfeel was a bit too grainy and dry for this style. This is average beer.","Jon","Aug 27, 2002"
3.3,3.8,3,3,3,3,4.5,"Hazy dark straw in hue, topped by a quickly dissapating head. Flecks of yeast ride the released carbonation... Similar in appearance to the Sparkling Ale, but a touch more hazy and lighter in color.  The aroma consists of tart fruity esters and mild caramel malt sweetness, but there's not much else there. The hop nose is a touch citric, and a woody and earthy (Pride of Ringwood?) hop flavor is discernable.  The malt profile of this brew is subdued and light, and much of its character is provided by the signature fruity yeast esters. Only a light sweetness and bready note is perceptible in the finish. The high carbonation lends an almost prickly mouthfeel, but the overall crisp and light nature of this brew lends it good drinkability.  Cooper's Pale exhibits no outstanding qualities, but is flavorful enough to make it a very drinkable session brew.","marc77","Jul 10, 2002"
3.12,-1.9,3,3.5,3,3,3,"Hazy yellow (quite light), dark yeasty chunks in the bottle-conditioned style.  Decent body in the head.  Tangy aroma.  Flavor has decent hop/malt balance, mostly a mild flowery hop impression in mid mouth, but far from overpowering.  OK beer in most aspects, not complex but with subdued impressions of both malts and hops in the British style.  A little chalkiness in the mouth, though.","ADR","Jun 25, 2002"
2.75,-13.5,3,3,2.5,2.5,3,"A good beer, but i guess its not my style, kind of reminded me of Bass, but a mile better, very drinkable in summer, refreshing and slightly fruity.","rastaman","Mar 27, 2002"
