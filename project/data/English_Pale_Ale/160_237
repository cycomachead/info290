Mostly malty taste, caramel, some light fruits, toasted bread, and a bit of a hoppy aftertaste. A bit lacking overall in the flavor department.

2.73,-24.6,3,2.5,3,3.5,2,"Poured from a bottle into a mug. The beer pours with little to no head, and presents as a muddled copper-gold color. The beer has aromas of malt and the lightest hints of hops. The tastes are muddled, but there is a spicy undertone to it that is very intruiging. Unfortunately, there aren't the main flavors to back it up. Mostly a bland bit of malt again. The beer is light in mouth, leaving a bit of an unpleasant film behind. Not the easiest beer to drink, that is for sure.","GarthDanielson","Dec 11, 2010"

The mouth feel of this is great, really full and creamy without being to cloying. The aftertaste shows mostly the roast flavor and just a bit of the hops as well, giving this beer a spicy kind of aspect to it. Overall this is a really solid stout, and at 10.99 a sixer and only 6%, I'm only a little bummed.","Thur123","Oct 19, 2009"

Aroma has a nice caramel malt presence with earthy and citric coated hops. A very funky English yeast edge brings a pleasing nut quality to the table as well within this mildly fruity and floral English style pale ale. Dry but sharply fruity in flavor, not overly sweet but nice prickly sweet red apple notes. Hops bring out a citrus finish with an earthy muddled bitterness blended with characteristic yeast that this brewer uses. Not much poetry or cohesion going on but a flavorful English style pale, that's been on most of us craft beer drinkers early inspiration lists. Mouthfeel is pretty light to medium light in the spectrum of beer carbonation is soft and some what creamy a nice sessionability comes my way with this brew. Easy going with some very English appeal if that's your thing, I'm down to try other brews from Wychwood, it's been awhile.

I shrugged it off -- I'd drank about 2/3 of the bottle already and didn't consider it to be all that much of a loss.

And I wasn't tremendously impressed with it...thought it roughly comparable or slightly better than the Batemans XXXB. I am pretty unmoved by the ESB style, and this one struck me in aroma as mercaptan-y at first, but that seemed to fade as I reached the bottom of the glass. Still, there is definitely something compost-y in the aroma and something pretty grainy or unpleasantly cereal-y in the flavor. Color is dark/murky and cloudy and head is tiny bubbles but pretty fragile. Aroma is vaguely earthy and has a vegetation/mercaptan element also. Flavor is distinctly malty with a vegetable note, some earthiness, and a very faint hoppiness. OK, but not something I'd seek out.

It's just kind of boring like an English girl without the accent. Good feel has nice carbonation and is goes down easy enough, I was just hoping for more.

The smell was of subtle lemons, a slight sweet maltiness, and maybe a little straw. The taste is a well balanced mixture of a slight hop bite up front, a rounded malty breadiness with some buttery notes of yeast, and finishing with a lingering bitterness, though by no means overpowering. This is why I love english pale ales, and this is a wonderful example of the style. American pale ales are great in their own right, but english pale ales have this reserved character that only opens up when you really pay attention. I could drink this one all day long and never tire of it.","Godot","Apr 15, 2008"

Low on the carbonation (though not feeling flat) with a medium, somewhat aqueous body. The subtle and moderate flavor with the mouthfeel makes this a heck of an easy drinker.

The taste is pretty well balanced; the initial sweetness of the malt is countered nicely with a mildly hoppy finish. Not bad, but nothing outstanding either.

The smell was very restrained, with mildly earthy and spicy hops, and sweet caramelized malt. The typical English Pale Ale smell was followed by an easygoing but interesting taste. The primary flavor was spicy from the hops, which was followed by a taste wavering between minerally dry and dextrinous sweet. The aftertaste was a drawn out, but muted bitterness.

This is not in a clear bottle, as all the other Wychwood bottles seem to be--this is brown. I love the Wychwood bottles and their labels. Fiddler's Elbow poured a lovely dark hazy orange colour, with a great creamy tight head, cream-coloured. Sufficient lacing. The colouration is very...different somehow. Somewhere in between rusty water and apricot. Very nice. Aroma: Mmm, lovely Styrian Goldings hops here, adding that caramel/butterscotch richness I love in English pale ales. A very buttery smell, soft and creamy and very pleasant on the nose--nothing is overpowering. Lovely balance here. Softly roasted malts, burnt bread, some cinnamon and those perfumey hops. Nothing extraordinary, just very pleasing to the nose. The body is fairly light, but the carbonation is low and creamy and satisfying. I get very soft fruit flavours on the front of the tongue, and in the middle some wood-like hops and a little caramel maltiness, followed by a dryer-than-expected finish, the hops lingering on the breath. I get only a tiny hint of any wheat-malt--I think it is felt more in the body than tasted. Good malt tastes though, and a nice kick of hops. Very gentle on the tongue. A great session brew.

At the price per bottle I paid, it's certainly not a session beer, but if it were the price of a domestic (or even on the lower end of the premium prices), I would definitely drink this somewhat regularly. Not because it's that great, but because it's a solid all-rounder that's a good change from my normal preference of maltier brews (and hefes).","headlessparrot","Feb 12, 2006"

3.57,-1.4,3.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"First of all, this brew didnt seem light-struck, like Id half expected. So, I was off to a good start. The beer pours a clear orange-amber color with a thin, unremarkable white head. Little lace. The aroma is a nice mix of malt and fruit. The fruit really comes out in this onepear, apple, ripe peachesvery nice. Theres caramel and a little (restrained) floral hoppiness in the smell as well. This brew is quite well balanced, with a mild, satisfying flavor. The front has a very slight sweetness, coupled with just a little butterscotch. The brew, however, is a little more slick and oily than necessary, and I found that quality a little distracting. Still, this is a decent, smooth, easy to drink beer.","Suds","Jul 23, 2005"

2.7,-25.4,3,3,2.5,3,2.5,"Probably the best pale ale by the Wychwood brewery, but that is not saying much. Clear amber color with a ok head. Presents a smell of light caramel malt laced with delicate hops. The taste is much the same and again everything is covered in salt.

Very cool engravings of the witch logo around the top with an interesting drawing of, what else, but a fiddler. Nothing exciting about this pale ale, especially in comparison to so many other great ones out there. Not too hoppy, average lacing, and carbonation. Pretty easy to finish, but nothing that got me excited to try another.","Backer2004","Jun 28, 2005"

Pours crystal-clear dark amber, with an ecru fluffy head that is generous but begins to fade too soon... does leave some lacing. Nose is what I expect in an English ale. Taste surprised me. Nice sweet malt, but hoppier than I expected. Are these fuggle hops? A bit of citrus, a bit of grapefruit offsetting the malts. Had only one to sample, but I'd say this is drinkable all night.","babydoc","Mar 23, 2005"

Aromas of pine/citrus hops very pungent over the less stated sweet caramel malts....1 finger rocky white head that stays a while then laces nicely (this is the best smelling/looking wychwood ale Ive sampled yet...perhaps I got a fresh one unskunked from clear bottles and poor handling). Mild start where the caramel malt kind of prevails then the tongue goes creamy and dry with wheat malts as a long finishing starts where the drying is replaced by bittering...which is is gradual and prolonged...several hop tastes are departed...bitter spruce, to lime peel to grassy to resin to metallic...this is actually not a bad bitter....expensive but not bad.","pootz","Aug 22, 2004"
3.05,-15.7,3,3,3,3.5,3,"The pour is deep orange, almost brown. The head is simple yet creamy and moderately sticky. Aromas are of citrusy hop, herb and some bisquit. In the mouth the beer is crisp with a satiny texture. Flavors are very herbal, with tarragon at the forefront. Malt and hop play equal roles with the hop balancing out the malt, though the hop is a tad bitter, in a bad bitter sort of way. The beer is a touch cloying on the finish.

Beer is deep amber with a small bit of haze, perhaps from sediment. Head is a nice beige and lingers. Aroma is of flowers and citrus, but not strong. Medium carbonation hits the tongue, and a full creamy mouthfeel fills the mouth. The flavor is much bigger and rounder than the aroma suggests. There is a rich roasted malt flavor, balanced with mild hoppiness, plus slight hints of honey. There is a mild hop aftertaste, but it's very understated. This beer is VERY drinkable.","far333","Apr 27, 2003"

Not much aroma nor hop flavor when cold, however as it warmed, some hop bite did come through. Not very long lasting however. It has a clean finish and went down fairly easy. Not much to get excited about, though nothing offensive either. I agree with Thrasher that the label was probably the best thing about this beer!","greebz","Mar 22, 2003"
3.59,-0.8,4.5,3,3.5,4,4,"Tawny orange with medium head. Aroma of delicate malts, light hops, slightly musty. Some skunkiness which faded away as the beer sat in the glass. Flavors of tart apple, bread crusts, light herbs and spices, with a strong orange undertone. Very successful spiciness to this beer, which belies its sweet, subtle malt base. Smooth mouthfeel. Lingering citric finish that grows a little tiresome. Certainly enjoyable, but the wonderful name and psychedelic picture on the bottle were the high points of this beer.","Thrasher","Dec 06, 2002"
3.26,-9.9,4,3,3,4,3.5,"Hazy golden color. Head is whipped creamy. Skunk smells are getting in the way of what might be pleasant yeasty doughyness, light notes of roasted malt.

The bottle looks nice, but if this is the price to pay, it's definitely not worth it.  The taste is a bit underwhelming: hops and malt flavor both are on the low end of the scale.
