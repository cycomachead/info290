review_text
"Poured from 12.7 oz bottle into schooner glass. Appearance: a 1"" white head drops quickly with some light lacing left behind. Color is deep golden with plenty of sediment from bottle conditioning. Lots of streaming carbonation. Aroma: floral and some citrus hops are dominate, with some biscuit and cracker. Mouthfeel: fluffy and frothy with a mostly wet finish. Flavor: toffee, butterscotch, caramel, biscuit, with plenty of hop balance in the background. Overall: very well done. Enjoyed this brew."
""
"An underrated and priceworthy ale which has a good mix between hops and malt."
""
""
""
"overall - not impressed with the flavor"
"Much more sparkling in flavor than (obviously) in appearence, nice fruitiness doesn’t overwhelm the relatively light hops and decent malts, a good interpretation of an English Ale."
""
"I would recommend to my friends"
""
"more bread malts with a sharp honey and those Coopers yeasts."
"Overall: a decent beer if not my favourite Australian beer ever. There is a reason that this is one of Coopers' main two brews for sale."
"O: Easy to drink and sessionable even though it is fairly bland in flavor. Alcohol is well hidden and it would pair easily with lots of different foods."

"Easy drinking, but lots of flavour. A strong flavoured beer and one of our flagship mainstream choices for good reason. An old favourite, usually have plenty in my fridge and it's quite affordable too. The stand-out here is the strong, unique and well-balanced flavour."

"I had this nice Australian beer at the Map Room in Chicago, Illinois. It pours cloudy golden, super fizzy because of the high carbonation, white head and plenty of lacings. It has a murky sediment body, because of the yeast content, which adds more flavor to this quality beer. It has the taste of fruit and malt, with pointed hints of floral and hops. It is light bodied, goes down easy, and is not filling. Really delicate and no edge...."

"Pours a murky light orange with a foamy beige head that fades to nothing. No lacing on the drink down. Tiny particles of sediment are seen suspended in the beer after the pour. Smell is of malt, grain, yeast, and slight citrus-like hop aromas. Taste is much the same with malt, floral, and citrus hop flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer that is decent but the aromas and flavors on this one seem fairly muted."

"one of the great Australian brews, unique and bright, like Australia itself. it pours a hazy golden color, sunny, with some yeast floaters and a large but relatively short lived white head. the nose is clean and crisp like a lager, but with quite a bit of hops, pale and maybe even wheat malts, a summer beer of sorts, with a good kick. the flavor profile is pure refreshment. the yeast and hops make it much more flavorful than other beers at this price point, and the excessive carbonation really wakes you up, keeps you chipper, and cleanses the palate. great in hot or cool weather, on tap or from the bottle, this is a versatile beer, and a fine example of Australian brewing culture. I really really enjoy this, probably my favorite from coopers. I spent many an evening sucking these back. the floral hop profile is just lovely."
""
""
""
""
"Decent beer, very sessionable and easy to drink. More flavorful than a Lager done for the same purpose."
""
""
""
"O: Tasty, I was a bit surprised by the initial amount of sediment, as I wasn't expecting any, but the sediment does not detract at all from the quality of the beer. I'd definitely give this a try again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, the body behind this beer and weak palate sort of leaves me a bit disappointed, but it's drinkable and it could be a lot worse to have out there for sure."
""
""
"Remarks: Did not score A, T, S, M at that time; disregard those scores"
""
"At first it comes across like a light lager but it has a bit more to it. The texture is awesome, but the taste comes up a little short."
""
"Really nice refreshing ""sparkling"" ale. The sparkling element seems to be the higher level of carbonation, which isn't really what makes or breaks the beer overall. It's got a good taste, some citrus notes and is good on a hot summer day."
"O: Enjoyable beer with a bit of attitude. worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it was quite refreshing and would go great with a hot sunny day."
""
""
""
""
"This ale is very light, refreshing, lemony, with a spritzy carbonation that makes it quite suitable for Summer weather. It's a little lagery for my tastes, but still an excellent choice overall."
""
""
"O - sparkling ale is a very apt description, this is a tasty beer made for quality sessioning"
""
""
""
"Coopers: Australian for prosecco? Anyway, this stuff pours a clear amber-brass topped by a finger of glowing off-cream foam. The nose comprises light grapefruit peel, mild toffee, buttery biscuit, and a vague whiff of pine needle. The taste continues the grapefruit-pine alliance, but it's old due to negligence, and when it gets called to action, things look their age on the battlefield. Everything is old, musty, and graham cracker-y. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, a weak little pale ale with nothing memorable about it."
""
""
"Pours an orange yellow in color with a decent head at pour that disappates somewhat quickly. Carbonation a bit more like soda but some remnants do remain on the top and the rim of the glass. Yeast and/or other sediment present. Smells typical pale ale - maybe some citrus. Taste is clean and refreshing - subtle witbier qualities."

"O: A good beer for summertime drinking. Easy to drink. Goes down very smooth. Light."
""

"Coopers Sparkling Ale – The bottle says: “Coopers Ales and Stouts are brewed using the centuries old top fermentation method, and natural bottle conditioning resulting in a characteristic fine sediment forming on the base of the bottle. This sediment is completely natural, and can be gently mixed before drinking or poured carefully leaving the sediment in the bottle.”"
""
"Lacking strength in both the nose and the taste and was a little to sparkling although the name was a giveaway I guess. It was almost like a cider in parts and there was nothing particularly great about it."
""
""
"Total (34/50)"
""
"O: Refreshing if anything."
""
"Overall- This is a very nice looking /tasting Sparkling Ale it's bottle fermented (like all Coopers) so that you get yeast floating around in your beer, I have to admit to being a big fan of this beer and can't recommend it enough, good stuff."

"OK, but not too special. Balanced, but the aroma and flavour are quite dull and dominated by yeast esters. Perhaps this bottle is a bit too old - I'll try and review it again sometime. No need to go out of your way for this."
"Overall - An interesting take on the English pale ale by Coopers. I was initially surprised by the amount of sediment, as well as the amount that remained floating on top of the head. Great grassy and bitter flavours - a nice brew for a summer day."
"A most welcome beer."
""

""
""
"O: This beer is very sessionable—it’s not particularly flavorful but it sure goes down very easily."

"O - As an overall honest and unbiased opinion, the best way I could describe this beer would be as an inoffensive, all-rounder, pleasurable but by no means outstanding Australian ale. I wouldn't place this beer on an elitist pedestal, nor would I be apprehensive to advocate this beer as a good Australian ale. I’ve never had the option of purchasing this beer from a keg at a pub, but have purchased many times at the local liquor store in the 750ml bottles (the longnecks are great for homebrew!), and generally, it’s a good default beer to serve to visiting friends or as an accompaniment to meals. I believe it’s a very good beer for the price and I will continue to purchase this product."
"Overall a good pale ale, refreshing and easy drinking."

"Quite a lot of carbonation in this drop which is stereotypical of many Aussie brews."

"O - Overall, a better than decent session beer for the Australian summer's day."
"O- This beer really fits the territory. I can't imagine enjoying this on a cold New England night, but it really fits the bill in OZ. Clean, crisp and refreshing- a great beer for a hot summer day."

"O: easy drinking pale, not much more, not much less"
"O - Definitely a very good choice from Australia but overall an average pale ale from land ""Down Under"". I would recommend it only if you're in a mood for something Australian."
"Pours a light gold color w/ a one finger off white head. Lots of floaties falling to the bottom of the glass. Average lacing on the snifter glass. Very cloudy in appearance. Nose is pretty weak- maybe some malt, apple, and banana... That's about it really. Taste isn't bad, but it's not good either. Big malt, with even more apple and banana in the taste. There's so much carbonation in this beer, that it feels like I'm drinking a soda. Millions of little bubbles cover up just about everything else that's going on. Very light and carbonated feel, w/ a slightly bitter aftertaste. Overall, this is not something I'll look for again. Cheers."
"overall; a nicely balanced and very drinkable beer, slightly heavy if drank too fast but a very pleasing drink."
"Poured a 2"" white head. Hazy raw sienna yellow colored body. Smells lightly of malt. Taste when cold is mild malt and a wee zing of an aftertaste, kind of a BMC beer with a little extra. Where this really shines is as it warms though. It becomes creamier and velvety and has a lingering bitter finish, quite enjoyable. Other than the fact it isn't really ""sparkling"" I'd say they have a nice quality ""sparkling ale"" here."
"One of the best session beers out there - if there's one thing the Aussies know, it's good beer that's easy to crush, and once again they have proven their great ability with this tasty session ale."
"Overall I wasn't too disappointed by this one. It was a sample from my local bottle shop. Thanks Bill and Gwen. Not something you should seek out but not a bad try."
"Cloudy light brown / caramel in the glass - looks inviting. Nose is a little sudued but has some fruity, slightly sweet notes. Good mouthfeel, a little plain in the flaour stakes but finishes ok with some mild hoppiness and bitterness. Needs a bit more omph to be really interesting. Had the Pale Ale last night and for once probably showed better than the red label."
"Bottom line: decide which you prefer before pouring OR slowly decant half of the bottle's contents and then decide if you want a totally different taste sensation."
"O - Solid beer, would definitely have again at or in the Outback."
"Not a bad beer!"
"Well what can I say. I've come across this beer by accident , and I must say I'm already big fan of it. I am usually not big fan of those weed, yellowish looking ales I rather drink old plain lager, but this one was a nice suprise. The beer has very rich in flavor and you can feel the fullines in your mouth. It is sparkling as it claims, and of course you want to drink freshest as possible. And here is my only problem with it, it's hard to get even in those big liquor stores which sell beers from around the world. However when you look in right direction you can get yourself a nice setady suplly. Overall very good beer and great escape from regularity. you going to like this beer I certainly recomend this to anyone."
"This is just a great, refreshing, uncomplicated sparkling ale. When I first tasted it, years ago, I was told that it was the perfect “lawn-mowing” beer and that’s quite accurate. Notes of grass and hard physical labor really stand out. I drank it straight from the bottle and was done before I realized. A good call, especially if actual lawn-mowing is to occur at some point in the (hopefully) near future."
"Food match: The above mentioned Barbie conjures images of steak sandwich's, sausages, and potato salad. If you need something else: a tub of coleslaw from Woolies will do the trick."
"Really enjoy this beer when ever I'm at Outback. This is my goto beer when eating there. The Sparkling Ale is rolled in the bartenders hands before pouring to shake up the yeast at the bottom of the bottle. As the beer is poured it had a really nice golden color to it with a strong looking white head. The yeast is visible has the carbonation tosses it around. The smell of the beer is mostly grainy, nothing overly special there but it is pleasant. The taste of the beer is slightly sweet and has a nice malt character to it. The mouthfeel is about medium, It can fill you up with a good meal for sure. Overall I love the preperation of the beer and the the look of it. It's one of my favorites from Australia for sure."
"Overall I quite liked this beer. Very refreshing on a hot day."
"O: An interesting beer that I'd like to try again, but a bit fresher next time to see if there is much difference."
"Faint grittiness to the mouthfeel from the sediment, which also creates a decent body in spite of the relatively low carbonation. It's also very easygoing given its ABV. Very crisp and dry finish."
"Overall, one of the best beers in Aus. Not really an English Pale Ale, tho is it?"
"D: Very easy drinking. I could see having a few of these on a hot summer day. Taste is good, but I almost like the aroma even better on this one."
"There is lots of fruitiness zest in here, pretty much enjoyable and worthy to give it a try."
"This came across as a pale ale and a champagne mixed together. Not enough hops for me to call it a pale ale, but it had enough balance to be enjoyable."
"It's coopers sparkling. What more can you say. A beacon of tasty, malty, yeasty goodness that has stood out amongst so many barren CUB dominated pubs. A quintessentially Australian beer. I have a real soft spot for this beer. One of the first beers I really 'enjoyed'."
"Dr: A bit pricey, but I assume this is only in Ireland. A good beer for what it is and its style."
"had this at outback so the glass is so fucking frozen i can't a good look at the body. it seems to be orange with a super foamy head that shrunk quickly. aroma is sweet and carmelly with a touch of hops. tastes like a weird amber ale. sweetness is caramelly but annoying. weird. but not awful."
"Not really for me. In a hot climate, this would be okay to drink for refreshment but I found it lacking in taste."
"Not sure if I could make this a session beer with how effervescent it is, but it is quite enjoyable and I'm pleased to recommend it."
"Pours a pale gold, medium sticky white head, decent lace, lots of bubbles and a fair bit of sediment in the glass. Aromas of malt, biscuit, slight citrus, hop and something that resembles, but isn't, roasted corn are present here. Tastes malty with mild floral hop, slight alcohol, apple, sweetness in the finish with decent bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium but slightly creamy, aggressive carbonation that was a bit much for me, but I think thats what they were going for. Drinks well, approachable and something I would revisit one day."
"Drinkability is high with a low price and fair quality beer, one of my staple beers."
"D- Very drinkable in just about any occasion."
"Drainpour. I'll give it a 1.5 instead of a 1 because though I did drainpour it, I made it through most of the bottle first."
"Drinkability - Good beer. Very drinkable with no over powering flavors. Very light, a good summer or session beer."
"Finally, I could drink copious quantities of this sparkling ale. Lots of good flavours and not a high price tag when it comes to the abv. Just generally, very enjoyable."
"Overall: A great EPA and definitely the best beer I've ever had with a twist-off cap. It might be something I'd give my typical lager drinking friends to try if wanting to introduce them to the world of ales. Yet, at the same time, it's delicious for me and possesses some subtle complexities to keep me interested and drinking more."
"D - Overall a wonderfully enjoyable beer and an extremely drinkable EPA. Well balanced but enough complexity to keep it interesting. I will certainly pick some of this up again."
"Drinkability: I could put this one in my lineup. A good middle-of-the-night beer, for sure."
"I'll start off by saying that this is tied for the best EPA I've ever had. The bottle conditioning of this beer does wonders for it; from appearance to mouthfeel but especially drinkability. Thumbs way up on this one."
"Drinkability: This was an easily drinkable beer with one sip following another easily and it was gone much sooner than I had planned. I would be quite happy to have had another and if I return to Australia I'll be happy to sample this one again."
"Coopers Sparkling Ale pours a clear, gold color with no foam and tons of carbonation. The nose is lemon and wheat followed by a bitter, lemon, and vanilla flavor. It's got a thin mouthfeel, very dry, and leaves a bit of a burn in the back of the throat. This is way too bitter to drink more than one. Not recommended!"
"Light head of one finger that evaporated to clinging lace. Color is a 6 on the SRM beer color chart. Apple cider is the first thing I smell, there is also some pear and plum, some malt and roasted wheat. Taste has overtones of citrus, apple, plum, lemon peel, malt and wheat. Full body feeling around my mouth and down my throat. Crisp, light, and good flavor, this is a brew I would like to drink again."
"I bet this is delicious if you get it in Australia. Travels better than most beers, though."
"It's an exceptional beer."
"Pours a murky, pale orange colour, with very bubbly white head. Some lacing on the glass and ok head retention. Smells of bready malt, hops, metal and cooked vegetables. Mild bitterness in the flavour, but some off flavours as well. More carbonation than I'd like in an pale ale. I don't know if freshness is the issue here, but it says best before May 2012 on the bottle and it was kept in the fridge section at the Control Board in Ontario, so I have to imagine it was fresh."
"Value: At $9.99 per sixer, this is a good buy. Plus you get that extra 0.7 fl oz per bottle. YES."
"M: refreshing tasting for an ale good ending a little too bitter but long enough"
"D - You will want more than one!"
"Nevertheless, it's still made clear that the Australians learned a thing or two from their British ancestors when it comes to crafting mild and sessionable beers. This is exactly the kind of offering you'd want to find fresh on cask at your local pub... having it stale and battered in bottle shipped from the other side of the planet is less ideal, but still alright."
"Mouthfeel was a disappointment. After the name sparkling and the big head, I was expecting some on-going carbonation to tickle the tongue. The beer was not watery, but there is little crispness and no extra carbonation. Drinkability is very average.This is not an exceptional beer in any sense."
"Although its not mindblowingly amazing, coopers sparkling is a pretty damn good standard, ive drunk it many a time, and im sure i will continue to."
"NOTE: I am Australian and the standard Cooper's pale ale in Aus is in a green bottle and slightly different. I guess this stuff is for export only."
"Pours to hazy orange-gold color and sudsy white head that lasts. Aroma is fruity, hoppy and slightly malty. Flavor is fruity, estery, somewhat citrusy and balanced with a dose of bittering hops and some lingering hop flavor. Mouthfeel is bubbly but ""rough"". Has a very ""homebrewy"" vibe to it. Overall, a solid beer that has no frills or pretensions. It is what I would call a good ale."
"Drink I'm happy I gave this beer a try. A nice refreshing beer due to the carbonation and lemon flavours. I'd purchase it again."
"It's a nice brew, this one. Certainly easy to drink and very sessionable. Not something that's going to wow you, but it's something that you could keep going with all night."
"D - Average beer. Goes good with hamburgers."
"This an imminently drinkable beer (I have had far too many over the years) but maybe that is because there is not a lot going on with it."
"T- Malty clean taste, but limited flavor. Some carbonation. I was expecting almost a wine taste, but this is quite tame in the taste department. Not bad by any means, but not great."
"Discovering the lees at the bottom of the bottle lends credence to the bottle-conditioning claim, however, this is still just a barely better than average ale, the flavours never really rising above the gimmick of the 'sparkling ale' - aren't all beers sparkling, or ya know, 'carbonated' to some extent?"
"D/O- A pretty unobtrusive English Pale Ale. There's nothing really wrong with this beer, but there are better EPAs out there. Yes, I could easily drink a sixer of this, but after two I'd get tired of the flavors. Cheers."
"Drinkability: distinctly drinkable. It might be a hair too sweet, however, to quaff a lot of 'em. I'd definitely have this again, though."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a decent beer to drink for a while but there are other beers in the style that I would choose first."
"D: This wasn't bad, but it was kind of boring and not very clean. It was easy enough to drink, but it was ultimately unremarkable and forgettable. (Seemed more like a Belgian pale ale than English.)"
"From the bottle dated 10 JUN 09-14:26. Sampled on May 20, 2010. There is something incedibly refreshing about this beer from start to finish. I drank it cold when the temperature was 84 degrees outside. The pour was a pale yellow but also quite cloudy with a long lasting good sized head. There is a vague sensation of malts in the aroma but otherwise it tends to speak to me in fruity tones.The taste has a biting sharpness to it but speckled with citrus and muted hopped notes. Overall a nice beer."
"Nothing deep, but instead the ideal balanced summer drinker. Drinkability would be even higher only it's a bit too lively and strong."
"Notes: This is a refreshing and tasty beer that is just fun to drink. They would be much more drinkable however if they were not five bucks a pop at the Outback Steakhouse. I could easily take down quite a few of these if I had more money."
"Six-pack x 12.7 fl. Oz. picked upon sale at Bottle King. Pours clear dark yellow/orange cloudy gold color with 3 finger solid head. Smell was pale, malts and minor hint of yeast. Very floral and grassy. Good carbonation and perfect balance of alcohol. I would buy this again and again."
"Golden and hazy from the sediment I chose to pour into the glass along with my beer. Little white flecks of lees are visible in the glass. The frothy white head isn't very retentive and doesn't lace. It has a biscuity, earth sort of aroma with a hint of lemon. Flavours of green apple and mild lemon and unsalted wheat cracker. Leafy hops give it a mild but firm bitterness. Light bodied with spritzy carbonation. Feels crisp and refreshing. An easy and quenching beer to slake your thirst on a hot sunny day. Decent."
"O: Good drinkability. Average Pale Ale"
"Easy to drink, but not as creamy as a traditional English Pale Ale."
"Poured into a shaker pint. Poured a cloudy yellow with suspended particals and a big bubbled head that retains well with no real lacing. Hints of flowers and banannas in the aroma. Very fruity and citrusy flavors with a bitter hopped finish. Very carbonated. Not what I was expecting but drinkable."
"Initially noted how much sediment there was, nice to know it was bottle conditioned though. Poured a very cloudy light orange - yellow with no head. If this beer had a head and lacing it would be 4.0, without head 2.0. Smells lightly of citrus, and some malt that is almost like a malt liquor. The beer has a nice light bitterness with a clean finish. At times noted a mild sweetness, other times the malty backbone is most evident. Feels good in the mouth with average carbonation and the beer coating the mouth without sticking. An easy drinking beer from the land down under."
"Verdict: I'm certainly glad I tried this one, I was a little sceptical of it, but in the end it impressed me. It's definitely a recommendation."
"Overall, an OK beer that barely beats out a BMC in aroma and taste. Don't recommend. Rotation - avail here in TX but one is enough [1xBOT]"
"I prefer this greatly to their pale ale which tastes of nothing to me. This one has more bitters (not necessarily bitterness) and maltiness and altogether has more to give. Good stuff. I like the raw flavour of this beer and think it would be worth tracking down for overseas beer aficionados, at least for a try. It has a bit of a ""macho"" quality to it, I think."
"It's fairly cloudy, but light, and the taste matches. I remember sampling other Coopers (stout?) and liking them. I could drink more of this. I look forward to getting to Australia some day (although it's unlikely). The brewers from down under who put this up are doing a good job. I guess I can visit vicariously through them!"
"D-- Not really a session beer. One or 2 are fine and it gets dull. A good beer and I think deserves more credit than what it gets. Good for summer. No real alcohol taste or smell and that is good. Honestly I do not think it ships well to the USA. Gets flat and stale sitting around. Coopers should focus on their Vintage and Stout to the USA. Not Pale and Sparkling. If in Australia, I seriously suggest it. Good for 2 beers in a pub."
"Poured from a brown 12.7? oz. bottle. Has a cloudy light brown color with a small head. Smell is of malts and hops. Taste like it smells, good balance of hops and malts, some hints of fruit. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a good quality beer."
"Final Thoughts: Very few complaints on this one, Pale ales aren't my favorite style but this one certainly is a good ambassador for Australia. Certainly a lot better then Foster's Lager, that's for sure. If my brother ends up reading this, thumbs up. Hopefully the next time I have it, I'll manage to pour it right. If you find this down under, buy yourself some bring home."
"Solid atmosphere. Really nice appearance, great full nose. Flavor is not complex, but has a really solid combination of tones. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
"Poured from a 12.7 ounce short stubby bottle. With best after date on the label. Lots of carbonated bubbles with little head. Nice golden color. Crisp clean flavor, a presence of hops, balanced with notes of corn and wheat. Fresh almost grassy flavor. Pretty well balanced flavor. A great standby ale. Very drinkable."
"Cheers!"
"Body is medium-light and palate is pretty crisp. This is not terrible for the style, I guess, but overall I think it falls on the crappier side of average."
"It's been about a year since I've had this and I was a bit unsure what to make of it at that time. Lots of stuff at the bottom of my ""over"" 12 ouncer. A touch hazy light gold with a fluffy white head. It's a lightly hopped APA combined with a Hefe for me. Some banana and clove and then tart citrus. The citrus and yeast are pretty dominant. It took me a couple to even try to disseminate the tastes. Not bad."
"Yeah. Turns out, two or so years later I still don't like this. I don't think I'll ever come back to it for any reason."
"Bottle: Poured a bright clear golden color ale with a medium foamy head with good retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of dry cereal with light lingering sweetness. Taste is also dominated by some unrefined malt notes and light sweetness with a dry finish with no discernible hops. Body is about average with good carbonation. Nothing to write home about at the end of the day with a sub-standard malt bill."
"Drinkability: I just cannot warm up to the flavors in this beer - though unusual and a style-defier, I would prefer a more traditional English Pale Ale hop bill to balance out the other flavors"
"Despite the name, I'm fairly impressed with this brew. It's unique enough to not be pencilled in as an EPA, but something else entirely. Worth a try, probably will pick up a few more myself!"
"C. So far im impressed with Coopers, not a world beater, a nice change of pace brewery."
"D- A very quaffable brew that is quite refreshing! I could enjoy this year-round! While this is classified as an English Pale Ale here, I am hard-pressed to judge it against Pale Ales made in the UK as this classic has almost established itself as a one-beer-style... and it is absolutley delightful!"
"EXPENSIVE @ $18.99 cdn/6 but still a refreshing pale ale."
"To me, this is one of those genius brews. Whether the brewery knows people receive this stuff as such might be a surprise to them, but I love this kind of ""easy drinking"" beer that is simultaneously elegant. I could give this to my father and he wouldn't be like, ""Tastes like vomit!"" and I could give this to a beer geek friend and they could still pick it apart. A beer for all seasons I'd say and one I hope to run into again in the near future."
"Pours a cloudy orange with tons of small sediment specks sunk to the bottom and a thin white head up top. Smells like warm sourdough bread fresh out of the oven; very yeasty. Sourdough bread on the palate as well, with a curious green apple and herbaceous bitterness on the finish. Very interesting. It is definitely refreshing."
"I'm not saying this is the best beer in the world, of course... but from what I've tried, this is my personal favourite. I'd also recommend Little Creatures Pale Ale and of course Coopers Pale Ale to people looking for a decent Australian beer."
"Overall, a very pleasant enjoyable brew-would be a great ""starter"" beer for craft beer newbies"
"Tasty, refreshing and crisp. This is an easy quaffer with great drinkability."
"This is one of those beers that fits only because it's Australian and I'm at an Australian themed restaurant (think Peroni at an Italian place). I'll say that if you aren't expecting much and you appreciate trying to match your beers that way, this isn't an awful beer. As far as reviewing it as an English Pale, I can't recommend it."
"I think I might have waited too long on this one, it's not a bad beer but just doesn't stand out to me at all."
"Kind of a refreshing brew, and makes a decent impression."
"Nothing offensive here at all. Just a good quaffer."
"Amber in color with very little head, just a collar at the end. Not a lot of smell for me. I had tried Coopers Sparkling Ale about a month ago and didn't care for it. So I'm drinking one now with the intention of reviewing it. Guess what? Apparently, it grew on me and I like it. It has a carbonation bite at the back of the tongue, as the ""Sparkling"" implies. It reminds me of a lager in both feel and drinkability."
"Light gold color with tons or prickle. This development is not surprising since it is named ""Sparkling Ale."" Mildly fruity nose and smoe sweet malt in the nose as well. Plenty of grain and hops presence in the flavor and in the mouthfeel. Some sharpness to the flavor and a lingering taste on the back of the tongue that I just can't place and is a little bit ""off."" I can't identify right now. There is an alcohol like burn to the finish, aftertaste and mouthfeel. It is is unique, or at least uncommon for me. If that hidden flavor wasn't nagging at me so much and/or was absent from the beer I would say it was a very good light beer. The strange flavor really is dragging it down for me. I would drink it again however and would like to share it with some friends."
"D - HIGH - VERY HIGH"
"Overall it does suffer from the hop usage, but it tastes very natural with an organic bitterness, and a distinct lack of adjunct sweetness. Fairly smooth and drinkable, if not delectable."
"Drinkability- This beer is quite exceptional. That being said I would go out of my way to find this beer. Even with a questionable date, it has been kept fresher from the cold storage at the store and the nature of bottle conditioning. It was a treat and really hit the spot. Although its not a typical bottle conditioned English Pale Ale, it is a refreshing change for those fans of the style."
"Quite well-balanced and very easily drinkable, with each sip calling for the next. The bottle conditioning adds just enough carbonation and a nice overall character to the beer, only helping this otherwise simple, session-esque ale remain interesting."
"M: The mouthfeel is perhaps the best element of this beer. The carbonation is spot on, very assertive and crisp feeling. It makes it incredibly enjoyable and easy to drink, and the somewhat mellow flavours help keep it that way."
"The taste is light but characterful and complex with plenty of grain, citrus, hints of bubblegum and fruit (apple and pear), the latter being stronger in the finish, which is mostly strong, toasted grain with some pine. There is a noticeable hints of alcohol. Light sweetness is nicely balanced with light hoppy bitterness and a leafy-spicey bite.The body is light, crisp, and somewhat fizzy yet full."
"Good body, and the high carbonation works well with the sharp bitterness to create a refreshing dry finish."
"This is my every day beer of choice (keeping in mind it is relatively well priced and easy to find where I am)"
"Notes: Focused and crisp. Highly sessionable beer."
"Not a bad brew, but doesn't advertise itself well, it had a fairly dull look and smell."
"Wish I knew about the bottle conditioning beforehand so I wouldn't be eating hop junk but oh well. Definitely a nice mix up to my usual lineup."
"375mL bottle. Pours a hazy dark gold with a large, sticky white head. Some sediment. Grainy, slightly floral aromas with a bit of bitterness. Somewhat faint all around. Taste is a bit of lemon with sweet malts and a drier hoppy finish. Good carbonation with a light-medium body."
"Bunch of carbonation in this one keeps with the crisp tone of flavor and the overall drinkability. This will be great summer grilling beer. I got the 6 instead of the single, and need another round tonight to see how I like it. So far, first impressions make this worth trying and buying again. If you are into deep flavored, sweet-sided , fruity ales, don't go here."
"Medium to thick bodied, with a moderate, soft carbonation. Easy drinking"
"One of the best session beers around! All the attributes of a great beer; cloudy solid orange/copper with a tight head. Not an overly generous nose but enough there hop-wise to keep it interesting, a bit of lemon and yeastiness. Smooth and unobtrusive. Not a show-stopper but just a great beer for any situation. Even better on tap of course."
"Drinkability: After the deficient appearance, I really took my time with this brew to see if it could redeem itself. It never did. Sour and a bit watery, I just didn't care for it."
"D: Easy drinking and refreshing, but not anything I would get regularly. There is almost a little spice in the finish, and I am not sure if it's a good thing"
"Pours a cloudy orangish colored body, with some non-moving bubbles, frozen in place it seems. Has some head, diminshing. Has a very malty aroma, not hoppy or very ale-ish. Malty & lagerish, clean taste. Not very much taste, plain."
"Pretty easy drinking beer, but not much of a beer lovers delight. Overly carbonated, not a bit of lacing and a soapy head. Musky scent, but nothing as horrifying as Heineken, tastes decent..cannot describe the flavors, just quite ordinary. Not bad but not something I will reach for in the future."
"Beer pours well with small head. Smells good. Good end of week beer. First beer goes down well, but subsequent beers go down smooth. Great start to a good night. My favorite beer at Outback Steakhouse - good compliment to steak. Sediment at bottom of bottle."
"Pours a clear yellow with orange highlights. Fair amount of sediment in bottle. Develops a thin white head with no retention into a light collar. Smell is of belgium sugars and malt. Taste has a slight metallic hint and is watery. A sour, skunky aftertaste is present. Thin and simple texture. Not much flavor to this beer so would pass on the oppurtunity to try again."
"D= Very drinkable. This was an unexpected surprise. I really enjoyed the yeast character of this ale and the crispness made it a perfect palate cleanser."
"Bronze pour with a small white head. Wood, dirt, straw and malt make up the nose. Not a good start, to say the least. Taste is sharp and tangy, with some earthiness that seems to be the hallmark of every Cooper's beer. Golding hops give it a bite. Overall, a decent beer."
"Recommended to all if you enjoy beers with citrus overtones."
"D: Okay, but nothing special. Seems to be a mix of styles. Too bitter for a hefe, yet too cloudy and estery to be a pale ale."
"D - This is a nice pale ale. It seemed more American than English, but it was still good."
"This beer pours a cloudy pale orange color with a lot of visible floaties. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes slowly into a nice cap of lacing. The aroma is of toffee, nuts, with a nice floral hops presence. The taste is a nice balance of malt and hop. Caramel, toffee, nuts, and a lengthy floral hop bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a chewy texture from the suspended yeast, and nice lively carbonation. Overall, this is a nice English Pale Ale. I could easily drink this again."
"D- This beer didn't bring to much to the table for me. It very much resembled a miller lite in taste, but with more character. The ABV and carbonation are both to high to session this. It was neat to try, but I probably wouldn't have again."
"The mouthfeel is really poor. It's sort of watery. There's very little body. I guess it's somewhat drinkable because it's watery. I could drink a lot of them if it was the only thing available. It's not sour. It beats a lot of American macros by a tad, but I'd probably switch over at some point if somehow that was the night."
"One of several import beers from the Carrefour supermarket in Chiang Mai, Thailand that kept me from bitching daily about crap Thai beer. This review was with a bottle whose cap lost pressure on the airplane trip back to the States. Beer abuse, yes! But other than a loss of carbonation it still tastes as good as it did back in Thailand."
"Wow wow wee wow wow! I LOVED this beer from ""down unda""! Makes sense I suppose - every Aussie I've met brags of their drinking ability. Their brewers ought to know what they're doing. Alright, back to the beer. Not only is it KOSHER (even has Hebrew on the side of the bottle), but I found sediment at the bottom of my glass! Some may knock a brewery for allowing a little sediment to creep into their production line. To me - I see that as a little extra flavor. And that ""small batch"" touch. All of my Home Brew has a little sediment at the bottom of the glass, and I know that packs a flavorful punch - as did this beer. I give this beer an A all the way! Enjoy it with a light meal or simply by itself."
"Very carbonated and dry. I could see this being something I might want to drink a couple of on a hot summer day, but there really isn't much flavor going on at all, and I'd probably buy something else instead."
"D - It certainly wouldn't be difficult to put this back all night because it is damn close to drinking club soda. While this beer doesn't taste bad or have any off flavors, it's complete lack of character keeps it below average."
"This beer poured a cloudy yellow with a lot of what I assume to be yeast floating around in it and very little head. The smell is pretty tight, with perhaps just a bit of bit of malts. The starts off with some malts and almost apple-like sugars that are quickly cut by some citrusy hops that give way to a fairly crisp finish. The mouthfeel is pleasantly crisp thanks to its medium body and carbonation. I'd consider this beer to be fairly drinkable and definitely worth a try."
"D: Average drinkability, not one I would enjoy in multiples but worthy of a try."
"Drinkability> es okay"
"The taste is quite good. This is a medium bodied beer with lots of character. There is a puckerishness in the finish, and lots of citrusy hops and bready malts in the mid section. You can definitely taste the ABV which is surprising with a 5.8 ABV beer. As things settle down a bit, there is a sweetish, slightly acerbic lemony flavor that comes out, with a bit of spice in the finish. There is also a drying hop taste that you'll experience as well. This is a surprisingly robust ale well worth trying."
"D - A surprise, this was a very credible, worthy drinker."
"Pours a hazed gold. No head off a gentle pour. Nose is grainy and earthy - almost dirty. Flavor is fruity and smooth. Biting bitter tone. Feel has a biting carbonation. Liquid is typical. This is an okay at best beer. There's nothing that stands out about it. Best served damn cold."
"D: A decent beer but nothing special -- good if you're in the mood for a lightweight ale."
"In short, the cost and hype definately did not fit this beer. There wasn't enough to back up the rave reviews from Michael Jackson (the beer geek, not pop singer), Robert Protz, or BA. I just did not understand why this average beer is so well liked. I will not buy it again."
"M&D: sparkling? well, the texture is in fact spritzy, but with very fine, light and refreshing fizziness; medium-bodied as it is, this ale has retained a rough balance b/w yeasts and malts, while hops sort-of retreat to the second tier to provide a key bitter element overall. This ale is best enjoyed when served cloudy, IMO, and what a thirst-quenching ale this could be!"
"Tastes like a heavy lager with some citrus, alcoholic notes and nice and bitter finish."
"Was looking for Sierra Nevada at Outback Steak House. They didn't have it. Tried a nut brown ale (Newcastle tried before) not my kind of beer. Saw Coopers Sparkling Ale and thought what the heck never tried a Autralian ale. Made a good decision. I like the extra carbonation on my tongue."
"D- It's great that Cooper's is keeping the Sparkling Ale style alive. A refreshing and enjoyable session beer. BMC buddies won't mind it either!"
"overall, a fine example of a blonde ale, or as Coopers calls it, a Sparkling Ale. semantics aside, it can sparkle in my glass any day."
"Honey colored golden amber with a strong white head that dissipates into a thin cap. The aroma is of bread,yeast and some apple. The opaque body is moderate in viscosity with a sharp cider twinge. There is a cleansing amount of carbonation that finishes dry and slightly hoped. Cooper Sparkling Ale is refreshing and enjoyable. Try with a Red pepper hummus or a mild chana marsala."
"D - You will want more than one!"
"($1.99 / 12.7 oz. brown twist off bottle with ""Coopers"" logo embossed around the neck (4X)"""
"Pours a hazy golden with a very finely beaded head that fades to a thin swirl. Slight lacing. The aromas are sweet with bready malt and some bright fruit, but it is by no means heavy. The taste is similar with nicely balanced fruit and bready malt, with a fruity and crisp bitterness on the finish. Smooth and easy to drink. Nicely balanced."
"Pours a cloudy/pulpy looking yellow with a pretty sad little head and no lacing.The nose is not inviting at all,it smells sour and confuzed.The taste is a little better with some fruits apples and banana,faint bready malts too with some slightly sour/tart hops.The body is medium to light with a texture similar to that of pulp free orange juice,I thought I would actually feel the yeast,it looked so plentiful on the pour.Pretty drinkable stuff overall,I could see how it would be nice on a hot humid day in the outback,but,I probably won't revisit this one for a while."
"D- I would defiantly get this again. I tried it when I was out to dinner at the outback, but I will pick it up next time at my local BevMo"
"This one appears to have a hazy gold color with no head on it. The first whiff gave me some fruity undertones with a decent floral hop presence. Taste was a little more on the hop side than I was expecting with some malt coming through to kinda even it out. Mouthfeel was good balance and kinda crisp on the lighter side."
"D- I would say its good, but too carbonated for my taste. It seems as far as going for the sparkling aspect it is very good. I would prefer a standard pale ale over this usually."
"D: Very drinkable but I can't afford it because Outback is the only place I can pick it up. No local retailers of this brew. Very good though."
"Lively, crisp feel, despite the name, the carbonation could be more aggressive, but still pretty strong. Not bad at all for an English Pale Ale."
"Excellent Aussie Brew! Now..this is what one should be drinking if one wants to truly experience Australian beer! (Fosters here isn't even made there!) This Ale is sparkling indeed! Smooth yet effervescent mouthfeel, yeasty and citrusy-like hops, followed off by just an ever-so-bitter tinge at the end. Quite Quaffable! Not a bad ABV either. I can get a 24 pack of this for $14.99 surprisingly."
"I tried this one at Outback Steakhouse. I was a little wary after trying the twin bombs James Boag's Premium Lager and Tooheys New Draught. I was pleasently surprised. Poured a fine bubbley gold reminiscent of Champagne. Smelled of nice sweet, fruity malts. Tasted a hint of apple and other fruits. Very quaffable."
"A classic brew that I'm glad to have a chance to have - Thanks again, John."
"D: Sessionable. This one has everything you need with nothing over the top."
"Interesting!"
"Recommended..."
"-Oelergud"
"Overall, this is not my sort of beer. It's not necessarily a bad beer, but it's just not that great either."
"My favorite of the two Cooper's (the other being the Pale Ale)."
"Pours a very hazy gold with a finger of white head, that lasts for perhaps half the drink. Holding this up to the light reveals a lot of yeast in suspension - more than I've ever seen before. In fact, a thick layer of yeast settles on the bottom of the glass, about 2 mm thick. Strong malty aroma, with some apple lurking at the edge. The taste is fairly light, with the fruit and malt characters coming through again, but all in all its a little non-descript. The mouthfeel is pretty good - very heavy on the carbonation, but its a sparkling ale, so that's a good thing in my book. Drinkability is fairly decent - maybe too gassy to drink quickly or session - although I'd almost certainly go for something else first."
"I did have one more before the night was over."
"As it was, I greatly enjoyed this ale and will likely purchase this and only this the next time my wife drags me to Outback Steakhouse. (by the way, the first one the bartender opened was rolled a bit roughly as she tried to distribute the sediment around and she ended up giving me a second one for free as an aology. Best mistake ever.)"
"oh, and why call it ""sparkling"" if the yeast will make it cloudy despite my best efforts to decant? lol"
"Pours a cloudy peach color with a short-lived white head. Smells hoppy, maybe a bit of fruit. Taste strikes me as quite light and crisp, yet with substance. Overall a sense of fruit and hops, some vague citrus in the background with a mild hoppy finish, not very bitter. Mouthfeel nice and substantial, yet bubbly. Quite drinkable."
"Drinkability: This is rugged ale. Very rustic, yet very drinkable."
"Pours a golden blond color with sediment from bottle conditioning and a thick one-finger head. Aroma is bready/biscuity and only mildly fruity. Taste is fruity upfront with a nice breadiness in the aftertaste. I think I can detect esters, which also give it a bit of a banana flavor. Smooth. Inoffensive. Seems to go down ok. Nothing impressive though."
"Overall, I wouldn't drink this beer regularly but might want to pull it out once a year or so, just for the novelty value."
"i've never thought of ""sparkling"" as a good item in a beer's name or description"
"Pours a cloudy golden colour with a finger width head that sits around for a while.Some lacing is left behind on the glass though it does disappear. Has a malty aroma mixed with a fruity smell. The flavour is rich and smooth and rather citrusy. Quite low on the fizz too. No bitter aftertaste which allows it to go down well. Very drinkable."
"A beautiful golden, somewhat cloudy, semi-transparent, with a nice thick white head. Aroma is strong and pleasantly malty, not complex but appealing. The flavor is rich and malty, with an undertone of citrus and hints of hops, almost no bitterness. A very smooth and refreshing ale."
"The particulate is sticking to my throat; it may be psychosomatic, but it is unexpectedly unpleasant. Guess Im babied by filtration. Ill try not to hold a grudge since Coopers is all about sediment."
"Review added 10-29-2007, translated from french 2-26-2008."
"I've had this before and I remembered it as being something a bit more than what I'm now tasting. It's bottle conditioned so i was expecting something with more flavour. This comes across pretty ordinary. it's good but nothing special. Nothing unsatisfactory though. Just straight down the middle."
"Poured a cloudy pale orange/golden color with white head that dissipated rather quickly. Aroma was not real strong, but smelled faintly of hops. Flavor was malty and simple. Not a complex beer and not offensive. Mouthfeel was good. Okay, but nothing I would seek out again."
"AS you can see I thought this was a Golden ale."
"Overall- Not a bad beer. While it grew on me the more I drank and as it warmed, there wasn't enough to make me seek it out."
"Tried this a couple of nights ago at a restaurant and got to pour it out myself. I decided to go the whole way and poured the entire beer, slowly, into the glass, so I could keep the sediment's extra flavor. Came out a nice golden color, with a nice amount of carbonation. All right smell, not overpowering, but no distinct aromas, either. Has a nice taste, nice hops and malt balance, good tingle, It has a nice bottle conditioned additional bitterness. Goes down great and was excellent with lobster."
"Had it again on April 8/08. Better with the sediment in."
"D: Drinkable in the 1-6 range."
"This sparkling ale is decent, to style, and not awful. It's just not fantastic either. Would likely be good as one in a crowd for a session."
"D - Nothing special but it's a tasty fall back beer as it's available at pretty much every bottle shop at a reasonable price."
"This is definitely a better than average beer, and has more personality than Coopers Pale Ale. Like all Coopers beers, I believe this is good value, as it is far tastier than the mainstream options. However, the bitter residue and tart flavours mean drinkability is average at best. Interesting!"
"Poured an cloudy light amber. Lots of sediment floating about the fizzy bubbles. Not much retention on the thin head. Smells of all sorts of ale characteristics -- bready malts, fruity yeast, earthy hops. Very nice. Taste is very unique -- a bit sour, like a green apple, but also earthy/bready. Too fizzy (but I guess it is the ""sparkling ale""), but it's very sessionable for the 5.8%. A nice creation -- nothing I'd actively seek out, but I'd buy another sixer of this..."
"From the bottle it poured a dirty gold color with about a 1"" head. Looked highly carbonated with a fair amount of bubbling...almost like a soda. There were also some sediment/floaties, but that is supposed to be normal for this brew. Smelled kind of fruity and sweet. The taste is somewhat bitter and a little sweet. High in yeast. This is a medium bodied brew and leaves a slight bitter aftertaste. Drinkable, but not something I would seek out."
"It's not very sparkling as this brew pours a very cloudy old gold with a lot of sediment (if you choose to decant with the sediment). A slight head forms but quickly disappears, aroma is apples, pears and prunes. Taste is smooth and refreshing, pears and plums shine through. Not much bitterness to speak of in the taste of the finish. A solid brew, very drinkable, but not very inspiring."
"D: Very refreshing, smooth, and easy to drink. Not exactly an English Pale Ale, but a good tasty ale to drink. Would be a good palate cleanser."
"Pours a muddy golden color with plenty of floaters as I decided to swirl the bottle before I poured the last 2 ozs. The head is white and kind of flat, no lacing detected. The smell is very faint, a pick up a hint of granny apple. The taste is a little grainy, a slight grassy hop taste in the backend to add some bitterness. The feel is light and well carbonated, perhaps a bit too carbonated as it seems to kills some of the taste. A very drinkable brew and for whatever reason I like it more than my review would tell. Not sure about the EPA classification but whatever. When at Outback this is the beer to get."
"drinkability: easy street"
"Never tried it, so I picked up a couple of 6 packs from the local beer store. I didn't realize it had all the sediment at the bottom, which kinda put me off it at first. Well, I've tried other beers with a little sediment and they were great....this one... well not so much. Poured into a glass with decent head and an orange amber color. On looking closer you can see all the gritty, mud-colored sediment. The smell isn't that great and neither is the taste. It had a malty, metallic, slightly musty taste, which I didn't find appealling at all. Needless to say, after a drain pour this one will never be bought again."
"DA: This seems like really good quality stuff coming all the way from australia. It came along way and is rather unique. i actually had no problem finishing off a 6-pack with my girlfriend."
"Mouthfeel is midwieght, spritzy, fuzzy."
"Eric"
"The sticky sweetness lingers in the finish, I wouldnt go back for anymore of these Sweet-tart bombs."
"This beer starts off in a hole based on the appearance. Scent and taste improve things, but not hugely. Easy enough to drink, but not something I will revisit."
"Drinkability- Considering it's not to styly, this is a very easy-drinking pleasant beer."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied, crisp, and refreshing. Perfect for a hot day. I probably could session this beer. It's very easy to drink. Overall, it's pretty good. Definitely worth a shot."
"Great head on top of a speckled gold body. Lots of floaters throughout. Aromas of citrus and yeast. Not bad flavor, just not impressive. I can see drinking a few of these on a hot day. I tried with and without the sediment mixed and I preferred mixed, but still not impressed."
"D - A bit sweet and overly carbonated but it fits the name. A light bitterness and feel makes it easy to drink several. It has a slightly lingering sour flavor, but overall may be a good lawnmower beer."
"This is just a really plain beer that's easy to drink and can be refreshing. There's no real malt to it, but some sweetness and fruit. It's a bit like apple, but bland. The guy at the Party Source apparently really likes this beer, I found it to be an easy drinking beer. Save this for a hot day in Australia."
"This beer caught me off guard in a good way. This is my first sparkling ale and it will not be my last. This beer is bottle fermented and has a mild yeast flavor that I really enjoy.This style has a very interesting mouth feel similar to champagne. The carbonation doesn't last quite as long and there isn't any dryness. Very good beer that everyone should try at some point."
"It pours like a golden pale ale, with the addition of sediment floating in the body. I didn't know what to think of the sediment at first, but the back of the bottle said not to worry, as it's totally natural. The smells a little fruity, and the taste is extrememly well balanced, with a yeasty apricot tang to it. A very interesting beer, sort of like a Belgian Extremely Light Pale Ale."
"Medium body with slow developing flavors. A clean, sterile tasting start fades into what seems somewhat like sour cherries. Possibly a result of yeast sediment making it into the glass. Finish is dry and hoppy."
"Although I would buy again, this will not be a regular buy for me."
"pours a very cloudy hazy yellow color with tons of sediment, has a slight head that disappears quickly, not much of smell, just of malt, yeast, and water. tastes just the same, but unfortunately the water is the most prevalent taste. this is my first bottle fermented beer and i'm not a big fan."
"It's refreshing, and one of the better South Australian brews which competes with Australia's best offerings."
"Reminds me of a hopped up English style bitter or Pale Ale with a unique carbonation. Different. There is something I like about this beer. The 5.8% is very well hidden. This could be an alternative to common, quality session beers."
"Very unappetizing beer with a flavour similar to your average macro."
"Pours out carefully a chill-hazed golden color with a thin head that fizzles into absolutely nothing. Smells awfully watery with a faint scent of nutty malt. If the smell of malt was faint, the smell of hops is nearly non-existent. Flavor is watery with some pale malts in there somewhere and a kick of yeast and bittering hops in the finish. Mouthfeel is watery and too bubbly. I'm not into this."
"Pours a cloudy whitish-yellow with the tiniest of pure white heads, which dissipates quickly, leaving scanty lacing. Hugely effervescent, one can see the giant bubbles surfacing and clinging to the sides of the glass. Smell is very yeasty, with some lemon and breadiness at the forefront, some apple and pear hanging back, and a faintly grassy tone in the mix as well. Taste is full of grains and breads, with a mild citrus note from the hops, and a definite alcohol note as well. Apple and orange and both apparent, and the yeast makes itself known in the dry finish. Mouthfeel is very crisp and well carbonated, would make a great summer beer, and drinkability is good. A bottle conditioned ale from Australia was a surprising find, but it's a reasonably worthwhile one."
"Poured into a pint glass, from a 12oz. bottle. The beers from Coopers, regardless of the style, seem to have alot of sediment at the bottom of the beer, creating a very hazy appearance. Poured a deep yellow, with a 1/4 inch head, that faded to a slight head, but resulting in some decent lacing. Alot of sediment floating around. The aroma is sweet and citrusy. The flavor is slightly citrus, not as much as a pale ale normally tastes, but more like a cross between a pale ale, and a lager. It goes down easy enough, but not a beer that I would care to have more of. Coopers stout seems to be there best offering so far."
"This beer has a dcent appearance and a faint pheol smell. It is light, yet crisp and very refreshing. It is an easy beer to drink. It is very sessionable. I enjoyed it. I did not realize it was a 5.8% alcohol Beer. I will try more offerings from ths brewery."
"Final Statement: Much better than Fosters! It's redeems Aussie beers in my mind. Very refreshing, very quaffable. Decently priced here so I will likely continue to buy."
"Next time anyone one here who likes belgian style ales is in an Outback, please order this so that they keep carrying it. It's a good beer, and really stood out on a list that otherwise has Newcastle as its most interesting member."
"D: This is an interesting amber ale. Looks like a Hefeweizen, pours like an Alesmith, and tastes like an amber ale. Not the best, but enjoyable!!"
"I have 3 more of these in my garage, I think my son is getting them for Christmas (he drinks anything, as long as it is crap)."
"Very drinkable, was slightlty better when I had it downunder, but still pretty tasty & quaffable, epsecially for the abv. Reminds me a lot of worthington whiteshield from back in the day (88-93 UK). Pour this very carefully! Easily one of the best beers I have had from Australia"
"Finally managed to pour this one and forego MOST of the yeast, so I figured I'd review this one again. I will say this came from the same six pack. Murky yellow body with almost no head to it. Smells kind of malty with some skunk maybe, but I won't jump to conclusions. Somewhat sweet with citrus hints, but skunky. Better than it was with the yeast, but would be even better if the skunk quality wasn't there... It's a shame since I couldn't buy this by the bottle, and the stout these guys make is exquisite. I hate to give such a mediocre rating, but this was the beer I had in front of me, I'm affraid."
"Wasn't really all that sparkling. It had a dull, pale, copper / straw color. It wasn't all that clear or clean looking. And, it didn't have the efforvescent quality that 'sparkling' suggest. It's decent beer anyhow. Murky copper / amber because of bottle conditioning. English malts become quite sweet and heavy. Earthy hops give a must-y, grassy flavor and bittering. Fruity (ripe and over-ripe). The sweetness of the fruit flavors and malts overpower the hops for a sweet balance and a less-than-clean finish."
"Same rating as the bottle; some subtle differences."
"Pours a effervescent cloudy golden with a thin white head, aside from the head being smaller, looks almost like your average weissbier. The thin head laces well though. Smell was a bit of phenollic smoke, and some flowery citrus. Crikey! the taste reminds me of a tangy saison, with a fruity start, tanging up on the tongue and finished with a shrimp on the bar-- I mean grapefruity hoppy finish. This is nicely naturally carbonated, but not aggressively so. This is a refresher, and the high-ish ABV is well hidden. Plesantly surprised. G'day, drongo, koala, dingo ate your baby!"
"Six pack at Hannaford's today. Pours hazy yellow, lots of sediment on the bottom. A bit of a sweet malty smell. Tastes like a summer ale, not too complex, but good. Mouthfeel is fuzzy, a bit thin. Overall, just average, glad I actually found this and hopefully it will be sold for a while. It's better than a macro, but nothing to wet your panties over."
"It has already been through at least one goat..."
"D- Too dry for me and not close enough to style. The bottle conditioning throws a big wrench in there as the yeast hides the sparkiling qualities. It is also lighter than your typical English Pale. It was OK and was an interesting change of pace on a hot, muggy evening in Texas."
"Hazy yellow/gold color. Very small white head and no lacing to speak of. Lots of yeast floaties. Certainly does not sparkle in the appearance category. Smell of lemon and a grassyness that is somewhat musty. Taste is very underwhelming. Again i get a musty wet grass taste. Some very light maltyness but really very thin in taste and body. Some bitterness to the finish but not that nice hops bitterness that makes you want to come back for more. It's more of a stale old hops taste. Nothing about this makes me want to try it again. A below average offering."

"This poured from the bottle a nice cloudy amber with a bunch of sediment at the bottom of the glass, actually quite a nice looking beer at first glance. Smell is faint with some evidence of malt there. This is a pretty good tasting brew with an assertive malt character, slight bitterness with some sweetness, going into a relatively clean finish. Carbonation is abundant, but not too excessive. This is pretty drinkable and overall a pretty decent ale."
"Taste is sweet and light citrusy fruit. Orange rind. Light but strident herbal bitterness. Crisp and sweet. Easy drinker, good hot weather beer. Really tasty and surprisingly good."
"Pours a hazy gold, some particles floating around, small white head forms but goes fast, no lace. Smell is caramel, some honey, citrus, maybe some peach. Taste is sweet, some skunkiness, citrus, slightly fruity in the finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium to high carbonation. Kind of weak, I thought the carbonation was overdone, although I'd try it again."
"Drinkability: honestly, if you didn't have to look at it, and you couldn't smell it, this wouldn't be bad at all. good one to drink out of the bottle, perhaps? Good beer for summer, while barbecueing."
"I really like this beer. It is un-airconditioned in my apartment and this stuff is incredibly thirst quenching on a warm day. A very sessionable beer. The only drawback is that its 9 bucks for a six pack here in town. I just may go broke..."
"Cooper's Sparkling Ale pours a hazy orange with a white head from a brown 12.7 ounce bottle. Malt and a little lemon are present in the aroma. Definitely has a sparkling carbonation mouthfeel. Taste is very light, this is very sessionable. No off flavors are noticeable. Definitely worth a try."
"With the name, I expected a weak soda pop type beer. I was very surprised and pleased. It has a slightly fruity aroma, and just the right amount of fruit flavor to be very tasty, yet not sweet. I liked the golden-red appearance, and the ""floaters"" made it more authentic. Very good, dry finish."
"I do see some positives here. I like some of the flavors in the palate. My bottles date code is smudge. I believe it is 28.07.06 but I cant be sure. Maybe Ill try it again some day. Most likely not. It is a forgettable beer. I purchased my bottle in Lawrence, KS. Oh hum."
"I wasn't expecting this beer to be so good. I'm pleasantly surprised. This is quite the beer, especially considering the cost."
"Poured a cloudy apricot color with large white puffy head. Sparse lacing as the beer slowly disappeared. Smell is fruity and citrusy and very pleasant. Taste is malty and slightly hoppy with a nice crispness. Very mild and thrist quenching. Very thin mouthfeel. A good summer beer. Very nice for a hot summer afternoon."
"PH"
"The departs the 12.7-ounce brown bottle a slightly cloudy golden-orange color with a smallish off white frothy head that fades quickly, leaving a thin sheet of lace to cover the glass. Nose is malt, fresh and clean to the senses, start is lightly sweet, light to moderate grain presence, top is middling in feel. Finish has a biting acidity, with the hops adequate, dry aftertaste, a nice refreshing beer."
"BBE 11-11-06. Some nice white head that's not overpersistant and opalizing pale golden beer. Nose is well malted and nice phenolic& bublegum yeasttouch makes it plesant nose though this has suffered from getting here. Taste is malted and shows good foreign hopnote having pineapple and citrussynote. Good and not overdone sweetness though boosted by age. Shure fresh this one would be even tastier but still harmonic balanced beer to enjoy and well drinkable."
"Mouth: Nice, smooth entry. Light grapefruit flavor hits both sour and bitter taste buds. Warm alcohol swallow and the grapefruit flavor continues down the throat. This beer has a strong carbonation that melts into a comfortable creamy mouth covering. Has a lasting bitterness as well."
"Notes: Not for me fellas. I really enjoyed the stout from this brewery and the Vintage was ok, but this is giveaway material."
"Haaazy and thick with yeasties floatin around. Golden honey colored. Super creamy head that sticks around for ages and leaves pretty lacing. Nose is very reminiscent of champagne. Lightly fruity. Tangy smelling. Flavor doesn't run as deep as I'd like it to, but more champagne characteristics. Bready, dry champagne. Not much in the way of sweetness or fruityness- if you like dry bubbley, this is for you. Mouthfeel is sooo creamy and smooth. A bit oily, and wet, definitely wet. A really lovely feel. Drinkable? To be sure. Not overwhelming on the palate at all, but not boring. Easy to drink, and very refreshing. A solid concoction."
"Now that I think on it, this is what Foster's might taste like if it was actually tasty. Some similar notes here and there but those notes are well played in this brew. Pale ale fans should pay attention."
"Taste is okay. Sort of like white bread, with lemon hints. Not what I usually expect from an English pale ale. Okay mouthfeel, but I find this not too drinkable. Something about it just puts me off. Possibly a combination of the unique taste and the high carbonation."
"D - Disappointing. Better than most macros, but certainly not something I would buy again."
"This would be a superb ""lawnmower beer."" It's refreshing and has an original flavor that, while subdued and delicate, is certainly there to be enjoyed. I'll remember this come summertime."
"A clean and fruity beer with a nice zip at the end with some really well balanced hops. A great Aussie beer. One of the best."
"Hazy apricot colour with a thin wisp of white head. Musty peach aroma, slightly vegetal, but fairly mild. Light sweetness backed by some herbal hoppiness. Lightish body, moderate carbonation. Seemed quite average, nothing really wrong but nothing really great."
"Well I am impressed. I didn't know what to expect from this brew, but I am surely glad I tried it out. A for sure reccomendation."
"Golden cloudy yellow in color with little to no head, no lacing and plenty of sediment. Aroma is of faint malts, lemon and hops. Taste is clean with smooth malts and the hops provide some bitterness. The alcohol is noticeable at the end each swallow. Mouthfeel is sparking clean. Simply balanced and easy to drink."
"A good beer, but far from amazing. Poured out to a golden / orange color with a 1/4 inch head and some notes of lacing in the glass. Medium high level of carbonation. Aromas of malt, hops and barley. Kind of weak, but what could be detected revealed a nice smell. Taste was quite good, yet not as strong as I had anticipated. Flavors of malt, hops, sugar cane and citrus were light and airey, but very refreshing. Mouthfeel was zesty and crisp. This would make a great summer beer. Higher level of drinkability than one would expect, I could put back a few of these with ease and enjoyment. A nice beer. Recommended."
"The Sparkeling Ale is a feels a little bit sticky but is very drinkable. The stickyness does not linger and is replaced with a refreshed quenching impression."
"Poured a cloudy yellow gold, nice carbonation, with a small head. Lots of lacing afterwards. Could smell some hops, malt, and some sweetness. Very nice tasting beer, with a medium body. This brew would make a very nice session drink, would recommend."
"Overall: Australian Made  Australian Owned so says the label, I really hope it stays that way despite recent rumors. This is a very nice brew indeed, dont let the Sparkling moniker put you off, this is a bottle-conditioned brew. The perfect brew to help me start a very late night and early morning listening to the 1st Day of the 5th and Final Test from the Oval on the BBC World Service. Raising this brew to Richie Benaud..oh and Go Poms!!!"
"Hazy light gold, with lots of dark, chunky yeast sediment. Decent head, I actually expected more considering all the yeast. Smell suggests a light and sharp hoppiness. Malt flavor is semi-sweet, with a nice apple cider fruitiness to it. The hops come in herbal and mildly bitter in the English style, with a lasting finish. The alcohol is somewhat noticeable, but doesn't make this any less drinkable or refreshing. A pleasant surprise."
"Smell is very sweet, reminds me of summer fruits. Apricots and peaches, mild citrus, orange maybe? Taste is a bit different than a lot of English pales I've had, it relates to a belgian a bit more, sans the awesome complexity. Mellow spices, vanilla, soft mouthfeel despite initial tongue bite. Finished quite bitter, hid its extra alcohol exceptionally. Very very drinkable, I'd pick up a few more of these next time. A recommended ale forsure."
"Overall - An excellent beer... extremely drinkable.... highly recommended..."
"It has the building blocks but seems to have none of the refinments to make it a good drinking beer"
"Drinkability: 4.0"
"Stuck me as odd that the last few ounces had that much of an effect. I'll search around and update if I find any changes. Bottle dated best before 1/20/07."
"Dont be put off by other reviews, if you're travelling to Australia, stay away from Carlton, VB, Tooheys etc! This beer is what Australia is all about! Class"
"The beer pours a cloudy gold color with a ton of floaties and a half inch white head that quickly fades to lacing. The aroma is average as well. It has a weak malt scent that boasts of pale and light crystal malts. It has a light hop and slightly fruity yeast aroma. The taste is average. It has a dry, yet mildly sweet pale malt flavor with a bit of yeast fruitiness in the finish. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a low/medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This beer was a let down. I really was expecting something better."
"Overall fairly refreshing and easy to drink, especially as a hot weather refresher."
"Drinkability - Definitely a drinkable beer but rather unremarkable other than the carbonation. Can't say I would pick it out of a crowd. The last drink is definitely the best (i.e. with the sediments)."
"Enjoyable, easy to drink brew. The large amount of sediment may turn some off, but it really is a fine beer. This may become one of my favorite hot-weather brews. Try some."
"Pours a cloudy golden color with a real thin head that clings to the glass. I suppose the cloudiness could have something to do with my pouring, but I can't figure out how to pour this stuff clear without leaving 4 fingers of beer in the bottle, and I'm unwilling to waste that much beer. Anyway, it has a pleasant sweet yeasty aroma. Has a pretty sweet taste, not too bitter. Just enough bitterness. The mouthfeel is pretty good, sweet and creamy. All in all, it's a very drinkable beer. Gotta watch it though, doesn't take many of these to get you slurring at 5.8%"
"Overall not a bad beer, but I found the sediment to be unappetizing, and I'd prefer something with just a little more flavor complexity."
"Overall- an easy to drink beer, but not worth a second try. A refreshing beer after mowing the lawn I bet."
"Very hoppy when tasted. Again the malts are in the background, but despite the strong hop bite, this one has a nice balance that makes for a very drinkable beer."
"Tastes very much like it smells--big on the organic flavor. Nothing artifiical here. Bitter upfront, lots and lots of bread, sweeter yeast in the middle, ending crisp. Pretty good."
"I wasn't exactly sure what a ""Sparkling Ale"" was, so I decided to buy this and try it out. Poured pale yellow, with a substantial amount of yeast. Beautiful white head lasted for the entire beer and left trails down the empty glass. Taste was pretty mellow, a bit weaker than a standard IPA. I'd try it again."
"A pretty average ale, lacking in flavour"
"Overall, very nice. It's a little like someone wanted to make something reminiscent of Duvel, but needs a lot of work to get there. It was my favorite Aussie beer of the ""round table beer night"" in Brisbane, but be aware it only is reviewed so positively in comparison to OTHER Australian beers, which were mostly unremarkable..."
"So therefore I have to give this beer an average score. It aint bad, but the alcohol taste made it not good. Maybe i'll try again next time and see if my thoughts change."
"A very unique beer. Almost always solid. A great summer session beer."
"Cloudy, dirty overripe peach orange body with a small, off-white head. Aromas of watermelon, fruit, yeast, and suggestions of bready malt and a citrusy hop bouquet. Grainy, yeasty, toffeeish bread malt flavors up front mixed with some fruity esters. Hops are modest, but do the job. Perfumey, and citrusy. Finish is yeasty and bitter with light candied-fruit overtones. Medium bodied pale ale, with a nice bottle-conditioned mouthfeel. Better than expected!"
"Notes: Quite delicious, very balanced and very, very drinkable. Yet light enough to be approachable to most beer drinkers."
"It was tucked into those one of those ""Great Beers of the World"" that many of us beerlovers where given for Christmas. Sadly, most of the beers fall remarkably short of said accolades. Coopers Sparkling Ale is drinkable but ultimately forgettable."
"I'm pretty sure I didn't notice it at the time of purchase, but the cap has a price sticker of $2.99 on it! I wouldn't pay 99 cents for another bottle of this stuff. I was going to say that I've now had an Australian beer that beats Fosters (no mean feat, I know), but now I'm not so sure. This beer from Down Under will now go down under my kitchen sink as it splashes down the drain."
"Cooper's is arguably drunk by the most loyal drinkers in Australia (possibly followed by Matilda Bay drinkers). This may be due to the Aussie battler spirit sticking up for the family-owned breweries which the big brewers are always trying to extinguish, but it is even more due to the fact that their beers are reliably great, and the fact that every beer is subtly different in flavour and texture. Anyone that knows anything about beer in Australia drinks Cooper's. The remainder drink VB or Carlton Draught because they're cheaper. Cooper's Sparkling is an excellent beer by an excellent brewery."
"Overall, this was an all right ale, but nothing to write home about."
"Doesn't taste like a hefe, however. In fact it doesn't taste like much of anything. It's light, there's some malt, but otherwise...bleh. Finishes clean enough, but there was nothing there to begin with. Cost is just too prohibitive to employ this as a quaffer."
"I took a big chance buying this one. The last time I sampled it was in the bleak days of the 1980's when few imports were coming ashore. Remember when Guinness came in the nip sized bottles? 6 3/4 oz. It is about 6 months past its ""best by"" date as printed on the carrier. Still and all it was crisp clean and refreshing. Truly sparkling. Alas it was unremarkable otherwise. Very drinkable but not outstanding. A faint floral aroma and a clear chill hazed pour with short lived minimal lace, Taste was crisp and sparkiling no real malt or hops on the nose or the tounge. Good enough to consider thier other products but not much else."
"12.7 ounce bottle. Best before 22,04,05. Quite refreshing and drinkable beer, but devoid of character."
"Pours a hazy deep gold color with a big off white head and decent lacing. A mass of tiny bubbles compete with little chunks of yeast for my attention. The bubble are more like dots than anything, really interesting looking. The aroma is of lemon, pear and orange, also a little bit of cracker-like malt. The taste is very fruity with a nice hop bitterness. Theres a minute wet cardboard flavor in the finish that doesnt take away from this beer but is definitely noticeable with every sip. The mouthfeel is creamy and somewhat thick. This beer is very drinkable, it would be great with some kind of red meat."
"Back in BC after a six year hiatus, this beer is a welcome summer refresher. Hazy orange gold this brew has a fruity smooth flavour which though not huge is very drinkable. The bottle sedimentation adds to the feel that this is not a mass produced fizzy lager but rather a classic Aussie beer brewed to higher standards. I can drink a few bottles easily and find this is a nice alternative to a lager on a hot day."
"A hazy, orangey-gold beer with a very small, noisy, fizzy, white head. Full of small suspended particles. A spicy, citrus, orangey nose with some grainsy grains. Fruity dry front; thin, fruity, light middle; nicely bitter, quinine, toasty crackers, alcohol finish. It's a decent, light, bitter, somewhat alcoholy beer. Not bad."
"Very drinkable brew, Cloudy like a wheat beer, fruity like an English ale, bottle fermented like a Belgian. A unique and tasty brew."
"This beer pours a yellowish hazy color with lots of sediment. Taste is a little lemony and refreshing, a unique beer. Very average in flavor and everything else. It comes a cross between a wheat ale and pale ale. All together a decent beer but I doubt I'll be searching it out in the future."
"OK summer beer. Light pale Crisp Very carbonated. Apparently good only when fresh - bottle conditioned. Sweet malts and light bodied. Light lemony Apple pear melon herbal grass. Slight Lemon and Bannana aroma. Hoppy finish and dry but tangy aftertaste."
"Came from the liquor store with a date coded bottle with shrink wrap over the crown to prent spoilage. Mine was fairly fresh only about 6 weeks from release date. Poured a cloudy orangey-gold with a wonderful puffy-chunky cap that reduced to a firm lace half way through the drink. Very naturally effervescent...big bubbles stream up the glass and make the ample yeast sediment dance about in the glass (bottle conditioned ale?). Aromas of spoiled bananas and fresh baked bread. Starts sharp and a bit peppery (from the carbonation) then a richer, oily mouthfeel builds with a wonderfully pronounced malty nuttyness accented with fruity tastes like pears and apples then the finish is clean with a wonderful slight aftertaste of bread and cider. I like this ale and if the LCBO stocks it there will always be 6 or so for the hot days....thius is a very satisfying and refreshing oldstyle bottle conditrioned ale...a wonderful treat at the price."
"s.d."
"This is actually a pretty tasty light ale. Light and a little on the spritzy side. Pours a bit cloudy since this apparently isn't a filtered beer. Nice, soft, spring-like fruitiness reminding me mostly of melons an pears. If it was a little cheaper, I'd consider this a great summer beer as it's got a little taste, but is nice and crisp"
"Overall a highly quaffable brew which I'll be undoubtablly be sessioning over the warm summer months, maybe just with a more careful pour next time."
"Overall an average to bland wheaty beer though."
"It came off very flat tasting. To think about it, this is as far from anything I would consider to be ""sparkling"". As I was sipping, I could not get over the appearance of this one. So I have no option but to say that this was on my ""worst list"""
"Drinkability  Its a little off the beaten path, but I enjoyed it."
"Drinkability - I find this highly drinkable if for no other reason than to see how many flavors I can identify. A little bit of everything in this beer, just watch your yeast intake as it has its own 'exhaustive' effect, um, down the road."
"Good Aussie drop, and for the price is basically unbeatable here in Oz."
"a good pale ale over all, coming in just a bit behind little creatures."
"Interesting ale from Down Under. This little brew came from the bottle with big flakes of sediment and a cloudy apricot-colored body with a good off-white head that held well and laced with gusto. The nose is very fruity and that sense follows in the flavor as well. Nice taste but a bit too acidic. The feel is better with a nice snap in the finish that is quite nice. Very drinkable ale."
"Appearance: Cloudy golden with chunks of sediment floating in a suspension like appearance, white head bubbly not much lacing going on here. Aroma: Bready malt sweetness with an air of grassiness in the background very mild hop aroma that's about it simple. Taste: Crisp sweetness bready finish with a decent bitterness to it, this beer just doesn't have anything that really set's it apart from anything else. Mouthfeel: A bit watery no texture no hoppy oils left on the palate high carbonatinon, light bodied ale. Drinkability: Mediocre just couldn't picture craving for another one of these brews, glad I sampled that's about it."
"if youre not from australia i can say this is a beer best consumed fresh, and is even better on tap than it is out of the bottle. in a sea of dismal lagers and light (color wise) beers in this country (and even worldwide) this is truly a giant of a beer."
"Very easy drinking. Simultaneously full flavored. Aroma is a little anemic but dominated with some esters. Flavor begins fruity -- is that banana? -- and closes with a nice, almost-citrus hop bitterness that is far from overpowering. Truly balanced."
"Not a bad beer. Though the taste hints are slight, and I'm unsure whether the beer should have this much sediment, this is still enjoyable nonetheless. The REAL Australian for beer!"
"I enjoyed this well enough. It didn't blow me away, but I think I'll be giving it another try."
"Medium gold color (cloudy), small head. A medium bodied ale, light and refreshing. Mild and smooth malts, mild hop bite. Champagne yeast added to bottle for natural soft carbonation. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is smooth and dry. Aftertaste has a slight bite, malty and slightly bitter. Interesting beer, Nice taste."
" A great Australian beer"
"Strident lines of gas slash deep grooves onto my tongue. There is vigorous, powerful atmospheric pressure in this bottle. What a perfect complement to the banana/clove aromatics and thick texture. It remains dry with powdered pencil dust resins on the finish. Efficient. Powerful. Impeccable quality."
"Came in a 375ml brown stubbie, as part of a 6 pack. Has one of the most curious appearances I've ever encountered. A cloudy light amber with enough suspended particles in it to make it look like there is sand floating in my beer when held up to the light. How Australian! (although it reminds me of that motocross scene in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas). Aroma is of sweet, boozy, cirtusy malt. Flavour has a sweet, yeasty tang to it, a bit boozy, not much body to carry it all. Perhaps I picked up an old case of this, but it doesn't do anything for me at all."
"Notes: Sparkling…it’s downright glittering! This is quite a refreshing treat. It possesses an almost ginger ale-like carbonation – yet it is a rather enjoyable beer. The yeast / fruit & grains all work together quite well. Worth checking out on a hot summer day."
"-F"
"Pours a hazy medium golden color with a creamy white head that fades into a nice amount of lace. Nose is sweet malts, bread dough, and a bit of citrus. Medium in body with a good amount of active carbonation. Taste is sweet malts and grains with some fruity notes (apple, pear, melon, and banana) followed by a bit of yeast and some citrusy hops. A nice pale ale and a step up from their Original Pale Ale."
"Mouthfeel: fairly light bodied (made moreso by the ever-lasting bubbles), prickly champagne-like carbonation, quite a refreshing beer"
"This bottle conditioned ale is a cloudy golden color that has a thin and light head. The nose was a bit weak and fruity but nice pleasant. The flavor is a fruity malt flavorored by the hops in a nice and balanced taste. The mouthfeel is crisp and effervescent. The finish is hoppy with a moderate lemony/citrus taste."
"Quite an unusual and unique beer. A sparkling ale with yeast and cloudiness! Initially, there is a sour almost skunky smell and taste. Once you get past that, a nice spritzy fruitiness appears. This beer gets better as it goes. Nice ABV lets you feel it. Not an elite beer by any means, but give them credit for doing something different. Looks kind of like a wheat beer, minus the head. Very little retention or lace. The appeal is the fruitiness, and it is a beer I will buy again. Refreshing, creamy ale."
"Bottle conditioned. Pours like ginger ale, bubbles cling to sides. No head at all. I poured half a glass and it was clear and had a crips taste of earthy pride of ringwood hop. I poured the rest and the yeast sediment clouded it all up. I've not seen yeast sediment in this type of beer be so loose and pour so easily. The sediment made it slightly sour. not too impressed."
"Hazy straw colored if poured without yeast, and murky like an ugly homebrew if poured with the yeast. Fizzy, white head that didnt last too long. Smells kinda fruity, definitely from the yeast. Same fruitiness is there on a larger scale in the taste. Nice, solid pale malt backboneHop bitterness combines very nicely with alcohol and yeast for a fairly dry finish."
"Hazy gold with lots of fine grained ""floaties"" and plenty of upcharging bubbles to replenish a nice small-bubbled head. Laces quite simply. Fruity apple and citrus aromas, a little yeast. The malts dominate the flavor in a light and clean manner, senses of apple and peach with a simple finish. A little overcarbonated to me, but helps stand in place for the reserved hopping. There is a creaminess here, as well. Not bad as a somewhat unique beer, not a personal favorite for me, either..."
"after getting over how much sediment was floating around, i began a very smooth pale ale. it was pleasantly hopped and had a great balance of malts that made it an overall winner. extremely drinkable, you could definitely sit back with more than a few."
"Murky offering due to extreme sediment concentration....the body is full with a fruity aroma of apples....This brew has a nice balance to it with a slight hoppy bitterness changing to a malty finish....Nippy on the tongue at first, then passes.....seems very dry."
"Pours a crystal clear pale gold with little head. Carbonation is very visible in the form of loads of tiny bubbles that constantly make their way up the glass. Nose holds a variety of fruit smells, notably apples, and a slight yeast aroma. Fairly clean flavor profile with hints of fruit and sugary sweetness. Hops are not present at all in flavor but due give a little body and bitterness to the finish. Finish is clean, crisp, and dry. Overall a pretty good brew, but definitely not my style."
"Michael Jackson actually gives this beer it's own category in his ""Beer Companion"" and describes it as ""an early breed of British pale ale, adapted to colonial conditions..."" With that thought in mind, it does seem perfectly suited for the Australian climate. Crisp and light, but also full of flavor. Great for winter or summer. I'm also amazed at the way this beer can be poured crystal clear, or entirely cloudy. Two possible beers from one bottle! Poured carefully, the beer is crystal clear with a golden appearance and the clearly visible carbonation of tiny, rising bubbles. With the yeast, it's a murky orange-ish but tends to give a better head and has much more character. The aroma is fruity with notes of apple and banana. The flavor follows in much the same manner, but with much more intensity. Although there's not much malt in the aroma, there is some in the flavor. The hops seem to be used only for bitterness and give a dryness to the flavor and finish at @ 25 bitterness units. A really unique ale."
"Hazy light orange hued brew topped by a thin, but dense and well retained head.  Copious yeast aggregates from the bottle conditioning dance with the released CO2.  The aroma is comprised of sweet fruit esters, honey, and a touch of biscuit malt.  Flavorwise this beer continues where the aroma leaves off.  It's very estery and fruity upfront w/ pronounced honey flavors... hop bitterness is quite low, and allows both the light crystal malt and residual sugars to dominate, but not overpower.  Medium bodied, w/ a pleasant and lightly viscous mouthfeel.  The hop flavor is subdued, but is perceptibly earthy.  Finishes a touch bready w/ a bit of yeast - derived mustiness.  Cooper's is certainly a unique brew... I'm glad I got a six pack so I can try this again.  The flavors contributions from the yeast strain used add signifcant depth."
"It poured nice, good head nice unfiltered orange haze.I expected more in the flavor though,somewhat orangy but would have liked a more bitter tinge to it."
"Pours a nice yellowish / light orange color (almost a honey color), with millions of yeast particles floating around in theirleaves a cloudy appearance. There is a light hoppiness and fruitiness in the aroma. The flavors consisted of fruit (maybe pear and or apple peels), nicely hopped on the palate.  Mouth feel is smooth. Slightly watery but smooth mouth-feel. Overall this was a very refreshing and smooth / easy to drink Pale Ale."
"My favorite Aussie ale of the few I've drunk. I dunno if I'm corrrect on this, but some years back this was availiable in the oilcan, bottle,or should I say can conditioned, with a massive creamy head & a subtle Belgian ale fruitiness to it."
"A good beer, but i just feel that its lost a lot lately. Nice fruity notes of apricot and pear, and good bitterness, and a bit of a belgian character, but is a bit subdued."
"This is an interesting one, strong initial fruit notes and a cider-like fragrence followed by a bit of hoppiness at the finish. Pleasant and easy to drink, though nothing spectacular.  Appearance is a cloudy yellow-brown with a moderate head, such as one would expect for a bottle-fermented ale."
