Aroma thin malty caramel, floral/herbal hops & not much else. Taste is biscuit malt with a hint of caramel & toast, with a slightly dominate earthy floral/herbal citrus & pine hop profile that provides bitterness. Hop forward & not balanced as the style demands. Finishes dry & more bitter than expected from the style. Producing a lingering caramel/toast & dominant citrus peel/pine resin bitter, astringent aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with slightly less than moderate carbonation, moderately heavy astringency, creamy with a light pepper bite in the finish.","mothmanscott","Mar 29, 2015"

It lingers on the tongue with a nice little bit of bitter. I would buy this again or be happy with it from a sampler, such as this was.","schoolboy","Jul 05, 2013"

3.55,5.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.75,"Pours a beautiful copper amber with perfect clarity and an excellent head of foam that fell sweetly to a layer of bubbles on top. Good lacing and effervescence. Nose is caramel malt with a little fruit behind that. Toasted malt, pale, a touch of bread and as it warms some lemon and floral. Taste is subtle and balanced. Malt is forward and the hops are bitter. Very simple, nothing fancy here and no complexity. A moment of yeast on the tongue gives way quickly. Hops are earthy and the malt stays sweet and round. The bitter is sharp but not explosive. Finishes dry and very nicely. Body is thin,clean and a little creamy with ample carbonation and a good mouthfeel.","utopiajane","Jun 12, 2013"

Taste is well balanced malts and hops, easy drinking and refreshing. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall makes a good session beer.","tone77","May 14, 2013"
3.64,8.3,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.5,"Taste-Toasted malt, earthy noble hope note, leading to a bit of a dry finish. Nothing fancy here. A nice, English style pale ale.","hosehead83","May 12, 2013"
3.54,5.4,4.25,3.25,3.5,4,3.5,"Overall can be a real good beer on cask as they often add fresh hops. Not as impressive on its own but perhaps a good intro for someone not hop crazy.","CloudStrife","May 10, 2013"
