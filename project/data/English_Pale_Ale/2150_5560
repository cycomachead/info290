4.56,11.8,,,,,,"Poured from 500 ml bottle into an English pub glass. Initially large off-white head that quickly dissolves down, leaving a nice light butterscotch bronze liquid, moderately bubbly and smooth on the palate. Aroma is floral earthy hops, that ""forest floor"" smell one can read about, with a subtle sweet grain maltiness that almost evokes ""lager"" in my perhaps addled mind and a grape-like fruitiness. Fairly sweet on the palate, light buttered toast and corn meal, light orange and Concord grape, with everything blurring together (in a good way). Overarching impression is one of juiciness and a front to back citric character, albeit nothing harsh or astringent. Nil alcohol taste. My example may be slightly oxidized but nothing that masks the beer's underlying complexity. Subtlety is indeed strength.","DanielTroper","0"

3.6,-11.8,,,,,,"As an American recently moved to London, I'm still trying to find some go-to brews.  I'm finding a lot of the bitters and pale ales just don't do it for me...mostly because I'm craving some fresh hop flavor per American microbrew standards.  However, I've had some enjoyable, if forgettable beers in the process.  Timothy Taylor's Landord is one of those.  Not much nose...some hint of musty English hops and a little bready-fruityness.  Overall flavor pretty good with balanced malt and bitterness.  I get a little of that toasted bread characteristic others mention, but not that much.  Overall, a pretty flavorful brew with good balance and full mouthfeel.  However, like many pretty good beers in this style, I find it to be pretty forgettable.  Kinda like a Sam Adams.  That is to say, I'd be happy to drink some more, but can see myself dreaming about it at night.","captaincoffee","Aug 20, 2014"

A beautiful , bready, caramel, toffee note with burnt sugar, butterscotch, honey, minty hops, a little bit of earthy hops, this is fabulous stuff. The palate opens with a wonderful balance of flavors. A prominent bitterness, fresh, earthy, mildly minty and mildly resiny is coupled with a melange of malt flavors. Toffee, butterscotch, burnt sugar, honey, and a little cotton candy are all present. Drying and bitter on the finish, there's a lingering earthy bitterness that's spectacular. Medium light in body with moderate carbonation, a little higher than ideal, this beer feels great on the palate. A truly spectacular beer, I hope I get to try it fresh and on cask someday.

4.43,8.6,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.5," The taste is malt influenced with light sweetness and breadiness that leads to light herbal flavor from hops with light apple and pear from the yeast in the middle with hops that have a spiciness which accents the breadiness from the yeast and malt. The malt flavor also has a mild amount of caramel which blends well with the fruitiness in the yeast and contributes a slight sweet taste after the swallow. Overall I loved this -probably the best in this style of English Pale I have taste. I like the complexity for such a small beer -drinkability and worth repeated tastes, excellent flavor which is good for being a bottled English Pale.","Slatetank","Jun 01, 2014"

The malt sugars are warm and smooth throughout, providing a surprisingly big depth in rich, toasted flavor notes. The hops counterbalance things nicely, staying in the background for the most part, yet far from being meek and inconsequential overall; they do a nice bittering job without going overboard. If this were more readily available, it could very well become one of my go-to, session brews. A very fine ale.","beergoot","Beers"

Nose smelled of biscuit malt and grassy hops. My mouth began to water in anticipation! I queued up the Dead Kennedys' ""Let's Lynch the Landlord"" as musical accompaniment and away I went. Mouthfeel was slick, almost oily, and the taste was spot-on. A beautiful blend of the malt and hops, each allowing the other to have its moment on the tongue. It was a mellow drink, to be sure, almost tea-like, but very soothing and comforting. Great lacing appeared in my glass as I drank. I feel lucky to have scored the last one on the shelf yesterday. Finish was semi-dry with the malt not being overly sweet and the hops not being overly aggressive. A nice way to begin my afternoon.","woodychandler","Mar 11, 2014"

It has a well balanced flavor that boasts of pale and crystal malts. It has a light sweetness that's enhanced with the English ale yeast. It emits a wonderful fruity character. The hop character is well perceived; grassy with a slight floral bouquet. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a real tasty beer; true to style and quite delicious.","WesWes","May 05, 2013"

4.07,-0.2,4,3.75,4.25,4.25,4,"Overall: This is a great English Pale Ale, but actually verges closer to the American style of pale ales because of how hop forward it is. Most English pale ales are more balanced and earthy, but this one definitely has bitter hops shining through more than anything. The slight caramel hints from the malt help to round out the bitter hop punch, making this a tasty brew that falls somewhere between the English and American pale ale style.","dwren89","Mar 10, 2013"

In response to the last review, I don't think it was a bad pint - I've tried this beer on cask twice and both times it was bland and boring. The bottled version is much more complex and tastier (serving temperature?), but on the grand spectrum of beer, only average. At 4.1% of course it's drinkable, though I'm not sure where they came up with the idea of calling it ""strong.""

As our barman drew the pint, the glass was full of thick creamy, sudsy head. This settled down to leave about a quarter inch thick creamy head with fine bubbles. The aroma jumps out at you: floral hop, malt. On the palate it is smooth and creamy, no effervescence despite the liveliness in pouring; full-bodied and rich, a good balance of fruity bitterness.

The flavor opens with sweetly toasty pale malt, a lingering, biscuity sweetness pervades throughout. Makes for a supremely pleasant aftertaste. The malt is really stellar on this one. Great flavor profile, with the perfect choice of hops to finish things off. Spicy, almost peppery, a little soapy and very saazy, with a bass note of earthy englishness. Lighter on the palate and easy drinking, but full flavored enough to be in the upper 5%, low 6% range. My personal standard for session beer.

4.68,14.7,5,4.5,4.5,5,5,"Pours a bright and clear copper, with a very large and incredibly thick white head that lasts forever and leaves gobs of thick lacing. Perhaps the thickest head I've ever come across on an English Pale, helped by lots of effervescent carbonation billowing up from the bottom of the glass. Smell is quite hoppy for a British beer. Clean and oily Saaz hops abound, floral and citrusy, with a tropical fruity note and a hint of butter as well. The hops are definitely the first thing you notice about the taste too, but it's perfectly balanced by a rich and complex malt profile with lots of fruitiness and a slight diacetyl note that lends it a rounded smoothness and keeps it from becoming an IPA. Slick and crisp mouthfeel, with plenty of body, and fantastic drinkability make this the ideal session ale. I can't decide whether I prefer this to Fuller's London Pride, but I know that it's one of my all-time favourites. If I had a regular source for this at a reasonable price I've no doubt it would become a frequently revisited friend. As is I'll make do with what I can get, and be grateful for it.","Mandrake","Aug 13, 2006"

Mouthfeel is creamy, medium bodied, and just oh-so-right, drinkability is ridiculous. I can have QUITE a few of these if push comes to shove! Yes yes, it is as good as they say it is.
