4,12,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured from 12.7 oz bottle into schooner glass. Appearance: a 1"" white head drops quickly with some light lacing left behind. Color is deep golden with plenty of sediment from bottle conditioning. Lots of streaming carbonation. Aroma: floral and some citrus hops are dominate, with some biscuit and cracker. Mouthfeel: fluffy and frothy with a mostly wet finish. Flavor: toffee, butterscotch, caramel, biscuit, with plenty of hop balance in the background. Overall: very well done. Enjoyed this brew.","Foyle","Mar 13, 2015"

It has a murky sediment body, because of the yeast content, which adds more flavor to this quality beer. It has the taste of fruit and malt, with pointed hints of floral and hops. It is light bodied, goes down easy, and is not filling. Really delicate and no edge....","ChristopherWIU-UTPA","May 03, 2014"

Tiny particles of sediment are seen suspended in the beer after the pour. Smell is of malt, grain, yeast, and slight citrus-like hop aromas. Taste is much the same with malt, floral, and citrus hop flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel.

3.97,11.2,4,3.75,4,4.25,4,"one of the great Australian brews, unique and bright, like Australia itself. it pours a hazy golden color, sunny, with some yeast floaters and a large but relatively short lived white head. the nose is clean and crisp like a lager, but with quite a bit of hops, pale and maybe even wheat malts, a summer beer of sorts, with a good kick. the flavor profile is pure refreshment. the yeast and hops make it much more flavorful than other beers at this price point, and the excessive carbonation really wakes you up, keeps you chipper, and cleanses the palate. great in hot or cool weather, on tap or from the bottle, this is a versatile beer, and a fine example of Australian brewing culture. I really really enjoy this, probably my favorite from coopers. I spent many an evening sucking these back. the floral hop profile is just lovely.","StonedTrippin","Aug 27, 2013"

The taste continues the grapefruit-pine alliance, but it's old due to negligence, and when it gets called to action, things look their age on the battlefield.

I wouldn't place this beer on an elitist pedestal, nor would I be apprehensive to advocate this beer as a good Australian ale. I’ve never had the option of purchasing this beer from a keg at a pub, but have purchased many times at the local liquor store in the 750ml bottles (the longnecks are great for homebrew!), and generally, it’s a good default beer to serve to visiting friends or as an accompaniment to meals.

The beer has a nice light bitterness with a clean finish. At times noted a mild sweetness, other times the malty backbone is most evident.

I can't identify right now. There is an alcohol like burn to the finish, aftertaste and mouthfeel. It is is unique, or at least uncommon for me. If that hidden flavor wasn't nagging at me so much and/or was absent from the beer I would say it was a very good light beer. The strange flavor really is dragging it down for me.

Strong malty aroma, with some apple lurking at the edge. The taste is fairly light, with the fruit and malt characters coming through again, but all in all its a little non-descript. The mouthfeel is pretty good - very heavy on the carbonation, but its a sparkling ale, so that's a good thing in my book.

2.65,-25.8,3,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Appearance: Cloudy golden with chunks of sediment floating in a suspension like appearance, white head bubbly not much lacing going on here. Aroma: Bready malt sweetness with an air of grassiness in the background very mild hop aroma that's about it simple. Taste: Crisp sweetness bready finish with a decent bitterness to it, this beer just doesn't have anything that really set's it apart from anything else. Mouthfeel: A bit watery no texture no hoppy oils left on the palate high carbonatinon, light bodied ale. Drinkability: Mediocre just couldn't picture craving for another one of these brews, glad I sampled that's about it.","WVbeergeek","Oct 23, 2003"

3.88,8.7,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Very easy drinking. Simultaneously full flavored. Aroma is a little anemic but dominated with some esters. Flavor begins fruity -- is that banana? -- and closes with a nice, almost-citrus hop bitterness that is far from overpowering. Truly balanced.","marburg","Sep 08, 2003"
3.65,2.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Not a bad beer. Though the taste hints are slight, and I'm unsure whether the beer should have this much sediment, this is still enjoyable nonetheless. The REAL Australian for beer!","beergeek279","Sep 05, 2003"

Champagne yeast added to bottle for natural soft carbonation. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is smooth and dry. Aftertaste has a slight bite, malty and slightly bitter. Interesting beer, Nice taste.","beerguy101","Aug 06, 2003"

2.94,-17.6,2,3,3,3,3,"Came in a 375ml brown stubbie, as part of a 6 pack. Has one of the most curious appearances I've ever encountered. A cloudy light amber with enough suspended particles in it to make it look like there is sand floating in my beer when held up to the light. How Australian! (although it reminds me of that motocross scene in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas). Aroma is of sweet, boozy, cirtusy malt. Flavour has a sweet, yeasty tang to it, a bit boozy, not much body to carry it all. Perhaps I picked up an old case of this, but it doesn't do anything for me at all.","IronDjinn","Jun 22, 2003"
3.99,11.8,2.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Notes: Sparkling…it’s downright glittering! This is quite a refreshing treat. It possesses an almost ginger ale-like carbonation – yet it is a rather enjoyable beer. The yeast / fruit & grains all work together quite well. Worth checking out on a hot summer day.","lipschitz","Jun 18, 2003"

3.43,-3.9,3,2.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Quite an unusual and unique beer. A sparkling ale with yeast and cloudiness! Initially, there is a sour almost skunky smell and taste. Once you get past that, a nice spritzy fruitiness appears. This beer gets better as it goes. Nice ABV lets you feel it. Not an elite beer by any means, but give them credit for doing something different. Looks kind of like a wheat beer, minus the head. Very little retention or lace. The appeal is the fruitiness, and it is a beer I will buy again. Refreshing, creamy ale.","JohnnyDuvel","Mar 05, 2003"
2.82,-21,2.5,3,3,2.5,2.5,"Bottle conditioned. Pours like ginger ale, bubbles cling to sides. No head at all. I poured half a glass and it was clear and had a crips taste of earthy pride of ringwood hop. I poured the rest and the yeast sediment clouded it all up. I've not seen yeast sediment in this type of beer be so loose and pour so easily. The sediment made it slightly sour. not too impressed.","canoehornpoint","Feb 23, 2003"
3.5,-2,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Hazy straw colored if poured without yeast, and murky like an ugly homebrew if poured with the yeast. Fizzy, white head that didnt last too long. Smells kinda fruity, definitely from the yeast. Same fruitiness is there on a larger scale in the taste. Nice, solid pale malt backboneHop bitterness combines very nicely with alcohol and yeast for a fairly dry finish.","yen157","Jan 27, 2003"
3.45,-3.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Hazy gold with lots of fine grained ""floaties"" and plenty of upcharging bubbles to replenish a nice small-bubbled head. Laces quite simply. Fruity apple and citrus aromas, a little yeast. The malts dominate the flavor in a light and clean manner, senses of apple and peach with a simple finish. A little overcarbonated to me, but helps stand in place for the reserved hopping. There is a creaminess here, as well. Not bad as a somewhat unique beer, not a personal favorite for me, either...","ADR","Jan 14, 2003"
3.65,2.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"after getting over how much sediment was floating around, i began a very smooth pale ale. it was pleasantly hopped and had a great balance of malts that made it an overall winner. extremely drinkable, you could definitely sit back with more than a few.","ElGuapo","Dec 19, 2002"

3.55,-0.6,4,4,3,3.5,4,"Pours a crystal clear pale gold with little head. Carbonation is very visible in the form of loads of tiny bubbles that constantly make their way up the glass. Nose holds a variety of fruit smells, notably apples, and a slight yeast aroma. Fairly clean flavor profile with hints of fruit and sugary sweetness. Hops are not present at all in flavor but due give a little body and bitterness to the finish. Finish is clean, crisp, and dry. Overall a pretty good brew, but definitely not my style.","jreitman","Dec 11, 2002"
4.06,13.7,5,4,4,4,4,"Michael Jackson actually gives this beer it's own category in his ""Beer Companion"" and describes it as ""an early breed of British pale ale, adapted to colonial conditions..."" With that thought in mind, it does seem perfectly suited for the Australian climate. Crisp and light, but also full of flavor. Great for winter or summer. I'm also amazed at the way this beer can be poured crystal clear, or entirely cloudy. Two possible beers from one bottle! Poured carefully, the beer is crystal clear with a golden appearance and the clearly visible carbonation of tiny, rising bubbles. With the yeast, it's a murky orange-ish but tends to give a better head and has much more character. The aroma is fruity with notes of apple and banana. The flavor follows in much the same manner, but with much more intensity. Although there's not much malt in the aroma, there is some in the flavor. The hops seem to be used only for bitterness and give a dryness to the flavor and finish at @ 25 bitterness units. A really unique ale.","NeroFiddled","Jul 22, 2002"
3.62,1.4,3,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Hazy light orange hued brew topped by a thin, but dense and well retained head.  Copious yeast aggregates from the bottle conditioning dance with the released CO2.  The aroma is comprised of sweet fruit esters, honey, and a touch of biscuit malt.  Flavorwise this beer continues where the aroma leaves off.  It's very estery and fruity upfront w/ pronounced honey flavors... hop bitterness is quite low, and allows both the light crystal malt and residual sugars to dominate, but not overpower.  Medium bodied, w/ a pleasant and lightly viscous mouthfeel.  The hop flavor is subdued, but is perceptibly earthy.  Finishes a touch bready w/ a bit of yeast - derived mustiness.  Cooper's is certainly a unique brew... I'm glad I got a six pack so I can try this again.  The flavors contributions from the yeast strain used add signifcant depth.","marc77","Jul 09, 2002"
