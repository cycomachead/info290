The smell is pretty underwhelming as well -- sweet & slightly malty with a hint of raisin/prune. But very plain. Therefore, before I took my first sip, I didn't have high hopes. However, this might be one of the smoothest, easiest to drink beers I've had in quite some time. It has just the right amount of sweetness to it, but is very easy to drink.

3.11,-4.3,4,3,3,3.5,3,"O: Not the most enjoyable beer. I’m no expert on the style, and I’ve never consumed an English beer from the source where I’m sure they are a lot better, but let’s just say I’m glad I got a single bottle instead of the six or twelve pack.","scottfrie","Feb 18, 2012"
2.88,-11.4,3,2.5,3,3,3,"Overall - Not really worth it. Much better Pale Ales out there, and Newcastle's One and Only Brown is one of my favorites if I had to rank them. Some companies excel in their main brew, some extend that to their expansions. This would be an example of one that just, pure and simple, failed.","Draughted","Feb 18, 2012"

3.97,22.2,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Pours to a generous but coarse head with lots of large "fish eye" bubbles and generous sticky lace with a golden amber/brown color. Aroma is sweet malt and pastries with a floral and fruity aroma possibly attributed to esters and hops. Flavor is a complex blend of sweet malt, biscuits (in the British sense) and spicy hop flavor and resiny hop bittnerness to balance it out. This tastes fresher than what usually comes across the pond. Mouthfeel is light and the CO2 is refreshingly restrained. This would be an entirely different experience on the palate if it had been pumped up to an American CO2 level. Overall, this is tasty, complex and well composed EPA.","EagleTalon","Feb 16, 2012"

3.44,5.8,4,2.5,3.5,4,4,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a tulip at cellar temperature. A fairly small, white head forms on the pour, maintaining a foamy cap all the way down. Carbonation appears light, as is appropriate for the style and, unfortunately, increasingly uncommon in bottled pale ales. The beer is a very clear dark orange. The nose is of hay, light toffee and pear skin. The flavor reveals a nutty toffee/caramel, balanced by a light bitterness, with some English hop character. The finish is a tad sour. The mouthfeel is light. Overall, really a very decent English pale ale. Nicely balanced, tending toward the malty side.","MCDuhamel","Feb 15, 2012"
3.82,17.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"overall a very passable beer, by the people who brought you newcastle brown ale. The lighter body and sweeter flavor may make this a replacement for my usual mass consumption brew, sierra nevada pale ale. Maybe.","ryanonline","Feb 15, 2012"

It pours a medium amber tone with excellent clarity and a decent, foamy lingering head that leaves lacing in its wake. The aroma is not very astonishing. It smells like an English Pale Ale with its subtle sweet malts and a cool, clean hop note. The body is about medium but it also has a nice creamy texture. The taste is about as subtle with malts, bread notes, and an above average hop bite with a crisp ending.","puboflyons","0"

4,23.1,4,4,4,4,4,"I'm a rookie to their seasonal lineup except fro the summer which wasn't too bad. This was a super fresh English pale less than 5% abv sure no problem. Pours a copper amber hue with a bright slightly off whtie head forms thick and dwindles slow leaves behind speckled lacing. Aroma earthy citrus hops intertwined with fruit malts and hints of caramel a really good finesse beer. It's not in your face but each sniff and sip draws you in further. Basically compare full blown hardcore porn (American pale ale) to a burlesque show where you may get a peek at some leg with a garter on. One leaves much more to the imagination and makes your senses work harder to acheive the same result. Flavor wise caramel malt with a slight tart sourdough bread note and a quick fleeting hop note earthy/citrus thus far. "A blighty good brew", okay it's good... not world class pale nice earthy tones arise within the caramel/citrus combo finishing balanced with more hops arising the more you take a deep inhalation. The nose has a really nice hop character and it brings out more of the hoppiness with each sniff. Mouthfeel as a whole medium bodied even carbonation, pretty effortless to drink and consume at least a few bottles in a session. Like I said it's not instant beergasm but eventually it gets you to the point of beervana, but it's an experience to sip and session with.","WVbeergeek","Jan 24, 2012"

It pours a clear copper-bronze topped by a finger of relatively short-lived off-white foam. The nose comprises soft biscuit, very light pine needles, greens, a whisper of toasted caramel, and a strong whiff of that apparently famous sulfurous British hard water. The taste holds notes of lightly spicy greens, light mint, toasted biscuits, light pine, and, towards the finish, a gentle wave of sweet maple syrup, which tapers off just before everything else, leaving a mildly bitter aftertaste behind. I kinda like this layering of flavors, something I really don't get from Newcastle at all. The body is a light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a decently dry finish. Overall, a nice EPA, something I really wouldn't mind revisiting in the near future.","TMoney2591","Jan 21, 2012"

I think this beer would be better on draft/cask, and again wondering about its age, for a beer from the 2011 brewing of this beer it's pretty good for this age. But with the cryptic nature of the date stamp no way to know for sure. So overall, not a "wow" beer, but definitely above average and worth a try.","damndirtyape","0"
