"Medium auburn (12) with off white foam. A whisper of floral notes. Lite floral flavor and lite mouthfeel. Easy to drink."
""
""
"I think I remembered this differently or my tastes have changed,  but I think several years ago this tasted more dynamic than the 6 pack I just finished from Merrimack, NH. Haven't had it in so long I thought I'd try it out rather than all the crafts I've been drinking. I do understand where the 76 okay score stands with this one as it was just that."
""
""
""
""
"By the way, according to my bottle, it appears this beer has 5.1% alcohol, not the 5.0% given on this site. Not sure if it's a mistake or just a modification to the brew that's been made. My guess is the latter."
""
""
"12 oz. bottle. Copper color, thin head with short retention. Sweet caramel malt aroma. Flavor of bread, caramel and vanilla. Slightly sweet with a very mild bitterness. Light to medium body with mild carbonation. It could be a tad less sweet and more complex but, in limited circumstances, it holds its own. An enjoyable pale ale."
""
""
"Overall, I liked this. I think that it is better than what most people here give it credit for. Of course it's not the best, but it is a pleasant session beer."
""
"Always a refreshing, easy drinking beer. Always a classic"
""
"I was sad to see this get such low marks. I have enjoyed this beer for quite sometime and it, though I won't buy it all that much, will never leave my rotation. It has a very understated but refined taste that I find very comforting."
""
"The original pale ale before the ""revolution""..."

"This is my standard for Pale Ales. Goes down smooth and easy. I am more of an Ale person so am guessing ale lovers enjoy this one more then others based on the other ratings I have read."
"Good easy drinking middle of the road beer."
"Not to bad, lacking a little on flavor for me."
""
""
"Very bland, not much taste to it. Not unpleasant, but not the sort of beer I could really enjoy."
""
""
"Simple beer. For simple times."
"A decent pale ale that highlights malt flavors. It's a tad over-sweet yet still enjoyable on the whole."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours clear copper small cream head, smells sour with pine malts slight hops, tastes of oats malt yeast and sourness, average mouthfeel. Subpar beer"
"hops."

"Not a fan of bass at all"

"Nothing wrong with this beer at all. Solid beer"

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 6/20/2014. Pours slightly hazy deep copper color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings around the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, toffee, toasted biscuit, plum, pear, apple, herbal, floral, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, toffee, toasted biscuit, plum, pear, apple, herbal, floral, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of herbal/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, toasted biscuit, plum, pear, apple, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Nice robustness and balance of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and fruity yeast flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly metallic mouthfeel that is okay. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 5%. Overall this is a very solid English pale ale. All around good balance and robustness of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and fruity yeast flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A pleasantly enjoyable offering."

"Reviewing the US ""version"" of this beer. Not going to waste much on this. Any reference to Bass or the red triangle need to be removed. This is NOT the Bass you remember or like. It's just another generic American beer. Don't bother."
""
""
""
""
"Bass Pale Ale - I somehow always get lucky when on travel for work and try something that always impresses me.  This time it was a Bass Pale Ale.  By far, the smoothest pale ale I have had - it tasted more like a dark lager than a pale ale - surprising and refreshing to me.  I wasn't overly impressed with the smell, and it had a fast-disappearing head with no lacing, but the taste was exceptional.  I would definitely reach for this guy if it shows up in my local liquor joint."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"My grandad used to drink this and said that it was ""outstanding", to be honest the modern uk version is nothing to write home about, its a generic ale and offers nothing. On the plus side the label on the bottle is still cool, at least AB Inbev have stuck with that if nothing else."

"I'd only drink this when mixing it with Guinness in a black and tan, but if I'm going to do that, I prefer using Harp instead.  British beer tends to be pretty love/hate in the US, and this one doesn't do enough for me to warrant an order by itself."
""
""
"Very lightly flavored but crisp and refreshing with lots of carbonation. It's nice enough overall, but in a minimalist sort of way."

"This was a great beer way back when, after being bought by anheuser busch, and replacing hops with two row malts, this is nothing more than a Budweiser with extra malts and a horrible natti ice aftertaste. Shame on this company for buying out and ruining a beer that has been around since artist like Monet and dictators like Napoleon Bonaparte. Just another casualty in the war of the beers. Seems any good beers will be bought out and watered down if they sell out. I will not even do the beer review in terms of mouthfeel, ect , cause to be honest its not worth it, as it fails all tests..Now I only speak of the usa version by anheuser busch, I remember the uk version being delicious!"

"Bass pours a dark golden color with a very small but lacing head. There is a mellow caramel aroma, with some corn like notes. The taste has some caramel malt flavors, but a lot of adjunct flavors afterwards. Slightly odd flavors, bad aftertaste. Overall its not horrible, and has some nice flavors, but a really bad aftertaste."

"O: A good (but very light and mild) English pale ale. Mild smell, flavors and mouthfeel but a very bready character."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"From what I can remember this beer was a decent beer. The smell was good, and the color was not all that bad. The taste was not that bad as well. I do not remember that much about this beer it has been a while since I have had this beer. But this was a decent beer. If I can find this beer, I would like to try it again."

"Hmmm, so-so. Looks OKish, while the aroma and flavour are quite bland and insipid. Bit too harsh and lacking in hop undertones. Lacklustre body - wants beefing up. This has an underlying character that suggests drinkability, but the bottled form also has flaws. I suspect a good example on cask is a marked improvement, though I've never seen it round these parts. Oh well. No need to rush out and track it down."

"Bass, being the world's first pale ale set the standard for this type of beer. It's much more subtle than it's American counter parts and while it's been an mainstream beer for a while it still holds its own against the new breeds. The first thing you notice is just how damn smooth and drinkable this beer is. All you can say is the balance and mouthfeel are on point and this is truly a well crafted beer. Carmel malt body with a light vinegar note and a hop presence that is subtlety in the background but enough to know its there. Overall a great session ale, a must try classic."

"Bought a 12 pack of this brew , thought it was going to be good because it says it the first ale ever invented. Was I wrong. This beer is awful bitter with strong bad hops. Smells bad as well. Had in glass and bottle no difference just as bad. Definitely would never get this beer again."

"Rich brown color with a good half inch thick head of white foam that dissipates fairly quickly. Excellent clarity. Weak aroma of pale malt and some faint bittering hops. Mouth is pretty thin but crisp. The flavor is light malt with a trace of bittering hops. This is meant to be a subtle yet refreshing quaffer."

"Overall: Hey, it's Bass. It says Baldwinsville on the label, and that's weird. But it's a decent, ubiquitous pale ale that gets the job done. The market is so saturated with pale and amber ales right now that it's easy to forget that the original is still pretty decent. That said, the only time I'm likely to have this is at a restaurant that otherwise has only macro lagers."

"I very much agree with the other reviewers who said this was a good basic ale. It is relatively inexpensive with a low ABC, so it makes a very satisfactory session beer. I also agree, however, that it has nothing to recommend it beyond that. It is neither distinctive as an ale, a brown ale, or a pale ale. Everything is moderate and diffused in the slightly nutty brown taste, resulting, well... in a moderately drinkable nice little ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A very pleasant tasting beer. The fruity aroma is hard to detect, but it comes forth in the taste. This is a smooth beer and light and flavorful  enough to drink anytime."
""
""
"O- Not complex. I though this was probably outdated, but the reveal showed it was Bass without a bottle date. So, I'm still not sure if this is just how Bass tastes, or if it was a stale Bass. Either way it was still drinkable, better than I thought Bass would be, but still far from great."

"O: Decent everyday beer, while labeled pale ale it might pass as a mild perhaps with low bitterness and it's not exactly pale. Some disappointments in appearance and aroma, but taste and mouthfeel are not bad, just not special."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is not a bad beer but I expected more. As a fan of this style, I'm glad that they improved it throughout the years and have made EPAs that are better than this. I wouldn't mind having one every now and then, especially if it's on sale. But if I have other choices like London Pride on the same shelf, I'd go for it instead of this one."
"For the taste it is light, soft and delicate. a Little of spice and a bit caramel. There is totally not a mouthfeel what will hang for a long time on your palate."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Recently it's been on sale near me for $12 a twelver, which I consider a real ale bargain...so to speak. I personally prefer an ale with more flavor when drinking it by itself, but at mealtime and when I'm thirsty Bass and I get along fine."

"Pours brownish with creamy head that fades quickly. fairly bitter initial taste with honey aftertaste. medium to light weigh and I remember it being heavier. Not much to say about this brew other than its just ok but a solid beer to get if a bar has it on tap."

"Poured a clear amber with a thin white head that was gone in less than 30 seconds. The smell was entirely bubblegum, no floral notes at all. Taste was again bubblegum, with some caramel and a lot of apple juice. Hop character and bitterness were minimal to nonexistent. A lower hop flavor than an EPA should have for sure. The mouthfeel was moderately carbonated, but felt thin. Overall a mediocre English Pale Ale, not able to compete with the truly good examples of the style."

"Overall, I'm not that impressed with this classic English beer. I've been wanting to get into more English style beers, and I hope in the future they are better than this."
""
"It seemed to be more watered down that I remember. The carbonation was very poor and very flat. This used to be one of my favorites but not anymore. I guess thats what happend when the big guys take over our old favorites. This beer is now just a fancier Bud light"

""

"I'd say its a slightly above average pale ale"

"Best Pale Ale for every day drinking that I have come across. Not too Hoppy, not too bitter. Not an over powering after taste. Smooth and flavorful. Don't think it is made in England anymore though, I believe I heard Anheuser-Busch brews it now. Wouldn't that make it an American Pale Ale?"

"O - Bass Pale Ale is not a libation that I regularly pursue. It seems watered down as opposed to my recollection. I will probably not be consuming this beer any time soon after this six pack."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-I have had worse beers than this, but I have certainly had better. As noted above, the brew is drinkable, but the smell is non-existent and the taste is similarly light. The flavors are not bad, there just isn't much to comment on. Might be a good golfing beer."

"This is a beautiful brew. Nice red-amberish color with a small head that doesn't hang around. As far as smell goes I think it is the weak point of the beer. Taking a small sniff I almost drew an aroma of sweat from it (Pleasant analogy huh? But it is what came to mind!). But Bass is a wonderful pale ale, tasting somewhat spicy on first contact with a nutty finish. And overall I think is one of the best pale ale's in mass production, and probably in my top 3 favorite beers period."

""
""

"Overall - Really nice euro pale ale by Bass here. Obviously the old standby as the tan in a Guinness black and tan, but does just as well as a stand alone beer."

"I recall having this out of a cask while I was in the UK, and it was actually much better that way. However, since that was a over a year ago, my review stands for the bottled version, which doesn't have much going for it except that you can get it at a decent price in a twelve pack just about anywhere."

"This is a medium bodied brew with a light level of carbonation. It is sweet overall with some odd characteristics thrown into the mix to break things up. Without thinking too much about this, I wonder if the establishment serving me this only keeps this brew on hand to serve black and tans..."
""
""
"Overall: I still like this beer. It played its role back in the day as a gateway into this hobby, and I applaud it for that. I would definitely drink it if offered, but I can't see myself bringing any home anymore."

"O – Easy drinking, a decent flavor….it’s easy to see why this would be popular. That said, was it my cup of tea? In a word, no. I found it to be a little too watery, and a little too bland to truly be considered a great beer. That said, I certainly drank plenty of these when I was transitioning to craft beer, and I kind of feel bad for slamming a classic. A decent example of a simple pale ale."

"Taste-Understated earthy/fruity hops, faint mineral note leading to a rather dry finish. Reserved and understated, refreshing and sessionable. A classic English pale ale."
"Overall I wonder how much this beer has changed since it was purchased by InBev. I be it used to be much higher quality and a nice traditional English pale ale, but now there is no hop presence and the mouthfeel is this, watery rubbish. Hopefully I remember to never revisit this beer because for some reason I always forget and order it anyway."

"O-not too bad if a bar has little else to offer."

"O: This is a decent pale – not a premium ale – but just a middle of the road beer."
""
""
""

""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - 4.5/5 - easy to drink and refreshing.really among the best pale ales I've tried"
""
""
""
""
"A real disappointment here, after my review of Bass in bottles was much better 3 years ago. Maybe my taste buds have changed, but this one I didn't hesitate to deem ""Ass ale"" now. Will not return to this one anytime soon."
""
""
"Overall, this American brewery obviously produces a fresher product, but there is a few characteristics missing that can be found in the UK brew. Either way, this is a classic Pale Ale that set the standard. Cheers, the fresher version seems to appeal to me a little more. I mean fresh is better."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Additionally, it's not brewed in England anymore. It's contract brewed by AB in their Baldwinsville brewery. The label states that it's brewed in the finest British Tradition. I find it pretty dubious that there's much fine British tradition going on in Syracuse, NY."

"This beer is just too fruity and weak. If it had more malt presence and higher carb it could be saved. A boring beer. Hops are there providing aroma but very little bitterness leading to a watery feel. Quite disappointing as I remember this being an alright beer when sampled in London."

"O/D - Used to love this beer when I first started drinking different beers. Now it just doesn't have the affect it used to. It's rich and flavourful, but not complex like alot of other quality EPAs. Tasty but uninteresting at the same time."

"o - Overall not that bad of a beer; a decent enough Pale Ale. While nothing mind blowing, still better than most BMC products, and something I'd order again at a place with a limited selection. Wasn't in the mood for a Guiness and this sufficed, though I don't think I would ever purchase bottles of it with other options."

"A deep amber color with a one finger head. Has a sweet caramel tart aroma.It’s starts off with soft sweet beginning with mild bitterness in the finish. A nice every day brew without all the thrills. Has a mellowness that’s hard to describe. On a side note on the bottle says ""Product of USA"" but everywhere else I've seen says brewed in England which is confusing."

I use to be able to get Fuller's and Belhaven, I guess thouse days are gone and now Sam Adams is making ""light "" beer; Good God what is the world coming to???"

"I usually just don't bother to review beers I don't like, but I used to love Bass (in bottles, all over the world) and wanted to give it one more try. No matter where I went, Bass was always Bass. Sadly, it's not anymore. I don't know what this crap is in these brown bottles with this famous red triangle trademark on it these days, but it's not Bass. I was a Bass drinker. I KNOW what Bass tastes like and this isn't it. One of the classics has disappeared and it pisses me off. The only resemblance to real Bass is the label on the bottle. Belongs in the bargain bin."
""
""
"O: I so seldom buy spoiled beer (it's been years) that it is hard for me to call any beer spoiled. I just don't think this 12 pack of Bass Ale is right. If I ever have it again in the future I'll be sure to re-review it. For now, I have 10 more bottles of this stuff to choke down."

"Pretty good Pale Ale. This beer looks very refreshing. It has lots of fruity notes in the smell just not what I was hoping for kinda of musty not sure if they mean for it to be that way but doesn't throw it off any! It is a great tasting beer leaving lots of sweet fruit notes as the finish, light mouthfeel almost not noticeable overall a good beer drink up!"

"Overall: This is the beer I fell in love with almost 30 years ago, in my teens, while traveling in Great Briton. Back then I thought it had an explosive taste, but by today's standards I find it rather mellow. This is a solid pale ale. Nothing to do cartwheels over, and nothing to scoff at either."
"Never again. Don't be fooled. If you never has Bass Ale prior to this switch, you still will never be able to try it. This is a completely different beer now."
"Overall: Its a classic, but a rather boring one. This beer from a bottle or tap just cannot stand up to the full, fruity cask version. Its just weak, unoffensive stuff."
"overall = This is my go to beer when I can't decide what to drink. I love pale ales, but sometimes they are a bit too hoppy. This one is really balanced and easy to drink."
"O: Bass Pale Ale is a solid English pale ale, but for those used to big, assertive beers will probably not hit the spot. EPA, as a style, is not the most complex in the world, but Bass is simpler and more straight-forward than most. A good beer for those who just want something basic."
"Notes: This must have been a good beer a long time ago"
"SOLID, NOT MUST HAVE!"
"God save the Queen!"
"O - This is a beer I got away from in getting into craft beer. I was surprised that revisiting Bass didn't disappoint me at all. I'd certainly try this again at a place that had limited beer options."
"It is nice but not exceptional. Apparently it is the World's first pale ale and a world-wide icon."
"I don't quite feel up to a full review, so let me do something short. This time around, this beer reminds me a lot of Shiner Bock. It's minerally and has a rounding caramel flavor. However, this has much better hopping (not that it's much, but it does its job) and a much cleaner flavor. Very easy to drink and a good casual option."
"O - Would rather drink this than some other macro offerings. Still, definately no reason to buy this."
"O - A decent basic ale, nice to have from time to time"
"overall, a mediocre to slightly above average beer i would accept if handed to me for free but would not pay money for. at least, i wouldn't anymore. used to be a staple back before craft, when i thought bass was the creme de la creme of the beer world. would take it over BMC."
"I haven't had one of these for about 5 years... and I could easily see myself going that long again before I again reach for a Bass-- but I'll be fair and state that I can at least see the appeal for this beer. It is very easy drinking and relatively low in ABV. Not one I want to have regularly, but not really entirely offensive either."
"O: All and all this one wasn't terrible or great just an easy drinking EPA, that doesn't do much well or really do anything bad."
"Overall very pleasant and nuetral, with a dry earthy character, not unlike some scottish ales I've tried. No aftertastes; very palatable; just not very noteable."
"Overall, a crisp, creamy and clean beer. Very easy to drink."
"O; it's an OK beer but nothing more, although i do drink it a lot"
"Drinkability- This was another good beer for the pub. I enjoyed it and had a great time there."
"O: Overall, this is a very well balanced EPA, with classic characteristics and great smoothness. Very well represented as a benchmark for the style."
"O: Drinking this beer is a breeze – I could easily have these all night long so it is very sessionable."
"This was one of my favorites before I discovered good beer. I still do not mind it. Malty and a little sweet, some nut flavors, pleasant aroma. A little metallic at times and weak on the mouthfeel. Decent even if it is not the most exciting beer out there."
"Overall, while this beer is not great I have always enjoyed it and for me its a standby. I really like this beer and feel no reason to apologize for doing so."
"This was a wonderful surprise. My first pale ale so forgive me, my review may suffer from comparison. The color was nice..a clear orange/copper color,which seemed to introduce the odor. Sweet carmalized fruit smell with a hint of spice. I really liked the taste,exactly like the smell,a nice suprise, the simplicity continued from start to finish no aftertaste. The feel is gratifying,I would definitely recommned and repeat the experience again and again. I loved the way its blends- look,smell,and taste together,its not complicated...no fancy head,no fancy lacing,who cares...its refreshing and tastes great"
"Another Anheuser-Busch InBev industrial product. Better than bitter metallic water but not very interesting. I think the trouble is all of these keg-style bottled western Eropean beers are so much like American lagers. But it's hard to compare the flavors of ""real ale"" in a British pub with a fizzy bottle off the boat."
"O: Not my favorite English Pale Ale but certainly a drinkable brew. Not overly complex. Not a brew I usually seek out but not one I would pass up either."
"Had a big glass of Bass with some chicken wings... WOW. So good. I was impressed when the bartender handed me the beer. A perfect looking head that lingered throughout the course of the drinking period. The copper color was also quite attractive. The smell was nothing spectacular but the taste was very enjoyable. A little hoppy but still tasty."
"O/D-Not bad. I am pleasantly surprised by this. I would never go out of my way to get it again, but I chose it from a weak tap list at a bar. Hey, I'm not complaining."
"The taste is slightly bitter from a very faintly grapefruit hop taste and those same malts from the nose. Light lemony taste in the middle there that doesn't last very long unfortunately, for that helps the tasting along. It has an odd corn flavoring to it that doesn't really sit well with me for the overall taste, but the lightly roasted malts make up for it a little. Not a great beer by any means, but its worth a try. It also might be better across the pond where it might be a little fresher, but the balance in the one I'm sampling is a little off and the overall taste isn't all that great. Needs a little more hops to help that along."
"Pours a copper orange color with a 1 inch white head that fades to an oily film on the top of the beer. Random spots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of sweet grains, caramel malt, and citrus. Taste is of caramel malt, biscuit, and citrus zest. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good easy drinking beer that I would get again."
"Overall, nothing to get excited about, a very average beer."
"Overall-I could see why you would like this beer. It's drinkable, and doesn't taste bad. It's just very simple and I'd rather drink something else."
"O- Very popular beer at restaurants.. but nothing special here."
"The beer exits the bottle a dark caramel-copper color with a thin wisp of foam floating above. The aroma is caramel and toffee with a nutty character. The flavor begins with very husky malt. Both sweet and almost starchy. Some buttery notes as it moves through the center with a dusting of biter hops at the end. The slightly off flavor of the malt is what lingers on the palate, unfortunately."
"Overall - A nice easy drinking beer. It might be a little too sweet to have a whole bunch of it, but it's still good nonetheless."
"Met with some old cronies today at the Tilted Kilt in Chi-town!!! The Bass Ale was served in a 20oz solid glass that was chilled to perfection! The appearance was a clear amber with low carbonation with little /no head. The smell was very subtle malt and hop and grain. The taste was very nice and smooth....common for a typical English style pale ale. The mouthfeel was awesome for this situation....session ale for sure!"
"This is a great session beer on tap and certainly is the best of all-macro selection at my local in the craft-beer desert of Windsor."
"Overall: This a well balanced beer which taste good both chilled and warm. It has become a stable of mine recently, perfect for when I'm in the mood for a good, but inexpensive, pale ale. It's not the best drinking experience but above average in every aspect."
"A tasty well balanced beer that would go great with dinner. Well balanced and easy to drink."
"Poured this English Pale Ale from a bottle into a pint glass. The beer poured a nice reddish brown and made a nice head with off the charts retention. Lacing on this beer was about the best that i have seen. Holy Stickage. The nose of the beer was a nice malty caramel and a slight hint of hops- kent goldings perhaps? This ale has a nice medium body and is very drinkable. The taste is simple malty, somewhat dry. Very good example of a English Pale Ale. Perhaps the flagship."
"Overall / Drinkability: Not bad, but not great either. I've had better English pale ales. Okay with a meal of fish and chips and after the meal not as good as it was with food. I probably won't get again."
"What can I say, this is my absolute favorite beer. I should not even review this. It is that old friend that I can always depend on. It is easily available at my local pub. I will admit that it is a mass produced beer. However, among the others it stands out as a time tested favorite of generation after generation of brew aficionados."
"Overall: A good beer. Done for centuries for a reason. It's not outstanding or innovative in any way shape or form, but it's arguably worth its price."
"Overall: decent but nothing extraordinary. I have to wonder how much this recipe has changed since it began production. One of my favorite things is drinking beer that's been around for a long time and well, if I was a British beer drinker in a pub in 1800 and I could order a Bass or any porter, stout, mild, or bitter... I would definitely choose anything but a Bass. Still, worth it just because this is one of the iconic British Pale Ales and its important to know where you're coming from. Cheers!"
"Though I prefer beers with a heavier flavor, Bass will always hit the spot on a warm day."
"Much better than the bottled version. Drinkable and actually somewhat enjoyable."
"Overall Drinkability - If it wasn't for the metallic aftertaste that puts a strong damper on the drinkability of this beer, it might be something I wouldn't mind having again."
"Overall a nice macro-brew, nothing outstanding but definatly not pee water like certain pseudo-macro brews. Has a nice medium mouthfeel with slight carbonation. Very balanced session beer."
"D- A solid go to import beer that would be a last resort if there were not viable craft beers available. Very drinkable session beer."
"Tastiest Bass I remember having. Great example of pale ale. I really enjoy the balance of delicious sweet malt flavor and the hops throughout. Also had a great reddish brown color. Very drinkable, good mouthfeel. Could drink a whole bunch of em! Overall very good pale ale."
"The packaging is nice too with a parchment-style label, making it look the way it probably did a hundred years ago."
"Served from tap into a sampler shaker. Poured yellow-orange with a minimal pure white head. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, slight fruit, and slight hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, wheat, subtle banana, and slight skunky hop. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this wasn't too bad for a readily available mass produced brew. One of my gripes is that the aroma and flavor on this one were not very intense at all. Sure this would make it easier drinking, but kills the beer in my opinion. It is still a good gateway brew or a go-to when in a pinch, but that's where I leave it."
"Overall, a decent brew. I haven't had this in a very long time so it was nice to revisit it."
"D- This is a good rich brew, alittle sweet, but again, I would recommend this beer to any one who wants a good english beer, I understand why its been around for quite sometime."
"Over all drinkable light bodied ale, but not spectacular. More like a mass production product."
"Ever since the Bass destined for US consumption has been brewed in upstate New York, the Beer Advocate ratings have slumped. This is a case of ""haters gonna hate."" Bass Ale is still the best g-damn beer out there, and the keg of it that I just bought the other days attests to that."
"A nice easy ale. Has survived for 200+ years for a reason."
"So I give a lot of pride to beers with a history to them. I think it's awesome that this beer was the flagship brew on the Titanic. That makes me want to try beers like this. To me it's kind of like time travel, you can put yourself in a specific time and place and get a little idea of how things were during that time. Bass Ale has the history but it's not the greatest historical brew I've had. Every time I've tried it, it seems for be on the flat side. It's got a really nice color to it but the hops and malts used just don't please my palette that much. I know a lot of people who love Bass but I've just never been able to enjoy it."
"D: Decent drinkability. More than a few can be had comfortably."
"D: Overall, decent take on pale ale, but overly sweet for my tastes."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, the beer pours a vibrant orange-copper coloring, crystal clear, with a thick, foamy, big bubbled off-white head of about an inch and a half. The nose is subtle, with a blend of hops and citrus. The beer has a semi-sweet malty backbone, with a bitter hop that is not overpowering in flavor, but your mouth absolutely knows it's there. Some nutty and candy-like characteristics to the flavor, as well, but that subtle hops remains vigilant in balancing all the tastes. The beer has a slightly sour aftertaste, but the finish is fairly quick. It leaves the mouth just a bit puckered, and begs to be quenched with another drink. Tasty brew."
"D - Good. I could certainly have multiples of this but it is a rich brew and I suspect would be quite filling after a couple."
"Notes: This is an excellent English Pale Ale. One of my favorite session beers."
"Drinkability - A nice, simple, classic PA. I like this one for the unique blend of flavors you get. Pretty sessionable. Nice beer."
"d: smoooth as all hell, this is a staple of mine and i would not mind enjoying one at all hours of the day, a personal favorite"
"Drinkability - I wouldn't turn it down under any setting. Good for cold days and warm days and days when I just want to get messed up a little."
"Pours a deep coppery color with a thick yellowish white head and a little bit of lacing. Smells of sweet malts and a little earthy hops. Tastes much the same with earthy hops, a ton of sweet malts, and a little bread and some metallic flavor. Mouthfeel is thick and oily with a mild carbonation. Drinkability is okay."
"D- This beer has a light flavor profile and a low ABV making it easy to drink. I wouldn't go out of my way to have this beer although if it was one of the choices at a bar with other BMC beers I would go for this easy."
"It's a balanced beer, though. Plenty of flavor, but nothing dramatically interesting. Those sweet caramel malts register first, then the hops give it just a touch of a bitter ending, barely worth mentioning. The flavor coats your mouth for awhile. You don't forget what you've drank after the swallow. It's light or barely medium bodied, but the taste sticks around."
"Pours a copper transparent body with a 1.5finger head. Smells of cooked veggies, a slight pinch of hops and a bit of a metallic aftersmell. Tastes of hearty bread with a lingering dryness provided by the hop bitterness and alcohol. Feels quite smooth and appealing to have another. Overall, a classic English pale ale and just a fun beer to have out of the bottle or on tap!"
"This would be a great session beer, or a good choice if the place doesn't have much of a selection."
"Drinkability - to have on tap as a selection i was impressed, overall a good beer with some decent flavour."
"D: Its a good session beer but not really what I'd reach for in the mood of a pale ale, more of a hotter day type deal."
"Usually pours as black and tan to complement my Guiness (half n half) into pint glass. Pours a translucent light copper with a one finger offwhite head. Nose is sweet, malty, mild herbal hop aroma, some yeast esters. Flavor is sweet, caramel, crisp, mild hop feel with little to no bitterness. Palate is a tad thin and sweet and lacking in hop bitterness."
"This is a pleasant pale ale that is best consumed with a variety of foods from pretzels to steak."
"not my beer, I'd reach for a ""mass marketed"" beer before grabbing this again."
"Not too bad. It's a pleasant enough fellow that does not demand too much attention"
"Poured a big 3"" head which quickly dissipates to nothing. Lovely deep golden color. Faint smell of citrus. Not a lot of taste to speak of but mildly sweet with a slight hint of malt. An inoffensive and easy to drink pale ale which perhaps even a non-beer-drinker would like. No wonder it's an old standby classic, but also no wonder the craft beer drinkers aren't too impressed with it."
"A nice typical EPA, very good example of the style. Very predictable quality. Good beer to bring to a party as many people seem to enjoy,but nothing too special. It seems to be very available in our area. I enjoy more as a black & tan with Guinness, but will gladly drink a few alone."
"D: Nothing exciting for sure, but drinkable nonetheless."
"Bass Ale is one of my favorite beers. Not super easy to find for me where I live, but when I do you better bet I buy it."
"D: Drinkable, but not a huge amount of flavor. Definitely on the light side and you could probably have a few of these easily."
"D. Yeah, I could drink a few of these without hesitation especially if no other craft options existed. Not something I would go out of my way to drink but, in a pinch, this beer works fine."
"D: Very drinkable. I slugged it back pretty well."
"While this pale ale doesn't do anything to offend, it doesn't necessarily stand out. Of course, it was the world's first pale ale, so it sort of set the standard for what would come. Definitely worth going after again."
"D: Very drinkable. Should be a little bit more bitter to be perfect :)"
"Interesting ale with a fascinating smell."
"Drinkability is good. I will take a pint any day. Overall solid mass produced pale ale. This is a standard for all pale ales that has many good and a few bad traits about it."
"D: Easily drinkable, smooth, malty. Overall good beer."
"Although, it could be a Pale Lager."
"ok beer. not really all that impressed. bored after 2 or 3. drinkability is ok. but like i said kinda boring. just an average pale ale. not impressed with the smell, although ok with the mouthfeel. had it in a bottle. feel this brew may be better on draft at my local pub."
"This beer is so clear you can read through it. The color is nice! It's almost identical to the bottle it came in with a touch of amber. The head was pure white and very thin. The nose has a lot of sweet malt and a doughy bread. The first taste I get is the skunkiness. However the skunky taste is very mild and then opens up to a walnut and grain. The finish is mild and simple making it pleasant to sit back and enjoy. I think this is a good beer for sitting around at your favorite pub. Simple and satisfying."
"Pours a golden-orange color, white head, high level of carbonation. Taste is mostly sweet malts, only slight hop taste. Overall it's a very refreshing, highly drinkable beer, has a light body. Reminds me of a slightly more flavorful lager, appearance is similar. Bass is decent in a bottle, would need to try it on tap too. I'd choose Bass over a lager but it's not one of the best Pale Ales I've tried, it's decent for a macro beer though."
"D: This ale is very drinkable and one that I will drink again."
"A pale ale of some stature, if the endorsements on the label are any indication: Napolean, Manet and Buffalo Bill are listed as some who fancied the brew."
"Very bready. That was my first impression, but it wasn't in a negative light. Since no one I know drinks Bass I wasn't sure what to expect really, but I was pleasantly surprised as how drinkable it was. Very balanced, and like I said, with a bread-like tone it was enjoyable and you can consider me a fan. Average carbonation and mouthfeel, which makes it good for socializing in my opinion. It's highly sessionable."
"Light bodied... super easy to drink... a good bar beer for sure."
"Drinkability - not terribly complex in its taste, but otherwise a pretty decent brew. It might be just a hair more bitter than I'd like, but still not too bad."
"D This is a super easy beer to drink and the cask version is easier to drink than the bottled version. 4.5"
"Overall, this beer delivers what you should expect from one of those beers that is a step up from the unmentionables. It is serviceble and nice to have around, but you are not going to use it to demonstrate your good taste in beer."
"D- Moderate to high. Has a little too much of a dry finish for me though and the only thing that would keep me from rating the drinkability higher."
"Check on re-review: no changes."
"Overall, this beer is better than a lot of mass-produced beers and I've enjoyed drinking my way through this case, but it's not stellar. For a pale ale, I'm going American all the way. Decent, though."
"I can't even write anything pithy about this beer. Bass is just a boring product. If the English malts were more interestingly developed this would be a different story. Better malt character, less generic taste, and Bass would have something to work with."
"D: The astringency adds a dimension to the beer that counters the sweet and malty notes. I've had it with everything from steak to cookies and it plays a good part, though it plays some parts better than others. The relatively low complexity and moderate weight make it easy to drink - it certainly won't overwhelm you."
"Very good head from the pour; thick, fluffy, and stands about three fingers. Lasted about two minutes before settling down to a light covering, much like a very thin coat of ice on a still pond. Lovely lace that clings to the side of the glass with little break-up. Rich amber color, rating a 17 of the SRM chart. Aroma of open grain field of barley malt. Good full taste of malt and hops, with a slight nutty lingering. Not quite the carbonation I was expecting with the amount of head this brew produced, but still satisfying tickle to my tongue and palate. This ale is very refreshing and provides a very good flavor. Decent price, good taste, this beer rates high on my share with friends chart."
"The final Quizzo beer of the night. This one pours a clear pale russet topped by a finger of off-white micro-foam. The nose comprises toffee, biscuits, orange-y citrus, and that vague scent of helium (or whatever that is I smell when around balloon-filling stations. The taste holds notes of light caramel, unfocused citrus, flowers, bubblegum, and miscellaneous greens. The body is light, with a moderate, almost active carbonation and a crisp-ish finish. Overall, an okay brew, not something I'd go for very often, but good enough while discounted during Quizzo. (Oh, and by the way, we won!)"
"RJT"
"I enjoy this beer. It has a history that is both interesting and reassuring. The taste is slightly hard, with just the right amount of carbonation. Nothing too bitter about this beer. I feel as if most imports are overpriced, but when compared at the same price to beers like corona and peroni, bass is much better quality."
"Taste was better and more balanced. Some caramel sweetness -- just a bit -- and some bitterness for balance. Maybe a hint of earthy malt flavors, but not a lot. Solid, drinkable beer."
"Drinkability: Overall the subdued nature of this beer, combined with the clean mouthfeel, makes it an easy beer to drink although somewhat mundane. Don't think I'd ever crave this."
"I thought this beer had a taste like if it was flat. I bought a pitcher at a local pub and I really had a hard time enjoying it. it looked ok and the smell was not that bad, but the taste was just not there. I'm sorry but I do not recommend this beer. Who knows maybe ill give another chance in the future but I don't think so."
"A smoothe, slightly bitter taste balanced by sweet (honey and chamomile) slight as well. A well rounded beer, not bursting with flavor, but consistent and good."
"Drinkability- 4 out of 5. This beer is a great example of the English Pale Ale style. It's hardly a profound, earth-shaking beer, but Bass is delicious, balanced, and moderate enough that one could easily drink a six pack or knock back quite a few at the bar, assuming one didn't have to drive that night. The fact that many bars offer this alongside a mostly macrobrew-based selection makes it an enticing choice when you're out on the town."
"D- drinkable for sure, on the lighter side for an english beer but for the masses type of beer it's alright. Overpriced for what it is though"
"Not a bad beer, but a bit of a disappointment overall. Perhaps I was expecting too much."
"Drinkability: Certainly not a bad beer, though I know my overall grade for it will suck because of the appearance of it. That being said, it's not the best either. However, this is a good beer for sessioning and is easily available and very sessionable."
"Decent in the bottle, much better on tap. Don't drink this one too cold it taste quite odd, let it warm up close to cellar temperature."
"Overall a fairly boring English pale. Reportedly much better 10-12 years ago, before the InBev takeover. May try the cask version if ever in the UK for comparison's sake."
"Notes: Is it worth the import? No... Is it worth the drink in a barren landscape of macros without other worthy choice? Hmmm, yes..."
"Pours a clean and clear amberish brown with minimal head and lacing. Scent is of light carmel malts, roasted nuts, earthy and floral hops. Taste is earthy and slightly sweet - carmel malts and roasted nuts, again with earthy and floral hops. Lighter side of medium bodied, slightly slick, lightly carbonated. A beer that is not a bad option when presented with macros and the known imports."
"D - Easy and enjoyable to drink. Not a pale ale but a very nice unique beer in its own right."
"d- drinkable, i appreciate the history here, but there are many more pale ales that i would grab before this one. it does make one hell of a black and tan though."
"D - Quaffable... Simple... Easy drinking... Smooth... Nothing special, but nothing really to complain about either... A staple of mine before truly discovering craft beer, this is still a viable alternative when necessary..."
"D- easy drinking for sure and not all that bad. Just not the best."
"A good back up beer for me."
"Pours an amber color with a bubbly but rather thin head. Aroma was alright; a mix of bready malts and butter. However it was rather weak. Taste was similar to the aroma, standard english pale ale taste, just weak. Good thickness and carbonation. Overall a good beer that you can find almost anywhere at a good price."
"Pours a golden orange color with a 1/2 inch whitehead that had amazing retention ans huge sheets of lacing. Not much in the aroma department. What I could draw out of it was bready pale malts, with an extremely mild hopping. What hops are there are earthy and herbal. Taste is mild as well, but it's enjoyable to be sure. Light sweetness, bready, a touch of caramel thrown in for good measure, but it's certainly light, and extremely drinkable. The mouthfeel is my favorite part of this beer. There's a steady stream of carbonation bubbles, but it very soft and creamy and makes this increibly easy to drink. This is not some smack you across the face delicious beer, but it's very drinkable and I plan on putting a few of these down on the Sunday during some World Cup games."
"The mouthfeel is light and has a below average amount of carbonation. This goes down very easily, but honestly nothing here makes me want to go back for another. Not a bad choice if there's not a great selection, but honestly not something I will purchase a second time."
"Drinkability: Good. Could easily drink 2-3 in a sitting."
"It was drinkable, but not real pleasing."
"I had this on tap twice and both times it was a winner. I get the bottle version as well that is good but not nearly as good as the draft! This is just a great all around beer. It is one that I know I can get on draft and just have a very good beer. The bottle version, while not nearly as good as the draft is one of my go to beers when I want something good but not to complicated."
"Pours a clear golden brown. Aroma is light roasted malt & bready sweetness. Flavor follows the aroma, along with a bit of metallic taste. Not much going on in the hops department. Light bodied, with easy drinkability."
"Body is thin, carb low even for the style. I need something to add a refreshing factor to the beer, but it isn't happening here."
"The thing that sticks with me most about this beer is its tangy finish. The flavor is robust on the tongue upon first tasting, but a tart citrus finish lingers in for a good while after sipping. It's a decent session beer, easy to drink, but all in all nothing terribly special."
"Slightly robust with a sharp bitter aroma. Preferably with a nice warm guiness. Have you ever rasied a shotgun in the air and had a nice bite of lemon butter chicken well this beer would go well with that situation. Wonderful beer but named after a fish."
"Pours a three-finger white head that fades slowly, leaving a good lace. Nice,deep crystal clear amber color. Light-medium carbonation and light bodied. Nose is light hops. Flavor is light caramel and hops. Dry, light hop finish. $1.85 for a 12 oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"Drinking this beer makes me want to drink another."
"An easy drinking Pale Ale. Not enough going on to hold my interest over a session, but it's a pleasure to drink one every now and then."
"D: Goes down very easy and can be good enough for a session beer. Smooth beer."
"It does have a nice appearance, a good looking amber color with a good head on it. But the aroma is barely there, and such is the case with the taste as well. It's rather bland, even in comparison with other English Pale Ales. I'd say that even Tetley's far outstrips Bass. The body is okay, if a little over-carbonated and it's drinkable. It is, after all, what I usually order at the local pubs. But, were there some other EPA on tap, I'd surely order that instead."
"Either way it's slightly confusing, but all the flavors are quite muted. Nothing really asserts itself, which makes this even stranger."
"Ohhh yea. I had a couple of these with dinner the other night and it hit the spot. Such a beautiful color, and a great filling taste. It's one of the few beers with some body that I could drink a lot of. I don't know why I don't drink more of these. I think I will start."
"D-Very drinkable, I'm thinking of picking up a keg for my Forth of July party."
"This was a pleasant surprise. I would have walked 5 miles for this 20 years ago. With the new craft ales this doesn't stand up so well but this is still a very good ale in the English style."
"Overall, this is one of my favorite beers. It's not too bitter for someone like me with a sweet tooth and doesn't have any surprises. Definitely a beer to keep around for dinner time."
"From 1 pint 9 oz nitrocan. Sampled on April 20,2010. Golden amber with 2 finger head. Sweet and crisp orange/caramel with little hops. Easy light drinking, smells sweet and fresh. Balanced carbonation. Highly drinkable, not as the most pale ales and not as bitter."
"Conclusion: Loved it back in the day, was one of my BMC-to-craft in-betweens...sadly can't find the love for it anymore..."
"Poured into a Bass pint. Pours a clear rich amber color with a creamy/big bubbled head that hangs around a while before slowly going into a film with minor lacing. Mild malty and bread aroma with slight sour notes. Clean malty taste with subtle hints of caramel and a slightly sour finish. This was one of my go to beers back in my college days. I feel this brew does not get the love it deserves being the original pale ale and all."
"Overall: Considering I haven't had many/any beers similar to this, I know I'm not the expert. But Bass as a great foreign beer that is easily found."
"All around not too bad but not my first choice. Perhaps it would be better in a black & tan"
"12 oz bottle. Pours an ultra clear amber. Sparse carbonation, fluffy off-white head that tapers off soon enough, leaving a trail of lacing. I'm not getting a ton of aroma, mainly sweet, modest grains and some fresh grass.. Taste is fairly smooth, flat, and perfume/floral-like with a bitter twang at the end. Finishes like a pale ale, leaving enough balance of flavor and dryness to inspire another drink."
"This is a very pretty beer. It has a very large foamy head that takes up 90% of the glass when poured. The color is amber with just a slight haze. The smell is sweet with caramel and toffee. It also has a good English style yeast to make it almost butterscotch like. Then taste is close to the aroma with the exception of being a bit astringent. The palate is smooth but not thick enough. Overall a good session beer but it falls short of greatness."
"Drinkability-wise, this one does the trick. Not too complicated in terms of flavour (but not too boring either) and very easy drinking. An ideal session ale. I would drink this beer again."
"Swamp water copper color with a thin white head. Swirly skim retention. Aroma is identical and indicative of taste: fruity esters, minerals, and a dry, spicy herbal hop. The quintessential English pale IMO. Not my favorite, but a standard nonetheless."
"O: A good beer for the masses [in England]."
"The classic english ale. Little head even with an aggressive pour. Nice brown/amber color. Smells a little bready. Not a huge nose. Taste is of carmel malts with a very mild hop profile. Fluid mouthfeel. Nice clean finish. Drinkable for sure. Good session pub ale."
"Drinkability: Goes down very easy due to low ABV. A common and simple brew that just hits the spot for me tonight when I don't want anything complicated. I know this doesn't get rave reviews, but I like it a lot. For those days when you don't want an assault on your taste buds, this is a good choice. It's very mild, but yet still tasty."
"The taste is wonderful. I am struggling placing the taste as much as I can with a heavier beer but this is smooth and taste great. Let me give one disclaimer. I typically can't stand pale ales but this one hits the mark for me."
"D- Ok not really anything special here at all. I think I will pass on this one from now on."
" D- This beer has a big hop bite with not much malt support or even hop aroma or flavor."
"Taste, no discernable hop quality, seems unbalanced, malt domination. So little hops, the ratio makes it feel like a lame malt bomb. Very much an earth, dirt, tree taste to it. Not the most enjoyable beer, but it isn't horrible. Pricey for what you get."
"Screw you InBev-AB."
"Did I drink it too cold perhaps? (38 deg F)"
"Nose very grass that is at once think of grass and spices. Smells malty with pronounced touch of honey. Dense on the palate, a little curry now. Final loud enough and persistent, always with the same malt flavors. Quite convincing, despite a very special touch and especially in rough aftertaste. A standard in the Special Pale Ale style without being transcendent."
"Notes: This is one of those beers that is a good stepping stone and introduction. Shows off the typical flavors that you think of in British beers, just not as well as some other good ones."
"Conclusion: Good example of a English Pale Ale. I never heard of it before, but it seems from reading other reviews this is a quite common beer, and I think I can see why it is. I like it."
"Overall: Nice, quiet, good looking, and a bit generic."
"Easy enough to drink a few in a sitting"
"d) Lovely beer"
"D: pretty drinkable, seems like a lite craft beer to me. I AM DISAPPOINTED."
"Notes - I used to drink this beer all the time when I was in graduate school. Now it seems kind of one-dimensional and overcarbonated. I was honestly expecting better. It's still not bad, and it could serve as a good gateway beer, but it's miles away from a good English Pale."
"Overall for a pedestrian cheap macro it isn't bad, this bottle seemed to be not as good as previous one's I have had."
"D - Could easily drink only this in an evening. Wish I had bought more then one can."
"From the 355 ml. bottle L8331SK-13:24. Sampled on January 10, 2010. The famous old stand-by that pours a decent looking amber-copper color with a thin white head that dissolves into a thinner ring. Limited lacing. The aroma is full of English caramel malts and the mouthfeel is medium. Bass has a distinctively English bitter taste with a slightly dry ending. I am not sure what I can add that has not been said before. It has always been one of my go-to beers."
"D - Very good beer with decent taste and low abv."
"D: could have any another, but didn't -- definitely would have preferred to have a Black and Tan"
"Very good drinkability, a tasty but understated beer, good & sessionable. What's with the crazy Bass glass with the feet & lop-sided mouth?"
"Bass Pale Ale is a typical example of an English Ale; however, it lacks life. It's a little too flat for its own good."
"Drinkability: very drinkable. No aspect of this beer is overpowering, and overall it is simply a tasty beer."
"D- This is definitely better on tap from what I can remember. I think it also makes a decent black and tan. Nothing off putting here, but not something I go out of my way to have."
"d - can work through a six pack of these nicely"
"Nothing bad about this beer, but nothing seems to stand out either."
"D=very, a very good sessionable beer."
"A perennial favorite."
"D- Good drinkability. This is one of the beers I go for when Im out or have little option."
"This is the type of beer where I say ""I really like this"" but hard to put your finger on just why. I see why the English has their own category of Pale Ale because this didn't resemble the American Pales much at all. The beer had layers of flavor but not amped up with hops or strange fruity overtones like a lot of Americans I've had. There was a tartness or twang to both the smell and taste that I liked, and while it didn't have a lot of sweetness I definitely got interesting malt flavors. I'll have to explore more of the English Pales."
"Pretty taste ale. Nothing special but solid and easy to drink."
"Overall it's very drinkable; I mean, it's Bass on tap, seriously. There is a sometimes overbearing fruitiness from the esters and honey-like malt. There is a definite sour-stale flavor, less than in the bottle. Unimpressive, but satisfying and decent."
"Minerally, mild malt with some mild hop's. I always enjoy the way the mineral's and special water mix with the malt. Its an enjoyable beer when heading to the pubs for some Fish and Chips. You just can't beat Bass for a nice pub food and ale beer. certainly doesnt match up to the big German, Quebec and Belgian Beers, but a nice pub beer for sure..."
"D - Highly drinkable. Not as simple as some pale ales. This beer has a great balance of smell and flavors. This would be good with burgers or tons of other foods. The flavor is complex enough to compete with what your eating but not so complex that it would dominate your meal and mask it's flavor. This is a good anytime beer."
"D- Hops- to sweet malt -to hops. Not a complex beer, but easy to drink with a nice, bitter aftertaste. Enjoy with red meats such as sausages, where the aroma can compliment a secondary flavor."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has an amber color with a 1/2 inch head. Smells of malts with a slight hint of hops. Tastes like it smells with a bit of sweetness. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and had good drinkability. Overall this is a quality beer."
"A dark clear copper color pour with a medium sized white head that dissipates quickly leaving traces of lacing , light carbonation . Aroma is semi sweet , malty with spicy english hops . Flavor is quite malty , semi sweet like the aroma , lightly bitter , slightly floral and spicy , a bit earthy with a faint hoppy finish . Medium body with an oily mouthfeel . Drinkable and sessionable but not too impressive to me at all , sorry ."
"Bought this one from the local packy. Pours a medium amber in color with a good two finger head and lots of lace. Biscuity malt with a slight caramel sweetness with light hops to balance. mouthfeel and carbonation are good. Drinkability? had no problem drinking several for this review."
"Drinkability: A decent pale ale but there are certainly better ones out there. Worth it if you can find it or afford it."
"Drinkability: A classic British ale. Sweet and bitter, with the bitterness winning out. I would reach for it if the craft brews weren't available."
"D: Surprised to find I hadn't reviewed this one yet as it is a beer staple. The prototypical ""step-up"" beer which stands about equal to Yuengling in my eyes but a notch below SA's Boston Lager. Not a bad brew at all and considering how it's often the best thing available at many bars, a safe haven for all brew lovers."
"drinkability also ok - it was the best option i had"
"Bass is an easy drinker however, maybe a little too easy for a Pale Ale. This is my first time having Bass on tap. I much prefer it to the bottle version."
"D: Refreshing it was but it wont be my first choice when i have a selection of others on tap."
"D: very sessionable. I could have a few if I wanted a couple of pints of decent beer. Nothing special, however. Classic english ale, but quite sutble and subdued."
"Cheers!!"
"This was an average drinker. I wasn't a big fan of this one really. Initially there was kind of a bad fruit taste, although it did get a little better as it went on."
"Drinkability: The most widely distributed EPA in the US is a nice, quaffable brew that doesn't stand out, but is a good backup beer (as it was tonight)."
"Pours a pleasing, medium copper with a moderate head. The head quickly subsides, leaving minimal lacing. Nice, moderately complex hops aroma. Taste is nicely balanced between malty background, and medium spicy hop notes. Mouthfeel is a standout; very smooth and round, with just the right carbonation. Somehow, the sum of the parts is exceeded by the whole. I'm not overly familiar with the English pale ale style, but I've enjoyed this beer for a long time, and find it highly drinkable."
"D - Not too heavy and not too light. A good balance with this brew."
"D: Great drinkability. Light bodied with understated but interesting flavors. Overall not a mind-blowing beer, but a good one."
"D: quite, i much enjoyed this and will purchase it again."
"tastes very flat, not what i remember of this brew. where is the carbonation? average blend of malts, bitter finish. aftertaste is good but wish this had more body."
"But it is easy to sit with friend and drink pitchers of this beer. I know I have."
"I had a Bass Ale at Nick & Jimmies for the first time in several months, since I join BA. It was always my old standby ""good beer"" before. It poured amber with a moderate head that lasted for a little while. The aroma was fairly quiet, I didn't get much. The taste was clean, crisp, slightly malty with little bitterness. More than a lawnmower beer. I liked it, but already admitted to a predisposition. A little carbonation for the tip of the tongue to play with. Drinkability is very good, I could happily drink a sixer of Bass."
"A decent beer but not comparable to most craft pale ales"
"I used to drink this in the bottle a number of years ago and my memories of that presentation are better so it may be a ""can"" thing."
"Pours a golden color with a one finger head. The aroma is of sweet breads with caramel notes and a faint floral hop. The taste is of a big malty sweet bread backbone with notes of caramel and a very little floral hop bite. The mouthfeel is of moderate carbonation. This is an average drinkable beer, nothing to turn you on or off, slightly above average beer."
"T/M/D - Low bitterness, with dominate malt flavors. Has a tinge of mineral and sulfury flavors a well. Mouthfeel is just a light to medium bodied feel. The drinkability is much easier on tap than in a bottle, but overall a very pleasant malty finish and good."
"look forward too drinking this again, good value"
"Served in a standard pint glass. Poured a translucent amber with a half inch, loose, off-white head the dissipated into a broken skim embedded with tiny ringlets; no lacing to speak of during the session. Nose reveals a hint of caramel, as well as a biscuity character. Taste consistent with nose with a slightly skunky quality that lingers at the finish. Mouthfeel is between light- and medium-bodied (but closer to the light end of the spectrum) with a consistent background effervescence from start to finish. A decent workhorse of a beer - nothing spectacular, but I wouldn't turn one down if offered."
"568ml brown bottle obtained at McKinnon's in Salem, NH. Pours a crystal clear dark amber body with a good inch of slowly-dissipating off-white head. Smells biscuity with some husky caramel and a tinge of herbal English hops. Biscuit, caramel, toffee, hints of nut, licorice, just the lightest touch of diacetyl (butter), with a good bite of herbal slightly minty and piney hops. Very well-balanced and in many ways subtle in flavor. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. An easy-drinker for sure. It's been years since I've had this beer and I have a new appreciation for it. Balanced and enjoyable, bright, drinkable... A bar for the course to be sure. Just plain good."
"D- Not normaly a pale ale fan but this one surprised me and will make me reconsider blowing off pale ales. Definitely will be another back up in case I'm someplace without much selection."
"D: Very drinkable and perfect for a warm Friday late afternoon. Also using it as a beer for home made onion rings. This is a decent and for the cost a quality deal."
"Overall I'm a fan of Bass. I like its taste and its usually fair priced. There are aspects i dont approve of, the ownership and other things. But because of its price it was the pale ale that made me like pale ales in the first place."
"D--More so than I anticipated. Good...not necessarily spectacular."
"Overall a decent ale on draft."
"Overall highly drinkable, goes down easy. A nice standby or gateway beer for friends."
"Very drinkable beer all in all and it's always been a favorite for me. Excellent beer to start people off into the world of better beer, too. Could it be more bold and complex?? Sure. But not all beers need to be like that and this is a great session brew."
"A decent beer, nothing special, good session beer to slam back."
"Being a fan of English ales, I initially thought this beer would be just a macro-esque type of imitation, but it truly is a good ""go-to"" beer."
"D: This is a great beer to have on draft, and as such makes for a very nice session brew. That said, I am not a big fan of pale ales but do enjoy them every once in awhile and this one is certainly no exception; probably one of the better of the style in my opinion (for the price, that is). Overall I found it a very enjoyable beer to have on occasion."
"On tap June 17, 2009. Amber color with moderate off-white head. Caramel, slightly sweet malts. A veery enjoyable brew on a warm day, especially on draft at an Brit's in Minneapolis. Above average, but nothing hits me as setting this beer apart. But within the atmosphere, bring me more!"
"This is definitely a go-to beer. It's not outstanding but it's readily available and easily drinkable."
"Verdict: Bass is simply a straightforward and sessionable British classic, and it's obvious why it has endured for so long. While it may not offer the serious beer enthusiast too much to ponder, it's still a satisfying and refreshing experience that really typifies the English Pale Ale style."
"Drinkability for a session would be great. A very easy going beer."
"D: Extremely drinkable as the feel is well-rounded and creamy. Nothing special, but nothing offensive in there either."
"Drinkability: It was pretty good and it's certainly something I wouldn't mind drinking again. With that said, however, I was not overly impressed."
"The color is a mix between gold and orange. Darker, but not dark. Not a proper color by any means. Pours clear and a nice head. Smell is good. Rather rich. And of course there is the taste. Not all of that. Not watered down by any means, just not what I want in a beer. Has a bitter touch to it and I do not like bitter though I know some really really like bitter. A bit of an after taste, but not a real bite. I could not drink this much. Verdict: try something else."
"It's drinkable, nice for a changeup, but there are better beers for the price and in the style."
"Overall this is a nice EPA, but it's nothing to write home about. A good standby."
"Drinkability: This was so flat it seemed like drinking water. Zero carbination. I think I would order wine before I would order this beer again."
"Drinkability is exceptional, best thing about this brew. To paraphrase R./D. Davies (other British imports)... Bass, I want to drink your brew, all of the time, all day, and all of the night."
"Mouthfeel: Not enough carbonation. You know when you put a 9-volt battery to your tongue? When I held the beer in my mouth, there was a similar tingling on my tongue, just not as strong."
"Poured from the bottle into my pint glass. Dark bronze in color and a bit orange. The head head is lasting a decent legnth of time. It's off white and consists of bubbles of medium size. Lacing sticks around as well. The smell is sweet, metallic, and spiced. Carmel and steel and a miniscule bit of hops. Bittersweet carmel and earthy sweetness in the flavor. Slightly metallic with a clean aftertaste. Kind of thin bodied and easy to drink."
"Drinkability - I could go for more, especially coming out cold from a tap."
"Final Thoughts: A pretty decent, beer. To me made better as a tag team with Guinness"
"I tried one after helping my brother do some landscaping work in Jersey before Mother's Day. Perfect thirst-quencher."
"Smells of malts and breads, pretty sweet smelling. Not too bad. Mouthfeel is extremely watered-down and slick. No crisp bite, no sharp carbonation, nothing. Flavor was like if someone soaked a biscuit in water for 2 days, pureed it, strained it, and drank the dessicant. This was one of the most watered-down, flavorless beers I've ever had. My wife even said this was really weak, and she doesn't know beers that well. Very disappointing. I'll possibly try to get my hands on a bottle and give that a try to compare, but I'm not that excited about it. Avoid."
"*All information taken from Martyn Cornell's ""Beer: The Story of the Pint", an excellent read for anyone interested in the subject."
"Overall: I'm really not sure what the fuss is all about, it lacks flavor all around except for the bitter taste of alcohol and tannins at the end. Not a good Pale Ale, I can think of dozens better"
"The taste was good. Slightly bitter, but very drinkable. The mouthfeel was light and sweet. Let's keep our fingers crossed that the beer we're brewing comes out just as good!"
"It's pale, smells like beer, tastes like beer with a tiny jibble of hops & more malt, & is easy to drink. This is the epitomy of an OK beer. Back in 1994 this was a great beer, & why I drank so many whiskey sours - because beer was OK, not great. Thank goodness for the beer revolution!"
"D - overall not much flavor, but balanced and easy to quaff"
"D: Fairly drinkable and not a bad fallback for when the selection isn't very promising. However, now that BA has ""enlightened"" me, I probably won't be seeking this one out as a premium beer any longer."
"First time from a can. Pours amber with a modest head and few lacings. Aroma is mild floral hops. Taste is sweet malts with a good amount of hop bitterness. Very well balanced. Carbonation is minimal as is typical of English beers. Mouthfeel is good with a medium dry bitter finish. Very sessionable if you like this type of beer and I do. A very nice alternative to an American macro."
"D-One Imperial Pint down...I think I might need a breather before #2."
"overall a decent beer. it's a fine session beer but nothing over the top."
"D- Low alcohol and a nice malt base make for a drinkable beer but I won't be ordering another pint."
"Feels light, very slightly clingy. Still a very drinkable beer, but no longer a favorite."
"Given it's reputation, I was disappointed in this beer. It was ok but there are much better pales out there. I wouldn't go out of my way to try this again."
"D: Classic english pale ale, I can always drink a Bass. Easy to drink, not complicated at all. Definitely a good beer to have at a pub after work."
"A quickly dissipating when poured into a glass. No lacing at all. The taste was a little metallic and had hints of caramel. Mouthfeel was about what I expected it to be, pretty average carbonation. The thing I couldn't shake was the after taste of alcohol. It was quite strong and ruined the beer for me. Color was a light red. Not an outstanding brew in my opinion. Probably won't try this brew again except to try their famous black and tan."
"Not much of a head when poured. And head didnt hang around very long. No lacing. Ale was kind of reddish yellow in color. Had a slight caramel smell with hints of alcohol. Actually very light smelling. Tasted very mild also. I didnt think there was much hops going on here. Tasted a little of alcohol and had a bitter aftertaste. Felt light in the mouth. I may of had my hopes to high on this one. I felt a little disapointed. I dont think I would buy it again."
"Pretty drinkable, because it's mellow, but I'm not crazy about it. My first English pale ale and I'm not really impressed. American pales I've had were much better. However, this bottle got hot in my car for a few hours, and that could have messed it up, I will rerate it if I have a better experience next time."
"This is better then I remembered it to be. A nice english pale ale. Very drinkable - nothing amazing - just a decent beer that is always a crowd pleaser - from the old geezers to the young bucks. Decent"
"Not a bad little brew at all... I liked it and will have it again.."
"Drinkability- Pretty high. This reminds me of a subdued Sam Smith's Old Brewery Pale Ale, and given the price and availability, I think it'll be one I go to now and then when in the mood for the style."
"drinkability is very good, definitely could have a session of these."
"Beer has a decent heft to it which is appropriate for the style. Nothing offensive here. An easy drinker, but with more flavor than your typical macro, but also nothing overly distinguishing."
"High clarity amber-gold, initial one finger head that fades after the first sip. Some lace and light skim on the surface. First whiff caught an estery hint, bit after that it faded, leaving faint traces of inoffensive English malt. Very slight hop bite, hard to tell if its hops or astringency. Soft malt flavor, a touch nutty. Light bodied ale, the quaff factor is it's strong suit. Hopefully this will make a nice black & tan..."
"This is one to try, but not from a can. On tap it's good."
"Definitely drinkable. Definitely a good session beer. I must admit, I came into this thinking this would be just another average beer, but I actually enjoyed it. Sure, it doesn't have a lot of taste, and its extremely simple. But if I wanted a bigger, tastier beer, I wouldn't have reached for this one. I did, and it gave me exactly what I was looking for. A solid, simple, enjoyable beer that I will most likely be buying again."
"I'm drinking this as I type on my iPhone in LAX. What can you say about this old standby. It's mild, good flavor, nothing super memorable. Basically, has anyone in the history of beer drank this and said , ""man this sucks""? I doubt it. It's what every macro should aspire to. It's also quite pretty, great color and head."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, medium bodied, and mildly carbonated. Nothing like having it on cask but still good from the bottle. Drinkability is very good with low alcohol and a dry finish that keeps me coming back for one more sip."
"Appearance is a dark golden amber with a fair head and no lace. Smell has a sweet malt aroma with dark fruitiness. Taste has a sharp bite of malt with a light dull metallic taste. Mouthfeel has good body and carbonation. Makes for an easy enough session, but not one I would specifically look for again."
"Not a bad beer, but I think a little over priced."
"D: Not amazing. A good example of the style, certainly deserves the respect it gets around the world."
"Drinkability - it's one that has good qualities but I'd pass on to a better product if available."
"D- Pretty good session beer. nothing really jumps out but a decent brew."
"overall-- this is a go-to beer for good flavor and exceptional drinkability. you've probably been living under a rock if you havent tried this yet-- but dont let that stop you from going out and buying some"
"This beer pours a medium dark amber colour, with a small amount of wispy white head. The smell is light, and floral, with a bit of sweet malt. The taste is mostly sweet caramel malt, a little muted British hops, and a bit too much carbonation, leading to an off dry finish. The body is on the thin side, but it's still a very drinkable pub ale."
"From a 12 oz. bottle poured into an imperial pint. Amber colored, clear with a small beige head of tight bubbles. Aroma is light of buttery toffee and earthy/floral hops. Taste is smooth, clean malt with a touch of caramel and hop flavor coming through. Light, easy drinking, balanced, without being offensive to the palate."
"Overall I have t o say I was not as impressed by this one as I thought I would be as I had heard some good things about this beer. Not something I personally would be out looking for again."
"Don't drink and review."
"Comments: Not very strong carbonation especially since the pour showed a lot of carbonation. Taste was a little harsh and bitter at first but towards the end of the glass the the taste was mellower and sweeter (may have been temp.)"
".... Bill"
"Drinkability is high, very refreshing beer. Obviously a classic.. if napolean and manet liked bass, its gotta be good right? lol"
"OVERALL IMPRESSION: I would buy this beer again if I wanted something light to drink with pub food or if I was raking leaves in the fall. It's thirst quenching, pleasant, and actually has a bit more character than some other pub ales I've tried. It's not going to wow you with character, complexity or strength, but then again I don't think that's the goal of pub ales. Instead, drink this beer if you want to toss quite a few back and have an easy drinking beer. I only wish I could get it with a nitro widget to add to the experience. ;)"
"No real head on the pour, but I have a lingering foam over the body. Soapy looking bubbles around the ring, and a cloud over the center of the body where the engraved D is working with the carbonation. Clear amber body with carbonation flowing through it. Smell is slightly sweet and a ting of hoppiness is there. Carbonation is the first thing I taste, then a slight sweetness. Soda characteristics. First brew of the night and the hops aren't coming out for me. Easy to drink but not a really appealing-full flavor in it. I will save the rest for after I finish some palette destroying brews. Interesting to go back and look at something you've only had when you started drinking years ago. Lacing on the glass lingers for a while before joining the rest. A decent starter EPA for someone just getting into beers."
"Not too heavy, quite easy to drink but not a lot of flavor and it is not incredibly delicious."
"D: I like EPAs a lot but this was a bit of a disappointment for the style."
"Smell is primarily of orange and caramel malts. Clean and rather unvarying and with some intermingled hops evident upon agitation. Taste of caramel follows seamlessly from the nose and finishes smoothly. Unvarying as was the nose, the flavor is decent and is followed by a lingering light bitterness. Less bitter than I recall on tap and with a touch less body, making for and easy drinking ale, though I think the sweetness would become an issue in time, and the carbonation doesn't keep a stronghold long enough for the pour."
"D: Medium drinkability, I am still trying to give this beer a chance, since I like the style a lot I will try to understand it's nature before I condemned it. I am not sure that I will buy a 12 pack again."
"Overall a very solid EPA. I would definitely have it again."
"This most recent tasting...I really didn't taste much, honestly. For a pale ale, even an English pale ale, I couldn't detect much hop flavor. Side-by-side, it tasted uncomfortably like my mother's MGD, with the added mineral-y flavors. Just not impressed."
"(3.0/5)"
"I always enjoy hearing what people say about Bass ale. Its been a long time favorite of mine and every steak dinner I have is always with a Bass ale."
"I poured a 12 ounce bottle into a pilsner glass. It pours an clear amber with an attractive head. The smell was sweet with some herbal notes. The beer is smooth and clean. A slight bitternes from the hops is the predominant flavor and it has a slight sweetness to it. IMO the beer is a bit on the thin side. The beer is very sessionable and goes well with most foods."
"Pours clear dark brown with a 1/4 inch head. Only slight retention and very little lacing. Smells of a sweet malt and hops. A decent example of an English Pale Ale. Tastes of hops with an earthy flavor. The malts are sweet and leave a dryness on the tongue. Overall, a sweet flavor followed with the bitterness of hops and a little dryness. After a couple you can feel the warmth due t the strength of these. Worth a try if you have one available, but not worth going out of your way to find."
"Pours clear amber with a 2-finger off-white head. Caramel and bread aroma, but kind of sour. Acidic bite to the relatively sweet caramel malt taste. Almost as if the crystal malt got out-of-whack. Used to drink more of this, but the hangover is a real bitch."
"Flavor is malty, lightly toasted and a touch sweet, with a soft fruitiness and a little balancing hop in the finish. Nothing off or offensive, nothing spectacular, just an all around solid beer. Drinkability is high, though the sweetness compounds slightly after 3 or 4, which can have you looking for something a bit more hoppy."
"Great appearance, and decent overall atmosphere. Good solid flavor."
"I havent had a Bass in quite some time, but the taste is unique. I suppose this is an iconic beer or at least solid drink"
"It's a session beer - not a ton of character, but what there is is very pleasant."
"Not bad at all, much to my surprise. It's actually a pretty well made English style pale ale."
"An okay beer, there are much better pale ales out there."
"D - Bass is one of the beers that proved to me that beer can actually have taste. Even though it seems lighter now than it did a few years ago, this is still a well made mass produced, easy to get just about anywhere beer. It's easy to drink and doesn't drain the wallet."
"O- Decent. Better than most macro offerings. Comprable for me in bottle form to michelob's new beers."
"Had this at a work function - nothing else to choose from and we all know that drinking makes it easier to be with people from work away from work...Not much I can really say that ~100s of other people have already siad. Poured a darker amber color with a larger sized off white head. Non-descript aroams. Sweet malty tasting."
"light in the mouth very easy to drink and much enjoyment has been had with this beer in my hands"
"D: Very drinkable; not a heavy ale by any means."
"D - Not much going on - very easy to drink."
"Body pours an amber brown color, with a white head. Aroma is slightly sweet. Palate has a pale dryness to it. Not much flavor, but doesn't have an aftertaste either. Might be a little flat."
"D- I could drink this all day long. Very tasty with a flavor that is very unique.The taste is probably one that you like or don't like, but its different. I bought this to make make Black and Tans(my quickie mart was out of Smithwicks and Harps)so I figured lets try it and see how it tastes all by itself. I will probably buy more of this in the future."
"When I saw it is a Pale Ale I thought there would be more hops coming through on the finish but I was disappointed. Still a good beer and I will drink another."
"D: Overall, this is a very drinkable beer, not a heavy ale, but a lighter bodied quality ale that is easy to take down in large quantities."
"Not bad drinkability, nothing remarkable or terrible about this beer."
"Pours an amber with a white head that last a good while, it looks good but the taste is where it goes horribly wrong. Has a watery mouthfeel with a nasty metallic aftertaste. Its bitter but not a hoppy taste, almost artificial/chemical taste. I do not recommend this beer,run Forrest run away from this one!"
"This beer is a mass produced English Pale Ale that is decent, but lacking all complexity. It pours a nice amber color, decent head, no lacing. This beer is plenty carbonated. The aroma is definitely earthy, caramel malt, slightly musty. This is a dry beer, quite light, quite drinkable because of its low ABV. The taste is earthy malts, some light caramels, diaceytl and buttery, but not cloyingly so. What you get on the front end is how the beer finishes. There isn't much complexity to the beer. Not much to say because it doesn't have loads of character either, but it is drinkable."
"Pours a reddish orange body with a thick, crisp white head--classic ale body...nice misty lacing as glass drains... toffee, malt and some metallic pilsner hints.... hops are mellow if not subtle... carbonated, medium-bodied ale that settles the mouth more like a lager... quite drinkable, but somewhat slick... malty caramel tones with toffee--smooth, but neither buttery, nutty or hoppy--hmmmm... as a mass-produced ale, Bass holds its own and is still a pleasant choice, especially when considering its availability at most drinking establishments and even some house parties... consistent and familiar..."
"There Be Pirates After That Beer"
"It is cool that this now available in BC in cans as I dig decent imports in tall cans. This has always been a pretty beer to look at with its tall head and dark tan body. The nose is biscuity and kinda malty. The taste is very soft but tasty with flowery hop notes and a nice malty finish. A classic beer that is still nice to drink especially in a can where the beer tastes fresher."
"D-4.5 - I am not a huge fan of Pale Ales, but I really dig Bass EPA, and it is always around if you need something familiar. I can always count on Bass EPA for a drinkable session beer."
"Overall, a very well put together pale ale, one of the ""classics"". While it isn't remarkable or surprisingly different, it is always delicious, easy drinking, and non-offensive, which is what I think the brewers are going for. If the ABV was a little less this would be an even better session ale (that's not to say it isn't already, but it's at the high-end). Another plus is you can find it in most places for not too bad a price. Check it out if you haven't!"
"D- Drinks good"
"On tap at 99 Bottles in Santa Cruz. Light caramel color with a creamy tan head that leaves gobs of lacing. Aroma is modest, with overripe dark fruits and toasted malt. Flavor is very similar. Light and tart dark fruits, sweetbread malt, earthy English hops. Mouthfeel is smooth and luscious but this comes at the expense of adequate carbonation. Also the flavor is not robust enough to match the body. Decent and drinkable beer, but nothing spectacular."
"The taste is bnot great, but pretty good. It is mildly toasty, leafy-caramelly, and leafy, fruity (mostly plums and raisins) with grain and a faint vanilla hint, light buttery quality and feel, then a light leafy bitterness, and some mineral. The flavours are, overall, pleasant and it's fairly well balanced. However, it's flavours are a bit on the subdued side, it has a definite thin, mineral-water quality, flatness in the finish, and the aftertaste is lightly acrid. It is somewhat reminiscent of the likes of Abbot Ale in terms of basic character, but more muted, less flavourful, less interesting, thinner, and rougher. With food, it often tends to degrade, becoming more roughly alcoholic with little flavour but thin, acrid leaves. Alone or with certain foods, though, it is pretty good."
"Pretty much a standard English Pale. I've had plenty of times before, especially on-tap where the options are limited (surprised I haven't reviewed much earlier). There is something stale-ish that I continually notice. That aside, it's not bad, and it almost has a maltiness and light hop touch that make it stand out, but there's also ""something"" - an apple-y and buttery quality and a general stale-ish-ness/blandish-ness that would make me want to pick other English Pales over this. Still, a decent brew if you're caught in a limited option scenario."
"Considering how much I used to love this stuff versus the American macros, it's a bit of a letdown. It is very easy to drink and has an ok profile, but it doesn't beg to be consumed over and over. Still, better than anything from the big three."
"Drinkability: Really? A pale ale? Better than most cheap beers and that's about it."
"Drinkability: The thumb points down! Painfully bland and generic."
"This poured a clear amber with off-white head. It smelled like caramel malt, lemon hops, cultured yeast, and a bit of mulled spice. It tasted like very sweet caramel and earthy brown sugar malts with slight grassy hops. It was slightly thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a sweet malty aftertaste. Overall this is a good mass production beer. It's reasonably clean and very drinkable. I actually enjoy the malty flavor quite a bit."
"D= This is an ok beer, not the best English style pale ale for sure. Its wide avalability makes it unavoidable."
"Just had a can of the Pub Pour version and it is noticibly better. Maltier and smoother. Better. British hop style. fairly good beer. Very nice fluffy full frothy head and plenty of lace. The bitterness is perfectly balance with the malt. This is definitely better than the orignal Bass."
"Moouthfeel was moderate in carbonation with some slickness."
"D> sure. Not often but if its all you got I'll drink it."
"Overall pretty decent, and cheap. Would definitely have this again."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink, but way too sweet and lacking the bitter flavor to impress against other pale ales; but a step up from the macro lagers"
"12 oz. bottle. Pours an orange/amber color with a very small, off-white head. Aroma was nutty, grainy from the malts, a bit of dough, and light pine from the hops, maybe some fruit (apple?). Flavor was sweet initially, but finished bitter. Decent session beer."
"D- very high I could drink many of these"
"The beer poured with a crisp, clear pure amber appearance. Thick head with some good lacing on the sides. Aromas had a metallic mix of hops and malts. Very floral-like aromas. Taste had a bittersweet, doughy aspect. Lots of malts and hops but they are a little imbalanced. The mouthfeel helps make the texture smooth and silky. Overall, pretty darn good."
"Easy drinkability, goes well with food."
"This was a solid brew that was a bit on the caramel side. I could drink these in a session very easilly and I'll definately be getting more since their widely available."
"This is a pretty nice, easily obtainable beer. One that has been in the past and easily could be a session choice for me. Pours an dark orange color topped with a moderate head and a pretty good amount of lacing on the glass. I prefer it out of the bottle vs on draft but both are good. The flavor is quite sweet with some fruits an extremely clean finish. Smooth, easy to drink. This is a beer I get often when out and not much is on the menu."
"Orange/amber color with a beige cap. Nice retention and good lacing. Unusual nose and slightly musty like old wood but hops do emerge. Good mouthfeel and quite smooth. Well balanced hops and malt without being notably one or the other though it does slide (as the aroma suggests) towards hops. Some hazelnut hints. Medium body and light to medium carbonation. Clean finish."
"D: A little better than average. I'm a simple beer drinker, and this is much more complex than my usual fair; but, that doesnt mean I wont come back again =)"
"A drinker by far. You can hit these pretty hard and not get sick o them. On tap is superior, but the bottle stands up fine."
"Drinkabilty for me is good. I'm going to grab a 6'er of this this weekend and enjoy it camping. For reference I had this with a dinner of grilled chicken, pickles, and home made french fries. Outstanding."
"Overall: decent yet uninspiring."
"Drinkability is moderate. This beer has decent flavor and is easily sessionable."
"D - drinkiability would be higher if it tasted better, simply. Not as good as I remember."
"MF&D - The creamy taste makes this thin to medium body ale seem a bit fuller. Good session ale, I just wish the flavor was as big as the aroma."
"D - Easy drinking, a fairly mindless affair, but the sweetness deters after a few."
"D- I've always enjoyed this beer in bars as long as the beer lines are clean, otherwise it can lead to some interesting tastes. The hard water used in this beer gives it an interesting taste."
"This is a very good ""can't loose"" ale, everytime I have one I really enjoy it. Pours a nice copper/amber color with a really good soft head. The aroma is sweet and malty. Gentle going down the hatch with a nice finish. The taste is very good, sweet and malty with a hint of some bittering hops. This is a good beer to enjoy with dinner, it goes with most dishes, and it easily available."
"Pleasant aroma of caramelized malts, some earthy notes. Attrcative appearance, a reddish orange with a moderate white head, true to the style. Falvor is not remarkable, but is a good balance between caramel malts and grassy hops. The finish is appropraitely bitter. A perfectly acceptable beer, good on the railroad home after a long day."
"D: Sweet, dry and malty with a nice dry flowery hopping that's just enough to grab your attention makes this a decent session pale. Respectable drinkability."
"D- While not necessarily my first choice for a session beer Bass is very drinkable and would be a solid choice for sessioning."
"this one pours an almost orange amber, this one reeks of malt, and dosent disapoint, huge malty flavor followed by big hops. this one makes the purfict black and tan, it is just a bit thiner than i care for and could use more hops for my taste but all and all i love this one."
"Very Good Beer!!"
"I remember a better product, and this 6 pack was pulled out of a case sitting on a freshly arrived pallet at the suppermarket... my guess is it sat in a warehouse or two before it got to me, try and get this product fresh, it should be better than what I got."
"Definately a solid ale, I'd love to drink a few of these in a sitting."
"Had a few of these on tap this past weekend at Dillon's on Boylston Street. Poured into imperial sized pint glasses. Huge dark red color, no real head, only slight carbonation. Smell was of subdued hops. I enjoy drinking Bass, as I think it's a quality beer with a good flavor. My only two faults with it is a weird, almost thick, aftertaste I get in my mouth afterwards. And second, it's a bit on the heavy side for a somewhat hoppy beer. It's a good beer to grab when the selection sucks, but it's not one that I go after regularly."
"Notes...I do not recall having Bass before this session and I was pleasantly surprised. Bass is not an advenurous beer but that is its strength. It is a very good staple beer that I think would go very well with a wide range of food. I will certainly not hesitate to get this again."
"Okay beer but I would never have it again, nothing special."
"D - this is my first english pale ale is is a lot less bitter than many other pale ales. This makes it very drinkable and I love the apple cider finish. I like this beer a lot, but i'm not sure if I can justify spending $8.00 a six on it when there are so many other amazing beers out there in this price range. Maybe when a 12-pack is on sale..."
"Overall not horrible, but definitly not worth the money."
"Serving type: bottle"
"D: Nice, balanced, refreshing and easy to drink beer for most. A session beer for certain, I can see why it made it's way over here from Europe. Like mentioned in the heading of this review, if it's the restaurant's ""finest"" draught beer - and NOT Guinness, I'll reach for it again and again (And do whatever I can do to avoid the ""usual suspects"")."
"Decent head, and quite a bit of lacing. Definitely less hops than other pale ales, and more malt. Aroma was weak until I got to the bottom of the glass, when it got stronger, and very pleasant. Reminded me of caramels. Good smooth mouthfeel; not watery, with a nice tingle. Definitely a solid, but not spectacular beer, with real good flavor unless you're just drinking a pale ale for the hops."
"very mellow on flavors. some light hops in there, a berry like sweetness. it is creamy and very fizzy. light and drinkable."
"Bass really didn't stand out to me at all. I was kind of disappointed in it."
"This is one of the most beautifully colored beers I have ever seen, a clear copper-orange. Looks amazing as a black and tan. If I had first tried this about a month ago, I would have really loved it and given it a high flavor rating. However, I have since moved to the dark side and am a self-proclaimed hop head, and this brew is too malty for me. Does have a very clean aftertaste with hops to do the cleansing. Easy to drink with a mellow, sweet, malty flavor. Still can't get over the color"
"M/D: Overall, the beer left me wanting a little more from it. I was not overly impressed like I had been when I first tried Bass, but it was smooth and fairly pleasant to drink. This beer would not be my choice when at an establishment with a better selection, but it is a beer that I am sure that I will find myself ordering again."
"What we've got is a pretty full-flavored ale that has flaws small enough to overlook. It seems Bass Ale is a pretty common premium beer to be found in a bar without many craft beers, so its a good go to beer when your choices are limited to macrolagers and crappy imports. Its no chore to drink Bass Pale Ale."
"Bottled beer smells of roasted malts, and a faint whiff of hops. It pours an amber-brown color. It tastes of slightly sweet caramel malt, slight fruitedness in the middle, and finishes slightly hop bitter with nice rough carbonation. I usually like my beer ice cold, but I find the flavour (to borrow form the Brits) of this one to be better near the end of the bottle when it gets a bit warmer, strange..I know."
"A light brown color with a thin beige head. The nose is of dusty old malt and straw. The taste has some very mild malts and not much of a hop presence. The body is medium and would be nice if not for the fizzy carbonation. Nothing special, just a mild ale from jolly old England."
"Drinkability - With an average/ low ABV, and the watery smoothness, this is an extremely drinkable ale."
"The carbonation & mouthfeel is spot on here, but the sweetness and diacetyl is getting to me."
"D: Super drinkable. A great session beer."
"Poured a amber with some orange to it in color with a thin head. The head disappeared rather quickly leaving spots on the surface. The aroma is slightly dull as some malt and fruitiness is detected. The taste is of malt and bitterness which is balanced. Some fruit tones are detectable. The bitterness seems to arrive a little stronger on the tongue after swallowing. Not as flavorful as some other pales, but very drinkable. Much better on tap than in bottle by far."
"Bass is bass. I actually like this beer when I am in certain moods. Or if a pub or bar happens to have the Guinness on tap as well as the bass, then I can go for a Black and tan. For English beers there is better, but this is just my opinion. I do think Bass tastes better on tap then in the bottle, some stores tend to keep bass on the shelves too long and gets a bit funky to my taste."
"D- I could drink several of these, but I would find myself bored with it after a few more. Not as exciting or flavorful as other English brews."
"D: You can do it, you can do it all night. Great session that I need to order more often."
"D: For being mass produced, it tastes quite good, a pale ale I'd be happy to have any time."
"This is a great beer to come back to after you havent had one in a while. Like a relative who visits every once in a while; its nice to see them, but you dont want them to overstay their welcome."
"Pours clear, light reddish brown with 1/4"" head that dissipates quickly and leaves no lace. Very mild smell of malt with hint of sweet fruity sugar. Nondescript flavor that is light bodied with crisp texture. Overall, this is a decent session beer that is light and easy to drink. No bad flavors, but nothing to get too excited about either."
"Feels watery with a sweet burn on the way down. Milkier than expected. Soapy. It's disappointing. I generally like Bass on tap but out of the can it didn't hit the mark. Not awful, but subpar."
"Overall pretty good drink, but not really that great of a pale ale, if you try it you'll understand."
"Not a bad brew but nothing amazing either. This one is a good average ale that should be popular with snobby college kids that have the money to buy bottled beer rather then bud ice."
"cheers."
"Decent to good brew but overpriced here in Atlanta at $14.99 for a twelve pack."
"Nitro-tap is definitely the way to go for this beer. The lack of CO2 lets the subtle flavors come out and make for a tasty, almost cask-like experience. The aroma is a mellow mix of caramel and toffee grains. The flavor expands on these with a hint of herbal hops and biscuit flavors. I was kind of expecting a bland macro take on the EPA, but this was a tasty beer."
"Got it on draught at Carson's American Bistro in Ann Arbor, MI. Poured a dark, hazy copper and had a nice aroma of hops. It felt medium-bodied in the mouth and the hops were pretty apparent in the taste, but not overwhelming. This is a very drinkable pale. It's very flavorful without being too strong to have a few."
"Not on my faves list, but not a bad brew either."
"my first beer for st. patty's day ; pours a clear med. gold color w/ a decent white head which sticks around for a bit leaving moderate lacing in my nonic ; not a strong smell, a sweet, mildly toasted malt aroma w/ some floral hop, some mild diacetyl type yeast and alcoholic undertones present ; a dry, crisp malty flavor, a bit nutty and cracker-like, but well balanced w/ the hop bitterness, a very faint dark fruit present as well ; a good light-med body, yet drier than the taste & aroma let on, i was expecting something a bit sweeter, the co2 was good, helping support that head and all ; a very drinkable brew, i may have to add this one to my ""sessionable"" list for sure..."
"D: this is the first draft beer I have had, and its pretty decent. I could see this being a draft staple"
"D: Not a particularly pleasant brew and one that I would pass over for many, many others. But in a pinch it could quench a thirst."
"You can easily do much, much worse."
"Most days, I'm an APA guy, but every once and a while I like to have an English Pale Ale, and usually this is the one available. The beer arrived with a basic pale amber body and a small white head. It had a prominent buttery malt flavor with a good amount of complex hop flavor for a mass produced beer. This is a pretty good jumping off point when you're exploring pale ales."
"Had this on tap and it does make a difference. A apple juice-like color on top of a hoppy, apple-like smelling brew (must have had apples on the brain). In other words, a very light alcohol aroma. Gives a nice head that leaves lacing and is complemented by a mediumish grain body that fills the mouth and goes down very smooth. Not much in the taste department, but one of those beers where you and a buddy split a pitcher and you know you're drinking generic stuff, but you don't care. A nice session beer that you can relax with if you're at a bar."
"D- A great choice when having a few, and nicely paired with most meals. I really enjoy it, and will continue to drink it. If I recall correctly, Bass on draught was much different. Less carbonated, and it was served a bit warmer. In this case I prefer it chilled and out of a bottle."
"Drinkability - good drinkability, good with fish and chips."
"I found the unique feature of this brew to be in the taste; there is an interesting sweetness in the malt but the finish tends to be dry. There also seems to be something interesting in the bittering, like there is something more, or perhaps different, than just hops."
"D--This is a very drinkable beer. Great session beer. I can think of alot of things I would rather have but that cannot detract from the fact this is a great example of the style and overall a very palatable beer."
"D: Not bad. I've had this by the sixer before. It seems a little bitter tonight, but add a snack and this beer's drinkablity is pretty nice."
"D - I'd say pretty good. Maybe I should score this higher. It's definitely sessionable, but if you like apple juice, stay away from this one, you'll be divorced and living on the streets in no time. For everyone else, recommended!"
"Pours a brilliant amberish caramel orange color with creamy off white head. Has a very mild smell of maltiness and caramel. Taste is very smooth, a bit malty, with a creaminess. Great mouthfeel, somewhat lightly flavored, and is very drinkable. Quite good, with a subtle overall taste and aftertaste. A great overall beer."
"Not bad for certain, yet still middle-of-the-road."
"D - This is a very drinkable beer. Nothing too overpowering to prevent consuming several of these at one sitting."
"Notes: Nothing too special, but really sessionable. I usually stock this as one of my regular, everyday fridge beers."
"Was served to me in a pint (American pint, not British unfortunatly) glass. Waaay too cold for the style, so I slowly sipped on it until it had a chance to warm up a bit. Has a clear amber color, with no head. Smells of English malt. Taste is pretty good, a sweet and also biscuity flavor with a bit of butter too. There wasnt much hop aroma or flavor, but the bitterness levels were good. Mouthfeel is slightly thin for the style, and the carbonation levels were way too high (compared to drinking this style of beer from the cask). However, I did stir the beer up a bit and this brought carbonation down to much better levels. Pretty drinkable after doing so. My grandpa used to serve Bass gravity dispensed from the cask in the late 1940's and while I suspect the beer was much better back then, it's still worth a drink now in its current state."
"drinkability: very easy to drink, a slow drinking beer. definatley smoother as it comes to about 50-60 degrees"
"d: pretty easy"
"Pours a nice amber/brown color from the bottle with a nice white head with tints of tan in it. It smells of sweet malts mostly. The rest was a caramel fruity aroma. The taste was good as it delivered what it smelled like. It was really malty with a kind of caramel taste at the end. It had a good mouthfeel and it was very drinkable. I could have had a few of these. It's not bad and it's worth a try."
"D - It goes down quick and smooth. Probably one that could be consumed in mass quantities."
"It's alright; I bought this just to rate it. I get it if it's on tap at a sub-par bar or the best thing at the gas station, but I've certainly had better."
"D = This is an okay standby beer and I regularly drink it when not many craft (or other interesting) beers are available. Not the one I would choose if I had several English pale ales to choose from though."
"This is one of my pub staples. Not my favorite, but a well balanced and flavorful beer that I would recommend."
"standard."
"Easy drinking. That's probably why it's had such success here in the States."
"The 5.0 ABV and light taste make this highly drinkable. If you have not tried this one, please do. The price at $6.99 a six-pack is not bad for an English ale, even though it is mass produced."
"Overall: Despite the bitter flavour I sincerely did not like this one. There is something there that did not feel right. Perhaps I was unlucky with the bottle, but Bass did not impress me at all."
"Pours a clean orange-ish/ copper with an off white head. In the aroma, sweet gingerbread malt. In the taste, a watery sweet malt. A small bite in the mouthfeel, with a small dry fruitiness (apricot) in the aftertaste. A small fruit presence and a small hop presence, kind of the standard pale. Very non offensive."
"Had this on draft at Friday's... The appearance was about average for an ale like this... nothing to write home about, but decent... Not much going on with the aroma - somewhat bland and not too appealing... The taste was pretty good, I've tried better ales out there, and I've sampled worse, but all in all a good beer to try and goes well with appetizers... A little bitter to my liking, but still drinkable... Being one of the more popular imported English brews, I can't say I was totally impressed, but I wasn't dissapointed either... Definitely not worth buying a sixer but a good choice on tap during happy hour for a $2.00 pint..."
"There's not enough depth to make Bass a true go-to beer. In a pinch, I'd say go forward without hesitation. But, it's nothing really special, other than being a solid ""do everything beer"" with better taste. Look elsewhere for a variation, but this is honestly the cornerstone of English Pale Ales."
"Could have drank several more of these, went down way too easy and the alcohol percentage is low, almost a light beer as far as filling you up goes, recommended if you are at a bar like I was with nothing but Bud or Coors Light"
"Pours a dark clear amber color with a thin lace of head and high amount of carbonation. Has malty fruit and somewhat sweet aromas. Taste is strong with malty flavors. Mouthfeel is high carbonated, but goes down smooth with a slightly bitter aftertaste. This is a pretty good session beer."
"Pours a nice amber color, although not very deep. Great head, though. Has a nice hoppy scent, but not very deep. Nice hoppy taste and aftertaste, but like it's scent, it's just not very strong. Goes down fine. Above average, but not the best. Still, it's worth a try and it's easy to find."
"D- A good session beer available all over the place -- not a spectacular choice, but it works well in many situations."
"It could be a poor batch that I am rating this on, because I don't remember my first Bass tasting like this one, but it has a rather skunky odor to it. Almost as though it were made with actual bass, as crazy as that sounds. But the taste was fine. Mild malts and hops, very dark brown color, and a bitter finish. I don't drink Bass often, but I do pick it up on occasion to make some kick-ass Black & Tans. Overall, it's what you'd expect of a pale ale, nothing spectacular, but nothing disappointing either."
"I don't know what happened tonight but I feel like I have rediscovered this beer. It poured a nice brown amberish color, and tasted pretty damn good. I have recently quit smoking and seemed to have gained a new taste for beer, I would definately have to say this is now one of my favorite pale ales."
"A very British treat! Pours a sparkling red-blonde... lots of little bubbles, and a thick, cidery head. Cidery is what really describes this beer. As you drink, the carbonation sparkles all over your tongue as your mouth is awash with appley and malty flavors. There's a bit of a woody finish to it, and then a long lingering apple cidery after. A very relaxing warmer on a chilly fall evening."
"Review added 10-30-2007, translated from french 1-21-2008."
"Being one of my first non macro brews there will always be a special place in my heart for bass, or underneath my Guiness."
"Drinkability: Classic taste, one of my long time favorites. Very consistent."
"It is a very solid all-around beer. Nothing amazing, but everything done well."
"I remember drinking a lot of this and enjoying it five or six years ago, before I really got into craft beer. I had a pint of this at some restaurant (don't remember which one) in New Jersey, and was disappointed with how badly it fared compared to what else is out there. Nothing distinctly wrong with it, although there was a mild cooked corn note to the aroma, and I found the carbonation to be high for an English Pale. But... meh."
"Came to me in an american pint glass amber color with little head that eaves some lacing. Theres some smell of hops not much. The taste is great a little bitter but not in a bad way. Mouthfeel is very good light carbonation makes it very smooth. This is one of my favorite beers I could drink it all night long."
"D: A little tasty, goes down easy, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, there are other English Pale Ales that I would pick first, but if my choices were this or a macro, I would take this beer."
"Bass is normally one of my favorite drinks, but the metallic flavoring was an unwelcome surprise. Definitely allow it to warm a bit before drinking or just have it on tap."
"Nice copper color with no head or lacing. Poured into my favorite snifter so I could get a whiff. I can tell Bass any day. Taste is medium strength for this type of ale. Pleasant. Once again, mouthfeel is not too thin but definitely not all that heavy. Drinkability is fine for me, had quite a few of these in college so all I can say is - typical Bass. Good go-to when everyone else is drinking BMC products. Most places have it."
"All in all this is a full flavored beer that is actually quite enjoyable,best to let it warm a little than all the flavors and aroma comes at you a little stronger,,,,quite tasty..worth a try."
"This is drinkable. Didn't care for the smell that much but this is a crisp and refreshing ale."
"D - A classic version of an EPA; something that you can drink very easily. This is a good beer for the beginner beer geek."
"This beer just has a good taste to it. It's nothing particularly fancy, but it just has a good taste. Malt dominates, with the taste of alcohol, but the aftertaste turns sweet, almost fruity, like a hint of cherry? Maybe it's the red tint in the brew that makes me think cherry. Not much hops evident to my taste. Very smooth and very drinkable."
"D: Average. It is a novel and fad for those visiting British style pubs. Made me miss my St. Arnolds brews, though."
"Bass Pale Ale pours a clear copper with thin head that doesn't linger. Its aroma is a light fruity maltiness, I smell a hint of berries, maybe strawberries. The aroma finishes with hints of toffee and a bit of bitter hops. The flavor is crisp, almost tart. There is less maltiness in the taste, but some sweetness sticks through with light, metallic bitterness. I think the beer is a little thin over all, but it's fairly solid, good in a pinch when there are few other options."
"If I was going to make a black and tan, I could think of about a dozen better ""tan"" portions than this."
"Pours a dark ruby red color with a white bubbly head that comes to the top and then fades away slightly. Smell is of caramel malt, along with some grain smells. The taste of this one is the grain and some of the malt and very little of the hops come through. Mouth feeling is bubbly and not too filling. A nice beer."
"DA: It starts out o.k, but very quickly goes down hill fast."
"As recently as two years ago, Bass was one of my go-to brews. My wife remains fond of it, so it pops up in my fridge with some frequency, but I've moved this one onto my stay-away-from list."
"this used to be an old standard of mine in pre-craft days, when i felt like putting down the cash for import prices. unexceptionality aside, it's still reliable enough, especially if a bar has nothing else but american macro piss. its main feature is a pure and simple drinkability, accentuated by that great finish/aftertaste."
"This is by far one of the better beers I've had in my time. It pours out with a nice healthy head and a rich glow. The smell is not perfect but definitely intruiging, and the taste - it goes down extremely easy, begging you to take another sip. The mouthfeel is pure - it tastes good and can't steer you wrong. I'd recommend this beer to anyone and always keep it stocked in the fridge."
"Pours more of an copper amber color with a head that's thin. Aroma is of malt and hops. Mildly hoppy, which I like. Taste is more on the malt side but it seems to fall thin towards the back of the throat. The hops don't show as much. Somewhat fruity. Nothing impressive but still somewhat above a typical macro."
"Had this on tap and took notes..just getting to putting them down. This was one of my first imported pale's. Pours a dark golden with a fluffy head that goes down quicly leaving very little lacing. The taste has a little bite up front and then moves to some malts and finishes smooth. Mouthfeel is balanced with the carbonation and works well. This is one of my go to choices at most chain restaraunts when I can't get something more sophisticated."
"Drinkability- A good relaxing beer to enjoy with a meal or just to sip off of."
"D: Drinkable - even sessionable, but as I said before, it's nothing special. It was the best option last night when confronted with a bar full of macros, and I was happy to find it, but next time I'll find a better bar."
"Pale amber with head that it didnt retain for long. Not bad, but much better pale ales out there. Doesnt seem to have a consistent taste on draft. Have had it when it seemed much better than other times. One of the first imports you could find everywhere. The taste seems a bit metallic, but has a sweet character to it. Decent session brew."
"D- mildly flavorful, goes down easy when poured properly, a great pale ale for all seasons."
"at dinner tonight at one of the usual chain restaurants. what's on tap, nah, nah, nah, maybe, nah, guinness and bass. I've done the guinness a lot so why not bass? 608 reviews as of this writing. SO, classic old faithful. Cherished, forgotten and overlooked many times. Yet still ready for the next time. Yeah I gotta order this on tap again in the future. Worth a visit."
"Taste also followed the lines of the nose, with a touch of malt, virtually no hops standing out and the mouthfeel was very thin but normal for a beer of this type."
"Drinkability: I remember this beer from y college days and I have to believe either the beer has changed or my palate has. Its a decent beer, very drinkable but overall very average. Its like a macro English Pale Ale. Nothing more nothing less."
"Just OK, nothing to brag about."
"Drinkability- If you can find this stuff on tap, drink it. If not, the nitro-can version is also quite nice."
"Light honey/caramel, orange-yellow color. Head is very dense, very thick, and keeps going until the end of the beer. Smell is a nice blend of sweet and hop-sharp with the hops edging out by a bit. taste was a bit mild-mannered. Some creamy sweetness that moves more towards hop toward the end. Malt flavors were mild and the hops stepped out a bit more. Bordering on thin and low carbonation. I'll give the drinkability just over average, because it's not unpleasant, nor bad, just not awesome."
"drinkability is good, because this is a light-bodied beer without much richness in any department. that being said, it would be quite refreshing on a hot day."
"Not the most refreshing beer. Sharp bitterness makes it hard to drink."
"D - This is a very good pale ale. Good flavor."
"This lives up to the unfortunate stereotype of all things English, in that it's bland as hell. In every way. Copper color, head is ehhh. Smell is, wait a minute, what smell? What little trace there is of an aroma is similar to Perrier. Flavor starts out ok, sweet caramel malt. It takes an unfortunate turn about 2/3 of the way in and begins to taste a bit like an ashtray. As far as the mouthfeel, I feel like I just sucked on a penny. A sticky penny. I need to find some decent English beers."
"This is a very drinkable beer. It could be an everyday beer and I would dare say a lawnmower beer ( that's a good thing ) except for one thing: the extremely high price that is out of whack for such an ordinary beer. It is what it is: a true to style English pale ale that's a nice but expensive session beer."
"The taste stores a bit of a bitter surprise, almost like an ESB, with a medicinally hoppy bite mixed with notes of wheat and biscuit. It's a bit like drinking some orange juice too soon after brushing one's teeth. Mouthfeel is juicy with a medium body and below-average carbonation. This isn't a great pale ale by any means, but it's a decent attempt from the boys across the pond. I won't be buying any anytime soon, but I'd never turn one down."
"Drinkability: Eminently drinkable. The balance between the hops and the malt makes it very pleasant to drink. This would be a great introductory beer to someone who's ready to move on from the mass market yellow fizzy stuff."
"D: This beer is highly drinkable. A fact that I have tested vigorously."
"Bass Ale, the classic english pale ale pours a nice clear copper color with a white head that leaves a thin layer of bubbles with some lace. The smell is subdued but I do get lots of buttery diacetyl along with some toasted malt and faint earthy hops. The taste of this can be attributed to the famous brewing water, slightly salty very mineraly and even a bit metallic along with a fair amount of butterscotch, toasted and caramel malts and some earthy, very British, hop flavor and associated bitterness. The mouthfeel is decent nothing overly exciting. I've got a special place in my heart for this beer. In college the only package store within walking distance of campus had a very poor beer selection with a lot of cheep macro lagers to appeal to the general college community. So I found myself drinking a lot of Bass and Sam Adams. This may not be the best pale ale ever made, but it is a pretty good one."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Light bodied and pretty smooth. Carbonation is about right for this beer. It's drinkability is decent. Definitely not a regular for me though. Overall, it's alright and worth trying. It pales in comparison to some American pale ales though. Pardon the pun...."
"Once it warmed up a bit I did enjoy this beer (particularly the sweet nose) right up to the finish, which left me frustrated that a beer that easy, soft & pleasant could just finish so brashly. It was not by any means bad, but it certainly wasn't very good either. Its a good, easy to drink example of the genre that leaves rough & bitter. I'd drink it again, but wouldn't be opposed to trying something else if giving a choice."
"Drinkability- One of the most drinkable beers Ive ever had."
"This is a good beer and one I'd recommend to anyone wanting to try an English Pale Ale. When I run out of Abbot and there's none to buy, this is my ole stand-by. This is one beer that I drink all evening and into the night. I love drinking this while playing video games. The larger bottle I bought makes it easier to play games, since you're not constantly getting up to grab another bottle. Great beer."
"D- I usually drink these whist hanging out with all my mates at the pub, so I believe that explains the amount a person can drink of these."
"Finish is semi short with a mild lingering sweetness."
"D- pretty drinkable. Not my first choice at a bar (my friend ordered it) but still not the last time I will have it."
"Good and enjoyable, if not outstanding. Color is a dark amber with a hint of red, not much head. Aroma is weak but inviting. Flavor is decidedly malty, very smooth without any bitter aftertaste. This beer is better on tap than from a bottle, but I suspect most ales are that way."
"Overall this is pretty average, maybe slightly below average. The last time I tried this until today, was in London back in 2002, and it didn't thrill me then either. I think I'll stick to St. Pete's."
"My first taste impression was that i didnt liek this particular ale, however as i finished the glass, i liked it alot more. its got a sweet tast, with a bit of hoppy bittermess. it almost seemed tingly, im not sure if it had to do wqith carbonation or something else. the mouth feel was average, if not just above seemed a bit watery for my taste, and lacking of that ""it"" factor that we all know we want but cant explain. It is a highly drinkable beer, smooth enough, and low enough in alcohol to enjoy a few of. a good solid beer, a good choice, and a more common beer thats actually worth getting."
"Not bad at all, it's what I think of when English pale ale is mentioned. It's far from perfect, and I'm sure InBev's presence in the Bass brewhouse has done it no favors, but it's a fine session beer, not too challenging and no off flavors. Perfect for your friend who doesn't like hoppy or dark beers."
"12 oz bottle into a mug. Nice amber color, no real lacing, a fairly low head that disappears pretty quickly. Looks like your average beer. Nose is fairly mild, mostly malt, a little of that standard sweet macro-lager smell to it. Taste is overwhelmingly malty, very sweet caramel and toffee, just a very mild hint of hops at the end. Feel is standard macro feel, medium-thin bodied, solid to a little high carbonation. Overall, it's a pretty solid beer, although I'm not sure if it's worth the price hike over the standard macro lagers. It's one that I could drink a few of, mostly because it's pretty thin and unoffensive. Not bad, but not great either."
"Drinkability: Overall, not much going on here. Not water, but not really impressive in the flavor department. This is the kind of thing to drink at a bar that doesn't serve craft beer."
"Towards the end it seemed more watery and the aftertaste became the flavour. Good beer, just not my favourite."
"Bass Pale Ale was amber in color and very clear. It has a medium sized off-white head that soon became a thin layer with some lacing left behind. The aroma was sweet caramel malt with some english hops in the backround. The taste was caramel malt and hops with a nice bitterness and dry finish. It was medium-light in body and carbonation. Drinkability was average. It's a decent English pale ale, but nothing to go out of your was for."
"D- Very easy drinker and a decent session beer."
"All told, a fairly solid choice."
"I would much rather have a Fullers ESB or a Youngs Bitter than Bass, but it is a pretty good go-to beer out here on my personal beer desert island. As least it's available!"
"There were three ""cask"" taps available, two of which were Boddingtons (there were also some nitro taps). If I had not seen the Bass poured I would have sworn I'd got a pint of some ""cream flow"" Boddington like pint. Not impressive and something that gives cask real ale a bad name."
"pours nice rich clear amber color with a off white two finger head that held fairly well with some good lacing. smell fruity, with some caramel aromas. taste is sweet caramel, toasted malt, and sweet fruits. mouthfeel light, moderate carbonation, with a lightly slick feel on the tongue. easy drinker, good session beer."
"drinkability - Nice beer on tap, never tried it in a bottle. A few times on tap though."
"I think something has happened to this brewery to be honest. Have seen posts in the forums before discussing the downward spiral..."
"smells very good, hops first then a more malty presence,maybe even a slight chocolately maltness in it. tastes great also, i let it sit on my mouth and the alcohol warms the tongue, has a unique aftertaste. drinkability is exceptional, would love to have these all day long, if it weren't for school/work."
"The taste is not that enjoyable to me. It's a bit sour, a bit too malty up front, and has too much carbonation for my liking. This goes along with the watery taste I just couldn't shake. Mouthfeel is decent, and it's drinkable, but I wouldn't want more than one anyway. You can find it everywhere, but frankly there are other beer just as accessible that are better than this one."
"12 oz bottle poured a nice dark copper-amber color with little head and some lacing that sticks to the glass. Smell of slightly roasted malts and some hop bitterness. Some roasted malt at first followed by a good slug of bitterhop and a touch of sweetness. Goes down easily enough but I'm not sure it's worth the $13.25cdn per sixer though."
"Nothing surprising in the flavor. A decent pale ale, but nothing to write home about. Nice full carbonation in the mouthfeel."
"I could see the practical element to having it in a can in Penn Station and I would happily buy this again...in a can."
"Poured clear amber with a fine-grained white head that dropped to a half-inch and stayed. Medium lacing. Smell is very faint; biscuity malt and a hint of hops. Taste is crisp and clean, light for a pale ale (especialy compared to some of the American micro PAs on the market today) not a lot of hops, but the chalky quality of the Burton-On-Trent water is very noticable and -- to my palate anyway -- round and pleasing."
"This, IMO, seems like the bud light of pale ales. Poured into a pint glass, from a 12oz. bottle. The beer poured a deep amber, forming a 1/2 inch head, that quickly faded, leaving medium lacing on the glass. The aroma is weak, but what is detectable, is a nice citrus aroma. The taste is very light, having little hop flavor, and an equal amount of malts. Does not have the hoppy flavor that I expect from a pale ale. The mouthfeel is also a little thin. Overall, its not a bad beer, just not the one that I would turn to, when I want an English Pale Ale. However, I do love this with Guinness in a black & tan."
"I wasn't impressed with this beer at all. To be blunt, apple sourness is what dominated my palatte the whole time. Had a hard time even finishing the pint. Next time I go to an Irish Pub, I won't be ordering this again."
"Three down, and three to go. Next up, Guinness Draught."
"Thin, watery, and slightly syrupy mouthfeel, but good carbonation. Drinkability is decent and this is a decent session beer, though last night after three pints I had to switch to Smithwick's."
"Bass might have a better brew but the Pale Ale is not one of them."
"D - Easy to drink. I would have this one again."
"Poured a clear orange color with a huge fizzy head and laced quite a bit. Picked up very little on the nose of this one, maybe some malts? Taste was a bit fruitier then I remebered, tasted fresh. Very carbonated.Overall this is decent, not a favorite but decent."
"One of my favorites of the more readily available pale ales, this one pours a nice copper, with a good light head. A bit of a grassy scent and malt. A distinctly bready flavor that finishes a bit bitter clean finish. It's smooth and easy to drink, and is often followed by another one!"
"pours amber with little head retention. for some reason i don't smell a thing when this beer is poured. the taste is slightly buttery with hints of caramel but the texture is slightly thin. very drinkable though.not as much flavor as i would have hoped for but all in all pretty good. as an irish american, my praise can somewhat be light for a british beer but i have to give them their due, good job with the bass."
"The taste was dominated by buttery, caramel malt, followed by an abrupt metallic twang. It felt thin and watery on the palate and overall didn't make much of a lasting impression."
"Overall, slightly above average and worth the $2/pint special price."
"Poured a clear golden rust color, 1 finger head that left some lacing, head dissipated quickly. The smell was of caramel malts, the taste was the same with a slight metalic hop bitterness. Nice carbonation, with a slightly watery mouthfeel, finishes dry but not bitter. This ale goes down easy and I could drink many of these. I actually bought these as an offset to some heavier beers. So far 2 out of the 5 in the 6'r were dead flat. Lets hope the other is not flat."
"D: The flavor is decent enough to go for more, as nothing truly stands out in this beer. Still, better than many other widely available selections, so it'd bed easier and tastier than others."
"24 ounce tall-boy. Lightly amberish-red in color, a dissapointing white head. Butery hops, some caramel toffee notes and tender malts noticed on the nose. Medium bodied with the true to quality offerings found in the style--bitter and creamy hops, combined with a light caramel malt backbone. Fails to develop the creaminess that would be expected with an EPA. Simple enough, but that may be the issue here. Better offerings can be found."
"Poured 12 oz bottle into a glass mug. A light amber color with a thick white head that has decent retention. Nice, malty smell typical of an EPA. Backed up with a malty taste yet there was a slight bitterness as well. Nice mouthfeel typical of an EPA. Rather drinkable ber although the bitterness would wind up gettign to me after a few. But, overall rather enjoyable and comforting."
"This is a straight forward, easy-drinking beer that could be quite sessionable were it not for the intense dryness. Definitely a good default beer when not at a beer bar."
"Poured from a ""Bass Pub Pour"" can into a pint glass. Pours a copperish amber color with a thin white head. Aroma is extremely faint malt and just a touch of caramel. Taste begins malty with not much going on in the middle. Finally the bitterness from the hops sneak in at the end with a metallic twang in there as well. Overall, this just is not a very good beer in a can and is not exactly going to make my grocery list anytime soon."
"Pours a clear golden color with a thin head of off white bubbles. Aroma is light, but somewhat roasty and earthy hops. Taste brings out the earthy hops and light malt backbone. Light bitter aftertaste. Easy drinking, nothing crazy. Solid session beer, nothing more."
"Overall an easy drinking English Pale Ale. Pretty decent brew."
"Much sweeter than I expected. Had a one-inch head that dissapated quickly. Was drinkable, but not great. Fairly one-dimentional. Smell was a bit stale and yeasty, but it tasted better. Could taste a woody, almost oak-like flavor, as well as some fruit and sugar. One that I would have again, but certainly not a favorite."
"B'ham UK"
"Pours a medium copper with a rocky yet frothy head and raised lacing patterns. Head peters out all too soon. There are some aromas characteristic of English pales like the toasty malt, noble hops and slight diacetyl, but this is cut short by a sharp metallic twinge. Starts off real nice in the flavor catagory with pleasant malt, hop, and diacetyl flavors all rushing into my mouth, but then comes this awful yeast flavor that reminds me of a mix of not-yet-ready homebrew and baker's yeast. All other positive flavors seem to wash out quickly, yet the yeast still remains. Oh, and there was that metallic thing in the finish as well. Starts out nice, then gets really gross. Amount of carbonation in this is just fine by me. Nice and mellow, just how I like my English pales. However, the body is too thin and watery. The weird astringent yeast character and watery body just don't add up to a good drinker. With all the pales out there that are cheaper and taste a whole hell of a lot better, there's no reason for me to ever buy this ever again."
"Overall I thought this beer was pretty average. The color was amber with a small head. The aroma was almost nonexistent with only a faint smell of hops. Taste was full bodied but there was a slightly sour after taste that I could hardly bear (might have been a bad keg). The mouthfeel was pretty good the carbonation was spot on. Drinkability was pretty good with the exception of the after taste. I'm going to give this one another try."
"This pale ale is an easy to get down sessionable ale. Not very complex. I detected some caramel malts and brown sugar. Very balanced. Easy to drink and quaffable. Very crisp, very refreshing. No frills pale ale. give it a try if nothing else is readily available."
"I wonderful brew I just hope I can get it on draft next time! Very nicely done Bass Brewers Ltd.!!"
"I find this ale to be an excellent representation of the style. The color is brilliant amber and flavor is mildy fruity. I enjoy the label design with the England's first trademark displayed prominently. It has hints of hops and is sufficently carbonated and highly quaffable."
"This Beer pours to light amber with little to no head with a slightly hoppy smell with a hint of malt. This was a fairly average beer with an almost watery taste with a light hops character. It was very smooth and the mouthfeel was light. I could drink this instead of water its simply that smooth. This went well with my steak dinner."
"Drank pretty easy, this beer can be hit or miss, not sure if that has to with how fast it turns over, When it's on it's great, even better on cask. That was a few years ago, sigh"
"About what I expected. Not a horrible beer but there is no complexity to speak of. Pretty much your average mass produced beer that is produced for the masses."
"Poured a light golden color with massive white puffy head. Modest lacing. Light fruity smell, but nothing overly impressive. Taste is moderately malty, but nothing overly impressive. Finish is also very mild and unimpressive. An eay to drink beer, but nothing out of the ordinary."
"This is just an average euro pale ale. It's not bad, but theres better. It has a descent flavor, nothignt oo harsh, better drank cold. Appearence is dark smells is bitter sweet. mouthfeel is fair, again not weak. I would class this as a mid grade pale ale."
"Have I had better beer? Sure. Have I had my times when I don't like this at all? Sure. But I keep coming back, so they must be doing something right!"
"D- If you can get this on tap instead of bottle, you are better off. Both are good and will depend on what you prefer. A very fine brew. Not wild by any means but a standard bearer for the style. On the taste scale, it may seem muted compared to an American Pale Ale but a good sessionable beer none the less."
"Pours a nice reddish-amber color with a thick and foamy head that sticks around for a while. Some decent malt and breadyness in the nose. Has a nice malt and caramel flavor, together with some hops. Aftertaste has a bit of more bitterness, but not much. Has a pretty smooth mouthfeel, and a crisp finish with some lingering hops. A good beer with no real faults, goes down nicely. When you're raced with few choices at a abr, this is a good friend to turn to."
"Poured a hazy dark red amber, with a slight off-white head and slight lacing. Smell was good, sweet malts, caramel and butterscotch. Caramel is once again present in the taste as are spicy/bitter hops, and a faint fruit character. The aftertaste lingers somewhat, but is pleasant-enough with a balance between the sweet and bitter characteristics of the brew. The beer has a creamy mouthfeel up front, is medium bodied, well carbonated, and ends somewhat dry. Overall i think this a fine session beer, decent on all counts, not really spectacular, but very drinkable."
"golden amber body with a dense light beige head that leaves decent amounts of lacing. Hint of nut in the nose along with some lightly roasted malt and sweet fruit. First taste is of sweet caramel malt followed by floral hop with low bitterness and some nut that leaves my mouth feeling dry. Creamy medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Easy drinker, could put down a few of these with no problem."
"Get my buzz on- Y"
"This beer poured a golden color with a small head. The smell was sweet and slightly sour. The taste is bright with notes of citrus and bitterness. The mouthfeel is full but not heavy. There is a slight bitter aftertaste. Drinkability  hey, its a Bass!"
"Poured into a standard pint tumbler. Very nice sized head, at least two fingers. It took it's time to recede. Maintained a good lace. Smell wasn't very strong, but I could make out some sweetness. Taste is a little on the malty side, but there was a slight bit of hops bitterness. The malt was a bit smokey. Mouthfeel was medium bodied. I think I overlook Bass sometimes. It was great with pizza. I should give it a chance more often."
"Bass has a malty, sweet flavor. It's very easy to drink. Nice amber color, not much foam. It gives off a pleasant, nutty smell. Hop character is very slight. Overall, bass pale ale is a decent beer, sweet and refreshing. It differs a lot from an American pale ale in the fact that there's hardly any hops. It's good when your'e craving something less bitter than usual."
"This is the Inbev version, I have to find my notes of some years ago for the original one."
"Much sharper around the edges than most pale's. Superb balance of sweetness and kick while magically eliminating a strong aftertaste. Love the accessability of this beer and its' no more than Guinnes or Heineken at you local grocer. A beer with more diversity than most of the other mass produced imports when it comes to food."
"Smell is a bit roasty and smokey of malt. Not much hop aroma, and not too complex. Taste is a bit nutty and sweet. A little dry and roasty, with a clean, sort of sweet aftertaste. Not a whole lot of interesting stuff going on here, but its tasty and drinable. Mouthfeel is on the thinner side, and light carbonation helps it go down easy. Not a bad choice if youre limited to macros."
"I am pleasantly surprised with this old, standby on tap. Much smoother than the bottle and more flavorful as well..."
"The taste is interesting, but unintrusive enough to drink just for fun...for those times when picking out every little subtle flavor is not the main idea. Overall this is just a pretty average beer for drinking....without much thinking."
"A solid beer, and a decent example of the style."
"Major smell and taste is hop bitterness. Much less complex smell and taste that hoppy American IPAs. Also has a thinner mouth feel than American IPAs."
"Overall, a simple quaffing English Pale Ale."
"Eric"
" Taste is light and crisp and pleasant if fairly simple and a little watery. No real hop attack as in most pale ales but this is basic, tasty stuff. Sessionable in a pinch but I likely wouldn't choose it unless confronted only by other macros"
"Bass Ale could easily pass for a weak amber lager. While this could be a refreshing summer ale, it lacks the basic qualities one should expect from a pale ale."
"This is a staple at most pubs English, Irish, and American alike, and for good reason. It lacks big beer taste that is found in many other English ales, but considering the fact that it is such a mass produced, macrobrewed beer it's still pretty damn good. Pours a copperish amber with med head and light lacing. Smell is light crisp hops and very mild graininess. Taste is lightly hopped with a miniscule touch of caramel. Mouthfeel is minimal but just shy of watery. Bass is an extremely drinkable beer and you'll find yourself finishing a pint or pitcher faster than you thought every time you drink it. If only American macros could emulate Bass."
"Ive always liked Bass Ale, especially for a mass-produced, widely-distributred beer. Not as good as some of the truly great ales, but a damn good one given the price. When eating or drinking out, where micro and crafts are not available, this is one beer Ill readily drink; a hell of a step above most American or Import Macros."
"Final Statement: This beer is a real classic, if you can get a fresh sample, enjoy."
"Yet another English pale ale that hasn't impressed me. I don't know if it's the nitro-can or what, but it's just very... boring. At least there is a slight bit of complexity to the flavor, even if it's very mild. Quite popular, but I can't quite see why. Worth trying to satisfy your curiosity, but not one I really plan on getting again."
"Notes- overall this is a thoroughly decent if basic beer. It is a classic and certainly better than any of the big domestic macros. I would certainly drink this again."
"Not impressed at all."
"Pours a nice amber color. Both the lacing and the head didn't last very long. There were hints of caramel in the nose but overall there wasn't too much there. As for the taste it started with hops and a mild amount of bitterness and finished very clean. Good mouthfeel with a moderate amount of carbonation. An easily drinkable beer that I would certainly have again."
"This beer pours a clear amber with a creamy white head that holds decently without any lacing. The smell is malty with aromas of caramel and amber malts. The taste is an echo of the smell, all malts, not much hops. The mouthfeel is nicely thick with even carbonation. Overall, its a nice session beer and one that wouldn't be bad to fall back on."
"I've never been a big fan of English ales and this one is not leading me down the right path. Although low in alcohol I really wouldn't enjoy more than one of these."
"Odd handbell shaped bottle, 1 pt., 3.25 oz. Pours faded copper with a semi-sticky manilla head. Aromas are fairly floral, but the hop presence is quite subdued. Some biscuity malts appear as well. Faint floral and spicy hop flavor with light, toasted bread malts. Mouthfeel is far too thin, indeed it's rather watery. I used to really adore this beer years ago. In fact the friend who gave me this bottle did so because he remembered me being such a big fan. Knowing how many great beers in general, and pale ales specifically there are out there, I can't ever see myself choosing this unless there were no other better options available."
"D - Good."
"Drinkability: I like to make this a session beer everyone once in a while. For it's extreme availability, this is one that I think is usually worth the price, as far as six packs go at least; it may get a bit expensive at pubs and on tap and whatnot. Not too much alcohol, a flavorful brew, and easy to drink."
"Fairly smooth, and drinkable. A Simple brew, one I would have again if offered."
"I've turned to more of an American IPA fan, but this always works for me in a pinch at a restaurant or when I need a reasonably priced 12 pk."
"Poured from draft into pint glass. Detected a lot more fruit and citrus. A little better than before. Light yet flavorful. Ratings upgraded."
"Medium bodied and lightly carbonated best describes this beer's mouthfeel. Doesn't finish dry, and seems like it would make a nice session beer. Feels good in the mouth, almost creamy-a reflection of the head, and carbonation isn't in the way. This is a good beer, would make a great session, but I prefer APAs as opposed to the English version. I can see myself buying this in the future but not that often, perhaps only to make black and tans. Goes down easy, but just doesn't hit the spot like a good APA. I know this is a different style but that's just what I prefer."
"Good color, not cloudy. Average head. Smells like beer should smell."
"Body is still quite thin, but the micro bubbles of nitro carbonation give it a slick, creamy mouthfeel"
"Great Burton ale - mass-market but retaining its outstanding quality and great taste. Aroma is fruity-hoppy, color is pale gold, carbonation rather high, helping to form an accurate crown. Taste is gentle and complex with some grain, caramelized malts and delightful hops. This beer can be your thirst-quencher or a long drink - everything you want it to be. Just don't serve it too cold!"
"D - Nothing out of this world but reliable to session. The sweetness can be a little too much sometimes but good overall"
"I'm really glad this experience was what I remember of Bass. My last serving was from the tap and was not as pleasant. This classic English Pale has really defined the style world-wide due to the brewery longevity and it's good distribution. Perhaps not ""the"" best English pale, but the standard by which all are measured."
"Cheers."
"Tastes just like the aromas, with a fine balance between hoppy bitterness and malty sweetness. There's a metallic finish that I don't like (and decided to dock a half-point for), but there's also a good bit of depth displayed via floral and elemental tones. With a bold but tame mouthfeel, and the depth of flavor, it's a good thing this beer is as widely available as it is, proving once again that nobody, NOBODY needs to just settle and have a Bud or MGD or some such thing."
"An all-around yummy beer. Makes a great session drink. I've only had it on-tap once that I can recall--pints and pints with bangers and mash at Epcot Center in Orlando--but based on my limited experience I would say that it is one of those beers where the bottled version doesn't do it justice."
"I just can't help but think back on what this beer was 20 years ago. It's almost heartbreaking to see what it has become. This is English A/B or Miller, now. Sad, sad, sad. Avoid it if you're looking for anything with character."
"D- goes down really easy"
"Easy to drink, but not too complex. A safe bet for a beer, but not my first choice."
"Medium body, good carbonation, mild alcohol content and an average non-descript mouthfeel. Easy to drink, yet far from spectacular...sessions anyone?"
"The mouthfeel is very light and flat on the tongue. Uninspiring. Overall, it is a very drinkable session beer. Not exploding with character, but good to have around in a pinch."
"Bass Pale Ale pours an orange hue with a thick off white head from a brown bottle. The smell is underwhelming. Not much of anything. Does have typical English Pale Ale character, but in a muted sort of way. Kind of like its been dumbed down. I'm not particularly impressed."
"Not bad. What I usually opt for at a crappy Irish bar on the South Shore, here in Mass. Basic, but goes down nice. You could do a whole hell of a lot worse."
"D - Drinkable. I guess English Pale Ales do not have as much hops as an APA, I believe this is my first EPA. Not a bad brew, but will most likely not buy again."
"Overall, this beer was a bit too carbonated for my taste, but better than many large labels readily available. For its price however, something better could certainly be found. This beer wouldn't be my first choice, but I am sure I will buy it again."
"Poured a golden brown with a good head and fair amount of lacing on the glass. Smell is OK, but this beer goes down smooth. The taste is of hops and malt -- has a slight kick to it, so if you're a Bud drinker, you may want to try this if you feel like something a little different. Mouthfeel is very good b/c of the fair amount of carbonation. This is definitely a session beer."
"Good color and head. Underwhelming smell. Quite a smooth taste. And not too much disturbance on the tongue going down. Smooth all around, and I don't think that's 100% a good thing here. It's just too blah, too boring. I'm just not excited by the taste. However, I definitely like this one better on tap than in the bottle."
" This is your benchmark English Pale Ale. The flavors are very well balanced. Creamy mouthfeel and oh so drinkable."
"Drinkability: not bad at all , quite sessionable"
"D - high, i love thses, very easy to pound, even my girlfriend like Bass which says alot for its drinkability"
"Flavor was malts, brown sugar, and a mild hop finish. Not bad, but not as good as I remember the tap version to be. I'm pretty sure I'd be a full point higher if this was either fresher, or from a tap. Will have to locate it somewhere and review again at later date."
"While this beer doesn't have the same character that other pale ales possess, it's still a pretty decent beer. I'd love to try some fresh on-tap as I'm sure it would stand up to some of the good pale ales we have on the local scene much better than this bottle does."
"Drinkability: Very easy to drink, but tastes a little sweeter in the can than I remember from the bottle. A good solid English pale ale."
" a grainy smell with hint of caramel. very similar to penn dark but milder the mouthfeel was great i really enjoyed how it felt on my tongue. tasted like grain with a nice caramel flavoring. a real treat i will enjoy in the future, a great beer you can find anywhere"
"poured from the ""pub pour"" can that falsely promised a thick and long lasting head. I tried my best to induce a head, only came up with about an eighth of an inch that quickly disapeared. Color was light copper with little to no lacing. I was unable to get much aroma out of this brew. Along with trying to pour a large head, I was also agitating the beer, but was unable to get any real aroma out of it. Taste was average. Smooth with hints of malt and hops, but nothing special when it comes to ales. Clean in the mouth. I don't think I'll buy this stuff again."
"This beer is not bad but not really one of my favorites either."
"A yummy beer, all-in-all. I'd have it again. Ideally next time on an engine."
"Amber to orange/red in color with a pretty average head. The smell is mostly just malt and hops, not too weak or too strong. The taste is basically malty with some bitter hops to it. The mouthfeel is medium, highly carbonated. I think this beer lacks constancy sometimes, I've had really good batches and some that missed the mark. Recently, I was dining at a restaurant with a friend and the waitress (most likely accidentally) sold pitchers to us at the domestic special price of $3 a pitcher, same as the macro swill. Not only that, but for some reason the beer seemed especially sweet that night. Maybe it was just the price.."
"Note: I had this with the Thai Chicken pizzathe combo makes me want to weep openly because it is so good."
"Pours a very nice dark amber, with a nice head. Aroma has hints of toasted malt and hops... The hops have an initial bite on the tongue but hten fade... Aftertaste is kind of sweet, maybe too much so. Good mouthfeel, a well balanced brew in terms of gravity:IBU. Not a bad standby if only macros are available."
"Pours a nice amber color. Frothy white head about an inch thick with an assortment of bubble sizes. Head went down after about 5 minutes leaving a small bit a lacing. The smell has a small bit of roastiness to it. Also has sweetness in the smell.Starts off with a smooth malty taste then ends with a slight butter taste and a dash of bitterness. Not bad, no problem drinking a few of these at a time."
"This pours a nice amber color with a smallish head.The smell is faint with some malt to it. The taste has alot of malt and not much else.This is not a bad thing because this is a tasty beer. The m/f is light and a little watery. This is a pretty good brew,but there are better ones."
"Pours a medium copper with a bone-colored head that builds to a finger high and dissipates reasonably slowly and leaves excellent lacing to begin with, although it doesn't hold up as the beer gets drunk. Carbonation is very visible. Smells include malty sweetness, butter, caramel, and fruitiness with a medicinal note present as well. Tastes of burnt caramel and malt, with a buttery flavour and slight hoppiness in the finish. Mouthfeel is fairly well carbonated and smooth, and the drinkability is quite good. Not exceptional by any measure, but a reasonably priced and enjoyable drink."
"This was probably my first ""favorite"" beer, but it's been a little while since I've had it. I'm glad it holds up to my memories. It's certainly not the best beer I've ever had, but I could still drink this all day long."
"To me Bass is unique and identifiable, but I think for my tastes it is just a tad too subdued for a pale ale, particularly in the hop department. Still this is a well-made beer and I'd recommend it to anyone to try at least once."
"Definitely a great beer, should drink it more often, yet, there are too many other pale ales out there."
"Drinkability-Years ago I really liked Bass. That was until I began to experiment with many different beers. I still like it but only on occasion. (Like a free one.) Good on a hot day."
"What else can you say."
"For all know this is the UK version of Bud, but it was very drinkable. A little heavy and dark for pale ale but good just the same. At $4 a bottle, imported or not, its a little over priced. The waitress commented that she didnt serve much of this beer, and thats probably why."
"WTF? Tastes worse this time.I can't believe this is bass. Because it tastes like pure ass."
"The taste is extremely sweet. It is sugary and kind of tastes like fruit roll-up. There is a slight citrus tase, but almost no bitterness at all. Mothfeel is nice and smooth. This is a decent, drinkable beer, but its all wrong for a british pale."
"This is probably the most readily available decent quality ale in America, or at least my part of it. ""Pale Ale"" is really a misnomer by the way, at least to us Americans who tend to consume a lot of cheap macro lagers. But then again, ""relatively pale as ales go"" or ""pale compared to brown ale"" sound really stupid. Anyway color is a sort of gold-brown so if you compare it to American lagers,it falls more into the color range of a beer I might drink (Killians, Yuengling Traditional, Sam Adams, Saranac Smooth Lager) than a pale lager. Seems like this gives more weight to the arguement if you're drinking a bright yellow beer, you're aren't drinking a real beer. Anyway once a neophyte like me wraps his head around the concept that ""pale"" ales aren't that pale the color is pleasant. The head tends to be well formed though not very high. Smell is malty, almost a bit buttery or nutty as well, with just a hint of bitterness. The taste is sweet and malty up front sometimes with little hits of those nuts or that butter in the background. Finish is fairly bitter, but surprisingly (for me) not unpleasant. Bass is also cleaner tasting than I thought. Mouthfeel is fairly thick but not too thick. It quenches thrist pretty well but I only gave drinkability an average rating because I just never seem to have more than one or two Basses unless I have no other choice. Its so common around here that I actually use this as a standby sometimes when even such ordinary choices as my personal favorite Yuengling Traditional aren't available. All in all, I think this stuff deserves its popularity as one of the world's top selling ales. I'm sure there are better ones out there, and I've even tried at least one superior ale myself, but there's no doubt for almost anyone who's tried it that Bass is a quality beer and a good example of its type. And yes, its still a decent beer when its warm, though I certainly prefer it cold (what can I say, I'm American). A side note- the robust flavor, good quality,and slightly higher than average alcohol content make Bass my favorite beer for cooking."
"Overall... An ok beer that I wouldn't pass up if someone handed me one again."
"Much better brew on-tap versus bottle or can."
"This is often my brew of choice at my local hangout (which, obviously, does not boast the best brews in the world, but I like it). It's easy to drink without being too overwhelming to your taste buds, and it's not too filling. It's tasty enough- malts and hops balance each other well, with some lovely caramel and grainy undertones. Mouthfeel is creamy, smooth, and bubbly. Quite drinkable, an overall good beer, would probably make a good session beer. Do not drink this out of the bottle, though... on-tap is much better."
"I dont know what to say about this beer except that it is an old standard. Nothing great, it is exactly what you should expect out of an EPA."
"This beer came a reddish brown with a frothy off white head that left decent lacing around the top of my glass. Smelled faintly of oranges, pine and sweet oats with a dry doughy yeast. Tasted of a sour dryness with no substantial malt and a slight pineapple. Finished with a heavy dryness. The most flavors came if I exhaled through my nose, there was a delicious yeasty pine smell. Mouth feel was thin with mild carbonation. Whats the hype about Bass again?"
"not bad, but a little harsh going down, with a nasty aftertaste, more sour than bitter. no thank you. this beer costs about the same as yona yona, but sucks in comparison."
"Bass served well as one of the intro beers to the world of craft brewing. Since then, far better, less mass produced examples exist of the style. A okay beer to revisit from time to time, and better in the bottle or on draught in my opinion. Still one of the converters for me."
"A nice beer to drink w/ a meal, maybe a steak or something. This is one of the more common beers found on tap in my neck of the woods. Its a copper colored beer w/ slight head. Smell is a malty smell, maybe a hint of nut. Flavor is similar, it has a bitter aftertaste. Its pretty easy to drink, reminds me of Harps."
"The smell was grain and mild floral hops. Not much going on there. The taste follows up similarly. Grainy with a bit of a mild bitterness, but not hugely complex. It was carbonated well enough at least. It is refreshing and easy to drink, but not very complex. I could down a few with food and friends, but otherwise it's merely average."
"Drinkable and refreshing."
"Certainly better than anything from A-B but otherwise, an average beer."
"Drinkability was pretty good. I'm glad I had one of these tonight... it's rare that you get a beer included in the cost of a dinner at a nice restaurant, and this was definitely the best they had to offer."
"Overall, I'm rating the drinkability fairly low. I'm glad I only bought a single of this, for the other five might have been drain-pours for me. It's probably a good bottled beer to share with BMC drinkers, but the lack of flavor bothers me and I don't think I'll be buying it again."
"Overall: A pretty interesting pale ale, likely with a broad range of appeal. Also, the price is right for a beer of this quality. Recommended."
"Overall a fine example of a Pale Ale but a tad low in hop aroma and flavor area's but well within what a good Pale Ale should be."
"Drinkability is spot on. Flavor is full, and won't claustrophobisize you as might its oft-on-tap neighbor, Guinness. Highly, highly recommended."
"Pours clear pale copper under a less than one finger light tan head that fades a bit too quickly to film and collar, leaving just a few spots of lace. The nose is nicely full of barley and spice from the British hops. The mouth is slightly heavy and well carbonated. Smooth, sweet caramel opening, chased by a touch of dry bitterness from the hops. The dry lingers, mixing with a bit of plum sweetness. Not bad drinking brew."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed 1/2"" beige head over the clear amber brew. Head lasts pretty well, and lacing is sticky and plentiful. Aroma is lightly of malt and hops, but overall kind of generic. Taste is caramel malt upfront, with a touch of hops to close. Mouthfeel is very nice, extremely creamy and smooth, and drinkability is high as well. Did well in this presentation."
"This beer is light abmer in color with a small white head that recedes quickly. The aroma is mildly hoppy, and citric. The taste is thin. Mostly water with some hops. The mouthfeel is thin and watery. Honestly, I can't see how this is such a popualr beer. Then again, I also can't see why Bud is either."
"D: Very drinkable, good session beer."
"Beer pours a dark copper color, with a small white head. Some aroma of caramel malt and flowery hops. There is some sweetness balanced with the bitter. As it warms, the alcohol and earthy bitterness get more strong. It is almost buttery feeling, but the bitterness leaves an aftertaste that I didn't really enjoy. I will save my money and probably not get this ""import"" again."
"Re-reviewd on 08 Oct 2005: I've had quite a few other English Pale Ales since this original review in 2004 and Bass, while dependable, is bested by a number of better examples of the style. It's quite pleasant, good looking but a bit of a lightweight when it comes to taste."
"Nice flavor, not overpowering and rather subtle, with just a hint of a roasted flavor in the finish. Nothing ugly in the taste or mouthfeel at all. I like to lump this one together with Harp and Smithwick's, since I think all of them taste rather similar. Bass is my least favorite of the three, but overall a very good English pale ale."
"Notes: good all around brew"
"Bottle obtained from the discount bin at Liquor Mart (Boulder) and consumed about a week later. Bottle stamp is 21F53SH and the bottled foamed over upon opening. A gentle pour earned a three finger creamy head that hung around for quite a while. Crystal clear light brown liquid, a bit lighter in color than the bottle it comes in. Smells malty with a mild hop floral. Malts are caramel and a nip of chocolate. Almost nutty. Hops are dark and with some sulphur. Gentle diacteyl. Lightly woody. Much more in the smell than I expected. Tastes diacetyl with mild malt sweet and a hop that comes across as indecisive. The aftertaste sees a resurgence of the butter (that's diacteyl, in case you didn't know) in a stale form. Although the mouthfeel in medium, the beer has a thickness on the tongue. But, it's almost slick and unsettling. This beer is *not* good. I'm hoping this was a bad bottle. I'll have to give it another try at some point in the future. Carbonation is a bit too strong and the acrid on the tongue detracts from the flavor and mouthfeel. Decent lacing on the inside of the glass."
"I used to think this was one of the best beers around way back in the day, and then actually found the good stuff. Since then I haven't really drank any Bass until the other night. It's actually pretty decent for a semi-mainstream beer. Appears your typical tawny amber color, though not much head. Nice clarity though. And the smell and taste are fairly weak, though there is a nice hint of that classic English style toffee and biscuit taste woven in there along with a creamy malty sweetness. Really mellow hop characteristic, almost non-existent. Creamy medium bodied mouthfeel. Pretty decent."
"Poured a clear ochre-caramel color with negligible head into my pint glass. Aroma is strongly of toffee and malt, with some spices (hint of clove maybe?) and yeast. Taste is somewhat sweet, with a nutty-sweet flavor that's not strong at all. Fruity - red grape-like taste. Mouthfeel was creamy, less peppery than I think a proper pale should be, but went down smooth. Very drinkable, good for summer evenings."
"Pours a clear golden brown, small off white head, some lacing on the glass. Smell is malty, with some chocolate, sweet. Taste is sweet malt, chocolate, little bit of grassy hops. Smooth, medium carbonation, light body, although a decent and refreshing beer."
"Poured a tawny brown, semi-clear. A one finger head leaves some slippery lacing. lightly toasted pale malt and an odd smell difficult to place. The taste is well balanced, burnt malt upfront, with bittering hops evening the palate for a mild flavor and pleasent aftertaste. But it is undercarbonated for it's medium body and a slippery, diacetyl mouthfeel keeps this from being a better beer."
"Bass pours an amber color with a pretty decent sized 3/4 inch tannish head. A good deal of bubble action is noticeable throughout the glass. Its smell is average. Malts with a bit of floral aroma are present. Hops are not terribly noticeable. Nothing special worthy of note. Taste is again mostly malt, with a bit of hop bitterness. There is a bit of a buttery aftertaste that helps overall. But for the most part the flavor is nothing to brag about. Mouthfeel is not bad. It has a surprising fullness with a slight bitterness that remains on the tongue. Carbonation is a bit higher than medium level. For the most part, this is a good beer to drink at many bars with limited selections of drafts. There are many places that it ranks among the one or two best on the menu. But at quality beer joints you wouldn;t think about ordering Bass. Still, price/quality wise, it would be a decent session beer--as long as there are no BA's present."
"Drinkability: I think this has a bit more actual flavor than the bottle. But it seems a little out of balance or character. Still not as drinkable as those little bottles of Bass when served on tap."
"cheers..."
"I sometimes buy this stuff bottled, but I had it on tap recently, which I hadn't had the opportunity to do for quite some time. Anyway, the tap sample of this amber liquid allowed for both the hop aroma and malt flavors to shine through. I've always found the bottle samples to be a bit too muted. The aromas seemed quite floral to me, and mixed well with some medium crystal malt notes on the back end. The roles were reversed on the tongue, with the rounded malt notes taking center stage and the hops bringing up the rear. Good balanced mouthfeel too. It's a classic session ale."
"Aroma is mild, sweet malt and just a touch of hops. Pours a beautiful copper color and possesses a medium white frothy head with excellent lacing. Flavor is malty and sweet with a moderate bitter finish. Moderately carbonated and maybe just a touch watery but has a decent mouthfeel. Balanced, pleasant to drink, and goes down easy. Good commonly available beer."
"Opinion: Well, this isn't too bad for a beer that is pretty easy to find at your local pub. It is by far not my favorite English Ale, but I would take this one over a plethora of other mass produced commercial beers."
"I loved the colour of this beer as soon as I poured it, I hoped that it wouldn't let me down. Nose is typical ale smell, nice balance of sweet and bitter. The bitterness is near perfect. Not too much, very mild carbonation. Goes down very easily and if I knew a place in the city with it on tap, I'd definitely want to give this one a try. It would be a wonderful session beer."
"This is a great beer, an english friend gave me one to try, it was quite different from what im normally used to drinking but it was very good. This beer is worth a try, if I had the money I would buy it again. Not much more to say then whats already been said."
"Drinkability: A very enjoyable beer while on tap I have not had it out of the bottle though. Definatlty reccomended if you find it on tap."
"The head stays low and clings to your pint glass, and the mouth feel is as refreshing as can be for a pub ale. I have a new appreciation for the uniqueness of this classic."
"Had not had this beer in quite some time. Looks brightly golden - copper. Pours a slightly tan head, fairly thick, lingers and laced well. Smells mildly malty and caramelly. Hop spice balance give the aroma complexity. Tastes mallty and caramelly as well. Mild notes of dates and nuts. Light toasty and buttery flavors hide behind carbonation and hop flavor. Mild ginger and clove flavors. Feels moderately creamy and peppery to the toung. Finishes quite light with low lingering bitterness and spiciness. Not as flavorful as I remembered."
"Tasty on tap. Would like to try other serving styles and compare..."
"Appearance is copper color, topped with light foamy head that produced little lacing. Aroma consists of musty yeast and bruised apples. Yuk! Initial taste contains a minute amount of bitter hops and malt, those danged apples again, followed by fruit and brown sugar. This under-carbonated beer leaves a nasty taste in your mouth, and DO NOT drink it warm. Hard to believe this beer is selling well."
"A really decent English pale ale. It has slight hoppy flavors to it with mild undertones of honey and malts. As a stand alone, this is a crisp beer with a slight bitterness and a unique subtle european hoppy finish. Over all recommened as a beer that you can't go wrong with really."
"Pours a clear medium amber with a big foamy head. Excellent head retention and lacing. Smell of herbal hops. First thing I taste is a lot of sweet caramel malt. Malt is met by a pleasant, mild herbal hop bitterness, with a bit of tartness in the background that adds to the overall bite of the brew. Very smooth mouthfeel and very drinkable. I can't vouch for the bottled form, but on tap Bass is a quintessential English Pale Ale that is a bit underrated in my opinion."
"Drinkability- Have had this several times before. I will go to this one because it's usually the best brew a bar will have on tap at times. Decent brew here."
"Big, cream-colored head full of explosions, leaving foamy clumps of lacing. The beer is a clear, red-amber. Nose is dusty, some nutty, faintish fruit. enh. Front is fruity and a little spoonky. Fruity caramel in the light-bodied middle finishes nutty and fruity. Not bad. A nice, light pale."
"my parents always have a 6 of these in thier fridge so i enjoyed one last trip home. very clean caramel orange color. nice 2 finger head that retains pretty well and leaves some nice lacing. smell is of grains and a little citrus. tastes pretty refreshing. not a lot going on otherwise. hop flavor is present but not overpowering like some pale ales. sweetens up a little toward the end. i quite enjoy bass. i don't know how much i'll buy with so many different beers out there i've never had, but bass is a solid fall back."
"Among my favorite beers that is widely available even though the style is not among my favorites. Crystaline copper pour with the carbonation visibly sticking at the head of a mug or glass. Frothy white head that completely sheets/laces any glassware. Slight malt sweetness and tones of fresh sourdough bread that are best had off of tap and server moderately chilled but not iced (bloody Florida bars). Don't bother out of the bottle please, and goto a nice place for fresh taps. Otherwise you'll get something a bit wattery and dimmed down, dissapointing."
"Pours a golden orange with a finger of white head and a moderate amount of lacing. Smell is floral hops and faint simple malts. Taste leans towards the floral resinous hops, with the butterscotchy malts almost, but not quite, managing to balance. Medium bodied with just the right level of carbonation. This is a quality pale ale, even if it is a macro, and I'll never turn my nose up at one."
"Poured from a twelve ounce bottle purchased (on sale, .99 cents) at the North Coast Co-op in Arcata, California. Looks very fine in my Lost Coast pint glass: body is bright translucent amber; the head is frothy, whipped thickness, off-white, great retention that leaves some thick lace patches on the glass. Smell: baked red delicious apples, light on the spice, pine needles, slight hint of fresh grape juice behind all of this. Taste: upfront twang of crisp hops that take their time twangin' before some buttery notes comes through toward the middle, along with a slice of crisp green apple. Aftertaste is an unsalted saltine cracker yeastiness as the hop twist recedes in the background, taking its time. Mouthfeel: coats my palate perfectly; a chewy, even silky texture that provides a great canvas for the hearty, sturdy flavors. Carbonation is slight but spot on. Hey, this ain't bad."
"Pours a golden orange color (slightly darker than the average english pale) with a nice white head that dissapates quickly. The aroma is a mix of earthy, piney hops with fruity english ale yeast, not spectacular but not bad either. Taste is light floral hops, biscuit like malt, and a hint of fruit (apples maybe from the ale yeast). Finish is clean and crisp with moderate carbonation and very little bitterness. In this day and age Bass is not very unique but it was one of the original English Pale's so you have to give it some respect. The drinkability is pretty high and this is easily a great session beer, especially if you're not trying to burn out your taste buds with overly hoppy american renditions."
"The color was a redish amber. The beer was poured so that each imperial pint was all beer and no head. Decent lace. Sweet mix of malt and hops aroma. Smooth and crisp. Good malt and hops taste that is well balanced. Slighty buttery. Creamy mouth feel with a very good aftertaste. I truely enjoyed every and every pint of Bass Ale."
"Pours to a beautiful reddish anber color with nice big head. I smell light flower and moderate amount of caramel. Oily in texture with taste being earthy and caramel, but neither are overwhelming. Leaves a pleasent bitter aftertaste. Overall this pale ale is more subtle than other pal ales I've had. By far one of the best looking and clear."
"All in all, not bad, but I don't think I'll make it a mainstay."
" The bitter hangs around dominantly in the after-taste as well. A solution would be never stop swallowing I suppose. I'm torn on Bass PA. IT looks great, smells great, has a mouthfeel of quality and yet it is a little out of balance on taste. It needs more of a malt flavor to attain praise from me."
"This is a great beer, it has very little scent, good head, the most important part flaver which is its best part. I had this beer on tap once and it was better, A bottle is ok but pour it into a glass it is better. Not the best with popcorn though..."
"Always pours golden with good head. Crisp refreshing flavor with a bit of hops a bit of fruit. Well balanced ale and always consistant and always good."
"FINAL CONCLUSION: Craft Pale Ales like Magic Hat and Sierra Nevada make this one look awful."
"Overall impression: Enjoyable beer that makes for a nice session. Great gateway beer - everyone recognizes the name and logo."
"As for drinkability, very good when it's warmed up a bit; I could drink 4 or 5 without noticing. But the sharper flavor it has when it's cold would prevent me from being able to drink a lot of it at that temperature."
"Drinkability: I was one of my premium imported I ever drank. That time, it was still enjoyable to drink Bass again, but the beer tastes beer when warmer than usual serving temperature."
"A solid offering with excellent availability. Very balanced."
"The appearance was very pale without any head whatsoever. The smell was a bouquet of flowers with slightly over ripe fruit. The taste was not much of note, except for the hops which came through and provide some balance for heavily laden malts. However, it was slighty flat. This is one of those beers that I can always rely upon if there is nothing else."
"This is not the Bass I remember. Heck, it's not even brewed in Burton-on-Trent anymore. Pours a orange amber color with a pale tan head. Nothing to get excited about with the aroma either, faint bready malts with a touch of caramel. I used to enjoy the twang from the hard water used in the brewing but it is almost nonexsistent now. I would not refuse one, just would not go out of my way to get one. Another casualty of Interbrew."
"Dark, golden-orange body with a small, off-khaki head that doesn't stick around too long. Fruity, breadry malt aromas with a hint of toffee and a faint, delicate hop backing. Toasted grain and biscuit flavors over minerally, fruity esters. Gives it a whiskey-ish character. Light hop bitterness combines with a fruity whiskey burn into the finish. Medium bodied with a soft feel. Not bad."
"One thing that can be very exciting about this beer is when it's on tap; 8 times out of 10 it's just about the same everywhere, but every so often you find a place where the Bass is delicious. At the 'Round The Clock Diner near 3rd ave and St. Marks in Manhattan the Bass has been delicious every time I've tried. it. At that place I'd rate the taste a 5."
"Had this at the Miner's arms in Eyan, England - said to be the home of the black plague. Atmosphere alone made this beer better, no denying that. The golden & creamy looking brew had a nice cascading head as it was pumped from the cask. Perfect temperature. This brew is a whole different animal over here. Starts off with a mild apple type flavor..then onto a full, creamy body that coats the mouth with subtle malt and a tasty butterscotch diacetyl flavor. The mouthfeel is perfect -like a cloud in the mouth, and I could no doubt doubt drink this all night..especially in a tiny village with some locals by the fire in a 17th century pub....what a treat."
"Expected a better tap selection but Bass was touted by a recent post topic and I was curious. Better that expected would select it over the other macros when I eat there again. Or maybe go across town and have a Duval!"
"A clean golden amber beer. Has a small off white head that hangs around and leaves a little lace. The aroma has a solid sweet caramel character with a toffee note in the background. The taste starts witha light sweet maltiness with a hint of caramel. A light dry hoppiness with the malt sweetness on the finish makes this a easy going session beer."
"From a 568 mL bottle. Pours into the pint glass an amber color with a 1 finger head that retains throughout but leaves little lacing. Smell is of diacetyl and hop spiciness. The taste delivers this plus caramel and a bit of chocolate. Feels decent. Pretty straightforward but good."
"I'd still take good ol' Bass over a good many other however, so that's something."
"I'm certain Bass was much tastier fifteen years ago when I first tried it. It's also a better beer in the UK than in the US. Here, it's a poor example of an English bitter."
"Bass has been a go to brew for a while now, so I thought I would give it a review. I like the appearance, a nice mix of copper, orange and gold. Pours with a nice one and a half inch head, that reduces to a beautiful quater inch. I am getting a skunky nose, not what I am use to when I have this beer on tap. Although through the skunk, I can pick up some spicy hops. The taste is kind of flat, first some sweet maltiness, followed by a hoppy bite, just what I would expect from this type of beer. The mouthfeel is ok, nice and slippery with the right amount of bubbles. For some reason, I don't know what it is, I have never been able to drink very many in a sitting. I can drink a couple, but that is about it."
"The Bass Pub-pour can. Not a widget-type nitrogenated beer, just charged with a mix of carbon dioxide and nitrogen gases. Pours the same as Bass, but with a soapier head. I'm not going to get into nuances of the beer. It's regular old Bass Pale Ale, in a can, that is is charged during canning as such and makes no significant impact on heightening the beer's enjoyability. In fact, the further metallic taste that shows up in the can is rather distracting. This version of Bass seems to be just a marketing gimmick preying on the 14.9 oz. widget-can phenomenon. It has not impressed me, whatsoever."
"A good beer on a hot day as it quenches your thirst. It also goes good with a steak dinner."
"Label states: Since 1777. Interbrew UK Ltd. - Luton, England"
"Nice and smooth, a pretty decent session brew and good alternative to teh macros on tap all over town."
"Having consumed this beer countless times before, it is about time that I enter my review of it. It pours a golden reddish color with a thin head on top. The aroma is crisp and malty but without much to rave about. The flavor is rich with sweet malt and fruity diacetyl notes. It is a bit watery at the end with little in the hop department. Some sourness registers as well. It is clean and soft on the palata but the watery end of it makes it a bit less desirable. Overall this beer is a good beer to drink when there is nothing better around, like in a bar at the airport."
"If by some freak of nature you haven't tried Bass, assuming you aren't religiously opposed to it, give it a try. It's a damn fine drink."
"Bass is a great session beer, apparently its a shade of what it once was but still a very tastey balanced beer."
"around a while. Below average. Would prefer club soda."
"This beer is absolute rubbish."
"All in all, a good pale ale."
"Pours medium reddish-amber, a very nice color. Nice carbonation, 1 finger of head that has decent retention. Not much coming in from the nose, a bit of malt, hops, and hints of sweetness. Taste is very nice. I was expected a more watery ale flavor, but Bass has got a rather full body that isn't overly hoppy nor alcoholy. A nice balance of the flavors with moderate malt and bitterness along with a creamy sweet background that makes the entire brew quite smooth. A very drinkable ""popular"" beer."
"The venerable Bass Pale Ale. It might not be very extreme for a Pale Ale, but it certainly is drinkable. It pours a nice amber color and has a nice white head that it retains well and it leaves lots of lacing on my glass. There is a touch of hops and a nice crisp malty aroma, nothing exciting, but good nonetheless. It has a very mild flavor, again nothing extreme, but it is very pleasing to drink. It definitely is a great session beer. It is an all around decent British Pale Ale and it is no wonder it has remained so popular since it's creation."
"Taste was of sweet toffee with a dry floral aftertaste. Well blended flavor but its still an average beer in my book."
"Paid $4.40 for a 22oz glass. Tried Bass many a times in my day but not in the past six months to recall its qualities. A bit overrated in my book. Nice mouthfeel for a Pale Ale. Poured an average head and carbonation...no real lacing. Finished it off fine. A bit hoppy but not any more than a typical Pale Ale. Okay at best."
"This is a beer that doesn't give anything out of the ordinary. Quite booring but very drinkable."
"Pours out a reddish sort of cross between crimson and orange. Very small, whitish head that quickly dissipates. Nothing particularly wonderful. The aroma is pleasant, but not very strong. Something of understated malt and a sweet, fruity (currant / other berry?) scent dominates. Taste is so-so. It is an acquired taste in my opinion. Strong hops right up front, with a sweet finish that slowly switches to a dry tanginess at the end. Fairly complex, but not something I would consider all that wonderful. Mouthfeel is actually one of this offering's stronger suits. Perhaps a little over-carbonated, but still manages to have enough substance for my personal preferences - also fairly true to the style. Drinkability is so-so... I usually buy a six-pack of Bass Pale Ale about every 2 years..."
"Good Pale Ale."
"This used to be a favorite of mine when dining out. It's still good, but I am finding more and more better beers out there. With my expanding understanding of styles and expectations of a style, I will have to be mindful of the differences between EPA, APA, and IPA in the future."
"So, although at first, it seemed it would be a disappointment, the result is a beer that has found its way to high place in my personal rankings."
"Very nice beer to have a few pitchers of."
"Overall-A superb ale, doesn't seem like it gets enough recognition on here sometimes but you'd be hard pressed to do better. A fantastic session beer to enjoy good moments with. Only drawback is it's slightly expensive but aren't many good beers these days. Highly recommended from me."
"This beer came off the tap an golden amber color with a finger of head that sticks around to sit atop the beer. The nose is really sweet with hints of honey covered caramel. The flavor is odd to me. It is very sweet, almost fruity, with a really bad tang on the finish. There is also a metallic flavor in there. I don't really like it. The feel is moderate, somewhat creamy, but nothing special really. The drnkability is just okay. The flavor takes away a bit from the beer overall."
"poured amber with a nice creamy head.aroma, malty, citrus, nutty. flavor was on the weak side, lighty sweet, citrus, brown sugar, hints of hops and malts, with some bittness . not to bad of a beer, the type you can serve to impress the people you know who drink bud"
"The body is decent, and it goes down pretty smooth."
"Bass Pale Ale is a beer that lives fondly in memory, but I won't let that influence this review. When consumed with an open (and newly expanded) mind and palate, it just isn't that good. Would it do in a pinch? Sure, but when my local stores carry dozens of beers that are better, I can't see myself buying it again."
"The aroma is bready and yeasty with a fruit undertone. The taste is much the same. There are traces of crackers and wheat bread with a slightly bitter aftertaste. There are hints of spiced apple in the flavor as well. Overall, this is not a bad beer that has a distinct flavor."
"Drinkability is good for Bass and the overall taste and mouthfeel is quite acceptable. I think the balance between sweetness and a somewhat bitter finish is well controlled. A solid choice when faced with limited options at your typical restaurant or pub in the States."
"I can't believe that I've never rated this classic. This along with SNPA and Boston Lager were the 3 beers that introduced me to this world. Pours an amber color with a large head that is full of craters. Smell is of sweet carmelish malt. Taste is full of bready malt accented by sweet carmel. It also has a mild burnt toast flavor. Very little hop aroma or taste. A decent session beer and nice to have once in awhile, but better can definately be had."
"Kind of a murky red colour, with a light, tiny bubbled head. Very little lace stayed on the glass. Smell is of malt, bit of grass, some hops, and mineral water. Taste is more complex with minerals than any actual 'beer' ingredient. Their is a decent hard water taste too this, which detracts from any hop or malt profile. Malt is quite dull, weakened. Just a light sweetness. Hops are more grassy, and again dull and overpowered by minerals used. Overall, a full body mouthfeel. Bit thick and nice. Quite refreshing, though not incredibly enjoyable."
"Clear amber coloured beer topped with a thin white lace. Fruity banana aroma with a light hoppiness and biscuity, bready maltiness. Definite diacetyl flavour and buttery texture. Nice bitterness at the base of the flavour, along with some fruity esters and caramel malt. Medium/light body and lightly carbonated, with a bit of CO2 bite at the finish. Bitter aftertaste with a hint of diacetyl that lingers."
"A good beer to drink while watching Monty Python's Flying Circus. Normally, I don't have this beer unless it is paired with Guinness in a black and tan (or Harp), but it is good to have it on its own. I nice mild smell with some sweetness goes along with the nice brown color. The first swallow is smooth and malty, going down easily. Not too carbonated, and the aftertaste is more mild maltiness and caramel. Overall, a very good beer to have around. Next time, I should drop the black and just have the tan."
"Easily consumable and light on the palate; plus you can find this virtually anywhere. Plenty of other EPA's I'd rather be drinking."
"Bottled Canadian import...pasturized 5.1% AVB...poured a beautiful color with orange highlights....1finger white tightly pored cap..leaves a sticky lace... very suble nose...sweet fruits and floral hops are very understated. Starts mellow and sparkling from the carbonation (too much for this mild ale) flavors of bready malts well balanced with mild citus hops and a nice little underlying hint of honey...very wet mouthfeel...finishes cleanly with a slight metalic hop after taste...a mild English pale that is very drinkable"
"Completely different in cask-conditioned form in the UK... but that's another story."
"sheep in wolves cloth"
"A little suprised by this, you see it everywhere so you think it will be below par, far from it, while not great, a solid offering. Pours a dark orange/brownish with a off white 2 inch thick head. The head fizzles down but still impressive, lacing is average. The taste is a fruity hint of huckleberry, slight grainy bread notes throughout, the sweet sugar molasses is light and refreshing, hops are slight but noticable and bring a nice balance to the beer, still seems a little lackluster however. The aroma is of sugared grain, almost brown roasted sugar. The toasted grains are pleasant. Light to medium bodied for a pale, not bad."
"Bottle: Poured a light brown beer with a medium head. Carbonation is on the weak side. Aroma is a nice enough mix of malt. Taste is very classic English ale and ends with some medium bitterness. Very well balance between the malt and the bitterness. I guess this is a very decent if unspectacular drink."
"One of the classic regular available imports. A solid English Pale Ale."
"Overll, it was not bad, but there are better ways to spend your time."
"Bass is always a good standby, and a good ""gateway"" beer for those looking to get away from US macrobrews. There's nothing thrilling here, just comforting."
"Had this on-tap tonight for the first time and really enjoyed it. Appearance is a nice light amber with an average sized, somewhat thick head. Smell is pretty standard, mainly malt smell noted. Taste isn't as hoppy as I thought it would be, has somewhat of a honey finish. Very enjoyable! A perfect easy-to-drink, yet very tasty beer. Will definently have this beer again."
"Overall: This is the classic English pale ale and makes for a great session beer. It's nothing special, and is middle-of-the-road all the way. And although a little overpriced, this beer is very accessible and drinkable, and offers a great alternative to the macro-lagers for rather novice beer drinkers."
"I've been drinking Bass for a few years now, but it was last year that I really started appreciating it. Pours out a light brown color with half an inch of head. The smell isn't anything to write home about, but it's not bad either, just nothing that stands out about it. You can really taste the hops. They give it a nice, clean, smooth taste. Great balance with the malts too. It goes down great without being too heavy or too light. An above average, well-balanced, enjoyable beer with a bit of an old-fashioned character to it."
"Final Thought: Pleasent, better on tap than poured from the bottle, a fine pale ale in my book."
"Thick, deep head. Light amber color. Floral hop scent. Very soft on the palate with a very mellow hop flavor and limited bitterness. Very basic pale ale. Single, minimamal hop aroma, flavor and bite. Finishes quickly, leaves hardly any aftertaste. Brown 12oz."
"Overall I was somewhat disappointed by this beer, I'd expect a better body to the beer and a flavour packing more of a punch."
"A good beer to have more than one of by itself. With food, I'd get too fuuulll."
"This might make a good starting point for those interested in pale ale, but it is definitely one of the weaker examples (character, not overall quality). I prefer a serious I.P.A., but this is by no means bad. I'll be looking for it on tap in the near future."
"Just an average beer.It was light to intermediate in depth of the amber coloration. There was a nice head which did last the duration of the pint. There was nothing in the smell or taste areas to be excited about. Unfortunately this beer is far to prevalent as an alternative to american macros."
"Bass, reach for greatness. That's their new radio ad that's played everyday. So am I reaching for greatness? Not really. Appearance is nice though. Poured out a dark amber color. Quite dark for a pale ale with the right amount of carbonation. Smell was subdued a lot. Some malts in there with some earth tones and some hops, but not very much. Taste was on the light side too. Malts start out and last all the way through then mixed with some hops and buttery tones in the middle that lasts through the end. It was balanced, but too light and thin. Have this beer on tap."
"Tight off white head, clear light amber in the glass. Nose is relatively tame with some mild sweet maltiness and very little hop presence. The taste is light to medium maltiness, decent but wimpy hop bitterness and some fruitiness with that Bass yeast estery flavor. Finishes light and refreshing...a very tame Pale Ale, yet very good for ""session"" imbibing. I have to laugh everytime I see the ""I.P.A."" designation on the label. A good beginner's ale."
"Easy to get here, but very mediocre"
"Poured into a pint glass from a 12oz bottle with no date on it. A nice one finger off-white head with an ample amount of carbonation rising to the top. The beer is a nice orangish copper color. Floral hops are first noticed upon initial whiff. A medium bodied mildly bittered pale that finishes somewhat dry with a little bit of hops on the finish. A very decent beer but nothing eye opening."
"really good color and a good head. nothing in the way of lacing. taste is nice, sweet, but a little off. i don't know what i don't like about it but there is surely something. maybe the sweetness. alot of sweet malt going on in the taste and the smell. just a hint of hops on the aftertaste."
"Pours a bronze clear liquid with a foamy white head. The head disappears fairly quickly. There is very little lace left on the glass. The smell is somewhat mild, can't really pinpoint anything. Taste slightly of toasted malt, a little caramel. with a very dry hop finish. Hop finish seems somewhat flowery, not really citrusy. A little thin in body, but overall not too bad. I find this to be an old standby, if there is only macro's to compete. I can see this as a good session beer, and wonder what it is like oversees, or possibly from a cask."
"A decent pale ale, certainly not the best, definitely historical though."
"... and why was Burton built on Trent?"
"Easy beer to drink. I used to really enjoy this beer but the more craft beer I drink the higher my standards get. Definitly much better than a Bud or Miller."
"Drinkability: a great light beer for those hot days sitting around the lake"
"ng"
"The subdued characteristics of this beer make it inoffensive but not necessarily one I would want to drink all the time. I think my memories of this beer are the stuff of nostalgia--they just don't live up to the reality."
"This is one of the beers I keep around all the time. Pours a nice tan head that sticks around. The smell in limited to a bit of hops. The taste is very much a english ale flavor with a bit of a sen-sen and carmel. Light on the mouth and easy to drink. Even at the price, I enjoy at least one a day."
"I would recomend this to my friends as an intro to finer beers."
"Hmm....It's been a long time since I've had Bass and there seems to have been a steep drop off in quality since my last taste. It pours a medium orange-amber with a dense off-white head....but it's all downhill from there. The smell is scant...with some barely perceptible light caramel. There's some good caramel flavor with a bit of tea like hops for balance but it's too thin for a pale ale. This is just one step above a domestic macro."
"The Bass poured a nice rich amber with a good finger of head that held firm. It smelled overwhelmingly of alcohol with slight tinges of hops and spice. The taste was almost entirely hops and alcohol. The feel was light bodied and slightly oily. I could only take one of these, while I've had worse beers it was not enjoyable and I switched on my next round."
"My dad liked it and he is an avowed lager drinker, so it's appealing to many different people I think."
"It pours a head about two fingers tall with a light tan color. It is reduced pretty quickly but the lacing follows the beer all the way through. Tasty malty beer with sweet aromas and some burnt aromas as well as roasted tastes. Light hop taste. Very smooth on your tongue and goes down smooth as well. Leaves a nice caramel after taste."
"I've had this brew before, both from the bottle, and on tap. Though I just had a few pints from the Fox and Hound here in the Dallas-area, and decided to review it. The appearance is a lighter amber color with a decent head that ended up settling down to a thin line around the glass. The smell was a pleasing balance between the hops and malt. The taste was smooth, and for a lack of a better description, very ""balanced", it didn't seem like any one characteristic just jumped out at you. For being very widely available, this is a good tasting and drinkable beer."
"Nice amber apperance with a decent head along with unbelievable lacing. Malty nose with an initially sweet taste followed by a mid palate dryness with a decent bitter dry finish. Mouthfeel was medium bodied with a rounded feeling. Not a gulping beer, drinkability was ok, but not spectacular. Not a bad offering..I would try again."
"pours a nice looking amber with a bubbly lively head. smells a bit sweet, lightly toasted malts...mmmm. tastes pretty damn good. buttery with light hints of caramel and toasted malt, subdued yet spicey hops and finishes a tad dry. feels a little creamy in the mouth but still has a nice crisp carbonation. highly drinkable, great english pale ale. this has session beer written all over it."
"Comments  I usually find myself in the same ballpark with the other BAs, especially on a beer like this that has had so many reviews. But it seems that I liked this more than most. Oh, well, I guess thats why we rate em : )"
"This is a very good beer and a great example of an English Pale Ale. It poured a light amber color with a good sized white head that stuck to the glass all the way down. The smell was kind of skunky but with a good floral hop scent. The taste is very malty with a touch of sweetness in there, but not too much as to make it annoying. The hop profile also comes through very nicely and bites at the end. All in all a very good pale ale."
"A pleasant surprise. I didn’t expect much from such a ubiquitous brew, but, like Sam Adams, it’s also solid. Good stuff."
"A highly drinkable beer, my only critique is that I enjoy it slightly more on draught. Having said that, this really is a wonderful beer, often overlooked by the average beer geek. Don't take this well-made English ale for granted, even if the marketing department at Bass promotes its product all over the place these days."
"Aftertaste is dry, with a touch of metallic bitterness that fades out to a pleasant, balanced bitterness."
"To me Bass on tap is a step down to Bass in the Bottle. Depending where you go and the shape of the keg will make a difference. Sometimes it will have a bit of a tinny taste to it, but thats is very rare. And when that happens to me a few minutes later they kick the keg and start fresh. If you get Bass from a fresh keg Bass is the king of beers. Nothing will beat it, maybe Sam Adams, but it is a close fight. It has a good dark, amber color, witha perfect head on it. It can either go down quick or you can take your time with and enjoy it. It is a bit more bubbly in the mouth as compared to the bottle, but not enought to really notice. But all in all it is just like the bottle, but just enought to be different."
"I don't mind an unusual tasting beer. I quite enjoy the earthiness you can find in many beers. But this one just don't work."
"Copper body with a decent tan head. Smell is bready with light hops and heavy malt. Some floral notes as well. This beer tastes much better on tap. The bottle tastes like it has a much higher alcohol content. More hops in the bottle than from the tap too. Same good diacetyl butterscotch flavor though. And ofcouse, coming from the bottle, there is much more carbonation. Bass from the bottle is only OK, while on-tap it is close to great."
"Alot of times when at bars its either Bass Guiness or macro so I drink alot of this,pours a nice golden color with usually not much head,aroma is malty with light fruitiness.There is a decent crisp maltiness to the brew but pretty subdues a fruity tinge makes it a decent one to drink more than one at a time while hangin out,hey in my opinion when at a bar with not much selection you cant go wrong here."
"But the one on-tap reminded me of why I like Bass in the first place. It was gently fragrant, and tasted of a crisp malt that was a perfect companion to dinner. The hops didn't hit me over the head, just gave a reminder they were there. That glass held a beer that knew its job and did it well."
"Drinkability is good."
"I hate to penalize a beer for how it was served, but I have to rate what I drank."
"A nice red color with no head. I really didn't smell anything but I was in a bar and smoke was clouding my nose. Taste was a nice bitter with hints of hops and citrus. Not very hoppy but nothing to get excited about. I liked this beer and will have it again but not before I hit a better pale ale. I got a free glass too. Oh joy."
"OK, it's not a bad beer. Overall, above average, for sure, but it's just so damned mild-mannered that it's nothing to get excited about. It's quality, with a nicely tuned balance of flavor elements, but it does so at the expense of any kind of strong presence. At the same time, this mellow balance makes it very drinkable, sliding down easily, with nothing to hold it back, but then nothing to make you raise your eyebrows in pleasant surprise either. My real sticking point here is that with so many beers available, with so much more flavor, and just as well-balanced, I just can't justify coming back to this unless it's the best on tap at a beer-challenged establishment. And if it is, I'm okay with that, but I certainly won't be impressed."
"I don't generally go for pale ales, but this was a nice one."
" I was disappointed in the aroma, as there is a dearth of anything significant. Caramel and some bitter, floral hops are barely picked up. I had a bottle of this at a restaurant a couple weeks ago, that had a much more pronounced aroma. Mouthfeel is immediately bitter and quite carbonated. That gets your tongue's attention! Taste is light bodied, caramel malt backbone with bittering hops. Dry finish. A solid British Pale Ale, but nothing to get excited about. I've noted a significant difference in the quality of Bass Ale, in the many different locations where I've sampled a bottle. I've had much better, and slightly worse, but this is a review of the two bottles I bought and enjoyed today."
"The finish is dry and slightly bitter. The body is medium light with a high drinkability."
"Bass was one of my first ""real beers"". I haven't had it in some time, but last night I finally had my first glass in a few years at The Winfield Grill. It was the textbook amber hue with a small, but lacey head. There was a fair amount of carbonation, but not too much. It had a fruity hop scent that wasn't too overpowering. The taste was also semi fruity and hoppy, yet there was a grainy feel to it. With all this, it went down smooth and I will drink it again."
"Overall: People in the USA frequently confuse this beer with the once legendary Draught Bass (now owned and brewed by Interbrew UK and not Coors  clear as mud eh?). Well Draught Bass is only 4.4% and was certainly the benchmark Cask beer for quality in the UK for many years. As far as I am aware Bass Pale Ale (5.0%) has never been available from the Cask, only Keg. Even so, the stuff that is bottled and kegged that comes Stateside is still a good beer. Not a bad offering in the bottle at all, but I still prefer the freshness and lower carbonation level of this brew on Tap I think."
"WTF, why did they have to give this to me in a frosted pint glass? Such is life, I guess, it's still good ol' Bass. I absolutely love the amber color of this beer. Good head retention too. It's kind of watery but nothing bad. The taste not too strong in any aspect. An all around good beer."
"A classic well rounded ale. The pale ruby color and the relatively thin head provide the traditional English ale appearance. This beer has the apple ester and mild hoppy nose I expect from Bass though not quite the IPA level hop aromas we see in most US IPAs. This is a very easy drinking beer that is well balanced; cool quality malt, crisp hop balance and fruity yeast undertones balance this beer real well. One of my old standbys, available almost anywhere, and always right on when the other choices are thin."
"A pleasing beer, though not spectacular; it is a world wide megabrew, after all. Though I've thought of it as being red in color, here I see it more as a golden brown. Short-lived head leaves a little lace behind. Nice ""red ale"" taste that balances caramel malt taste and spicy English hoppiness, with a hint of ""Juicy Fruit," too. Still, if you can get a Miller drinker to try this out, you may be opening him up to a new world of beers."
"I am not one to bemoan the past but this beer is definitely one that is but a shadow of its former self circa 7-8 years ago. Much better on draft but it has a long way to go to be great again."
"As England's first registered trademark, it is no wonder why this ale has lasted as long as it has, it is consistant and very drinkable. The slight bitterness is nothing but welcomed with the fruity undertones and oh-so-slight caramel flavor."
"Pours a amber / orange color with a thin head. The head disappeared rather quickly leaving spots on the surface. The aroma is slightly dull as some malt and fruitiness is detected. The taste is of malt and bitterness which is balanced. Some fruit tones are detectable. The bitterness seems to arrive a little stronger on the tongue after swallowing. Not as flavorful as some other pales, but very drinkable. This is the usual restaurant choice when beer menu is lacking."
"Nothing earth shattering, but this pint exceeded my expectations in the world of macros."
"A good beer, but nothing terribly special."
"Bass gets a huge nod from me as an excellent session beer, goes well with food, and even my wife likes it!"
"thin creamy colored head with thick dense bubbles, clear brilliant amber-orange color. sweet aroma with hints of peated malt, kinda has a slight ""scotch"" flavor to it. very good slightly heavy mouthfeel with a good palate cleansing carbonation. couldn't detect any hops, very well balanced with a nice malt character. excellent session beer and available in most places...beats all the standard offerings in your typical restaurant."
"Wow, drunk on cask in the UK, bass is a completely different ale. Firstly, the alcohol by volume drops from 5.0 to 4.0. The amazing thing is, you get much more flavor from this 4.0 version than you do from the stateside one. The colour is a nice cascading yellow colour with an off-white head. The aromas are of biscuits, bready malts, and faint hops. The taste is biscuity and bready with a bit of a hop kick. The mouthfeel is super creamy and good....and the drinkability, you may ask? Well I was drinking one waiting for my flight to be called, and it was called right after I ordered this, so I drank it all in one go!"
"- Backdated tasting: I first reviewed this beer on 19JUN03, this post is based on notes from that review. -"
"Poured with a small head that didn't stay long. Nice initial hop wood malt bouquet. First taste had a nice carmel tinge full, and smooth, but that seemed to fade rather quickly, it seemed to get dry and well ordinary as it went along.No bad aftertaste. Drinkable but not bragable."
"A middle of the road pale ale."
"When poured, developed a thick rough foamy head that lingered for a while. As it dissipated, it left some thin lace around the glass. Pale orange body with decent carbonation. Little to nonexistent hop aroma and no distinctive smell. Hop bitteness was however much stonger than the smell sugessted. Good taste, but a bit on the light side for this style. Some sour aftertaste that was a bit funky (I bought a 12 pack so it was not spoilage). Nicely drinkable but somewhat unexceptional Ale. Could have used a dose of character."
"Other: I remember Bass being quite hoppy and pale. What no talent ass clown messed it up?"
"They say this beer has lost a lot of charactor sice they adapted the new brewing system. Although I never has hte pleasure of appreciating the original, I had my share of this one. Pours with a copper color with a thin white head that diminishes into a white lace. Aroma is malty with a slight hint of hops. The taste is of caramel and well balanced by the subtle hops. Light in body and very drinkable."
"This is a great gateway beer and one of the first good beers that I drank on a regular basis. Ruby/amber in color with a decent sized thick creamy head that tracks the sides of the glass to the end. Faint buttery and roasted aromas with a touch of hops. Taste is same as the smells but more pronounced. Buttery roasted nutty flavor of malts with a kiss of hops and a mineral component as well. Very well balanced and very drinkable. One of my favorites as a session beer."
"probably the standard for good, euro pale ales. a solid brew all around. i don't order it as much as i used to, but it's usually a safe bet to be on tap in most bars/eateries. there's a nice brown/ruby colour here. mine was poured with absolutely no head. hopefully, this was the bartender's ignorance, as everything else about the beer was just fine. not too complex overall, but there are traces of butter, a nice maltiness, some caramel and hints of hoppiness her eand there. why this was ever pushed as an i.p.a. is beyond me, because it certainly not one. definitely an easy drinking brew that can be enjoyed year round."
"Very little difference in the taste in the US versus the UK, which holds rue for most Pale Ales. I use Bass as a benchmark for the style and it really deserves that position despite being so mass produced. The presentation, always in a English pint glass is a nice medium copper color with a a head that stays pretty much to the end of the pint. The aroma is quite average for the style and while it says Pale Ale it is not too strong. The mouth has fairly good body and the finsh is clearly hoppy with a slightly sour aftertaste. There are hoppier brew for those who wantb but you are pretty safe ordering a Bass no matter where you go."
"This was a decent beer. The first half of the beer was the best but as I drank more it seemed as though the taste got worse. I enjoyed the fist half as I said. You can taste hops but not much of them. I was expecting more for the pale ale. Lot of malt, actually the malt kind of tasted grainy in the second half. A decent brew, by no means a bad brew. I would definitely buy this when there is nothing else."
"I often drink a lot of Bass at pubs, restaurants, bars, etc. It's tasty, not overly expensive, and usually readily available. This was the first time I ever tried Bass in a bottle - and I must say, it's nowhere near as good. The bottled version seemed much lighter and cripser than the on-tap version, with much less of the flavor. A bitter, wheaty taste much of what I detected, but it, too, disappeared fairly quickly."
"This is a wonderful beer. Pours a real nice amber colour with a lovely smell. The ""nose", if I may be permitted to borrow a wine term, coupled with the dark, reddish appearance almost makes ones mouth water. Bass has a decent head which remains for some time, as well as a delicate lace. The taste is neither too weak, nor too powerful, but just right. Just a good tasting, easy to drink beer with a good, medium weight mouth feel. All of this being said, 4.5 is in order for ""drink ability", as I could drink this fine amber nectar all night long. Bass Ale is a truly excellent beer from the U.K."
"Had this on tap at the local pub. It pours a dark amber color with a moderate head that hangs around a little while. It leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma was mostly malts - I didn't notice much else. The taste is malty and sweet with a nutty-ness about it. Possibly some caramel in there too. This was a pretty enjoyable beer. Not too much character, but an enjoyable drink."
"12 oz. bottle. Labeled ""bottled and brewed by Interbrew ltd."" I guess the ""Budweiser"" of Europe will eventually own all of the major labels. The color of this beer is the color that comes to mind when one mentions ""english pale ale"" - a rich golden-amber with a fine white head. The aroma is a blend of caramel touched with a subtle woody hop smell. It has a crisp, fruity flavor in which is well balanced between malt and a medium level of hop bitterness. I think it is a bit underhopped, though. The mouthfeel is average for a beer of this alchohol level."
"I have to admit, I didn't like this beer as much as I thought I would. There's just a hint of an odd aftertaste to it. On the other hand, it has this wonderfully dark color, and pours out a fairly lovely head. A nice strong smell adds to the whole experience. It looks good, smells good, but I think there's something lacking from the end. A bit of a dissapointment, but maybe my hopes were set too high for this one."
"While not a world beater, this is well made and easy to drink beer and one that I would not turn down."
"I could drink a lot of these in hurry which is good (for me) and bad for my bank account..."
"Amber colored, fruity with a malty nose, this is still a nice English beer in the bottle. Drank it years ago on cask in the U.K. and the modern version has lost a bit of it's spunk. This bottled version still retains some of the qualities of old. It holds a nice head throughout(I drink vairly quickly) and it's slightly sweet taste is no problem to my taste buds. Highly drinkable stuff."
"rich amber in appearance thin white head... a bass is what i think about when i picture a glass of beer. almost toffeeish fruity smell to it. hint of something burnt maybe ""toasted' is a better word, but i don't think so. fruit comes out mid taste with some carmel butteriness hops to finish. a nice beer for all occasions, one of those beers you can find almost anywhere, that will satisfy."
"Notes: Not worth your time."
"Many compare their pale ales to this. This isn't groundbreaking anymore, but it still is a beer that is welcome in my fridge anytime. Very easy to drink (makes a great session beer). I think this is a good beer to start a ""macro-er"" conversion. This is would go great with red meat of any kind (especially steaks and prime rib)."
"This brew pours a light brown head of fine to medium sized white bubbles. It has a nice transparent golden brown body, a mild malty aroma, and leaves very little lacing. It has an initially bitter taste that quickly melds into a smooth slightly bitter hoppy malty finish. This brew has a little more character than some of my recent ratings. It is a nice all around drinkable brew."
"A Classic EPA that back in the day was a ""special occasion"" beer for me. Much better on tap than in the bottle, IMO. Nice clean taste, not too much hoppiness with a buttery feel. This is the beer I bring to parties when I don't want to share my stash. Always drinkable, I will never turn one of these down."
"A clean amber colored appearance with a light head and body. The malt used in this beer has a roasted quality.Caramelly flavor and also hoppy. Just enough bitterness at the end to keep this beer from being overly malty. Mouthfeel is good, and maybe a bit oily but smooth. This is a great session beer with low ABV and lots of character."
"The beer that made me want to know more beyond the borders of American macros. It has a quality taste that I still admire even after I have tried so many other beers now. Bass comes forth with a slick butteryness that is followed by some malty tones (caramel, buttterscotch). The finish is of slight hop bitterness that makes this beer very enjoyable and a true classic."
"Brown amber in color, not much of a head, but foam never disappeared completely. Malty odor, with a slight caramel scent. Nice, full mouthfeel. Taste starts off as a duel between caramely malt flavor and a mineral water taste (presumably the much-balyhooed Burton-on-Trent water), before finishing with a mildly hoppy aftertaste. I could probably put away a number of these. While not earthshattering, its not bad at all."
"Taste was somewhat sweet and lacking the bitterness at the finish. Carbonation kind of got in the way but I found this to be a very smooth beer missing the bitter aftertaste of some other bitters I've had in the past. No complaints here."
"Overall I will not buy bass, however if one is offered, I will not turn it down. Slightly above average beer."
"Pours a dark amber color with a nice white head, very good carbonation. The beer is very malty, and very sweet. Slightly too sweet at first, but as the beer warms the balance between hop and malt becomes better. There are some mild fruit flavors to the beer, but nothing overhwhelming. Definately a good beer for drinking while camping or during the summer on the porch."
"Light brown color with a medium head. Aroma is malty and slightly sweet. Nice smooth malt taste, good hop balance. Milder taste as typical of English Ales. Good flavor. Full round Mouthfeel. Smooth taste. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is dry and malty."
"Pours a medium white head with good lacing on the sides of my mug. Carbonation was observed rising to the top. Its body was amber. It had a somewhat fruity aroma to it. There was no bitterness noted. It had a nice flavor which I was surprised at. There was no aftertaste with this brew. Not a bad drink."
"Beautiful amber gold color with a thin white head that subsides quickly unless you pour it exactly right. Fine bubbles complement the hard water character which allow the smooth malt to blend with the noble hops. If you are used to light beers this one can be nicely hoppy but to most I.P.A. lovers the hops are mild at best. A wonderful brew in the classic english pale ale style that is best served not too cold. Good for summer days while reading on the hammock in the backyard."
"Even though I tried both guinness and bass tonight, I didn't get to try a black and tan. I had this beer in a 22oz. glass on tap. It pours a light brown color with about 1.5 fingers of head. There is a good amount of lacing on the glass. A bit of pine to the smell, and a little hops. The taste is also piney, with a little bit of fruit and a good hops finish. The mouthfeel is just a little light. The drinkability is pretty good. This is a great starter pale ale."
"I had this last night while the memory of the cask conditioned Bass that I had in England ws fresh in my mind. There was a big difference in the beers. The US version lacked a smoothness that was in the cask version. Also, the US version has somewhat of an indeterminate aftertaste that was not evident in the cask version. All in all, still a very good brew, put it is lacking compared to it's Big Brother!"
"An impressive coppery/amber colour, it was served with a medium sized head that disappeared shortly, but left a bit of lace down the glass during consumption. Brief note of malts on the nose before the hops took over, and the taste matched this. A decent session beer, I've always had a soft spot for it, but on tap if given the choice, I'd rather drink a good local micro. Otherwise I use this to fall back on, and it never does me wrong."
"This was one of the beers that really got me interested in the different tastes and varieties of beer, and for that reason alone will probably always be one of my favorites. It pours a nice coppery red/amber color, with a fluffy white head which slowly diminishes. This beer looks good and inviting. Slightly hoppy, floral nose. Tastes of hops (although fairly mild) and slightly metallic. The hops provide a nice tingle on the tongue. Smooth and fairly light, Bass is a pretty good beer with high availability."
"This is a good backup beer. Pretty available and consistently decent, but not exceptional. It tastes better to me out of the bottle than on tap. Pours a copper color, with an off-white head that I wish would stick around longer. Leaves good lacing though, which sticks to the glass and doesn't move. The malt smell comes through immediately, plus some hop, and a bit of pine and citrus. The taste is also malty, and has highlights of orange peel and pine. Mouthfeel is watery, but feels like it foams up at the back of the mouth. The lingering aftertaste has a metallic flavor though, which detracts from the other flavors, and makes it hard to have more."
"Of all the ""light"" classic ales, this is the one I like the best. Now, I know...it's not a great beer. But it is good and it is very refreshing. I see Bass as a good beer to end the night with...not heavy and lower alcohol."
"I KNOW Bass has to be better than this. But it wasn't."
"Ok, so it's my favorite beer. I've had some of the world's best, but Bass' flavor is second to none. The only complaint I have is that it is a little too watered down. If it was a little stronger, it would be too good to be true. Perfect color. Perfect ""roasted"" flavor, even if you have to concentrate on it. They say it's not the same beer Napoleon cherished, but so what, I love it to death."
"Copper in color. Fruit, biscuity grain and butterscoth aromas that worked quite nicely together. Flavor was that of diacetyl with a subdued sweetness and moderately strong biscuit. Moderate-light bitterness and a medium mouthfeel. Easily drinkable and a nice diversion."
"Very drinkable and a bar favorite, I told them to change the temp on that line, was far to cold. Kinda ruined it a bit compared to other times I've had it."
"Presented in a 1 pint, 3.25 oz. bottle. Bright amber in color with a creamy white head with pretty decent retension. Slight floral hop aroma, but overall not much smell at all. Soft malt flavors to start, balanced by the hops. For the most part the malt rules, and in my opinion it could use more hops. As a pale ale I am not impressed with this brew, as it lacks the crispness and the hoppy deliciousness. It is still an easy drinking beer with a light body and balanced flavor. I would recommend it, but not to someone who is looking for a pale ale."
"The taste first comes at you with a malty sweetness and quicky finishes with a minor hoppy bitterness. No lingering after taste, just a smooth tasting pale ale. Recomended."
"Off the pour we got a nice big head, white and fluffy. Sticks all over the glass. The beer is a nice looking amber color. Its got a nice sweet flavor to it, with a nice dose of hops. Seems like a pretty standard pale ale. If it was good enough for buffalo bill to take across the wild west as the bottle claims, then its good enough for me."
"Overall such a completely boring of a pale ale. How can a beer this old and apparently steeped in history be so uninspired. HAVE THEY EVER TASTED FULLERS LONDON PRIDE."
"Served on tap at a hotel bar, this was a pleasant diversion from lagers. Mid amber/light copper and mostly clear with a small head that dissipated quickly. The aroma was of a pungent caramel that was just a bit stale. The taste was of cream and caramel with a general sweetness. Little lacing. Without strong competition one might drink this through an evening and not decry the lagers lost. A sweet, flowery sense throughout. Acceptable if not impressive."
"I had pretty much sworn off Bass in the U.S., but was faced with little choice at a restaurant. Color me very surprised. Much better than I recall (and I used to drink a lot of it). Cask-condition this, and it could be a regular drink for me."
"An original Burton beer, but does it have what it once did? My draft pour into an absolutely clean, room-temp. pint glass resulted in a most tempting and alluring, crystal clear copper-amber sheen, with a bit of foam. The aroma for this pale ale is not a strong point. Its taste was pleasant with fine distinctive English ale attributes (slight esters and diacetyl, light hops, fruity...). Not a thin taste, yet remains rather ""delicate"" (something I've grown accustomed to?, or are memories of yester-years' more bold flavors deceptive?). Still a beer I often enjoy and one of my very first ""gateway"" beers!"
"Served a beautiful clear amber color with an off-white head. Light nose consisting mainly of malt. Smooth and medium-bodied mouthfeel with a touch of creaminess to it. Nice malty sweetness. Flavors consist of biscuit, caramel and just the right amount of hop bitterness in the finish. It had been awhile since I ordered a Bass and I'm glad that I did. Definitely seems more enjoyable on tap."
"This is a nice beer to drink ..not the best tasting..but good for friends."
"This draught came with a good head that lingered fairly long. It was a good copper color and very clear. The aroma was neutral. The flavor was also. I did not notice either a malt nor a hop predominance. The mouthfeel was fair. It was a good beer but I only drank one and switched to a stout."
"Nice clear amber color, it looks really pretty. The head is also nice white and thick. It smells quite sweet, nothing outstanding at all though, the taste is also sweetish with a little carameltaste. I can also sense a roasted sort of tone finished off in a bitter way. Certainly not one of my favorite beers... Should be served at 10-12°C."
"If this was packaged as macroswill at 3.99 a sixer that would be one thing. Instead, it's presented as a prestige beer, 7 or 8 bucks a sixer, and almost always an extra dollar a pint at the pub. Unacceptable. However, I should reserve complete condemnation until I have the opportunity to sample the Real deal from a cask in the UK."
"It's perfectly suitable for pallid palates, but get me to a HopDevil or Summit IPA instead!"
"If choices can be made, personally Ill stick with offerings from Great Lakes, Sierra Nevada, Bridgeport or the Pike Place Pub."
"Drinkability: Very good. A refreshing pale ale."
"Pours a clear copper body with a short foamy bone-white head that holds well and leaves nice lace. The aroma is nicely fruity, buttery, a touch metallic and slightly sulphury over a gently caramel maltiness. The body is medium with a fine and moderate carbonation that caresses and tingles the tongue before becoming lightly creamy. The flavor displays a rich caramel malt with a mild note of dried fruit against a bold, backing bitterness. It finishes with a rounding note of diacetyl and residual sweet caramel malt followed by some earthiness and sulphur alongside drying bitterness. Welll balanced with a good drinkability. Best enjoyed slightly warmed. Often overlooked because of the size of the brewery and its wide availability, this is an excellent, full flavored English pale ale that deserves more notice."
"Crystal clear amber brew forms a rocky white head sitting on top medium-sized bubbles. Head quickly thins, but forms a meringue peak which lingers until 1/4 way through the glass. Moderately-high carbonation, forming spirals of bubbles at a hypnotic rate. Aroma is of canned philadelphia mushrooms, toffee, almonds, sweet dog food, and margarine in that order. (Honestly!) What a perplexing smell. Flavor is of sweet malt with no apparent graininess, which fades to a strong metallic tinge, and ends in fizzy dirty dishwater that had caramel candies sitting in it. The fusel alcohols become more dominate in the start of the beer with progressive sips and really becomes unbearable by the end. This beer is intriguing for a few seconds, and looks pretty, but is absolutely horrible. Just a few sips gave me a nasty temporal headache, and I poured 1/2 of it down the sink. I never want to drink this beer again."
"Bass Pale Ale is one of those beers that while your are first entering the realm of beer tasting it is different and somewhat extraordinary, but after coming back to it I am pretty disappointed with the flavor. It pours a copper amber tone with a cream colored foam head. At first sniff it produced a mild nutty aroma along with some maltiness, but as the beer settled so did the scent. At first taste it was too cold to get any flavors from the beer, but after it warms it produces a sharp taste with a slightly bitter finish. Not anything to be crazy about, but I definitely think I would enjoy this one top more."

"With AB crap taking such a large share of worldwide production volume, Bud would have to be average (and thus get straight threes), in this context Bass Pale Ale would be a 4."
"This is the beer I'll usually grab if the pub doesn't have anything outstanding. Looks nice in the glass with a decent head. Average taste and smell. It really has a nice balance between malt and hops just not enough of either. Just slightly above average, but works in a pinch."
"Based on what this beer used to be, it's now truely disappointing."
"After two or three years without having a Bass ale, and finding myself in the position of choosing Bass or Bud, I chose Bass. The color was still that nice pale orange/red that I remembered from days past. The head was a pleasant off white that lingered around the glass for a short time. The aroma was malty with hints of floral notes. The taste was well balanced with the malt up front and the hops coming in the finish. My taste have evolved toward IPA's and ESB's in later life but it was nice to return to the beer that got me hooked on beer in the first place."
"Quite drinkable and tasty, but a little bit plain."
"From the tap it comes colored of a light bronze/copper. The head is white and very there, and it lasts a good time. Its lace clings to the sides of glass to the last drop. The aroma is of a sweet malt with a hint of caramel and some floral appeal. The taste is a combonation of a sweet malt/caramel with bittering hops and some faint floral. Good beer. Matches great as a black and tan."
" Two words Black/Tan!"
"Pours a medium golden color with a foamy white head and nice lacing. The aroma is dominated by a sweet maltiness with some floral notes as well. It has a very buttery taste and texture in the mouth and a bit of a nutty flavor. Its quite smooth and refreshing and is a very drinkable brew."
""
"I can't understand for the life of me why everyone wants to hate on the Bass Ale. If you want a good, dependable beer that goes great with almost any food, Bass is it. Sure, it doesn't necessarily blow you away with any complex flavors, or anything really complex at all for that matter, but I don't think that's what the brewers intended. A strong apple flavor is present in this beer, and to me tastes like a combination between apple cider and a typical lager or pilsner. You really can't go wrong with Bass."
"Pours to a nice orangish/amber color with a thich off-white head that lasts.  Forms a nice lace-work while sipped down.  Its nose is one of sweet malt.  The flavors taste of caramel malt, and fruity hops.  Overall, this beer is well balaced, and very drinkable."
"Got this on draught at Gameworks here in Columbus. The keg seemed a little flat, but otherwise it was pretty much the same as the kind you can get in the bottle. An all-around good, clean beer. Not too light and not too stout. A definite step up for a beginner in the beer tasting game. Not too exciting, but a good staple beer I am apt to get if there is nothing new and exciting available."
"Pours a copper color, with a beige frothy head, that settles into a thin sheer that leaves nice, wispy lace. Heavy malt aroma with some carmel and earthy hops.  Light to medium body, smooth but a little thin on the tounge. Toasted grain flavor with hints of caramel and butter. Finishes dry with a slight hop bite. Not bad at all for something easy to get."
"""May they burn in hades with their money as the fuel that feeds Satans furnace""."
"Shockingly, I’ve had a million of these beers, but have never reviewed it.  So I got a pint tonight.  Looks great, copper, and a great head.  Taste “not so much.”   Hard to describe, had a little malt/ a little hops, not bad, not good.  Right down the middle for a beer."
"This nice amber beer pours with a medium density head with good head retention.  It will leave a mild amount of lace on the glass.  The aromas are subtle with a hint of sweetness.  The taste is fairly clean, with not a lot going on.  It feels very good on the palate, and finshes fairly clean for an ale, with a bit of a lingering aftertatse.  This is much the way I remembered it from college:  a decent beer with an above average reputation.   Drink it in a black and tan."
"Amber in color with a frothy, rocky white head. Average retention. Nose is pretty quiet; some soft malty aromas. Crisp mouthfeel. Toasted malt flavors are the main feature, balanced by some hop bitterness in the middle on the way to a very abrupt finish. Unremarkable, but would probably make a decent stepping-stone brew for someone trying to make the jump to ""good"" beer."
"Decent head, orangish body, a little bit of hops, a little bit of malt, a easy drinking beer, nothing out of the ordinary, yet a solid beer, a good session beer.  I think it is also good as a standby at you local not so good bar."
"very clear deep amber, little head, good side cling.  mildly malty nose.  mouthfeel complex, seems light on the tongue but has a full body taste.  taste is malty but not too sweet, it is crisp but malty.  good balance."
"Amber in color with short-lived head.  The aroma malt, and some grainy sweetness.  The flavor was malt, with a slight hop presence that was not evident in the flavor.  Not an outstanding beer, but as others have pointed out, consistent and available at most bars."
"Getting home late last night to frozen pizza, I had to run to store 2-4 for beer. There it was, Bass. Bass never fails me. The taste is still satisifing, not ovepowering. I do not find it bitter at all.The first glass always goes down smooth. I usually buy two large singles, which go great with any meal. The narrow neck intrigues me. It harkens me back to my nautical expierences. I could live on Bass."
"Consistent indeed - with nearly 100 reviews, all the qualities of this excellent pale ale have been pointed out already. Great on tap, great bottled. Forget that Bass is now owned by Big Bad Interbrew, and just enjoy it!"
"Consistent.  This is a widely produced pale ale that still manages to satisfy me.  It isn't pushing the envelope, but it is still solid.  The color is great (reddish amber) as well as the smell (sweet - fruity?).  The smell and taste but are evidence of a good blend of flavors (hops malt - neither is obvious).  This is surely drinkable and for a beer that is found in most bars, it is pretty strong - a good fall back beer."
"Brewed by Bass Brewers Limited, Burton-on-trent, England"
"Bright, even amber tones topped with average head that persisted but didn't overwhelm.  Surprisingly fragrant (rather light and a bit fruity) for as even and tame as it tastes.  Taste is smooth and relatively uniform throughout, which goes hand in hand with its nice mouthfeel and drinkability.  This beer doesn't extend itself, but what it does, it does well."
"A very nice amber/gold/tan hue. A frothy, but unimposing non-lingering head, drains away faster than it should. Nice aroma, light coffee/cocoa/nut scent. A nice taste as far as Pale Ales go, not too distinctive one way or the other. Goes down well enough to have a second, but make a trip to the Titanic to recover some old Bass? No."
"This beer appears brownish red with gold highlights, like an overworked hairdo. There is a diverse head that quickly recedes leaving a few strands of lace. It smells like a jar of pennies. At this point I consider moving on to the next beer, but I stick with it. The taste is a bit of a suprise after the nose: good, full, dry beginning finishes somewhat quick (4 seconds) yet balanced. A dusty burned sugar flavor weaves throughout, offset by mild bittering hops. Simple, good."
"This is one of those dinner beers.  I really wasn't impressed with it enough to want to have more than one or two.  With that said, I did like the beer.  It pours darkish amber with a small head that disappeared... no lace.   The taste is hops up front, malt in the middle, and dryness at the end.  The dryness is what makes this a good beer to pair with red meat.  The nose was very mild with sweetness but mostly hops.  It does pack enough of a ""taste punch"" for any BA to like.  Id drink it again, at dinner."
"Update 2015: Almost 13 years later, I'm reviewing Bass Ale again. this time it is from a recently produced bottle made in the USA--William Bass & Co's Baldwinsville, NY to be exact. WTF? Anyway,it still has much of the iconic mineral bite of the English import. You have to appreciate modern brewing methods. Good job."
"Okay, I have had this beer on several occasions in the past, but finally had it again for a night out to dinner.  It poured a dark amber color with a small white head that faded quickly with no lace.  It had a slight aroma of malt and hops.  The flavor was of malt and hops and slightly sweet, but tough to figure out what.  The finish was dry and slightly bitter.  An alright beer, but not my first choice."
"While I like Bass, it is a bit too sweet for my liking. It is like a dessert beer to me. Nice Ale but not my first pick when at a bar. I like to call this the ""Yuppies Ale"". Nice brown color but has a bit of an aftertaste."
"Pours a caramel color with a 1 1/2 finger with head that dissipates fairly quickly.  The smell is that of a slight burnt malty sweetness.  Right off the bat, the creamy mouthfeel hits you first.  The taste contains a freshly cut hay flavor with shellack<--sp?) that just doesn't seem to grow on me. It's not terrible and in fact if the flavor went with the creamy mouthfeel, it could be much better.  Cheers."
"This Bass was much better than I remember of my other outings with it, I guess when draught it is significantly better.  Amber colour with a fairly creamy head.  The scent was based in earthy tones and a pretty hoppy.  I suppose the Nobles are at it again.  The brew has a meduim body with a pretty smooth feel about it.  It drank pretty good.  Nothing striking, but good.  I suggest that nobody should turn their nose at a tapped Bass."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce brown glass Euro-style long neck bottle, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"the beer itself is not terrible, but there is just a horrible aftertaste. it is however, much better out of the 220z bottle."
"I broke out some tasting notes from my trips to London and will post the reviews of those beers spaced over the next few days or so.  Bass from the cask is where it's at!  The bottled version we get here pales in comparison. Nice inviting copper color with nice head. My British pint glass was sheeted with lace. Cask conditioned smoothess, and drinkability are it's trademarks.  Man I miss London!"
"Bass itself while quite palatable on its own, is best consumed in unison w/ Guinness. Pours a brownish-orange color. Slight cirtus hop nose. On the palate light citrus hop, and caramel tones also. Very refreshing, I really like Bass a good fall back beer."
"I've had this beer before and I can't figure out why I haven't rated it. Anyway, in the past (in the bottles) it's been pretty bland. Not really malty enough to be a good pale ale like Samuel Smiths' and not enough good hop character to be a good IPA. This time I had it on tap and I could have sworn I caught some mild but definite estery flavors going on. It was much better this time around."
"When in an establishment with only the obvious choices of mass produced beer, this is always my old stand by.  Not one of the best brews in the world but certainly a very good beer.  It goes down very easy and can be had with any type food....my personal fav for kegs and eggs.  So if you are in a restaurant and don't have many choices and they have Bass then by all means go for it....................CHEERS"
"Easy drinking though"
"First time I've had this on it's own for years - usually it's part of a B&T. Still a good taste, hoppy & bitter, but not to the level that I've come to require in a pale ale. Hops, more hops!"
"Picked up a 6 pack on sale for $4.99.  I don't know that I would be whatever the full price is, but it was just about right at the price.  It's a pretty good easy drinker ... although not easy enough for my neighbor who didn't seem to take to it.  I found everything to be sort of muted in this brew compared to the finer versions.  The hops were mellow, the citrus notes were pretty easy-going.  The head topping the dark gold brew had a lot of staying power providing nice lace all the way down the glass.  The finish was pretty dry but with a bit of a lemon-y zing."
"Medium to full body with balance of medium bitterness. An unusual palate almost like a blend of banana, citrus, toasty grain, hoppy flavors. Nice hoppy finish."
"Nice appearance. Full thick head. Pleasant floral aroma. Creamy taste, with a malt sweetness. Somewhat chewey but flat tasting.  Goes good with a Guiness to make a Black and Tan."
"Amber body, big fluffy white head. Tiny bubbles rising. Good malty nose. Excellent balance of malt and hops in taste and aftertaste.  Mouthfeel has nice full, rounded sensation. The classic English Pale Ale retains far more of its character than its American and German lager cousins even at macro production levels.  Often available at pubs and restaurants with limited beer lists, its a good beer to have around for both advocates and the budmillercoors crowd."
"Top of the line at many chain restaurants and definitely better than most American macro offerings. DO NOT allow them to serve it in a frosted mug as you will be drinking what amounts to amber hop water. Bass Ale will be a much better beer if the malt end is allowed to show at proper serving temp. Also benefits from a cap of Guinness."
"This is a good fallback beer that can be found in many decent bars and restaurants.  We used to order a keg of Bass at almost every party we had at ASU and were never disappointed.  It's a nice amber color with a head that fades quickly.  Toffe/caramel flavors are noticeable but it's not overly sweet."
"First off, I have to admit I had long ago dismissed this beer as yet another macro with a British accent. When a friend handed me a bottle this weekend, though, I was reminded that this really is not a bad beer at all. Typical pale-ale amber color with a billowy white head. Slightly herbal hop aroma, a bit tangy, with a barely-perceptible malty sweetness. Starts with a tangy, almost metallic taste that gives way to a barely noticeable sweetness. Finish is pleasantly bitter. Overall, more balanced than I recall, and not a bad example of the style."
"A staple and or conversion beer for lots of people.  Amber color wih a rich head.  Sweet nose.  Hoppy bitter taste with a slight sourness.  I would like a little more on the malt side to increase the body.  Great lace on the glass."
"Thick, persistent, billowy off - white head.  Amber and very clear in color; there's no haze whatsoever. It's very appealing in appearance.  Fruity yeast esters in aroma, but the perfumey and grassy (perhaps Challenger?) hop nose provide for a complex, yet clean aroma profile. Mild diacetyl butterscotch becomes noticeable as the hop oils dissipate.  The carbonation is perfect and results in a very smooth mouthfeel.  The body is fairly light, but there are enough malt and hop flavors to make this quite a tasty British pale.  This brew is well balanced-- the crystal malt sweetness and residual sugars are well balanced by the moderate hop bitterness.  Bass finishes with slight biscuit malt flavors and a touch of sweetness. This pale ale is very clean and enjoyable all around.  It's more estery and fruity (and much less assertive hopwise) than the typical American pale, and is a fine example of an English pale ale. Highly quaffable."
"This is the first time that I've had Bass in several years.  I seem to remember it as being more complex and enjoyable.  The beer is very carbonated, slightly bitter, has virtually no sweetness, and no real aftertaste.  Pours to form a small white head that quickly dissipates.  Inoffensive and common."
"OK...I am altering my entire review based on this one bottle. I used to hate this stuff more than anything, and even after I had some more advanced taste buds, I still couldnt handle the aftertaste of Bass. However, this one isn't terrible. It's drinkable. I am almost embarrassed that I am drinking this after all the Bass-bashing I have done over the years. But I do this to myself every now and then, I get a bottle of Bass to see if I can handle it. This is the first time I can. I dont really feel like commenting much on the beer, as this is a very awkward moment for me. Its appearance is nice, always has been. Citrusy hoppy aroma. Somewhat metallic aftertaste still, but tolerable. This is very awkward. I dont know if I will be able to sleep tonight."

"I think a bottle of bass, is an old reliable beer. I will always order it at retaurant or pub where the only other choices are buds, millers, coors, etc. Nice inviting brown color, head quickly disappears but always tastes great. Compliments many meals, and I find it always refreshing. I try to keep some always in my supply at home, but last night drank my last one. Always will be a winner to me."
"dark amber in color, a moderate head that quickly subsides to almost nothing.   smell is of sweet malts...sort of candy like...perhaps butterscotch?   medium body with the sweet malts dominating the soft hops.  anybody that slams this ale is stupid.  there is a reason why Bass is perfect in black and tans with Guiness or any other dry stout.  i can detect the uniqueness of the water used, which imparts a delightful dance on palate along with the hops.  this is a difficult ale to review...there is a lot going on here.  there must be some reason why Bass is a world renowned english ale.  a classic."
"I am a big fan of Bass Ale.  This was one of the beers that introduced me to the world of brew outside of U.S. macros.  It was my breakout brew.  This beer pours to a nice light amber color, has a slight metallic (in a good way) taste, and has a nice hop presence on the finish.  A quality fall-back beer for me.  Many times, this is the best beer available in the bar."
"Amber in color and a decent head. Out of the tap is the best. One of the great session beers for me.It's even better with Guinness."
"Medium amber color, medium sized head.  Crisp, light smell only of hops; the taste is mostly the same, you feel it on the back of your throat and sides of your tongue, with a little nuttiness going on.  Could use some more character, but very drinkable."
"Not good, another one of these English ales which gets a huge wrap, but it is quite overrated, don't like it."
"Of the widely distributed, world wide beers, this is one of the best. Deep reddish-amber color, slightly creamy mouthfeel. Has a slight fruity character, but not overly so which balances nicely with the malt and hops. I slight toasty flavor (toasted grains/malt) is also prevalent but has a small say. The hops are there, but not overpowering by any means (which appeals to me). All flavors seem to be in perfect balance with one another. This beer is complex, not as complex as many, but has more then enough complexity to keep you taste buds interested. A great drinking beer, tough to have just one, and one of my standbys."
"On occasion, I will have a Bass if nothing else is available or I am just not going to have a Sam Adams Lager.  I find Bass a very drinkable mass-produced beer.  Always has a nice color with faint bitterness and a moderate malty grain flavor.  It is very average compared to most good beers, but I find it acceptable, espcially if it is not my main focus of the evening."
"Better on tap, but a solid choice.  This beer isn't going to overwhelm you with any one quality, but you buy it because you know what you are getting."
"While this is the ""standard"" for Pale Ale, I think it has become more mainstream (Bud like) over the years.  I can remember how wonderful this was 15 to 20 years ago, maybe my tastes have changed, it just doesn't seem the same.  This is a very drinkable beer, but there is so much better and made right here in the good old USA."
"Bottom line, this is good beer. Not great but good. Are there better beers out there...of course. In terms of mass produced beer (so is Guinness), it'll do better than many others in a pinch."
"Good bang for your buck, but don't expect anything spectacular."
"An essential component for a classic black & tan."
"Notes: I must admit that I never order this beer, however it is truly a classic and a prime example of a traditional English Pale Ale. Nothing outrageously outstanding mind you, but all the same enjoyable. You'll see this beer cloned all over the beer shelves and in brewpubs, which says enough in itself. Around 4.4%abv."
