"3 O - ends up being pretty pedestrian after the cascading nitro pour and the pleasant aroma. A bit of a disappointment in that regard, but I hadn't expected it to be fantastic in the long run to begin with. I'll pass on trying this again."

"Overall, a deliciously refreshing beer that certainly never overwhelms the palate, with just subtle hints of hops and a heavenly bitter after taste for company. Not a beer for a good night of darting."

"Overall a big letdown, not the nice U.K. bitter I was hoping for. Seems like a light beer to begin wtih, then just gets so destroyed by the nitro. It's sad that this is even a thing!"

"It's OK and I can see why it's so popular with some."

"O: The nitrogen helps to improve the mouthfeel of this beer, but it doesn't seem as smooth compared to other beers available in nitro-cans. It is very easy to drink."
"O: Not quite as smooth as some of the other nitro-can beers that I have experienced. Easy to drink and with such a low ABV, definitely sessionable."
"PLEASE BRING TO THE US MARKET!"

""

"This will always be a better alternative to the mass produced yellow beers here in the US, so this is definitely a nice summer type quaffer."

"Overall, it's a perfectly drinkable English ale, while not being a particularly exciting one. I do love the effect the nitro gives it, and if that just makes me a sucker for a gimmick, then I guess I'm a sucker."

"Did not score A, T, S, M at that time; disregard those scores"

"Final Thoughts: John Smith's Extra Smooth proves that a low ABV beer can pack in some flavor and be enjoyable. Would like to see more brewers pushing below the 4% ABV mark and making true ""session beers."" Would I drink it again? Yes."
"Overall, this is one that you can drink gallons of in the pub. The nitro helps a ton. Ok brew."
"Overall- Goes down easy. Comforting feel and taste. Somewhat heavy but it just adds some character."
""
"I could see starting a Great Britain beer tasting with this ale, it certainly would not alter your taste perception of what ever bitter or pale ale that comes next."
""

"I'm afraid for even those who don't drink beer, the blatant non-offensive qualities of this may seem a tad dull. But boy does it refresh!"

"I note that I ignore the can's instructions to ""serve cold"" and serve at proper British ale temp."
"Pours a clear orange-brown with a foamy bone colored head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt and a slight caramel aroma. Taste is much the same but is very mild and lacking. This beer has a low level of carbonation with an almost flat mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty poor beer that is not very tasty in my opinion."
""
"Around my expectations, and that's not bad. A true session ale to be had in the US."
"Overall, an average nitro English bitter. Not on the same level as Old Speckled Hen or Tetley's but better than Boddington's. At $7.99 a 4 pack, the price is alright and I can see myself picking this up again."
""
"Every other nitro'ed English pale/bitter/cream ale/what-have-you I've had has been at least decent, so this guy's gonna haveta be tried, thinketh I. It pours a clear sunrise bronze topped by a finger or so of creamy off-white foam. The nose comprises barley, light greens, and a touch of biscuit. The taste brings in more of the same, with a touch more biscuit, a drop of honey, and a twinge of spicy greens. The body is a light medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a silky smooth feel. Overall, a nice little English ale, something I wouldn't necessarily stock all the time, but something I would never mind partaking in."
""
"The body was typically good for the style, full, rich and smooth. Drinkability was good, smooth and easy. Overall, a nice, but not notable, take on the style. Worth grabbing if you're in the mood for a nice (almost) pint of bitters."
""
""
"Overall: very nice English ale, I would love to try it on tap. Malts, fruit and light bitterness, quite flavoursome for an English Mild. Only way I would have it is if it was on sale though - AU$80 a case (2012) is way too much."
"The color is darker than expected. The aroma is weak but nice. It keeps producing lace. Overall, it is as expected - a nice English ale. From England, go figure."
"Served from nitro-can into a Duck-Rabbit nonic. Poured yellow-orange with a one finger off-white head that subsided to half a finger very slowly. The pour really reminded me of a Guinness with the head consuming the entire beer and working its way up slowly to form the final head. Nice. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, cream, grain, and wheat. The flavor was of sweet malt, cream, grain, earth, and subtle spice. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation (almost velvety). Overall this was a pretty average brew. I have to say the pour on this one was pretty cool as it looked like a Guinness only it was a Pale Ale! However, that is where the fun stopped on this one. There was really not a whole lot going on in this one which really made it a bit of a buzzkill for me. Very light on all aspects so good for the non-robust beer drinkers out there, but if you like loads of flavor and complexity. Avoid this one. Trust me, you will thank me if you have the option."

"A thanks to woodychandler for keeping me up to date in the world of canned beers. Poured from a 14.9 oz. nitro can. Has a brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is a bit on the malty side. Taste is malts, a touch of nuts, just a bit of hops, like it's advertised, very smooth. Feels creamy in the mouth and overall is a good session beer."
""
"Very smooth and creamy serve best room temp or take out of the refrigerator for 10 mins before serving one of UK finest bitters hard to find in USA but some liquor stores in MN are now carrying my favorite bitter .If you enjoy Boddingtons try John Smiths extra smooth !"
""
""
"Overall: not a bad beer at all. I feel like this is a session ale I could quaff all day."
"O - This is pretty good. I had never heard of it, but it's pretty tasty."
"A nitro-CAN from Pinocchio's on Friday gets us out of the gate and the Crack released a buncha gas while the Glug caused a cascading action that resulted in a finger of dense, light-tan head. Color was a deep copper/brownish hue with NE-quality clarity. BUPGOO! Nose was quite malty, very biscuit-like. Mouthfeel was full and creamy as the result of the widget and the taste was only moderately bitter. It had a pleasant biscuit maltiness up front, followed by a light bitterness before the swallow. Finish was semi-dry and quite pleasant. This would be an excellent CANdidate for a session beer, especially at the beach."
"But as a beer geek speaking, I'd love to see some more traditional English bitters in my area that have a lot stronger character than this. This definitely doesn't seem like a good representation of what the style can truly be."
"O: Overall the nitro-widget enchances the smooth creamy body, has some sility maltiness, and low bitterness levels. Nice beginning though the flavor tends to lean and thin out deeper into the drink. Don't know if i could tackle two in one sitting. Great visual but dives downhill from there."
"O: Great with a Bath Pasty from the sandwich shop 'round the corner (braised beef, potatoes and onions). I see why this is so popular in stores."
"Notes: It's sessionable and overall not too shaby of a brew. Cheers."
""

"From the widget can stamped: 31-05-X-L147-10:03. Sampled on July 13, 2012. The pour is agitated by the widget explosion with a medium copper amber tone and a soft, silky, foamy head. The aroma is rather bland with little to talk about but bread and grains. The body is smooth and medium. It tastes better than I thought it might given the aroma with an upfront sweet malt character followed by a moderate bitterness. This probably would be a pretty good pub beer."
""
"Body is just a shade below medium; carbonation is smooth and reserved. As I worked my way through the glass the watery nature of the beer became tiresome. Worth a try if you like nitro English bitters but doesn't stand out from its competitors in any particulalry favorable way; a small step below something like Tetley's."
"O: How in the hell did I miss this one for so long? This is an exceptional English Bitter. I love the nitro-can presentation, and everything about this comes together to create one of the better session beers I've had. I will most certainly be returning to this. A word to my degenerate friends: you'll be seeing this at future house parties."

"o: not particularly complex, nothing amazing, but I find myself coming to this beer and Boddington's Pub Ale occasionally simply for its simplicity. more complexity than a standard lager."
"I recently read that this the top selling bitter in the U.K. so I figured I would give it a try.Poured from the nitro can a clear deep copper color with that one finger creamy cascading head.A little toastiness and light metallic notes in the nose,it will not blow ya away but it's not designed to.toasted bready malts are the main component on the palate with a mild mineral note.I can see why this is a big seller it's low in alcohol and has some decent subtle flavors,good for what it is no doubt."
"O: A completely forgettable, mass-produced beer. Not very drinkable."
""
""
""
""
"O- its okay, but its pretty bland. i could have a couple if i was after something a little lower alcohol but i would get over it very quickly."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: An easy-to-drink beer that is not overly complex which (for me) is a nice change of pace. Nothing too memorable about this, but just a hint above average."
"Thanks Casey!"
"A bland, mass-produced bitter. The mouthfeel is lovely, but it lacks aroma, flavour - and character. Could almost pass for lightly sweetened water. Why drink this when there are so many great beers out there?"
"O- This is a satisfactory beer. It fails at providing anything new or exciting to the world of beer, but stylistically, it works. I probably won't actively seek this out anytime soon but if I was offered this by someone, I wouldn't pass it up. Hey, there are far, far worse offerings out there- Carlton Cold is a prime example."
"One big problem, not much flavour and a VERY watery body. Not even any alcohol make the wateriness more enjoyable because the alcohol content is so low. So, it was like creamy, mildly beery water. If that's what you want, go for it. Otherwise, don't expect anything more exciting than that from this beer."
"O: Easy Drinker, good session beer. very common in most pubs I have been to in England. Nothing fancy just a good everyday beer."
"Cheers!"

"Overall, a pleasant, fairly simple beer. Does not get the heart pumping or the taste buds dancing, but if you are looking for something easy going, low in alcohol, and simple, you could do much worse."
"Question - why on earth do they say serve cold on the can?"
"M - The clue is in the name, very smooth on your tounge as someone has previously reviewed like Guinness very nice."
"Overall - To be honest, a pretty average beer taste-wise, but one I have a real soft spot for. I'll keep picking them up on occasion at the bottlo as they really take me back (more than a few years) to hazy memories of Friday night pub crawls in the York winter with Uncle Steve and the boys."
"Dr: Cheap in Glasgow, but still shite compared to other offerings."
"A nice, mild, easy drinking ale with decent flavour. A good beer."
"Well, it has a widget. Certainly not as good as Boddingtons. Color is a nice orange to amber and it pours an interesting head. It laces and sticks to the pint glass, but the taste is rather bland. Some malts, but not much else. Mouthfeel is creamy and medium bodied. Drinkability is below average. At least I only got one pint of it."
"However, when in London...."
"I did expect that though when I heard that hiss and saw the cascading effect that this beer would be very watery, but at the same time very drinkable, I also think this would be a very good light beer for those who enjoy Guinness, but have a hard time dealing with it's darker nature."
"Very light, accsessible and refreshing"
"Copper color. Creamy and smooth with a body that will in the same direction. A taste of rye bread in the mouth surrounded by a creamy rich lather and a rather discrete hops. A quasi-imaginary carbonation as extra smooth but not really exciting. The finish is bitter but without being excessive for a beer style bitters."
"A decent nitro beer. Much better than most the other similar nitro beers. Not something I would recommend over anything else, but you could do worse."
"Notes: Decent beer for something smooth and easy to drink, especially at places with limited selection (in the UK at least)."
"D: High. Light taste and ABV. Traditional British style."
"overall, not a very drinkable beer, pretty offensive, not highly, but decently so."
"D: moderate 4.0 ABV makes it definitely drinkable."
"Drinkablity: A tasty ale that is extremely portable in the can. It produces a consistently good pour unlike some pubs. Great session brew."
"Overall a sturdy drink that is very cheap, and is a good day to day beer."
"What can I say? Nitro appearance is very hard to beat. A ruddy ale hazed with ultrafine bubbles, which cascade upward into a spotless porcelain head. Great sticking and retention. Caramel corn, toffee, sweet tea, and even some rose wine and strawberries crop up in the nose, with just a light dusting of hops to provide a veneer of leafy resin. Mild in flavor, but well-rounded, and it stands up to overchilling (as it is usually served), with a light, woody base, hollow caramel malts, And a paper-thin layer of leafy hops. Easy drinking with a mouthfeel that actually does approximate proper real ale, but the flavor doesn't exactly leave me wanting more. Nonetheless it is a nice thirst-slaker and I'd certainly be happy to have it again, especially in situations like this, where all the other beers are boring pale lagers."
"Mouthfeel is Guinness like, creamy but a bit watery."
"A clear bronze colour with a thick creamy head that lasted to the last drop. Aroma was not strong but slightly bready and malty. Taste was the same with good malt offset by a clean bitterness. The very low, fine carbonation was typical and gave this a smooth mouthfeel which contributed to a good drinkability score. I'm sure the Brits have many better and more complex bitters available but this one was pleasant without being outstanding. If it were cheaper in Oz, I'd give it a constant workout."
"To improve: The aroma was pretty average. The beer is already gone :("
"It IS very smooth, maybe a bit too smooth, to the point of being watery. Just doesn't have much body to it. Definitely an enjoyable flavour though, and this is definitely a beer of which you could throw a few back with the lads. And that's what it comes down to in the end."
"The head is very dense and creamy, and the body is pretty thin with a low, soft carbonation. Pretty standard for an EPA."
"Overall a certainly smooth ale that lacks any real depth of flavor."
"I was going to give it higher scores, but it is rather dull. It's just a creamy, easy drinking pub ale."
"John Smith's does the job. One of those beers you can find in pubs where there isnt real ale and this is always good to go. Nice and smooth and this is the more creamy version. Can be a slightly wooden taste at times but that is alright. Nothing too bad about this one, solid beer."
"Drinkability: It's a shame I can't get this great English session Ale here in the states. Actually, it's probably best I can't get it here because I would probably drink this beer on a daily basis. If you're ever in England looking for a creamy lightly bitter nitro canned beer, then you should pick this one up. Just make sure you pour it into a glass because you don't want to miss the show."
"This is a quick quaffing beeer at best and not recommended by me"
"Definitely well drinkable."
"D - 2.5 - If this beer had a little more taste to it I would love it. As it stands, it's like drinking water with a beer appearance."
"d: Would be a good session ale"
"typically do English beers I still do appreciate their smoothness and drinkability."
"D: Good beer to have while sitting in a pub, and you will definitly want a few."
"Like all nitro beers this brew looks really good. A khaki-ish colour cascading effects leaves a creamy off white head and a dark copper body. The head leaves quite a bit of lacing and stays for the entire time. Im not sure what to make of the smell. It's very malty and, leaving me not quite sure if i like it. It remided very much of the smell of malt extract. At first the taste is almost non-existant. I really couldnt pick out much from it. There were some flavours there, just extremely milld. However, as the beer warmed there was a slight malt sweetness that was failry enjoyable, but still on the minimal side. Mouthfeel was really good though, very smooth, very creamy and just really enjoyable all round. Honestly, drinkability could be a 5 on this if there was just a little more flavour. The 'extra smooth' is no lie, i just wish there was a little more flavour to go with the smoothness."
"John Smith's Extra Smooth Bitter is the famous British beer with the No Nonsense attitude. It was launched in 1995 alongside John Smith's Bitter, and has become the UK's No 1 ale. Brewed at the famous John Smith's Brewery in Tadcaster since 1847, John Smith's is supported by a high profile marketing campaign led by ""No Nonsense Man"". TV, poster and in outlet advertising have driven John Smith's Extra Smooth to its position as a clear market leader and Top Five beer brand."
"M&D are probably this beers selling point. It was slightly watery, but very silky in the mouth. There was no carbonation, however, this just added to its blandness. Definitely drinkable, if only because there is so little taste or smell to offend you, unless you actually are offended by a lack of taste and smell. A lacklustre offering indeed, don't bother dirtying a glass to drink this one."
"This is a copper colored brew that poured a creamy white head leaving a nice lacing. Nose was kind of malty and wheaty and really not much more than that. Taste had a hint of apple with a bitter hop finish. This was a thin bodied beer, flat, with the saving grace being the smooth finish. This is sessionable at 4.0 abv, but not a very good beer by no stretch."
"Pours a clear dark copper under a very creamy 1/2 finger eggshell white head that lasts forever and generates some nice sheets of lace. The nose is mild, but appropriate for the style, with a note of hops along with smooth malt. The mouth is lightly carbonated and light in weight, although the bit of head that comes with every sip adds a cottony softness to the liquid. The taste is mild and smooth, with a bit of metallic astringency to go with the dark bread malt. Reminds me of my days in Oxford - no complaints."
"The smell on this one is pretty appealing, but the taste could use some real work. It's a bit flat and lacks real flavor. Along those lines, the mouthfeel suffers from being too thin."
"737"
"either way, this is fairly drinkable. nothing thats going to knock your socks off, but thats probably not what the expectation is from this beer."
"Not a bad ale, but has been mass produced now, a fair ale"
"On tap in England. Very good beer and is also considered a bitter. Not bitter at all. Golden yellow with a fluffly white head that dissapates fairly quickly. It tastes a little bit watered down. Good maltiness, smooth and crisp, very drinkable, but this bitter isn't as good as other ones."
"On draught at the original Hard Rock Cafe in London of all places. Pours a dark amber color with a thin light beige head. Thin lacing. Mellow malt aroma. Very smooth drinking, with flavors of malt, brown sugar, sweet fruit and hops. The finish is lightly bitter but does not last very long. Decent overall, but could be better."
"The taste is also on the delicate side. On the other hand: Its a smooth, it should be mild! However, there is a burned tone with hints of caramel, thick cream and a passing bitterness. The aftertaste is very gentle with some hints of rye bread and (somewhere in the background) mild hops."
"considering the price, get a double diamond or something. dont bother with this, its a nasty peice of work all over."
"Pours a deep golden colour topped by a head that starts of thick and large and after a minute settles to minimum. Aroma consists of citrus and honey hints. Citrus flavour and very moderate hop hints. Mouthfeel is very watery and this has the result of this beer being VERY drinkable. Great brew"
"Freshly tapped in an old 1600s pub, The Nags Head in Bristol, England, so the setting may introduce some favorable bias. The Extra Smooth Bitter is dull Tan/Amber in color. The somewhat thin body gives way to the plentiful tea-like hops, which are especially noticed in the back of the throat. This ale changes complexion half way through revealing a woody character and some sweet and citrus flavors, while mellowing out even further. The foamy white head doesn't last very long."
"Dark reddish color with a nice creamy head. Not much of a smell, maybe a little bready though... I find it really hard to define the taste, it's a bit like the smell, bready and with a slight roasted tone finished of in a bitter way. Should be served at 10-12°C."
"Golden slightly amber color. Thick rich one inch beige head. Smooth rich malty taste with a slight dry hoppy finish. Not a huge nose but there is some malt sweetness. Fuller cream mouth. A starter pint for yourself in a London Hotel!"
"This is the type of beer i hate, creamy cat piss, gotta say i hate the nitro tap thingy. Way too creamy and no flavour to boot. Very sweet aswell, pretty crappy if you ask me."
"Deep gold color. Dense tan head. Light bread with a trace amount of honey in the aroma. Light biscuit flavor with barely any detectable hop flavor. Thin, watery mouthfeel. I suppose at 4.0% abv, a session beer is what Scottish Courage was shooting for, and if so, I guess they've met their goal. There just isn't enough substance here for my taste. IMHO, this is a sub-ordinary bitter."
