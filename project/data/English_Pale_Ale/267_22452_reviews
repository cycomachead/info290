"Overall a fine beer that has enough flavor to be interesting while not being to overwhelming to preclude it from being sessionable."
""
""
""
""
""
"First sight, this beer has an awesome creamy head. Perfect ale chill haze. Color bordering on Amber. A little rough over the palate. Tons of hop aroma with out the a hop punch in the mouth. Overall this is a great pale ale."
""
""
"This beer got me into Odell. A great example of an English-style pale ale."
""
""
""
"No real smell or taste, too blah for me."
"Too bland of a taste for me"
""
"I enjoyed the abundant fresh hops character of this brew - it is highly aromatic. However, the palate was a bit dry for my taste, lacking a solid malt backbone to stand up to the hops. My reference for this sort of style is the Anchor Liberty, one of my favorite beers. The Odell 5 Barrel is still very enjoyable, though."
""
"One of my favorite pale ales and the best English style that I can recall.  Well done Doug Odell!"
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a hazy, Amber ale. Ms all white head...average appearance. My he smell is soft,mbalanced between spicy hops and sweetish smelling malt.  Some citrus notes. Tasty.  The finish is long and slightly bitter, refreshing and drinkable."
""
"O: Solid brew, quite drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Great beer with the hops coming through subtly."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a crystal clear, gold coloring, with a steady flow of carbonation, and a tall, fluffy, clingy, off-white head. Nose of bitter and spicy hops, subtle citrus notes, and piney highlights. Flavors are smooth caramel sweetness, tropical fruit sweetness, bitter greens, and resinous hops notes. Smooth, light bodied, with a subtle resin and tropical fruit aftertaste. Smooth, slick finish. This is a tremendously easy drinker."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Aroma has citrus and pine, with a bit of bready malt. Pours amber-orange with a decent off white foam head, with good retention and lacing. Taste is where this one lets down. Some hop bitterness leads the way along with muted citrus. Floral hops. Nothing too strong. Light bodied and thin. Overall not Odell’s best attempt, but not horrible."

"A fairly straight-ahead, dry, hoppy, sort of hybrid English-American Pale Ale, 'nuff said!  Ok, it's easy to drink while watching the Broncos score again, if a tad unbalanced (just like the NFL!)"
""

""
"This is a hoppy pale ale, and it goes great with barbecue.  5 Barrel is a modified recipe from their older pale ale, and it seems to have been a successful tweak.  It's light but not too light, thanks to the hops.  There are just a wee bit too much of them for my taste, but I don't like hoppy, IPA-type beers very much, so there you go.  Still worth a shot in the summer out on the patio.  I prefer other Odell beers more, but I like everything they put out, so it's not like I wouldn't drink this if given the opportunity."

"Light brown to amber in color with a bit of haziness. An inch thick rocky white head is present. Aroma of piney hops dominates and light malt is faint. The piney hops are also at the front of the palate. I also get some light grains but they struggle to make their presence known throughout even the fade. This beer is dry and crisp. It just seems more like an IPA."
"Overall, really enjoyed this beer. Would love to have it again. may have to pick up a growler."

"Would probably have again; worth trying if you're curious."
""
""
""
"Flavor: kind of an odd combination. The floral hops are dominate with some citrus hop bitterness in the finish. The malt flavor is mild and this beer seems to need some more balance between the malt and hops."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A beer for all year round. I feel it would go down great with a summer BBQ"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is just a solid flagship beer for a pretty awesome brewery. Nothing groundbreaking as far as an English pale goes, but still nothing wrong with this beer."
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is pretty good, a light medium with a nice balance. Good sweetness with only a touch of bitterness blended in with medium carbonation level. Buttery/oily feel that has a spicy dry finish. Really nice drinkable anytime brew. Safe beer to have lying around for anyone. Thanks Geoff for sending it!"

"O- A fine pale ale no doubt. Goes down with ease. Nothing about it screams world class, but one that is certainly enjoyable."
"Overall - This is a good beer. Actually its great. I wasn't expecting much from it, but I honestly can say that I would probably opt for this one over stones pale ale (which I had before this) The hop bitterness comes through just enough to be enjoyable but doesn't take away from the other flavors offered in this brew. Where it lacks in the smell department, it makes up for in the taste and mouth department. I also quite like the bottle, nicely designed and a quality label. Go ahead and pick up a couple of these and you won't regret it."

"Nice example of a English pale ale."
"i truely enjoyed the very full hop taste.it seemed to have a bit of citrus which add to the experience. Avery good beer in my opinion, but I have just recently started drinking ipa's so this review is my first . First of many i hope. I hope you all dont rip me up to much with this. Not much of a writer, still working on it."

"Pretty nice. Nothing super exciting, but a nice basic English Pale Ale that I'd definitely reach for on a hot summer day, and could easily drink a few."
""

""
""
""
""
"Overall: Probably my least favorite brew from Odell, but it is still a well-rounded pale ale."
""
""
"Overall- A very, very nice everyday pale. Complex enough to make it interesting, light and clean enough to have with pasta for dinner. Recommended."

"A very good beer for my first try at O’Dell’s. Good thing I have a few more in my hotel bathroom sink."

"O-In the past, I was never a huge Odell fan, but recently, their beers have impressed me. Five Barrel is no exception. The citrusy, spicy notes play well with the biscuity malts here, just like they are supposed to. Is this beer a world-beater? No, but it is widely available around here (even at crappy chain restaurants), and I would happily drink this when other options do not exist."
"Overall, a pretty good exploration of hops in this. A lot to like about it."
""
"Overall, this was an enjoyable and easy drinking pale ale. Nothing too exciting or unique but a superbly well-balanced and refreshing beer with a pleasant aroma and flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
"Odell doesn't make a bad beer. Find me an Odell beer that isn't great, and I will drink it! Hopefully, when we start writing our book, we will be able to visit Odell and see things from inside the facility. If nothing else, we will go, tour the brewery, and just drink their beer!"
""
""
"Moderately hopped for the style a just a great looking beer. Aroma didn't really wow me. I enjoyed this and would drink again."
""
""
""

"This poured out as a nice clear orange color with a white head on top. The head leaves a great lacing on the glass and a thin retention over the beer. The smell of the beer has a mild hop and malt aroma that seems well balanced. The taste is much like the nose, it's got a nice maltiness as well have a hoppy bitterness. The flavors are good across the board on this beer. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a nice carbonation to it, very drinkable. Overall it's a good brew, very sessionable."
""
""
"Overall a real straight forward solid Odell creation, great stuff."
""
"O – Solid representation of the style, a nice balanced hoppiness to it. Could drink this one all day long."

"Beer is medium bodied, with medium levels of carbonation that foam the beer slightly across the palate. The result is a generally smooth, easy-drinking pale ale that finishes quite dry and astringent."
"Pours a murky, rust orange, with low head slight lacing. Smells like an ale, bready, yeasty with some low, deep notes of hops. Taste is similar to the nose: competent, bready, with some lingering bitterness, but mostly straight ahead ale. Carbonation is moderate, but tame, and not at all assertive. This is nothing as amazing as their signature IPA, and while well crafted, is just good, and not 'repeater' good, if you know what I mean."
"A nice beer and one that was quite enjoyable despite not being as good as I had been hoping. Less hops and more malt than I was expecting and a little flat towards the end but still an acceptable effort from the brewery."
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is pine hops, with plenty of body and a heavy malt presence to balance it all out. Overall, this is a remarkably well-balanced session pale ale, with a superlative taste and nice body. Better than many IPAs!"
""
""

""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: Odell Brewing does it again; their 5 Barrel Pale Ale rings true to the style while offering a taste and feel that makes it unique. This is one of the smoothest APAs I've had and definitely worth seeking out. I could see this beer being enjoyed by curious macro-drinkers and it even pleases a hop head like myself."

"M - Crisp and light on the palate with some balanced minerality; finishes very dry"
"The more I drank this beer, the more I liked it. The flavor profile has enough going to on to keep the drinker interested, yet things never seem to quite gel perfectly. I would get this again at a bar or in a variety pack, but probably wouldn't seek out a six of it."
""
""
"Overall - It's rich, flavorful and easy to drink and I could drink this all day! Let's hope this is available where I'm moving!"
""
""
""
""
""
"12 oz bottle pours a cloudy medium amber with good head and acceptable lacing. Aroma is very heavy on the bready malt, with some sharp citrus hops. Taste has a decent hop profile, but dominated by the bready malt. Mouthfeel seems a little limp, but nice dry finish. Seems like this would be a great session beer on tap at an English Pub, but as a standalone taste test out of the bottle it's a little blah..."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Pretty descent pale ale, though I feel it leans more towards an American PA as opposed to a British one. The hops just seem a bit to overpowering to be a British PA IMO."
""
"Wish I had a few more to put down. Very nice malty pale ale here."
"4, 3, 3, 4.5, 4"
""
""
"Overall: Not bad, just nothing special."
"This pours a murky amber-golden tan, like a crusty bread that’s been toasted. There’s a light hop aroma and a malt sweetness rounding out the nose. Flavor is more malt than hop, with just a tiny hop bite at the end, and more on the sweet side of things."
"Overall: This is a solid beer. I did very much enjoy having it. I would share this one with people new to the craft beer world of flavors, it will not overwhelm them."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours a brassy orange with about a finger and a half of off white head. Head recedes quickly but leaves some thick lacing and a nice cap. Nose is a bit faint, bready malts and faint hop aromas. Taste is nicely subtle, excellent balance between bready, earthy malts and herbal hops. Nice and even throughout. Medium bodied with a crisp but slightly sticky finish. Easy drinking too, could throw a few of these back easily. A solid brew that scratched that ""lighter but tasty"" itch I had."

"overall this is well balanced and is one i will consider for when i am craving something citrusy"

"O. Overall, a slightly less hoppy pale ale. Still, very tasty, and as others have said, this would be a great for a session brew."
""
"A well done drink, great as a session brew."
"Pours copper with a nice off white head. Aroma is floral, biscuity, a touch of herbs and some citrus rind. Taste follows suit. A creamy, active medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, a decent and very easy drinking pale ale. Quite sessionable. Not my favorote Odell offering, but it grows on me the more I drink it."
"O- Overally, excellent session beer. This reminds me so much of Summit EPA. It's a great craft beer that is extremely drinkable. Will I buy it again? I'll stick to the local guy (Summit EPA) but if I lived near Colorado, this would be my go to session brew. Well done Odell."
"Pours a clear brass color, with a thin off-white head. Smell is a minty, piney aroma. Taste is a bit of herbal, minty flavor up front, followed by a thin caramel middle, and a resinous, apricot finish. Mouthfeel is average, very nice low carbonation levels. Overall a good beer that I would drink again."

"O – This was just a full flavored experience, great development from beginning to end. Every now and then I enjoy good malt forward English Style Pale ale, sure beats some of the alternatives coming out of England."
""

"O: A good Pale Ale. A touch sweet, but definitely not to sweet. Would like just a tad bit more bitterness in it."
"O - A tasty English Pale Ale with a flavour profile suitable for the style. Nothing over the top, but a very pleasurable ale to consume."
"Drink- Not too shabby. This was a lot more flavorful than I thought it would be. More of a mellow balance and earthy."
"A very solid Pale Ale."
"Overall Impression- Wow this brew is all over the place! Starts with an awesome pour but then the aroma is too light and off-balanced. The taste then is amazing but then finishes strange. I would like to try this one on-tap and wouldn't mind getting it in a bottle again to compare. I like Odell Brewing Co a ton and will be a huge advocate of their brews while I'm in Colorado and while in St. Louis!"
"This is a nice, hoppy but easy to drink beer. I could and would easily down a few of these."
"Overall: very drinkable beer but not a very flavorful pale ale though I suspect this has more to do with the fact that this is an english pale ale as oppose to an american pale ale."
"a great all purpose pale ale, this one smells of a cournicopia of different hop varieties, and has a slightly sweet aroma. mouthfeel is bright with a medium body, extremely refreshing. taste is constantly evolving hop essences and malt balance. this is a winner, a trusty daily drink."
"Odell continues to impress me. Their beers are always visually appealing with great aroma and high drinkability and this one is no different. Very nice hop and malt mix in both aroma and flavor. Solid tan head with lacing. Attractive amber body with swirling bubbles. Tasty malt flavors including a nice sweetness and toastiness. Flavorful drying and bittering finish. The total is greater than the sum of the parts (and the parts are pretty good)."
"Overall a good, representative pale ale."
"O: I thought this was a great example of an EPA so I gave it extra points. It's not very strong in any area, it focuses more on the overall package and the drinkability I think. This is a great session beer for sure, nothing too strong or overpowering about any aspect. Just an easy drinking pale ale."
"I will definitely return to this brew!"
"O- very drinkable, decided to try this one after not having it for awhile."
"D/O- I could drink quite a few of these if it came down to it...low enough in ABV, but very tasty for what it is. Loved burping it up! Perhaps the best tasting English Pale Ale I've had to date, props Odell."
"Serving: Bottle, poured into pint glass."
"Great Pale Ale overall and wish I had access to it."
"o-In a world where there are so many over the top IPA's and IIPA's, this beer holds back and provides a nice pale ale. This beer should be judged by the fact that it's an English Pale, not an IPA. Nice work."
"Overall: A decent pale ale. I would drink it again."
"O - A nice relaxing brew. Great for a hot summer day. Not one to seek, but a must try if you're able to find."
"We sampled this one at the Odell Taproom with some friends, a few Saturdays ago. Poured a nice copper-amber color, with some decent cloudy white foam on top. Aromas of caramel, light brown sugar and some floral hops. On the palate, light bodied, with caramel, biscuit and a hint of hops."
"Pours a clear orange-amber with a fluffy white, one finger head. Really great retention, this beer was poured 10 or 15 minutes ago and the head seems to be in the same place as when it was poured. Floral hops on the nose touch of husky grain and a bit of fruit. Nectarines? Definitely something on the lighter side. Decent fruity body up front. On the mid palate I had a strong association with iced tea. Floral hoppiness on the end with just a touch of bitterness, but definitely not what I would describe as a hoppy beer. This is a really nice pale ale that I would definitely buy when I am looking for something on the lighter side, but still quaffable."
"O- Would like to try again- interesting beer."
"PP (Price Point) -- $8.99 for a 6 pack picked up in Rock Springs Wyoming, not too far from where it was brewed. Would probably skip over this one."
"Thanks pops! This one pours an amber orange with a couple fingers of white head leaving webby lacing. The nose is quite muddled and not mich is picked up but faint hop offerings. The taste has some off putting flavors akin to an aluminium can. Some hops show but not as much as a sweet caramel bready malt. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with good carb."
"Overall this is a very basic, normative pale ale. You could session it, but it won't draw any new conclusions for you."
"I have just found my 'fall back' beer. I will have this in my fridge at all times. Great Pale Ale."
"Overyall, it was a very enjoyable beer. I could easily session these on a hot summer day. Big thanks again Alex!"
"Pours a dark orange-yellow, slighly hazy with a 2 finger beige head that dissapates. A steady rising carbonation that fades out gives this an excellent look. The aroma is floral grapefruit-pear marmalade on fresh bread. Taste is grapefruit juice and citrus with lingering bitterness. Full bodied, clean, and satisfying. Sessionable and food friendly. Just a really fine beer that will find me coming back to again and again."
"Overall: English style, yes. Fairly thirst quenching."
"O - Extremely pleasant one overall, either on its own or as a session drink."
"A wonderful brew. Full of lively citrus character in aroma and taste, this is a beer to savour by the bottle but equally drinkable in quantity. Pretty much ticks all the boxes for what I'm looking for in a beer and this is a wonderful example of a pale ale."
"A decent offering, session beer with enough body and good flavor but next time I'm not gonna sit on it too long."
"On the hoppy side. Nice copper color with thin white head that fades fast but leaves spiderweb lace. Smell has grapefuit, toffee, citrus notes and some lemon. Taste is off balance. Nice toffee, caramel backbone with bitter grapefruit, orange and lemon zest, citrus, and some pine notes. Enjoyable and easy to drink."
"Drinkability was good. Great hop presence for a pale ale, along with a mild bitterness."
"I have been in an IPA cycle, but decided to move slightly downstream and try an Odell Five Barrel Pale Ale. The color is deep for a Pale Ale, and the head appropriate. The aroma is very subtle. Flavor is very even, balanced nicely at the midpoint between sweet and bitter. The very tale end of the aftertaste turns toward bitter. A good beer, easy to drink and will go well with food."
"Drinkability: It's good, would probably be better from a cask or on tap. Overall it's a satisfying, if unoriginal, beer."
"12 oz. bottle with somewhat decipherable freshness date. Hopped four times in the boil, run through a hopback, then dry-hopped; 36 IBUs. Pours a light chestnut, with medium carbonation and two fingers of loose, tan head that leaves nice chunks of lacing. Toasted and biscuit malts in the nose, with darker caramel malts and juicy, oily hops that contribute citrus and pine. Much the same on the palate, if a bit watery, with medium bitterness and nutty yeast that help fill out the flavor. It has a medium weight, with tongue-drying crispness and a lingering finish. This is a pleasant and enjoyable brew, and makes for an easy session ale."
"I used a gentle slow pour which did not create more than wisps for head. Color was a deep orangish-amber with NE-quality clarity. BUPGOO! Nose had an interesting grassy hop character. Mmmm. Mouthfeel was medium and the hops were muted, like drinking hop tea. Man, I was really starting to feel mellow drinking this beer. Finish continued with the grassy hoppiness and I just slipped away into slumberland. Zzzz. Very nice."
"Tasted of pine, light grass, some minimal malt sweetness, very dry finish. With a good mouth feel and good taste, this is a good drinking beer on draught but I don't find it as a real representative of an English Pale Ale at all, if that was what Odell had intended."
"This is really a highly drinkable beer due to its managable abv, clarity, and refreshing trait. A good one to hand out to your non-BA friends to possibly get them started. This has been a favorite of mine after mowing the lawn on a hot afternoon."
"D: Not really a spectacular pale ale. The aftertaste is really hard to ignore."
"D - I'd like to have another one of these - the lack of aftertaste and nice mouthfeel make this super drinkable. I did find that listening to 80s music (cue Talking Heads - This must be the place) while drinking this enhances its drinkability, though I'm sure you could say that about any beer, right?"
"Pours a light amber color with an off white head, about two fingers to start out. A bit of light lacing. Nose brings some floral and citrus hops along with some light malt. Slight hoppy bitterness with some floral notes in the taste. Some light grain as well. Good feel with some mild bitterness. This is a pretty good example of the style and drinks fairly well."
"These guys make some really lovely beer."
"Beer is light in body and soapy. Its kind of gross. its thin and watery with odd bitterness and a mild aftertaste. its difficult to drink but I'm bored and drink the whole thing anyway. Time for bed, sucks that this is my send off beer. Won't be drinking this again."
"Drinkability: High. Finish is pleasant, and at 5.2% quite sessionable. I could have a few."
"A unique and compulsively sippable pale ale."
"If pale ales are your thing this a keeper! For me a little more crispness and less wood/pineyness and it would be far better for some delicious drinking."
"Cheers!"
"16 oz. draft served in a pint glass in Lakewood, CO. Cloudy brown-amber appearance with noticeable carbonation. Thick head off-white with good retention and producing a small amount of lace. Subdued aroma, some piney hops, but very little of much else. Soft feel up front, despite the visible carbonation. Citrus and subtly floral hops present in the middle and end with some apple as well. Medium mouthfeel with very well balanced finish. Worthy of a second."
"D: Its ok, it's better than average for sure, but nothing I would need to seek out again. I would recommend everyone try it, but not before some other beers as well."
"D: A satisfying tasty pale ale. Would go with this over SNPA given the choice. Really nice brew."
"Medium bodied, good carbonation, and it has a bitter finish. A pretty good beer overall, worthy of trying. I would not mind having this again sometime."
"Drinks ok, I'm not in a huge rush to get another sixer but I could see purchasing it again in the future."
"Overall, a very swiggable pale ale and a great balance between malt and hops. A very americanized version of the style that I would definitely try again."
"Hazy golden orange color with a large white head that stuck around forever and left some chunky lacing down the glass. Looks delicious! Aroma is lightly hoppy, some peppery notes, grassiness, herbal, backed up by some pale malt sweetness. Nice tasting beer. The hops surprised me as they are quite fruity, citrusy and refreshing, as opposed to the largely herbal qualities of the aroma. Crisp, dry, refreshing beer. Malt and hops are balanced very well, bitterness is low. Needs a little more body, but much like the 90 Shilling, this is a very drinkable beer. Smooth, almost creamy.. Lots of carbonation but it's not prickly. Overall a great sessionable beer."
"Not bad, just does not resemble an English Pale Ale at all. I could tell that right away from the nose. They really missed the style, if indeed it is intended to be English. Along with the palate burning bitterness this is not something I will revisit often."
"This would be a good pale for a brisk fall afternoon. Not bad, but not something I'll seek out."
"D: A very well balanced brew that is not overpowering. Good for 2-3, well worth a try."
"D - Good drinker, medium bodied not a strong hop brew but very easy to drink. I recommend this brew"
"Odell 5 Barrel Pale Ale pours a thin white head that dissipates almost instantly. Aroma is very faint, sort of biscuity, with more smell of malt than hops. Taste is balanced, and representative of this type of beer. Hops taste more floral than anything. Malt is significant, but not sweet, and finish is relatively bitter. Mouthfeel is decent. Drinkability OK."
"Drinkability: Could drink this all night. Slightly interesting, just what I'm looking for in a session beer."
"Powdery toasted mlat, that seems to have that pilsner malt flavor. Maybe just a hint of biscuits as the palate loses some of that pwodery feel in the middle. The hops add just a little touch of lemon and crispness. The palate finishes semi-dry and flat."
"This is a great tasting beer in which I could sit and have a few at a time. Nice floral and malt aroma. Clean taste and goes down really light. Hops are present but but not overpowering. Subtle malts and just a very good beer to sit and enjoy a few without getting full or giving up flavor. In the end it didn't stick out as something I'd rush out to buy again, but not disappointed either. On sale for $7.99 and I probably wouldn't buy it at anything higher than that."
"Good drinkablility, I think this beer would be great paired with food."
"pours a nice copper color with a 1 finger head and beige ring and some lacing..smell is floral with citrus hops and malts..but faint..tatse is some nice citrus hops some caramel malts toffee and a sweet smooth finish..mouth feel is light medium a little thin but fits the bill for the taste buds..not the most flavorful EPA or APA..but drinkable and flavorful..i could put a few of these away..will buy this one again in singles 2 or 3 at a time"
"Drinkability: One of the better English Pale Ales I have had, with a great balance, slightly ramped-up hops, and a nice feel overall."
"Clear copper pour with nice head and decent lacing. Perfumy, floral nose with hints of toffee malt. The taste is very subdued, even for a pale ale. Malt dominates with an odd squash aftertaste that slowly fades. Reminiscent of a British IPA. The aftertaste hurts the drinkability for me. An average at best pale ale."
"D- Drinkability is certainly high on this one. I've had it a few times now and always have enjoyed it."
"Pale fuzzy peach body. Thin, bubbly ivory white head. Lace comes in sporadic rings. Nice little aroma of hops. A little citrus, a little pungent, a little resiny. On the palate, the malt base could use just a bit of a boost. As is, I get some toffeeish malt tones. Hops adds some lemon and citrus to the mix. Body is medium and the carbonation is quite subdued. Decent enough, but nothing I'm gonna need to seek again, like the St. Lupulin or the IPA."
"Poured from a 12oz. into a pint. It has a nice natural orange hue (as opposed to a Orange Soda color). Very large head with long lasting, glass coating lacing. Lots of carbonation. The smell is of sweet malts, a bit of earthy goodness and some floral notes up front. Laid back but nice. The taste is malty but crisp and not too sweet, a nice little hop kick in the end. It is a little heavy on the carbonation but goes down smooth. I would drink this if I could find it here in SF, thanks to my cousin for getting married and giving me an excuse to try this out in Colorado... and to hang out with family again. Anyway, if you can find it, try it."
"My first from Odell. This is a basic plain Pale Ale. Not much special about the nose or flavor. The flavor has some nice malts and a little bitter kick that makes it a nice multiple drinker. The bitter lingers and cleans the palate so you will come back for more. But overall nothing special about this one."
"This a tasty, complex ale, one I'm going to have to give some consideration to again and again. Delicious hoppy pale ale, with tasty, tasty malt. Mmmmm."
"Taste of wood. Seems consistent with a lot of the O'Dell's. Grainy. Not exactly west coast pale, nor british. Really tastes closer to an amber ale than the pales I'm used to. Neat to check out once, but wouldn't see myself purchasing this at $7.99 anytime soon."
"Tasting notes: hoppy. Smells earthy, with lots of grapefruit and marijuana. Crisp and well carbonated. Clean finish. A bit more bitter than your typical pale ale."
"Drinkability is good. Overall a lackluster beer, but still easy to drink, and one which would be fitting on a hot day."
"D- I'm not completely impressed with the taste, but I do think it is a decent beer and I would be happy to have a few of these. Alcohol isn't too heavy and it is rather refreshing."
"Mostly clear with a slight haze, amber with a fine, eggshell cap and tons of lace. The aroma was mostly citrus, tangerine, with slight malt. Moderate bitterness with orange, floral, and citrus notes, slight toastiness. Medium to light bodied, lowish carbonation, and dry. A good pint of pale ale."
"D- Decent drinkability, the lingering bitterness gets old as you make your way through."
"Mouthfeel is medium, but the carbonation is too loose and fizzy."
"Overall, a good beer for the style and I scored it that way for the first 4 elements. For personal drinkability, it was good but not something that I'd want a 6 pack of. Odell's has plenty of other great beers that I'd rather stock up on. Rotation - not avail in TX so got thru ummagum. Not bad but others that I'd rather have again so this is just a one timer for me. [1-style]"
"Overall a great Americanized version of the classic British pale ale."
"D- Good drinking pale ale that was ruined slightly by the metallic overtones to it. Would love to try it again. Actually I could see this becoming a favorite of mine."
"D: A nice English Pale Ale. Great balance and subtlety of traditional English flavors throughout. Definitely could put back 3-4 of these in an hour, no problem. If it were readily available, it would be a staple."
"Per the label this is produced on there pilot 5 barrel system not the large one. With a very aggressive hoping schedule."
"Beer poured an amber orange with a solid white head that is leaving a nice lacing behind. Nose is caramel malts and fresh citrusy hops. Taste is well balanced between the caramel malts and a medley of citrus, melon, and piney hops. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and the carbonation is just right. Drinkability is quite good, a lot of flavor is packed into this sessionable pale ale."
"Drinkability is good for this beer even though I didn't find it too intriguing. I'll give it credit for being a sessionable option with decent hoppiness. If you aren't asking for much this will do just fine..."
"I'm disappointed on the whole--O'Dell makes some fantastic beers, but this just isn't up to par. There's nothing particularly wrong with it, but it lacks anything to make me want to drink it again."
"Another solid beer by Odell(very underated brewery I say). I could see myself drinking these very easily."
"For a snazy looking bottle, this beer leaves much to be desired. Proclaiming itself as ""bountiful in hop flavor"" - due to 4 different boiling hops - this beer is a run of the mill pale ale, tasting mostly bittering hops, with very few complexities and/or floral notes. Lacing is poor, and aroma is uninspiring. Not sure why I see this all over the place... perhaps you'll like it, or perhaps you'll wonder why someone would think this one special like me."
"Hand-carried from my hometown (Greeley, CO...Thanks N&J)! I got an e-mail from N while they were in Greeley and he said this one was a keeper. Now I know why. An exceptionally drinkable offering from one of the best craft breweries. This is good stuff and I'm glad I still have one bottle left. The beer poured gorgeous gold into the glass with a nice head that quickly dissipated and left very delicate lacing on the glass. Very subtle fruity, piney hops were evident in the nose, and that carried into initial taste. Nice balance of sweetness (very light but pleasantly noticeable) and the aforementioned hops, with a moderate malty body, punctuated by delicate carbonation. Those are two words I'd use a lot with this beer: delicate and subtle. Nothing ""in your face"" about it. No alcohol taste at all, with a very slight dry bitterness at the end. I never put the glass down--and it tasted great right through to the warmer last few swallows. It's an excellent session beer you'd never grow tired of. Clearly a winner all the way around. [PS Kudos to the BA who donated the photo for the review page... one of the best photos I've seen. Love the ""barrel"" wood underneath.]"
"Pours a clear amber with a large white head that slowly settles to a thin cap. Large amount of sticky lacing is left on the glass. Mild aroma. Floral and herbal hop qualities. A little ash is detected as well. Did I mention how weak the aroma was? Herbal and earthy hop flavor. A touch of pine as well. Mild biscuit malt and even some yeast esters giving some complex flavors. Low bitterness for some decent hoppy flavors. Mild yet complex. Lighter body with a soft effervescent carbonation. Lively and dynamic. Well done pale ale. Nice lighter body and low ABV. Bitterness will not wear the palate out. Very sessionable."
"Pretty good. A little different."
"The beer had a light body to it; the beer was smooth, clean and extremely easy to drink. Definitely one of the best pale ales that I have had."
"D - Overall, a very drinkable beer with a nice balance of hops and malts. Could possibly use a little more on the hop side of things, but still a well done pale."
"D- This was a wonderful beer. I really enjoyed the balance between the hops and malts, they played off each other well. One of the better pale ales I've had."
"Drinkability: Pleasant and exceedingly drinkable while providing ample flavor all the while. Recommended, provided you dig light pale ales."
"this beer goes down purty dern easy and its got plenty of character to stay exciting. sessionable for sure. one of the best pale ales i've tried. odell rocks."
"Pours a light golden color with a small head. Really malty, biscuit, smelly beer, very nice smell. Unfortunately, that was the high point for me with this one. It was well crafted and the taste was perfectly fine, it just didn't wow me. It all seemed a bit muddled. Fantastic ingredients and tons of care, just nothing really remarkable that grabbed you and made you want to have another. A perfectly decent effort, you just kinda wonder what could have been."
"From a twelve ounce brown bottle - Pours a light copper color with no haze whatsoever. Smells of fine English malts with just a tad of hops present in the nose. First sip is tasty smooth and malty clean with a slightly bitter finish. Very tasty and easy to drink."
"D: A decent English pale ale with a clear dedication to quality crafting, but the hops influence is a bit muddled, and its abruptness make it not a top-notch session beer candidate, which is what this style is meant to be."
"As it warms the flavors come out, this one is very drinkable."
"This one has a pretty full malt body to go along with some hoppy bitterness. Not an abundance of hop flavors. There is the mildly toasty coppery tang again in the taste, not too fond of that. Maybe it is the fact this is supposed to be English style and they tried to give it some minerality...Overall, It is very drinkable and a fairly good PA."
"D: A very drinkable beer that is great alone or with a meal, anytime of the year."
"the flavor is a nice blend of the aroma characteristics... with a spicy dry finish and a dryness which continues to parch the mouth into the aftertaste. lots o' hops in this one! so much so that the mouth feel is prickly from them! medium bodied with a nice sessionable mouth feel...7/4/7/3/15/3.6"
"D - Good drinkablity. Nice balance."
"Pours a nice, slightly hazy pale color with a slight amber-orange hue to it. The new is nice and fluffy and it leaves good lace. The nose is extremely floral. The taste NASA nice bitterness and nuttiness to it, but it does not have as much floral notes as the aroma does. Good beer, glad to drink it, but it not blow my socks off."
"D: Very drinkable - has a great balance of malt sweetness, citrus flavors and leafy hops in the finish. Goes down pretty easy..very pleasant pale ale."
"D: I drank several of these while eating some hot wings. Great pairing, it's really refreshing!"
"D: very easy to drink"
"Light orange body, sticky lacing, with great retention. Faintly grassy, tea-like hops in the aroma. Flavors of tea leaves, pale malt or grainy barley, with a mild grassiness. Thin, light-bodied, a little watery. Easy drinking, but it doesn't really hold my interest. It could use more distinctive hop character... BBD: 01/29/09"
"May be best enjoyed when you're looking for a summertime refresher."
"M/D - There was something about the finish that bothered me. Kind of a harsh finish to a overall bland tasting beer. I don't think I would search this one out again."
"I had this at a pub in Denver. The locals were raving about it; I thought it was good, but not enough to make me rave. A rather mediocre orangish color, with no head and no lacing. Rather mild nose for a PA. On the palate there is a nice maltiness, perhaps more than most American PAs have. Good carbonation makes this sparkly and refreshing. The best part of the taste is a nice pronounced bitter finish and aftertaste."
"Thanks Waltonc!"
"You could drink it, but only if you went fast enough to never notice the after-taste. Not a beer you want to let linger."
"Bought for hotel-room drinking while driving across Wyoming. Pours a terra-cotta color with a short filmy white head. Slow lacing. Vague hop odor with sweet malts. Flavor is a nice lemony hop and mild bitterness, slightly sweet caramel malt backbone. Simple but well crafter and tasty. Medium bodied. Goes down easily, with a nice flavor."
"Mike"
"D_Good pale ale, very drinkable but not a standout in any particular category."
"Odell continues to impress me, I need to stop slacking and make the hour journey to Fort Collins."
"D-Just another great brew from a brewery that just contiues to impress me I would pick this up anytime"
"D: Smell not all that impressive, but tastes great. Drinkable too."
"D: Very well balanced, which allows this to be much more drinkable than many of its cousins (in the English Pale Ale category). Extremely sessionable. This one is growing on me!"
"On tap at the Stable. Poured a deep amber color with nice head retention and great lacing. Light hop flavor that is well balanced by the malt. a perfect session beer. lightly carbonated and mild sweetness. malty aftertaste that does not linger. Very smooth overall. This is my first Odell offering and I will def be going back for more."
"D: Excellent drinkability."
"Smooth easy to drink pale ale, lower hop taste than most. Not my favorite pale ale but not bad either."
""
"D: Glad I have another"
"Drinkability - I keep coming back to this one. Its very well balanced, and I can drink it all night long without it getting old."
"D - SMOOTH EZ TO DRINK, JUST MAKES FOR AN ENJOYABLE TIME."
"D: Nice unassuming session beer that pairs well with food."
"I poured a 12oz bottle into a standard pint glass. This beer pours an amber brown with very little head and leaves a very small white ring around the edge of the glass. As far as the smell goes I don't really get much except some malty profiles and a very faint sweet hop characteristic. This feels great on the tongue; medium body with a light carbonation feel to it. Overall I would say this is a pretty standard pale ale and if given the chance I'd probably drink it again although I probably wouldn't search for it."
"This is a fairly average pale ale. Nothing too special going on here. Kind of an amber brown color with a tan head. The nose has a subtle malt profile under a citrus hop presence. The taste has hops up front and settles to some mild caramel malts. The average body is refreshing and has decent carbonation. A good pale ale, but not the most interesting."
"Better session beer than SNPA in my opinion. A mild beer that would probably be good as a crossover for some."
"D: This is a good, balanced pale ale, but its not one of my favorites. I can have a few, but if I want to session with a pale, there are a few others I would go for first."
"Interesting - and even good - but nothing great. It has key characteristics of an English pale ale (perhaps with an American flair), though a bit too leafy/tannic."
"I reaaly like this beer. I had it today for the first time in a long time. It is on the darker side of the pale ale spectrum, being a bright red color that is very appealing. There is a great hop bouquet in the aroma and the taste carries those hops with it, and balances them with a rich malt flavor. This is a big beer masquerading as a pale ale."
"Md-heavy body and moderate carbonation. Barely a sting on the tongue. Quite nice."
"Drinkability is"
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. This beer is a nice clear golden color with a one finger head. Aroma is balanced between the citrus hops and caramel malts. The flavor is very much the same balance of malt and hops. Very pleasant but not exceptional. Mouthfeel is lighlty sticky and medium bodied. Another strong brew from this brewery for me."
"Very tasty brew. Good balance, thirst quenching and easy to drink."
"Heres to someone making a fantastic session beer with flavor that you can drink more than one of without benig filled up and buzzin!"
"Poured very nicely... wonderful head. Wanted a bit more aroma, but still good. Generally smooth with a bit of acidity. It had a pretty good balance that obviously leaned toward hop heavy... in a good way. I really liked the color and clarity of this beer. I would buy it again."
"12 oz bottle pours a chill hazed amber body with a delicate offwhite head that leaves behind a lot of clingy lacing. Aroma is earthy and citrusy hops that have a grassy and piney component. Malt notes are toasty and biscuity. Body is medium and well carbonated. Taste is earthy hops with grassy elements. Softer citrus notes emerge as it warms. Malt backbone balances well, with a toasty and biscuity caramel presence. More of an American IPA than an English Pale Ale but pleasantly drinkable."
"D - Easy drinking and goes down easy. no harsh attributes, but nothing stands out either."
"Overall, this is a disappointing pale ale from a great brewery. Stick to Odell's other beers."
"I remember being impressed by this beer when it first came out. Its orange with a nice head and looks great in a pint glass. Smells good but I can see why this is ""English"" style. This is a nice balanced pale ale. Its very easy to drink, tasty, I can drink several of these, I should have bought a twelve-pack."
"Thanks, Oxymoron, for the adventure and Schmittymack, for the chance to re-visit"
"Deep golden center with yellower edges. Small, wispy, off-white head. Butterscotch and pear brandy malt aromas mix with spicy, herbal hops. Toasted malts and citrusy hop bitterness up front. Butterscotch and fruity malt flavors settle in. Citrus bitterness gradually becomes more of a mildly numbing herbal mint bitterness. Creamy mouthfeel in a moderate body. Nicely drinkable and would maybe be even better on cask."
"This beer pours a brilliant copper color with a fair amount of white head which quickly fades to a fine scum. Aroma is of some hops, some candy sugar, and more malt than I expected. Flavor is very malty and sour up front (like a not very heavily hopped barley-wine, but lighter) with some hops becoming present afterwards. Mouthfeel is thin. I'm not a fan of this."
"This is an enjoyable standby for me."
"Medium bodied on the tongue with lots of carbonation. Goes down easy enough. Overall, an easy drinking pale ale to be found here with a bit of a biscuit twist. Solid brew, but it doesn't really do anything to differentiate itself from the pack."
"Overall, a decent experience, but not one I'm craving to try again."
"Silver, Classic English-Style Pale Ale, 2005 GABF"
"This is a very drinkable beer that went very well with the vegetarian pizza it accompanied."
"This isn't as hoppy as APA's which is why I think I was critical at first. This beer has a nice hop aroma and taste in good balance with the malts, and it was very refreshing. A nice alternative when you're not in the mood for the hoppiness of an APA. I'm becoming a fan of Odells."
"Not a bad beer, really... just pretty mediocre."
"The beer pours a medium caramel with a dense head and good lacing. The smell is just about perfect for me, especially in a Pale Ale. Toasted malt with a hint of sweetness along with some solid hops in the background. The taste is very good but not quite the same as the smell. There is the classic pale ale taste backed up with a little stronger hop profile. I tasted grass, pine and a little chocolate. The carbonation and body of the beer make it a beer for all seasons with just the right mix of body and liveliness. This is a super-drinkable beer it just goes down smooth. I think this would be one of my standards if I could get it in Atlanta. Unfortunately we can't so I will just need to visit Colorado more often!"
"Pours a nice hazy orange, medium copper color with lots of big bubbly white head. Aromas are pretty hop forward: Fuggle and EKGs give off a nice floral, citrusy aroma, fresh. Some faint lightly toasty malts are there, but mostly hops. On the palate, the hops continue to take center stage with a nice open of mango and citrus. Unfortunately, it takes a weird turn from there. An increasingly dry, thin body with biting carbonation give this one a poor mid palate and finish. Overall, drinkability is fine, but I'd like a better rounded Pale ale."
"This beer is just short of awesome...very hoppy and very slightly bitter. I started drinking this beer over the winter and it works well in all seasons. It is well-balanced enough to go well with different foods, especially fish. Give it a try and you will not be disappointed."
"This could be a session beer. A solid British-style Pale Ale with perhaps more hops than the average Brit. Perhaps not willing to live on the wild side of the beer experience, it certainly has better manners than many of those beers that do."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into my standard shaker ""pint"" glass. Appears a golden amber color with about two fingers of thick off-white foam. Smells of earthy, fruity hops followed by a slight caramel malt note. Tastes of light citrus like lemon and bitter orange along with sweet caramel malt. Medium in both body and carbonation. Certainly a sessionable brew that I'd seek out again."
"Pours out an orangey-amber with an abundance of carbonation and a rich, thick, foamy head with many rifts in it. Leaves rings of lacing around the glass with each gulp. Aroma could have been a bit stronger. Smells like a mix of American and English pale ales. It has the diacetyl but there's a cleanness to it also. The hops are a mix of citrus and earthy herbal ones. Flavor is silky smooth with a solid malt background with sweet caramel tones and a rather pronounced hop presence of mandarin orange and bitter herbs. Mouthfeel almost leans toward thin, but the carbonation is excellent and smooth. I could drink this all night."
"Mouthfeel was rounded, smooth and medium in body. Medium/mild in carbonation. Subtle, British. Well done."
"Drinkability is just fine. I thought it could have been a little more robust but it is sessionable."
"D: Pretty good, I'd have this again. Flavors are solid and balance is good. Mouthfeel is a little lackluster, but this beer has other attributes that I find appealing. Thanks to both Wasatch and flexabull for sending a bottle..."
"D - where do I get a 6 pack?"
"Bottle courtesy of Beerandblues2: Poured a medium amber with some light cloudiness and a medium slightly off-white foamy head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of dry and bitter hops is dominating. Taste consists of aggressive metallic hops with strong dry bitter finish. Body is slightly above average with some medium carbonation. I dont know if the bottle was oxidized or if the type of hops use provide the metallic taste but I cant say that this was a much appreciated experience."
"Pours a nice clean/clear golden amber color, nice carbonation, the head is a nice creamy off-white color and leaves some nice islands and sticky lacing afterwards. The nose is hoppy, malty, slightly citrusy, and some caramel. The taste is kinda sweet, malty, nice hop/bitterness thrown in, slightly dry finish. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is a very tasty English Pale Ale, highly recommended."
"Thanks for the bottle Wasatch."
"Pale amber-orange in color, somewhat cloudy. Thin, but active head, decent patchy lacing. The nose is hopped-up; juicy, piney hops and some notes of citrus. Sweet and sour like citrus hops are the first impression; turns musty in a hurry, but in a good way. Zesty lemon, mild malt backbone and traces of butterscotch candy are found here. Very enjoyable and a great session beverage."
"D - Definately a british style pale ale, but with quite a bit going on."
"This beer is quite light and easy drinking. I could definitely see myself knocking back a few of these during a session. Of course it is light and interesting enough to be used as that beer that one starts out the night with, before moving on to more powerful beers."
"A very drinkable beer that would make for a great session."
"It is a lovely beer to look at. A really nice creamy thick head with staying power. It also had a great mouthfeel even with the loads of bitterness."
"D - It is a pretty good PA. A good blend of hops and malt."
"Definitely worth trying! An interesting pale ale that straddles the British and American versions of the style. Very drinkable!"
"Very nice"
"D - This is a really, really great session beer. I could drink these all night. A bit closer to the British style of Pale Ale than American which is always a plus for me."
"Overall: Poured into a pint glass. I like the pale ales, but can't drink a lot of them, I was a little dissapointed in the head, I read that it should be a lot thicker than what I got. Overall it is a very drinkable beer."
"Sinner that I am, I could drink these down like water all day long in the summer."
"Good medium bodied mouthfeel with the carbonation in check. Flavor lingers for a bit before slowly fading away. Good drinkabilty overall. Nice flavor and really easy to put down. A nice beer."
"Very smooth body, smooth taste. Everything meshes well - seamless. Slightly high carbonation, moderate malt, moderate hop bite, and a vanilla w/slight creaminess is there. Finishes with hop tartness and a mildly syrupy sweetness. Overall very good for an everyday beer."
"You know, this would be an absolutely amazing ESB - if it had different hops. Yeah, it's a Pale Ale and whatever. Oh, hmm. The category here is English Pale Ale. Well, that it ain't. There are just too many 'merican hops (floral, grapfruity) for this to be English anything. And, frankly, it disturbs me. This really would be a great beer, but, well, bleh."
"Drinkability: Sessionable, easydrinking pale ale. But thid definitely doesn't live up to the ""we love hops"" claims of the label, and I can't really see how the hop filtering and additions add to the beer. I think a lot of drinkers will find this inoffensive, but malty and lacking hops aggression - fruitier than other EPAs I've had, but not quite vibrant enough to be an APA or an IPA. As with many Odell beers, this is a line-drive single rather than a home run."
"A great session beer this would make. Very nicely crafted."
"Pours a copper colour with a limited head. Citrus, hops and malt on the nose. Flavors are a hop winning battle with the malts, but I did not find this brew to be crazy hoppy. Grapefruit on a apricot canvas. A good pale ale. Thanks to jhammerly for the bottle."
"Over all, I think this is a tastey and balanced pale ale. This is the beer that Odell is replacing their Bobby Kolsch with. While 5 Barrel is good, if I had to choose, I think I would prefer Bobby."
"Pours a rust color with a massive fluffy ivory colored head that retains well. Floral and biscuity odors. Malts up front with a hop kick for the finish in the mouth. Feels very good in the mouth, refreshing. If this was available in my area this would be my summer time session beer. Not as hoppy as other pale ales, but overall better than most. Many thanks to jhammerly for the sample."
"With the 5.2%, this makes for a good sessional summer brew."
"I used to drink the Cutthroat Pale Ale quite a bit, this seems pretty comparable."
"This is a fine example of an English IPA. I'm not usually a big fan of the English IPAs, but this beer is making me think otherwise. I could definitely go for a few more."
"Very nice pour with a range of merigold hues. Good thick crown and steady head retention. A good number of bubbles rise to the crown. The beer is somewhat hazey and is even more-so directly below the crown. The frothy white head clings to the sides of the glass as the crown subsides. Good hoppy aroma with hints of citrus. The beer has a crisp hoppy taste with some citrus and even more bitterness toward the end.However, the flavor does seem to fade or dull too quickly. Mouthfeel is very nice, light, and refreshing. Good drinkability."
"Appears an orange copper hue nice sized off white head leaves fine streaks of lacing down my pint. Aroma has citrus aromatics biscuit toned pale malts very nice hop profile here. Taste has a moderate bitterness citrus fruit zest bready pale malt balances very well together very nice depth to the simple straight forward pale ale if that makes any sense. Mouthfeel light to medium bodied pale even smooth carbonation touch of oiliness in the texture. Drinkability is great such a balanced pale with ample hop flavor good indeed a good drink near 5 barrels of this stuff, quality."
"Drinkability: Do I want another? Yes. Can I get another? Absolutely, a near sessionable beer (if your session is held to a 6-pack, IMO) and affordable. I can find this on sale every couple of weeks for $5.99. It's been awhile since I had a Cuthroat, so I can not compare them side by side, but this one is a little different."
"A very solid pale ale brewed with some cool hops. Kinda like a tamed-down Stone IPA. Me likey. Cheers!"
"Drinkablity is very solid and a really enjoyable beer to sit and drink and not have to ponder any real intricacies to this one. A very enjoyable pale, it is what is advertised to be. Very nice embossed bottle also."
"This is the only beer to rival DFH 60 minute for balance and flavor I have had this year. Cheers to Odell and may the grow and send some of this beer to MD."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/4"" off-white head above the slightly cloudy orangey amber brew. Head fades slowly, with good lacing. Aroma is reasonably sedate with light hoppiness ""overpowering"" the almost-there grain scent. Taste is a surprisingly somewhat puckering citrus hops hit upfront, then balances out as the malts do their part, but the remanants of that start still linger as I smack my lips. Mouthfeel is nice and smooth, and drinkability is, like many English-styles, very impressive. High sessionability here in a pleasingly put together package."
"Interesting beer, tried for the first time while in CO for the Great American Beer Festival. Odells creates some good things. Definitely worth giving a shot. A little cloudy in appearance, but very drinkable. I'd love to give this one a shot on tap."
"There is a smoothness to the beer as pleasant. Kind of surprising for its limited taste. A good carbonation that isn't too much or too little. Overall this is a decent session beer."
"Hazy orange-copper color, nice white foamy head that leaves a nice lacing in my glass, light caramel, flowery aroma, medium body with a full and creamy mouthfeel, balanced malt and mild hop flavors. This is an English style pale ale, very mild and very drinkable, great for the style."
"Excellent mouthfeel and medium-plus body. Going with a lower drinkable rating as I tire a little of the Willamette hop flavors although there are other likely in the mix."
"5 Barrel Pale Ale is a decent English pale ale that needs to undergo a change in the malt bill if I'm ever to get fully onboard. As always, your mileage may vary. Thanks to bditty187 for the bottle."
"Sampled at the taproom in Fort Collins. Poured a light amber color. Slight carbonation and head with lacing up the sides of the glass. Smell is very good, earth/floral, smell of hops. Taste is very well balanced slightly malty with a nice hop aftertaste. Very good pale ale."
"I liked it on draft more so , but failed to take notes...."
"Mouthfeel is light and soft, easy to drink. I could session this."
"Poured very nicely... wonderful head. Wanted a bit more aroma, but still good. Generally smooth with a bit of acidity. It had a pretty good balance that obviously leaned toward hop heavy... in a good way. I really liked the color and clarity of this beer. I would buy it again."
"This beer pours perfect with a nearly two fingers head that stays with the glass throughout the session. I was most impressed with the look of this beer. The smell is slightly citrus to me with a more overwhelming hop and malt overtone. This beer tasted as advertised for a pale ale, slightly hopped, with a nice smooth finish. The mouth feel is smooth and decent but the last thing this beer has going for it. Overall a good beer to have amongst freinds."
"Yesterday I toured the Odell Brewery with brewmaster/owner Doug Odell personally doing the honors. If you get to Fort Collins, it is worth your time. A beautifully set up, organized and well-run first class operation! Bins full of imported English malts, a huge variety of hops and all the bells and whistles. They have 5 Barrel on tap, in both nitro and carbonated forms - so I had a growler to go! I liked the creaminess of the nitro, but knowing it would go flat, had a mixture poured into my jug. It travelled will, and still has plenty of fizz! It was worth the drive! There are a half-dozen hops that go into the process of making this beer, Willamette being the most prominent. I tasted it green right out of the yeast tank - even then it was delicious! But the nitro version is SO creamy smooth!! But it has all the apricot-peach aromas, delicate hops, perfect fizz, medium malt middle and dry, elegant finish of the bottled, tap, nitro and growler versions were perfect!"
"Medium bodied, very drinkable. Definitely worth a try."
"The beer pours a nice golden color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is awesome. It has an intense hop aroma that is floral and pleasant to the nose. It also has a solid malt base that consists of pale and carapils malts. The taste is great. It has a well balanced flavor. It has a nice malty core that boasts of pale and carapils malts as well as a very bitter hop taste and finish that's floral and refreshing. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a great pale ale. It has awesome aroma and taste; highly drinkable and very enjoyable."
"Overall impression: Great session beer. As I said in my on tap review, this is a bit like a hopped up version of Fat Tire."
"An all around good but average pale. This will be bottled in june of this year(2005). Im glad it is replacing the current cutthroat pale. It had a dark amber color and a some what small head. Nothing too out there about it. One of the better local pales on tap. I would take it over the New Belgium products."
"Overall, it's a good mild American Pale Ale. The American hops differentiate it quite a bit from the English hops in the Cutthroat Pale. I like the dry hopped flavor. I wish it was even hoppier!"
