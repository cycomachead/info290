The hops give off a amazing variety of fruity aromas ranging from pineapple to citrus including grapefruits and lemons to mango. Beyond the hops there is a touch of caramel malt. The taste follows the smell but the fruit is toned down and the hops end up tasting more grassy and floral than fruity. Bitterness is fairly restrained as the hops are more flavorful than bitter, that moderate bitterness is balanced with a sweet bready maltiness. The mouthfeel of this beer is moderate with lively carbonation both of which are spot on for the style. The finish is just sweet enough and crisply bitter. Overall this is an incredibly flavorful, rather unique EPA that is a joy to drink. A world class example without question.","fank2788","Sep 07, 2012"

Lacing was prevalent throughout. Color was an ever-so-slightly-hazy sunshine yellow with lots of carbonation bubbles in evidence. Nose had an odd fruitiness, like grapefruit and pineapple together. Mouthfeel was very effervescent and it did, indeed, taste like a hybrid of a grapefruit and a pineapple. Finish was quite dry with the grapefruit taste simply lingering well after the swallow.

Pours a straw gold with a rocky, half inch head embedded with tiny pinpricks - some particles are evident floating in solution. Great nose on this beer - mild tropical fruit notes, citrus and a light earthy character. Taste follows nose; however, light malts also manifest in the flavor profile, with an earthy presence through the middle and back, a slight buttery character and a mild, lingering earthy bitterness at the finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a pleasant, even carbonation and a light acidity that refreshes the palate. Overall, a very pleasant and easy drinking EPA (perhaps one of the best I've had to date). The Nelson-Sauvin hops add a really great character to this beer.

3.2,-20,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3,"I tried this beer on May 30, 2012 after purchasing from the KIng and Spadina LCBO outlet in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The beer poured a slightly hazed medium gold colour with a 1"" snow white head, and plenty of effervescence. The aromas were grtass, citrusy hops, spices, and orange peel. The mouthfeel was medium bodied with medium carbonation. The flavour was definitely on the bitter side with very little nsweetness brought on by any of the malt or fruit aromas. Generous amounts of orange and grapefruit and a sharp bitter end dominate the flavour. Would be a very sessionable beer had it not been for the bitter aftertaste.","cyrenaica","Jun 05, 2012"

4.22,5.5,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Pours a hazy pale blonde colour, one finger fluffy white head, some lacing at the top of the glass. Smell is incredibly hoppy, lots of tropical and citrus fruits going on, orange, mango, grapefruit, a slight sweetness with some malt but this is a full on fruity hop nose all the way. Taste is dry and hoppy followed by a more pronounced malt bill, some earthy hop bitterness with some tropical fruit flavours coming in mid palate towards the finish, light sweetness in finish and aftertaste. Medium crisp carbonation, med body, some oily points and quite dry feeling. This was a very impressive pale ale, very easy drinking and something I would welcome many times over.","peensteen","May 28, 2012"

Aroma of fruity and floral hops with light grassy notes is very enticing. Taste is dominated by the grassy, fruity and floral notes form the hops with almost no bitterness notes and a solid malt backbone with well balanced sweetness that doesn’t detract from the hops.

The nose will absolutely blow you away. The Nelson Sauvin hops totally steal the show! Tons of that distinctive aroma full of grapefruit and tropical fruit, reminiscent of New Zealand’s sauvignon blanc wines. The taste is complex and also dominated by the Nelson Sauvin hops. Earthy, herbal, and citrusy at the same time. Hints of grapefruit, gooseberries, lemon, white grapes, pineapple, and an odd touch of green onion. The mouthfeel is oily and resiny with a light, crisp, and refreshing dry finish. Another awesome beer from Thornbridge!","beerdrifter","Feb 09, 2012"

A much fuller body than the bottled version which to be honest swamps and smothers some of the beer's more appealing and delicate qualities.

3.85,-3.8,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"This ale certainly improved as it breathed, as it released a lot of the ""skunkiness"" that first presented in the smell and taste. The bitterness is classic Thornbridge; in fact, whichever hop was used to create the bitterness likely is the same one used in their Jaipur IPA. Not a bad English PA, though slightly more bitter than others I've had - something that works for me. Still, of the Jaipur, the Raven and the Kipling, the Kipling is my least favorite of the bunch.","TheHoppiest","Aug 26, 2011"

4.1,2.5,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Brilliant golden pour on tap at Piper's Pub in Pittsburgh's Southside, it's a pale golden ale much like a hazed Czech or German pils in appearance. Light biscuit malts labeled as a South Pacific Pale Ale, recently showed up at my local in Ohio for 6.99 a 500 ml bottle. I hate to say it but I passed at those prices. I'm pretty sure I had an imperial pint for at or around 5 bucks at Piper's. Aroma has a citrus grapefruit esque earthy grassy hop profile about it. Very pleasant floral aspect as well, all those hops amongst a pale biscuit malt background a bit of fruity earthiness comes through from the yeast and English brewing traditions. Flavor was nice a really refreshing hoppy pale ale, English style not an Americanized pale not as aggressive but very well executed and flavors definitely blend together nicely. The pale biscuit malt sweetness with a mild fruitiness is the perfect back drop for the star of the show in this case Nelson Sauvin hops. Those hops bring the herbal grassiness with a nice persistent grapefruit pith bitterness. Mouthfeel was lighter bodied with moderate carbonation a really crsip nice drinking pale ale with great complexity for a beer so light in color. Overall impression is that it would be a great beer to attempt to drink in number, but the price point at 6.99 a bottle may stop me from drinking it indefinitely.","WVbeergeek","Jul 13, 2011"

Pours a bright body with plenty of head, great color an English IPA, or a ""South Pacific Style"" as they call it. Smell has the slightly more subdued hop profile characteristic of the English IPAs (compared to the huge West Coast IPAs). Very clean, with a unique hop profile. Taste is plenty bitter with a depth of malt character and some hop varieties that I have not tasted before, or at least not in this particular combination. Really solid English IPA.

4.74,18.5,4,5,4.5,5,5,"O - Sadly, I was not eating any food alongside this beer. I would love to explore its abilities to pair with food, which I think would also help to counteract what I think is a touch too much bitterness. Nelson Sauvin is fairly high in alpha acid, and I am sure that they'll tweak the next batch accordingly. From what I am reading this is the first commercial example of a beer brewed with this hop variety, so I'm sure that while a small (almost infinitesimal) tweak is in order, but I have a very high opinion of this beer, and I think that anyone who doesn't should give it a second (or third, or fourth) shot.","lehkost","Apr 19, 2011"

Honeysuckle and marshmallow are in the mix as well - but the flavor is quite contained, very vinous with gooseberry, kiwi fruit, and honey notes. Crisp and perfectly bitter, with snappy carbonation and a dry finish. This is an excellent and unusual English ale, and I would love to try it on cask.","soulgrowl","0"
