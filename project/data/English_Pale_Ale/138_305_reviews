"I am neutral on this beer."
""
""
""

"O: though the taste may be ever so slightly off here (no bottle date), this has an assertive, pleasant-enough English hop flavor with arguably a slight edge over the clean yet depth-y malt foundation... you're still not gonna find many American breweries making a pale like this"
""
""

"O:  Good beer.  Nice to kick back with and drink with the folks."

"A decent, session pale ale, as expected."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: pleasant drink, not particularly overwhelming and complex (not a bad thing) like all the beers from Shepherd Neame"
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium body, medium low carbonation"
""
"Overall – This Ale is really special. It is very like a bridge between a standard Ale and a good Bitter. This beer pleases, excites and satisfies in equal measures. I can best describe this by saying it is a great ambassador for British brewing."
""

"Pours a deep clear amber with a medium off white head. Aroma and Taste is sweet toasted caramel malt and grains, mild fruity notes and light bitterness. Palate is a medium crisp body with good carbonation. Finishes with toasted caramel malt, grains, and a mild hops bitterness. Overall a good easy drinking session brew."

"This bottle’s too cold.  This bottle’s too warm.  There isn’t one in my hotel room that’s just right.  This isn’t my first dance with Spitfire and I must say it didn’t live up to my expectations.  Both the flavor and aroma are very weak, not what I like in Kentish ales.  It’s definitely short dated, sometimes marked on the bottle neck, sometimes not.  This is not up to the usual standards of Shepherd’s Neame."

"Typical English pub beer for downing a few.  Good but not great."

"Brewed originally to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, this English Ale is a standout brew that pours a dark amber color with a creamy white head that doesn't dissipate quickly. The taste is a tad hoppy, but not to the point of overpowering with plenty of bitterness and it's a refreshing and pleasant Ale that goes down quickly and demands a second sip straight away. The beer takes its name from the famed fighter aircraft that fought over the skies of Britain during the Second World War. One of the finest English beers I've tried in awhile."

"It was a small, 11.2-fl. oz. bottle, so I thought that I could invert it until the pseudo-cascade began and foam began approaching the top of my glass at an alarming rate. It settled into two puffy fingers of tawny head with good retention. Color was a solid amber (SRM = 13) with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a soft, buttery quality, undoubtedly from using hard water in its production. Biscuit malts were also present and I watched the head slowly fall, leaving some nice lacing in its wake as I anticipated that first sip. Mouthfeel was medium and the flavor was bready, biscuity, buttery and slightly sweet. I am guessing East Kent Goldings hops for a mild grassiness. In keeping with the style, this was much more restrained than its American counterparts and as such, was a nice change of pace for yours truly. I rarely truck in either imports or bottles and so this was a rare treat. Its relative mellowness was like a cup of tea after that coffee porter. Warming, the taste took on a nice nuttiness that only enhanced its mellow flavors. Finish was semi-dry and quite refreshing. Well done, lads!"

"This is quintessential mass produced pale ale from the UK. Low carbonation with a rich body, this beer leans to the malty side. I do catch a modicum of hop flavor in the swallow but it doesn't last long."
""
""
""
""
"Overall I give it a 4.50"
""
"This is what beer should look like. Awesome appearance with a deep blood orange/ amber color that begs to be drank. Moving onto the flavor, it's exactly what I would expect. Slight caramel flavor, marmalade and spice. It is smooth and slightly creamy. This is one of the few British beers with full body flavor and easy to drink that I enjoyed. I hope to see more of this beer now that it is available here in the States."
"I ordered this one because it was a different style - The Kentish Ale. This was really hard to compare to any other English Style Ales that I have had before. There was a really sweet - deep malty note to this beer but a solid hop not on the back end. Really unique beer and easy to drink with a lower ABV."

"O: Not very tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, there are definitely several other choices in the style that are better."

""
""
"""Spunky. I had a good time with this one."" as an ace reviewer wrote - I agree."
""
"It's only befitting that a beer released to commemorate the Battle of Britain - brewed by Britain's oldest brewery - be so quintessentially British. There's no mistaking this as an ale from any other part of the world; its hard water profile, biscuity malts, dried fruit esters, spicy hops, and mild, approachable manner are the very things that define the proud English brewing tradition."
"Overall – A refreshing and easy drinking, crisp brew. While not a flavor powerhouse it is quite easy drinking and enjoyable. A great session style brew."
""
"Overall: A solid, dry, and easy to drink English Pale Ale. I would get this again, but would not go out of my way for it."
"O -- The malt & hops play very well together in this beer and give the drinker a good example of an English Ale that doesn't allow hop characters to run rampant. Alos terrific in its sessionable ABV."
""

"O - I really enjoyed this one. I'll look forward to buying it again."

"Really malty and of high bitterness, with some nice red fruit tones."
"Spitfire Premium Kentish Ale ---3/5."
"Bland, maybe. Easy, but not worth repeating. My session ales require more flavor."
"Poured from a brown 11.2 oz. bottle. Has a tannish/brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of light hops, a bit of malts, kind of mild. Taste is well balanced malts and hops, some bitterness, a bit of breadyness to it. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a pretty good beer."

"Very nice bitterness, even superior to English IPAs. Good personality with an original taste. If you like English hops, don't miss it."

"O: Nice English ale, very drinkable. Not spectacular."
"O - Good,drinkable,easy to drink. Close to IPA,but not 100 % IPA."
""
""
""
""
"O: good readily available brew, the tasting notes on the back of the bottle are hilarious"
"Overall - Solid English Ale, but not my fave. Worth a try at least."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not my favorite but still good and glad to have something to remind me of good memories."
"O: Pleasant beer, that goes down easy."
"O - A tasty brew but surprisingly mild flavoured. I've overlooked this on the shelf before and although it wasn't bad, I won't feel bad overlooking it again."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A lighter version of the English Pale Ale, I rather prefer the Bishop Finger from the same brewery, but Spitfire is a good option as a session beer."
""

"Thanks to Billy for this one!"

"Drinkability is high, a nice malt flavor countered by the hops, in a balanced, restrained package. Just try not to sniff too much!"
"Good classy pale ale. Quite on the dry side with healthy bit of hops bitterness. Not remarkable, but keeps it interesting and drinkable."
""
""
"O: Absolutely drinkable. Perfect session beer. Delicious British Ale"
"Food match: Roast beef, steak pies and Cornish pasties all spring to mind, but really for a style like EPA (with no overpowering flavours) it's quite versatile to most foods."
""
""
""
"Overall, not a bad example, but not a great one. Need more malt. Will not buy again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: a surprisingly interesting beer that would be great for a session"
"500ml bottle. Pint glass. Enjoyed on may´11. Deep copper color. Crystal clear appearance. White, small bubbled, froth. Close & dense head with fairly good retention. Nice lacing. Moderate citric & sweet malt aromas. Floral touch. Sweet malty upfront followed by smooth citric. Clean bitterness & gentle palate. Medium body, soft carbonation. Bitter finish. Big beer!!"
""
"Overall: Nothing really wrong with this beer, I'm glad I picked it up, but I don't think I'll be trying it again too soon. Worth a try for a fan of English Ale, but it probably won't be the best you've had."
""
""
""
""
""
"Not the best English ale I've had, but not bad"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a nice sessionable ale!"
""
"O – A clean, well-made and traditional English ale. Despite the relatively high hop bitterness, it goes down smoothly and has enough other elements to avoid seeming one-dimensional."

"Final Grade: 3.52, a B grade."

"Overall - A very drinkable beer that has enough flavour to keep it interesting and yet not too cloying. I could definitely drink several of these throughout the course of an evening. It might be a touch too expensive for what you get however."
"Could have sworn this was better even when it was released as a bottle conditioned ale but sadly those days are long lost. A shame such a lacklustre beer should be named after such a great fighter. If it was up to me I'd rebadge it Boulton Paul Defiant."
"Well, the see-through bottle had me feeling a wee bit trepidatious, but that was soon dispelled - this is a well-balanced, yet still decently flavourful EPA - not a lot of that makes it to my 'hood."
"Sadly the body is a bit watery thin, a shame because everything else about the beer is fine, well carbonated and easy to drink."
"I love cans and I am very happy to see another UK canned beer in BC. The Spitfire is a fairly malty pale ale with a thickish mouthfeel that holds up to stronger foods such as burgers with blue cheese. The hops are decidely English in profile but not overtly flowery. A great EPA for when the nights get colder and with the can it tastes fresh."
"Just beautiful!"
"O - A lovely Kentish pale ale that is quite delicious and has a character to its own."
"O- This one ranks among the best EPA's that I've tried to date! I love this style and the smooth, creamy, full flavored character of this one puts it right up there with the best in my opinion! Perfectly balanced, from sweet beginning to bitter end, this one has it all! Highly recommended!!"

"Very nice ale that's almost impoosible to stop at just one pint..refreshing on a summer's eve."
"A classic British ale. It might not be the best beer in the world but it's a fine example of an English bitter. A good depth of flavour with subtle bitterness, even if the aroma is better than the taste. One of Shepherd Neame's more worthy offerings. I would be happy to sink a few of these - definitely one to try if you have the chance."
"O: A nice malty real ale. Not the best beer I've ever had."
"Overall - this is an all round clean refreshing beer that is easy drinking with its lower end ABV, i would buy this again."
"D: A decent English pale ale with a distinctly bitter, hoppy flavour. I find it skews the balance and makes the beer more finish than flavour, but it's certainly worth trying for yourself to see whether the tanginess suits your tastes."
"While the body and carbonation of this Spitfire Ale are pretty much on point, the harsh feeling and flavors that I find make the drinking experience generally unpleasant. Unfortunate, because I was really excited after the aroma and appearance were so damn good."
"Taste was quite good, with a strong finish. Felt very good in the mouth, not watery."
"A well balanced brew, straight and no fuss."
"Deep orange in colour with a persistent, rocky head. The aroma is vaguely hoppy and complex with fruit and a tinge of mustiness and white pepper. There is a waft of orange peel somewhere back there, just poking its nose through. Flavour is heavy on diacetyl butterscotch with a pleasant mineral bitterness on the finish."
"Pretty good session beer, perhaps not one of the more outstanding specialist beers but for a readily available session beer, this is hard to beat. Good characteristic flavour, good level of carbonation and a pleasant smell combine well."
"D - The smell is easily the beer thing about this beer. It has some nice characteristics but all in all it's a bit weak generally. I can't really see any reason to drink this again... the more I drink the less I like the sourness."
"Dr: A damned disappointment, especially coming from Shepherd Neame, a brewery I've enjoyed in the past. What happened?"
"Despite a fairly low ABV, I doubt I'd want more than on or two on any given day. It is very satisfying though, would be great as a fill-me-up with a light meal."
"Overall a very well balanced, very drinkable ale. Top notch!"
"Mouthfeel is good, although the beer is slightly watery. This isn't always a bad thing however, as I can see myself drinking this at the pub all night long, hence the high score on drinkability. Its worth trying to find this one at your local beer store."
"I had this on cask in England a year ago and I seem to remember liking this. Picked up a bottle today to try it again. Pours a copper-orange colour with nice white head. Nice head retention with lacing over some of the glass. Smells of bread and caramel malt, some earthy hops, and a weird metallic smell. Flavour is pretty sweet, with the metal being in the aftertaste. Good carbonation level. This would be a lot nicer if it wasn't for the off flavour, but it still is fine."
"Good hop and breadnotes. This mabey is not the best what the UK has to offer but i found it to be a very decent beer."
"D - Not the best from this brewery and gunned down by the Bishops Finger."
"Dark and cloudy color with very little carbonation. More like bubbles from the hand pulling. Very malty aroma and a very malty flavor this beer is somewhat unbalanced and not the most refreshing beverage I had but definitely worth getting. It goes great with fish and chips and just before a long nap."
"Cask: This one pours a clear, slightly darker amber color. There was 1 finger of an off white head. The nose is nice. There are malts, as well as some biscuity and toasty notes. Maybe some floral note also. The taste is very good. This one has a nice malt body, toasty, biscuity. Just a bit bitter. A very Nice ale!"
"Like a lot of British pale ales, the flavor is not bold or aggressive, but unlike many others, it didn't seem weak or watery, just subtle and understated. Very, very, drinkable and pleasant."
"This beer is a great example of how you can brew a delicious, flavorful nuanced beer with a lower abv percentage. A great pick for an evening at the pub."
"An enjoyable and sessionable English ale. Wish I could find this one locally."
"D: Smooth and refreshing. It would be easy to put a few of these down in a night. A quality brew that is typical of the style, but the midrange is just a shade too thin."
"This did not do it for me. Nothing bad, by any means. Just a little odd. Worth one try if you see it on cask. Though I think there are better options on cask."
"I reviewed anyway because if the beer is skunked it's because of the bottle. Punk IPA also had similar earthy hops but was sooo much better than this and cheaper."
"D-Probably the hoppiest beer I've had for awhile living over here...it was a welcome change of pace, and if I can remember where I bought this I'll get more."
"overall its a drinkable brew, with some interesting sweet notes about it - not too shabby, a smooth, sessionable beer, with only the smell as a real draw back"
"Notes: Better session beers are available, but it isn't bad. A little light. Good balance between malt and English hops."
"D: Quite an easy drinking beer, and low ABV even."
"Not a bad little English ale, almost leaning towards the bitter end of the spectrum. Not nearly as complex as the nose indicates, but still highly drinkable. Would be good for a football watching night."
"That incredible smell didn't translate into an overly hoppy brew taste, but lordy, it was still a great experience and something I will be buying again."
"MK"
"D: I did not feel the flavours were well developed here. It's not that hard to drink, but I wouldn't buy this again."
"As for drinkability, it's right on the cusp, you know? If it could just get over the hump in a few areas, it'd be a great beer. As it stands, it's a good beer worth trying. I'd try one in a pub, or maybe in a bottle again."
"D: This is a nice beer at the pub when you're just talking to the boys. One of these is nice, but then I like to have something else."
"Mouthfeel - smooth and refreshing. Slightly creamy and no coursness. A good medium level of carbonation"
"OVERALL: Not a bad brew just not all that impressive. There are more interesting choices out there, though this one is certainly worth a whirl if you're a fan of the style. In my view, this one needs a bit of a kick in the arse to get it moving."
"Malts were well balanced with a faint citrus ester and nice Kentish hops. It's a bit watery in the mouth but there's enough flavour to carry it to the end. If it weren't so bloody expensive in Oz I'd drink this all the time."
"Drinkability: had this by itself, so I didn't enjoy it as much as some of the other beers, but with dinner, it might improve the drinkability."
"Overall a decent drink, just not my favorite, especially for an English ale. Nice for something new though."
"Drinkability: The hops in this beer are too old, which seems a bit silly considering that this is a Kentish ale, but otherwise this is very nearly a world-class ale."
"Good showcase of British hopping, but not balanced enough and too fizzy to be an easy drinker."
"Palate: Harsh bitterness, low carbonation, long lasting pungent bitterness, medium low body."
"Smooth dry mouthfeel, nice and carbonated, exceptionally drinkable."
"A very good drop."
"On cask at the Speaker in London. I had a half pint with the lunch crowd and a bad of ""pork shavings."" It appeared clear orange, filled to the brim. The ale has a big nutty, walnuts and cashews along with sugar cookies and digestive biscuits. A bitter British hops aftertaste with dry toast finish close out this tasty beer."
"Final Thoughts: I though after seeing this beer pour, this was going to be a winner. However, as the skunk took over and the carbonation leaved me belching every couple of minutes I was disappointed. I dunno, I wouldn't recommend this beer to anyone, unless they really enjoyed a dry taste."
"D-Despite the initial high carbonation, this is a very drinkable bitter. Not the best out there, but definitely very decent."
"Drinkability - this is very flavourful. I wouldn't pound too many back in a row - it would trivialize it."
"Overall: lovely beer, light and refreshing, balanced. Not the best pale ale out there, but still great. High drinkability."
"Pours a nice coppery honey brown. I got a one finger white chunky head that doesnt last all that long. Coppery like smell with notes of caramel. Decent carbonation, taste is similar to the smell with a nice bitterness to it. The bitterness is well balanced and isnt overwhelming, making it pretty easy to drink. Overall, I thought it was a decent beer but not too sure if I would buy another."
"This isn't undercarbonated, but the bubbles feel miniscule on my tongue, giving an initial watery feel. This is a nicely savoury beer with the sweetness from the malt being curbed by the bitterness of the hops, leaving a rather earthy, maybe even slightly nutty flavour. Well coordinated, but certainly nothing to write home about. Certainly it would be a doddle to knock back a bunch of these: it isn't particularly substantial or in any way offensive."
"D= all night"
"Quite a light brew. Has some slight dryness and bitterness to it. A decent drinker. Alright if you can pick it up around 6 bucks a bottle, but not worth too much more."
"Sessionable and tasty, good drinkability."
"Very dark copper pour, with a decent, one finger thick foam top. Smells primarily of malts, with some herbal and floral hops, bit of toffee and caramel. Taste wasn't as sweet as I thought it would be. Light sweetness, with some caramel candy and toffee, balanced very well with a dry, grassy hop quality. Finishes a bit too herbal for, sadly. Almost seemed mediciney. Somewhat dry, with a medium body. Overall, a decent beer."
"Comes in a squat clear bottle that shows off the coppery amber hue. Upon opening, it is phenomenally carbonated, which I thinks rather impedes the mouthfeel. Apart from that, there is good flavor and body, a really quite dry bitter with considerable hop aroma."
"Would be nice to contrast this with a very fresh sample bottled in amber glass. Im still going to drink and more or less enjoy this, but its deficiencies are quite obvious and take alot away from the enjoyment of this brew."
"Overall: The malts and hops are well-balanced. Although the alcohol is average (4.5%), I felt that I was drinking a stronger beer. I could have appreciated Spitfire more if not for the very tart aftertaste."
"the beer pours a nice amber-red with a decent frothy head that fades quickly. the smell is pretty heavy on the sweet malts/caramel side with just a hint of hoppy bitterness at the finish. the taste is nothing special but pretty smooth. The sweeter maltier side is a lot more subdued than the smell indicated. so light hops and light malts are what you get. the mouthfeel is quite creamy and overall this is certainly a drinkable beer and pretty refreshing but it is ultimately nothing special and a little disappointing compared to other english ales that can be easily purchased."
"A decent, if not extraordinary ale, wouldn't be my first choice."
"Drinkable enough without being outstanding."
"Review translated from french 6-17-2008."
"The taste is lightly skunky but not as noticeable as the nose. Has a nice balance of malt and hops. Not something I would get again unless the bottles were changed to brown or I had the opportunity to have it on cask."
"The LCBO better not discontinue this one."
"Try this beer."
"A fairly easy drinking beer."
"A surprisingly stubborn beer, considering that it is one of the most common English ales available in Swedish pubs. One of my favourites."
"Overall, I like it. If I can find it again then I will drink it again."
"Pours a clear copper with an inch thick head. A bit metallic smelling, with a solid malty presence and hint of lemon and leafiness. Taste is on the assertive side, definite lemon tones and tartness.Bitterness follows but is a bit one-dimensional, seems a little unbalanced. Carbonation level is a bit high as well. Overall I have to say this is a quite aggressive EPA. Lots of flavour and carbonated bite, but lacks some sublety and balanced"
"I'd say for certain that this is my favourite of the Shepherd Neame range."
"D: Good, easy drinking, and tasty."
"If this was my local pint I would be more than happy"
"A tasty British pale ale. I tend to find most of the British pale's I try to be subtle and extremely drinkable. This one was the same. Had an almost tea like quality to it. This is certainly a beer that you could have a session with. Enjoyable... simple pleasure."
"D - Very good drinkability. One of my managers brought this back from England on the plane, the freshness difference is amazing in these English PA's. If I could get this as fresh every time I would drink this on a fairly regular basis."
"The Spitfire Kentish Ale pours a muted gold into the pint glass, solid 2-finger off white head caps the brew. The aroma is very floral/herbal with a mild spicy undernote. Toffeeish malt and biscuits initialy on the palate, the solid bitterness grips and follows through to the finish with some nice tree fruit flavours. Nice medium bodied mouthfeel, though maybe a touch spritzy. All in all a very tasty bitter. Big thanks to Mike for lugging this one back for me."
"M&D: overly fizzy on the mouthfeel and shows no sign of softening after quite many sips, making the drink slightly too stimulating for the relatively mild flavour and a surprisingly light body. The nose of this bottled version is perhaps clearer and more aromatic than the cask verion, but the flavour and structure is way below supposed performance.I'll rather stick to the casked Spitfire in the future."
"Great pub, by the way!"
"""Originally produced in 1990 to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of the Battle of Britain"". Spitfire is a spunky little English pale ale with loads of personality and an abundance of classic EPA flavor. I had a good time with this one."
"Very good beer. I got this by mail-order, since it hasn't been seen in Texas since the mid-90s. Wish they'd bring it back here."
"Pours a dark copper color with a tiny head. Smell is weak, but definitely has lots of nuts in it, like a brown ale. The taste is aggressively nutty like a nut brown, but a small hint of citrus in the finish. Quite refreshing and pleasant. Much more of a craft beer than I would have expected from this brewery. Water is also pretty evident in it, but it helps with the ease and makes it go down without a problem."
"Aggressive carbonation and lots of hops and dry bitterness. Brown but big hop bubbles are nice. My son liked it, it was Ok for lunch, but only a so-so. Some citrus, a little carmel and malt, nuttiness and grainiess. Metallic on mid sip. Medium mouthfeel."
"Taste: Very hoppy, actually I was quite surprised of this hoppy taste as I smelled none. A tiny finish of malt is present, but I find her taste to be rude actually, not very polished, reminds me of a raw beer. Agressive taste of hops followed by malt then nothing, nothing to balance and finish this beer."
"Bottle: Poured a nut brown colored ale with a nice off-white foamy head with average retention. Aroma is comprised of lightly roasted malt and bitter hops. Taste is better then your average bitter with some lightly sweet malt mix with biter hops leaving a clean dry taste at the end. Overall, an above the pack English bitter."
"Tasted amazing, malty sweet, caramel and crystal, a tad of dyacetal, a heap of hop (nowhere near an IPA, but good) but well balanced. Carbonation was clingy, and just right. A nice dry hoppy finish, lingering dryness, and a warm happy glow."
"Taste was unexpectedly bitter. After the initial hop bitterness, there's caramel on the palate and some graininess. It also has has an oiliness to it. A nice hop bitterness at the front and back of each sip. A good, traditional english ale. A solid beer."
"Drinkability is high. Nice beer, recommended. Very distinctive hop bittering."
"Not a bad ale, but not enough hops to appeal to me"
"Pours a clear copper with a steay flow of bubbles supporting a thin but persistent white head. Aroma is malty with bread, caramel, and some earthy hop notes. Flavor is simple but enjoyable... some caramely sweetness gives way to a lingering herbal bitterness. Mouthfeel is far too carbonated for the style... but settles a bit after a few minutes. Body is medium and the finish is dry. All in all, a pretty decent pale ale, but I'm sure it's much better on cask than in bottle."
"F"
"No after taste but light syrupy mouthfeel."
"Provisional, protein-rich grain flavors remind me of Rye Crisp crackers. I think that's a Scandinavian genre. Right? Rye Crackers?"
"I rate this as one of the better ales I tried without being a standout cut above the rest."
"My memory of Spitfire is two years old, so forgive me if it has managed to improve in my mind. Had this on tap in a pub in Peckham, in Southeast London. This was the only place I saw this, as I usually encountered Speckled Hen in most of the pubs I was able to frequent. I ordered it because I thought Spitfire was a superb name for an English beer, and therefore had to try it! Was a reddish amber color, if memory serves, with a nice, compact white head perched on top. Smelt of sweet malt and floral hops. Taste started with a malty sweetness that was subtle, not dominating, with the bulk of the taste created by the hops, which gave a satisfying, citrusy zip to the taste buds. I really like English bitters, and this one went very well with my bacon & Stilton hamburger and chips."
"Serving: 12 oz bottle."
"After some pretty bad Russian brews tonight, this is a fine way indeed to remind myself of why I like beer."
"A Bloody Jolly Good Show from those Kentish Chaps!"
"Found this one at Cork'n Ale back home in Saginaw,Mi,poured a nice copper color with medium head,has a hoppy aroma.Pretty dry ,appetizing taste with some nice bitterness.Very nice medium body,very drinkable,should have gotten more than one,I will be looking for more ales from this brewery for sure."
"I also had this one a the Wilton Arms pub in Westminster while I was recently on vacation there. This is truly and excellant brew. It poured and was deep brown with some ruby color also. It had a rich and creamy thick head. It smelled of flowery almost fruity hops. It was delicious to the taste. It was moderately complex and very flavorful. It was slightly fruity and had another flavor that I just couldnt quite figure out. It was smooth and extremely drinkable. If I ever encounter this brew again I will not hesitate to drink it and hopefully purchase it."
"Cool Bottle! I like the color it is when it pours out, a golden caramel color with a light colored head to it. The head doesn't stick around too much, but when it is around, it is nice. There is some settlement on the bottom of the beer, looks like syrup or something. Anyways, has a nice refreshing taste to it and doesn't dissappoint."
"Nearly carmely-ruby pour with minimal head. Smell is rather pleasant but also somewhat meek--a straightforward blend of hops and malt. Taste is heavier than expected, a bit syrupy though not unpleasantly sweet. Like the smell, the taste is dominated by the usual balance of hops and malt, with the flavor profile not changing much between start and finish. The more I drink, the more the medium-bodied malts seem to come through (i.e., this one improved as the glass emptied). Syrupy texture detracted from the mouthfeel a bit, but this is acceptably drinkable."
"Hoppy, sticky, slightly syruppy, and bland in the end, its OK,  but lacked something, nice and drinkable though, give it a go."
"I found this to be a somewhat lighter version of Bishops Finger Kentish Ale. This by no means is a detrement. This is a classic English ale."
"The Spitfire I had was in a British pub cask conditioned. Appearance wise it might be the most beautiful ale. A dark clear ruby color. Fruity tast with solid malt backbone. Subtle hopping. As with all cask conditioned brews it has a mellow smoothness and high drinkability. There is nothing like cask or real ale!"
"Notes: A classic Pale Ale and now, affordable. Most of Shepherd Neame's brews have dropped in price in order to compete with the wide varieties of U.S. beers, one would assume."
