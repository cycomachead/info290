3.68,2.8,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,"i always admire when simple ingredients and processes yield spectacular beers, and this is a great example of that. an english pale ale thats real hoppy, and not with tropical new world varietals, but with the classics. these beers are traditional for a reason, and i think the aggressive use of these hops make this beer awesome. the english ale yeast profile is minimal, and the grain base, while sturdy and appropriate, is not overly flavorful. it lets the hops do the majority of the work in the flavor, which i think is right on for the style, but also lets me taste these hops in higher doses than we usually get them. its bitter sure, but there is also a pear-like fruitiness to it in the finish, and a really clean aspect where they go away really quick for how flavorful they are. just a touch more honey sweetness from the grain than i need, and maybe a little more body too than i need for a beer i want to consume by the six pack, but the high carbonation and clean finish both help with drinkability. simple beer made right, i always appreciate that, and this is a good take on the style with that mentality. drink it close to freezing though, it loses some of its pop as it warms up.","StonedTrippin","Nov 23, 2014"

A nice balance between hops and malt - good hop bit up front and nice, mild citrus flavor. Smells malty with a slight tinge of piney hops. All in all a nice pale ale...it's billed as an English style pale ale, and it's closer to that than an APA...but it's definitely an American made English style pale ale but in a good way. A very sessionable ale at only 5% abv. This might be my new go to canned pale ale...much more to my taste than Sierra Nevada canned pale ale.","Jayhawk","May 23, 2013"

The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, earth, citrus, citrus hop, and a floral note. The flavor was of sweet malt, caramel, tobacco, citrus, citrus hop, earth, and subtle floral notes. It had a very light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. The flavors on this one were quite interesting to say the least. The tobacco aspect was really quite surprising on this one. Somehow it managed to blend in with the rest decently. The citrus was the saving grace for this one in my opinion.

Honestly, this seems to help matters a decent deal. The body is a heavy-ish light, with a light carbonation and a fluid feel.

With a bit of nostril detective work some caramel might be able to be pulled from the woodwork of this beer. The flavor consists mainly of a citrus explosion up front that degrades quicker than a snowman in a heatwave. The flavor quickly turns from sweetness into bitterness as is moves it's way back on the tongue then fades into obscurity on the back end. Aside from the bitterness the mouthfeel is spot on, and it would serve as an enjoyable beer for the price.

I'm not trying to be funny, or anything, this was just very weak in all respects. The freshness date on the bottle appeared to be 06-03-10, so I don't think that was the problem.

3.87,8.1,3.5,4,4,3,4,"Pours a very nice golden color, nice clarity, moving towards copper, but not quite that deep. The head is thin, off-white, but leaves pretty decent lacing. I actually kind of like the look of it, but it's not impressive. The smell has a nice leafy, kind of grassy hop presence, with a deep, but fairly light american hop aroma. Which is good, an APA, especially a <5% ABV one does not need to smell like a hop bomb. The malt presence is caramelly and sweet, a little powdery, also a slight toasty smell, almsot like pretzels. The taste is just as enjoyable as the smell. Starts off lightly bready, a bit cakey, but nice and dry and crisp. A good toastiness is present, too, a feature I really like in an APA. The hop profile is upfront leafy and herbal. Not very citrusy, which can be good in a beer like this. But there's a nice bite of orange in the middle, maybe some light grapefruit, but not much bitterness or resinous feeling. Finishes a little grassy, but a nice malty sweetness comes in, too. Though you do notice that it's a bit thin in the finish. That's really my only complaint. There's so much interesting going on, but the body is actually a bit thinner than expected. The carbonation isn't sharp, but you feel it in unexpected places and ways. Still interesting. And at this ABV, this one is easy drinking, but you'd never expect it to be so low based on the flavor. Really a very good beer. If it was around, I could possibly make it a staple-type beer.","taylorhamrick","Aug 04, 2009"

The smell is nondescript and boring, there is really nothing that stands out. The flavor seems to follow suit, a little bit of biscuit flavor but other than that it is completely boring. I am not saying this beer is bad at all because it is very easy to put down but it is just bland overall.","ArrogantB","Jul 29, 2009"

The attack is refreshing and displays a creamy mouthfeel for the beer. The hops presents itself late. The finish has some residual hoppiness in the mouth that carries through to provide a hoppy aftertaste. Drinking this beer is like a journey from the malty to the hops.

It has a nice, fine carbonation, pretty refreshing and drinkable enough. But to me it's more astringent than I normally would enjoy so I wouldn't call this highly drinkable. Pretty unique and tasted a little more palatable to me as it warmed, a little more of a malt hint came out to take the edge off the bitter hops. I just may not be so familiar with this style.

It's moderately bitter on the back of the tongue which leaves a pleasant aftertaste. The ABV for this beer seems low compared to others in the style and doesn't leave the warmth in the throat that I've come to associate with pale ales.

3.68,2.8,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Wicked-cool aluminum bottle with an image of a goat posing in a high-class traditional English golfing outfit. Obtained from Thompson Valley Liquor (Colorado)...thanks, Clint & Jeff! Pours a two-finger light yellow/tan head over a mildly cloudy rusty highligher colored liquid. Smells of oranges with mild grapefruit and honey. Not much in the nose actually and any malt sweet or fruity esters are too subtle for me to pick up. Not a promising start. Tastes of an interesting hoppy jumble, but again, the malt and esters are nearly absent. More hop flavored than hop bittered, which is appropriate for an APA. Hops are pithy grapefruit, oranges, and some tangerine. None are distinctly dominant, as they mix aroudn one appearing and then slipping beneath the other, before rising again. The g-pith is likely the most noticable. Caramel in the malt, which is actually a bit dry. A little bit of tang and sour...not green apple flavored, but catches your attention like a good sour apple. Some sweet esters do temper the caramel dry. A little bit of butter in the aftertaste pulls the beer downward. Md-light body and moderately carbonated. Some dextrinous quality about the mouthfeel that's pleasing and, IMO, really helps the simple flavors of this beer work positively. Nice lacing on the inside of the glass.","mentor","Nov 15, 2005"

Great for times when you want a really light beer, with full flavor. I dig this. The only pale ale that trumps this is poleeko gold, but that one usually costs more and is stronger.

3.51,-2,4,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1 1/2" off-white head above the orangey copper brew. Head fades, but settles at a nice frothy 1/2", with prevalent foamy lacing. Aroma is lightly of fruity hops and pale malt, but lacking here for the style. Taste is again the fruity hops, with a tinge of lemon, and mellow pale malt sweetness to balance. Mouthfeel is somewhat thin, but drinkability can hardly be faulted. Wouldn't be a bad session brew.","ppoitras","Jun 14, 2005"

4.12,15.1,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Original review 25 December 2004: The rich maltiness that dominates the nose of Big Sky's Scape Goat carries through in its flavor. It's sweetish, caramel-drenched maltiness is threaded with floral and lightly fruity hops that help to balance it and give it a dual character; and it's nicely backed by a solid bitterness that leaves it dry and refreshing in the finish. The head retention could be a bit better; but with its slightly restrained alcohol content; smooth medium body; rich caramel malt character; and great balance, this makes for an excellent session ale!","NeroFiddled","Dec 25, 2004"

The aroma has the character of hops that I don't like. Earthy and dirty is how I can best describe them. I'm not sure what they are, but I just don't like 'em. The flavor is hoppy and has a caramel malt flavor, but just doesn't do it for me. Mouthfeel is ok and drinkability is ok.","clvand0","Dec 09, 2004"

Lots of dirty APA hops mingling with some biscuit malts and a hint of caramel. Eh. I just don't find this combination appealing. The flavor is okay. There is a nice caramel that comes through, with hops and biscuity flavors on the finish. The feel is off. Way too thin on this beer. Its almost watery feeling. Not what I expect. Drinkability is okay. Its not the best beer I've ever had, but its not awful.","kmpitz2","Dec 07, 2004"

2.35,-34.4,3,3,2,2.5,2,"After loving the Moose Drool brown I figured I would give Big Sky another shot and check out their pale. The first sip greets you with malt and hops but some unwanted roasty flavors lingered around and resulted in a bad after taste. Not what I would expect from a pale. I thought it might have just been me but a few of the guys had the same beer with me and we couldn't finish them. We might have purchased a bad 6 pack, but I find this highly unlikely since we were in the town the beer is brewed in.","dren","Aug 16, 2004"

The appearance was really nice but I could tell by the smell that it was not as hoppy as I was hopung for. It is a very enjoyable and smooth beer, but not a great Pale ale.

3.85,7.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Clear bronze hue with coppery-gold highlights, there is plenty of animation to replenish the modest off-white head, it topped off at a half finger in height, which held well. Some lace was produced that was spotty and unorganized. The nose is just potent enough to whisper equal amounts of caramel-toffee and light piney hops. It is soothing and inviting, albeit simplistic. The palate is dry upfront, which is very pleasant, with kisses of hoppy bitterness, in the middle is a good amount of malty softness, sweet too, the finish is again dry with lingering piney notes from the hops. Undercurrents of nuts and yeasty fruitiness play well with the other flavors, occasionally citrus notes emerged too, more so in the aftertaste. This is a typical APA and there is nothing wrong with that, it is well brewed and quite yummy. Medium in body, the carbonation level is low but natural, it seems dead-on for this beer. As a whole this is a very good session brew and it would be something IÂ’d quaff often if it were available locally, I purchase mine in Sioux Falls, SD. Worth trying but you need not seek it out. It is a solid beer.","bditty187","Feb 05, 2004"

Aroma of biscuit malts and light fruitiness with very appealing musty yeast odor. The beer goes down effortlessly, with bright, sweet flavors followed by just a short sharp kick of hops which are neither especially bitter nor lasting. Mouthfeel really good; smooth and substantial without being thick. I was pleased with this beer and had no trouble finishing the glass.
