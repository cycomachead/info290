I love it on nitro, gives the body some life, and drinks like an old world classic. my first beer from green king here, and I look forward to trying more of the lineup, this is a really nice pub ale that deserves some attention. a fine all day drinker.","StonedTrippin","Jul 21, 2013"

The nose comprises lightly-sweet biscuit, mild greens, and light honey. The taste brings in more of the same, though everything is slightly milder, and there's a touch of grass in there for good measure.

Creamy nose feel with a sour, lactose edge, banana pudding and milk, green apples and pears, hard toffee candies, somewhat floral yet you can't really say there's any hop-driven bite, the malt seems to win by default, smattering of mixed spices, stutters too much. Medium-bodied, for all the fluff and creaminess cannot achieve deeper mouth presence, carrot and celery notes there as much as toffee, butterscotch or cocoa. The hops are weak and cannot come close to lending spine to the whole. Little bit of citrus, the carbonation is soft and kind of a wuss.

Mouthfeel is silky, lighter than medium, excellent hop bite, dryly citric and cracker-like aftertaste. There's some warmth going down as well. A basic but satisfying EPA, similar to the draught version of Headstrong Pale Ale. Good example of the style.","cratez","Apr 26, 2010"

Mouthfeel is a little thin and watery but this brew makes up for it in unique flavor. If this brew had a decent backbone it would be quite good.

My last beer from Greene King was Old Speckled Hen, consumed from cask (my first time - from cask, anyway!) at a pub on Denmark Hill in London. Maybe I'd have appreciated this more that way. It's a little too sweet for session drinking, and not interesting enough for me to go back to as a stand-alone beer, either. For a bit of atmosphere I grabbed the closest at-hand CD that happened to be by an English band. This turned out to be ELP's Tarkus, which is "busy" in a way that I think would work better with an IPA. Perhaps that's why I found myself wishing the hops were more assertive, instead of my palate being permanently corrupted by west coast-versions of the style!","woemad","Aug 03, 2008"

Ok, so I'm a sucker for a nitro. Light malt and hops nose drifts off the coppery brew. Smooth, smooth, smooth, with a taste of caramel malts and a late appearing hoppy bitterness. Not quite as good as when I had it on tap at British Beer Co. last spring, but I digress... Smoothness makes for great mouthfeel, and that combined with the taste makes for great drinkability.

Yes, the cascading affect is pleasant to look at but the widget is such an annoying gimmick. Anyway, the head settled at two fingers in height, very sturdy, the retention was fantastic. Also, the ensuing lacing was webby and active. The nose was lacking in potency, what I could detect was indifferent to the ol snout. There was some hints of fruity-malty sweetness, I cant help but think the nitrogen is masking some of the aromas. Wow, this is easy drinking! Obviously this was intended. The flavors are very weak, some vague maltiness, hints of fruitiness and marshmallows, clean and meager hop bitterness, and some sweetness is noticeable at the finish, as is a mineral twang. Abbot Ale easily defeats the Boddingtons Pub Ale abomination; too bad I cant get this in town as this would make a good session ale. Medium-light in body, a little watery, the carbonation is small and slick, as designed, Id say the mouthfeel is somewhere between good and tolerable. I picked up a nitro-can on a whim in Iowa City; it was a dollar at a grocery store. If I could find this locally at a reasonable priced Id buy it again, just to session with.

Almost reminds me of a German Alt or bock? Carbonation a little high, body a little thin. More malt than hops. I had a Fuller's ESB in between two of these, and it blew the Abbot away.

Carbonation is very mild. Lacing is excellent, leaving one solid sheet. Aroma is very nice, with decent, but not overpowering, caramel...some toasty pale malts, vanilla, and butterscotch. Mouthfeel is, of course, very soft and smooth, with a watery medium-light body. Taste begins with some warm graininess, malt huskiness, a subtle dry-cider note, a firm malt body, and just enough hops to balance them. The hops are very smooth and linger in the finish, nicely complementing the slight astringency of the grain husks and alcohol. Just a hint of alcohol makes itself noticeable in the finish. Thankfully, I'm not picking up on much metallic taste, as I have found most English Ales to be unpleasant in this regard. A very well done mild.","Mitchster","Mar 14, 2003"

The body is medium-light with a low level of carbonation and very fine bubbles from the nitrogen breakout. Very creamy in the mouth. The flavor is gently fruity upfront, revealing caramel and some buttery notes as it crosses the palate, and finishing nutty with some light residual bitterness.

Flavours are thrown around like junk in a cluttered house, clean but just in a scattered mess. Flavours of steeped hop tea, fruity with leafy hop all over. A drop of caramel and bready malt but the soft hop flavour keeps on coming back. Nitro starts to wear off a bit and then things seem to go thin and flat other than the hop flavour of course.
