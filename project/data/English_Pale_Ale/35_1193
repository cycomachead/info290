3.75,3.6,3.5,3.5,3.75,4,4,"O - Underrated English pale ale, and probably BBC's best regular offering. I remember enjoying these many moons ago and I am pleased to see how well this one has held up over time. Would love to see this included in variety packs over the lager. Not as good as the very best English Pales (Fullers, etc.), but solid nonetheless. I can see me picking up a few of these over the course of a year.","TempeBeerMan","Feb 09, 2015"

4,10.5,,,,,,"This isn't their original 'Boston Lager' at all as the label is different as well as the brew. This 'English Pale Ale' style brew pours a pretty clear copper-amber in color with about a 1/2 finger white head that settles down to around 2mm after a while. A decent amount of lacing is seen when sipped that sticks to the glass. The aroma is very pleasant and is of grains, biscuit, with a hint of caramel also. More going on with the taste with a hint of fruit (dark?) also. Finishes just a tad dry but good. Actually, wasn't sure how this brew was going to be overall. Medium-bodied with perfect carbonation. Overall, it was good and probably even better on tap.","BeerWithMike","Nov 17, 2014"

3.68,1.7,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, best before 7/2014. Pours slightly hazy bright orange copper color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, light nuttiness, golden raisin, pear, apple, herbal, floral, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with well balanced dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, light nuttiness, golden raisin, pear, apple, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Light earthy herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, golden raisin, pear, apple, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Nice balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice English pale ale. Well balanced dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jun 09, 2014"

APPEARANCE: thick white head the consistency of carwash soap--remains two fingers well after pour; copper orange body with vibrant carbonation--a looker... AROMA: sweet caramel aroma; fragrant hops are bright, soft and alluring without being distinguishable... PALATE: solid, medium-bodied with slight effervescence; highly drinkable, with zero suggestion of alcohol...TASTE: sweet caramel delivers underneath a mellow, soft pine flavor; a stereotypical ale (?), one to set expectations to... OVERALL: a recipe that wins in its simplicity--some bubblegum late in the glass adds to its otherwise "stock" profile--shout-out to neighbor Scott for bringing it over!","dacrza1","May 06, 2014"

They tend to get a bad rep for some sub-par brews that take the "craft" label and, in my opinion, tarnish what craft beer can be for newcomers. However, this brew make for a delicious sixer at a reasonable price. My mind sees it as a more complex (and sweeter) version of a stock Newcastle. Certainly not the best beer on the planet, but damn good for the style. Bravo Sam Adams.","mscudder","Aug 11, 2013"

3.83,5.8,4,3.5,3.75,4,4.25,"Bright copper in color, quite clear with a two finger head after the pour that falls to leave a thin layer of fine bubbles and laces a bit. The smell is of caramel and biscuit malts with a bit of citrus and floral hop. The caramel malts are the leader in the taste as well with a full range of smooth buttered biscuit tastes. The malt is balanced by enough earthy floral hop flavor and bitterness to keep things under control and from becoming overly cloying or too sweet. This is a very smooth beer almost creamy in the mouth due to the perfect level of carbonation and its malty nature. In the end this is a really great session beer not challenging by any stretch of the imagination but that is part of what makes this so good. It is simply a great ale that you could literally drink all day without tiring of it.","fank2788","May 25, 2013"

I'm not sure what I mean by that, but it's almost the metallic bitterness that I get in canned beers that have adjuncts. I don't get it on every sip, but when it comes in, I don't care for it that much. The feel on this one is very good... makes this beer super drinkable. Medium carbonation, and a medium-light body with it. After taste is a lot like Boston Lager with crackery flavors. To be honest, I prefer Boston Ale to Boston Lager... I'm surprised it took me so long to try this beer. Really, really nice, and for a super reasonable price.","Alextricity","Mar 14, 2013"

The mid-palate follows with some malt character, not quite as balanced as on the nose. Biscuit, caramel and Vienna malt are present, though it does feel a little watery here. Drying and quite bitter on the finish with dried herbs, and a level of Hallertauer bitterness that almost seems overdone. Medium-light in body with moderate carbonation, this beer is quite nice.

Bready and malty, with only a light hop presence evident in the finish. Easy to drink, but not the most exciting flavor. I would prefer a bit less sweetness in favor of some hop bitterness and/or biscuit flavors. Decent feel. Light to medium bodied.

The taste really holds up on this beer, it’s very balanced and while there’s not all that much going on except for some caramel malts, is never fads during the mouthful nor does it taste to watery. I don’t usually drink the Boston Ale as I prefer to go for something that has more flavor but this beer really holds up and doesn’t fall apart which I find to be quite rare for a generic non-flavored ale. Certainly something to have around for a refreshing day.","codysjb","Oct 14, 2011"

The hops that are present in the style are there but not as "forward" as other types. A bit of spiciness too. Mouthfeel is very smooth. I think I would prefer its cousin, the SA Pale Ale, over this.

In the future, I would love to do a side-by-side tasting because I'm not sure if I experienced some sort of "memory bias" during the tasting.","diabecktic","Mar 09, 2010"

Six packs seem to be rare, although I always seem to get a few Boston Ale bottles in a mix pack or the like. It's a shame since I really like this Sam Adams classic. Pours light amber in color and leaves a light lacing on my standard pint glass. These are very drinkable and as many others have stated, I wish this one was easier to find on tap.

A very good looking beer. For this style of beer, it's incredibly malted in my opinion and it really shows in the smell. It has a sweet caramelized/toffee smell followed by some earthy pine hops. Really well balanced in the smell, pretty impressive. The taste is much like the smell. Sweet initially from the caramelized malts has a toffee and buttery taste as well then the hops follow to provide a nice flavor. It's an incredibly well balanced ale. It's I'd say medium bodied, but I must say I'm impressed on how light it feels for how well malted it is. It has a buttery smooth feel that has a nice bitter finish from the hops. With all that's going on it's really drinkable. I'd love to have it on tap on a nice hot summer day.","AndyAvalanche","Feb 11, 2010"

I don't know if my palate has become jaded, but this just doesn't seem as good as I remember. I don't know if Sam Adams quit brewing this for a while (there seemed to be quite a few years I never saw it) and then brought it back changed or what.

The flavors were a little off balance, the first flavor was the semi-sweet caramel malt followed by some nuttiness and roasted malt.

The carbonation is modest and what is most impressive in this beer is the creamy mouthfeel, medium body, big malt flavors, and the nice balance with some hops in the finish. The beer isn't brilliant, but it is an old standby for most any occasion. The maltiness is a bit carmelized, somewhat bready, definitely creamy in texture, and maybe a tad bit of spice, but that's hard to detect. The beer hits all the right notes, and the malts are neither overdone, nor too thin. Again, the balance is what makes the beer, rather than any fancy tastes, spices, or frills.

Hops were less evident, but still earthy, maybe a bit spicy as well. The body was on the light side, carbonation moderate, with a creamy texture and light dryness. Overall, a well made beer.

Hop aroma is low, just a bit of spicy hop aroma. The beer has an initially caramel sweet taste, yet still balanced by hop bitterness. After the initial sweetness, the beer turns and finishes dry and almost wine-like, there also seems to be a bit of a metallic after taste. The carbonation is moderate with a medium body and somewhat smooth. Overall I found this beer to be decent, not the best beer from Sam Adams. It is an attractive looking beer, has a good balance, but I really do not care for the finish. I dont know if the wine-like, metallic finish and after taste is intended by yeast strain selection or an off-flavor.

A lighter flavor for Sam, but as in all their selections this is a very balanced beer. I can appreciate this even though it does not necessarily fit the style of beer it is titled to. The taste is driven by a slight taste of hops which is more apparent in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is again balanced and really hits the spot. The lighter feel and weak flavor actually compliment each other here with a powerful aftertaste which allows for easy consumption.

Rich flavor compared to a macro lager, light for an amber ale, and slightly off for an APA. Of course, it's actually a "stock ale." Makes me wish I were drinking the boston lager instead, though.

Nice, somewhat carmel like flavor. Definate hop bitterness to it. Reminds me of a mellowed Sam Adams. Good enough mouthfeel. Damn drinkable. I have had this several times at my local Uno Grill.

It's definitely a wave of butterscotch and toffee that comes to a very bready and sweet finish. The mouthfeel is fairly thin, which makes this very easy to drink while still having enough body to hold the flavors well.

There was zero head retention and its mouthfeel was a bit flat (I liked this since I am a big fan of cask drawn bitters - wonder if this would benefit such treatment ... wishful thinking for a macro), though I did have this served to me at a Sam Adams airport bar, so a quality pour was not expected. Though the beer wasn't my preferred style, I would recommend trying it out for yourself. It's an easy drinking beer that would go well with bar fare or a night out with the boys.

The mouthfeel is rich and heavier than what I'd expect from an APA. The beer is definitely drinkable, but it took me some time to get over my expectations for an APA. I don't think this beer fits the style very well and think it might be a stretch to even call it an English Pale Ale.

Nose has strong notes of caramel and an earthy aroma which i can't pin down. Taste is a bit of a dissappointment in the hop department. Sweet malts dominate this APA, in fact it tastes more like an extremely mild EPA. More piney hop notes come out as the brew warms but not nearly enough to redeem it. I've had much better Sam Adam's brews and I'm hoping this was just a fluke.","soper2000","May 28, 2005"

An easy drinking American Pale Ale that would be excellent as a transition or gateway beer for new converts.

I've recently been reminded by this beer and their new black lager that they make some damn fine stuff. This one pours a drab iced-tea amber color with highlights of red and orange. A bit of white bubbly head. Smell is nice and malty, soft and sweet, with some dusty hops thrown in. To me, this tastes like maybe it has an English-style influence even though it's technically classified as an APA. Nice soft malts and mellow sweetness. A little biscuity buttery taste and some toffee, which is what reminds me of an English ale. This beer does have a typical APA style hop profile; a little bitter, piney, and nicely citrusy and fruity. I find that the hop characteristics mesh really well with the sweeter maltier side. A really well balanced beer actually, I'll have to remember that I like this stuff.","twelvsies","Apr 04, 2005"

This is a carmel, dark orange ale with a 3/4 white head that left lace when it died down (about a minute). After the creaminess there is a smooth segue into the hop bite that lingers for good long while. This beer is highly drinkable.

The aroma is sweet from a good amount of malt with nice spicy and toasted highlights.

Malts come upfront with a hint of sweetness, then mixes with some hops in the middle, then blends in with some toasted flavors all the way through the end. For once this is balanced somewhat.

This visit saw some SA Boston Ale in the fridge, one of the few SA beers I've not tried. Poured a clear and bright amber in color, with a long-lasting thin layer of white head that does a good job of hanging around and lacing the glass. Aromas of malt step up first, but there is an earthy/grassy hop note as well. Flavor is quite tasty, and very well-balanced between the sweet malts and the bittering hops. Finishes quite clean, with not much of an aftertaste. Good creamy mouthfeel. A great session beer. My favorite SA beer to date.","OldFrothingSlosh","Feb 28, 2004"

That said, this beer is very pretty in itself: orangy-gold with a white foam head. At first it seemed a little overcarbonated, but that wore off as it mellowed in my mug. All these wonderful ales I'm drinking these days are turning me to the dark side (aka, those who like hops) and this beer has a nice amount of the stuff for a "beginning hop-head". It's tasting better and better, too, as it gets warmer. Hats off to another nice BBC brew.","AndIWantYou","Feb 24, 2004"

The aroma yields sweet caramel and citrus malts (lemon) and some other fruity notes, including ripe apples. The taste is buttery smooth and mellow, almost creamy. Theres a bitterness here but its barely detectable. Nice body of creamy butter malts and slightly caramelized grains. Creamy and delicious. Very nice.","pezoids","Feb 24, 2004"

While no head made it to the table, it did lace alittle in spots. The aroma was sweet grain with hints of both caramel and hop. The taste starts out abit sweet, malty caramel and grain. Not over-done for its followed by a crisp clean hop that lingers and leaves the mouth with a slight bitter feel. A decent beer to be had with the Uno menu. I set out to try this beer/place.

It pours a dark amber with an off-white head that seems to hang around long enough to get a little lacing down the first third of the glass (Depending upon how fast you drink it, of course). There is more ester present in the aroma than the lager due to an ale yeast being used, and there are less citrus overtones. I love the mild floral note from the goldings. The taste is crisp with a caramel sweetness from the crystal malt. The hops provide slight bittering and a slight hoppy flavor. This beer has good body from the crystal, and a decent amount of carbonation.","PartyHatjo","Feb 05, 2004"

The first sip was pretty unimpressive, but subsequent sips revealed a slight hop flavor as well as a slight sour/metallic taste that stays with one as a bitter aftertaste. Still, it was a pretty good brew. Light-bodied but with too much carbonation, perhaps to mask flavor. I would say this is a good session beer, but I'd rather not spend any more time at UNO's than I have to, particularly if I've been dragged there.","twilight","Jan 17, 2004"

Malt leans toward a heath bar toffee, creamy carbonation carries the first impression well and leads the beer into a nice hop balance -- sweetened orange, perfumey, and not shocking. Agreable finish and aftertaste. Not a challenging beer but it may be one of Sammy's best session Ales. As a product, it may have lost out on the early promotion front to the Lager because of an early public's wariness of "Ale" as a word.","ADR","Aug 28, 2003"

The taste is reminsicent of the lager, and I feel as if the blend of hops is similar, only this is brewed as an ale.

As I removed the liquid some lace was produced albeit in an unorganized manner. The bouquet is pleasant with biscuit toastiness, vague earthy sweetness, notes of butter, and clean hoppiness. It is a very inviting and contrasting nose. The palate is exceedingly friendly with a perfectly balance of toasty biscuit malt, crackers, a distant note of fruit, earth, mineral water, tangy hops with perfect bitterness (modest in attitude). The finish is long and dry, kind of husky but savory. The mouthfeel is largely uneventful, the carbonation is firm and the body is smooth and a little thin. It is plenty easy to drink and damn enjoyable too! This is a terrific session beer and a great companion to steak or burgers. This is another winner from Sam Adams. It is well worth trying.

Toasted malt dominates the flavor also, with more nutty and biscuity notes. The hops are fairly mild but lend a bit of citric and earthy flavor to the finish.

Taste of lightly roasted sweet malts comes through up front followed by a strong herbal and spicy hop bite. Yet, despite the raw hop leaf flavor, the beer only has a mild level of bitterness.

Then recently I tried SA's Boston Lager which I believe has gone downhill as of late, around the time they switched the labels and started promoting SA Light. Well I was a bit worried for Sam Adams but someone got this for me at the grocery store and this beer is still doing just fine, as good as I remember it from last summer. A basic pale ale with quite characterful malts, severely sweet at the beginning, but then a restrained amount of hops kicks in, mellowing and unifying the beer. Great big head, perfectly tempting aroma, somewhat thin mouthfeel. Fresh and on the warmer side, very yummy; a fine beer that anyone could like. I would like to see more brewers age their pale ales to get a mellower effect like they claim to do here. Koch and co. should be promoting this instead of the Light or Boston Lager.","Thrasher","Feb 04, 2003"

Big malt nose, fresh and clean and lightly sweet, front malt sweet and the top middling in mouth feel.

The head on this beer was quite large, and remained so for a while.  The overall head retention and appearance of this beer was magnificent.  This beer had a great aroma, a nice silky mouthfeel and a great flavour.  This has to be one of Sam Adams' most drinkable beers, everything is done right here.

There's really a nice hop nose on this beer.  An herbal, yet also perfumey blend which melds nicely with the malts on the nose.  I really like the taste of this one.  Smooth and mellow caramel malt profile really provides a nice backbone.  The hops are equally important.  They add some herbal spiciness.  A nice blend.  Body is about medium-full.

The flavor starts with a firm malt and bitterness, allowing some hop flavors to come into play towards the swallow. Well balanced. The finish is short lived with a moderate bitterness and mineral-like hop flavor resting in residual malt sugars.

I'd like the hop bite to linger through the finish of the beer, but then I'd also like to have a Ferrari 360 Modena.  Such is life.  Mouthfeel is a bit watery, though has some smoothness to it.

Outstanding balance between the hops and the malt in the mouth. They are both there, working in harmony. Smooth, rich mouthfeel. Bottle doesn't list recipe, but it  seems like there might be some chocolate or roasted malt. A neglected star in the Sammy galaxy. The seasonals, the experiments, the Light and the Lager get the pushes, but this one deserves more attention.

The hop character is as assertive as in the lager, but somehow smoother and spicier due to the English and Czech hops and ale yeast, versus the German hops and lager yeast in the other beer. If you want to try a slightly stronger, fruitier, more complex and less grassy tasting verson of the Boston Lager, this is the one. This is good, well crafted beer.

Even in a bar or restaurant where they sell Bud Lite by the tankerload, you can usually count on a bottle of SA lager in the cooler.  For some reason, I just never got around to trying SA's stock ale (distracted by more exotic lures, I guess).  Now I'm kicking myself for ignoring this tasty ale for so long.

The Beer Advocate, Todd A., hits the nail on the head when he said this was a perfectly balanced beer.

The mildly grassy and floral hop nose is accompanied by a mellow and pleasant diacetyl note, as well as crystal malt sweetness.  Yeast esters are minimal.  Boston Ale is very clean all around in flavor profile.  The moderate hop bitterness is well balanced by a firm maltiness and fairly dextrinous body.  The hop flavor is quite earthy w/ a mellow floral note, and isn't overbearing.  Lots of biscuit malt flavors in the somewhat dry finish.  Although much cleaner and less estery than a good British pale, this makes for a good session brew if you're into British hop flavor.","marc77","Apr 09, 2002"
