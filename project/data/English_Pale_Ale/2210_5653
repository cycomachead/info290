What starts toward a straightforward amber ale finds a better balance with earthy hops and barrel wood adding complexity and offsetting much malty sweetness with a crisper, drier finish.","HipCzech","Tuesday at 07:27 PM"

The body is substantial though not really very heavy--a beer than be quaffed in certain circumstances, but not one after the other. One of the best Firestones I've had. They've got the English ESB style down pat in this beer.","allengarvin","Jun 12, 2014"

Not a whole lot going on there. Flavor follows with big time malt kicks, caramel, biscuits, with some definite pine bitter to balance alongside. Mostly highlighting the malts but definitely not a super sweet beer. Slick mouthfeel with medium-to-high carbonation.

Malty, earthy subdued hops. Slight bitterness. It's a little too rich for a pale ale imo. But much better than the one I had that was stale.","utopiajane","Jul 26, 2013"

The nose comprises mild biscuit, flowers, very light seaweed, and a kiss of honey. The taste brings in more of the same, with a slightly stronger and breadier malt backbone. The body is a light medium, with a light carbonation and a smooth feel.

I love the caramel flavors and breadiness of this beer. Hops are rather mild in character, but provide a fine bitter balance. I would like a little less toast in the flavor, however. Mouthfeel is excellent. Fluffy with soft bubbles and a not-too-heavy or thick body. This is a very English tasting pale. I really like it.","goochpunch","Apr 07, 2013"

Drinkability is above average - not a lot of selection at the bar so it was easy to have another without noticing. It's more hoppy than a typical English Pale Ale, and it has more citrus bite than I was expecting for an English pale, but as I said in the taste comments above, it's like a West Coat take on an English Pale Ale and it works. Not amazing, but definitely above average and worth a try.","damndirtyape","Apr 03, 2013"

Overall this is a superbly balanced ale and if you've got any affinity for English style ale this is a great choice -- if you can forgive the carbonation, which in the case of this 22 is too high for the style.

However, the hops are taking only a balancing role here, and I personally think that they should dial up the English hops (maybe use Fuggle) at the end of the boil. That would make for a better English Pale. Though I can't argue with what their doing since they have won a ton of awards from this beer.

Pours lightly hazy orange amber color with a nice 2 finger dense cream colored head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Good foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of caramel, toast, orange zest, biscuit, herbal, floral, earth, nuttiness, and grass. Nice aromas with good balance, decent strength and complexity; quite pleasant. Taste of caramel, toast, biscuit, nuttiness, herbal, floral, earth, and light orange and grapefruit. Light spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, biscuit, nuttiness, herbal, and light citrus on the finish for a short bit. Fairly dry on the finish. Good flavor balance between toasty flavors and hop flavors; and fairly robust feeling. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a really nice English pale ale. Nice flavor balance with a good amount of fairly robust flavor; extremely smooth to drink. Really enjoyable.","superspak","Aug 31, 2012"

A pleasant aroma of subtle oak, light notes of vanilla, and hints of caramel. Very unique mouthfeel. Slightly syrupy on the edges that lends to a brew that is fairly medium bodied especially for a pale ale, however the carbonation is crisp and clean. Extremely smooth, coats the mouth. Caramel, toffee, vanilla, charred oak, herbs and flora, and bread crust can all be found in this brew. Subtle, but extremely complex. Frankly much more complex than countless brews with better ratings. This brew is a true triumph.","chanokokoro","Aug 11, 2012"

Appears a classic pale ale coppery brown with a soft creamy head. Smell is average EPA but the oak really stands out. The mouth feel is soft and smooth. The flavor seems to combine a traditional english ale with a cali PA to make something memorable, especially if you like beers aged in oak. The guys at Firestone really created an outstanding beer out of a simple style with this one.","BenHesk12","Feb 14, 2012"

Overall it's pretty solid, but I realize now that I prefer a lot of other stuff by Firestone much more. I can see why they call this an English Pale Ale... it certainly has many characteristics of one. The look is spot on for the style. Dark amber hue, good clarity, looks pretty in the glass. The nose has a bit of "medicine" smell to it, mixed with perhaps some herbal tea. I used to find this smell nasty, but I do enjoy it in some beers now. Taste... has a very "tea like" taste, some bready malt, and some slightly bitter hops that come through on the end. I find the taste to be very English. Mouthfeel has good carbonation, but perhaps does feel a bit full for the 5.0% alcohol. I do enjoy this beer a lot, but I don't think it's a regular drinking beer, and I think it works better as an occasional deviation.","ely2000k","Feb 02, 2012"

It's hard to find a fault in it... I'm unsure what others are tasting, but this is really what I'd hoped it would be when I purchased it.

Carbonated feeling stays in the mouth well after the sip is complete. Full bodied mouthfeel, which is nice. At only 5% this is a good session beer for someone trying the PA style. Not overly bitter or malty...right in the middle. Unfortunately there was no "wow" factor for me.

The flavor combined a complementary balance of fruit and malty breadiness that was well balanced by the subtle hop character. The only problem was that these flavors weren't strong enough to keep the beer interesting to drink. Carbonation was medium, but suited the character of the beer. The careful balance of good flavors and the lack of any offensive flavors makes this beer extremely drinkable. I would definitely recommend it for a session beer.","Sutardja","May 16, 2009"

It's more malty than hoppy, with a little grassy hop bitterness at the finish. Some heft in the mouthfeel, and while it looks fizzy, the carbonation level is A-OK.

Interesting clear amber with just a hint of (pink? copper?) color; small foamy head that left a hint of lacing along the way. Very slight malt and a hint of fruity hops in the nose, but the taste was extremely fresh and balanced. Nice, light carbonation and the malty body matched the subtle hops perfectly.

Fruity, caramel flavours hit first as the malts dominate, before the hops make themselves felt wuth an earthy character. The crisp finish returns to fruitiness and light brown sugar. Just the perfect combination of flavours for a solid drink whenever, wherever brew. Nothing really challenges the palette, yet there's huge kudos for the soothing, drinkable and familiar flavours that this one brings to the table. Medium-light body and carbonation, but very smooth on the tongue. As I've already touched upon, there is huge drinkability here.

On the palate it is a rich malty brew with lots of character, very balanced. The finish is slightly drying and medium thin. Overall it is an enjoyable amber, but nothing noteworthy.

The caramel flavors stand out along with slight buttery hints, and a big malt profile. The hops give some bitterness, spiciness, and citrus qualities, but also offer perfumy, pungent, pine character as well. The body seems a bit light for anything called 'double barrel'.

The initial impression was that this is a nicely balanced beer that is gently hopped, the flavour a bit restrained but a clean finish, perhaps a bit nutty, unsalted cashews. The label boasts of having used toasted oak barrels.

In college I'd purchased six-packs of it, but my palate hadn't really developed to where I could say much about it. However, a few months ago, I had the pleasure of tasting it from a keg at my wedding (best man had purchased it for me). It definitely doesn't fit the profile of the many California brews that are overwhelmingly hopped. It pours a very deep amber, with a head that recedes quickly. The carbonation is very nearly what I would consider ideal for this type of beer. This had a hint of bitterness in the sip, but it seemed to warm in the mouth and finish with a chewy sweetness. The taste reminded me of a good Scottish ale, where the malts complement the bitterness in such a way that it avoids the sort of cloying sweetness that so many amber ales seem to fall prey to. All in all, an excellent beer for a session if you can find it on tap, Less so in the bottle.","terrapinchris","Oct 08, 2007"

Found on many store shelves here in California, and from the tap at many central Californian eateries, this is a handsome ale that pours a caramel brown with light carbonation and a similarly light head that will in all odds fade before you are half way into your glass. Nevertheless, this brew aged in oak barrels grants the imbiber a soft mouthfeel, sweet and nutty flavour, with an ever so delicate hint of hops. If I were ever to call a beer well-balanced, this would be a prime candidate.

(both beers are not as hoppy as I expected but that's not necessarily a knock). The malt character seems both toasty, slightly caramelly, and also full-bodied as well (that kind of German, solid malt character that reminds you of sweet without actually being sweet).

Aroma is lightly of grain husks, with a touch of fruitiness. Taste is hearty medium malts, with a citrusy close. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both good, with the latter possibly even more so. This seems quite sessionable, and a nice brew.","ppoitras","Jan 26, 2005"
3.95,7.9,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Tasted on tap at a Mexican Restaurant in Cambria, CA on 12/28/04. Pours a typical amber brown with slight reddish hints with a large, creamy head- much larger than seen on many ambers. Aroma is roasty malty, and the flavor follows through with a nice balance of hops at the end- not strong, but definetly present. Definitely drinkable- nothing outrageously wonderful, but pretty good. I had a chance to pick up a six pack on the way home, but passed, not because I didn't like it; there's plenty of good, similar amber ales around.","Dukeofearl","Dec 29, 2004"
3,-18,3,3,3,3,3,"Pours with a one-fingered off-white head that fades slowly and leaves traces of lace. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Cloudy amber color. Nose is slightly malty. Starts with some sweet undertones and finishes with a even mix of hops and malt. $1.79 for a 12oz bottle.","jdhilt","Dec 23, 2004"
2.6,-29,3,3,2.5,2,2.5,"Poured a light brown with an almost offwhite head which subsided quickly leaving a little lace. The aroma was malty with a a healthy dose of fruity esters and reminded me of aromatic malt or some other mildly roasted malt. The initial taste was sweet with the hops playing a minor role in the flavor and bitterness. The majority of the flavor was of a clean blend of dry, roasted malts and sweeter pale malts with a touch of a citrussy and flowery hop flavor at the end. I think this is a little too close to the pale ale style for me while the brewery calls it an amber ale i like a little more malt complexity in my ambers than this one can provide. An average pale ale this brew makes a mediocre amber ale and the folks at Firestone should work on the recipe a little more.","RenoZymurgist","Dec 10, 2004"
3.91,6.8,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Drinkability: The oak barrel brewing system adds a nice complexity to this amber; not as much as to overtake the taste, but merely to compliment it. This is a fine example of an English-style ale brewed in california","IceAce","Nov 14, 2004"

3.9,6.6,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Thanks to UncleJimbo for this one. Boy, I needed a brew this evening after work, and lo and behold, this was sitting in the fridge. Nothing extraordinary about it's looks: medium to dark amber, not cloudy per se, but not crystal clear either. About 1/2 inch of cream colored foam at the pour, since gone down. Aroma seems thick and syrupy, of toasty malts and quiet hops. Carbonated mouthfeel full of small, prickly bubbles. The mouthfeel is a plus...I appreciate the level of carbonation. Tastewise, I am picking up low malt (although it's made with 5!), slightly biscuity. The beer concentrates on the end taste/finish (which is fine with me). That one is all about some slight puckery citrus. I can't believe the carbonation in this one! Probably helps it not come across as syrupy. Would drink again. Not stupendous, but I like the mouthfeel.","PatandDavid","Oct 15, 2004"
3.68,0.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Pours a nice copper/amber with an ample fluffy head that settles almost into a creaminess leaving a thin sheet of lace,mild aromas of some toasted malt and caramel pretty soft on the nostrils.Caramel taste up front is the first thing I notice with biscuity malt backbone seems to have a little minty spice in the finish wich is nice,a pretty sweet tasting brew with not much hop presence.I think a decent session style ale but it might get a little to sweet after a few.","oberon","Sep 23, 2004"

The smell was malty and yeasty with a light, fruity sweetness and a touch of caramel. The taste was lightly fruity and malty with a good touch of hop bitterness, and a bit of oakiness as well. The mouthfeel was smooth and dry and hoppy with a slight astringency. The body was medium with medium carbonation. There was a lingering hoppiness in the aftertaste. This was a decent amber/red ale.","UncleJimbo","Aug 01, 2004"
3.63,-0.8,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"From a 12 ounce bottle, it pours a nice-looking deep orange with a fairly thick head. The smell is mostly summer fruit, with just a bit of hops. The taste is pleasant but not really remarkable in any way. It's just a bit on the sweet side; perhaps another helping of hops would improve it a bit. It's quite drinkable and would probably be a good choice when looking to move friends out of macros and into ales.","mickeymac","Jun 29, 2004"

3.62,-1.1,3,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Sampled from a 12oz bottle. Pours a deep golden brown and makes a thin white head. Lots of cereal malt character in the nose, not much in the way of hops. Flavor is spicy and sharp, slightly bitter and has a syrupy-sweet malt character. Leaves a creamy coating in the mouth. Rather drinkable, overall above average for the style. I really wish the typical macro brew tasted like this.","kmcnair","May 23, 2004"
3.35,-8.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,"From the bottle pours a clear dark amber color with an off white foamy head. The head stayed for a little while, and there was a decent amount of lace on the glass. Nice roasty smell combined with a touch of smoke. Taste first of caramel malt that has been toasted, with some slight hop bitterness. The end was slightly smoky and earthy, with a dry finish. Seemed a bit thin, and overcarbonated. Overall, not bad. Certainly a good idea, I could have gone for a bit more of an oak flavor, but I would not pass this one up.","Bierguy5","May 19, 2004"

Great session brew.","WetCoaster","May 06, 2004"

4.1,12,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Deep amber color, airy head that shrunk a bit, lacing was o.k.. Musty aroma that was malt dominating, not much hop aroma, some nuttiness. Very smooth, woodsy, malty, did I say smooth? Full bodied yet refreshing. A very English like ale. Quite drinkable. I think this might be more of a cooler weather brew, but it went down nice on our 12th day in a row of unseasonable warmth. Nice beer.","Mark","Mar 20, 2004"

Some hops in the finish, but fairly subtle. I only planned on having a couple tonight, but I'm on my 4th of the sixer, and don't like the chances of the other two lasting very long.
