4.31,21.8,4.25,5,4.25,3,4.25,"By far the best Pale Ale I've ever had.  It has a great look out of the bottle - amber hue - although not much of a head or lacing.  The smell was just superb - not your run-of-the-mill pale ale scent.  Mouthfeel was okay, too carbonated for my taste, but speaking of the taste, it was great.  Hints of fruitiness to go mix quite well with the bitterness of the ale.  Overall, I consider this the best Shipyard offering I've had to date.","jjamadorphd","Mar 28, 2015"

There is a dry saltene cracker like finish to the beer, with a slightly sweeter buttery malty middle, with a touch of dry caramel throughout. There is a nice balance to the beer, but the buttery toffee, the dry caramel, the yeast consistency, and the salty finish have Shipyard written all over it.

During the drinking, there was no brewer's lace either. S: Slightly piney, or floral, but not overpowering. Actually, the smell was one of a dated beer, but only partially. T: Despite my average A & S, the taste, really the most important part of the review, was enjoyable. A slightly thin drinking pale ale, closer to a "bitter" or an ESB in my opinion. Not as hoppy as many of the newer pale ales, but very enjoyable. Really, this is closer to a session ale for me. When Shipyard started brewing, this beer was probably considered "hoppy". Now many other breweries have passed it by in the rush for hop domination. M: Again, the word thin comes to mind for the mouthfeel. D: Drinkability is very good, as I could have many of these.

This as my previous taste appears to be a definite east coast (more English) pale ale v. a West Coast Pale ale. A refreshing change from the cascades, yet tasty and highly imbibeable.

Some pale biscuit malt notes going on provide enough sweetness to compete with the hops. I have to mention the Ringwood yeast note that comes out in every Shipyard brew I've ever tasted, that edge brings a tart almost sourdough note with a touch of oak barrel character and leather. Flavors collide hops and malts and than the Ringwood hammer drops, touch of toasted biscuit and citrus hops among the flood of yeast character that I already described. Mouthfeel is medium bodied oily with hops and carbonation is sturdy almost tickling the back of the throat. Drinkability is decent but the never ending Ringwood edge gets in the way of my enjoyment, solid New England style pale ale.","WVbeergeek","Jul 05, 2008"

3.4,-4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"This was very easy to drink, but its quite ironic that a beer named after the Union officer who held the flank at Gettysburg (or everyone would be saying "Y'all" now) is a beer without real direction. There is stuff going on, but no real plan/course of taste action. It tastes confused, again a bitter (pun intended) irony given the namesake. I do think it would benefit greatly with some simple pub fair, and it probably would be very good with such.

4.1,15.8,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Shipyard's Chamberlain Pale Ale is a beautifully done English pale ale that can only be fully enjoyed at cellar temperature. It needs a rough pour to raise its head and release some CO2; and a bit of warming from the fridge. Otherwise, it's almost another beer entirely. It's clear golden-amber body is capped by a creamy head of off-white that holds well and leaves some nice splashes of lace behind. The nose is rich with yeast character (buttery diacetyl and some apricot/dried dates/figs). It just reeks of Ringwood! It's medium-bodied with a dextrinous edge, and somewhat creamy due to its moderate carbonation level. The malt is grainy and rich with a bright caramel edge, and some grassy and leafy hops add a tea-like note that nestles in nicely with the butteriness to leave it kind of nutty. Well-rounded, full flavored, beautifully balanced. Very drinkable! Kind of a very special bitter in my opinion. Well worth seeking out for fans of English ales.","NeroFiddled","Jan 05, 2007"

It pours a pretty standard coppery and bubbly amber with a two finger khaki head. The Ringwood (a Shipyard signature) is evident in the aroma as is butter and pine (the latter particularly appropriate for a leading microbrewery from the Pine Tree State). The taste is exactly what the redolence would suggest, a bit more of the caramel than the pine, I would say, and the finish is bready. There's a smooth feel to the mouth and more subtle carbonation than the plethora of rising bubbles would suggest. A fine ale for a clear, warm summer evening on the shore of one of Maine's many beautiful lakes. I just wish I could get cases of this stuff!","longpondbeerman","Aug 06, 2005"

It also has a bitter hop finish that balances well with the Ringwood yeast. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a highly drinkable beer.
