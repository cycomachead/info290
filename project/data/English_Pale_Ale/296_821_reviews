"O: Nothing really stands out, but it's a very balanced English Pale Ale."

"A distinguished yet simple English pale ale - not as good as a proper cask offering, I'm pleased to pick this up when I'm in the mood for the style."

"O - Certainly not overly impressed by this offering and was hoping for something more along the lines of a traditional english ale with some stronger musty malts and earthy hops. This failed to deliver on both fronts and was rather disappointing."

"O - a very nice real ale that is wonderfully balanced and highly sessionable - I would get tired of drinking this all night"
"D - A largely forgettable English pale ale. The combination of skunk and butter is not a winner, and the puzzlingly harsh bitterness seems out-of-place for a session ale. I got about half the bottle down before I gave up and moved on to something better."
"D: A good English pale ale on the bitter side thanks to an excellent distinctive finish, but still fairly balanced and exceptionally sessionable."
"At first blush I'd say it tastes like earwax. Hops are very grassy/floral. Pale malts. Chalky. Has an oddly skunky Heineken aspect to it. Dry aftertaste. Somewhat astringent. My will to live fades with every sip."
"The mouthfeel was medium with a mild carbonation. This is not a beer I would seek out but I do like the English Ales."
"*It should be noted that my bottle read ""Organic English Ale"" but no such beer exists on BA. This could have had a major effect on the tasting."
"However it's easy to remember why I became a fan of the brewery after returning to this beer more than a year after I first discovered it. It's an easy-going, crisp and for the most part fresh-tasting ale I could drink anytime."
"Pours a moderate brownish-copper color with a really thin initial head that quickly dissipates and doesn't leave anything of note behind. The nose is an immediate travesty. That's what you get when you put a pale ale in a green bottle. This is simply gross and ridiculously-skunked. That's all that is there. The taste isn't quite as bad as the nose, but doesn't offer anything other than light-struck hops. It just has less of a skunky character. The feel is gross and astringent. Bad, bad, bad. Change the bottle color, please."
"Drinkability - It is a beer i am glad i tried, but the organic aged ended with Woodstock or maybe should have stayed at Woodstock!"
"Drinkability- very enjoyable. I'd be glad to have these all night but wouldn't go on a goose hunt for one."
"Drink -A so-so beer that I would drink again but would not seek out. I can see how this would appeal to some, but there far better beers out there. It has a pleasant smell and taste, but lacks in the mouth feel department."
"Yes."
"Pours an orangish-yellow colour that starts off with a finger or 2 of head, but that dissipates without any retention or lacing. Smell has some floral hops with a bit of earthiness. Flavour has a tiny bit of bitterness from the hops, with some sweetness. Nothing off about this, just a little bit lacking in flavour compared to other pale ale's. Carbonation level was a little weak, but still a highly quaffable beer."
"I think I appreciate St Peter's English Ale more for its uniqueness than its quaffability, although I do enjoy drinking it too! It's definitely more charismatic than its generic title lets on. As I finish writing this, the fruity hoppiness and chamomile tastes grow more and more assured, triggering vivid thoughts of spring and budding flowers - it's a good beer that can do that!"
"This is my second time having this beer, and the second time is what it took to appreciate it. The first time I had this, I drank it directly from the fridge and it seemed very minerally and skunky, but now, as I let it sit as I reviewed, this beer's nuances really started to shine. It's not the best EPA I've had, but it's sure worth a try."
"D almost a session beer. Drinkable, but the best part is the package, it come in neat glass. would not buy again."
"D: Very easy to drink... I have to say at first I did not like it but as it warmed up it got better and better.... 1 was enough for me, but over all a good drinking brew."
"Final Thoughts: This beer isn't for me, that is for sure. I'm not sure skunking or poor storage have a factor here because I just can't see many characteristics I can appreciate. Really, I feel that the only reason this stuff sells, is because of the odd shaped green bottle. I also have the St. Peter's cream stout in my fridge, and I must say I'm not looking forward to it."
"The mouthfeel is watery creamy and smooth with some diacetyl slickness. However, the carbonation fades quickly for a flat beer midway."
"It's deep golden orange in colour with almost no head to speak of. What little head there is fades to a ring around the edge and splotch in the middle. It smells of caramel, ripe fruit (apple and plum?), with a faint musty character around the edges. There's an earthy base to the flavour profile. Caramel and fruit, with lemony finish. Nice lingering bitterness in the aftertaste. I think I opened this too cold, it took some time to really open up. It improves significantly as it warms. Very low carbonation and smooth-bodied, but somewhat light as well. Easy to drink and light in the stomach - it's definately a session ale."
"not my favorite, very deep acidic and older fruit flavors, without many other positive aspects in its wake."
"D: Drinks quite easily, and relatively low ABV."
"St. Peter's unique bottle design is what first drew me to try their beers several years ago but it is the quality of their brews that has kept me coming back. This beer pours a very hazy yellow gold with just the tiniest of white heads briefly appearing up top. The aromas are very earthy with a pleasant, honey-like sweetness. Its flavors are also have earthy notes with a very intriguing sourdough breadiness that I like very much. The cost of St. Peter's is a bit steep but its beers are well worth revisiting every now and then."
"Drinkability - wouldn't have more than 2 of these because of the same reason for limiting IPAs - I don't want to only associate beer with hops. It does get a little unidirectional when the malt isn't as present in the mix."
"What a very interesting beer this one is. Upon opening the bottle I get a whiff of that skunky hoppy smell, but upon pouring I get honey and very faint hops. Foam dissipated rapidly even after some of the yeast residue poured out into the glass. A cloudy orange-yellow color (maybe shades of brown) that is pleasant to look at and tasted quite good. You get that honey at first, followed by a bit of spiciness and a hint of hops/sour at the end. Very smooth going down and I finished this beer off pretty fast over a fried chicken and buttermilk biscuit dinner. Really very tasty - I'll have to get this one again. I was expecting something more in the hoppy pale ale department, and this is very different than any English ale I've had."
"The drinkabilty is off the charts. I could and would drink this all day all night. I love this beer and will seek it out again!"
"Poured a light amber, orangish color that was cloudy with very little to no head. The smell was hops, plums, roasted barley and floral scents. Initial taste was roasted malt with some bitterness and flowery tea flavors in the end. It is a good beer with decent drinkability, but not great and not horrible, very average."
"D - Very drinkable and refreshing. This is one that I could put away several pints of."
"Drinkablity? The abv says it should be good as long as it has a good taste and I find it does. I could easily session on this one. Too bad it's not carried in town.."
"Pours a mirky golden orange color with a thin fizzy white head that quickly fades without any lacing. Earthy aroma of grass, soil and hops with a vegetable-like quality. Crisper than their IPA but still very earthy and dirty tasting. Vegetable-like and bitter but in a rotten unpleasant kind of way."
"Drinkability: definitely not a session beer, but great to sip and enjoy. I believe that (at least here in Ontario) that what is labeled as St. Peter's English Ale is indeed the same as the Organic Ale that I believe they serve in the UK. Not my favourite St. Peter's offering, but still a pleasant brew, as was expected given their range of other fantastic brews."
"Bought this bottle at Green's, and it fits nicely into my English pint glass. Pours with the slightest chill haze, an orange amber with a fairly slight head, but one that is creamy and settles to athin cap and leaves some lacing. I lie the design of the bottle, but this one is is still in that light green glass that I hate since it skunks the beer. This one seems okay, however. Nicely balanced aromas of lightly sweet grain, earthy hops, and some floral top notes. A bit of clean hay is there as well. Smells rustic and delicious. Pretty similar in the taste, just beatifully balanced with some nice but slight lingering earthy bitterness and a pleasant, slightly metallic undernote. Tastes fairly fresh with some light sweetness and some more hay. Very nice. Medium bodied with just enough graininess and bitterness to keep it interesting. A pleasure. I'd love to try this on cask."
"I can't say that I favor this beer. It's not that it's bad per say,it's just not what I'm after."
"Smooth and refreshing, modestly complex but well meshed. This would be an extremely enjoyable beer if not for the skunkiness. What's with the green bottles? The first time I tried this I knew the bottle was old so I didn't rate it, but I've been told that this is a fresh bottle and the skunk is still there."
"Some may not agree, but I think packaging does say something about the beer inside. A beer can certainly be delicious without being stored in something pretty, but an eye-catching bottle makes a beer easier to pick out on a shelf. Interesting design here, which I believe claims to be a faithful reproduction of a late 18th-century bottle. A nice historical tidbit to accompany a nice historical beer!"
"Good session ale to sit down and shoot the bull with."
"-NC Beer Monger"
"I would love to try this again with a fresher bottle. I think the one I got was sitting around for a while. But with no freshness dates, its hard to tell."
"I liked this beer, but I really wanted to like it more. I loved everything about it until that plastic/rubber aftertaste. It wouldn't leave me alone. It teased me during the drinking and haunted me when the beer was finished. Left my mouth feeling like I inhaled burnt plastic. Perhaps it's the copper kettle showing its thing, but I'm not sure. I'd love to try it again to see if it's the same."
"Light-medium-bodied and mildly carbonated, St. Peter's is plenty drinkable."
"D - These are great when you want to have 3-4 with dinner. ;)"
"Very cloudy yellow brew. Thick white head with good retention. Grassy, hoppy smell. Taste comes up short, though. Smooth, buttery, and slightly hoppy, but overall it's lacking punch and disappointingly, it has a slightly metallic flavor. Decent beer, and would be an okay session beer, but not for the price."
"Overall - if I can find this beer again, I'm definitely buying some to take home."
"D- no doubt about it, i would buy cases of this stuff if it were readily available. thirst quenching, refreshing, and substantial. low abv makes it all easier and sessionability is not even a question. even assuming this bottle was less than fresh does nothing to stand in the way of a superb organic ale."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, it's a decent beer to drink for a while but not the first that I would choose within the style."
"Pours into the glass a clear, pretty golden amber with a fairly thick and fluffy but not persistent head. Aroma is crisp and malty, rather like a lager instead of an ale. Flavor is malty, not complex, a bit on the thin side. Texture is smooth and has a little bit of a bite. Not exciting, but palatable."
"Definitely an enjoyable and highly drinkable brew."
"Pours a lovely copper with highlights of gold around the edges. Light foam and light lacing with some mild bubbling. The aroma is a light sweet bread with a touch of hoppy citrus. Smells like a great session beer. The first sip brings together a perfect balance of hops and malt. Biscuits with splashes of orange and grapefruit juice. Great mild bitter finish with hints of pine in an acre of grapfruit trees, while Grandma is baking a batch of biscuits. Very smooth ad balanced ale. Maybe even a little more bitter than I expected from an English ale. A great session beer for anytime of the year."
"D: Great little session brew. A little dull on the palate but it's got nothing but fresh grown organics in it (so it must be good for you)."
"The taste is similar, with lightly toasty bready malt, lemon, a little other citrus in general (some grapefruit), and pine and hints of caramel and smokiness. It is a little juicy, and has a full, nice feel."
"I kinda liked this , then i do like sweet beers, if you dont avoid."
"Pours a clear light gold with orange hues and a medium white head that dissipates slowly with light lacing. Sweet aroma of malt and tea with light citrus. Up front flavors of caramel & toffee then a tealike, hoppy flavor finally finishing smooth and malty. Light carbonation, easy drinking beer. Bonus for using certified organic hops and barley."
"Overall, interesting, but wouldn't drink all night."
"Likely (hopefully?) a damanged beer, but that seems to be a recurring theme with St. Peter's beers. Not quite as bad as some others I've tried, but I really don't feel like trying one of these again."
"D: Drinkability was average at best for one, wouldn't drink in multiples. Overall a boring example per style and one that could get easily passed over without missing much"
"Not bad..."
"D: If you are buying, I'm down. Otherwise, I am not seeking this one out. I will try their others though. So many people I know crow about St. Peter's."
"Very nice, but @ $5 cdn + per pint an occassional treat and not much more."
"Now, I'm willing to give this another shot some time - maybe this was just a bad bottle, be it from age or otherwise. After all, I was very pleased with their stout when I tried it, so I know they can make some tasty brews. But this...just a letdown. Maybe next time!"
"A very easy beer to put down - no doubt. I could have used a little more hop presence but I cannot complain since it is an easy beer to drink and enjoy. The lower ABV makes it an ideal session beer."
"Summary: A fantastic English bitter"
"EDIT: got yet ANOTHER skunked bottle from a different store in a totally different location. dammit, st. peter - switch to brown bottles, already!"
"D: Drinkable, but I may have to pour some out - I'm not a big fan. Alcohol seems proportional."
"Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a golden orange color with about a half-inch white head which goes away pretty quickly. It smells like caramel malt, grassy hops and a bit of skunk. Taste is similar to the aroma, there's also an earthy and grainy taste too. Finishes nice and bitter. Mouthfeel/body is medium, and it's very smooth with little carbonation. Drinkability is good, however it would be better if I had a fresher bottle. The noticable skunk in the aroma and taste (not overpowering) drops down the score a bit, but I would definitely try this again if I can find a fresher bottle. Overall, not too bad!"
"D = This is definitely drinkable as a session beer. However, there are a lot of other choices and this is not high on my list. Decent beer if it is available, but I'd say middle of the road for the category."
"Quite tasty, easy to drink and refreshing with an accentuated hop profile. Pricy, too...I can think of better choices, but this is decent. Put it in four packs at a reasonable cost and you've got something."
"If they would make beer in brown glasses, it would likely not have the skunk."
"I was skeptical at first, but overall it is a very good beer. Only drawback, though, is that it is expensive, considering it is good, not great."
"Highly drinkable and refreshing. Would be a nice session beer, if not for the moderately hefty price (~$3.49 / 500 mL bottle)."
"Overall this beer had decent enough flavor to keep you entertained, i would enjoy this beer from time to time but wouldn't go out of my way to obtain it, not my favorite EPA but worth a try."
"Pours glub glub due to it's medicine bottle shape. Pours a nice big head that retains very very well. The color is cloudy and golden brown with a white head. The smell is bitter hops with a slight caramel maltiness...not sharp hops or malt, but soft and nice. The taste is very good, I like the hops, they have the slightly malty background. Mouthfeel is smooth and welcoming. Overall, this is very nice and I would like more, but will have to wait until it comes back in stock."
"d- i love this beer. if it wasn't $4 a bottle, it'd make a great session drink. tastes like an e.s.b."
"This is just a good English Ale that seems to me to be very sessionable. Pours a slightly cloudy orange bronze colour with a white head that dies away pretty quick. Plenty of earthy English style hops in both the smell and the taste. Just enought malt to balance thing out a bit, but plenty of hoppy bitterness. Smooth and easy drinking, this is one of my favourite old stand by's in this style."
"Besides, it comes in an awesome bottle."
"D - This is an okay beer, however, I found it extremely overpriced."
"Very drinkable. Subtle flavors make this one either easy to quaff or easy to admire."
"I always had a soft spot for St. Peter's they have some good beers and I like the style of there bottles. Pours with a medium sized head that disappears slowly but still clings to the glass. Not much lacing. A hazy amber colour. Smells of some light hops and a sweet malt, this is the first one I have that does not have a slight skunky note on the nose and palate. Has a nice bitter earthy hop finish. Clean and tasty. A very nice ale and one I am glad to have in my fridge"
"The grassy and earth English hops are up front and dominate the initial flavor. As the beer warms, there is more of a balance between the hops and sugary malt. As a fan of English beers, this one seems to be spot on in terms of flavor and balance. The mouthfeel is medium and very smooth, with little noticeable carbonation. And at only 4.5%, it could certainly be a session beer. If you like English ales, you'll love this."
"Not a bad English Ale. Seems like they followed the recipe pretty close. Flavorful and organic, now if only I had a real British person to test it on."
"t: malty and pretty bitter. Citrusy tones are a little too sharp. sorta smooth but not all that great overall."
"A cloudy, yellowish-orange color, with a decent head that doesn't stick around nearly long enough. There is some lacing. The bottle is unique, it looks like an old flask of something potent. The smell is hoppy, bitter, English ale, and not overly enticing. The taste is a bit metalic in the middle, balanced, medium bodied, a little sharp, maybe a little bready. The after taste is very sharp and imbalanced compared to the rest of the beer. The mouth feel is hoppy esters. You can really feel the oils in your mouth. Not a bad beer to try, but not my favorite either. L'Chaim"
"Drinkability - this is not bad, but it's also not good, and therefore not sessionable."
"Golden in color with a quickly disapating head. Smell is honey sweet with malts. Taste of honey, malt grain and a good balance of hops and carbonation, having a light to medium mouthfeel. It was actually better than what was expected in this english ale."
"Nothing special, nothing terrible. Worth a try."
"- Bottle pour, cellar temperature, into a pint glass -"
"All in all, not a bad brew. Not a real winner for me either. I'd take a Bass over this anyday,"
"This is a very easy drinking English ale, and a great organic beer. Recommended for spicy cuisine, sessionably light but tasty."
"pours a redish brown color with a mild head that laces quickly. smells of mild hops and water, unfortunately tastes the same, only a bit more hop presence is noticable. but more water is noticable than anything, can't even tell if there is any alcohol present. its drinkabitlity is pretty high since it doesn't taste like much of anything. i've heard really good things about this beer and i'm not impressed. maybe my expectations were too high."
"Drinkability- Not a great representative of an English pale ale, but interesting enough to give it a whirl."
"Well, this one is decent, but I don't think I'd get it again. I'm a silly American with silly tastes for really strong hoppy beers or cheap swill. Try these just to keep the bottles!"
"DA: I found this very easy to drink and enjoyed the fact that it is made up of mostly organic ingredients."
"very interesting flask-shaped bottle. in the glass it is a murky copper. the small head disappears quickly. all citrusy hops in the nose, this a very good smelling beer. the taste has the same hop character, but the citrus turns downright lemony covering any hope of malt body. definite bubble-gum. this detracts from the mouthfeel and the drinkability for me, big time."
"Taste is a little sour, lemonlike, light spiciness, almost a farmyard funkiness. Clover, hay, grapefruit. Like a sour fruit punch I'd say, and the carbonation is similar. The body is less thin than my last sample as well. This is a little lighter and less malty than I usually prefer, but it's not bad. Much better than I remember last time I had it."
"A nice, well-balanced ale. Fairly basic, but pleasant and well-balanced. Would make for a nice ""session"" ale."
"First beer of the New Year; kicking back after 12 hours in the ER. Pours a yellowish-brown color with a frothy white head. Aroma is mild, some hops with a touch of diacetyl. Flavor is well balanced; the hops do not overpower the malt, and there is definitely a diacetyl component. Fairly drinkable beer, if a little thin."
"Not my favorite beer from St Peter's. It doesn't taste spoiled or anything, just not very good. The beer came in a medicine bottle, and ended up tasting like medicine. This one was a little hard to finish."
"This would be a great session beer if my wallet wouldn't protest."
"Great looking bottle, of course, to hold a decent English ale. And organic, too, for what that's worth. Nothing extraordinary here, a golden orange sorta butterscotch color to it, a bright white coarse head, not a lot of lingering. The nose is standard mild grassy hops and caramel. Lots of pleasing bitterness at the beginning of each sip. Decent malt and caramel flavors, fairly smooth. A pleasant if unexciting brew."
"D - A pint is a bit much, I am having motivation problems finishing this one. Not due to abv (which is quite low), but the hops get to be a bit much. The weird thing is, they are not ""strong"" in the sense the america pale ales tend to be strong. This is just too fragrant, and that carries over to the flavor and the drinkability. I doubt that I will have this again, but it is worth a try."
"Bought a half case of 16.9oz bottles. I was impressed when I opened the case to find the medicine type bottles, quite unique. It pured an off-golden color to brown to a quickly dissipating head. It smelled a bit...off is all I can think of. Not too sweet, not too hoppy, just not so fresh of a smell. The taste was really not more than an average brew, nothing to knock your socks off with. It had a creamy mouthfeel, but still the taste and the off smell didn't relinquish to a satisfying experience. I don't think you could have more than just a few of these. Besides the price, $39.00 for 12 bottles, you can really find a better English brew. I will savor the remaining case to maybe impress my friends with the looks, but I will continue my search for the perfect beer."
"This is one of the superior English Bitters I've had in the US. This has the body and flavor to stand up to a typical IPA without becoming an IPA itself."
"D: Not bad but there are definatly better English Pale Ale's out there. I would get this again, but it is WAY overpriced for something so mediocre."
"Pours clear golden copper with insignificant head and sparse lacing. Smells incredibly sugary, woody, and full of carmel for something that purports to be a pale ale. No hop aroma at all. Sweet biscuit malts dominate the flavor profile A touch of toasted grain in the center before a fairly dry and woody hop bitterness sets in. Thin and overly still in the mouth for a pale ale. The aroma is off-putting for the style, though the beer is ultimately salvaged by its reasonably palatable taste."
"Pours a bright marmalade hue, with fluffy eggshell head that dissipates to dusting. Sticky lace is left behind. Rather faint aroma, with some slight mineral notes alongside honey and yeasty, rising dough. On the palate, orangey yeast up front and biscuity malts at the mid-palate. Mildly doughy flavor throughout, with a tingly, sweet-and-sulphur finish. Minimal hop content -- just some subdued, earthy, balancing hops. Smooth, unassuming mouthfeel with a dextrine character. Easy to drink, great session beer."
"Flashes of a Brown Ale with touches of sweetness throughout the flavors. Nothing special going on here."
"Unfortunately, as with many of the imported beers in the LCBO (Liquor Control Board of Ontario), the date stamp indicates that it was bottled three months ago. It may seem a bit unfair to judge St. Peter's when the freshness is questionable but, as I have no plans to visit rural England any time soon, it will have to do."
"Very smooth mouthfeel, jetisoned along by sparse, yet fine carbornation. Quiet drinkable although the lingering hop bitterness is a touch distracting. Overall a good, subtle brew slightly lacking in character, will buy again, but not at the top of my list."
"A pleasant surprise and a good English pale ale."
"Stay away if you want something really complex or hard-hitting, or if you're afraid of fruitier undertones."
"Very solid English Pale Ale. Smooth but a little more spicy than I expected. Foamy head. Not too much carbonation. This is the way I prefer my pale ales. I'd take an English over an American style any day, but that's just me. In a side note, I had some chicken tacos from the Mexican shop on the corner while drinking this one and I have to say it went quite well with it."
"Even after getting through the skunkiness, I wasn't impressed by this beer. Just the bottle."
"St. Peter's ales."
"Taste is nice. That's about it. This one was a little underwhelming to me. Farily easy to drink as there is little carbonation or overpowering flavors to burn one out. Would one want to make this a sessioner? You could but I think you'd getr bored after the second one."
"mouthfeel is crisp and dry. odd in every way but good drinkable pale ale. gotta love english brewing."
"Good, if forgettable. Worth the purchase to discover how flavors change with temperature and for the medicine bottle."
"Taste is very buttery, butter esters come in and play with your senses they are very present. Shy hops presence aswell with a mellow bitterness folowed by a malty presence. Ends in smoothness with a watery touch."
"Drinkability: Find a half barrel of this if possible. Slap an IV on me. One could drink this for days on end. Great beer. Bottom Line."
"This beer pours a copper color, a vigorous pour only resulted in a one finger head. The smell at first was malty, then some floral notes. I can taste the malt at first, with some hop in the finish. Pretty well balanced. This is an organic ale, and I would have to say I like it. Well worth a try."
"However I still will drink this one since two out of three ain't bad (and were magnificent)."
"A pretty good beer that gets lost among the shuffle of other good English Pale Ales. Solid golden color with a slight haze and fair retention. Smells lightly hoppy, malty, and earthy. Tastes similar with a bolder than normal hop empahsis. Lightly herbal and earthy and, perhapse a bit grain-like. Quite clean and crisp other that a slight butterscotch flavor and feel in the finish."
"Probably wouldn't purchase again."
"This overall isn't too bad, if you can get past the smell."
"Presentation: Packaged in a custom half-liter green glass bottle in the style of the late 18th century. Served in a standard pint tap glass."
"I agree that the ""packaging"" is eye-catching...that's what drew me to it. It poured well with a nice amber/ almost copper color. I thought the smell of hops came through very distinct. I found it to be a bit bitter for the first couple of sips. The mouthfeel is good. It has a nice light, crisp feeling. I didn't rate this quite as high on drinkability just because I don't think I would personally drink many of these...and for the fact that neer the end I was ""forcing"" it down. I don't mind having a pint of it, but it's not my favorite ale."
"D: No problem drinking this beer. Not jaw-dropping spectacular, but certainly wouldn't mind downing a few of these on occasion."
"M & D: A light/medium-bodied brew that is very smooth and drinkable. It could definately make a fine session beer. However, the lifeless appearance and disagreeable aroma of this brew pull the score down a bit. I'll have a St. Peter's Golden instead."
"A soft amber color with a bit of off-white head that quickly fizzled out and left behind just a bit of lacing. Aromas of apricots, peaches, and bread come to mind. The taste is very much like a mild American IPA or an American Pale Ale with just a touch of hop bitterness with a fruity finish that starts off subtle and mild, but quickly becomes all-consuming. In my mouth this beer was a bit too fruity without the alcohol or malt to balance it out and add richness to the flavor. Instead, this beer seems a bit one-dimensional with a hop bitterness that leads into a fruity finish. Moderate drinkability due to the flavors, but the ABV is low and the flavors make this beer somewhat distinct, even for its style."
"Pours a hazy golden orange peach color with a short white head that soon fades into a thin lace. Nose is earthy grains along with fruity and floral hops. Taste begins with sweet malt and a light fruitiness followed by dry cracker-like grains. Next up are some herbal and earthy hops along with some lemon peel and a hint of a metallic twang. Nothing special, but certainly worth a try."
"A decent flavor, smooth and light to medium body. Good example of english style ales. It is something i could easily drink a few of at a time and not get sick of."
"Creamy white head laces out milky. Sits atop a thick coalesce of amber and dark orange. Smell is a little skunky from a distance, but ironically becomes floral and malty on a closer sniff. Instantly tastes grassy with light bark and the hops show up a little late. Creamy and bitter. Good but not great. I likes St. Peter's Porter much better than this."
"d - good example of an english ale! i would definately recommend this if you're sitting back on your couch, listening to some music (i was listening to blackalicious), and just relaxing. you could definately drink this throughout the year, but i would recommend late summer, spring, and early autumn. i wish that i could get this in a sixer."
"Overall this is a decent brew, and a nice version of a Pale Ale."
"This is a great bottled bitter with a great hop profile. Its very well balanced and an impeccable session ale."
"Moderately hazed pale amber color, a little yellowish and kind of dull in overall appearance. Head struggles, then fall to a skim fairly quickly. Nice laces however, complex rings and falling tendrils. Slightly hoppy nose here, a bit of apple skins and a lesser amount of balsam. Mouthfeel is lighter, carbonation falls below average and works downward. Nice taste, actually the malt is subdued and lightly grainy, and the hops shine in a English manner. Bitter florals and black pepper characterize the impression. Clean finish with a bit of verve -- and nice balance, the dying carbonation is the only bit of a letdown in the finish."
"A tiny layer of cream-colored, oily film; an ever-so-slightly hazy, orange-amber body. The nose is sweet, caramel toffee and that's all. Same up front. Butterscotch through the middle to a tangy, butterscotch-toffee finish. Quite bitter. Body is somewhat thin. Some toasty crackers/grains in the aftertaste. Very nice, very butterscotchy, with a sharp, bitter finish. Almost puckering, but taming with temperature."
"Pours a clear light copper with a light foamy lacing. Raw, tangy hop aroma. Hops are more dominant here than in most English pale ales, with a big herbal, grassy twang to it. Dry, cracker-like malt backbone keeps the hops in check. This is an organic ale, and it certainly tastes it. Quite a departure from what I'm used to, but remarkably tasty and drinkable. Definitely worth a try."
"Another gift from the wife. Kind of murky red pale ale color. Smell is soaking the whole room with flowery hops. Very nice smell. Taste is good - a mild english ale with a heavy dose of alphas. Lighter hops in the nose, but not much in the taste. Mouthfeel is a little too bitey, but otherwise good. This would be a good session brew."
"Mouthfeel is watery, clean. Not much to brag about here, though my opinion does improve as I drain the glass. Organic is as organic does, but it really does nothing for me."
"Tastes like a good, solid English session bitter. The strength is a bit high for a the style, but perhaps that helps it keep better in the bottle. Very quaffable!"
"This goes down really smooth, this is one of the best EPAs I have had."
"Must be the water in England, I usually smell and taste some metallic notes; this beer wasn't an exception, but it wasn't overtly metallic in either category. A nice session beer, for sure."
"Personally, I don't think this is one of their best. A bit above average compared to, say, Bass, but not the quality of others I've had. Nothing exceptional, but easy to drink. A decent session ale, but a bit on the pricey side."
"Pours with the smallest amount of head possible for it to still be called a head. The aroma is mostly skunk with some maltiness and a bit of hop spice. The flavor is the same with a hint of metal, possibly from the cap. The carbonation is on the mild side. This really seems like it would be a good beer if not skunked. However, with a green bottle I don't forsee ever finding an unskunked bottle around here."
"None of the skunky smell I got with another of the St. Pete's offerings. Very light taste, aroma. Goes down nice and easy-like. It's easy to envision men sitting around in a pub hundreds of years ago drinking one after another of this brew. Alchohol comes in at a mere 4.5% making this all the more easy to sit back and session."
"Can you say ""Average""? Copper-tinged amber ale, topped by a thin off-white head. Theres a mild English hop note wrapped in a bit of skunky aroma. The flavor is fairly neutral, with a slight bitterness in the finish. Nothing really outstanding on the palate. The mouthfeel is decent, and the lack of real enjoyable flavor makes it technically drinkable, but nothing to savor. All around an average, inoffensive beer."
"Pours a orange-red color with a hazy glow. The head is white and sticky. Smells of dry grains, light fruity hops, and mineral water. The mineral water is the first thing I noticed along with a lemony light hops followed by a dry bread like grain. Has medium-light body with a great drinkability. Organic or not, this is a very worthy English Pale ale!"
"Pours a rather dull, amber/orange colour, minimal head after a hard pour. Seems characteristic of st. peter's brews. Just not too appetizing. Aroma of malt, slight diacetyl, and some grain and hops. Taste was average for an english ale. A mix of the traditional malts, a bit toasty, slight caramel, ok hop twang in the back. Low carbonation, medium bodied, smooth and quite drinkable. Finish is dry and slightly bitter. Not one of their best."
"Overall: A solid effort from St. Peters, whilst some of their offerings suffer from low carbonation, poor nose and/or low mouthfeel  this one excels all round. One of the better St. Peters brews."
"I love the bottle, but the beer within that bottle, while not deserving of scorn, doesn't deserve much praise either. St. Peter's English Ale is a garden-variety pale that could use more body, more flavor and fewer bubbles. Most good pale ales have nothing to fear."
"Drinkability  This ale is nice, easy, and even. The finish especially is long and drawn out and meant to be savored."
"Olde fashioned bottle, no freshness dating. Pours light a light shade of honey/almond, clear, minimal head. Does leave very light tiny bubble lacing. Seems to have low carbonation. Hop nose. Nicely balanced English ale. Subtle maltyness, balanced by a moderate amount of grainy hops. Light bodied, fairly dull english style stuff. Pleasant quaffer, but give me some boldness of the American take on the style."
"Not impressed with the pour at all.Had little or no head and a flat look to it.Had a bit of lacing but nothing much.The color is a dark gold that is real hazy and cloudy.A sweet malty aroma with a touch of hops.A long lingering bitterness is left on the finish.This is my first organic ale and I'm not really impressed.It's ok,not great but not horrible.The mouthfeel is a bit watery.It has a good hop character.A sweet malt taste."
"Overall, this is what Bass wishes it was."
"Pours a deep gold color with almost no head and no lacing. The smell is faint. There's some grassy and hoppy aromas. The taste is fairly grassy, with a decent hop and malt balance. The mouthfeel is just a little light and oily. The drinkability isn't too bad at 4.5% abv. Just an average pale."
"500 mL green bottle with clearly marked production date on the back label."
"A very good English Ale. Unique bottle, expensive price. Pours out to an orange colour, short head, not much of a presentation, but the flavor is really quite good, with overtones of burnt hops and barley, but goes down very smooth. This is a good brew for those interested in trying something new. Recommended."
"Nice light orange liquid. Very little head. Less than a finger worth that quickly disipated to nothingness. What lace that is left creeps down to the bottom at a rapid rate. Bit bitter smelling. Grassy, earthy hops coinciding with a dry malt. Taste is a tad sweeter than scent. A dry, baked malt with a dominant, bitter taste. Aftertaste is grassy. Medium body, crisp mouthfeel. Causes alot of burping, I must say. Not a bad beer."
"It's been a rough day watching the red sox, so i'm hoping for a pick me up. I love the flask shape bottle and the simple classic label, but other than that the appearance is fairly average. There is almost no head even with a vigorous pour, though this is not uncommon for English PAs. The color is a nice dark golden amber. Not an overly aromatic beer, but does smell faintly earthy/dusty/musty, actually kind of like an english tavern. The taste is subtly malty and not overly hoppy, again fairly traditional for EPA. Not overly complex, but tasty and enhanced by the nice light bitter finish. This was fairly light bodied and not very carbonated. I wonder how much of that is due to original craftsmanship versus shipping to Colorado. With no freshness date i have no way to know. Overall a good solid pale ale that i enjoyed but was not great enough to improve my mood very much."
"Out of its unique bottle that looks like it came out of my grandmother's medicine cabinet, this ale pours a golden honey color with just a hint of cloudiness and a thin, white head. The immediate smell is slightly skunky, like Heinikken, and on closer inspection, I admit, I think I got a bad bottle. Either that or this is just not a good brew. Metallic, bitter. I'll have to update this review later when I try another bottle. How do I kill a review?"
"Soil Association Organic Certification. These boys mean business with their organic grown items. Poured out a golden/copper color with some carbonation that was visible. I've noticed that they don't have that much carbonation in their beers that is visible, but it is in the taste. Smell was very raw like. Hops hit the nose as well as earth tones and caramel blended in together. Perhaps a few nuts in there for good measure. Taste was to the point which I liked. Starts out to be very smooth and drinkable. Hops, grain and barley all hit the palate with some sweet malts finishing the job towards the end. Next time I'll know what to pick for an English ale. Bass or St. Peter's, Bass or St. Peter's? Should be an easy answer."
"Deep cloudy- amber color, nice off-white head that quickly disappears, malty, bready aroma. Sweet caramel malty flavor, the mild hop flavor stands out in the end with a nice clean finish, light to medium body with a kind of watery mouthfeel, pretty tasty and easy drinking."
"Drinkability: Yes sir...all day, any day."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a smallish 1/4"" white head above the golden brew. Head more or less promptly fades into a thin layer of film, although lacing is good, somehow. The (slight) aroma is of light malts, but seems more dominated by hops. Taste is dominated by bitterness, with a slight amount of malt evident to dull the edges a bit. A kind of metallic aftertaste sort of detracts from the experience, but the brew remains drinkable nonetheless."
"Drinkability is pretty high. First real experience with organic and would really like to try on draught to get full experience."
"The beer pours a dark gold color with a thin white lace head. The aroma is good. It has a slight malt feel with a bitter breadlike scent. The taste is decent, but nothing special. It tastes quite bitter and watered down. It has a breadlike finish that blends well with the hop flavor. The mouthfeel is lacking. It is a medium bodied beer with lower than average carbonation. This is a weak tasting English ale. I'm not a big fan. It's one and done for me."
"I like the flask like bottles that the beer comes in. It is a light orange in color. The aroma is sweet with faint traces of hops. There is s light taste of anise amidst the fruity/flowery notes. It finishes with a nice bitterness and a linering taste of marmalade."
"Pours a pleasant, hazy light orange color. Despite the minimal head topping this one, what remains forms a fine, tight lace. Soft, sweet malts characterize the smell. A bit of a Scotchy twang is present as well. Soft mouthfeel at the onset with a quick crush of hops that gives way to a sweet, somewhat grassy, malt base. Rather watery with something of a metallic taste that seems to fade as time goes on. This one got noticeably better as the glass emptied."
"Nice brew, to expensive to drink all the time though."
"Pours an orange amber with a small light head. Nice and smooth. Hoppy and malty all in one. A well balanced pale ale. The flavor is quite interesting and very pleasent. I'm so glad that good organic beers are starting to become available in the area. Certainly a beer that I plan on revisiting."
"I'd like this for a session beer, but the price tag is a bit steep for that, but well worth it. Reccommend this beer, and brewery! Up next is the St. Peter's Porter...ooohh."
"Oh boy - here is another case of a really really unique bottle with a moderatly unique beer inside. Seriously, given the right environment, this beer could be fantastic. I'm just not sure what that environment is. It poured a nice golden yellow, with a slight brown coloring - mostly noticable in the head. The smell was pretty bold - I wasn't sure what flavors were hitting my nose. I do know that it tasted very good. It was pretty heavy and I appreciated that this beer had some body. All and all, a good beer- couldn't drink it all the time, but I'd drink it again."
"A drinkable beer but I wish there was more to the flavor profile and a bit more character."
"Very distinctive bottle...sort of dark olive green and reminds me of an old medicine bottle with its rounded flask shape. A sticker on the front about the shape and size of an egg. Very little head formed, even less remained...no lacing. Nice aroma, fairly typical for the style, as is the taste. Think Bass Ale with a bit less malty sweetness and a bit more hop bitterness. I noticed that this increased slightly as it warmed. It is a solid beer and I'll gladly try others from this brewery if I can find them, as well as have this one again at the next opportunity."
"Nice golden brew with a medium head. This is another of your average english ale with nice hops and a very refreshing taste. Nothing too distincitve about this one except that the bottle is pretty cool. I would drink this again but won't necessarly be looking for it."
"Could easily pass for a mild style. Rather sharp caramel malt aroma. Lackluster toasted malt flavors. Hopping? Not much to speak of. Even taking this a mild, it lacks the richness that the malt could lend. A bit thin and watery. Nothing unpleasant, but nothing to get excited about, either."
"Drinkability: if i wanted to i could drink quite a few of these, but i would not want to."
"This Organic ale pours a deep amber/copperish color. The head is reminiscent of a cask-conditioned ale in that the bubbles are mainly large and airy. The head thins to a light rimmed coating. The lace sticks in trails and webs. The malty aroma mixes with tea and citrusy smells and fades slowly into sweet malt. The malt is lightly grainy and caramel sweet. The hops possess a tea-like and lightly citrus bitterness. The slight metallic tang can be detected toward the back of the throat. I'm so glad St.Peter's has made its way across the pond!"
"Nice to drink, feels good on the mouth. The whole thing comes across as quite mild. Bitter dry finish. You can taste hops and malt both, but neither dominates."
"This brew pours an orange/amber color with little head and almost no lacing on the glass. The aroma is very fresh and slightly malty. The flavor is very smooth and enjoyable. The malts are apparent and there is a hint of bitter in the aftertaste. I highly recommend this beer."
"Good quality brews that seem to be straight forward and balanced well. Reminds me alot of Capital brewing; just across the pond."
"Murky amber hue. One fingered persistent, creamy off white head leaves sparse lace. Lightly buttered honey drizzled biscuit in aroma is accompanied by softly earthy hops and a subtle hint of caramelized almond. Mellow, toffeeish sweetness in flavor lazily gives way to stately biscuit and bread base malt notes. Judicious hop bitterness seemlessly emerges after a deliberation along with agreeably mild butterscotch, which longers sufficiently to facilitate a balanced, buttery undertone to the lately surfacing simple residual sweetness and nutty malt combination. Vaguely woody hop flavor. The low carbonation helps wring out the body from the unfermentables lending a smooth, quasi creamy mouthfeel. Finishes soft, with mild notes of whole grain biscuit enused by a light continuation of diacetyl. A mellow, simple, well balanced bitter with a firm malt backbone. St. Peter's English is highly reminscent of Belhaven's St. Andrew's Ale, but is comparatively a couple notches shy in overall character. Tasty, and a fine ""light"" session brew."
"A nice clear copper amber brew. Malty nose with a hint of hop and spice. Definitely a balanced hop and malt flavor to this beer. It might be my imagination but the beer is clean tasting, due to the organic hops? A nice hop, bread like feel at the back of the mouth. A nice beer from a great looking bottle."
"This is an ale that is harbouring some serious juxtapositions, very unique, it tends to catch you off guard, but in a good way. Worth trying a few times at least to pick up on all those subtle characteristics that tend to come out the closer you get to the bottom of the glass. And by the way, save those bottles, I'll use them for my own home brew, thanks."
"Thanks to Putnam for the sample."
"The taste is exellent, begins slowly with a mild hoppiness then esculates to an explosive bitter finish. The hops dictate, my kind of brew. Recomended!"
"I thank Uglyradio for the trade."
"Like everyone else I really liked the bottle,I had the Saint Peter's Bitter and liked that as well.I liked the nice golden color to it,no head to it but that was fine for the style.Smelled very hoppy and fruity like I figured it might be.Nice balanced ale slightley sweet but the hop is very evident,very clean tasting.Nice drinkable ale will look for others from this small brewery."
"This is a great beer and I see more of these in my future. Very impressed."
"This organic ale from Eastern England pours with a small white head that settles quickly. It has a deep-amber color and it's bouquet sweetish with hits of toffee. The nose is sweet and fruity, with notes of apricots, but by the time it reaches the back of your mouth the flavors are smoky, almost porter-like. The finish is crisp and dry, showing that it has been hopped just enough to balance it out and prove that it is an ""English Ale."""
"Clean, and clear, and under control... (oh, the horrible references we make)"
"All in all, a reasonable, left-leaning ale."
"Drinkability: Extremely high...this beer would make a great session beer. I would love to try this from a hand-pump...it would help with it's lack of head and the already-great mouthfeel would be even better."
"Hazy light gold. Aroma consists of lightly toasted malt, shortbread biscuits and subtle hop. Light fruits, apricot, pear and some red plum flavors float about as the delicate hops interplay with the toasty malt and yeast breadiness. A solid and well done ale...even if somewhat reserved."
"This beer practically explodes when un-capped. It's almost an understatement to say that it's aggressively effervescent. It does, however, produce a nice puffy, large-bubbled white head. The color of the beer itself is sort of a hazy orange. The aroma is fruity and floral...hop aromas are everywhere. Medium body and the taste is almost musty and earthy, with a decent hop finish. Very drinkable and certainly enjoyable. I'd certainly be willing to have more of these."
"I think this would be good with chicken, shallots, celery, carrots and peppercorns in a stewpot."
"Hazy golden with wispy head that dwindles but laces the glass. Some skunk aromas eventually disappeared. Quite sharp, almost fizzy, reminiscent of an Australian sparkling ale perhaps. Grasses, grains, earth in the flavor - it tastes noticeably different, an ""organic"" flavor I suspect. Malts are bready but not sweet; hops come on strong and tickle the tongue, almost puckering effect. Sharpness with a metallic hint makes me wonder if bottle has been damaged by light. Bottles are neat but I am guessing they don't protect the beer as well as they should. A very earthy ale, quite raw, unusual and lacking the heartiness that the best British ales have. Would pair nicely with some crispy fresh vegetables. Bring down the cost and I'll become a regular customer, otherwise no."
"Notes: Mmm … organic real ale, this is the good stuff for sure and a session beer at that."
"Really solid beer.  Light copper in color, fairly clear, and a nice thick head when poured with reckless abandon.  Head dissolves to clinging lace.  Aroma is very well balanced.  I can smell the malt, which is a bit caramel-like.  Hops comes out in a spicy and almost citrusy smell.  Some yeast aroma also present, but I might notice it because I'm having a cheddar cheese sandwich along with the ale.  Taste is mild, sweet malt and mild hops blend incredibly well.  Slight metallic tang, mostly noticable in the finish.  Beer is pretty lively on the tongue, even after a hard pour to create that big head.  I believe this is going to become a regular in my refrigerator - fairly low alcohol and great taste combine to make this a wonderful thirst quencher for most occasions."
"The organically grown hops clearly come through, the malts are there but this is an English Ale and what you would expect.  Low carbonation but good lace.  $2.95 for the 12oz oval bottle."
"Presentation12oz Green flask type bottle. Pours a nice light copper color. On the palate was a nearly perfect balance of malted barley and hops which brings out a very nice wholesome flavor, with a delicate character Overall very enjoyable brew!"
"Light amber with a clinging lace. Fruity hop nose. Decently hop bittered with the malt to back it up. A very good English Pale! All the swill drinkers at the bar were impressed with the bottle. One woman even took it home, apparently she has a collection of beer bottles. Maybe she'll sandwich it between the Coors light and Bud light."
