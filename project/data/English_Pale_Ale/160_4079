3.21,2.2,3.5,3,3.25,3.25,3.25,"Overall: yet another 'quite nice but not really great' beer from Wychwood that commands AU$72 for a case of 12. The only really decent Wychwood beers I have had are King Goblin and Paddy's Tout, yet all of their range are massively expensive. I wouldn't compare them to Monteith's, since Wychwood don't have any particularly nasty beers, but I would certainly not suggest them to anyone looking for value-for-money in a brewery. I'll continue to have a single of each of their beers, but a case? Not a chance.","SmashPants","Dec 14, 2014"

3.75,19.4,,,,,,"Bottle poured into an English pub glass. On the light side of orange-amber, with quick breaking white head that dissolves into a halo of bubbles that ring the inside of the glass. Has a low key mellow aroma of lightly toasted malts (like shredded wheat cereal), dry herbal English hops, very subtle citrus peel (lemon and orange) ... I am inclined to compare this to the similar Fuller's Organic Honeydew and I think this compares favorably. The malt flavors are richer, the hops are quite floral and recall faint citrus and fragrant grass, and the finish is crisp, herbal, and slightly orchard fruity. The herbal flavors become more pronounced over time, almost a little sage or something, and the overall effect shifts from quite dry to sweet. There is a minor but noticeable metallic tang. I find these English blonde or summer ales to be a tad bland, and in my view these should not be lumped with other English pales. Aw well. This one probably ain't worth the price tag.","CalgaryFMC","Sep 12, 2014"

The aroma is nothing really special actually just of some musty herbal grains. The taste is pretty close to the aroma with lots of malts up from followed by a slight bitter hoppy dry crisp finish. Medium bodied and medium carbonation. Overall, it was just OK and a once try brew for me. Not a big fan of the 'Pale Ale' types as they are all over the board with MOST in the very average range, like this one.","BeerWithMike","Aug 16, 2014"

Lighter in colour which works with the golden pale ale style this is a very drinkable beer that has a full mouthfeel and a lovely bitterness that matches the solid malt backbone. The target hops are a good choice to bring this beer home on the finish. Good stuff","canucklehead","Oct 31, 2012"

Some spotty lacing on sides. Herbal aromas with hints of honey & ripe persimmon to the nose. Mildy malts too. Crispy upfront, spicy bitter touch with subtle strawberry notes. Maltiness is carried on by a satiating mineralized underlying river followed by clean bitterness in the middle. Ripe apple texture. Medium to high body, medium to high carbonation.

3.32,5.7,3,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Wychwood Scarecrow technically shouldn't be lumped into one big English Pale Ale category, as this is a golden or summer ale. So this is a bit like having a lager with an ale flavor profile. Has a golden color with light brown overtones. A head that quickly fizzles out, though the overall taste of carbonation keeps it from feeling flat. Nice herbal aroma with some malt in the nose as well. What I like most about the flavor is it has a little bit of esthery apple. Light English hops. Crisp. The mouthfeel is not big and malty, so you might enjoy this in warm, fair weather. I do recommend it. It's organic; that counts for something. I've also had the Fiddler's Elbow, although that tasted as it it'd been sitting on the shelf way too long. Scarecrow is a common sight on Long Island - certainly AOK in my book. St. Peter's Golden Ale might be a more exciting example of the style, if you can find a fresh batch.","angusdegraosta","Jan 17, 2012"

When ur not in the mood for a strong stout or IPA or APA, and more for a pale ale this one is a good one to try.

It didn't bother to leave any lace. The aroma was light with lightly toasted malts, tea leaves, a small splash of juicy fruits, and the slightest touch of sweet English toffee at the end. For some stuipd reason, the main taste is this beer was carbonation. Most of the time the taste was mostly carbonation with toasted organic barley, caramel, tea leaves, and a pinch of very mild not too hoppy fruity hops. The mouthfeel was too light with a tiny aftertaste of juicy fruits, a trace of yeast, and some lightly burnt barley. I guess that since all the ingredients in this beer are organic, that means it's better for you than your average beer.

Body is shy of medium, the carbonation is actually pretty well done for the ABV. Hops and malt strike a decent if unremarkable balance, honeyish, but the skunkiness turns an initially average flavor into something that reminds me of milkweed.

After taking off the cap, the first scent I get is the typical skunky/Grolschy smell I associate with a beer gone bad. The beer is a pretty light golden yellow color without much of a head even after trying to make it happen. The nose, besides the skunk, has some sweet malts hiding along with a metallic smell. Not what I want in a beer of any type. The flavor is MUCH better than the smell, though there is a metallic tinge that detracts. There is a nice sweet start and hops that dance on my tonge after swallowing the beer. Not a bad offering. The beer is a little thin for my liking. The drinkability is not as high as I would expect from a nice light beer.

It gets more drinkable after every sip, though, and sweet honey flavors step through once your taste buds adjust. By the third sip, you think it isn't so bad, just a bit thin in the mouthfeel.

Drinkability was hampered by the bad smell and so so taste. I don't know if the skunked aroma was inherent to the product or if I happened to get a bad bottle. If it was the latter than I would say this beer wasn't horrible, just nothing great, barely a step above domestic macros.
