The flavor has a light bitterness that tapers into a harsh, flat taste. It leaves an aftertaste that is not welcome. I liken this flavor to what happens when you overcook and slightly burn something but end up making a dish with it all the same—it’s not quite enough to make you not want it but its not something you’re going to want to have again either. Oh well.","elNopalero","Sep 03, 2013"

Bought another single though and had it tonight with dinner.  Not nearly as crazy about it as I was.  It's good and still fruitier than most Pales and still far less hoppy than many American ones, but I did not find it especially distinguished as ""tasty and wonderful"" or as ""rich"" as before.  Thus downgrading my very high previous rating from 4.55 overall to 3.75.  My reviewing software here changed a few weeks ago, I am no longer able to rate the five appearance/smell/.taste/mouthfeel/overall separately.  So I have to go with this.  I'll probably buy more and re-review again since the difference between first and second tastings was so inexplicably enormous.","scotorum","Aug 25, 2013"

Aromas of rich, tangy sweetness, with toffee, honey, and nut making up the bulk of the nose. Hints of roast in there, as well. Flavors are rich and malty, with a roasted overtone. Biscuit backbone, with toffee overlays and a hops bitterness at the end of the palate. Light and smooth in mouth, with a semisweet and bitter aftertaste. Clean finish, with a subtle tangy sweet linger. Very easy to drink, and not overpowering despite some heavier flavor profiles.","GarthDanielson","Jun 10, 2013"

The yeast and hops combine to give character to classic malty ale flavor. The mouthfeel is a little medicinal and bitter due to some of those West Coast hops added in, but overall this is much closer kindred to a true traditional English style than any West Coast APA I've had. Geary's wins exceptionally high points for knowing exactly what they're doing, then doing it. This is how solid craftsmanship tastes.","angusdegraosta","Feb 03, 2013"

The nose comprises the starkly simple dichotomy of sweet caramel and flowery hops. The taste is very similar, though the flowers and caramel are now joined by a light orange, complete with bitterness from the peel.

Nice taste of crackers and malt up front in the taste, followed by caramel, toffee and some lemons at the finish. More complex than some other APAs, in part because the hops were quietly subdued without being suffocated. Decent body but, as with their London porter, I wanted just a tad more density.

Mouthfeel is ultra thick and fully, and I've tried most of the Geary's line in the last month, and surprisingly full mouth feel (on par with and as here, at times in defiance of style) is a characteristic of their brews. Outstanding - the brewer is truly a 'master.' More carbonation that I'd like, but this is right on for style, not flat. Drinkability wise, this, like the other Geary's beers I've tasted, are all around winners. Drinkable! This is outstanding - finally a true pale ale with some real character (other than hops). And so far Geary's has helped me reconsider my previous aversion for both pale and strong ales, making versions of both that I enjoy.","Liquids","Mar 21, 2007"

The taste was rather dry, with the biscuit flavors accompanied by a nice hoppiness and some slight juice tastes pulling through at the end. Mouthfeel was damn near perfect in its medium body. This is also a beer that is very easy to drink...It seems like an ideal candidate for even some beer drinkers not accustomed to heavier hop loads and new tastes. I really enjoyed this Pale Ale.

It may be slightly better on tap, but it's no slouch from the bottle either. I just love the hopping of this brew. It's perfect. Nice dusty, spicy, herbal boquet of hops on top of a nice pale malt profile. Excellent dry mouthfeel and this beer is so nice to drink. I've sort of become addicted to it. Everytime I got into the store I end up debating whether to get the Geary's or something I haven't had recently, and this beer usually wins it out. And that's strange because I never usually drink a lot of the same beer over and over.

No real nosefeel to speak of. Flavor is mostly a mellow bitterness with a rugged acridity in the aftertaste, with suggestions of sourdough bread and an indistinct, somewhat citric fruitiness. On the plus side, the bitterness is full-bodied rather than piquant, which aids the drinkability. Mouthfeel is sufficiently slick for a session beer, but is also, frankly, boring.

The aroma is a soft melange of floral hops with a citrusy tinge along with mild, bready pale malt and light lovibond caramel sweetness. Faint ripe pear esters add a green, fruity presence. Balanced, understated aroma. Ashen caramel malt initially in flavor is offset by a crisp, cleansing hop bitterness which develops into a woody, lightly earthy hop flavor. Subdued diacetyl emerges mid palate and complements the balmy, toffeeish malt backbone. Light in overall body, but pleasantly dextrinous and lightly viscous in mouthfeel. Finishes with an agreeable surge of savory, cracked grain laden salted biscuit, which leaves the palate parched and ready for more. A no frills, well rounded, superbly drinkable brew that treads the wide boundary between American and English pales.

Very smooth mouthfeel, not as crisp & hoppy in taste as the aroma suggests, but a good pale ale. This seems to be what a pale ale should taste like, with Sierra Nevada being more on the IPA side of things. Glad I tried this one...I imagine on tap it would be great!","avylover","May 16, 2003"
4.01,13,4.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Definitive amber color with fairly long-lasting big bubbled head on draft. High marks for drinkability the result of wonderful hops/malt balance. Neither overtake each other. Nothing is out of place. Very late hoppy dryness with momentary acidity results in mouthfeel and flavor finish that (don't laugh, I think this is a good thing) holds me off on brushing my teeth. The aftertaste is that good.","ecoboy","May 11, 2003"
3.5,-1.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The pour a unclouded amber color, the head is modest in size, bubbly in structure, and a very light tan in color with the lace a thin sheet upon the glass. Malt dominated is the nose, citrus crisp and fresh, the start is malt laden, slightly sweet, the top slender in its feel to the palate. Finish has a persistent acidic bite, the hops moderate in their presence and spiciness, quite dry aftertaste and a good beer to have on hand for the hot summer days just around the corner.","Gusler","May 10, 2003"
4.1,15.5,4,4,4,4,4.5,"This pale ale poured a nice, clear, amber color with creamy, white foam, and some nice small bubbling from the bottom of the glass. The smell was modest but good: citrus, malt, bisuity, and a bit of floral hops. The taste was first hops (floral and bitter) and then malt and a bit of citrus. The flavors were nicely balanced. The mouthfeel was smooth, crisp, and clean, with a bit of lingering hop flavors. The body was medium, and the carbonation was modest. The was a very nice and drinkable ale. Very smooth and refreshing.","UncleJimbo","Apr 12, 2003"

3.8,7,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"I am very happy I have finally tried Geary's Pale Ale. Pours out to a nice amber-brown in the glass with a decent head. Aroma is that of biscuit and a light floral smell. Taste is that of a very light grapefruit, mixed with malt and caramel. Not as hoppy as I thought it would be (although my companions at the bar thought it was, but they are new to hops), but it is extremely (forgive me) ""smooth"". A session pale if there ever was one.","proc","Mar 07, 2003"
4.12,16.1,4,4.5,4,4,4,"For me an aroma adds so much to a brew and Geary's Pale Ale is a perfect example of that. A big citrus cascade nose upfront with a sweet nutty malt aroma backing it up delivers enjoyment before you even taste it. The enjoyment continues with this clear bronze brew when the flavors of sweet bread and date fade to a light bitterness. Maine proves again they can brew great beer with this fantastic pale ale.","paceyourself","Mar 05, 2003"
3.93,10.7,4,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Well, it's been great getting into this community of beer fanatics, and since I have been here there is one beer that has been suggested by one man over and over again.Yep, it's Geary's Pale Ale, and right now everything else can wait, because this beer is my 100th review. This will be my first Maine beer, and this review is for JohnnyP and the rest of BAs from throughout New England. Appearance, well hey there's a lobster on the bottle it has to be from Maine!!! Pours a copper amber tone with an off white cream colored head. Is leaving a nice thin lace down the sides of my pint glass. The aroma is filled with sweet malt and a good amount of hop aroma, very pleasant aroma here. There is a nut flavor in the first sip that's complemented with a balanced blend of malts and hops, pretty good all around brew. The mouthfeel is medium to light in body, but this beer has such a great taste there doesn't need to be any fireworks in the mouthfeel. Very drinkable, could be a go to session brew if it was widely available down my way, but I now see why JohnnyP holds this beer in a special place in his heart. Gets this West Virginian's seal of approval, if you haven't tried a beer from Maine here's a place to start.","WVbeergeek","Mar 05, 2003"
4,12.7,4,4,4,4,4,"All in all not a bad beer. Poured copper with a minimal head. There was some sediment in mine, which I'm not sure if it was supposed to be there. No date on the bottle, so I'm not sure if it's past date. Floral, hoppy aroma with a touch of peach. Taste is pretty much the same. Hoppy, but not too hoppy, with peach notes. Seems to be a dry malt base. Light bodied. I'd definitely drink this one again, but I don't know that I'd seek it out as a permanent fixture in my fridge.","Admiraldinty","Feb 26, 2003"
4.25,19.7,4,4,4,4.5,5,"pours a nice orange colour with a strong head that dissolves fairly quickly yet never completely dissapears. caramel is apparent in smell and taste and is underscored by fruit flavouring and hints of saltiness. a bit different for a pale ale but it's one of my favourite new england brews and i make sure i always grab some when i can.","SixpointJMH","Feb 20, 2003"
2.5,-29.6,3,3,2,2,3,"This beer can be summed up in one word: ""uneventful"". Even on tap, it had no real hops or malts that jumped out. It did not even have that ""pale"" taste that I look for in this style. It was just there, bland. It went down easy, due to the fact it had no taste. This should be called ""Geary's Ultra""","bewareOFpenguin","Jan 30, 2003"
3.18,-10.4,3.5,3,3.5,2.5,3,"Sudsy bite on the tongue. Suds bite the whole way through, actually. Peach notes return in the midtaste with peach-pit bitterness in tow. Finish is fairly non-descript, save for the--you guessed it--peaches.","DarthMalt","Dec 13, 2002"
3.68,3.7,3.5,3,4,3.5,4,"Expected citrus hop aroma from this amber beer. Caramel malt flavor that is almost a bit nutty. Medium body and appropriate carbonation. Slight metallic and mineral flavors compliment bitterness instead of distract you. Easy enjoyable drinking, but nothing spectacular.","yen157","Nov 16, 2002"
4.57,28.7,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Here in Portland, Maine where Geary's is made I have a hard time finding a better beer for the price (now $10.99 a twelve) unless it's the Geary's Hampshire Special Ale when available.","MaineBeerMan","Sep 24, 2002"
4.33,22,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Deep dark copper color, much darker than I expected.  Head was tan/beige, full of rich hop bubbles. Nice floral/hoppy aromas, no sourness noticed. Taste was balanced and better than I expected. Nice sweet malty presence, lots of florals, citrus and hop goodness. Thirst quenching goodness, crisp dry finish. A very good Pale Ale. Better than Bass and lots of others. Cool label too. I had this with a lobster dinner in Maine and it was perfect !","StevieW","Sep 09, 2002"
4,12.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a nice copper color, with a decent head that dies pretty quick. On the nose there is a slight fruitiness, herbs, and herb aromas. The same is found on the palate, slight fruitiness, herbs, slightly sweet, light malt, and a nice bitterness. Finish is bitter and slightly sour. Overall, a good Pale ale...","WilliamPhilaPa","Jun 23, 2002"

4.63,30.4,5,4.5,5,4.5,4,"Nectar of the gods as far as I'm concerned. Perfect off white head, clear light amber color, sweet malty caramel aroma with hint of fruit. This is all a pale ale can be: crisp refreshing attack, almost lemony, followed by bittersweet malt middle, closing to a hoppy, but well balanced finish. Eat your heart out, Bass. A lower score on drinkability because the first sip usually tastes the best. Nicely salty, VERY New England, a true seaside beer, goes great with seafood (hint: take a look at the label). I love malts and this has plenty -- PLUS an incredible hop element to twist it to just the right dynamic. Bliss.","Thrasher","May 22, 2002"
3.78,6.5,4,3.5,4,3,4,"You either like Geary's, or you don't. I happen to like this brew, overall. It's fairly traditional, a slice of Ringwood brewing history in New England and a good drink.","Todd","May 18, 2002"
4.2,18.3,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours a nice pale copper color with a nice head that never sinks completely.  Smell is earthy/fruity hops and slight malt.  The flavor starts off with some subtle hopping that grows into a nice full flavored hop profile.  You can just slightly taste the cascades behind the lighter english style hopping.  There is a nice malt balance to this beer, but not so much that it takes away from the hops.  Clean and smooth in the mouth and nicely drinkable.  This is a fine example of an english tyle pale ale with a touch of american influence.  Great session brew or for a few while working the grill.","Murph","Apr 22, 2002"

3.6,1.4,3,3,4,3,4,"A good everyday brew, nothing extrodinary. An average session brew or introductory pale ale. There's a lot of other beers I'd choose first.","John","Dec 17, 2001"
