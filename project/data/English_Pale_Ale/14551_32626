It could be more exciting if there were a greater hop presence to interact with the esters, in my opinion. Its rather subdued bitterness, and moderated mouthfeel and carbonation make for a very drinkable brew, though.","NonServiam","Mar 02, 2009"

Decent scent, a little bit of jerkyish Enlgish hops and maybe some more floral American, as well? Very malty taste for a pale ale, slight bitterness, but mostly sweet. Goes down very smooth; it's best attribute. I don't know if I've ever had a more malty and less hoppy pale ale, that wasn't horrible. Still, I'd rather have a decent bitter than this pale.","JamesS","Jan 30, 2009"

Not much going on for hops, no lacing or head at all, not much diff than a light beer except for the cool color.

Hops are notably missing. I guess it has a balanced flavor, but I'm not certain that's a compliment here. It's mostly malt, but it's kind of like a good beer in some other style. Unfortunately, it's also a bit watery and fizzy. I wouldn't turn my nose up at a free one. Sorry, the drinkability category doesn't make a ton of sense for a lot of beers.","popery","Oct 16, 2008"

Dark bar made it tough to judge appearance but whatever leeway I was prepared to give was counterbalanced by a thin to non existant head. Smell wasn't bad just barely discernable. Taste was that of a conventional mainstream PA - except for an odd metallic twang that my palate quickly adjusted to, it could just as easily been a Bass.

3.03,-2.6,3.5,3,3,3,3,"12 oz bottle. The brew is crystal clear golden in color with a finger of ivory head that falls to a light coat over top. There is a solid carbonation working up as well. The smell is light caramel, light diacetyl, moderate bread, biscuit, and grain with a kiss of earthy hop. Overall, it is a little faint in the aroma. The flavor is very biscuity with diacetyl notes, finishing with a mild bitter that fades after a few seconds on the palate. The aftertaste is bready sweet, with a hint of earthyness from the hop. There is something about the combination of flavors that is not working well for me; I think it is the sweetness and breadyness in conflict. Mouthfeel is moderate with a moderate carbonation, with a significant drying quality. Overall, this is just okay.

It pours crystal-clear, a few shades more orange than gold, with light to medium carbonation that leads up to an inch of off-white head that reduces to a small collar, leaving little lacing. The bouquet is lightly sweet and consists of toasted malts, caramel?, and citric and piney, almost leafy hops. The flavor is essentially the same, but with notes of orange and a medium bitterness. It is quite effervescent, with a light, dry body that leaves a medium finish. Some bottles from the sixer were so tingly that I had to vigorously swirl the beer to work out the carbonation to make it more drinkable.

Pours a brilliant amber in color, quite nice to look at, with an off-white head of minimal duration and with minimal lacing. Pale malt-driven nose with no hop presence, and a bit buttery (?). First sip is semi-sweet, with notes of vanilla and marshmallow (?). Smooth, creamy mouthfeel, and very low apparent bitterness - carbonation was moderate, medium-bodied. Malt profile has a combination of fruity (banana) and vegetal notes, but there's also some of that corny-sweet goodness that I've grown accustomed to tasting in the broad, American macro lager style: I had probably assumed incorrectly that because this is an orgainc offering it would be an all-malt brew? And someone correct me if I'm wrong, but it's diacetyl and DMS I'm detecting in those parenthetical question marks up above. With the Youngs Special fresh in my mind I'm having a hard time seeing this as an English Pale Ale; off-flavors aside it seems more in line with low hop bitterness, no-frills American Pale Ale. Also, I'm not a 'macro-hater', and I honestly believe that a beer should sell itself on its own merits. With the off-notes I tasted maybe I just sampled from a bad batch? Also, when this keg was added, two others (Grain Belt Premium and Jack's Pumpkin Spice Ale) had just been switched-out - did they forget to clean the lines after swapping kegs?

Nose is somewhat metallic and fruity with a subtle edge of buttery diacetyl, reminiscent of a Bateman's XXX in a way - or at least some other English yeast strain. Hops are mild, floral and grassy... Fuggles? It's medium-light bodied and smooth with a fine, moderate carbonation as appropriate for the style. The flavor offers a nice, softly caramelish and biscuity malt base for the fruity/metallic/buttery yeast character and grassy, leafy, and floral hops to play on. It's balanced in the composition of its flavors, and perfectly backed by a solid bitterness that's omnipresent but never oversteps its bounds. Quite an eye-opener!!! I haven't enjoyed a pint of English pale ale this good in years, and it really takes me back in time. Oddly, I can't place the beer that I'm thinking it reminds me of. Is it John Courage? Whatney's Red Barrel? I'm thinking now that the Bateman's is much more bloody. Regardless, it's really nice, perfectly brewed, and has the bonus of being organic! In fact, if there's anything that I could find wrong here, it might be that it's just a little too clean and perfect! ;) I could easily make this a session ale for a night of darts out with the lads. Kudos!!!","NeroFiddled","Oct 29, 2006"
2.97,-4.5,3,3.5,2.5,3.5,3,"I got this at my local bowling establishment on league night (Colonial Lanes in Iowa City, IA) along with the Wild Hop Lager. The waitress warned me on this one and instead recommended the other, which gave me hope in that this was a REAL pale ale done by A-B and not something akin to a slightly darker Bud Light. Well, I was MOSTLY pleased, the average scores are due to the fact that it just doesn't compare to other better pale ales. It's hoppy enough to satisfy most connisseurs of the style, but for an ""organic"" beer it sure had a syrupy taste to it! I can't guarantee 100% that it wasn't the serving glass though. In short, I'd still rather have a Sam Adams or even a Shiner Bock if the craft brew cupboard is bare at the establishment I happen to be visiting, but for one who really wants a pale ale and nothing else will do, this should be a tolerable substitute for your favorite when you want to go out on the town with your buddies on a Saturday night. I must say I am very happy to see that the strength of the microbrew industry is causing huge macros like A-B to come out with beers like this, I just hope future entries are a bit better than this.","chrishickman","Oct 28, 2006"

It seems that A-B is trying to expand further into the micro/craft brew market, but they're going to need to step it up a little more. This beer is just more tha a little light across the board: low on body, taste and aroma. Not the worst attempt at a pale ale, but about what you would expect from a macro. It seems they tried to gear it toward the macro drinker who might want to try something besides a light lager.","veech","Oct 15, 2006"

Aroma of brown sugar, some definite orangey citrus, even some rind. Mouthfeel is on the light side, but has some heft to it, carbonation level is about medium. Flavor follows the aroma, a slight malt sense but not very distinctive on the tongue but a definite hoppy presence with a sharp twang to it. The close is best, nicely bitter in the aftertaste. Not a standout, but meets the Pale Ale style perfectly well. The price point is a bit high, making it a beer that wouldn't be my choice as many more local types are better and cost less.","ADR","Sep 30, 2006"

I figured with this beer, what the heck, might as well give it a shot for $6.99 which is what I would have spent for Sam Adam's or Red Hook ESB. I must say that this is a good beer. Nice and floral with some sweet malt and just the right of hops for an English PA. The smell is fantastic, I wish I had an air freshener that smelled like this! Some people say that at $1 more than most A-B products this is a ripoff, but what other A-B product would one compare this to? I'm glad that A-B decided not to put their name on this product as it would probably stop some people from buying it, and I have to give props to them for their foray into actually decent beer.","uncggop06","Sep 29, 2006"
