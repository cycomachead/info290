3.48,4.2,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 6/20/2014. Pours slightly hazy deep copper color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings around the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, toffee, toasted biscuit, plum, pear, apple, herbal, floral, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, toffee, toasted biscuit, plum, pear, apple, herbal, floral, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of herbal/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, toasted biscuit, plum, pear, apple, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Nice robustness and balance of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and fruity yeast flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly metallic mouthfeel that is okay. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 5%. Overall this is a very solid English pale ale. All around good balance and robustness of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and fruity yeast flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A pleasantly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Dec 05, 2014"

I wasn't overly impressed with the smell, and it had a fast-disappearing head with no lacing, but the taste was exceptional.

Shame on this company for buying out and ruining a beer that has been around since artist like Monet and dictators like Napoleon Bonaparte. Just another casualty in the war of the beers. Seems any good beers will be bought out and watered down if they sell out. I will not even do the beer review in terms of mouthfeel, ect , cause to be honest its not worth it, as it fails all tests..Now I only speak of the usa version by anheuser busch, I remember the uk version being delicious!","barbats","Jul 26, 2014"

It's much more subtle than it's American counter parts and while it's been an mainstream beer for a while it still holds its own against the new breeds. The first thing you notice is just how damn smooth and drinkable this beer is. All you can say is the balance and mouthfeel are on point and this is truly a well crafted beer. Carmel malt body with a light vinegar note and a hop presence that is subtlety in the background but enough to know its there. Overall a great session ale, a must try classic.","zander4dawin","Jun 23, 2014"

The market is so saturated with pale and amber ales right now that it's easy to forget that the original is still pretty decent. That said, the only time I'm likely to have this is at a restaurant that otherwise has only macro lagers.","illpass78","Feb 17, 2014"

I also agree, however, that it has nothing to recommend it beyond that. It is neither distinctive as an ale, a brown ale, or a pale ale. Everything is moderate and diffused in the slightly nutty brown taste, resulting, well... in a moderately drinkable nice little ale.","greentam2","Jan 17, 2014"

So, I'm still not sure if this is just how Bass tastes, or if it was a stale Bass. Either way it was still drinkable, better than I thought Bass would be, but still far from great.","ElijahRivera","Dec 30, 2013"

Taking a small sniff I almost drew an aroma of sweat from it (Pleasant analogy huh? But it is what came to mind!). But Bass is a wonderful pale ale, tasting somewhat spicy on first contact with a nutty finish. And overall I think is one of the best pale ale's in mass production, and probably in my top 3 favorite beers period.","Curt_rowe","Sep 11, 2012"

Light lemony taste in the middle there that doesn't last very long unfortunately, for that helps the tasting along. It has an odd corn flavoring to it that doesn't really sit well with me for the overall taste, but the lightly roasted malts make up for it a little. Not a great beer by any means, but its worth a try. It also might be better across the pond where it might be a little fresher, but the balance in the one I'm sampling is a little off and the overall taste isn't all that great.

I would definitely choose anything but a Bass. Still, worth it just because this is one of the iconic British Pale Ales and its important to know where you're coming from.

The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, slight fruit, and slight hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, wheat, subtle banana, and slight skunky hop. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this wasn't too bad for a readily available mass produced brew. One of my gripes is that the aroma and flavor on this one were not very intense at all. Sure this would make it easier drinking, but kills the beer in my opinion.

Bass Ale has the history but it's not the greatest historical brew I've had. Every time I've tried it, it seems for be on the flat side.

The nose is subtle, with a blend of hops and citrus. The beer has a semi-sweet malty backbone, with a bitter hop that is not overpowering in flavor, but your mouth absolutely knows it's there. Some nutty and candy-like characteristics to the flavor, as well, but that subtle hops remains vigilant in balancing all the tastes. The beer has a slightly sour aftertaste, but the finish is fairly quick. It leaves the mouth just a bit puckered, and begs to be quenched with another drink.

Light sweetness, bready, a touch of caramel thrown in for good measure, but it's certainly light, and extremely drinkable. The mouthfeel is my favorite part of this beer. There's a steady stream of carbonation bubbles, but it very soft and creamy and makes this increibly easy to drink.

A decent workhorse of a beer - nothing spectacular, but I wouldn't turn one down if offered.","Jwale73","Aug 04, 2009"
4.41,32,5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"568ml brown bottle obtained at McKinnon's in Salem, NH. Pours a crystal clear dark amber body with a good inch of slowly-dissipating off-white head. Smells biscuity with some husky caramel and a tinge of herbal English hops. Biscuit, caramel, toffee, hints of nut, licorice, just the lightest touch of diacetyl (butter), with a good bite of herbal slightly minty and piney hops. Very well-balanced and in many ways subtle in flavor. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. An easy-drinker for sure. It's been years since I've had this beer and I have a new appreciation for it. Balanced and enjoyable, bright, drinkable... A bar for the course to be sure. Just plain good.","MrHurmateeowish","Aug 01, 2009"

The flavours are, overall, pleasant and it's fairly well balanced. However, it's flavours are a bit on the subdued side, it has a definite thin, mineral-water quality, flatness in the finish, and the aftertaste is lightly acrid. It is somewhat reminiscent of the likes of Abbot Ale in terms of basic character, but more muted, less flavourful, less interesting, thinner, and rougher. With food, it often tends to degrade, becoming more roughly alcoholic with little flavour but thin, acrid leaves. Alone or with certain foods, though, it is pretty good.","Offa","Sep 24, 2008"

In other words, a very light alcohol aroma. Gives a nice head that leaves lacing and is complemented by a mediumish grain body that fills the mouth and goes down very smooth. Not much in the taste department, but one of those beers where you and a buddy split a pitcher and you know you're drinking generic stuff, but you don't care.

Has a clear amber color, with no head. Smells of English malt. Taste is pretty good, a sweet and also biscuity flavor with a bit of butter too. There wasnt much hop aroma or flavor, but the bitterness levels were good. Mouthfeel is slightly thin for the style, and the carbonation levels were way too high (compared to drinking this style of beer from the cask). However, I did stir the beer up a bit and this brought carbonation down to much better levels. Pretty drinkable after doing so.

3.81,14.1,4,3,4,3.5,4.5,"Bass Ale, the classic english pale ale pours a nice clear copper color with a white head that leaves a thin layer of bubbles with some lace. The smell is subdued but I do get lots of buttery diacetyl along with some toasted malt and faint earthy hops. The taste of this can be attributed to the famous brewing water, slightly salty very mineraly and even a bit metallic along with a fair amount of butterscotch, toasted and caramel malts and some earthy, very British, hop flavor and associated bitterness. The mouthfeel is decent nothing overly exciting. I've got a special place in my heart for this beer. In college the only package store within walking distance of campus had a very poor beer selection with a lot of cheep macro lagers to appeal to the general college community. So I found myself drinking a lot of Bass and Sam Adams. This may not be the best pale ale ever made, but it is a pretty good one.","fank2788","May 30, 2007"

Feel is standard macro feel, medium-thin bodied, solid to a little high carbonation. Overall, it's a pretty solid beer, although I'm not sure if it's worth the price hike over the standard macro lagers.

Starts off real nice in the flavor catagory with pleasant malt, hop, and diacetyl flavors all rushing into my mouth, but then comes this awful yeast flavor that reminds me of a mix of not-yet-ready homebrew and baker's yeast. All other positive flavors seem to wash out quickly, yet the yeast still remains. Oh, and there was that metallic thing in the finish as well. Starts out nice, then gets really gross. Amount of carbonation in this is just fine by me. Nice and mellow, just how I like my English pales. However, the body is too thin and watery.

3.95,18.3,4.5,4.5,4,4,3,"This is probably the most readily available decent quality ale in America, or at least my part of it. "Pale Ale" is really a misnomer by the way, at least to us Americans who tend to consume a lot of cheap macro lagers. But then again, "relatively pale as ales go" or "pale compared to brown ale" sound really stupid. Anyway color is a sort of gold-brown so if you compare it to American lagers,it falls more into the color range of a beer I might drink (Killians, Yuengling Traditional, Sam Adams, Saranac Smooth Lager) than a pale lager. Seems like this gives more weight to the arguement if you're drinking a bright yellow beer, you're aren't drinking a real beer. Anyway once a neophyte like me wraps his head around the concept that "pale" ales aren't that pale the color is pleasant. The head tends to be well formed though not very high. Smell is malty, almost a bit buttery or nutty as well, with just a hint of bitterness. The taste is sweet and malty up front sometimes with little hits of those nuts or that butter in the background. Finish is fairly bitter, but surprisingly (for me) not unpleasant. Bass is also cleaner tasting than I thought. Mouthfeel is fairly thick but not too thick. It quenches thrist pretty well but I only gave drinkability an average rating because I just never seem to have more than one or two Basses unless I have no other choice. Its so common around here that I actually use this as a standby sometimes when even such ordinary choices as my personal favorite Yuengling Traditional aren't available. All in all, I think this stuff deserves its popularity as one of the world's top selling ales. I'm sure there are better ones out there, and I've even tried at least one superior ale myself, but there's no doubt for almost anyone who's tried it that Bass is a quality beer and a good example of its type. And yes, its still a decent beer when its warm, though I certainly prefer it cold (what can I say, I'm American). A side note- the robust flavor, good quality,and slightly higher than average alcohol content make Bass my favorite beer for cooking.","casualbeerman","Dec 31, 2005"

A gentle pour earned a three finger creamy head that hung around for quite a while. Crystal clear light brown liquid, a bit lighter in color than the bottle it comes in. Smells malty with a mild hop floral. Malts are caramel and a nip of chocolate. Almost nutty. Hops are dark and with some sulphur. Gentle diacteyl. Lightly woody. Much more in the smell than I expected. Tastes diacetyl with mild malt sweet and a hop that comes across as indecisive. The aftertaste sees a resurgence of the butter (that's diacteyl, in case you didn't know) in a stale form. Although the mouthfeel in medium, the beer has a thickness on the tongue. But, it's almost slick and unsettling. This beer is *not* good. I'm hoping this was a bad bottle. I'll have to give it another try at some point in the future. Carbonation is a bit too strong and the acrid on the tongue detracts from the flavor and mouthfeel. Decent lacing on the inside of the glass.","mentor","Sep 28, 2005"

Nice clarity though. And the smell and taste are fairly weak, though there is a nice hint of that classic English style toffee and biscuit taste woven in there along with a creamy malty sweetness.

There is a bit of a buttery aftertaste that helps overall. But for the most part the flavor is nothing to brag about. Mouthfeel is not bad. It has a surprising fullness with a slight bitterness that remains on the tongue. Carbonation is a bit higher than medium level. For the most part, this is a good beer to drink at many bars with limited selections of drafts. There are many places that it ranks among the one or two best on the menu.

Smell: baked red delicious apples, light on the spice, pine needles, slight hint of fresh grape juice behind all of this. Taste: upfront twang of crisp hops that take their time twangin' before some buttery notes comes through toward the middle, along with a slice of crisp green apple. Aftertaste is an unsalted saltine cracker yeastiness as the hop twist recedes in the background, taking its time.

Taste is light floral hops, biscuit like malt, and a hint of fruit (apples maybe from the ale yeast). Finish is clean and crisp with moderate carbonation and very little bitterness. In this day and age Bass is not very unique but it was one of the original English Pale's so you have to give it some respect.

Not much coming in from the nose, a bit of malt, hops, and hints of sweetness. Taste is very nice. I was expected a more watery ale flavor, but Bass has got a rather full body that isn't overly hoppy nor alcoholy.

There is a touch of hops and a nice crisp malty aroma, nothing exciting, but good nonetheless. It has a very mild flavor, again nothing extreme, but it is very pleasing to drink.

The aroma is pleasant, but not very strong. Something of understated malt and a sweet, fruity (currant / other berry?) scent dominates. Taste is so-so. It is an acquired taste in my opinion. Strong hops right up front, with a sweet finish that slowly switches to a dry tanginess at the end. Fairly complex, but not something I would consider all that wonderful. Mouthfeel is actually one of this offering's stronger suits. Perhaps a little over-carbonated, but still manages to have enough substance for my personal preferences - also fairly true to the style.

3.36,0.6,4,3,3.5,3,3.5,"OK, it's not a bad beer. Overall, above average, for sure, but it's just so damned mild-mannered that it's nothing to get excited about. It's quality, with a nicely tuned balance of flavor elements, but it does so at the expense of any kind of strong presence. At the same time, this mellow balance makes it very drinkable, sliding down easily, with nothing to hold it back, but then nothing to make you raise your eyebrows in pleasant surprise either. My real sticking point here is that with so many beers available, with so much more flavor, and just as well-balanced, I just can't justify coming back to this unless it's the best on tap at a beer-challenged establishment. And if it is, I'm okay with that, but I certainly won't be impressed.","Foxman","Jan 29, 2004"

I had a bottle of this at a restaurant a couple weeks ago, that had a much more pronounced aroma. Mouthfeel is immediately bitter and quite carbonated. That gets your tongue's attention! Taste is light bodied, caramel malt backbone with bittering hops. Dry finish. A solid British Pale Ale, but nothing to get excited about. I've noted a significant difference in the quality of Bass Ale, in the many different locations where I've sampled a bottle.

It was the textbook amber hue with a small, but lacey head. There was a fair amount of carbonation, but not too much. It had a fruity hop scent that wasn't too overpowering.

Well Draught Bass is only 4.4% and was certainly the benchmark Cask beer for quality in the UK for many years. As far as I am aware Bass Pale Ale (5.0%) has never been available from the Cask, only Keg. Even so, the stuff that is bottled and kegged that comes Stateside is still a good beer.

This is a very easy drinking beer that is well balanced; cool quality malt, crisp hop balance and fruity yeast undertones balance this beer real well.

Short-lived head leaves a little lace behind. Nice "red ale" taste that balances caramel malt taste and spicy English hoppiness, with a hint of "Juicy Fruit," too.

The aromas are of biscuits, bready malts, and faint hops. The taste is biscuity and bready with a bit of a hop kick. The mouthfeel is super creamy and good....and the drinkability, you may ask?

The aroma is quite average for the style and while it says Pale Ale it is not too strong. The mouth has fairly good body and the finsh is clearly hoppy with a slightly sour aftertaste.

The aroma is a blend of caramel touched with a subtle woody hop smell. It has a crisp, fruity flavor in which is well balanced between malt and a medium level of hop bitterness.

The body is medium with a fine and moderate carbonation that caresses and tingles the tongue before becoming lightly creamy. The flavor displays a rich caramel malt with a mild note of dried fruit against a bold, backing bitterness. It finishes with a rounding note of diacetyl and residual sweet caramel malt followed by some earthiness and sulphur alongside drying bitterness. Welll balanced with a good drinkability.

Aroma is of canned philadelphia mushrooms, toffee, almonds, sweet dog food, and margarine in that order. (Honestly!) What a perplexing smell. Flavor is of sweet malt with no apparent graininess, which fades to a strong metallic tinge, and ends in fizzy dirty dishwater that had caramel candies sitting in it. The fusel alcohols become more dominate in the start of the beer with progressive sips and really becomes unbearable by the end. This beer is intriguing for a few seconds, and looks pretty, but is absolutely horrible. Just a few sips gave me a nasty temporal headache, and I poured 1/2 of it down the sink.

It pours a copper amber tone with a cream colored foam head. At first sniff it produced a mild nutty aroma along with some maltiness, but as the beer settled so did the scent. At first taste it was too cold to get any flavors from the beer, but after it warms it produces a sharp taste with a slightly bitter finish.

Fruity yeast esters in aroma, but the perfumey and grassy (perhaps Challenger?) hop nose provide for a complex, yet clean aroma profile. Mild diacetyl butterscotch becomes noticeable as the hop oils dissipate.  The carbonation is perfect and results in a very smooth mouthfeel.  The body is fairly light, but there are enough malt and hop flavors to make this quite a tasty British pale.  This brew is well balanced-- the crystal malt sweetness and residual sugars are well balanced by the moderate hop bitterness.  Bass finishes with slight biscuit malt flavors and a touch of sweetness. This pale ale is very clean and enjoyable all around.  It's more estery and fruity (and much less assertive hopwise) than the typical American pale, and is a fine example of an English pale ale.

4.2,25.7,4,4,4.5,4,4,"I think a bottle of bass, is an old reliable beer. I will always order it at retaurant or pub where the only other choices are buds, millers, coors, etc. Nice inviting brown color, head quickly disappears but always tastes great. Compliments many meals, and I find it always refreshing. I try to keep some always in my supply at home, but last night drank my last one. Always will be a winner to me.","StevieW","Mar 30, 2002"
4.07,21.9,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"dark amber in color, a moderate head that quickly subsides to almost nothing.   smell is of sweet malts...sort of candy like...perhaps butterscotch?   medium body with the sweet malts dominating the soft hops.  anybody that slams this ale is stupid.  there is a reason why Bass is perfect in black and tans with Guiness or any other dry stout.  i can detect the uniqueness of the water used, which imparts a delightful dance on palate along with the hops.  this is a difficult ale to review...there is a lot going on here.  there must be some reason why Bass is a world renowned english ale.  a classic.","budgood1","Mar 29, 2002"
4,19.8,4,4,4,4,4,"I am a big fan of Bass Ale.  This was one of the beers that introduced me to the world of brew outside of U.S. macros.  It was my breakout brew.  This beer pours to a nice light amber color, has a slight metallic (in a good way) taste, and has a nice hop presence on the finish.  A quality fall-back beer for me.  Many times, this is the best beer available in the bar.","proc","Mar 22, 2002"
3.77,12.9,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Amber in color and a decent head. Out of the tap is the best. One of the great session beers for me.It's even better with Guinness.","Reverand","Mar 16, 2002"
3.45,3.3,3,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Medium amber color, medium sized head.  Crisp, light smell only of hops; the taste is mostly the same, you feel it on the back of your throat and sides of your tongue, with a little nuttiness going on.  Could use some more character, but very drinkable.","nklatt","Feb 25, 2002"
1.98,-40.7,2.5,2,2,1.5,2,"Not good, another one of these English ales which gets a huge wrap, but it is quite overrated, don't like it.","rastaman","Feb 16, 2002"
3.98,19.2,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Of the widely distributed, world wide beers, this is one of the best. Deep reddish-amber color, slightly creamy mouthfeel. Has a slight fruity character, but not overly so which balances nicely with the malt and hops. I slight toasty flavor (toasted grains/malt) is also prevalent but has a small say. The hops are there, but not overpowering by any means (which appeals to me). All flavors seem to be in perfect balance with one another. This beer is complex, not as complex as many, but has more then enough complexity to keep you taste buds interested. A great drinking beer, tough to have just one, and one of my standbys.","bmills1608","Feb 14, 2002"
3.23,-3.3,3.5,3,3,3,4,"On occasion, I will have a Bass if nothing else is available or I am just not going to have a Sam Adams Lager.  I find Bass a very drinkable mass-produced beer.  Always has a nice color with faint bitterness and a moderate malty grain flavor.  It is very average compared to most good beers, but I find it acceptable, espcially if it is not my main focus of the evening.","AaronRed","Nov 06, 2001"
3.9,16.8,4,4,4,3,4,"Better on tap, but a solid choice.  This beer isn't going to overwhelm you with any one quality, but you buy it because you know what you are getting.","geckointhebox","Oct 27, 2001"
3.06,-8.4,4,3,3,3,3,"While this is the "standard" for Pale Ale, I think it has become more mainstream (Bud like) over the years.  I can remember how wonderful this was 15 to 20 years ago, maybe my tastes have changed, it just doesn't seem the same.  This is a very drinkable beer, but there is so much better and made right here in the good old USA.","gwfrankpsu","Oct 19, 2001"
3.76,12.6,4,3,4,4,4,"Bottom line, this is good beer. Not great but good. Are there better beers out there...of course. In terms of mass produced beer (so is Guinness), it'll do better than many others in a pinch.","John","Oct 19, 2001"

Nothing outrageously outstanding mind you, but all the same enjoyable. You'll see this beer cloned all over the beer shelves and in brewpubs, which says enough in itself.
