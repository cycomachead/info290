"Flat. Almost no hop bitterness detected. Aroma was decent though."
""
"Pours a clear, deep gold/pale amber, producing 1.5 fingers of somewhat lasting, beige, frothy head that leaves sheety webs of lace. Aroma thin malty caramel, floral/herbal hops & not much else. Taste is biscuit malt with a hint of caramel & toast, with a slightly dominate earthy floral/herbal citrus & pine hop profile that provides bitterness. Hop forward & not balanced as the style demands. Finishes dry & more bitter than expected from the style. Producing a lingering caramel/toast & dominant citrus peel/pine resin bitter, astringent aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with slightly less than moderate carbonation, moderately heavy astringency, creamy with a light pepper bite in the finish."

"acually quite a nice try for an English style bitter. would drink again if I come across."
"Not so great  English-style Pale Ale.  Not bad but nothing about it is extraordinary."
""
"Overall- A really good English Pale Ale, not much love on the beer sites.  but I quite enjoyed it."

"It was a fairly good beer"

"O - I like the restrained flavor."

"It's ok if you want a light beer."
""
"Earthy? I thought... Woody. Really good after I tasted it. Didn't think much of the smell, kind of over-ripe. All-in-all I thought this was a great representative of an ale."
"Pleasant, easily drinkable EPA with fine balance of malty notes with the barest hint of hops. Not an overly complex beer, but overall a good representative of the style."

"Quite citrusy on top. Well bodied. Refreshing. Probably not a bad summer beer, actually."

"Pours a dark orange with a thin head. The smell was a little subdued but I got some citrus from the hops and then a bit of sweetness from the malt. The taste was rather refreshing but a bit forgettable. Some mellow hops in the beginning with a malt finish for a clean aftertaste."

"O 3.75. Easy drinking and delicious. Highly sessionable and a good everyday brewski."
""
""
""
""
"O: Excellent session Ale.  This brewer is underrated."
"Cask, dry hopped with cascade (I think). Much more flavorful and better mouthfeel than the bottled version. They should stick to serving this on cask."

"Overall, decent beer. Not bad, but nothing to get all excited about. If in the mood for an easy drinking beer, I'd have it again; just wouldn't go seeking it out."

"O: I think that this would be easily accepted by someone that is used to American Adjunct Lagers. The taste profile is similar enough to be approachable. That is kind of he nicest thing I can say. It felt overly carbonated. The taste was similar to an AAL. I bought it because I liked the name."

"O: really enjoyable pale ale"

"Pours medium dark amber, no foam. Vacant nose, mild beer smell, but little else emerges. English pale taste, little burnt toffee, stripes of citrus in between. Mild. Bready. Modes carbonation. Run of the mill pale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Much better than I was expecting. Very drinkable with a nice crisp finish!"

"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a solid milder beer to drink for a while."
"Pours a pale golden body with decent head and a slightly sweet aroma, more akin to butterscotch than caramel and there are some oily hops in this beer. Beer is light bodied and doesn't have much going on, to be kind, as the hops are oily and bitter with not too much of a flavor profile and the malts are sweet and noticeable but overpowered. Not too much to add other than this is just a bland, basic beer."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer poured a dingy cloudy amber color. The beer had a pretty small head. The beer smelled like it was going to be really hoppy and I caught a hint of honey. The beer was slightly hoppy but not too much. it was bout like a Sam Adams. I liked the beer even though it was IPA ish. I would buy again."

"Like the label says it pours brass in color but with a minimal head that is gone in a flash,somewhat dull in appearance.Aromas of caramel malts and leafy ""green"" English hops,I don't get much of the Cascades but do get a whiff of the Goldings and Fuggles.The feel is lighter with not much carbonation,on the flatter side.Caramel/biscuit flavors with underlying herbal notes on the palate,pretty unassuming really.I guess it isn't bad for the style but I'll just go and by a Landlord if I want a true EPA."

"Overall - Clean and well made as would expect from Heavy Seas, but didn't love it. I think a little more maltiness would balance the flavors, and slightly less carbonation would enhance its drinkability."

""
""
""

"O- Mediocre pale ale."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours translucent light amber red with a small white head. Smells of floral and piney hops, slight citrus. Tastes of watery malt profile with slight floral hop taste. Beer is heavily carbonated but still goes down alright. Overall a slightly above average beer."
""
"A clear but dark copper color with a substantial white head that doesn't quit, leaving decent lace trails. The aroma is a bit, um ....English with a somewhat funky herbal hop idea. Mellow and not greatly attractive to me but not bad. The taste brings pleasant herbal hops with a hint of muted citrus. A little pineapple perhaps and bready toffee ideas. Kind of slinky as English hops seem to accomplish. The body is medium plus with a delicate carbonation and a creamy feel."
"O- Not bad. Well-made but lacking in any distinct flavors."
""
""
""
""
"On draft. The beer is orange and mostly clear with a thin, off white collar. The aroma offers dank hops, biscuits, grain. A touch of floral hops with a hint of citrus. Caramel malt and a touch of toffee. Relatively light in body with lingering pine bitterness. This pour was nice and fresh. Nothing outstanding here, but this was by far the best option at the time."

"Overall not really worth purchasing again in fact I don't care for the style much but I tend to try everything Heavy Seas puts out."

"The feel is bright, crisp and smooth with a leafy, tea-like dryness in a light-medium body (leaning lighter)."

"O: Decent pale ale â€“ nothing really special but enjoyable none the less."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A decent example of the style perhaps, but pretty boring and low key. I much prefer american pale ales to english ones. Quite drinkable but nothing I would buy again."
""
"The taste is not special. It is not as dark tasting or as bitter as many of this style, but it has a great balance. The aftertaste is very nice. It lingers on the tongue with a nice little bit of bitter. I would buy this again or be happy with it from a sampler, such as this was."

"Pours a beautiful copper amber with perfect clarity and an excellent head of foam that fell sweetly to a layer of bubbles on top. Good lacing and effervescence. Nose is caramel malt with a little fruit behind that. Toasted malt, pale, a touch of bread and as it warms some lemon and floral. Taste is subtle and balanced. Malt is forward and the hops are bitter. Very simple, nothing fancy here and no complexity. A moment of yeast on the tongue gives way quickly. Hops are earthy and the malt stays sweet and round. The bitter is sharp but not explosive. Finishes dry and very nicely. Body is thin,clean and a little creamy with ample carbonation and a good mouthfeel."

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a dark golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts, a touch of hops. Taste is well balanced malts and hops, easy drinking and refreshing. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall makes a good session beer."
"Taste-Toasted malt, earthy noble hope note, leading to a bit of a dry finish. Nothing fancy here. A nice, English style pale ale."
"Overall can be a real good beer on cask as they often add fresh hops. Not as impressive on its own but perhaps a good intro for someone not hop crazy."

"O - Highly drinkable as a session beer at under 5%. Nothing more, nothing less."

"O: This is an enjoyable, balanced beer with a satisfying hops presence balance against some malt character."

"This is a rather simple pale ale. It's refreshing and easily drinkable, but the flavor lacks and depth. I was bored with this beer, but it would make for a great BMC replacement beer for the newly craft-initiated."
