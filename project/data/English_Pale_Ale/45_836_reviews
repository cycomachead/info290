"Grain, light floral notes, with a fairly bitter finish. Crackery malt, and there's a bit of a tangy/metallic character."

"I was pleasantly surprised after pouring this from a 12 oz bottle.  The color was a rich, nutty brown with a decent off white head.  The aroma was very malty with just a hint of hops.  The taste backed up the aroma with a nice caramel malty flavor with just a hint of sweetness in the finish.  The mouth feel was rich and the carbonation level very good.  I would recommend this one to any fan of English style pale ales."

"Drank on-tap at the local Flying Saucer. Appearance is a hazy, nondescript copper, with a white head that creates no lacework and has little retention. Nose is watery, with notes of corn. Tastes like it couldn't decide what it wanted to be when it grew up: an English ale? A pint of Yeungling? As other reviewers have noted, hop and malt characteristics are poorly matched, as if someone had blended a so-so lager with an ale. Although some of the characteristics might have been likeable in a more balanced beer, it's less than the sum of its parts. I did not enjoy it at all and would certainly not try it again."

"Overall: I love English ales, but something about this is just not my cup of beer. This has a light, tart quality that I am not expecting from an English ale, but it is maltier than I would want a summertime backyard barbecue beer."

"O-easy to drink. low ABV. smooth and refreshing. These factors make this a very drinkable ale. however...there is nothing that makes it stand out. definitely wont satisfy those looking for the big hop flavor. not a favorite, but could see myself putting another back as I'm grilling after work."

"bottom line: Brooklyn is 3 for 3 with me (Pennant, Brown, Summer) ... this brew is solid and it might be just enough different from Brooklyn's Summer Ale (also an English pale ale) to offer some legitimate variety. and as always, Brooklyn gets a little bonus bump from me for brewing up an authentic English style."

"Overall - Awfully drinkable, but not especially distinctive."
""
""
""
"Overall: This is not a very bitter ale, and is not for a big hops fan. But I did enjoy it. The flavor was not as complex as other pale ales, but what it had was quite enjoyable. An extremely sessionable ale, as it is refreshing, goes down smooth and leaves you wanting more - plus the relatively simple flavor means you won't miss too much if you get a little drunker. Not quite one of my favorites, but I would definitely drink this again if I was in the mood."

"DATE TASTED: August 9, 2013 ... GLASSWARE: Howard's Pub pint... OCCASION: home alone--meeting the family in Point Pleasant tomorrow... APPEARANCE: swirling activity below a two-finger thick froth that paints (rather than laces) the glass the body is a burnt orange with steady effervescence--drop-dead gorgeous , and only a foot away!... AROMA: smooth, malty base with a bit of bready dough that mellows the secondary citric kick with a surprising apple scent--otherwise, reserved, as an ESB might behave... PALATE: understated, almost buttery smooth with little resistance from teeth to throat--a bit watery...TASTE: a basically thin malt profile pervades; typical doughy funk intertwines with buttery notes and a bit of toast--not feeling this one as impactful or winning a specific category... OVERALL: Plusses include its attractive pour and easy sipping nature; negatives (if there is such a thing for Brooklyn brew) is its paper-thin fortitude and rather doughy aftertaste...bearing the ""pennant"" moniker, this beer should be more of a success that its name suggests; as it is, this beer is merely serviceable, but a lesser player in the mix pack than I hoped. I was surprised at the more favorable rating afforded by other reviewers, but I will stick with my experience..."
"Medium body, nice carbonation, chewy and brisk on the tongue. Drinkable EPA with a nice balance and tempered sweetness level. Definitely would drink this again, especially at $3 a pint."
""
"O: Overall, this was a good ale, though it does not really stand out, kind of run of the mill. I could drink it in bulk and I'd probably have it again though I don't know if I would seek it out myself again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability: This beer is solid. It offers great flavor and is very drinkable."

"Overall- Extremely similar to Anchor Steam, if you like that then you should try it. Personally, not a big fan of it. Not very flavorful but does have some spice to it."
""
""
"Copper color with mild carbonation and decent head. Fruit and vegetable notes with a bit of sweetness in the aroma. Tastes similar to how it smells with a bit more complexity, spiciness and a hint of malt. Unfortunately this beer has a bit too many vegetable notes for us."
"Cheers mate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Aroma of flowery malt and bread. Pours deep orange/amber body with a finger of white foamy head. Head does not last long but dissipates into a thin white film on top of beer. Taste is bready, slightly datelike followed by a crisp bite. Very enjoyable!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a great American pale ale. Crisp, clean, full of flavor, with a long finish, and nicely balanced between the malt and the hops."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours orange amber with good clarity and a head of off white foam that fell fast & left just a little lace behind. Bubbles up bombing from the bottom. Nose is classic and very understated. Strong and steady malt base, biscuit, caramel and toast. Hops are subtle citrus, pine & floral. With the smallest hint of yeast on the nose the balance is fantastic and appetizing.Taste is delicious. Smooth, buttery, mellow. Toast and biscuit, the malt opens up deeply sweet and round. The hops are not the star here. Not much bitterness just the slightest oily touch in the finish and no aftertaste. Very mild with apple and grass as it opens up. This is a very simple and quiet English Pale Ale that is true to the style, graceful and full."

"Overall: There are a few different things going on with this brew that come together pretty well. The complex malty accents are pleasant and Brooklyn seems to be on to something with their use of many different malts in their beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"A lot missing here. Carb, body, esters, hop flavor... just an imbalanced English Pale. Doesn't remind me of a baseball beer neither."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before March 2013. Pours slightly hazy orange amber color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of caramel, toast, brown bread, pine, floral, citrus, grass, and herbal hops. Nice and pleasant aromas with good strength and balance. Taste of carmael, toast, pine, floral, grass, brown bread, citrus peel, light nuttiness, and herbal hops. Light floral bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, pine, floral, brown bread, citrus, grass, light nuttiness, and herbal on the finish for a bit. Very nice flavor robustness and balance of malt/hop flavors; with zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very good English pale ale. Nice balance and robustness of flavors; and very smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."
""
""
"From a bottle. Pours a moderate golden-copper color. The nose has plenty of biscuit malt plus a bit of Continental hops. Very light citrus. A bit of yeast comes through in the flavor. Mildly hoppy. Quite drinkable."
"Not bad for an English Pale Ale that's out of date. It seems the biscuity flavors are replaces with honey, which works out fine. I'm sure this would have been much better fresh with some extra hop action."
""
""
"I know I give generous ratings, but for Brooklyn Pennant it is especially well-deserved. This beer has all the great characteristics of English ale but is a really good, reasonably priced domestic. All aspects of it are on point for style: look, smell, and flavor. Not too sweet either. The best part is the bready and yeasty flavor that comes through. Hop flavor is aromatic, slightly herbal, but not so bitter. It can only be perceived as bland if you drink it too cold. This is ale... let it warm a little to let the flavors surface. One of my favorites."

"decent brew, definitely an english style. it pours caramel in color, totally clear, with plentiful rising bubbles that form an inch of thick white head. the nose is bitter, i expected caramel malt sweetness, but its not really there. lots of malt though, bready and a little heavy, with only a gentle bittering hop profile on the back end. flavor is the same as the smell, a little dull, but a balanced brew. still hardly a hint of sweetness. smooth texture, mellow but ample carbonation, and a medium body thats right on. overall a decent beer, not one ill be reaching for with any serious intent from the mix pack, but one i definitely dont mind."

"O-a decent pale ale, easy drinking"
""
""
""
"Overall this is in my opinion the definition of a highly-sessionable brew. Great balanced, easily drinkable, demanding of another sip. Worth many tries."
""
""
"O-Rather disappointed with this one. Very bland and thin, might be a nice alternative to BMC lagers but there are many better pale ales out there. Tartness is really off putting. In fairness the bottle was 3 months past its best buy date."
""
""
""
"o: very drinkable, just a good solid beer."
""
""
"O: A very drinkable and refreshing brew that seems true to its style, if a bit heavily carbonated and, perhaps, a bit sweeter than average. [3.9]"
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium body, medium to slightly high carbonation, drinks clean enough. Maybe this style isn't exactly my cup of tea but I found this one to be a little bland and unmemorable. You could certainly do worse in terms of an everyday, session-strength English style ale but there was something distinctly unexciting about this for me. Seems like I might enjoy it more cask-conditioned than from a bottle."
""
""
"O: A very nice English pale with great drinkability. Worthy of a few pints"
""
""
""
"Overall – Quite nice and drinkable. A fantastically easy drinking brew with a good flavors."
""
""
""
"Pours a mostly clear copper, amber color with a slight white head. The scent is mild with a blend of malts and hops giving it that indication it will have a slight bitter taste. The taste is better than average with a smooth grainy taste that is sweet and quite refreshing. The after taste is where the hops start to take over with a crisp, dry finish. A very drinkable brew that stands true to its style!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"12oz bottle purchased in a mixed 12pk at Market Basket in Somersworth. Pours a clear amber body with nearly an inch of khaki-colored head. Herbal and citrussy hops are the most obvious things in the aroma. Herbal and citrussy English hops dominate the flavor, with bits of bread and caramel notes. Light to medium in body with moderate carbonation. Pretty drinkable. Quite good. Pleasant, quaffable, and balanced."

"another one of the mix six beers, been a while since i had a beer from brooklyn brewery. poured from the bottle into a pint glass.a nice copper color with a decent head but no lacing. a nice body and flavor. decent hop presents. a nice beer which i wish i would of bought a second bottle of ."
"As i drank through the rest of the glass the flavors seem to find eachother a bit more but still seem to battle for dominance. Not as bad as my initial reaction to the beer, but still doesnt seem right. These flavors just dont wanna blend."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- I think this is a pretty good beer and I would buy a six pack of it to keep in the fridge or I would get it on tap."

"Not a bad beer. A decent offering from Brooklyn."
""
""
""
"O: If it's been in the fridge, try drinking this beer after it's been warmed for a half-hour to an hour - the mild fruitiness is interesting. Pretty solid offering from Brooklyn Brewery - I like to alternate between this one and the Lager."
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm not sure if this beer really is a good interpretation of the style. It is nice and mild, but it just doesn't hold my interest very well. Moreover, the malt is balanced more by tartness than bitterness. Still, it's tasty and refreshing."
""
""
"Overall: it's a good beer an honestly for the price it doesn't disapoint. Right now having at my cousin's BBQ, to follow with a great cigar, Salud!"
""
""
"This is a solid, balanced beer but it's not incredibly flavorful. It's refreshing and drinks well on a hot day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Fantastic English pale ale. Fits the style to a tee and does not disappoint in any category. Highly recommended as well as a great example of a style that's starting to become neglected by the craft breweries."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I can feel the English malt here, but its definitely more caramelly than Im used to. I didnt know the style, but I thought it was a Marzen. I wasnt sold on the taste, it was a bit too caramelly, too sweet, and had an off flavor I couldnt pin down. Malt forward with no hop flavors at all. Smooth to the point of being dry."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a light, bright, copper-orange coloring with a thin, sparse film coating the surface and a fast, steady flow of carbonation bubbling. Aromas are light, with a roasted toffee balancing out a floral and effervescent hops profile. Flavors are light and a little sharp from the carbonation, with a roasty toasty toffee backbone and some floral and peppery hops lightly cleaning up the end of the palate. The aftertaste is a tangy sweet toffee flavor, with a clean, crisp, and someone astringent finish. Good flavors, but the body doesn't do the beer any favors."
""
""
"Pours a thick, dark copper color with a slight head that dissolves relatively quickly. Smell is sugary and malty – very nice. Not an overly sweet beer – more just malty and smooth – very easy to drink. Amount of carbonation is pretty perfect. A great session beer. This would be a great choice for more bars and restaurants to have on tap as an alternative to not only the Budweiser and Millter Lites, but also to the Sam Adams and Blue Moons."
""
""
"Overall: certainly drinkable. My understanding of the style is limited but this one seems to be relatively on par."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I like it. It goes down quick and is a very drinkable beer."
"this really lives up to the name as it's light enough for summer, malty enough for fall, and hoppy enough for spring... would like to try this on tap."
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
"Drink- Just an Eh beer for me. Didnt leave me feeling overly joyed in comparison to some Brooklyn beers I have had."
""
""
"O/D-Not very impressed with this beer. I drank it quick enough but was never truly satisfied. Would not try this again. Too mediocre."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - The malt flavor is the standout here, while the hops and other spices lend a nice complement. Easy drinking and very sessionable. Definitely a good beer."
""
""
"OK, but not amazing. Not sure why this is classified as a pale ale - it's more like a bitter/brown ale. Decent malt and yeast presence, but too much stewed hop character and not enough aroma. Drinkable enough but nothing special."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Ok watching a game beer. Sort of a more flavorful Yuengling (I say this as a compliment). Nothing special though. Could use less carbonation and something to make it more unique. Gets a 3.5 because it's more than the sum of its parts, but doesn't fit the style and doesn't ""wow."""
""
""
""
"Its still a very drinkable ale and considering so many of the larger company brews, this one is still better."
""
"Lots of the maris otter taste, which is to say there isn't much going on, just a general beer blandness. Like a little bit of tea with it. I think this is just kind of like their bmc baseball crowd type of niche beer. There are no off flavors, its a very mild breadiness and smooth flavor profile. Its pretty soft all the way around aside from the carbonation, its up there to keep the mild bready current from weighing down on the aftertaste. Really, you could make a lot of those silly bmc slogans they put on their commercials off this beer."
""
""
"A 12 oz bottle poured into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a dark amber color with a one finger head that dissipates quickly. Smells of a high sweet malt, not that much hops, but is fine for the style. The malty tastes dominate, with a nice hop finish that balances the whole beer. The beer is extremely drinkable with proper carbonation, and one that can definitely be drank all night. Overall, a very fine English Pale Ale that will probably become a fallback for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, good easily drinkable but semi bland flavor. Kind of lacking in the hops department for a pale ale. But decent brew."
""
""
""
""
"O: Interesting ale that is a little on the sweet side; but reminds me of some of Fuller's offerings."
""
""
""
""
"Poured a 1/2"" beige head of both fine velvet and soap suds. The body is burnt orange in mass tone but held to the light it's more of an apricot. There's a pretty nice smell of malt and mild hops. Taste, although in the spirit of mainstream BMC ballpark brews, also happens to be richer, creamier, and sweeter in the process. Body is a little on the weak side, and there's a soapy aftertaste, but overall this is a nicely put together beer easy to enjoy many of at the park or at home."
""
""
""
"I have had friends tell me they detect a vinegary taste to the beer, but I can't seem to replicate it."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - It's actually a nice, basic ale in my opinion. It's got that vibe of a lounge, playing pool. This beer in it's flavors seem to bring me some nostalgia. And I like it. As far as the beer goes, it's basic, but refreshing and crisp. Big malt flavors with a decent amount of hoppyness."
""
""
""
""
"O: a pretty solid beer, what ive come to expect from the good people down at Brooklyn, just quality and solid all around"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Good not great. I was underwhelmed with how little hop flavor was in this. Given it's english in origin ekg or fuggles are at play here."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: This was just and ok pale ale for me. It was easily drinkable but pretty forgettable."
""
""
""

"This beer poured out as a clear bubble yellow color with a fizzy white head on top. The smell was of some light hops and some decent malt aromas. The taste of the beer was pretty well balanced between the hops and malts. The mouthfeel was light and airy, nothing too extreme at all here. Overall this beer is a good drinking brew for a social setting or as a quick thirst quencher. Not too bad."

"An ok lager, ideal for when you don't want to think much about your beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a nice crisp and refreshing beer that had a nice mild hop finish, which just enhanced the drinkability of this brew."
"Overall: A nice ale that can be enjoyed by even the very novice drinkers, light in taste and mouthfeel. An excellent beer."
"Overall: Decent beer overall. While I wouldn't necessarily recommend it, I wouldn't avoid it either."
"Typical english style pale. Maris otter malts come through strong. Cracker/biscuit taste is the backbone of this beer. Not much hops."
"O- Big smell, big flavor, just not the best of either. A solid enough offering though."
"O: Enjoyable brew that even a Yankee fan like myself would drink again."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a bronze color with a 1 inch head. Smell is of malts, some hops, a touch of sweetness. Taste is a good balance of hops and malts, very easy drinking. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a pretty good beer."
"Nice copper color. I really have to stick my nose in there to smell anything at all. If I could describe the smell in one word it would be ""toasty"". As for taste, a good light malt flavor with a decent amount of carbonation. This is a good Fall beer and I see myself having it when I'm not in the mood for something too heavy."
"Moderate one finger head of darker cream white with less than average retention, the lacing forms a thin sheet down the glass sides that slowly slides into oblivion. The liquid is a slightly murky, muddy orange hue, as close to brown as to red, some loose bubbles trying to form beads here and there. There’s some roast in the nose alongside the caramel, honeyed nuts and hard butterscotch candy scents, does have a greener, more herbal side as well with some mixed white citrus spritz, apricot and apple fruit, muscular and lasts for some time. Medium-bodied, the carbonation wants to make it fluffy but it is pretty damn dense, not a beer which just glides down the chute. On the sweet side, the caramel, scone, soda bread pairs well with the peach, apricot, yellow apple fruit. Some lemon peel but nothing sour nor biting. Again, presents a grassy undercurrent but by no means a focal point, brings some bitterness to the finish. Suggestive of complexity while remaining safely accessible, I can see this as an “adventuresome” beer to some. Otherwise, would drink it if handed one but unlikely to seek out for further purchase."
"Pours amber in color, brilliantly clear with a slightly off-white head. Aroma is balanced between hops and malt, a bit heavier on the side of malt. A bit fruity. Maybe some caramel as well. Pleasant. Taste builds up on aroma. Initial low bitterness is followed by smoothness of malt. Medium to light body. Low carbonation. Very clean and drinkable. Overall (in general terms) a good beer, judged to style it's an excellent beer."
"--Overall good for what it is but not one to write home about. The nose is nice and would be sessionable."
"Overall a very drinkable malt forward pale ale. A good example of the style."
"Notes: Inoffensive, easy drinking but it lacks any kind of sharpness or bitterness. The beer is like an alcoholic iced tea."
"I don't know why it took so long for me to review this. Pours a deep amber, very little head. Scent is sweet, hoppy, almost rum-like a bit. Taste is a bit malty, caramel flavors come through, nice even finish. Mouthfeel is somewhat neutral, crisp and a touch sweet. Really enjoyed this beer. Overall, a repeat purchase and a drinkable pale ale."
"I had this on cask at BierKraft. It was reasonably tasty but nothing over-special. Copper color, clear with a thin foam. Bready aroma, more malty than hoppy, English smelling. I think the cask presentation suits it well, probably this is the only way I'd really like this beer. Easy drinking but kind of bland."
"O: Not bad. Easy drinking for sure. Its well made, just wasn't feeling it that much. Still good though."
"Overall not too bad. I would have this again depending on what else is available."
"Overall: Yeah, beer screams ""English Pale Ale"". Not the biggest fan of buttery ales but it works here and Brooklyn hits the mark for style."
"Pretty good beer, not great. recommended, worth drinking, but not a beer you go out of your way for."
"Not bad, but not great either. For a session beer, it would compliment the late summer and fall months of baseball watching well."
"O - the sum is greater than its parts; really quite a good beer; understated and winning for it..."
"This is a very good, easy drinking beer."
"O- my fav beer frOm Brooklyn, a great traditiOnL style done well, definitely having again"
"Brooklyn Pennant Ale makes a nice session English Pale Ale."
"It was a nice beer overall, with some great flavors to it, but I probably wouldn't search it out next time around."
"Brooklyn Pennant Ale pours a clear burnt orange. Head formation is minimal to say the least, leaving no opportunity for the pleasant affectations that come along with a foam crown, namely retention and lacing. The nose is fairly muted, but a little bit manages to make it's way out of the glass. Biscuity malts and a buttery note are what command attention, with some light herbal hoppiness present as well. The malt is more cracker than biscuit, and surprisingly crisp, with just a hint of diacetyl bleeding through into the back end of each sip. The same herbal hoppiness from the nose is back, this time with a little bit of a spicy pepper presence added into the mix. The body is nice and light, while still being solid enough to support the not insignificant malt base. The carbonation though could probably stand to be just a tad more active. Brooklyn Pennant Ale was an alright beer. I wasn't expecting an American IPA style palate shredder as far as hops go, but I do think the beer's a bit too restrained in that regard."
"O - A tasty English Pale Ale, but the flavours could be a bit more bold. Might be good for someone just trying to enter into the world of english pale ales and ESB's, but the flavours are a little too mild for my liking."
"O - Solid beer that isn't too daring but is a pretty good staple."
"It must have been the baseball theme that made me think it wasn't going to be that great. Probably because the best beer you can usually get at a baseball game is Coors Lite."
"O - Not a ground-breaking beer by any stretch of the imagination but from my first sip I thought 'This would be a fine session beer', not too heavy on the senses, yet still retains a comfortable distinctiveness."
"O: I wish the hops came through a bit more on the taste, but this is still a very flavorful well-made beer."
"O - Prefer their brown ale to this. Not blown away by this one."
"Very great summertime ale."
"Not a bad English Pale Ale, though there is a bit of salty umami character that throws me off a bit. On the whole though, the marris otter malt shines through in the nutty, biscuity character and gives it a nice flavor. Not too shabby, though not my first choice."
"Poured a nice light amber, maybe even a deep golden. Slight haze. Thin white head. Aroma is simply pouring out of my glass. Nice citrusy and earthy notes all over, followed by a subtle sweet cereal graininess. This is a solid beer. I wish they made more casks of this. Well made and delicious. Ever so smooth and velvety, thanks to the cask. Excuse my Mickey D's reference, but I'm lovin' it."
"Thusly, i've had their IPA and PA and both were english-style and pretty good representations. I shall continue my research into their product line."
"I have not had this ale in years. It seemed everytime I looked for it, the ale was beyond its freshness date. The mild but interesting flavors and low ABV make this one quite sessionable."
"The beer is alright, but fell a little short."
"I drank this beer, and I took notes on it. But it's almost like I didn't drink it. There's that little to it. Nothing to latch onto, no notable subtlety or complexity to the smell or the flavor. Nothing specifically bad about it, but not much good about it either."
"O- just average IMO in its style..mostly malts and bread..hops missing in this one"
"A decent ale nothing spectacular."
"Not bad, very drinkable, nay, sessionable even. But something I'd be hard pressed to bother paying for again amidst a sea of better, more compelling beers."
"Hey! It's Brooklyn! Who wants an ""English"" pale ale at the ballpark? Youse nose wadda I'm sayin'?"
"D - I'd like to try a fresh one. I'm sure it would have more body and the hops would most likely be a little more present. Still a very drinkable beer."
"Overall: This is one very impressive EPA. I wish more brewers could nail this style so well, as I often get bored by them. Great everyday beer."
"Overall: A pretty decent version of an English Pale Ale."
"I really like the initial malt impression of this beer but it fades very quick. Too watery for my liking. Maybe if the ABV was dialed down a little more I'd write it off as a hell of a mild...I like this but it could be improved with a bit more body."
"O-Not the most flavorful Pale Ale out there, however it is one of the most sessionable. A great ""lawn mowing beer"" to crack open after a day of work. Light but at the same time has enough bitterness to discern itself from witbiers, hefe's and similar styles."
" Grade B-Purchased at Stoney's -- $9.99 per 6-pack"
"A little dissapointing from a brewery that I really like. But it is very drinkable and would definitely drink this over any BMC offering."
"The beer pours a clear bronze color. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes quickly into minimal lacing. The aroma is of floral and herbal hops with a hint of caramel. It is pleasant, but on the weak side. The taste has a hint of floral hops, but it vanishes quickly into nothing. The mouthfeel is light bodied with aggressive carbonation, and a watery texture. Overall, this is a bad beer that I will not be drinking again."
"The flavor is just a little off for me but otherwise a good pale ale."
"This was offered to me as my local water hole was trying to get rid of this beer to make room for a different beer. To my surprise this beer really wasn't that bad. It was a little dark in it's appearance. The taste a slightly little bitter but refreshing none the less. i have never seen this beer before, more less heard of it. It is not a bad recommendation."
"Overall - Pretty decent beer. I would like to try this within the best by date to see if it's any better."
"overall: maybe it's the logo on the front, but this beer leaves me pining for the bleachers at Fenway (just a week or two away). great early summer beer -- i wish they served this out there."
"amber/brownish color with white head. light carbonation is apparent. very transparent. bready malts and fruity notes are lightly apparent. taste is sweet, with little to no hop presence. decent flavor, nicely refreshing. mouthfeel is a bit thin. Nice drinkability. This isn't a ""wow"" beer but a nice easy drinker nonetheless."
"Into a Duvel tulip with a clear copper body with very little, quickly dissipating head. Smell upfront is metallic, as the beer warms up, it becomes sweeter, with a floral hop quality. The taste isn't as sweet but has more of a bitter hop profile to it. It's got a slight dry biscuit-y taste to it. Prickly when it hits the tongue, but not I was hard pressed to pull a good experience from this."
"Pours a light mahogany brown color with a thick off white head and little to no lacing. Smells of sweet malts, hops, and a little fruitiness and grain. Tastes of a little grain. Sweet malts, hops and a little citrus fruit. Mouthfeel is medium with a mild carbonation. Drinkability is okay."
"D - A well-crafted beer with a good balance of flavors. I would probably order it again if I saw it was on tap."
"Price = ?"
"D - The balance of this beer makes it very drinkable. Which might be it's greatest quality because it seems like when I head to the fridge I'm frequently reaching for this beer."
"I think that this brew is fantastic. I have tried a lot of Arcadia's english-style ales and this one blows them out of the park. So much flavor and so refreshing for the style. Two big thumbs up."
"The mouthfeel and drinkability are good if this is your sort of thing. Those who like English ales will love this."
"From a bottle that's best before 2.2011 into a Brooklyn tulip on 2.20.11, this pours a clear and carbonated looking bright medium amber color under a nicely sustained thin head. Aroma carries a moderate flowery hop nose that's also mildly metallic, sweet and possibly caramel noted. Opening has a big carbonated sour and tart citrus feel that quickly empties out into a refreshing malt scrub over the palate toward a pleasant toasted malt and earthy orange citrus finish. Not bad at all for a bottle on it's last good month."
"Pours a huge three finger head. Off white in color. Clear amber body. Smells of crystal malts, noble hops, some grassy notes. Tastes of crystal malts, noble hops, earthy, mineraly. Medium bodied medium carbing. This one is especially plesant for it's mouthfeel, very balanced and neutral. Nothing harsh or offensive. I could easily finsh a sixer of this. $1.75 a single."
"Overall I really like this beer. I think Brooklyn is a great brewery and I'll be enjoying this one again."
"D- Easy drinking sessionable ale. Nice to look at at but lacks any real flavour profile to keep me interested. Lack of hop bite in the finish is disappointing but i cant call the beer imbalanced since any apparent malt note is very subdued. Overall, boring."
"Really nice. Very sessionable."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink and I would enjoy it all year. Enough malts to invite me during the winter and a good clean dry finish that makes it not too heavy. Definitely sessionable"
"Pours an impressive looking clear orangeish/amber with a large fluffy light beige head that leaves a nice slick on top of my beer for the duration. Aroma was malt dominant with amber malts, honey on brown toast and some grassy hops. Palate is medium bodied with average carbonation and just a touch of bitterness on the end. Flavor isn't quite as pronounced as the aroma but was basically some cereal grains, toast, caramel and a slight touch of sourness. Very sessionable but average beer."
"D: Very easy to drink pale ale, even if it is lacking a little something in the flavor."
"Drink - This kind of reminded me of a Fullers ESB, or along the same lines anyways. It was much better than I thought it would be, and I'd be happy to drink it again anytime. It's highly sessionable."
"D - This has decent drinkability. It goes down pretty easy and is decently refreshing. It is a pretty good beer, but ultimately forgettable. I'd drink it again, but I wouldn't buy it."
"M/D - Moderate carbonation and body, easy to drink, but forgetable."
"Drinkability/overall: Wonderful, drinkable ale that is a total treat to have on cask. Balanced and flavorful, yet simple and perfect. I have no idea how to get my homebrew on cask, but I'm going to have to look into it. I know that some people have done it."
"Drinkability - This beer is alright. Nothing fancy, nothing special and nothing really bad. Could be an excellent Spring or Summer brew. Went down pretty easy."
"D- It's a decent, average EPA"
"12 oz bottle as Brooklyn Pennant Ale 55. Pours copper with medium carbonation and nice but short lived white head. Aroma of pine hops with hints of malt. Body is medium and crisp. Flavor of pine hops and sweet fruity malt upfront with a short earthy hops finish. Not bad for the style."
"The feel of this beer is medium to light-medium with a really easy drinking feel. It goes down well and is highly drinkable."
"A nicely drinkable beer, understated flavors go well."
"drinkability: pleasant to drink, would definitely make for a good go-to beer."
"Nice brown, caramel orange color. Thin head that disperses quickly. Smells malty, with crisp, even floral smell of hops. Mouthfeel is very smooth, little carbonation. Tastes malty, with caramel. Crisp and a little bitter on the back of the palate. Overall pretty smooth and very drinkable beer."
"D-Good, this is a nice tribute to the Dodgers, but it's not anything remarkable."
"A pleasant beer."
"d: while not ""top of the line"" English Pale, I find this highly drinkable, and enjoy it quite a bit. I can see if you're turned off by the sourness in the flavor profile that you wouldn't care, but I kind of like it!"
"Overall this is drinkable, but I wouldn't purchase another. I'm a fan of the Brooklyn Brewery but the Pennant Ale isn't anything to get too excited over."
"Suggestion: drink Pennant Ale while reading DeLillo's Underworld--a book following Bobby Thomson's home run ball from the hit to the early 90's. It (the beer and the book) has the rustic, ruggedness of the old times when baseball was really great."
"The final verdict is that it's very drinkable and not offensive in any way, but could use a bit more ""oomph""."
"d: The taste is off putting and makes this a difficult beer to put back"
"Drinkability: A decent interpretation of an English Pale Ale. Very sessionable and easy-drinking. Certainly wouldn't mind having one (or a few) of these again."
"This is an above average pale ale. Nothing outstanding, but the fruit and caramel presence make it worth a try."
"Drink well my friends"
"Overall, fairly enjoyable beer but nothing incredibly exceptional. I would definitely give it a shot."
"This beer would be very sessionable, thanks to the balance. Would be good with food too."
"Not too bad as far as drinkability goes if it's one of a limited number of decent craft selections and you aren't in the mood for something too hoppy."
"A nice balanced pale ale, the fruitiness and floral nature paying clear homage to the old world. Definitely good for at least a few rounds."
"Ho hum beer. It pours mildly hazy and medium to light amber. The head is off-white and looks pretty good. The aroma is mild, floral-ish hops and generic biscuity malt. It's English enough, I guess, and might be a nice beer fresh served from a cask at the brewery, but from a bottle that's not too far from the ""best by"" date, it's nothing special or even notable. The taste is a bit sweet with a gently bitter finish. The mouthfeel is fine - normal carbonation, a bit slick."
"D: Decent enough, would make a good conversion beer imo. I may have been more impressed if the bottle said wheat beer."
"MF/D: light on the tongue, with a smooth, crisp swallow. a decent brew for a hot day."
"D: Good brew, not overwhelming."
"D: As mentioned, this is a very drinkable beer. I definitely could have had more than one for this review but really didn't want to. Good but not great. Brooklyn has made better (see Local #1 or #2)."
"d-very drinkable...I had two doing this review...and it was less wordy than my normal reviews."
"Notes - It's a nicely balanced ale, and even that acidic finish doesn't ruin it. I'm not at all sure what style it is, I guess somewhere between an EPA and a blonde ale. Given the sporty theme, I'm guessing it's indended to be refreshing and tasty but not distractingly complex, and it succeeds at this goal."
"Another great beer from Brooklyn Brewery that I hope to enjoy more of in the future."
"Reviewed from my notes. Poured from a bottle marked best before Nov 2010 into a pint glass. The beer is a clear copper liquid with a big off-white head made of small bubbles. Lots of additional small bubbles are rising within the glass. It has a grassy, fruit aroma. Are those green apples I smell? Some medium colored (not pale or dark) malt sweetness is noticeable. There is a lot of pale malt flavor. A little bit of fruit and some hops in the finish. A kiss of toffee is also in the finish. It has a medium body and strong carbonation. It leaves a slick film on my tongue. I find it to be pretty drinkable. I don't think I would purchase a six pack of this style, but any that came in a variety pack would be welcome."
"D: Drinkable, yes, but I wouldn't purchase another. I'm a fan of the Brooklyn Brewery but the Pennant Ale comes across as more of a placeholder in their portfolio than anything else."
"D: very quaffable, enough going on to keep it interesting."
"Drinkability: refreshing and quite drinkable. I would definitely sit down with a couple of these down the pub."
"Especially if you're a met fan"
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle and had a 1inch tight white head that faded down into lacing that stayed with the beer. The beer was well carbonated and had a wonderful copper brown color. The smell is a very heavy malt/biscuit with slight floral hop smell. Tast very malty at the front with hints of fruit and biscuit, slight floral hop taste but this beer is all malt. Mouthfeel is very smooth not overly carbonated but has a nice crisp finish. Drinkablitity this is a beer that you could definately have more than just one. Great with pizza and is a very sessionable beer."
"D: The beer is very easy to drink and is sessionable."
"Drinkability: The carbonation keeps throwing me - I'm expecting a flatter English ale, and instead I get the higher carbonation one would get with a US beer. It's not bad, but the grassy hop flavor isn't quite doing it for me. It's satisfying, but I think it was better when first poured and cold."
"Poured amber/copper into a pint glass, with two fingers of slightly offwhite head, good retention, and good lacing. Great hints of toffee, walnut, caramel, apple, pear, and herbal hops in the nose. The taste was simply a very good balance of fruit/nut/toffee/malt that progressed to a dry modestly bitter hop finish. The mouthfeel was medium- to full-bodied, with modest carbonation. Highly sessionable ale that I would love to try a cask-fermented version of."
"D: Very tasty and balanced. This is a good pale ale!"
"D - I like this beer; a nice version of the English style, easy to drink"
"Drinkability: This beer isn't necessarily special, but still pretty good. Highly sessionable, I could have many of these in one sitting. A pleasant brew, but not necessarily the first one I'd go for."
"d - Not one of my favorites from Brooklyn; I just think there isn't much going on except some light bready malts. I would much rather just buy their lager."
"Amber red to copper with good clarity. off-white thin head that left no cap to speak of. A swirl of the glass kicks up the lazy carbonation. Sweet caramel aromas with very light floral undertones. Flavor is a lot of the same, sweet malty taste with faint hop character. Very easy to drink, but relatively uneventful ale."
"Nice body to this ale, yet easy to drink even on a hot day. I would not identify it as an English pale ale, but that's just me."
"Pours a copperish color with a half finger head. The aroma is of sweet malts caramel and sugar with hints of floral hops at the back end. The taste has a sweet backbone, caramel malt and some breadiness come through. There is a very small fruitiness in the middle with the end having a slight floral hop bite. The mouthfeel is moderate to high carbonation. Overall it is a good drinkable beer, it isn't the best english pale ale but every solid. Nothing to make you dislike it, but not enough to make you crave more and more like some others for the style."
"This is hardly undrinkable, however. I feel super-hydrated, but not bloated. A refreshing hot weather drink or mixer."
"Had a bottle from a variety pack. This is decent session ale, but compared to most Brooklyn beers (which I love), this beer just isn't that complex or flavorful. There's a little bit of citrus hops and there's a couple caramel and toffee notes, but I want more. This certainly isn't a bad beer, but it can't stand up to Brooklyn's other fine offerings."
"D - very drinkable and crisp"
"It had a somewhat dark amber color, mostly opaque. Head was about a half inch thick, beige and bubbly. Aroma was a mix sweet malts and floral hops. There were some additional earthy sweetness to the taste which was similar to the aroma. Great body, could be a little more carbonated, but not that noteworthy. Great anytime beer that you can find locally, assuming you live in the NYC area."
"Pours a clear amber. Nice dense head leaves some lacing around the glass. Smell is fresh and bready, with some raw sugar sweetness coming through. Some yeasty fruitiness, 'biscuity' as the label says, with nice caramel overtones. Clean and bitter overall, with good carbonation and a dry finish. Decent body. A good, crisp offering."
"D: A nice pale ale. No noticeable alcohol in the beer. The drinkability is reduced due to the high carbonation."
"'Best before October 2010' from a Brooklyn variety pack. Pours a dark golden color. 3/4"" of head which dissipated quickly. Minor lacing, but it's there. Very low carbonation. Almost a sweet flavor and a bit of a toasty taste. A decent offering from Brooklyn, but not my favorite."
"I poured the last glass from the growler out. Pretty disappointed, but not a terrible brew."
"Morey's Bottom Line: For me, the carbonation is what keeps this ale from ranking up there with some of my favorite pales. That being said, it is nice and crisp and if you prefer a bitey carbonation, this might be a could choice for summer BBQ's."
"D- This beer is so dry, clean, tasty and delicate that it begs to be drank. Im really liking this stuff, such a great sessioner."
"The mouthfeel is light but noticeably thick. I would prefer it to be a little less fizzy, especially for the style. I wonder about the freshness on this beer, because it's nothing like I remember having it out of the bottle last summer. I'll try it again but for this pint, I wasn't a fan."
"Overall, a very drinkable beer. Should really stand out with food - maybe a steak and ale pie."
"D: Very very drinkable and sessionable. Good English pale. Personally, I was hoping for a tiny bit more of hoppy bitterness."
"O- Its drinkable, its balanced and intriguing with its earthy aromas. Definitely something I'd like to drink at the ballpark or the backyard!"
"Drinkability: Very sessionable, as all English pales should be"
"Off the pour a 2 finger had quickly rises and fades into a small head. Just more than a crown but laces pretty well. Deep transparent brown with no visible carbonation or sediment. Smell is a strong roasty, nutty, fruity something. Not your typical smell. Almost reminds me of marinara sauce honestly. Taste is a strong earthy and slightly hoppy mix that goes well with the smell and mouthfeel. Very balanced and drinkable."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was a amber color. The beer poured a big tan fluffy head but it went away really fast. The lacing though was good. The beer had a hoppy smell but was not too much hopped. There was a nice malty finish to the beer. I liked the beer and will buy it again."
"The grain and malt flavors overpower the hops and this is just an average beer, which goes down almost watery. High drinkability, but just not a taste that stands out - this is an average beer in every way and just OK."
"Pours a rich brownish copper with nice white head. Fine retention and lacing. The aroma hints of biscuity malt and is slightly fruity and herbal. Very subdued. The taste is similar to the smell with plenty of biscuity malt, some lemon, slight nuttiness and a sweet grassiness. All pleasant flavors, but all pretty boring. It carries a pretty fair amount of bitterness that leaves me feeling like this beer has an identity crisis. I find that this taste is not really bold enough nor clean enough for me to considerate it anything special. The body is on the lighter side of medium and wonderfully smooth with a nice balanced finish. It is probably this beers best attribute. Very drinkable, but I think I would much prefer a well made lager over this beer in almost any situation. Not bad, but not one to seek out."
"Very pleasant and easy to drink, each sip leaves me ready for another. This would make a good go-to for the next time I'm jonesing for an English ale session."
"Drinkability: Good and very drinkable. Definitely a session beer."
"Still, a decent, sessionable brew. perhaps for another season."
"I've had better beers from this brewer without doubt, and in my part of the world it's a little pricey"
"I bought this when my folks came over b/c my father grew up in Brooklyn during the 1950's and was a Dodgers fan. Not one of the best beers that Brooklyn Brewery has produced, but it is easy to drink and refreshing, so it is worth a try. Cheers!!"
"M/D: The thinness is the biggest issue, alcohol is noticeable, and dry. Its easy to drink...but why bother?"
"A little light on the mouthfeel, exceptionally drinkable. I could see kicking these back one after another watching some baseball for sure."
"Aroma is smooth and nutty with toasted malts, but faint. Flavor is clean and malty as expected. Flavor is as expected, malty with a dry and grassy hop finish. Some buttery and sulfur notes exist in the background. Carbonation is high, but pleasant. Pretty easy drinking, but overall nothing too special making me want more."
"And: what a fantastic label! Love the baseball! Sorry I know that has nothing to do with the beer but very cool!"
"D - Oh yeah. Worthy of seving at Ebbets' Field. Jackie Robinson, Roy Campanella, Carl Furillo and Sandy Amoros would've crushed a round."
"Overall, really didn't enjoy this one that much. Aroma and taste were off to me and the metallic aftertaste finished it. The first Brooklyn that I didn't really like and wouldn't have again. Don't recommend. Rotation - avail here in TX but one is enough for me. Just not my style."
"Drinkability: I really enjoyed the smell, but otherwise I didn't think this beer was anything special. I wouldn't buy it again."
"D-really a great all around beer. Maybe the ""fat tire"" of the the east as my wife would say"
"I will definitely seek this one out again."
"Another point for Brooklyn, these guys continue to impress me."
"I tasted this one side by side with Brooklyn's East India and I think I prefer this one actually. I think it's a better example of the style than the IPA is with more complexity. Tasty."
"The bottle needs to be updated here. It actually says Pennant '55 on it now. Pours to a medium amber color with a decent head. Aroma is of caramel malts and flavor is much the same. The beer is rather dry with a slight bitterness but overall it is rather pleasant. I would not say no to this one if offered it."
"Very drinkable. An excellent session beer."
"Poured into a Sam Adam's glass. Nice rich amber color with a big bubbly head. OK lacing. To me I really like this American version of an English pale ale. This is a great session brew to me. Goes down nice an easy. And love the baseball connection too."
"Drinkability: Another very sessionable biscuity beer. I could have three. A lot of the flavor here is reminiscent of the flavors I associate with Abita's beers. This is an above average, not great beer."
"I'm not a big fan. It tastes very generic and bland, with its only characters being generall unpleasant. It's not undrinkable, but it's not particularly likeable. Brooklyn brews some far better beers."
"Overall, not bad, but really lacks depth. Easy drinking but not one you will hunt down. Could be good for drinking around the grill while you wait to eat, but that's it."
"D. Drinkable through and through. Drinks like a pilsner actually with light malts and a good hop character."
"received as a gift and enjoyed it..not over the top but solid in its style"
"Not very exciting, but not bad. Classic English maltiness that improves with warmth. Near-blistering tartness on the edge of the tongue. Well carbonated."
"Easy to drink, and easy to enjoy. A good beer for a session, or even to pair with food. Pork with applesauce or pizza would be a good pair."
"Pours deep amber (is that a mosquito in there...?) with a finger height white head. Appears to be a rather carbonated head. Leaves some decent lacing down the glass, more like chalk marks than lace though. Smells sweet with an emphasis on caramel. Slight tang in the nose from some type of hop. Taste follows the nose, but there is a bit of a strange aftertaste, must be from the malt used. I can't place the exact ""offness"" of it. This has a nice weighted mouthfeel to it, not too heavy and certainly not too light."
"Pours a copper color with a small, white head. Smell is sweet malts with a little caramel. No bitterness in the smell. Taste is biscuit malt with a little bit of hops, but they are fairly well hidden. Mouthfeel is good and this is a very drinkable beer. I can see myself having several of these."
"Overall there was nothing particulary unappealing about this beer however there's a way to go before it should be called above average."
"D- This is a average English Pale at best. There are other better English Pales that I would rather have. Would drink again though if given to me don't get me wrong."
"Drinkability: I would go back to this again and again. I wish it was on cask in my neighborhood more often."
"OK drinkability. I didn't find this one to be very good to be honest."
"D - The most resounding characteristic of Brooklyn Pennant Ale '55 is its dry fruity tartness. It is tart in a different way, however, than an IPA or some other hop-heavy beer is tart. It is also well balanced by a sweet malt presence. All around, very tasty and plenty drinkable."
"D - Not a bad beer but theres really nothing about it that make me want to go out and pay for this beer again its an easy to drink beer but boring"
"Dark golden body with a reddish tint topped with large fluffy white head. Aroma of hops, grass, maris otter, and a bit of pine. Light and subtle flavors of malt, slight hops, pine, and grassy aftertaste. Light in body, light carb., very smooth, and refreshing on the belly and palate. Highly drinkable and refreshing for any season but begs to be enjoyed in the sun."
"D- Very simple, but has enough to keep you interested."
"Amber color with a modest head that reduces to a collar. The aroma has a bit of malty sweetness to it. The taste is OK, it's like a weak Speckled Hen; crisp, a little sweet, a little bitter at the end. Not a lot of carbonation, medium bodied. The drinkability is very good, have another. The BA average has it about right with a 3.63, above average."
"Verdict: In Pennant Ale '55, dem bums from Brooklyn have brewed up a tasty and highly-drinkable English style Pale Ale that's bang-on for the style. If you're looking for a solid English Pale to session, you won't go wrong here."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my SA pint glass. The aroma is slightly sweet, with a hint of hay and citrus. The sweetness of the malt is the dominant flavor. The finsish is crisp with a slight bitterness. The brew has medium body and avaerage carbonation. A solid EPA, but nothing to knock you socks off."
"Tastes much as it smells. Well balanced, crisp and light. Malt starts bready with light fruit nodes, moves into a sweeter middle of mild caramel and toasted whitebread, ends with a combination of sweet malt and light, bitterdry hops."
"Personally: Brooklyn Pennatt Pale Ale is my kind of beer, malty and refreshing."
"Not a bad beer, but very ordinary."
"The light mouthfeel is complimented greatly by the superior carbonation. Overall a refreshing beer, relaxing..."
"A good, drinkable, serviceable beer. One I would gladly sip at a baseball game, but probably wouldn't reach for otherwise."
"D: Quite drinkable, DFW seems to get getting more and more Brooklyn brews and this is right up there with the Brooklyn Lager in my opinion."
"Great Brooklyn offering and very drinkable in the tap version. Highly recommend."
"D: A very nice pale ale in the english tradition, very nicely balanced between hops and malt. Easy to drink and a reasonable level of alcohol makes this a good session beer. Worth trying."
"A worthy offering from Brooklyn."
"I would enjoy drinking this often."
"This is a very solid beer that doesn't do anything really special other than being well balanced. But it works."
"Drinkability: a darker beer that's smooth and easy to drink. A nice rival to beers that are lighter in color and grainer in taste. Not complex enough to be a sipping beer, but tasty and easy enough to drink to be a good session."
"Drinks alright, in style, but nothing special IMO"
"Poured a dark orange color with a small white head.Nose was nice with subtle hops, citrus and malts. Taste is malty, hops with citrus notes, bready and chewy. Medium bodied and tasty. Could be a good session beer. Low ABV was nice and it was well done overall."
"Go Pens! Go Phish!"
"Perhaps classifying it elsewhere might make sense."
"Drinkability: Good drinkability and representative of the APA style."
"A nice summer beer. In a bottle, Best By July 2009. It had a dark amber color in my pint glass, with a medium-sized off-white head. Malty aroma with some sweetness. Bscuit/toast taste, still sweet, like fruit. Rather dry in the mouth. This was a great beer to drink after mowing the lawn."
"d- very drinkable beer, pleasantly suprised with this one, great for a session. thanks sarah!"
"Decent session beer, but not one to go out of one's way for."
"good carbonation. and very sessionable beer. i would drink this in the future but it would be when i was looking for an amber."
"Delicious and with the dry finish easy to quaff. The hops were well balanced by the malts. Refreshing and satisfying on a hot day. I'll be having this again."
"overall a passable beer. nothing to go crazy over but nice to put back on a warm summer day. i would drink it again."
"Drinkability: High, but taste isn't mindblowing enough to drink tons. The fruitiness is a little jaw-tweaking, but overall a solid ale."
"A pretty solid brew."
"D - I couldn't really find anything bad to say about this, I really enjoyed the drinkability and the way the ingredients have a nice cohesion for an above average drinkability."
"Could be a bit smoother. But overall not a bad brew."
"Overall this beer has a lot in common Brooklyn Lager, its style is said to be an APA. It seems to be a mild ale to me."
"Seems much more like an EPA, but a great, full flavor session beer. Not for me though; one is enough for this session. But who knows how I'll feel in the future."
"This a good summer afternoon drinker if icecold however it isn't one that i would search out again."
"D - This is overall a nice beer to have with lunch or enjoy on a Sunday afternoon. There is nothing here that will knock your socks off but a very solid pale ale that is smooth and refreshing."
"D: A very nice APA - quite drinkable. Could use a bit more hop bitterness to balance out a pretty one-sided, sweet malt profile. Still, a nice offering from Brooklyn. This would be a highly versatile beer for a lot of different scenarios."
"if you can find it it goes great after a hot summer event"
"Poured into a pint glass, clear amber, with little head, (white) that dissipated quickly. Smell malty and hoppy, fairly floral and some sweet caramel notes as well. Taste is of medium body, fairly malty taste and medium carbonation, fading to the floral and hoppy notes at the end. Well balanced hoppy finish. Not teribly complex, good ale to have around, good BBQ beer."
"Drinkable, because it was light and did taste somewhat better as it warmed (might have been served overly cold). I'll have to try this in a bottle some time to truly make up my mind."
"M/T - The mouthfeel is pretty good; I would call it medium body. The flavor is also sweet and malty, a little bready and has a light hop finish. This was a nice little brew to begin the 2009 Major League baseball season."
"Notes: I am impressed by this beer and it is far superior to the East India Pale Ale from Brooklyn."
"D. A decent APA, not the greatest definately not the worst. Could have used some more hops and flavor."
"I don't watch baseball but if I did, I can imagine I'd want to drink this beer."
"D- I've put back a few of these at a time on several occasions."
"Best of all it celebrates the Dem Bums finally breaking through and beating them Yanks."
"Reminds me more of an English style Pale Ale. Easy drinking and flavorful. The name is fitting; this would be a great summertime brew to enjoy at a game with a couple of hot dogs. Damn, I'm ready for baseball season."
"It tastes zesty as well. Wow, the flavor is great. Alot of earthy hoppy bitterness. Crisp, with little to no sweetness to it. Reminds me a bit of an English bitter in the flavor. Tasty and refreshing with a nice dry finish."
"D: I've said in the past I'm not a bid IPA or Pale Ale guy so... This is not the most exciting and not the most boring brew I've every had.... A pretty average session brew. One of the better Pale Ales I've had..."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, it's a decent beer that is worth drinking for a while but there are other beers in the style that I would choose first."
"Poured from a pale color as expected. Smelled biscuity with moderate hop aroma.. Mildy piney and grassy. Taste was odd to me very sour. Medium to light in body with very little carbonation as I would expect on cask. Bitter and sour on the finish. I'd try again on tap or in a bottle but not on cask. Average beer."
"D= very drinkable, would go nicely with meals, casual consumption or session. This would be a great on-tap keg for a party."
"Mouthfeel is a bit too carbonated, very fizzy, with a medium-light body. Tone down the fizz and you have a nicely drinkable, quite tasty beer."
"Mouthfeel is crisp and clean, which I like. I'm not sure where the flavor went on this one. The taste and aftertaste is like I just ate some beef stew. Ick. I love me some stew, but I don't want to drink it. The honey that I smelled is absent as there isn't an ounce of sweetness that I can find. Just a weird bitter meaty flavor. This is weird. Avoid."
"Overall - A decent beer with some nice notes, but nothing memorable to make me want to seek it out again."
"Drinkability: Seems like more of an English pale ale to me, given both the hop and the malt profile. That being said, it's good for what it is - a dry, quenching, balanced but straightforward brew. If you're in the mood for that, this one will likely hit the spot."
"High drinkability because of weak flavor. But I could have sworn I liked this beer a lot more the other times I've had it. Maybe a bad batch or it had been sitting on the shelf too long. I'll re-review it sometime."
"Notes- above average. Enjoyable. Drinkable. Great label design. Not a stellar beer."
"poured a dark amber color, with a small but consistent head. No apparent lacing, and the beer had a somewhat flat appearance. The smell was impressive, with subtle fruity elements mixed with a strong malty odor. The hops become a little more noticeable in the taste, but the maltiness remains dominant. A bread-like taste was also present. The medium body was appropriate, but I would have liked a bit more fizz on the tongue. Maybe a little flat, but not terribly so. Overall, this Brooklyn product was a pretty good ale."
"Notes from: 11/25/06."
"this beer pours an orangish amber with an off white head that fades slowly to spotty lacing. the aroma presents a bit of malt, and an even lesser amount of floral hops. the taste brings the malt to the forefront with a nice sweet bready taste with a not much of hop bitterness to speak of. the mouthfeel is a bit late, but it is a pale ale and with the effervescence steaming through the glass I'll forgive it. a beer worth buying."
"D: Drinks light and crisp, making for a decent summer time pale with a modest hopping."
"(rated May 3, 2008)"
"English. Conservative hop bill teeters on spicy malt base. Roast malt, light and crisp, hop bitterness on a long finish. Biscuit on the foundation, reminiscent of an ESB. Great session ale, though I crave more hops. It rides a fine center line; California Steam?"
"Deep amber beer with a small off-white head. Crystal clear - can see lots of rising bubbles. Nearly non-existant lacing. Nose is spicy toffee malt; very mild. Flavor is light caramel malt, very light hop character that leans to the piney. Definitely a maltier APA rather than a hoppy brew. Carbonation is way to high, and masks the flavor. Overall, a very mediocre beer, fairly uninteresting."
"Pours a clear dark golden amber color with a thin white foam head that quickly fades. Pilsner malt in the aroma with a subtle hop presence. Malty ale with a nice crisp hop balance. Slightly watered down with nice hop taste up front that is balanced by a sweet malty center and a dry, bitter hop finish."
"Well rounded blend of malt and hops. Toasted chestnut flavor that tastes a little bit watery to me. I may have gotten a bad batch, I'll have to try this again down the road and re-review. As it stands... overall a decent beer, I actually enjoyed it better out of the bottle than the glass."
"M/D - A little too highly carbonated. If it was toned down a little it would be a very smooth easy drinking beer. Despite the carbonation it is a very drinkable beer just not a whole lot of flavor to it."
"Good beer."
"The taste is sweet-sour fruit (fruit that has gone beyond being overripe), toasty bread, a hint of leaf, with sour fruit in the finish followed by toast aftertaste. It's ightly sweet with very light bitterness. It seems rather English, and particularly like Whitbread Pale Ale, but is a bit bland and one-dimensional with the yeasty, sweet-sour fruit quality really taking over after a few sips. It is not at all bad, though."
"This beer is amazingly drinkable, it's got just the right flavor, it looks good in the glass. You can think about it if you want to and you won't be dissapointed, you can also watch the sporting event of your choice and completely forget about analyzing this beer n' shit! Meaning that this beer is about perfect, despite what folks might think a Pale Ale is supposed to be."
"Overall this beer is a slight letdown."
"Drinkability is pretty high. This beer seems quite versatile. More malt based beer and then hop based. But I'm a little unsure about the sourness."
"Toasty malts and subtle balancing hops makes this a pretty good English Pale Ale. I'd say the type of hop used or something doesn't give it the most ideal flavor, but that's just a personal preference. It's well crafted without any off flavors. Try it for yourself. Recommended."
" This is a decent session beer at 5.20% ABV. Beyond that, there's not much else to say about this. It's weaker than I remember it being and how this is categorized with SNPA and the Three Floyd's Alpha King is beyond me. This seems more like an Enlgish or an aforementioned scotch ale and probably my least favorite of all of Brooklyn's offerings. At least they raised enough money for the Pee Wee Reese and Jackie Robinson statue down at KeySpan Park..."
"Very run of the mill beer. Hazy amber color. Not a great deal of hops in the scent or taste. Mostly light bodied malts. I agree with some of the reviewers who have described a metallic flavor as well. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation. Low ABV renders this drinkable, but the other factors limit this."
"Overall, I enjoy this from time to time, I think brooklyn Lager is better, and their specialties like the monster ale, are amazing. I would get it again, though not in any rush."
"this is brooklyns weakest beer. I mean its just kinda there. It tastes average/good. It smells average/good. Its just kinda there, this is one of those beers thats in purgatory. Its ok, but then again so is alot of macro brew. If you are gonna get a Crooklyn get the lager or octoberfest or brown. this one is just alright."
"Drinkability: Just an average pale ale that is more in the English than American style; forgettable"
"A very safe Pale Ale here from Brooklyn Brewery. An easy drinker with a little bit of hop flavor but nothing that makes you shout out that this is a great beer. It does nothing wrong, but isn't special either. I figured with the reputation this brewery has it would be a tad more flavorful."
"Out of my bottle this one was a classic amber color. A feisty pour produced a billowing khaki head an inch thick that settled back to a one finger cap. Good retention of this cap and lacing too. The aroma was distinctly caramel malt with some metallic elements as well. The flavors were well balanced at first, just enough malt and hops with hints of citrus. Quite middle of the road and uninspired in my opinion. Not unpleasant by any means but it posses little distinguishing elements. The aftertaste is a little resiny and does detract from my opinion of the beer. The mouthfeel was average and the body medium."
"D - A slightly above average session brew. Not much to it, and this brew could easily be better."
"The feel is very thick and creamy, dry and chewy. Quite formidable. It's a terrific ""all-around"" drinking experience (presentation + taste + aroma). The taste isn't a mind-blower, but a very solid ale."
"Bottle is labeled Brooklyn Pennant Ale '55 which as a baseball fan I think is a pretty cool name. The beer is alright. Pours an amber body and after less than a minute is topped with almost no head. Halfway through I looked at it and it appeared more ruby colored. Caramel, malty aroma with a well defined malt flavor. Subtle hops in the finish. Medium-bodied. For whatever reason I was expecting something lighter. I guess the label had me thinking summertime, sitting in the sun, watching baseball, etc. This would be nice during the fall. Ok, so they won the pennant in the fall. I get it. Anyways as I said earlier it's alright."
"Not a bad beer just not great ether. Appearance copper in color one finger off white head that left a nice lace. smell nice fruity and some floral hop. Taste a bit dry a nice fruitiness and a mediem hop presence. Mouthfeel lite in body and mediem in carbonation. Drinkability it was ok in a varity pack but I would'nt buy it on its own."
"Solid. Nothing wrong with it but nothing stood out either."
"Also like the fact it's named after the last World Series winner in Brooklyn, back in 1955."
"Pours an alrady sticky, two finger, bone white head. The cherry wood amber color almost conceals the small, sluggish bubbles rising to the top. The aroma has a strong biscuity malt, wheat toast, with a splash of pine jelly. The tase is equally inpressive with lots of crystal toasted malts. The splash of minty hops with the Englishy malts are a great combo that add to the refreshing quality of this beer."
"D: Very nice beer with no overpowering tones of any one flavor. Definately worth a try."
"This is a smooth, not overly crisp, slightly toasted beer, which is a product of the Maris Otter malts. There are some grape flavors, some dry florals, perhaps a bit grainy and a bit chewy. The grape flavors really present themselves as the efforvesence gives way to a flatter more settled beer. The dry florals are right up there with the grapes. The beer is light bodied, refreshing, a bit dry in the finish, with a slightly nutty aftertaste, and maybe some dryish nuttiness in the finish from the initial pour. This isn't a bad beer, it's pretty standard fare, nothing brilliant."
"Pours a clear amber with a big fluffy head and nice lacing. The aroma is grainy with a hint of hops. The flavor is grainy with a very light whiff of floral hops. There is a surprising hint of bitterness on the back end. The mouthfeel is light and refreshing for summer. Not bad, but not outstanding."
"Drinkability: Like pretty much all of Brooklyn's beers, this is a brew that takes a very simple style and simply does it to perfection. I don't like it quite as much as their lager, but for a nice not-too-complex APA you could do a lot worse."
"OK, so I liked this beer much more than some. Gorgeous rich brown/amber in the glass with a nice frothy head and lacing. Toasted malt with a hint of fruity hops in the nose. For me, the taste is as near ""perfect"" as a beer can be--a delicate balance of rich, caramel malt balanced with a subtle crispness from multiple hops varieties. I tend to judge beers first by how much I enjoy them. This one was fantastic, top to bottom. The last little bit in the glass (even warm) was as flavorful as the first. Truly a session-style beer if ever there was one."
"D: This is an easy drinking ale, that goes down nice and smooth. This has become my go-to beer for a barbeque or for tailgating at Yankee Stadium. Another solid offering fom Brooklyn Brewery."
"D: This is a very smooth Pale Ale, a low ABV makes this a good option for a session beer."
"Recommended..."
"A decent beer. Great for pairing with outdoor summer grilling. A solid offering from Brooklyn. Great beer to satisfy on a hot day without sacrificing taste."
"Pours a clear light copper color with a one finger white head that dissipates quickly with light lacing left behind. Aromas of carmelized malt, floral hops and some tropical fruit. Malty up front flavor with tea, lemon, caramel, fruity yeast mixed in with a dry finish. High carbonation, medium body, this is a mouth cleansing beer with a smooth finish."
"Like most Brooklyn offerings that I have enjoyed in the past, the word that continually comes to mind is balance. I like the ode to their Brooklyn Dodgers and appreciation for their fine city. This is a nice Spring-early Summer beer and I would certainly pick up again."
"Pours a medium amber with a creamy tan head that leaves some nice lacing .The aromas seemed a bit off prunes,mushroom and a moldy bread quality(not a good quality imo).The taste was an improvement,over cooked buiscuity notes as well as some subtle sourness,some faint dark fruit(prune again),rather hoppy bitter finish.This was a very filling medium bodied brew, with a dryer than normal finish.This would go nicely with food,I could enjoy a couple at a time."
"Pours a golden brown with a thin tan head. Not much retention, but good laceing. Aroma is of bread,butter and fruit. Body is on the light side of medium with a good amount of carbonation. Taste has a lot going on. Fruity, with a bit of hops,but also bready. Not a typical APA,but really good none the less."
"D = A good solid ale, less hoppy than most APAs but still a nice drinkable beer."
"Notes: My opinion is that this is a solid beer. Staple for the summer time and surprisingly I liked it quite a lot. Good balance. Fine taste."
"Standard sort of amber color. Small white head that quickly receedes. Nice, crisp hop aroma to it. Good hop bite up front flavor wise. The bitterness stands out though not overwhelmingly so. A touch of malty sweetness-almost caramel like. Decent body-the malt profile seems to hold it all together. While I am not a huge plain ole pale ale fan I could do this on a regualr basis. Good beer all around."
"D- It's a pretty easy drinker and a good warm weather beer."
"I think more carbonation would help this one out alot and make it much easier to drink, although i had no problems downing this bottle quickly and could have easily drank more."
"My second beer while at the Milky Way in JP. Wanted to grab a nice beer to accompany my bacon cheeseburger, and this was it. Poured from the bottle into a pint glass. Had a small white head, and sort of looked like a pilsner. Had the same yellow color, but looked a bit thicker and had much less carbonation. Nothing noticeable with the smell. Taste was good though. Not as hoppy as I would have expected, so it didn't quite fit my definition of a pale ale. Smooth drinking, this a beer that I would have like to have a few more of that night."
"D: Pennant Ale is a well-balanced beer, but not sure that I would call it an APA. It's more in line with an English pale ale, but it's still not the best. Still, this beer is decently drinkable. More flavor would help things out a bit, though."
"Smooth, and lightly carbonated with an oily, sticky-lipped finish. Excellent drinkability."
"Okay, but nothing to write home about."
"D- not a bad pale ale, good amount of flavor and well rounded balance. there are better examples out there that are more readily available, but i would never turn one of these down."
"Notes: Pretty simple, and very sessionable. This is a great pale ale, and very different from the hoppy American style I'm used to. The malt sweetness gives the beer a richness that is somewhat lacking in many session ales, and this one really hits the spot."
"Good tasting beer and I could have a couple per sitting."
"Brooklyn's APA ain't bad, but it's far from outstanding. A decent sessionable beer with some flavors."
"D- Definitely one of the dryest beers that I have ever had. But, it is crisp and enjoyable and would make a great session beer."
"D: This isn't a horrible beer, but it isn't a standout, either. I expect a bit more vibrancy from an APA."
"in my opinion the best drink the brooklyn brewery has to offer is the black chocolate stout."
"stu"
"Overall: This was this weekend's ""beer to sip while getting crap done around the house brew."" I like the subdued hops and the butterscotch flavors. Just malty and hoppy enough to be flavorful, yet stay mellow at the same time."
"Overall: A great summer ale -- classic, no gimmicks, well-rounded. Avoid food that's *too* spicy, but this is great with summer fare, as well as a good concoction of red beans & rice."
"Med effervescence, light to medium body with a hoppy aftertaste and a slightly crisp finish. Overall, good stuff but would really have liked this if it weren't quite so hoppy and more of the notes that I smelled had actually gotten to the tongue."
"Overall this is a relatively tasty brew. It seemed to me to be a bit more flavorful and robust than some other APAs but I say that as a good thing. Another nice brew from Brooklyn."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: This beer feels like I imagine(I've never had one)a cask ale would feel. Moderate to low in carbonation with a light medium body. Leaves a somewhat slick feeling on the tongue. This is a beer, that again I don't think I'll be revisiting anytime soon. Sure its okay, but I have to be in the mood for this type of beer, this isn't one that I can sit back and drink all night...too much sweetness, not enough to balance it out. Not bad though, I think I'd like to do this one over Bass."
"D: Not bad. I would drink more if I had them, though I might not be in a hurry to buy more. A solid beer, but not very exciting. Don't get me wrong, many people are not out for excitement. This hits the middle of the road nicely. A respectable beer."
"Pours a slighly hazy golden color with a decent head fluffy head after a hard pour; left a sheet of lacing on the glass. The smell is of biscuity/bready malt, dry grapes, leafy hops and a buttery grainy aroma. The taste is bready malt, with a metallic twang, has a slight sweet fruitiness followed by a bittering/drying hop presence. The feel is thin and not very crisp, finishes slighly bitter. A decent brew that I wouldn't turn down but don't see myself seeking out again."
"Not a run-of-the-mill pale ale by any means but I'm finding it a little thin. Though I wouldn't refuse another one, I probably wouldn't actively seek it out either."
"Brooklyn Pennant Ale '55 pours a light copper color with an ivory colored head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is fairly mild, mostly malt comes through. The flavor is kind of a mess, some metallic hops, some caramel malt and some diacetyl stand out. Is it bad, no, but I don't care much for it. It's more of an English Pale Ale than American, a bit better than average."
"Beer pours a dark copper with a light head that went away quickly. It smells of clean hops with a hint of a malty background. The beer has an initial pleasing hop bitterness that is followed quickly by a smooth malty mouthfeel. It leaves some lacing on the glass and goes down quickly. Certainly one of my favorite beers."
"The taste is a little lighter than what I expected but there's good notes of caramel malt, bread, a little roastiness, and some bitterish hop flavour that does some balancing. Mouthfeel is light, carbonation is medium, and it finishes slightly bready, slightly bitter, and at the end, a bit watery. Pretty good stuff and would be better if it hadn't lost all its flavour at the end. Still, I'd drink it aagin, no problem."
"Pours a nice amber/copper color with a bit of head and a lot of carbonation. Has a nice hoppy scent, not overpowering, although with a bit of egg aroma. Nice taste, not strong and hoppy, more like an English pub ale as opposed to an APA, but quite good. Goes down fine, a nice beer to try."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a dark copper collor with a fizzy off-white head that quickly dissipates into a thin lace. The aroma is sweet fruity malt with hints of biscuit and caramel. The taste likethe aroma features much of the same mixture of malts, ripe fruits and caramel. Overall, this is a pretty decent brew that is worth a try."
"When I poured this one I wasn't exactly sure what I was in for, since I had no idea of the style. I'm still not sure. Its thin and watery, not bad, just kind of insubstantial. Grainy and toasted malts and undetermined hop bitterness are about all there seems to be in the flavor department. Fairly well carbonated but lacking the backbone to maintain a cap of foam or lace. Almost like keg beer poured into a red Solo cup in a basement back in college. Not a bad beer, but nothing special."
"pours a clear medium amber color with a three finger off white head with a easy pour good head retention and lots of sticky lace. aroma comes through fairly strong, fruity, herbal, and hop notes. taste is slightly sweet, toasty, biscuity ending slightly dry. light to medium mouthfeel and carbonation is good. second beer from the variety 12 pack and both very good."
"Is some zesty hop in the aftertaste. I already just have one more sip left, and I'm hesitant to take it, for then it will be all gone. I have thoroughly enjoyed this beer. And if anyone can help orient me to the flavors here, I would appreciate it."
"The overall taste is great with excellent mouth feel. The after taste had a strange hint of something that I can't describe. It wasn't bad, just different. I like this brew and would definitely drink it again. I think you could drink several of these brews in an afternoon and really enjoy them."
"First I have to qualify my review by saying I had a few of these at a local bar, on tap, but only available in plastic pint cups! So judging color and lacing among other things is kind of tough but who knows when I will see this again on tap around here. Even in the cup this stuff exhibited a fair off-white head over what appeared to be a fairly clear medium copper color brew. The aroma was mild but gave off some malt, almost a brown bread scent. The flavor was instantly gratifying, a bit creamy with a peppery crisp carbonation and sweet biscuit malt. Surprisingly, I don't find much in the way of hops going on here but what there is would be on the herbal side, fairly dry. All in all a decent blend and a welcomed sight compared to all the other macros on tap at the bar that night. It certainly is drinkable but the dry quality probably wouldn't suit that purpose as much as others, by my tastes. Definitely deserves a try and should be much more than serviceable to all. Another Brooklyn success."
"M + D: A bit watery, overall. Not bad, but lacking a bit in body. Certainly not a bad ale, but not really calling out for more."
"Brooklyn Pennant Ale pours a crystal clear copper with a nice foamy head. The aroma is sweet pale and crystal malt with hints of fruity esters and hops. The flavor is mostly sweet pale malt with a nice light toastiness. The finish is crisp with a light bitterness and just a bit of earthy hop flavor. This is definitely a nice session beer, very drinkable and a nice addition the the mix twelve pack."
"Brooklyn Brewery makes some of my favorite beers, but this isn't one of them."
"Pours a crystal clear golden color with slight amber tones, nice frothy head and great tracing. Aroma is quite fruity, almost like Juicy Juice, with some lightly toasted notes, good herbal hop presence and a nice freshly baked bread feel. Flavor is solid overall, a malt leaning APA. The finish is a little harsh with a dry thinness it leaves. A good everday drinker, a little heavy for an APA, but pretty good overall. Would definitely drink again."
"Overall a very earthy malty pale ale, and is easily on the fence from becoming a dry brown ale. A decent package overall, the quality is there, but personally it doesn't really blow my skirt up."
"Pours a clear amber with almost no head. Nose is a little nutty. A little sugary sweet. Flavor is slightly meaty. Medium body. Long staying power of hops in the mouth, though mild. Feel is thin with bubble. Very drinkable, yes. A stable pale ale, but nothing really that fantastic. Might work good as a session beer. But still, there are greater out there."
"Maybe this one is old, not impressed."
"This was the first Brooklyn offering that I had. It's started a relationship that has raised Brooklyn to one of my favorites. Lots of great options."
"Final thoughts  Its an OK beer. One is about it for me."
"Brewed with Scottish Maris Otter malts; 12 oz. bottle with 7/07 notched - sampled on 8/1/07. The beer is lightly-hazed, dark amber with low carbonation, and has a finger of yellowed head that leaves moderate lacing. Rich, dark and vinous in the nose, with a backing of earthy/floral hops - good, but not very strong. On the palate it is vinous and bready, with toasted malts, chocolate, some fruitiness, and a touch of alcohol. On the hop side of the equation, there are green/floral and piney/earthy flavors and a mild bitterness that brings the beer together. The body is medium and well-carbonated, smooth, drying and a bit numbing, and both the malts and hops contribute to the medium finish. Overall, it's tasty, not too complex, and comes across as a light US strong ale. A nice, easy-drinking beer that goes great with food."
"In my opinion a must try for British ale lovers, Brooklyn Brew fans, and even Belgian lovers who crave complexity."
"Brooklyn Pennant Ale '55 is disappointing on the pour and doesn't improve much throughout consumption. The brew is a bronze color with little head, at most one finger, despite an aggressive pour. There is a sweet maltiness in the nose. This continues to the taste, which exhibits a toasted fruity flavor with only a hint of hops. There is an unfortunate sourness at the finish that further detracts from the taste. This is not a beer that I want to drink again."
"Poured into imperial pint glass. Color was a burnt orange with a thin 1 finger head. The head didn't last long at all, and left only a very thin ring around the glass. The aroma was mostly wheat bread with a hint of alcohol. Taste was malty and very slightly sweet. Felt good in the mouth, no extreme flavors or feelings, coated nicely. Very good going down."
"Honestly not fan of Brooklyn brews so went in not expecting to like all that much and not blown away. Asked bartender what this one was all about and described as hoppy- just didnt see it."
"D: The greatest thing that stands out is this beer's ability to balance malt and hop, while keeping both sides from being too overpowering. A quality American Pale Ale I'd say, and very drinkable, but doesn't overly impress me, either. Still, an easy sipper that I'd take over a lot of others."
"I'm not that experienced with Pale Ales, so I was surprised to smell and taste tropical fruit on the first sip. It doesn't last long and quickly turns to malt, but it was an interesting twist on, well, beer in general. The novelty of fruity (estery?) beer kept me sipping away. Appearance was also good, opaque tan with a persistent creamy head. Good drinking."
"Sampled as Pennant Ale. The beer is a bright orange-amber color with a medium thick fizzy head that burns off pretty quickly. Spotty lacing on the glass. The aroma is bready malt with some hops thrown in. Medium-bodied with a sweet malt character at first, followed quickly by a moderate bitterness. Some sweet toffee is present as well, but overall this beer is pretty vanilla. The finish is piney hops with a shortlived sweetness on the back end. Average."
"Pours a four-finger off-white head that fades slowly to a thin layer leaving some lace. Crystal clear amber color. Malty nose. Light-medium carbonation and light-medium bodied. Flavor is malty with a sweet apple juice undercurrent - not much but not what I was expecting from a pale. Best before Feb 2008, 12oz bottle $1.50 from Capitol Convenience Concord, NH."
"drinkability - Enjoyed this beer, bought this is variety pack. Nice drinking beer."
"Brooklyn Pennant Ale pours a deep amber color with a thin mocha colored head leaving generous lacing around the glass. Very malty nose with some roasting evident, there is the essences of marshmallow and fresh yeast wafting from the glass. Welcoming taste of warm and moderately roasted malts; unctuous and sticky in the mouth, this brew is an enjoyable and rewarding libation. Crisp, somewhat lean and refreshingly effervescent may I say Batter Up!"
"Pours a light orange with half a finger of head. The scent is laced with hard biscuit and buttery malts with some interesting woody hops. The taste gives more of the same. I'm enjoying buttery scones- really not a bready taste, but a harder biscuit. And the hops are woody, slightly earthy and lightly bitter on the back of the tongue. The carbonation is perfect in this beer. It dances through my mouth and goes down cleanly, leaving a great aftertaste. All said I enjoyed it fully, though perhaps the hops were not as assertive as I've come to expect from an APA."
"Picked up the Pennant Ale '55 in Brooklyn's Party Pack, but I've seen the Pennant Ale in stores all around New York. Poured out a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. Thin head and not too impressive on the smell. Already smells heavily of malts. Taste was a little powerful on malts. There were hints of some fruits, but lacking a hops balance to mellow out the malts. Great mouthfeel and drinkability though. I could down a couple of these, but the malty sweetness would eventually slow me down. Overall, I would say this brew is a bit out of place as an ""American Pale Ale"". The word unbalanced comes to mind."
"Picked up in Ohio recently in the Brooklyn party pack. Served in a pint from brown bottle. Pours a nice amber, brown with a cream like finger thick head. Very nice malty, fruity smell with inviting hop arouma. Taste of sweet, biscuity malt then breaking down to a citrusy hop flavor. Good balance between the malt and hop. This a good beer that I wish was more available further west."
"Drinkability: Definatly a very drinkable APA with a very pleasant aroma and good flavor profile. Malts mix nicely with the hops to make a juicy session ale with complexity."
"Into a pint glass, pours a nice copper amber, a half inch head down to a thin foam with scant lacing. The aroma is similarly scant, not much but a faint biscuit malt and some fruitiness, and a buttery diacetyl. The taste is much the same, but much more assertive, with a British character to it almost. And so, while the mouth is quite nice, good body and a fine carbonation, it almost screams for cask conditioning. Now that, would be a tasty beer. As it is, its pretty stock, but still tasty, and a decent session beer for watchin the game."
"Decent mouthfeel, not an overall bad experience...but I've had better."
"D: Despite some shortcomings, this was still a pretty drinkable brew. A tad bit less carbonation and it would go down even easier."
"Overall, a fairly disappointing beer from a great brewery. A shame to call this one a pale ale. We all know that Brooklyn can produce some phenomenal beers.... it's just a shame that most of their standard line up is this bland and boring. I guess you have to appease the masses (not just the beer geeks here) to pay the bills..."
"D: Goes down very easily but the taste just isn't there. I can't see myself getting another one of these... I may not finish this one."
"D: The sweetness and crispness make this a nice option. I'm going for another right now."
"Not a bad pale ale, and not a bad beer overall. However, it doesn't fit my image of the style, which I usually like to be a bit more hop-filled than this presented itself to be."
"A bit of a disappointment after having some of their other great beers. Better than some but not up near the top."
"This is a fairly well-balanced APA, that doesn't try to be too hop happy or complex. It's just an easy drinker, a nice balance between the bread-like malts and floral, somewhat herbal hops. Finish is not too dry, either. This is a consummate session beer, and great for a warm summer evening."
"Confusing beer, but maybe the sour twinge on the after taste throws the whole thing off. I don't think it's going south and may have been intentional, but didn't sit well with me. One and done."
"Pleasant beer. Nice full, smooth flavor but too much of a bitter linger aftertaste for me."
"Pours a nice amber-red color. Made with Maris Otter malts. Nice, thick head. Aroma is nice and malty and beckons within. Taste is somewhat thin at first but then explodes into a nice, malty finish, almost toasted. It's somewhat slightly smoky as well. Not too bad for a pale ale. It's more malty than hoppy. Sessionable. I believe it deserves a decent rating for that alone."
"Drinkability: Oh! Oh, I say! This reminds me of the Acme Pale Ale I had earlier today."
"I can't help but imagine this would be a real treat on cask. Once again I am impressed with Brooklyn Brewing. They make a very nice (quality!) product."
"Light to medium body.some grainyness and a bit of cloyingness. Easy to drink,just not a beer i would want to drink all night."
"D: I've had better APA's but this one is do-able. I'd really like to see the carbonation kicked up a bit and a touch more diversity in the malt character. Fair"
"Has the typical golden yellow ale color, not much of a head. Aroma is pleasant and inviting with a strong fruity hint. Flavor is malty with a touch of fruit and just a whisper of hop bitterness. This ale is very smooth but just a little bit on the watery side. A good summer beer - little wonder its name is a celebration of baseball."
"This is a pale ale for octoberfest fans. The malt flavors had a real Munich connection for me, but the bitterness and grapefruit grounds this in the new world."
"D-This is a decent APA, nothing earthshaking."
"This beer pours an amber color with a generous head. The smell is deliciously malty with a hint of lighter nut--like almond or peanut. The taste is refreshing and seems to encompass the whole palate. Darker malts are most apparent, and their taste lingers for minutes after the beer has been swallowed. A bit of a roastyness as well. Going down there is a terrific amount of carbonation--not too over bearing, but still keeping it lively. I am a big fan of this ale, and true to name it hearkens back to older, more traditional ales."
"D - it's just good enough to rate good, I think this one is meant to be drank right out of the bottle, which would kick the drinkability up a notch."
"Smooth and medium bodied, this ale goes down easily. Could be a session brew for certain."
"Pretty copper color, nice clarity, but the tannish head dissipates rapidly. The aroma is very nice, with a solid maltiness and caramel balanced by a light citrusy hop. The flavor is good, but has some tea-like notes and there is some tannin mouth-puckeriness evident. Mostly the flavor seems to start with a solid maltiness that rapidly dries up and blends with hop flavor that reminds me of tea (again), lemon, and a little medicinal notes. Not bad but not great either."
"The neck collar says it all,its all in the malts."
"extremely drinkable but would i want to have more than a few? pours ruby amber, little to no head. smells like a cross between warm pabst and maybe sierra nevada. the first sip was hard, the soapy aftertaste kind of put me off. but after a few sips it kind of grows on you. not to the point where it becomes something i would seek out but alright. there's nothing remarkable about this, it's average across the board."
"Cheers2Beers"
"Drinkability: Very drinkable it goes down easily. I really like this"
"A very enjoyable beer that inspired, by far, my corniest review yet. That aside, this was an excellent mix/balance of caramelized malts and subtle hops - just right. Could easily see this being mistaken for an ESB. Would go great with a big, greasy, super thin pie slice , just cheese. Kudos to Brooklyn for a perfectly balanced beer. Very enjoyable & recommended"
"This brew pours to a copper color with a fair sized light tan head that has some retention that left some lacing down the side of the glass. The aroma is a little odd (not in a bad way) as I am picking up some different fruit like flavors, a little too sweet malt scent and maybe a little to much butter? Let me say this, it is not a bad smelling brew just not real good IMO. The taste also while being good seems lackluster as the first thing I notice is a buttery flavor that seems to dominate and really seems to stick around. The finish that surprisingly seems to be very un-bitter is more metallic in nature. Overall I would classify this brew as a slight disappointment, for me. I think that it is a pretty easy drinking brew but I would grab others first for a session. One of the weaker beers in Brooklyns line up."
"D- not bad-but not great. Not a beer you have to choke down."
"Decent EPA, I mean APA."
"I would have to say the taste consists of ""basic beer flavors"" - no complexity or anything really interesting. Again, not bad, but nothing to cheer about. Kind of a blah lingering aftertaste. Quite watery in the mouth with very inoffensive carbonation (not enough, really). Easy to put down, but that's about it. I'm not yearning for more."
"The mouthfeel watery, one of these is my limit."
"A flat pour, possibly due to the 1/07 BB date. Still that heavy, flushed, amber that I remember. Clean & crisp on my nose. Quite doughy & sweet initially, the backwash keeps me constantly gulping. Nice & mild(Quite mild actually), easy & satisfying. A staple in every sense. :)"
"It's a decent, basic English-style pale ale. Not really what I would expect from this brewery (I've had several others from it and have been impressed). It does have a nice balance and the flavor isn't bad, but nothing really makes this one stand out as anything special."
"Poured a decent amber with a big fizzy head. Smell was more malt then hops, but still not at all bad, had a bit of a grassy tinge to it. The taste was about the same. Decent for a APA, but not really my cup of beer. Too much malts which through off the balance for me. But not a bad brew."
"Drinkability--nice and agreeable, I'd certainly drink this in the future."
"I got this pint at Malones in Lexington Va. It poured a deep brown. There was about two fingers of head that was very fluffy. There was a lot of lace that was also very fluffy. The retention was also solid. The smell was very malty with not much else to it. The taste had a coffee flavor. This all combined for a smooth mouthfeel and a good brew."
"Poured 12 oz bottle into a glass mug. Nice, amber color with a small head that dissipates rather quickly. A ring is maintianed, but otherwise the frostoness of the beer is gone after the first minute. A mlaty smell with a nutty, malty taste; no hops really present at all. A nice, smooth mouthfeel. A pretty drinkable beer; definitely saving a few for my friends."
"12 oz bottle. The brew is a brilliantly clear golden color with a finger of ivory head over top. The head falls to a solid coating over top, and a decent carbonation is seen in the brew. The brew looks like it is glowing at the bottom of the glass. Inhaling over the glass, I find lots of toasted and bready malt, with a mild caramel underneath. The hops come across as more earthy in nature; they blend nicely with the toasted character of the malt. A sip brings me a good toastyness, with a raisin fruityness, as well as some bready sweetness. It is a nice combination. A mild earthy hop hits more on the finish, along with a very, mild bitterness. Mouthfeel is thick, with a very mild carbonation. It could use a touch more carbonation in there to balance it out. I think this one is pretty drinkable. Even though it is not traditional for a Pale Ale of any flavor that I know, I think they work well together. It's like a pale ale with some special b or aromatic in there."
"While some Brooklyn beer is little better than average, most of what I've had lately has been very good. Unfortunately, Pennant Ale '55 falls into the former camp. This bottle is still a few months away from its 'best by' date so age can't be a factor. My suggestion, for what it's worth, is to start over and come up with a beer that is worthy of such a great name and a great label."
"Thanks to AKSmokedPorter for the taste!"
"D - A good APA..less hoppy than I expected. Good use of malt. Very drinkable - I'll pick up another when I get the opportunity."
"Mouthfeel was on the thin side. Medium carbonation with a fairly smooth finish. I doubt I would ever seek this one out again."
"Cheers!"
"Had a 12oz bottle of the new pennant ale. Was just about ready to hit the freshness date, should have looked before i bought it. Had a decent complex hop aroma but really didnt translate well into the overall taste. Was an overall good pale ale, however i think i am growing out of them, need a little bit more hop punch. Worth a shot. And i am definelty going to try a fresher one in the near future."
"The drinkability id good to better. Goes down quite easy. MK"
"D: I can drink a good amount of these. A good malty session choice, even if I will probably confuse it with their Lager in the dusty storage bins in my brain."
"D: Not a great PA, but definitely drinkable. Fittingly, this would be a great beer for baseball games or session drinking."
"This beer pours clear orange with a fluffy, lasting white head. Minimal hop aroma, some light grains. This doesn't get one's hopes up but this beer turns out to be well put-together. It's very different from what you'd expect from an American style pale ale, but it's quite good nonetheless. Fairly light, dry and clean, with some caramel malt sweetness, just balanced by brisk carbonation and mild hops. Doesn't compare to other APAs, but on its own merit, this is a fine beer."
"Pours a bright copper with a small amount of lacing. The aroma is of caramel malts, hops, and generalized sweetness. The taste is slightly bitter with good balance of the malts, clean finish with a slight aftertaste of bitter hops. The mouthfeel is crisp and well balanced. Very drinkable, a great session brew for watching a ballgame, etc."
"Light body, easy session drinking brew, but carbonation is a bit heavy. Also a bit clean, perhaps not malty enough? This one is not bad, but like many others have said before me, it doesn't stand out in any particular way. Worth a try, but only slightly above average."
"Pretty decent stuff. Not writing home to tell mom about it, but drinkable and enjoyable. A typical golden / copper hue with waining retentiona nd lacing. A typical maltiness and citrus hops aroma and flavor. Moderately estery and fruity. Bready and yeasty. The body just doesn't really pull the flavors and textures together. Lightly undermalted doesn't allow the fullness or breadiness to bond the flavors and unify the beer. But quality and nice nevertheless. Safe and a bit banal."
"Over all it doesn't really taste like a pale ale, but is a good session ale none the less."
"Picked up a six-pack of Brooklyn Pennant Ale '55 at Sparrow Wine & Liquor Co. in Hoboken (a very, very beer-friendly place with good prices). Came home, cracked open a bottle, poured into an old-style mug that showed off a nice coppery color. Head was light and thin, but the carbonation reminded me of a lager or pilsner...I wondered if this was a lagered ale or some such. Smells great, a lot of malt and earth to go with the hops. First mouthful reminded me of a Scotch ale, with some good malty flavors. The hops balance it out nicely, especially after the beer settles down a bit. Good overall mouthfeel...you definitely know something's hitting all your tastebuds. Not a very heavy beer, however, which makes it quite drinkable. I'd be very selective pairing this one with food, because I have a feeling that it would be great with simple fare, but could clash with more complex dishes. I don't know if Pennant Ale '55 is a home run per se (because it would've been a five across the board), but it's very much a two-RBI double."
"A mid/dark gold with the big head this beer takes a second to warm up get its balance. I first tasted more malt than hops but after a bit the hops came to the fore. Very sessionable with a real full mouthfeel , I would bring this beer to a BBQ where i wanted a food friendly beer that I could drink a few."
"D: This is a good beer for sittin and sippin a few."
"Pint at Barley's in Greenville, SC."
"D: It is refreshing and highly drinkable but is lacking for a Pale Ale in my opinion. Before logging on to the site and seeing the description I really had no idea what this beer was trying to be. A decent brew over all but didn't do much for me."
"I like Brooklyn beers a lot so I was a little disappointed. With great APAs out there (SNPA, Anchor, Smutty 3F) in the same price range I don't think I'll go back tot his one but it's not a bad session beer but not on par with Brooklyn's lager or bigger beers."
"Comments: I enjoyed this but am curious whether the sour taste was intentional or the result of improper storage at the distributor/retailer. As I drank the bottle, the sour taste became less evident."
"Seems almost more an ESB to me... but it pours a medium amber color, moderate to slight head retention. Aroma is very light, I don't get much out of it. Taste is slightly sweet, and earthy hops. Mouthfeel is okay, drinkablity is okay too, not outstanding, but not bad at all."
"I enjoyed this beer due to its good balance."
"Pours with a tea-copper color with little carbonation. Has a thin lace of head with a little more clinging to the sides. Smells similar to a macro lager with a slight roasted and malty smell. Feels very smooth on the tongue with a little fizziness. It tastes malty and goes down smooth. It leaves a slightly bitter aftertaste, but the aftertaste it's is quite mild. This is a smooth beer the has an awesome smooth and malty feel to it. I'll most likely have this again."
"M&D: Mouthfeel is on the light to medium side. Well carbonated and clean. Defintelty drinkable in my opinoin. I have enjoyed this beer before and will continue to, especialy in the summer months."
"Overall an average APA. I would have prefered a bit more hop."
"Rusted amber color with a medium foamy tan head that dissipates quickly. After a minute not too much remains of the head and the lacing is weak. The aroma is floral and bright with a grainy edge to it. Taste is a bit thick with tons of a biscuit flavor in there. A bit of diacetyl comes along with the huge biscuity taste. Finish is a bit sweet as well as a bit grassy and also a bit metallic. The body is super rich, which could be good for some beers but its way too much for this simplistic offering, esp with the lack of carbonation. It gets cloying fairly early. Not really too drinkable. Disappointing."
"Cheers."
"3/10/07 Update: had again on tap, very malty and sweet, remains very good"
"Notched as best by April 2006"
"Pours quite a pretty rusty red, with a bit of head, and not much lacing. Quite clear. Smells hoppy and a bit fruity. A bit of citrus hits the nose pretty quickly. Tastes malty, very malty. There's some fruityness in there, banana perhaps, and I get some faint hints of lime. Some nice toastyness/breadyness/biscuityness near the end that really brings the flavors together. Mouthfeel is a bit thin and watery. Quite drinkable- light, crisp, good thirst-quencher."
"drinkability: quite"
"Drinkability: A nice affordable decent beer that could make for a nice session beer. It's not the best beer made by Brooklyn, but it was ok."
"Overall, a beer that is easy to drink and would be good on a hot summer day. I liked it, but really don't have a lot to say about it. I'd recommend it if you are looking for just a pleasant beer to drink. This would probably be a good one to introduce to your BMC friends."
"Mouth feel is light bodied and is actively carbonated."
"Overall impression: Well balanced and very drinkable. Nice example of an APA that hasn't been over-hopped."
"Okay, no a bad APA offered up by the folks at Brooklyn. Well balanced and easily quaffed at just over 5.2%. Worth a shot."
"I could easily picture myself sitting at a ball game with one of these. It is very easy to drink and quite refreshing especially with the nice carbonation. I wouldn't go out of my way to buy this again, but I'd happily drink it if someone else was paying."
" I can't think of a easier drinking beer off the top of my head. Low abv but high in satisfaction, methinks"
"A really drinkable beer, and given it's fairly low ABV you could easly enjoy these bad boys all day long"
"M & D: Mouthfeel is odd. Slick and oily makes it go down smooth leaving a slight sweet malt flavor in your mouth. Not a very simple ale--complex malt/hop notes leave you scratching your head. Drinkability is rather high as its not a heavy ale. I would have another one. One of the better ones I've had from Brooklyn."
"I think this beers biggest attraction is that it is quite easy to drink, even with the ""buttery"" attributes."
"Translucent bright copper, lacking in carbonation in both appearance and mouthfeel. Aroma is sweet and malty, like fresh, doughy baked bread. Flavor is earthy and metallic and has a chewy rye bread notes. I could ask for more just a bit more carbonation on the palate...and so I will: Can I have a bit more carbonation on the palate? This may be brewed in America, but the flavor is downright English. A nice, flavorful beer that would be a delight on cask...in an English pub (though the amount of carbonation here is reminiscent of cask ale). Certainly one for a session."
"Overall, I'd say that this beer is miscategorized; I'd call this an English-style Pale Ale, not an American. For what it is, it accomplishes its goals decently enough."
"This is a very drinkable beer. I think it is a good transition for people trying to get away from macro brews."
"Overall: This isn't a spectacular brew, it's a good example of the style, but one of its strengths is its simplicity. It's a nice refreshing beer."
"This beer pours a hazy amber orange with a frothy white head that dissipates quickly but leaves a thin layer of foam th whole way down the glass. The smell is mainly malty exhibiting characteristics of berry fruits along with underlying hops. The taste also is very malty up front. Again these flavors seem to berry fruits. The hops in this beer are rather faint and tough to distinguish. The beer feels nicely thick with a good leve of carbonation. Overall I do not overly enjoy this beer. It is too sweet for me and I would much prefer a pale ale with a higher level of hoppiness."
"Taste is slightly bare, but the smoky character is there. This is a malty beer, tasting like a good English Pale Ale. Smooth and crisp. The carbonation is light and pleasing to the palate. Superbly drinkable."
"The mouth feel was wonderfully creamy and the body is just right for a pale ale. Very refreshing, and I drank quite a bit of this on the boat during the summer. It works to kick back and relax with, but I am always left wishing for a different pale ale. If the flavor lived up to the rest of the beer I'd get this way more often."
"This pours a reddish golden color amost honey like with a nice 2 finger head.The smell has a real roasty maltness to it.It's really a nice aroma.The taste is a smooth malty carmel flavor.It's not too hoppy,but it has a nice roasty flavor.The m/f is light and well balanced and this is a beer that I will have again,not perfect,but damn good."
"Smelled of hops and mild roasted malt, somewhat sweet. The taste was the same; not as hoppy as I had hoped but had that hop bitterness which faded into a pleasant sweetness. Nothing overpowering and nothing incredible, but definitely balanced and refreshing. Mild carbonation. I use the word mild a fair amount in this review, and thats exactly what this beer is. Decent but not outstanding. It was quite drinkable because it is clean and refreshing with a relatively low alcohol content."
"It pours a light cooper color with minimal head and only a small amount of lacing. I smell grains and hops, that's about it. The taste is rather mild and un-engaging with somewhat balanced hop/malt profiles. A bit bread-like in the aftertaste, but not much more going on there. The drinkability is good because it's a mild beer and can be enjoyed repeatedly."
"Pours a medium amber with a two finger head and good lace. Smells of a good caramel malt with a slight citrus hop presence, not the amout of what I expect from a pale ale. A damn tasty beer but not enough hops for the style A nice caramel malt with a moderate hop presence, but not enough IMHO. Crisp and very easy drinking. Again, very tasty but scored low due to the lack of hop presence I think anAPA should have. The Brooklyn Lager has much more than it should and maybe the two should be reversed."
"A nice pale ale. I was hoping to drink some Brooklyn Ale in Brooklyn. Amber in color with a white headskie. Quite light with some toasty notes. Hoppy in balanced goodness. Goes down smoothly and is quite the drinkable. I'll have another please."
"Pours light copper with a short slightly foamy head, a little retention, a little lacing. Good carbonation. Smells of light malts, hops, and sweet caramel and fruit notes. Reminds me of #9 without the apricot. Taste follows well, slight hops with a good mild sweetness, very nice. Crisp and clean, good balance. I'd definitely want to get more of this."
"Packaged as the Penant '55. Best before not properly notched on the label. Citrusy aroma comes through very slightly in the flavor, which is mostly dominated by caramelly malts. Enjoyed several while in Brooklyn. Light, refreshing and very drinkable. Reminded me of a fresh Sam Adams. Worth having a few..."
"Pours a light copper color with a thin beige head that recedes quickly. Aroma is estery with some toasted bread and caramel malt notes, and some citrusy hops. Flavor is subtle but complex, some light citrus hop flavors, followed by some fruity ale esters, caramel and toasted bread. Light and refreshing, yet flavorful this is an impressive session beer. I've never had a bad beer from brooklyn, they might not all be spectacular but they are at least descent, this is not a particularly exciting APA but a drinkable and tasty session beer."
"With Brooklyn's good rep, I thought this might be a fluke, but on my way to the Write a Review button, I browsed a couple others, and it turns out it's just an off-brew for them I guess."
"I guess if you want a beer that you can drink and ignore, this is your beer. Unintrusive, mild, forgettable. With so many pale ales in the world of beer, there are undoubtedly better ones you can pick up."
"Easy drinking session beer. Kind of like a pale ale light."
"It's been a few days since I ordered this on draft but I could have swore this one did not seem like a Pale Ale. It's labeled under Pennet '55 Ale (which is a great name IMO). Nice head, lighter in color in comparsion, and not too hoppy. Great carbonation and easy enough to drink to be a session beer."
"This brew is a dark, hazy copper color with a thick, soapy, white head. Its certainly an inviting-looking beer. The aroma is muted malt and grain, along with a peppery, herbal hoppiness. Caramel and lightly roasted malt characteristics. Its a smooth, malt-sided brew, with just enough hop to balance things out. I found it very highly carbonatedalmost too carbonated (prickly, carbonic qualities are a bit distracting). Very nice brewwould make a fine session beer."
"D- This is a very clean beer and it might be a good beer to quaft at a 95 degree day in Dodger stadium but it lacks interest otherwise. The hops are almost absent and the malt is very soft. A light beer can have complexity or at least some characteristics, but I can't find them in here."
"I'd have this again, just wish it was more true to the style."
"Mouthfeel is crsip and light and it is ever so drinkable."
"Medium bodied and well carbonated. Drinkable, but not my favorite from Brooklyn."
"Pours with a nice light brown body and a fairly frothy off-white head with lots of lace. The smell has more of a malt character than a hops character---I expect a bit more hops from a Pale, but the maltiness seems to work well here. Taste was very pleasantly smooth, and had the same maltiness as the aroma. Despite the heavy malt notes, this is still a nice crisp and light ale. Very pleasant, and very drinkable. A nice ale, along the lines of what I've come to expect from Brooklyn."
"D - A great session beer. Light and delicious."
"A very enjoyable and easy to drink ale. Would make a great session beer and a six pack could easily and enjoyably be consumed during the course of a ball game. Very nicely done."
"There is some taste here, it is clearly a British style pale, with some hops and well malted. Medium mouthfeel from nuttiness. Good carbonation. Tad of metallic aftertaste. Tad of bitterness. Decent attractive darker colour and head. Beer was Ok but not that drinkable."
"Damn, this beer is drinkable. Maybe that's why I had another."
"Overall-although solid, I found this APA to be a dissapontment, too much alcohol to be called balanced, not enough in terms of head retention or aroma. I tend to prefer my beers hoppy rather than malty so I'm trying to be fair but still...I expect more from such a good brewery."
"amber with a tan head. the aroma is caramel and a little floral. there is a *slight* buttery character. a light tea aroma too. sweet caramel malts dominate up front and then an herbal hop bitterness dominates the back. there is a light citrusy fruitiness that makes an appearance towards the middle. medium bodied with fairly strong carbonation. good drinkability. a good beer to chill in the context of a warm day with, but appropriate anytime."
"tase is light, malty and raher drinkable. solid malt base accentuated wiht citrus and hoppy goodness. Not an overly amazing brew, but, solid, drinkable, and enjoyable. Could end up being a nice lawn mower brew"
"enjoyed on tap last night at a Bob Dylan concert. Presented as a moderate amber color with moderate white head. Smell is lightly of hops with a malt background. Taste is very mild with a light hop texture and slightly dry mouth feel. Easy drinking. Went well with Bob."
"This beer pours a golden, color caramel in nature. It leaves a white laced head that disappates quickly as you drink. The beer is clear and bright, looks inviting. As you smell it malt, grass, and grapefruit come to mind. The taste is lemon, honey, caramel....this is great session beer one that would go well with blue cheese burger or fish and chips. A dish that has a salty finish."
"As a lover of Brooklyn beers, I can safely say that other offerings from Garrett Oliver are more impressive. Still, this brew is refreshing on a hot day."
"Surprisingly malty given the hoppy aroma. Pretty good balance for a pale ale. Full bodied with good carbonation. Overall, a good, but non-descript pale ale offering."
"Drinkability: I'm not sure if I'm really into this hop flavor and I'm usually a hop flavored kind of guy, but definitely drinkable. I've got more in the fridge from a sample case, so I guess I'll find out."
"Mouthfeel is lightly crisp and smooth on the tongue. The finish is short with caramel and bread tones lasting briefly after swallowing. Very nice drinkability and a good session beer. Simple but enjoyable."
"A decent session beer, but honestly it just tasted like every other middle of the road microbrew. A good thirst quencher but nothing to write home about."
"I first sampled this at a beer festival from the tap and THAT was purely delicious; hopefully I get to have a whole such beer to try again."
"A pretty good version of an English Pale in terms of flavor and overall presentation. Nothing too exciting but no complaints either."
"Mouthfeel is acceptable but not overexciting. And drinkability comes down a bit as well since I don't find this one overly appetizing, but on the right day I could have a couple if I was craving this particular flavor."
"Persistent herbal hops permeate the fruity malt. Light hints of caramel. Rinse, repeat. This beer is a one-trick pony but it has a good trick. Sweet in the mouth with a light crisp finish. Nothin fancy but a well-balanced and tasty session ale. Nice."
"Pours a deep amber color wiht a big sticky white head. Smells sweet and malty with a little bit of hop bitterness. Meduim mouthfeel with a little bit of carbonation. Taste like roasted malts, a littel bit of carmel and citrus hops. Dry hoppy finish. No doubt a classic pale ale!"
"Drinkability: Sure, this is drinkable, but I just found it to be kind of lacking in character. Not a bad beer, but not good as far as Brooklyn beers go."
"Brownish amber pour with a nice head. Great nutty/malty scent. The flavor is quite nice, very malty with some bread/biscuit flavors with adequate hopping and similar nutty/earthy flavors. Finish is extremely dry and toasty. Of all the beers I've had the past couple of weeks, this one might be my favorite. It's simple enough that you can drink a few, but the dry complexity is pretty interesting. Nice effort!"
"woww. These guys are amazing. This beer pours a really nice dark amber with moderate head. The beer smells liek it is going to taste. Really distinctive but really really easy to down a whole 6er of these. Hard to describe but so damn pleasant. The hops are orgasmic. Like other brooklyn beers this one has an awesome mouthfeel, a little stickey. A tad pricey but worth it. One of my favorites and im not sure why. I guess it just aligns up with my tastebuds prefectly."
"D: high marks here, cuz, this is a fine, tasty brew, makes you want to drink a second"
"The smell was a balanced mix of grainy malt, floral hops, and a touch of yeast. Taste was dry and salty with caramel and toasted malts, herbal hops, and buttery diacetyl coming in moderate doses. Medium mouthfeel was just right for the summer refresher this aims to be. Aftertaste was delicate, but long drawn out floral hops. Dry and refreshing, I can see me having several sessions with this while the Red Sox on play on TV."
"A clean dark copper colored beer. Has a nice small bubbled beige head. There is a heady malt aroma with strong overtones of caramel. The taste is at first a light malt sweetness followed by a hint of hop bitterness just before the clean dry finish. A tastey session beer definitely."
"Overall- a nice light ale that is a perfect beer to give to your bud/coors friends. It just might open their eyes."
"Medium bodied."
"On draft at the brewery during a 3/19/05 pubhop. Clear and golden amber with a thick, creamy eggshell colored head. Bits of small bubbles in the center, and a lot of carbonation seen rising. Excellent head retention. Malty, carmamel, sweet and clean, not too much jumping out at you. Slightly frothy feel to it. Very crisp, nicely malty, bit of hops in there but not much. Slight darkened toast flavors left on your tongue, but very balanced."
"i will have no problem polishing this log off. friends have been coming over to try, and not an unsatisfied one yet."
"Mouthfeel is light and well-carbonated, smooth and slick. But pale ale? Uh-uh. This is not near hoppy enough for the style. This makes a very fine Scottish ale -- I might even grudgingly call it an English pale ale -- but it is a very poor example of an APA. Thanks to AKSmokedPorter for sharing."
"Poored much darker than what I expected from a generic ""ale."" For a second I thought I bought their famous brown instead, until I got a wiff of the hops. This brew has a good mix of grassy hops and crisp carbonation, but what makes it stand out is it's hardiness compared to others of its ilk. Very well done craft brew."
"Cream filled 1/8 inch of head with some Picasso-like lacing throughout. Amber hue with 100% clarity but no action in the least. Buttery aspect to nose and a hit of smokiness pulls through as the ale warms. Butterscotch sweetness on mouth and a roasted character that pervades the offering; a tiny hop hit during the closing remarks. A pleasant ale that could be used on a session encounter."
"Brooklyn Ale pours a light chestnut, clear body with some active carbonation going on. Skimpy beige head is shortlived and leaves minimal lace. Nose is mostly caramel malt with an even balance of British smelling hops that add floral and herbal notes. Mouthfeel is light medium, with crisp carbonation. Taste is soft in that English Ale sort of way, with a delicately balanced hop and malt profile. Nothing overwhelms, but the caramel malt seems to fold perfectly into the floral and herbal hops. Very smooth and balanced. Slightly bitter finish with a clean aftertaste. Session ales don't get much better than this."
"One of the better domestic, North Eastern session beers out there. Very well balanced with a great drinkability level."
"Thick, creamy, khaki colored head leaves some thick lace. Hazy dark copper colored beer. Aroma of biscuit malt, caramel, and some floral hops underneath. Caramel and biscuit malt in the flavor as well, with a hop tea undertone. Body is light and airy, almost floating across your tongue without leaving much flavor. Just ok. Decided to check the label and it's about 2 months past the best before date. Looks like I'm going to have to get back to this one."
"Tarnished, reddened copper tones with a decent-sized head that slowly fades back to a nice layer of pock-marked fizz. Lots of malty aroma -- pale malt, nutty bread dough, and a bit of an herbal hop quality. Very solid flavor. Almost altbier like in its smoothness. Slick caramel flavors and a nice light to medium body with a grassy hop balance. Very classic English-style pale ale and extremely quaffable."
"One of those beers that isn't over the top, but in this case that's a good thing. Just a very enjoyable flawless ale that I could drink all night long."
"Overall a really nice beer, wish we could get this out in the West!"
"The pour is a light, clear crystal brown. A dark gold with overtones of darkness in it. The smell is nice, clean hops and a nice malty backbone. The first and subsequent sips are nice. The hops come to the forefront, but not so agressively. The only problem with the taste is the aftertaste. There's this biscuity taste that is just- I don't know. It's like an overwhelming malt that is just too light and too metallic. In a way I think they try to copy the water of Bass or Sam Smith for this one, and almost hit the mark, but nope. No cigar. Carbonation is good, normal, not too overwhelming, but the aftertaste here affects the drinkability. It's not a pleasant thing to have in your mouth for an evening. Call me crazy, but I don't like this one, and am so glad this bottle is the last one in the sixer."
"This is the first beer of four in Brooklyn Brewery's variety case that I am trying. The beer poured a nice copper color with a 1"" head with thin lacing. The smell was fruity and pleasant. First taste and I was hooked. Nice maltiness with a crisp finish. The mouthfeel was pleasant as well. I can see this ale as a nice session beer."
"The aroma is at first hoppy like an IPA. It has a mild malty flavor that is kind of sweet and caramel tasting. The taste is also quite hoppy for a pale ale and I think, is very good. Overall, this is a damn fine ale. Chalk another one up for Brooklyn."
"In some ways, this brew reminded me of a cross between Bass Ale and Sam Adams Boston Ale. This is a nice, flavorful brew and those who enjoy ""pale ales"" in the English vein will probably like this one."
"Drinkability: Would make an excellent session beer."
"A quality session beer. The beer poured copper in color, but with a thicker and foamier head than I usually like. It was not so much the thickness as much as the foam like quality. The hops are quite pleasant (the type I like on a hot, summer day). They are more sweet, than bitter and biting. There are also fruit undertones that make their way into the flavor with the finish."
"Poured out a nice amber/reddish color with almost no head to be seen. Smell consisted of malts mostly with some hops in the backround for good measure. Taste was huge malts upfront, it was quite rich and creamy, when some hop bitterness blended in towards the end, but the malts took over the entire way, even through the aftertaste. I would like to see the malts controlled a little bit and give the hops a little more of a fighting chance in this brew. Other than that it's O.K., I guess..."
"Pours out light brown, slightly cloudy, with a average light tan head. Great aroma, with plenty of orange and citrus scents. The taste is great too. Stays true to the scent, citrusy without being too overpoweringly fruity. Excellent balance of malt and hops. You can really feel it when it hits the back of your tongue. I am thoroughly pleased with this brew and will definitely purchase it again."
"I enjoyed this beer, and feel that it is a good representation of an english ale"
"This is perhaps my least favorite Brooklyn. I was really looking forward to trying it, but I honestly think is is repackaged Saranac. It just isn't challenging. This is not to say it is a bad beer. Hell, your friends would probably like it, but I'd rather drink a real english pale ale. I would give it shot on cask, though."
"Drinkability: Another nice offering from this brewery. I picked up a sixer to have for tomorrow. I'd recommend it."
"Amber coppery colored with moderate carbonation, fluffy beige head. Hops and malty sweetness abound. Rather thin and sweet in the malt department, yet quaffable because if it's subdued floral hoppiness. Good sessioner. Nice fruitiness in the finish. Quality ale from the U.S."
"Great malt taste. Nicely hopped - a character I have come to expect from Brooklyn beers. Subtle nutty flavor comes through. A full bodied beer. Very satisfying. Above average in the mouthfeel category. Medium/low carbonation. Nice thickness for an ale. Easy drinking. Some warming alcohol in the end. On the whole, I think this is a great brew."
"The beer pours an amber color with a thin white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It is malty with a fruity yeast finish. It also has a decent amount of aroma hops that compliment the scent. The taste is good. It is smooth with a malty taste. Again, the yeast and crystal malts add a sweet and fruity taste. The mouthfeel is good. It is a low/medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation; an excellent drinking ale."
"It pours a clear chestnut amber color with a foamy tan head into my 16 oz Brooklyn Brewery pint glass. Head dissapears quickly, leaving minimal lacing. Sweet caramal maltiness with a biscuity flavor. Minimal hop bitterness. Dry finish. The famous Maris Otter Pale malt is used for this English style pale ale. Medium-body and a great session ale."
"This beer poured into the glass a crystal clear amber color that when held to the light it had an orange hue on the edges. The head that was created was an off white/light tan color. The consistency was thick, creamy, and very full, it lasted a decent amount of time after the pour. Lightly carbonated. There was some lace left behind. The aromas that came from the glass were of fresh grass, flowers, with wisps of fruit (citrus) and caramels. The tastes were crisp, clean and smooth on the pallet. Flavors of sweet malts and fresh grass and floral hops seemed to balance each other all through the sip. Some citrus and biscuit flavors were also noticeable. The finish is on the dry side, but had a sweet feel to it as well. The body is light to medium. Decent beer, refreshing and well balanced in the nose and in the mouth."
"Would love to sample a Brooklyn brewed draft someday."
"I like this beer. A lot."
"What a great ale... Garrett Oliver never disappoints!"
"This ale poured a clear (hint of haze), chestnut (red-brown) color with light tan foam that settled relatively quickly. The smell was sweetly malty with a hint of caramel and some floral notes. The taste was malty with floral hop flavors, but not much hop bitterness. The flavor was rather subdued. The mouthfeel was smooth and very dry. The body was medium with a lingering tangy and mildly floral aftertaste. This ale was easy to drink. This bottle had been in my refridgerator a long time (best by Nov '02), but the only effect on the flavor seems to have been a mellowing of the hop bitterness; otherwise, it tasted fine."
"This is Brooklyns great session beer, not the lager. Reddish-amber body with seemingly restrained carbonation topped by a crown of creamy white mousse. Once sip reveals that they were shooting for a British-style pale which they nailed with ease. This oozes Maris Otter with a little floral hopping to balance. Long caramel, toast, 'n tea finish. The bitterness and carbonation are clean, creamy, and cleansing prepping the mouth for another nutty sip. Not a showy West-Coast-PA, but a refined traditional example."
"Pours a great amber hue, thick tan head, retains well, great lacing. Tasty malty body up front, smooth, pleasant sourness going on throughout this journey. Fuggle hops can be detected, bitter palate, malty throughout, borderline chewy on the malt side. Leans heavy towards the English side, the balance is near perfection via the hops, malts, and bitterness. Outstanding."
"Overall, a decent pale ale, but the flavor is a little odd and just doesn't do it for me."
"Tastes first of sweet caramel malt, with a slight hint at fruit in the middle, then a bitter hop finish that gives good balance. Very crisp and clean with a medium body and a slight bite. Very drinkable. Another great Brooklyn beer."
"A deep orange color with a creamy, thick foam. Hops lead the aroma profile, earthy and floral. Malt profile starts with butterscotch, very ESB-like. The body is refreshingly light with a lingering grainy malt in the dry finish. The malt is balanced with an earthy hop flavor, overall an ok pint but no outstanding feature."
"Thanks Stegmakk for the sample..."
"The name may have changed from Pennant Pale Ale to just plain Brooklyn Ale but the product remains the same. Bottle was freshness dated and the product poured a dark copper color with a creamy head. No overpowering aroma. Nice blend of malt and hops with the hop presence being less pronounced than in many Pale Ales. No unpleasant aftertaste. To me, it's a nice solid Pale Ale with no unusual atttributes - very drinkable throughout an evening or if you're having only one."
"What an enjoyable beer. Golden amber color with a light beige, foamy head that sticks around and laces the glass. The aroma is of malt and bitter hops, with some citrus thrown in for good measure. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, and just feels really good overall. The flavor is round and smooth, and well balanced. A bit yeasty, very pleasing malt, a bit tannic, and hop bitterness that tingles the throat. Also some citrus, pine, and a bit of fruit. Very drinkable. Especially if you're fortunate to have it very fresh at the brewery."
"This beer pours a very choppy head. It settles to a thin layer that lasts throughout the length of the beer. The beer is a light reddish amber. Aroma is primarily of oak. Tastes creamy and thick. This is a very good brew. It's complex and very drinkable."
"Poured a beautiful coppery chestnut, but failed to live up to the promise of the appearance. Sour-ish aroma hinting of grape. Not quite there with the mouthfeel - a little thin. Malt is not nearly hefty enough, and comes across as timid, rather sour and astringent. Hopping is mild and nondescript. Not up to par with the other brews I've been fortunate to sample from Brooklyn."
"Again bought a sampler without checking the best by date, so it was supposed be drank before June 2002. Appearance is a medium amber brown with a cream toned decent sized foam head. Minimal lacing going on but an overall decent appearance. Aroma well, even after being well past the best by date this beer stilll retains many adimrable qualities. A nice smooth floral hop aroma balanced by a nutty caramel malt tones. You can tell this beer is overly ripe, but I think the hops preserved enough to make it a pleasant session brew. The flavor has a sweet forefront of malt followed by a trickling of mild bittering hops with a nutty finish to it. Lighter in body with little or no complexities to make this beer that interesting to me. Drinkability as of now this is a mediocre session beer that I still will drink only to try it fresher."
"As the beer sets in my glass, a deep burnished copper color, the head mountainous in size, the color a winsome light tan and the consistency creamy. Nose is malt, sweet, crisp and fresh, the start is richly malt, the top middling in feel to the palate. Finish has a spiteful acidity, the hops present and spicy in their bite, a dry aftertaste, and another good beer from a great brewery."
"The Brooklyn Ale poured a dark amber color, with a small but consistent head. No apparent lacing, and the beer had a somewhat flat appearance. The smell was impressive, with subtle fruity elements mixed with a strong malty odor. The hops become a little more noticeable in the taste, but the maltiness remains dominant. A bread-like taste was also present, maybe a bit too much for my liking. The medium body was appropriate, but I would have liked a bit more fizz on the tongue. Maybe a little flat, but not terribly so. Overall, this Brooklyn product was a pretty good ale, and it went surprisingly well with my fish dinner!"
"Bottom Line: For those of you who think that this is very English in style ought to try Fuller’s London Pride."
"One of the better pale ales I have had,poured a real nice copper color with medium well retained head.Very hoppy aroma but great malty balance to this brew,hop was present but not overpowering.I like a good balanced pale ale alot more than one with too much bitterness,if I want that I will order a IPA.This brewery makes some real nice beers at least all the ones I have had."
"Mucho gracias, Unclejimbo!"
"F."
"This is one excellent beer. Very rich and smooth with a mass of malts. It is very similar to Sam Adams Boston Ale. Very robust and full of flavor with a medium full body. Carbonation is light. There is a mild hop presence that adds a little complexity to the brew. A wonderful drinking beer, I had to fight over these tasty treats as the card games rolled on. A friend of mine, a die hard lager man just wanted more and more. A fine job done on this beer."
"Had a decent head and nice lacing. The nose was a malty caramel and som fruit notes. The taste is malty and somewhat sweet with nice smooth and rich mouthfeel. The hops are there and not a large part of the overall taste but do a nice job with balancing the beer and giving small citrus twang. Overall a good beer and would really like to try on tap in brooklyn."
"According to other reviews, this Brooklyn Ale is the same thing as Pennant Pale Ale, they just changed the name. So here I go... Orangish brew with a very nice white head on top. Nice and thick. Stays pretty well for a while, but loses its edge about halfway through. English hop aroma for the most part, maltiness is bready. A bit of sourness is in there too. On the palate, hoppiness dances on the tongue creating a tingle, while malt stays at the edges. For the maltiness, think sourdough bread with a little sugar added. English with an American touch. Smooth, medium bodied, nice mouthfeel overall. Clean, crisp finish. Pretty good pale ale, nice take on the style. Thanks to francisweizen for this one!"
"This was a little darker than most Pale Ales witha very deep copper/chestnut color. The head receded immediatly into some bubbles that lined the side of the glass. The smell lacked the hop that usually accompanies pales. There were aromas of yeast and pears with a definite emphasis on malt characteristics. The taste was sweet with subtle notes of wheat bread, pear and apple upfront. I ddi not experience a very strong hop finish until the last third of the beer. The mouthfeel was, howver, very mellow without too much carbonation. Definitely thick and malted without a real crispness of some pales. This beer is not what I am used to in a pale ale, but I will definitely buy this again."
"Overall, an easily drinkable ale base, and when you can get it fresh (which can be a problem because it is so widely shipped, and thus widely sits around and waits) it gives off a potpourri blend of nose and tongue. For myself, a great day-to-day ale but with more character (mainly in the nose) and complexity (mainly on the taongue) than a typical day-to-day ale. I grab it when I want a cheaper six pack that won't drink like a cheaper six-pack."
"a good session beer, though would be better with slightly more carbonation."
"A golden copper color with beige head and both moderate head retention and lacing. Problems begin in the nose. Immediately, a heavy alcoholic element, similar to scotch, seeming inappropriate to the style and just plain unappealing to me. Also in the nose, caramel malt and citrus. On palate, the promise of the nose is delivered with, again, that alcohol off-note that is just too direct and out of place. Additionally, a heavy sweetness with roasty, caramel malt notes. There is a slight dryness in the finish but nowhere near balancing the heavy sweetness. And despite this potent combination of heavy alchohol and sweet elements, the mouthfeel is rather thin. The finish is somewhat cloying and just sort of drops off haphazardly. Boy this is coming off negative. I'm just not a fan of this beer, though its still Brooklyn, its still craft-brewed and its still better than lots of beers out there."
"Despite the hops snap, it's a thin beer, to me. And there is an aftertaste that I cannot define. It comes after that ginger. I don't like it, but I am hard-pressed to describe it. It's fruity, but I can't get much closer than that."
"-Oelergud"
"The bottle indicates that the color of this beer is ""chestnut""; I would call it amber. Head retention is medium-low, but the beer does leave behind some nice rings of lace. The nose is fruity (suggesting grape) and yeasty, with some additional, more aggressive spicy notes that I've had trouble identifying even after multiple samples. On the palate a rich malt flavor stands out, with slight citrusy undertones. The finish displays contrasting elements of sweet and sour which are unbalanced and could be brought together more effectively. This is a decent beer, but also somewhat odd. It's too sweet for my tastes, and lacks the appropriate bitterness that I expect in a Pale Ale."
"Clear, deeply tawny / reddish mahogany in color. The ivory colored head is a creamy, holds well, and leaves some minimal lace. The aroma offers a lightly fruity, caramel maltiness with some earthy & spicy hops. Very nice. The body is medium with a fine and restrained carbonation; giving a smooth and lightly creamy mouthfeel. The flavor is somewhat fruity with a distinctive caramel maltiness that's gently supported by hop bitterness. The maltiness has a certain richness to it, but I question how much of that comes from using Maris Otter and how much comes from mash temperature and dextrinous crystal malts. Some grassy, earthy, and lightly spicy hop flavors appear in the finish. An excellent English-style pale that would make a good session ale with a slightly lower alcohol content. I'd love to try this out of the brewery in Brooklyn - and a cask would surely be stellar - however, the bottled version offers some of the F.X. Matt house character that is sometimes described as ""soapy"". Still, I was pleasantly surprised by this offering."
"If Brooklyn can get some buttery diacetyl notes into the fermentation (like I've come to savor from the English varieties) this would be a killer brew."
"Pours a rich, bright copper mixed with red highlights. The head was small, creamy/sticky and off-white in color. On the nose there is a nice fruity armoa, malty, light but complex hop aroma also. On the palate it starts with sweet malt flavor, fruity, little biscuity, slight citrus from the hops, crisp. Smooth mouth feel. Emmm This pale ale is very enjoyableoverall a very good english styled pale."
"Full flavor and very drinkable.  Just great.  Drink them over and over, you will dig it.  Cheers!"
"Medium amber color with a nice white head that dwindled to a sticky lace. Hoppy, slightly citrusy smell. Malty at first, followed by a pleasing hop influx that keeps things honest. A terrific beer."
"This brew is on the darker side of the spectrum for pale ales.  It is a deep copper.  Decent head.  The aroma is nice.  It showcases a nice herbal hop aroma with some sweet caramel and toffee as well.  Taste is nice as well.  It definitely has the English slant to it, but I like it.  Normally I prefer the American version, but this is one of the better English-style pale ales I've had.  Very solid malt backbone and enough hopping to give a nice bitterness.  Very easy drinking.  A bit of a dry finish, which is nice.  Very nice."
"Nice copper color with a head that is quick to leave.  The smell is of earthy hops and some slight malt.  Interesting taste.  Malt, hops, malt on the tongue.  The malt is not too sweet and slightly caramel with the hops being mild in the english style.  Almost tastes like a hoppy and lighter bodied brown ale.  The mouthfeel is smooth and the beer is very drinkable.  A nice brew.  Slightly different than some of the other EPAs but very nice regardless."
"96"
"My first exposure to the Brooklyn Brewery, and it was a pleasant one. This brew is a beautiful dark copper color, and it has the taste to match, with an absolutely perfect balance of malt and hops. Very fresh in the metro area, and as another said, pleasantly inexpensive. Highly recommended."
"This beer measures up quite well against it's English counterparts. Classic malt flavor with Fuggles and EK Goldings to round out the brew. And it's one of the Wed. specials at the local, Imperial pints, $2.25 and pitchers, $5.00. Giddyup!"
"very nice brew from a great brewery.  more mild than their IPA due to a lesser hop character and with the malt flavor more pronounced.  as the name suggests, good beer for watching baseball."
"Notes: A classic example of (an American made) English Pale Ale. Very true to the style. Brooklyn's tribute to the world champion Brooklyn baseball team."
