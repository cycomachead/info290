"Overall, a great session beer and a nice change of pace. I've had a lot of hop and malt monsters lately so I enjoyed something that was more easy going but still tasty and definitely balanced."
""
""
""
""
"O: A decent session beer worth drinking. Not amazing by any means but if you like the one and only then its a good beer to get into. I wasn't begging for another but I will definitely finish off the case I bought."
"o: sub 5% puts this in the sessionable category. easy drinking with lots of flavor. not what i expected from a this but interesting nonetheless."

"O- It comes as advertised, so my review really is subjective. I like to 'feel' the hops, that's lacking here."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a copper color with a very small white head that leaves some lacing. The aroma is of caramel and hops. Tasted pretty much like the smell suggests with toasted malt as well. Overall, surprised that it was pretty good as I do like their ""Brown Ale"" also and fairly smooth to drink."
"O: It's alright, I guess. Come to think of it, this lived up to my expectations perfectly - by being completely average in almost all aspects. Among macros, I've had FAR worse."
""

"O - Good thing it was free, I'd leave this alone."

"Overall – Rather crisp and refreshing. Quite easy to drink but nothing too exceptional."
""
"Overall: this beer just rubs me the right way. It's light but balanced, sweet but not cloying, and really quite satisfying. I would be glad to quaff gobs of it."
"O: May be a bit easier on the American drinker than the Brown offering. I read that the original Newcastle Brown was considered a failure by the formulator because he he'd been attempting to recreate Bass Pale Ale. This is much closer to Bass but I'd say a smidge mellower."
""
"If you want simple, fairly clean, light on the flavors, easy to drink, and personally it is not that bad tasting."
""
"O - While not the worst, this is decently sessionable with some moderate flavors that make for a good hoppy lager, but its far off from a pale ale."
"At 4.8% and no real flavor you could go to town on these and not be offended."
"Newcastle is not where to turn for an authentic and delicious session pale. Look elsewhere. This one misses the mark."
""
""
""
""
"O: Very easy to drink and definitely one that could be a session beer - reminds me of afternoons in pubs when visiting London. Not one I would go out of my way to find again but certainly one I would enjoy if I came across it in a bar again."
""
""
""
"Overall: Not great, but decent. A good addition to their excellent and world famous brown ale."
""
""
""
"An average example of the style, muted hop profile, alright drinkability. Got better as it warmed past cellar temp, but not enough to redeem it"
""
""
""
"This ale is not exciting. OK / average. No real subtlety or hop flavor, no big flavor arc as with a real pale ale like Oskar Blues Dales Pale Ale. Would drink only if everything else was bud."
""
""
""
"Overall, this beer is not bad, its just nothing exciting. It is a bit unbalanced for the style, with too much sweetness and not enough hops to counteract the malts. I will be able to finish the six pack, but won't seek this one out in the future."
""
"I thought this had a malt bias throughout: something I like. The nose had a mild caramel hint within the aroma and that followed along within the mouth flavours. Hops are around giving the beer a balanced feel but this is a semi-sweet brew which fits my taste profile very nicely."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall, It was a slightly glorified AAL. I'd have again at a party but that's about it."
"Overall, this beer seemed odd to me. I think it's the cider smell and taste that is throwing me off. 5 more bottles to go - we'll see how it ""drinks"" out."
"Definately a good Pale Ale."
"Meh - dull and unimaginitive. Average flavour and aroma, with some off-notes lurking behind the scenes. Doesn't do anything for me; just another lacklustre also-ran. Give it a miss and buy something decent instead."
""
"O: drinkable but not really noteworthy, nice toast flavor"
""
"It pours a dark orange color with a lofty off white head that left some nice lacing on the glass. Not much on the nose, it's kind of macro tasting with scents of metal, sweet malt and grain. It tastes like it smells but with a little more to it, I detected some grass, bread and more metal. It has a light body with very little carbonation. I probably won't drink this again, I don't really know where they were going with this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- No thanks. If you are looking for a beer with a light body/flavor profile that is not too filling and you are sick with bmc, then you may be pleased with this one. About as average as can be. Probably won't have again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear, copper color. 1/2 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and good lacing. Smells of sweet malt, caramel malt, hops, hint of pale malt, and a hint of adjunct. Fits the style of an English Pale Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, pale malt, hint of caramel malt, hint of wheat, and adjunct metallic flavors. Overall, decent appearance and blend, but aroma and body were both hurt by the adjunct presence."
""
""
""
"It is very quaffable and lively if a little boring. This ale is clean and sessionable but hardly memorable."
""
"A real bleedin corcker!!!"
""
""
"Well done."
""
"Poured this traditional English Pale Ale from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. It poured a clear copper color, produced a think white head, poor retention and left a nice amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma consisted of toasted malt, caramel and herbal hops. Medium bodied, a foundation of toasted malt, caramel and some slight hop bitterness. It starts off with a decent dose of malted grain but fades quickly and has some what of a watery character. Much to thin for my liking-"
""
"Decent beer. Nothing to great, nothing too bad."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This was fruit and odd without enough balance and a bit too much sweetness."
""
""
""
"I've always thought that their standard brown ale was sort of thin and flavorless, and this doesn't really change my opinion of the brewery. Like their ubiquitous brown brew, this is far from bad, it's just sort of plain. This also has a slightly sour finish and buttery/fruity combo that I didn't really care for."
""
"3.28/5.00"
""
""
""
"Overall: the body of the beer is medium and the finish is medium as well. I was let down by this beer, the beer taste skunky. I really do not know why, or how come. The aroma is so much better than the taste. It is just an okay beer."
""
""
"Another pretty basic and fairly standard pale ale here, it wasn't particularly enjoyable and the smell was almost undistinguishable but nothing in the beer was offensive or harsh, just a little plain."
""
"This wasn't a very good beer. I can't recommend this one for any occasion or pairing."
"Taste is bread dough, metal hint, peppery-leafy bitterness dominating finish gently, with faint hint of caramelised grain. It is fairly simple but well-rounded, solid, balanced, and enjoyable."

"My pour produced a finger of dense tawny head with good retention. Color was a deep coppery-amber with NE-quality clarity. Nose was soft, slightly hoppy but with a good deal of biscuit malt up front. Mouthfeel was likewise rather soft with flavors of grass, crackers and even a metallic tang on the tongue. Finish was dry, no question, but I felt like something was missing. I had this on draft at one point and really enjoyed it, but this presentation seemed somehow lacking. Just not enough Ooomph, I guess."
"Amber in color with a short lived white head. Like a lot of these seasonal Newcastle releases, really quite buttery. A bit of melon in there, too. Bread and toast with a touch of toffee. Toffee and toasted malt flavors to this one which aren’t bad, but still a hint of butter. Slight melon notes and a light floral hop character."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This was nicely balanced, if not particularly unique. I'd have another."
"O - ""A Blighty Good Brew""."
""
""
"Tastes like a lighter, slightly hoppier Newcastle Brown. Refreshing but average beer that if you’re a NC Brown fan you’ll like this but I found it boring."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drink- Just average. Lacking carbonation and flavor."

"Founders is an alright ale. I'm not the biggest fan of ales, but I am a big fan of Newcastle so I had to try. First and formost the best thing I enjoyed about this was the mouth feel. It's very malty like in the mouth. Worst thing I hated is the after taste. Too bitter for me. The overall finish is okay. In my opinion this beer taste quite a bit like Fat Tire. The caramel biscut taste is all up there front and center. It's worth trying, but I'm not a big fan of ales. Give it a try!"
""
""
"O: A little tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, it’s a solid beer but there are others that are better in the style."
"The aftertaste on the medium bodied beer is a very light dry with just a hint of the malt remaining."
""
"In one word Lacklustre."
"Taste, fits the bill, sweet instead of bitter, mild instead of robust. Much more on point when calling oneself a British Pale Ale. Mild body, good amount of mild sweetness, not diabetic coma inducing, but definitely leans sweet over bitter. Only $3.99 a 6 at Total Wine, a good buy, especially since they are easily pawned off on girlfriends and other family members who don't like big bitter and hoppy beers."
""
"Pours bright copper with excellent clarity, nice foamy ivory colored head that holds some decent retention and leaves little lacing on the glass. Aromas are earthy, musty, and metallic, some toasted grain, and herbal hop. Tastes are earthy as well, with notes of toasted grain, herbal hops, grassy, nutty, rather bland with a metallic finish. As is warms, the sweetness they speak of comes out a little more in the way of caramel, albeit faint. Body is thin and watery, ample carbonation, goes down crisp and clean. Overall, I'm usually not a fan of herbal hops, so add that to the metallic finish and the muted flavor, this was not a hit for me. It wasn't awful, but wasn't good either. I'll still drink the 6 pack over time."
"12 oz from a six pack from Safeway, West Salem. $7.99 Pleasant looking ale..dark amber,clear, with a nice looking thick ,creamy off white head Fine caramel malt aromas,some herbal hop also Smooth clean caramel malt taste, slightly nutty and a touch of pepper in the end. Thinnish mouth feel but makes it even more drinkable. Reasonable bitter/English pale ale"
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a caramel color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some malts detected. Taste is also a bit weak, some malts, a bit of hop bitterness, a touch bready. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is an easy drinking but unspectacular beer."
"Atmosphere is really solid. Deep golden hue, carbonation, a dense frothy head, and some nice spider web lacing. Nose is simple but full combination of sour grain and tea. Flavor is sour bread with an acetyl characteristic. Overall, this is a good quaff."
"overall a nice , simple session ale. that's about it. for the price it seems a bit of a let down, but i suppose you could drink worse. i'm sure i won't be seeking this out again."
""
""
""

""
""
"O: Nothing special about this ale. It looks good, but that's about it."
"o - Nice balanced beer, let it get a bit warmer for it to open up."
"Like I mentioned in the taste profile, it just feels like a beer that is missing a major flavor. There are decent hints here and there but it is somewhere between macro and decent pale ale. Does improve with warmth somewhat but there is still some fruity/raisin flavor that is a astringent."
""
""
"One of Newcastle's better offerings. Good balance, not over sweet. I had this with lunch and it was great with food. Worth a shot."
""
""
""
"O: this is nothing special. I was hoping for a really great Spring brew, but am slightly disappointed. I'd only have this on tap depending upon what else was served."
"Overall - A good offering from Newcastle. The flavors are somewhat tame, but there's a nice all-around balance. Certainly drinkable, and not a bad option for session drinking."
""
""
"An okay ale. Seems mass produced and lacking passion. Gives some slight promising character, but doesn't deliver a real firm punch. Could have been a whole lot more, but it's clear these guys are catering to the mass market. Decent, but not anything spectacular."
""
"O: There’s nothing overly special about the taste but this beer goes down like a breeze and is quite quaffable."
""
""
"O: An easy drinking English pale ale; nothing incredibly crazy here--just a drinkable, simple brew but I like it nonetheless"
""
"O: An easy-to-drink pale ale that is a great value ($8 or $9 for a sixer). A great way to introduce your friends to the joys of pale ales. It has the sharp edge you expect, but not as hard as the Ranger or Sam Adams' Latitude 48."
""
""
""
"Overall - 3.5/5 - not a bad brew, but kind of ho hum overall. I could care less whether I drank it again or not"
""
""
""
"This beer borders on the european lager taste profile even though it is an ale. It does have a slight hop presence. Not much going on in the ways of the malt."
"Overall: Not as good as Newcastle, which in my opinion is already pretty mediocre/average. I can definitely drink a pack of these without complaining, and if someone had a keg of it somewhere I would be pretty psyched compared to a keg of Bud Light. But all in all, there are definite better brews to spend your 8.99-or-so on. C rated, average."
"Notes: Well it's not too bad and it's drinkable very good for a warm day. Cheers."
""

"This was an average beer. From what I understand – Some of the Newcastle offerings are actually brewed by one of the Heineken breweries. I believe some of the seasonals may still brewed by Caledonian. Overall I would probably consider keeping this one on hand as a sessionable ale when having macro-lovers over to the house."
"O: A solid quaffer, nothing more. Worth a single pickup for fans of this style."
"Two 12oz bottles dumped into an Imperial pint. Clear copper, thin head of white forms over the mild carbonation. Barley husk, bread crust, some minty hop flavor at the end, a touch of fruit on the nose rounds it out. Decent for a midday quaff, but it's not impressive enough to go back to the store for a six pack."
"A very big fan of Newcastle, was happy to see this in the store recently and picked up a 6 pack. With the Winter IPA and Werewolf, looks like Newcastle is branching out. This is hardly an impressive looking beer -- pours a dark copper with a very slight bubbly head. Leaves a fair amount of lacing along the glass as you drink it. The smell is pretty underwhelming as well -- sweet & slightly malty with a hint of raisin/prune. But very plain. Therefore, before I took my first sip, I didn't have high hopes. However, this might be one of the smoothest, easiest to drink beers I've had in quite some time. It has just the right amount of sweetness to it, but is very easy to drink. Would be an excellent session beer. It's malty & slightly grainy -- doesn't pack the best punch -- but it is solid and just exceptionally easy to drink and like. Thumbs up."
""
"O: Not that impressed. A good springtime beer. Would definitely stick with the Brown Ale. Newcastle needs to ""Found"" a better taste."
"Overall I'd imagine this is better on draft and on a warm day. Wouldnt turn this down in the future, not a bad beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from bottle to pint glass the beer is a translucent amber color with a nice 2 finger white head, good retention, and lacing. Looks great. The nose is extremely sweet, overly so, with a strong caramel tone. A hint of earthy hops? Sweetness is too much and districts. The flavor starts with a nice light bready malt flavor from which the caramel builds. Again the sweetness appears and begins to overwhelm the flavor. Mildly bitter with a hint of earthy hops but the sweetness is too much. Lighter bodied and crisp with a lingering sugar flavor. Overall, too sweet for me, not balanced at all. Glad to have tried this as I had not heard of it but I won't be back."
""
"Decent head and lacing, bronze color beer, lots of carbonation. A sweet malty, corn smell. Taste is smooth, sweet, uncomplicated. A little bready flavor on the back end and a touch of sourness like the kind you'd find with Jack Daniels - again, reminding me of corn. Could probably have several because it goes down easily, but there are better session beers out there."
""
""
"Taste is mild, with malts in the classic English pale ale tradition, but more balanced than others I've had of late. I get a gentle hint of citrus hops in the mix, which makes for a solid and enjoyable brew. Solid enough of a sessioner."
""
""
""
""
"Not bad. More drinkable than their flagship, which speaks volumes."
""
"I can't get too fired-up on this pale ale. Drinkable but not memorable. Would I drink it again? Sure. Would this be one of the first beers I'd go for if given a choice. Nope."
""
""
"Pours a clear, dark amber with not much head - but the latter may be an artifact of the pour. Malty aroma has a fruity undertone and is not strong, but still invites a taste. Flavor - whoa, now that is good flavor. Malty core, apple plus more than a hint of pear, hint of horehound. Smooth and somewhat fizzy texture has more than average body. If this is not outstanding, it is still worthy of a try."
"Overall (3.0): This is a pretty standard-tasting English Pale, in my mind. Not bad, not spectacular, and more or less what you could expect if you blindly chose a Pale in a random English pub. It’s decent. It LOOKS fantastic, though beyond that it’s pretty typical for an English Pale. It’d probably be a decent cask-conditioning candidate, and could easily see this on gravity at a better English pub."
""
"Overall - not a bad brew, but not very intriguing."
""
""
""
""
"I'm not trying to knock this beer but there are many more that I'd turn to first, even in my market."
""
"Taste-Mineral fruitiness, sedate English hops, nice little hop bite in the finish. Pleasant and easygoing, nicely balanced, sessionable ale."
""
"Overall: Light bodied with an OK blance. Not a bad brew by any means. Just not going to go buy a six pack of it. Worth a try for sure. Cheers."
"Pours a clean orange-ish color with an off white head. In the aroma, a mellow gingerbread maltiness. In the taste, not much but a standard gingerbread like maltiness. A small bite and a medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry gingerbread like maltiness. Kind of a standard English ale, not bad, but nothing exciting."
""
""
""
""
"I can't really say too much about this English pale ale but go and get some!! Just clean tasty Pale Ale with a wonderful balance. Ya know, sometimes I get bored of over the top beers. If you just want a great Ale to sip on or even pound down. This is it!! The drink-ability is perfect!!"
"Pours a clear copper with an off white creamy head that fades quickly. A distinctly dried apricot bouquet that acts as a spoiler for what will, ultimately, stimulate the palate. Lovely tangerine and dried apricot that drops abruptly to expose a mild tartness at the beer's finish. Extremely drinkable beer."
""
"This is what it is...an easy to drink British style pale ale. Considering it's price, if I wanted a real easy drinker on the cheap, I would pick this up again."
""
"Overall for the style, yeah this is different good for them for trying something new. But I am not drawn to this at all."
""
""
"The body is light, as expected, though the crispness comes from a carbonation that fades off toward the middle. It's pretty dry until that point, at which it becomes even drier and pushes out an astringent element, though it's not extreme."
"A very sessionable beer. Not a whole lot of complexity, but it's an English pale ale."
""
""
""
""
""
"An OK pale ale."
""
""
""
"Pours a clear copper color with a 1/2 inch foamy tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt/grain, butter, and some vegetal aromas. Taste is of malt/grain and some off buttery and vegetal flavors. There is a weird herbal bitterness that lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly flat mouthfeel. Overall, this is just not a very good beer all around. Some of the other Newcastle seasonal beers have been tolerable but this one is definitely at the bottom of the pack."
"Will make for an upscale round of beer pong."
"An average, middle of the road, unoffensive example of the style. Rather weak, but at least it isn't overly suffused with corn, sugar, and other adjuncts in the flavor profile."
"O: Not the most enjoyable beer. I’m no expert on the style, and I’ve never consumed an English beer from the source where I’m sure they are a lot better, but let’s just say I’m glad I got a single bottle instead of the six or twelve pack."
"Overall - Not really worth it. Much better Pale Ales out there, and Newcastle's One and Only Brown is one of my favorites if I had to rank them. Some companies excel in their main brew, some extend that to their expansions. This would be an example of one that just, pure and simple, failed."
""
""
"Overall, this is a fairly average beer, that fails to distinguish itself. Not a bad beer, but not a good beer either. To be honest, if I had not reviewed it, I would have forgotten that I even tried."
""
"Pours to a generous but coarse head with lots of large ""fish eye"" bubbles and generous sticky lace with a golden amber/brown color. Aroma is sweet malt and pastries with a floral and fruity aroma possibly attributed to esters and hops. Flavor is a complex blend of sweet malt, biscuits (in the British sense) and spicy hop flavor and resiny hop bittnerness to balance it out. This tastes fresher than what usually comes across the pond. Mouthfeel is light and the CO2 is refreshingly restrained. This would be an entirely different experience on the palate if it had been pumped up to an American CO2 level. Overall, this is tasty, complex and well composed EPA."
"Drinkability is awesome on this beer. Very good tastes going on, but a very nice balance. I could, and have drank these beers all day long. Great beer for the spring time. I nice new offering from Newcastle."
""
"Medium amber and clear with a thin fine head on top, the aroma has husky grains and fruit, with a hint of toffee. A taste reveals a full, fruity english yeast profile, with a smooth caramel backbone. Throughout is a mild bitterness that surrounds it all. this is a medium bodied, clean and crisp english pale ale. Very well done and drinkable, though not bold really, it's an easy-drinking and tasty beer."
""
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a tulip at cellar temperature. A fairly small, white head forms on the pour, maintaining a foamy cap all the way down. Carbonation appears light, as is appropriate for the style and, unfortunately, increasingly uncommon in bottled pale ales. The beer is a very clear dark orange. The nose is of hay, light toffee and pear skin. The flavor reveals a nutty toffee/caramel, balanced by a light bitterness, with some English hop character. The finish is a tad sour. The mouthfeel is light. Overall, really a very decent English pale ale. Nicely balanced, tending toward the malty side."
"overall a very passable beer, by the people who brought you newcastle brown ale. The lighter body and sweeter flavor may make this a replacement for my usual mass consumption brew, sierra nevada pale ale. Maybe."
""
"O - This is a nice pale ale. I enjoyed this new Newcastle."
"RJT"
""
"Pretty average brew! When it comes to pale ale's its appearance was the color I expected but the lace was not there. The smell was very light I smelled more yeast smells than hops. The taste is fine it is a good beer, the mouthfeel is light and overall I would not buy it in a 6 pack but that is my opinion."
""
""
""
"Poured into a nonic a nice clear copper with a thinner white head atop,like many UK pale ales it has a nice richness and definition in color.Muted aromas with mainly caramel/biscuit malt coming into play,as it warms a faint leafy hop presence is felt.Thin to near watery in the mouth with subtle flavors,caramel/biscuit malt with again light leafy hops,a light sourness lingers in the finish wich I don'l like so much.Eh it's average and to be honest boring,today Iam drinking alot of ""session"" style ales and I would pick many of them over this."
"Overall this beer seems like it is halfway to being pretty good. The initial flavors just drop off too rapidly and everything becomes muddled after that. A nice try, though."
"This is a rather lackluster ale. The flavor profile is so mild as to be almost nonexistent. In my opinion it's rather boring."
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle marked 31-12-W-L357-59-01. Sampled on February 7, 2012. It pours a medium amber tone with excellent clarity and a decent, foamy lingering head that leaves lacing in its wake. The aroma is not very astonishing. It smells like an English Pale Ale with its subtle sweet malts and a cool, clean hop note. The body is about medium but it also has a nice creamy texture. The taste is about as subtle with malts, bread notes, and an above average hop bite with a crisp ending."
"Overall: well crafted, just enough to be a regular back to back at the bar. Unfortunately this is a limited release and get it while you can. Salud!"
"Overall, I'd have to pass, and I guess that's been the consensus. There are just too many better English ales out there."
"O: Not a bad beer, but certainly not a good pale ale. I doubt the Brits were thinking of competing with Sierra Nevada for an inexpensive but damn good pale ale. But if they had, they failed."
"Overall - A nice pale ale that is easy to drink, provides pleanty of flavor and well balanced. Another good beer from the UK."
"Overall: While not a beer to be celebrated, it is okay, it is drinkable, and a far sight better than some of their other seasonal offerings."
"This is by no means a stellar beer, but it is a timid approach to how I imagine early English Mild Ales might have tasted. Certainly not offensive, but a very light ale all arround."
"Eh....didn't think I'd say it, but the original Newcastle probably has a better flavor profile."
"I'm a rookie to their seasonal lineup except fro the summer which wasn't too bad. This was a super fresh English pale less than 5% abv sure no problem. Pours a copper amber hue with a bright slightly off whtie head forms thick and dwindles slow leaves behind speckled lacing. Aroma earthy citrus hops intertwined with fruit malts and hints of caramel a really good finesse beer. It's not in your face but each sniff and sip draws you in further. Basically compare full blown hardcore porn (American pale ale) to a burlesque show where you may get a peek at some leg with a garter on. One leaves much more to the imagination and makes your senses work harder to acheive the same result. Flavor wise caramel malt with a slight tart sourdough bread note and a quick fleeting hop note earthy/citrus thus far. ""A blighty good brew", okay it's good... not world class pale nice earthy tones arise within the caramel/citrus combo finishing balanced with more hops arising the more you take a deep inhalation. The nose has a really nice hop character and it brings out more of the hoppiness with each sniff. Mouthfeel as a whole medium bodied even carbonation, pretty effortless to drink and consume at least a few bottles in a session. Like I said it's not instant beergasm but eventually it gets you to the point of beervana, but it's an experience to sip and session with."
""
"I haven't had the greatest luck with these new Newcastle seasonals, but this one is uber-fresh and intriguing, and that's enough for me to give it a go. It pours a clear copper-bronze topped by a finger of relatively short-lived off-white foam. The nose comprises soft biscuit, very light pine needles, greens, a whisper of toasted caramel, and a strong whiff of that apparently famous sulfurous British hard water. The taste holds notes of lightly spicy greens, light mint, toasted biscuits, light pine, and, towards the finish, a gentle wave of sweet maple syrup, which tapers off just before everything else, leaving a mildly bitter aftertaste behind. I kinda like this layering of flavors, something I really don't get from Newcastle at all. The body is a light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a decently dry finish. Overall, a nice EPA, something I really wouldn't mind revisiting in the near future."
"Overall a tasty English Pale Ale. Not outstanding here but I could drink another."
"O: Very good beer, good balance of sweet and malt bitterness, this must be a relatively new beer but its a nice EPA."
"Overall / Drinkability: Interesting beer. Went well with food (meatballs, rice, green beans) and went fast by itself. I think this beer would be better on draft/cask, and again wondering about its age, for a beer from the 2011 brewing of this beer it's pretty good for this age. But with the cryptic nature of the date stamp no way to know for sure. So overall, not a ""wow"" beer, but definitely above average and worth a try."
