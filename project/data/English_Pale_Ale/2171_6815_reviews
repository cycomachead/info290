"A pretty awesome beer. Well done Four Peaks. Balance and clean flavor are the hallmarks of this brew. Wonderful hop character. Good body. Smooth, flavorful, and satisfying. Definitely worth trying if you go to either of their pubs or see it in a store."

"Pours a clear caramel with a slight off white head. Aroma is bready, with a touch on the doughy side of things, a little herbal, a touch floral, and slight fruity essence. Flavor pretty much followed suit, but with a bit of it thinning out in the finish. A crisp, active thinner medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, I really enjoyed this session ale a lot. Nothing crazy or standout-ish, just a solid sessionable EPA that I could drink over and over. If it made it out Colorado, I am sure it would be a regular in my fridge come summertime."

"I bought a full six-pack of this and thankfully, I won't have any trouble getting rid of this before I have to head back east on Thursday morning. Session beers don't get any more obvious than this and as hard as this was to like, it was as hard to dislike. Fits the style well and I almost thought this was a Vienna Lager because of the maltiness that was present thorughout from start to finish. Not a bad start for anyone like me who hasn't had a beer from the Grand Canyon State in ages."

"Overall, its an easy drinking ale, nice toast and malt notes - would to stop by the brewery again for it on tap."
""
"O: This is the third time I tried this beer. Note to self: NOT again. More to dislike than to like."
""
"Overall: Not bursting with flavor by any means, but true to the EPA style that definitely leans toward the maltier side when compared to APAs."

"The beer was ok crisp and refreshing but nothing all that great."

"In the process of tasting 9 new beers and so far this one rates an 8 out of 10. I was really surprised at the great tase since I normally prefer a hoppy beer or a very dark stout. I woul definately buy this by the case if it were available here in Pennsylvania. It is so smooth with an almost light body. I could almost classify this as a pilsner but with more flavor."

"Poured a deep gold, soapy head, fine lacing. Smells zesty and citrusy. . . fresh. Taste is well balanced and smooth, with a bit of bite on the tail end. Mouthfeel is excellent, creamier than expected, and prods you to pop another open. An overall well example of the style, and just very enjoyable to drink."

"Got a bottle at AJ's. This reminds me of Tree Fort Ale from Michigan, which is also a very bright take on the English pale ale. The flavor and aroma are a mix of lemony hops and toasty, bready malts. It's not necessarily clean, like there's a gentle creamy undertone, with the yeast playing a small complement to the malts. A tasty session beer, worth trying."

"My bottle says 4.5%, sessionable even by English-style standards. Poors a light amber with ample, slightly aggressive head. Lemony esters detectable in the nose with subtle biscuit and woodsy hops in the background. Very dry on the palette, hops add gently bitterness, citrus-lemon flavors are reminiscent of a hefeweizen. Lacing holds up nicely with carbonation giving the beer much fullness in the mouth. Very enjoyable for it's weight class. Featured hops are Golding and Fuggle- this isn't your West Coast pale ale, still full of flavor. 21 IBUs. Text on the bottle suggests you shouldn't drink this beer alone. Guess I blew it. Tasty nonetheless."

"Overall a good all-purpose beer. On the lighter side, and not too much to it. Tastes great. I have it at Four Peaks Brewery all the time, and matches well with a lot of the things on their menu. Not really hoppy, either. This beer has a great smell to it and goes down extremely smoothly."

"Pretty light pouring beer, and really there wasn't a lot too it. It was overly sweet but lacked a lot of body to the beer, which is a little surprising. Very little detectable hops, and just a bland beer overall. A little too light and a little too sweet."
"A light quaff with a spicy touch of hops. More drinkable than some but not very interesting."
"O: a good session brew that has enough flavor."
"3/4 finger white head, medium-slow dissipation with retained head climbing up side of glass. Amber clear body, plethora of streams of uprising carbonation. Taste is caramel forward, a bit grassy, some breadiness. Taste mirrors nose, fairly caramely, lacking a bit in balance, though for a EPA pretty close to style, hops really subsumed by the malt. Medium mouthfeel, soft, acceptable effervescence. Nothing remarkable, though the bready notes helped drinkability. Frankly, I'd rather have a Mirror Pond."
"Drinkability is okay. It's mild and generic. It's also utterly forgettable. The plasticy phenols are the most distinguishing factor, and are not appropriate for the style."
"Has a nice color, smells good too. The taste is the best aspect, very flavorful. I may not pick it out of the whole bunch first, but I still pick up a 6 pack for parties. If you like dark beers, or average beers, 8th street shouldn't appeal to all."
"Appears golden orange, hazy, with a tiny white head, less than 1 finger. The head vanishes quickly, leaving no lacing. Smell is somewhat muted, hard to smell it over the aromas wafting through the restaurant. Smells like fresh floral hops and bready malts, hints of citrus. Tastes especially like bready/biscuity malts and bittering hops up front, very malt forward pale ale, english style for sure. Some caramel and more bread in the middle, then a subtle hop bitterness in the finish that lingers for quite a while. Medium-light bodied with very low carbonation. Extremely smooth mouthfeel, sticky bitter lingering dryness coats the mouth. Tastes more like an ESB than a pale ale in my opinion, extremely balanced. Still nice to have a low abv English style on cask."
"D- Overall, an exceptional session ale. Very full flavored and thirst quenching at the same time. 4.5%ABV makes this a beer to buy by the case."
"The cask gave a super creamy body that was just about the best part of this beer. Easy drinking and quite enjoyable I must say."
"Had it on tap at the brewery in Tempe, this was my introduction to 4 Peaks. I thought it was an excellent example of English pale ale. The aroma is a beautiful blend of pale malt and English hops (my nose said Goldings), acting as an invitation to drink. The beauty of the aroma carries through to the flavor and mouth feel. The balance of malt, hop flavor, sweet and bitter is excellent. To my taste, it would be hard to improve on this one."
"Overall impression: This isn't too exciting .. but it's drinkable. Solid beer that I wouldn't mind having a few of."
"Very nice drinking, well balanced and light on the abv"
"D: There's a nice blend of familiar and complex here - the sort of beer you could do a session with -- especially since it's only 4.5% abv."
"D: Good for seshing on. Personally, I think it's a little bland compared to Four Peaks other concoctions, still a good brew though."
"I found this English-style ale very easy to drink, and would enthusiastically pick up a six-pack in the future. It is an excellent Arizona beer, made light and ready for the hotter temperatures from April to October. It is recommended to be accompanied by Indian or Middle-Eastern food, but as I'm not the biggest fan of either, I say this would be spot on with a nice basket of fish and chips. If you're going to go with an English-style beer, you might as well go with English-style food! Cheers!"
"D-the better of the two more widely distributed four peaks offerings (the other being kiltlifter)"
"Drinkability this is easy drinking and is well balanced and has a nice taste and mouthfeel 4.5"
"Drinks: Four Peaks categorizes it as an English-style bitter, a beer I'm still trying to determine whether I'm a fan of. But I do appreciate adherence to style, and Four Peaks delivers in that regard. They even adjust the softness of the water used in each beer to reflect the region whence each style originated. Can't say I'll never try 8th Street again, but Hop Knot remains my go-to Four Peaks brew."
"This beer had one of the best clarity cask offerings I have ever drank, showcases the hop flavor exceptionally."
"D: One of the things I've definitely learned from being a member of this site is that when in (insert city name here), drink as the locals do. This completely applied this time (at Phoenix for a conference)."
"Taste kind of sweet. Fruity. Lemon and orange notes, a little heavy on those actually. Carbonation is great for an English. I taste candy as well. Very drinkable for warmer weather."
"Enjoyed on tap in Scottsdale (brewed in Tempe). A keeper, English style hops and understated approach. A faint hop aroma. Light yellow and very lacey. Average mouthfeel. A nice bitterness. Carbonation right there.Good balance between bitterness and the malting."
"Glad I tried it. I wouldn't chase it."
"Pours a light yellow/orange color with good clarity and a very small white head that leaves some soapy sticking on the rim of the glass. A good bitter hop character in the nose, brighter than expected with a tangy yeast ester and a slight note of sweet malt. Light in body, good flavor and easy enough to drink all day."
"Overall: A very pleasing and drinkable EPA, but might not be hoppy enough to please Americanized hop seekers who immediately think hops when they see the words ""pale"" and ""ale"" near each other. A fine beer in my opinion, could be paired nicely with fruit salad and wheat muffins on a spring morning in the sun."
"D: Overall, this is a very drinkable beer that I would enjoy having often. The flavor is balanced yet complex and would be appropriate for a variety of occasions and food parings. Furthermore, I enjoyed this English pale ale much more than the Boddingtons Pub Ale I have tried. This is currently my favorite beer."
"Golden straw color with some orange highlights. White head jumps up but doesn't last. Nose is sweet with hints of candied orange. On the tongue, 8th Street packs a little more hopping in the bottle: there's a pleasing bite of citrus with a hint of resin. The English style malt is right there too. It loses a little in the carbonation department, as I found myself wishing the heft of the malt would come through more. But alas, it is washed away too quickly."
"D: Beautiful session beer, exceedingly easy to drink."
"D - This is a pretty good pale that I could session with its good taste and fairly low abv worth trying if you get the chance"
"Pale orange in color with a head of creamy texture. The nose is citrusy initially. It gets sweeter with orange notes and wild flowers. Some toasted malt is mixed in. Light and clean at first, a refreshing note of green tea hits the palate. Orange peel is subtle, but that tea flavor is very dominate on the stage. Not much malt is tasted in this one. A little unbalanced for my liking, but still a pretty decent brew."
"Overall this wasn't a great beer by any stretch, but it succeeds in putting money in the bank for Four Peaks. Worth a shot."
"Comments: very drinkable beer. The beer claims to be a English pale ale, but I would call in more of an American Pale Ale with its exuberant floral hop flavor."
"Pours a filtered amber yellow color body. Average white head. Carbonated fruity taste, clean aftertaste. Citrusy. Lemony, maybe grapefruit. Creamy tasting. Citrusy aroma, hoppy. Some nuttiness l.n the taste as it warms up."
"Palate is skewed into the lemon citrus direction also, especially with the cask version of the ale. The seemingly lighter body makes this almost as light and refreshing as a cold lemonade, but the slight toasty flavors of the malt and overall rounded hoppiness remind you of what's in the glass."
"I don't got much to say since there's not much going on here."
"Great session beer."
"Very good drinkability, and with the lower alcohol this makes a good session beer."
"D: Could drink all day long!"
"D-This was a great beer. I enjoyed it very much. Incredible flavor."
"Overall- Nice flavors and easy to drink. An enjoyable smooth Pale Ale. (Thanks Dana!)"
"Overall, I think this is a very drinkable English Pale Ale that has its hops take a rather different direction then the norm and that's fine by me. It certainly held my interest for the session."
"Four Peaks 8th Street Ale is a decent English APA that is probably one of the brewpub's biggest sellers. It's approachable, it's reasonably tasty and it's sessionable. Keep your expectations in check and you'll be pleased. Thanks tayner."
"MK"
"A medium yellow with a lot of foam, this beer didn't have a whole lot of aroma to it. Some malt was about it. Tastes of malt and maybe some nuts, the flavor is mostly bitter and two-dimensional. It's pretty drinkable in an unobtrusive way, but it could use some more flavor to it. I like this beer the first few times I drank it, but as I've had the chance to try some more complex beers, this one seems a little less impressive every time I drink it. A shame, because it's local and I wish Four Peaks the best. They should bottle some of their bigger and better beers, so that the rest of the world can try them."
"anytime this is availabe cask get it"
"D- Very nice balance of sweet and bitter flavors, unique, delicious, and easy to drink, this pale ale is one of the top core beers from 4Peaks"
"D: I don't think I'll have another."
"D - This is a good beer to socialize over. It's not too strong, so you can have a few without the worry of getting silly. I also like it because it's local."
"Drinkability is good. Not a really fancy, or big flavored beer. But I like it, it is tasty and easy drinking. Very sessionable... I'll take another."
"from nvsblman for my anny bombing"
"Drinkability- I'll stay away from this one in the future."
"D: A drinkable but inoffensive beer. A few would cause minimal problems."
"Drinks pretty good, just nothing too complicated here. I'd say this reminds me more of an APA than an English PA , decent session ale"
"D- a very nice session beer, goes down easily, and goes pretty well with all most any food i've tried it with, gotta say, my favorite local beer"
"D- very sessionable due to its easy to handle flavors and it wont make you fill full very fast. Not my kind of session beer, but very well done none the less."
"Not a bad little beer from the AZ. I'm not too familiar with the English Pale Ale style, but I am guessing that it's not as hoppy as the American Pale Ales. At least, that's what I got from this one. Sure, it had it's hop presense, but it wasn't over the top. I thought it blended well with the caramel malts. On top of that, it kind of had a slight orangey finish. I would reccomend this one."
"Props for such a well made beer! It is very easy to drink but with plenty of flavor and little alcohol. Session beer! I would love for this beer to be available in Nebraska. It kind of reminds me of 3Fs Pride & Joy Mild Ale. Lingering aftertaste that begs to be paired with burgers, grilled cheese, or anything BBQ. Lovely! Thank you Aunt Kathy and Uncle Rick for sending me this fine AZ brew. Recommended."
"Was in Tempe recently for business and stopped by a local Fry's grocery store to haul a couple of sixers home. Wasn't sure what I was looking for, but saw they had the local microbrewery there and brought a 6-pack of their EPA home. Dark gold, light copperish, and very clear. Head doesn't last but leaves a light tan ring around my glass. Aroma of malt and English hops. Beer is well balanced, and a good example of the EPA style. Finishes malty but with enough hop bitterness. This is one I will hunt down and bring home EVERY time I'm in the Phoenix area."
"This beer is a pleasant surprise, I grabbed it on a lark, and the ample hop presence is quite nice. I get notes of orange peel, grapefruit, and toasted biscuits. Quite nice, and I am glad I picked it up."
"This is a golden orange brew that poured a decent head, with ample carbonation, and is leaving a splotchy lacing. Nose is of floral malts, very interesting. Taste is a bit malty to start with a carmel floral ever so slight hop finish. Mouthfeel is very full for this style. Drinkability is good, this has the makings of a nice session beer!"
"Produced a light head, not too surprising. The beer is crystal clear, golden-amber. The aroma is a little light, but clean with a hint of hops and malt. The flavor is nice, also crisp but with a pronounced hoppy flavor and a nicely balanced malt / bitterness combination. Some hints of cinnamon and maybe a little caramel are apparent. Very tasty, very nice for its style (I'd take it over a Bass any day), just also not very adventurous (granted, this isn't an extreme beer style, but it could use a little pep or more ale-like character.) Thanks to my Secret Santa nvblsman for this one."
"Overall: Solid bitter, but it'll leave you wanting something dry to finish up with."
"Was at the brewery this afternoon. Sampled two pints of this one. Server came back both times with a brew lacking any kind of a head, just a ghost of one ringing the circumference of the glass. Beer itself was a shade lighter than your standard amber...red-gold might be the best way to describe it. Good shot of hops up the nose in the aroma, some grain/floral notes. Beer had the same tea-tang I experienced with the brewery's Peach beer. Are they adding Lipton's to every batch? Not much bite in the taste, the hops seeming to expend their force in the nose. Maybe I've been conditioned by Sierra Nevada, but I usually expect the hops in a Pale Ale to grab me by the throat. finished with an aftertaste of tea. Drinkable, but why settle?"
"Comments - A very easy to drink beer that I have had both on tap at the brewery and in the bottle. A great first starter beer to the land of craft brews. Both on tap and in the bottle are great. They have always seemed to have been able to keep the quality very consistant. Great choice if you are looking for a great tasting session craft beer that is very easy to drink."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a half inch of whitish head which shrunk down to a small layer of foam reasonably quickly. Slight lacing, but what does form stays put. Light amber in hue, with a light malty aroma. Flavor is of light malt, which is partnered rather well a complementary amount of bitterness. A bit of a metallic aftertaste kind of detracts from the whole experience. Nothing terrible about this brew, but no cause to trumpet it's existance either."
"Light copper body, with some carbonation, topped by a foamy two-plus-fingers of tight micro bubbles. Aroma is heavy and a hint harsh with hay, with some more floral hops in the background. Taste is lighty malty, with some lighty floral and earthy hop accents. Aftertaste has a very slight soapy note. Mouthfeel is slighty watery. Slight defects aside, it could make for a suitable session beer for an evening, but not one I would frequent."
"Comments  A huge thanks to Gusler for sending this bottle up to the Northwest. I really enjoyed the chance to try this local Arizona brew."
"Medium brown color. Medium head. Aroma is malty, fruity and slightly sweet. A medium bodied pale ale. Malts are slightly sweet and fruity. Hops are spicy. A milder flavored pale ale, more to the English Style. Well balanced. Very drinkable. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finishis dry. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"Pours a nice deep amber color, the head beige and moderate, the lace adequate. Nose is malt, but has hints of the English hops. Starts a bit sweet, the middle thinner than I like, the finish is hop spicy and pleasant. Normally have the draught version as with the ""Kilt Lifter", but both are drinkable and not over powering, which make them a likeable beer for most drinkers."
