"Not so good. Snoozefest right here."

"Good session ale. Mild hops mingle with a wheat and malt backbone. Little bit of sweetness/honey tone here. Lively carbonation. Goes down easily."

"Lite gold body. Great ""beer"" aroma. Sweet crisp taste. Very sessionable. Excellent drinkable beer."
""

"Think session beer.  Nice for hot summer days when you want something a little lighter."

"Bottle as a trade extra. Thanks! Pours bright clear golden with a big fluffy white head. Strong aroma of lemon peel and orange rinds, some grass, not much else. Flavor is orange rinds and stale hops, some sweetness like honey, a bit of biscuit malt here. Light bodied and medium plus carbonation. Dirty unpleasant finish. Overall I’m not very impressed with this one."

"Still, it's hard to fault a beer for being too drinkable, even if it isn't extraordinarily interesting or experimental.  Really, though, that's the case with many members of Revolution's standard rotation: tasty, drinkable, and of an even, dependable quality, but decidedly less avant garde than the brewery's name might suggest.  This is, again, not a slight: it's just a necessary remark in a region that boasts such heavy-hitting tinkerers and boundary-pushers as Three Floyds, Half Acre, Off Color, Two Brothers, and even (when considering the stuff they still brew in Chicago) Goose Island."

"Touted as an English style summer ale, but I think it is more similar to American summer ales. Mild citrus aroma with a gentle hops aftertaste.  Golden yellow to straw color thin head with little lacing. The beer is rather mild as expected for a simmer beer. Good and easy drinking with good flavor."

"Cross of Gold pours with a thick white head that diminishes quickly with frothy lacing on the glass and a thin layer of foam as it warms. Pale golden in color, the nose has spicy hops and some lemon mixed in with sweet malts. Taste is sweet up front with citrus hops and a light herbal spice and sweetness in the back. A very good session beer as well as a great after mowing beer for summer. Not the best beer you ever had but a solid offering for the style."

"O - I really like this for what it is. Nice complexity and flavor, fairly good price. I'd buy it again if the timing was right and had a craving for it."

"Overall: This brew comes out as an incredibly easy drinking english pale. Not as flavorful or complex as their ""A Little Crazy"" but I wouldn't hesitate to drink this again. I got this in a bomber but a better format would be in a six pack in my opinion."

"This is a really enjoyable and pleasant ale with a nice balance of flavor and a good aroma. Very easy to drink and definitely worth trying."

"Edit: I see after the fact this bottle was dated almost a year ago. I'll find a fresher one and re-review"
""
"O: A very balanced brew. This is not the most original combination of flavors coming out of Revolution but a very enjoyable one. It is citrusy and refreshing while being just heavy enough to have all year round."
""
""
"They told me this is the lightest beer they make,, but out of the 20 or so that I've tried here I also rank it one of their best."

"22 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 6/19/2013. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy bright golden color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of big orange peel, grapefruit, lemon zest, orange rind, floral, grass, wheat, light honey, and floral earthiness. Very nice aromas with big citrus hop presence and moderate malt balance; with good strength. Taste of orange zest, tangerine, grapefruit, lemon zest, floral, grass, bread, wheat, light honey, and floral earthiness. Slight floral bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, floral, grass, bread, wheat, light honey, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity of citrus hop flavors with a moderate malt balance; with good flavor robustness and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a very smooth and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice blond ale! All around good balance and complexity of hop and malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"Overall - It is a great beer to have a while waiting for dinner a pallet cleanser."

"One of those beers that I see on tap everywhere and or some reason have not had. That is my mistake, don’t make the same one!"

"definitely the most generic beer happening at revolution. not a bad beer, but this one is brewed for the much less adventurous palate, not a throwaway, but a relatively uninspired brew. it is darker than the standard golden, with just a hint of amber to it, and a lace head an inch high. it smells and tastes like a mix of euro pils and pale malts, nothing interesting on the grain front. the hops are light as well, balancing bitterness without nuances of any kind. sort of an oatmealy sudsy feel to this one, with more body than is customary, and fine carbonation. revolution does some really cool stuff, but this one is just a beer to me, nothing to write home about."
"this is my second revolution brew and both have been solid. not spectacular, but very good."

"The Cross of Gold was good...but I agree with others....this is more of a blonde ale than an English IPA...the Beer poured a hazy yellow with white head that left a spotty lace. The scent was sligth bitter hops with a subtle waith of citrus. The taste was a very good balanced beer that did not overwhelm....sligth citrus flare helped to give the beer character. The mouthfeel was medium to light in body with decent carbonation. Overall it was ok...probably would not go seekign it out....but glad I tried it."

"However, this has a vegetal quality that doesn't quite sit right with me. t has a dull bitter edge to it. I'll pass on the next round."

"Crisp lightly toasted malts with maybe an apple tart flavor. Grassy and earthy clean hop bitterness. The hops add the right, astringent clean pop to this beer. Easy to drink and cleansing for sure."

"O: I'm new to Revolution, but I'm totally digging their stuff so far. Also, a bomber of this was dirt cheap."

"Pours a clear light yellow with a foamy bone colored head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, fruits, and citrus zest. Taste is much the same with a mild hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is light and refreshing."

"This brew is not horrible, but it does not excite me either. It's average and deserves to be rethought, perhaps it's the style that I just don't agree with...? Can't recommend."
""
""
""
""
"Insanely smooth, crisp beer. Finds just the right balance of...well...everything. Not bursting with flavor, nor is it the most interesting beer I've ever had, but it's just really enjoyable. I could probably put back an obnoxious amount of this if given the chance (and following morning with nothing scheduled). I cant find anything wrong with it."

"O -- While it's slightly stronger than usual for the style, I'm labeling this a Best Bitter. It has the right body and flavor characters along with a great drinkability (in other words, you want to follow with another). A great take on the style with some great English Ale characteristics -- don't drink it too cold."

""

"Drink- This was a very good beer and a welcome suprise. I normally am not a fan of Blonde ales, but with the hop additions, this was quite delicious."

"My first Revolution bottle purchase... may there be many more to follow! Appearance is slightly cloudy, mainly gold, generous 2 finger head retains nicely. Plenty of lacing left behind. Nose starts with faint green hop presence and lemon, sturdy bread presence as well. Smells fresh and tasty. Taste starts off with light caramel sweetness followed by fruity hops. Moderate amount of bitterness comes through and is countered by dry bready finish. Everything is working in balance here, and there is quite a bit of character for a blonde ale. Mouthfeel is light with moderate to high carbonation. A solid brew from an amazing brewery."
""
"O: Very solid session ale. I could easily see this being the ""money maker"" that affords them the ability to continue to explore their more experimental leanings."
""
"O: One of the best American blondes I've had."
""
""
"Gotta love any beer that references William Jennings Bryan, amiright? This stuff pours a clear golden brass topped by a finger or so of white foam. The nose comprises light citrus (I hate being that vague, but, frankly, the citrus smell was that vague, so...), light biscuit, and a very slight hint of lemongrass. The taste brings in more of the same, with the biscuit and citrus (now mostly identified as a lemon-orange blend) leading the way in geminic (yeah, I just coined a new word, folks!) harmony. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a crisp, lightly dry finish. Overall, a nice, simple, straightforward little blonde, one I wouldn't mind spending some more time with later..."
"O - A nice beer to begin your session with or something to recommend to someone who's just getting started into craft beer."

"a very drinkable beer. It's good and works as a more session type beer. It is what it is"

"I've had this one a number of times. Usually when I feel like bouncing around their beer menu for the day, and I've already had their Porter, IPA, and whatever's on cask . The last time I had it, I was informed by my server that the batch was not only really fresh, but was a generation zero yeast crop. The spankin-new yeast produced a product that was far crisper, clearer, and cleaner than any other trial with this ale. The near absent bitterness and hop profile were suddenly quite apparent, and I even detected some fun little spicy esters, though very mild. Near-brilliant gold in color, and exceptionally drinkable. It's downfall is that it's just not that interesting a brew, which is why it's also their no.2 most popular. It's the ""fun microbrew option"" for your mojito drinking gal pals, though again, it's not bad either."
"Revolution has awesomer beers, but there's certainly nothing wrong with this one. A good choice for friends who aren't beer afficinados and just want a good crisp beer."
"O - A pretty nice beer that avoids being overly harsh and yeasty. Easy to drink with good flavor, enjoyed this beer even though its a style that isn't one of my preferred."
"Pours a fairly-light golden color with a single-finger white head and a bit of lacing as it falls into a thin collar. The nose is a bit light and then hits fairly well with a nice hop aroma resembling the better versions of the style that I've encountered. Milt citrus with a bit of tangerine. The flavor is slightly-sweet with a very mild malt character as well as a touch of hop flavor. Light body with slight bitterness and a very slight sweetness as well. Really quite drinkable."
"Overall, wow, what a great golden ale. This is typically a boring style in my opinion, but this one was very drinkable and enjoyable."
"The feel is ok, not as watery ad zi'd expect. Pretty drinkable."
"*I struggled with this review because while the beer is not my favorite, it is well-made and should appeal to the majority of beer drinkers out there. I don't want to discourage anyone from trying it, but I want to help fellow beer advocate's make an eductaed decision when choosing what to enjoy."
"Since I'm the first person reviewing this beer, feel free to take what I say with a grain of salt. When I first had this beer, I thought I was drinking an IPA; my server told me that it's actually a lager which is brewed with ""a bit"" of hops. Needless to say, I thought that it had more than ""a bit"" of hops. This is a unique beer that you will find enjoyable if you don't mind what would seem like a mis-categorization. I rated this beer highly because I liked it even though it doesn't seem to fit what the brewers call an ""American Pale/Blonde Ale."""
