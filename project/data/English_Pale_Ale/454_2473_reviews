"A great tasting Pale on tap at the brewpub. I had this right after their ESB. They were almost exactly the same color, a nice dark amber. It was decidedly hoppy, but still had a good balance. The hops were of the earthy spicy variety, not fruity or piney like a typical American IPA. The beer was very smooth, I kept liking it better as the glass neared the empty mark. Highly recommended for anyone who likes a good Pale Ale."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 3/23/2014. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy deep orange/copper color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of grapefruit, lemon zest, orange, apple, floral, grass, pine, caramel, toast, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of citrus/grassy hops and moderate malt sweetness; with solid strength. Taste of grapefruit, lemon zest, orange, apple, floral, grass, pine, caramel, toast, biscuit, and floral/grassy earthiness. Good amount of earthy pine/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, lemon zest, orange, apple, floral, grass, pine, caramel, toast, biscuit, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice robustness and solid complexity of citrus/earthy hops, bready malt, and light yeast ester flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and some slight cloying bitterness after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and slightly prickly/sticky mouthfeel that is ok. Alcohol is well hidden with no warming present after the finish. Overall this was a very solid English pale ale. Good balance and solid complexity of citrus/earthy hops, bready malt, and light yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A pleasantly enjoyable offering."

"3.0 D: It's not necessarily bad, but it's weird. Some might love it and probably more will hate it. Either way, I was glad to try it."

"Taste/feel: I was expecting a rating of about 84 for this beer, but was surprised at the 76. This is my first beer from Arcadia, and I like it a lot. Being a pale ale, it's not the most exciting beer in the world, but it's insanely drinkable, has a very nice mouth feel, and the finish is clean. A refreshing English Pale Ale that I'd love to have again. One of the best that I've had of the style. Seems that I'm the minority, as a lot of people don't care for it that much. Maybe I got a fresh keg? I dig it."

"Pours a murky gold with a finger and a half of white head with steadily rising carbonation bubbles. There were also some odd floaters in the glass. Leaves a good amount of lacing. Definitely a clean looking beer. Smells a lot like a wheat ale, only leaving odd the additional lemon scent. I also smell some mild grains and very light malt. The taste pretty much follows the nose. Tastes predominantly of very smooth wheat along with a very very light malt. Definitely an easy drinker. The mouthfeel pretty much remains the same, except it allows some very slight fruityness to come through. Overall, this is a great summer beer and VERY easy to drink. Probably the best pale/wheat ale that I have had to date."

"This one looks nice on the pour, but it's all downhill from there. Flavor profile shows more nut tones than the hops that I'd be expecting. There are some minor citrus characteristics, but it all just seems to be missing the mark. Might be interesting on cask, but it certainly isn't all that interesting off the bottle."

"Very light and crisp feel that tingles on the tongue, with little to no carbonation, a medium body and a grainy aftertaste that’s slightly bitter; a hint of lemon lingers after each swallow as it did in the nose after each whiff. A nice enjoyable pale ale that goes down smooth, easy and was enjoyable."
""
"I recall having this ale from the bottle several years ago and enjoying it. Assuming the tap was clean, perhaps my taste has changed or the ale's recipe changed; either way I was disappointed and did not request another."
""
""
"Overall: Bland - but an extremely easy drink."
"Chalky palate with muted toasted caramel and crystal malts. Yeasty, chalky fruit that is more muted than the malt. The palate finishes thin, but with good, subtle Earthy, Natural hopping."

"O: Decent beer, quite enjoyable. Most English Pale Ales are a bit more laid back than this one. Will have to visit this fishing hole again sometime."
"This beer pours a bright orange copper color. It has a nice 2-finger off-white head on it. The head has pretty good retention, and it leaves some scattered lace behind on the glass. The nose has a nice bit of floral hops and some caramel sweetness. There are also some aromas of lemony citrus and a bit of yeastiness. The taste pretty much follows the nose. It starts out with some bready malts and a decent hop presence. There are some other flavors of caramel and fruit. Some lemony citrus is on the back end. The finish leaves some lingering caramel malt flavor and a little bit of hop bitterness. This has a medium body and average carbonation. It goes down easy and has a nice smooth feel to it. It is pretty refreshing. There is a good amount of a sweetness and a bit of hop bitterness. The drinkability here is pretty good. It is easy to drink, and I wouldn't mind having a few in an evening. The flavor is pretty good, but it could use more hop presence. Not the best, but I think it is worth a try."

"O - Since this is from a brewery that has put out some other decent beers, I'm inclined to give them the BOTD and say it might have been past expiration or somesuch, but I probably won't ever get this one again."
"O: Very mild but smooth and sessionable. Could drink about 50 of these."

"Taste is sharper than the aroma suggests...to me anyway. Caramel and toffee-ish in the front and soft throughout. Somewhat metallic twang introduces the hop characteristics. These aren't over the top, but a bit more ""American"" in that the florals move toward the citrus side. Pine is a bit more aggressive. With that said, the hops are not dominant. The malt is steady all the way through and keeps the beer well balanced."
"I hope I never tire of picking up random singles at the store... This one pours a clear golden amber topped by over a finger of mostly white foam. The nose comprises light lemon zest, lighter grapefruit peel, grass, light caramel, and sweet flowers. The taste brings in more of the same, but the grass is stronger now, and the caramel has morphed into a mild, lightly biscuity toffee. The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta dry finish. Overall, a pretty decent brew, nothing special, but something easily drinkable if the desire is there."
"The extreme carbonation in the pour and the lack of carbonation in the mouthfeel coupled with the restrained taste make this a pretty mediocre offering."
"I think the brewery may have tweaked the beer a bit. The label has been updated (but not on their website?). A bit more hop-forward than I recall on first trying the beer some time ago (but never got around to reviewing). A bit grassy up front, with some sharpness quickly fading to a more broad malt presence. Finish is lasting bitternes. Struck me as a bit hoppier than the English pale ale prototype."
"The feel of this beer is medium bodied and is easy going down. There is a nice smooth feel that makes this a good drinker and not bad to have paired with food."
"Overall- This is my 2nd time having this pale ale and thought possibly the first time I tried it was an old batch. Certainly not the case. Too light for a pale ale, and has way too much carbonation! Of course it could be sessional and drinkability is easy but I will never go back to this one again. Glad I tried again though."
"A serviceable pale ale, and easy drinking enough to have another. Obtained as part of Arcadia Ales' mixed 12 pack, a recommendation I make for anyone looking to have a mix of good craft beer on hand for friends."
"Average at best."
"This pours medium amber with a nice, two finger, highly frothy head with good retention and good lace. On the nose there are biscuit malts, oats, wet grass, and dried fruity esters. In the mouth the hops serve more for the slightly bitter, maybe a little tart, medium finish. Before all that is a dry malt bill, toasted biscuit, with the slightly bitter finish more tacked-on than seamlessly integrated. The oat note in the nose and in the mouth kind of comes across like a pale oatmeal stout, which is sort of strange but it works. This is a strange beer, and I like it quite a bit. I lack reference points for English pales but I like the subdued hop presence, and if indeed those are oats that I was getting, I'm a big fan of that too."
"Pours a clear, copper color. 3/4 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of dry hops, sweet malt, slight spice, floral hops, slight citrus hops, and a hint of grain. Fits the style of an English Pale Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of dry hops, hint of honey, slight sweet malt, slight grain, slight pale malt, and slight floral hops. Overall, better aroma than body, great appearance, but still lacking as an English Pale Ale."
"On the take home scale I'd buy a six pack of this beer."
"Strong yeast bite that I associate with a homebrew. It tastes ""thin"" although the body is moderate. The flavor picks up (mildly) when swallowed where the hop shows up. It's rather nondescript."
"Very light. Not much going on. All of the flavors are a little too subtle. I'll probably pass this one over."
"much carbonation. this beer is just weak. the hops suck and the only thing holding it together is the caramel malt. this shouldn't be a pale ale but just a plain ale."
"D: Would be a nice summer brew. Very nice, but not amazing."
"Beer pours into a nice orange-yellow body with a big white head that has some carbonation, good retention and little lacing. It has a nice floral smell with some apple and oranges while the taste is of some apples, oranges, pears, some floral hops and a hint of malts. It has a nice creamy buttery mouth feel that gives it have good drinkability. Not the best Pale Ale I've tasted, but not too bad either."
"Extremely drinkable. Took down a sixer with ease. Not filling and goes well with just about any food. A sleeper for sure. Will put this on my regular rotation."
"D - Flavours don't seem to jive very well in this one. It's not bad but not great either."
"Not exactly my cup of tea, but a decent brew. It's worth a try if you like the maltiness and buttery texture."
"Overall i am glad i tried but i wouldn't seek it out, there's many more tastier pale ales out there."
"A lower-tier pale ale at best."
"The mouth is smooth with low carbonation. I could have this one once in awhile, but that metallic twang would limit me to one or two."
"D = Not what I was expwcting. An ale that tasted like the others in the sampler with a hop differance."
"Poured out a honey to gold with a thin light brown head and not much lacing. Smelled on the weaker side typical of a pale with a mild hop and burnt malt aroma. Taste was what i expected from the smell with malts the dominating factor and a slight hoppy bite at the finish. Medium mouthfeel and somewhat oily. Drinkability is very good with the low alchohol content and i can't say i wouldn't buy this again. Not my favorite but very respectable! Michigan micro brews are becoming a force in the craft brew scene and i am glad to be able to drink their offerings at will."
"A good English pale ale. Hop character is much more pronounced overshadowing a lot of the malt."
"~Jonathan Passow"
"The beer pours a nice golden/amber color with a thick frothy off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a pale and crystal malt scent along with some fruity yeast esters. It's dry with a light hop presence. The taste is decent as well. It has a very drinkable pale and light crystal malt flavor that goes down easy with a mild hop character and a fruity yeast finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a pretty good English pale ale. It's easy drinking and true to style."
"a good, lighter ale which works great with food. Pours a light golden color with a little bit of head to it. The smell was not overpowering, but smells like any other ale. Taste was on the lighter side with mild bitterness. once again, not overpowering but not tasteless. Mouthfeel was pretty thin a crisp. A good beer if you want to have several and a great beer to have with food. Overall a pretty normal ale."
"Cheers!"
"Overall: not impressed with any of the beer that came in the mixed twelve pack of arcadia that i purchased. it all kinda had the same taste to me like there was not enough yeast in it to ferment all the sugars?"
"Pours an amber golden color, with a slight white head and no lacing. Aroma is of roasted malts, some mild hops, and something I can't place but seems off. Taste consists of a slight hop flavor, with a plastic taste as well. Mouthfeel is pretty light and watery."
"Notes: Probably a great beer for the 'ol fishing trip or a weekend with the guys (as long as it is very cold!). The thing is, there are many other (cheaper) options that would fit the purpose that this beer serves."
"D- This is a drinkable beer but to be honest I would try something else out if given the chance. Just my opinion but there are better beers to be had in the style. I would drink another though if given to me."
"Pours a golden color, moving to orange, pretty hazy I think - but it slowly clears up, with a nice 2cm white head. I must say that the head is loose, and it sort of fell down, and only left a bit of lacing. The smell is very raw, and there are sort of 3 elements. First I noticed a distinct graininess, with something like lemon zest on top of it. Then there's a yeasty smell, with a bit of a fermentation smell - as if it was actively going on. Then there's an airiness to it a real lightness to the whole beer. The taste comes first with this slight pale maltiness, almost like it's mixed with lemon-lime soda, almost some artificial (read: un-malty, like sucrose). There's just a little bit of all of the normal stuff in this one. The body is somewhere around medium-thin, and the carbonation rushes in with every drink, almost stinging and biting. Lively and interesting. Fairly enjoyable and easy to drink. I doubt if I would come back to it with so much more out there. And I have to say honestly, this beer fits just perfectly as an average beer in the category."
"D= This was somehow well made yet it fell flat for me. I think the flavors were so light that the floral note seemed out of place. All in all, a decent pale ale but not one I would especially seek out again."
"This beer is appetizing, light and flavorful. A good session beer!"
"This one came out of Arcadia's mixed 12 pack. This is the first of the four to review. Pours a hazy orange copper color with a nice two finger head that slowly dissipates to about half the size and leaves nice lacing on the glass. The smell is sweet and fruity with orange and honey. The taste follows the smell with crisp hoppy flavor followed by sweet honey and orange flavors. The mouthfeel has a mediium body with high carbonation. Drinkability is good. I could easily throw back two or three of these."
"Morey's Bottom Line: Taste like a home-brewed pale ale in my opinion. A well done one, but not good enough to be satisfied with for a decent brewery."
"Overall, not enjoyable verging on slightly unpleasant and not as good as other pale ales I've had. Poorest of the lot from the brewery sampler."
"Still a fair beer though. Try it."
"A nice ""session"" beer for sure."
"D - No thank you! Hopefully this was a bad bottle, but it doesn't really have that noticeable skunked aroma and flavor. Not good."
"Drinkability: Decent beer, worth a shot. Not my favorite APA by a long shot."
"The Angler's Ale was my least favorite of Arcadia's 12-pack, however, it is worth a try."
"D- Not bad. Seems rather thirst quenching. It lacks complexity and the malt flavors are pretty bland. The lemony citrus was interesting and enjoyable."
" Pours dark golden/to slight orange and is a bit cloudy. I found everything about this beer to be very subtle,and balanced, nice sweet earthy malty,hoppy tones in the aroma and flavor. Not alot to say ,just a damn good drinkable glass of ale."
"An inauspicious start and the flavour profile was not too promising either. After warming for a while though it began to come into itself. Taste-wise I was vividly reminded of your English bitter. Fairly mild in flavor, dry bitterness, nice citrus tartness."
"Notes from 12/25/05"
"Drinkability - I'm certainly disappointed as I can taste a decent beer hiding in there somewhere. Per the notch, best purchased before February. Hmm, it's still September, I did *my* part!"
"D--This just tasted way off. Doesn't really resemble an APA at all. This may just simply be a bad batch but I don't get a sense that the base is close to the style it says it is."
"Pours a clear copper with a good sized head. It smells of mild hops, malt and caramel. I'm really having trouble putting the taste into words but it reminds me alot of Bass Pale Ale but more tart. I'm not sure why this is categorized as an American Pale Ale, it seems much more along the lines on an English Pale Ale (it even says it is brewed in the English style on the label). The mouthfeel is thick and creamy, again, similar to Bass. Overall, not bad but not great."
"Pours a highly carbonated clear copper color with a huge off white head. The aroma is lightly sweet malt, light floral, fruit and paper. The flavor is masked by paper although minimal amounts of fruit, floral and malt manage to make there way through. Medium bodied, oily texture. Finishes very metallic."
"a very nice pale offering from arcadia for sure, if not one of my favorite pale ales in general :D"
"D- Pretty average beer here. Not bad but nothing to write home about."
"The flavor is as the nose suggests with the addition of a little bit of yeasty fruitiness (pears, apples). It starts with floral and grassy hops, warms to reveal its fruitiness and sweet caramel malts, and then becomes more herbal and leafy at the swallow. Bitterness is kept in check, and given the amount of rich malt present, it can seem almost sweetish at times. Hops linger in the mouth for quite some time, backed by traces of malt and a moderate, clinging bitterness. Nicely done!!!"
"Definitely an interesting sample..."
"I was greatly surprised and impressed by this one. I first heard about it last fall and I had looked it up and their own website made it sound like a weak, light beer so I avoided it for the longest time. However, I gave it a shot recently and was very glad I did. It reminded me of a strong, English pale, very similar to a Bass. It had some mild yet distict hops but also a solid malt finish. This may be one of my new favorites from Arcadia!"
"Odd, non-complementary tastes with a ridiculously fizzy/over-carbonated feel. Not good."
"The taste teeters towards the sweeter side, often reminding me of citrus fruit acidity and tingles the tongue a bit, but not enough to cause any positive or negative reaction. It's not a hard beer to drink and could probably bring moderate enjoyment during a session, but it never really challenges itself to be anything but mediocre."
"Very cloudy dark tangerine is loaded with sediment. Big, gushy, cobweb cumulus head of light beige. Nice head, but the sediment worries me a little. Pine needles are big on the nose along with faint sugar cookie malt. Tart, citrusy hop flavors up front. Acidic and lemony. Mild biscuit and sugar cookie malt, but mostly covered up by the metallic citrus. Gushy, overcarbonated mouthfeel. Not very good."
"Wow, definitely an interesting brew. Poured a 12oz bottle into a Smokestack goblet. Poured a hazy amber with a sizable off white head that left a slight lacing down the glass. Aroma is of sweet fruits, like apples with a bit of hops. Taste is almost like a hoppy dry cider. Interesting but not necessarily in a good way. Mouthfeel is a bit heavy for the style, but honestly that's they way I like it. It's a good beer. Not great but solid."
"D: Overall just an average table ale."
"Not bad overall, probably slightly above average. Could use some work in terms of boosting overall flavour but no real complaints anywhere. A typical Pale Ale for the most part."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a slightly hazy, peachy-orange color with a huge, frothy off-white head. Smell is primarily hops, slightly spicy and pale malt is also apparent. Taste is very well balanced, a slightly sweet malty background complemented nicely with a slightly spicy hop finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a frothy carbonation. Overall this is a very drinkable beer and not too shabby either. I would definitely try it again."
"Drank good, could drink 3-4 without getting too bored or excited. Hopheads may find it a bit tame"
"Keeping this theme, the finish seemed to alternate between a bitter and sweet, and although only 5.1% abv, the alcohol seemed to work itself in at the end as well. A very tasty and enjoyable beer."
"A tasty brew. Definitely has an English feel to it. Excellent bready character. A good session beer."
"Pours a cloudy dark yellowish color, nice carbonation, huge head, lots of sticking lacing afterwards. The nose is malty, slightly hoppy, yeasty, and some caramel. The taste is malty, a little bit hoppy, yeasty, with some caramel. This does not remind me of a APA at all really, Medium body. Drinkable, this brewery is disappointing me at this time, definitely not recommended."
"An easy to drink decent APA, I wouldn't seek it out, but wouldn't turn it down either."
"This is the foamiest beer I've ever opened! It didn't surge out of the bottle when I opened it, but the gentlest of pours down the side of a pint glass gave me nothing but a glass of foam and about 3mm worth of beer at the bottom. When things finally settled down I took a wiff and got some very mild hoppiness and some non-hop-generated citrus. Flavor is malty, watery, and unpleasant. Mouthfeel is watery. I can't say I recommend this at all."
"Tasty bottle conditioned brew made in Feb."
"D - Drinkability is very good. I could easily have several of these."
"Overall- A tasty beer but the sweetness limits this to a 2-3 beer max!"
"Drinkability: very average beer here. A bit too sweet for a APA, and the unbalanced flavors makes you want to look for a different beer."
"D - This tasted pretty good despite how it was overly foamy."
"Arcadia has better offerings."
"Pleasing mouthfeel with a nice level of carbonation once the head subsides. Toasty malt sweetness followed by strong hop bitterness and throat warming alcohol. Hops remain on tongue for several minutes."
"Drinkability is not impressive, thanks go to merlin48 for this sample."
"A best-by date bar was on each bottle, but nothing was notched. This is really getting tiresome. I don't know how many micros I have purchased that were oxidized or stale because of thier age. This one was probably infected, yet it was on the shelves selling for almost 10 bucks/six pack. This is becoming a real problem for micros. Either they intentionally ship defective products, or they refuse to give the consumer a freshness date."
"This poured in such a way as to create a huge, light-tan head that looked like an ice cream soda. The head was fluffy, rocky, and experienced good retention throughout. It had a light, slightly malty nose and its color was a slightly cloudy medium-amber. The mouthfeel was light, with a modestly hoppy maltiness predominant on the palate. The finish was more malty than bitter, and less refreshing than I would have preferred."
"Originally reviewed August 10, 2005. 12 Oz Bottle. Nice copper hued color. Dry citrus hoppy aroma. Bland hop and malt flavors. Dry hop palate. Not real interesting, pretty boring. A certain metallic malt edge makes this one particularly unexciting, along with some lack of carbonation and an edge of oxidation."
"Drinkability: Easy drinking, medium weight beer."
"Poured into a pint glass, with a significant white head, about two inches thick. Adeep amber color, slightly cloudy with visible carbonation. The scent of roasted barley is strong, but is soon dominated by floral and citrus aromas. The taste has that barley at the start, it then takes a backseat to a citrus/grapefruit bitterness, that comes right to the front, and is there till the finish. In the mouth it is light to medium bodied, a bit watery towards the end. Drinkablity is very weak, I was expecting stronger hop flavor from the aroma. The nice start of barley was good, it just lacked that hop flavor one would expect from a pale ale."
"Medium bodied with a lot of carbonation. Worth a try."
"The carbonation overwhelms here. Very disappointing."
"Appears a clouded copper amber hue with a few welcomed floaties from the bottle coniditioning forms a nice off white ample head leaves behind full bands of even lacing. Aroma has a dominant grass and floral hop combo with toasted malts brings out a touch of fruitiness, nice English pale with American hops. Taste has a low sweetness malts have a biscuit bready tone with more of the spoken fruit character, but the pronounced hop bitterness caters to the palate with earthy, leafty, and grassy hop flavors. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with more natural creamy carbonatino characteristic of bottle conditioned ales. Drinkability another fine beer from Arcadia could grab a variety of their brews and head down to one of my favorite fishing holes and sip on some Angler's Ale all afternoon."
"Upon first sip, would best describe as an English Pale Ale. The golden / copper, lightly hazed brew shows a moderate (at best) barley malt sweetness and character. Fruits of pears, apples, apricots and papayas show up in the nose and flavor--albeit light. Hopped for bittering and flavor with a light wood / nut flavor. Hops are timid, yet smooth (English?). Weakens considerably into the finsih, saved only by bold carbonation. Finishes clean and lighty fruity and hoppy-dry."
"Finally a pale ale that rivals the quality of a SNPA . This beer has a goldish copper color. As you pour a large off white head appears. You can only pour 2/3 of a bottle into a pilsner glass and wait awhile for the head to subside before pouring the rest of the bottle. Leaves light amount of lacing down the glass. This beer is well balance with taste consistent with agood APA. Sweet malt, floral and pine and nicely hopped, but not as much as other APA's I have had. I will not hesitate in buying this beer again."
"Nothing spectacular, but this has session beer written all over it. Cool label. Makes me want to go out and dunk some flies."
"Arcadia brews some good beer (Imperial Stout is outstanding), but this is the worst of those that I've tried so far. With no real flavor focus and a glaring lack of hops, it isn't anything that I want to drink again. When he should have been back at the brewery working out the kinks in his pale ale recipe, this Angler has 'gone fishin'."
"from the bottle poured like the discription copper with a nice size white head and good lacing. aroma a nice spicey, yeast, hops, caramel with just a nice touch of malts. flavor didnt let me down aleast you could get the spices, caramel and hops wit out searching for them. not to bad of a beer."
"Head is absolutely massive, about 3"" atop about 1"" of beer. The head is a light tan color, the body is a hazy copper color, with lots of visible carbonation bubbles. Taste is bitter, like an ipa should be, but doesn't have the bouquet (floral, pine, or citrus) of many a PA. Is this an infected bottle? It seems like Arcadia would be a big enough brewer to have better quality control, but this beer seems lackluster all around. Not great in any category, Arcadia is very hit and miss (Hit: Porter, Scotch Ale. Miss: Pale Ale, ESB)."
"Great session pint, not a big complex but one that shows in crossing waves over time. Not a beer that takes its age well in the bottle."
"The taste is excellent. Several different fruits are exhibited in both their sweet and sour phases. The hops are noticable as well, and very welcomed. The label says that there are english goldings, fuggles, and williamette hops used to make this brew. I'm not familiar with any of that lingo, but damn this one sure does taste good. The mouthfeel probably stretches to the ranks of medium-bodied, and the drinkability is good as well. I want another one before the first one is even gone. I truly enjoyed this beer, and I'm sure I'll be picking it up again very soon. Cheers!"
"While it's several shades shy of spectacular, I also can't really find fault with it. Very nice, easy drinker, grab one for a mellow session at the ol' fishin' hole."
"Best by May 05 found this lurking in the back of the fridge. Served at 50°F. Pours golden copper with huge rocky white head that falls and leaves thick lace as the surface is capped by a few mm of fine dense head supported by strong beading. Second pour from the bottom half a little murky with some floaties and similar strong head falling and leaving a dense marshmallow size head in a cap of small dense bubbles. Aromas of nutty malt and citrus. English malt and English hops (Goldings) very subdued for a American Pale Ale. Near medium body and thinnish medium mouthfeel. Very drinkable summer session IPA."
"Good beer, but serve cold, of it will bomb out on you."
"Transparent darker amber appearance, head is bright and almost white in color, decently frothy. Laces nicely, rings and lots of fat dots on the glass. Aroma of orange blossoms, hinting at hop influence. Mouthfeel is heftier than light, subdued carbonation gives it some added weight. Overall taste comes out as malty, caramel and some of the butterscotch that influences Arcadia IPA too much (better tolerated here, in my opinion). Hops are nicely evident but definitely Old World UK style -- flowery and bubblegum slick. Drinkable with some refreshing peach qualities going on here and not so jarring as the buttery IPA from the same brewer to my mind."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed 4 1/2"" off-white head over 1"" of cloudy medium amber brew. And that was with a gentle pour. Ok, after much ado to get the bottle in the glass, lots of meringey head still present, and loads of pretty, foamy lace. Aroma is lightly of fruity hops. Taste is hops bitterness over a light pale maltiness. Hmph, after the wait was expecting something more. Mouthfeel is a bit rough, and even after expending all that head, still overcarbonated. Drinkability suffers from same. Too bad this one's flavor was overpowered by the presentation."
"Mouthfeel has a medium body with a slight creamy aspect. Fits the style well and is enjoyable. This brew is definetly easy to drink..however it lacks anything special to bring me back."
"Part of the mixed 12 pack I split with orbitalr0x. The beer pours a peachy orange color with a small coat of head that falls to ring the beer. The nose is orangey and honey sweet with just a hint of citrusy hop. Not all that inspiring. There is a little more hop on the flavor than expeted. Its nice and spicey, slightly citrusy sweet. A hint of sweet maly lurks below. Not bad. The feel is moderate with a nice active carbonation. I enjoy this brew. The flavor is very mild and keeps it easy to drink. A nice beer all around."
"Not bad, just weird. Acts like a Trappist ale, but has the heart of a pale ale. Needs work, IMO."
"Drinkability: Probably more suited for the warmer months but not bad drinking overall. There are better APA's to be had locally out there."
"12 ouncer sampled, label gives a ""purchase before"" month, but what year? Upper label lists the malts and hops used, a nice touch. Pours a medium amber with a washed out orange hue. Nose is soft malt. Bready, middle of the road Brit style balanced ale. Chalky dryness late. Worthy, if unexciting, sessioner."
"Pours deep cloudy golden copper, huge off-white head that leaves some lacing in the glass, flowery aromas. Dry citrus flavors, the hops stand out in the end with a nice clean, dry finish, light to medium body with a crisp super carbonated mouthfeel, pretty average."
"It is easy for me to reach for another one of these, so if you like pale ales, then do give this one a try."
"Poured a deep golden color, slightly hazy. Good 2 finger head and good lace. Smells of moderate floral and citrus with malt overtones. Taste is at first a sweet malt and then the nice bitterness of the hops. A nice balanced beer. Not too hoppy or malty. Just enough of what I like in a good brew. Very drinkable and enjoyable."
"Final Thought: Very impressed with this one, the Midwest Taster is proving to be an excellent mix from this region!"
"A nice light orange color body supports an assertive (maybe a mispour?) white foam head with some unusually large bubbles. Smell manages to be flowery and earthy at the same time. The first thing that strikes me about the taste is the malt profile, it could be because i've been drinking Eisenbahn's Pale Ale in Brasil for the last 3 months which is super flowery and citric and i haven't adjusted to our pale ales yet. But malt is definately what i first notice. A light (I emphasize light) citrus taste rounds out the flavor. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both ok, nothing special and nothing bad. An ok pale ale by my book."
"I'm bumping up the taste a half point after a second pour. I left the bottom half inch in the bottle and with it all the harsh taste."
"Thanks trbeer!"
"From the cask pours a light golden/tan cloudy liquid with a white thick head. The head stayed for a while, the lacing was minimal. Not much smell to this beer, perhaps a slight floral smell. The taste was immediately astringent, sour and grainy. It did have a good floral hoppy finish. There was a little bit of bitterness, but not much. Medium body, smooth and easy to drink. Not a bad beer, it did grow on me as time went by. I do enjoy almost anything on cask, and although this did not blow me away, it was pleasant."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a deep copper color with three fingers of fluffy white head. There is lots and lots of lace left over. The smell is both a little malty and a little hoppy, but overall a little weak. The taste leans a bit on the malty side, lots of bread and caramel flavors. Some yeast present in there as well. A little bit of hops left on the back of thre tongue. The mouthfeel is fairly thick for the style, maybe a touch light. The drinkability is pretty good. A decent pale ale."
"This brew is a light peach colour with a lovely white cap of foam. Aromas are of light bready malts and subtle british hops. The taste is nicely balanced, bready, biscuity, and more. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, and the drinkability is a notch above average. I liked it."
"There are so many pales ales on the market. It seems like every brewer has to have one in the lineup. Arcardia's offering pours out to a light amber in the glass with a decent head. Nose is that of light fruit and hops. The taste is good, but doesn't grab you in the way that many pales do when the hop twang hits on the swallow. A good beer to recommend to those who haven't been exposed to the style."
"Rich orange amber color reminiscent of a newly minted penny. Pours partly cloudy (neither clear nor hazy). A finger's worth of tight, off-white head that is fed by relatively active carbonation. Smell is neither distinctive nor offensive--generically sweet malts with detectable caramel. Surprisingly hoppy up front, but that bitterness gets even stronger shortly after. In between those surges of hops one finds a baseline of caramely malts. An interesting fade to a bubbly finish. Mouthfeel is merely OK--rather watery at the start and a bit clingy when all is said and done. The overly strong hops and lack of integration make this a ho-hum pale ale."
"This is the beer I tell my friends to try who want an introduction to microbrews. There are no real hugely noticeable flavors but more of a withdrawn blend of flavors. The beer is more complex than I thought it would be with a good blend of hops and somewhat of a nutty taste in it. Anglers Ale goes down easy and is an enjoyable beer to have, esp. in these hot summer days."
"Yuck."
"A clear amber body topped by a billowy ivory head. The head lasts and deposits great lace on the glass. The nose is malty and gives off English style hops aromas. The flavor is of a bitter with plenty of malt backbone and hops overlay. Incomplete blending of the flavors creates a sense of disharmony in this beer. Pleasant yet disconcerting. This one would need to be an acquired taste. Long, lingering aftertaste. This reminds me of some Irish cream ales I've tasted that give a lacquer-like sense."
"Decent light body and good carbonation make it pretty drinkable. Nothing offensive about this beer, but I won't go out of my way for this one again."
"Pours a hazy copper - gold, with an amazingly persistent head and quite a bit of suspended particles. Aroma is very light, with some caramel and floral notes, with a touch of orange. Flavor begins with caramel and toasted malts, with some herbal spiciness and finishing bitterness. Not very sweet, and very subtly flavored. Mouthfeel is light and creamy. An very mild pale ale that would be an ok session beer. Nothing spectacular, but decent."
"The perfect golden-amber quaffer when trolling for Walleye or just watching someone else do it on TV. A nose full of dirt and a few curls of lemon skin. Earthy hops linger against an artful toasty backdrop. A precise carbonation makes this beer a session treat. English, indeed!"
"Hazy copper pour with little chunks of yeast forms a thin white head with large bubbles. Moderately carbonated. Starts with a brisk pleasant english hop note which quickly dissolves into a somewhat muddy, subtle wet cardboard mustiness. Leaves the tongue with a mediocre glaze. Not being a big fan of EPA's to begin with, I would rate this as just ""average"". Could definitely benefit from harder water to achieve a brisker mouthfeel."
"Arcadia’ Angler’s Ale: Hmmm.. .. I’ve been disappointed with this mixed twelve pack, the tastes are fairly faithful to their styles, but the flavor is very middle of the road. This style has a fairly under whelming hop, a little malt and a whole lot of nothing. I’ll pass it by next time."
"Part of and Arcadia sampler: Not a very good translation of the style. Pours a clear amber color with a medium off-white head that disappeared quickly. Thin and quick lacing. Aroma was malty and slightly pungent. Flavor is mostly malty with a hops presence and kind of sour aftertaste. This was too mild to be a great EPA in my opinion."
"Pours a nice orange-amber color, modest beige head, the lace pleasant as well, but they vanish quickly, leaving lumpy globs upon the glass. Malt nose dominates, clean and crisp, the start slightly sweet, thin top, finish is charmingly hopped, enchantingly acidic, droughty long lasting aftertaste. As with the Nut Brown, pretty much run of the mill, and drinkable, which is why we buy beer."
"very nutty flavor,had alcohol almost whiskey type undertones to it.Didnt quite expect that was quite hoppy though wich is a good thing"
