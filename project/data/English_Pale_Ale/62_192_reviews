"Looks good but tastes like cardboard and old malt."

"I like it except the aftertaste could be slightly better"
"I was not overly impressed. In fact, it seemed to personify mediocrity in every way..."
""
"I have a feeling this bottle might be quite old, but no way to know."

"Overall, this is a a great english style pale ale, very crisp, great aroma and flavor and mouth presence."

"O - I never by this only because I assumed it would be blah, it's actually very good, strikes a balance between ESB and something more refreshing and crisp. Not a bad shelf beer to keep in the fridge."

"Overall: I'm a sucker for a good traditional pale ale, and this is one. Would recommend to anyone."

"Good interesting take on an English Ale with hops tuned up to the American way, almost an English IPA. If you dig the style, definitely it is worth trying. Great option for American ex-expats of the old world."
""
""
""
"Overall I thoroughly enjoy it. Definitely one of my new favorite pale ale's"
""
"Pretty good at of a bottle but far better out of a snifter glass, in fact remarkably better. All qualities out of the bottle slightly chilled are too sweet and too powerful. The glass seems to free the ale of it's hyper sweet aroma and taste and makes the beer rather enjoyable. I suggest serving it in the mid 40s (F) and eating peanuts or pretzels with the drink"

"O: Biases against crystal malt and English-style pale ales aside, this one does the job well. It's richer than its low ABV would suggest, too. The old adage ""it's not you, it's me"" is appropriate for this one. Still, I can imagine this one being rock-solid on cask."

"Pours a malty amber-light caramel in color. There’s a subdued hop, almost like a stronger “stale-beer” aroma mixed with an off-putting dank/skunky note lingering around. The flavor has a light bitterness that tapers into a harsh, flat taste. It leaves an aftertaste that is not welcome. I liken this flavor to what happens when you overcook and slightly burn something but end up making a dish with it all the same—it’s not quite enough to make you not want it but its not something you’re going to want to have again either. Oh well."
"UPDATE 8/26/14: Hadn't gotten around to re-reviewing this before now.  So much good beer, so little digestive capacity.  Bought another single though and had it tonight with dinner.  Not nearly as crazy about it as I was.  It's good and still fruitier than most Pales and still far less hoppy than many American ones, but I did not find it especially distinguished as ""tasty and wonderful"" or as ""rich"" as before.  Thus downgrading my very high previous rating from 4.55 overall to 3.75.  My reviewing software here changed a few weeks ago, I am no longer able to rate the five appearance/smell/.taste/mouthfeel/overall separately.  So I have to go with this.  I'll probably buy more and re-review again since the difference between first and second tastings was so inexplicably enormous."

"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a vibrant, honey-copper coloring with a thin ring of white head on the surface. Aromas of rich, tangy sweetness, with toffee, honey, and nut making up the bulk of the nose. Hints of roast in there, as well. Flavors are rich and malty, with a roasted overtone. Biscuit backbone, with toffee overlays and a hops bitterness at the end of the palate. Light and smooth in mouth, with a semisweet and bitter aftertaste. Clean finish, with a subtle tangy sweet linger. Very easy to drink, and not overpowering despite some heavier flavor profiles."
""
"O: It's a very well-made English style pale ale; put it on your short list if you're into the style. It tends to get overlooked in these parts, and I'm not sure why given the success of similar beers like Whale's Tale. Maybe the brand just needs a little more visibility? Then again, Geary's does seem to be a pretty polarizing brewery as a whole."

"Amber color with ample head, gorgeous lacing, and good carbonation. The smell is nothing short of the glorious, ale fruitiness they promise in the notes. The yeast and hops combine to give character to classic malty ale flavor. The mouthfeel is a little medicinal and bitter due to some of those West Coast hops added in, but overall this is much closer kindred to a true traditional English style than any West Coast APA I've had. Geary's wins exceptionally high points for knowing exactly what they're doing, then doing it. This is how solid craftsmanship tastes."
""
""
"D: A pretty average style English Pale.. All the right notes here, nothing to stand outish."
"Overall: some of the flavor choices in this beer just don't suit my palate; however, I think it is a good representation of the style and worth trying if you come across it."

"Geary's Pale Ale is a very clear, very sparkling amber ale with a smooth, dense, yellowish cream that leaves outstanding lacing. The aroma is grainy, papery, medicinal and herbal, kind of like an Irish ale. It's pretty light bodied, smooth and lively with a slightly watery finish. I taste light, toasty malt. The herbal hops are lightly bitter. It tastes like it smells with some added fruitiness. It's similar to an Irish Red and makes for an acceptable session ale."

"O: this was a good beer, simple and tasty"

"O: Not my style but a nice change of pace. Happily purchased while vacationing in Maine. Drinks around 5.5% ABV."
""
""
"Great dry hops flavor and pale ale personality, esp. if you're looking for one in the lower-ABV range which I sometimes am. Taste is not as complex as Sierra Nevada Pale Ale (which is an APA, not English) and the aroma is not as rich, but a great American beer nonetheless. Great pic. of a lobster on the label and a great regional beer, the likes of which seem to be dwindling every year."
""
""

"O: The beer is very easy to drink and is quite sessionable, especially given its low alcohol content."
"Overall a nice beer. Good taste and pretty well balanced."
"O: A solidly made, drinkable beer."
""

"Overall: I like this one, but not enough to snag it off a shelf if I ever saw it. English Pale Ales aren't necessarily my favorite, though this one stays true to the style."

"O: This is a very solid English pale ale that is extremely enjoyable any time of the year. Easy to drink, too, which makes this a solid brew all around"
"Good beer, simple and tasty."
"Pours a slightly hazy orange with a huge tan head and lasting lace. The aroma is fruity with hints of caramel. The flavor if of malt sweetness followed by a bold, hop bitterness that lasts through the bitter aftertaste. It's got a medium mouthfeel. Gearys Pale Ale is barely drinkable, the hops just overpower it. Not recommended."
"D - Overall, very easy to kick back with a few of these with friends."
"This is one of my go to pales but don't expect an American pale"
"Cheers!!"
"The feel of this beer is lighter then expected and has a nice drinkable feel. It goes down well and have a good aftertaste that does not linger."
"It pours an orange-hued amber with a light beige fluffy head, with some trailing and spotty lace. An earthy aroma, with caramel malt, slight fruitiness, resinous hops. Edgy bitterness, slightly fruity with some caramel sweetness. As in the aroma, the hops have a resinous bite. Medium to light bodied with spritely effervescence. Fairly good impression of an English Pale ale!"
"12 oz. bottle. Pours copper color, with huge, thick, foamy, white head and lovely carbonation. Aroma of bready malt with some earthy hops in the background. Medium, tangy body, slightly sweet. Taste is bready malt and grape fruit nicely balanced by earthy hops. Long balanced finish. It would not be my first choice of Pale, but still nice brew."
"Clear orange/amber with a light beige cap, good head retention, a bit of spotty lace. Earthy aroma, caramel and malt, slightly fruity, light citrus and grassy hops, quite English in character. Solid bitterness, a bit juicy up front, fruity with some caramel sweetness. Slight herbal hop flavour. Medium to light bodied with moderate carbonation, decent texture. I really liked the flavours in this, more bitterness than an English pale ale but with a lot of the character."
"Hmm, I wonder if this beer would go well with lobster? Oh well, I only have a burger. It'll haveta do. The beer pours a clear amber topped by over a finger of white foam. The nose comprises the starkly simple dichotomy of sweet caramel and flowery hops. The taste is very similar, though the flowers and caramel are now joined by a light orange, complete with bitterness from the peel. The body is fairly light, with a light carbonation and a dry, almost grainy feel. Overall, a nice pale, nothing overtly exciting, but a very drinkable li'l brew."
"DB- The flavors come together pretty well and make this one more like an English Pale Ale, darker (fruit, malt) than I expected. Refreshing and goes down smooth."
"I found this at small rural store in Washington County Maine. I paired it with a spicy chili. It is now my favorite beer to drink with spicy food. It had a great smooth head that stayed for a while. The color was medium amber - good for this type. Excellent hop character. It was really good. I will keep some on hand from now on."
"D- could easily throw a few of these back, but there is nothing distinct enough about this beer to separate it from the rest of the run of the mills APA's. It is definitely better than the crap that the major brewing companies produce, but nothing to brag home about."
"Drink - Once again, I may be drinking and old batch.. but I didn't care for this beer and wouldn't seek it out again."
"I would probably buy one or two if I visited Maine. Don't really like the taste but the great mouthfeel makes it all good."
"Drinkability: Since this is so English in character, it is hard to think of this as an APA, though it may be slightly hoppier in style; decent, if you are a Ringwood fan, which I am not"
"Poured with a massive head almost more of the laundry soap variety. Hazy brown color. Fairly average across the spectrum of smell, taste, mouthfeel. It had a bitter after taste which to me tasted more like cheap hops than by deliberate design. Drinkable but to me this is still just cheap beer."
"A damn good APA. Its nothing ground breaking but whats wrong with that!?"
"Into a pint glass, it poured copper-amber, with three fingers of white, great head retention, and great lacing. Decent visible carbonation. Smelled of pear, apple, and biscuit. The taste was very macintosh apple; trace amounts of pear, and not very dry on the finish. Less carbonation than expected, yet medium-bodied. Decent pale ale, but my expectations were pretty high going into this."
"Easy drinker, and a good unique take on the style."
"Shockingly astringent as it hits the tongue. Plenty of bitterness, but without any real hop flavor other than a touch of leafiness. A hint of nuttiness in the finish. Dry as hell, with not much in the way of sweetness. Some noticeable oxidation. Really an odd beer, not a lot to recommend here."
"Ordered a bottle at the Rattlesnake on Boylston St. Poured into a standard pint glass. Dark rust colored body. Perfect sized white head. Smell was hoppy and spicy. Taste was quite agreeable. There was a good amount of hops, but also a nice malt backbone. An excellent counterbalance to each other. Mouthfeel was smooth, but not watery, and very mild aftertaste. There was not a lot of hop flavor on the palate afterward, which is what I prefer. Drinkability was good, as the flavor, mouthfeel and low abv were all what I was looking for at the time. Paired well with an order of tacos. I would recommend this beer to people that like local APAs."
"D: I have had this when it was fresher and it is a good Pale Ale however I let this sit too long and it was past it's prime."
"Right now, drinkability takes a hit because of that fairly strong chemical smell coming from the beer. I like the way this beer tastes as it is now, it's just a little off; I'll have to try a fresh one because I think this has some pretty nice potential. I took a risk on a dusty bottle and it doesn't seem to have paid off this time, but I'll definitely give this another try in the future because it's got promise."
"Clear copper color. Medium sized beige head that leaves rings and spots of lace. Aroma is nice and subdued, a little toffeish, a little buttery, a little citrusy. Toffeeish malt base lays down the foundation. Pretty sturdy malt base. Hop attributes could use a boost. I get a little lemon citrus and some lingering bitterness, but not as much as an APA should have. Good enough beer, but not a top notch APA."
"Shiny amber in color with a big, happy head that roared to the top of the glass and narrowly missed spilling over. All that I like in an APA was evident in the aroma: emphasis on malt with a yeasty background and just a hint of citrus. Nice taste of crackers and malt up front in the taste, followed by caramel, toffee and some lemons at the finish. More complex than some other APAs, in part because the hops were quietly subdued without being suffocated. Decent body but, as with their London porter, I wanted just a tad more density. Still, I'd have another of these any time. Good score."
"The beer is quite dry, a bit prickly on the mouth, some dry caramel flavors, English malts abound, there are some leafy hops to balance things out, some cracked graininess, and some toffee flavors as well. The dry, slightly bittering cream soda flavors, the saltene feel in the finish, the toffee flavors, and the rather traditional English Pale malts pretty much define this beer. The aftertaste is fairly mild. There isn't tons of carbonation to this beer either. The beer does clean the palate quite nicely. This is an all around decent pale ale."
"D-an okay and drinkable brew but not fantastic. I would drink this beer again."
"I used to drink a lot of this back in the early 90's. Have not seen it in years so I was very happy to see it back in PA. A 12 ounce bottle picked up at the Beer Stop for around $1.75. Poured into my shaker glass. The ale appears a clear rich copper color with at least an inch of dense bone white head. Flavors and aromas are of grassy citrus tinged hops, lemon, toasted grain, a decent amount of caramelized malt, bready and earthy. Above aerge body with ample carbonation for a pale ale. Still quite drinkable as well."
"D: An easy-to-drink APA with good taste and mouthfeel. Nothing overly special, but still a very decent entry and probably my favorite Geary's beer to date."
"Nice session beer."
"Drinkability: slightly above average pale. I could have two or three. This strikes me as being very similar in character to Abita's Restoration Pale Ale."
"D - How can you not try a beer in the Northeast that has a lobster on the label? And its a good pale ale, too."
"Flavor is somewhat lacking, just not a whole lot there. There is some dry bitterness from the hops, but not a whole lot of hop flavor. A bit watered-down tasting. Malts are biscuit- and caramel-like. Definitely some yeast presence thanks to the Ringwood element. Carbonation was good, and mouthfeel was surprisingly slippery and soft. Nevertheless, highly drinkable and light at 4.5 percent."
"Picture perfect pour from 12oz bottle...two-finger white,sticky, head, deep golden amber,..with a floaty or two! Sticky lacing on the glass after each sip. Classic smell of cascade hops. Crisp clean taste, not too overpowering, hint of citrus and hops mixed with, sweet malt and grain,... and a sweet tea aftertaste. Reminds me more of an English Ale with extra carbonation, than a Pale Ale. Slick mouthfeel going down, with a dry finish,....very easy to drink."
"Poured into a mug as a cloudy copper color with just over a finger of creamy head, which evaporated after about a minute or so. Scent is faintly of fresh hops and malts, reminded me somewhat of fresh cut grass. Taste is more malty than hoppy, though you can taste a bit of hops if you search for it. Dry finish with no bitterness or long lasting aftertaste. Very good and drinkable overall."
"One of Maine's first craft beer movements and is still quite popular today. While now and days it'll probably be considered ""unoffensive", when it first came out it was probably quite daring for the area."
"This is a pretty good pale ale; it's a beer I've had many times. It is my default beer to order when I'm out at a bar in Portland and don't see anything too interesting on the draft list, as almost every bar it town serves Geary's pale. I wouldn't go out of my way to obtain any, but if someone brings some to a party, bum a bottle from them. I will also mention that is probably a good beer to give to your non-craft beer drinking friends who are weary of micros."
"D- Get a twelve-pack now to save the trip back to the store if you only got six."
"D= A solid and interesting English pale ale. I could easily session this one, especially if it was a bit fresher."
"D - I can always have a pint of this, but it is not necessarily a session beer because the hoppiness does build on itself after a while."
"High, spritzy carbonation buoys pale malt with mild caramel and hop spice. Peppery, drying aftertaste. Nothing remarkable or suprising but pleasant and highly drinkable. Very New Englandish."
"Poured dark amber with a thin head that dissipated after about 30 seconds. Thought it was a pretty fruity smell for a pale ale, but definitely enticing! Very enjoyable drink: mouthfeel was on the lighter side with medium carbonation and great drinkability. The taste reflected the fruity quaff, but had a great hoppy character as well. If I hadn't gotten it as a single I would definitely grab another one!"
"Drink ability: This beer is very drinkable. I really enjoyed this brew and would buy it again when available."
"Drinkability: I liked this brew, it was clean, adventerous, and came with enough firepower to make this one refreshing. I think if the carbo was lowered a tad, it would be even better. Overall, an enjoyable pale!"
"a long time favorite that you will find in my fridge as often as any other beer. pretty close to the ultimate maine beer experience if you ask me."
"got this one from a friend who had a 6 pack. want really sure what to expect, had never heard of geary's before, but apparently there pretty popular in maine. this one pours a very clear amber orange color with a slightly off white head that goes away real quick. a little bit of lacing. im not crazy about the smell at all. its very buttery up front, a little bit of caramel malt, and a little bit of hops. the butteriness comes through in the taste as well as a little bit of the caramel. some citrus hops at the end. the carbonation really bites the tongue on the finish. pretty light body, light mouthfeel. this is a pretty sessionable beer, i thought there was actually more than 4.5% for some reason. it actually reminds me more of an amber ale than a pale ale. im not crazy about this one, definately would not seek it out in the future, but if i got it for free again id definately take it."
"This is a good, decent, yet simple pale ale. I was surprised as this was a bit hoppier than I expected."
"I think if it was hopped up a little it would be killer with lobster. As it is, it would still probably be pretty damned good with it."
"Overall there's nothing terribly exciting about this beer, but it does what it does well. Worth a shot."
"It is typically a bit less expensive than other pale ales, so that makes it a little easier justifying picking one and having it in the fridge."
"Medium body, oily and slick. Bitter in the finish. Not bad, just above average."
"D: Very drinkable as it should be. The nice crisp drink definitely helps. Not overly interesting, though, and maybe a bit off."
"D- Drinkable but probably not something I would seek out. Overall a sort of bland brew."
"Good session ale."
"Taste is of slightly sweet malts and offers a mildly bitter flavor. At times a sweet yet smoky roasted barley flavor is dominant, though this diminishes as the carbonation lessens. Avg. feel and drink. Notably, the initial effervescence seems to be excessive carbonation that escapes prematurely, yielding a lot of variation through the pint and finishing somewhat flat."
"D- A very drinkable brew, and one which goes particulaly well with seafood (or is that lobster on the label leading me)"
"D: It was a crisp and light ale that goes well with seafood and has a modest ABV that can carry it long into a session."
"Drinkability- A very good APA, one of the best of its kind."
"Very dry beer with a low level hops which interestingly creates a decent balance. Again, the earthiness comes through on the palate. Standard body for the style. Very dry."
"The taset is leafy and earthy with fruit, hints of citrus and pine, light sweetness with spicey-bitter finish and some toast."
"d- overall a great beer in my humble opinion. its full of flavor yet nothing overwhelming. i keep finding myself coming back to the idea of ""balance"" and i feel it describes it well. great feel and taste but nothing over bearing that would allow only a few. could certainly drink these all night."
"Worth a try..."
"M/D - Medium bodied and a little on the creamy side. Tastes more like an English pale ale to me."
"A safe, solid beer. If more interesting styles are available at the local watering hole, they are in line ahead of this one. But a safe mid-road bet just the same -- try one!"
"Notes: So what if this does not blow your mind! Appreciate the good Ale. Decent balance with a low ABV."
"D: Moderately average drinkability, nothing that really made me look forward to the next sip."
"From the bottle this one pours a clear orange-copper color with a whispy white head and fair lacing. I detect a leafy, medicinal, almost floral-hops and grass aroma. The flavor is bitter hops with a peppery tingle on the tongue. Not very complex, a little harsh perhaps. Fairly thin with a sort of charcoal quality at the back. Drinkable but a bit tough on the taste buds, despite the hint of some caramel sweetness. The peppery bitterness dominates. An interesting pale ale option. Not bad but I think I prefer this one on tap."
"D - Overall this is a bit dark and tangy for a pale, which, for me, is a nice change of pace. A little bitter, or tangy, maybe, though it doesn't seem too overpowering. Would need to have another one or two to see how it weighs on me. A pretty good Pale."
"Overall I thought that this was a mediocre beer, not bad, but not great either."
"Very smooth with a pleasant dry finish. I think this is a great example of a pale ale with the yeast flavors coming through in a good way."
"A good beer, I prefer it over most other pale ales."
"Pours a clear slightly lighter brown. Nose is a bit wood like with a slight caramel character. Flavor is smooth, but doesnt really carry a strong profile. There are bark tones to it and a mild mature wood sweetness to it, but it never really kicks you in the mouth. This is just one of those mature beers. Nothing showy. Not trying to be outlandish. It is what it is. Feel is smooth on the liquid with a decent carbonation. Highly drinkable. Just an overall good beer. Well made and smooth."
"D: Super drinkable session beer. The only thing I don't like is how much it costs in NY. This beer cost as much as the lobster did in Maine. While I enjoy it I have to be feeling nostalgic to drop $11 for a six pack of this."
"A solid, but unremarkable beer. A good one for a session."
"D: Unique and distinct but the sharpness and dryness would make it difficult to enjoy a large number of these."
"Pours a copper-orange color with a thin head. Aroma is malt, with some bittering hop in the background. The flavor is malty, with a bit of breadiness coming out as the beer warms. Only slight citrus hops. Theres lingering malt after taste. A nice, easy to drink English-style Pale Ale."
"The roast on the malt was a bit strong for a pale ale, but good. There was a fruity taste to it and a good bitterness that faded quickly. This is a very drinkable beer, but I wouldn't ever put it in a list of my favorites. This pale is slightly better than average."
"12oz bottle (thanks Dad). Pours a miedium gold. Not much aroma. Flavour is a bit weak throughout. I think this is what brewers refer to as ""crisp"". The beer gets slightly better as it warms, but it remains unexciting. Disappointing, even as an English pale ale."
"Pours an amber color with a nice thick head. Aroma is strong and malty with some hops showing through. Taste is very strong, biscuity and leaves a nice, dry aftertaste. It reminds me more of an English Pale Ale though, due to the way it finishes and the body. It's still a smooth and very drinkable representation of this style."
"Feels thick and ""yeasty."" Dry and a tiny bit bubbly. Creamy and substantial. It's a nutty pale, almost a brown, except in color. A roasted pale."
"Michael Jackson listed this in his 500 Great Beers guide....Im thinking he must have added this one toward the end. Not much to this one."
"D-This is kind of blah. There are some off flavours though it isnt a terrible beer by any means. there are so many better pale ales out there that there isn't enough reason for me to buy this one again. I can see how some people may like this one but it really doesnt do it for me."
"I'm underwhelmed by this one. Mostly I'm disappointed by the lack of any hop profile whatsoever. There are much better Pale Ale's out there."
"This one is slightly more flavorful and interesting than your color-by-numbers APA, with a steady balance between the floral and fruity hops and the malt backbone. Mouthfeel is medium and crisp. If you see it somewhere, give it a shot; APA fans won't be disappointed."
"Overall: This is decent for a pale ale. I wish it were a bit more hoppy. This would be a nice transition beer for the BMC drinkers. It's unlikely I'll buy this again."
"Pours a light amber color with a white head that dissipated to a nice white ring. Pleasant aromas of mild citrus hops. Taste is of fresh and mildy earthy hops, citrus, and a bit of peppery spice. Also to be found is a light maltiness and faint buttery quality. Overall a very solid and drinkable anytime APA."
"D: Tasty, goes down easy, not very filling, definitely seems to lean toward the English style of pale ales and taste very similar to their Winter Ale, I could drink this beer for a little while but I might look for something with a little more flavor and a harder kick after a few."
"I could ""pound"" these all night... I'm a bad boy!"
"I love the toasted flavor! my favorite ""American Pale Ale"" yet. Mouthfeel is ultra thick and fully, and I've tried most of the Geary's line in the last month, and surprisingly full mouth feel (on par with and as here, at times in defiance of style) is a characteristic of their brews. Outstanding - the brewer is truly a 'master.' More carbonation that I'd like, but this is right on for style, not flat. Drinkability wise, this, like the other Geary's beers I've tasted, are all around winners. Drinkable! This is outstanding - finally a true pale ale with some real character (other than hops). And so far Geary's has helped me reconsider my previous aversion for both pale and strong ales, making versions of both that I enjoy."
"A full flavored beer that is not heavy. Would go great with the lobster on the label!"
"A little to sweet for my taste but I'm sure it has a lot to offer for others."
"This is certainly more of an English Pale Ale, with an East Coast influence. On the mark for the taste, but the feel diminishes drinkability. Modest abv makes it a candidate for a ""session", though I don't know how long it would hold my interest."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Active and pleasing in the mouth, without being overly carbonated. I would have liked more of hop bite, however this beer certainly has its place. Glad to have tried it."
"Geary's Pale Ale is anything but a typical version for brewers who ply their trade on this side of the Atlantic. It's a good one though, and would make a wonderful session ale as long as one has a high tolerance for bubbles. Thanks to Maine's own, jrdegriselles, for the bottle."
"I like a a hoppy beer but this one just didn't cut it for me."
"Taste is kind of blah; fairly strong bitterness and some sour hop flavor but almost no malts evident. Mouthfeel is kind of thin and watery. It's drinkable but without much enthusiasm. There are lots of better pale ales available."
" The drinkability is ok but not a big winner. I like some thing different. MK"
"peace...bc"
"D: Nothing offensive, but there's nothing here that suggests that this is a beer that I should drink again."
"I'm generally a fan of ringwood beers, and this is no exception. I was a little worried as the bottle was a touch dusty, but I think the beer pulled through. Looked good and smelled of hops with a touch of ringwood. Tastes of grapefruit and orange peel. The ringwood is there and nicely balanced. The mouthfeel is a touch weak, especially for an APA (I'd call it an English Pale Ale). Not an amazing beer, but definately session worthy."
"this is not an APA. their website even says so. but it's good (no 4.5s but good session brew)"
"Profound malt character in the taste; a little bit nutty, a bit of caramel and biscuit. Actually strikes me as similar to Anchor Steam in malt character. Sweetness is briskly washed away by a hop tingle and carbonation. Balanced, refreshing, tasty, seems much more English to me than American. Solid medium body, mellow carbonation, really drinkable and quenching for how competent it is. Recommended."
"poured amber with a big fluffy light tan head that fairly quickly dissipated with no lacing. Mostly malt on the nose with just a whiff of hops. A little weak tasting at first, but with a nice but restrained hop aftertaste. Fairly nice flavor profile- dry, nicely balanced hops and malt. Tastes more like an ESB than an American pale ale. The beer is not quite as crisp as I would like and it does have a little bit of a soapy mouthfeel midpalate and then finishes dryer and slightly astringent. Overall not bad, could be a session beer with some english cheese and crackers."
"Overall a nice and maltier than most APA. Very quaffable."
"Pours a pale coppers, with a light head. I smell hops and a bit of estery ringwood. Taste is bitter and hoppy, not a lot of hop flavor, but a good amount of bitterness. It's backed up by a light buttery ringwood flavor and a bit of caramel malt. The beer is surprisingly thin, not bad, just not as full as I would expect."
"This was a clear orange color with a small head but some nice lacing. It had a fresh grain, sweet aroma. The taste was malty with some caramel. Hops showed up later. A nice, respectable beer. I drink this or the HSA as my everyday beers. Try it, you'll like it."
"mouthfeel is medium but nice and crisp. drinkability is ok. nice malty pale ale."
" Overall, quite impressive for my first Geary's. I'd consider a six pack of this time well spent."
"Moderate to full mouth with no residuals. A solid session beer for sure."
"eh, it's a pale ale, but nothing spectacular, there are much better ones to spend your money on. if the brewery was closer to where i live i might be more interested in trying it again really fresh (not saying freshness was an issue here)."
"Geary's flagship product, lets see how it turns out. Pours a perfect amber color and an impressive half inch white head: a very good looking beer. Nose was of doughy biscuits, light fruit and a marvelous floral bouquet to top it off. The taste was rather dry, with the biscuit flavors accompanied by a nice hoppiness and some slight juice tastes pulling through at the end. Mouthfeel was damn near perfect in its medium body. This is also a beer that is very easy to drink...It seems like an ideal candidate for even some beer drinkers not accustomed to heavier hop loads and new tastes. I really enjoyed this Pale Ale. With the alcohol being relatively low and the quality of the taste being so high, I have to say that this is one of the better, if not best Pale Ales that I have sampled in months past."
"The aroma is similar to wet straw and grassy. There is not much in the way of hoppiness. The taste is mildly hoppy and has a very carbonated taste. There is a dry flavor with slight bitterness and some citrus. This one is a weak attempt at a pale ale, imo."
"Overall- I am hoping that this is a skunked bottle. It is undrinkable. down the drain you go. Tastes like a Meister Brau in a can!"
"Pours a golden-amber (Im tempted to say orange-ish) color. The head is white an brilliant, but of average quality and duration. The aroma is a extremely citrusylike sticking grapefruit slices up your nostrils. Theres a little malt and ester play going on behind the scenes, but the smell is all about the hops. The taste has a slight caramel bent to it, and is notably dry and abrupt. Medium fullness of body, but the dryness and citric quality dont seem to match the hops. It just doesnt come together very well. Finish is hoppy and dry. Certainly, this is an American style pale ale, but unfortunately, its an average one."
"A very clear dark amber color,but the head is smallish,one finger.This has a slight spice aroma,but not much.This tastes a little light.For a pale ale this isn't very hoppy.Geary's has made a pale ale thats dry,but with not much flavor.I don't think I would buy this again,it's OK,but there are so many betterpale ales on the market."
"Certainly a good pale ale, one that I could have a few of. I think it's more English than American in overall character. I think I prefer the other 3 Geary's beers that I've had (HSA, London Porter, Autumn) over this one though."
"Reviewed this earlier this summer and was wondering if it was just a fluke that I liked it so much on that particular night but upon picking up a sixer and trying it from the bottle this is just a world class beer, and I'm baffled once again that it gets average reviews. It may be slightly better on tap, but it's no slouch from the bottle either. I just love the hopping of this brew. It's perfect. Nice dusty, spicy, herbal boquet of hops on top of a nice pale malt profile. Excellent dry mouthfeel and this beer is so nice to drink. I've sort of become addicted to it. Everytime I got into the store I end up debating whether to get the Geary's or something I haven't had recently, and this beer usually wins it out. And that's strange because I never usually drink a lot of the same beer over and over. I definately urge people to go out and try this again with an open mind, because I think it's one of the best examples of a well made beer that I've come across."
"A pretty Average APA with slightly above average taste and drinkability. Other than that it's typical. Nothing special to go back to. Pretty standard for an American micro brewery. Similar to Sarnac ."
"Not a very popular brand in MA, but nonetheless quite good. Light pale in apperence with a pretty healthy head that maintained its retention and lacing to the bottle of the glass. This beer was heavily spiced with a mild hop aftertaste, a good dinner beer. This is a pretty light APA it could almost be and EPA. Out of all the beers I have discovered this summer, this is by far the most consumable. Good to go!!!"
"Drinkability is that this is drinkable. Pretty mediocre beer, but as mentioned above, you go with what you got. And in the wilderness, local micros will always prevail in my selection versus the mass alternative."
"Nicely done beer. I am not a big PA fan (not hoppy enough), but this a quality interpretation that I find very enjoyable."
"Nice sweet taste, the caramel malts come through with the hops lingering. Very smoothe and easy to drink. Has a small bite to it, but not harsh at all. Overall a very good, yet different Pale Ale."
"Pours a clear copper color with a light coating of head over top. The nose is big on spicey and peppery hop. Not a lot of sweet caramel, but its there in the back. The flavor is rather dull as well. Just a light caramel malt with a slight orangey and pepperyness hanging over it. I'd like a little more hop in there. The feel is a light moderate with a moderate carbonation. Just an okay beer. I don't think I would visit it again."
"Pours an amber color with a small head that falls fast and doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma is mostly comprised of caramel with hints of diacetyl, but I don't get much in the hop category. The flavor is very similar to the aroma - caramel and diacetyl. No hops there. Nothing noticeable at least. Body is light to moderate and the drinkability is ok. Perhaps this is an old bottle, but it's definately missing something."
"very thick creamy foam head dwindled to 2 cm. stubborn head; lacing that clings slowly slides down side of glass. pale faded golden color with a mix of amber and orange hues or an ever-so-light reddish beige. raw hops nose with a tiny bit of butter and graininess with slight musty, earthy tones. caramel and maltiness at first taste with a complimenting hint of sweet citrus lay on the tongue before being shot through with hops bitterness. hops fade fast to leave a lingering sweet graininess. luscious light mouthfeel with conservative carbonation avoids becoming too thin. easy to drink and delicious but admittedly hoppy (as a pale ale oughta be). love 'em."
"Pours a four-fingered cream head that fades quickly leaving some lace. Clear amber color. Strong hoppy nose. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Starts hoppy, finishes hoppy, bitter aftertaste - typical pale. $1.70 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, Ma."
"Pours a medium shade of amber, hazt, minimal head is white, not , much lacing left behind. Nose is caramel, yeast and flowery. Biscuity malts up front, balanced by soft and mellow hops. Balanced and highly drinkable pale. Fine sessioner. Another tasty creation from Geary."
"Pours a deep golden/light amber color with a pillowy off-white head. Moderate lacing left behind. Lightly toasty malt profile with some faint cirtus rind fruity esters and a light hopping. moderate diacetyl levels. Very crisp and non-descript in flavor, some light malty notes and a slightly bitter finish. Water content has a slight mineral taste that is consisent with a good English-style pale ale. Lightly grassy, vegetal finish. A decent interpretation of an English-style pale ale. Extremely drinkable."
"Not quite clear, dull orange-copper with a finger of guazey, off-white head. Smell is quite citrusy: grapefruit and lemon hops. Light biscuit malt and a faint trace of gunmetal. Tart, acidic grapefruit hop assault up front. Refreshing and appetizing. Thin malt backbone that flashes shortbread and sweet biscuits. Not bad. Light-medium bodied, with nice refreshing carbonation. Nice session pale ale."
"This is an easy drinking APA from Geary's. Grainy dryness and crisp with a buttery sweet mouthfeel. Toasted malts and a sour hop punch on the finish."
"Overall: nicely malty session brew with enough hop character to keep from overmalting my tongue. I definitely wouldn't mind having another one."
"Hazy honey colored with a firm orangey-beige head that rises up a half inch high and then settles down low, but leaves a racing stripe all around the inside of the glass just above the beer. Aroma is malty and biscuity, with a little bit of fruit. Flavor is also malty, light and on the sweet side, with pear and cinnamon. Understated hop profile, barely there, but an orange peel bitter lingers. Decent selection, but fairly average."
"A standard, but very well made and solid pale ale. Pours a light golden hue with a tiny white head that dissipates quickly. The aroma is of a light citrusy hoppy nature. The taste is of light hops balanced nicely by a malt background. I taste some sort of fruity presence at the finish. The aftertaste is mildly bitter. This is a very nice pale ale, but lacks depth and complexity. This is probably more a style trait than a specific trait of this beer. My only complaint is that the carbonation level seems a bit on the high side."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Pours out to be a nice light amber color with a huge white head. Tastes of both malts and hops, but not good malts or good hops. The flavor profile has good balance, but it isn't balancing anything good so that point is moot. I can not quite pinpoint why I'm not into this brew, but I am certainly not into this brew and I will not recommend it to anyone. Maine beer is overrated as a rule anyway. Not worth your time."
"After a thin pour, a negligible head vaporizes to become a little ring around edge of beer, despite a few streaming bubbles. Beer is translucent bronze in color and very clear, with highlights that are somewhat metallic in reflectivity. Detecting an aroma is quite a struggle, but eventually I find an intitial biscuits-and-toothpaste (!) combination that's not all that pleasant... and some bitter orange rind with warmth. No real nosefeel to speak of. Flavor is mostly a mellow bitterness with a rugged acridity in the aftertaste, with suggestions of sourdough bread and an indistinct, somewhat citric fruitiness. On the plus side, the bitterness is full-bodied rather than piquant, which aids the drinkability. Mouthfeel is sufficiently slick for a session beer, but is also, frankly, boring. Above average but not memorable."
"A clean amber ale with not much of an off white head that disappears quickly. The aroma had a light malty sweetness about it but not much else. The taste started out with a easy sweet maltyness and finished with a smooth hop finish. Not a bad ale for having more than one."
"Poured a faint copper color with a compact think sticky head. A nice pale ale sittin out by the fire. Abit of hops and a bit of malt, blending well together. A bit of a butery taste was present. A good beer, but not my favorite of the style or from them."
"Drinkability  This was a nice, refreshing Pale Ale that one would welcome on a hot summer day."
"Very drinkable. A pale that should appeal to a lot of palates."
"Really this is just a classic New England Pale Ale (if such a thing exists). A mix of English ale, american hoppyness and just that classic new england water taste. A great session beer."
"Good drinkability for a fairly non-exciting brew."
"The mouthfeel was smooth and the body was medium. Nice carbonation levels. Relatively clean finish and little aftertaste. Very drinkable and can be a session beer."
"The beer pours a slightly reddish gold color with a thin white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a good scent of pale malts and aroma hops. It has a bit of sweet maltiness to it; probably some light crystal malts added. The taste is decent. It has a good balance between pale and light crystal malts along with some mild flavoring hops. It is slightly bitter. The mouthfeel is good. It is a low/medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This beer is quite enjoyable and highly drinkable."
"A fine pale ale, and a rarity around here that I was genuinely pleased to try, Certainly, if I can find other Geary's products, I'll be glad to try those as well!"
"Had heard alot about this beer and gave it a try while in Portland,mildlydissapointed.Pours a nice medium golden color with a lighter head that does leave some decent lacing,aroma is malty and slightly metallic.Taste seema little dry for me not quite enough malty-sweetness there is a hoppiness in the finish but not enough sweetness for my liking."
"While in my opinion not a complex flavored pale ale , Gearys holds its own as a quality craft brew."
"An excellent pale ale, brewed to the english style. Wonderfully balanced and flavorful. Definitely a session ale for any occasion."
"Taste is bitter and hoppy. Hints of sour apple. Lightly malty with hints of lemon as well. Medium bodied with light hoppy aftertaste. Very smooth and drinkable but flavorful as well. Very well balanced. The best pale ale brewed in Maine and my local go-to brew. Goes anywhere with anything."
"Light bronze hue with a slight murk. Thin, frothy, pitted head manages sparse foam trails. The aroma is a soft melange of floral hops with a citrusy tinge along with mild, bready pale malt and light lovibond caramel sweetness. Faint ripe pear esters add a green, fruity presence. Balanced, understated aroma. Ashen caramel malt initially in flavor is offset by a crisp, cleansing hop bitterness which develops into a woody, lightly earthy hop flavor. Subdued diacetyl emerges mid palate and complements the balmy, toffeeish malt backbone. Light in overall body, but pleasantly dextrinous and lightly viscous in mouthfeel. Finishes with an agreeable surge of savory, cracked grain laden salted biscuit, which leaves the palate parched and ready for more. A no frills, well rounded, superbly drinkable brew that treads the wide boundary between American and English pales. Geary's Pale would be a staple brew in the fridge for easy quaffing... if I lived in Maine. Thanks to Bennybrew for reuniting me with the first Maine brew I ever had. That was 5 years ago in Limestone, ME."
"Nice cloudy coppery look, very little head with some slight lacing. Decent hoppy aroma that held up in the taste which had a pleasant bitterness to it. Mouthfeel wasn't that balanced, though and aftertaste was not that great. Average drinkability. Not as good as their Hampshire Ale."
"This beer had a nice copper color to it with no head and little lace. It was pretty balanced, but leaning a bit to the bitter side. Hops were evident in the smell and in the taste. It went down pretty well, but to me was an average pale ale. Not a bad thing though, I liked this beer and would have it again."
"Bright, amber hue, a thin head, no lacing noted. Some malty and a touch of orange peel on the nose. Up front, malts and some caramel flavors, delicate citrus noted throughout the body, hops tough to detect. Medium bodied, creamy and light toasty finish. Minimal IBUs leave me wondering where are the hops?"
"I liked it, and would buy more; however, I don't feel that I would have more than one of these per night, hence my relatively low drinkability rating."
"Less than average appearance when poured.A clear amber in color.Medium bodied with a fairly thick malt texture.Crisp mouthfeel that wasnt overly carbonated.Lingering bitterness and more body than the pale ale im used too.It might be just a Maine thing with the malty beers.Overall average,but well balanced with a fairly good drinkability rate."
"Pours a bright crystal clear amber with some fine carbonation streams, topped by a hearty foamy slighty off-white head. Nose is biscuits and floral and herbal hops and a little bite of apple. Taste is lead by a nice caramelly body, with an accompaniment of Euro-hops across the top. Finishes dry with a little lingering hop tang. Smooth drinking, with enough carbonation to be refreshing. A very easy drinking, very enjoyable pale ale, bridging both American and British styles. An old timer that should not be neglected."
"This is a beer I would have probably never tried if not for BA. It's pretty hard to find in my area. Pours a very clear copper color with a small bubbly head. It's got a very american like hoppy scent, on the citrousy side. The taste is very grainy with a slight citrousy aftertaste. Very smooth mouthfeel, not as crisp & hoppy in taste as the aroma suggests, but a good pale ale. This seems to be what a pale ale should taste like, with Sierra Nevada being more on the IPA side of things. Glad I tried this one...I imagine on tap it would be great!"
"Definitive amber color with fairly long-lasting big bubbled head on draft. High marks for drinkability the result of wonderful hops/malt balance. Neither overtake each other. Nothing is out of place. Very late hoppy dryness with momentary acidity results in mouthfeel and flavor finish that (don't laugh, I think this is a good thing) holds me off on brushing my teeth. The aftertaste is that good."
"The pour a unclouded amber color, the head is modest in size, bubbly in structure, and a very light tan in color with the lace a thin sheet upon the glass. Malt dominated is the nose, citrus crisp and fresh, the start is malt laden, slightly sweet, the top slender in its feel to the palate. Finish has a persistent acidic bite, the hops moderate in their presence and spiciness, quite dry aftertaste and a good beer to have on hand for the hot summer days just around the corner."
"This pale ale poured a nice, clear, amber color with creamy, white foam, and some nice small bubbling from the bottom of the glass. The smell was modest but good: citrus, malt, bisuity, and a bit of floral hops. The taste was first hops (floral and bitter) and then malt and a bit of citrus. The flavors were nicely balanced. The mouthfeel was smooth, crisp, and clean, with a bit of lingering hop flavors. The body was medium, and the carbonation was modest. The was a very nice and drinkable ale. Very smooth and refreshing."
"This is a good pale ale and would drink this any Ol' time."
"F."
"I am very happy I have finally tried Geary's Pale Ale. Pours out to a nice amber-brown in the glass with a decent head. Aroma is that of biscuit and a light floral smell. Taste is that of a very light grapefruit, mixed with malt and caramel. Not as hoppy as I thought it would be (although my companions at the bar thought it was, but they are new to hops), but it is extremely (forgive me) ""smooth"". A session pale if there ever was one."
"For me an aroma adds so much to a brew and Geary's Pale Ale is a perfect example of that. A big citrus cascade nose upfront with a sweet nutty malt aroma backing it up delivers enjoyment before you even taste it. The enjoyment continues with this clear bronze brew when the flavors of sweet bread and date fade to a light bitterness. Maine proves again they can brew great beer with this fantastic pale ale."
"Well, it's been great getting into this community of beer fanatics, and since I have been here there is one beer that has been suggested by one man over and over again.Yep, it's Geary's Pale Ale, and right now everything else can wait, because this beer is my 100th review. This will be my first Maine beer, and this review is for JohnnyP and the rest of BAs from throughout New England. Appearance, well hey there's a lobster on the bottle it has to be from Maine!!! Pours a copper amber tone with an off white cream colored head. Is leaving a nice thin lace down the sides of my pint glass. The aroma is filled with sweet malt and a good amount of hop aroma, very pleasant aroma here. There is a nut flavor in the first sip that's complemented with a balanced blend of malts and hops, pretty good all around brew. The mouthfeel is medium to light in body, but this beer has such a great taste there doesn't need to be any fireworks in the mouthfeel. Very drinkable, could be a go to session brew if it was widely available down my way, but I now see why JohnnyP holds this beer in a special place in his heart. Gets this West Virginian's seal of approval, if you haven't tried a beer from Maine here's a place to start."
"All in all not a bad beer. Poured copper with a minimal head. There was some sediment in mine, which I'm not sure if it was supposed to be there. No date on the bottle, so I'm not sure if it's past date. Floral, hoppy aroma with a touch of peach. Taste is pretty much the same. Hoppy, but not too hoppy, with peach notes. Seems to be a dry malt base. Light bodied. I'd definitely drink this one again, but I don't know that I'd seek it out as a permanent fixture in my fridge."
"pours a nice orange colour with a strong head that dissolves fairly quickly yet never completely dissapears. caramel is apparent in smell and taste and is underscored by fruit flavouring and hints of saltiness. a bit different for a pale ale but it's one of my favourite new england brews and i make sure i always grab some when i can."
"This beer can be summed up in one word: ""uneventful"". Even on tap, it had no real hops or malts that jumped out. It did not even have that ""pale"" taste that I look for in this style. It was just there, bland. It went down easy, due to the fact it had no taste. This should be called ""Geary's Ultra"""
"Sudsy bite on the tongue. Suds bite the whole way through, actually. Peach notes return in the midtaste with peach-pit bitterness in tow. Finish is fairly non-descript, save for the--you guessed it--peaches."
"Expected citrus hop aroma from this amber beer. Caramel malt flavor that is almost a bit nutty. Medium body and appropriate carbonation. Slight metallic and mineral flavors compliment bitterness instead of distract you. Easy enjoyable drinking, but nothing spectacular."
"Here in Portland, Maine where Geary's is made I have a hard time finding a better beer for the price (now $10.99 a twelve) unless it's the Geary's Hampshire Special Ale when available."
"Deep dark copper color, much darker than I expected.  Head was tan/beige, full of rich hop bubbles. Nice floral/hoppy aromas, no sourness noticed. Taste was balanced and better than I expected. Nice sweet malty presence, lots of florals, citrus and hop goodness. Thirst quenching goodness, crisp dry finish. A very good Pale Ale. Better than Bass and lots of others. Cool label too. I had this with a lobster dinner in Maine and it was perfect !"
"Pours a nice copper color, with a decent head that dies pretty quick. On the nose there is a slight fruitiness, herbs, and herb aromas. The same is found on the palate, slight fruitiness, herbs, slightly sweet, light malt, and a nice bitterness. Finish is bitter and slightly sour. Overall, a good Pale ale..."
"[Note:  Thanks to my Dad for bringing back this brew from a trip to Maine!]"
"Nectar of the gods as far as I'm concerned. Perfect off white head, clear light amber color, sweet malty caramel aroma with hint of fruit. This is all a pale ale can be: crisp refreshing attack, almost lemony, followed by bittersweet malt middle, closing to a hoppy, but well balanced finish. Eat your heart out, Bass. A lower score on drinkability because the first sip usually tastes the best. Nicely salty, VERY New England, a true seaside beer, goes great with seafood (hint: take a look at the label). I love malts and this has plenty -- PLUS an incredible hop element to twist it to just the right dynamic. Bliss."
"You either like Geary's, or you don't. I happen to like this brew, overall. It's fairly traditional, a slice of Ringwood brewing history in New England and a good drink."
"Pours a nice pale copper color with a nice head that never sinks completely.  Smell is earthy/fruity hops and slight malt.  The flavor starts off with some subtle hopping that grows into a nice full flavored hop profile.  You can just slightly taste the cascades behind the lighter english style hopping.  There is a nice malt balance to this beer, but not so much that it takes away from the hops.  Clean and smooth in the mouth and nicely drinkable.  This is a fine example of an english tyle pale ale with a touch of american influence.  Great session brew or for a few while working the grill."
"Notes: A wonderful English style pale ale with a New England twist. Gets even better when at cellar temperature."
"A good everyday brew, nothing extrodinary. An average session brew or introductory pale ale. There's a lot of other beers I'd choose first."
"Like JonnyP, this was one of my first micros back in the summer of '87 on a trip to Portland.  A sentimental favorite that got me hooked on the dry Ringwood style beers."
