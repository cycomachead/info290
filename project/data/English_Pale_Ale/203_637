One finger of head ,even after a vigorous pour, suggests low carbonation typical of imitation cask ale; head stuck around throughout the experience, however. On the nose I get mostly caramel malts, a touch of bready malts and yeast, some fruit esters, and perhaps a touch of English hops, just to tie everything together. On the palate i get a rich , yet balanced and not overly dense, caramel flavor, coupled with some slight fruity esters. Toffee and a touch of butterscotch are also there. Bitterness is well managed and makes the beer very quaffable. This could be easy to drink many of. I personally found it subtle, yet refreshing. It embodies many of the qualities that make a good bitter, yet in a more subtle, drinker friendly manner","Haydn-Juby","Jan 10, 2015"

3.5,1.7,,,,,,"such a different beer (and far superior) from the nitro tap than it is from the bottle. this is often thin and skunky in its clear glass, but its rich and frothy and malty in that nutty but not too sweet way from the nitro tap. the infusion of the nitro gas helps its feel too, creamy and puffy on the palate with a lasting white head and ring lacing as it sips down. plenty of bittering hops, characteristic more of an esb type than an english pale to me, but it sort of traverses style norms in a number of respects. i like the almost almond flavored malt on the front end, and that it stays pretty light throughout. enough hops to balance it, but remain drinkable. i know this one is a classic overseas that has been largely under appreciated by the north american crowd, but i think thats a little unfair, and that that the clear glass hasnt done it any favors. overall a beer that demands a time and a place, but when those to occur, its delicious.","StonedTrippin","Sep 04, 2014"

3.88,12.8,4,3.5,4,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 11/30/2013. Pours crystal clear reddish copper color with a 1 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, toast, brown bread, plum, apple, honey, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, yeast ester, and earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, toast, brown bread, plum, apple, nuttiness, light roast, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Light earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, brown bread, nuttiness, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and robustness of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Very clean in flavor as well. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth and fairly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with no warming present after the finish as expected of 5%. Overall this is a very nice English pale ale! All around good balance and robustness of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Aug 06, 2014"

I have always thought it to be a fine English pale/bitter with such a lovely aroma. The creamy, buttery body and malt-hop balance always impressed me. On some level, I do object to so many English ales being overlooked in the U.S. That may be due to lack of freshness, but with some of the sturdier, higher alcohol level bitters, that should not be as much of an issue. Perhaps English pales and bitters are just not en vogue right now like IPA's and strong stouts.","Wobbly","Oct 04, 2013"

The aroma is pretty mild, with slight hints of dark fruit and bread. The taste comes through, though, with more developed flavors similar to the aroma with a nice earthy hops character in addition. It's not a huge flavor, but it works well. The body is a little lighter, but mirrors the flavor profile. It's not the most outstanding English Pale, but a good one all the same.","delta490","Sep 22, 2013"

It looks like buttercream frosting it is so smooth. The body of the beer is a bright, crystal clear, vibrant ruby-orange coloring. Aromas are rich and buttery toffee sweetness, with a slight tang and a biscuit backbone. Flavors are smooth and somewhat fruity, with berry and cherry highlights on a toffee and caramel malt backbone. The body is light, but velvety smooth, with a creamy feel overall to go along with the curtains of lacing left on the glass. Subtle roasting throughout, with a slick, tangy transition into a caramel sweet aftertaste. The finish is smooth and quick, with only a slight filmy linger left behind. Decent served this way, as I was never a huge fan from a bottle or can.","GarthDanielson","Feb 12, 2012"

Smell is sweet like caramel, I think I'm also getting some malt and dark fruit sort of scent. Taste starts with a overly clean sort of taste, maybe it's just a dry flavor.

An initial biscuit flavor from the malts was followed by a lemony-grassy flavor from the hops. Nicely balanced. There is a slight alcohol flavor in the aftertaste, much like after drinking champagne.

3.33,-3.2,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"I don't know what the deal is with nitro beers, but all of them taste the same to me, which isn't necessarily a bad thing because they all taste good, just get kinda boring after a while. I mean I know nitro is supposed to make the beer more creamy, and it does, but I wish that creaminess didn't overpower the other tastes in the beer, and it usually does. Now on to the beer review: Pours a very solid one finger head, very creamy looking, tiny tiny bubbles, completely white in color. Excellent lacing on this beer, as would be expected with any nitro beer. The body is a dark and cloudy amber color, not much visibility through this beer at all. Not much carbonation in this beer at all, at least from what I can tell, that might be a problem, we'll see. Very nice contrast between the head and the body, it looks really cool. Overall it looks like a pretty standard nitro beer, but that doesn't mean it doesn't look awesome! Very creamy on the smell, you get the idea that it's just really smooth. Very nice malt smell as well, as I would expect with a nitro english beer. Not much hop aroma what so ever, I know it's an english pale ale, but still, there needs to be some hop aroma here. I may detect hints of honey as well, which is strange, because I don't remember this smelling at all like Boddingtons, but it kinda does the second time around. Perhaps brown sugar on the smell as well? Overall a really great smell, needs hops though, even though it is an english nitro beer, it's still a pale ale. Pretty disappointing on the flavor, you get a tiny bit of all the flavors I was talking about, the brown sugar, the honey, and some caramel, but it's hardly there, like barely at all. The flavor overall is just really bland and boring, it's just all malt and not much else to it. There is also an unwanted alcohol flavor to it, it's only 5.2%, I really shouldn't be tasting alcohol. I detect a tiny bitter/sour taste, so maybe there are some hops in here, but it could also be a metallic taste, because it's not a crisp bitter/sour, it's just...unpleasant. Overall the taste is ok at best, it's smooth and easy drinking, but it has a lot of unwanted flavors. It has a few nice flavors, it is very sweet in some areas, but for the most part the bads over ride the goods. The mouthfeel is pretty standard for a nitro beer, creamy, smooth, medium bodied. It has also no carbonation, which is unfortunate, most nitro beers have very little carbonation, and maybe I just usually don't notice how little they have, but on this beer I for sure did notice it. So overall the mouthfeel was just ok. Drinkability isn't bad, but honestly it should be higher, that alcohol and bland bitter/sour taste really detract from the drinkability, still it's smooth and goes down well, but overall not too great. Overall on this beer, what more can I say, on some sips it has a nice sweet malty flavor, and on other a very unwanted alcohol, bitter/sour flavor. It's a good beer, but very very close to being average and not a good beer.","MaltsOfGlory","May 22, 2011"

The taste of the beer is very much full of rich malts and just a slight amount of hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is pretty smooth, the carbonation is very light here. This is something I'd like to try from a cask. I feel that the style would go better with that then from a can. Overall it's a decent brew and worth trying.","Knapp85","May 12, 2011"

Aromas of sweet, malty goodness hit the nose first, along with some cinnamon and a random veg-all smell that seems out of place. The extremely smooth mouthfeel is evident upon first sip, followed by a sweet caramel flavor, some alcohol presence, and bitter hops that show up just long enough to let you know that they are there. The hop bitterness quickly retreats, and you are left with a slight metallic aftertaste that lingers on the tongue for a while.

Despite a smooth, creamy first look, the head petered out rather early and the sheeted lacing stopped halfway down (not a spotless class, hmm?). The aroma is a tad bready and certainly a larger degree 'fruity', but there's a decidedly whiskey quality overall. Not just the aroma but the color and flavor as well. Reminds me vaguely of Bass...maybe. But, anyway, yes, the whiskey edge is strong - a watered-down beer version of the spirit. Decent smoothness in feel - the nitro certainly blandifies the drinkiness and flavor-taste.

Not a lot too it, but enough flavor to be satisfying. The nitro really makes this beer shine. Gives it a creamy texture that helps keep each successive sip just as thick as the last.

A full rich medium feel with little carbonation or liveliness, but overall a very solid drinkable ale, very well rounded and im pleased. Ill be getting this again, ill be looking to try this on tap also.

Brew was pulled to a nice golden color with some amber/orange highlights. Good sized frothy head that had nice retention and lacing. The aroma is nice, toffee and caramel, slight hop. Very impressed with the delicacy of it. The flavors are similar to the nose, hops feel seems to come out a little more. Nice toffee flavor, extremely smooth feel. An excellent English brew IMO.

Similar to a pour of Boddingtons. Creamy with a caramel maltiness flavor. Bitter and relatively smooth. Something just wasn't quite right with it though. Overall a decent beer and I want to try it again and figure out what exactly I think was missing.","changeup45","Aug 24, 2008"
3.63,5.5,3.5,3,4,4,3.5,"I like this beer. After a delightfully woody start, it is much more hoppy than the nose suggests with an almost minty fresh bite accompanied by just the right amount of carbonation and enough sweetness in the aftertaste to avoid being overpowering. A hint of the raisin I identified earlier on lingers on the tongue once the bitterness has completely subsided. This beer packs a big punch for the style and thus has to be well worth investigating.","charlatan","Aug 20, 2008"

Slight malt mixed with roasted coffee hints. Mouthfeel was excellently creamy, helping the flavors really come out. Overall, a fantastic drink.","fitzy84","Aug 09, 2008"

It may be how it's aged, but I personally don't think the beer should be over ridden by such a powerful and unbeerlike flavor.

The smell was very pleasant, and I wouldn't mind having an air freshener that smelled like it. The taste is a little malty with some subtler notes towards the end that seemed a little like apricot to me. The mouthfeel is pretty standard with a middling amount of carbonation. I'd say this beer is fairly drinkable, but I can't imagine myself enjoying it more than a bottle or two at a time.

Sweetness from the malt was balanced just right with a touch of hops, probably Kent goldings. Just a glancing of fruityness along the palate. Mouthfeel was rather light; what you'd expect from an ale. Overall, this was just a great English ale. Reminded me of the old country.

Both flavours enjoyably lingered on in the aftertaste, with the hops being more prevalant. I found the taste enjoyable, with adequate complexities and a nice body. Mouthfeel was good, sufficiently carbonated and refreshing. I found it struck a fine balance, avoiding being too syrupy, but at the same time it had a medium body, and didnt feel too watery.

Then the hop bitterness comes into the flavor but it is still balance by the malts. The flavor of the bitterness is nice and herbal with a touch of a citrus like taste. Towards the end the malt drops out and the bitterness is left to be tasted by itself which to my taste makes this a nicely hoppy brew. The mouthfeel is very creamy and smooth from the nitro.

There's a slight--but definite--cidery sharpness right at the top of the nosefeel. Going down, the taste is something like graham crackers or wheat bread dough with a suggestion of nectarine. The aftertaste is surprisingly full of mealy, dried green apple, and bitter, earthy hops spilling out of dusty burlap bags. Unfortunately, the beer stumbles when the deflated-cola mouthfeel catches up to it. Pinpricks of bitterness through the aftertaste aren't enough to prevent things from being a watery wash.

Can't smell anything but acid & bubbles but it's not offensive, don't want to take away too much for that. Perhaps a bit sweeter than some would prefer but this isn't an IPA. The sense of caramel, malts, and hops on the finish was consistent between each can's pour.

3.92,14,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"OSH poured from the distinctive 500ml clear bottle, a clear copper tone, topped by a small but fine layer of cream-coloured head. At first, the head did not seem very consistent, however, after a few sips, the head actually began to form up, to become a little more velvety, but still remaining at about 1 finger. Appealing mixture of light red and rust colours in the beer. The lace, too, became better after a few minutes of sitting, and it then leaves thick sheets of lacing. The aroma is a delightful hit of roasted caramel, delicious Goldings hops, musty fruits, butterscotch, candy apple, maple syrup, cream and butter, raisins, light roasted meat, but of all these I get caramel/butterscotch the heaviest. OSH has an extremely mouth-watering, very English, aroma. Masterful English malt/hops balance. Initially the malt dominates the taste, bringing with it some fruity and buttery nuances. The middle senses the hops beginning their drying effect, and this follows through on the finish, leaving a noted bitterness, but absolutely nothing overwhelming; in fact there is just enough grassy herbal dryness to make this an outstanding English Pale Ale as regards balance, with the hops outdoing the malt in the finish perfectly, but not overly. Indeed, a balance which I prefer over some overhopped NA Pale Ales. In the long aftertaste, the hops bring some metallic notes, some sourish burnt toast from the crystal malt, and more caramel. Butter, raisins, subdued fruits, compared to the aroma, toasted bread, and fruitcake. The mouthfeel could use just a tad more fullness, as it becomes somewhat watery after a few sips, which adds to the drinkability while detracting from the mouthfeel. A very balanced British Pale Ale, and one which almost no one would find disagreeable for the style.","Cwrw","Jan 14, 2005"

Soft, airy nose with weak, clean malty notes and faint earthy/herbal hops. There is nothing complex or loud in the bouquet, in fact it is a hardly talkative enough to be considered inviting. The nose can be summed-up as better than bland. The palate is a little tastier than insipid (is that a compliment?). Id say it is a tickle more tasty than Boddingtons. The malt is clean with a hint of caramel, there is short but crisp bitterness from the hops mainly at the back. Flavor-wise, the hops add a suggestion of earthiness. This is an easy drinking beer; almost good enough to be a session brew. Medium in body, with a creamy and moderately filling mouthfeel, typical nitro qualities, seems to be lacking a little heft but still the mouthfeel is okay. This is a likable beer, easy to drink.

As English pale ales go (or at least those that I've tried), this one seems quite typical and lacks the bite which I associate with many of the better American versions.

Malt dominated the hops on the nose, but in a manner that was pleasant to the nostrils. Now a taste. Hmmmmm. First taste was a tad sweet. Too much malt sugarness. Second taste, more of the same. The bitterness comes out when this beer gets warmer, but that malt sweetness can't seem too come off my tongue. Perhaps it was because of the mild sweetness, but this beer seemed sticky. After every tip, I would smack my lips. This is an average drinking brew. Others I know could drink it all day. For me, I can' t overcome that sweetness, so 2-3 tops would be it fore I move on.

On palate, buttery (in taste and mouthfeel), malty and sweet. A very comforting ale, very malty and yet not cloying, with late bitterness in the finish.

2.88,-16.3,3,2.5,3,3,3,"Decent pour (nice cascade!) but the color and aroma were kind of on the bland side. Definitely creamier than most Pale Ales I have tried so it was a unique experience. However, the enjoyment definitely diminished as I worked my way through the glass. The widget is always cool though.","Dogbrick","Jul 12, 2002"
2.85,-17.2,3.5,3.5,2.5,2,3,"Okay, I followed the instructions and let it set.  Had a fairly foamy head in the can.  When I poured it, it settled into a slightly more bubbly white head which left little lace.   The aroma was of malt and some floral hops smell.  The taste was flat and had a slight aspect of malt.  The mouthfeel was thin and watery.  Other people seem to like it, so maybe I got an old can.  I just can't find much that I like about this beer.","Wildman","Jul 08, 2002"
3.85,11.9,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"I noticed this beer because of its packaging, a clear glass longneck.  Clear glass bottles as a packaging for beer have become uncommon and for good reason: light struck beer is terrible.  That being said, it was fine.","Pegasus","Jun 23, 2002"
4,16.3,4,4,4,4,4,"A new offering from the local liquor warehouse, OSH made me nervous because of that skunk-bait clear glass bottle.  I knew it couldn't have been there more than a few days, so I took a chance, and I'm glad I did.  Nice amber color and a light tan head with decent retention.  A light hoppy nose with no evidence of skunkiness.  Great balance in the flavor between malt and a slightly citrusy hop finish.  Medium-bodied, creamy mouthfeel.  I will buy this one again, as long as I know it's fresh!","BKotch","Jun 23, 2002"
3.95,14.8,4,4,4,4.5,3.5,"Deep bronze/amber in color with thick creamy head.  Faint alcohol smell with hint of sweetness.  Sweet malt flavor with floral hoppiness.  Very smooth velvetty mouthfeel.  Very drinkable.","psugrad98","Jun 02, 2002"
3.53,2.6,4,3.5,3,3.5,4.5,"Forms two heads, one 1/2 inch thick "milk" head on top and one 3 inch frothing layer bellow. This effect lasts about 15 seconds. Very creamy bubbles. Copper-colored and clear when settled. Very non-assertive sweet malt flavor, subtle as white chocolate. Very quaffable brew, three deep pulls and the pint can be history. Very skewed toward the malt end, hops are just a brief pepper at the end. I can imagine numerous pints in an English pub but I think that the nitro can is better suited to the more roasted malt styles like Stouts. The nitro can masks lots of things, the bottled version is nothing special.","ADR","May 19, 2002"
3.78,9.9,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"I had the pint nitro can. Big fluffy, extra creamy head, that cascaded nicely. The color was orange to copper. It looked inviting. Smelled alot of floral and honey maybe. Definitly hoppy on the tongue. I also noticed more sweetness than I expected in a bitter. Overall, I thought it was bit thin and watery. After the initial burst of hops, not much else was very noticable. I will say, it went down very quickly. Which is why the Brits call it a session beer, I guess.  I think this might be a little more for tweed hat wearing, umbrella carrying, MG driving,  lymies among us. (-think of the economics professor in the classic Back to School. Just kidding guys !)","StevieW","May 19, 2002"
3,-12.8,3,3,3,3,3,"An average english bitter, nice and light, malty and sweetish with a bit of hops on the finish, better cask conditioned, if not its OK.","rastaman","May 14, 2002"
3.48,1.2,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"The nose is flowery and mild. The head is thin to start with and fades quickly. The color is a medium orange brown that glows in the right light because of the slight cloudiness. The taste is a little thin and watery, but pleasant. I might have picked up a little citrus in the taste. It's a refreshing beer and the carbonation gives a little bite.","aracauna","Apr 12, 2002"
4.25,23.5,4,4,4,4.5,5,"nitro can.......of course pours a nice and thick head which sticks and sticks.  the smell was slightly of the can but not unpleasant.  full bodied mouthfeel which was slick and creamy.  nice balance of malts and hops.  nothing mind blowing but oh-so good.  i could drink many of these i imagine because it just slides down sooooooooo smooth.","budgood1","Mar 08, 2002"
3.36,-2.3,4,3,3,4,4,"(Widget can or nitrogen draft version) My favorite widget can beer, but still suffers from the muted aroma and taste profile that accompany all nitro beers.","pbrian","Oct 22, 2001"
4,16.3,4,4,4,4,4,"A very true to style English ale. A good session brew and impressive when served on draft in the Speckled Hen glassware.","John","Oct 19, 2001"
4.4,27.9,4,4,5,4,4,"This ale really surprised me..I'm usually not a big ale person but I really enjoyed this one..Beer was slightly bitter and sweet at the same time...Color was reddish amber and cloudy like a yeast beer...I'll be sure to get more of this in the future.","grdahl","Aug 22, 2001"
3.54,2.9,3,4,3,4,4,"I bought this in spite of my reluctance to gamble on beer in a clear bottle, but fortunately it had avoided 'beer sunburn."  Overall a very nice ale, but it finished with just a little too much bittering, which seemed to throw it off balance.","Brent","Jul 11, 2001"
3.51,2,4,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Notes: This is a fairly rich, robust and extremely drinkable Pale Ale. Makes for a great session beer as it goes down with no effort.","Todd","Oct 22, 2000"
