The astringency is overpowering and unpleasant, and I had not had any beer, let alone a pale ale with such a strong caramel flavor. However, I suspect there was something wrong with this bottle: The color was darker than most others described it, the astringency was overpowering, even for an English Pale ale the hops were non-existent, and it really just seemed off. I'm leaving this review for future comparison to other English Pale Ales.","enjambed","Dec 06, 2014"

4.03,4.4,4,4,4,4.25,4,"Bottle purchased from Oak & Vine on 16 Ave in Calgary, only place so far in this city I have found this classic. Pours an amazing bronze amber hue, almost marmalade orange, with a lot of white foam. I had to rush to contain the initial fizzy blast but things very quickly settled down. Aroma was heady and multifaceted, with sweet malts, stone fruits, and earthy hops predominating. This beer is a classic quintessential English ale, with ample character and complexity. Earthy woody English hops lead the way with a hint of apricot (Goldings aroma) against a rich toffee backdrop, considerable crystal malt sweetness but a lot of hop character to provide balance. Some sour crabapple and marmalade citrus flavors add complexity. Dark fruit (raisin) character and diacetyl butterscotch emerge in the finish, along with a mineral bite and old wine fermented notes. Great tapestry of English beer flavors. Body medium thick, with a lingering syrupy sweetness. Lots of residual sugars here. I am an unabashed Samuel Smith fan and this is one of the classics of the genre. Bottles may come off as a bit ""old"" in flavor but the overall effect is that of a timeless examplar of one of the great beer styles of the world.","CalgaryFMC","Oct 26, 2013"

Appearance is bright, clear copper, with a light, relatively fast-dissipating head. Flavour is quite sweet with a strong hop-layered finish, that lingers and hints at toffee. The balance is slightly toward bitter, but a well-balanced beer overall. The mouthfeel is generally light and effervescent, and contrasts sharply with the complexities within the malt and hop flavours.","dreamchaser","Sep 04, 2013"

A good many British beers were very dark before the Industrial Revolution; new malting techniques led to pale malts allowing the evolution of this classic brewing style - a cornerstone of British pub culture.","rickyleepotts","Jun 12, 2012"

Bitterness is mild, perfectly complementing the toffee flavors. A touch of butterscotch is present as well. Light in body with moderate carbonation, this is drying on the finish with a blend of toffee, hoppy bitterness, a little butterscotch and minerals.

But this is great. What a nice and drinkable pairing of honey malty sweet and mild hop bitter in a light and refreshing package.

Hop bitterness is minimal, I really like the dry bite to this brew, flavor is there with a strong complex presence, and then dissipates quickly. Very good stuff, although one or two of these is plenty for my tastes. To strong in the Carmel maltiness of it, i could see getting fatigued with that.

Earthy, malty nose with hints of caramel, butterscotch, perfume, and a touch of metal. The taste follows suit. Earthy, fruity and nutty with a nice tangy, herbal fresh hop bite. A solid toffee, malty base balances it out nicely with a hint of butterscotch and a touch of molasses. A little fizzy at first, but smoothed out nicely becoming very drinkable as it warmed.

In fact both in bottle and in glass my sample looks surprisingly dark compared to the photo in the BA reviews. Has a nice creaminess, some malt, and a hint of coffee in the flavor. Honestly, to me this seems like an aborted stout, like they started to make multiple things out of their stout process and with more time or a little tweaking this pale ale would indeed have been a stout.

Stonefruit and butter toffee permeate the nose, the fruit being especially prominent, lightly sweet and lightly tart. It has a bit of graininess to it as well, pale and amber malts with a touch of biscuit. The taste is similar to the aroma, but rearranged; the biscuit-like malts are foreward, with a mild jam-like fruitiness behind. It's like taking a bite of toast covered in peach preserves and butter. Hearty but light, this has a lot of depth yet it's very quaffable and balanced. It ends on a malty and mildly buttery and fruity note with only a hint of bitterness, ultimately drying and crackery. Very good.","largadeer","May 25, 2010"

I've always been a fan of American Pale Ales with a strong malt taste and a touch of bitter hops.

Toasted sweet malts and a buttery, nutty, almost honey-like character. Mouthfeel is smooth, not to dry and creamy like a good EPA should be.

I almost pick up some cherries in there, but they seem to disappear as soon as I look for them. Slight earthy element from the almost non existent hops.

Overall this is a great beer that I will be having again.","SickBrew","Mar 23, 2009"

Great pour, excellent head retention. Tracing on the glass. Tastes terrific, of toffee and is creamy and very nutty. Really nice flavors in the beer, shoot all around the palate. Nice hop balance on the back end. Great session brew. Way tooo expensive. A fair price for this beer may be $11 bucks a sixer but it is that for only four.

Smooth, light carbonation, a fantastic blend of malt and a hint of bitterness, with a little nut flavor and very smooth and highly drinkable. I am blown away by this.

The aroma is full of floral and earthy hops. Wonderful English hops. The flavor likewise is full of English hops balanced by biscuit and caramel malt flavors. Bitterness is fairly low for having this much hop flavor. The body is a little thin and the carbonation is fizzy. About the only thing I can complain about in this beer. I was hesitant about this beer because bottled English Ales do not hold their flavor for long. After being assured about the freshness of the bottle, I pulled the trigger and brought it home.

Taste is similar, light flavour, bit of caramel and raisin, quite toasty, a bit of fruit, light floral hopping, nutty in the finish, weak and watery. Mouthfeel is light bodied with low to medium carbonation, goes down like water. I really remember this one being quite a bit better, weak watery pale ale.","Viggo","Dec 16, 2008"
2.58,-33.2,4,1,3,3,3,"Nose in the bottle leads to a really odd, funky smell at first- like stinky feet. After the pour it opens up and smells a bit more of sour hops. Still not a great smell... reminds me of sour dog piss, no kidding. Nice bronze color to it, though. As long as I keep my nose away I can easily handle it- some good bitter, a bit sour hops. Sam Smith loves their ESB, and they do them well. This is an enjoyable beer but not a pale ale in the least. A bit tart, very malty. Average mouthfeel- what I expected. Another good brew from Samuel Smiths. I'm becoming an enormous Samuel Smiths fan, these are some high quality brews for no more than $3. Thumbs up.","Vendetta","Dec 14, 2008"

3.63,-6,3.5,3,3.5,4,4.5,"Pours a crystal clear copper color with an average off-white head that dissipated into a slight cap. The aroma is extraordinarily faint, I cannot pick up anything. The taste is of a slightly sweet caramel malt, not too buttery, and a subtle tea like hop and some white grape sweetness. Not very flavorful but I appreciate that it is not very buttery or metallic. The feel is clean and crisp, not odd flavors or bitterness getting in the way here. Samuel Smith delivers another highly sessionable brew. I could easily knock back several of these.","Gmann","Nov 29, 2008"
4.24,9.8,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Great aroma right after pouring. Oh man, I'm getting fresh apple with frosting, oak, French bread and hops spice.

Delicious and drinkable. Get this beer.","tempest","Nov 24, 2008"
3.95,2.3,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Poured with a rather loose tan head, the aroma of malty sweetness was subdued and pleasant, with hints of bread and perhaps some nicely toasted white bread. The body was rather light, and although I anticipated more robust flavor I found the taste to be rather undistinguished. Carbonation was somewhat flat; a bit more would have added some more oomph to the body. As offerings from Samuel Smith go, this one was good but not great, like so many of their other beers.","gfreed","Nov 23, 2008"
3.68,-4.7,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"This beer has a brown body with a full tan head that sticks around almost the whole time it is in the glass. The lace on the other hand disappears quickly. It has mild malty aroma which is different for a pale ale there is a metallic hop aroma in the background. The taste is also malty and not really as bitter as we are used to on this side of the pond but it is still a great beer. It has medium mouthfeel and the right amount of carbonation.","MTNboy","Nov 22, 2008"

An overall smooth flavor with a bit of apple flavor, some very smooth earthy malts, but not overpowering or too sweet. A nice dry finish is graced with some slight hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is quite good, Drinkability is about as good as it gets. This is one of my all time favorite session brews for summertime at the cabin.

A strong smell eminates, giving off a strong hop presence but also underlined by a small malt and bread presence with a hint og citrus. The beer has a ryeish, dry hop taste that contains earthy tones and is not very complex but good. Balanced out by the malts for a refreshing, smooth ale that keeps you wanting more.

A fruity, toasted pale malt nose with crystal malt, faint diacetyl and weak english hop aromas. Initial pale malt sweetness, caramel, and toasted notes are met by an assertive sugarplum fruitiness and butterscotch flavor. Semi-dry aftertaste, mild fuggle or E. Kent hop flavor and subdued bitterness keep the taste on the sweeter side. Medium in body, with a comfortable hard-water texture that never quite becomes cloying. Medium-high carbonation aids in keeping the mouthfeel crisp and not slick. There are an abundance of flavors here, but it finishes remarkably soft and drinkable.

Unfortunately, the taste is leaning towards the skunk side of things, too. Enough with the clear glass already, eh guys? Anyway, brisk mouthfeel, clean and almost juicy.

Taste is very understated initally, with caramel, fruits, toasted malt dominating, but slowly a stong hoppiness presents itself. The hoppiness becomes bolder with each sip, but still blends very well with the maltiness. Finishes both dry and malty in just the right proportions to be tasty, but not overpowering.

Smeel is sour - perhaps similar to white grapes - and has its own distinct bite. This pale ale starts incredibly smooth, light, and velvety but without much flavor. That changes as the beer settles full-bodied onto your tongue and presents a crisp flavor that at once resembles both lemon and berries over a solid matly base. Leaves the tongue dry, then semi-sweet with a metallic, sour, hop edge. Shockingly enough the aftertaste is actually pleasant.","theozag","Mar 10, 2005"

A well-balanced brew with flavors of buttery malt, hints of caramel and a slight hop taste. This seems to be a classic English version of a pale ale.

Skunkyness dissapated as the beer settled in the glass but then was replaced by fruitty esters with a sulfury winey characteristic. I don't care too much for the yeast strain Samuel Smith uses. Taste is earthy and aftertaste of grain builds up, some fruitty esters in there, again with a vinous characteristic. Body is thin and watery and beer is lightly carbonated.

The flavor is mosthy caramel malt, very sweet without much hop to bring balance. Its not bd, but not great. The feel is just moderate at bes, with a decent carbonation that works well with the beer.

The smell is off the bat skunky, once you get past that you will detect caramel malts and syrup.

The aroma is earthy and accented by toasted grains. These same grains add to the flavor of this ale and mingle carefully with the hops and other grains, along with the minerally-tasting yeast flavors.Though the malt component of this beer is put forward, the hops help achieve a balance and add a bitterness that is distinct in a British manner, but not by any means assertive or overwhelming in an American way. The English ales are about subtlety and grace when compared to brighter and more assertive American ale. I can still appreciate this beer, despite being hooked on American hops.","marcobrau","Sep 11, 2004"

4.12,6.7,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Thick, viscous, bubbly head tops a rich red/copper, very clear but not weak looking, beer. I see amber, light red, and light brown colouration. It leaves islands of lace of varying sizes on the glass, with good longevity. The aroma is ideally balanced with caramel malt and perfumy, fragrant, spicy hop notes. Besides the delightful caramel and butter smells, there exist touches of coffee, cream, sweet candy, pepper, dark fruits, fresh lettuce or other dark vegetables(yes, vegetables), and even meat, such as roast or peppered steak, most easily detectable immediately after pouring. The aroma is very organic; earthy. This is the way a good pale ale should smell, for my personal tastes: nicely balanced, with no overpowering, numbing hop presence, but still with a definite hop character. A grainy maltiness introduces itself to the palate upon the first sip: immediately detectable are the roasted qualities of the beer. Toasted bread tastes, with a very granular presence on the tongue, oatmeal-like. Strong cereal taste, but balanced enough with the bittering hops, which is felt nicely on the finish: oily and satisfactorily dry. Actually the hop feel becomes more and more pronounced with each subsequent sip. Adequate carbonation. For those who like a good bitter Pale Ale, this should be engagingly effortless to consume. Old Brewery Tadcaster does it again. I taste merry old England in every swallow.","Cwrw","May 19, 2004"

The main flavor I get when tasting this beer is caramel. There seems to be a lot of caramel which is complemented by various fruit esters, green apple leading the way. Kind of like a caramel covered apple. There is a grainy base to this which helps the flavors from getting too sweet and works with a floral hop element to complement the caramel.

I've have yet to gain an apreciation for subtlety. It poured a proud copper with a small white head, pretty appealing. Smell was very faint with some notes of fruit and malt. Taste... Hmmm.. I wish I could give this higher marks but it was very plain to me. Some sweet malt flavor was present and it was balanced very well, but nothing really jumped out at me Mouthfeel was fine as was drinkability. I'm hoping this will be a beer i grow to love, but as of this moment it just seemed very basic, very subtle. I plan to revisit this beer in a year, as my palate refines, to see what i think of it.

I suppose I'm just used to PNW Pale that are hop-heavy, but the sweet, malty nature of the taste was a little cloying. Notes of caramel are abundant, with a slight piney hopiness and a peculiar tinny aftertaste battling for the finish. Crisp nonetheless, and good in the mouth due to strong carbonation and relatively full body. Drinkability is average.

Now I could wash the glass easily enough, but I took the whole works back because I wanted a glass in good condition.

Served into an official Samuel Smith imperial pint glass. Aroma is quite fruiy with some green apple and and bready qualities coming togther. An interesting layer of earthy hops and a touch of mineral water colliding together. I bought a nice gift sampler with big 550 ml bottles of this, the Nut Brown Ale, and Oatmeal Stout with the glass included for around 11 bucks. Flavor is semi sweet with a mix of caramel malt, bready yeast tones, and balanced with fruity ale notes and herbal earthy English hops. The well water used does impart a nice mineral water character that doesn't impart any off flavors, it just really works well here. Mouthfeel is well rounded carbonation is subdued and very smooth on the palate, medium bodied session ale for sure.

There is an aroma of a carmelly sweet malt and a floral hop accent. The taste is salty due to the water with a definte sweetness due to tha carmel malt and a hop flavor that follows up to finish with a hop bitterness. Body is horrible as this beer has so much carbonic bite that it is a task in itself to find the flavors while the carbonation attacks your tongue. This beer is probably excellent if it is on cask but with artificial carbonation it is not very good, though maybe i served it too cold and too much of the carbonation was in solution instead of dissipating on opening the bottle.","RenoZymurgist","Sep 01, 2003"

There's little head, and less lace, and by the smell, you'd almost think you were about to consume water laced with a hop or two and some lemon. The taste is fortunately more full-bodied, even complicated. It's not too bitter, but what bitterness there is sticks with you throughout. It does not fade. The sweetness, that floral taste, is of rose hips offset by a twist of lemon--a fun and tantalizing feature. The mouthfeel is light and more bubbly than I expected. A good brew, really--though costly over on this side of the Atlantic.","longpondbeerman","Aug 29, 2003"

The body is medium light, and combines with a very fine & gentle carbonation to create a nicely creamy mouthfeel. The flavor is mainly of a lightly caramel & biscuity malt that's enhanced by a touch of buttery diacetyl, a distinct earthiness, some mild fruitiness, a light hop flavor and a firm balancing bitterness. In the finish, the hoppiness combines with the sweet buttery malt to give a light spiciness on the tongue and throat similar to that of black licorice candy.

3.6,-6.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Hazy, amber/orangish in color, with an off-white head. The aroma is full of grain and fruity, floral hops. The taste is of caramel malt, as well as grain. The hop flavor is floral. Hop bitterness is medium, subdued by the malt flavors. It is a medium-bodied brew with light carbonation. Overall, it is an easy drinking, well balanced English Pale Ale.","BeerBuilder","Dec 11, 2002"
4,3.6,4,4,4,4,4,"As always this was a great product from Sam Smiths! A classic Engligh Pale Ale packed with flavour! This beer poured a beautiful copper colour and smelled of hops and malts. It tasted wonderfully sharp and had a nice level of carbonation as well. This had a very big creamy mouthfeel and an awesome drinkability to boot. One of the best Pale Ales!","francisweizen","Dec 09, 2002"
4.07,5.4,3.5,4,4.5,3,4,"The color on the pour a translucent burnished copper, the head mountainous in size, the consistency is that of butter crème frosting with thick glutinous sheets of lace to envelope the glass, both a light tan color. Nose malt, and sweet black walnuts, pleasing to the old nose. First taste is ambrosial, top is fair to middling in mouth feel, the finish is enchantingly hopped, charmingly acidic, delightfully dry aftertaste. What a Wonderful World it would be if all beers were as masterfully brewed as Samuel Smiths Bravo to the brewers of this most exquisite line of beers, a regular on my Beer Shopping List!","Gusler","Dec 01, 2002"
4.53,17.4,4.5,4,5,4,4.5,"It seems I can get this regularly in Ottawa, I just have to pay through the nose at Pub Italia... Still a fantastic beer. One of my favourites, now. The colour is quite distinctive, after a year in England I don't think I ever found another beer with quite the same appearance. I certainly didn't find many with the same abundance of flavour. While I dearly love the crazy hoppy pale ales we produce on this side of the Atlantic, there really is something to be said for a more subtle, complex ale like this one. It reaches Orval-like heights of elusiveness of flavour and impressions. Two beers that are hard to pinpoint because you always notice something different when drinking them. But both beers I can't do without (and can't buy in stores here).","the42ndtourist","Nov 28, 2002"

3.6,-6.7,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Fresh hop nose.  Lasting slightly tan thick head.  Red crystal clear look with lots of little bubbles in the glass.  Toasted malt husk taste with some bitterness in the finish . Lively mouth but it does lack any real tongue coverage.  This brew is above average, but is not a ""special"" pale ale.  This style is so competitive and this beer does not ""stand out"" it just ""hangs out"".  It is a solid beer, but not one I'd buy again for the money in relation to local american competition.","frank4sail","Nov 06, 2002"
4.42,14.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Creamy fat head rests over an English amber liquid explosion of flavor. Rich and mellow buttery caramel spine is superbly balanced against loamy hops all mineral-like and tasty. Subdued carbonation makes it a pleasure to coat your throat with this stirring pale.","inebrius","Nov 03, 2002"
4.04,4.7,5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Light carbonation on the tongue with a delicious mild hop flavor. Nothing overpowering and exceptionally smooth. Just another ""common"" kick-ass brew from the Old Brewery.","IrishRedRock","Oct 20, 2002"
4.15,7.5,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Brew pours a deep copper color with a faomy thick head wafting the malty aroma all the beers from Samuel Smith seem to exude.  Smooth body with a buttery sweet malty flavor.  The sweet spicy hop profile blends well with the malt to create a tasty easy-drinking pale.  I enjoyed this much.","beernut7","Oct 11, 2002"
4.01,3.9,4.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Amber-orange color with an off white head that stays thick.  Why use clear bottles?  Preserving the freshness of the beer is much more important than being able to see the color through the bottle before buying or pouring it.  A bit of skunky aroma escaped when the bottle was opened, but it went away quickly.  My aroma rating would definitely be higher if it wasn't for that.  Sweet and fruity malt and subtle spicy hops in the nose, similar to other Samuel Smith brews.  Extremely well balanced flavor profile packed into a medium body.   Malty grain sweetness is almost one with the slight spicy hop character.  Very traditional feel.  Nice and refreshing, just an all-around pleasure to drink.  Good session brew, too.  A craft beer classic!","hyuga","Oct 10, 2002"
2.86,-25.9,4,3,2.5,3,3,"My bottle was slightly skunked (they love those clear bottles at Sam Smith's),but even that aside I was kind of disappointed at the quality, given how much I love their Oatmeal and Imperial Stouts. The aroma was malty and had a stale aspect to it. The flavor was lacking in hops but still managed some bitterness in the finish. All in all I expected better.","Dogbrick","Sep 24, 2002"
3.76,-2.6,4.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,"Pours a clear but dark caramel color with a 2 finger head that that leaves a lace all the way down.  The appearance is beautiful!  The smell is slightly fruity and lightly hoppy.  The taste is consistant with the smell but also reveals a malty taste and mouthfeel.  It surprisingly doesn't finish as dry/hoppy as some other pale ales that I've tried.  I wasn't overly impressed, but wasn't too disappointed either.  Cheers!","BeerAngel","Sep 08, 2002"
4,3.6,4,4,4,4,4,"This is beer I last had on tap in Lincoln, England.  In a bottle here, it poured a nice amber color and formed an off white head with some nice lace.  The aroma was of hops and some fruit(non-citrus).  The flavor sweet and of hops, malt and caramel.  Finish was a bit sweeter than I usually expect in pale ales.  A good beer, but definately over here in the States in a bottle, a different brew.","Wildman","Jul 10, 2002"
3.7,-4.1,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Clear and amber, spicy aroma and 1/4 inch pillowy head.  Hops in the flavor are restrained, malts are more niticeable and a little like pumpkin pie filling.  Not a lot of finish despite a medium-bodied mouthfeel.  but there is little fade in the mouth.  Pretty good balance in the hop/malt arena but then again Sam knows what they're doing.  I tend to prefer American Pales but would love to try this stuff on tap.","ADR","May 26, 2002"
3.8,-1.6,3,3,4,4,4.5,"Overall, an everyman's beer. (Or it should be instead of commercial swill).  Nice balance of malt and hops.  Not very assertive, as it mellows with any food.  This beer has a creamy texture for a pale ale, but with enough bite to keep it going.","AaronRed","May 17, 2002"
4.62,19.7,4,4.5,4.5,5,5,"Round and balanced mouthfeel.  High acidity, medium to high bitterness shows great balance. The toffee, orangey, toasty taste make this another of the old tadcaster brewerey must do's. Very well balanced between malt and hops. Dry, hoppy finish.","stoutman","May 17, 2002"
2.5,-35.2,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Not my favourite, but i got a feeling that the place that served it hadn't cleaned there equipment for a while, coz it tasted off, so thats what my ratings based on.","rastaman","May 14, 2002"
3.19,-17.4,4,2.5,3.5,3.5,3,"Copper in color and very clear.  Moderate, but persistent head.  Unfortunately, this bottle was a tad skunked (you might get lucky and get a better bottle) What would be a leafy and earthy Fuggles hop nose has become masked by skunky mercaptans.  The skunkiness does dissapate as the beer breathes, and thankfully signature fruity British yeast esters and a butterscotch note assert themselves. Luckily, the skunkiness didn't make its way into the flavor.  The moderate hop bitterness is quite clean and adequately balances sweetness from crystal malt and residual sugars left by the yeast. Pleasant mild diacetyl rounds out the flavor.  This pale finishes w/ dry biscuit malt notes.  The skunkiness prevented this from reaching its potential.  My suggestion is to pour the entire bottle into an imperial pint glass and let it ""breathe"" for several minutes before tasting.","marc77","Apr 24, 2002"
3.78,-2.1,3.5,3,4,4.5,4,"There's not much head to this beer at all, although I've come to not expect much in the head department from Samuel Smith. What it lacks in head, it makes up (partly) in coloration with it's nice medium brown transparent color. It feels really smooth on the tongue, which is nice. The taste starts out sweet and malty and then you notice a bit of roastiness. The bitterness is very mild. I'm not overly big on Pale Ales, but this is a good pale ale.","aracauna","Apr 12, 2002"
