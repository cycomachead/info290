"Beautiful golden color with thick foamy head that fades quickly with nice lacing. Light citrus taste with sweet breadiness from the two row barley. Just enough hop finish to make it interesting. Definitely a great beer when you're packing the cooler for a hot Summer afternoon at the beach."

"Good for a hot day with friends, nothing special."

"Light and crisp. Summery indeed. Perfect for the patio."

"Kind of disappointed in this beer. Too hoppy for my likes in a refreshing summer type beer. I would drink it if it was offered to me, but would not go out of my way to buy it."

"Yolk color, clear and laced foam. Like a lite pils, low malt profile. Definitely sessionable, but not my favorite."

"M^-manifestation - malty little bit of hops and a slight citrus bitter tinge."
"A month past it's best by date. First gusher I've had from a can. Aroma is floral and bready, with a touch of earthy hops and a hint of orange peel. Flavor is slightly sweet, almost honey-like, and bready, malt dominant, with minerally notes, a hint of lemon, and herbal hops adding intrigue. Finishes fairly clean, with light bitterness. Seems a bit hollow at the finish."

"Had a pitcher of this with my bro in law this past summer. It was really nice, very refreshing. Lemony taste great carbonation. But the lemon taste got to us and we had to switch it up in the next pitcher"

"Pours a light hazy yellow with a smell of citrus and a bit of spice to it. The taste was similar with hop citrus coming in first with lemon peel and grapefruit, but them sweet spices such as nutmeg make an appearance to give the beer a bit of a body. Very refreshing for the summer."

"Brooklyn Summer Ale brewed by Brooklyn Brewery with an ABV of 5.0 % This brew pours out a nice amber color with a nice white head. The smell is rich grains and sweetness. There is nothing overpowering in the smell. The taste is nothing to write home about. It is clean and refreshing. Brooklyn Summer Ale is also smooth. There is nothing overpowering in this brew. The mouthfeel is nice and clean. No bad after taste just smoothness. Overall I'm giving this brew a 4.25 out of 5. I would get this brew again."

"O: If nothing else, this would be a decent lunch beer. It's inoffensive, drinkable, and would pair well with a good sandwich. And that's its biggest problem: it's insipid. There's no excitement to be found here (not to mention the nose is almost nonexistent); on the flip side, it lives up to its ""Summer Ale"" moniker by being an acceptable hot weather refresher. I'd never refuse one, but I won't buy it again."
""
""
""
""

""

""

"pours yellow gold with a slight haze and a white head.  Creamy, left lace.  Nose is hebal,cool.  Fruity citrusy.  Biscuit and dry cracker with a little sweetness for malt.  Soft spice.  Taste isbalanced toward the malt which develops a bit of caramle in the flavor.  I wish it had been firmer.  Lots of herbal.  Cool, spice and a bit of a citrusy middle.  Not much bitterness and kind of spritzy making the body seem a little off to me."
"Overall (2/5): Brooklyn Summer Ale is just not a very good beer; for me it epitomizes the problems with summer beer. Its light body and light flavor are simply not interesting; inadequate carbonation only makes things worse. The 80 on BA and the style listing being English Pale Ale is a quite deceptive. This is mediocre to bad beer that doesn't even get the simple task of quenching one's thirst right."
""
""
""
"O: This is a summer session ale. It has good mouthfeel - unfortunately I am not a fan of the wheat beer style and flavor. I am sure this would appeal to people that like this style and want to have a few beers on a hot day."

"Crystal clear medium golden color with a huge frothy bone white head that persists forever. Aromas of bread sweet pilsner malt offset with some floral and spicy hops and just a touch of earth. The flavor follows the aroma. Sweet bready malt with enough spicy hop to balance but add a bit of non descript fruit. Light to medium body with a moderate to high level of carbonation and a bit of a watery mouthfeel. Nice enough easy drinking beer, I prefer a bit more flavor and body, but this would do fairly well on a sweltering summers day."
""
""
""
"Like many summer ales, this offering is quite sessionable. The problem is that the flavor really isn’t there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O. Not bad, but there at better. Too light, not enough flavor to distinguish from the run of the mill."

"This is a pale golden, summery brew. Light, crisp, and refreshing. The head is bright white, but small, and the complexion is clear. The aromaisof grainanssome American hops. Light,modestly fruity,and subtle malt. It is not an intense beer. Lightish in body. The beer is suitable for the season. Nice."
"O- It is what it is: a nice, simple, easy drinking EPA. When you drink this you won't be tempted to dissect it; you will say ""mmm"" and want to drink more. This is a nice summer ale. Highly recommended for sitting on the porch, fishing, or just hanging out."

"Fairly disappointing given the reputation of Brooklyn Brewery. The taste was pretty much straight down the middle and completely average with nothing to distinguish it from your run-of-the-mill, big brewery English pale ales that are much easier and cheaper to get a hold of in the UK. Not one I can recommend, especially if you live in the UK as there is much better out there."

"Pours a golden amber color with a one inch white head and some lacing as consumed. Aroma is sweet and bready with a little bit of floral hop. Taste is big on the bread malt with some underlying citrus flavor that blends with the malt for a very pleasant finish. Mouthfeel makes this a great summer beer as it consists of a smooth almost creamy feel that dissipates into a clean finish. Always a go-to summer beer for me."

"Golden, perfectly clear, and brilliant in the light with a fluffy white head. Pale malts, citrus, and very slight floral hops. Flavors are light but nicely balanced. Light bodied, refreshing, and the english yeast lends a little zing towards the back of the palate. Nice."

"O - a great summer ale for any outdoor occasion. I wish it was 90 degrees outside and summery to fully enjoy the bright sweetness this ale has to offer, but this is Chicago and it's 35. This is an outdoor 4th of July kind of beer, and at 5.0% you can have your fun all day. Maybe pair with cheese plates, mixed green and fruit salads, grilled chicken and fish, and citrus deserts like lemon bars or key lime pie."

"Overall: It’s a good offering from Brooklyn, but not one of my favorites. Actually, as summer beers go, it’s one of my least favorites. If I’m going to drink a Brooklyn Beer for the summer season, I’d rather have a Pennant Ale 55."
""
""
""
"Not a very complex or intriguing ale, offers a relatively straightforward (bland) pale character, refreshing and tasty when cold, with some bright citrus and dry florals that are quite easy to drink without much complaint, but I won’t be intrigued to pick up more."
""
""
""
""
""
"Unfortunately, this only reinforces my distaste for beers labeled ""Summer"" anything. It clearly suffers from an identity crisis and falls short in almost every category. Not something I would buy or recommend buying."
""
""
""
"Overall, I pretty dissappointed. I thought Brooklyn was a good brewery, but I guess you can't win them all...."
"Lemony and doughy to smell and to taste. Grassy and somewhat sweet. Noticeable carbonation gives it a bright mouth feel. Not liking the doughiness of it. However, in the end, comes across as simply a very average beer."

"one of the great summer beers of the northeast, and now that its canned, its even better. a light golden color, clear, with a creamy white head. it smells like pilsner malts, English ale yeast, and a crisp fruity juicy hop finish, more than is common in a summer brew. in taste, I get a nice combination of lighter malts, as well as some citrus fruit, ruby red grapefruit mostly, but a little lemon too. a touch of spice from the yeast is evident in the finish as well. effervescent carbonation is this beers best feature, it keeps it light and bright, summery. clean finish, ill take another please!"

"Tastes, looks and smells like a Magic Hat #9. The mouthfeel is a bit softer and the apricot is less pronounced, replaced by a little lemon. But really, not much special here, which is disappointing considering how many folks rave about this beer on here."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Beats out Sam Summer Ale in almost every way. As Summer brews go, this is outright grand. I enjoyed and I think fans of this style would definitely appreciate it."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 9/2013. Pours fairly hazy and cloudy pale golden amber color with a 1-2 finger dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of lemon zest, lime, pear, apple, cracker, bread, floral, grass, light pepper, herbal, and floral earthiness. Pleasant aromas with solid balance of hop and malt notes; with very weak strength. Taste of lemon zest, lime, pear, apple, cracker, bread, floral, grass, light pepper, and herbal earthiness. Lingering notes of citrus, light fruits, cracker, bread, floral, grass, light pepper, and herbal earthiness on the finish for a bit. Nice and pleasant balance of malt and hop flavors; with no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a smooth and fairly crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is very solid blonde ale. Good balance of malt and hops flavors; and very smooth to drink. An enjoyable offering."
""

"Pale amber color, very crystalline and clear in appearance. It pours a nice white foamy head about 2 fingers worth. Aroma is of lemon and wheat, yeasty bread and there’s also a slight bitter hop smell to it as well. The flavor is very mild, but has a kind of chewy, doughy feel to it which is pleasant. The finish is dry and enjoyably malty. Any hops in here are fairly well hidden. A lot of ""summer"" beers are hit and miss for me and this is a hit. Definitely one of the better ones. It's a very clean, refreshing summer beer that I could drink a lot of pretty easily."
""
""
""
"It is EXACTLY what you want in a ""summer seasonal," and it's at least as good as any of I've tried so far, if not the outright best."
""
""
"O- It went well with pizza!"
""
"Good summer ale."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was its evenness through the aroma and the flavoring. This helped to maintain smoothness and ease of drinkability through to the end of the glass, with no one flavor or component really outshining or overpowering any of the others. The core ingredients, however, felt a bit cheap, with adjuncty inclusions to the malt bill, and a rather skimpy hop thrust. While the hops were there, you had to look for them, meaning that you were left looking for the refreshment and cleanliness in your beer. This is really not the drinker’s job for a commercially available summer beverage that you would hope would want to do the job for you. That said, the beer went down smoothly enough, and is definitely something you could swill a few of while taking in playoff hockey at a bar with some friends."

"Overall – Not bad, but a little too much bitterness which takes away slightly from the more refreshing characteristics of the brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This beer is a nice crisp summer ale with some softer flavors but the big fizz is a bit bitey and hides the malt character a bit."
""

"O - nothing terrible, just tastes like a slightly improved version of a generic macro. Not enough malt backbone to hit the style. Goes down easy, but doesn't satisfy."
""
""
"Overall: Not a bad brew, but there are other summer drinkers I would go with before this one. If you are a fan of malt and barley in your easy drinkers you would enjoy this one. A little hard to get past the metallic accents though."

"Pours golden with a white head and carbination bubbling up. Smell is malty and mostly grain, a little hop presents. The taste is crisp and light, Mostly malt and a little floral and citrus. The hops are mild. Light to medium carbination and a dryer finish. A decent summer beer, easy to drink."
""
"Very tinny beer, a more respectable version of common domestics like the buds or millers. A bit tart, thin, and highly acidic. Thin but full carbonation, which got old quickly after a couple beers. Not a summer ale drinker so I may not be a good judge of this type, but it was disappointing."
""
"O - This is the perfect beer to match to the weather. Spring is in the air and on the tongue!"
"Poured from a can into a shaker pint, the beer is a bright, golden-yellow coloring with a slow flow of carbonation bubbles and a sparse filmy surface coating. Aromas of toasted grains, floral highlights, and a light, crisp hops presence. Flavors are light and toasty, with a tangy, slightly bitter hops backbone and a sweet, floral ribbon cutting across the palate. Some jasmine and juniper blending in there. Light and crisp in mouth, the beer has a tangy sweet aftertaste. Clean, crisp finish. This is a great warm weather beer."

"Poured from a 12 oz can into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a cloudy straw with no head. Smells of lots of wheat, very inviting. Tastes of wheat and citrus, a nice refreshing combination. Carbonation is right and sessionable refreshing summer brew. Overall, a very good beer."

"Rather so-so. When I first cracked the bottle and took a sniff I thought it boded well, as various 'summer ales' I've tried have been naff. However, the taste put paid to that - too much harsh stewed hops milling around and spoiling everything. Not a brilliant effort; I probably wouldn't have this again. No need to seek it out."

"This beer serves its purpose as an easy-to-drink pale ale for the hot summer months, but it doesn't provide much interest beyond that. It pours a hazy golden orange color, and a quickly vanishing fizzy head. The aroma is primarily a dull, earthy hop character that is expected for an English-style pale ale, but it lacks depth. The flavor profile is more varied, with a biscuity malt base balancing against a combination of lemony, grassy, and earthy hops. The fine, prickly carbonation drowns out any sense of complexity, though. Overall, this is a light and drinkable beer, but it is mostly uninteresting."
""
""
"Overall - A decent enough brew for a summer day... nothing groundbreaking just a decent quaffable brew.."
""
""
""
"Not really an English pale ale anyway, and more carbonated than any I can think of. Crisp and refreshing. A lot of crummy lager drinkers would take to this quite readily. Extremely drinkable."
""
""
"12 ounce can poured into glass. Somewhat hazy orange with white head, decent retention with some lacing. The nose features refreshing citric notes including orange, tangerine and lemon. Notes of light grains come through as well along with some light herbal hops. Taste is right on par with Nose, light fruity with a decent hop punch. Taste is clean and refreshing. Mouthfeel is light and high on carbonation. Overall, nice summer brew, not much flavor, but good for a hot day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: As soon as I saw the label ""Summer Ale"" I thought, ""oh here we go again with another bland brew."" But this one surprised me with it's nice malty undertones. I'd call it more of an American/English pale ale hybrid. You get the malt notes that are common in English style beers with the citrus hop flavors that are usual in American ales. Brooklyn Brewery should consider renaming this one, if for no other reason than to stand out in a sea of bland Summer Ales."

"Smells of malts and english hops. Taste is sweet malty, slight english fugle hops. Its crisp and refreshing, but just lacking any real pizzaz. Cool that it comes in cans also, for festivals and camping purposes; smart because thats really its only application. Descent summer brew..."
"Pours a medium yellow with a frothy white head. Smell is pleasant and more powerful than expected. Hops up front with some malt coming through as well. The taste is a nice mix from start to finish of the hops and malt, with a bready flavor. A nice crisp beer, light mouthfeel, nothing overpowering and great flavors. Overall a great summer beer, great session beer."

"O: Nothing overly complex here, but this is one of the classier pale ales I've had. Great beer."
"12 oz bottle. Pours golden with a long lasting white head and lots of lacing. Aroma is of biscuit malt, pear and herbal hops. Body is medium and slightly crisp. Taste is biscuit malt and herbal, grassy hops, hints of fruit. Finish is medium and dry. Good summer brew."

"A refreshing ""summer"" brew. No bold flavors to weigh this one down. Some easy drinking."
"Refreshing, clean, but simplistic. I would prefer a slightly more foreward malt character for the style, but the hops play nicely. It's a refreshing summer beer, but nothing more."

"I don't dislike this beer, and I get that it's an English Pale, but it's lacking in the nose and that estery goodness that English malts offer with that appropriate yeast strain. Doesn't come together as anything but a light and boring summery ale. No off-flavors, though. Just solid enough to hold up to itself. 3.5"

"It gets a much sweeter, malty taste after a while, but unfortunately loses its flavor if you let it sit to long, and takes on a very dry, biscuit flavor."

""
""
"This pale ale is quite a thirst quencher. This pale ale is a perfect pick year around!"
"i was a bit harsh on it, but it is a nice session ale and very mellow. in my opinion, they should have just made a weaker version of sorachi ace and called it their summer ale. you can't go wrong there."
""
""
""
"Overall, a good offering from Brooklyn that is a great thirst quencher."
""
""
"Golden bodied beer with a finger of white soda fountain fizz that disappeared quickly, leaving a ring of lace. Smell is earthy, bready and a tad citric-lemon sour. Taste is lightly citric hop, a bit lemony, a little earthy, with a steady biscuit, bready malt backbone, the overall effect is well balanced and clean. Crisply carbonated and medium-light body that holds together well. There is simply nothing wrong with this aptly labeled ""Summer Ale""."

"This beer does have a hidden complexity to it with a creaminess that hides certain flavors but again, there are year round beers i'd choose over it for the hot days of summer."
"O- A simple, tasty, and effective beer. Great for a summer day."
"O: not a bad beer, I think I would have this again, preferably on tap."

"Poured into a pint glass. Pours clear golden with a large, frothy white head. The head dissipates slowly, but retains well. Some lacing was left on the glass. There are a few bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass. The beer has aromas of barley malt and bright, citrusy hops. It smells clean. There are flavors of barley malt, bitter hops, and citrusy hops. The flavor is clean and simple, but also well balanced. The body is light to medium with some carbonation. The finish is crisp and dry. The drinkability is also very high. Overall, this is a solid beer. It works as a summer beer because it is refreshing and highly drinkable."

"D: not a bad beer, but not for me. i certainly found this a little boring and wont be seeking it out again during the summer beer releases."
"O: i cant lie, this is right up at the top of my favorite summer beers, it is ridiculously drinkable and phenomenally smooth, so well balanced and in cans it is really ideal for the summer times at the race track, beach, boat, backyard, etc."

"From the 355 ml. bottle. Sampled on April 12, 2012. The pour is golden yellow with a white fizzy head that disperses quickly and becomes a ring. The aroma has a notable grainy and malty character with a slight wisp of hops mixed in. The body is about medium with a creaminess to it. The taste tended to be malty and grainy but there was a tart hop bitterness on the end that made it feel nearly dry. It has its attributes."

"O- This was pretty decent for a summer beer. It was exactly what you are looking for in a summer beer- light, refreshing, crisp, and sessionable. The only problem I had with it was that it could have definitely had a little bit more flavor."

"O- I didn't think this was much to look at and was rather bland in general aroma wise, but the flavor and mouthfeel is done well and creates a really good hot weather brew that I'd pick up again if given the chance....I will say though that I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way for this one. I do give this one a thumbs up, and it is worth giving a try to!"

"A nice graininess to the aroma - very earthy. Grassy hops complement the citrus twang. A dry, if a bit bland, finish. Medium-light bodied with an agreeable amount of carbonation. Quite flavorful, yet light enough to be a refreshing summer brew."
"There’s nothing to complain about here. This still packed in some moderate flavors but the overall package was fairly light, breezy, and inoffensive on the palate. This is perfect for refreshing summer drinking and a great pick by Brooklyn to put into cans."
"Overall - I think this is a very good beer and it's very refreshing."
"Light bodied with moderate carbonation. Crisp and clean. Very drinkable in the hotter weather, but that's about the only time I'd have it."
"O: Decent summer offering. It's refreshing and goes down easy. Label is eye catching in colors."
"Somewhat straightforward, but refreshing for being so. Does not disappoint and I would say this is a great patio/session beer."
"This is a good, easily attainable, highly available beer."
"Its a hot September day here in Oswego and just returned from overseas and needed something relatively light and tasty....the Brooklyn Summer Ale provided decent taste and mouthfeel. The appearance was a cloudy yellow with good carbonation and finger thick white head that is lacing. The smell has lemon and hops. The taste was ok...was hints of lemon and hop. The mouthfeel was great for this warm day. Definitely worth a try."
"D: Light and crisp, good mouth coating."
"The beer pours a gold color with one-inch long lasting white head. The aroma is good. It has a clean pale malt and wheat scent that's refreshing. There is a bit of yeast fruitiness present. The taste is decent. Sour finish for an English Pale Ale. It is refreshing but unexpected. Good clean hoppy finish. This is a simple brew that's quite tasty and easy drinking, especially during the summer. The mouthfeel is good light with good carbonation. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. Very drinkable. A nice offering."
"Nice lemony citrus aroma with abit of grassiness comes out of a very pale beer. The lacing recedes very quickly. This beer is very refreshing, and unique in the world of summer ales. It is very quenching and dry, with a bit of citrusy hop flavor, but you have to search for it. Carbonation is spot on for a summer quaffer. And that's just what this beer is for me. Nothing more, nothing less. Very well done and is a great summer beer if you want to quench your thirst with a very well-made light ale. Incredibly drinkable."
"Pours a yellow golden color with a frothy white head. It smells of green apple and funk with some grain and citrus with other fruity aroma. The taste is slightly bitter with just a hint of lemon, and sour grain with a bitter citrus and grassy aftertaste. The beer is light with lots of carbonation and a dry finish. This is better than most summer beers and I really enjoyed the slightly sour accent."
"Pale, brassy clarity, and the lacing puts on a good show while sticking to the glass. Hoppy, salty, fresh grain, very faint butter, taffy and a hint of apple skin in the nose. Crisp with enough smoothness to get by; semidry, malty palate. Very savory for a summer brew—fresh and light biscuity grain meets a subtle salt and butter combo. Hops drop a leafy herbal component on top. Very drinkable, and among the more complex summer seasonals out there."
"It's a summer ale so don't expect anything too complex but Brooklyn do a good job of combining a few different styles in one thirst quenching beer. There is the citrus notes of a Wit combined with a hop note of a British Golden Ale and a clean finish much like a lager. Tastes good and works wonders on the patio."
"Brooklyn Summer Ale pours out a light gold color, small but sturdy white head topping it off. The scent has a lot of buttery diacetyl, which is what I love about this style, as well as some biscuity caramel malt, with a fair amount of citrusy hops as well. The taste starts off with a nice, bready malt profile, nice caramel interlaced with the diacetyl, a nice amount of fruitiness which I think is coming from the yeast, a nice amount of hops which are mildly bitter, pretty floral and give off slight citrus tones as well. Just a dash of lemon zest. Medium bodied and somewhat dry."
"Beer is medium body, sweet, mildly bitter, a little dry. Decent all around. Nothing too special. I'd have it again, cautiously."
"Good beer, slightly above average in every respect. No doubt you can find more daring beers, but it's still recommended."
"Not the best beer in the world, but it's great for what it is: a summer quencher. Cheers!"
"O - Easily drinkable and certainly a good summer patio ale. Could be a bit more bold on the flavours, but it's tasty nonetheless."
"Sharp, slightly sweet, lightly bitter, …fairly easy-going, downable, sessional. …and, for me, ultimately forgettable. But, it's a beer, and you can drink it."
"Not a bad tipple, nor overly complex, but enjoyable enough to put back while distracted by other summer attractions."
"Overall: A nice beer. Good choice for canned beer. Not my favorite in the genre but drinkable for those summer months."
"O - Not really what I think of for a summer ale. It wasn't very refreshing, and it drank a little tough towards the end, with the malts being a bit too strong for the hops."
"The beer pours a medium yellow color with a white head. The aroma is a mix of grain and lemon with some wheat notes. The flavor is a mix of wheat and some perfume from the hops. I also get some grass and orange citrus notes in the flavor. The bitterness is fairly low and the beer is very drinkable. Thin to medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"O- I found this offering from Brooklyn to be extremely one dimensional. Not something I'd willingly have again."
"O - an easy drinking english style pale ale. simple yet still flavorful."
"Overall, this is a decent brew, but this might be the shortest review I've written in some time. There is just very little to say here good or bad. It's decent, no less, no more."
"Mouthfeel is thin to medium bodied, with an average amount of carbonation; very drinkable. Overall, a good summer beer, but other than that, I wouldn't touch it. I understand that's the point of this brew, but I'm looking for a bit more refreshment and taste out of a summer beer. This is also something you need to drink quickly because as it warms it becomes far too sticky and less refreshing and the good qualities really start to disappear."
"This beer poured out as a light golden color with a foamy white head on top. The smell of the beer has a touch of lemon zest and malts in there. The taste had a hint of lemon as well and is fairly malty. The mouthfeel is pretty lighter and is decently refreshing. Overall this is a lot like the Sam Adams Summer Wheat but not as good."
"Overall a decent run of the mill summer ale, Pretty average for the style but certainly not sub par. Not brooklyns best not their worst. Worth trying once, good in hot weather, nothing particularly noteworthy."
"Notes- Very refreshing in the Texas heat. As a summer seasonal, its an okay choice; would not pick buy again myself though."
"Overall – A decent summer refresher but I expected more. It's nice and crisp tasting, just not really memorable in any sort of way. It would work well for camping trips, especially since it comes in cans now."
"overall a great beer i would definitely bring this to a bbq again nice one brooklyn"
"Overall, this was pretty damn drinkable and would be great by the pool."
"Pours a light golden very clear color with a white head. Smells pretty light, some bready malts with a little citrus hops. Mouth is light with med carbonation. The taste is of bready/biscuity malts, a little citrus on the way down, very light. Overall this was good enough, I'm not much of a summer beer type of person though."
"I'm drinking it out of the can. The aroma is mildly herbal-hoppy and has a faint lemon note as well. It tastes quite a bit like a hopped-up Kolsch, with very pale dry grain notes, minerality, herbal-floral flavors, and a hint of lemon zest. It is not fruity or buttery like I think of an EPA as being. The feel is crisp and refreshing. Good summer beer."
"O- Very easy drinking. A pleasant, albeit unspectacular beer."
"O/D-Just not my favorite Summer seasonal. Give me a handful of other Summer brews before this. A bit bland. Funky looking can. Doesn't make up for the flavor. Not awful, but I would recommend a few others before this."
"On tap. Pours a translucent light amber color with an inch of head. Fair amount of lacing. Aroma is sweet. Picking up on grains, citrus hops, and caramel. Taste is a light hop bitterness with the flavor of grains. Maybe a hint of lemon peel. Crisp, flavorful summer beer. Good amount of flavor for a summer beer. Overall, its a solid warm weather beer. Worth seeking out."
"overall, a fine, inoffensive summer ale. fits the bill for a refreshing, ""good to enjoy during a summer BBQ"" type of beer, but won't bowl you over with flavor. for my money there are better summery brews out there."
"The mouthfeel was light in body with plenty of refreshing carbonation."
"About the only thing they got right on this beer is the carbonation. If you live here in the Land of 10,000 Lakes, it'll remind of a high-end version of Schmidt, particularly with the aftertaste (that's not a good thing). Only thing is, Schmidt costs half of what this beer does. Other than a slight grapefruit tang, it's bitterness has no complexity and almost no malt to offset it, so it's watery and unsatisfying. They were going for crisp and refreshing and fell short. Right now, I'm regretting passing up the Sierra Nevada Summerfest Lager (which I know is good). Sometimes you try a new beer against your suspicions, and it pays off. This was not one of those occasions. I know Beer Advocate requests that we respect what the brewer was going after, but in a case like this where you get a cheap tasting beer for an expensive price, people deserve to know."
"Taste was decent. Definitely in the summer style. I felt like it was a cross between an IPA and a stronger Blue Moon. It was just hoppy enough that faded and lent way to a citrus taste. It was refreshing and light, but ultimately not my thing."
"D - Not a bad beer, but really nothing particularly special. The malt is fairly strong throughout, with enough hops to balance, but really not much character over and above that. A pretty passable beer for hot weather, but if you want to put some effort into it, you wouldn't have much trouble finding something better."
"This is an enjoyable summer beer, especially in can form. My wife and I have gone through the 12 pack quickly. I would purchase this beer again."
"OA: If they were ever to make a Brooklyn Light, (I hope that'll never happen)… I hope they just repackage this… It's a fine summer brew."
"O - Quite a decent pale 'summer ale', I wouldn't expect anything less from the Brooklyn Brewery. It's a nice beer that quenches one's thirst and is a nice opener to any session and stronger beers."
"O- It's okay, tastes a lot like Brooklyn Lager with some citrus and a little lighter. It lacks any real differentiating flavors."
"Hooray for cans."
"Pours a yellow-orange color, with an effervescent head. I found myself briefly captivated by the bubbles floating to the top. The nose is clean, with hints of citrus and spices. This brew goes down easily, despite the carbonation. I like the smoothness, but the citrus and spice I smelled earlier isn't showing up in the taste as much as I thought it would. I get a grassier taste instead, with a hop bite at the end. Unexceptional, but tasty and drinkable. This beer was a pleasant surprise for me."
"Overall – A very enjoyable summer beer. It is hitting the spot right now and would like to have it again in the future."
"Finish is clean and crisp and refreshing. A great summer brew."
"This beer poured a shade darker than gold, a bit hazy. Head was inconsequential. Scent was a balance between hops and citrus, lemony. Taste was on the bitter side, certainly a quaffable summer ale. Mouthfeel is on the crisp, side, dry, and refreshing. Overall I like this beer, but not a knockout."
"O - a solid beer that goes down easy."
"First, thanks to Brooklyn for canning this beer. I love having another option for tailgating, BBQ or the beach. This is a mild ale that's perfect for a warm, summer day. Color is a nice golden hue with decent head and lace. I actually prefer from the can. Smells of mild yeast, malt, citrus, hops. Taste is crisp with a nice hint of lemon. It's a very drinkable beer. It's not overwhelming in any aspect, but solid all around. A brew I'll revisit all summer long."
"O: Meh. It's OK. Light and refreshing, but kind of tastes like a slightly classed up light American Lager. Worth drinking for sure, but only in the right circumstances."
"Flavor is as balanced as the nose, with just a subtle bitterness and a fruity hop flavor. There is a nice clean malt flavor that comes through, with the balance leaning more towards hops. Finishes with some lingering sweetness. I'd like it a touch drier just because of the hop balance, but overall it is a nice beer."
"O- very enjoyable summer brew. Perfect on a hot night like tonight. It has enough flavor to give the beer character while still maintaining its drinkability. I would definitely purchase again"
"O: It was o.k. Around these parts, I much prefer an Oberon in the summer."
"overall: a nice summer drinker, went down very easily on a nice warm summer night next to a camp fire, but its not really something above average. the only thing that would keep me coming back is that its available in a can."
"Drink- Overall, its slightly better than average but still tasty. The malts are clean and well done but not as flavorful as could be."
"The Crack & Glug went off without a hitch and I quickly had two rocky, foamy fingers of bone-white head with decent retention. Color was a deep golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a grassy bitterness along with a biscuity characteristic. Mouthfeel was medium with a grassy, biscuit malty sweetness on the tongue. Finish was quite pleasant, very refreshing, semi-dry. I would definitely put this in the cooler this summer."
"D: A nice beer for the summer – sort of a summer ale done as a pilsner. Pleasantly hoppy in a bright and grassy way with a nice softly bready malt base. A refined lawnmower beer with a bit of class and character."
"O: This is my kind of summer ale. Simple and refreshing. Not like the over-spiced versions that are loaded with stuff like coriander and grains of paradise like so many other brewers. Thanks Brooklyn."
"Overall: A wonderful pale ale and definitely something that would be refreshing on a hot summer day. Definitely recommended."
"Opened on a hot day after running a 10k foot race. Poured into my standard pint. Tan creamy appearance with 1/4 inch lacing. Looked nice. Fruity aroma with a slight touch of hops. Easy to drink and quite tasty. Could enjoy a few of these. The background flavors were hard to identify. May have to try again..."
"Yeah, this is not a foo, foo, Beer Nerds wet dream, but it sure will hit you in the soft spot after some yard work, kickin back on the deck or porch, or to enjoy at a summer bbq. I'm in, just call me."
"Would I buy more of it? - absolutely. I bought a 12-pack as that was the only format available and I'm definitely glad I've got a bunch of these left in the fridge."
"O: This is a nice summer beer that I will drink again"
"Overall Drinkability - No off flavors. Light and refreshing. Does a pilsners job well. [ED - it's actually an English Pale Ale]"
"O: This is a good summer beer, I think you'd enjoy it more out on a deck in the sun, but it works in a basement while watching a movie too."
"I enjoyed this beer a lot. Smells of dry hops and citrus. Taste is superb. Very light, but not sacrificing any taste. There is just enough hops to give it a nice bite, but the citrus works very well. Compared to Sam Adams Summer, Harpoon Summer, and Leinenkugel's Summer, this is BY FAR my favorite. Just be careful, since Brooklyn Summer is so drinkable, the alcohol can really creep up on you."
"O: This beer has to little of what makes an English Pale Ale great. More malt and more hops would have made it better."
"A slight disappointment, this one."
"O: An easy drinking summer ale. I could drink plenty of these."
"Very mild in the taste, but the finish is awesome. Very nice summer’s beer."
"Overall: This makes a perfect summer beer. I just wish it was a little cheaper, but I still don't feel bad if I drink a couple in a sitting. Drinks super easy, and in cans would make a great tailgating beer."
"I'm sure it's filtered - it's fairly light and clean but it retains just enough of the body and flavor of an English ale and malt. I'd certainly like to try this on cask - bet it's better, you bet."
"Clear golden with low head retention and little lace. Grainy, malty aroma. Uncooked grain flavor with light bitterness. Some sweetness in the middle. Grainy finish. Medium carbonation and medium body."
"Well, as a summer drink it has some merits, could replace rose wine as an aperetif on a summer evening."
"Overall a nice summer ale.  Goes down very easily, and you can have a few.  I'd recommend buying a 12 pack of these for when you have non-craft drinkers over instead of the BMC stuff they're used to."
"SOLID, NOT ESSENTIAL!"
"O - A good showing by Brooklyn. Nothing groundbreaking or unique, but a solid, refreshing session beer that would be perfect for a hot summer day or to wash down some grillables at an outdoor BBQ. Would have again."
"O: A nice summer beer, drinks easily and not very filling. Might grab some cans of this for the summer."
"This beer pours a clear, dark, yellow with little head or lace. It's aroma is fruity and grassy. The flavor has fruity notes, mainly lemon and grapefruit with a dry, crisp hoppy finish. It has a light, almost watery mouthfeel making it fairly easy to session. Brooklyn Summer Ale is an okay beer, light and refreshing, slightly recommended."
"First time drinking this beer, heard some bad things about past brews, but this was quite nice!"
"A substandard English Pale Ale to say the least. Way to much soapy hops going on. Not something I enjoyed, and would not recommend."
"Overall this definitely didn't tickle my fancy when it comes to crisp hoppy summer pales. Seemed kind of skunked and BMC like but was pretty easy to drink with food. Would look elsewhere for a summer ale."
"O: I can think of about 100 other summer ales that I would rather drink around the pool."
"I didn't enjoy this in 2010, but I'm finding it much more acceptable in 2011. It pours about the same, a little hazy yellow but has a better head and retention to it. The smell brings a lot more to the table with a fresh leafy hop aroma and flavor. I tried this well before the freshness date and it was stored properly(refrigerated) when I purchased it. This is not a beer to try if you see it sitting on the shelf because you and I both know that hop will fade, fade, fade..."
"Overall: A very solid and tasty version of a summer ale."
"Nice beer. Tough to find low abv beers this good."
"typical light summer beer"
"O: This does well as a gulper in 90 degree heat which is all I was looking for anyway."
"O - This has good drinkability. This is a great beer for a hot day. It goes down smooth and is nice and refreshing. Also, it is low in alcohol, but good in flavor. Overall, I thought this was a nice pale ale, and I would try it again."
"Overall a nice hot weather beer. Good Flavors That are paired well with easy mouthfeel."
"This beer pours a semi hazy golden color. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes slowly into a small cap of foam. The aroma is of mandarin oranges, with hints of flowers and grapefruit. It is a very faint aroma. The taste is similar to the aroma, and equally faint. The mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium bodied with high carbonation, and a watery texture. Overall, this is an average beer at best, and I will probably not drink it again."
"Overall: Great summer ale. Simple yet somehow complex in a subtle way. Could drink this all day while grilling. I really did not expect much out of this beer and am shocked."
"Brooklyn Summer Ale...I love the light, refreshing taste of this beer! Perfect for a hot summer day! Golden color, light on hops, light on malt...light body and bready taste. Light crisp bitterness and a citrusy/floral aroama! 5% ABV is perfect for drinking a few of them!"
"I wasn't initially very impressed with this beer, but the more time I spent with it, the more it intrigued me. Definitely tasty and very quaffable-this would in fact make for a great summer beverage."
"Hazed golden body. Thin white head. Minimal lace. Nice bready malt aroma with a nice hop presence and a nice touch of lemon as well. On the buds, English malt base with a biscuity flavor. Crisp and snappy hop presence flavor wise. Not overly bitter, but enough to add a touch of dryness. Touch of lemon in the flavor as well. Nice amount of carbonation. Medium bodied. Quite flavorful and drinkable. Solid offering."
"Overall: Easy to drink. A little one noted but would enjoy one of these for lunch or a 6er of these on a summer day."
"Ah, Brooklyn Summer, the only summer beer I look forward to every year. Forget Sam Summer and Harpoon Summer, this is the summer beer that every one should give a chance too. The color is a dark pale straw to a good orange that is reminiscent of a summer sunset. The smell light citrus and by light, if you see some one put an orange wedge in this, take their glass remove the orange and chuck it at their head, is by far the best, not to much but no lacking. There is not need to enhance the taste with a freaking slice of orange. The carbonation to this summer delight, I feel is, again not a can of Bud, but not a can of Guinness canned Draught Stout . I love it, and wait for it every year, so give it a try."
"O- its a clean easy drinking pale ale that can be sessioned"
"Overall: my overall impression is that while this isn't particularly exciting, its not half bad. If one considers it to be a summer ale, it hits it right on the head. As for an English Pale Ale? I don't know about that. Maybe the keg has been sitting for awhile and the hop character has died down a bit and a fresher beer might've been more hoppy, which I think would've been desirable. Still, worth it for what it is. Cheers!"
"The mouthfeel is nice, it's light and well-carbonated, and the drinkability is exceptional. Hell, I don't know if it's because it's just super-fresh (somehow we got bottles here in Florida before this went on tap up at the brewery), but this really tickled me the right way. Just a great, refreshing summer ale. I need more."
"Poured very nice hazy yellowish tinted amber with a more then ample two inch plus foamy and sticky head on top. This faded reluctantly down to just a small thin film across the top and that pretty much stayed the entire time. Now there was a good amount of side glass lace present here and this had a really nice effect of the look of this. I know it was a pale ale, but it was really starting to look like an IPA. Smell was very hopped, but also nice and light. Very nice blend of floral hops and light grassy grains. The flavor was very similar to this as well. A very nice hopped up front greeted you right away and was quickly followed up by the nice and almost a touch of sweet grain like back to it. Long drawn out dry finish left a really nice taste and follow through. The feel was great. Lots of carbonation really helping to push it along and lighten it up nicely"
"Pours a golden color, white head, minimal lacing. Grainy aroma, grassy, with light hints of citrus. Taste is light and crisp, grassy, a slight citrus twist. Light body, some carbonation, pretty crisp and refreshing. Moderately drinkable, and a good summertime brew."
"Pretty good summer beer. I definitely would have enjoyed it more on a hot day next to the pool with some BBQ but, hey, you do what you can. Nothing fancy, but still well-balanced and refreshing. Though it was technically expired and had probably spent the past three or four months in a supermarket, it still tasted somewhat fresh and I think I got a pretty decent impression of it."
"D. Good, refreshing summer ale though not as good as Sam Adams version."
"All I smelled were yeast an hops, but I was sniffing under less than ideal conditions. The taste was... barely there. I tasted a little hops but not much else. I found it pretty tasteless and boring. It wasn't bad, but neither was it good. If I could decribe it in one word it would be: meh."
"D: Very drinkable; although not the most flavorful beer, its makes for a great summertime brew; very refreshing."
"I'd rate the drinkability way higher if it actually tasted better...doesn't taste bad, it's just not very interesting."
"So many good beers out there. If I hadn't had some world class examples, this may have stood out. Easy to get spoiled."
"For a summer drink, this wouldn't be awful, but that's about the only time I'd want to have it."
"Not complex just very good on hot days."
"Drinkability: although I'm not crazy about the flavor, this is a very drinkable and refreshing beer. I feel like the aftertaste is a better experience than the flavor itself, which just leaves me wanting another sip. An interesting effect; one which contributes to drinkability in my book."
"I felt it relied a bit too much on the lemon zest flavor. Would have liked to see a little more. I did enjoy it overall and would consider it again for a hot summer day."
"D: Lacks complexity and intrigue, but it's a good quality beer to throw back if you're in the mood for it."
"D - if you like citrus beers then very drinkable if not then not so much however none of the flavors our very overpowering"
"This is an excellent example of what a summer ale should be - light without being watery, flavorful without being overbearing, a bit tart but not sour, lemony but not citrusy. This beer finds the ideal middle ground on all points so as to be a most drinkable hot-weather quencher, yet not just a lawnmower beer."
"Overall this wasn't a bad beer but it wasn't crisp enough for a style that has little room for error. Not worth seeking out but not worth turning down either."
"D: Very easy drinking, I could throw back a few of these in a sitting. I would defiantly buy this again."
"I'm thinking of a hot and humid scorcher of a day in New York City and the crystal clear, light amber, refreshing tap I've welcomed into my mug this summer. There is a subtle peachy accent in the light citrus nose of this that indicates the crisp but light malt and low bitter lemon zesty taste to come."
"Deep yellow with excellent clarity and a white fizzy head that dissipates quickly. No lacings. Malty, bready aroma with a hint of orange citrus. Biscuity flavor with a light lemony hoppy taste and a very clean finish. The English malt flavor very nicely subdues the hop bitterness. Very refreshing and drinkable."
"Served in a Imperial Pint glass. An off orange color with about 2 or 3 inches of overflowing head. Scents of window cleaner and other household detergents, kind of make this brew a turn off. Faint hoppy flavored followed by some mild malty flavors. Mouthfeel is smooth. Still pretty drinkable."
"D- its a good, nonoffensive summer beer. Maybe...too nonoffensive"
"Reviewed in bottle 9/3/10. Review stands a written!"
"Poured golden into an American pint glass, with less than a finger of white, which fell rather quickly. Modest lacing, but a healthy dose of carbonation. Apple, pear, lemon, hay, grass, and herbal notes are all evident in the nose. The flavor did yield some modest fruitiness initially, but evolved to a very herbal hoppy finish. Thin and carbonated; makes for a nice session beer/lawnmower beer in the summertime."
"Pours a clear golden amber with a small off white head. Smells of overripened fruit. Taste is light and of caramel and dried fruits, finishes with an oak aged character, woody and dry. Mouthfeel is average. Drinkability is decent, I have had quite a few better english pale ales though."
"I'm not too well versed when it comes to English pale ales, but I'm a staunch fan of seasonals, particularly the summer. While many summer selections simply lighten up on the body and the taste, Brooklyn's selection seems to have have found a balance between all the things you love about a good tasting/feeling beer, while at the same time making it extremely refreshing. Time to stock up now before the season changes, and enjoy this frequently all the way until mid-September."
"No distinguishing qualities that separates it from any other summer seasonal beer, but nonetheless very good."
"Served on: July 11, 2010"
"Drinkability: Extremely drinkable, and very good for a summer day. Not necessarily the best or most complex beer, but it's definitely satisfying and has a place."
"Drinkability: After a hot day, this does the trick nicely, and the high level of carbonation cleans the palate with a meal. It's a very refreshing beer - which makes it a very good summer beer."
"Really great summer beer. Bright flavor that goes down easy. Fizzy carbonation, citrusy hops right at the forefront. Almost a spiced flavor at the back, but not too much of a linger on the palate makes this a very refreshing summer beer. Light body, doesn't stay in your mouth for very long. I really enjoyed this beer and it's nice to have a summer ale that isn't a wheat beer for once."
"Very average beer bought on a whim. Light golden color with a good half inch head. Average smell easily picked up lemon and sweet malts. The taste left much to be desired when compared to other summer ales. Surprising light feel which makes it very easy to drink."
"Pours a light golden color with a half inch white head. Light grain, wheat and lemon aroma. Nice light balanced taste. Toasted grain and wheat malts start off. A bit of sweetness from the malt. Grassy hops balance the beer nicely and a hint of lemon zest caps off the beer. Refreshing light mouthfeel with a hint of chewy breadyness. Not huge flavor, but very nice balance on a hot summer day."
"Mouthfeel is light and crisp. Drinkability is very good. This is a beer you could drink all day. Good flavor...light abv. Very nice!!!"
"A great summer beer as long as it's not too humid and doesn't get over 88 degrees."
"Notes: This is a very well made English Ale. As for its style I feel it is walking the line between English Pale Ale and English Pale Mild in my opinion. Ether this beer just screams summer time drinkability!!!"
"Pale golden with a fine white head. The aroma is lemony citrus with floral and herbal hop notes. Mild and refreshing with an earthy hop bite and untoasted grain flavors. Light and crisp with plenty of carbonation. I find this beer to be a refreshing, if unremarkable."
"Drinkability: this is an excellent summer session beer. I could drink several of these and enjoy the last as much as the first."
"I've never been a big fan of summer beers and this one is not much different. If I want something light I'm more likely to get a good german pils or a kolsch. This is called an English pale but i think it ha too much esther to really fit in that category. Very light in color, highly carbonated, aroma wasn't bad. Just a little bit of a weak beer overall."
"D- very drinkable and super refreshing. A great summer beer."
"Pours a nice golden color with a moderate eggshell head that retains fairly well. The aroma has some grassy and floral hops, along with honey and biscuit, a little fruitiness, some mineral character, and hay. The flavor is similar to the aroma, with grassy and floral hops upfront, along with honeysuckle and cane sugar, biscuit and toffee, some mineraly quality, orange marmalade and a slight alcohol note. The mouthfeel is on the lighter side (but appropriately so) and drinkability is off the charts. I've had this beer a number of times before and was never impressed, but after I let this one warm up a little it really shined. This is an incredibly quaffable, yet flavorful and well constructed summer beer."
"Kind of a light version of their Pennant '55 ale. That's the closest comparison. And I agree it should be considered as more of an English mild than a EPA. For my money, though, if you want a widely distributed English-style low ABV ale by an American brewer, go with Goose Island's Honker's Ale. Much more interesting session-style beer."
"Pours from the 12oz. bottle a golden straw color with a thick 1 1/2 finger head that settles into a thick collar. Active, plentiful carbonation inside the glass. Aroma is clean with hints of fruit, dough & malt. First sip reveals a crisp, dry lemon peel bitterness along with a slight metallic note. Very subtle hop note. Mouthfeel is light & crisp, but not watery. Drinkability if nothing short of excellent! One could easily session these on a hot summer day (or anytime of year). Overall, a good summer brew. Will go nicely with the food i'm planning to grill during my vacation cookout!"
"This beer really shouldn't be in the Pale Ale category. According to Garrett Oliver it's an English ""Light Dinner Ale", and therefore is lighter and less intense than a true Pale Ale. If reviewers realized that this beer is actually a mild (I do think it should be put in the English Mild category) then I think attitudes might change. This is an eminently sessionable, refreshing and drinkable beer."
"D - Goes down easy on a hot day."
"D- More drinkable than some lemony summer brews. It's a nice switch from a wheat base common in many summer brews. I could put back a few on a hot summer day."
"Cheers."
"Super easy drinking, highly sessionable."
"It leaves a somewhat dry fruit aftertaste of slight pear. Very drinkable beer."
"(Note on appearance: Although I drank this out of the bottle, my partner poured his, and I have to say that the color was a clear, pretty orange/amber/light, light brown. Pleasing to a girl's eye, at least!)"
"D- Not bad for a pale ale, the lemon zest was a litte overpowering in the beginning but faded. Good beer for a hot summer evening."
"refreshing and crisp, yet relatively flavorful. a great choice for a hot summer evening."
"Drinkability - I like this beer. I could see myself drinking this on into the fall season. Not a typical summer brew for sure. I definitely like this more than the average summer wheat beers I have tried. This would be perfect for those hot summer evenings, but not so much during the hot part of the day."
"D-Through the roof. Definitely sessionable as it is only 5% alcohol and very, very easy to drink. Its also very tasty and enjoyable. I highly recommend this for Summer consumption."
"This is a very solid summer beer and English pale ale. Lots of hops with just enough sweetness and dryness to be a great summer beer. Loved it."
"Had this one on tap. Crystal clear golden yellow hue with a thin white head. Citrusy aroma with a kick of floral hops. There's a sweet caramel malt presence at first. Then you get a citrus/lemon zest that coincides with the hoppy finish. Very crisp and clean with some fairly biting carbonation. This is a very refreshing beer. Didn't really expect much from this one, but I was very pleasantly surprised."
"I had high hopes for this beer but overall I'm a bit disappointed. Not a bad beer by any stretch, just didn't live up to expectations."
"Notes: Still not a bit disappointed with Brooklyn distributing here in Nashville. Can't wait to try the rest of their offerings."
"D: Although it is very easy to drink, there's nothing particularly special about this beer that makes it stand out. It might be a good beer to pair with a food when you are looking for something light that doesn't have a strong taste."
"This is highly carbonated, similar to an IPA, this is a fairly easy drinking brew, but I don't think I could have more than 2 in a sitting."
"Once again I'm not disappointed with a Brooklyn offering."
"D- This is an easy drinking beer to say the least. No overpowering full flavors but still nice sipper. Would love to drink this on a warm summers day."
"There is no hint of alcohol in here and it goes down easy. Next time I see these I'll have to pick up a 6 pack instead of a single bottle."
"12oz bottle. Nice golden color with good carbonation. Aroma is very simple some citrus but much faded since I bought it fresh a month ago. Pretty full for a summer ale but none the less refreshing on a warmer day. Bit of hop, but then again there was more when I had it last. Not Brooklyn's best offering but a solid summer brew when fresher."
"drinkable and refreshing enough, but probably won't seek it out again."
"Jammed this in my luggage coming back from Texas, made it under the 50lb limit which was awesome. This is a great beer, golden color, lacing head. Mouthfeel was light and sweet,somewhat floral. This is a very drinkable beer, light refreshing, well-made, solid brewery, and would jam it in my suitcase anytime."
"D - Wonderful, light, refreshing, very drinkable. I would be interested in tasting a variance of temperatures to see where it performs best."
"S/T/M = 4/3.5/3.5"
" Overall, refreshing, if a bit dissapointing offering from Mr. Oliver. Everything is a bit too understated for an English pale ale"
"More like an American pale ale than an English one. Crisper body with a high level of carbonation. Light crystal malt nuttiness in an otherwise pale malt base. Good hop finish, although it is short lived. Overall, a very nice pale ale."
"D-I think I could have more than one of these but have to be honest, it's no brooklyn lager. That is still my favorite from this brewery."
"Drinkability: A light summer ale and nothing else. Lacks a lot of complexity. I prefer the sierra nevada summer lager even though thats a different style. An average ale over all. This would be extremely refreshing on a hot day any other time though, average."
"D-Man, anyone could just drink the mess out of this all day long and be very happy. A good summertime beer indeed."
"D: Great summer time ale. One of my favorites by Brooklyn Brewery. Perfect for when it's hot out. I'd prefer it over most summer ales."
"Cheers!!"
"D - I really liked this brew. It was very tasty and easy drinking"
"The smell and taste of this beer are pretty average, but the crispness, light body and refreshing flavors make it very drinkable on a hot day."
"Now that I've got that off my chest, the beer itself is quite good. It's hard to find a good example of the (CREAM ALE) style, so this is a welcome addition to my fridge during hot weather."
"Poured into a hefeweizen glass. Color was a golden amber with a white froathy head. The head left small amounts clinging to the sides. Small amounts of carbonation was constantly rising. Aroma was slighty fruity, oranges/berries, with yeasty white bread. Taste was sweet, maybe with a small touch of soapy. Felt thin and watery in the mouth. Could be a good beer on a hot summer day."
"D - 4 Brooklyn's Summer Ale is a pretty drinkable brew. It isn't to flavorful to overwhelm, nor is it too bland to make it uninteresting."
"This is a very drinkable summer brew."
"ale pours a mellow gold with a half inch head that quickly vanished. Clean grainy aroma, fresh, mild malty taste with a little bit of zing of hops in the back. Very much a summer quencher that would be perfect for a backyard barbecue. My macro loving son in law loved it so it could be a good transitional beer."
"D: Low ABV and easy to drink but not interesting or too terribly tasty."
" buying it."
"Drinkability here is high for sure. It wouldn't be hard to put quite a few of these down. Its style is listed as an EPA, but has some characteristics of a wheat beer as well (the citrus)."
"Overall very crisp and refreshing on a hot summer day so it fulfills its purpose. Very drinkable on a hot day but not one I will likely be seeking out again. Still was nice to try, there are just better options out there as far as summer beers go."
"Overall: Not a bad summer offering from Brooklyn and very drinkable. Not something that I would seek out as it really does not bring anything new to the summer seasonable table."
"A summer ale that isn't a pale wheat ale or fruit beer??? Unbelievable. I really enjoyed this beer I must say, one of my favorite summer seasonals now. Pours a nice pale golden color, small head to it, not much for lacing or bubbles. Can smell the nice hops and malts as you're pouring it.. excellent. This is a very crisp, refreshing beer. Very well balanced and nice solid mouthfeel with a light body perfect on a hot day. One of the more thirst quenching beers I've tried.. I enjoyed this one a lot, nothing too special but just a solid beer."
"The flavors are delightful breadiness with a buttery diacytle (sp?),"
"If you are looking for a nice summer ale, you could do a lot worse than this one."
"Drinkability: I personally just didn't love this beer. It is not a bad beer and definitely has times when it would be a great beer (think hot summer days and barbecuing) but overall its just a simpler kinda beer. Also, the carbonation was a little high fo me to give it huge points in drinkability."
"This is kind of an American Blonde Ale and English Pale Ale hybrid so that's how I reviewed it."
"Maybe I am drinking this at the wrong time. It's a somewhat cold rainy night, and I think I would appreciate this one more in the middle of a summer heat wave."
"I have to say, I was pretty disappointed in this one right here. Maybe the english pale ale isnt my style, but there was not much I liked about this guy right here. This tastes like it could be just about any semi-light beer. There is nothing about this beer that stands out. It tastes like an old bottle of Acme pale ale I drank a while back. I will finish the glass, but I will need something to wash it down with for sure..."
"Drinkability: Very high - it's super light and refreshing."
"Summer calls for a summer ale. Brooklyn's version pours a clear golden color with a few centimeters of white foam with nice retention. Clean malt aromas with some citrus hops compose the nose. Bready malt is complemented by some citrus-like hoppiness toward the finish. Clean, crisp, and definitely refreshing."
"D - This beer goes down very easily and is very refreshing."
"D - A tasty ale, but not my fave in Brooklyn's line-up. It is a good pale ale and appropriate to the style but avererage among a pack of pales"
"Very refreshing summer beer. Drinkable."
"d- very drinkable, goes down nice and smoooth, prefect for a summer day."
"Big fan of other Brooklyn Brewery offerings (Brown Ale, Lager, Double Chocolate Stout), and while not a huge fan of summer ales, this one is very good. Color is light straw w/ a foamy white head. Smell is sweet with malt overtones. Taste is also sweet, malty, slightly fruity, but not overbearingly so. Very enjoyable beer to have on a hot evening. Good session beer."
"Looks and tastes like a nice english pale ale. Reminds me a lot of the Fullers ESB, very easy to drink and very refreshing. Kinda has a light wheat like flavor, with a smattering of hops. Palt malts help to round this out into a solid drink. Really doesn't give you much to think about, just a very drinkable slightly bitter ale that will be quite enjoyable for these hot summer Louisiana days."
"Drinkability: This is ok for summer ale. I could have it again, but just as easily pass. I am glad I bought a single, not a six pack."
"Very drinkable, if the occasion is a hot day with no breeze. It does say summer, right?"
"D: Fairly drinkable. Simple flavor and light bodied, but still good. A nice summer seasonal, for sure."
"This is a nice beer for a warm evening in Cincinnati."
"Clear golden orange with a small, creamy head. Pale, bready malt aroma...biscuity with citrus, lemon zest, and floral hops. Bread and flowers upfront in the flavor. Some dried fruit and citrus zestiness. Mild sweetness and an almost spiced quality. Crisp, clean medium light. A good take on a summer seaonal. I can dig the British angle..."
"Light and refreshing, yet packed full of flavor. Nice drinkability."
"This is a crisp brew, truly refreshing, and with some decent palate character as well."
"D - Very refreshing! its probably good from the bottle too on nice warm summer days."
"This is a nice, flavorful take on a summer ale. Grassy hop flavors add a nice crispness to the heavy bready maltiness. Plenty of carbonation add to the thirst quenching quality of this beer. I think just about anyone who drinks beer can appreciate this one. Me likey."
"Not worth trying unless what you just read sounds enticing."
"most everything i've ever had from this brewery has been crisp, classy, and enjoyable- this brew was no let-down. poured into brooklyn brewery pint glass- fitting. poured a light amber/ almost golden color with decent clearity and a white, foamy head that settled in about a minute. notably had decent lacing. smells of citrus and earthy hops, subtle hint of the malts. crisp citrus taste, hops bear a small, but noticable, presence. finishes with a fresh lemony bite and traces of the hops persuading a moderately dry pellet. definately smooth and drinkable. not too complex. light body and good carbonation. definately a good addition to the brooklyn line-up."
"In New England most people only know the Sam Adams summer ale, which is decent. But I think this summer ale offering from Brooklyn is better."
"Soft, fizzy carbonation add to the experience of this easy drinking beer. What can I say I dig this brew. It has all the right flavors in the right places. Could it be better... sure but I sure enjoy it the way it is."
"This is another nice summer quaffer. I will undoubtedly be keeping this stocked in the fridge during these upcoming months."
"Drinkability: This is a very refreshing summer brew that has a unmistakenly good malt profile. It feels bigger then it is, yet it is highly drinkable and well balanced. I love how authentic the lemon is in this one, very close to something directly infused into the beer. A very good offering for the summer by Brooklyn!"
"overall - It's not an especially complex beer, but it fits the bill of a 'summer ale' very well. Maybe I'm just biased, but I can't find a Brooklyn brewery beer I don't like."
"Verdict: Summer Ale is a solid enough mild beer that works as a great warm-weather alternative to all of the Lagers and wheat beers out there. It's not the most complex or interesting beer out there, but it's not meant to be. Certainly worth a try."
"D: Really refreshing. It seems like this beer is true to its style. I'm not a huge fan of the bready/buttery EPA character. But even as a fruit fly fell into the beer, I pulled it out and finished it."
"Brooklyn Summer Ale is a very clear light golden ale with a thin white ring of a head. It has a fruity, wooden hop aroma, with a note of lemon. It is light, fluffy and crisp in the mouth. It has a boozy taste. It's lightly bitter, with notes of lemon and light grain. It seems a little strong for a summer ale."
"Definate taste of lemon in the ale, goes down very smooth. A refreshing ale, definately worthy of the name ""summer ale""."
"12oz bottle. Pours a perfectly clear gold with a small white foam cap. Smells of biscuity malt with nice aromatic hops. Faintly grassy/herbal with an overall sweet character. Light malt flavors are dominant on the palate with some citrus character, faint-but-noticeable bitterness, and a lightly spicy finish. Strange residual lemon flavors. Light-bodied and well-carbonated. Crisp and refreshing."
"D - This is extremely easy to drink. This is a great lawn mower beer or for us in Louisiana...perfect with some spicy boiled crawfish."
"This is a very sessionable beer, and would be great on a hot day."
"M & D: Low ABV. Good carbonation with a light body. Perfect beach beer."
"D - Now this is what I call refreshing, very clean and crisp and doesn't taste like corn, the kind of beer I crave after a 4 mile run"
"D Excellent. Really the best feature of this beer."
"D - Not a bad beer its a good refreshing beer for the summer good taste thats easy to drink worth trying"
"I will definitely seek this out again, especially now that the weather is getting warmer. Great beer for sitting on the porch and enjoying the day."
"Not a complex beer, but quite quaffable. A good session beer, and one of the better Brooklyn beers I've had."
"Had this on tap at the Houston Flying Saucer. Was poured into a pint glass. Nice looking light golden color with a nice creamy white head. Wonderful aromas of honey, light citrus and malts. Very easy to drink with more honey and citrus in the taste with high carbonation. A nice crispy sweet finish. Perfect summer beer. I enjoyed this more than Sam Adam's summer ale. Will definately try again."
"D: Drinkable, but this is definitely not the first beer that I would look for on a hot summer day."
"D: A somewhat pedestrian offering from Brooklyn, although it does earn high marks for refreshment and drinkability. I'll be taking a closer look at some Brooklyn beers soon, but I can't say I understand the hype currently."
"Drinkability: Very Drinkable - I recommend this to anyone looking for a refreshing beer without the high alcohol level of most craft beer."
"D: While I'm not a huge fan of pale ale, but this was a tasty, easy to drink brew."
"The taste is quite mild. There is a nice balance, some bready malts, some hops balance things out, maybe a touch drying in the finish. The beer has an ever so slight citrus taste a little bit honeyed as well. The beer is more smooth than pricklish, but this is not an entirely smooth beer either. There is an ever so slight little tangy bite towards the finish that keeps this from being too mild an experience. It is a respectable, well balanced pale ale, light, refreshing, plenty carbonated, slight mouthfeel, not much aftertaste."
"Mouthfeel: Very very crisp and refreshing carbonation. Pretty good all-around."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not filling at all, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a nice poundable beer that seems to fit its role as a summer beer quite well, even though there are other of its kind that I would pick first."
"7/4/7/4/13 (3.5/5)"
"Out of a summer '08 bottle this beer was a bright lemon yellow color with lots of visible carbonation rising in it. The head was off-white, retained fairly well and left curtains of lacing. The aroma was of light floral hops and 'wet' wheat. The flavors were similar but unimpressive, bready and biscuity malt, the understated hops and a wheat finish that was crisp. The mouthfeel was rough due to over-carbonation and a medium/light body. Not as refreshing as I hoped from a summer offering."
"Had this at McCarren park during an Armin Van Buuren concert- Brooklyn Brewery was there to provide beer. Light golden pour with a thin head. Not a strong aroma. Relatively weak taste that fits the lack of aroma. Not a very flavorful beer, but it is easy to drink. Their vienna lager is far better."
"A good beer to try but I won't be seeking this out; I'll have one if the opportunity presents itself though."
"Overall this is a decent refreshing summer ale. Something very sessionable to be consumed while mowing the lawn perhahps, but nothing special beyond that. I like the grainy nose, but this beer lacks any complexity beyond that. The color is a little on the light sight (reminds of a cheap BMC lager)"
"Drinkability- A very drinkable beer, muy tasty and a great one for bbq'ing."
"12 oz bottle at 515 in Santa Cruz. Poured into a pilsener glass. Clear gold with a modest white froth that leaves some scattered lacing. Aromas of fresh bread, grass, and light citrus. Flavor is doughy and biscuity with a soft Cascade tartness. Just a touch of bitterness. Great balance, full-flavored while maintaining lightness. Mouthfeel is smooth and crisp with a clean finish. Ridiculously easy to drink. A great thirst-quencher, one of the best summer ales there is."
"D- good beer but not the best, wouldnt be my first choice but its not bad."
"A decent beer. Good with a nice grinder (read: hoagie, sub, etc.). A solid go to in my small quick pick package store. Try it, but don't go crazy to get it."
"Served in a tumbler. Poured a transluent honey-gold with a quarter inch off-white head that dissipated into a broken skim of foam within seconds; no lacing during the session. Light fruity esters and grassy character in the nose. Taste is predominantly wheaty with a little sweetness, as well as a hint of citrus and hops detectable in the middle and end, respectively. Mouthfeel is light-bodied and lively with a clean finish. Easy drinking beer. Quite sessionable and simple."
"Easy drinking summer brew."
"Liked this brew and could drink a few, and would drink again."
"D: A good summer ale, that I found to be a nice change of pace from all the wheat beers that are out now."
"Drinkabilty: Exactly as billed, this is a crisp and easy drinking summer beer."
"More acidic than I would have thought. Light-bodied but with a little creaminess. A good, light, summery beer. Rather weak but good, unobtrusive flavor."
"Color is a very golden, light amber hue. Good two finger head after the pour that quickly recedes to a strong film of foam. The aroma makes me thin k of an American pale wheat ale. Light fruit notes with some adjuncty corn goodness. But there are some flower hop aroms in this beer as well. The taste has bready malt with a light note of bananas and corn. Bitter, yet sessionable aftertaste of flower vines. The palate is crisp and starchy. This beer makes me think of a bitter pale wheat ale than an English pale ale. Pretty refreshing beer, although I might not care for the flavors and the categorization."
"The mouth is crisp and it makes an easy drinking summer brew."
"D - Though this isn't the best summer offering I've had, or even all that well balanced (muted malt presence) I still can't help but sip on this repeatedly. The extremely complex spice note from mid to late palate is addictive and engaging. I'll be sure to pick up more of this before the season is out."
"12oz brown bottle with a best before date of December 2008. Pours a clear deep gold with a 2 finger,large bubble, head that faded rather quickly. Decnt lace. Smells of citrus, honey, and wheat malt. Almost American hefe like. Flavor is somewhat sweet with honey, citrus and slightly bready. Nice hop aftertaste and a odd, although nice sweetness. Slightly sprtizy. Perhaps a bit too rich for a great summer beer, but a good one none the less. Give one a try."
"D: Very drinkable beer. I would definately recommend this for a session beer."
"Pours golden with a tightly beaded white head that settles to a ring in relatively short order. Smells of clean, tangy malt with some fresh grainy smells. The taste is similar- the grain is even more pronounced, the tanginess less so. Clean, but with a decent body and depth of flavor. It's fairly light, of course, but there are some earthy hops on the finish to add a little interest. Nicely balanced, light, and tangy, so this drinks well in the summer- still, I could use some more flavor to sustain my interest- not my favorite style, but pretty well done."
"This would be a fine session ale for any season. The bottle states 5.0% ABV which is ideal for a long evening. A very nice change from the ubiquitous ""kolsh", ""wit"" and ""American wheat"" styles offered in the summer."
"not something I would look for there are definitly better summer ales out there"
"D: Garret put a new spin on this style, a easy session beer no doubt and perfect for the hot outdoor imbibing sessions. A low key chill out beer that is not too tangy on the stomach."
"Taste follows the nose. Biscuit malt base plays second fiddle to a very citrusy and tangy hop flavor. Marmalade and lemon zest. Thirst quenchingly citrusy with some acidity and a dry finish. Moderate body with a bubbly feel (would prefer a smoother feel). Lingering toffee/biscuit malt late in the finish. A good hot weather ale that should drink very nicely out on the porch."
"There is some definite lemon in the taste. Bubbly and biting on the mouthfeel. Not a bad summer ale. Looking for something to stand out, but it's not there."
"MF&D - IMO one of the better summer seasonals. Great BBQ beer."
"M/D: Overall, maybe a bit too much carbonation and not what I expected from Brooklyn, I definately expected a better flavor, but it was easy to drink and I might buy it again, depending on my mood."
"Light, clear, golden tangerine with a cap of fine white. Smells honey sweet and grainy with some herbal hops. Light bodied clean and dry. Lightly sweet grainy toasted and earthy herbal bitter. Easy drinker, but I didn't find anything to really stand out. Could just be the style."
"A tasty English style alternative to all the American Wheats and Berry ales."
"Drinkability: easily drinkable with refreshing taste and lively body. If you're looking for a beer with dryness and hoppy flavors with relatively lower alcohol, this is a great summertime brew."
"D: Easy to drink and enjoyable enough, but nothing too special or interesting here -- solid."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a golden orange color with a nice off-white head that leaves a good amount of lacing around the glass. The aroma is sweet bready malt, a touch of caramel and floral hops. The taste is smooth and malty up front with a crisp citrusy hop finish. Overall, Brooklyn Summer Ale is another solid beer from Brooklyn Brewery, and would make for a nice session beer. Worth a shot."
"Drinkability: a very nice summer time beer that can be quaffed all day. Worth picking this one up."
"Notes: I reviewed this under bottle and I must write that this beer tasted better from tap. Perfect summer beer."
"Refreshing at the end, typical for a summer brew, but I'd have trouble picking this out of any run-of-the-mill summer brew."
"D: I could drink this all day, but would I? It's very thirst-quenching, but I'm not sure it has enough flavor to keep me coming back for more. Plus, it would probably be crushed by most foods. It's basically a Brooklyn Light Ale."
"This is a nice mellow beer. I wouldn't normally place it with a summer beer, I think I would prefer this during the early fall. The flavoring is very well balanced. Over all it is a nice mellow beer that has a strong enough flavoring to make you want more."
"A definite for those looking for a summer ale that refreshes, without all of the fruitiness."
"Light bodied with medium carbonation, very drinkable. Another fine brew from Brooklyn Brewery."
"D: Easy to drink and rather thirst quenching. Solid flavors stay together through the finish. Another nice brew from Brooklyn."
"There's not a lot of smell to this ale. It pours with a small head. It isn't overly carbonated. It has a grassy and citrus taste with just a bit of malt. Not unpleasant at all and certainly quafable on a hot day but I won't be seeking it out."
"D: Super easy drinking on this 95 degree day. While not the best beer from Brooklyn this is a great summer beer."
"drinkability: very inoffensive and extremely refreshing. Not extremely complex but it's very very drinkable. I like it a lot."
"Pleasant floral-citrus hoppy aroma on arrival. Average ale mouthfeel. The flavor is OK, but very one-note. Some grassy and tart hops, some malt, but neither complex and aromatic nor particularly refreshing. Yes, it's on the light side for an ale but I am left wishing I went for a good pilsener or hefeweizen (Brooklyn makes a nice pils). So I don't quite get the reason for this beer's existence. Not interesting, flavorful or refreshing enough to come back to; but not terrible."
"I think Brooklyn nailed what they are going for here. I'm not a fan of blonde ale type brews, but I think this is a nice easy drinker for the summer months. Could be a good call as a session brew or a change of pace from the Wits/American Pale Wheat Ales we see in the summertime."
"Score really depends on whether rating to style (average due to thinness) or based on fact that is intended to be a Summer beer (high because light and fruity). I go with the higher score because brewer's intention seems to simply be to make a nice light Summer beer, not an iconic APA within the BJCP style guidelines."
"NOTES: Aside from the use of *some* English hops, I'm not sure that this beer is really an English Pale Ale, especially since it's not even remotely close to others in the class like Fullers, Bass, and Tetley's."
"D- strange, but not repulsive. on a hot summer day with such a low abv, i could picture this ONE going down nicely. only one, not two."
"Lots of carbonation to enhance experience with a nice palate cleansing effect. I had mine with a cheeseburger. Perfect!"
"Drinkability - Very drinkable, fairly low ABV so I could put a few back on a hot summer's day. Nothing too stand out about this beer, but then again a very solid offering from Brooklyn."
"M/D: Light bodied, a little over carbonated as well. Drinkability is so-so, it drinks a little like a lager, crisp and and relatively smooth, but I expect more from a pale ale."
"A 12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. The beer was a golden color with a medium-sized head that still left some nice lacing. I thought the aroma was a little muted, with a faint grain and citrus smell. The taste was the same, but a lot more assertive. The malt and citrus balanced out nicely, and I thought this was a refreshing beer."
"Recommended..."
"My next goal is to convince Brooklyn Brewery to release this beer in six-pack tallboy cans. Oh man, I'd be in heaven."
"Tastes equally as clean, even a wee bit watery. Malts are dominant, but this one's not sweet, luckily. It's an easy drinker, but not one of my Brooklyn favorites by far."
"12 oz. bottle, brewed with 100% English 2-row barley. October '07 notched on the side, but I had this on the 21st of July - that's how far behind I am on my reviews. Ah well. It pours a mildly-hazed gold, with medium carbonation, and a loose, one finger deep, off-white head that deposits some decent lacing. Smells a bit earthy, with green/spicy hops and a dash of sea salt. It has a mild, yet pleasant flavor, with bready/biscuity malts, a light, crisp fruitiness, and the same hops as in the aroma, which contribute loads of flavor but impart only a mild bitterness. The body is light, crisp, and dry, enabling this beer to go down quite easily. In fact, drinkability is where this beer excels, as it is quite easy to pack a few of these away. Good summer quaff."
"drinkability - Nice summer beer from Brooklyn."
"This brew poured into a pint glass leavning a minimal head which quickly disspersed into a thin layer of foam. The smell is of light hops. The brew has a light taste with a hint of hops. Mouthfeel is good clean and crisp. A refreshing brew. I like it."
"The 4.50% ABV is just right for this and makes this brew a pretty darn good session beer. Brooklyn's still near the top of my list for beers that I love because of their wide range, but I can't help but think that this was a missed opportunity to stand out from a pack just a bit more. This is only for the die-hard Big Apple beer drinker."
"Pours a clear golden yellow with a large white foamy head. Pretty standard looking. The smell is floral with a hint of sweet malt. The taste is crisp with a slight hop bite. floral flavors, and sweet malt. The m/f is light with all the flavors mixing reasonably well. This is a decent summer beer,but not all that interesting."
"It pours a transparent, bubbly, golden color with a fizzy head. The nose is fruity with some hops and bread-like notes. The bready flavor is complimented by just enough hops and fruitiness to make it bearable. Not bad, but could have potentially been way, way better. The mouthfeel is soft and light. Not a bad drinker, could down a few of these. Overall and average, run-of-the mill beer."
"A most refreshing beer and one that has some nice layers of tastes sensations built in. Not complex by any means, but definitely well crafted. This screams for a sharply dressed salad, whitefish, dry white cheddar, even mild Pacific Rim and tamer Thai cuisine...or (oohhhh, oysters on the half shell with Tabasco!) any simple fare (burgers to steaks) that could come off a summer grill. Actually, a White Cheddar Cheeseburger with Pepper Relish would be perfect. One of the better summer ales I've had, and in that Maine brewers, IMHO, do a nice job with that ""genre"" that is saying something. Definitely recommended as a fantastic lawnmower beer or with that cheeseburger...or both!"
"This is pretty drinkable. Nothing special leads me to yearn this brew, though. It is kind of bland and boring, but that is kind of what I expect from a beer like this. It's ""English", but at least it isn't flat..."
"Drinkability- An average beer for the most part."
"The drinkability is not quite what I look for in a summer ale. MK"
"Pours a nice golden pale color, nice carbonation, nice little creamy white head, not much sticky lacing afterwards. The nose is malty, slightly hoppy, slight yeasty, some spice's, and caramel. The taste is malty/hoppy, yeasty, some spice's and caramel. The finish is dry and slightly bitter. Medium body. Drinkable, but most likley would not buy if readily available, a quench thirster, maybe."
"Pours a pale orange color with a white head. Aromas of corriander and spice and a mix of wheat and pale malt tones. In the taste, well it seems kind of wheat ale like, hints of spice and a dry end. Refreshing with a dry aftertaste. Kind of a standard summer ale, not huge on flavor, but refreshing and non offensive."
"Very pale gold but nice lacing. Biscuity and slightly sweet smell. Tastes a little tangy with a hop presence, however slight, finally coming through in the aftertaste. A decent summer beer. Kind of lackluster but still a bit unique. I'd gladly drink it again next summer, though I might not buy it over some of the other mainstays."
"D: A very drinkable offering from Brooklyn, as I find many of their beers to be. Compared to other summer ales, this has a unique hop profile and a bit more interesting character than others."
"Good drinkability, not a standout, but nothing radical enough to mar it's drinkability."
"Bright, perfectly clear golden color with a small cap of off-white bubbles that quickly falls away to a tiny collar. Biscuity, slightly sweet malts make for a pleasant nose, while the hops that are so prominent in the taste are pretty muted. A grassy note is present in the smell too. As mentioned, hop bitterness has a strong presence, especially in the finish. The malts aren't particularly complex, but they're nonetheless tasty. Some ripe fruit in the middle. Mouthfeel is smoother and cleaner than I expect given that level of hops but doesn't cross the line into being watery. This isn't a standout but fares quite well as a different sort of summer ale."
"This is a very average beer, but I respect where Brooklyn was headed. The use of all barley instead of all kinds of adjuncts yields a tasty brew that's just as drinkable as a bud, but much tastier, which is ironic because it's a simpler list of ingredients. I think this could get bmc drinkers to give craft beer a chance."
"A light body, light effervescence with nothing but hops after the swalllow. Sadly, nothing to make me want to have this again."
"For a malt-mouth like me this beer is pretty drinkable. Nice malty aromas, full-bodied taste, and a not-too-thin mouthfeel make this a nice summer brew."
"Pours a clear 17k gold hue, with a frothy three and a half finger head that holds very well and leaves fine patches of lace. Toasty Victory malt, light Crystal, and buscuit aromas are prevelant, along with Marris Otter and a touch of roasted barley. A hint of butterscotch in the aroma, accompanied by a fragrant EKG herbal hop scent. First sip if full of sweet Marris Otter and delicate Two-row, with a strong toasted note and mild caramel backing it up. The aftertaste starts out hoppy like soft Fuggles and herbal EKG, then a slightly spicy Tettnanger or Hallertau flavor brings the taste into perfect balance and level bitterness. A suggestion of diacetyl and fruity english ale character slowly becomes more apparent and pairs with the medium carbonatiion and light body to achive a mouthfeel that is both lively and complex, but also non-cloying and lusciously smooth. The finish is malty but not residual and the hop tones fade away gradually with the mineral character. The drinkability is simply phenomenal and this beer is a testament to the lower ABV styles that are just as satisfying as the modern-day Double and Imperial ales of great strength."
"Drinkability: A light, refreshing beer that makes for fine summertime drinking."
"D: Incredibly drinkable. I had this as a night cap, but I can see it working wonders on a warm summer afternoon. I can't wait to pair this with a burger off the grill."
"D-This is a great session summer beer and different than traditional summer offerings. Refreshing would definitely be my word for it. If you are expecting an American Pale you will be dissapointed but if you aren't expecting that you will be pleased. I will be picking up a sixer of this."
"Overall: This beer is poundable. It's not a world class beer by any means but take it for what it is an easy drinking good tasting beer. You could line these up down the bar and keep them coming. I won't fill my refrigerator with them, but its a good tasting nice drinking beer. I could see why others would love it."
"The beer is solid but would probably be better with food."
"d: Certainly easy. Another pleasant beer from Brooklyn."
"12 ounce bottle, best before October 2007. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a golden color with an inch and a half white head. Head retention and lacing are both very good. It smells like grassy hops, grain and sweet malt, along with an earthy aroma. It tastes like grain, sweet malt, grapefruit and grassy/earthy hops. Mouthfeel is light, crisp and clean. Drinkability is good, it's not a bad choice as a session beer as it's smooth and goes down easy. I think this is a pretty decent brew, good and sessionable but even better on a hot summer day."
"If you look at Brooklyn's Summer Ale as an English-style summer ale, it's pretty much spot on for the style although most examples from the UK offer a tad bit more hops in at least the flavor. The maltiness is quite distinct, however, hitting you squarely in the nose aroma-wise, and then following in the flavor. It's straw-like, grassy, and a touch earthy - and the hops that follow are very much the same. To guess, I'd imagine there's some Maris Otter mixed with a non-floor malted base, and Fuggles with a bit of Goldings thrown in. There's a mild bit of fruitiness to it, but it's really just about the rounded malt and hop profile. It's not complex, but it's not intended to be. It's lighter than a pale ale, well, at least less bitter, and basically just a nice, easy drinking ale that's got some nice flavor to it."
"Pours a crisp golden yellow with a decent head that slowly diminishes to a ring. The aroma is dominated by earthy hops with some sweet malts. The taste is a very decent balance of earthy citrus hops and sweet malts, it's just nothing all that spectacular or overpowering. The beer is light to slightly medium bodied with a very slight heaviness to it. This is certainly an enjoyable beer, but I must admit, I'm partial to American style over English styles any day of the week."
"Had a couple of these on back deck while grilling some food up. Nice easy drinking summer brew. Poured from a 12oz bottle and served in a pint glass, revealed a nice dark golden yellow body topped with a white, foamy 2 finger head. After a couple minutes the head settled down and after several sips, there was some nice lacing on the glass. The smell was somewhat faint at first but after digging in I could detect wheat, malt and some very mild fruitiness, a nice aroma. This ale tasted really good, it's got little bite, it strikes a nice balance between tangy hops and a tasty malty flavor, along with a wheat backbone. Mouthfeel is clean and crisp,it's a light bodied beer, with a mild dry bitterness. Overall this is a really good summer brew for the summer months, very sessionable."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Light bodied and carbonation is very good. Very, very drinkable. I could session this. Overall, it's good. I'll drink it again."
"Recommended"
"The beer pours a gold color with one finger white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a clean pale malt and wheat scent that's refreshing. There is a bit of yeast fruitiness present. The taste is decent. It has a clean, crisp wheat flavor that goes down easy and refreshes. This is a simple brew that's quite tastey and easy drinking, especially during the summer. The mouthfeel is good. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This isn't my favorite Brooklyn brew, but it's very drinkable."
"Light body, with an appropriate amount of carbonation. Pretty simple and easy to drink, especially with a low ABV. Not a bad beer at all, and seems to fit well in the summertime mode."
"Not much going on here to make it stand out - too bready without much else. A run-of-the-mill summer wheat beer at best."
"Not a bad beer, but there's a watery feel that turns me off. Still, it's a nice amber color with a caramel malt profile and light cascade-like hops. So for a summer ale, it has malt and hops, the problem is just that there isn't quite enough of each. I feel like this might be better enjoyed outside in the heat, but inside it comes off like craft beer-light."
"12 ouncer with best before dating notched onto the side of the label, pours medium golden amber, clear, near white head and leaving minor lacing on the glass. Fruity, sugary nose. Dry, crisp summary creation. Quite dry in the finish, with notes of wheat, earthy hops and toasty light malts. Decent summer quaffer."
"The taste was a solid blend of grassy hops and a malty wheat. There was a subtle musty flavor, along with some notes of citrus and pine. Mouthfeel is clean and crisp. Overall it's not the best seasonal Brooklyn, but it's still worth a try."
"This brew poured to a dark golden yellow color with a fair sized white head that had good retention and did leave a little lacing along the sides of the glass. The aroma while possessing some wheat like characteristics seem to have a pretty good amount of hop scent. The flavors have a number of noticeable things, wheat flavor, toasted flavors, some citrus and a lasting, but mellow, hop flavor at the back of the mouth. I really wonder if they are trying this one to be similar to Hop Sun from Southern Tier? It is a ok beer, a good one for the summer months but really does not seem overly interesting. I would get it again but do feel that it is one of Brooklyns more basic choices."
"It seems more and more that summer ales are just too light for a good session beer. I think they're trying to market these beers to people who really don't like flavorful, full bodied beers. It seems that brewers are adding citrus taste to mild tasting beers to sell these. Oh well...."
"For a summer style ale this is quite quenching without compromising any of its flavour. Brooklyn brewery seems to offer a good product."
"Easy to drink summer time fun in a bottle. I prefer Brooklyn's Pilsner when the weather is hot but this will do just fine."
"Skeptically picked up a 6-pack at Green's-Midtown. Poured into a pint glass, and the golden-straw colored ale was topped by a nice fizzy, fluffy white head. The head slowly dissipates after a few sips. Smell of faint wheat malt with a slight whiff of cucumber. Tastes like a well balanced hybrid of an american pale ale and a wheat ale with a zesty, slightly fruity finish. An excellent summer beer, in my book, and I could easily have 5 more."
"Pours a slightly hazy amber-copper color with an inch of white head on top. Looks pretty solid. Nose is quite mild, hints of wheat and some citrus fruit. Some saltiness, maybe a little astringent up front. I could do with a little more malt presence or stronger lemon. A hint of hops at the end. It's a fairly subtle flavor, even to the point of blandness. Feel is a little thin bodied. Overall, this one's alright, although there are much better Pale Ales out there."
"Crisp and refreshing at the opening of the sip, and not nearly as bubbly as I feared. Late breaking wheat taste is easy on the palate. Recovers nicely from a substandard outward measure. Definitely could be consumed in quantity in the summer months, particularly outside. Worthy of the Brooklyn moniker."
"Light golden body with lots of bubbly carbonation. The smell is strong in the grassy grains over a light texture of wheat, similar to a classic pilsener. Light in the mouth and quite easy drinking with a sharp bite of carbonation and just a hint of bitterness at the finish. Very different from your stereotypical ""summer ale"" by staying away from the citrusy fruits that we are accustomed to. Not bad, just not what you would expect from the style."
"D. definately a session beer."
"12oz bottle from Lou's in Augusta. Light amber almost yellow body with a thin film of off-white head. Citrusy hops and caramel malt equally share the aroma, though it's not overpowering. Biscuit malt plays a big role, with some citrus hops in the background, along with hints of a mint-like quality. Again, not overpowering. Light in body making this very drinkable. All around enjoyable light summer beer, though having enough good flavor and aroma to satisfy. One of the best summer beers I've had."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- *Extremely* puffy and fizzy in the mouth... disappointing and unlike any other offering I can recall from BB."
"Eeeh... It's beer. A blond alte style that is basically dull and problematic that is modestly improved by a slight wheat addition. Curious as to why a brewery the caliber such as Brookly would even bother. The beer pours a brightly colored straw with active carbonation that is held below 7-up status by the wheat texture. Smells half malty, half grainy and with a light lemon-gass note. The flavors closely mimic the aromas with emphasis on the light malts. The feel is light, and kept from watery by the wheat additions. Fairly clean and crisp in the finish with a light grain-hust astringecy and hoppiness. It's a fine hot-weather brew, but does not inspire any deep thoughts or contemplation."
"Eric"
"Pours a clean, clear amber color with a two-finger head which dissipates slowly leaving a nice amount of lace along the glass. The aroma is floral but biscuity at the same time. No citrus, but some faint light fruit scents. A subtle earthy feel to it all around. The taste is clean and refreshing, with distinct wheat beer notes. Some yeasty character as well, with a decent hop balance. I'm not sure of the ABV here, but there's a slight alcohol pang in the aftertaste that I could do without. But for the most part it's a very tasty beer. Not too complex, but to the point and refreshing. Mouthfeel is nothing to write home about, but it's an entirely drinkable beer. And true to its name, this is a great summertime session beer. Just don't go in with super high expectations and you'll be relatively pleased."
"Nothing earth shattering about this beer...but for something I can get at the bodega at the end of my block it's pretty awesome...great for just kicking back on a lazy hot night"
"Notes: I had it with grilled teriyaki shrimp skewers with pineapple over a mesclun greens salad, and it was a decent match for such a light meal. Not a terribly interesting brew as far as taste or nose goes, but as a light, easy drinking summer ale it fits the bill."
"On tap at Mammosers in Hamburg,NY.Poured from the tap a dull light to medium golden a thin white head sat atop not much retention to it,light toasted grain aromas with a faint citrus note but its really faint.Crisp and dry toasted cereal grain-like flavors with a mild citric quality showing thru in the finish.Kinda boring to another run of the mill summer ale I suppose."
"Overall: Just a plain, non exciting brew that isn't quite an American Wheat, but doesn't fit anywhere else. A little below average, won't go back."
"Brewed and bottled in Utica. First saw this last year at Croxley's Ale House on Long Island as a draft-only beer. The bartender did not know much about the beer, except that it was called a ""summer ale"". I did not review it then as it was dark in the bar and I had been drinking other beers beforehand. This is basically Brooklyn's Light Dinner Ale (2 reviews listed; aka Croxley's Blonde Ale - 1 review listed) put into a bottle. Pours a clear, bright gold with a nice white head. The English malt gives it a faint bready smell and flavor. At 4.5% ABV, it is an easy drinking light-bodied beer. The flavor will not knock your socks off, but it does finish with a clean, crisp, lemony-citrus bitterness that reminds you are not drinking a macro lager. Not meant for the beer-geek crowd by any means, but it should make its way into some coolers during the warm summer months."
"Actually quite crisp and clean. Again, this is not a bad beer, but it doesn't seem to fit the style."
"Pours transparent yellow with almost no head. Looks much like a maco lager. I could barely pick up a malt smell to it but I guess it was there. The taste is pretty average. Sweet carmel malt and it finishes very clean. Mouthfeel is low carbonation with a medium weight body. Somewhat watery and goes down smooth. This is pretty drinkable and I bet it would be a great transition beer for the BMC drinker (since they are so similar)."
"Yes, this is a ""summer type"" of beer. Yes it is light and drinkable. Other than that, I can't say much about it. I hate to say it, but it's a bit of a disappointment from Brooklyn. Usually they produce some great brews... this one just doesn't impress. I know the label says Ale, and BA says american pale wheat... but I swear that If I tasted this blind, that I'd guess it was a continental lager, and a mediocre one at best. The one thing that this beer does well, is it will appeal to many of the uninitiated, and welcome them to the world of good beer, and great Brooklyn products. Other than that... I won't be buying it again."
"12 oz bottle poured into a standard pint glass. Appearance was a hazy golden yellow- typical standard ""summer ale"" colors. Smell was of citrus fruits most noticeably, lemons. The taste was light and fruity- not much going on here- highly carbonated. This is a sessionable brew with the 4.9% ABV, but this one lacks character and distinction."
"Pours a clear golden,with a fluffy head. Not much retention or lacing. Smell is of weak citrus. Body is light with some carbionation. Taste is of light citrus up front,with a bitter finish. This beer was disappointing. Average,but just barley. I would not drink it again."
"D - Good session beer. Not much seperating it from the other Summers I've had; a lot less phenolic than the Saranac."
"The lower abv. fits the busy summer season. On the go this beer won't way you down, it does the quenching thing after a mow and even the macro-friends will handle and like this brew."
"Yet another Americal pale wheat that dares to be unoriginal. It's easy enough to drink, but doesn't even begin to challenge the palate. This is one of those wide-open styles that seems to invite (if not embrace) varied interpretations - yet many still brew these plain renditions. This particular beer is well crafted, but thoroughly uninspired - as are many in the style."
"I was not expecting a light style beer at all. The Brooklyn Summer Ale tasted a lot lighter than Sam Adams' Summer Ale with a little more clean water and no perceptible hint of alcohol. This beer would be good for lounging around while watching the Dallas Cowboys trying to play tough with the Phili Eagles like I did today with a roast beef hero."
"The first I have heard of this one, and AJ said it was brewed specifically for the Clark's Ale House real ale fest. People were not rushing to it, Medium mouthfeel, on the sour acidic side,though above average hoppiness and quaffable.Light pale colour."
