"Appearance: Hazy gold with a finely bubbled 2” of white foam cap that dissipates to thin film. Smell: very bready, fresh baked white bread Taste: rich malty sweet fruit with a gentle hop accent and a slightly dfry finish. Mouthfeel: Medium body and carbonation."
"Saya review is optional. It is not"

""
""
"Just a great overall taste. Not very hoppy, but just rich and flavorful. Love it"
""
""
""
"Overall: While the carbonation in a can is higher than might be stylistically appropriate for an EPA, it is an exceptionally drinkable medium-body beer with great flavor characteristics. Don't expect the huge hop profile that you would from an APA... it is a true EPA in that regard."

"One of the cleanest tasting beers I've tried. The beer pours a light yellow with a very thin head. The smell is pine from the hops and then a bit of a bread scent. The taste was very clean with focus on the hops in the beginning leading to a lot of great citrus notes. The finish had a nice bite with little aftertaste which was very refreshing."

"This is just a straight up solid beer. Decent body and good finish. I'm not crazy about hops but this could use a tad more. Still, just a very very decent beer."

"Poured a light copper, almost Amber with a thin head of light foam. Aroma was spicy with a sweet fruit note. Great carbonation helped bring out the bitterness of the hops very well and finished with a sweet caramel flavor.  Very nice and refreshing."

"Overall: As for an EPA, more earthy and fruity notes would be good."

"Overall: Looks better than it tastes. I bought a six pack of cans for taking to the golf course or drinking on the riding mower while cutting my grass. More than good enough for that (better than the typical Yuengling or Heineken you find in cans), but I think I'd rather buy Six Point in cans for that for now on."

"O- enjoyable unique pale ale"
""
"O - This is a pretty good little pale ale. If the metallic taste that is running loose would just go away, I'd rate it higher. I have several more cans and I won't be giving them away however."
""
""
""

""

"Overall, this is a Pale Ale that is simple yet has a wide array of style appropriate flavors and aromas."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The body is medium but finishes lighter, while the carbonation level is spot on middle for the style. A slight warming well after the swallow leads to a bready, thistle flavored aftertaste."
""
""
"Though the classic and understated complexity of classic British versions, it quite accurately portrays the shell of what proper English Pale Ale does so well- just a glimpse, but a glimpse will do!"

"If you can find this beer on tap, I highly recommend it. If not though, the can still keeps the elements in balance and is a perfectly good session beer as long as you don't mind the price."
""
""
"Pours a hazy orange-brown with a foamy tan head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grape juice, and slight herbal aromas. Taste is much the same with malt, fruit, and some charcoal like flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and dry mouthfeel. Overall, this is an average beer with an odd charcoal quality that reminds me of burnt steak."
""
""
""
"Overall: Solid pale ale. Not remarkable, but it's not trying to be either. This would pair well with most food and is a perfect choice for a backyard party or cookout. I got this in a mixed six and probably wouldn't run out to get a whole six pack unless I was having people over and wanted a likely-to-please craft ale. But I'd certainly throw it in a thematic ""American Pale Ales That Aren't Wacky-flavored Or Mondo Alcohol And Are Pretty Decent"" mix."
""
"Nice Pale Ale with solid Hop presence. Has a real nice smooth and refreshing taste. I would suggest it to a friend, I don't see myself bragging about it though. Not enough complexity. Would session very well~"
""
""
""
""

""
""
""

"The aftertaste is clean as well, and it lingers long and nice. Overall, a competent pale and a refreshing drink."

"This beer has a big, crisp bite and a certain brightness, though it gets a little too heavy in the prickle at times and could be somewhat cleaner. It certainly is bright, and there's a layer added with some dryness easing in lightly, but smoothness is affected."

"Overall / Drinkability: Tasty beer. Not sure I'd want another one right away, but I wouldn't mind having it again, or having a full pint vs. a 12oz glass. Went well with food (parsnip soup, grilled cheese sandwiches) and I think it might go well with other food as well."
"Taste-Subtle toasted malt, white grapefruit-rind bitterness-nicely balanced, flavorfull and sessionable."

"Pours a deep reddish orange with tiny white head. Floral and malt aroma with hints of sweet fruits (cherries?). Taste follows with big floral flavor on top of some cherries and bland malt flavor (malt extract?). Medium light mouthfeel with medium carbonation. Not a bad beer, but not one to seek out. Tastes very much like my first homebrew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A good pale ale that drifts away from the standard ultra-piney hop aroma/flavor that one expects from more American styled pale ales."
""
""
""
"Nice , enjoyable beer. Not one that I am rushing out to fill up my fridge but would drink it again if offered on tap."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a beef up English Pale Ale. Less sweet and more hoppy than its inspiration. I did like this American interpretation. Very sessionable."

"Tasted mimicked. more of a malt backing than hops. I am guessing English style pale ale."
"O-I liked the beer enough but I don't think I'll buy it again soon; though I'm always glad to try new beers."

"notes: awesome beer, love it!"

""

"Overall 3.5: Good beer, but nothing that extraordinary. What really sets it apart for me is its dryness. This is a pervasive dryness that is felt at every level of the taste. While this beer is not suited (IMHO) to a good session, it is excellent with food. I imagine it would also be great with seafood, particularly heavy, fried foods."

"O- Solid Pale. Great alternative to over citrus peeled summer beers."
""
""
"O - Just a quality beer. Nothing that blows me away, but something that I would enjoy drinking pretty much any time."
""
"Overall, a rather tasty APA that shows some balance and doesn't eclipse the malt with hops - not that there's anything wrong with that."

"O: The malt is balanced by the hops. It's a good beer. I found it sessionable. Good first beer of evening or with pub fare and comfort foods. *(grilled burger on pretzel roll, heirloom tomato, grilled peppers, garlic, asparagus, mushrooms)"

""

"O: This pale ale lands toward the larger end of today's spectrum. The sturdy malt backbone is balanced well by a confidently assertive hop profile. It's a good beer, but it's size and substance make it more of a one-and-done type of brew than a sessionable option. Perhaps not quite as approachable to the neophyte as you'd want a flagship beer to be, but it certainly has its place. It's a good pairing option for pub fare and comfort foods."
""

"O: Just a so-so pale ale. Nothing I would grab again."

"12 ounce bottle poured into a Unibroue tulip. Best buy November, 2012. Hazy copper body, off white head, moderate retention. Clear lacing, sticky. Aroma includes earthy bitterness, some caramel sweetness. Taste is slightly bitter with slight sweetness on the back end. Really not a bad pale ale, just nothing too memorable."

"Easily a go-to day-to-day beer which I enjoyed several times during a relaxing weekend while on Nantucket."
""
""
"Served from tap into a sampler tumbler. Poured golden yellow-orange with a one finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount very slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, earth, earth hop, spicy hop, and subtle milk chocolate. The flavor was of sweet malt, earth, fruit, earth hop, and skunky hop. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a fairly average brew. Out of the pale ales that I had in this sampler flight this was my least favorite of the bunch. The skunky note I picked up on in this one really wasn’t that pleasant at all and really took me back at first. As it warmed this became a little more sharp. Also the milk chocolate note on the nose felt a little out of place as well. I think this brew might have had an identity crisis if I am honest and didn’t know what it wanted to be when it grew up. Worth trying, but I doubt I will be having it again."
""
""
""
""
""
"A middle of the road pale ale. Could use more hop character"
"Pours a golden amber with a light head on top, more like surface slush. It also has a murky and hazy clarity. Aroma is also malts with very little in the way of hops. Taste is malts and sweet at that. I wasn’t very impressed with this one. Made in the English tradition, I’ve try to take that into account but I think it lacks depth of flavor and in fact think it quite borish"
"This was OK"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a decent but simple beer. It has decent balance and decent drinkability. I think there are probably better pale ales out there so I probably won't be picking this up again, but it was good once."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A solid but unremarkable pale ale."
"Overall-- I actually rather enjoy this beer. It is quite sippable and sessionable. It isn't the most flavorful beer out there-- but it is certainly a quality beer. It would make a good crossover beer for a BMC drinker."
""
"Poured into a Pint Glass ...Dark Amber in color - one of the darkest Pale Ale's I've had. Great fruity aroma hits your nose well before the beer hits the mouth. The taste is thick on the tongue with a nice lingering hop taste. This is an EXCEPTIONAL Pale Ale."
""
""
""
""
"First sip is minerally, sweet, and lightly hopped. A malty-style pale ale. There is a definite mineral/earthy quality to this brew. Overall pretty unexciting, but no real flaws to speak of. Probably wouldn't get again, but I wouldn't complain if it was the only thing to drink at a party."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I didn't know what to expect here, but I think this is quite a successful representation of the style. In addition to that, it's a pretty tasty and satisfying beer in its own right. Good stuff!"

"O: Decent. Nothing tremendous, but decent."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – An OK brew, but nothing really all that special."
"O: Not the greatest pale ale I have ever had, but not bad. Does a good job of distinguishing itself as a Pale Ale opposed to an IPA or a cross between. Would not seek this beer out again though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy amber with a dense off-white head that settles to a inch-thick cap. Mild aromas of English toffee, caramel, and yeasty bread. Very clean and crisp. Taste is similarly clean and simple, with more mild breadiness, sweet caramel, and a touch of herbal hops. Mouthfeel is light and sharp, with a medium body and good carbonation. Overall another easy-drinker from Cisco, masters of understated and sessionable beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"M- Full bodied, as far as palate coverage goes, but very sort lived/ front-loaded. Great carb. Spatially balanced but temporally over-eager."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A great pale ale that I will pick up more often. An easy drinker and light enough to be quite sessionable. Not a first choice, but one that I would still recommend as a second choice to someone at the bar."
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is good- medium light body, moderate carbonation, but that weird tang kinda does something to the drinkability. Overall I'd say this is a decent pale ale but lacking direction."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a nice beer. Wish that it was know when it was bottled. So that I knew if I was drinking the beer fresh or not."
""
""

""

""

"This beer pours out a hazy orange color with two fingers of head. The aroma is sweet and bready, with some fruity and herbal hops. The taste is smooth and bready, with a bit of prickliness and fruitiness from the hops. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied and easy-drinking, and the drinkability is good. It's a solid English style pale ale. Won't blow your mind, but it's a good drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is very enjoyable and very easy to drink, I find it to be extremely well balanced. This would be a great summer beer for drinking at cookouts. I could easily pair this beer with lots of different foods. Definitely sessionable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: this is a pretty good brew that was balanced all around. Yet, it may be nothing to scream about, its still good. I would have this again."
""
""
"O- Pretty much ordinary across the board. A good session beer."
""
""
"O: My experience with ""English"" pale ales is very limited. In fact this might be the only one I have had. However, even if this beer does in fact stay true to this particular genre of beer, I still must say that I disliked it based on the taste alone. But since it is getting some high reviews, Im going to give it a few points based on the fact that I must be somewhat ignorant to this style and therefore cannot completely accurately rate it."
"O- If this tasted better it would be an awesome beer... Didn't mean to state the obvious"
""
""
"12oz bottle, pours amber in color with a foamy beige head, decent retention and lacing. Aromas are bready malt, caramel, and herbal hops, very earthy. Tastes are bready, earthy, herbal, caramely, peppery, rye, citric, leathery. Mouth-feel is medium bodied with ample carbonation, smooth, creamy, finishes bitter and overly dry. Overall, nice complexity, I'm not a big fan of the herbal characteristics, but this was pretty good, and what I'd expect from the style."
"A tasty ale for the long term. Full disclosure: After my first sip I was ready to commit the unthinkable: chucking out the 12 pack into the trash. But this beer grew on me. By my fourth can in as many days, I was a respectful admirer. Tastes like the sun dried leather tethered to a harpoon after a day long Nantucket sleigh ride ;) Proof that change is constant and that if you open your mind your palate will follow. P.S. The color is amazing. Authentic copper with a bit of haze."
"Not a bad beer overall, easy to drink and pretty classic to style. Not one that I would seek out however. Just a bit lackluster in this tasting, but don't let that stop you from trying it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I poured this one into a pint glass. It has a nice golden copper body with a 2' foamy head. The smell is of citrus and some malts. The taste has more malt than hop to my taste buds, nothing out standing. The mouthfeel is good and overall this is a ok beer."
""
"a pretty good pale ale. pours a hazy copper color with a rather small off white head. smells crisp and refreshing, lemony hops and a healthy dose of english malts lends a nice light doughy smell. flavor is refreshing too, a nice pale ale for springtime. the english malts give it just enough body, but the hop profile is the star here. a little fruity without being sweet, and crisp without being at all bitter. excellent with a grilled veggie burger. full enough body to stand up to all kinds of food, i will buy this one again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drink- It's a tasteful little pale ale. Has a nice rounded flavor and lends itself to the malty english note which I expected. I would take another bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very solid. Pretty tasty and not too pricey. A nice session ale that won't rip your taste buds off but that still has a good crisp taste."
""
""
"O - I support this brewery whenever I can because of the great times I have had at the brewery while visiting on Nantucket. This is a very respectable flagship beer from Cisco in what I consider to be an underrated style. I think it is a bit thicker than I would like from a beer that claims ""perfectly suited for your next session"" but I would definitely drink a few. The all-blue can stands out among the rest and I appreciate the simple artwork. Very well done from Cisco Brewers."
""
""
"While not a session beer, this is definitely sessionable, but at 5.6 that doesn't mean go drink 12 of them."
"Overall, unique pale ale. I would called it lighter style of a brown ale. It reminds me of Olde Burneside Ten Penny Ale, which certainly isn't a bad thing."
""
""
""
"Overall its a solid beer. Nothing groundbreaking, nothing over the top or special about it, just a good pale ale like it claims to be."

"Don't know how old this could be, date is smudged on the bottle, but it's only been in the market for a couple months."
"Overall: A well-made English Pale Ale. Nice balance."
""
""
"D - Great tasting drink; smooth around the edges and very enjoyable; malt flavors touch of hops keeps this beer well-balanced and enjoyable no matter what time of day or meal"
""
"thought this beer would suck but not bad whatsoever. my favorite english style ale yet to date. could definitely suck down a few of these subtler flavored brews."
""
""
"O - this is an excellent choice for a refreshing drink"
"NICE, MUST HAVE!"
""
""
"Soft resiny palate bitterness, upfront and throughout. Some minerl malt biscuits and piney, citric hops mix up for a classic Northeastern American Pale Ale. I'm glad I tried this beer, but the Northeast has nothing on the Midwest."
""
""
""
""
"This is an alright take on the style, but nothing I'd seek out. A little too easy-going and lacking in any assertive malty flavors, and certainly not hoppy ones."
""
"This has a surprising amount of complexity. I hate to say it, but this reminds me of Bass, just with more depth. It's not as good as Ipswich Ale, but I'm glad to know that this beer is worth drinking. This would be great with food."
""
""
""
""
"O - drinkable Pale Ale. I like that it is local, and in a can. Nothing special, but nothing bad either."
""
""
"Looks nice, slightly hazed amber color. Darker for a pale ale. Off white head with so-so retention. Interesting smell: blend of caramel malt and slight hop character. Smells like an English yeast strain. Flavor is kind of undefined and all jumbled together. Some citrus fruits from hops, yeast is floral and quite flavorful. Suitable bitterness. Complimenting acidity, Kind of thick for a pale, and Sweet. Mouthfeel has an odd ""twang"" at the end. In general the flavor arrangement pretty muddy. I'm not in love with this beer, but its pretty good."
""
""
""

"O: Overall it’s an average ale with very little to it...Not too impressed, but it goes well with my food. 3.0"
""
""
"A good into to Pale Ales if you are looking to get you or a friend started with Pale Ales."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a solid pale - I DO plan on buying this again. This would be a great boat beer in the spring time."
""
"(O) Solid pale ale. Not as hoppy as some of the pale ales that I've had recently or what I've been used to, but it's very crisp and quite refreshing. Seems to have a bit more to the flavor profile and is a well rounded beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Thin tan head that levels quickly with a light webby lacing. Medium-dark brown body. Nose fresh cardboard with a little musty peach, like when home brewers use cheaper dried yeast. Taste is similar, though with more of the peach character and a white wine tartness. Bitterness is very sour and doesn't balance well. A little dry. I am not a fan, though I'll give the other brews a try."
"O: I really enjoyed this beer! Subtle complexity that keeps it very drinkable. Could drink this year round and will definitely buy again!"
"Maybe I had a bad batch, or maybe this just isn't my type, but I really did not like this beer."
"Pours a clear amber with a creamy off-white head. Smells of sweet toffee. Taste is toffee up front, followed by some earthy floral bitterness. Sweet candy finish. Mouthfeel is rich. Overall quite good. It does seem to be missing something, perhaps the yeast from tasting just like an English bitter. A very good beer either way though."
"Nice beer very balanced flavors meld nicely into a uniquely british pale ale. Very light mouthfeel. Would be very nice with a meal."
"O – Makes my best of Pale Ale list, I really enjoyed this beer and will be picking this up in the future when available in Denver. Top notch drinkability. 4.5"
"Poured on-tap and served in a pint glass, the beer is a decent copper-amber coloring, both dark and slightly hazy, with a slim, low profile, off-white head. Aromas are rich and plentiful, with a malt caramel presence lightly highlighted by a touch of hops and spice. The beer was smooth, yet light and crisp. Flavors are toasty, while carrying a sweet toffee and caramel backbone and spicy, dry, green hops. The aftertaste is peppery spiced and darkly sweet, balanced very well together. The beer has a quick, clean finish. Smooth and effervescent overall, the caramel-hops blend is unbelievably balanced. Very tasty."
"Overall I can't say it's more session able than other pales but I wouldn't turn it down. Too bad I can only find this at two places, no six packs with a single price of $2.50-$3.50. Ow well."
"This beer pours amoight yellow straw color with a decent head that recedes at a fairly quick pace. The smell is earthy hops with a bit of a malt backbone. The flavor follows suit with earthy bitter hops in the flavor and a good breadlike malt backbone. Tue mouthfeel is fairly light with good carbonation. The is a very drinkable beer on a hot day and a great example of an English pale."
"O: This beer was great. I would absolutely drink this again. It reminds me, strangely, of the kids dessert dirt and worms. Oreos, cool whip and sour gummy worms don't sound like a match but put them together and you have a surprisingly tasty and fun dessert. Cisco took 3 taste spectrums I didn't expect to play too well together, but they really did it perfectly. This beer is damn good. Huge thanks again to Palphen for this great throw in."
"poured from a can into a 4 oz tasting glass"
"Drinkability: Picked this up for $9 for the six-pack in Portland, and it was definitely a good purchase. A highly sessionable and tasty brew, and pretty perfect for this point in the summer."
"O: Nice English IPA, even though I'm not a huge fan of the style. I would keep a few cans around for the change of pace."
"Overall, a decent ale, but I wish a few more handfuls of malt had been added to try and keep the flavors present throughout subsequent mouthfuls."
"O- Very drinkable. Then ice bitterness with the citrus notes makes this a great summertime pale ale."
"RIDE THE WHALE THIS ONE IS A WINNER"
"O: It's a mediocre pale ale. I wouldn't actively seek it out."
"Highlight of this for me was the drinkability - just ridiculously nice mouthfeel. Subtle & refreshing flavors & at $1.99 per bottle - its not bad at all."
"A solid English Pale Ale and from a can, even. I've had this from a 22oz bottle before and I feel like this is about the same experience, although I remember it from the bottle being a little more yeasty (in that English way)."
"D: I could easily drink this again. A great beer for drinking casually throughout the evening. Will be picking this up again."
"Very good example of an English Pale Ale."
"D - I would definitely get this again. Great great great summer beer."
"This copper colored English Pale Ale has subtle notes of citrus hops balanced by breaded malt and toffee with a smooth dry finish. The buttery character of this ale makes it an easy session beer for anytime of the year. Very easy to drink and quite refreshing."
"O: A good solid example of the style. Nice well-rounded ale. Would go great with seafood. I will buy again when I am up in the distrobution area."
"O: Would absolutely drink again but probably wouldn't go out of my way for it."
"Medium body here with soft carbonation. Not a bad pale ale. Good flavors but the aroma seems a little underwheming and deceptive. I'd say a pretty good one to enjoy from the can when you want to just have a beer and not think about it too much."
"Overall- Extremely impressed with this beer. Without a doubt, I will look to find more of this beer..., and you should too."
"A great little english style pale ale. Easy to drink and flavorful, but nothing is overpowering or overwhelming, very much in a good way. A great all year round beer and fresh smash fruit in the bottom would be lovely since everything is blended so well and is subdued. I have to say the price is a little daunting, $9.99 a six? I don't live in nantucket dammit!!!"
"The taste starts up sweet with a slight sour perhaps from an aciduated not doesn't seem like a hop sour. The carbonation comes in and dissipates quickly. The end a hop bitter comes in and finishes."
"Overall, a nice English pale. Not amazing, but if I couldn't get Geary's this would be in my fridge all the time."
"O: I think this beer would be dramatically better if not so watery."
"Overall a nice, if average, pale ale. I'm not sure I had the freshest of bottles, so the aroma and taste may be a little off."
"Pours a hazy pale amber with a thin off white head. Aroma is grainy malt forward with a touch of fruity hops. Some buttery notes in the nose as well. Bready, toffee malt sweetness and slightly citrusy. The butterscotch character is more pronounced in the flavor. Moderate carbonation with a light, crisp body. Great summer sipper beer."
"Nicely carbonated bite, lightly bready, solid maltiness that is never too sweet, and kept in balance by a bitterness that's similar to the nose - light, somewhat floral and earthy at the same time. It's very crisp and clean, obviously quite drinkable."
"Again really English inspired ales coming out of New England, pours a deep slightly hazed copper hue with a bright thicket of light khaki foam arising with large bubbles. Aroma is floral and earthy more so than aggressive and citric. This is really nice a fruity/earthy subtle experience versus the average American pale that borders as an IPA. Nice breadiness from the yeast and malts utilized here, definitely a beer that can be drank in number wouldn't mind the 12 pack of cans for tailgating. I'm sure this one is meant to be consumed fresh. Still has a fair amount of bitterness but it's completely different kind of hop flavor more earthy/floral notes coming out rather than the high alpha acid hops that our beers typically are brewed with. There's almost a layer of brine that brings the sweet malts, floral/fruity notes all together along with the thick crusted artisan bread like notes that I get with each sip from the yeast. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied what a great drinking session ale it really packs in the flavor I'm glad I tried this beer after seeing it in BA mag ads for the past few years, it's about time I scored a few bottles. I paid high end pricing on this but it was well worth it."
"It would be easy to drink a few of this beer. Decent flavor. Full, but not too challenging. I usually like to sample several different beers, but this would be a good one to move beyond the initial heavy focus on smell, flavor, mouthfee, etc. from the first one, to a realize it as a pretty simple yet tasty brew for the rest of the evening. Definitely would fit the bill as a slightly-elevated ABV session-type beer."
" Pretty average pale, but overall very well-balanced and dangerously drinkable."
"drinkable - yep."
"Pours a nice creamy one and a half finger head. Very nice retention, a big ring and a few big bubbles with a slight cap. Hazy golden color. Smells is quite different that the usual pale ale. Very bready, some woody quality, carmel, toffee. Tastes carmel, sweet, some toffee, carmelized almost burnt sugar flavor. Quite different in the finish bready, yeasty, doughy. I'm not sure if I like this but it not the usual earthy, bitter pale. Medium bodied, medium carbing, it leaves a slick oily finish. I could drink only one or two of these in a night. $1.80 a single."
"D. Very easy to drink if the alternative is a ML or the like but definitely not preferred."
"Pours a nice clear orangy brown color, big poof of slightly off white head, decent lacing. Scent is of freshly dried malt, lightly sweet with a good amount of toast and roasted nuts, grassy hops and a his of citrus. Taste is aggressively malt forward with grassy hops playing more of abackground note, more akin to a bitter than English Pale. Medium bodied, good moderate carbonation. A nicely done English style beer with a good malt profile."
"Decent drinkability for a full bodied beer. Would drink again."
"D - very easy to drink. good for a session. if you like rogue's dead guy ale you'll like this."
"Well balanced medium body next to a descent hop combination. I could see having a 3-4of these over the course of a Bruins game."
"Pours amber with a nice head. Has a hoppy and fruity aroma, but you can definitely notice the malty backbone on this one, almost bread like. The beer has a great balance and is really drinkable, probably also helped by the fact that they were in cans. Really tasty, pick some up."
"Whale's Tale is plenty easy to drink. I get the impression this would shine on tap; I'd certainly be more inclined to so drink it. Worth a shot."
"Overall, what was most enjoyable about this brew was the interesting malt inclusions and the beer's simplicity. The nice balance and easy flavor pairings make this a nice selection for a relaxing, sipping brew. If anything, it would have been nice to see a more robust hop character at play with the heavy malts."
"Cheers!"
"I find this be to have average drinkability. It is tasty and goes down well, but it unexceptional. It is above average though. I would certainly drink it again, but since it isn't distributed here in Maine, I won't go out of my way to obtain another bottle."
"Not a bad pale ale, but it's throwing off this macro adjunct vibe that I just don't dig. I have heard good reviews of this beer on tap, so I'll have to try that sometime soon."
"Ordered at joe's in boston on tap. Came in a pint. Had a nice orange with a thin yeasty head. Subtle hops on the nose. A bit watery in the nose even. Very earthy on the tongue. Reminds me new belgium. Almost a bit too grassy. Extremely earthy. Mouth is somewhat watery but has a bift of a kick. Good session for the fans of earthy, not my style."
"D - This beer could be a good deal better than it ended up being. Some carbonation along with some hop aroma would really improve this brew."
"Easy enough to drink and one could justify having more than one of these."
"Drinkability - I could definitely have a few of these on a hot summer day, winding down. Very nice, fresh, crisp and relaxing."
"Great drinkability - after a long day of whaling, it's nice to settle down with Ishmael and have one of these. However, it's still not quite something that would drag Ahab from brewery to brewery in search of his 'great white pale ale'."
"Drinkability is good. I feel bad that I got this in the fall otherwise this would have easily been my summer pick for a pale. Easy to drink a few in a row."
"A beautiful amber with a dense white head with excellent retention and lacing, this is especially gorgeous. The nose has a nice herbal and minty hop character. Specifically, this almost has a little peppermint oil.As it warms, a pleasant malt character appears, the Marris Otter and mild sweetness. The MO character is actually really low. The palate opens herbal and light citrus, along with some light sugar and caramel sweetness. The malt base isn't particularly complex here, this doesn't has the depth I'd expect from a MO-forward beer. Light in body with high carbonation, providing a crisp finish. There's a light bitterness, along with some light hop flavor with citrus and light herbal character. Decent stuff."
"Overall impression: Pretty decent English Pale Ale, quite forgettable as an APA."
"Nothing outstanding here, but a very good session ale."
"D: definitely worth repeated visits"
"Domestic English Pale that captures the style? Hell yeah - I've been looking for something like this for long time. Price is right (relatively cheaper). Cheers!"
"Delicious copper honey colored ale. Sweet candy aroma and taste. Pours with a half inch head that quickly settles. Seems too sweet to be an English pale ale. But I still think this is a fantastic and thirst quenching beer. Gets better as it rests too."
"This was interesting. This tasted English but had a boldness to the flavors that reminded me much more of American take on the Pale Ale style. The deep earth and tanginess of the profile hindered the drinkibility a bit for me but this was still pretty solid overall. Bonus points for the portability of the container. It's good to see Cisco getting on board with this."
"A selection that arrived from the BOTMC, lets give it a whirl. This brew has a great bottle smell of red licorice and malt. Pours to a cloudy bronze amber color with a creamy multi-size bubble head that laces nicely on receding. Taste of this brew continues the licorice flavor. Nice hopping with a bite expected for a pale ale. Sweet for a pale ale with notes of licorice and butterscotch. Mouthfeel is thick and chewy. For a pale ale, not really on the mark, but a very tasty brew. Not really a sessioner with the sweetness but would pair great with a salmon or tuna."
"Had this in a cute blue can, didn't pour it because I enjoy drinking craft beer out of cans just that much. It has a relatively weak but pleasant nose--toasty with citrus hops--and tastes like that too, but very bright and effervescent, with really nice grapefruit, citrus, tangerine against a sweet biscuit malt. All pale ales should be this well-hopped! Carbonation is also perfect, and I would love to reach for this one on a hot summer's day."
"D-Wouldn't want more than two or three but worth a try."
"medium bodied brew, well balanced between sweet malts and fresh hop flavors. if this brew had a malt to hop meter it would be directly in the middle. Easy going in and Easy going down, good sessions brew. pick up a 6'er while you CAN"
"Overall it seems like the only time I rave about pale ales is when they creep in to IPA territory, but if you're looking for something a little more pedestrian you could do a lot worse than this. Because, yeah. I like it. But it's kind of like that plain girl next door with the great personality that you would date, but who you wouldn't exactly go bragging to your friends about."
"This beer's appearance was a copper/amber color & poured with no lace. The aroma was mainly plums with butterscotch & brandy notes. Flavor began as plums moving to vanilla & warm raisin pie. Whale's Tale has a medium mouthfeel smooth over the entire palate. Low drinkability due to being filling & it's alcohol warmth. Try it."
"Beer is medium to light in body, easy drinking nice refreshing beer but its pretty fruity in the midpalate. Overall its decent, I'd have it again if offered to me but I doubt I'd buy it again."
"D: Not a bad little APA, but nothing over the top super. Not a big session beer, just a few will do you. Just be ready this one is a little more on the malty side."
"Taste leans toward the malts and is both sweet caramel and burning toffee. A light to moderate bitterness finishes it off and is accentuated by some toast. This could easily be confused for an amber ale, as hopping overall is pretty light. Keeps is clean and simple. Not a bad brew, I have had a couple tasty offerings from Cisco now."
"Thanks to Shawn for sharing."
"d - A decent APA that is very easy to drink. Would try again sometime."
"D - A fresh, flavorful and fun beer. I was surprised and impressed with this one."
"This is a short and simple review for a simple beer. Not a ton of flavor or aroma, and not a ton of depth. But overall, it's a decent enough drink. Great for a light nightcap or a refreshing summer beer. Not something I would go out of my or trade for, but certainly something I would order on a sunny day in a beer garden."
"Thanks to woodychandler for the trade.Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a caramel color with a 1 inch head. Smell is of sweet malts and hops. Taste is predominatly of hops, some malts, finishes bitter. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this is a decent brew."
"D: Very good - could easily throw back a few of these in a sitting and feel A-OK about it. Love the cans!"
"Fruits shine through this American Pale Ale. Hints of orange and cherry are the main flavors. Mild sweet taste to the beer. Finishes with a little hop and some dryness. A little watery as well creates a light mouthfeel. Not a big flavored APA by any means."
"I like this beer, I don't know if I'd consider it a pale ale due to the fact that I would expect it to be a lighter beer, but still a solid beer, good for summer, could be easily paired with fish and would taste excellent."
"Overall, very nice session beer from Cisco. Well done! I will add this to the lineup especially in cans!"
"The feel of this beer is smooth and goes down well. It is well carbonated but not too heavy and is very drinkable."
"This is a very good beer. Better than I expected for a pale ale."
"Very straitforward and totally refreshing. Not a ""must have"" but on a hot summer day, ""would love a...""."
"D- What a wonderful beer. Cisco made sure their flagship (this is their flaghship, right?!) is one to talk about!"
"Because of this beer's dryness, it lacks a creamy texture I have appreciated in other beers, but is still very smooth with a little of that hops ""bite"" at the finish. My impression is that many people would be happy to drink this beer, but few would be blown away by it."
"Two fingers' worth of tawny head immediately appeared on the pour, bubbling and frothing like the Weird Sisters' brew in MacBeth. The color was a deep orangish-amber with NE-quality clarity. The nose was very orangish, zesty in its scope and intensity. Mouthfeel was medium with a sweet-tart combination on the tongue like a fizzy candy, orange and caramel, if you CAN imagine such a thing. Wild! Finish was still lingering with that same sweet-tart flavor, causing a niggling feeling that I have tasted something like this before, but I CANnot dredge it up. This is definitely going into the cooler this summer!"
"Medium-bodied. Not sure what's up with the carbonation here...it's very aggressive and tingly on the tongue. Like Pop Rocks or something. Wasn't expecting that. Kind of thin. This just isn't a good beer. Not enjoyable at all, and the first drainpour I've had in a while."
"Notes: Certainly not a bad pale ale. Cheers."
"Would I buy more of it? - you bet. This is a great pale ale in a can and tremendously sessionable so its downright perfect for an afternoon on a boat or in your own backyard"
"D: The beer is very easy to drink. The overall taste doesn't stand out as being very interesting where I would want to drink this on its own, although it would likely make a nice accompaniment to a meal."
"D: A wonderful drinkability much appreciated before and throughout a pairing with raw oysters and broiled sea bass."
"Delicious! Amber in the glass with a hint of hazy orange. Keeps a nice white head to the bottom. Taste is malt with subtle hops and very fresh flavors. This is one I go out of my way for, esp if you can find bombers. Smaller bottles seem to be a bit less flavorful and lighter bodied??? Weird but true. Also, not cheap at 7-8 bucks a four pack."
"D- Excellent crisp, slightly bitter pale ale that lends itself to more than one in a sitting. The taste leaves me wanting another even when another beer is calling my name. Beloved."
"This beer was copper colored with a medium-sized tan head. There was a bit of lacing. It had a fruity, sweet malt aroma. A fruity taste, mostly orange. A little bit of caramel, and the tiniest bit of hops that came in late. A nice, middle-of-the road APA."
"Definitely an easy drinker, and it was great to see this beer on tap at a restaurant that I 1) had to wait for a table and 2) did not expect any good beers to be on tap."
"D- Great tasting overall, light sweeter taste. This was my first time drinking anything from Cisco Brewers and it wont be my last."
"Cheers!"
"22oz bomber purchased at McKinnon's split with BA Checkmate. Pours a slightly hazy amber-red body with almost an inch of off-white head that clings to the side of the glass. Biscuity malt shares the aroma equally with herbal hops. Biscuity and caramel malts hit the palate initially, but are almost immediately overwhelmed by really pleasant herbal grassy hop presence, with some butterscotch on the finish. Medium to almost aqueous in body with moderate carbonation. Super-drinkable. Reminds me more of an English-style Pale Ale, but either way this is a super-solid pale ale and an excellent beer all around. Definitely getting this one again!"
"Decent but would not get this again for the money (~$6.50 in Austin, TX)."
"D: A slightly jacked up ABV session APA. At 6.8% you might get in over your head with this one as no real alcohol flavors are noted. Pretty decent and certainly a well-balanced APA."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Not as bold as most APAs I've had. I still think Smuttynose Shoals Pale is the APA to beat. But fantastic balance and an English creaminess to the pale that allow it to be both refreshing and subtly sweet."
"This is the first time I've had it bottled and I like it a lot. But I prefer it on tap -- it's my weekly go-to on Wednesday nights at the Local in West Newton (where inexplicably and admirably, this and Ommegang Hennepin on tap are each a buck less than Guinness)."
"Drinkability: This is an above average pale ale. I like the balck tea taste. I think I could have three but not a six."
"A good beer but I wouldn't call it a pale ale. It's a little too sweet and a little too belgiany to be called an american pale ale. It really tastes more like a belgian pale ale than an american pale ale. It's very good but a little more intense than the positioning might make you believe."
"D - Pretty high. This is actually quite enjoyable despite being only lightly hopped and not very complex. Not a bad session beer."
"All in all, a very nice representative of the style. Good job, Cisco. If I can find this locally, I would certainly pick it up."
"Grabbed a bottle at the Lansdowne Pub. Poured into a standard pint glass. Nice amber color. Lots of carbonation. Fizzy white thin head. Smelled on the hoppy side. Taste was spot on for a good APA. Not too hoppy, but with enough hops to keep your palate awake. Mouthfeel was a nice combo a hops and some maltiness to act as a counterbalance. I was surprised to see this beer listed as a 6.8% abv, as I found it very drinkable. I love to see that American brewers can pull off a great pale ale, and Cisco has done just that."
"Got the 18Oz bottle since I like pale ale and liked the art work on it."
"A nice thick tan head floats atop a hazy amber pint. When I think of Pale Ale, this is exactly what I want to see in my glass. Beautiful. The nose is extremely yeasty with some apple-like fruitiness. The mouthfeel is creamy and as the smell suggests, lots of yeasty fresh bread notes and a nice fruitiness. The finish is fairly long with some dry woody flavors and a nice little fleeting dose of hop bitterness. Well crafted, tasty, easy drinking, and nicely balanced!"
"[couple]"
"This beer pours a slightly cloudy lighter amber with a 2 finger offwhite head. Nice head retention throughout, and spotty thick lacing left on the glass. Nose is buttery and yeasty with hints of toffee, oak, a faint fruits. Taste starts with a bit of a buttery hint, with a touch of grassy hops in here, then yeast and bready and pale malts, then finishes with the faint oak hint and some pears. Medium bodied, a bit on the higher carbonated side, nice clean and crisp feel to it. This is a nice beer to sit with for a bit."
"Flavor starts with a sharp hop bitterness accentuated by uppity carbonation. As the beer mellows a bit, some toasted toffee malts pull through, but there's an off-note that reminds me of tart fruits--not exactly fitting for the style. A bit of spiced wood finishes with a dry bitterness of raw hop leaves. This beer could use a boost in the malts department, if only to make the body a bit fuller and not so dry on the finish; feels like it's sucking the moisture out of my tongue with each sip. The carbonation could also stand to be toned down a bit. A bit difficult to drink, especially for a style that should go down easily and refresh the palate."
"Sweet and heavy, predominantly honey with some bready toffee. Tastes like a 6.8% abv Pale Ale. Floral hop reigns in the malt dominance. Thick and chewy mouth balanced by lively carbonation. Nice, but more of a winter PA in IMVHO."
"Notes: A good beer. I did expect it to be better,but it was worth a try and I will have it again."
"A 22 bomber, served in a stein-type glass mug. This beer is orange-amber, hazy (being bottled conditioned), with a huge inch-tall head that lasts and lasts. The nose is comprised of sweet cereal notes with some light--very light--grassy hops. Good bitterness in the flavor, but the hop flavor is somewhat lacking; what's there is grassy and earthy. The malt profile is excellent, with a lightly toasty biscuit taste rarely encountered in most US micros. The finish is bitter but not bracingly dry. Good mouthfeel, very crisp and spritzy."
"It was nice to see this available at the new Southern joint down the street (Tupelo); I had forgotten nearly about these guys. I am a fan of the artwork & design, so this added to my anticipation as I poured the bright, orange-gold ale. A decent head for a pale ale, about 1 finger of creamy white head sat for a bit before dissolving down, but leaving a nice stick white lace throughout. The aroma lacked the pungent hop in-your-face that many have, likely since this ale balances malt & hop nicely. Floral hops meet grainy malt met the nose & palate. The sharp, crisp medium-body nature makes this a nice overall summer beer; clean, bright & balanced."
"Overall: Great drinkability, the flavors all play well together!! Nothing is overpowering. Not many complex flavors but what is there is very enjoyable. I really wish this was available in my area!!"
"D: I somewhat enjoyed this brew but seeing as how the only beer store that I know has it is about 25 minutes from me I don't think I'll be making any special trips."
"Drinkability: Probably not a session beer. I feel like it'd sit heavy and make me burp a lot."
"Carbonation was great, and despite not liking the main taste it was easy to drink and if I had liked the tones of this beer I would have definitely been able to put down a few more."
"Love this pale ale. Hops are kept in check and impart lots of great flavor leading to a delicious experience."
"D - A well made pale thats pretty easy to drink has a good balanced taste that makes it easy to want multiple servings worth trying sometime"
"Final Thoughts - Complex interesting flavor from a pale ale makes this one worth at least trying. Definitely a usual for me at one of the local pubs."
"Definitely one I could drink multiples of because of it's light body and fairly plain taste."
"Notes from: 11/12/04"
"Poured a little too cold, but I was thirsty... Good looking brew at any rate. Amber/copper with some chill hazing a a sticky tan foam. Aroma seems balanced. Some floral hops and a light maltiness. Light fruitiness includes apple, pear and an earthiness. Flavour is also well balanced. Dry-ish with solid body, some acid up front and a moderate lingering bitterness. Tastes a bit ""green"" and grassy hop and bit of astringency. Generally inoffensive, and well balanced, but not quite smooth as I'd like."
"Thanks, donkeyrunner, for the opportunity"
"Drinkability: Recommended as a session beer, particularly if you want to get lost in other stuff and rather blissfully keep on sipping without exerting much sensory energy. More going on than the North Coast Red Seal, but not as much fun as Dale's Pale Ale. I'd drink it on draught when I see it though."
"Hv"
"The beer is a decent beer. The color is a clear amber. The smell is very faint. The taste is not over powering either. Just a little bit of hops and malt. Little to no carbonation gives this beer a mellow mouthfeel. Overall, its a nice beer to drink, but its not very memorable."
"Nothing wrong with it, just not a lot right with it either."
"Nice orange color with a bit of lacing. Almost honey colored. Smells sweet but pretty well balanced. It has an interesting flavor - it didn't match what I was expecting. There's a decent hops aftertaste that's not overwhelming like an IPA. I can't think of any complex pale ales, but this one is more interesting than the usual mix. I'd prefer something with more body, but I'd put this on tap at home in the spring or summer. Good beer, I'd recommend buying some."
"D: okay but nothing that would stand out."
"Overall I thought this was outstanding. My first taste of Cisco and I was very impressed. It was light, well balanced and very nicely hopped. I would have no issue with making this one a regular session ale any day of the week."
"D: This is a wholly uninteresting beer, lacking character. It never grabbed hold of me and the taste was simply too thin."
"Drinkability: A bit weak, I must admit."
"Pours a slightly hazed deep orange, coppery highlights, nice big fluffy tan head fades slow and hangs around for a while, some patches of sticky lacing on the glass. Smell is sweet caramel malt, grassy hops, slightly floral. Some piney hops up front, mellow caramel sweetness to the malt, and an almost honey-like sweetness on the back-end. Medium-bodied, nicely carbonated, with a slight chewiness to the beer. I could drink this all night. One of my favorites."
"Poured into a sad little cup at the Gazebo on Nantucket, this poured a cloudy gold with nice off-white foam and good lace. Smells of mellow citrus hops and biscuit, fresh and crisp. It has an energetic carbonation with orange and banana highlights in a bready mix. Highly refreshing, endlessly drinkable, a full feel without loosing the light refreshing quality. The tart edges come out more as you go with some peppery touches."
"From a bottle - Pours a slightly cloudy yellow/orange with a small quickly receding head. Smells of piney hops dominate. First sip is light but refreshing with a nice hop taste balanced with the not too malty ale. Slighty under carbonated but still pretty tasty."
"I would consider this more in line with an English Pale Ale instead of an APA. A good beer none the less."
"Nice amber, a head that sticks round and loves me long time. smellz r lovely sweet maltyness with some fruit-e-ness. Taste tells a different story than the smellz. Strong maltsweetness and big but short hop bitterness strike... leaving a gap in the middle, which actually seems unique. A very nice. A great english/american hybrid pale."
"Drinkability: This can be dangerous (as it is very easy to knock more than a few of these back). At $8.00-$9.00/4-pack, tough to drink all of the time (for about the same price, you can buy the big bottle bomber, but you get less beer -- stick with the 4-pack)."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable and seemingly fresh as well. It doesn't overwhelm on either hops or malt. I would drink it from the tap if I could. A very nice pale ale!"
"D: very enjoyable. sure to have again"
"Full, rich, creamy and satisfying mouthfeel. Very drinkable, good session beer."
"Pours a cloudy coppery brew with little off-white head. A very floral aroma from this particular beer backed by the smell of hops. Tastes much the same as it smells. Too flowery and sweet and not bitter enough for either an APA (as it is listed here) or an IPA (as it was listed at the bar). This taste vanishes quickly and leaves you with a slight malt and slightly lemon like taste. I couldn't even drink one."
"Drinkability: The only thing keeping me from drinking multiple is the price!"
"Drinkability is very good, because of lack of hops, but not good because this beer is way too boring to have more than one."
"Overall, a rather tasty APA that shows some balance and doesn't eclipse the malt with hops - not that there's anything wrong with that."
"Poured with minimal head but good barley smell. Impressed with drinkability and consistancy of flavor as temperature changed but it lacked the hop flavor of a pale ale. 4-pack was quite pricey and would not buy again at that price(11.99). I can see enjoying(while paying) on nantucket or marthas vineyard but it is not in its place in manhattan. Craved more hop flavor after this one being a slight letdown in the hop hit on the tongue. Interestingly brewed under agreement with Ipswich(which has an amazing oatmeal stout)."
"Recommended..."
"Citrusy - almost grapefruit - on the first sip, lots of brown sugar. Malty but very balanced, has a good hop presence as well. Interested in trying some of the others from Cisco."
"Whale's Tale Pale Ale from Nantucket....I can see the Pequod leaving dock now.... A hazy copper color in the glass with a light off-white head. A biscuity malt aroma with slight hoppy undertones and also some sweetness. Not much hops, just enough to balance fruit sweetness from the malt. Pear and caramel in the center, finishing with a quick bitterness. Smooth and drinkable, even a cantankerous old peg-legged tar would agree."
"This was on tap at Moan and Dove. The colors were of a dark reddish-amber with a thin head. The aromas were also thin with malty spices permeating from the drink. The taste was decently bitter but with a subtle punch to it. This made it an approachable APA, but also a bit lacking in distinctness. An almost frothy carbonation was the structure of this medium-body drink. Overall, a bit average American pale ale."
"review: i had this on tap at a local bar and it was really good. i remember a nice malty smell, great malty taste with a good amount of bitterness for a british style pale. not a lot of hoppy taste or smell for me though. not sure about the head because the bartender poured off the foam."
"This is an impressive looking beer. The flavor is decent with a good mouthfeel."
"not all that complex, but simple and very drinkable for APA fans, although moreso when cold than when it warms."
"A solid IPA all around."
"Hazy copper color with a thin white head. Sheets of lace that fall quickly the cap. Smell and taste of caramel malt and tons of bread. Some very mild cirtrus in the finish but nothing spectacular. Nice solid mouthfeel. 6.8% is hidden amazingly well. Not a whole lot to say about this beer. It's a solid maltly APA."
"A nice easy drinking beer with a very surprising 6.8% alcohol."
"this could very easily be styled an IPA. Great taste, truly an exceptional recipe. Love the malty and hopped up finish. Challenges any micro brewed amrican beers which have taken over the landsacape over the last decade. I recomend this beer as a compliment to the fineset meal at your favorite restaurant, or a session beer on Sunday as you wade through the NFL results to the wee hours of the night. Best as it warms to room temperature, very refreshing with a very unique taste, difficult to compare... because it sets its own path. This is what beer is all about. Try it once and you will be hooked. The boys on Nantucket kill with this one. You won't be dissappointed. With Moor porter as my favorite... they have really shown they know what brewing is all about"
"Pours a hazy orange-ish color with a white head. Aromas of hops and a cereal grain. In the taste, grapefruity hops and a mellow malt presence. Mouthfeel fo a hoppy malt, but not too filling and a clean aftertaste. A very nice pale, big hops and a clean end/ finish."
"My wife and I went to a new restaurant ( Burton's Bar & Grill) in a newer shopping complex in CT.This beer was on ""special"" for the evening.Like the other reveiwers it took me by surprise the color of the beer for a ""pale ale"".When I choose a beer I try to pair it with the food I have chosen if I can depending on the beer selection ( which was very good here).This was a very refreshing,great mouthfeel and very good after taste especially paired with a ""panani type sandwich and a chilled cucumber salad.I have had other cisco beers in the past but this one tops them all!"
"I had a 12oz bottle with raw oysters at the Grand Central Oyster Bar in NYC. I didn't really know what to expect, just a standard pale ale I guess. But this surprised me by every metric. First off, it's a lot darker than you'd think, dark copper colored (APA?). The aroma is slightly hoppy but very rich with malt, very original in its way (kind of like Orval is original, but not with similar flavors to Orval). The flavor was malty sweet and a little citrucy on the back end, with nice carbonation throughout. Very easily paired with raw seafood, nice session beer."
"Overall, this is a very refreshing, enjoyable and well-rounded pale ale that would go perfectly with a variety of dishes."
"What a surprise this beer was. It pours a nice thick frothy head with substantial lacing. It is a nice amber color and the smell is hoppy, floral, and not overpowering. Very enticing smell, color, pour, and head. The taste is very nice. You will find a well balanced, slightly hoppy, creamy, moderately carbonated ale that has a biscuity or bready taste to it. It is medium bodied, and for a beer with a 6.8 ABV, you won't notice the alcohol. I don't detect much in the way of floral overtones, but you can taste some of the hoppy esters as the beer warms. The mouthfeel is excellent. This is a pure vanilla cream on the tongue and very satisfying. The only negative is a overly hoppy aftertaste that becomes a bit more pronounced as the beer warms. This beer is a very good offering and a nice surprise I didn't suspect buying it ""cold"" off the shelf. L'Chaim."
"This beer comes in a kick ass 26 oz bottle"
"D - This is a very nice beer. I had two with a nice meal in Brookline, MA."
"D: Somewhat tasty, goes down easy, not too filling, good kick, nice representation of style but has a lot of EPA influence as well, I could drink a few of these but its not the first that I would choose even within the style."
"This one was not bad overall, and was certainly one of the more unique pale ales that I've sampled. Didn't love it, but was far from hating it. A decent brew that could be tinkered with to up its drinkability, but I have to give it credit for doing it's own thing."
"Overall- $8 for a 4 pack and definitely worth it!"
"Bottom line: This is a very good APA and I particulary like how neither the hops nor the malt dominates the flavour. I recommend it."
"There may well be times when taking apart a beer for its elements loses sight of how good it works in the aggragate. This is just a solid beer. I'll leave it at that."
"Thanks to cburian for including this as part of my Secret Bunny '07 package."
"A wonderful brew. Categorized here as an APA - claims on label to be an English-style Pale Ale - truth is probably somewhere in between - an American Pale Ale with definate English influence. Easy to drink - I was very surprised to learn of abv level - alcohol very well covered, with a lasting, fruity flavor."
"Overall this is one of the best APA's Ive ever had. Its not a style I would drink all the time. Very nice to have one once and a while. I would love to find this on draft. Highly recommended."
"D - I guess it's decent pale ale, just not what I like. I'm sure if i were at a bar I could have a couple of these, but it's not something I'd be seeking out."
"Poured a hazy orange brown hue from a 12 oz bottle. Off-white head that dissipated rather quickly. Light lace left behind in the pint. Smells of caramel malt and a subtle malt sweetness. Certainly has a nice rolling mix of hops and caramel malts in the aroma. Mild hints of the hops are present in the back of the nose. Nice flavor in the mouth. Smooth malt flavors up front followed by a nice balance of hop tones on the tongue. Hints of fruit and caramel tones are present in there as well. This is a well balanced and very drinkable beer. Enjoyable brew that I would certainly drink again."
"good drinkability, and a good pale ale that i wish i had tried sooner. i'm going to try and make this a staple."
"Well, my huge bottle didnt have the cool painted label ... wish it did. Anyway, this poured with a copper color and thin, but lacing head. The citric aroma tended more to the grassy or dull grapefruit side than the flowery fruitiness of other American pale ales. Musty and almost sour, this beer draws from a less-glorified family tree than the pale ales that have become most prominetn. This stays down the lane dominated more by earthen flavors than flowered ... sour seedless grape, honey, that alcohol-free grape juice mascarading as champagne stuff, bit of pine. I favor beers in this vein, but you have to be prepared. This would be AWESOME with a nice fish and chips ... making my mouth water thinking about it. (#2671, 1/28/07)"
"D: Not a great tasting American pale ale but drinkable."
"A nice simple british style/americanized pale ale."
"Had this on tap at the Rose and Crown Pub in Nantucket last night. The first round had a very slick mouthfeel that was accentuated by the low carbonation with a dominant malty character. Upon the second round pour, the keg emptied and a fresh one was tapped. The new keg was much better. Carbonation was improved and the hops came out to better balance the brew. Inviting cloudy amber color and very drinkable. I consumed 4 before I had to get back on the boat. Paired nicely with a mussel appetizer and breadsticks."
"Multiple growlers purchased at the brewery on Nantucket. This beer has a very soft and subtle malt flavor with more floral than bittering hops and a hint of banana fruitiness. Mouthfeel is luscious and creamy. Have had this beer on-tap at many locations including the brewery and have also enjoyed it in the 12 and 22oz bottles. My advice is to seek this beer as fresh as you can get it, and you will never tire from the delicate flavor and creamy mouthfeel. Older samples do not compare."
"Really looking forward to the rest of it later this coming weekend!"
"Very biscuity (due to yeast) with a sour taste of grapefruits, this one underwhelms. Mouthfeel is way off, as there is so much carbonation, that the beer keeps expanding in your mouth, leading to a rather unpleasant experience."
"Although the presentation is a bit odd from the color and haze, this is a tasty beer and I'd be pleased to have another pint - in a real glass this time please!"
"I had this on tap at Bayzo's pub at Ocean Edge Resort in Brewster. A swanky place that you end up paying for, and at 7.50 a pint I didn't have too many, but it's dam good."
"Overall a nice APA. Nothing spectacular, but a nice understated example of the style."
"Though this is a quality pale ale, it does not stand out as anything special."
"Poured a slight hazed burnt orange with some chunks and floaties swirling about with a creamy-like slight off-white head.Fruity estures in the aroma along with some caramel/biscuit malt with a lighter herbal note.Very English hop profile quite fruity and herbal in its character with a big caramel base with that herbal note in the finish.Well if you like English style pales this is your thing,for me its quaffable but not my style,saying that its a decent beer to be had."
"The aftertaste is bitter but is very characteristic of the genre. Nothing overbearing. Smooth and clean. I could dig downing this at the beach. I guess brewers from Nantucket wouldn't have it any other way I guess."
"M & D: Mouthfeel is very good on this offering from Cisco. Very smooth with a fresh light taste, but yet full bodied. Drinkability is good on this beer. Very nice tasting offering from Cicso provided you get it on the island on tap or in a growler, otherwise buyer beware."
"Murky amber color with a giant head. Takes a while to settle down. Nice thick swashes of lace remain on the sides of the glass. Smells earthy and muddyt. A bit too strong of an aroma but the negativity associated with the scent doesnt seem to get in the way of the taste. Nice smooth well balanced british style pale ale. Maltiness and caramel upfront with a good amount of hoppiness to keep it from being syruppy. Seems like it would be good with a lot of different types of food. Pretty smooth and drinkable."
"Cisco Whale's Tale pours cloudy at first, then clears to a nice amber color, with an appetizing head. Nice aroma -- lots of grain up front, with just a touch of hops. The hops come out in the taste, and they're nicely balanced with the malt. The grainy taste of the malt mirrors the aroma of the beer, but the hop flavors are much more pronounced that in the aroma. Overall, though, this beer sits on the front of the tongue, with a slight malt sweetness present. The mouthfeel is quite smooth for a pale ale and very nice. With its great balance, smooth mouthfeel, and balanced flavor, this is a beer you could drink all day (or night). Makes a great accompaniment to lots of food, too."
"This brew pours a hazy, cloudy copper-orange color with a respectable ¾ inch head. Nice aromacaramel and toasty smells. Its got a pretty earthy smell, with a light floral hop quality. The smell is of moderate-low intensity, and the taste follows the lines of the aroma. Its a pretty smooth, malty-caramelly, brew with restrained hop character. This is certainly an English Style Pale Ale. Medium body. Tilts to the sweet side of things. All in all, this ones a solid drinking-beer. Its nothing extraordinary, and it reminds me of a lot of respectable homebrews.I can see myself enjoying a few of these."
"D- Tasty and different for a ""pale ale"". I definitely recommend a taste!"
"It does improve as it warms, but so do lots of other craft beers."
"This pours a reddish amber color with a large foamy tan head.The smell is pretty hoppy with a bit of nuttiness.The taste is a nice blend of an IPA hoppiness with enough malt to have a sweet nutty aftertaste.This is a tasty sweet brew that I could have again and again.The m/f is light and well balanced.This is a pretty good beer from Cisco."
"The mouthfeel is thin, and there aren't other flavors that come forward to add interest to this beer. It's easy enough to quaff a pint of this one, but I didn't feel any desire to have another. Luckily, I only bought one bottle."
"Pours a cloudy, golden orange. Nice big, bright white head, good retention and nice lacing. Flowery/herbal aroma, different than what I'd expect from a pale ale, but refreshing. Very yeasty too. Full bodied flavor, nutty and bready. Spicy hops, and a pleasant lingering light bitterness. Nice pale ale, though not a typical pale ale, much more herbal and bready. It's good, though, and recommended."
"Oh well."
"This Pale has a nice creamy yet light, consistant head. Coloring is rich soft caramel. The mouth is fruity bitter with a strong ale taste going down. This ale is refreshing with a noticable hoppy kick but I would classify it as middle of the road variety on the pricey side."
"Over time I've grown fonder of the pales but this was a dissapointment. Not ~bad~ just not as good as I had hoped given the barmaids spectacular recommendation. Dark orange with some reddness, no discernable head but laces lightly regardless. Good hops and sourdough bread on the nose, some citrus, nice complexity and pleasant tone. Really bland, blah, bland bland. Some hoppiness, yes.. some breadiness, yes. Not much zap to it though. The feel was very good if not ideal but the moutfeel has to combine with the taste and it doesn't here. Drinkable but nothing special."
"Mouthfeel is bubbly and smooth. And you can't really taste the alcohol. It feels... wet, juicy. Overall, quite drinkable. Not too heavy, and light enough to want another."
"This makes me want to keep an eye out for this brewery's other brewerings."
"Drinkability is solid. I've had my personal issues with Cisco brews but this one was pretty solid. Good balance for style and not over the top like some of their other beers."
"Overall not even close to worth $7 for a bottle, if this is what this beer always tastes like out of the bottle, I wouldn't even buy this if it cost $7 for a sixer."
"This beer is hard to judge... appears a fairly typical amber color with an average head, nothing out of the ordinary for a pale ale. Smell and taste however are pretty subdued in my opinion. Not enough there in terms of hops, and believe me, I like hops but I'm not a fan of overhopping at all, I prefer the subtle side of things. But this is kind of bland, with a twinge of citrus and pine. On the other hand, I almost would rank the mouthfeel a 5. It's almost cask-like... extremely smooth and light, which makes for high drinkability. If I could combine the texture of this beer with a nice flavorful brew I'd be in heaven... oh wait, or is that People's Pint ESB on cask???"
"Medium bodied, good drinkability."
"Taste is caramel, toffee, and bready. There is some hop bitterness, but not nearly as much as I'm used to in an APA. Nevertheless, I would say that this is a nice session beer (even at 6.8% abv), it is so easy drinking that I could easily have more than one in a night."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1"" light beige head over the light amber brew. Head is dense and foamy, and lacing is very nice. Aroma is slightly sweet pale malts, overrun by yeasty, doughy scent, with nary a hop in sight/smell. Taste is slightly sweet light grain upfront, quickly bowing to a tart middle, and a bit of a crisp hoppy bite to end. Mouthfeel and drinkability both okay. Nothing particularly wows me here, but I'm not driven away at all, either. Worth checking out."
"This is a well crafted quality brew. Nicely balanced and so enjoyable. I will have this beer again soon."
"Orange-ish color, well-carbonated. A thick, foamy, clumping marshmellow of a head forms a pretty picture perfect beer. Some lemon peel cooked in sugar with a crispy cracker-like malt nose -- highlights of more piney citrus and some other fruits. A very lively mouthfeel combined with a spritzy flavor leads to a effervescent, dry feel with a sour earthiness and a mildly tangy bitterness -- all in all, quite enjoyable. Very mild upfront with the light cracker-like malt flavor being the light (but primary) impression. Just ever-so-perfectly balanced. I really enjoyed this."
"Copper appearance. Almost clear. Slight haze is noted. Thin coating of ivory white head. Lacing is adequate. Aroma is pretty thick with the caramel maltiness and nougat like sweetness. Some hops are noted, but not enough. Good aroma anyway. This pale's got some balance. Maybe a little too much balance in favor of malt qualities. But it's a pretty beer overall. The midsection is heavy with caramel and nougat. Some piney hop tones prick the tongue every once in a while. There's a lingering huskiness and bitterness. Not really astringent, but not your typical ""APA"" bitter finish either. Decent enough beer and by far, the best I've yet to encounter from Cisco."
"Cisco's Whale's Tale offers a wonderfully balanced and highly drinkable pale ale with a beautiful appearance. It's full and frothy ivory head eventually settles to a short cap of creamy foam that leaves rings and sheets of lace about the glass; and it's clear amber-copper body reveals glowing highlights of orange. The nose is clean, and a bit subdued for the style, but offers a nice combination of sweetish biscuity and bready malt laced with mildly citrusy and floral hops. A very fine-bubbled and moderate carbonation leaves it smooth across the palate with just a delicate zest on the tip of the tongue. Sweetish, biscuity malts return in the flavor, vibrantly infused with the same citrusy (tangerine, mild grapefruit) and floral hop character found in the nose; and backed by a brisk bitterness that leads to a dry and refreshing finish. Nicely done! This is a really drinkable beer and I'd suggest it as a session beer except for its surprising 6.8% alcohol content."
"Nice golden appearance with a small frothy head. The aroma was very dull. Not a lot of hop presence for a pale ale, but the hops showed up when it came time for tasting it. A nice hoppy taste that is well-rounded by the malts. Easy on the palate and oh-so-drinkable. I found this beer to be very average, but it would make a great session beer."
"Drinkability: A good session beer, but if other things are available, I might move on."
"Comments  I had the pleasure of tasting this one at the Anam Cara pre-party for the 2004 Belgian Beer Fest. A pub full of great beer and great friends; what more could you ask for?"
"My only regret was not buying more of it to hold in reserve as my guests were somewhat elated as to where this came from, did I have more, and could they take a bottle home (even if it was empty)."
"Beer is good. Happy Pale Ale Beering."
"Citrusy hop and flesh fruit aroma is fresh and inviting. Hundreds of streams of carbonation race towards the beers surface. Big, pearl white head holds strong leaving a scattered coat of lace. Slightly hazy, golden apricot colored beer. Tasty citrus flavor is balanced by a mild caramel malt, finish is barely bitter. Body is moderately thick and carries the flavor well. A well done tasty pale ale. I still think $8 for a bomber and $10 a 4-pack is a bit much."
"A beautifully looking beer. Bright and clear, orangey amber in color with a soft carbonation. This beer seems to glow when held up to the light. A thin creamy peachy head tops the beer off and leaves small crests of lace on the glass. A classic looking pale ale. Appealing. The aroma is fruity and light spiced with candied malts. The taste is light and grainy. Very flavorful and finishes with a light and pleasant fruit tang. A musty, earthy hop character is apparent along with some nuttiness. Very nice. Simple and drinkable."
"Big 750ml bottle. Poured a peachy hazy color with typical carbonation for its style. Fantastic aroma, just what a beer should smell like. Anticipated drink was wonderful. Clean mellow fruity taste. Perfect blend of hop and malt flavors. A new favorite in this style. A great beer."
"Ok, once getting past the goofy name, it pours a rocky, lacy cream colored head that settles out over clear softly carbonated deep golden/brassy liquid. Nice breadlike doughy nose with subtle hop tones. The taste is light fruitiness with a toasty edge washed aside by good bittering hoppiness that becomes more apparent as it warms. Finishes nicely balanced without an overbearing hop bite, quite a drinkable ale here."
"Very refreshing and clean tasting. I would be happy drinking this all night. Great version of the style: dead on IMO. One of the better APA's out there. Worth a try."
"A very pale yellow in color with a foamy head that recedes to the edges of the glass which creates a nice lace. Very carbonated. Which is kind of odd after most other APAs I've had recently, but that may have been a result of the tap. It actually made it quite refreshing. The hops were very smooth and mild, sweet too. I also noticed what tasted like banana hiding behind the hops and the very subtle malts. A very good session beer."
"Found a fresh 4 pack of this stuff at a local store was I was glad to see it and picked some up. Poured out an amber/peach color with a nice head that reduced down to lacing. Smell consisted of citrus notes, hops, a little bit of caramel, and some spiciness. Taste was nice. Some citrus notes along with some pine-like hops hit the palate first with some underlying malts and spiciness. Finished a little bit dry. The carbonation was quite good in this brew, perhaps they fixed the problem? This bottle seemed fine to me, but I'll see what the rest of them are lile. A good brew."
"Light copper in color with an orange tinged head. Hops suggesting fruit appear in the nose along with caramel and candy-ish malt. In the mouth the light body is bolstered by moderate bitterness and fine, but plentiful, carbonation. Fairly dry and light in the mouth, and much restrained bitterness with hints of phenols and a metallic note. Very lackluster."
"Mouthfeel is smooth with a mellow malt and light bitter finish. Medium bodied with a nice carbonation level. Very nicely drinkable and a good session beer."
"This pale ale is a nice amber color. There is a descent foamy head which lasts for some time. The smell is a mixture of sweet malt and hops. The taste is a pleasant blend of malty sweetness and hoppy bitterness. This is a beer worth giving a try. Enjoy!"
"Gave this brew a try last evening while at Mahars,. The brew is labeled as a Pale Ale but it did not remind me of one. The brew poured to a golden amber color with a very small white head that broke down quickly and left no lacing. The aromas where of sweet malt with fruity highlights, think I can sense some peach, and a bit of orange scents. The taste is very mellow, starts somewhat sweet with caramel highlights than breaks to some fruity flavors that seem to be a somewhat weird mix, not bad but a bit different. It also has a slight bitterness that seems to complement the other flavors nicely. Over all it is a nice brew, not one that I am craving but will give it another chance in the future."
"The cap came off like a rocket and the head was the biggest i've ever seen. Stong hop flavor though still seemed a little watered down. Extremely high carbonation. I did not like this beer at all. I'd like to give this brew another chance but because it doesn't have a born-on or exp date Im not gonna get suckered into picking one of these again. I'll try it when Cisco Brewers gets smart enough to date their beers."
"cought an obvious off bottle this time. Cap came off with a loud blast. Beer poured very cloudy, super carbonated, huge head that stayed and stayed. off flavors of butterscotch and fusil(sp?) alcohol. Sounds good huh? To bad cuz I was looking foward to try this one. Oh well I will give another bottle a try someday hopefully soon"
"Poured a cloudy copper color with a fizzy and quite thick white head that ended up as a thick film along the top of the beer. Smell was incredibly... interesting. I am not sure what to think of it and am unsure whether this was a bad bottle, however it didn't smell (or taste) bad, just really different. The smell was fizzy and funky like a lambic with the tart berry smell almost of a framboise. But it was distinctly different because the berry was masked by a hop presence not seen in lambics. Taste was much more like a pale ale with a hoppy lemon zing up front with a good toasty malted middle and a incredibly refreshing finish. All in all an interesting beer and one I would try again."
"I'm not so sure I'd call this a pale ale. I'd say it's pretty decent for an amber ale."
"The bottle is nice. Overall the beer is a rather average pale/amber ale. If I find myself on Nantucket I'll give it another shot."
"Grande gracias to running4beer for delivering this, via BiF 4!"
"Lots of thick, out of control, crazy head on this one with nice lacing. Smells of hops and malt and tastes of the same. Lots of carbination starting trouble in the mouth before it settles itself down and behaves. I'm glad I tried this one that called to me from the bottom shelf at Gordon's in Waltham, but I don't know if I would get it again if I had something hoppier to choose. According to their website it was intentionally brewed to be not so hoppy. Some people like less hops, some like more. I'm the later so please grab me a 90 Minute."
"This isn't a bad brew but it isnt a special one."
"Judged strictly as a pale ale, this isnt much of one. Its too fruity and way too carbonated. It actually tastes a bit like a lambic, or a cross between a light ale and a really fruity Belgian (like the 3 Philosophers). The appearance is nice, a cloudy apricot color, with a huge head that looks like sea foam. Smell is extremely fruity, with cherry and apricots, mixed with spice. The taste is very tart (hinting at the lambic style) with the taste of sour apples and limes. The mouthfeel is overly carbonated, with tiny bubbles hitting the tongue. Disregarding style, this beer is intersting to drink, and in properly small quantity, is good. But as a pale ale, it isnt quite right."
"Picked up a bomber of this at Half Time in Poughkeepsie, and discovered that it poured a very foamy--appropriately almost like sea foam given that it comes from Nantucket--but the liquid was clear and amber. The smell is very tart at the outset, with citrus overtones, and not much else, and I was interested to see if the lemony tang would follow through in the taste. It did, to the point that my nose tickled. There's a thin but sharp, almost lambic, tint to this pale ale. I'm not really sure what to say because the Whale's Tale Pale Ale is a truely unusual experience. It almost tastes like soy sauce, I think. Interesting."
"A big thanks to noclueaboutbeer for hauling this one out to Kansas all the way from Connecticut."
"750ml bottle: Boy, did this have some carbonation to it. It acted like one of my bad homebrews. It took about 10 minutes to pour a pint glass, as all it would do was foam up. It did eventually go down, and leave some nice lacing down the glass. It is a very cloudy, oragngeish color. Aroma was a bit weak, with maybe a hint of citrus and some yeast. Some sour fruits to the taste, with a hint of bitterness. Not bad."
"A hearty thanks to my girlfriend for getting this for my birthday last week."
"The beer is copper-orange and clear with a medium head, not foamy, but bubbly. The smell is hoppy, floral and fruity. The taste had hops, but it was not overly strong. The thing I seemed to notice most was the sweetness of the brew - real fruity. Smooth finish and very drinkable. Would love to get my hands on some more of their brews. Also, really cool bottles and caps."
"The beer tastes slightly old, with the woody flavor lending some papery flavor. The carbonation is way too high for my tastes, although it simmers down as the beer sits a while. If the carbonation was smoothed down a little, and the woodiness wasn't so apparent, this would be a spectacular beer. As it is, it's a good, but not exceptional pale ale."
"Checked this one out at Redbones the other day...poured a slightly cloudy amber, didn't note any real head. I thought it had a slightly sugary aroma, and some mint family notes (don't ask which one, I couldn't tell)...Anyway, the main thing I noticed was a solid malt body, with a flowery hop finish. I found this beer a bit surprising, so double-checked with Sakaroo (in tha house) who assured me it was supposed to taste this way. I think I was looking for a slightly more bitter finish, but could not find it in this brew. Will want to try again. pat"
"Hazy peach/orange color. Big frothy off-white. Fruit aromas immediately greet the nose, pineapple, pear, orange, tame citrus hop. A thin layer of foam sticks to the lip as the first sip is taken. The flavor incorporates the above mentioned aromas, along with a well balanced grainy/worty malt that renders a smooth as silk mouthfeel. The hops are prominent but not overwhelming. The balance may be near perfect with this brew. The aroma and flavor hops are right on the money. Well calculated bitterness is countered by a semi-sweet grain middle, then a fruity citrus hop finish. Satisfying and drinkable. Had the pleasure of enjoying on tap at Anam Cara - 25 Sep, 03. I also saw this at Downtown Liquors  Davis Square for $10.95 for a four pack. Are you effin kidding me? Aside from being overpriced in the bottle, Whales Tale Pale is a fine brew."
" Thanks a million VENOM for this wonderful brew!"
"F"
"If you go to Nantucket, it's here, it's there, it's everywhere. Pours a light orange, slight head. The taste is slightly pale, nothing biting here. The hops are there but, nothing overwhelming. Just a slightly above average beer, good for a long ferry ride."
"Nice presentationGewurztraminer style, brown 750 Ml, cap-finished bottle with a sophisticated looking brown label, matching the style of the other Cisco labels. No dating system was evident. This sure is a pricey offering though, at almost $7 for a 750 of pale ale The beer pours a slightly hazed, orangey-amber with a massive, bottle-conditioned head of soapy-looking beach foam, which had an interesting tendency to collapse like a soufflé. I had a hard time coaxing much of an aroma out of this onethere were some hops, but mostly I smelled yeast. The flavor started the same way-yeasty, with some hops underneath. Talk about clean: the intensely-prickly carbonation washed away any flavor before it had a chance to take root in my mouth. A more vigorous top-up pour released an even larger head, but also allowed some of the subtle, pale maltiness to come through. The bottle claims this to be an IPA style, though the web page makes a seemingly contradictory claim of an English style beer. Id put my money on the latter, as I certainly dont taste any American hops. The web page goes on to mention a kiss of Kent Goldings, which seem to be evident in their tart earthiness, though not abundant. Style buffs may call this an English IPA. Personally, I wish it had more hops and/or more malt character. Sub 1.070 OG beers can be wonderful to drink, but it helps if theres something interesting going oninteresting, estery yeast strain, aromatic malts, bold hop expression, Maris Otter sweetnessjust give me something This beers biggest attraction was its simplicity, its cleanliness and its spritzy yeastiness. Its possible that this is an old bottle, but it tasted fresh enough. Boring overall"
"A New England rare treat, find it if you can. Apparently the results vary, but I've never had a problem."
"Drinkability: Average... This could be a enjoyable brew if they tweaked the recipe and/or brewing process to get the flavor balance right, and lowered the carbonation to an acceptable level. For an IPA, the hops were practically nonexistent. A decent beer, but with considerable flaws..."
"Large bubbly head that goes quick. Cloudy amber color - traces of yeast - and faint nose of malt and hops. For a pale it isn't loaded with hops like most are. Starts with a malt/hop mix and finishes with a mild hoppy flavor, it is better after warming some. Look for a black bottle."
"Thanks to Loren (VENOM) for sending this to me. I made this my #200 because I knew that any beer that he sent me would never disappoint and would be worthy of a century mark or 2."
"On the last sip, one begins to wonder where it all went wrong. This ale seems to have some real substance but it just never comes together harmoniously. I'm certainly hoping that the carbonation issue with my sample was simply a fluke but its worth reviewing for just that reason--to help keep BAs informed."
"Note: I have had repeated problems with the carbonation and the size of the head on this beer (multiple samples, different purchases over a period of three months). Even with a very delicate pour, the head is out of control (i.e., well over three inches), and this makes it difficult for me to judge the beer's appearance (distorted), mouthfeel (way too fizzy) and drinkability (annoying). I plan on returning to this one in a few months with the hope that these problems will be corrected, so that I can adjust my review accordingly."
"1/24/03 Currently drinking the 750mL version. Noticeably more carbonation, with a denser creamier head that works very well in smoothing out the beer. Also a more prominent yeast flavor, dare I say overabundant, which I have noticed in other Cisco beers. While this is still very good, I have to recommend the smaller bottle which will seem perverse to many seasoned beer drinkers. However, the smaller bottle has a truer pale ale flavor, with less yeast, sweeter malts and more prominent hops. It is also more bang for your buck: my 4pack of 12-ozers was 9.99, while I believe the 750 is typically 6.99 (although it some places it may be cheaper)."
"On the pour dreary deep amber to burnished copper color with a portly head and the texture frothy, color a light tan with oodles of fine lace to coat the glass. A light scent of the hop flower, which blends well with the orange like sweetness and the underlying malt, caps this fine nose. Malt and somewhat sweet beginning, the top middle of the road in feel the finish gratifying in its hops spiciness, the carbonation agreeable with the aftertaste dry and lingering. A very drinkable and quite refreshing beer, which once again I wish, were more readily available here in the destitute West."
"This brewery's beers all seem to be a half step off style - which, as someone who never colored inside the lines, I appreciate."
"Deep golden with an orange hue; minimal white head with little retention (the bartender at Redbones tonight was not concerned with pouring beers with any head whatsoever). Nose is mostly floral/citric hops.  Taste is primarily hoppy with a citric bite; a toasted malt flavor becomes apparent as the beer warms. This is a brew I'd return to with no hesitation."
"Pours a nice cloudy peach color with a huge frothy white head that dissipates rather slowly and leaves a monster lace all the way down the glass.  The aroma is of subtle, earthy hops with a bit of fruitenes thrown in and some light biscuity malt.  The flavor starts off with some mild biscuity maltiness before going to a great light fruity flavor that is accompanied by just enough hop bitterness for the rest of the brew.  This is one seriously carbonated brew, as all of Cisco's beers seem to be be, but it remains creamy and crisp and exceedingly drinkable.  I need to try some Cisco brews on draught and that is all their is to it."
"I'd definitely have this again on-tap, and in fact prefer it over the bottle."
"Cisco lists this one as an IPA, but its bitterness is closer to an American pale.  The brew is unfiltered which is fine from the tap, but creates way too much carbonation from the bottle. Whale's Tale has a distinct earthy/grassy character which definitely is a plus.  This is a unique beer in its style and worth a try."
