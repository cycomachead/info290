"Surprised that this was a disappointment.  Just a lousy finish."
""

""
"Very good English beer, shits great"
""
"Smell is just slight toffee. Very clean, mild malt profile that turns slightl fruity as the beer warms. Low carb is good for this beer"

"Aroma of caramel, floral, malts, faint honey & citrus. Taste sweet malt, caramel, biscuits, subtle spice, leather, & earthy."
""
"really not bad for beer on a plane. decent malt bill, very minimal hop presence. aroma of sweet adjuncts.  really enjoyable with my airline food"
"Good beer. Not great. Tasted good after a 10 km run."
"Enjoy"
"O) This doesn't try to do anything spectacular and that is its strength.  A fine malty brew that you can drink down without thinking too hard."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O – Great aroma, god flavor profile, but not the most satisfying drinker.  Again, I would love to have this on cask in the pub for the “real” experience."

"This expired a long time ago"

"This beer has an O.K. malty flavor and a hint that hops were involved in its making, but overall  seems just a small step up from a mass market US beer.  I made a few trips to the UK many years ago and had some great local beers in and around London.  This is not those."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, London Pride is a solid pale ale, with lots of flavour, and was fairly easy to drink, a good session beer. Definitely worth a try and a good introduction to English, cough London, beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - well balanced and very drinkable this beer is again a fine example of the style and a good ambassador for the British style which tends to be more rounded and balanced than the new wave of hop forward beers. (Not that I'm claiming one is better than the other just pointing out the difference in the regional styling)"
""
""
"I had a high expectation about this beer, at the start I found a bit of disappointment, as with this I realized that I am more into darker beers, but after a couple of drinks (and a little better temperature) I started to juge this as a more neutral point, and I really found it amazing, maybe not my favourite beer, but absolutely one of the best I've tasted so far, a smooth flavor not so bitter to be heavy, but bitter enough to taste marvelous."
""
"Magic! This beer is consistently satisfying - I grab a bottle or two every few months to remind myself of the standard for quality beer. Smooth, balanced, and everything an English Ale should be."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A very good English ale."
"Overall: a classic that never disappoints. I could drink this everyday if my budget allowed it."
"Very good beer."
""
""
""
"M: light and thin, and fairly well carbonated; the finish is fairly lively, considering."
""
""
""
"The Fuller's London Pride is a light orange-amber pale ale. It has a small but firm head and leaves a good lacing on the glass. The taste is a fruity,  citrus malt. Some bitter aftertaste but overall very smooth."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Close to Excellent!"

""
""
"Would have again; good beer to try, great inoffensive beer for people trying to get into better beer.   (4)"
""
""
""
"An enjoyable beer that I can easily toss back, yet still find some good flavor in."
""
"Pours a deep golden color. Very nice lacing, much more pronounced than the head. Aroma is of sweet malty and some bread. Tatse is sweet malts, balanced well with a touch of bitter hops. Might be a liitle too complex for me as a new rater to give a more detailed opinion. Overall, well balanced beer"

"O:  A good beer with some drawbacks.  Not as good as Fuller's ESB.  More malt would improve the beer substantially."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a flavorful, balanced and refreshing ale, with a pleasant taste."
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel: Medium light to medium in body. Medium high in carbonation. The carbonation is of note because it's helping to keep many of the hop flavors on my tongue for an extended period of time. It's really quite refreshing. The malts add a hint of coarseness at the back of my throat but they are working well within the beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Well, that was tasty.  You guys know the drill with Fuller's, but if a selection of British ales was put in front of me, the only hesitation I would have in going for London Pride first would be it's cousin ESB."

"Surprised by this one, really nice balance."
""
"A can doesn't do it justice; very creamy but lacks character. Glimpses of grainy bitterness and nuts."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Well balanced, but just a bit sweet. Probably not the freshest, but such is the case with imports that likely sit on the shelf for a while."
""
""
""
"O - A nicely malty ale that is better drunk at a bit above cellar temps.  Very well balanced.  A great ale for spring through summer.  The hoppiness of this ale can be enjoyed anytime."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Still, there is a reason this was once the exclusive beer for British Airways. Indeed, 'London Pride' is a name fully warranted for use by Fuller. This is a brewery that should rightfully derive satisfaction in its own achievements and whose beers are widely admired for the qualities they possess. And good as this is, I think they make even better."

"Pours an orangey amber in color with some off white head that faded quickly into a medium collar and some thin wisps. Fair legs and lacing. Aroma is toasty and bready with some faint earthy hops. Taste is light caramel, some earthy and floral hops and a bit bready as well. Appreciable hop bitterness. Light-medium body and medium-low carbonation."

"Overall: I enjoyed this for it's balance and earthiness."

"Pours a pretty medium copper-amber in color with a very thin off-white head. Some very light lacing is seen but not much at all. The aroma is of some biscuit, malts with a hint of caramel. The taste is not as sweet as the aroma suggests as it has a slight bitter aftertaste. The taste is of a lightly buttered biscuit with hints of caramel, honey and pine. Perfect carbonation. Overall, it was different and not a bad brew at all."

"Pours an oh-so-slightly clouded amber. It initially has a pretty creamy light tan head, minor retention but some very nice lacing sticky lacing. The aroma is malty and rich, with notes of fruit and burnt sugar. The taste is superb, with incredible malt depth for the light ABV. The bottle version doesn't do the UK cask version justice, but it is still delicious. It has a nice weight to it, not too heavy but not thin or watery, either. In total, an excellent pint of ale."

"O - this is a great beer for the style,  not my favorite but still decent"
""
""
""
""
""
"I cut my teeth on this beer in my early days of exploring the world of beer back in the 1980's. Despite the fact that I was drinking it 9 months after its expiration date it held up beautifully and reminds me of how I always remembered it to be."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is one of my favorite brews. Overall it balances nicely. This beer will appeal to English IPA and brown ale lovers as it has some components of both but balances well enough to pick out these differences. As a fan of English ales, I'd give this one a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pale golden orange colour, 1.5 fingers of off white head, some lace here too. Smell is of toasty malts and fruity hops, light lemony citrus, buttery bread, moderate hop, some floral notes as well. Taste is malty up front, buttery toasted malts, fruity hop, mild bitterness, orange and lemony aftertaste as well. Lightly carbonated, smooth medium body, soft creamy feel. A solid pale ale, flavourful, and fairly easy drinking, could drink this in large quantity over the span of a warm afternoon."
""
""
"Overall: Solid, smell is fun, taste a bit less, but a solid beer worth to have in your basement for random nonbeer-drinking friends."

"O- An amazing representation of an English bitter. Clean and refreshing. i do prefer Fuller's ESB to this one though."
""
""
""

"O- Decent. Light, drinkable, like any solid English pub beer. Nothing spectacular in my mind, though."

"330 ml bottle into pint glass, best before 12/22/2013. Moderate gusher upon opening. Pours slightly cloudy deep golden amber color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of caramel, toffee, pear, apple, grape, biscuit, toast, floral, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with very well balanced malt, hop, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, toffee, toast, pear, apple, grape, biscuit, floral, grass, herbal, light pine, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, pear, apple, grape, biscuit, toast, floral, grass, herbal, light pine, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a god bit. Very well balanced and moderately robust malt, yeast, and hop flavors; with a moderately crisp malt/hop balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied; with a lightly creamy, smooth, and moderately crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish as expected of 4.7%. Overall this is a damn nice English pale ale! All around good balance and robustness of flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"Mild dry and bitter aftertaste. Solid good bitter and sweet beer, it proves you can be big and still produce a decent quality product."
""
""
"O - decent but not memorable"
""
""
"Overall: A fine example of its type, London Pride is a long time favourite of mine. I like it from the tap (cask), from the can, and from the bottle, and it's a beer that doesn't seem to suffer much from any of these storage methods. This one really is what it says on the tin: rich, malty & satisfying."
""
""
""
"Had on tap at an alehouse in Calgary (1600 in the south). Arrived in a signature London Pride pint glass (always a nice touch), a nice honey golden to orange amber color with around three fingers of white head. Aroma a classic British ale waft of pale malts, woody earthy hops, and a touch of fresh orange and coriander spice (the latter a bit unusual in a British pale, but I swear that's what I smell here. Must be the integration of citrus and peppery esters). Body is classic for the style, on the thin side but not watery. Palate is a subtle but rich complexity of soft bready malts, savory spice, floral citrus that mirrors the orange and lemon aroma, medicinal herb notes, maybe a little diacetyl butter, and a clean ultra-smooth bitter finish. Even the non-beer geek I was with was amazed by the smoothness. Overall effect is malty and bright vibrant citrus notes rather than super-sweet, but make no mistake, I am not talking citrus as in pungent West Coast hops. This is earthy, woody, fruity (from ale yeast), but smooth and bitter, with only a touch of caramel. A sublime integration of classic English flavors that taste quite bright and fresh on tap and with an aggressive yet English hopping regime that leads the way but does not overpower the malts. Rivals Samuel Smith Old Brewery but tastes a bit less rustic and ""dark", more bright and fruity. Incidentally, many sources say this is a bitter rather than a pale ale. I think the cleaner malt taste and hopping make it a pale ale, but a perfect example for the old debate around whether these are even different styles."
"The British should stick to fish and chips, and leave the brewing for us North Americans!"
""
""
""
"O: A very fine English Pale Ale, and one that could most certainly be the benchmark for the style. Extremely easy to drink with a coy complexity. Definitely worth trying if you're into English ales"
"Overall - Quite a bit of flavor in this beer, however for whatever reason just didn't enjoy it as much as I would have hoped. To me it was a bit too lemony and too bitter (at least for what my expectations were) and that's why the review is as sparkling. However, anyone with an interest in beer should definitely try it especially those loving English Ale styles."
""
""
""
"Well rounded, malty and bitter without being overdone. Bursting with flavour - particularly for a 4.7%. Full taste whilst sessionable - hard to beat. The live cask ale draught is a 4.1% and even better, but bottle conditioned is a close second. Both are made at the Griffin Brewery in Chiswick (West London) where the brewery and company have a long, proud history."
""
""
""
"Great, rich malt character, and the hops balance nicely, but don't overwhelm. The diacetyl complements the malt backbone well. The fruit character was stronger than I recall."
"O-easy drinking straight forward brew. Great session beer"
""
"O - Very decent English bitter overall. It's tasty, well balanced, and bitterness is assertive without dominating."
""
""
""
"Even though I only bought one bottle of this, I could have downed a few in a sitting. This had ""session"" written all over it (not literally) and thankfully, all of the ingredients were British. I say that because it's hard for me to picture something not along the lines of Boddington's or Bass but had a nice niche all of it's own. While not like their American counterparts, this fell into a style that I could easily enjoy and even love. Beers like this are a classic for reason - no one would ever want to see this change. A must-try for anyone looking to find a new session Ale that feels like an old friend."

"Pale Ales are not my thing, but, overall, this beer is not too off-putting to me."
""
""
"Overall this beer is spot on its style with a satisfying combination of hops malt and flavor robustness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o: A fine English ale."
""
""
"Pours with a short-lived white head over golden liquid with just a hint of redness in it. Nose is weakly malty, very clean though. Taste is somewhat on the light side, a lightly malty start with a slight but pleasant hoppiness. All in all it adds up to a very easy to drink English pale ale."
""
""
"At under 5%, this is a really one of the best session ales I’ve had. It surely would pair well with many heavy meals as well as chicken. Pleasantly surprised and impressed."

"Overall: Do not drink this cold. It needs some air and warmth to do its thing. It's an English ale, so no real surprise, right? I really expected a little more malt, but for what it is, it's a tasty session beer that appeals to a wide audience. Me likes."

"Overall, the colour is downright beautiful for a beer, and it feels pleasant in my mouth. The smell is a little off, but the taste somewhat redeems that. Regardless, I cant justify a repeat purchase of this."
""
""
"Pours with 1/4 inch head that disappeared within 10 minutes. Has a good amber color. Aroma is hoppy but not over powering. Very smooth without a tasting weak, well balanced."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great flavor and aroma in a small package (in terms of ABV). London Pride remains the best sub-5% beer I've had to date."
""
""
"O: Equivalent to the comfort food of beer. Fairly simple and not complex but still a well done beer with good balance and a nice flavor. I really liked this beer and it appear to be a bottled emulation of traditional cask ales. Pub quality in a bottle"
""

""
""
""

"Drinking this fresh is a pleasure. I will stand by London Pride. Great stuff."

"Poured from a can into a British Airways plastic cup on a flight from Heathrow. Not the most ideal of drinking situations, but still classically delicious and refreshing. Balanced malty goodness with a touch of pear fruitiness. Light in body but packs considerable flavor. Easygoing and sessionable. The best I could ask for in a cramped cabin 40,000 feet above sea level."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Fuller's London Pride has become our favorite. Every day beer. The balance of malt and hops is masterful. It pours a rich amber color with a big white head to head stays for most of the session. The aroma has a mild Bready quality. The taste has a nice clarity to it that ends up with the full malty mouth feel."
""
""
""
"It's so nice that such a fantastic beer is so easily accessible. I haven't tried it on tap yet, but we do have a bar here in Hong Kong that serves it draught, and I intend to go there this week, and then regularly. Meanwhile, it's about half again as expensive as Boddingtons, but oh, so much better."

"Fullers London Pride is the classic English Pale Ale that is easy drinking, refreshing, and well balanced."

""
""
"O: strangely, this beer seems to taste better when I use it as a backup beer; i.e., when I start a session off with this one, I don't like it as much as when I drink it second or third after a different beer. the overall presentation lacks compared to Samuel Smith's Old Brewery Pale Ale, but the taste holds up just fine. if you're looking for an English pale ale, you could do much worse."
""
""
"Bready caramel/molasses? Semi-sweet, assertive but moderate bitterness . Medium bodied nice mouth feel/ Light aroma and easy drinking. Recommended for those who want a robust ale with moderate bitterness and a light hop flavor. Re-reviewing this one almost two years later with an evolved pallet. It is somewhat disappointing now. All in all it is still a great beer but I question if  it's worth the price I pay for it here in the US."
""
""
"O: Not a benchmark beer, just a bog-standard (and therefore a quality) English ale."
""
""
"4.25/5"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I though there were a lot of similarities between London Pride and Samuel Adams Boston Lager, which means I really enjoy this beer. The beer poured a very nice amber with white head that laced. The smell was primarily buttering hops. The taste was a well balanced beer between the hops and malt. There was a subtle sweetness that worked well with the bitter hops. The mouthfeel was a decent light to medium bodied ale with decent carbonation. Overall it was a good session ale."
"Overall - This is a great, sessionable English PA. Doesn't overpower with flavor, instead relying on great balance and solid drinkable quality. It's nothing that's gonna blow your mind, but if you wanna kick back and have a few brewskies during the game, you could do a hell of a lot worse."
""
""
""
"O- A very nice beer. One that you can easily drink without thinking too much, but that will still provide you depth and flavour. Perfectly balanced, found no issues"
"By no means the best best bitter out there, even among the paltry imported bottle offerings on the shelves in California...but a well crafted historical ale worth a try (though given the price, maybe not worth re-visiting often)."
""
""
""
"Price Point - $1.67/11.2 oz single bottle"
"I first had pride when I was stationed in London from 2002 to 2005. My favorite is to get on tap at the brewery but a bottle every now and then is refreshing. Pours a golden color with a white frothy big head. You can really smells the English malts and hops. Taste is a strong apple cider-like sweetness in the mouth. Aftertaste has the the right amount of hops. Carbonation is soft. This is one great ale!"
"I generally find this style a bit dull, so I'm probably unconsciously prejudiced against this. Nonetheless, I'd definitely rate it higher than the currently highest-rated English Pale Ale, 'Landlord', which I found to have an off-putting sweaty taste. This a very well-balanced brew and would probably be the perfect match for a pub lunch."
""
""
""
""
"O: clean smooth and refreshing"
""
""
""
""
"O- Not a bad beer. Although I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a Pale Ale, I probably won't be picking up this one anything soon."
""
"Overall: a good strong flavors beer but with a light body."
""
"Overall I can't believe this is the first time I am reviewing this beer but just like the Porter and the ESB, I have zero to complain about. The flavors are not mind-blowing but just super solid and extremely enjoyable and drinkable for the ABV/style. Not many American brewers can make a beer this tasty and sessionable."
""
""
""
""
"O - classic English Ale taste"
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""

""
""
""
""
"Pours a bright golden honey color with a white frothy head. Smells of English malts, cereal, apples and herbal hops. Taste is a strong cider-like sweetness up front with cereal grain character while in the mouth. Aftertaste is smooth, buttery with just the right amount of hops. Carbonation is soft. Nice balance, awesome complexity. This is one great ale!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"In any regard, when well kept and properly served, I place London Pride at the very top of my favourite beers, and a benchmark for all British pale ale. It is delicately balanced, and a fine session beer. Whith its bright copper color, smooth lacy head, moderate alchohol and pleasantly balanced finish, London Pride pairs excellently with prime rib, steaks and other hearty beef meals, as well as with fish&chips."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I don't know that I would characterize this ale as ""outstanding"" among well-crafted English Ales; I've had some that are just as delicious. Similarly, I don't know enough about the brewing process to judge whether or not the beer is ""premium."" Still, I can say with confidence that there is plenty to take ""pride"" in here. Fuller's produces better beers, but London Pride is a delicious English Ale that I'll definitely drink again."
""
""
""
"O: tasty, easy drinking, session beer, with enough complexity to hold a beer geek's interest."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This will be in my regular line up, especially at $3.50 a bottle. I believe this would also be a great beer to people new to the craft world. A great example of how beer should be."

"Overall, I was slightly disappointed with this beer. I expected a fuller more complex flavor and a slightly better mouthfeel. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I expected this to blow Bass Pale Ale away. While it is better than Bass, it just didn't seem to be worth paying that much extra to drink. At just over $13 including tax for a sixer I expected more. I doubt I will purchase this ever again in bottle form, but would like to try it on tap. All of that being said it is a good beer, just not as good as my high expectations had hoped it would be."
"The milky notes were very off putting. The base beer is all caramel and very one-dimensional. This is rather disappointing, but it is low-abv and very sessionable. I won't be buying this again, though."
"i did purchase this sixer specifically for the purpose of chasing the bourbon (it was a toss up between this and the guinness black lager- both very light abv) and i feel it accents the bourbon nicely. as a stand-alone brew, it stands by itself and on its own merit. a great tasting brew, although very light; but very nicely balanced and has definite purpose in life. cheers!"

"Overall/Comments: One of the best ales that I've had. So very well balanced in flavor/aroma/mouthfeel. An exceptional brew. Classified as an English Pale Ale at 4.7% ABV."
"Served on Tap today at the British Beer Company. Comes to the table a deep golden color with a thinnish off white head that slowly dissipates. Smells of rich sugary maltiness, lots of dark sugars and rich fruits with a hint of earthy and floral hops. The flavor is rich and malty but does have a bit of an earthy hop bite to it. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet slick mouthfeel. Nice beer, I've never had it before but it was on special so I gave it a shot. I probably wouldn't seek it out again as its really not my style, but there was certainly nothing wrong with it."

"O: I could easily see how you could spend a evening in a pub drinking this. It goes down very quickly, is thirst quenching and pleasant without requiring too much attention. A very sessionable beer that I would drink more often if it was half the price, but at this price point there a better beers out there form USA (think bell's 2 hearted ale)."
""
""

"O: A really enjoyable ale. Only thing missing is the mouthfeel. I wanted more robustness in that department."

"O: Overall I was very impressed with this beer, my first from Fuller's. An excellent ale with great balance and incredibly easy drinking."
""
""
"This is a really nice, easy drinking beer perfect for warm days when you still want some flavor but don't want something too heavy."
"O - A stellar example of an English Pale Ale, Fuller's London Pride blends maltiness with earthy hop tones and fruity yeast esters for a balanced and quite drinkable beer; an session beer I'd love to drink a few pints of in an English pub."

"Poured into a pint glass. Pours clear copper with a tall, off-white head. The head dissipates very slowly, leaving some lacing on the side of the glass. A few streaming bubbles can be seen rising from the bottom of the glass. The aroma is of sweet, bready malts and citrus from the hops. The taste follows the nose. The beer tastes bready with some mild background sweetness. The hops provide a nice citrus balance as well as faint back end bitterness. This beer also tastes clean. The body is light with some carbonation. The finish is smooth and slightly dry. The drinkability is very high. This is an excellent and very sessionable pale ale."

"Drinkable, but not terribly exciting. The malt is OK, but more aromatic hops would be nice. The diacetyl is also a minor flaw. It's unusually dark and a tad strong for a pale ale; I'd class this as more of a bitter. At any rate, not one of Fullers best brews despite it's ubiquity. I'd recommend trying the cask version."

"O: An Extremely well balanced beer, extremely drinkable! A nice every occasion beer! Nice session beer as well!"

"The verdict: This is a brilliant ale. I've only really tried the more 'mainstream' English ales on the market, and but this is certainly the best of the bunch. I could enjoy this in my Duvel tulip at room temperature as much as I did chilled in my pint glass. Sip or quaff, you'll probably thoroughly enjoy this beer. That being said, you'll probably want to use your pint glass for those nice deep gulps. Brilliant stuff."

"Clear gold with some orange hues. Thick white head with rocky retention and fairly dense lacing. Nose is bready, some pale English malt notes, orange and milder citrus. A fairly signature 'Fuller's' character, something smells a bit 'waxy' for lack of a more revealing descriptor. Taste has more breadiness, pale malts, that 'waxy' notes, more citrus - orange, grapefruit perhaps. Smooth and clean finish, lightly bitter. Quite an English offering, a decent pint."

"For me, this is my favorite for a great sandwich and compelling reading on evening best spent at home."
""
"I was expecting a better flavor to be honest. Its not bad for what it is though, and its certainly worth a try."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the forward maltiness, and just how refreshing the brew is. The flavoring is very “English”. The preparation of the grain bill and the vinegar quality gives this brew a characteristic mouth and feel. It certainly fits the style, but we wish that the hops were a bit more present and bold."
"Overall one of the best EPA's I'm just not that big a fan, however I would say Bass is better."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is one of the ""textbook"" examples by which English Pales like to measure themselves. The only thing really wrong with mine was a sub-excellent head, and I think that problem would most likely not exist at all in a tap version of the brew."
"Overall a good session beer though could do with being a bit weaker in terms of abv."

"O: Needs a bit more body, but it does have a pleasant finish and it is excellent with most beers. A very mild slightly fruity pleasing balanced beer."
""
""
"O: Really easy to drink, and I like how this showcases the malt. Light enough to drink a lot of, and good complexity/flavor to keep things interesting."
""
"Boo ya grandma!"
""
"o: While this beer is very drinkable and I enjoyed it overall. I enjoyed the fruity esters and thought it complemented the malt flavors very well. To fit into this style of beer better, it would need a good dose of bitterness. Ensure that your bittering hops are being boiled for a sufficient amount of time (i.e. 60 minutes) and that the alpha acids are on the higher range of the scale. Don't go too high as the malt flavors need to come thru too, but the bitterness does need to be increased. Also, perhaps laying off the caramel just a bit may help the beer shine in other flavor and aroma areas."

"Poured from a 330 ml bottle into a pint glass, best by 11 Jan 2012. This pours a nice amber color with a big bubbled very short lived head. The smells are of bready malts, a little caramel and maybe a hint of hops. The feel is medium to light. The taste is like it smells some nice bready malts, a little caramel / toffee and a little hop bite, far fewer hips than the American version."

"I love how complex this beer is. I really won't bother trying to put words to the flavors. The thing is I'm somewhat indifferent all and all on this one."
"Can from LCBO servec in McAuslan pint. 2-3 months old. Appearance: Long lasting one inch creamy off-white head with decent lacing. Beautiful copper pour with red shades. Aroma: Inviting cereal display, english hops and slightly roasted malts. I also get some nuts. Taste: Fresh cereal, citrusy hops and nutty malts blends nicely. Palate: Creamy and rich taste yet light bodied enough to session. Low carbonation. Overall: That went down quick. Very quaffable, awesome aroma. Could have had a little more flavor. I'm really getting into english ales, thanks to Albion."
"Very nice, round as the mouthful. Great nutty brown color. Smells full bodied and has a nice even taste - no overpowering aftertaste. Been drinking it for years and never disappoints. No ill effects when drunk from the bottle. Great with food - particularly fish."
"Poured from a bottle into a Leinenkugel's Red glass. The head vanished very quickly, leaving behind minor lacing. The mouthfeel is low carbonation and dry. The taste is floral and hoppy with malt taking a backseat. The ending is not very bitter but leaves behind a little hoppy bite. It is easy to drink and light in flavor and body. It is a beer that can be consumed in large amounts if desired because it just brings you back for another sip."
"Overall Drinkability - Tastes like no other pale ale I've had. Very mild. Enjoyable. Unchallenging. Almost boring. I'm going to have to try a fresh bottle to see if the aging made it better or worse."
"This is an excellent beer. There's enough going on for it to be interesting, but it's also highly drinkable. Well balanced. I'm impressed, even though this bottle is one month beyond the expiration date."
"O: A strange one. Not sure what to make of it."
"Mouthfeel is light and crisp. Slightly drying in the finish. Overall, London Pride might just be the archetypal English Pale Ale. Not the hoppiest, even by English standards but still a treat."
"O- A very solid English Pale Ale but quite different from the American styles."
"O: Not too complicated, but tasty and quite refreshing. The perfect pint for relaxing after work."
"Overall: Very enjoyable quaff. I like this on warm spring afternoons at my favorite bar, looking out the window at traffic."
"O - A typical English pale ale in that it is pleasantly appetising and very sessionable, yet somewhat subtle in terms of flavour."
"Served on tap at The Nook in Huntsville, AL. Poured a clear reddish amber color with a good half-inch head that stayed around for awhile and left some good lacing. As a Pale Ale, it had a slight hoppy flavor and smell but not as strong as an American Pale Ale. The mouthfeel presented a medium body with a hint of carbonation. Overall a very decent Pale Ale that was easy to drink."
"O- Like I said, this is a great example of an English Pale Ale. Really well balanced and solid. There is a sweet malt profile and a strong but not overpowering hop presence. Great ale."
"Pours a nice clear medium amber with a small off white head. Aroma of caramel malt, yeast, light hops and some grassy and fruity notes. Taste is sweet malt and yeast, with some light fruity notes and light hops. Palate is medium body with good carbonation. Finish is nice caramel malt, yeasty, with some light fruitiness ending has a nice hops bitterness for balance. Overall a good and nicely balanced easy drinking brew."
"D: This drinks nicely, but I've had better porters from local breweries. I'd have it again, if I couldn't find Port City Porter."
"Overall, this is a drinkable and balanced beer. Taste can be a little weak, but inoffensive with some decent features. Worth a try."
"Highly drinkable, nothing cloying, nothing heavy, yet everything the beer wants to convey detectable. A pleasant one to drink, at the pub or at home. Pints of these disappear quickly."
"Overall, this is a decent beer, but not as god as I remember."
"O: This one looked and smelled very nice. Though it had pretty good drinkability, I didn't like the flavor or mouthfeel as much as I did for the Samuel Smith's Pale Ale."
"O: Very tasty and drinkable, of the the best English beers I have had yet."
"D/O Highly drinkable (like the just rated ESB) and overall quite a nice surprise. 4.5"
" Pours a medium brown color w a one finger off white head. Minimal carbonation or lacing. Fairly clear to look at. Nose is great- toast, caramel, malt, dark fruit, maybe some chocolate? Very balanced and excellent example of the style. Taste is very similar to the nose, and is extremely tasty and balanced. Wow. GREAT for the style. Mouthfeel is medium w/ malt and caramel giving a great aftertaste. Overall, this is a great beer, and I'd buy this again."
"love fullers."
"Drinkability- I thought it was pretty good. It certainly went with the pub atmosphere."
"Overall: this is a good and well-crafted beer. Its only fault is that I am not, personally, a big fan of dry biscuity flavor. So, a good beer, if not precisely to my taste."
"O- Was impressed by this beer, definitely not one of my favorites, but I enjoyed it rather well"
"O: Very crisp summer beer. Something to buy in bulk and enjoy with friends. Not excellent, but it's adequate. Would keep in mind and possibly recommend if choices were very limited."
"Amber/copper in color, clean and sparkling. Strong whiskey and toffee aroma. Pours a large-bubbled off-white head which diminishes quickly leaving behind light lacing. Medium bodied with low-medium carbonation. The consistency is thin but almost buttery; the flavor coats the tongue and allows the aftertaste to sit back towards the taste buds. Taste is minerally, not terribly bitter and slightly warming. Balance is above average."
"RJT"
"O – Restrain and well balanced, it’s a nice session brew, but nothing really jumps out at you as particularly noteworthy either."
"Changes slightly when drunk a little warmer much more flavour around 50."
"Personally, this reminded me of old red vermouth... in beer form. I had a hard time drinking it and when I pawned it off on my friends, they didn't like it either!! Maybe just not my style, I suppose. Other than the odd taste I experienced, it looked and stood like a decent beer should."
"Pours a clear honey orange with a 1/2 inch off-white head that fades to a thin cap. Random drips and sheets of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, honey, and some light citrus fruit aromas. Taste is of malt, honey, and citrus zest/sweet citrus fruit. There is also a light grape flavor with this one as well. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good English pale ale from Fuller's. I am glad I decided to pick one of these up. I would definitely get this one again."
"This beer has a nice feel when drinking it, a very welcome beer. Has a nice caramel that doesn't come off to strong or overbearing, I do believe I could drink a bunch of these."
"a beautiful transparent amber body with a snow white top about a finger thick that sticks and laces well. smell is sweet malts caramel toffee grain and dark fruit. taste is dark fruit sweet malts bread caramel and grain. some mild hop pull at the end. taste captures english pale ale perfectly. medium bodied with low carbonation. overall this is one excellent brew from a quality brewer."
"London Pride pours a clear orange to amber, depending on how well lit the beer is. The white foam that serves as a crown tops out at one finger at the most, leaving a little bit of lacing and showing a touch of head retention. The nose is surprisingly malt forward. It predominantly displays a nutty sweetness, though there's a touch of herbal European hops present as well. The malty aspects of the beer open up a little bit more on my palate. Toasted nuts, caramel, and a little bit of diacetyl show themselves, followed by a mineral laced bitterness. That same mild herb hoppy note from the aroma closes out each sip. The mouthfeel comes across as a bit slick overall. The body is mid to light, which is a boon to drinkability, but the carbonation isn't quite enough to cut through that. I enjoyed my bottle of London Pride, but I'm a bit surprised at how much the malty vs hoppy flavors are what I enjoyed about this pale ale."
"Final Grade: 4.18, an A-."
"Overall: Nice brew, smooth and easy to drink."
"Another solid Fuller's brew, they seem to get it right from what I have noticed. Freshness date was April 2012 so that may be key here."
"D - A very solid, very respectable English Pale Ale... Quite sessionable at at 4.7% ABV... Could drink a couple of these in a sitting..."
"One of the best English pale ales. Highly recommended."
"Perfect: I could drink it all night."
"Picked this up at the biggest beer store in the UK, Beers of Europe Ltd. Beautiful clear copper pour with fluffy two finger head with great retention and lacing. Toffee and caramel malt dominates the nose with a subdued, but appealing floral, perfumy hop aroma. The taste is much the same with plenty of toasty caramel malt with hints of biscuit, tea, vanilla, toffee, brown sugar and just a touch of metal. Great balance with just enough of a tangy, bitter hop bite on the finish to perfectly complement the sweet malt. The drinkability of this beer is off the charts! This is the definition of the perfect session beer. Plenty of character, with a low ABV and smooth as silk mouthfeel. Definitely one of my favorite beers in the world, from one of my favorite breweries!"
"Such a great beer! I come back to this one several times a year."
"Smells fresh and inviting, honey, floral notes, newly cut hay. Lots of flavor and oomph packed into a managable ABV package. Crisp and toasty at times, bready and buttery at others. Earthy bitterness with a hint of funk lying underneath. Perhaps a touch of citrus in the finish. Just enough carbonation to push it to medium bodied. Easy recommendation here. Very nice beer."
"O: I should have had more than 2. A very pleasing offering. If you get the chance to have one in the environment for which it was intended you should not pass this one up."
"I could drink these all day in any weather. Refreshing enough for summer, and hearty enough for winter. This is an outstanding beer."
"O - A very well rounded beer with plenty on offer."
"Overall- Not the best, not the worst I’ve tasted by a long shot, this is a very smooth and easy drinking ale that you could easily sit down a session all night. The sweetness of it though might put some people off as the bread and caramel malt flavours really dominate this one from start to finish, although I must say the flavours are very well balanced. A very quality ale although I wouldn’t rate this one world class by any stretch of the imagination, more on the above average scale I would say, I would drink this one again though and Fuller’s seems to have very solid offerings, I actually really enjoyed their porter and ESB, this is just another win for them."
"O: nicely balanced, and easy to drink. To easy sometimes, a few hours out with the boys could easily finish 8 to 10 of these. Then your pissed as a fart, and sleeping on the couch."
"Cheers!"
"Overall, simple but tasty, and very sessionable. Would love to this from a cask sometime, this is nice every day drinking beer."
"Notes: The Archetype. Awesome. Hard to put into words. Perhaps my favorite beer."
"Always a nice beer. I had this one on-tap at the Brick Store Pub. Pours copper colored with a somewhat slight head. In the aroma, there are a nice balance of earthy hops and malt. The taste is a tad too bready and sweet for me to feel that this is world class, but it's pleasing enough. Smooth and bready in the mouth, this is probably better on a nice crisp fall day. I'm not sure I like this as much as I used to."
"Creamy and smooth with enough bitterness that it tingles the tongue, this is a great refreshing pale ale that I would definitely spring for again if I had another opportunity to grab a pint in London."
"Overall / Drinkability: Very drinkable beer. I could have easily had another 20oz by itself or with more food. An outstanding beer with food, but a very enjoyable beer on a very hot day. I will definitely have this again on tap - in a bottle it's good, but it is much better on tap. I wonder what it would be like in cask form?"
"D: A flavourful and sessionable English Pale Ale with a distinct biscuit character. Certainly worth a try, though I wouldn't say it's head-and-shoulders above other EPAs as its rating suggests."
"A friend gave me a bottle of Fuller's London Pride to try, and this was the evening. I have been on a IPA run lately, so this beer was a change of pace. Pours with a nice head that leaves a fine lacing. Nice aroma with a sweetness to it. The flavor is mellow sweet with good malty taste and a bit of bitter in the finish. Less carbonation as is common with an English brew makes it easy to drink. Overall the Fuller's London Pride is worth a try, but not Outstanding as the label advertizes."
"There's bitterness is towards the end, but it does not stay on the palate. Finish is fairly clean. Overall, I liked it. Especially good for a 4.7% ABV beer."
"O - A tasty ale, but nothing out-of-this-world. Worth taking for a test drive, but I prefer some of their other offerings over this particular one."
"Oh yeah, this is English pale ale 'cause they don't make 'em taste like this on our side of the pond. We tend to like our pale ales either grainy or hoppy. This one possesses a nice sweet malty flavor nicely balanced with some mild grainy tones and some faint hoppy bitterness. There's some definite graininess here, but it's so nicely balanced that it adds to the character of the beer instead of making it seem blah. The more I drink, the more it seems to have a nice woody flavor to it. I could drink this beer all evening long and not get tired of it. Moreover, since the alcohol content is so moderate, I probably wouldn't regret it either."
"That's more like it. All the classic English bitter flavors in the right place. The definition of balance. Hops were probably dead in the airport pint. I am surprised by the strength of some of the metallic and leafy notes. But much closer to classic."
"A very nice easy drinking session beer."
"D - I have always liked this ale, had it a number of times at a colleague's parent's pub in London, they were about 2 miles from the brewery and the beer was always very fresh. A great session beer."
"O: While it may not be super exciting, it is a good beer and rather easy to drink."
"While I would tire of this style rather quickly and would not want another pint of this, I find this one to be supierior than many others in the same vain."
"O: Superb pale ale. Fine example of an Old English Pale Ale."
"I believe Fuller's classifies London Bride as a premium bitter, and it is definitely an excellent example of the style. Incredible malt profile, low carbonation, and extremely smooth. This is a seriously drinkable beer."
"Note: Reviewing a fresh bottle, I've noted this beer really loses it's luster once the best by date has passed."
"Overall: Super solid and quite the poundable beer, it leaves you wanting more."
"Pours an apricot gold. Head soon rings up, yet washes the glass a bit. smell has a decidedly earthy aroma, from all angles. Also, some apple. Taste has some nicely placed English hops, and a backing of oh-so-mellow, toasty malts. Sweet finish. Feel is *smooth* to say the least. An excellent drinker."
"Overall, I don't have much experience with premium bitters and I generally like the more bold flavors of ESBs, but this is a solid very drinkable session beer."
"This is a pleasant, sessionable, drinkable pale ale. It's not a wow beer by any means, but there isn't anything I would change."
"Overall: I don't think this beer is as interesting as the other options that Fuller's produces. I'll go for the ESB next time."
"This beer wasn't too bad. With a name like London Pride I thought it'd be a heck of a lot better though. This beer is a nice copper color with a pretty nice head on it at first. The head goes away pretty fast. The smell of this beer is of malts and just a bit of hops blended in there a little. The beer also had a pretty smooth flavor to it, The flavors are mostly malts and grains, just a bit of bitterness in the end from the hops. This beer isn't bad I just prefer others over this one."
"The Crack of this little 11.2 oz (330 ml) CAN went off without a hitch and the Glug produced just better than a finger's worth of thick, dense off-white head with great retention. Color was a deep orangish-amber with NE-quality clarity. BUPGOO! Nose had the upfront biscuity maltiness that I have come to recognize and enjoy, underlain by some earthy hop bitterness. Mouthfeel was medium with a very pleasant interplay between the bready malt and the earthy hops on the tongue. Finish was semi-dry, very pleasant and certainly worth both seeking out and placing in the cooler for an outing."
"Overall this is a great example of the style and definitely the go to beer to get your feet wet with the English Pale Ale style. I've been meaning to review this beer for a while, and I'm happy to see it scoring so well."
"overall this would probably be one of the standards of a true english pale ale"
"Reminds me of some of my favorite days patronizing Oxford's best pubs. Drier and crisp from the bottle. More robust and maltier from the cask. Lovely either way."
"Many thanks to resi for sending me this beer. Poured from a 11.2 oz. can. Has a caramel color with a 1 inch head. Considerable lacing involved. Smell is of malts, bready, some sweetness. Taste is good, malts, bready, a touch of hops and just a tad bit of sweetness. Feels full bodied in the mouth and is very smooth and drinkable. Overall a very good beer."
"The feel is good. Low carbonation, light body. I do feel like the carbonation could be a bit more but this isn't bad. Overall, a nice offering. Glad to have tried it."
"O- This is true Ale at its finest, you really need to try this on cask to appreciate its nuances."
"A very, very drinkable beer. It goes well with all kinds of food and is smooth enough to drink all evening."
"Pours a murky organism brown. Lots of smooth creamy head that hangs around forever. Smells nice and lightly hoppy. A bit of w buttery smell but not bad. Smells mildly malty as well. Nice creamy tongue feel. A hint of maltiness and a bit of hops. There is a nice warm butteriness that underlies the whole thing. Great mouthfeel and very drinkable"
"Nice moderate carbonation but the body seems a bit watery."
"d- okay, i'm not the biggest fan of english style ales, but this is drinkable. i'd drink it again if offered but wouldn't seek out."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, esp. considering I'm not really used to the style."
"Looks outstanding. Great amber to cherry hue with a thick finger head. Smells of fruit and malt. The ginger and cherry really come though. Roasted malts combine perfectly with the slight bitterness of the hops. Sweet and a bit dry. Slick to creamy mouthful that finishes slightly dry. Outstanding brew to session with."
"D- Good basic ale, but I found it a bit one dimensional."
"Drinkability -- I had high hopes for London's Pride and I was not disappointed. Great malting, great feel, it's quenching but still nuanced and contemplative. Really good stuff. Hopefully I'll find this on cask someday."
"Pours a fluffy egg shell colored two fingers worth of creamy head. This dissipates to a nice cap. Clear amber color. Smells of some earthy hops, bready malts, typical english yeast, some carmel, maybe banana. Tastes carmel, earthy, woody, minerals, touch of english hops. Medium/thin body, neutral feel on the tongue in some way. Light carbonation. I could have a few of these in a sitting quite easily but the overall I need a bit more flavor. Not a bad beer, it fits the style. A bit pricey at $2.99 a single."
"D: Very high. Low ABV...low carbonation...pleasing taste...all make this an easy drinker."
"D - very easy-drinking, very tasty, excellent example of English Pale Ale -- makes me wish I knew better when I lived there"
"Drinkable. light bodied and almost tart."
"Pours a three finger cream head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Crystal clear amber color. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Nose is light malt and grassy hops, flavor is same with light malt, light caramel, hints of hops. Clean finish. $3.99 for a 500ml bottle from Market Basket Concord, NH."
"HV"
"Poured into a pint glass. Has a best before date proudly stamped on the back. Pours a light golden color with a one finger head, average lacing. Lots of sweet malt in the aroma, with some caramel also, and a bit of hop bitterness in the nose as well. Mostly caramel malt in the tase, with a bit of bitterness. Mouthfeel is a bit thin but well carbonated, and drinkability is great, mellow taste and low abv definitely help."
"500 ml bottle, at Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. Served too cold. Brown / deep amber colour, decent head. Very moderate aroma, some malts and caramel, hints of old furniture. Malty flavour with tolerable hops, not sweet. Drinkable, but the cask conditioned version (from a WELL KEPT cask!) is definitely better than this!"
"D: The beer is very easy to drink and quite tasty as well. It's a perfect example of a session ale."
"D: Easy drinking, just a little too sweet for my preference."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, the beer has a crystal clear amber coloring, with a short stack of thick, beige foam that quickly disperses into an uneven film of bubbles. The beer has a roasty/toasty malt nose. Flavors are malt heavy, with hints of toffee and caramel, but balanced by a very slight bitterness that I get only on the sides of my tongue. I get a little taste of candy/taffy every once in a while, also. The bitterness steps up in the finish and aftertaste, which makes it easy to take another sweet sip to follow-up. The beer is crisp, light, and smooth in mouth, and the finish is subtle, but hangs out long enough to remind you that the beer is hopped a bit. Very tasty beverage, and my first from Fuller's, so I am looking forward to trying some of their other offerings."
"If ever there was ever a beer built for a hand pull, it's this one. Inoffensive, approachable, well balanced, and quaffable as heck here on cask, I could have easily put down pint after pint of this with our lunch. Good stuff!"
"D: Goes down very easy, but I prefer the hop flavor and punch of APA better. This is a great drinkin' beer though, and one I can't believe I waited this long to try. I'm sure this is heaven if drank from the source."
"Dark amber colour with frothy, off-white head. Malty, fruity nose with orange peel, apricots and a clean but fairly boring malt profile. Malty, fruity taste with notes of dried apricots, orange and a slightly earthy bitterness in the finish. Medium body. Well balanced and tasty but not really outstanding."
"Drinkability - a very mild beer, and hence very easy to drink"
"Pint, 4.1abv when from the cask. Dark brown colour, 1/4 finger head that doesn't stay long. Clear, Typical hoppy smell you get from an english bitter. First mouthfull had hints of smoke(never tasted before in pride) sour orange. Smooth. Very sessionable. This is an iconic beer"
"D: Pretty easy to drink, though I prefer this on cask."
"This is a great simple drinking beer I could pound these back and enjoy them all the time."
"Wow, for a beer that is considered to be the standard for epa's, this was underwhelming. It's reputation certaintly warrants another try and I will update rating if it improves."
"M & D - very drinkable. The hops in the English Pale Ales are an interesting contrast to American hops. They are different, and good; however, I like my American hops better - they are more flavorful. Decent beer overall."
"on the same shelf at the same price I'm going to buy their ESB over this but still worth a try"
"Final Thoughts: Probably the best offering I've had from Fuller's to date and light years better then that awful brandy flavoured vintage ale. This is a really good dinner ale and it could double as an all night drinker in a pinch."
"the bench mark for pale ales. just perfect flavor through out and a below 5% ABV."
"Clear, amber, head seems to fade down to a faint covering with little lacing. Fruity aroma, ripe apples and grapes, touch of yeast and a slight hint of alcohol, bit of sweetness. Taste consists of a light, fruity sweetness, a smooth and creamy mouthfeel, very refreshing and mildly carbonated with a nice medium body. Bit of floral hoppiness going on, nothing too much, nice and mild, with a very creamy finish. A great beer, nothing too complex, superb drinkability...sessionable for sure."
"Overall this is a fantastic little beer, very easy to drink, flavorful, complex and balanced."
"D-Went well with my bangers and mash, not in a hurry to have it again."
"Drinkability - an enjoyable beer, nothing out of this world. would have it again if the chance permitted."
"D--Not a very interesting beer. Good, but doesn't make you want to come back for more."
"Had this on-tap at a local English pub. A pleasant amber-brown body with a 1fingered head. The smell is quite pleasing as you can pick up a good amount of caramel-y malt balanced by a hoppy whiff. The taste is superb as there is a good dose of hops to provide a really nice counter-balance to the strong malt backbone. Definately beats Bass (althogh I do enjoy Bass quite a lot) and others. An excellent beer and one which is definately worth getting a pint of!"
"Conclusion: The beer is a wonderful example of this style. It is tasty and drinkable, and doesn't tear up the palate with aggressive hops or excessive alcohol. This beer is considerably better fresh, and from the versions I have tried, the canned version was the tastiest. Also, I much prefer this mixed with Guinness for a ""Black and Tan"" than Bass, as I think this beer if the obvious superior of the two."
"All in all, this is a classic of the style and for good reason. Delicious, and well rounded."
"Dangerously drinkable pale ale may be a bit tame by modern-day American standards but is a certified classic in style and balanced beauty for those who appreciate as much."
"D: Very flavorful beer. Easy to drink and wish I had a few more of these."
"VERY NICE, WORTH TRYING!"
"A nice example of an English ale. I had this on cask once, and remember liking it more than out of a bottle. Still, a very good ale."
"Overall- A perfect beer!!!"
"D: Cannot get any easier to drink than this."
"All of the ingredients really came together and popped in an interesting way. A very flavorful brew."
"Drinkability - I think I must get past due brews. I have found that to be a problem at the store I frequent. This beer did not match any of the prior descriptions I have read. I finished the glass however. I would like to review this as a fresh brew. I know my nose and palate are not that far off."
"full review at www.abarwithnoname.wordpress.com"
"D. This is a very malt forward Pale Ale - much different than the American form of the style. I'll have to pick up some more of the style to see if this is characteristic (although coming from Fuller's, I assume it is)."
"Overall, this is a fairly good English Pale Ale. Reminds me of having pints in the UK a few years back. Enough flavor to keep it interesting, smooth enough to keep you drinking."
"A gentle pour resulted in one finger of head that had good retention before settling to a thin cap. Moderate amount of spotty lacing is left on the glass. Dark amber in color with plenty of tiny carbonation bubbles. Surprised by the amount of caramel malt in the aroma. Hard to pick out the herbal, grassy hops but they are there. Plenty of hops in the flavor. Tea and herbal type qualities. Nicely balances the sweet caramel malt. Slightly minerally finish. Bitterness is moderate. Light body and abundantly carbonated venturing into overcarbonated territory. No reason to enjoy just one with the low ABV and the palate friendly hops."
"Bottle. Pours amber with a short lived, white head and lively carbonation. Aroma of piney hops, hay with some caramel malt in the background. Medium-full, tangy body. Good amount of earthy hops nicely balanced by caramel and ripe fruit on the palate. Long, dry, earthy finish. Great brew."
"This is a fantastic beer all around. Yeah, it doesn't knock your socks off, but that's not what this beer is meant to do. It's a well balanced clean english pub beer. It's one where you could sit back and drink all afternoon without knocking yourself out."
"Pours a moderate caramel color with a good white head and a pretty good amount of lacing. The nose brings a good dose of caramel along with some mild earthy, floral hops. The taste is mildly bitter with a focus more on the malt presence. Feel is pretty light with mild hops. Drinks pretty well and I can see why this has such a reputation."
"Glad I tried this. I would serve it to my coors & bud drinking friends to get them to explore and expand their palates. Good balance of malts, hops, carbonation, sweet notes, alcohol that they could handle."
"This is definitley one of the maltier Pales, not in any way shape or form a Bitter (just a warning to hopheads). Biscuit, sweet malts, and a dash of carmel dominate this brew. Very smooth, quite thick on the tongue with just enough bitterness in the background to keep this ale from being cloyingly sweet. The finish is dry. An outstanding session ale, and for Americans who enjoy English Ales a real treat"
"One of my top beers of all time and an excellent English Pale Ale."
"This is a solid, quaffable pale ale with low ABV and rich, complex flavor. It is worth seeking out, though I enjoyed the flavor more from the bottle."
"Drink well my friends"
"I did not think I would like this beer as much at home as when I first tasted it on tap in Newport, RI, but I did. One of my new favorites."
"Pours amber color, with foamy 2 finger head. Not much carbonation off the bottom of the glass. Aroma is of roasted notes, caramel, malts some hops. Definitely a bready note in the nose as well. Taste is smooth with caramel, bread and malt up front. Not much on the hops, but a little tingly on the tongue. Really clean finish with some roasted notes in the aftertaste. Really like the style of this brew and would recommend this as a session, or just a nice brew to chill out to."
"A decent English beer, nothing more."
"The cask version of this fresh from the brewery blows away this version but hell, this is still a special brew from one of my favourite English breweries. Spot on!"
"Very balanced beer easy to drink - I give the drinkabilty an A."
"A decent EPA. Good flavour and not over the top."
"The mouthfeel is a medium body and carbonation. Drinkability is good. Not bad, just nothing really special."
"I could drink this one all night. A perfect example of a nicely balanced English PA that is smooth and easy drinking but also flavourful."
"D- Little heavy for something to drink all day. But definitely something you can enjoy with dinner, than dessert, and maybe 1 or 2 after that."
"Very drinkable."
"D- Easy to down, and a considerably good beer. Like many of the Fuller offerings it is extremely drinkable, and can disappear before you know it."
"This one, like many, was somewhat dark in color, decent carbonation, good malty flavor but a little much (same with the aroma). Overall, not the most refreshing thing out there but I'm glad I tried."
"Drink - I can see how this might appeal to some. It's extremely easy drinking; but it's lacking too much flavour for me. The flavour that is there is good.. It's just that it's watered down. I wouldn't seek this beer out again."
"MF/D: intensely smooth for the amount of carbonation, an easily sessionable bitter brew."
"Classic beer and I am reminded that I should grab it more often when available via cask."
"Back to Fuller's this evening with the London Pride. Pour comes out a little flat, with very minimal lacing. Might be my glass is a little dirty. Smells similar to the ESB, with green apple in the background. Color is somewhat copper in appearance. Mouthfeel is light, bordering on watery, mouthfeel with very little in terms of carbonation. Taste is sweet and light. Really easy drinking. Honestly it's kind of a disappointment when comparing it to it's big brother in the ESB, but it's a decent beer in it's own right. Low ABV makes this the perfect session beer. I guess I'm used to the American Pale Ale style, I feel like this could benefit from more hops to help balance out the malt-heavy profile."
"good taste and good mouth feel make this a very enjoyable beer that is slightly above average"
"Pours a clear gold with a decent head that lasts about a minute but isn't worth applauding. Aromas are predominantly malty, with caramel and honey notes shouting the loudest but still failing to amount to something interesting. The taste, however, kicks things up a notch. The flavors are subtle yet well-balanced; there's nothing here to blow your hair back and yet it's one of the finest, sessionable, sipping ales around. Sweet malts are perfectly balanced by woody, slightly earthy hops in a medium-bodied, lowly carbonated blend that seems to take its flavoring as lightly as it takes its mouthfeel seriously. It's one of the most perfectly weighted ales I've ever had, which only adds to its sessionability. Bravo to this understatedly brilliant beer."
"One finger white head, slow dissipation, with significant lacing. Clear orangish amber body, no forced carbonation here. Malty goodness up front in the nose, with floral English hops for balance. Taste mirrors nose, with a significantly lingering bitter finish. Mouthfeel is medium full, not sticky, good effervescence, fairly dry finish. Good drinkability, one of the world's great session beers, IMHO."
"D- Packs a lot of flavor for such a low alcohol brew... this sessionable masterpiece will soon find it's way into my fridge for regular consumption!"
"Poured into my brand spankin new Oskar Blues Dale's Pale Ale shaker glass from a can. (On a side note, the Fuller's can looks awesome.) Gusher of a can, got about 4 fingers of creamy white head with decent retention. Nice light amber color. Amazing lacing last for the remainder of the beer. Smells like sweet English malt, caramel. Nice balance, low-medium carbonation. Lightly sweet, lightly bitter lingering finish. Tastes like you'd expect from the smell. Amazingly drinkable. Could probably go through a whole 6 pack. First time in a can. A classic for a reason."
"One of the EPA standards. Brilliant stuff - I almost always have at least one can of this in the fridge at any given moment. First rate."
"Drinkability: Strong example of an English Pale Ale. Maybe slightly too simple and carbonated, but a great, easy to drink example nonetheless."
"A rather good ale. On-tap at The Blackbird in Earl's Court."
"An exceptionally drinkable ale, one of my favourites."
"D - Highly drinkable. Could easily spend a night drinking pints of this."
"d - A very nice, easy to drink English pale ale. Would have again."
"D: I now see why Fuller's London Pride is amongst the all-time great session brews and a benchmark English pale ale. Just under 5% ABV, this brew is easy drinking, balanced and satisfying as hell. Could stand for a little more warming, sweet earthy flavors from the malt, but its close to perfection for the style."
"Very drinkable!"
"D - Very drinkable beer. In my opinion much more flavorful than say Bass. Good hops and malt balance. very close to an ipa. Refreshing yet not light in taste."
"- Overall I am very impressed.. tasty. Well balanced pale... scent is robust, but yet taste is full of flavor, but light.... very nice English pale."
"This would be a great beer to have anytime during the day when I am not looking for hoppiness. I wish this was available in Delhi. I would have loved to dedicate a few evenings to this one."
"Pours a copper color with a slim white head. The aroma is of toffee malt and caramel malt with hints of green fruits present, and a slight earthy hop smell. The smell is complex yet very faint. The taste has a caramel malt backbone with toffee included. The green fruit is there but not very pronounced, the end has a mild earthy hop presence. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated with a creaminess to it. Overall this is a very solid beer, it is a very smooth and easy drink. Nice flavor to keep your intereest with nothing distracting."
"I suppose it may be simply related to freshness and serving style -- the normal market for this beer seems to be as a cask beer in pubs very close to the brewery, but I had it on-tap in Japan. I'm not sure if I'll get this again here, but I definitely want to try it in London!"
"D.-Wouldnt be hard to polish down a few of these. Flavor lacks depth. I imagine they pound these like Bud lights in Britain."
"D: A nice English Pale Ale, works great with salty/fat pub food as well as on it's own."
"Beer is medium bodied and has a nice malt character. Finishes cleanly, highly drinkable. Flavors are subtly layered. Great mouthfeel. Very creamy and smooth."
"One of my favorite English Pale Ales available in the States. I finally get to try it fresh on cask, and it is even better. The standard for the style as far as I am conserned. Highly recommended. Also, the cask clip says it is at 4% ABV. Very much a session beer on cask."
"Amber with a fine cascading head of light tan bubbles that settles to a whipped foam and leaves scrappy lace on the glass. Clean, herbal hops and caramel malt. A perfectly trad smelling EPA. Lightly toasted grain and earthy hop notes balance well. A simple but well made beer that I'm sure would shine on cask but that is not an option. Creamy, with smooth carbonation. This is the best EPA I can get in the U.S."
"The tang of the fruitiness coats the mouth from beginning to end. Soft and smooth drinking. Stable session beer. Brooklyn Pennant Ale is similar to this. I would take this over the Brooklyn any time."
"I had high expectations for this Pale ale. Got a 6 pack and don't know if i got a defective 6 pack because this smelled and tasted like medicine. Just not a good flavor and the mouth feel and drinkablity was just so so. I Like Sam Smith's Pale ale much better but so far, I know I am crazy to say so ... I just like Sam Adams Pale ale better than any others I have tried."
"O: A nice beer with a lot of flavor for something under 5%. This would be great off a cask!"
"Very nice pale ale. Nice coppery appearance in the tulip glass I poured it into. I was impressed with the nose it had. Picked up a trio of these at the EMart in Seoul and must admit I will walk down there again for some. I can taste the slight bitterness and hoppiness I was hoping for. Nice mouthfeel, pleasant to the palate. As fa as drinkability goes, I could certainly have another, especially if you are treating. Cheers, old mate, let's split a six pack in the car park."
"Overall, a very easy drinking and satisfying beer. Nothing overdone, but nothing missing. Love this stuff."
"Good balance of sweetness and bitterness. A bit crisp with very light body."
"My first beer from Fuller's and a great one to start. I can't wait to get hold of the rest of their range."
"No wonder this is a top selling beer in the UK"
"D: The way this beer tickles your tastebuds and dances in your mouth has me wanting more, but eventually I'll want something just a hair stronger."
"M/D: Thin with low carbonation. Very drinkable."
"The caramel malt is present in the nose, one can feel the taste of bread and cereals, are sometimes perceived even fruit, but it must be said that they are quickly masked by the power of sweet caramel in the olfactory senses. Easy drinking, smooth mouth, although malt, hops and a mastery of the finish, all power, and a touch earthy, where all the bitterness of the drought spreads for long, and for a really long time, in the mouth and palace. Pretty nice."
"D: very easy, low abv make for a very sessionable ale."
"D - easily drinkable. Perfect to have a few pints with some good food. Great for it's balance and nice flavor."
"D - I wasn't actually expecting much flavor out of this kind of beer, but I was really surprised at the punch of flavor it has! Just as sessionable as an APA to me, I could drink more than a 6pk I'd say. I liked it, I think I'd buy it again sometime. Recommended."
"Session-able, definitely. I wouldn't mind have a few of these on a mild evening."
"D: Rather drinkable because of the smooth body and agreeable flavor profile. However, nothing about this beer excites me. Ordinary taste, ordinary nose, and all of it very low key and toned down. I'd have it again, but this beer is very forgettable so I won't be going out of my way for it."
"Poured from a 500 ml can. The beer pours a nice orange color with a large white head. The head is very fluffy and soft. The aroma is bready malt with some earthy hops. Very British smelling. The flavor is bread, toffee, grass and some spicy and earthy hops. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"The taste has similar elements, mostly caramelized grain and toasty bread, light tea/leafiness, light citrus. It is light but very flavourful and solid, with great depth and staying power, never degrading. It's exceedingly drinkable."
"Easy drinking."
"Drinkability: Simple but flavorful...and oh so enjoyable. This is a great brew, and the empty bottles are perfect for throwing at rival hooligan firms."
"Color was amber with barely any head. Not much in the way of aroma, I thought that were would be a more noticeable hop aroma. Honestly the beer tasted a little watered down, more so that normal cask beers. The most prominent taste that came through was the challenger hops."
"An ideal session ale for any occasion. It's a real easy beer to drink and I could see myself polishing off a few of these in a row. It offers a nice flavour profile. Nothing crazy in terms of flavour but far from boring. A nice all around ale."
"Very good, easy drinker. Not gonna wear you out at all."
"D: An extremely drinkable Best Bitter... very tasty, and a fantastic session ale."
"I can't say enough about this beer or about Fuller's for that matter. They have yet to let me down. Two thumbs way up. Pick it up if you can. A terrific EPA."
"It's hard to make a beer that's this simple and yet this delicious. I wouldn't call Fuller's London Pride a hugely complex beer, but this is definitely harder-than-it-looks territory. A nearly perfect beer for what it is, perhaps my favorite English Pale Ale."
"I think I prefer Rogue Dead Guy Ale to this one, it compares nicely. Sometimes the fullers I get are not as fresh tasting as I would like, but for bottle conditioned I think that might be normal."
"Pours a golden orange colour with about a finger of white head. Head retention all the way down, with minimal lacing. It smells of floral hops and biscuit. A nice level of bitterness in the taste. Some floral hops and I think I'm getting some citrus coming through. A bread flavour too I think. Very crisp and smooth, yet a bit bubbly on the tongue. I really enjoy this beer and it is more of a gulper than a sipper for me. I could drink several of these in a row without being tired of it. One of the best of the style that I've had (not including cask ales)."
"11.2oz. bottle served in a shaker pint. Poured a clear gold with a thin white head. Light hop aroma with some fruity yeast aroma. Light bodied. Soft and fruity in that English style. Some bready malt and mild hoppiness. Very drinkable. Classic English style that should not be served too cold."
"D - Very, very easy to drink."
"Taste follows with a balanced sweetness and a light bitter sense. Offers a moderate carbonation which provides a perky feel throughout. Touch of spice on the finish. Feel is light and subtle yet yields an easy drinkability."
"Drinkability - In spite of the above comments, this beer was pounded all evening from a half-gallon growler. I completely enjoyed it, and bought another six-pack for a future night's session. Like their London Pride Porter, Fuller's never fails to deliver... :)"
"This thing is mild, but very good. A nice beer."
"Mouthfeel lots of flavors come together and cancel each other out, a little pricey and when you're done, you want something with a little more oomph."
"D- Very moreish. The easy mouthfeel with a tasty backbone make this an excellent quaff."
"Notes: Solid offering from a solid brewery. Has that quintessential British feel to it. Easy to drink. Worth getting. It won't amaze you but it is a great beer to just sit back with and enjoy a few."
"M & D - Nice CO2 balance and medium to light body. Nice ho character and balanced well with the malt sweetness. Delicious beer."
"D: Very drinkable brew. Try one on. You'll see that it fits rather nicely."
"Nice 1 finger head upon pour. Aromatic and hoppy without being an overwhelming hop bomb. Well balanced taste and aroma, light copper color and very drinkable with no worries of getting bombed anytime soon. This is the type of pale ale I prefer along the lines of Sierra Nevada Pale Ale and similarly balanced offerings. I have not found London Pride anywhere else on tap in the city and I'm glad I had the chance to try this."
"Overall- decent beer. There's enough taste to keep you interested for a session and I figure I could put down 8 of these easy without getting IPA'd."
"D: High. That's a beer that I would drink the all day long: God save the Fuller's!"
"D: Outstanding. English pub + cask conditioned ale + dreary overcast skies = London Pride"
"Damn I want to try this in the UK straight from the cask."
"Has a dark orange-amber color with a beige head that goes away relatively quickly. Aroma was a little faint, but what i got was some toffee and bread. The taste was very good. Initially a little hoppy, but going down you can really taste the mix of toffee and buttery bread. Carbonation was about right, didn't kill the thickness of it. A bit pricier since it's an import, but the best English Pale Ale I've had and would definitely buy again."
"a translucent orange body, sorta lie copper or a slightly lighter orange blossom honey. slight malt notes. a solid malty body, chewy and a bit hoppy, hell of a lot better than the nose. this is a solid english pale ale, solid body of hops and malts, nothing to let you down initial taste is a bit bitter with mostly malts. the feel is great, perfect for this kind of beer: thick but highly drinkable."
"I could drink this bad boy all day long/"
"Good, but seems like it's missing something. Feels like a shy beer made to please many."
"D: I find this would be a great beer to start off the craft beer experience. It mixes to a nice balance which wouldn't be off putting to anyone. Very session-able beer, but I'd prefer a beer with more going on."
"Drinkability : a good beer in the style English bitter."
"Drinkability is high, due to the lower [4.7%] alcohol content and the clean, smooth taste. Certainly could go for a few, but not quite a session beer, in my opinion. This is the 2nd time I have tried this beer and most definitely not the last time!"
"The body is moderate to light. There is a dry feel to it and could use a touch more sweetntess to balance. Some sudsy notes on the back end as well. Overall very easy to drink and clean."
"Plenty of taste in this one yet light enough to drink more of no problem. I'd choose this ale with some nice taste over a lager that may not have as much taste for a session any day."
"D: A great beer from Fuller's...now if only I could find this on cask..."
"D-just the benchmark for this style. Really incredible."
"D: absolutely drinkable in every way!"
"Quite tasty. Biscuity malts matched with a better-than-average hop presence with some notes of citrus in there. Carbonation was lively, which I would consider a plus, too. Very drinkable, if you feel like pounding more than one 500ml bottle at a sitting."
"D - Overall this is a good session beer that I could drink a few of in a night worth a try."
"Excellent ale, a very enjoyable session."
"D - This is a pretty fast drinking session beer. It does get a little sweet after a while, and could use perhaps a hint of bitterness to make things more balanced, but otherwise I could put down a few of these in an evening."
"T- It has a coffeeish aftertaste. Tastes like alcoholic chocolate milk. Smooth, yet has a bite. Some burnt sugar, molasses in there."
"Drinkablity: Good classic session brew. Very drinkable. I always enjoy any time I spend drinking this brew."
"Overall, this is a pretty solid beer and a good example of the style, of which I must admit I am not a huge fan. Not a lot of huge taste in this beer, but it's nice and light and pretty sessionable."
"It would be nice to have this on just straight CO2."
"To use and English phrase, it's ""not my cup of tea."""
"pour of off amber with a mild yellow head. the nose is grape malt sweet with geranium... palate that is quite english apple and grape. quite simple but quite drinkable. little bit a citrus but was a rather old can. some bitter but accents the citrus and floral qualities."
"Bottle to glass. Amber color, poured with almost no head. Malty aromas, a little yeast. Taste is malt-forward, a bit of hop on the back end. Not a big beer, but flavorful. Very good, well rounded beer, no harsh edges, I tend to like this style, although I think Bass pulls this off a bit better."
"D: Very easy drinking. This beer really is a piece of art. It takes some real skill to balance a beer this well. No its not an imperial anything, but it is executed perfectly, and can be easily enjoyed pint after pint."
"D - Easy to drink but not something I would want again and again."
"Coppery brown pour. Low level of carbonation. Smells like caramel and brown sugar -sweet and malty. Tastes a little less than it smells. This is not really to its detriment though, considering the beer is fairly session-able. Metallic tasting hops are fairly prominent. It helps that the place I had it at had there carbonation levels right."
"	The restrained hop flavor is most notable to me. I realize that European hops are by nature less expressive than the very assertive American hops, but this to me defines our nations, particularly the West coast hop-heads compared to our across the pond neighbors. I know what people must be thinking, an Irish-American New England boy must hate the British for innumerable reasons, but don't get me wrong, I respect the style and the nation and realize what was aimed to be achieved in this beer was undoubtedly achieved, and I enjoyed it. What's more, I prefer English barleywines to extreme American ones. However, with the restrained hop flavor, I can't help but imagine that these hops are screaming to shed their suit, tie and bowler cap on Savile Row, in exchange for some tie-dye and Birkenstocks on Haight-Ashbury to let their hop flag fly!"
"Overall, I'm glad to say I've now tried one of the classic English pale ales. Didn't blow me away, but I wasn't expecting it to. It does deserve its status as a classic. From now on, it will be an obvious choice when I get a hankering for a pale ale."
"D- 16oz of this goes down as easy as 12oz of most other pales. I like the subtle complexities created with the simple ingredients"
"The mouthfeel is a bit thin, and gets bubbled a little by overcarbing. The drinkability is still pretty high though, this beer goes down pretty easily and is far from offensive."
"Superbly crisp and refreshing... if I lived in England and had a lawn, I'd drink this after yardwork every day."
"D: I'm not a fan of this style at all, but when in Rome... So I wound up drinking this several times in London, and grew to appreciate it for what it is. It's not something I'd buy here, but it'll be a staple on that side of the pond if I go back."
"Drinkability is quite good. No lingering aftertaste to put you off. I would say this is a pretty good session beer."
"Pours medium amber with modest sized white head. Nose is on the lighter side with toffee/caramel sweetness. On the palate this ale shows to be a very drinkable, light & refreshing pale that is clean with gentle citrusy hops in the balance. Unlike so many extreme beers that violate any sense of the word 'balance', this is one of the best examples of balance. Very good."
"Mouthfeel - watery smooth with carbonation that's a bit too low. No coursness here."
"I truly adore this beer, as it is a very drinkable and a very tasty english pale ale. I could probably go all night drinking just this one and Fuller's ESB, one after another."
"had this at brits pub on a beautiful fall evening we sat outside on the rooftop..the look was a darker color than most EPA with a quickly dissipating head that left an ok ring..the smell was was caramel malts and toffee the taste was bitter sweet malts and toffee with some hops and spice it was ok/above average taste it went well with the fish and chips... overall a pretty tasty ale but the deck and evening on the roof set the tone it was beautiful outside and the food was great the beer was just average"
"D-This beer is very VERY drinkable. I would be very happy to session this beer all night long."
"Pours a drak copper with slight cloudiness. Slight head that quickly dissipates. Sweetish aroma, with hops and minerals detectable in the background. Mineral, slightly metallic notes in taste in addition to hops in the background. Mouthfeel is decent, though a bit thin with very subdued carbonation. Moderate drinkability. Not a bad beer, but I believe I have had better representatives of the style."
"Drinakbility: Great pint. It's served in nearly every London pub for a reason."
"D - This is just average for the style. The beer lacked any resemblance of a hop and the water was not hard enough to remind me of a Special Bitter in style. Not a very good example although BJCP believes it to be."
"overall - don't accept a Carlsberg if you're flying BA - have some Pride."
"With a flavor that's strong without being overbearing, a thoroughly pleasant finish and aftertaste, a nice, creamy smooth body and quite a low ABV, I have to say this one has the highest drinkability of anything I've had yet."
"EDIT: Had again at the Brick Store and I feel as though the hops were more robust than I remembered. Still not overpowering but they held more sway."
"-Bye"
"The body was smooth and well balanced and the beer coats the tongue without being sticky. The drinkability on this beer is very nearly perfect, great flavors combined with low ABV creates a most wonderful session beer. Worth having repeatedly."
"Mouthfeel was smooth and the body was light to medium."
"OVERALL: An enjoyable English pale ale, and drinks away quite easily. This one is available all over the place, and sometimes we lose things that are right under our noses. Pick one up and enjoy it again."
"D: Quite easy to drink, reasonable ABV."
"Over all, this is a very nice English Pale Ale. It's a bit tough for me to rate it on it's own merits, because I tend to prefer hoppier American Pale Ales, but London Pride is a great example of the English style, and I come back to it on a semi-regular basis."
"I don't know if I got a bad bottle or batch, but this beer just seemed to have a lot of rookie mistakes and problems in it that I wouldn't expect from such a historic brewery. The first time I see this beer on tap or cask, I will make sure to try it and review it."
"Another classic session beer, a dream for cask conditioned lovers, like me."
"Drinkability is great. This makes a fantastic session beer and I had 3 more to follow this one."
"M/D-This is a great ale that I will be buying again. It isn't too high on the abv scale and it wont be too hard to drink. Enjoy!"
"A clear orange body supports a finger of foamy white head. Some good lace and fine retention. Excellent aroma of lemongrass, bread and herbal hops. Lemon upfront with a herbal finish. Slightly soapy, but well done and sessionable. The bitterness never exceeds moderate at any point, but does maintain its presence from first sip through to the finish. Medium-light body is about par for the style. This is a nice easy-drinking beer. It doesn't wow me, but I think it would be easy to kill a few of these in an evening."
"Drinkability: decently high, I put this higher on my drink list"
"Body between light and medium with low carbonation. Very smooth. A sessionable & easy drinking pale ale."
"Interesting enough to serve as a session beer, but too mild for my palate. Kind of unremarkable. It's good but not great. I can't really describe what's missing."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. One finger head that quickly because just a ring over orange amber ale. Smelled the way I expect an English Pale Ale should, plenty of malt without alot of hops. The taste reminds me of an English Pub. Sip after sip of how I imagine ale has tasted for a long time. Fills the mouth and coats the tongue with a clean malt taste. Smooth and definately drinkable."
"One of my first gateway craft brews was Schlafly Pale Ale made in St. Louis. I didn't understand what they were trying to emulate back then, now I know the standard they were going for was and still is Fuller's London Pride. Good stuff!"
"D: Exceptionatly drinkable. Excellent flavor, low ABV and refreshing finish."
"D - Considering the above LOW"
"What can I really say? Crisp, clean, and wetting to the palate."
"It is good but something about just doesn't work for me."
"Mouthfeel is very light with light carbonation. Possibly a little watery but overall it was pretty good. Flavor is well balanced and this is an easy drinker but I would probably get tired of it after a couple of these anyway. Good to try but not so exciting that I'd want more than a couple."
"D: Pretty high, it's quite good and easy drinking."
"Enjoyed this draught 'in country' at a wedding about 5 years ago. This one served from a can. Pours a light amber color with a loose full finger white head that fades fairly quickly leaving spotty patterns of lacing behind. The smell is really nice...way malty and rich with a unique earthy character. Lightly carbonated, the mouth feel is light bodied and the texture is creamy. Full flavored, the earthy malted notes are mirrored exceptionally well in the taste. At 4.7% ABV these are a perfect fit for the REQUIRED nooner-at-the-pub...then back to work. Very drinkable...defining style. Bringing back the memories. Consider one again...soon!!!"
"Really solid appearance, and a basic but formidable nose. Great balance in the flavor. Also not complex, but that's what you should be expecting from this style anyway. It is very full though. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
"D- No question one of the best beers that I've had the opportunity to enjoy. It's refreshing enough to enjoy out on the patio, and would make an excellent session beer out at the pub with a good meal. I highly recommend this and would say that this is the best Ale I've come across so far!"
"Mouthfeel is crisp, yet smooth. Well done. Now the flavor on this is a conundrum. It tastes like beef stew with potatoes to me. Very beefy. No sweetness, but a hint of hoppy bitterness; not citrus or piney, mind you, but rather beefy. This is weird. I'll give it another shot if I see it on tap, but this is really different. What type of malts make up a meaty flavor?"
"D- hoppier than most EPAs i've had and less sweet. being a toasty and dry english ale must have its advantages because this bottle disappeared in a flash."
"A dam fine tasting beer. Very smooth and creamy and a low abv make this one very easy to drink."
"Complex, floral taste with smooth finish. Nice coppery color. Ideal session beer."
"D -- Very good drinkability. BJCP calls this a Best Bitter and lists it as the top for style, but I think I'd only give it straight 5s if it were from the cask."
"drinkability is good - low abv and still mighty tasty"
"D: Worth trying once but not the most interesting beer. Drinkable but not a lot else to recommend it."
"D--Solidly drinkable, but not something begging me to reach for more. Maybe one day I will drink a fresher one and see if there is any difference"
"This is a drinkable English Pale, but I'd like the flavor to be a little more malty."
"A half liter bottle poured into my Imperial pint glass. This ale appears a hazed deep copper color with about two fingers of lingering, light ecru foam. A nice looking pour. Nose and flavor are of rich caramel malts, fruity figs, bitter hops, biscuits. Satisfying body with ample carbonation. Always a treat."
"500ml brown bottle obtained at McKinnon's in Salem, NH. Pours a translucent amber-golden body with a half inch of short-lived off-white head. Caramel and toffee malts with a touch of butter in the aroma. Caramel, butter, toffee, touches of chocolate and coffee, with a fair bit of minty herbal English hops. Medium-bodied with moderate carbonation. Moderately drinkable, mostly due to the flavors not quite meshing the way I'd like, particularly the butter, and I'm thinking this may not be the freshest sample. Having said that, it's still a relatively decent English pale ale..."
"Overall: a supremely drinkable beer. Perhaps the standard for English pale ales. I could drink this all night. Very well done."
"Drinkability: lower alcohol and watery mouthfeel increase this characteristic"
"A decent drop, good for a cleansing ale. Typical English fare though."
"If you don't try this beer, you are missing out!"
"Poured with a ginormous, fluffy head that hung around all night. Hops and nice biscuity malt witha touch of dried fruits on the nose are quite inviting. Delivers big time on the palate with a prickly bitterness and a long malty finish. A very satisfying and drinkable ale."
"One of the best English Pale Ales out there for sure. This one is very sessionable, I only wish it wasn't such a high cost."
"A solid clear amber pour with a quarter inch head that lasts and lasts and mixed with a mildly fruity, noble hop bitterness that is second to none, a super sweetness greets the tongue and does not let go for one minute this is an amazingly drinkable beer that makes you forget you are drinking one,"
"Overall, not a waste, but not that great."
"D: Great drinkability. I put this one down in under 5 minutes while eating, having already had 2 beers and an appetizer beforehand. It was really great to drink on a spring day in an outdoor setting, and was exactly what I was hoping it would be. Fuller's makes great beer, and I hope to get around to trying more of it soon."
"This will not be the last of these I have tonight."
"Poured a seethru light golden body with a two-finger white head. A mix of hops and subdued malts in the smell. Smooth and tasty with a bready, slightly sweet malt taste and some bitter leafy hops. Blended well in a medium-body for a beer that passes over the tongue easily and with some flavor and has a slightly crisp, citric hop backbite. I could relax with this anytime."
"'nuff said, Cheers!"
"So next time I am looking for it on tap or cask, very solid offering and a great example of a EPA and pub beer."
"doesnt take long to polish off a half litre of this stuff. there is still something about it thats not quite right and i cant put my finger off it. probably needs a fresher hop aroma which i suppose the trip down here wouldnt help. other than that, very enjoyable."
"Might possibly try this beer again from a bottle, or on tap, to see if there's a difference in the carbonation and mouthfeel. Otherwise, this was slightly disappointing for the title 'England's Finest Premium Ale""."
"Drinkability: Not for me. This beer has two dimensions, but kind of fizzles. I will not be having this one again"
"An easy going copper ale with a sticky white head. Smells malty and a little sweet. Exceptional crystal malt flavor in a delicate balance with English hops. Light in flavor and feel. It would be very easy to drink large quantity of these. Nothing overwhelming about this beer. A quintessential English pub beer."
"Drinkability- I'm liking these English beers I am having lately. Super easy to drink and flavorful. Could drink these all day."
"Mouthfeel: Excellent mouthfeel. Somewhat chewy and substantial."
"D - A perfectly balanced and extremely drinkable session beer that makes me long for London and the Churchill Arms (see my avatar)."
"pours an amber color. i got a 1 finger head, with moderate lacing. smells or sweet malt, and some hops, kinda earthy. Tastes bready,has a pretty good carbonation. Getting a bit of bitterness but its okay here. little fruity, this is a pretty smooth drink for me. would LOVE to give this one a try on tap. im really liking this one the more i drink it! This brew, at the present time, is my favorite pale ale."
"Beer tastes decent but stays behind in its class. Somewhat malt and hop flavor, seemed well balanced but again way below for its class."
"A very easy to drink, flavourful pale ale, one we in the New World seem unaccustomed to, for much too long, but now no more - if I see this on tap in your so-called better pubs around town, I am not hesitant to immediately order it, as it is quite obviously the embodiment of an inimitable session ale."
"Extremely drinkable. A perfect English ale, in a can no less."
"A dandy pale ale that has a solid malty nose and taste with a nice bite of hops as it goes down. Pours with a loose pile of foam that sticks nicely to the sides of the glass, releasing plenty of caramel and a tad of citrus. A great accompaniment to chicken sausages or even a chicken sandwich, and a good one to keep on hand for general drinking. A bit less punch than Fuller's 1845; nice and mild. A favorite!"
"A solid brew that would be ever so good on draught(although Cornwall's I believe still does have it, hmmm). A perfect accompaniment with my wife's fantastic fish'n chips (or rather, onion rings in Fuller's batter!.A lovely honey-brown pour with good inch & a half white head and good lacey cling. A slight apple aroma with bread-malt. The flavor is a nice balance of mild malt & hop with a hint of caramel. Smooth and fantastically drinkable."
"D: Probably one of my favorite EPAs; sessionable, simple, and enjoyable."
"my number one session beer so far."
"Drinkability - just a joy to partake in. The rich flavour requires moderation so a couple of these would be the limit."
"Pours a pretty clear amber orange colored body with a smalllish creamy, white head, that's lasting. Has a malty grainy grapey aroma. A molasses-y, watery grainy taste, very malty. Tastes very English-like. Very grapey."
"You can taste the grain and bread malt with the first drink. The malt is definitely the first thing that grabs my attention. I enjoy a brew where the malt is prominent and has a strong grainy taste to it. Next, you taste the sweetness I referred to earlier. It is a good combination with the malt. The hops provide a bitterness that becomes prominent in the aftertaste. London Pride finishes clean and very refreshing for a medium bodied brew."
"D: A super sessionable and very tasty English Pale. Classic and extremely easy to drink."
"well it was served on the hand pump at kclingers in hanover. i had the second draft poured and it was a light yellow in color. the head was perfect about an inch of head.a little more than room temp but that was ok since it was shipped in the middle of a cold spell. went down too smooth as all hand pumps do. the lacing on the mug was phenomenol as well..."
"D - Good Pale Ale, and a great addition to Stein's"
"D-Off the charts! This has got to be one of the most quaffable brews out there. Just enough flavour and hop goodness to keep you interested and a nice low ABV to keep you upright! A true English classic...best enjoyed fresh on cask...you can keep the bottle...give me the hand pull!"
"Soft supple carbonation. Extremely refreshing, thirst quenching."
"D- A very nice beer. ""Kick back and relax"" ."
" A fine English pale ale, very drinkable and a fine example of the style"
"D- Overall a pleasant and drinkable beer. My only dissapointment is that I bought it as part of a mix and match set and don't have another to follow it up."
"Pours a clear amber color. 1/4 inch head with decent retention and good lacing. Smells of some hops (English characteristics) and some slight malt aroma. Fits the style of an English Pale Ale. Has a really smooth mouth feel. Also, there is a crisp mouth feel along with low carbonation. Tastes of some dry malt and hops. The aftertaste is all hops. There is a dryness inherited from the malts that leaves you wanting more. Overall, a good example of the style - worth a try."
"20 ounce pint glass, served on-tap in a Fuller's pint glass at The Pub, Columbus, OH (Polaris). The beer pours an amber/reddish color with about an inch off-white head. Lacing and head retention were both very good. The aroma is nice, it smells like toasted malt, apples and light hops. It tastes like toasted malt, ginger, blackberries and some English earthy amd fruity hops. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it has just the right amount of carbonation to make this very enjoyable. Drinkability is good too, it's very smooth and easy to drink. It's great on tap, an English classic that's quite sessionable. A very pleasant surprise, if you get a chance to try it (especially on-tap) you should."
"This beer poured an amber/copper color with generous white head that lasted for a while. Aroma is of caramel malt, spice, and light hops. Flavor has all of this and perhaps some light fruit such as pear. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, but not unpleasant. Low alcohol combined with nice flavor make this a great session ale."
"Overall: There is a light powdery, chalky mouth feel. The finish is astringent, there was a slight bitterness too. Overall it is an ok beer not great but okay"
"8/4/6/3/12 (3.3/5)"
"D: a lot of history with this brew, but give me an APA in place of this guy. A good beer that relies on sweetness and malts rather than hops...thin overall"
"A nice two finger, fluffy and rolling tan head results from a pretty hard pour. As the head cautiously recedes it leaves behind thin, but tall sheets of staggered lacing. The burnt orange color is slightly broken by an array of carbonation bubbles that stick to the glass right below the froth. The hops and malts blend into a pleasant, almost subdued aroma. Behind that lie some faint notes of honey, nuts, and fruit, which leads to a complex aroma for a pale ale. Taste is bigger on the malt up front, with some very slight hoppiness filtering in behind, with not much of the aromatic complexities existing, which results in a light-bodied brew that is very sessionable."
"Overall, this is a fairly simple and easily drinkable ale."
"(rated Feb 26, 2008)"
"This is a great Pale Ale. I feel this is a moderately tasting beer that fits in well with style guidelines. Moderate malt up front while following with a moderate hop bite. In today's world of imperial this and double that a well made Pale tastes real good. Color light gold, some lacing and no off odors or tastes. The name of Pride of London seems to fit. Though I will agree that the ESB is a hard beer to beat."
"Not cheap at 3 pounds a pint, but worth it."
"I don't understand brewers sometimes. This is a good beer, but their ESB is much better. Unsurprisingly, this beer is very similar to the ESB: same look, same head, similar aroma. But, the London Pride lacks the bittersweet bite of its cousin. This version is sweeter and malty, but without the hoppy finish. A good beer, but the ESB should be called the pride of London."
"Drinkability is off the chart. This is the definition of a session beer. Great balance, great flavour, I could drink these all night."
"Pours a dark amber color with a foamy head. Malty aroma with a nice amount of biter hops. Extremely smooth tasting session beer. A nice malty base perfectly balanced out by a nice bitter hop finish. Excellent!"
"M/D - A perfet best bitter, such a good balance of complexity and drinkability!"
"The wonderful balance and drying finish means this is definitely a poundable beer. Unfortunately, it also makes this a somewhat forgettable brew."
"This poured a clear gold with a bit of white head. It smelled very faint, like a bit of barley malt and copper hops. It tasted like barley and caramel malt with copper hops and a bit of sweet yeast. It was watery with some carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste. Overall this was not terribly different than the Fuller's ESB - good but not great. Its flavor and body were both decent. This was cleaner than the ESB, but very generic."
"Very drinkable beer that I envision is a good example of the style."
"Not a bad pale ale. I think there's some confusion on here with the ""Outstanding Pale Ale"" and this. I would revisit this beer."
"Overall, this beer was very enjoyable. It's nothing that will make you drive to the store the next day to buy them out of stock, but a very nice everyday beer. The mouthfeel was wonderful, and the taste was refreshing."
"Overall not terribly complex but an easy drinker. This could def. be a session beer. A nice solid beer overall."
"I poured this attractive looking 1 pint 0.9 oz bottle into a pint glass. This beer pours an amber color with a frothy off white head that quickly disappears. The smells is sweet and fruity, almost honey like. The taste is malty, mellow and sweet, finishes bitter. The mouthfeel has medium body and medium carbonation. Drinkability is excellent. If the price was not so high I could drink a few of these. Overall this could be my favorite pale ale."
"d - damn, fullers owns. Every beer I have by these guys is top notch thus far. This beer reminds me of a sam adams boston lager (though obviously in a different class) with a much more interesting hop profile. The bitterness in this beer hits you like most but drops off completely for a clean finish which is different. This is very drinkable."
"good carbonation. mid body. i like it. will drink again. gonna try to find it on draught."
"Bright copper color with a thin head of tiny white bubbles and quite a bit of lace. The smell is buttery caramel and toasted malt with a fair dose of diacetyl. In the background is a bit of English spicy hop. The taste is very bready great grain profile here with caramels and buttery biscuits underneath the grain is a strong hop profile solid bitterness and even a moderate level of hop flavor, great balance. Finish is a bit sweet at first then the hops come through to round everything off and leave the beer a touch dry. The mouthfeel is pretty lively, enough carbonation combined with the sting of the hops makes this feel likes it's jumping over the tongue, the finish may be just a bit too dry, maybe?. This is a really good English pale ale, granted this is a beer that's been around for a while, but it's nice to see some good representatives of this classic style. A good beer all around."
"Drinkability: I would drink this beer all day if I could and whenever I see it on tap I have a hard time trying something new."
"D: I don't long for the Pale Ale like I used to but if I was to go for one, this would surely be one of them."
"Great medium mouthfeel and lightly carbonated, it finishes the same way it starts..perfect balance....not over hopped or over malted. Just yummy goodness. I love this stuff!"
"I have had this many times from the bottle and now on tap. An excellent beer that is the standard I compare other English pale ales to. Easy to drink, goes well with lots of foods. Good complexity w/o high ABV."
"D- I would have this again, but would not go out of my way; it's a bit thinner than expected"
"D - Like most of the style, a great session beer. Though this may not jump out at anyone, it's lack of off-flavors and near perfect balance are a testament to craftsmenship."
"Drinkability: A fairly tasty, easy-drinking English treat. Sure, it's something to have pride in and sure, I'd have another (or four)!"
"Taste: London Pride has a dark and rich malty flavor that is light in hops."
"Mouth is light and crisp, definitely a good session beer without a doubt. Great to go with a dinner or for a casual evening. Not overly impressive but a English Ale no doubt."
"I will have to try this again under better circumstances (on the ground for example). They might have effected its carbonation, but Heineken on a plane usually seems to keep its CO2 pretty well."
"Overall: Solid offering for a mid abv English ale. Getting this is a 4-pack of 500mL cans is quite a treat here in BC."
"It's very easy drinking, with a light mouthfeel, but a much nicer, more complex english pale then a lot of other offerings in Australia."
"D - this is great due to its balance and extremely mild bitterness. I could imagine having many pints of this in a sitting."
"Lightly hoppy but rather pleasing and smooth, London Pride is one of those beers that you can give an AB drinker to try and ease them into craft brews."
"A classic English beer and I could easily down 3 or 4 of these without flinching."
"D: Good drinkability, well balanced and six pack worthy."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, there is a reason everyone knows this name and it is considered a great representaion of the style. If you have not had this beer you should."
"A very drinkable beer. I would definitely drink this beer in a session. I really like that it is balanced between the hops and the malts, with a variety of flavors that go in and out with each sip."
"D-Easy to quaff and very smooth."
"I'm becoming less and less enamored with British pale ales in general - unfortunately this one is an example of that decline for me."
"I love that this is available in a can, better light protection, and fresher beer!"
"Poured off the tap a great amber color leaning towards slightly orange. Half finger head that faded quickly. Sadly, no lacing and little retention. Very balanced aromas of hops and malts. Flavors are difficult to describe (!?), malts quickly cut by hops. Bitter and very English in style. Dry finish. Smooth and clean. Medium body, medium carbonation. Real beer, very quaffable. In many ways quite middle of the road (nothing outrageous here - how British!) but still a classic and still unique."
"Pours a crisp pale copper with a thin diminishing head. Aroma is some mild Earthy hops and sweet caramel malts. The taste is a nice balance of mildly citrus hops and sweet malts. The beer is light, crisp and refreshing. This is a great example of what a British beer is supposed to be!"
"D: Wow. Low ABV makes this an exemplary session beer. Goes down almost too easily."
"Obviously not as fresh as if I got this in England, it's still a very enjoyable beer. Hopefully this one is still close to the bottling date. Very enjoyable, recommended."
"D= This was a damn fine example of English pale ale. I would recommend this as a good brew to start someone off on that wants to drink good beer but is afraid of overpowering hops. Perfectly sessionable, and another solid offering from Fullers."
"Mouthfeel is thick with a tongue sweater that I didn't want. ... Not a good choice for anyone who doesn't like buttery overly sweet pale ales. The hops need more spotlight."
"This is a well balanced beer with a great complex taste and relatively low ABV."
"Taste-wise, there's malt in the beginning with some earth tones, caramel and toffee. And just as you start to wonder what more there might be the hops kick in and give the ale some well deserved bitterness. The end result is a well balanced ale that's certainly deserving of a try."
"D: this is a go to beer that will not blow you away again and again but will be there with you from drink 1 to drink XXX a true friend."
"Overall, a delicious and classic English pale ale. Don't hesitate to try this one out."
"Overall, this is a great beer. The only flaw is its somewhat watery character. But on the whole, its a solid english ale."
"The carbonation and taste are both understated but well pitched. A creamy, dried fruit start gives way to a fairly delicate and slightly herbal hop finish. I can't really find anything to criticise here. It doesn't knock my socks off but it is well composed and conceived: a superior session beer."
"D: Very drinkable. Good call under any circumstance - if you're just having one or more than one."
"Overall - The Old Toad is probably the only beer worthy pub I have yet to see in Rochester. I was impressed that they had this on tap. It is relatively light compared what I'm used to and easily sessionable. Crisp and refreshing and a good body to satisfy any type of beer drinker. Definitely worth a try or two."
"As I said, you can do much worse."
"The beer is designed to be drinkable and drinkable it is. You could easily drink many of these and you'd be lucky if you did."
"D- Pretty easy drinker. Lower ABV makes drinking more than 1 a real possibility. With greater availability, I could see this being a regular beer in my rotation."
"Pretty solid offering. One of the better ales I've had in London."
"Serving this one a bit warmer brings out another beer equally as good."
"Fulers London Pride is a English classic the apperence an mahogany red and smell good and malty. The taste an excellent all round beer with a malty base, which goes smoothly down the throat and can be drunk to the early hours of the morning. By the way it's a Best Bitter not a EPA."
"d: good but ultimately kind of what i expect from an true english pale i.e a solid all around ale but nothing too special"
"Had this on tap at the Mellow Mushroom Delray Beach, FL. Poured into a pint glass pour an yellow orange with a foamy fluffy head that leaves pretty quickly. Smell is a hoppy lemon grass smell, not over bearing with the hop nice and mellowed out. I was expecting this to be a bit more hoppier was kind of mellowed out I could taste hops, malt and a bit of alcohol burn on this one. Overall a nice product and would drink again."
"Easy to drink beer, but it was a little flat tasting. I will definitely try another though. The fresh bread taste I got from it was really enjoyable...I would just like a little more hops to balance it out."
"The beer poured a clear, honey-amber with a dense, white head into a pint glass. The aroma was of sweet malt with a hint of hops. The taste was the classic English Pale Ale profile - buttery caramel malt sweetness balanced beautifully with subdued hop flavor and a nice, lingering hop bitterness at the finish. Carbonation was low, as it should be, but still there was significant lacing down the inside of the glass - fantastic. Just as I remember the ales in the English pubs I visited years ago."
"NOTE - This beer is always served at room temperature, or slightly below, at most English pubs."
"D: Very sessionable. Probably overly carbonated but not much to knock with a classic like London Pride. Definatley let this beer warm up."
"I tried this beer on November 2, 2007 after purchasing at my local LCBO outlet. The beer poured a translucent gold colour with a large, loose, white head. The aroma is a mixture of malt and hops. The mouthfeel is medium bodied. mild carbonation, and almost 'dry'. The flavour is mainly malt, with some hops, and grassy tomes to round it out."
"Simple but flawless and easily drinkable."
"Pours a heady dark straw/copper color with low carbonation. Respectable lacing down the glass. Smells of light bready malts mixed well with subtle earthy hops. Mouthfeel is light. Slight toffee with bready malts in the mouth with those hops bringing up the rear. Superbly well balanced. A slight toastedness to the malts that becomes nuttier as it warms. Great example of the style."
"cheers to the importers!"
"The taste is full of caramel and buttery hints. The malt flavor is is very nice and perfectly balanced with the hoppiness. There is a pleasant bitterness. The feel is tingly from the carbonation but overall is creamy, slick and smooth. I would glady have 2 or 3 of these in a session."
"This is a very pleasant beer - crisp, drinkable, enjoyable. I'll definitely have it again...."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not filling at all, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a good mild beer with some substance that you can drink for a long time, a quintessential session beer."
"D - Easily drinkable with a nice malt character."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew has a nice copper color, transparent, slight white head with a thin ring around the top of the pour. The smell is of floral hops, there are hints of sourness. The taste of this brew was unusual. There was a hint of vanilla in the hops with some nice tones of sweet spice and a wonderful balance of malt. There is less bitterness that I expect from a pale ale, but the medium body, moderate carbonation, and balance is just right in this beer. Glad to have come across it!"
"D: Yes, it's easily a session beer."
"Immediately evident from the first sip of this beer is the outstanding overall quality. This is an excellent beer all around. Perfect for a session - golden, crisp, clean, and very flavorful. No complaints. Highly recommended."
"Seems to go well with the chicken tikka masala I had for lunch."
"D: I have some misgivings about this beer, but it's not a bad one. The taste could use a bit more complexity in my opinion."
"All together a fantastic session ale. I was hesitant to try this out, but I am very glad I did."
"Mouthfeel is a bit low on carbonation. Creamy and smooth with high drinkability."
"D= very much so."
"Recommended as an excellent depiction of a light, but flavorful brew..."
"Wow! This is a special ale. It poured with a small white head and a light amber body. The smell and taste were full of delicious pale malts and a surprising amount of hops, it almost borders on an APA in style. It was very well-balanced and enjoyable. I have to try it on tap."
"Appearance was a medium amber, with substantial head, possibly due to inadequacy of pump technique (the other pint I had seemed better-poured with less foam waste). I can't comment on smell much unfortch. because my nose is stuffed up like I4 at rush hour. This was my first ever cask ale and I really enjoyed the smooth, clean taste of it. It reminded me of other English pale ales I've had as far as light flavor and a touch of fruitiness. Nice creamy mouthfeel allowed me to go through this one quite quickly."
"The bottle had a good bit more carbonation and a little more of a buttery aroma than the cask version. IMO slightly better in the bottle. Highly recommended."
"D - Sessionable, and quite decent, but nothing to go out of your way to look for. Don't get me wrong, I certainly enjoyed this pale, but I've had better from Fuller Smith & Turner."
"The London Pride is another brew that I've had many times, but I picked up recently for no other reason to review it. I am a little surprised than I am enjoying this one so much. London Pride is always available in Boise.. But apparently I have forgotten my basics. Cheers."
"Read it on page 6 of the mirror, quite a good beer. Quite."
"Rich, full body on this one. Figs and toffee dominate with a little caramel in the finish and some spiciness from the hops. Not much else to say about this one except I highly recommend it. A true classic."
"Excellent session beer, great example of the style."
"Subsequent to this report I had occasion to try the beer again at another location. I am happy to say that Pride was restored; this time the beer showed the complexity and depth of hop and fruit that I recalled from before. It is one of the best draft beers of moderate weight you can get."
"D-Great drinkability. The sweetness/bitterness are completely in balance which makes for an enjoyable refreshing ale. It's hard to stop!"
"very clean and refreshing. goes great with a meal"
"A very refreshing beer. Clear orange/brown colour in the glass."
"Verdict: A lot more drinkable from the can. I just can't get into it though. There's nothing wrong with it and it's much better from a can."
"D - I could drink this beer all day. The sweet breadiness make it very soft and easy to drink, and the slight hops refresh enough to make you want more and more."
"D - Fantastic example of a Pale Ale, would go great with anything."
"Had the bottled version many times, 1st time I saw this canned. In nonic glass poured dark gold w/1 finger head. The smell is definately sweet/malty, w/some floral hop. Taste is very malty. The subtle hop element belies the fact that Challenger, Target and Northdown is the combo. Fuller's got it right on hopping levels. The house yeast lends a fruity element to the finish. Finish is spicy hop and smoothness. Reminds me of Young's Ram Rod. Drinkability is at cosmic level. Stay independent Fuller family, you're one of the last left standing."
"Pours a crystal clear, orange hued straw color. About a quarter inch of head is produced with okay tracing. In the aroma there's a strong floral and citrus lined caramel note. On the palate, a low carbonated beer delivers a strong malt backbone, small amounts of toastiness from Munich or crystal malts, with a floral, slightly bitter finish. Style guidelines say this style should have a firm bitter note, and I simply don't see it. I see this beer as a very drinkable, balanced ale. Body is medium thin, and the low carbonation gives it a very easy drinking feel. I would like to see this beer on cask or nitro to really get a better sense for how it should be served."
"This beer pours a hazy copper color with amber hues. The head is one inch in height and recedes into a nice cap of lacing. The aroma is floral with a firm caramel backbone, and perfumy dark fruit. The taste is a lot like the aroma; plums, dates, and flowers with caramel undertones. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, with moderate carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is a very good pale ale, and a fine session beer. I can see myself drinking this numerous times in the years to come."
"Flavors of rich english malt and clean well balanced hop bitterness. Nothing much else there, but what it does it does very very well. Recommended!"
"appetizing appearance, hazy and crisp amber with frothy white head. smelled malty, sweet, and some hops. tasted of caramel, toffee, malts, and good hop balance. pretty comfortable mouthfeel, sweet presence. the drinkability is excellent, ever hear of a yard of ale? pubkeepers recommend London Pride for this... that's gotta speak for itself"
"No overpowering flavors here, but tasty and enjoyable. Very sessionable beer, high drinkability."
"Overall a very good EPA. Good drinkability and very sessionable."
"Could be fine at a pub but don't examine it too closely. Goes great with salted cashews. Has its ups and downs, in the end I'm neutral about having another. Will switch to Glenlivet for the remainder of the flight."
"Highly enjoyable! I can picture myself sitting in an English pub enjoying a few pints with friends. Not too full but still satisfying. Nice."
"11.2 oz bottle. Pours a clear, copper with a massive white head that is quickly diminishing. Aroma of apple and malt. Flavor is generally tangy, bitter, and a little malty. Aftertaste is short lasting but bitter and pleasant. Extensive lacing, light carbonation, and very light alcohol. I prefer this on tap to the bottle, but very drinkable either way."
"Overall - Very drinkable, just enough flavour to make be pleasantly tasty but not overpowering in any way. A very well rounded and balanced beer. In perfect condition, this could be hitting 4.5's across the board, the definitive session cask ale."
"D - A very good session brew..and very drinkable..I enjoyed it and think it stands up well..not as good as Sam Smith's but good"
"I have had this beer on numerous occasions when in the mood but i really wouldnt purchase a six pack of this beer because it is just a beer you have when the mood strikes you. A good Pale Ale but i am not a huge fan of Pale Ales."
"D = This may be the ultimate ""everyday have a couple pints"" beer, but it is also flavorful and refreshing enough that it could easily by a sipping beer on a hot day or just a good way to relax at the end of the day. I've always liked this beer but in re-tasting it now, I realize it is one of my favorites of this style."
"D: I love it. This is probably the best ale to be had at such low levels of alcohol, I'd love to have a few more of these babies."
"After sampling some local offerings, I ended my session with a classic. Nice pale-amber color, delicious buttery ester aromas with good flavor to match. Drinkablitity is quite easy with a great brew such as this. There isn't anything I can say that hasn't been said about this standard. Great brew, classic example of a Ehnglish Pale."
"Ill miss this one when I go home to Australia."
"Overall: This is a wonderful session beer. It's classic enough to not be complicated, but still be enjoyable. This is an example of English understatement in the best tradition. Not quite as polished as their ESB, but I'd gladly seek it out. I'm anxious to try the draught version as soon as I can."
"Great session beer."
"D: A very drinkable beer. Smooth, light mouthfeel with a good taste that made it very easy to drink. Can definitely drink a lot of these before getting too filled up."
"M&D: the texture is strangely flat for a canned ale, let alone an astonishingly frothy pint! The flat texture here doesn't help the much thinner flavour and body than its real ale form; or, it drinks more like from a tired cask even though the flavour and aroma haven't gone off-ish. All in all, my advice: stick to Cask, while bottles are worth a try if one fails to seek out the cask version. It's not BAD, but this can's performance really doesn't do justice to the goodies of this ale that are supposed to shine, IMHO..."
"cette bière sans mousse de belle arôme de houblon, servie à température pièce, à mon goût nord-américain je préfère la version bouteille mais cest quand même une grande bière. belle couleur, la fait qu'elle soit servie chaude la rend plus liquide en bouche (impression?)"
"D - A smooth session ale to be quaffed."
"Highly recommended. Wouldnt call it ideal for a cold weather beer, but this one is really all purpose."
"Drinkability: Excellent. This would make a wonderful session beer. I'm definitely looking out for this one on tap."
"Immensely quaffable and not too bad out of the can. Bottle is preferable, but can't go wrong with a four pack (and saves a bit on cost). Solid, balanced pale ale."
"D - Nothing outstanding but rather a good, drinkable & flavoursome beer. A few pints wouldn't go astray."
"Overall, this is a highly drinkable session beer. Not my favorite in the style, but a good solid afternoon brew."
"This is a great example of a very drinkable English Pale Ale. It's flavor, alcohol content, and aftertaste lend it to being an excellent session ale. This beer would go great with pub food! :-)"
"I could drink this stuff all night..."
"I think that the ESB is overall a better beer, and if I wanted to try something unusual I might go for the Fuller's Vintage or even Honeydew. This beer is like my comfy old sweater. Old reliable."
"Drinkable: It is extremely easy to drink, one could drink these all night."
"drinkability is great. well balanced, with no trace of alcohol. an excellent ale served in the finest way. still, i would have liked just a bit of carbonation to liven things up."
"Very enjoyable beer,quite tasty and this one is good enough to drink all nite long.Highly reccomend this one.Refreshing and quite mellow enough to last the evening and enough flavor to keep you comming back for more."
"Nov 19 '07 best before date. Dark orange to light amber in color. Very sweet, mildly toasty nose. Brioche with butter and marmalade. Very appetizing. Taste is sweet and fruity with hops that build to try to keep everything under control. Finish is still sweet though, with a wonderful malt aftertaste. More of a simple brew compared to their ESB, but still a beer of much character."
"D: Very good, a bitter or pale ale should be quite drinkable, the low carbonation makes it easy going down. A good session bitter, or pale ale. Fuller's makes another good one."
"Pours a clear copper color with a medium size head that leaves surface lacing. Aroma is faint toasted malt and some herbal hops. Taste is light toasted malt with a lingering herbal bitterness. Nice medium mouthfeel. This definitely would be a sessionable beer. A very solid EPA"
"Poured into a standard pint glass it is a medium shade of reddish-brown. The head on top is like dishwater with bigger bubbles and a thin micro bubble ring around the circumference. The smell is rather mild. Light hops, grass, metal. The taste is also very mild. Malty to start, with a slight and increasing hop flavor. The flavor is really well balanced and with a 4.7% ABV, this is completely sessionable. Overall, a well balanced, well made, mild EPA."
"Drinkability: This beer was somewhat long in the tooth, but it was still drinkable. An decent beer. I'll have to get a fresher bottle next time to compare to this review."
"I'm thinking this was made to be a session beer, it does it so well."
"Drank it at Bishops Arms, Västra Hamngatan, Gothenburg"
"----Drinkability: I would recommend this drink to anyone to be honest. I am not a fan of sweet drinks but this drink in no way over does it. After a nice long day or even as a dessert...this drink does not disappoint."
"A dark amber colored brew with a medium head that held well with lots of lacing. The aroma brought a combination of malt and cider, intriguing. The first taste impressed me with a creamy nuttiness but it also seemd a bit more acqueous than I expected, hard to describe. Not overly carbonated. Some bitterness leaves the tongue a bit dry feeling with malt touches at the back. Quite drinkable, a nice mellow ale with a bit of character. Would like to try again to nail down the complexity here."
"Based on my notes from a few days ago, when I was still trying to figure out how to get logged in here. Fullers London Pride poured out of the tallboy can with a nice smooth, even head; tiny bubbles evidence of good carbonation. A clear amber colour with a grassy nose that made me think of sour dough bread. Refreshingly hoppy with a good bitter after taste. There could be more of a mouthfeel to this brew but it's still very satisfying. I'm a bit biased since this has become one of my favourite imports still readily available in Ontario, but, frankly, this ale has never disappointed me. A good honest start or end to your day, I'll keep putting a few of these in my shopping basket every time out."
"This is one of my all-time favourite English ales; lots of flavours but still highly drinkable."
"Fuller's London Pride pours a reddish orange with a white head from a brown 11.2 ounce bottle. Malt dominates the aroma, but there is a hint of hops. A bit fruity in the taste, there's plenty of malt and a good amount of English hops. This will never be mistaken for a U.S. pale ale but it's quite tasty and holds it's own. Very good, definitely worth a try."
"D - A highly drinkable and flavorful English bitter. Great balance and ale character with a clean finish."
"My favorite EPA so far. But I prefer APA's I like the hops used in the APA's over there English father's. But this is the most flavorful English pale ale that I have had the pleasure of tasting. The beer pours with a thick head that settles down and leaves some lacing behind. Has a light orange colour. The nose is malty, earthy, hoppy with some floral qualities. I also find the palate to be well balanced with malts and hops doing what they do best. Has a slight bitter finish. Smooth and drinkable."
"should be expecting; lookng forward to try their other brews."
"M: Light body with little carbonation."
"It's maybe the best English pale ale I've had, but I can only imagine what this might be like on cask. I'll have to add that review some day. The aroma is of very smooth, buttery caramel with bread and something almost like smoke or meat. The flavor has a decent, grassy and spicy hops profile and a bit of malt in the background. Nice beer, nice beer."
"A respectable, refined PA. A little London pride just rubbed off on me, methinks. Perfect with so many different foods and snacks. Great balance and refined flavor, mate. Cheeri-o. By jove I don't have any more. Bollocks..."
"One of my favorite English Pale Ales which is a style I've kind of moved away from, but every time I have one of these I really enjoy it."
"Pours a clear copper/orange, small white head forms, some nice lacing, good retention. Smell is sweet and malty, honey, grass, minerals, floral/citrus hops. Taste is malty, minerals, honey, citrus/grass, bready, citrus bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation."
"Overall I like it & I'll drink it again."
"Pours a nice red amber color with a light head, not much smell is present, malt is apparent though. Tastes great, more malty than most pale ales, a small chocolatelyness is there, a biscuity maltiness somewhat similar to fat tire. mouthfeel is full and warm i enjoy it alot. very good beef all around."
"""jolly good, I must say"""
"Really classy looking 12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Beer pours a clear copper/amber color with a thin white head that quickly turns into a lace. The aroma features a nice sweet bready malt smell with a touch of caramel and just a hint of biscuits. The taste starts out smooth and malty with some biscuity malts and a spiced buttery dry finish. Overall, this is a very nice English Pale Ale that I certainly wouldn't mind having again. Recommended."
"Purchased at BevMo in Mountain View."
"This is a wonderfully drinkable beer with very nice flavors and a quality appeal. Ranked as an easy drinking it's among the best. I'm sure it blends well with a variety of foods as well."
"A solid ale from head to toe. Drinking this makes me realize how sweet (and hazy) many of our American ales are. Ive got to hand it to that Burton water, it really does add a distinctive crispness (and clarity!) to the ale. I wouldnt mind a bit more complexity in the malt dept., but thats not really what this ale is about. It's aim is balance and drinkability, without sacrficing flavor."
"Hmm...not quite 4s straight across...I must note from experience that from the cask this beer would rate much higher."
"Drinkability - Enjoyed it and did have another one. Don't know how this would taste out of a can/bottle stateside, as most of what Britain has to offer does not travel well. A comforting classic, worthy of a few sessions. Akin to that well-worn jacket or sweater you throw on when there's a chill out."
"It's an alright English pale ale, but I have some issues with the taste. Overall, it's quite average. Others may like this, and it may work better with food, but I think I'll pass on this in the future."
"33cl can. It pours a dark amber and has a cognac-like quality to its appearance. Very minimal head and very few bubbles. The smell has a nice malt but has a sour note to it that I don't care for. The taste is much better than the smell, though. The malt hits up front followed by a nice floral hop back & even better aftertaste. There is an acidity to it but not too pronounced. The sourness comes back a bit in the finish but is subtle. The mouthfeel is a bit thin, not really living up to the malty flavor. It does have a nice silky quality to it. The drinkability is OK. The malt balances the light body. In general, a good choice and in England a great choice. They really do a nice job with the malt/hops balance, each taking over at its own time & making for a nice complexity. Cheers!"
"I was really quite impressed by this. Have seen it many times on cask but always managed to convince myself that it is probably a bog standard brew. Will make a point to try it on cask next time I have the chance. Tough call asking for London Pride in Scotland, seems wrong somehow!"
"Drinkability: Fullers is my favorite English brewer and this one ranks right up there among their brews"
"pours a honey amber color with a three finger beige head that fades to a quarter inch with a patchy lace on the glass. smell is of clover honey and earthy fruit aromas. taste same, bready and malty with a slightly bitter hop end. mouthfeel is light with good carbonation. very drinkable but not quite my taste."
"Solid choice for an easy drinking six pack."
"I am shocked it took me so long to try this beer. Now I just need to find it on cask."
"Pours a big head that goes down and leaves a great lacing behind. The color is golden brown and clear. The head that's left behind after the initial fall is thin, but doesn't break open leaving the beer exposed without head. Smell is very light, I smell a small amount of hops and some good light malty flavors as well. The first thing is a noticeable light bitterness that follows with the sweet malts and in the finish there's a meeting of the two and it's almost a metallic flavor. Yeah, the metallic flavor is very apparent now. Must be old, and I don't know how I would ever get a fresh one in Iowa that's in good conditon. The mouthfeel is a little overcarbonated. Overall I may try this again, if I can find one in good condition that's not too old."
"Kinda restrained in nose & taste. Good balance, though."
"Color is dark transparent brown, with a thin head. Smell is weak but promises a good ale. Flavor is rich and hoppy but not too bitter, with a smooth and crisp feel. This is a very drinkable brew that makes a good companion to a hearty dinner, or stimulating conversation, or both."
"The drinkability is just a tic off. A good solid brew but not one I will bring home again soon. MK"
"Pours an orangish-amber hue. Frothy white head dissipates quickly. Fairly good lacing on my glass as I drink. Smells of fresh sweet fruits, with a bit of a pronounced yeast smell. Taste is smooth and malty a little sweet then fades to a mellow dry pine flavored hop. Doesn't feel very full in the mouth but not too light either, think I was expecting a little more fullness. The carbonation is a little on the low side, but it works well in this balanced brew. I could definetely have a few more of these."
"Great beer, even for a hop addict like me!"
"a remarkably smooth and elegant brew ..."
"A nice one."
"Bought this at a local beer/wine retail store. Have had the ESB before but never the pale ale. The beer pour smoothly into a glass mug with an amber color and one inch of medium bubbles head that dissipate within minutes. Smell is a sweet toasted smell over malts (almost like burnt marshmallow). Taste is medium malt with background fruitiness. Carbonation fits the potency of this beer and it goes down very smoothly. A great beer for a dinner of fish and chips or for sitting on the couch watching the game."
"It does well in the two most important characteristics in beer; toasty/bready malts and hoppy tingling in the taste, and a pleasant sweet smell. But it dissapointed me with its loose ends: a little on the watery side, and a not so lively body. I'll try this again in the future, but for now London Pride will have to settle for being a merely good beer."
"I'd consider this a special bitter instead of a pale. It's very enjoyable, but not overly exciting, a classic."
"This may be a new standby beer for me. It's very enjoyable and has a nice impact on the palate. The more I think about it, the more I've decided that this will be my go to beer when I'm not needing a big hop trip. Drinkability is up there with the low abv. If you haven't tried it yet, it's a must."
"Pours a clear burnt orange color into a pint glass with a one and a half finger cream colored head. Aroma is of sweet caramelly malt with faint hop pressence in there as well. Taste is of sweet and toasted malt up front with a touch of fruit balanced out with a lingering hops bitterness. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth and pleasantly carbonated for this medium bodied ale. This is the definition of a session beer, it doesn't get much more easy drinking than this."
"Comes in a big, heavy bottle that had me thinking it was way more than a 1/2 litre job. Nice copper colored beer that left lots of lacing after the head disappeared. Smell of subtle hops and caramel malt. Taste was carmel malt and lots of bitter hops. Refreshing mouthfeel and very easy to drink. I liked it a lot."
"This has a nice smooth mouth feel with perfect carbonation, which leads me to say that this is a wonderful session brew! Very easy to consume your fair share and then some. I will certianly seek this one out more often."
"Wow, what a contrast to the APAs I'm used to. The beer has a very modest, yet strong hop profile, which comes through more in the finish. Up front is a nice balance of malts, giving off a balanced, somewhat fruity (bananas and pineapple) flavor. Mouthfeel was full and creamy. Even though the beer is on the filling side (especially for such a light beer) I could have several. This was my introduction to English pale ales, and I came away quite impressed."
"Pours a golden amber with a thin head that receded fairly quickly. Smelled biscuity and malty. Taste was smooth and malty with the buttery undertones characteristic of an English pale ale. It had a nice, smooth, full-bodied mouthfeel with exceptional drinkability. Very sessionable and very enjoyable."
"This is a classic English Pale Ale. ""Sessionable", refreshing, tasty, well-balanced. Another wonder from a world-class brewery."
"Drinkability: Excellent. I usually find myself wanting another."
"The taste improved as the beer warmed also, rich malts and a bitter crispness give it a fine taste and mouthfeel, a very nice beer."
"Drinkability: Quite good. Good carobnation level for the style, nice flavor balance."
"I guess I'm not as impressed with this ale as many reviewers before me. It poured with a finger of foam and in a great red-brown color, and with a sweet malty smell. The taste was sweet, perhaps too sweet, with lots of bitter and fruity hops. A bit of caramel too. I think the carbonation was decent but it lacked in character compared to, for instance, Timothy Taylors Landlord. Still, it's a fine ale."
"Drinkability: If I could find it as fresh as the sixer I picked up yesterday, I'd drink this beer more often (it is often out of date on the shelves here in southeast Minnesota). I usually keep seven or eight types of beer in the fridge, but this six pack won't last until Christmas. This is definitely a beer to drink."
"Overall this is lightly but deliciously flavoured, producing a superb and satisying everyday-drinking bitter. A definite favourite."
"Pours a nice pale golden color, crystal clear with about 3/4"" inch of tight white head in a tall pils glass. Smell is sweet and fruity with a mellow breadiness. Strawberry, peaches, caramel toast. Great balance. Taste Taste begins with a floral hop flavor and moderate fruitiness, followed by bittersweet caramel notes. Throughout, there's a solid body with just enough carbonation to give it, at the same time, a crisp, light feeling. Aftertaste is toasty and bready for the first few sips, but towards the end of the glass more sour and musty fruit notes are showing up. Oh well, guess I'll have to have a few more."
"The first time I had this beer it was out of a can on a British Airways flight, I remember liking it but it wasnt until I had it on tap again recently that I really got hooked. It poured beautifully with a small fine head that stayed with the beer and had good lacing with a light amber body. The nose was mildy hoppy and the taste was very smooth and creamy. Incredible mouthfeel. This is just as good as their ESB. Don't miss out on this, especially if you find it on tap somewhere."
"Taste is flavorful, and well balanced. Good mix of malty sweetness and some citrus hoppiness. Solid mouthfeel without being sticky. Easy to drink, no one overpowering element. A nice imported example, as are most Fuller's brews."
"Nice mouth feel, some substance without extra heaviness. Very drinkable for the complexity of the body. This beer went incredibly well with baked chicken and mashed potatoes, avoiding heavy spices like excessive rosemary that could clash with this particular style..Enjoy"
"This beer pours a dark amer with minimal head. It has a very good aroma. There are a lot of citrus hints. There is a unique quality to the flavor that I can't pinpoint. It's bitter with some grassy flavor. The body is light and crisp. Overall it's a great beer."
"Very nice, but not all that interesting, especially compared to cheaper domestic craft brews."
"Overall, a great tasty brew, although annoyingly fizzy."
"It's a good ale to be proud of."
"11.2-ounce bottle, best before 22 July 2007. Dim oranged brass with a modest but decent-looking white foam cap. Mild apricot and bergamot tea aromas at first, slight bready malt scent later. Leafy and spicy hop flavors hit the palate up front, dwelling for a long time and introducing apricot essence, warm biscuit, bitter orange, honeydew, and a subdued yet dense butter notes. Feels surprisingly full in the mouth, moderately carbonated but otherwise staid. Somewhat juicy. A very intriguing Pale, familiar yet remarkably hard to pin down. I bet this kills when pulled from a cask."
"Never been a fan of this style, but I""ll try to stay impartial... Into a pint glass, pours a clear amber-copper, with little to no head or lacing. though a little weak, some caramel and a bit bready nose come out. Taste is full of malty goodness, nice English style hops. The mouth goes really well with the beer, well bodied and carbonated and smooth texture. Again, a good beer, easy to drink, not intending to bash it in the least, just not a fan."
"O--Not as impressed as I wanted to be. Read lots of reviews and heard lots of hype, waited to try it for the first time on tap at a pub I could trust and was somewhat let down. Great drinker, and I'll certainly revisit."
"Pours a clear amber the color of a rich Speyside single malt, with little in the way of a head. The smell is a nice balance of malt and hops, caramel malts on one side, earthy, minty hops on the other. I get a hint of diacetyl, too. On the palate, full bodied for the style, with medium carbonation. Easy drinking. Flavorwise, this is mild and sessionable, with light, fruity esters laid on top of sweetish malts, with a finish dried out by subdued English hop notes. Overall a wonderful session beer, easy to imbibe and fun as well."
"Nice looking, slender, old-timey bottle."
"D - Good drinkability. Pretty much a classic EPA. Hard to beat and easy to session."
"The only real drawback to this beer is it doesn't smell very good. Smells like most of the rest of the english ales I've had, a bit skunky. It pours a decent head and the beer is an almost off copper color. Not much lacing down the glass. The taste is quite good of caramel and some grapefruit, maybe? Strong, nice malty background followed by a smooth, light body and some nice hoppy kickback. A pretty decent session brew."
"Drinkability --> This beer is a wonderful example of an English Ale; in fact, it's one of my personal favourites. The caramel maltiness balances wonderfully with the hoppy bitterness. By the time you finish your first glass, you'll be looking for seconds."
"A good and easy drinking, yet intriguing offering overall."
"Wow."
"Poured an orange color with a decent head that did not sustain very long. Nose is maltier than most pales, nothing much else. Taste is maltier as well, finishing with a nice slight apple hop. Mouthfeel is smooth on the palate and medium bodied. Drinkability is very good with a 4.7abv. This is another nice beer from a brewery that it definitely worth a shot."
"The carbonation is low, but there's a nice medium-bodied feel that gives this beer a bit of chewiness. I can imagine drinking several of these on tap at a British pub."
"Taste is bitter and fruity, reminds me of a lot of other English beers I have tried. That typical English yeast.. The right amount of caramalt is in here which perfectly balances the beer and produce a very drinkable beer."
"Pours copper colored with some head, and nice lacing. Smells bready with faint hops and caramel. Even-keeled earthy bitterness up front coupled with some fruit esters, then melds into bready malts with a touch of toffee and hints of diacetyl. Ends very dry, and well bittered through the finish with a lasting impression of bread. Medium bodied with mid to low carbonation and excellent drinkability. Very well balanced and a terrific ale."
"I thank the guy with the british accent who suggested it to me in the store. I think i'll try their ESB next time...."
"Notes: Simply a nice English bitter - and real tasty on cask. I'd definitely recommend seeking it out in that form."
"Mouthfeel is thin and watery. Very little substance here. I'm a big fan of Fuller's, but this is one of their poorer brews, in my opinion. Very average British Pale Ale."
"I can sum up this beer in one word, delicious. I enjoyed everything about drinking this beer. The nose was milder than the taste in my opinion, but everything was outstanding. The finish was uncommonly clean for an ale with such strong flavors. This balance is quite impressive and I will without a doubt seek this beer out again whenever possible. Traditionally, pale ales aren't always my favorites but this stuff rocks!"
"I'm quite impressed with the clean hop notes in this beer and I can only imagine I managed to snag a relatively fresh beer (the label reads ""best before 4/17/2007"" which is quite a ways off...) A near-perfect example of the style and an ale I'll certainly drink again."
"D - It is a very good pale ale. It won't overpower you with hops which is why I think it would be great with a meal."
"Overall - An excellent and very drinkable pale ale.... Recommended..."
"Inviting, bronze color, nice little white head. Smells of biscuit, malty, maybe a little apple, grass... like a mini-ESB, with a little English hop presence. Taste is everything I'd want from an English Pale Ale! Caramel, malt, biscuit, light, dangerously drinkable, and yet interesting enough to keep coming back to. Great mouthfeel, substantial but not too thick. Nice mild hops on the finish to encourage drinkability."
"Pours a clear bright amber color with a medium size almost white head. The head fades down to a small head fairly fast but then hangs in there, This beer leaves a good lacing on the glass. Definite aroma, mostly malt. The taste is predominantly malt as well, incredibly smooth with no unpleasant aftertaste. Mouthfeel is about right for this style of beer - not watery but couldn't be called ""rich"" either. Drinkability is good. Average ABV, pleasant taste and smoothness would make this a good session beer. Overall very nice."
"Fuller's London Pride, a heavily marketed reasonable ale aimed at the masses. Probably a beer that was in its day memorable but now a beer that is close to bland. Certainly better than keg bitters, but equally not worth a special trip for. It's a beer that I will happily drink unless there is something better on the next pump, and sadly for Fullers, there often is."
"This is great stuff."
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle....rich amber color with a slight head, no remarkable appearance. A good beer, but I was expecting a lot more from Fullers considering how much I enjoyed 1845. All and all, okay, and I will drink again, depending on other choices available, but will not seek this one out."
"poured a medium dark amber with a 2 finger head (did i get that right?). Has an above average pale ale taste to it, with a distinct woody/flowery aftertaste that ain't bad. More complex than sierra nevada pale ale, but probably not worth twice or three times as much."
"Worth a try."
"Drinkability: A good brew. Not my favorite of Fuller's, but one of the better English Pale Ales around, though I like it much better on tap."
"I don't normally buy British beers outside of the barleywines, porters, stouts, & impy stouts, because I think the non-roasty/lowly hopped British beers just get brutalized in transit between the brewery and the shelves of California. This beer, though not *bad,* only reinforced that notion. I suppose I shall just have to travel to Britain to taste their beers when young, so fresh and so clean..."
"Fuller's has been a brand I feel like I've heard of but never find, so now that I've found a place that carries a couple varieties, I'm looking forward to getting better acquainted with it, at least until such a time when I can go to England and enjoy it."
"Overall: A darn good and well-balanced pale ale. Recommended."
"D: Very smooth. Easy refreshing beer of its style. Yes, I would have another, and another."
"D- This is a great English Pale Ale with lots of great malt flavors that are very subtle and a nice soft hop finish. This was meant to be a session beer and I can't wait to try it on cask some day."
"Looks superficially like lager, especially in a 500cl Stein. But this brew is a genuine English ale with delightful complex aroma (malts, hops, fruit and citric tones), great fruity taste, dry and firm body and soothing sweet finish. Coming out of huge London brewery it feels an artisanal country-side ale. Very good pale ale, one of the best I ever tried."
"Another winner from Fuller's. I really enjoy the subtle complexity of this EPA."
"Overall another easy to drink offering from Fullers."
"D  Solid beer and very drinkable."
"Mouthfeel- An overal dry but grainy almost oatmeal like mix of flavors coating all the tongue. But especially the back of the tongue."
" Eric"
"D - Very drinkable. I believe this is my first English Pale Ale. Simply an awesome brew. Totally different than a APA, maltier and less hoppy. Highly recommended."
"An OK beer that I'd try again in the UK. But not as good as Fullers ESB."
"My favorite English soccer team--West Ham United, of London's East End--came up painfully short in the FA Cup final Saturday. It was a bitter loss, but also a day that left all Irons/Hammers supporters full of immense pride at their underdog side's brave performance. Hence, it was a perfect day for Fuller's London Pride. This is such a classic example of its style, there really isn't much to say. Its caramel-malty aroma and golden copper-brown appearance are extremely inviting. Again true to style, its flavor and body are perhaps a little on the thin side, but extremely drinkable and balanced, with a straightforward hop bitterness slightly more assertive than the caramel malt background--although the maltiness becomes more noticeable as the beer warms. The only thing really limiting this style-defining beer is being served in a bottle; this refreshing, lightly carbonated, but deceptively flavorful session brew absolutely demands being served traditionally cask-conditioned."
"I am not sure why this is rated the way it is. I find this absolutely boring and plain. It is too watered down and the flavors are very average. There is no reason for me to try this one again, and I hope the rest of the Fuller's beers I bought arent this bad. I'd avoid."
"Cheers!"
"Very clear in appearance and copper in color with a beige head. Smells of hops and malt. Mild in taste with a slight hops finish. What comes to mind is a balanced beer with a decent taste. A bit of an aftertaste but overall a drinkable pale ale. I would add this beer to the list of beers I would probably enjoy more if I had it on draught."
"On my top five."
"D - Easy drinking, but tasty."
"This beer poured a clear, deep amber color with creamy, light tan foam that clinged to the glass and slowly settled. There was a good stream of carbonation bubbles from the bottom of the glass. The smell was nice and malty with a good aroma of English hops. The taste was dryly malty with ""chalky"" hops and a light fruitiness. The beer was well-balanced with mild bitterness overall. The mouthfeel was dry with medium body and good carbonation. The hoppiness and light fruitiness lingered in the finish. This was a great session beer, and even tasted great straight from the bottle."
"Drinkability: Painfully sessionable. This is a good one."
"Mouthfeel is thin and overcarbonated. Drinkability is decent at best. I find myself almost choking this down."
"D: Great appearance and mouthfeel, but the smell and taste leave something to be desired. Overall, this gets a ""meh"" rating from me."
"Taste; slightly bitter and floral hops, bread dough and caramel malts with a bit of a sweet fruitiness in the finish. There's a bit of a buttery quality that makes me knock this down a notch. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, and pretty easy to drink."
"D - high, with a refreshing bitter twang at the end"
"A nice copper/redish color, with an off white head that disappates very quickly. Alot of aromas some citrus and others related to hops, but the prominant scent was one of malt sweetness. The taste was rather surprising, very malty with a smack of bitterness at the end. That bitterness lingers in the mouth long after each sip. In the mouth it is medium bodied, and leaves a nice dry finish in the mouth. Overall I was expecting more hop flavor like american pale ale's, but this beer is smooth and mellow, a nice after work beer to sit down and just relax. It could make a good session or starter beer."
"Poured into a tulip glass, comes out a dark amber color with a 1 inch off-white head that doesn't stick much to the glass, but hung around for most of the tasting. Aroma is slightly sweet, fruity, toasted malts come out the most, with a faint hop aroma. Taste...fantastic! Starts off a little malty, faintly sweet, with hops coming through a bit at the finish. Goes down very easy, dangerously drinkable! A must-try for those who prefer this style."
"A very well balanced, earthy, and highly drinkable ale. I could drink many of these in one sitting with little effort."
"London Pride is an outstanding example of an English pale ale. The aroma is delicate, with nice balance of light floral hop and toasty malt notes. The flavor is extremely well balanced; starting with rich yet not overpowering toasty/toffee malt flavors, followed by a long and dry but not intense hop profile. Low carbonation, the mouthfeel is soft and round. Extremely drinkablevery refreshing, an excellent session beer."
" The drinkability in this beer is quite high, like most Fuller's products I've sampled. An old favorite."
"overall, this beer is aptly named, London should be very proud of this one. a great ale!"
"Typical English Ale appearance. Light copper body holds a thin white head which recedes quickly. Smelled of old growth fruit orchard and loam. Malty and slightly sweet tatse in the front fading to bitter with a suprising amount of hops, but not nearly as bitter as many American pales..as it should be. Highly drinkable."
"A solid beer but not in the ranks of the great. I would drink it again but will not purchase this frequently."
"All in all, a nice ale that is almost too easy to drink... The malt and hop balance are spot on and there was not much carbonation which added nicely to the drinkability...It was at this point that I also adopted my ""try only ales that you had not heard of"" mission. I crossed this venerable star off my list and started focussing on smaller regional breweries... but this is still a good one if you can't find a local..."
"On handpump at an Elephant and Castle. The beer poured a clear copperish color with a thick white head that stuck around for awhile. The aroma is a good balance of sweet and maltiness that is pleasing to the nose. The taste gives you a balance between the malty sweetness and a bit of a foral hop bite. Overall the beer is balanced and easy to drink, especially on the handpump."
"D - My first impression didn't last long. This is definitely an above average beer. I would definitely buy this again."
"Moderate mouth and absolutely sessionable."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, a crystal clear burnished copper w/ two fingers of off-white foamy head, fades quickly to a cap that sticks around, slight lacing. Nose is a clean sweet malt, green apple skins, and flowery hops, light and refreshing. Taste is light and fruity, sweet, slightly buttery malt, slightly tart green apple, melon, flowery hops, moderate bitterness. Medium bodied, moderate carbonation, somewhat slick Overall this is a solid English style IPA, although nothing really sticks out to make it special"
"from the bottle. poured a nice amber with a small light tan head that left some lacing. aroma, weak, caramel, malts, fruity, raisins. flavor, malts, citrus, lighty acidic, smokness finished with a touch of bitterness. not to bad of a beer will get more of this."
"Drinakble, but a shadow of its cask conditioned daddy"
"Poured a clear reddish brown , with an off white head. Smells mainly of grains, bread, slight butter ( some diacetyl) , some hops as well. Taste is grainy , kinda buttery , and has a slight but nice crisp hop finish. Mouthfeel is a little creamy with fair amount of carbonation. Overall a very good English Pale Ale. I tried it after an APA( Anchor> Liberty Ale) and it was nice to notice the differences in the styles of the two countries. I thought this was quite good and would buy it again."
"Fuller's knows what they're doing."
"Regardless of score I seem to end up being uninspired by whatever score is across the board, 3.0, 4.0, and so on. Good for the category, or bad for the beer. This beer is basic, if its the genesis of the Pale Ale category...then it deserves much props. Good beer 3.5 at best."
"D: Very drinkable, quality session brew."
"The beer pours a nice golden color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great! It has a has an awesome malt scent that boasts of pale, carapils, and bisquit malts along with a wonderful noble hop aroma. The taste is good. It has a smooth pale malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes earthy and mildly bitter. It is a bit weak in the malt department, but it has a nice complex taste. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is one of the best English pale ales I've ever tried. It has tremendous aroma and flavor; a fine sessions ale."
"This is a solid pale ale that is light in the mouth and easy to drink."
"If you go to a pub, and they have this on tap, you may have just died and gone to heaven, or you may be in England, but either way, have two or three for me."
"D = Pretty good. Wonder if this stuff can be found on tap?"
"Amber-caramel in colour with medium carbonation. Strong toffee aromas with some fruit in the background. I can recognize the Challenger hops in this one, as I often use them in my homebrewed bitters. Caramel malts dominate the palate, with a clean bittering quality providing some balance. Not really enough hop contribution in the flavor department for my taste, but a a solid bitter nonetheless. I'd probably find this beer cloying after more than one."
"A very drinkable brew, and I will be buying it again -- and more than one bottle at a time next time!"
"Pours a deep coppery-amber with a creamy light beige head that built to about 2 fingers before dissipating slowly and leaving a nice ring around the glass. Good lacing. Smells malty, butter and caramel coming through, with a strong herbal hoppy overtone. Light coffee as well. Malty at first, with strong toffee flavours and a bit of butter. Hops come through well in the finish, light citrus and peppery bitterness. Feels creamy and substantial, with a crisp finish, and is supremely drinkable. An absolutely classic example of a style that is one of my favourites."
"Very faint malty sweetness was overpowered by a light sulfur and hops aroma. Great tasting session brew that was lightly biting with the hops on the front end, but finished smooth and creamy. Appeared widely available, became my best drinkable option while in the bars of the UK."
"Overall: A nice beer. Very good example of the style."
"Bham UK"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Crisp and active in the mouth without being harsh, and certainly food friendly. Sessionable all day long with its low ABV, a nice (but rather expensive) British alternative to my easy-drinking local favorites."
"Drinkability is sky high! Every time I have an English Bitter/Pale Ale/ESB, I want to move to the UK and spend all my days in the pub drinking them from cask. But maybe that's just me..."
"Overall = Respectable brew although I'd seek out other Fuller's before this oen."
"Inoffensive, but not exciting. Suitable for weaning someone off of macros."
"Her taste was very flat! Maybe I got a bad bottle I dont know but the beer was flat, the experience was quite flat. Very malty beer with some notes of butter that came. A floral flavours came from the hops, but in a very very shy manner."
"Ok to drink, not nearly as good as my memories of drinking it on tap. Kind of plain."
"Pours a nice orangey amber with a moderate head of dense, white bubbles. A few strings of carbonation laze their way to the top. The smell is of mild malt sweetness with some spicy hops. Initial hop crispness followed by the toasty malt and some caramel/butter as well. Moderate carbonation peppers the tongue. Well rounded and quite drinkable, a wonderful session beer and fantastic representation of the style."
"A vibrant orange-copper color with egg-shell colored head. Moderate retention and minimal lacing. The smell is of malt and some fruit, but the hops dominate. The taste is interesting in that the bitterness melts into a sweetness that finishes with a touch of sour. As the beer warms, the bitterness gives way to greater sweetness and dryness. The aftertaste is mostly dry with a touch of sour. The drinkability is less than would be expected, because the dry character of the beer makes it less appealing subsequent times, at least for me."
"Pours a beautiful golden-copper color with a thick white head. The aroma is considerably malty (more so than expected). Theres a little hops, a bit of fruit, and a slight diacetyl smell as well. Altogether, the aroma is pretty enticing. The taste is nicely balanced, and a little drier than the aroma would indicate. This is a medium bodied brew with relatively low carbonation. Very good head retention. All in all, I was pretty satisfied. The beer doesnt present much of a wow factor, but it does stand up very nicely as a solidly drinkable pale ale."
"Followed this up with a up with a big beer. Turns out london pride set the stage nicely."
"I have had a few pints of this on tap in London in Dec 2004 and quite enjoyed them."
"d - this is just really strange tasting. i have to try this again some time."
"($8.99 / 6-pack)"
"poured a perfectly clear medium copper color with respectable white head that quickly fell to a moderate ring that left nice lacing on the sides of the glass. Smell is malty, toastly, caramelly, buttery, (and very nice). Taste is a sweet maltiness, toasty with a hop dryness slowing coming through. Finished more dry than malty and very pleasant. A very easy drinking beer. It was finished before I knew it. Good job."
"This is a solid beer and I'd have no problem ordering it at a bar if this were their only English PA and I were in the mood, but for drinking at home, I prefer Sam Smith's Organic Ale. This one is definitely worth a try, though, and the two would make for a good head-to-head tasting."
"This seems to be one of the more pricey English Pale Ales out here but since I'm trying to finish out my list in a local beer club it was worth the shot. Just as good as many Pale Ales, but nothing so exciting to make me want this one over others. Nice hops and great mouthfeel, quite easy to drink. Nothing else too great, but nothing disappointing either."
"Teaser actually said ""If this is what English beer is like, then I'm happy to visit anytime"". I'll hold her to that."
"Drinkability: I can't imagine it getting anymore drinkable."
"Mouthfeel has a medium body with good carbonation and just really easy to drink. I could see this being really great on cask. Another brew I would have no problem sessioning as it goes down so smooth and easy. Well worth your time...and probably worth a trip to the UK as well!"
"Review made from notes."
"On tap at Barleys. Notes of baked goods, oatmeal cookies, and light hops. Copper orange. Poured with no head. Little evidence of carbonation. Bready/biscuity caramel malts. Floral/perfumy hop flavor. At bit on the thin side, watery, with little carbonation. All said, this was a very ordinary beer."
"The grainy maltiness is balanced with the mild hops. The hops are green and impart a very slight bitterness that lingers for a short while. Not very complex by any means, but a pleasant brew."
"Semi copper color with a nice medium tan head. Aroma is of a toasted grain quality followed by a caramel sweetness and then a slightly spicy quality. Taste has more caramel sweetness and toasted bread upfront in that traditional English ale quality. Body is a bit buttery and really smooth. On the light side but it works well for this beer. Hops seem a little fruity at first but finish with a little of that spicy flavor I got from the aroma. Good beer in all. Fuller's can do no wrong imo."
"Tried it on cask before. From the bottle this time. Pours a solid to dark copper with golden and ruby highlights. A full off white head diminishes to a trace and leaves nice lacing. Smells decidedly malty and caramelly with sligh hop spiciness in the background. Maybe a bit buttery. Tastes also malty and caramelly. Sweetness is full and rich up front. Tapers a bit over the toung, leaving hop resins to dominate. English hop flavor adds spiciness and a bit metalic (not from oxidation, but from hop flavor). Body weakens into the finish leaving the beer a suprisingly thin. Slight buttery flavors and slickness are present in the finish and aftertaste. Despite a few flaws, this is a plesant tasting beer."
"Pours an orangish-golden color with a thin white head that dissapates quickly. Aroma is grainy with a background of floral hops. Taste begins with a bready flavor followed by a light caramel sweetness and a lingering floral hops bitterness. Mouthfeel is cream and smooth with moderate carbonation. A very drinkable English Pale, a bit hoppier than expected but still an excellent choice."
"This beer came from the tap a deep copper color, very clear. There was little to no head on the beer, but I blame that on the pour. Ive had this beer before (although not reviewed, and there was no issue. I think it was just the 1st pour for a couple of hours. The nose is all malt with caramel and toffee. It really smells like candy. The taste is fruity apple pear with lots of caramel. There is ieven more toffee in the flavor than I detected in the nose. Slick light mouth feel. Decent drinkability."
"Appearance is translucent amber with beige foam and long lived lace. Aroma has notes of toast, crackers, toffee, brown sugar  and lots of hops. Initial taste is of just-right carbonation, malt, sourdough bread, sweet butter and bitter hops. Finish leaves apricot hops on your tongue. Masterfully crafted!"
"Overall this beer was a let down. I have had great experiences with the other Fuller's products. But this one seemed to be more of an average brew. It is probably better on draft in the UK. I will have to try it there someday."
"Pours a brilliantly clear copper red color and is topped by a frothy cream colored head that starts out a respectable two fingers thick. The aroma is nice; it is a good mix of hoppy, malty and fruity notes. I get aromatic notes of herbs, lemons, cherries, caramel and toffee. The taste is lightly sweet, and quite light on the palate. There is a nice herbal hoppiness to this beer up front and it carries through to the finish. The finish has a pleasing bitterness to it, but also has a bit of citrusy lemon character to it. The taste has notes of toffee, and caramel; this has a really nice maltiness to it that really compliments the hop notes quite well. This is an eminently quaffable beer that is really well balanced between the malt and the hops, though it is balanced towards the hoppy side of the spectrum."
"Drinkability is, as it does. I love this stuff, but because it's not available all over the place, I consider this a ""once in awhile treat"" otherwise I'll be deprived."
"overall- got this on sale for 3.99 a 6pack. the store was overstocked and it was getting close to the best by date. glad i picked this up because its a nice change from what i have been drinking."
"Big, 12 oz. bottle, best by 9/16/05 - served chilled in a nonic. Pours a honey/amber with a beautiful 2 finger off-white head that leaves nice lacing. Lots of diacetyl in the aroma (buttery/butterscotch), with caramel, some hops, and a hint of metal. The flavor is the same with some citric character in the hops and a hint of chocolate in the malts. It has a medium body and a decent amount of carbonation that isn't too tingly and is overall very smooth. The only thing that detracts from this being a session beer is the price."
"Fairly drinkable beer although maybe a little too bitter for my taste."
"Well ! Started out with a nice, clear, amber body with a tan head. Great lacing throughout the glass. Aroma of malts and citrus, taste included these and some lemon. Very low hop kick, but low carbonation made for one you could drink day and night, summer and winter. Not very exciting and somewhat thin, but still tasty enough to go back for another."
"Full, copper-toned body with golden highlights. Thick, dense cap of creamy, off-khaki head. Nose is light sugary biscuit malt, a whiff of toffee, but predominantly slightly resinous, herbally bitter hops. Toasted caramel biscuit malt flavors up front. Nice, even bitterness intrudes with good floral, herbal hop flavor. Nice. Slightly creamy mouthfeel with a minerally finish. Medium bodied. Probably better on cask, but not bad on nitro."
"-Oelergud"
"The mouthfeel is good but very plain and simple. This beer is smooth and extremely mild and drinkable --the only negative is that due to the flatness (lack of carbonation), I could see growing tired of it after a couple/few."
"Clear copper color, 1/3"" of off-white head. Pretty standard stuff for an EPA. Smell is carmely and light floral hops, some diacetyl. Taste is well hopped, grapefruit in nature, starts sweet and ends. Could be more carbonated, but ok. Seems underpowered compared to the hoppier and more flavorful APA's, but for an EPA, not bad"
" Medium light mouth feel and warm, bitter finish makes this an outstanding beer to drink all night and / or offer to a Sam Adams or Bass drinker for a step up."
"Overall: A nice ale and well recommended."
"Pleasing and drinkable. One of the standard-bearers of English pale ale."
"A nice upgrade over the last beer I reviewed. Poured a very nice amber color. Very clear. Only a slight head and stringy lace. Nose is bready, malty and fruity (apples and apricots). Taste is very simple but very full. Lots of sweet malts but balanced with nice subtle hops. A nice slight bready feel was on the tongue. Other than the perfect balance, there is not much more to the flavor. The mouthfeel is very full, the malts just coat the inside of tghe cheeks. Ver smooth drinking and quite pleasant finish."
"Incredibly drinkable. Incredibly balanced. I will be having this again sometime."
"Mouthfeel is light, carbonation is ample, and it is very thirst quenching and suitable for a session brew."
"Very drinkable, even for hot weather."
"Copper color with reddish tints pours with a thin head. The head doesn't hang around for long. Very low carbonation, once the head is gone, there's little sign of activity in this beer. Smell is malty, bready, fairly light. Taste is mostly the malt backbone with some very subtle hoppiness. I expected more out of this brew, it just seemed rather bland and unexciting to me. The minimal carbonation almost makes it seem as though it's flat. But despite those concerns, it's a decent brew and obviously well crafted."
"Bright, very bright orange, decent cap-sized head. Buttery, sweet malts and some chestnuts (roasted) on the nose. Sharp and bitter hops, coupled with a decent blast of fresh bread tastiness; medium bodied all the way, becomes increasingly dry, ultra-smooth and clean palate. Diacetyl noticeable along with some tender caramel malts; just a tinge of carbonation. Lush and enjoyable; the true standard/classic English pale ale. Cheers!"
"This was a very drinkable ale even in the cans..wpould love to taste this on draught."
"The mouthfeel is a little on the thin side, but the low carbonation makes this a wonderful and flavorful session ale."
"I thought this was just fantastic. It poured a copper-like colour with a snow white head that subsided to a sticky lace ring in just few seconds. The lace clings nicely to the sides of the glass. The smell is just delicious. It takes something special for me to hand out a 5.0. The smell is full of malt with a noticeable amount of hops. There is quite a noticeable caramel smell as well. It's just so well balanced. Not too much or too little of anything. A masterpiece. The taste is quite lovely as well with a robust maltiness in the beginning with a pleasantly bitter hoppy finish. The mouth feel is so smooth and almost buttery. This is also very drinkable. A great session brew, or one to simply sip on and savour. Absolutely smashing!!"
"Clear, deep orange and perhaps tobacco tinged brew. A quick white head, but plenty of carbonation. A malty nose, a bit grassy, lots of hops, and then a crisp taste of malt, fruity and buttery, nicely balanced bitter hops finish. Love this beer. Delicious, nice body, very drinkable. A favorite pale ale."
"Bottle dated best before 19 Jan 2005. I'm a little late. Pours a light copper with a soapy light tan head. Poor retention and scant lacing. Low carbonation consistent with an English ale. Butterscotchy, toasty malt aroma with a hint of Kent Goldings hops nearer the end of the whiff. Assertive malty and buttery diacetyl taste with a slightly hoppy, drier finish. Trace vegetal notes. Lighter bodied, very drinkable and carbonation level is just right. A very nice English pale ale that is a benchmark of the style. This would have to be great on cask."
"Beautiful copper color with an ample white head. Herbal aroma, malt dominates with butterscotch/toffee flavors. Hops stay quiet in in the back but still provide decent balance. Very drinkable smooth ale. Nothing terribly complex, rather straight forward but the overall effect is very good."
"The taste was one of the best parts of the beer, as it should be. It starts off with sweet malts and finishes dry with a generous aftertaste of british hops. The body is light to medium. This would make an excellent session beer. I can't wait to have it on tap soon at my local watering hole."
"Reflection: This is a very good ale but I can think of quite a few local breweries that I would rather buy from that make ales of this caliber."
"Drinkability: This is a very nice session-type English Paler Ale. To be honest, I havent had a lot of the English varieties (a few), but to me, this one is very good."
"The taste is very nice, bringing loads of smooth and rich malts through without being overpowering. Something about the smell seemed funny but that wasn't bad either. The mouthfeel holds the richness and smoothness of the taste."
"Pours with a ton of carbonation, making for a big fluffy white head. Not much in in the way of aroma. A hoppy, spicy beer, and surprisingly clean tasting for an English ale. Pours as clear as most pilsners -- where's the yeast? (This is obviously not a bottle-conditioned ale.) Almost reminds of a little bit of the last Pilsner Urquell I had -- but his is supposed to be an ale, right? A good beer, but lacking some of the traits of other English beers from other breweries I Iike -- Young's or Adnam's, for example -- the mouthfeel, body and fruitiness contributed by the yeast. A bit of a dispointment in terms of the style but is good for impersonating a nice spicy pilsner."
"Simply a classic English pale ale. I love the big muted hop notes. It reminds me of sitting in an English pub. Even better if you can find it on cask. I could drink this beer all day long."
"great beer in the cask. far better than the bottled version, as the bitterness is much more rounded out. the beer poured off with little head (maybe 1/4""), but it lasted most the way to the bottom. nice copper/orangey color, a bit hazy. smell was great. creamy malt aromas and nice floral hops on the nose. the taste, though, was awesome. again, creamy malt texture, biscuit/cookielike flavors, finishing with delicate hops. nice malt finish too. i could drink this beer all night long (and i did, that one night...)."
"Hot damn. We have cask ale in Lexington! This beer came off the firkin a golden amber color with just a coat of head over top of the beer. The nose was sweet caramel with deep grainey tones, but not bad. I like it. The flavor was good caramel sweetness with a nice background of sweet grain that finished with a really nice hop bitter. The feel was silkey smooth and creamy, and just a nice drink. My only problem is that the beer was served way too cold for a cask ale, but letting it sit took care of that. Still highly drinkable and awesome."
"A very nice and easily-drunk beer. Very well balanced."
"A good beer, my first from Fuller's. I'm not this style's biggest fan, but this beer would not be avoided."
"A very good session ale, fullers have again impressed me, on cask its even more drinkable as the carbonation isnt as aggressive"
"Drinkability: the easiest drinking ale I've tried. If you're drinking APA's, you need to try this to see how the ""mellower"" half lives"
"Had this on cask at the local pub. Cool hand pump. Pours a copper color with a very small head and doesn't leave much lacing on the glass - didn't expect the cask version to have much head. The aroma is sweet and malty; caramel and biscuit malts. The flavor was very smooth and enjoyable. Has a caramel flavor with nice hop presence. Very nice on cask. I recommend it."
"Pours a nice amber color and has a thin white head that leaves decent lace. There is very little hops in the nose, but the bready malty aroma is inviting. I have never had a English pale ale before, so this was a total surprise to me. The subdued hoppiness and strong malty character is vastly different from the American interpretation. This is a very drinkable brew that is surely going to grow on me the more I drink it."
"Pale copper to amber color with large bubbles of carbonation. The head head is made up of those same large bubbles in an off-white color. The aroma is sweet and malty with a fruity apple cider like smell. The taste is a bit sour and sweet with bready malt flavors and some weak hop bitterness at the end. It's a reasonable beer to drink, but nothing particularly special."
"Excellent drinkability, ideal as a session ale, and the prototypical English Pale Ale."
"Drinkability: A dependable English PA...best paired with an order of Fish-n-Chips."
"500ml bottle: poured a decent copper-gold with a smallish tight cap. moderate carbonation...aromas of spice, apples some pine. prickly mouth feel from over carbonation for the style (IMHO)...Hop pronounced.... malts take a back seat but deliver a distinct sweet biscuit taste that is not overpowered by the well balanced pine, woody hops. A smooth and mildish character in a standard for the style."
"Mid gold with a thick head this beer belies a malty nose that suggests old breweries and tradition. The taste is flowery, malty with subtle hops with the clincher coming with a great finish. The great English Ales are very complex in ways that only contemplation can produce. A true classic."
"Pride poured a light amber colour with an off-white thick head that is quite long lasting. Very tiny bubbles slowly rise from the bottom of the glass. The aroma is mild and hard to detect. The beer could be more aromatic - a malty smell is all I can get. A very nice rich taste - a smooth malty caramel or some kind of sweets. A taste of toffee or nuts lingers at the end. This is a great ale, smooth not really bitter and quite drinkable too. This beer is made for sucking back pints at a pub."
"Overall, if you're looking for a solid English Ale, this is your beer. Good character and great English toffee taste."
"Granting myself the last word, Fuller's seems like a top-notch outfit. I can think of no reason not to consider them for Best British Brewery and an automatic contender for Best World Brewery."
"Sticky, doughy, cream-colored (almost white) head on top of a clear, pure amber beer. Nose is a gorgeous toffee caramel, chewy delight. Buttery, bready, caramely up front. A dark, rich, buttery caramel, smooth middle. Finish is tangy, hoppy bitter and nutty too. Yes! This is just a fabulous English ale."
"Picked up on my latest beer run. 12 oz bottle with a best before date of 12/apr/04 (about 5 months past its prime). Appearance is copper with a small white head which initially consisted of large bubbles. Aroma has very pronounced bread-like qualities, a lot of malt in this pale i guess. A little bit of nut aroma slips through as well. Taste backs up the aroma well. A very strong malt body is the dominating force in this beer. The nut flavor is present as well. Pretty well balanced if you are a malt lover. Mouthfeel is nice. This could be a great session beer, but I seem to prefer my pale ale's to have more floral qualities. I guess English Pale Ale is not my style, but I'm definately glad I sampled at least 1."
"Old fashioned candy flavor at first and then a sweet malty finish. Very drinkable English Pale Ale. Excellent balance with just enough of a hop presence. Tasty session beer."
"736"
"Overall- A perfect beer!!!"
"A great session beer. One of my favourite english pale ales."
"A very strong example of the traditional English Ale, albeit close to an ESB in flavor with the extra touch of hops."
"Bottle: Poured a light brown colored beer with a medium head and standard retention. Aroma is quite malty and the same applies to the taste. Well balance bitterness at the end. This is another standard English ale in bottle which Im starting to think taste all the same. Im wondering if those beers should only be drink form a cask to truly appreciate them. Overall, this is not bad, nor good, just standard."
"Crystal clear coppery colour. Long-lasting white head. Fresh hop aroma with light grain and some toasted. Crisp carbonation to start with a very smooth texture that follows. Hop bitterness is more dominant in the bottle than when on-tap, and malt/fruit flavours are more mild. A mild bitterness lingers on the palate."
"PS: It's great that the Fullers stock at Shangy's is always super fresh! It's not as good as cask, but it's the next best thing!"
"On cask it's light and understaed but flavorful and my review score is based on that Sessionable and melts in the mouth. .Bottle More bitter hops but also more caramel toffee biscuit malt sweetness noticeable in the bottle than the tap I have previously tried. Very drinkable and on light/medium fulness side."
"pours out a perfect amber colour with a thick luscious off white head. bready, toasty aroma...with just enough floral english hopping to balance. plentiful lacing. flavours of fresh bread dough and toasted crackers....some light caramel and toffee notes come through. hopping for flavour with little bitterness. balanced all around. the body is relatively light, with a mouthfeel that's rounded and crisp. finishes dry and wanting another sip. pleasant malty aftertaste. high drinkability because of the lower ABV and lessened flavour profile. a perfect session ale. would be a perfect compliment to some pub grub."
"As a gold standard for 'across the pond' pale ales, Fuller's London Pride is solid in all respects. Though, again, I prefer the American version of the style, this beer's relatively restrained use of hops allows it to be consumed in quantity without risking palate fatigue. I'm glad that it's available less than 5 minutes from my house for those (admittedly rare) cases when I don't have a U.S. hop crave goin' on."
"Ooooh, am I ever glad Craig brought me this. I've been searching at home for this, and he found it while working in Ottawa. I gotta give him a reward for this. Nice, amber red with subtle hues of orange. Big, fluffy head that disipates slowly to nothing. But by then, the glass is almost empty. Lace coats the glass like a curtain. Beautiful. Extremely well balanced smell of malt and hops. Even a bit of a yeast strain smell. I like it, alot. Taste starts out crisp and mellow, then this full flavoured malt profile kicks in like kung fu. Nice, I like it. Leaves pleasantly bitter. Mouthfeel is definitely a full bodied beer. Not a heavy body, but full. Sinfully drinkable. I'd drive all the way to Ottawa to get a couple bottles of this bliss."
"A very nice looking amber pour with a smallish off-white head. The nose is malty sweet with subtle fruity hints. Taste wise, it's light fruitiness up front that quickly turns to a malty body down the middle. Medium bodied with a smooth & fizzy mouthfeel. The finish is dryish with a metallic sorta zip to it. Nice light hoppiness. An average beer in my books."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Just had this one again on draught at St, Andrews in NYC last week. While I have always enjoyed this beer from the bottle, you must have it on draught to truly enjoy it. St. Andrews also keeps it at the proper temperature so that the true flavour abounds. The mouthfeel was particularly wonderful, and taste is always good. Well, I'll be going back to the bottle version, as I don't get the draught up here in NW Connecticut. One of my favourite session beers--full stop!"
"This hit the spot. I would have had a few more if they weren't five bucks per can."
"Poured out a rusty copper color with a nice amount of carbonation in there that leaves a lacing around the glass. Smell was a little light. It was mostly malts blended in with some hops (very light though), some caramel and a light floral aroma. Taste is quite good. Malts hit the palate big time and lasts through the aftertaste. In between some caramel and sweetness flavors blend in to balance this brew out. The carbonation in this beer was almost perfect I thought. It let the flavors show their punch. Perhaps on the best session beers out there."
"A tawny gold with white foam scudding over the top. Faint toffee scent. A touch of bitterness bites into the appley malt, which seems covered with butterscotch, with more butterscotch in the finish. Served too cold again as well. sigh."
"Found this one in the singles cooler at Whole Foods. Pours a deep copper color with a light foamy head. Nice aroma of roasted malt, biscuit, and a light fruitiness. Beautiful palate of sweet malt, very light hops, and a hint of brown sugar. Wonderful creamy mouthfeel allows the maltiness to linger on the palate. A great beer, to say the least."
"Easily one of the most drinkable beers I've ever had. This one poured a nice dark copper color with a very big frothy white head that coated the whole glass with lace. The smell was pretty light with a slight hoppiness and a very bready scent as well. The taste was super balanced with a very light hoppiness, medum malt presence and a great earthy taste that I couldn't put my finger on. The mouthfeel was so light and airy off the cask it was great. A true session beer indeed."
"A benchmark bitter. It pours a bright orange color with a generous and long lasting rocky head. Half the head must stay behind on the glass, the lacing is copious. The smell is citrusy, perhaps grapefruit, piney and, possibly, ginger? The taste is refreshing, with cedary hop notes and a solid malt background. The bitterness and sweetness is very balanced. The carbonation is generous with medium sized bubbles that make for an active mouthfeel. This beer is an excellent session beer. Fuller's is one the best English breweries for sure."
"Drinkability: This one goes down quite easily, and you can have quite a few before you start feeling the alcohol. A good session beer or a dinner quaff. Now, if only the barmaid had brought a proper pour from the keg..."
"A great brew and one that I will return to often."
"All considered, this is a very well made effort. It is restrained, yet complex and interesting. I will definitely have another."
"very good colour, a nice copper. head is a dense off white but only about 3/4"" thick. smell is clean with a very good smelling mild hops. at first taste i was a bit surprised the the hops did not stand out as much. a nice smooth malt flavour. it is very well balanced and very, very drinkable. a very good beer, that lots of different people could enjoy. this beer should be a world standard for good, drinkable beer."
"Light to medium feel, light bitterness. Great session beer drinkability. Just a great pale ale, may be underrated due to expectations based on American pales. What doesn't this brewery do right?"
"You need to try this one. I'd like to make this my every day beer."
"Pours a copper color clear liquid with a foamy white head that disappeared fairly quickly. Smells slightly skunky, woodsy and earthy. Not really a great smell. Taste is much more pleasant. Not much malt sweetness, but more of a toasted flavor, with a very dry hop bitterness. Not much hop bitterness. Good mouthfeel, not too thin at all. This seems to be a very drinkable beer. A good example of an English Pale Ale."
"The nose is a bit malty -- hints of white toast with honey. Hoppiness alludes to grapefruit, but it's thin. But man, what an incredibly balanced, beautiful, simple flavor. Simple pale malts -- melba snacks and homemade biscuits with a crunch --mingle with the most pleasant estery middle and a great leafy, herbal hop finish. Simple but excellent. And oh-so-light. Beer bliss."
"Overall I found this to be a very well balanced session brew. Not a huge fan of British ales, but this one really did it for me."
"This is a good brew...but my tastebuds have been indoctrinated by hops-laden American PAs and this one just seems weak in comparison. It pours a light amber with a scant white head. Lots of caramel malt in the nose with some spicy hops in the background. Fuller's signature buttery burnt caramel flavor dominates the flavor, though it is more subdued than in the ESB. Spicy and slightly herbal hops provide nice balance but never dominate the flavor. A malty PA by American standards. A malt lover's beginner Pale Ale."
"The taste is very nice, highly malted, sweet and mild. There are nice floral hops that help to clean the taste up toward the end. Some caramel tastes add a pleasant taste as well. Very nice beer, one that youd not have a hard time drinking all evening."
"Awesome beer all around. I love this beer on tap and in the bottle. Need to taste a few more times to discern the difference."
" I'll definitely pick up more of these the next time I go to the beer store."
"Pours a clear amber color with a creamy off-white head. Wispy lace is left behind on the sides of the glass. Aroma is mostly of bread and grain with some caramel and hops in the backround. Not overpowering but very inviting. Very smooth with flavors of toasted bread and caarmel upfront. Hops play in the back to make sure this stays balanced, and it does. Medium bodied and highly drinkable."
"Wyll-"
"You know when something just feels so right? This is definitely it! I could go on and on. Let's just say, 'World Classic'."
"Very drinkable."
"12 ounce bottle. Best before date on back label of 17/Aug/04"
"Very drinkable. A perfect session beer. Wish I could find this on tap."
"This review will be updated when I get back to a fresher bottle."
"Remember, What Ever You Do  Take Pride!"
"Thx"
"The mouthfeel is clean and crisp, and it's easy drinking. This is a nice, decent, drinkable pale ale."
"$2.99 for the pint bottle."
"On buying this I was expecting something along the lines of the easy quaffing and similarly priced bombardier bitter but it is something else entirely. Pours a glorious reddish gold colour with a very slight head. The taste is complex but likeable and builds up to a sharp finish with a really nice aftertaste. Overall am very impressed, is a beer which is tasty as well as interesting and would reward further exploration (if it didn't cost so much!)."
"One of my favourite UK pale ales."
"I'm not sure if there are better pale ales, but if you like the pale ale/bitter style you need to try this."
"Notes: I'm still an American IPA lover, but this is one great beer."
"A very presentable, interesting, yeasty, and drinkable ale."
"Bottom Line: Quite nice, but simple for a British bitter / pale ale."
"Appearance: Caramel amber tone with a decent sized cream hued head after each slip needs a fluffy layer of lacing in rings around my pint. Aroma: Slightly nutty with a pine scented hop aroma sweet caramel malts used here as a well simple but solid and plentiful scent. Taste: A fresh bottle of this should be everyone's introduction to English style pale ales very tasty brew, buttery sweet snappy bite of hops there but the mixture of the two is downright excellent I love the flavor another one of those to hunt for on cask. Mouthfeel: Rich slightly residual sticky texture in a good way, medium-light in body crisp carbonation smooth session ale. Drinkability: Perfect balance makes this beer an all around any time good beer, really enjoyed my tasting with London Pride Outstanding Pale Ale awesome English pale ale, could definitely handle a six pack happily."
"Another fantastic beer from Fullers."
"The definition of session. This is choice stuff."
"and LOTS more sweet malt character in the flavor. Is there such thing as a malt monster? This is so far from Geary's Pale that it's akin to being another planet's pale ale. A Gordon Bierschlike sweetness tempered by pert small-bubbled carbonation, and only a swipe of hops. Bitterness is mostly in finish and aftertaste. Mouth is very round and full. I love the smell more than the taste. London Pride is a great example of why nose should be part of every beer's enjoyment."
"Now I know why this brewery has been around for so long.I have to agree with vitesse and say that this is probably the most balanced beer I have ever had. A crystal clear amber, tawny color. The only bad part was the head disappeared too quickly for me. But, certainly the taste, aroma made up for that. If you find this do yourself a favor and buy a case and keep it soley for yourself. A true English ale that won't disappoint."
"very drinkable. moderate abv and a great beer that suits any season. highly recommended."
"The beer poured an amberish color, topped by a 1 inch head, which disappeared quickly, a very soft aroma with just a hint of malt. The taste was also soft,with just a hint of malt.Tried and triend but couldn't detect the carmelly ""Sugar Daddy"" taste this was supposed to have. Its OK but couldn't find a reason to recommend it"
"The beer pours a amber color, with a small white head. The head disappated quickly, and there was no lacing. There was a medium nose of hops and malts. Taste had some hints of caramel to it. Fairly good presence of hops and malts to the taste. Definite malt finish. A little hoppier in the finish. Very close to the cask version, but just a hair less smooth. Overall, Pretty good!"
"Rocky white head takes its time before leaving the party with a nice sticky lace following behind. Beautiful clear copper color and a nice lively carbonation. Aroma is of a little sweet, grainy malt with a good english hop aroma and a little yeast. Taste is excellent with a slight roasty character in the front followed by a strong malt background that is matched perfectly with a flavor of english hops and a light hop bitterness in the finish. Body is in the medium range and is perfect for this beer. This beer relaxes me just by taste alone, after a long day a london pride is a welcome sight. Excellent english pale ale though it is hardly pale."
"Pours a nice head that is resilient (but diminishes quickly), and has a sticky lace. A copper color and a lively amount of CO2. Smell is like cider with some yeast and hops thrown in. Taste is smooth with a slight bite and some sweetness in the background. The mouth feel is smooth, yet also crisp. This beer has an exceptional balance of flavors for a pale ale. Quite drinkable."
"Another proper pint and another textbook beer with the bar set way up!"
"a little subdued, but relatively solid english pale."
"Clear amber in color with a decent head. Bouquet is yeasty and grainy with a touch of hops. I also picked up some fruit. Medium-bodied and quite smooth. Fairly malty in taste with the tiniest bit of fruit. Ends slightly hoppy. All around a pretty good brew. Probably one of the better pale ales I've had, but by no means the top of the Fuller's line."
"Golden brown color, medium head. Aroma is malty and slightly sweet. Nice malts, somewhat hoppy. Full flavor. Nice body. Mouthfeel is malty and round. Good hop/malt balance. Smooth. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is malty and bitter. Nice example of an English style Pale Ale"
"Overall, a solid pale ale, but nothing exciting IMHO."
"If I never had ESB, maybe I would be more impressed with this beer. Certainly a good all around pale ale, and I know it's not really fair to compare it to a beer of a different style. Even in the category of pale ales, I've had better. It's just too thin and bland for the style. I admire subtlety, but this may be a bit too subtle. Looks and smells nice, tastes good, goes down easy. I followed it with an ESB, and the difference is huge. For the same money, I'll take the ESB every time."
"Overall Impression: I like this one. I passed it over in the coolers many times opting for an old friend in Bass Ale but I haven't neglected the Pride of London ever since trying it. A good try for the hopheads. Its not as bitter as an IPA but the hoppy fragrance instigates the ol' taste buds to get ready."
"The beer is an enchanting golden yellow. Not very much head. I think it disappeared before I could see it. Bitter and buttery aroma. Rather nice. Buttery and bitter taste as well. Feels nice, too. It's a good beer... I'll enjoy this and would like another sometime. But there's not enough complexity/difference to set this one apart."
"When this beer was poured, it had a tan head with small-medium bubbles. This beer has a sweet and fruity aroma reminding me of apples. It has a nice hoppy flavor to it. I found this beer to be a smooth beer that is very drinkable and one that I truly enjoyed drinking and rating."
"Now this is how it's done, the ""Outstanding"" on the label is well earned. Came in a sturdy brown 500ml bottle, with the freshness date stamped on the back label. Pours out a beautiful coppery tone, it damn near made me weep. Not much head, but it rings the glass and leaves a small amount of lacing. Nose is rich, buttery bread, sweet malt and caramel, a bit of toffee, and a faint hint of mild hops. Flavour is smooth and well blended, buttery toffee taste, toasted malt, and nice compliment of hops towards the end. It goes down like liquid heaven. This would make an amazing sessional, a pity I only have the one bottle. This is an ale to be proud of indeed."
"This brew has a mild malty aroma. When poured, yields a light brown lively head full of medium to small bubbles. Its body is a nice clear dark transparent copper color. It had a very nice light malty taste with a hint of carbonation. Very smooth and well rounded flavor."
"After finishing a bottle of Fullers ESB, I decided to try the pale. The characteristics of this ale are similar to the ESB but not as intense. Appearnce is similar, clear amber with a head slightly less than the ESB but yielding better retention. Aroma is hoppy and sweet but not overpowering. Palate is lighter and flavor also lighter. This is an ESB light in my opinion and not outstanding as it's label states. Session beer? Hmmm, I think the ESB would make a better session beer, and I know this from spending hours throwing darts and throwing down hand pulled pints at Churchills Olde English Tavern."
"Also had an unassumingly long finish, as it quietly came back to remind me with soft dryness and lemon flavor. Great mouthfeel, watery with a just right amount of body and texture to it. Very easy to drink, this beer is totally a session styled pale, as Brits would do, in contrast with American strong bittered versions."
"pat"
"A nice dark amber color ale with a lacy cream colored head on top. The smell is quite malty, which would lead one to believe that it would taste that way as well. Lots of nice malt flavors backed by a slight bite of hops. Some buttery flavors in there as well. If this is only 4.7%, its a shame that its not cheap enough to be sold in cases, cause this would be a great session beer. If youre in the mood for a great english pale ale, this could be calling your name."
"Had this beer in a tall, thin bottle poured into a Fuller's nonick pint glass. The pour left a very large head for an average English Pale, about 2.5-3 fingers worth. The color was dark gold. There was a little bit of lacing left down the side of the glass. Taste is only slightly hoppy, and very smooth. The mouthfeel is a little soft, but not bad. This is a very light pale with a fantastic long finish, which I love. Also very drinkable, so have a few!"
"This exists solidly between their ESB and IPA. And that's OK."
"Quite carbonated with the bottle erupting when the top came off. Poured a nice copper-orange in color with a thick white head. Fruity hops and biscuits came across in the aroma profile. Grainy, biscuity flavors were percieved along with a noticeable diacetyl flavor. Hints of caramel came and went. Moderate hop bitterness lingered on the tongue but did not overpower the malt profile. Quite nice indeed."
"An exceptional ale in every respect. The glass revealed a crystal clear amber brew with a rather thin ivory head. Relatively light lacing from the too brief head. Nose of malt and hops. Delicate flavor of malts and decent hopping to create a very straightfoward and enjoyable beer. Hints of caramel and bread come through in the taste as well. A nice body sense with a buttery mouthfeel complete the presentation. Highly recommended."
"Bottom Line: A quintessential British mild ale, perfect for quaffing."
"Poured a clear amber in color with an off-white head that retreated to the side of the glass. Floral hops and malt nose. Mouthfeel is thin and crisp. Flavors consists of caramel, sweet malt and hops. The hop bitterness provides a good balance to the malt sweetness and takes over in the finish. Definitely a solid pale ale."
"Color is a glowing amber with a small tannish head about a finger high and has good frothyness. Smell is floral hops with a honeynut malt background. Taste is very crisp, sharp, and clean with big time fresh,bittering floral hops and has a caramel-nutty malt balanced in. The feel is very light and somewhat lightly silky/oily -not what I was expecting, but fits the style. This beer is made for drinkin, and drinkin alot. Goes down easy with a well balanced bitter bite and smooth malt backing."
"I was expecting a little bit more from this one. It was a good pale ale, but it didnt knock me over. Pours a dark copper color with a light, bubbly head. Minimal lacing was left. Aromas were of floral hops and mild citrus peel. The taste packed a big punch of floral hops and malted barley. There was a slightly bitter and astringent taste left in my mouth. All-in-all is was a nicely balanced pale ale. Given the opportunity I would drink this one again."
"It's a light copper color, very clear also. A medium head forms and has a short duration, the only reason I didn't give all 5's. A slight film is all I had for most of the glass and no lacing. Mellow and calming effects please the nasal passages with sweet malts and just a smidgeon of happy hops. I am stunned at how smooth and drinkable this beer is. Every sip becomes larger and larger as I try to have as much of this luscious fluid touch my tastebuds. There is no ""biting"" hops bitterness. A more mellow hop character is preceded by a lightly carbonated and very wonderful maltiness. I am most definitely a big fan of Fuller's now, after loving the London Porter and 1845, and now this pale ale that is well worthy the London Pride moniker.....my favorite beer out of England so far."
"Was not impressed ar first, but it quicky improved.."
"Overall Impression: Great beer. There's a reason this is a hallmark of the style."
"I've had too many English style pale ales that have rancid or harsh buttery notes, but this is smooth and has more of a mead/butterscotch flavor which is very enjoyable. A wonderful session beer. A sublime textbook balancing act...this beer doesn't rely on brawn and gusto to impress...the best English Pale Ale I've had. Well done! I'll be buying this again."
"This was a nicely balanced pale ale. However, it was just too mild overall. It wasn't bland, but it wasn't exciting either."
"Pours a moderately hazy dark golden amber color that resembles a browning peach. Topped off with a nice cake of beige foam that reduces quickly to a thin film. Complex nose is characterized by caramely malts with a whiff of hops. Taste reminds me of a Scotch ale, with a sweet, syrupy finish that fades into a more bitter, dry aftertaste. Relatively crisp and even a bit watery at the front. More clingy than crisp and clean, this nonetheless has a nice mouthfeel and is more than adequately drinkable."
"Hand-pulled and boy what a difference it makes. This blows any other Fullers beer I've tried out of the water. Tons of flavor, creamy, nutty; a huge beer flavor-wise, but remains incredibly easy to drink. Head leaves perfect rings down the glass, and the beer massages the inside of my throat on the way down. Generous malt presence; initially sweet up front, but said sweetness makes ample room for assertive hops and a perfectly dry finish. The aftertaste toys with me, teasing, beckoning me to partake in more. I happily obey. It's an experience like this that makes beers like Bass and Boddington's seem especially dull. The bartender told me that most customers don't like the cask-conditioned beers and instead opt for Heineken, Corona, Amstel Light. Idiots. More for me, I guess."
"Pours a nice copper with nearly white head. Aroma hints at a bit more hop with a slightly floral character. Little hop flavor, this beer relies on malts to get the job done. Slightly sweet, the predominant flavor is biscuity malt with a healthy dose of buttery diacytel Low ABV means you can put away quite a few of these which is a good thing (the put away a few, not the low ABV...I prefer a bit more bite). Flavor picked up quite a bit as it warmed."
"A bright, clear copper/amber body is topped by a large frothy, foamy white head, which leaves behind an outstanding lace. Nose is dominated by herbal and floral hops, with a whiff of fine British sulfur. Taste is caramel and butterscotch, with a subtle but definite hop presence balancing the sweetness in fine fashion. Mouthfeel is round and full. A fine ale to while away the hours in the pub. Calling your beer ""outstanding"" on the label might be immodest, but all of London should have pride in this brew."
"Pale orange/amber color, crystal clear, with a sudsy white head that stays well. Floral, slightly spicy, and oily English hops in the nose, along with toasted/grainy malt. Very pleasing taste, not too overwhelming, but definitely not lacking in flavor or body. English hop bitterness and toasted/bready/grainy malt are matched perfectly to create what is probably the finest example of an English pale ale you can find. At the very front, sweet malt makes up most of the flavor profile, but in the middle, the hops really take hold. The finish is more of a balance between the two. Leafy hop character in the aftertaste. A must-try! As I was saying, the best English pale ale I've ever tasted."
"Quite a high level of carbination which keeps the head perky throughout the tasting. Pours with a big, rocky head before dispating with considerable lacing -- something that is consistent around the glass and makes the collar pop up consistently about 1/2"" above the top of the beer itself."
"Light copper in color with a very thin head. Aroma of pale malt, a bit caramely, with a very slight fruity aroma from the hops. Hops are mostly floral and understated. Flavor is crisp, dominated by clean malt and mild hop bitterness throughout. Medium-bodied and very smooth drinking. Fullers makes a lot of great session beers, but this is probably the most drinkable, though least distinctive, of them all."
"it was a great drinker, and i could easily see many of these floating around at a gathering. good work by Fuller's"
"Bronze in color with a off-white head that leaves a bit of lace-work down the glass. Has a spicy, floral hop aroma. Balanced flavor of a sort of toasty/nutty malt, and also the spicy hops. It finishes dry with a bit of bitterness. It is relatively lightly carbonated, and a light-medium bodied beer. It is a very easy drinking Pale Ale; smooth and clean."
"Pours a light copper color with a nice creamy head that leaves a nice lace behind. This is one of the best pale ales I have ever had. The pale malt with hop bitterness is the perfect combination. A very nice clean finish is the perfect ending to a perfect Pale Ale."
""
"Very competent Pale Ale. Pours a nice amber color with a medium off-white head. Distinctly bitter hops aroma. Biting hops flavor with little malt to counteract, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. It did seem slightly unbalanced though. I'd like to try this on draught some day. Overall though this is another winner from Fuller's."
"Read all the hype, had to try the beer. I liked the bottle, both the shape and the label. Poured a nice amber color. The taste, to me, was rather flat. It tasted like a good ale, but not spectacular. Perhaps on tap it would be better. Would drink it again, but it is a little too pricey."
"Pours a nice bright copper color with a creamy tan head that slowly sinks.  Nicely bitter hop aroma with enough malty sweetness to balance things out.  Smooth with a nice malty start to it.  Light diacetyl from start to middle and then in the finish lightly.  Quite a nice bitter hop finish, especially for the style.  Much more bitter that I expected.  Nice lingering bitter finish makes this brew much crisper than I was expecting and a nicely drinkable brew with its medium body.  This would make a rather nice drink in the summer time and I wish that I had discovered it then."
"Nice clear golden amber color was the highlight of this beer. Everything after that was down hill. The smell was not much to brag about and the taste was just of another average pale ale. Nothing exceptional with this beer. Slight bitterness in the end and smooth. No nothing flavor!"
"A clear deep amber delight, the head is creamy, light beige, the lace in clinging sheets. Nose is malt, the top is light, and the finish is corporeally hopped, pleasantly dry, leniently carbonated. Fuller's is one of my top ten all time favorite breweries."
"An excellent pale ale. Each pull urges you to take another. At the end of one glass you'll start looking around for the next... An excellent session beer."
"I've had it on cask at the brewery and at a couple of other pubs in London, from what i can judge, it has to be well kept otherwise you can forget it (as with most cask ales), well kept, it is wonderfully aromatic, resiny, hoppy, bitter, citrusy, there was a pub in richmond in London that totally kicked arse and served it better than the brewery did, i can't remember the name of the pub, but i often dream about that pint. My rating is based on that pint."
"Brilliant amber color, full head fell to a thin ring of white foam. Flavor is malty with soft hop notes throughout. Slight esters contribute delicious buttery and sweet ale flavors that mix well with the malt and hops creating a slightly sweet and aromatic finish. I can discern the character that some brewers in the US are trying to capture. I like this beer. I will buy this if I can't get my favorite domestic English Pale Ale (see my reviews, I don't want to sound like a paid shill anymore)."
"Amber in color with decent head and lacing.  The aroma was heavy on the malt with faint hop undertones.  The taste was excellent when the hops shone through.  The full, long-lasting flavor was big in the mouthfeel department and this is a VERY drinkable beer. An excellent english style pale ale."
"This pale pours a nice dark copper from the bottle with a sizeable off-white head, which looks great. There is a faint hops smell. The taste is somewhat biscuit-like with heavy malt notes and a hint of hops. The mouthfeel is rather creamy and malty. The drinkability is quite good. A great example of an EPA."
"This is a real winner on draught. It has a healthy white head and a pleasant smell that is subtle hops and malt. The taste is also a nice balance of slightly sweet malt flavor with a hint of hops. It goes down like silk. This is one of my favorite session beers and goes well with many meals, not the least of which is a genuine plate of fish and chips."
"Notes: Indeed this brew goes down as one of the greatest ... bliss in a bottle. BTW this is Fuller's flagship brew. A true ale-drinkers ale. Up there in greatness with the ESB also."
"An interesting Pale. Reminded me alot of Bass, but without that ""metallic"" taste Bass is known for.  Fuller's puts out some fine beers and this is quite good as well.  Pours out to a golden/amber color, with a light aroma.  Slight hop taste that is in no way overwhelming with a slight taste of caramel.  Very easy to drink."
"Rich carmel colored beer with a pillow soft white head. Very inviting hop bitterness hits your nose. Extemely rich hop bitter taste with full malt backbone. Very creamy smooth balanced beer. Crisp dry finish, asks you to drink more and more. Very smooth feel, very easy to drink to the point you feel guilty putting your glass down. A real treat on tap, a great beer, and perfect example of the style. Magic in a glass...."
"A fine example of what English Pales should aspire to be.  It drinks hearty and tastey and is a good looker.  Dig it, dig again.  Cheers!"
"I can't say anything bad about any of Fulers beers I have tried they are all very good.  This pale ale is a little on the dark side IMO for the style.  Not much aroma here and has a decent mouthfeel to it.  Taste more on the malty side than the hoppy, I think a little more hops would enhance this beer.  Overall I will gladly drink this brew again...............CHEERS"
"Great traditional bitter,nice bronze color with a light amount of lace.A lot of malt aromas going on caramel brown sugar and biscuit dough only a light geranium hop presence lingers.A true session ale malty and fruity with some iron in there but there is a green hop presence light but it make the beer balanced,a gret ale from Fuller's."
"Deep golden in color with a hint of orange...small lace...nice doughy aroma...almost like being in a bakery...malt dominates the buds with a tasty bread/dough flavor....hops are not strong but deliver a tight dry finish...VERY drinkable...overall very good pale ale bordering on outstanding.."
"Pours an orange  copper color, with a minimal off-white head. On the nose the aroma is moderately malty light toasted bread, caramel notes evident, and hop aromas. On the palate the malty flavors take front seat with caramel, light toasted bread, and hops take the back seat, nice fruitiness to it, well balanced with a smooth mouth feel. I really liked this stuff, I love going back and forth from the English Pale Ales back to the more hop filled American pale ales. Overall great stuff, and a great session brew..."
"Pours a nice deep golden with a very slight head that has no retention.  I get very little on the nose.  Just a little herbal character from the hops.  Pretty good taste.  Nice malt backbone.  Good earthy tones from the hops.  And a nice dry touch.  Medium body.  This beer gets better as you work your way through it.  I tend to prefer American Style Pale Ales more than the English counterpart, but this is one of the best English versions I've come across."
"Fuller's is really good with Malts. I'm not sure if they malt their own, but if they don't, they sure know how to buy them. The malt flavors are complex in and of themselves. That's good because it's really light on hops (on tap anyway) and the malt has to carry it. It's not an IPA or a Bitter, so it's not supposed to be really hoppy. This is a really good meal to go with a meal. It really went well with the Shepherd's Pie I had."
"Fine clear deeper amber color, approaching copper.  Nice 3/4 inch head that's big-bubbled on the outside and cottony on the inside.  Sweet and sour smell, a little like candied lemon.  Great low-carbonation body, malty sweet with a touch of restrained hops.  Very much of the English style but far more flavorful than a Bass.  Medium-bodied and satisfying and highly drinkable.  I prefer the hoppier American Pales but this is good.  Nice brew from Fuller's again."
"Copper in hue and perfectly clear.  The head settles quickly leaving a meager layer.  There isn't any lace left.  Assertive and earthy Fuggles hop nose hits first, but mild biscuit malt notes follow.  The carbonation, at least in this bottle, is too high and results in a soda - like prickly mouthfeel.  Hop flavor is grassy and distinctively British-- hop bitterness is crisp and assertive (considering the lack of malt body) while the subdued malt flavors are comprised of bready and generic caramal malt notes.  London Pride finishes dry and a touch toasty.  It's a good pale, but malt flavors were lacking, IMO. I could still drink a lot of these."
"Fat lace clings to glass above a copper liquid nirvana. Rich, bready, fruity nose. Drink in a deep malt start that turns instantly bitter and lingers enough to beckon you to taste again. Smooth and appropriate for a session or a treat. A standard that any brewer going for the English Pale should reckon. Worth the outlay."
"An excellent all around drinking beer."
"A totally soothing smooth malty ale. The bottled version we get here is just a tease. Having this cask conditioned in the U.K. is really where it's at, Maltier almost caramel taste is the base. Smooth mellow hops with a touch of fruitiness rounds out this top ale. One of the keepers."
"A good solid choice, and a nice benchmark for the classic pale ale style. Malty, firm, crisp with a nice soft character. You can't got wrong with this beer."
"This is a classic English pale. Rather mild malt with a gentle hop flavor and aroma."
"Firm body and a steady finish.  This is the sort of beer I associate with the name ""English ale."""
"Perhaps the best real ale around. Anything less is a disappointment."
