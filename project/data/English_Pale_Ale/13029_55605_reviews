"O: Very refreshing but one bottle is enough."
""
""
""
"Taste is juicy-zesty light bitterness that just dominates and lingers.  It has light juicy sweetness, hint of mineral."
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
"- The label has evolved, and is quite a bit jazzier than the one shown above."

"D: This was a poor brew. The scent and taste and body were all far below average. It didn't even look good. Not very easy to drink either, almost a drain pour."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a great session-able pale ale that's not super bitter. The Nelson Sauvin hops give it a nice fruity bitterness.  Glad this was recommended to me."

"Pours light golden white foam head medium body with moderate carbonation, Citrus, Tropical fruits, Floral, Pine Hops, With a good bitterness, Hoppy finish. Very clean well balanced crisp refreshing beer from thornbridge!"
"Overall, an OK ale, looks pretty good in the glass, no overwhelming malt or hops, well-balanced. Not sure what makes this a ""South Pacific style pale ale""."
"O: If the flavor was 'bigger' so to speak, it would kill many 'Murican-brewed pale ales stone dead. Still, this is more-or-less everything I want from the style. What a shame it's so expensive..."
""
""
""
"I was embezzled with the first Kipling I had tried a while ago. This one wasn't that fresh so it suffered a bit, especially in the aroma. Still it is a beer full of elegance, assertive, balanced to perfection, and refreshing even at room temperature, with a huge drinkability. Nelson Sauvin hops are clearly noticeable here."
""

""

"A refreshing, light, balanced ale but nothing spectacular."
"O: Excellent drinkability. Great British Ale with a strong American profile"
""
""
"An excellent beer & great example of an American pale ale that is quite refreshing and goes down a treat with a solid bitter flavour and plenty of pine hops shining through. A great beer and one that I'd have again given the chance."
""

""

"Despite some choices made in its construction, this is a very good beer, and even a very enjoyable and interesting one. If I complain about it having less flavour than it should, then it's almost certainly just a reflection on me rather than the beer. This is expertly made, extremely well crafted, and just drinkable as hell. Good stuff."

"Body feels a bit watery."
"Overall Impression: A nice beer to kick back and drink in the sun on a hot day, as it does quench thirst fairly well, but definitely lacking in body and overall “umph.” I was disappointed by the lack of taste after such a fantastic nose. Advertised as having “initial sweetness” and “medium body”, but I find it to be definitively lacking in both of those areas. It drinks very watery."
""
""
"O- Great beer, well made, and despite not being an extreme beer, you could drink all night. As usual with Thornbrisdge, unsure whther to drink at English temp, or New World temp. Went for middle ground, seemed to work."
""
"O- a tasty 5.2% abv brew that's easy drinking and quite enjoyable."
"Pours yellow, dark and cloudy. Fluffy white foam that is clingy. Fruity passion fruit nose. Malty too. Quite peppy. Smooth full tasty fruit tones, firm hop. Smooth throughout. Leaves a pleasant follow through taste. Surprisingly really good,."
"D - Very drinkable. Nice balanced hoppy English Pale Ale."
""
"O/D - Nice and fruity. Shows off Nelson well. Light and easy to drink, yet flavourful and complex."
""
""
""
"O- The fresh easy drinking beer has great hop flavor but the malt and yeast profile are pretty well hidden. It still very drinkable and would be lovely as a British pint instead of a 10oz. tulip."
"Overall: Infinitely quaffable. Light, crisp characteristic with a mild aromatic profile and refreshing array of flavors make Thornbridge's Kipling and excellent summer beer. A definite improvement on many summer standards. I approve."
"Overall, this beer is well balanced, tasty and refreshing."
"O: fantastic English pale....more like a prototypical American pale, but with very (or entirely) English nuances....could see this being misinterpreted and/or underrated (though I see here many agree with me on its merits)"
""
""
""
"Rating it based on enjoyment rather than style, as this is unlike any other ""British"" ale I have had... would definitely recommend!"
""
""
"Well crafted but not a beer I'll be trying to find again: my taste buds prefer sweeter, maltier flavours."
""
""
""
"Overall: a great choice for summer with light, unusual flavours, and very easy-drinking"
""
"D - Well crafted, solid brew. An easy drinker with just enough punch to catch you out."
""
"In short,a decisevly bitter in balance ale with white wine aroma and grassy flavor (500 ml into pint, BB 04-08-2013)."
""
"Overall, this is pretty great. I'd have this on tap all the time if it were common locally. Complex but subtle and without a huge ABV."
""
""
""
"Notes: This is a tasty, fragrant, pleasing beer. Very nice."
"Possibly the best showing for Nelson Sauvin ever."
"Bright gold and mostly clear in the glass with a pure white head of fine bubbles which lace a bit. The smell is pretty incredible for an english pale ale. The hops give off a amazing variety of fruity aromas ranging from pineapple to citrus including grapefruits and lemons to mango. Beyond the hops there is a touch of caramel malt. The taste follows the smell but the fruit is toned down and the hops end up tasting more grassy and floral than fruity. Bitterness is fairly restrained as the hops are more flavorful than bitter, that moderate bitterness is balanced with a sweet bready maltiness. The mouthfeel of this beer is moderate with lively carbonation both of which are spot on for the style. The finish is just sweet enough and crisply bitter. Overall this is an incredibly flavorful, rather unique EPA that is a joy to drink. A world class example without question."
""
"This beer was good but a little confusing."
"OVERALL: A really impressive English pale ale. Easy drinking, great flavor, everything was spot on. If you get the chance to try this, don't pass it up."
""
"O/D-I am pretty much always disappointed with English hoppy beers. This honestly may be my favorite take on any such style that applies from the UK. Those hops are so damn cool and unusual. Great time in a glass. loved it."
""
""
"Pours a clear, straw color. 1/2 inch head of a white color. Great retention and good lacing. Smells of citrus hops, hint of sweet malt, hint of grass, slight floral hops, and slight spice. Fits the style of an English Pale Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and creamy, with a low carbonation level. Tastes of slight earthy malt, floral hops, hint of citrus hops, slight grass, hint of alcohol, and a hint of pale malt. Overall, good appearance, aroma, feel, and body."
"Impressive English ale. Hop flavors are present in this beer vs. other English pale ales. Nose is citrus and definitely forward with grapefruit. Tongue is the same and has a deeper flavor profile than a lot of other English pale ales. One to remember for the next trip across the pond."
"O: Not your typical English Pale Ale, but this isn't a bad thing. Extremely well made and drinkable."
""
"Overall: I abandoned expectations heading into this and I was really surprised. This beer is delicious."
""
"Given all of the labeling as well as being able to see suspended particulate, I went with about as gentle a pour as I have ever employed. I still got a skim of bone-white foam that quickly became mere wisps, however. My second, lees-ridden, pour created a finger of rocky, off-white head with good retention. Lacing was prevalent throughout. Color was an ever-so-slightly-hazy sunshine yellow with lots of carbonation bubbles in evidence. Nose had an odd fruitiness, like grapefruit and pineapple together. Mouthfeel was very effervescent and it did, indeed, taste like a hybrid of a grapefruit and a pineapple. Finish was quite dry with the grapefruit taste simply lingering well after the swallow. I really must try more of Thornbridge's beers."

""
""
"Buy yourself more than one bottle of this. Very enjoyable. Recommended."
""
"A really nice pale ale, characteristic of a lot of the pale ales coming out of the UK right now."
""
"Final Grade: 4.31, an outstanding A grade. Thornbridge's Kipling claims to be a 'South Pacific Pale Ale', and its plethora of delicious, juicy hop aromatics and fruity flavours certainly do their part to evoke in my mind imagery reminiscent of that region. A superb brew, without any asterisks or caveats - just a fabulous pint all around. This should be on shelves year-round, but I'd settle for it being an annual LCBO import."
"Bottle courtesy of Thirstybird (thanks Rian). 26.05.12 indicated on the bottle. Pours a straw gold with a rocky, half inch head embedded with tiny pinpricks - some particles are evident floating in solution. Great nose on this beer - mild tropical fruit notes, citrus and a light earthy character. Taste follows nose; however, light malts also manifest in the flavor profile, with an earthy presence through the middle and back, a slight buttery character and a mild, lingering earthy bitterness at the finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a pleasant, even carbonation and a light acidity that refreshes the palate. Overall, a very pleasant and easy drinking EPA (perhaps one of the best I've had to date). The Nelson-Sauvin hops add a really great character to this beer. Well worth trying if the opportunity presents itself."
""
"Hazy orange with a couple fingers of white head. Good retention, patches of lace. Nose is sweet, spicey and piney. Tropical fruits and a sweet malt character. Nelson hops are certainly the feature. Taste exemplifies Nelson again, great tropical, light white wine and herbal/piney character. Good hop bitterness, and only a small bit of malt breadiness/sweetness. Medium body and carb - much improved than the disappointing experience I had with the Jaipur. A real solid Nelson pale ale."
"O - Oh this is good stuff. Will definitely pick more up while it's still available."
""
"M - Medium body with moderate carbonation. Slightly over carbonated."
""
"Light-bodied with moderate carbonation without feeling thin or watery. It feels slick. I love the deep tropical hop character this beer has. In my admittedly limited experience, this might be the best IPA I've ever tasted."
"This is a very tasty, hoppy pale ale. Really showcases these delicious fruity hops well. A bit expensive, but worth it as a treat."
"A good drinker, and good for its style, it pours lighter yellow with a lasting white soapy head. Mild wine aroma. Medium mouthfeel, carbonation right there, it is unique in a soft and flavourful hop, citrus.Nice coup for the LCBO getting Thornbridge.Nice sweet backing."
"Great brew - I'll be drinking Jaipur and Kipling all summer if I can swing it. A great display of these wonderful hops."
"I tried this beer on May 30, 2012 after purchasing from the KIng and Spadina LCBO outlet in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The beer poured a slightly hazed medium gold colour with a 1"" snow white head, and plenty of effervescence. The aromas were grtass, citrusy hops, spices, and orange peel. The mouthfeel was medium bodied with medium carbonation. The flavour was definitely on the bitter side with very little nsweetness brought on by any of the malt or fruit aromas. Generous amounts of orange and grapefruit and a sharp bitter end dominate the flavour. Would be a very sessionable beer had it not been for the bitter aftertaste."
"O - A very tasty pale ale, serving up a solid dose of citrus hops which would please any critics. Definitely worthy of grabbing a few more bottles before they disappear."
"Overall, very nice. A very flavourful and enjoyable pale ale."
"Overall - I really enjoyed this one.. it's almost like an east coast PA meets an west coast PA. It actually kind of reminded me of a beer I get locally called Crazy Canuck to some extent. The high price tag would be my only complaint with this one, but it's defiantly worth buying at least once."
""
"Pours a hazy pale blonde colour, one finger fluffy white head, some lacing at the top of the glass. Smell is incredibly hoppy, lots of tropical and citrus fruits going on, orange, mango, grapefruit, a slight sweetness with some malt but this is a full on fruity hop nose all the way. Taste is dry and hoppy followed by a more pronounced malt bill, some earthy hop bitterness with some tropical fruit flavours coming in mid palate towards the finish, light sweetness in finish and aftertaste. Medium crisp carbonation, med body, some oily points and quite dry feeling. This was a very impressive pale ale, very easy drinking and something I would welcome many times over."
""
"D: Quite a good pale ale that I'd pick up again. Aroma was off the charts and the taste was pretty gosh-darn good too."
""
"You'd be hard pressed to find a more stinky, grassy, and tropical pale ale anywhere, including southern California. It's hard to believe this beer comes from jolly-old England. Or, then again, when you consider just how approachable and balanced - ""sessionable"" dare I say - Thornbridge Kipling is, perhaps it shouldn't be such a shock. A fantastic offering."
"Bottle: Poured a hazy yellowish color ale with a nice pure white foamy head with good retention and some good lacing. Aroma of fruity and floral hops with light grassy notes is very enticing. Taste is dominated by the grassy, fruity and floral notes form the hops with almost no bitterness notes and a solid malt backbone with well balanced sweetness that doesn’t detract from the hops. Body is quite full with great carbonation. Very well brewed with just the right amount of Nelson Sauvin hops to procure maximum enjoyment of this beer."
"I like this a lot. I can't help hoping it'll be like some beer version of skunk after getting a whiff of it, but the taste belies the aroma. Its quite a soft beer despite the grapefruit - a gentler cousin to Halcyon and Jaipur."

"Cheers!"
""
"Picked this up at my favorite beer store in Belgium, Dranken Geers. Nice clear golden-yellow pour with two finger pure white head with decent retention and nice lacing. The nose will absolutely blow you away. The Nelson Sauvin hops totally steal the show! Tons of that distinctive aroma full of grapefruit and tropical fruit, reminiscent of New Zealand’s sauvignon blanc wines. The taste is complex and also dominated by the Nelson Sauvin hops. Earthy, herbal, and citrusy at the same time. Hints of grapefruit, gooseberries, lemon, white grapes, pineapple, and an odd touch of green onion. The mouthfeel is oily and resiny with a light, crisp, and refreshing dry finish. Another awesome beer from Thornbridge!"
"good solid mouthfeel slightly lively carbonation makes a tasty brew"
""
"O: As someone that really enjoys the smell and taste of the Nelson Sauvin hops, I found this beer to be quite enjoyable and a good offering that highlights the hop. This beer is a real easy drinker and has a very nice balance to it."
"Taste - Again, a bit of grain and a lot of tropical fruit, but the flavours do not come off as fruity, and certainly not sweet. The tropical fruits of the aroma are present in the flavour, but are accompanied by solid bitterness, and an interesting tar-like note."
""
"O: This beer is very easy to drink because it is well balanced. The Nelson Sauvin hops result in interesting aromas and flavors."
""
"I might be grabbing another one of these just to acquaint myself with the hop, I can't think of having this hop before and I'd like to have it again"
"A unique hybrid of a relatively old beer style fused with a relatively new varierty of hop. More importanly is that the hybrid works. I'm be looking forward towards more Thornbridge in the future."
"A tasty, enjoyable English Pale Ale that gives a serious nod towards APA's. I'd reach for another of these for sure, and love the name's homage to one of my favourite writers."
""
"Well, the Nelson Sauvin hops do a damned fine job of furthering the terroir of New Zealand - so many strange flavours for a pale ale - a thought stolen from Old World white wine drinkers at some point, I would imagine. A little intense, and confounding, at first, but once settled in, I rather enjoyed this little antipodean experiment."

"Taste is like a pale ale should be, I had some pumpkin and pineapple in the taste."
"There is some very appealing tropical fruit on the nose. A much fuller body than the bottled version which to be honest swamps and smothers some of the beer's more appealing and delicate qualities. But as compensation the force of the body pulls the flavour around the mouth giving you a real sense of a full long massaging bitterness. Still, I miss that lightness of touch that comes from the bottle I am afraid to say."
"Overall: Easy drinking, refreshing beer with great citrus notes balanced well with the bitter finish. Perfect drinking for a 29 degree London afternoon. Many rave about Jaipur, but I’m more of a Kipling fan."
"This ale certainly improved as it breathed, as it released a lot of the ""skunkiness"" that first presented in the smell and taste. The bitterness is classic Thornbridge; in fact, whichever hop was used to create the bitterness likely is the same one used in their Jaipur IPA. Not a bad English PA, though slightly more bitter than others I've had - something that works for me. Still, of the Jaipur, the Raven and the Kipling, the Kipling is my least favorite of the bunch."
"Flavor is firmly bitter, plenty of grassy, lemony hop character. Dried citrus peel, hay, some vague weediness. Effervescent and medium bodied, exceptionally dry and crisp finish. Light and not too filling. Nicely drinkable, several would be easy to drink, if only it wasn't $9 for a small glass."
"Brilliant golden pour on tap at Piper's Pub in Pittsburgh's Southside, it's a pale golden ale much like a hazed Czech or German pils in appearance. Light biscuit malts labeled as a South Pacific Pale Ale, recently showed up at my local in Ohio for 6.99 a 500 ml bottle. I hate to say it but I passed at those prices. I'm pretty sure I had an imperial pint for at or around 5 bucks at Piper's. Aroma has a citrus grapefruit esque earthy grassy hop profile about it. Very pleasant floral aspect as well, all those hops amongst a pale biscuit malt background a bit of fruity earthiness comes through from the yeast and English brewing traditions. Flavor was nice a really refreshing hoppy pale ale, English style not an Americanized pale not as aggressive but very well executed and flavors definitely blend together nicely. The pale biscuit malt sweetness with a mild fruitiness is the perfect back drop for the star of the show in this case Nelson Sauvin hops. Those hops bring the herbal grassiness with a nice persistent grapefruit pith bitterness. Mouthfeel was lighter bodied with moderate carbonation a really crsip nice drinking pale ale with great complexity for a beer so light in color. Overall impression is that it would be a great beer to attempt to drink in number, but the price point at 6.99 a bottle may stop me from drinking it indefinitely."
"Overall I was really impressed with this beer and could easily have more than a few of these. Well worth a shot."
"My friend had a 500ml bottle of this and split it with me, into pint glasses. Pours a bright body with plenty of head, great color an English IPA, or a ""South Pacific Style"" as they call it. Smell has the slightly more subdued hop profile characteristic of the English IPAs (compared to the huge West Coast IPAs). Very clean, with a unique hop profile. Taste is plenty bitter with a depth of malt character and some hop varieties that I have not tasted before, or at least not in this particular combination. Really solid English IPA. Recommended."
"Overall a good refreshing beer, went well with a roast pork dinner."
"While not visibly highly carbonated the beer has a biting, carbonated mouthfeel that finishes dry. This is a very flavorful and refreshing beer."
"M: A surprisingly quaffable ale, light but hopped to a tropical tune. A wide array of citric bitterness, sugary sweet at times, dominates the ale."
"O - Sadly, I was not eating any food alongside this beer. I would love to explore its abilities to pair with food, which I think would also help to counteract what I think is a touch too much bitterness. Nelson Sauvin is fairly high in alpha acid, and I am sure that they'll tweak the next batch accordingly. From what I am reading this is the first commercial example of a beer brewed with this hop variety, so I'm sure that while a small (almost infinitesimal) tweak is in order, but I have a very high opinion of this beer, and I think that anyone who doesn't should give it a second (or third, or fourth) shot."
"Poured clear, yellow, with a nice white head that retained rather well throughout. Light, grassy, floral nose. Light taste, very smooth, with notes of grass and light fruits. Light mouthfeel, easily drinkable, but not extremely flavorful."
"M&D: the mouthfeel remains refreshing without going fizzy, the body is medium for the alc. level, and the flavour profile is evolving and showing a very very decent balance. I’ve tried this wonderful pale ale for many times now, on cask, and this bottled version really doesn’t disappoint at all. A delicious thirst-quencher."
"O: This was a fun beer to delve into. I drank this on-tap without knowing anything about it aside from the fact that it's English. Then I saw the label and it said South Pacific Pale Ale it made sense. If there's not Nelson Sauvin hops in this I would be shocked, shocked. Great EPA, like nothing I've ever had before."
"d: Very flavorful pale ale with a nice hop bite, I'm surprised a cask from across the pond traveled so well."
"O- Very solid English Pale Ale almost ventures into IPA category."
"Had this with a hand drawn pump. The appearance was in an imperial pint glass with a slight hazy dull straw color, slight white head and low carbonation. The smell was a little band-aidy and funky. The beer had a slight sulfur aftertaste; almost like it was infected, but another person in my group said they thought it was just fine. I don't know that I would get it again."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a decent beer to pound down for a while."
"medium bodied, very drinkable. if this were reasonably priced i'd make this a go to session beer."
"Overall this a good beer which showcases this amazing hop variety to a tee. While I recommend this, I do so with the asterisk, because it is overpriced for the overall product/offering. The Alpine brewery does a better showcase of this hop with their brew Nelson and it is much cheaper and comes in a 22 oz compared to a 500 ml. Still good though."
"D - Excellent and very, very drinkable. The balance and selection of flavor in this beer is perfect for the style and it is a shockingly good English pale ale, especially considering that it came out of a bottle. I can't think of a beer available on my local beer store's shelves that expresses what is great about British beer better than this does. It has a perfect yeast character with the obligatory must hop bite and the malt is spot on, despite the fact that the beer is unusually light colored. My only complaint is that I can't stop thinking about how good it must be out of a cask!"
"One of my local pubs has this on permanently since they bought two barrels and sold them both within 3 hours, and that makes me happy."
"Iam really diggin the Thornbridge stuff I gotta say.Poured into an imperial nonic a dull llemon yeallow with a thin quick to fade white head.Aromas of sweet biscuit malt and tropical fruit,fitting for a south Pacific pale ale.Flavors of sweetish biscuit dough mixed with overripe mango,pineapple,and some green apple,even a litle leafiness in the finish.An easy quaffer and a sold EPA at that,I would buy again."
"Review: Great smell. Strong flavors of tropical fruit - kiwi, citrus, lemon. Letting the beer open up and sit for 10 minutes at room temperature really opened up all the flavors. Paired with wild mushroom Brie puff pastry."
"An excellent example of the style from the place where it originated (England). Check it out."
"A very tasty beer, flavoursome and distinctive. Would suit a hot day, but great anytime. The 'fruity' hops are unlike anything else I've tried. Worth seeking out to sample."
"D: I love me some Nelson Sauvin hops, so this one hit the spot for me. I prefer it showcased alongside a more substantial malt backbone, though."
"Good."
"Overall - An excellent pale ale and another fine brew from Thornbridge... definitely recommended..."
"Good stuff."
"Nice and smooth and even with a 5.2 ABV you feel like you could spend an afternoon drinking these."
"Just about perfectly golden, with a soft, pillowy white head with very good retention. Delightfully aromatic, and I know this may be a bit taboo on a beer site, but it smells an awful lot like a cross between a New Zealand sauvignon blanc and an Alsatian Gewürztraminer - gooseberry abounds, plus loads of coconut and lychee and even some rose. Honeysuckle and marshmallow are in the mix as well - but the flavor is quite contained, very vinous with gooseberry, kiwi fruit, and honey notes. Crisp and perfectly bitter, with snappy carbonation and a dry finish. This is an excellent and unusual English ale, and I would love to try it on cask."
