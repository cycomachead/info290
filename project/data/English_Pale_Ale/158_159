Anyway, this stuff pours a clear amber topped by a finger of lightly off-cream-white foam. The nose comprises earthy and spicy greens, light leek, cilantro, mustard seed, and peat moss. ...Didn't see that coming, like a surprise roundhouse from JCVD. The taste is mostly a blast of spicy and salty greens (think a salad of cilantro, chive, parsley, and spinach, all drizzled with a chlorinated peppercorn dressing), though there is a backbone of mild biscuit trying desperately to bring things back to reality. No avail, I'm afraid. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a wet feel. Overall, this is a strange and downright unpleasant (or, if I'm not being so euphemistically-inclined, nasty) beer. It's touted as a balanced and mild English-style pale ale, but it comes across as an oddly spicy and salty mess. I thought I got a bad bottle, but, upon talking with others who have had it from the source (on tap in the Rockies), it's clear this stuff is just plain awful.","TMoney2591","May 30, 2013"

3.58,-3.2,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"This is a pleasant ale to knock back during dinnertime. Denver Pale Ale features an amber orangish color with an attractive creamy head which retains well. The nose hints that this pale ale is going across the Atlantic for its inspiriation, lead by notes of orange, cream, and buttery fusels. The taste starts off crisp and netural, eventually breaking towards a buttersctoch note. A modest kick of hops make their mark in the 2nd half of each sip. Offering both a crisp and somewhat creamy texture, this pale ale is a more than fair choice.","DoubleJ","Oct 16, 2012"

A nice medium body to this thing. A very solid EP that fans of pale ale's will surely like a lot more than me. For me, I can drink it happily but generally don't go out of my way for.","denver10","Feb 02, 2012"

4.69,26.8,3.5,4.5,5,5,4.5,"At first glance, this isn't all that different than your standard APA. It's a nice amber color, but nothing overly glowing. Has a clean, white 1 finger head after the pour, but it doesn't stick around for very long. The appearance is the only thing that I find average on this beer. The smell holds little back: sweet, earthy hops right up front, but the malts get in there too. The same could be said for that first swig of it: more hops than it would lead you to believe right up front, but a really nice malty backbone that a lot of beers with this much hops seem to leave out. In fact, the balance on this one is really spot-on. The mouthfeel is a little thicker than your typical pale, with medium, foamy carbonation, but this beer is really very drinkable. I think the mouthfeel is really where it excels. Overall, this is my favorite standard pale ale. The 5.4% is hard to believe from a beer that packs this much hoppiness, but I don't think there's much that could get better about it. A staple in my fridge.","coombuyah26","Feb 01, 2012"

This is truly a visually appealing beer. Smell is of toffee, grainy malts, and citrus hops. The taste emphasizes the malts, but it still doesn't seem disproportionally flavored to me. The taste starts with a caramel sweetness them gets a mottled more toasty. A slight bitterness is imparted by the citric hops. Mouthfeel is good, feels satisfyingly thick, often other pale ales feel a little weak in this dept to me.

There is a fairly large amount of bitterness that comes at the finish, and it linger for a while with spiciness and citrus flavors. No alcohol noticed at all. Medium body and fairly high carbonation, the carbonation seems to detract some of the flavor, but is not too bad. Some good balance of the hops and malts.

I get a lot of citrus hops in the aroma. Makes me think more American than English. Just a hint of floral in the aroma as well. Flavor features the citrus hops as well. A little too much caramel malt for my taste. Sort of has an artificial, plastic flavor. Bitterness is high for an English style. More substanital body than other pale ales.

Aromatics offer up a nice bread dough or biscuit malt sweetness with dry yeast notes, on the backend comes delicate floral and light citric hops flowing. Flavor is beautifully balanced APA, not aggressive with hop bitterness but has herbal and floral hop flavor. Malts are nice with biscuit malt flavors holding up the backbone of this brew. It is definitely English style compared to most APAs, you almost ask yourself where are the hops? Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied slighty oily texture going on, carbonation is soft and mild, which fits the flavor profile well.

Otherwise, there is some dry malt flavor with a kiss of sweetness. There is a bit of coating, but nothing significant. The carbonation is average.

4.13,11.6,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Poured from a cellar-temperature bottle into a standard pint glass. Beer pours a clear golden amber, with lots of tiny bubbles and a big, rich, off-white head. Bubbles in the head are a variety of sizes, and it leaves lots of lace on the glass. Aroma is mild and malty, with traces of yeast and hop. The flavor is big on malt, with a dry hop bitterness taking over toward the end. There are other flavors lending complexity to the brew, but I can't quite identify what I'm tasting - I just know it's good. Carbonation is present but not overly so, keeping the flavors moving but not making the beer feel too crisp or thin, and there is a good amount of malty body to this beer. This is a hearty pale, very drinkable - interesting enough to keep me drinking, but not so interesting that I'm getting a flavor burnout.","Ladybugger","Jan 03, 2010"

Tastes of hops, but I pick up more piney/woody hops up in the taste with only a bit of citrus. First few sips had large malt presence but as the glass emptied the hops picked up and it started tasting more like an IPA. Malt was heavy in the aftertaste, turned into a well balanced hop/malt beer. Mouthfeel is light-medium, coats the mouth well and has a bit of cream to it, medium carbonation, good mouthfeel.

The hops were relatively big and upfront with grassy citrus flavors and aromas. The malts, on the other hand, are hard to pick out behind the hops and only give off a bit of mellow biscuit. So overall, this was a tasty and sessionable pale ale, but I'd have liked a more balanced flavor before I call it a great beer.","tempest","Oct 16, 2008"

When I poured out an ounce or two of beer I got like six fingers worth of head,I'm baffled. After ten miniutes or so I finaly got to take a sip and it was worth the wait. This brew smells sweet with ripe bananas and grassy hops in abundance. The flavors are nicely balanced with some lightly toasted malts and good amount of hoppage. It seems to lose it's carbonation at a rapid pace,but the body overall was a bit fuller than expected(a nice suprise),left a little residual sticky coating behind.

Colour is a medium orange with a snow white head that, even with an aggresive pour, doesn't stick around very long. Smell is sweet hops with a good measure of malt, too, indicating a well balanced brew. At least in the smell, anyway. Taste is fantastic in that the hops, while present, are rather modest. There is no doubt that this has your stereotypical West-Coast style hops, but it just isn't so over the top or "in-your-face" like so many others. Low to medium intensity malt up front, bitter hops in the middle and on the finish, then malt again a few seconds after you've swallowed.

Looking for no frills, just some straight-forward drinking. I don't think there's anything wrong with that. A two-finger, slightly off-white head sits atop a pale golden brew. Retention is excellent. When it finally fades a consistent lacing is left surrounding the glass all the way to the top. There's not much going on aromatically speaking. Malt, esthers, a slight lemony zest, and almost no hops. Taste is a bit more robust with the hops floating between the malts, grass and oranges. Carbonation isn't bad, with fairly good activity after each drink. Mouth-feel is a bit dry. All in all this brew has a pretty good drinkability to taste ratio, and happens to fulfill the qualities I was originally looking for. It doesn't knock the ball out of the park, but it will get a good single or double if you're looking to get a man on base until the big hitter comes up to bat.","stephens101","Feb 28, 2008"

This faded reluctantly down to just a small thin film across the top and that pretty much stayed the entire time. Now there was a good amount of side glass lace present here and this had a really nice effect of the look of this. I know it was a pale ale, but it was really starting to look like an IPA. Smell was very hopped, but also nice and light. Very nice blend of floral hops and light grassy grains. The flavor was very similar to this as well. A very nice hopped up front greeted you right away and was quickly followed up by the nice and almost a touch of sweet grain like back to it. Long drawn out dry finish left a really nice taste and follow through. The feel was great. Lots of carbonation really helping to push it along and lighten it up nicely. Absolutely great session ale, something that could have gone on and on and it would have been no worry to me at all. I really liked this one overall; I thought it was a fine example of a big hopped west coast pale ale. Something that was light enough to get let you put down a couple, while at the same time, really had a nice touch of floral, bitter hops to it. I would definitely recommend this one and will have to go pick some up; this could become a staple of the house very easily. Just seemed like the perfect session ale.","mikesgroove","Oct 17, 2007"

The aroma of the beer is well balance with moderate sweet maltiness and moderate hop aroma, elements of spicy and citrusy. The beer glides into my mouth riding its moderate carbonation and delivers moderate sweet maltiness quickly followed by moderate bitterness. There is a fair amount of hop flavor in the beer, in the moderate/moderate-high range. The hop flavor is tasty, I think the best way to describe it would be spicy, maybe slightly citrusy. The DPA has a medium bodied mouthfeel with average drinkability. The beer would seemingly go very well with pizza or a spicy pasta dish. Overall, the DPA is a well balanced beer offering a nice malty sweetness upfront, quickly followed by a good balance of hop bitterness and hop flavors.

Very enjoyable but threw me a curveball. light bodied and clean in the mouth. The reason I picked it up was becuase it was on sale at beers of the world, and I hadn't tried it yet.

The taste is sweet at first and then you get a fair amount of hop taste that balances this brew out. Over all it is a good brew, nothing spectacular but one I would not mind having in the fridge.

No real hop characte coming through in the nose. Flavor is simialr to the aroma...very raw and grainey. Very nice toasted maltyness with just a hint of graineyness to give it an edge. I'm not getting a lot of hop flavor, but there is a moderate but mellow hop bitterness on the finish that lingers just long enough to let me know it is there. Feel is on the lighter end of moderate with a lighter carbonation. It works well with the flavors of this one. Overall, I am liking this one. The raw quality really gives it an edge that I have not found in other pale ales. I have always liked taking grain and chewing on it before mashin in, so that may be where this one draws me in.

The body is medium but the mouthfeel has clear traction to it, leading you to believe it will be gritty and hoppy. As Lee Corso would say, not so fast my friend. The lovely hop notes are balanced well with what can mostly be described by a sweet, creamy malt concoction. The contrast is unreal.

I like this beer, it kind of brings a new kick to the pale ale but still sticking to the tradional style.

The beer itself is crystal clear, copper in color, and has streams of tiny bubbles rising throughout. The aroma is light and crisp with just a hint of malt to go along with notes of orange from the hops. The citrusy hop aroma is a bit strange, almost aritificial/chemical and a bit distracting. Searching the bottle I find it was bottled in the first week of June. Not the freshest pale ale I've had, but it should be fine. The strange chemical orange flavor seems to enter my mouth along with the beer, but it's not stopping me. Flavors are faint and crisp. Very light malt base reminds me of white bread, and then there is a dash of sweet citrus hop flavor. The finish is strange with a bitterness thatis mild, but is still overpowering and a bit of plastic thrown in for good measure.

The aroma is interesting, with a sweet maltiness (caramel malt maybe?) followed by a subtle floral hops scent. The taste is interesting but for me doesnt live up to the smell, first the hops hit your tongue with a mild bitterness (definately not one of the hoppier American Pale's) followed by a bit of bready malt flavor but quickly reverts back to the hop oils with a lightly bitter and dry finish.

An easy drinking American Pale that could be a nice session beer, but isnt really hoppy or complex enough to make it a standout brew in any sense.

Almost smells like a hoppy tea with the hay-like sweetness of the malts in the bouqet. The taste is kind of buttery and sweet, kind of similar to a Fullers London Pride or Sam Smith's Pale.

The brewery promotes it as English-style, and to their credit it certainly wins enough medals when entered into competition as such. But Michael Jackson has called it an American-style pale ale, as have many others. It's amber colored body is a touch darker than what we might normally think of as American (although it certainly fits within the guidelines), but color alone does not make it English. The nose, however, does. The hops are decidedly floral and grassy, over some yeasty fruitiness and a lightly sweet malt base. It's medium-bodied with a standard carbonation (right @ 2.5 volumes CO2), and it's a bit airy and smooth across the palate. In the flavor, however, some more hop flavor is present than might be expected in an English version. Still, it's nicely malty with a wash of crystal malt character; and some delicate yeasty fruitiness rounds it out. But does it have the depth of malt character to make it truly English? That could be argued, but it's also fairly clean and straightforward like and American pale ale. But regardless of its designation, it's quite nicely balanced with malt, hop and yeast all present but distinct, and anchored by a solid but far from obtrusive bitterness. It finishes dry with some quickly fading malt and hop flavor, followed by some mold, lingering bitterness. Very well done!","NeroFiddled","Mar 07, 2005"

This beer is not quite sweet yet quite fruity & hoppy. It is very well balanced with a complimenting malty caramel note that accentuates the hops. This beer reminds me of candied orange peels, spruce tips. The hops nearly dance across my tongue with spicy herbal notes of pine and a nice bitterness that moves from the middle of my tongue to the back of my mouth as this beer passes down my gullet. This is just a really nicely made Pale Ale, it is actually even better than the IPA and IIPA from this brewery.","Gueuzedude","Jan 29, 2005"

Little complexity in the mouth, could be from the lack of carbonation. Nice hops and bitterness, strong flavor characteristics of an india pale ale. Label mentions it has won three medals for English Pale Ales yet this description above says its an American Pale Ale, what's the difference, does it just depend where it's brewed?

The flavor lingers in my mouth for an almost perfect amount of time, leaving me ready for another sip when it's finished. This is really tasty and almost too easy to drink.

Flavors are about the same, little more of a malt sided pale with a dull sweetness of toasty bread and a somber caramel blending within, midway brings in some slight fruity malts and hops, notes of dark orange, finishes nice with a complexing little display of hops, tame bitterness overall, leafy, woodish and floral hops with a super squeezed in piney bite and some tannic and metallic hints. Feel is about medium with a somewhat loosened slickness and creamyness. Finishes dry with a narrowing chalky texture. No real cohesiveness to its body, its just kinda there.

Like one of the previous reviewers, I too was expecting a little more hop character...so I was a little let down by that. The appearance and aroma were decent, but nothing spectacular, and if you can get past whatever taste was bothering me, I guess this beer is pretty drinkable.

Hop balance is good and leaves the floral impression slightly behind as there is a weak assertion of a juicy bit of citrus rind. Not piney at all. Not as aggresively hopped as many in the American style. Decent beer here, a little on the straight forward side for me to pick it up again.","ADR","Aug 24, 2003"

Flavor is a decent balance between bready, biscuity, somewhat caramel-tasting malt and some citric hops. Once again, not nearly as hopped-up as advertised, or maybe it's just me.

The creamy head was quick to dissipate, leaving even lacing and a mixture of fine foam and larger bubbles on the surface. The aroma was notably hoppy, but yeast was present as well. The malt lingered in the background in a rather light, almost tinny effect. With a watery mouth-feel, this highly-carbonated ale brought up the malt when the tongue was struck. The balance was pleasant and the hop bitterness gently bit upon a shallow-bodied swallow. This is a highly drinkable beer, with no objectionable qualities.
