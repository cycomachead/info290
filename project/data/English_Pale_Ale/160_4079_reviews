"A decent ale, but nothing special here."

"I guess this is no longer organic, some taste in there, corn & bitterness, had worse, especially from Wychwood"

"Overall: yet another 'quite nice but not really great' beer from Wychwood that commands AU$72 for a case of 12. The only really decent Wychwood beers I have had are King Goblin and Paddy's Tout, yet all of their range are massively expensive. I wouldn't compare them to Monteith's, since Wychwood don't have any particularly nasty beers, but I would certainly not suggest them to anyone looking for value-for-money in a brewery. I'll continue to have a single of each of their beers, but a case? Not a chance."

"O) Don't bother with this one, there are 30 better beers on the supermarket shelf."
"Not impressive scent. but smooth and nice colour. Because it has only 4.7% alcohol by volume, I can drink it in a smooth way. Even though it is a kind of pale ale, it is more like larger taste to me."

"Bottle poured into an English pub glass. On the light side of orange-amber, with quick breaking white head that dissolves into a halo of bubbles that ring the inside of the glass. Has a low key mellow aroma of lightly toasted malts (like shredded wheat cereal), dry herbal English hops, very subtle citrus peel (lemon and orange) ... I am inclined to compare this to the similar Fuller's Organic Honeydew and I think this compares favorably. The malt flavors are richer, the hops are quite floral and recall faint citrus and fragrant grass, and the finish is crisp, herbal, and slightly orchard fruity. The herbal flavors become more pronounced over time, almost a little sage or something, and the overall effect shifts from quite dry to sweet. There is a minor but noticeable metallic tang. I find these English blonde or summer ales to be a tad bland, and in my view these should not be lumped with other English pales. Aw well. This one probably ain't worth the price tag."

"Im just going to assume they call it scarecrow because it will scare you away from ever buying it again."
""
"Pours a hazy golden in color with a very thin white head. Some light spotty lacing is seen that settles back down the sides of the glass when sipped. The aroma is nothing really special actually just of some musty herbal grains. The taste is pretty close to the aroma with lots of malts up from followed by a slight bitter hoppy dry crisp finish. Medium bodied and medium carbonation. Overall, it was just OK and a once try brew for me. Not a big fan of the 'Pale Ale' types as they are all over the board with MOST in the very average range, like this one."

"Meets criteria for Brit pale ale. I prefer Yorkshire dark ales. I have noticed some skunkiness in other Wychwood light ales on draft in the UK."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Well rounded British ale. Good, not awesome, light and balanced, lightly hopped."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Like a real-life scarecrow, this may take the shape and appearance of a beer but it's all hollow inside. If the people at Wychwood had a brain they'd ditch this offering and put their reasonably talented brewer to better use - then again this is the same company that brought us Ginger Beard and Forest Fruits so I wouldn't bank on it."
""
""
"Final Thoughts: Go catch the mill, because it's running here. This is pretty much an average pale ale. No bells and whistles, nothing special. It makes me mourn for the passing of Fiddler's Elbow in Ontario."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Definitely recommended, as with all of their beers. It's nothing that's going to blow you away, but it's very tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Not great by any means, but pretty refreshing and decent for the style. For the price I have no reason to pick this one up again, but it was worth a try."
""
""
""
""
"Serving type: bottle (which is good!)"
""
"Final Grade: 3.49, a B-. I just can't find many things to say about Scarecrow Ale - good or bad. It's a relatively dull, clean-tasting blonde ale that I could see myself tossing back if there weren't already a bunch of cheaper alternatives. EPA is just a tough category to really stand out in; pale ales are inherently mundane. Fans of English-style hops and blonde ales will probably enjoy this one, but it's not going to be knocking a lot of socks off."
""
""
"Overall - Ok beer, but not anything i would purchase again. I find the grape flavors and sourness combining with the earthiness not to my liking and the mouthfeel isn't good enough to make up for that. Probably my least favorite Wychwood offering thus far."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with decent flavors and aromas."
""

"O: Overall a very good beer with much to offer to the palate. Great beer for the fall sitting around the fire...mmm."

"This brew has potential but failed to ""pop"" for me. The smell and taste reminded me more a an Oktoberfest style than an English Pale Ale. This brew is too light on the bitterness in order to be a Pale Ale. Otherwise it is drinkable."
""
""
"O: This beer is easy to drink; I found it tastes better after it warms up and the fruity and apple juice flavors subside a little."
"O: Tastes like a very traditional English ale, easy to drink. Definitely sessionable."
""
""
""
""
""
"Remarks: Did not score A, T, S, M at that time; disregard those scores"
""
"Pours a murky honey orange with a foamy off-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Thin rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, honey, fruit, and grassy aromas. Taste is much the same with grain, citrus, and herbal flavors on the finish. I am also getting a slight metallic taste as the beer warms up. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an average beer that is drinkable but a bit boring in my opinion."

"I suppose I'd get board after a few but that could be said about most English brews I've had. Worth a try and I'm a little surprised it has a pretty average rating"
""
""
"Pleasant enough, just pretty low key. Outside of the aroma, nothing really stands out. Very easy drinking, however. Probably a good session brew."
""
""

"I think folks miss the point here. While, yet, the hops are mostly absent, the body OK, the malt nothing to yak about, this brew is all about the yeast. It's bready in a marvelous way: like a freshly baked multi-grain loaf from a small, whole earth, bakery. I admit: clarity was low: yeast. Mouthfeel more yeast than malt. And the rest of the presentation not much to talk about. But savor the yeast, please. remember, if not for working wonders with yeast the Belgians might be considered 2nd rate brewers."
""
""
""
"Meh - no great shakes. Just a typical bland pale ale from one of the larger UK breweries. Aroma and flavour are dull and have unpleasant qualities. Little in the way of aromatic hops to add interest or depth. Could be too old; I may re-review if I have the chance. Mediocre fare - no need to seek this one out."
"A disappointment, particularly in the taste department."
""
""
""
"Amber coloured beer with a big white head which leaves some lacing on my pint glass. It has a slightly creamy nose with some dried fruit. Has a rich and fairly sweet fruity start with herbal hops emerging and creating a good bitter aftertaste. Nothing outlandish here but it is well balanced. Good but could be bolder."
""
""
""
"Overall: Not sure how excited you can get over an English pale ale This one just doesnt seem to be memorable or make you appreciate the flavors and malt content you expect from english hopped beers plus this one seems to lack the hop flavors for the style."
""
""
""
"It's crisp, and as much as a light ale of its kind should be. The body is what I expect. It is a little on the spritzy side with too little smoothness to carry it past that and give it much depth."
"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a snifter. White head, low retention, on a light golden/straw body. Almost clear, slick lacing. Aroma is lightly fruity, slightly biscuity, mild malt sweetness. Taste is a light balance between sweet and bitter, neither flavor standing out too much. Not too exciting on the flavor meter, but a solid English beer easy to approach and drink and not in the least off-putting."
""
""

"Part of a new 4 pack this one beer I have not seen in BC before. Lighter in colour which works with the golden pale ale style this is a very drinkable beer that has a full mouthfeel and a lovely bitterness that matches the solid malt backbone. The target hops are a good choice to bring this beer home on the finish. Good stuff"

"O: Not a very good ale. I should learn not to buy a product just based on the packaging!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is pretty tasty and pretty drinkable but I couldn't pick up anything else special."
""
"Overall, it's only slightly better than average and that's because the hoppiness never overpowers anything else. Pretty typical of an English pale ale."

"500ml bottle –nice flying witch engravings on the collar. ½ Pint glass. Enjoyed on jun´12. Golden amber color headed by white, medium bubbled, slowly dissipated froth. Some spotty lacing on sides. Herbal aromas with hints of honey & ripe persimmon to the nose. Mildy malts too. Crispy upfront, spicy bitter touch with subtle strawberry notes. Maltiness is carried on by a satiating mineralized underlying river followed by clean bitterness in the middle. Ripe apple texture. Medium to high body, medium to high carbonation. It was a hazy & lazy sunny day afternoon & I´d really enjoyed it very much."

"O: Not enjoyable and unimpressed. Such goes life...time to move on. It happens!"
""
""
"O: Uninteresting and unappealing. Traded the calories remaining in the glass for calories awaiting in the fridge. (READ: did not finish)"
""
"Not a poorly-rendered EPA, but something just seems off - always hinting at an astringency, without fully delving into one. I got a little bored, a little too fast, is all I'm sayin'."
"Golden straw colour when pour with a head that quickly disappears. Not very aromatic, reminiscint of a larger particular those in a dutch style. tastes slightly malty and fresh again making me feel more like i'm drinking a larger. short larger like aftertaste. a bit disappointed because I had heard good things about this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a very light copper color with minimal head retention. It's aroma is almost reminiscent of a euro lager, in a good way, with clean grain and a slight spicy hop aroma. The taste opens up with sweet malts on the forefront, followed by a hint of bittering hops to finish it. slightly sweet aftertaste but not too sweet. Overall this is a tasty beer, worth trying if you are in the mood for something mellow."
""
""
"A palatable organic take on the style, inoffensive with a decent crisp character to it."
"D- A drinkable brew, but nothing crazy for a pale ale, would not buy this one again."
"Wychwood Scarecrow technically shouldn't be lumped into one big English Pale Ale category, as this is a golden or summer ale. So this is a bit like having a lager with an ale flavor profile. Has a golden color with light brown overtones. A head that quickly fizzles out, though the overall taste of carbonation keeps it from feeling flat. Nice herbal aroma with some malt in the nose as well. What I like most about the flavor is it has a little bit of esthery apple. Light English hops. Crisp. The mouthfeel is not big and malty, so you might enjoy this in warm, fair weather. I do recommend it. It's organic; that counts for something. I've also had the Fiddler's Elbow, although that tasted as it it'd been sitting on the shelf way too long. Scarecrow is a common sight on Long Island - certainly AOK in my book. St. Peter's Golden Ale might be a more exciting example of the style, if you can find a fresh batch."
""
"Overall - Avoid it, there are many better organic beers out there"
""
""
""

"Overall, I seem to like this a bit more than the rest of BA, and then again I only read like 7 reviews of it. The hoppiness is what I expect of an ale but its less than that of an APA or IPA which is good because its not either of those things. Its smell and flavor make it overall to be a great beer. When ur not in the mood for a strong stout or IPA or APA, and more for a pale ale this one is a good one to try. It was on the shelf among 2 other Halloween themed beers, so Im not sure if this beer is just for Halloween or not. Either way its delicious in December."

"O - I wouldn't mind not ever having this again."
""
"Overall / Drinkability: Well, the bitter hop focus of this beer isn't exactly to my liking, but it's not bad. Just not great either. Good appearance, and sadly that's about all I can really say for this beer. There are better golden and English Pale Ales out there."
""
"O: A very mediocre effort, and the only beer from Wychwood that I have ever viewed as a disappointment. Unremarkable in almost every way."
"A good fresh pale ale. I would by this again."
"This beer gets much worse reviews than I'd imagine. I wonder how much of it has to do with the organic growing process. I have no idea how that would affect the final outcome of the beer but there really aren't that many organic beers on the market at the moment so I'd imagine, like organic wine making, the art of organic beer making probably has a way to go to develop."
"It was another gentle pour on my part so as not to stir up too much sediment. No head, but only simple wisps as a result. Color was a deep amber with NE-quality clarity. BUPGOO! Nose was quite malty, somewhat buttery with a light underlying grassiness. Mouthfeel was medium and it had a pleasant intermingling of grassy hops and a light sweetness on the tongue. Finish was semi-dry and fairly unobtrusive."
"overall - for me this is just below average, has nothing that really stands out, personally i would avoid this, there is just too little to it to make you want more."
"Overall: I'm not wild about the hop flavors in this one and they seem to dominate the beer. I wouldn't turn it down, but I don't think I will seek out a lot more."
"Overall: Truly forgettable; the best part of the beer is the label"
"Drink- For a birthday gift its the thought that counts. Ive always wondered about these beers so glad I got to try and not waste the cash."
"D: Too bitter without a good floral or citrus hop note. I would not get this beer ever again or recommend it to anyone."
"From fall brew tasting notes (2010): Pale golden pour. Thin, fast fading white head. The nose has a little bit of crackery pale malt character. There is a little bit of fruit and an oddly perceptible alcoholic nose. The flavor is fairly fruity however with a lingering estery character. The body is quite thin with mild carbonation. Not very happy with this one."
"This beer is pretty good up until you drink it. Appearance and smell are average to good but the taste is lacking in all areas. I almost hated it at first, but decided that it's not bad just not for me at all. My little disclaimer though is that I live in the Midwest in the U.S. so with no dates on the bottle who knows how long it sat on the shelves before I purchased it. That being said I will try it again; making sure that I ask when the beer was stocked. Good beer Wychwood Brewery."
"Well balanced brew, nothing too strong, different, interesting or overpoweringly brilliant, but a good steady beer in my eyes."
"D - Decent enough, would work as its own or as a session, but there are other better examples around of the style."
"OVERALL- about as close to a decent cask bitter as you're going to get at home, very drinkable, refreshing, I'm a fan"
"Poured from a bottle, the beer is a golden color with a tinge of copper with minimal head that clung around the edges. The beer has a sour, malty smell to it. It has a strong sour taste for a pale, with typical matly flavors. The sourness trails through to the finish and the aftertaste, along with a bittersweet flavor at the tip of the tongue. This is one of my first English Pales, and there are some distinct differences between that and US Pales. I look forward to trying more to expand my palate, and then maybe coming back to review this again."
"D- very drinkable, sessionable, but would I choose to if I could reach for a Sierra Nevada, Summit, or other inexpensive pale ale? Nah."
"D: Could use a little more oomph for me. I could have a few though on a fall day."
"D: I'd take it over a Bud any day. Seems like a decent summer beer."
"D: Rather disappointing considering my other experiences with Wychwood. Not a *bad* beer, but not something I'll be drinking again."
"Well, this is another completely average beer. There's really no reason to seek it out, but it's not really doing much wrong. It's one of the few organic beers I've seen, so if the organic label mattered to someone, I'd pick it up. Otherwise, not worth it."
"From the 500 ml. bottle marked DNO-07:25. Sampled on October 26, 2010. It pours a hazy golden yellow with a thin but long lasting head. The aroma has a burst of yeast, malts, and relatively weak hops. The body is on the thin side. The taste is crisp and clean enough but not very memorable except for the light yeast elements. But the finish is dry."
"D: Easily a session beer, but the blandness leads you not to drink more than one."
"This one unfortunately is really lacking in the taste department. It's a bit shocking given its heritage, packaging and style. Seems like it should be a lot more than it is."
"So the label had this crazy looking demon scarecrow on it, so I went against my predisposition to avoid non-American beers and purchased this organic British brew. Basically, it tasted like Coors with a hint of bitter. I was unimpressed and will not buy this again. The beer's best attribute was the marketing behind it. Awesome label art, awesome name, subpar flavor."
"D- I had one and that's all I think I could do. Not that I couldn't take it down but it certainly didn't leave me wanting more"
"D: There is some nasty aftertaste in this beer, especially 30 seconds to a minute after taking a sip, it gets worse as time goes on-- supposedly the beer is organic; but the taste is reminiscent of chemicals or something gross..."
"Drinkability: The taste is a little unusual, however they go down pretty well. Had no trouble finishing the 500mL bottle, but I dont really want another one."
"D: I still haven't had an organic beer that was any good... The weakest part of this beer is the taste."
"Drinkability - it's not horrible but worth a try"
"Drinkability : an average beer in the style English Pale Ale."
"No, this beer was not for me. Some bitterness and earthiness I did not like."
"Really, there's not much else to say. Obviously, it was meant to be light, but that doesn't necessarily mean bland in my mind, which this is. And I can't see this being much better from a cask."
"D - This is only an okay ale. It just doesn't taste that good."
"Couldn't finish more than a third of the bottle. Down the drain."
"Scarecrow pours a golden orange color with a half-inch of white head. The smell is malty with a little sweetness and some breadlike notes. The taste is a bit sweet with the maltiness, no hoppy qualities are evident. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied. The beer is drinkable enough, but I don't think I will seek it out in the future."
"This is an English ale through and through. I love English ales. This is no exception."
"Overall I'm not impressed. Not a bad beer but one I won't return to anytime soon."
"D: A very nice English Pale Ale--I'd like to see more of these Stateside."
"I enjoy this beer but would not search for it in a sea of beers."
"not a bad beer, but definitely not worth the price as i can get a ton of better pale ales for cheaper."
"Extremely boring beer. Golden in color, with a quick-fading head. Taste is extremely watery and malty. Not a beer I would recommend to any but the most conservative beer drinkers. It doesn't taste bad; it's simply not good either. In a word - boring."
"this beer pours a hazy golden color with a small white head that fades to a layer of lace. the smell is a bit off, but still recognizabley malty. the taste is unremarkable, light malt. light mouthfeel, adequate carbonation... not one that I'm going to look for again... disapointing after the fiddlers elbow."
"Drank a bottle of this last night. Pours a golden, amber color with little head or lacing. Hints of corn in the nose. Well-balanced taste, corn and malty ... pretty refreshing. Good drinkability - easy to drink more than one. I thought this beer was refreshing and enjoyable. Glad I tried it out."
"Pours a clear golden color with very little head. Faint sweet aroma. Flavor is a bit bland and a touch soapy. Not a lot of flavor at all. Mouth feel is medium to thin, with nearly non-existent carbonation. Overall, not terrible, but nothing here to make we want more of it."
"Hazy orange with thin rapidly dissipating white head. Very mild orange citrus and hops aroma. Mouthfeel and taste are very thin and watery. Throughly underwhelmed. There are some hops flavors trying to break through but nothing exception. Reminds me of the BMC versions of microbrews. Fairly drinkable due to its inoffensive (albeit) tame nature."
"D- In hot weather, I could drink this all day. It's kindof like a stronger (higher ABV) ESP. Sweet enough to feel like a restorative, dry enough to make me want to drink more, and light enough so that it doesn't feel like ""too much""."
"D- I can't understand why people rate this so poorly, in my opinion its one of the best golden pale ale's I've had. I guess many people are just use to pesticides in their beers. I'll definatly be coming back for more of this stuff. Great beer. Give it a chance!"
"Drinkability: Alright, but not spectacular. If my review seems slightly unenthusiastic it's because that's what the beer left me feeling. Definitely are better examples of EPAs, and this one left me wanting more. Good thing there were better things coming on the night."
"D- i've been out in the hot ohio sun for the last 4 hours and this shit ROCKS. maybe i'm partial to english beers, but i don't know why the hell everyone is sleepin on scarecrow/circle master. maybe you all shoulda got the brown bottle! haha! at any rate i WILL bee seeking out a case of this stuff as soon as i locate the distributor who carries it..."
"D: Undrinkable."
"D- Moderately high. This beer isn't strong or flavorful, but it has a very nice subdued flavor that plays on it's carbonation and hops bitterness. Goes well with food. This beer isn't really my bag, but I 'get' what they're working in this beer. Still, wouldn't go out of my way to get one of these."
"Pours a crystal clear orange gold color with a fluffy off white head that dies down rather quickly. There are earthy hop and malt aromas. The initial flavor is of malt and the is overcome by the earthy hop flavor and bitterness. The bitterness is pretty strong in the beer and doesn't stop for a while. I would rather have more hop flavor and less bitter bite. The mouthfeel is somewhat watery. The beer is ok, but I probably won't have another one of these."
"No thanks with all the beers I have access to this is not something I could see myself paying for again. If someone had it and handed to me i would more than likely drink it tho"
"Overall, an easy-drinking beer but nothing that's really going to impress anybody."
"D: This was OK to me, but nothing more. There wasn't anything really special going on, but it was easy enough to quaff."
"The taste is very fresh, with bread, lemon, apple, a dryish, leafy finish. It has nice bitter-sweet balance. It's light, a little thin and one-dimensional, but solid and flaovurful as a lighter, refreshing beer."
"Drinkable but the taste is a bit off for my American taste buds. I wouldn't buy this again."
"other than the lack of carbonation it was on for style. may try again."
"Decent atmosphere. A little complexity in the nose and palette. Light, but full flavored. Overall, good quality quaff."
"The phrase ""not bad"" comes to mind. It seems like the basics are all present, and if they were just a but more pronounced/developed, this would be a higher-than-average beer. As it stands, it's still a pretty good session beer and is by no means terrible. I just wish it were slightly more robust. The feel of it reminded me of some good German lagers, which I found strangely appealing. Worth trying once."
"Overall - I am having a hard time findng anything to say about this beer. It is not bad, but does not stand out either."
"Pours a somewhat clear amber colored body. Very small whitish creamy head, quickly diminishing. Sweet spiciness in the taste, sweet and malty. Very malty tasting, some nuttiness and dustiness. Some slight sweetness. Lightly carbonated."
"Very cloudy and translucent amber orange color, lightens to the color of yellow autumnal leaves around the rims, minimal head. No real nose. Full-bodied with lots of traction on the palate, inching forward very slowly, if seemingly at times, not at all. However, no lift really. Mildly bitter, emphasizing hops, with strong aftertaste. Does feel as if it is foaming up in the mouth more than you'd like. Momentarily suggests light citrus or crudité vegetables or raw corn, latter in a good way. Feels as if it's fighting you, making it hard to put back."
"Certified usda organic. Huh! I crack this bottle open to clean out the cooler at my package store. Pours a light amber with minimal head. The smell does not impress at all, almost no hop aroma maybe some honey notes in there. Taste slightly bitter with afore mentioned honey, but watered down. Mouthfeel was very light and carbonated. Could drink plenty but why would I?"
"Overall - The aftertaste of the brew was not good. It tastes as though the bottle may have been slightly skunked or on its way."
"D - Average beer, not something I would actively seek"
"This poured a hazy copper with a bit of light tan head. It smelled like orange and sweet yeast and raw honey, with herbal tea notes. It tasted like honey malt, and lemon and orange hops, with a bit of earthy barley and creamy yeast. It was watery with some carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste. Overall this had decent flavor, but was a little muddled. It had decent body too, and was easy enough to drink. But it wasn't very rewarding or unique."
"Drinkability: If I would have had a sixer, they would've all been gone shortly after writing my review. Scarecrow was definitely a pleasant surprise. Nice!!!"
"Drinkability - very sessionable, Halloween weekend or any other for that matter."
"Just in time for Halloween! Aroma is malty and fruity, not strong but quite noticeable. Color is a clear dark amber, and head is yellowish off-white and not too persistent. Flavor is malty with a crisp hint of lager flavor and just a whisper of fruit, either apple or pear. Texture is nice and smooth, and aftertaste has a nice crisp tang to it."
"A drinkable session brew. However, this is nothing exciting."
"This is a very average beer. Not anywhere near worth the premium price they charge for it."
"Overall, a decent pale ale. The malt profile is a bit one-dimensional but I don't think that should be held against it. It's an easy drinking, smooth pale ale that is nice and sessionable; something to sit back and relax with and not worry about."
"Drinkibility is high, this beer comes off as a specialized, more robust and complex alternative to your average light lager. A little pricey for me, but definitely a refreshing yet simple, high quality ale."
"Mild complexity."
"D: This is a wholly average beer. Not really interesting in any way. Can't recommend it."
"D- Leaves too much sweet aftertaste to drink more than a couple. Didn't really care for this one."
"A smooth beer with low carbonation that goes down easily."
"D- Not terrible not super just plain average."
"taste is watery yet crisp, funky, corn, sweet malt, some hops in the back, a little metallic, touch of citrus, grassy."
"Probably would not have again..."
"Superb drinkability and a medium-light body make this beer very refreshing."
"Not a bad beer, not great either. The beer pours a slightly cloudy golden amber with a white creamy head, some lacing with this beer, decent retention as well. The smell is musty grain, pretty traditional malts. The taste is a bit sweetish, some sweet buiscuity grains, there are some stale floral notes to the beer, a bit of a bitterish hop bite in the finish. The beer is crisp, light to medium bodied, some carbonation. There is a sharpness to the beer in the finish that I'm not fond of and some off sour notes in there as well. There is some husky grain flavors to the beer but it lacks the creaminess to be a really good English Pale Ale. The beer isn't terribly interesting, but it's not that bad either."
"My least favorite Wychwood beer. Something seems really off with the taste. Will pass on this next time, in favor of better Wychwood ales."
"Tastes exactly like it smells (grass, pale malts). Another middle of the pack beer."
"D: I guess I would take this over a bud light, but it had that macro taste to me. Nothing special. I would drink it, but I wouldn't pay for it."
"I decided to pour this beer into a Heavy Seas Euro style pint glass. What came out of the bottle was a beer that was a lightly hazy golden orange with a thin white bubbly head of foam. This head of foam quickly dissipated into a handful of white rings along the edge. It didn't bother to leave any lace. The aroma was light with lightly toasted malts, tea leaves, a small splash of juicy fruits, and the slightest touch of sweet English toffee at the end. For some stuipd reason, the main taste is this beer was carbonation. Most of the time the taste was mostly carbonation with toasted organic barley, caramel, tea leaves, and a pinch of very mild not too hoppy fruity hops. The mouthfeel was too light with a tiny aftertaste of juicy fruits, a trace of yeast, and some lightly burnt barley. I guess that since all the ingredients in this beer are organic, that means it's better for you than your average beer. It's good that it's organic, but the bad thing is that there wasn't much of anything to this beer. I would pass on this one again."
"D - Easy to drink but there are better EPA out there."
"The beer poured a golden copper color with bubbly white head and really nice lacing. The aroma was of wet dog. Weird. The last beer I had smelled similar. The taste was the same as the aroma and was wet dog. Not good. The mouthfeel was a medium body with medium carbonation. Overall I did not like this beer. I will need to give it a try again in the fall when I can get a fresh bottle."
"Def NOT a good Golden Pale Ale"
"D: I didn't like this beer and it was honestly difficult to keep drinking it, except for the fact that I paid for it."
"d: not very different from a macro lager and a lot more expensive so i wouldn't go out of my way or drink it again"
"D - Not a lot. I for one can't afford or want to drink this beer. It was $3.99 for a twelve ounce bottle. Nothing special."
"Drinkability: This is a very drinkable Ale. Light enough on the stomach to be a good session choice and is good nearly all around, and the organic bit helps a little too. Now if they only had this in a six pack..."
"Brilliantly clear, dark gold with a medium white head that lingers well. Aroma is butterscotch backed by esters and earthy UK hops. Some hints of fusel. Esters and butterscotch follow through in the flavor, which is backed by a pretty decent malt and crystal character. Tail is a bit dry, along with more butterscotch and some nice crystal malt. Definitely much better since they went to brown bottles!"
"Kind of the same thing as the Dark English Ale (I tried them back to back). It drops off your palate pretty fast and you are left with virtually nothing after a very short flow of taste. Even the fact that it is a USDA Organic brew doesn't help at all with it."
"I continue to be pleased by offerings from the Wychwood company... My third beer that I've sampled from this establishment, and I was very impressed by this one... From a 16.9 oz bottle, poured a golden amber color that resembles a hefe-weizen... A nice looking brew with a sharp, tangy, and citrusy aroma to match... taste was great, similar to a hefe or a witbier, with its distinct floral and fruity notes, without the yeast... Bottle says this is an organic ale, and the exceptional flavor can clearly live up to that claim... A great beer that is easily drinkable and goes down very smooth... not at all bitter... one I would enjoy any time... too bad its not available in six-packs... certainly recommended..."
"Overall drinkablity for me is low. I have another bottle of this that I'll drink, but I don't think I'll buy one again. I felt slightly sick after drinking it and although it could have been from something else, I can't shake the feeling that the Scarecrow here was responsible. Try it, you might like it, but probably not."
"/end rant"
"Drinkability- I love the organic thing but there are better beers for the money."
"Drinkability: Decent pale ale. Refreshing and crisp."
"D - I think this beer had a pretty good taste and is pretty smooth so I think that it could be a session beer worth a try"
"Drinkability: Gulpable"
"D - I could have a few, but I would probably get bored after three or four. Overall nothing spectacular, but certainly a decent brew."
"Just like the Hobgoblin ale, I bought this on a whim to try something different and because I liked the label art. Unfortunately, it wasn't as good as it's brew-brother. I'll be the first to admit that I am not a fan of pale ales, although I'll try them in the hopes I'll find one I like, but even when compared to others, this one was not very good. Overall it was average, but it was much to bitter with a very odd after taste."
"Nice body, and flavor more characteristic of an ESB then a pale. The head did fade fast. Gorgeous amber color that gets me excited about the flavor, and subtle hop nose. Nice stoney finish with pleasant aftertaste. Overall an easy beer to drink in large volumes."
"A light amber color with a bubbly medium sized head that dies and reasonable lacing. The aroma is whimpy, of yeast, pumpkin/squash. The taste first strikes me as watery and has a grapefruit introduction that is a bit tart and bready but is generally pretty weak. It's easy enough to drink but there is little motivation. Disappointing compared to Wychwood's other work."
"a light golden color , active carbonation in a short lasting head with not much lacing to speak of . About half way through the smell hit me as that of low tide at the beach. really didn't care much for this selection, not much personality unless you can appreciate a german style pils with the typical skunkiness, just not for me."
"Overall, a decent and drinkable English PA. I suspect that this one would be quite nice to enjoy on cask."
"Overall: Another decent but wholly unremarkable English pale. Worth a try."
"The herbal hop taste of Scarcrow Golden Pale Ale is probably its most appealing taste characteristic and this is the flavor I kept noticing as I took each sip. The herbal taste comes in the finish and it keeps you guessing. It isn't like the hop flavor present in most other pale ale, i.e, the strong citrus taste or the strongly earthy taste or something else common to this style. It is a little different. But other than the herbs, there really isn't anything else great to say about Scarecrow Golden Pale Ale. It's a very middle of the road pale ale that is a little too watery for my tastes and too skunky."
"D: Another standard pint to have if I'm overseas. I'd probably reach for something with more body as this doesn't stand out from the crowd. Probably would be better on draft in a pub."
"D - Not so good. It is harsh and drying, I am going to struggle to get through this pint. It is not something I would want to continually drink."
"The pour revealed weak head with minimal lacing. The color is a straw yellow which is suited for a beer called Scarecrow. It's crystal clear with no sediment and bubbling carbination. Aroma is of a light malt that's not too complex and a little fruity. The taste has a little bit of hops and a slight bitter finish that lingers. It has a light body and a decent mouthfeel but a bit watery. It could use more carbination. It's below average in about every catagory. Weak ABV. It should not offend the lightest of beer drinkers. Overall, I probably would not try it again."
" This brew comes back in full with its abundance of mellow flavors that carmelize on the back of your tongue. Alot of earthey, buiscut flavors are evident. I found this ale to finish a little dry in the end but, I would have to say that it is an enjoyable brew that, I will have again."
"Drinkability- It's worth trying, but not something I would really reccomend. Nothing seriously wrong with it, it just isn't outstanding in anyway."
"This easy-drinking organic brew is a thirst-quencher with a refreshing dryness in the finish. It makes for a fine ""session"" ale. This was from a 550 ml bottle - I'd like to find 6-packs of this one."
"I like this Ale, and of the two Wychwood beers I've sampled (Fiddler's Elbow being the other), I enjoy this one more."
"D: I've liked other offerings from Wychwood, but i'll pass on this one in the future, thank you very much."
"Quite nice. Refreshing and satiating, but not over-filling or abusive to the palate - just a great session ale! Well worth trying."
"Easily drinkable, mellow, mild, satisfying."
"Drinkability: Not bad, but either mis-classified or not to-style, in my opinion."
"M - Fairly medium-light bodied and low carbonation."
"Drink-Ability: For nearly 3.50$ I dont really recommend this beer. Im not the biggest fan of English pale ales though so its ether a hit or miss hear for you. I do believe that it will get a little more recognition now that it is not in the clear bottle and in the brown."
"This beer poured a cloudy golden with a small head. It had a slightly fruity smell that had a hint of hop aroma. The taste was bitter and high in hops. The mouthfeel was a little thin, some carbonation made it interesting, but nothing outstanding. The drinkability was fair but a bit bitter for long sessions."
"Notes: One and done. Another English Pale that is completely unimpressive and boring. The only thing of interest was the smell but it ends there as not much from the nose comes through when the rubber hits the road. Oh, and the bottles that I've seen around are now brown and they are advertising this brew as organic. Neato."
"Opinion: This is an OK beer. It drinks pretty well with the light body and mild flavor, but there isn't much to make you go ""WOW!, I really want to have another one of those!"" It is not bad, so don't get me wrong. There just isn't all that much going for this beer. I would recommend any number of EPA's over this one."
"Unusual aroma/taste, they seem to contradict each other. The weak body dooms this brew. Oh, well."
"Poured from the bottle to a golden orange color and thick white head that turned into good lacing. Unfortunately, the appearance was the high point. Aroma at first was floral and grassy hops. However, the mmore of the beer I had, the less aroma there was. Never did taste the maltiness they describe , and the flavor was really devoid of much taste. Finish was dry and metallic, and forutnately diminished very quickly. Cute name and label....not much to say about the beer."
"Poured from a 500ml bottle (now dark brown - earlier reviews mention old clear bottle) with no freshness date. Had a golden color with decent head and tons of carbonation. Really didn't have much of a smell, little hoppy. The taste was very bland and mouthfeel was very watery. Unless I had a bad sample, this is not worth having again or recommending. (2, NA, ML, N)"
"This turned out not to be as bad as anticipated, but that's not saying much. Would I ever try it again? Probably not."
"From the label: ""Organic imported golden pale ale."" Scarecrow Ale pours a light golden color with a minimal white head from a clear bottle which oddly enough did not appear to have an easily discernible size marked on it. Light for the style, nothing particularly exciting, just kind of average. Worth a try."
"Decent, but predictable beer. Typicall English in a very sweet, heavy malt kinda way. Held away from cloying by hop flavor (herbally). Hops show modestly in the aroma, but round out the flavor. Hops add very little bittering to the bigger malt base. Ripe fruits and a light vegetal flavor emerge near the finish. A little slick on the toung (buttery). It's worth drinking, but I'm getting bored with a lot of these English brews. Light, refreshing, but a little weak in the finish. Easy to drink, but tough to appreciate."
"I tried this one from a bottle. Pours a light yellow with a head that is quick to disappear. I noted a little honey, with maybe some grapefruit in the nose. The feeling on the palate was okay, with a slight bitter finish. Yet, this is balanced and refreshing. There is nothing extraordinary about this one, but nothing awful. Just average."
"-SS"
"this was alright. it is usda certified organic, which is good if you're into that."
"Bottom line: I like a lot of UK brews and appreciate the fact that they can make a flavourful beer with rather low abv %s but..this is one that I won't make a habit of buying. I'll blame the hops. :^("
"Had this at a beer and cheese tasting. It was paired with Lord of the Hundreds - Sussex - Raw Ewe's milk cheese. Decent enough beer with a nice floral hop aroma. Not a whole lot of malt in the aroma or the taste. Nothing really makes this stand out as an ESB. My gold standard for this style is Fuller's ESB on cask - in London."
"Overall: What possessed me to event think this would be worth a try? Well I guess I was fooled by the brown bottle. It just goes to show that not all crap skunky beer comes in clear glass bottles!!! A big miss."
"Presentation: Packaged in a custom clear glass half-liter bottle with a pop-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"This is one of the last beers I need to try before finishing a Beer Club at a local BeerFly place. I thought this may be more like an American Pale Ale but I was wrong. Light golden color, no head, almost like a macro lager with just a little bit more hopes to it. Cool bottle, but that's about all."
"Drinkability: If it were a warmer day, this could be a nice session beer, but I think the lemony sweetness would get old after a few of them."
"Poured into a standard pint glass from a unique, and attractive bottle ... though the bottle is clear. Why would they bottle in a clear container, I ask myself. Appears as a yellow color with a mediocre head and considerable lacing. Smells more hoppy than malty. Tastes of unidentifyable hops, with a malt accent. A bit watery and a poor metallic taste. Flat, not in carbonation but in taste. Really quite dry and light in body. I didn't really think much of this one to be forthright. It's 'ok' at best, and not a good representation of the style. Nothin horrible here, but nothing good either."
"Poured a golden color with a touch of haze and fluffy white head. Did not have much of a scent, mostly a very faint, delicate hops aroma. Taste was very bland and did not have much complexity. Slightly dry on the tongue with not much else going on. Nothing in this beer that makes me want to come back for more, but it is harmless enough that it does not completely turn you off from drinking it."
"Pours a slightly hazed dark gold. Soapy one finger head will fizzle out and leave little to no lace. Weak scent of ester and corn, but not much malt or hops. Sweet pale malt and wheat flavor upfront, with ester and butterscotch in the back. Aftertaste is a touch dry, with a decenlt balanced tea-like hops. Thin body and low carbonation are smooth, but the drinkability is tainted by the diacetyl that sets in the finish. A slick mouthfeel may be appropriate for the style, but its still a bit pricey for overall quality."
"A thankful gift to me that I would consider a nice summer refresher for the light lager crowd. A little too simple for my taste, thats all."
"Body barely above light with a coarse, grainy mouthfeel and a thin, watery texture. A definate drainpour. Deja vu!"
"Drinkability... just not that good. I didn't really come away from the experience with much in the way of good memories, just a wish I had spent my money on something else."
" -cheers2beers-"
"Pours a pale yellow color and has a nice white head. There is not much to speak of on the nose, but a faint floral hoppiness can be found. It's flavor is very subtle... the malt is a bit thin, but it has a nice hoppiness that is not overwhelming. In line with most BPAs... Not a Fuller or Youngs, but better than a Bass. Either way it is quite drinkable, but $2.50 a bottle is a bit of a deterrent for any pale ale."
"Another exceptionally poor showing from Wychwood."
"I intentionally stayed away from all Wychwood products (after Hobgoblin) until they jettisoned the clear glass in favor of brown. When protected from UV light, these guys brew decent beer. Scarecrow Ale, the North American name for Circle Master, may not be stupendous, but it's a worthwhile English pale ale and is a beer that I just might pick up again."
"Medium bodied, decently easy to drink if you like the sourness."
"Medium to light bodied with lower carbonation. Pretty run of the mill English ale, maybe slightly above average. I prefer others, but this is not bad at all. Perhaps would function well as a crossover beer."
"The taste was citrusy and pungent, but more subtle. Very light. I imagine this would be lovely with a light cheese or other light foods. Mouthfeel is bubbly and light, refreshing and smooth. Drinkability is pretty good except I can see the sourness getting to you after a while- but I enjoyed this beer way more than I thought I would considering the previous reviews. Maybe they had bad bottles? Oh well, I enjoyed it."
"Don't let the scarecrow scare you away."
"Overall, the mouthfeel is pleasant,a nd this is one that goes down nice and easy. Not bad!"
"Overall Impression: Be afraid, be very afraid! The transit from England hasnt been pretty. I found this beer to be a fairly good EPA that had been slowly destroyed by light leaving it to be a skunked heap. Note to the British brewers, we have developed brown bottles, they protect beer, please use them."
"Two inches of cream-colored head sit on a clear, gold beer. Just a hint of amber. There's some nice, musky spoonk in the nose. Sugar and nuts and malt. The front is fruity and nutty. Middle is smooth, almost oily. A little milky. Finish is sharp, bitter, nutty, fresh. It's not bad. Fresh, nutty, bitter. Almost lagery."
"poured a clear golden color with a light white head that faded to a skim. skunky grassy aroma with a bit of sweet malt in background. well carbonated with a light taste and mouthfeel. has a lingering skunky taste to it and a bit spicy. light malt character coming through in the taste with some caramel coming through in the finish."
"A fairly typical English ale, quite drinkable."
"Clear golden appearance, very white but very thin head is lost in 40 seconds. Laces in simple and almost complete rings. Catty aroma is pretty noticeable from a foot away, while the subject of green and clear glass is way overhyped, this does seem to be a light issue here. Body is shy of medium, the carbonation is actually pretty well done for the ABV. Hops and malt strike a decent if unremarkable balance, honeyish, but the skunkiness turns an initially average flavor into something that reminds me of milkweed. To try to reconstruct this brew in its original sense isn't a big deal, smooth and with a Bitter's balance, but probably really pedestrian."
"I took a few sips just to have an idea of what it tasted like. simple, slightly malty. Not much to get exited about. Might have been much more drinkable in a brown bottle."
"$3.33 down the drain...skip this one"
"I've had this beer at a tasting, fresh out of sealed boxes, never exposed to light and that was a different experience than what I have in front of me. The first thing to realize about this beer is that it comes in a clear bottle, so anything on the shelf for any amount of time is going to be tarnished with the exposure to light. After taking off the cap, the first scent I get is the typical skunky/Grolschy smell I associate with a beer gone bad. The beer is a pretty light golden yellow color without much of a head even after trying to make it happen. The nose, besides the skunk, has some sweet malts hiding along with a metallic smell. Not what I want in a beer of any type. The flavor is MUCH better than the smell, though there is a metallic tinge that detracts. There is a nice sweet start and hops that dance on my tonge after swallowing the beer. Not a bad offering. The beer is a little thin for my liking. The drinkability is not as high as I would expect from a nice light beer. I don't know if I can find this on tap or fresh out of a box again, but that is the only way I would want to re-sample."
"This baby looks better than it tastes...but not by much! It pours a hazy golden/orange with just a trace of head and some lace, though marginal. Aromas hint of sticky sweet hop, and mild malt, with a kiss of skunk for good measure. In the mouth the beer provides the taster more sticky sweet hop flavors and an underlying flavor of fennel/licorice. The beer finishes in an uninspiring cloying fashion. I won't bother finishing this one, I'll save the belly space."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Poured out with no head, teensy bit of large bubbles on the side only. A little cloudy, the color of apple juice. Smells intensely like styrian hops to speak nicely, smells skunky to not speak nicely. Taste of very earthy tones. The styrian hop flavor is just too intense in this brew -I am just not a fan of them so maybe I just can't get over that...?"
"Drinkable but not really good to drink. I can't recommend that you buy this stuff."
"On the whole, this was a disappointment."
"It is a yellow golden color with not much of a head. It is hust average to look at and it doesn ot get any better from there. The aroma is not strong, but it sort of reminds me of lemon iced tea. The maltiness is not extensive, which is good because it is no too hoppy. It is well balanced, but lacks depth and complexity. It is refreshing, but there are many better English Pale Ales available."
"Scarecrow Ale was a light gold color. The aroma was grainy and unremarkable. The taste was undistinguished, mostly grainy with some sweetness and a bit of citrus. Carbonation was good, but the overall mouth feel was not. The finish was slightly dry. To me this beer seemed to be more like a pilsner than a golden ale. Best points were the use of organically grown hops and malt and the label."
"Pours a golden yellow with a thin white head and sinks back within a minute or so to form a lazy lace on the top of the beer. Smell is earth robust hops, bit of pale malts hiding back ther as well. Bitter astringency dominates the taste. The hops are predominant, but it just doesn't quite taste right. It gets more drinkable after every sip, though, and sweet honey flavors step through once your taste buds adjust. By the third sip, you think it isn't so bad, just a bit thin in the mouthfeel. Would not make a bad session beer, but would not make a good one, either."
"All I can say is that the bottle and label are certainly the high points of this ale. The appearance wasn't bad, golden, thick head, big bubbles that disappeared rather quickly. Lacing was scant and also disappeared. The smell was hops and skunk, with the skunk being more prevalent. Not to my liking at all. The taste was a bit hoppy, grains and watery/alcolhol. But I still couldn't get over the skunk aroma enough to try to enjoy it. Mouthfeel was thin and watery also. Drinkability was hampered by the bad smell and so so taste. I don't know if the skunked aroma was inherent to the product or if I happened to get a bad bottle. If it was the latter than I would say this beer wasn't horrible, just nothing great, barely a step above domestic macros. If however it wasn't a bad bottle and that skunkiness is normal, then it's a whole different ball game."
"Ho-Hum. Yawn."
"I'm quite disappointed with this one, since I'd loved RobBeer's Hobgoblin shirt (""What's the matter, lagerboy? Afraid you might taste something?""), and that's why I purchased this one, but I just can't recommend it. Not good, and one I won't have again."
"Sorry, but looks are deceiving. You'll buy the beer because it looks cool, but after you start drinking it, you'll realise it's not that good. pat"
"This one pours a yellow color and has a decent sized white head and leaves some lacing on the glass. The aroma is not too exciting - just malts and some yeast. The flavor was slightly skunky - possibly due to the clear bottle. Mostly the flavor was comprised of pale malts and a tiny bit of hops, but not much else. I didn't care much for this one, but I might try it again if I can find it on tap somewhere."
"The fact that this is an organic ale (and definitely light-stuck) does nothing for me. It's worth a try I suppose, but something I would not purchase regularly."
"Sinkability  This British skunkorama is dedicated to the porcelain Gods."
"Not impressive."
"This organic ale pours a shiny gold. A nice white head of various sized bubbles lasts a fairly long time and leaves a thin-rimmed coating and a good amount of lace. The aroma is mostly a doughy malt with a fair amount of hops. Being that this ale is bottled in clear glass, I expect it would have become skunky had I stored it a bit longer. A lightly sweet malt blends well with tea-like and citrusy hops. A faint taste of pears can be detected. I like this beer, but because there's no freshness date, I'll only buy it from reputable packies."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick frothy white head. The aroma is simple; pale malts and yeast. The taste is much the same; very plain, no malt character, bitter, and quite dry. The mouthfeel sucks. It's a light bodied beer, but the carbonation is way too low. This was a hard drink. One and done for me."
"I could have a dozen of these. Eminently drinkable."
"I'll also note, and I could be wrong, but I think they just changed the bottling of these beers to a smoother more rounded bottle, but its still clear--maybe they didn't get the memo. This beer would get higher ratings if people were able to sample fresher bottles."
"Its to bad I had to give this a bad rating,I love to get the hard to find English ales.Anyways this poured a sort of gold color with a light head that did leave some lacing,the aroma was a little skunky (damn clear bottles!) and musty.The taste was a little skunky as well but I did pick up some slight maltiness to it.I would like to try this on tap or in its home country Iam sure it would be better."
"Scarecrow poured to a rather nice pale yellow but no head to be seen or any belgian lace. Nice clarity though. I must have gotton a good batch because I did not detect a hint of skunkiness. Overall a rather average ale with a cool label. Worth a try if you find."
"Pours with a medium white head that leaves no lace. Despite reading other reviews that this was skunkiest brew on the planet, I got a good batch without a trace of skunkiness. Clear golden color with carbonation that gradually dies. Crisp clean finish after a hoppy/malt start. Light - medium bodied."
"This is OK, and I'd rather drink it than something I know had tons of chemicals in it (this is apparently an organic brew). But this isn't something I'd choose to buy again."
"Very unimpressive ale. Cool bottle design, but that's about it. There was some definite skunkiness, damn clear bottles. It wasn't unbearable so maybe I bought it just in time before horribleness set in. Bitterness is noticeable in the aroma, taste, and aftertaste. It's nicely refreshing in a way. No excitement here. I'm staying away from clear bottles, unless it's Sam Smith's."
"Another clear bottle import ruined by skunky smell. Another $3.50 down the drain. Another cool bottle concept wasted. This beer probably would not be bad otherwise, as it did have some hops flavor. I don't know when some of these importers will realize they are shooting themselves in the foot with these clear bottles."
"This is certainly the least impressive brew I've had from Wychwood. Pours a slightly chalky, washed-out orange color, with very faint traces of carbonation. Virtually no head, just a faint bit of lace floating on the top. Smell is hoppy, earthy and herbal, with a bit of sweet caramel malt. Flavor is not bad at all, but it's far from being impressive. Hoppy flavor earthy and herbal like the aroma. Nice refreshing bitterness. Weak malt flavor here, though. Body is a bit watery, but otherwise Scarecrow has a pretty smooth mouthfeel."
"Notes: An all around ok pale ale, easy to drink but does not impress at all. Its lack of head and dull malt flavours made me a bit withdrawn from the brew. Not bad just lackluster."
"Great name because after opening this beer and tasting it I was scared off.  Terrible skunky aroma or shall I say smell.  The taste was very bland and no characteristics, also left a bad taste in my mouth.  Don't drink this beer.............CHEERS"
"Scarecrow was exactly how I felt when I took my first sip.  In fact that's how I felt after the second and third sip. The bitter taste was so over powering that I couldn't make it go down the fourth time and threw it down the drain. On one of my worst list!"
