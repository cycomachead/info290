3.75,6.8,,,,,,"500 ml bottle poured into an English pub glass. A dark lemon drop yellow with quick-breaking white head and a rather sweet buttered biscuit, orchard fruit spread, and floral hop aroma. More of the same on the palate, buttered biscuit and lightly honeyed breakfast cereal, subtle citrus (lemon and orange) and gooseberry/vinous fruit notes, nothing overly bold or assertive yet not bland either. Carbonation is low-key although the beer is not flat, with more mouthfeel than expected and a lingering doughy sweetness that carries through into the slightly chalky finish, where some lightly floral hops again make their presence known. Although there are no obvious flaws and the expected taste elements are there, I am struggling a little with the pedestrian and unassuming demeanor of this brew. What's there holds promise but one is left wanting more.","CalgaryFMC","Aug 06, 2014"

Pours slightly hazy bright golden color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense white head with solid retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings to the glass, with moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of honey, bread, cracker, biscuit, pear, apple, floral, grass, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of malt, honey, and fruity yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of honey, bread, cracker, biscuit, pear, apple, herbal, floral, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. No bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of honey, bread, cracker, biscuit, pear, apple, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Nice and pleasant flavors with balanced honey, bready malt, fruity yeast, and herbal hop flavors; with decent robustness and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a very smooth and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a good English blonde ale. Good balance of honey, malt, yeast, and herbal hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A pleasantly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 09, 2014"

The essence of honey more or less defines the aromas and flavors. Some toasty pale malt certainly factors in there as well, mostly in the aftertaste. A touch of light sweetness up front, though this all but disappears into a delicately bitter-floral, dry finish. Damn soft on the palate, quiet.

Served at a slightly lower temperature than normal for English ales (as per the back of the bottle) this would be quite refreshing as a warm wealther quaffing beer, yet there's enough flavor to keep things interesting. Not a ton of depth, but it's a solid English pale ale, and it's certainly the best 'honey' beer I've ever had. The presence of honey is easily discernable both on the nose and on the palate but it's not overly sweet or artificial tasting. This would likely be a solid B if it wasn't for the fact that it's $4.00 a bottle. For what it is, that's just a bit on the pricey side.","BedetheVenerable","Oct 28, 2011"

The nose of the beer had a sweetness to it and a bit of straw and apple. The beer itself was thin and had a touch of sweetness, but didn't have any substantive flavours or character that left me thinking it was much other than a macro. Once again the apple flavour was there, making me wonder if something was wrong with this beer.
