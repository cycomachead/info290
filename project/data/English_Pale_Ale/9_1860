The aroma that this beer has is something really good to me. Something that I'm unsure of how to describe. It smells sweet and really enjoyable. It's gotta be what ever malts they've used in this beer. The taste also carries over that sweetness and coats your mouth with some really nice sweet malts. I wish I knew what they put in this because it reminded me of my childhood somehow. I found the mouthfeel to be a little watery but overall this beer is quite good.","Knapp85","Apr 12, 2011"

A mild Jack Daniels sweetness and subtle maple butterscotch theme. A nice midland body brew with decent carbonation and good drinkability. The English Pale is a little different than most American Pale Ales. Not the same hop bitterness but quite decent in this example.","Durge","Jun 23, 2009"

3.63,8.4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Medium body, semi-sweet finish that lingered a bit.

3.8,13.4,4.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The taste is a tad bit less than what the aroma reveals. It is a medium bodied beer, a bit chewy, with loads of sweet caramel malts. There is definitely a full palate of fruity maltiness, a very bready backbone to the beer, balanced out pretty nicely by traditional Noble hops. There is a bit of a butterscotch, diacetyl characteristic that diminishes the taste to a degree. This beer seems to have a higher ABV than its 5.7% given it slightly thick and slightly cloyingly sweet syrupy mouthfeel and texture. There is perhaps a raisiny note or two towards the finish. The beer is defined by its sweet caramel malts, its malty fruitiness, the Noble hops, and the diacetyl lurking throughout. This is a nice pale ale, a bit stonger than one might expect, but full of character and worth seeking out.","albern","Dec 20, 2008"

3.85,14.9,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"The aroma is malty with diacytle yeast effects. There is also plenty of hops, toffee, and leaves. The appearance is amber with an average sized foamy head.

2.58,-23,3,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,"After reading the label and looking here I confirmed my initial suspician that this ""English Pale Ale"" had not been brewed in the mother country. What tipped me off initially was the fancy screw off cap which screamed DOMESTIC! Considering the value of this beer I was not upset that it's contract brewed here in the states but after sampling I got upset that apparantly this beer is rushed through production, this is indicitive of the extremely noticeable diacetyl aroma and flavor. Now the ""buttery"" affect from the diacetyl isn't completely offsetting to me, in fact I sort of enjoyed this taste in the brews I've sampled from Shipyard Brewing. It's very prominant and almost overpowering in this beer though. This one looks decent in the pint glass, nice copper color, small fizzy white head with decent lacing. Creamy and nicely satisfying mouthfeel. Lightly hopped even for an English Pale Ale, perhaps more hops would help offset the boring buttery flavor. One sixer and done for me.","kinger","Nov 23, 2008"
3.26,-2.7,3.5,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Medium watery brown color with a creamy tan head. Nice lacing and retention. Aroma has some diacetyl and apple juice along with caramel maltiness.

I don't detect much hop flavor at all-I'm guessing they use Styrian Goldings as bittering, and leave out flavor & aroma hops.

Wow, this is MUCH sweeter than I remember it, and the sweetness is complete with a fuller -albeit duller- mouthfeel. What happened to the pale, light, crisp ale I remember? I know I'm getting older but I remember a much different brew. Tangy and bittersweet as I recall, but loaded with the more of that buttery, butterscotch off-flavor that I picked up in the Stone Mil yesterday. Carobonation is mild to medium,and body is -again- fuller than I recall from many years past, being medium-full / moderate here. Chewy, but not necessarily in a good way. Fruity and vegetal, with notes of anise, cherry, ginger/gingerbread, and marshmallow . . . If this wasn't already an alcohol delivery vehicle I'd call it a good candidate for a drain pour - maybe it's just me, but this just ain't cutting it. There's a creamy-lactic quality here which makes me wonder if there's not some run-off from the Mackeson's used in the making of this?

3.85,14.9,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Clear. Russett in color with a reddish cast. The head is light tan, very creamy, holds quite well, and leaves a pretty solid lace down the glass. The aroma is quite bold with fruitiness, some caramel-malt, and rich earthy-mineral hops. The body is medium with a fine carbonation that gives a very nice creaminess in the mouth. The flavor mirrors the aroma with a light fruitiness above a rich & smooth medium-crystal maltiness and earthy hop flavor. There's a bit of oxidation as well. A balanced bitterness plays a supporting role to the maltiness. The finish is somewhat dry, but not really bitter, with a lingering maltiness. This ""contract"" brew lacks the character of the true Whitbread version, especially the fruitiness of their dual-strain yeast; and seems to have a bit of a flabby maltiness that's not present in the authentic version.","NeroFiddled","Sep 08, 2002"
2.64,-21.2,4,2.5,2.5,2,3,"This sample was brewed in Cinncinnati, OH.  It looked great, had a frothy, clingy head but a little too gassy for the style. The flavor reminded me of a rough, overattenuated homebrew I made--my first all grain mash brew. For a home brewed ale this would be acceptable. For a commercal product, it needs work (and the elite homebrewers would work on it if it was theirs).  Estery fruity flavor, lacking in mouthfeel. Rough, dry finish. Decently drinkable, but I'd rather drink a Sam Adams brew.","EagleTalon","Aug 21, 2002"

3.23,-3.6,4,3.5,3,3.5,3,"Sharp bracing taste. Somwhat biting and yeasty.  Full flavored, but a little too complex for my personal preferance.  Better on draught than in a bottle.","psugrad98","May 27, 2002"
3.21,-4.2,4,3,3,3.5,3.5,"The sample I had was brewed in Cincinnati, they are not doing this brew any justice. Decent at best, not even close to the real stuff.","Jason","May 22, 2002"
3.21,-4.2,4,3,3,3.5,3.5,"Very dark in color in comparison to an american pale ale.  Deep malt nose with little detectable hops.  Deep amber color..  Taste is fruity/estery but lacks any real hop bitterness.  'Tis good but laks on the hop side of my brain.","frank4sail","May 08, 2002"
3.98,18.8,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Deep amber sporting a quality lace. Raisin bread nose. Huge malt start ends mild hop complete with a fruity ester tang, a hint of currant in the mix. A complex English Pale which seems to want to lean towards an Old Ale in character. A unique beer worth a try.","inebrius","Apr 08, 2002"
3.4,1.5,4,4,3,4,3,"This ale was very full flavored, but perhaps too sweet for a pale ale.  The banana character got to me after a while.  Almost too rich, but good non the less","bmills1608","Mar 17, 2002"
