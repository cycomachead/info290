"Pours a deep golden color with a good soapy froth. Aroma of buttery toffee, bread, and earthy hops. Mild bitterness, and very much like an English bitter. Soft noble hops and a toffee/butterscotch like note. Finishes with a leafy hoppyness and a slight tang. Light to medium bodied feel with an oily hop and sweet yeast. Overall, a mild, session able ale with a very English character."

"Overall it's a typical pale ale dominated by english malts. So that means it's good to drink but not really something I would seek out again."
""
""
""
""
"I got more than expected!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I've definitely had better pale ales, but this is not one I would turn down if offered. I just wouldn't buy a 6 pack, or seek it out in general with better offerings out there."

"O- A decent beer, it tastes like the Boston Lager a bit. Not a big fan of IPA's but I can drink this one. And usually if I can drink it, it's pretty good."

"Medium bodied with good carbonation. Easy to drink. Quick finish a little metallicy."

"SOLID, NOT MUST HAVE!"
"I was excited when this beer first came out because I am a big fan of Sammy A. Their ability to brew micro beers in bulk is impressive. The appearance poured with a nice clear copper color. Little to no head and lace with this bottle. The smell had nice hop aroma, but the other components of beer are missing. Taste was a good balance between malt and hops. The mouthfeel was good....medium body with a nice level of carbonation. Overall a drinkable brew that can be sessioned easily."
"I think this is a good pale ale from Sam Adams. Could be way better and I did over-hype it to myself but Im not dissappointed. Its a decent beer that I wouldnt mind to get again...even though I'd prefer a Doggie Style or a Sierra Nevada."
"O- Very drinkable, but the flavor is on the light side. Overall this is a decent pale ale but I wish there was a little more hop characteristics or complexity."
"Na Zdravje!"
"To me this is one of their better beers. It has amazing lace and head that just stick around. The body is a bronze transparent color with a lot of small bubbles. It has grainy aroma with a lot of hop esters. The flavor is cereal like with the hops really balancing out the malt. The only negative about this beer at all is that is does have a metallic aftertaste. It is a very smooth medium bodied beer."
"This is not a bad beer overall, and for someone like me who's not a huge hops fan, this is okay and relatively mild."
"the look of this beer is anice rich golden with some nice lacing. The smell isn't too overpowering, it's actually a lot milder than I was expecting. The taste was overall too tame for me. I wish this pale had a bit more bite. That being said, it is very drinkable and smooth so there is a silver lining."
"O: not bad. pleasant enough and easy to drink."
"drinkability: for a basic pale ale, very dissapointing, coming off as more a pilsner or light lager, with its hop characteristics clashing with the grain/corn body; drinkable, but lacking for the style."
"O- not a PA i would buy/recommend ..i will stick to SA boston lager or noble pils"
"o - Overall not a bad beer, but a little bland. Lots of bready malts and fruity malts. Worth trying but wouldn't actively seek it out again."
"O: This is one of the beers from Sam Adams that I've been disappointed by each time I've had it. Not one I would recommend."
"Medium bodied and crisp. The flavor is earthy with some pale malt and a slight sweetness toward the middle. A very run-of-the-mill English Pale Ale flavor. Not at all a bad thing. It finishes earthy with a bit of resin like hop oil that gives it a dry aftertaste. You could definitely drink a few of these in one sitting but it probably wouldn't be the first beer on my mind as I headed to the bar."
"Don't know how a lot of people give this almost a below average score. This really gives all the English Pale ales some big competition. I guess because with so many extreme styles and more intricate tastes in beers I guess I can see why people think this is a very straight forward beer... but its definitely not bad at all. This is Samuel Adams most underrated beer in my opinion even with the very straight forward taste it sure is solid one."
"Not a bad Pale Ale, it's got a good drinkablity and a mediam body to it. It's got a nice amount of hops and malts on the nose with that going into the flavor also. The Ale has a pleasing yellowish golden color. This is far from Sam's best but it's still a solid brew."
"It is a slightly sub par beer, but I am not entirely sure why it is even labeled a pale ale as it was more malt forward than anything. I would not recommend it to any beer drinker besides someone new to the sport"
"O- it is from a big time company so the color and mouthfeel is right. It's the taste that sucks. Won't revisit you. I enjoy Sam Adams stuff. But not this."
"A nice beer, wish it was available year round."
"Notes: Recommended. An overall solid, good-tasting, dependable brew. Will purchase again."
"D - This has decent drinkability. It is light and easy to drink, but it doesn't have the best flavor. It's an alright beer, but there are plenty of better pale ales out there."
"D- Very easy to drink, nice balance with slight edge to hops over nice biscuit malt."
"Drinkability: A very drinkable brew that can be consumed all night of with most foods. I bet this one is dynamite with pizza."
"Could easily drink a 6 of these."
"12 oz bottle. Pours golden with a small white head, lovely carbonation. Aroma of floral hops, biscuit malt with some citrus and pear notes. Light to medium, slightly crisp body. Flavor of biscuit malt, ripe fruit with earthy hops come through in the long dry finish. Decent English Pale."
"Poured golden / orange. Aroma of light hops some citrus notes. Taste is lightly hopped with some malted. Palate is light to med body with moderate carbonation. Finish is light hops with some malt for balance. Overall an average simple drinkable Pale Ale."
"D - This is a fairly drinkable beer. It is very different from what I picture as a British pale ale, but still enjoyable. I would enjoy it more with some crisper hops and maybe some British yeast fruitiness."
"D - Drinkability is low. What began as a beautiful beer turned out to be a wolf in sheep's clothing. The only popping characteristic of this beer is the bitterness at the end, which is unacceptable. Shame."
"I did finally realize there was a pleasant odor halfway through, so it saves some points in the aroma department . It smelled more malty, to me, than hoppy. Overall, its good. If they had it on tap at a bar I'd have one."
"of mild cereal grains, faint smokiness and very mild hops citrus. Taste is very reserved, some corn tastes upfront, but moves to a nicely mellow hops and mushy banana. Spicy, almost cinnamon finish. A little bland and cheap tasting, but certainly a good first ""decent beer"" experience. Feel is average, more body than most mainstream beers, more flavor and more to experience."
"Appearance is a misty golden orange with a fair head that dissapates, but not totally leaving nill lace. Smell of light sweet caramel malts, citrus and hops. Taste has the caramel sweetness with light body and hops. Mouthfeel is light with good carbonation. Not a big bodied, complex pale ale, but good nonetheless."
"Overall: Pretty good beer overall. Not Samuel Adams' best offering by any means but it's a decent English Pale Ale. The aroma and flavor could stand to be a bit more robust but it isn't a deal breaker. It's worth a try."
"Taste is very much a light pale ale. Very light. More flavor than BMC, but clearly the next level, a better introduction to beer. Carbonation seems high on the palate compared with the appearance. Dry, typical Sam Adams underhopping (even for an English style pale) and lemon flavor. Another underwhelming effort from SA."
"Good crisp ale here. Carbonation level is good, finishes clean. This has great flavor. Excellent balance between the bittering hops and a smooth sweet finish. Floral notes noted in the flavor, as well as some apple notes. This surprised me. I wasn't expecting much, but this is as accessible of a Pale Ale as one can get. A spot in the fridge is set aside for this one from now on."
"Sam Adams Pale Ale is probably one of their more bitter beers but it still has that delicious full body taste and smooth texture that Sam Adams is know for. I should mention that even though it does have that bitter taste, the bitterness still doesn't compare to that of say Stone's IPA. I would call this a good bar beer to have 1 or 2 of."
"DB- Nice malt and hop flavors and certainly refreshing. Sam Adams makes a lot of solid beers with nice flavors. Maybe just a tad too hoppy and bitter for the substance of this one."
"I was never a fan of Sam Adams Pale Ale. Not by a longshot. It looks good and all with nice color and a somewhat lacey head, but it falls short in the taste department. It's not very flavorful to begin with and what little flavor is present is quite disagreeable to my palate. It's just bready with an offensive skunkiness. Not sure why they still make this. This will probably be the last chance I give this beer."
"Nothing outstanding here, pretty average pale ale."
"Average drink. A sort of bland, not exciting rendition."
"I love this beer. It pours to a nice head that sticks to the glass all the way down. Th e smell is definetly of hops and malts. The taste is great it has a great balance of hops and malts, with a medium mouthfeel and one hell of a drinkablility. I really recommend you try this Pale Ale you will truly be satisfied."
"Light, coppery golden with a smooth, lumpy white head. Sweet, toasty malt and mild herbal English hops in the aroma. Lightly toasted and caramel tasting malt with some minty and citric hop bittering to balance. Light bodied with prickly carbonation. This is a fine example of an English style PA but a little more flavor concentration would help as it is slightly underwhelming."
"Pours a hazy tan with a 3/4 inch head. Medium bodied and creamy but really not much flavor to comment on. In fact I'd say this is just a tiny step up from standard mass produced beers like the Bud Lights of the world (or the Sam Adams Lights for that matter, in fact I'd choose this over a SA Light). Granted it is a Pale Ale so it naturally would be more subtle than a lot of other beers."
"D - I had a Saranac Pale Ale the day before, which I thought was better. This pale ale was decent, but I didn't think it quite measured up."
"Had this one from a Sam's summer variety case. Pours a clear golden color with nice white head and good carbonation. Seems somewhat on the lighter side as most craft pale ales are somewhat darker then what's offered here. A very clean smelling beer with the faintest of lemon, citrus like hops. You really need to struggle to get much of any aroma. Tastes sweet with a touch of caramel like goodness. Nothing that really stands out. Mouthfeel just okay. This beer strikes me as one where Sam Adams tried to keep things neutral and safe. It's not bad; it's just not anything close to revel over."
"Drinkability- pretty good, could have a few more of these if they were available! Not too flowery for me, nice light n clean flavor, enjoyable on a warm late summer night"
"This beer doesn't have a ton of flavor, but overall pretty decent. Light and easy to drink. It looks fantastic and generally enjoyable, but nothing really too special. I'd buy it again for a good session beer."
"D - This isn't the best pale ale I've had but it's on the easier side to drink."
"D- did not enjoy this beer, I think sam adams could have spent a bit more time, or maybe I got a bad one. Either way, I'm hesitant to drink the rest."
"Overall, clearly in the English style of pale ales. Nothing over-the-top here, just subtle, understated flavors. An o.k. English Pale, easily lost in the crowd."
"pretty drinkable, but not a whole lot of flavor. i could session all night long, but theres a whole lot of better choices out there. not a bad 2 bottles in the summer mix pack however."
"Drinkability: An above average pale that very much tastes like a Sam Adams brew. Nothing I would get excited over, yet high quality, and one I could have a six of."
"When i poured it into my pint glass, it has a 1 finger length white foamy and fizzy head to it, on top of a golden color body. The smell is of malts and a little biscuit. The beer has a nice crisp taste to it. It is a very smooth ale, which has a nice mouth feel, and is very drinkable. I really like this one, it is very refreshing after a long day at work."
"Pours a sparkly clear gold, with a fizzy white head - virtually zero retention or lacing. Aroma is of bready malt, a touch of toasted caramel, and floral hops - also some minty hops in there. Taste is of light sweet grains and grassy / spicy hops - also some lemon zest in the hop profile... well balanced. This one has a little butteriness to it, as well. Mouthfeel is light, with moderate carbonation and a zingy finish. I found it to be a well balanced beer, but nothing too exciting - its very drinkable and refreshing and makes for a great summertime brew."
"D- Drinkable, would have this one again. Not bad on a hot and sticky night. There's a reason why this is included in the ""Summer Variety"" case from the BBC."
"Poured into a frozen clear glass mug this beer produces a thick white foamy head about two inches high. The head had very little staying power and faded to a thin white covering with lace of little clinging power. Color is a rich golden amber of an 8 on the SRM chart. There is nothing really noteable about the smell, light malt. Feels good on my tongue, just the right amount of tickle from the carbonation. Taste has just a hint of hops. Not a lot of bitterness, but just enough to add zing. I would spend my cash for more of this brew."
"Drinkability: Went fine with a meal (Vegetarian chili and cornbread) and I could see myself drinking it alone. It's way too carbonated to be a true cask English pale ale, but despite this it hits a lot of the flavor notes well and it's an enjoyable beer."
"d- good, solid pale ale offering from mr. koch, i would drink this again."
"This is a drinkable beer, and I think it would be hard to find a person who really had a problem with it. It might also be hard to find a person who really loves it either though."
"D - Easy drinker, could have a few. Definitely not complex, but a good summer drink nonetheless. Quenching."
"T: initial taste slightly bitter with hints of grass in the flavor; not sweet; the spicing is on the pungent side; a touch of tinny aftertaste; overall the flavor is a creative interpretation of a pale ale flavor, but tempered to reach a wide clientele"
"Notes: Fits in well with Sam Adams line up. Its nothing special, but its a decent english pale ale."
"All in all, this is not that great of an example of the Pale Ale style. Seems to me like most of the Sam Adams beers taste the same, I think their best stuff is just the Boston Lager."
"Drinkability: Could have a good session with this alone. Not any overpowering flavors but a good mix of them to want more."
"D - Very drinkable and light. Very summer seasonal qualities."
"Strong carbonation and a light mouthfeel make this one a pretty easy drinker."
"for some reason I think it smells like a lager should smell. More like an English pale ale."
"This is an excellent pale ale from Samuel Adams. Cheers!"
"Not a leader in regards to the style but a decent, enjoyable brew. This came as part of a sampler pack but I probably would only buy this in a six pack if my options were limited. Not bad, but not great either."
"M/D: Super drinkable, nice smooth mouthfeel, better than I remember."
"D: Versatile, refreshing, and timeless. You can drink this beer with practically anything and at any time of day in any season."
"All in all pretty good, but not wowing me, worth a try in the mix pack but don't go out of your way to get it."
"Final Notes: Overall not impressed with this beer. It's not bad, just a bit on the light/watery side. I wouldn't turn it down though, and I imagine it would make a great beer to serve at parties."
"I seen the Latitude 48 in a Summer sampler, and just HAD to buy the whole freekin thing, along with Light, Blackberry Wit, Boston Lager and Summer Ale. Dammit. 3 out of the 6 is worth it. plus I never had the Pale Ale before. I think I could drink a lot of these in the summer, but all in all, it's just an O.K. Pale ale. Pours a Crystal clear, bright golden hue. thick white head, looks delicious. Taste has a decent balance of hops and malt, lite body and no lingering aftertaste. At least there was no Cranberry Lambic in this sampler"
"I wanted the Latitude 48, so I had to get the whole Summer Styles box. Oh well, I guess I'll suck it up and drink the extraneous bottles. Tee hee. This one pours a clear pale golden straw with over a finger of white froth on top. The nose comprises some light wheat, bready-ish yeast, and hops. Just hops. Deal with it. The taste holds notes of everything above, along with a weak hoppy bitterness and some grass. The body is light, with moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, a decent enough pale, but I'm not at all impressed. At least it's not objectionable."
"D: This was very unimpressive, only a half step up from a macro lager. It was more bready yeast than hops, making it seem like a wheat beer rather than a pale ale. It wasn't very clean either, but it was at least bland enough to drink quickly and easily. Not recommended."
"Pours a clear gold with a big white head. Aromas of fresh hops are a bit too subdued. They feature more prominently on the palate, where they do a nice job of balancing the toffeeish malts. This is an excellent session beer. My friends and I have discovered that it goes well with snacks and World Cup matches!"
"Not a whole lot to dislike here, although it's not a favorite style of mine, and this one could have used a little more assertiveness (not aggressiveness, just needs more character). Decent enough, I guess."
"I could see myself picking up a sixer of this for a barbeque or day in the pool."
"Appearance and smell are pretty average honestly. The taste and the mouthfeel is really sort of unique. It's a really tart beer, and I think in this case the carbonation fits the flavor. There is a lot of carbonation... more than I'd normally like, but it's really fitting for this one. You could drink these one after the other because of the taste and feel. Different."
"d: does not quite make the grade. will be looking for OTHER brews..."
"D-good session beer"
"D- this brew redeemed itself in the end. It is a refreshing beer that is very drinkable for the summer. The crisp flavor really makes it go down easy"
"D: This beer is pretty mild, all around. It is not really exciting, but it is quite drinkable."
"Poured from a standard SA brown bottle with a brewery freshness month of August into a perfect pint glass. Appears a very light orange color that is strikingly clear with a lively amount of carbonation rising through the liquid in support of the white head atop the brew. Initially the head was more than 2 fingers strong but it receeded to just a thin coating atop and lacing sticks in plenty of patches about the glass. Aroma has herbal hops, faint grainy malt and a slight mineral touch in the backend. The most prominent aspect of the aroma is the herbal hops that have a twing of citrus aspect about them as the beer warms. Taste has a combination upfront of herbal and citrus hops. The citrus aspect is a little more evident than indicated in the aroma. The malt presents itself with a biscuity flavor across a thin body before finishing quite crisp with the herbal, slightly citrus hops lingering in the mouth. The alcohol is mildly evident in both flavor and warming factor. Overall it is a decent pale. Quite light and refreshing it would be easy to throw a few of these back."
"Drinkability- pretty good, I liked it. I would drink it again. Good on a hot summer day"
"D- Great beer on a hot day. An excellent example of an EPA"
"Not my favorite example of the style, but quite drinkable."
"Id never guess it was a 5.25 abv."
"Notes - A slightly different take on an EPA. The part I don't like is the mouthfeel: EPA's shouldn't be thin and highly carbonated. But then again, this is in the ""summer pack", so I guess it's supposed to feel refreshing. Either way, it's a decent enough beer, but I don't plan on buying it again."
"D= very drinkable if you only want a somewhat generic pale ale, probably good with most meals since it's generic enough not to distract from good food. Nothing that I'll seek out in the future, however."
"First impression is that this beer is very dry, very subdued hop profile, and mild maltiness. A bit too dry. This is a pretty unremarkable beer, not much flavor. I am used to better from Sam Adams"
"Nice light body, yet has some substance. This is by all means a quaff-able beer any time of year. BBC has the right idea with their take on this style."
"Buy Again? No."
"Pours a one finger white head that fades quickly to a ring leaving traces of lace. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Crystal clear amber color. Nose is light hops. Flavor is mostly hops but some sweet malts try to balance. Light bitter aftertaste. Best by Jun 2010. $1.85 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, MA."
"drinkability- is low, i would not buy a six pack of this, and would be hesistant to purchase a variety pack of this was included, the body is too thin. when i think of an english pale ale, i think of a floral bouquet of hops in the aroma, not here, and would expect a malty back bone."
"D -- Well, it's definitely downable, but compared with a Goose Island Honkers, I'm a little disappointed. I may have to try this warmer -- a la English ale, and see if I have a different opinion."
"D - Can easily session this, as it doesn't have much flavor and is low ABV."
"D: A very enjoyable English style pale. It's not really up to the supreme standard of Samuel Smith's Old Brewery Pale or Fuller's London Pride, but a nice effort nonetheless. Glad I have another bottle in my ""Summer Styles"" mixed pack."
"Definitely a thirst quencher, this beer is easily enjoyable for hours on end. Found myself licking my lips from time to time to make sure no drops escaped."
"Cheers!"
"Cheers!"
"Poured golden amber, mostly clear. Head started off white and tall but very soon turned to a diminutive ring. Fresh green hops on the nose, not much else to note. Taste twists into some bitterness midway through, followed by some mellow malts. A bit of citric aftertaste; feel is carbonated and acidic. Nothing really stood out a lot about this beer, but it was worth the try in the sampler pack."
"Overall: See drinkability."
"Sam Adams Pale Ale is a good example of an English Pale Ale that is very drinkable."
"Easy drinking brew.."
"Overall a decent session ale. Worth a try."
"D: A solid beer that I will turn to often. Very sessionable and refreshing."
"D- easy enough to finish but not very interesting. this is something i dont think ill be picking up again."
"Samuel Adams Pale Ale is an overall decent Pale Ale, especially if you remember it is the English version not the West Coast style. It is worth a try."
"The mouthfeel's got the subtle hops, but the ""specialty malts"" have got to be your average pale malts. The hop presence offers a bit better feel than your baseline pale ale."
"D: I enjoyed and appreciated the more balanced English style; not too resiny and sharp bitter in the finish while being able to taste the malt."
"D - Drinkable, but it's not something I'd like to go back to."
"D - Very refreshing...I'm not terribly familiar with the English style of Pale Ale, but this seems like a great intro to the style."
"D: drinks very easy, probably going to be my other drinkin beer."
"D-It goes down easy but there isn""t much to it. The hops are a little pedestrian for what I expect from a pale ale."
"Pours a very nice transparent amber color with a white head slightly less than one finger. Some lacing is left behind. The nose is full of sweet malt accompanied by fruity citrus notes and hops. The taste is very well balanced, sweet malt with a nice hop bitterness with a refreshing dry finish. Very refreshing beer that is very enjoyable. I could drink this every day and not get tired of it."
"Very clear, golden bodied. Medium sized white head, dissipated but still leaves a trail. Sweet malt and nice floral hops on the nose. Basically the same thing for the taste: sweet malts well blended with a nice floral hop background. Somewhat acidic, thin to medium mouth. One of those beers you could drink all night long"
"Drinkability - Within the price and style ranges this beer does not present a viable alternative. There are much better, even benchmark pale ales for the same money. On the other hand, although it is somewhat mediocre it is still a very drinkable beer on its own merits. Better than the average beer but not up to the expectations I have for Sam Adams."
"D-A mediocre brew from Sam Adams, but I guess not every beer can be their best."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is about what you can expect with pale ales in terms of of thickness, there is no noticeable points from the hops or the sweetness. This is reasonably drinkable if you wanted to drink an EPA, but overall, there are better EPA's."
"D=I'm mixed about this one. It succeeds admirably as a beer, but I have to judge its merits as a pale ale, and in that respect it doesn't do well."
"Drinkability - A respectable entry for the British Pale Ale, I wouldn't be bothered by having another one. Of course I prefer the American style of Pale Ale so I would probably pick another Pale over this one."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Very crisp and smooth. Not too overpowering on the palate."
"Flavor follows the lightness of the pour and nose with a touch of citrus and a light graininess. Not bad but just not a whole lot going on, yet at least it doesn't offend. Feel is decent for the beer and more spritzy than the lack of carbonation might suggest. Drinkability matches the feel but one must ponder, why?"
"Drinkability: A solid beer. Once again, Sam Adams has made a decent beer that represents its style well. I'll be having this one again for sure."
"Sam adams pale ale poured a slightly dark amber color, with a slightly smaller head. It smelt of hops, and nohting else. It tasted like a pale ale, no extra flavors, just beer, it was dry, and bitter, but not overly bitter. It was easy to drink, tastes great, one of my favorite beers."
"Sorry, SA, but you need to look elsewhere."
"Drinkability - Pretty drinkable. As someone said beneath me, I'll defiantly finish these in the sample pack but I wouldn't seek this out, but overall for what it is, not a bad beer."
"Clean and mellow flavors on the palate with soft malt, gently grassy & herbal hops, and a little citrus hop zing near the end. Finishes somewhat clean. Easy drinking."
"Taste starts nice, good bitterness similar to a run of the mill IPA but ends with a bit of a turpentine aftertaste, which is not too pleasant and ruins it. Will finish these (as part of sampler) but will not buy again."
"+ this is a well balanced beer, one that might get my SABL friends drinking some pale ales with me."
"The mouthfeel is decent, but thin with regard to other comparable brews. This goes down very easily for a pale ale, but that has a lot to do with the subdued hops and overall lack of bitterness. A decent brew, but I was honestly disappointed. Have came to expect more from Boston Beer Co."
"Don't belive I'll be trying this beer anytime in the near future. I am a fan of Sam and their beers, but I am no fan of this brew."
"not the beer it once was. definitely needs an overhaul."
"Aroma of bready malt and corn notes, faint floral hops. Flavors of corn and metallic notes, some faint toffee and biscuit. Mild bitterness, no hop flavors. Even mouthfeel, a bit slick, finishes tingly. Not much complexity or balance, not too drinkable."
"Has a light amber color when poured and a thin beige head that quickly dissipates to a collar. Aroma is a mix of floral hops and some light bread tones. The taste is a mix of the bitter floral hops (which tend to kick in going down) and a light mix of bread and toffee. It was ""crisp"" going down with noticeable carbonation, which was surprising since i expected something smoother. Overall nothing great, definitely other better English Pale Ales out there with better flavors, but at the same time it's not bad either."
"D: Not one that would really would want to sit around all day and drinnk. COuld I have alot yes, but there are many better choices from Sam Adams. There is nothing overly offensive about this beer but nothing really dedeaming either"
"Sam Adams continues to be a solid brewery and a great ambassador for the craft community."
"D: This doesn't really hit the right notes for me. I would have preferred a stronger, hoppier pale ale."
"D/Overall: It goes down easily enough. It's not a horrible beer, but not one of my favorites from Sam Adams. Doubt I'll go for it again, as I imagine there will always be better options."
"I've reviewed a number of Boston Beer beers lately and this one is like many of the others; a good example of the style but not a real standout. Their best beers are the ones that were originated from the brewery. this one is, again, a good example but there are many pales I'd have before this one."
"O: A much milder alternative to flagship Boston Lager, but a worth addition to the Samuel Adams family."
"Overall a decent beer, but nothing special. There's no real flavor from the hops, which I expect from a pale ale. The roasted malt and citrus come through with hints, but again make it just average tasting. It went down smooth, was enjoyable and is the type of beer to drink all night, but I'd prefer an ice cold Sam Adam's Boston Lager on tap over this pale ale anytime."
"Pours a clear golden yellow with a white head, about average. Aroma is malty and just slightly fruity, not strong but still appealing. Flavor is malty and a little fruity, just a shade hoppy, fair to middling. Texture is smooth and a little fizzy. A nice mild beer."
"Clear copper color with 1/2 inch tan head. Head dissipiated quickly but left thin layer and plenty of lace. Pleasant aroma of biscuit and caramel. Medium mouthfeel provided pleasant drinkability. Full caramel flavor with a hint of honey and hops leading to a balanced finish between malt and hops. No bitter aftertaste and was a good beer for a cool evening. Featured beer at our local Smokey Bones restaurant."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a light brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Has a mild smell, some hops. Taste is also mild, some hops and malts. Feels light in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this is not a bad beer, but nothing special."
"Overall, this beer had some nice flavors for it being a pale ale. Nothing to go crazy for, but out of the pale ales I have had, this one isn't too bad."
"I never want another one, but I don't really like pale ales. Even if you do, I wonder how much of this you'd want to enjoy. The more experience with ""better"" beers I get, the more I wonder how pale ales continue to exist."
"Taste is clean and fresh with just a mild influence from the hops, a slight bittering and a bit of floral flavor. The beer is well balanced and actually is pretty damn tasty. While it is not exactly flavor-packed, this makes a fine session beer and is quite easy to drink. As an EPA, it is no bad at all. I actually find this to be one of the more enjoyable SA beers in the lineup."
"Bought in a variety pack (Sam Adams Summer Styles), I was not sure of what to expect from 'Pale Ale.' Appearance looked great (as does almost any beer), the aroma was enticing (like most of Sam Adams beers). The taste was surprising and good. Containing that distinct bitter & unique characteristic found in 'Boston Lager' and other Sams, the Pale Ale won my vote for a good beer. And I would recommend it to those who appreciate beer, not to those who just like ""good"" beer."
"This beer is very drinkable and might become a fixture on the menu at my house."
"Overall: A perfect compliment to their flagship lager--drains as well as any pale ale I've tasted... solid all around with the appropriate flavor and balance--an excellent East Coast answer to the Sierra Nevada variety..."
" ~ Once again the Boston Beer Company has made a winner. This is a nice light pale ale that is very drinkable."
"I was expecting a bit of a hop monster with this one, something close to the Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. That is not the case. Smells very hoppy and grainy but the mouthfeel is not nearly as dry as a traditional pale ale. You can actually taste a good amount of malts. It's a good beer, but don't turn to it if you are in the mood for a hoppy bear."
"Overall - its a pretty mild pale ale in my opinion. it could use better to be a bit stronger on the initial taste and smell. it has a macro brew feel to it. i enjoy it because its really easy to drink with a smooth taste. i would like it if it were a bit stronger but then again thats why i like IPAs so much. i would buy this again."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied with moderate carbonation. An easy-drinking brew that has definite session potential thanks to the lower bitterness (for the style)."
" This beer is decent for drinking, and the Summer 24 packs can be nice if you're having a group of people over due to the mixture of several different beers. All in all a nice beer for a summer barbeque due to it not being overpowering, and being quite smooth."
"Carbonated, thin mouthfeel, nothing special."
"[Drinkability]: Drinkabitlity is good."
"D: This is definitely an easy drinking beer that would please even casual beer drinkers."
"Has an extreamly easy to drink balance and character. Very tasty, very much a party pleaser. Not overly hoppy for ""hop heads"" - but its very nice."
"Cheers!"
"The mouth feel is pretty smooth and it is reasonalbly drinkable. I probably wouldn't buy this again. There are just too many other pale ales that I prefer."
"Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass. Had nice look to it, less pale than I expected. A foamy head that stuck around for quite awhile with decent clarity to it. The lacing on the glass lasts the entire drink as well. Didn't smell quite as strong as I expected. The hops were present, but not quite as noticable as I expected. Tasted pretty good, again not quite as hoppy as I would have expected but the hop flavor does stand out. The mouthfeel and drinkability was also good. Overall very crisp and refreshing. On a side note, my wife and I did burrito's for dinner and this beer goes excellent with mexican in my opinion."
"Appear clean amber with a short white head. Smells a touch soapy with lemon and dry dark bread crust. The flavor is smooth, sweet white bread with a little toffee followed by a kick of spicy hops. Tastes like there might be a hint of diacetyl. Drinkable and a nice English pale ale - not something you see much of around here. I suppose this beer reminds me of a cleaned-up Shipyard pale ale."
"Poured a gold color with a medium white head Nose is bready malt with earthy tones. Taste is a bit metallic tasting with a good dose of hops. Mouthfeel is a bit on the light side, good carbonation. Easy enough to drink, flavor was alright, but nothing really stands out."
"Definitely a lower caliber brew from the BBC"
"Nice and sessionable though"
"It's thin bodied, heavy in carbonation, and a dry finish. Sessionable? For sure."
"Drinkability: Overall another solid effort by Sam Adams. I'd definitely have it again- Sam Adams can always be a good go-to in almost any style. This beer is no different."
"D: It starts off face-cringingly bothersome, but once the hops take over a bit more in time, it becomes tolerable. This was one of my first ""craft"" beers, one that got me into good beer as it was, so coming back to it was very disappointing. Oh well."
"Pours a clear gold with a medium sized head. Smell is a bit of toasted malt with some floral hops. Taste is a light biscuity malt. Some hop bite through the middle and into the finish. Herbal and floral. Significant sweetness throughout. Balanced. Very British in taste and aroma. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied and well carbonated. Quite drinkable. Overall this is a very nice English style pale ale."
"D: This is a fairly bland pale ale. It's easy to drink, but nothing really notable to make me want to crack open another one."
"D- An enjoyable beer that I enjoyed, but there are better options out there when looking for a Pale Ale."
"Nothing really amazing about this ale. It's simply drinkable. Although it isn't a stellar example of the style, it is quite drinkable and worth it as a good session brew."
"A passable pale ale, but certainly nothing special and falling short of any really good English or American interpretation of the style. Easily drinkable and quite refreshing, but a bit one-dimensional and lacking much real character."
"Pours a slightly copper color with a nice 2 finger head that leaves nice lacing. The aroma is slightly sweet with a hint of pine. The taste is a nice smooth experience with some caramel notes and not a lot of hoppiness. It is not mind-blowing, but a good overall session beer for a summer night."
"Pours out a light, clear dirty-gold with barely any head. Smells hoppy but otherwise like any standard beer in that nothing sticks out in my nose. Tastes hoppy, fruity, and bitter and leaves a light bitter aftertaste. Creamy mouthfeel and a balanced carbonation. A solid beer, nothing exemplary but I'd have another."
"Last beer from the SA summer pack, a pretty generic english-style pale ale. Not a whole lot to distinguish it from the pack. Glad the metal finish went away after a few sips."
"Drinkability/Final thoughts - I was excited to see what, if any unique twist Sam Adams gave to there Pale Ale. The only thing a bit different than others is that it's very smooth & caramel like, with not allot of hop bitterness at all, which I didn't mind. I really enjoyed the light roasted-toasted flavors this beer offered, and the well complimented mouthfeel. Sam Adams has this one down, if your looking for a Pale Ale that offers smoothness and semi rich caramel/molasses flavors, than look no further. I could enjoy about 3 pints of this stuff on any given day, pretty good stuff. Cheers!"
"D-It's drinkable because of the average abv, but I wouldn't suggest going out and finding a six pack. I got it in a mixed 12 pack. Nice for a review if you havent tried it..."
"Pretty forgettable, but decent as an English pale ale. Still noticeably American in it's hopping, but worth a try."
"I purchased the Summer Styles 12 pack and this was my first time trying Sam's Pale Ale. I must say it was better then I anticipated. This is a drinkable beer and definitely not a bad ale to have around during the summer."
"D. Overall a good beer. Good flavors and malty character."
"Overall, a good representation of the style. Not like the really hoppy pale ales out there (Sierra Nevada, New Belgium Mighty Arrow). This is a nice relaxing beer."
"Drinks pretty well. Definitely sessionable."
"D: Very easy to drink this pale ale. Not overly complex but a nice summer beer."
"One could sit down and have a few without being overwhelmed. An all around good pale ale. I like it better than their mainstay lager style."
"Quite a nice ale. Very drinkable."
"D - This was a drinkable beer, very clean and slightly complex, good on a hot day"
"All in all a drinkable pale better. But there are better."
"D: Drinkable enough but unspectacular. A bolder attempt with bigger malt and hops additions would make this brew go from simply good to great."
"D: Goes down good if you like carbonation."
"on a side note i am enjoying this brew very much for an ale"
"Drink is very good very easy to have for a session beer or for a good tasting."
"Pours sort of a greenish/gold/light red clear color - sort of different IMO. Sizeable white head mostly diminishes with good lacing throughout. Mild hop aroma with citrus and pine notes. Also mild on the malt end. Actually it is pretty mild all the way around. Nothing stands out about this beer, but I guess a good beer on a hot day. Very light IMO"
"D - Its a nice lawnmower beer but there isn't a whole lot of depth to it. The malt level is almost non-existent while the hops are just there. It's certainly easy to drink though."
"A little light-bodied and thin."
"drinkability - is very good on this 85 degree day"
"a very easy but basic bland beer. not getting much in the taste department but all together very enjoyable"
"pretty delicious for a go-to, if this could ever be that. I feel a trend coming with BBC. they go out and make the most average decent beers you can slap your hands on. there is just nothing to dislike about this beer, but it falls short of greatness."
"Had from the bottle with bbq chicken and brisket. An easy drinking pale ale due to how balanced it is. Nice malty backbone with big English hops. Relative high hop bitterness with a earthy, slightly metallic finish. This is their Irish Red Ale's big brother."
"Overall: It's not my favorite product from Sam. I'm a big fan of most Sam Adam's products but I could take this one or leave it. There are better Pale Ales out there. Not saying I wouldn't drink this if you gave it to me but I don't think I'd buy it again with so many other options out there."
"A 12 ounce bottle poured into a standard shaker glass. Appears a clear pale yellow color with around a finger of creamy off white foam. The foam fades within a few minutes leaving no lace on the inside of my glass. The nose flavor is filled with notes of light earthy, grassy hops, mild citrus such as lemon, toasted malt, and bread. This ale is medium bodied and amply carbonated for it's style."
"I would rather have the Sam Adams Boston Ale, which despite it's claim to be an old style American Stock Ale, is very much an English Pale Ale in my book."
"D- Nothing here to wow you but I could drink a few of these. The flavor profile of the ale is quite pleasant, it just tastes watered down. A bit more body and maybe a bit more hops and this would be a very solid brew."
"I have to admit I'm a big fan of American styles of pale ales so it's taken several of these for me to develop a feel for the English variety. I still prefer an APA but this is a very good beer, it's mild but that's the style."
"The taste is light grain, hay, citrus, bread, and hints of pine. It's nice, clean, crisp, and very drinkable, if rather light and a bit thin."
"Nice, full mouthfeel. Dry aftertaste."
"Drinkability: It's nice to have a Pale ale that has more of a malt figure then a grapefruit hopped mess. Not only is this balanced correctly, but it's a perfect year round beer, refreshing in the summer, and toasty enough to keep your attention on a cold night. A excellent stab at the English style thats a sure go to brew in my book!"
"Overall, a very nicely balanced pale ale without assaulting your taste buds with excessive hoppy taste."
"a mellow, crisp, unique, subtle brew from a great macroCraft brewery system."
"Pours with a yellow color to it. Aroma is inline with other pale ale's. The taste is slightly more complex than other pale ale's. The taste is clean and but not too dry. It is sweet while not being overly bitter. Sweeter than more pale ale's. Very drinkable. More malty than bitter so it is easy to drink."
"This is yet another good starter beer from BBC."
"Out of standard brown bottle this beer was a light orange color with good clarity. The head was slightly yellow in tint, a little more than a finger thick and displayed decent retention and good lacing. The aroma was a blend of slightly musty malt, pale malt and light, floral hops. The flavors were dry and bitter, but lacked the malt sweetness to balance it. I tasted some citrus rind and herbal notes at first followed by the dry biscuit-like flavor of the malt. Towards the very end I got a flash of bitter hops, but it was very subtle and short lived. The body was med/full, the carbonation good and the acidity high. Nothing much to speak of."
"D: a very drinkable brew, thirst quencher, you could quite a few of these. Another good one from Sam"
"Overall, you can put these down, but not really exciting me either. Not a bad beer by any means, just not knocking me back with any aspect."
"Pours a clear yellow colored body, big fizzy bubbles, with a good sized white foamy head, but diminishing. Has a very bitter aroma, not too malty, effervescent, but not very strong. Sweet malty taste, refrehing taste, a little dry."
"A nice even and well balanced not a bad Pale Ale."
"Poured into a pint glass a light yellow tan color with a slight haze, looked 'thin'. Left a very light head with some lacing. Smelled better than it looked, nice floral hop smell yet not overpowering. Again tasted better than it looked, mildly hop for a pale ale, which suits me fine, almost 'dry'. I thought this was a good pale ale, could easily drink several at a sitting, a pity only available in a sampler pack"
"D - This is a very approachable beer. It's like the girl at the party that you know you can hook up with, so your confidence is off the charts. She's cute, but she's not the head cheerleader, so you aren't scared of rejection at all. Maybe she's not the hottest girl ever, and maybe she's not the greatest conversationalist, but she's a good, if unmemorable, time."
"Closer to the British style in the malt flavor. Slightly tart and quite dry. The hop finish is brief and not very pronounced. Good body with a high carbonation level."
"Drinkability- A good sessionable pale ale"
"Brown bottle served at the aunt and uncles. Poured a gold color, with a white head that thins to a floating cap. Some thin lace is left on the glass. The smell is bready malt with earthy hop fragrance. A bit metallic taste, with a good dose of hops. Some balancing roasted malt. The mouthfeel is a bit on the light side, good carbonation. Easy enough to drink, flavor was alright, but nothing really stands out. Decent, no complaints, but nothing special either."
"Serving type: bottle"
"D- Refreshing with no nasty off flavors to detract from drinkability"
"3.3/5"
"D: Overall a moderately hopped pale with moderate flavor and drinkability."
"Nikki"
"Pours a shadowy yellow with a thick, foamy head that leaves a cloudy lacing down the glass. Smell erupts from the glass- citrusy, strongly beerish, but I think I detect a little skunk. Looks very fizzy. First taste... Not skunky at all. Actually very good- not nearly as fizzy as it looks, very malty with some hop presence detectable. Finishes with a burst of light citrus and leaves a hoppy aftertaste. Really surprising, I didn't expect all that much from the beer but it delivered, well balanced despite some of the other reviews here. Might not be your cup of tea but it's a must try."
"Pours a light gold,looks nice,with a solid white head. Nose of citrus,and hops. A very light crisp beer with kind of a watery mouth feel,light citrus,and malt flavor,finishes with a very nice dry hop taste. A nice beer for those hot summer days."
"Very smooth. I liked this beer a lot. I was impressed. Drinkability was very high. Nice beer."
"worth a try"
"A good, clean no-nonsense Pale Ale. It could be likened to a hoppier, fruitier Boston Lager; the basic malty nature is similar at least. The malt balance agrees the with English hops. Good flavor, but light in overall flavor magnitude - perhaps this is the calling card of English Pale Ale compared to American, but I'm guilty of liking beefier beers. If I was in the mood for a light English Ale, this would do nicely."
"Pours a slightly cloudy gold with a thick, two-finger head that slowly receeds and leaves some lacing. A hoppy smell is prevelant but there is a good, somewhat sweet malt smell in the background. Smooth and fluffy, well-carbonated medium-bodied beer with a pronounced citric and rustic hoppiness and some sweet malts like caramel or honey in the background; finishes smooth with a slightly dry backbite. One of the better Pale Ales I have had."
"This beer pours a hazy pale orange color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into nice fluffy lacing. The aroma is of floral hops with a touch of honey, and a nice caramel and toffee backbone. The taste has everything the aroma does, but it is all just a little quitter. The mouthfeel is a touch lighter than medium bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, this is a nice English Pale Ale. I could easily drink this again."
"And by my initial first taste, I will probably never have it again. I wanted so much to like this beer, but it has such a watered down, adjunct flavor that it was impossible. Thin, very lightly hopped, almost no hops. Very BMC'ish in the flavor. Very tough to finish."
"Drinkability: Great, smooth drink no bad aftertaste."
"This was a very good beer. This beer actually went well with Hummus! ! This is one of the better of the Sam Adam beers that I have tried. Got in a variety pack offered by Sam Adams for summer drinking. I will be buying this beer again. I know this is a great beer because I cannot stop thinking about getting it again."
"This and the cranberry lambic are the 2 worst Sam Adams beers in my opinion. For being barely over 5% ABV, the alcohol is way too noticeable. Also, not very much of a hop or fruity taste considering it's a pale ale. I tried a few bottles of it and each one was the same but I'm hoping this is some sort of freak thing. One of my favorite breweries+favorite styles=terrible beer?"
"D - A fairly drinkable pale ale. A little too clean for my taste though. I want a bit more oomph."
"D - Not a good or bad pale just pretty average."
"I sampled this beer from the Sam Adams summer mix pack. The beer pours a pale yellow with a mild hoppy smell. The taste is sweet at first with a mild aftertaste of hops. I found the beer to be highly drinkable. This beer is very solid English pale ale. I would defiantly buy this again. This would make a decent session beer."
"Good beer. I've got a bunch of really excellent beers right now, and a bunch of Sam Adams and Sierra Nevada as casual drinkers. This Pale is probably my favorite Sam Adams. Its not a very complex taste, but it tastes good. The smell and taste are very pleasant and it is very easy beer to drink. I always say Sam Adams makes a great all-around lineup of easy drinkers and generally flavorful beers, and this is no exception. Recommended."
"12 oz. bottle. Pours a dark yellow/golden color with a fully diminishing little, white head. Aroma is mainly citrus, lemon, and maybe grapefruit with a slight malt/grain. Flavor is mainly the same, a bit acidic, citrusy with a bit of bread. A forgettable beer."
"Aroma is mostly hoppy, fruity but not that strong or particularly complex. Same can be said for the taste, which shows a modest hoppiness, a little above most macro lagers but not really all that appealing. Unless you are trying to use this to build someone into craft beer, avoid."
"This is a nice Pale Ale but sort of blends in with lots of others I've had."
"Drinkability: An easy drinking ale, a bit more bland than I expected."
"Being a New Englander I am really surprised I have never tried this beer. They do however market the hell out of their Boston Lager and Boston Ale and I guess I can see why. Ended up picking up a six pack of this in Florida. Funny how that works. Pours a clear looking golden color topped with a moderate head. Citrus floral aroma with hints of light malts. The hops take a back seat to a stronger malt flavor. Some carmel and mild hop bitterness but not much. Pretty light and refreshing. Overall a decent beer but I wish they made an American style Pale Ale with a stronger hop profile."
"The beer poured with an extremely clear, golden slight-amber appearance with a thin island of lacing on the head. Aromas were subtly rich with citrus hops. Not too strong, which is a good thing for some. However, it definitely could have had more volume. Good clean and dry taste. A thin, slightly watery sweetness with a good load of spiced hops to it. Mouthfeel could have had more of a kick but the watery aspect of the drink helps it be refreshing and not overpowering. Overall, a decent and accessible pale ale."
"D - A little underwhelming, but not undrinkable."
"Grass and minerals... otherwise has aspects of a nice reserved English Pale Ale. Don't want more though."
"D - If I didn't know any better I'd think that I was drinking a flat ginger ale... I hate to be rough, but this brew deserves it... On par with a BMC..."
"D: While not the best example for the style, this is a very drinkable Pale Ale."
"This was pretty standard, not too much out of the ordinary. The appearance was sort of dark for a pale ale. The aroma has a subtle hint of malts which seems uncommon for pale ales and so that was nice. The flavor is pretty much wheat, a little citrusy, a very little malt and hop. Mouth is pretty light and it's easily drinkable. Nothing special but not bad."
"Pours a really subdued crystal-clear yellow. I mean it looks thin. Average off-white head. Not much foam or lacing. Aroma has some faint bready malt and flowery hops, more like Noble than grassier or earthy English hops. Flavor is a bit thin with some malt and flowery hops again, but no earthy malt tones or grassy hops that are found in English pale ales. Mouthfeel is thin but the drinkability is definately there. This tasted more like an American blonde ale and nothing like an English pale ale. However, this would make a tasty alternative to your average industrial American lager."
"I consider Sam Adams to be one of the ""gateway"" breweries, something I'll have when it's the only good beer available. I rarely buy their beer when I have choices. This one is quite unexceptional. The appearance is a little pale (I know. ""pale ale"" - but not as deep a hue as my usuals). The taste is OK, but there's a macro sweetness hiding way down in there. Also, quite watery. You certainly can knock a few of these down, and it's definitely above the ""Bud line"". However, either a Liberty Ale or a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale will blow this away, for about the same price."
"O - This was decent, not as bitter as other pale ales I have had but easy to drink nonetheless. Very good to drink one after another after another..."
"Notes: I'm drinking this one with the dregs of a delicious tilapia curry my girlfriend made today and some store-bought naan. This ale is strong enough to stand up to the spices without being strong enough to knock them down. It's definitely a pairing I will be making again."
"just strait avrage, strait down the middle, not good not bad, this was a tuch hopy and the malt was nice but with all the outher fine products that sam has this just gets lost in the shuffle. i would drink agan if it were their but wouldent seak this one out."
"Taste is a good mix of malt and moderate hoppy bitterness. Not too heavy, nice carbonated fresh mouthfeel."
"The aroma was pleasant. The two hops listed on the bottle Fuggles and East Kent Golding gave it a grapefruit smell along with a mix of malt. The taste was crisp and smooth and the maltiness stayed quite a while after. The malt and hop brightness played together well. I found this to be a great session beer and would buy again."
"Overall, I wouldn't really finish this beer but I'd give it a try again sometime if it comes in a mixed pack but I won't search this out again just for itself."
"D: Goes down easy being so light. I could see this being a decent ""gateway"" pale ale, as it's balanced between malt and hops and doesn't go overboard with a lot of flavor from either."
"drinking this beer was slightly more eventful than drinking a budweiser. i just cant help but feel that they used some unidentifiable hop adjunct instead of real hops. honestly, i probably wont buy this one again."
"D - This is a pretty good pale ale. It really reminded me of something from Samuel Smith's not Samuel Adams."
"Purchased this beer as part of the Sam Adams summer variety pack. I poured the beer from the bottle into a pint glass. The beer is a golden orange golden color and the head disappears quickly. The nose is biscuty and hoppy and the taste is well balanced and follows the nose. Pretty good offering of pale ale, not the best, but good none the less."
"Medium yellow colored ale with a thick foamy head that fades slowly.Aroma is toasty malts.Taste I can best describe as a faint buttery toffee.There is not a lot going on here but it is refreshing and smooth.I would give this beer another try and recommend to my buddies."
"One of the most stand-out Pale Ale's I've had in a while that I can really remember. Started out with an average white head that was mostly diminishing. A nice clear body with a golden orange hue. Carbonation was normal. This aroma stood out by the dominance of the yeast over the hops, unusually for Pale Ales. I got hints of dough and banana. The palate was incredible, a nice medium to full body that was creamy in texture, soft carbonation, and a finish that screamed bread (my favorite). The flavor is a little subdued with light bitterness but long finish, I think this adds to the drinkability."
"Overall, a fairly drinkable ale. Not the best example of the style, but it is still good. A tasty beer to drink a few of and not worry about flavors, balance, esters, etc. Plus I'd say it's a nice beer to try and get some BMC drinkers to branch out a bit - though perhaps that is what they were going for when brewing the beer."
"D - Average beer. Not even close to the pest Pale Ale i've had."
"pours a light yellow with a big head that fades to lacing pretty quickly. the aroma presents a nice bit of malt up front with a bit of hop background. the taste is much the same with a nice sweet malt up front and a dry finish, with the medium body and decent carbonation it goes down pretty smooth."
"Decent beer."
"Overall- A little light on the flavors but enjoyable and easy to drink. A good addition to the summer variety pack."
"Body is medium, slick, and quaffable. Probably one of their better summer beers."
"Darker golden color than I expected in the body, topped with two fingers of white foamy head. Pale Ale's retention isn't as durable as I'd like, but not bad on the whole. Fruity hop aromas exude, a bit light on the malt. Certainly English-style pale ale in the taste and texture--hops present, blending with a creamy caramel malt texture and not dominating, smooth rather than gritty like a heavy American IPA. Good and solid, though pretty straightforward."
"Beautiful looking beer. Nice dark gold with thick head that sticks to the side of the glass throughout the whole beer. There's a sour hoppy note in the aroma. Sweet malt detected as well. Flavor directly reflects the aroma. There's a lingering slightly unpleasant aftertaste that makes me give it a 3.5 instead of a 4 for taste. Good pale ale. Not my favorite style but this is a good one if that's your thing."
"D- Very easy to drink, nothing out of the ordinary here."
"Samuel Adams Pale Ale tends toward the lighter side, but it is certainly not devoid of taste. It has a certain earthy hop presence and there is even a touch of apple in the taste. In these regards, it holds pretty much true to the style. I would prefer a little more body, but the taste is actually pretty good and the beer is super- clean. It's nothing exceptional or particularly memorable, but it is still an all- around good glass of brew."
"D: Light and refreshing. Would be very drinkable if it wasn't for that lingering aftertaste."
"Pale Ale flavor. Started off smooth and tasted of hops and wheat. Ended with a dry fading bitterness. Very good mouthfeel. This is a very good brew and could drink these all night with a nice plate of spicy wings."
"D - I really like tasting this again after a few years have gone by - the flavor is refreshing and this is a well made tribute to the English style Pales w/ an American twist. I would certainly drink this quaffable ale again."
"Drinkability: Very easy to drink. Wouldn't mind beer bonging a few of 'em."
"Recommended..."
"D: It's fairly drinkable, but totally disappointing from the taste and aroma fronts. Nothing bad here, but the good is hardly noticeable. One of my least favorite beers from the SA lineup."
"D- it is definitely one to try to get a feel of what pale ales taste like. easy to drink, but I'm not sure if I would want to go to town with this one."
"D-Not the very 1st APA i would reach for but this is definatly one i would pull out for somone just starting into the craft beer scene"
"I would probably pick this up a couple times a year if it was available in 6'ers."
"It doesnt really seem like an English Pale Ale though, the yeast strain doesnt seem right, nor is it malty enough. Though the hops seem to be at pretty good levels. Still a decent beer, whatever style it may be."
"D: Very. Nice session beer. Easy to drink a few."
"Sparkling clear amber color makes a average sized white head. Some lacing and mostly diminishing. Light malt aroma with light hops, flowers, spruce, and orange. Some acidity and bitterness up front becoming much more bitter at the finish. Light dry body. This one becomes bitter fast."
"D: very drinkable, this is a great session beer, or to kick back on a hot summer day."
"While not my favorite pale ale as for pure taste, but it takes the gold for balance and refreshment in my book."
"They go down pretty easy... there's definitely nothing offending flavor-wise to get in the way of the drinking. A good light summer brew!"
"D: Inordinately sessionable."
"This is a bit weak in the mouthfeel, but finishes pretty clean."
"D = A drinkable English pale/ESB type beer, but more or less average for the style."
"I'm an SA fan, but this has been the 2nd so-so item in the Summer pack for me."
"D: A beer I thought would be better than a lot of the made in England pale ales since it would be fresher, but all and all pretty pedestrian. Wouldn't have a problem drinking it again if I buy another summer mixpack, but wouldn't buy a sixer of it."
"MF&D - Medium bodies ale with good carbonation and a creamy mouth feel. A very good summer/session ale."
"Over all a drinkable beer, but I expect more from Sam Adams."
"Drinks easy, got better as it warmed, a decent EPA. This would be a bit of a dissapointment as an APA"
"pours a piss yellow/orange with a limited white head that leaves quickly. Nose is almost nonexistent, but there is some slight metallic maltiness. Taste follows with weak malts and extremely weak hop flavors. I understand they were going for an english style pale ale here, but my god the hops in this are pathetic. The Fuggles and EKGs are barely noticeable at all. I taste more hops in boston lager, by far. Mouthfeel is thin and slightly undercarbonated. Drinkability is very poundable. Overall this may be the weakest attempt at an english pale ale I have yet tried. It does however have its place in the summer pound it as fast as you can on a hot day mix pack that it came in."
"D- I figured I can't go wrong with a Pale Ale so I picked up a box of this to try and I couldn't get through more than 3 of them before unloading it on friends. This beer taste like a pale lager more than a pale ale. The one-dimensional malt flavor was clean and dominated by corn notes and the slight bitterness of hops really didn't have any flavor or aroma to support them. I understand that a pale ale is not and IPA but this really had no interesting malt qualities. I would give it another try if it was on cask but not in bottles or tap."
"An ok pale ale."
"d: Run of the mill pa in my opinion. I expected more from Sam Adams. To its credit, the balance is quite good and I could see myself drinking several in one sitting."
"A good beer, but not to style, and not what I was expecting from an APA."
"The beer pours a clear golden color with a fizzy light tan head. A clean nose has mostly mild malts with some fresh hops. The taste is also malt strong. Some nice citrus hops, but I would like to see a little more. A medium body passes well over my palate. A drinkable brew, but closer to an English pale ale."
"D- A good summer beer. Doesn't have too much going on for it in the way of excitement though. The use of English hops in an APA seemed different though."
"Pours a nice golden, slightly murky. Small head with even lacing. Smells a bit hoppy with hints of citrus. Very balanced, light-to-medium bodied. Has a slight 'tinge' to it. A very good light beer, I like it better than their Sam Adams Light. I'd recommend this in the summer. It's nothing too exciting, but a good beer."
"This would be a good cookout beer, where there's burgers and dogs to stuff in your pie hole, and you're more concerned with just having a decent beverage to wash it down than something for your tastebuds to ponder. The only problem is that it's probably not worth the Sam Adams price."
"D- This isn't a good representative of the American Pale Ale styling. For the stereotypical APA, I think of sierra nevada, and this simply is a bit more of an english pale, and not a great one, that an APA. I really can't see myself having this again."
"Drinkability & Notes: In my opinion not a great APA. Could use a different hop profile and a bit more malt. Would definitely choose the Sierra Nevada over this one as well as the Sam Adams Boston Ale. There are just too many good beers to waste time and money on this one."
"D: Even though it was a bit light on the hops in my humble opinion, this was still a smooth easy to drink brew and was rather enjoyable. I nice summer brew on the back porch."
"D - Not a bad one to throw back all night, but certainly a little boring and uninspiringing."
" The feel was smooth and creamy. Some light bitterness and decent carbonation. This is a session brew and worthy of keeping it in stock. I will buy more and I like this so much more than the Boston Lager. Good aftertaste with a nice dry finish. Job well done Sam Adams."
"pours a nice slightly dark gold from a 12oz bottle. Really rich foamy head with cool lacing. smells hop sweet faintly pine maybe honey or something i can't describe. Taste is not bad it's sweet pale malt with some decent bitter hop after taste. not really sure how much i like the hop structure, but thats just me. I may be spoiled on Sierra Nevada. but this is not a bad beer. i think there's something about Sam Adams hops that i really don't like most of the time. i don't know what it is about the hops they use in most of their beers, but for me personally, i don't like them. I do like some of their beers though. like the black lager. but again, I find myself comparing every pale ale to sierra nevada.. sorry, bad habit i guess :)"
"Its appearance is golden yellow with a good white head that makes nice lacing. The aroma is light with sweet honey and light roasted malts. The hops are light in the nose adding some faint floral notes. There is a smooth malty flavor up front that is lightly roasted and sweet with hints of caramel. The hops are earthy and add a delicate bitterness towards the finish which is crisp and dry. The medium body and easy carbonation give it a creamy smooth mouth feel. Overall it's a very good easy drinking beer."
"Pours a golden orange,with a thin white head. Excellent retention,and lacing.Aroma is of light,hops and some grainy malts. Body is light with some carbonation. Taste is smooth,and lightly hopped.Nice buttery carmel finish. Very easy to drink. Recommended."
"Samuel Adams Pale Ale pours yellow with a white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is extremely subdued. The flavor is pleasant, it's very mild by American standards, it's hoppy, but not like a beer from the Pacific Northwest, more of an English style pale ale in that regard. Nicely balanced, very drinkable."
"D: good beer, I'd have again. I've had before."
"Good, nicely balanced brew that would session well. I would look for this again."
"Beautiful color. Great taste. One of the better IPAs I've had in awhile. Well done, Sam Adams!"
"An opaque, almost rusty golden brew is capped off with a slender, innocuous off-white quickly fading head. Aromas of sweet malts, candy, and grass rise to the nose and make for a very unique smelling APA. Tastes a bit earthy up front and covered with a good malt/hop balance before fading into a subtle creamy/surypiness. Not too bold, very drinkable, and different is about all I can say. Would come back to it, but wouldn't make a concerted effort to do so."
"A decent pale ale that would go great with a lot of food, and is also a drink that you could have all night. Deffinetly an easy beer to drink, but not the greatest pale ale"
"Pours a clear light orange with dense head. Nice retention and tons of lacing. Smell: floral and faint citric hops, bready and a touch of butteryness. Taste: floral and earthy hops, toasted malts, grain. Light but pleasant flavor. Smooth mouthfeel with light carbonation. Makes a very sessionable pale ale."
"Drinkability- This beer needs food. Like a nice pizza or pasta I think. It's a great palate cleanser for those heavier dishes."
"Good but not great; pleasant appearance and flavor with good carbonation and a nice bitter finish. An easy-drinking beer-- if lacking 'oomph'."
"D - Go get a good pale ale and don't worry about this one. The appearance was the most impressive thing about this brew. Maybe the hop crisis is taking a toll on this. I expected more from Sam Adams"
""
"D: I would rate this as average... Nothing about this beer stands out to me as a solid choice every time I want a Pale Ale. Its good for every once in awhile, like most beers. The flavor is good, but not fantastic. Just Average."
"This beer is not often available in Ohio. I picked up a bottle in Detroit this week, and am now chugging it from a Sam Adams uber-glass. The beer is brilliantly clear, golden colored, with a neutral aroma more malty than hoppy. The taste is neutral-to-sweetly malty, nothing offensive but then again nothing spectacular. Easy to drink but nothing TOO special."
"drinkablility is good. this is a drinkable pale ale, which contains enough variety in its profile to warrent a second bottle on a good night. a solid example of an American Pale Ale. cheers!"
"One of 6 different SA beers in a sampler pack. This was definitely my least favorite. Honey golden color with a medium sized white head. Smell was a light honeyish malt smell, with very weak hops aroma coming through. Taste is quite bland overall, with mild bitterness, very light sweetness and simply not quite enough flavor. Not awful, but I wouldn't get this again. I'm starting to get the difference between EPAs and APAs, and I much prefer the American style pales."
"D - Very drinkable but also very weak for a pale ale. Compared to SN this one can't stack up. Great beer for a beginner at the APA category, recommend for that only."
"Overall impression: Certainly not a thrilling beer, but a solid offering. Nice combination of malt and hops makes it highly drinkable."
"Smooth beer that goes down quite well, could see myself having a few rather easily and while I only bought one in this mix and match six pack, wish I would've bought at least one more."
"D - Very pleasant and super easy to drink. Mild flavors work well together. Nothing dominates or stands out, but everything is well-balanced and flavors blend nicely."
"medium bodied. good carbonation all the way down. no lace. good session beer. i like this beer. i would drink it again if on sale again. good british style pale."
"Pours a light amber color, almost a golden lager color. It does have some nice head and excellent lacing. It has a nice crisp hoppy scent, with a bit of dryness to it. A great APA flavor, a nice hoppy taste without going over board. It goes down well. Probably the best ""almost-macro"" and affordable APA I've ever had."
"The beer's color appears a hazy orange in my glass, topped by a fuzzy straw-like head. The aroma has some caramel undetones with a tart lemon backbone. now to cover my palate with this liquid...there's something, but something seems missing; the overall flavor seems to go blank on the palate for few brief moments. When I find something, it's a little fruity in taste with some doses of biscuity malt. A trace of mild hop flavor is there, but requires some searching. There are no off-flavors, but seems a little weaker compared to other pale ales."
"Taste is also pretty light on the hop bitterness for an APA, fairly crisp tasting, tad bit too much carbonation. Nothing overly special about this pale ale, needs more hoppiness."
"Pours a clear yellow color with a short white head with a good amount of lacing on the sides of the glass. It has some pale malt smell with some hoppy finish at the end of the aroma. The taste is pretty good for a pale ale. It is not as hoppy as other pale ales, but it adds to the drinkability that way. The pale malts are a good sweet base that the hop bitterness finishes off at the end. But since it is not that hoppy, it is more of a sweeter pale ale. The mouthfeel is very good as this is a nice smooth beer with a perfect amount of carbonation. It is a very drinkable beer as it does not have alot of overpowering flavor."
"D - This one is different than other APAs bot its still an ok brew not the best offering from SA but I was able to enjoy my sixer"
"Decent, drinkable, but not brilliant. The beer pours a rather lightish orangy yellow with a very slight head. The retention, if at all, is around the periphery, and lacing is non existent. This is a moderately carbonated, dry, light bodied, British style Pale with plenty of prickly mouthfeel. The smell is malty, dry grass, some citrus, a wet grainy aroma overall. The taste is clearly dry, not much sweetness to this beer at all, which makes this much more a British pale than a characteristically fruity Pacific NW style pale. The dryness is what is most pronounced here. There is a grainy, somewhat sharp, slight tartness in the middle, that rounds out nicely in the finish. It's a refreshing beer but not one I would seek out far and wide. The aftertaste is pretty slight, but so is the beer's flavorfulness."
"Overall, this is a decent APA. I wish it had just a bit more substance to it."
"Found this in my father inlaws garage fridge and grabbed a few to take home,poured into a standard pint glass a light clear golden with a tight pillowy one finger white head that settled nicely into a creamy mass.Light lemon and toasted grain notes in the nose mainly,quite clean on the palate hints of lemon, faint leafy notes,tea, with that underlying toastiness.Kinda ho hum flavors but its not bad,it could appeal to the people trying to venture into ale territory but for me just average."
"Pours into a golden clear with a nice fluffy head; kind of mirange looking. The head goes away and leaves a skim of bubbles. The nose is mild. Maybe a hint of malt but not much worth reporting. Taste is kind of boring but not bad. Not much hops with some malt and hops at the finish. Medium carbonation on the tongue; a little seltzer like. This is tamed down Samuel Adams. Mouthfeel is average and not annoying. Easy to drink but not very strong flavored. I tend to like stronger flavored beer regardless of the style. This is OK to drink but not remarkable."
"Hops used gently in this one, unusual for this brewer. This beer is a little on the ""light"" side for a PA, but good for a session and would probably be very acceptable to macro drinkers."
"Drinkability: the mouthfeel and carbonation help to deliver a nice clean taste. The ingredients and their quality give this beer a different feel than your run-of-the-mill pale ale. I wish this beer was around more often in my area."
"Opaque yellow with a bid of off-white head. Beery heesy smell, mostly. Medium or lighter mouthfeel, balanced bitterness and malt, though more caramel sweetness and grassiness. Fuggles there but they haven't added much to the experience. A fresh drinkable but not exceptional beer."
"D- This isn't too bad. Easily accessible and not a bad option as a session beer."
"Drinkability: After the previous gut-wrenching gluten-free ""beer"" I just punished myself with, this beer tastes like a beautiful dream!"
"D- flavorful but not overwhelming, moderate ABV"
"D: Not the best pale ale that I've had...nothing to remarkable, but at the same time, not horrible. Probably wouldn't go out of my way to find this...but if I was offered it, I certainly wouldn't turn it down."
"poured this into my new boston lager glass compliments of BBC and the Bros. poursa very pale lager-like color with a small head that leaves little lacing. some faint smells are present, some malt and some fruity hop scent but also lots of water. taste is the best thing about this beer. it doesn't look or smell like much but it does have a decent taste to it, while its an average pale ale its not up to my standards. needs a richer malt flavor and a tad more hops. mouthfeel is a bit watery but thats ok, easy to drink beer, just not alot of ""umph"""
"A suprise for me from Sam Adams. Although I enjoy a numer of BBC beers, I somehow had the impression that their stab at a Pale Ale might be a little boring. I was wrong, although this will not excite your inner beer geek, the beer has enough hoppy flavors and crisp bitterness, all kept in good balance, to make it interesting and drinkable."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a golden orange color with a white head that leaves a pretty decent amount of lacing around the edge of the glass. Not much malt in the nose, just a touch of caramel and citrus hops. Like the aroma, there is not much in the malt department with some citrusy hops in the dry finish. Mouthfeel is light and slightly fizzy from the carbonation. Overall, this is a decent APA but it does fall a little short compared to the other great Pale Ale's out there."
" Overall this was easily the most sessionable out of all the ones in the mixed pack. It was just very light but had just the right amount of fruitiness or hoppiness to get you to really wanna put down a few. Now dont get me wrong there are a lot of very fine pales out there that this cannot hold a candle to, but for what it is I really have no complaints. If you see it around you could definatly do worse and I would say go for it and give it a shot. Proabaly very nice on tap indeed."
"Pale Ale style. Mellow and tasty."
"This is more of an EPA than an APA. Not a bad pale ale but by no means a memorable one."
"D: Definitely a drinkable beer. Nice malt to hops balance. definitely a good brew. Seemed more like an English Pale Ale than an APA with the initial taste of malts, but the bitter aftertaste brings the American out of it."
"Pours a healthy pale copper color with a full creamy white head that holds a bit in the tulip glass. Aroma is very pils-like, noble aroma, spice and rind, but not frighteningly hoppy in intensity. Taste is solid, toasty malts, hoppy up front, not too much caramel dominating, and malt hop balanced...the malts are the body, and the hops ride it. I must say the hop flavors seem out of place for some reason...they come across as strong but a bit out of whack with the malt somehow. The yeast seems to be adding little to no character that I can tell. mouthfeel is full and on par, overall this is a likable beer, one I'd grab on tap, but not one I'll stock or buy again. I think there are better out there..albeit it in a tough style to nail with a trademark flavor. And I guess I'd just rather drink the boston lager if I'm gonna have a Sam, comparatively."
"Pours a sparkling even gold color with an inch of frothy white foam. Looks good. Classic SA sweet toasted malt notes in the aroma. Light, clean, almost creamy fruitiness and a subtle spiciness from the hops. Taste follows the smell pretty closely...sweet, toasty, herbal, finishing with some earthy grain. Don't be fooled, this is no APA. All English hops were used and pretty lightly too. Nicely balanced, light bodied, and mildly bitter. Not bad all around, just don't expect a big citrusy ale. Simple and sessionable."
"** winter 2010 - i'll probably never come back to this, as there's too many other beers to try. i'm re-adjusting scores to be more fair."
"Unfortunately there's not much that impressed me about this beer aside from it's average appearance. In all honesty I tried one of these following a pale ale from one of the CO breweries. This beer just had no distinctive qualities . Light on every aspect. Being from New England I try to support our locals but Sam Adams continually seems to disappoint me. Sorry."
"Golden pour with decent white head that lasted for a little while. Mouthfeel seemed a bit on the thin side. Aroma and taste was a nice balance between the hops and malt, though personally I would have enjoyed more hops. Not bad,nothing I would seek out, but I wouldnt refuse it either."
"Drinkability of this beer is pretty good. I certainly wouldn't turn it away if offered. This beer is definitely worth a try."
"Just a tad watery in appearance, and the head was a little less frothy than I expected, containing what looked to be a lot of larger, less-regular carbonation bubbles. Both smell and taste were just a hint muted; without the sharp, hoppy cripsness I enjoy in the finest beers of this style. Where the taste did come through, I picked up on pine nuts and bay leaf. The finsh was a little thicker & stickier than I prefer. I enjoyed my drink more than this review is probably making it sound like; but compared to the gold standard of the style (Sierra Nevada Pale Ale); well, there's no comparison."
"This is a very good brew from Sammy A. All about hops and flavor and not using off color techniques like in the Cherry Wheat. Very good brew and one of the best from Sam Adams. Very well done."
"Not a taste bomb, but its not supposed to be. This could also be a nice transitional beer for your macro friends. Check it out."
"Nice golden color with a moderate head, quickly dissolving with good lacing. Hoppy smell, moderate malts. A well balanced and easy to drink. Mouthfeel is general, maybe a bit better than most. A great beer, yet another good example of Sam Adams genious."
"Tastes malty, in line with the gingerbread-cookie tasting hops. Ends with a mild orange flavor. Well balanced. Grassy hop floral and arromatic oily rather than rough and clingy. Some toasty and bready character in the malt. Strong carbonation lifts the liquid off the tongue, leaving a gentle metalic and sweet on the tongue. Hoppy aftertaste is retronasal without me even trying. Woody dry hops in the aftertaste detract from my interest to quickly pull another sip. Mouthfeel is md-thick, which is thick for the style."
"-Oelergud"
"The mouth borders on being a trifle thin, but the is a bit of oiliness that pushes it just above average. This is not one I would search out, but it would be a good intro to the style for conversion candidates. Part of the 24 pack summer sampler."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with plenty of carbonation that lends a nice creaminess. Fairly well spot on for a pale ale making it easy to consume. However, this one just ends up being a bit too underwhelming for me and doesn't have the hop profile I like in a pale ale. I'll be passing on this one next time."
"Despite my reservations about the beer style, this is a very drinkable summer beer. I could easily see myself drinking a few on a hot summer day."
"Pours a soapy head, unlike in the Sam Adam's tradition and it fades quickly. No lacing left down the glass. Those are two disappointments and the third is, the lack of hops. You can taste faint hops, but they fall short. That's the bad news. I must tell ya though, Sam Adams is THE BEST large market out there, at least in the u.s. The beer goes down very smoothly, you can drink a keg in one sitting and what can I say, just a smooth, easy drinking, summer ale. Can't complain there."
"Part of the summer variety pack. Poured into a pint glass, it was a dark yellow with a medium head and a little bit of lacing. Aroma was some sweet grain, not anything else. Mildly hoppy taste. While it was crisp and refreshing as advertised, I didn't think it was that outstanding."
"Very light pale ale. Not what I look for in the style. Basically the same as the aroma, very pale bready malts with floral aromatic hops moderately bitter. Finish is short and to the point. Could have used more flovorful hop varieties."
"A big, huge wave of bread comes across the flavor first, and then a malty, light syrupy flavor washes away any interesting flavors that could've shown through from the grassy and earthy hops. To be honest this is the first APA I've had that's unbalanced in the OPPOSITE direction, leaning much more heavily toward a bready malt than a citrus or fruity hop profile. Overall it doesn't work for this beer, leaving an uneven taste in my mouth. This isn't a beer I'd buy a six-pack of."
"Light and clean on the palate but smoother throughout then expected. Well balanced. A very pleasant surprise being that I was not expecting much. Still however, I can't help but feel like the flavors were somewhat geared toward the mass' taste in bland beers which would explain its very mild approach. Still a quality pale ale."
"Poured from the ""Brewmaster's Collection"" bottle into my DFH tulip pint glass, the SA Pale is a light clear amber color with a one-inch, bubbly head that leaves some faint traces of lace as the beer recedes. The aroma is fruity and herbal, giving off a nice, but faintly medicinal, floral bouquet. I also get a strange, but not unpleasant, licorice scent here as well. Weird, but I like it. It tastes light and fruity, with a slight hop presence. Clean and crisp with a dry finish. Mouthfeel is sturdy and just right for this beer. I wouldn't go so far as to say this is a great beer, but it's a good beer and would be a nice change of pace beer from time to time. I haven't seen this beer out in bars or restaurants much, so I don't know when I'll have it next, but I would definitely like to try this on tap."
"Overall this is a good beer, nothing too exciting but very sessionable nonetheless."
"Pours a light golden brown color with an average eggshell head that dissipated into a decent cap. The smell is of malt, a bit on the sweet side, and a hint of hops, not very distinct. The taste is of lightly toasted malt followed by some light hop bitterness. The hop taste is not very pronounced. A very neutral brew. The feel is light and moderately carbonated, finishes a bit astringent and bitter. A weak American Pale Ale but good for English Pale Ale standards, though not as sweet and a bit more bitter than the English counterparts."
"D: This is sort of a suprising beer, when I saw pale ale on the label I figured this one was going to be like all the other APAs out there (big hop hammer with bitter grapefruit and citrus) but this one seems to fit more into the English Pale Ale category as it relies more on the nutty malt character instead of the fruity hops. Nice offering and a sort of nice suprise but I've had better."
"Feels somewhat bubbly, not much substance after the fact. Fizzy. Nothing bad about it, but it's boring. It's not really a pale, but a bitter German ale that tastes more like a lager."
"Recommended"
"Flavor is of sour apples and boysenberry popsickle. Decent mouthfeel, nearly full bodied, and very pleasant finish. Nice carbonation. Somewhat drinkable but I can name plenty of better APA out there. Maybe I had a bad bottle but I was really disappointed and let down. I really like all of SA beers but this one is my least favorite."
"Light caramel malt flavor, slightly bitter finish, and easy enough to drink. Would be good crossover beer I would imagine..I say that like it's a flaw, but it's really not...just more soft, subtle flavors that won't overwhelm the casual beer drinker. Overall, no standout characteristics, but a pretty standard rendition of the style."
"If it hadn't said Pale Ale on the bottle, I'd have thought this was a blonde ale. Either way, it makes a nice, uncomplicated hot weather brew--refreshing as all get out and super-easy to drink."
"I liked this beer so much more once i let it warm just a bit, much better that way."
"drinkability - I always enjoy Sam Adams, this came out of the summer pack."
"Pours a dark orange with a frothy white head. The head smells like hops with some citrus and malt notes. This beer is more subtle than I thought it would be. No real standout flavors, yet it delivers as a decent beer. The taste starts malty with the hoppy and mild citrus flavor finishing it out for a nice balance. Not much bitter comes through probably from the balance with the malt. This one could use more flavor, but is refreshing for a summer beer. The mouthfeel is good with nice carbonation. This is an easy drinker, not offensive, but nothing spectacular. An easy beer that anyone can enjoy."
"Mouthfeel and driniability are decent and on par for the style."
"Mouthfeel is kind of rocky. Something about the taste presentation just doesnt flow right in this one. Not a bad beer, but there are lots better pale ales out there. Maybe a beginners pale alI. I like most of sam adams offerings better than this one."
"This wasn't an outstanding beer, but it was quite enjoyable."
"D - Crisp and refreshing but seriously handicapped by it's weak nose and flavor. This is really not a very good beer. I expected more from SA. I could, however, drink quite a few of these. As a bitter, this would have scored higher."
"But where's the extra hoppiness that I expect in a pale ale? I don't know, the beer seems like a macro brew. A little overly carbonated and thrown together. Decent, but average at best."
"Drinkability: They should make this a year-round 12-pack, because I think it'd be a nice switch up from some of the others. I really like this brew, and I'm glad I have another bottle. Nothing too crazy and not a lot of risk, but flavorful and balanced until the last drop."
"I tried something new with this beer: It was sitting in my fridge for about a week and beers are almost always too cold to drink coming straight out of my fridge. So I set this one in the drain of my sink and ran warm water over the bottle for about 30 seconds and alas, the beer was elevated to a more suitable temperature. I would guess mid to upper 40's, rather than the 30 something degrees that it was at earlier."
"Part of the Sam Adams summer pack. Poured from a 12oz. bottle with freshness date on side, into a pint glass. The beer pours a light pale orange, forming a fluffy 1 inch head. Medium rings of lace stick to the glass. The aroma consists of floral hops, along with a light sweet malt aroma coming through. The flavor is citrus hop flavor, along with the sweet malt creating an almost light caramel flavor. This is the first pale ale that I've noticed to have really good balance between hops and malts. Normally they either are predominantly hops or malt, but never equal. The mouthfeel is medium, but not as smooth. Very flavorfull pale ale, with a good abv. This is a drinkable ale worth having during a session. Overall, I was pleased with this. Not knowing what to expect, I can say I was suprised and not disappointed."
"overall this is an enjoyable beer, but not nearly my favorite APA"
"Eric"
"12oz brown bottle with a best before date of September 2007. Pours a crystal clear deep gold with a 2 finger head that faded rather quickly, but had decent lace. Deep honey malt aromas with a slight citrus smell mixed in. Upon first tasting its a big honey malt followed by a subdued hop flavor finishing with a decent mix of the two. Pretty evenly balanced. Not a ton to think about here, but thats what makes it nice. Lots of big bold flavors but they are very straight forward and blend nicely. A nice session beer."
"Its not bad, just on the bland side, will avoid in the future."
"D: Why buy this when there are so many others in the crowded APA field."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Light bodied and extremely drinkable. Carbonation is excellent. I could session this with no problem. Overall, it's a good beer. There's better APAs out there, but this one is pretty good."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, this one seems to lean toward the English style Pale Ale. I could drink several of these in an evening, but I would probably want something with a little more of a kick to it."
"Drinkability: Sure its ok, but doesn't excite me at all. There are just way to many better pale ales available. I can drink it, but would not seek this out again. I would pick many other Sam Adams beers before this."
"Fairly thick and full feeling while avoiding heaviness. Carbonation is just high enough to be refreshing but doesn't approach soda territory. Almost perfect in this area which is strange given the beer's other shortcomings; I've had many beers that tasted better and yet struggled with mouthfeel. Weird. The body, in fact, makes this a sessionable beer if the taste was your thing. I'm fully aware that as an English style pale (I know BA feels otherwise) this should not taste like a typical hoppy American pale ale. That said there's nothing to say that an English PA should taste musty and stale as I feel this does. I'm hoping this was just a bad bottle because I expect quite a bit more from Boston Brewing Company."
"Drinkability: there is nothing offensive about this beer that would stop you from drinking it, but the other side of the coin is that there is nothing distinctive about its taste that would make you want to come back to it. If you're looking for a SA ale, I'd say that the cask Boston Ale is a superior choice in terms of complexity and satisfaction."
"D - goes down very easy."
"The taste has an earthy flavour up front followed by some sweet malt and some citrus hops midway through and through the finish but they are lightly done. Too lightly done for me, darn it."
"Samuel Adams Pale Ale was a bright amber-gold color and very clear. It had a white bubbly head that stuck around a while, leaving some lace behind. The aroma was english hops with some sweet malt. The taste was a nice balance of hops and malt with a dry, somewhat bitter finish. It was medium in both body and carbonation. Drinkability was good. It's a good pale ale, but the flavor is more English than American."
"D- this is a good drinkable pale ale. Its probably a good transition beer too."
"This was a part of the 12 pack summer release and knowing that I had not had/reviewed a few of the beers I thought I would give it a try. The brew poured to a golden yellow color with a thick off white head that had a good amount of retention and left chunky lacing down the side of the glass. The aroma is subtle and seems to highlight a toasted malt like characteristic as well as a strong hop presence which seems to be somewhat floral. The taste has a slight sweet start then breaks to a hop presence that seems to give it a earthy tone. The flavor also seems to break to a slight metallic flavor that does not mix well IMO. Over all this is an ok brew from Sam Adams, not what I was expecting. This brew should probably be classified as an English pale rather than an American."
"This Pale Ale pours a pale color. Aroma is somewhat fruity with few hints hops and a malt backbone present. Taste is about the same as the aroma. Too much of a malt presence though a pale ale should never be too hoppy, this one lacks anything remotely hoppy. It's not bad I suppose but I have had much better examples of this style."
"A solid, easy-drinking yet flavorful english-style ale, however nothing about it is exceptional."
"Actually a good amount of fruit, a hint of a fuller creamy mouthfeel, and finishes with a dry hop bite - not too assertive, which may please or displease. It's certainly an approachable beer.. The aftertaste is fairly long lasting, somewhat bitter. It's very easy to drink but still has a decent mouthfeel that goes down light. Didn't blow my socks up but it's a tasty if light APA (more biscuit than hop, kind of seaside feel to it)."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability: my least favorite Sam Adams so far"
"Easy enough to drink, but bland/boring. Nothing really stands out. This is clearly an English-style (not APA), as the brewery claims, and rated as such. A mediocre English-style pale ale."
"The saleman at The Anderson's did tell me that this and the Cream Stout were their slowest sellers so hopefully SA will someday come out with a new and improved version."
"DA: This is just a fantastic session beer, easy to drink and hard to get sick of."
"So it didnt feel that nice drinkin anymore then one of these , If I was sammy adam's Id sell this stuff 25 cents a beer. Stay away!"
"12 oz bottle best by May '07, pours a clear golden amber with a finger of fizzy white head that quickly subsides to a ring, leaving just a slight amount of lace. Aroma is a nice clean light malt with a slight bit of floral hops. Taste is more of the same, a crisp clean malt, slightly toasted, overlaid with a gentle floral and earthy hoppiness. Nothing spectacular, but a solid tasting easy drinking pale ale. Mouthfeel is alright, but a little on the thin side. Picked this up because my go-to pale ale wasn't available, and I'm glad I tried this, it's one Sam brew I'd buy again."
"I'll buy it again."
"This was a very quaffable beer, very smooth and easy drinking. It might not ""wow"" anyone, but it is a well made representation of the pale ale style."
"Overall, I didn't like this beer, although given the characteristics, I can see why some people do. But if this is your first beer, or first American (somewhat) Pale Ale ... expect it to be difference."
"12 oz bottle from Florian's. Light amber translucent body with a quarter iinch of off-white head. Aroma is dominated by hops with a little malt. Tastes hoppy overall, with some roasted malt. Medium bodied. Very drinkable and pleasant. What else can I say? Much better than expected! I like it, definitely be getting this one again."
" No matter what, it's worth a buy."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle. Nice adequate head. Nice golden color. Smells of muted malts and a bit musty. Could have more to it as far as smell is concerned. The taste is pleasant but light hoppiness, not what I've come to expect from an American Pale Ale. Overall, decent, but Sam Adams has better brews than this one."
"Would be a good session beer."
"Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is my bench mark for comparison to other Pale Ales. I bought this since I like pale ales. I must say that the first sip took me by surprise, and not in a good way. The aftertaste was a little off by my standards for a pale ale. The smell is ok and the mouthhfeel ok. In comparison to ther pales I've tried, this one will rank lower. However, it may suit someone else's taste. It really isn't a bad beer, just not for me. I like the more bitter after taste of SN, plus it is a bit spicier."
"Pours a clear golden yellow color, nice carbonation, nice little creamy tan head which quickly disappears, nice lacing afterwards. Scents of hops, malts, and spices. The taste is hoppy, and kinda sweet, with a nice clean finish. Medium body. Very drinkable, another very tasty brew from SA."
"This is easily a sessionable brew."
"Above average for a commercial beer, but try Sierra Nevada if you're looking for a good, easy to find APA. I just don't get the Sam Adams appeal."
"Tasted: 08/08/06"
"Pours out a filtered orange brown, with 2 fingers of head off a hard pour. Good lacing as the beer went down. The aroma was dry, with notes of citrus, a little banana, and hops. The taste totally did it for me: banana, a pleasant, crisp apple flavor and just the right amount of bitterness, which gave it nice balance. It felt...clean. However, the cleanliness made it feel a little watery, too, but mostly it was fine. I could and will consume more of this brew."
"Cheers!"
"Overall, the best feature of this beer is its refreshing character and the overall crispness of drinking it. This is a beer to drink to get intoxicated, or to quench thirst (as you would do with cold water). You certainly won't be drinking this beer for its oustanding flavor, but it is decent nonetheless. Worth a try."
"Jen: Samuel Adams seems to always be a good, keep in your fridge, kind of beer. This one just adds to the decent brews they put out. There is a nice blend of ""not the usual"" hops here which gives it a different taste than other pale ales. It has a lighter body with a fair amount of carbonation, making this an easy to drink, and easy to like beer. This light, refreshing brew is a great addition to any summer BBQ."
"Pours a shade of yellow with particles in suspension. Head is thin, and dissipates rapidly. Aroma is on the sweet side for a pale ale with a hint of floral hops peaking through the malt. Taste follows the aroma with the hops playing a slightly larger role. Aftertaste is mildly bitter with an earthy character. Lackluster by any American pale ale standards, but not offensive. Looking closer at the bottle, it lists East Kent Goldings and Fuggles as the hop varieties. Drinks much more like an English Pale ale than American."
"I have to recommend sampling this beer with some sharp, cheddar cheese. Other hard cheeses would probably be tasty, too."
"Like I said, this is by far one of my favorite (if not my favorite) pale ale out there. If you are looking for something that is an overwhelmingly hoppy beer, this is not for you. If you want a pale ale that has a fairly light to medium mouthfeel that is well balanced, this is your brew. I'm looking forward to having a few more of these this Labor Day Weekend! Cheers."
"An enjoyable APA. Pours out to a golden hued color with a nice head of white foam that calms at around 1/2 inch. Medium carbonation. Aromas of dry hops, grains and a light maltiness. Not bad. Taste is fairly dry, with elements of grain, dry hops, herbs, fresh veggies and a leafy woodiness. Interesting. Mouthfeel is nominal, with a touch of hop oil on the tongue. Drinkability is pretty good. A nice summer offering, that would pair well with fall months as well. Worth a try."
"D: So based on the buttery component, I'm guessing this is more an English PA than an American one. It's easy to drink for sure. I'm not sure how to score this at all. While I prefer more hops in my PAs, I'm not sure docking points here is wise, since it's not an American style (read: hoppy) PA to begin with. I'd have another."
"This beer just has a hop taste that is really unpleasant. The beer looks a little lighter than a typical pale ale. The smell is bittersweet. The taste is just a hop bitterness that is not a good hoppiness. There is a harshness to the beer. The mouthfeel is overwhelming bitter. A bitter beer that is not smooth. Below average in the style."
"Drinkability is great. A very refreshing brew. The flavors and balance make this an enjoyable session choice."
"not what i expected from a sam adams brew. Its an amber almost honey color and has a strong bannana smell. The beer is very sweet and not hoppy whatsoever. It seemed more like a lite beer with little taste then a pale ale. The bannana is so overpowering (and I dont like bannanas) I could barley drink it. Very dissapointing"
"Flavor was malt with very little hops. I was beginning to wonder if the 6-pack was mislabled, but I don't think I'll buy another to find out. Just another disappointment from Sam Adams as far as I'm concerned."
"D-I would have no problem drinking many of these. If my one of my macro lovin' buddies had this on hand at a party as an alternative, I would be very pleasantly suprised and then looking for a ride home."
"While Sam Adams beers generally do not rate at the top of the great beer lists (try as they might to make us think theyre craft brewers), most are pretty decent. Unfortunately, this Pale Ale was way off the mark. Had the golden orange appearance of an APA, but there was little aroma, a bland appearance, and a short, stale finish. Ill rate this above your BMC macros, but not by much."
"This is an outstanding tasting session ale. It's a very different take on the style, but a very good brew. Somewhat similar to Highland's St. Therese PA."
"Served from a 12 oz. bottle with a November 2006 freshness date. Poured a clear, golden yellow with a thick white head. Heavy lacing on the glass. Smells of bananas and floral hops. Taste begins with hints of honey at first, then some pleasant maltiness on the tongue, and finishing with some late-blooming hops. Light carbonation and flavors leave this beer lacking a little character, but it's refreshing and easily drinkable overall."
"D- pretty mellow brew, good flavor throughout entire consumption, quite enjoyable, without a doubt sessionable. I wouldnt turn this beer down, but i wouldnt go running for it. Well brewed and a good English pale, dont get me wrong."
"Drinkability - could drink a few in a night; doesn't fill you up"
"Overall, a very solid pale ale. I think this one may be a little under-rated because Jim Kock does commercials now. This one is always a safe bet and is available in most areas that generally specialize in the BMC crowd."
"Notes: Ummmm this should be in my stable at all times. Perfect on a hot day and enough character to be consumed on any occassion. I believe this is the best ""year round and year to year"" beer that they make."
"Most of the pale ales that I have had have been so off-putting and/or blandly plain that I reject them offhandedly. But with Samuel Adams I expected what I got: a smoooth and I reiterate smoooth beer with none of the acrid aftertaste of listerine in the bite back. Like a good melon that you can lick the sweat off its forehead and then bite into the fruit without reprecussions of bitter or brunt. Then again those other pale ales could double as holistic urine therapy for the incurably sick."
"Attractive golden color on the darker side. Sweetish malty nose, not hoppy like I'd expect. Smooth, unintrusive taste. The first impression I had of this beer was that it seemed to be more in the English Pale Ale style. The beer had some of the metallic characteristics of other English pale ales, like Samuel Smith's. This is as good as any other Sam Adams beer, but also what some people may interpret as being middle-of-the-road and forgettable."
"M/D- Medium bodied with moderate carbonation....definitely a session beer."
"D - Easy drinking and pleasant. More of an English style Pale Ale. Multiply the intensity of the flavor by 2 or 3 and we have a winner."
"I've been looking for this particular beer for a while now and have never been able to figure out why it's so hard to find. I would think that an easy drinking English pale would be one of BBC's most widely distributed offerings. In any case, I give them credit for not releasing yet another Cascade-hopped APA (even though I love them). Too bad that this one doesn't have a bit more charisma."
"Pale golden in color-has a nice head that is gone by the time you set the bottle down from pouring it. Slight hoppy aroma-very faint. Ok malty flavor with a slight balancing hop flavor. No real hop presence to define it as a US Pale Ale. Good body-perhaps its best characteristic actually. An ok beer-I am a big Sam Adams fan but this one falls way short. Just really never gets off the ground in any way, shape or form."
"The color was a nice yellowish gold. The taste up front was sweet--a hint of honey. The aftertaste had a synthetic essence and was very disappointing. For three second this was a great beer. If it were not for the aftertaste, this would have gotten much better results."
"Drinkability - great to have a few throughout the evening, but remember moderation."
"The taste is hoppy in the backend with a small amount of malts in the frontside. I don't get much from this beer, but, it is an easy drinker."
"The taste is surprisingly mellow, not as hoppy as I would have expected from an American Pale Ale. I actually enjoy the flavor but have marked it down .5 on taste because it doesn't even remotely fit the style that I think of as being an APA. (as in the hops should be bold enough to smack you in the face) This should be called Samuel Adams Golden Ale or maybe Samuel Adams English Pale Ale."
"Much more toward the golden side of golden-amber. Sparse carbonation; meager dishwater-suds-colored foam cap. Slight fruit and spice from hops in the aroma -- sorta bleak, to be honest. Taste is firstly fruit (peach/citrus juice), then bitter orange acridity, followed by a toasty biscuit malt finish and an earthy-fruit aftertaste. Certainly seems to be more of an English Pale Ale than a hoppy American version. Mouthfeel is lively with nicely attenuated carbonation -- probably the most impressive aspect of this beer. Drinkability? Eh, I guess, but there are so many more Pale Ales out there (both English and American) that do the job with more style and flavor that this one just oughta be passed up more often than not. Worth a try, I suppose."
"Note: Similiar to the Harpoon Dark, this SA-Pale Ale on cask surprised me and could very well be the surprise/best beer of the night IMO."
"I prefer a bit more hop in an APA. A good beer nonetheless, but not a great example of the style."
"D - this is high due to its sweetness, i could see it being very easy to pound"
"Cheers2beers"
"mouthfeel is fair. about medium. nice dry finish keeps it drinkable. recommended to fans of English brewing. overall better than i expected."
"I would never go out of my way to get this beer but in certain situations where maybe you're in a bar or liqour store in some depraved part of the world where this is the only alternative to Bud, Miller and Coors then it would be an ok option."
"Tastes of light roasty and a bit nutty malts, semi-sweet at first, then tones down to a bitter, astringent finish. Feels good in the mouth, a little creamy, with light in body and carbonation as well. It actually tastes pretty good and fits the style. Nuthin fancy, just an easy drinkin, average pale ale from a big craft brewery that's consistant."
"D- I wouldn't drink it again, but I'm glad I tried it. Definitely not the best APA. If you can find it, go for the Berkshire APA or EPA."
"It's beer. That's about all you can say. Nothing outstanding, but not much wrong. Lacking of character when compared to other great Pale Ales. Lightly toasty, yeasty, and spicy, but not enough to make a statement. Aromas are light, but refreshing. Flavors are a bit bland (maybe I've been spoiled with bigger pale ales.) Caramel and barley malt in low levels. Hops add a light metalic luster. Light and refreshing body with crisp carbonation. Finishes lightly dry and airy with a mild sweetness. Good beer, just don't expect much."
"This and the Sierra Nevada are my favorites of the APA style"
"I liked the way this beer looked, a nice golden color, pillowy head. It smelled like nice too. Nice bready malts and a sour hops note. Tasted the same. Good English style pale ale. Felt light a crisp in the mouth. Wasn't very filling. Thought it was just a good solid beer. Exactly what I was looking for last night. I could and will definately drink this again. Probably will drink a lot of this again."
"Poured into a standard pint from a 12 oz bottle. A golden amber color with a solid white head, sporadic lacing. Nose is of malt, with some lighter flowery accents. Smells like an English pale, not an American ... malt dominates the taste as well, with the hops only appearing as an aferthougth in the over all taste profile. Moderately sweet and medium-bodied. A pretty good English style pale ale, which is not among my favorite styles, but an enjoyable beer none the less."
"This beer pours a golden orange with a frothy white head that doesn't hold well or lace well. The smell is a mixture of sweet citrus, light berry fruits (maybe cherry) and hops. The taste seems to be quite similar. I would prefer the sweetness to be toned down in this one in favor of some more bitterness. The mouthfeel is a decent thickness and carbonation. Overall it has an above average drinkability but it is not fantastic. There are better Pale Ales out there."
"12 ounce bottle, best by June 2006 notched on the label. Pours a pale amber orange color with a thick white head. Very nice spicy hoppy aroma, just what you would expect from a pale ale. Taste is also on the hoppy side, but not over the top as is the case of some other pale ales. A good solid offering from the guys at the Boston Beer Company."
"Drinkability  surprisingly good. Its a sophisticated product. Id love to sample it on tap. I have to remember: its a PA not an IPA. It drinks easy, but its flavor is too calculated, not sufficiently bold. Itll do, but I wont pay a premium to buy this one again. Sam has aimed for the middle of the PA spectrum, and, while acceptable, it lacks distinction."
"This is a quality brew, just nothing about it seems to stand out."
"I am not sure why the top of the bottle proclaims ""brewmaster's special", because I dont think any brewmaster would want their name associated with this beer. Its extremly weak and the hops are virtually non existant. It looks just like regular Sam Adams, with the translucent gold color. To me, it tastes as if they've added something to the malt that gives it more of a hop flavor, but its hard to call it a pale ale."
"This pours a clear golden color with a smallish tan head.The smell has a slight hop and malt aroma,but it is pretty faint.The taste has a hop bite as well as a nice malt flavor.The carbonation makes this a very bubbly beer with some citrus flavors.The m/f is light,but it's a little watery going down.All in all, this is a very good beer fron Sam's."
"All in all, somewhat watery, weak and lifeless. Im disappointed in Sammy, their offerings are usually better than this  Id go for many other P.A.s before this one."
"Pours a clear, clean golden colour with foamy white head and active carbonation. Smells of faint hoppiness with some grainy malts as well. Flavour is similar to nose: A little hoppiness with malt being the dominate feature. Overall just an average brew. Nothing fancy or impressive about it at all. I've only had a couple of their offerings, but I havent been impressed at all with this brewery from Boston. I will, however, try some more of their beers, as it is a respected brewery."
"a very nice light ale, perfect for when you want a very refreshing beer with good flavor but not something huge. very quaffable and a nice interpretation of the style in my opinion. i will definitely be buying this again."
"There's nothing really to say about this brew. It's drinkable, but very simpe and average overall. I'd like to see the hop flavour kicked up more to give this one some bite. Can I recommend this one? No. Can I say avoid it? No. Try it if you want but don't expect much in return."
"This is an average pale ale, and much better than the boston ale. It has a decent hppy aroma, and a good hop and malt balance. It goes down smoothly, and leaves a crisp bitterness behind. Definitely not nearly as smooth as a lot of the pale ales I've had before, but still good."
"Smooth drinkability, very light flavor and finish for those hot summer days."
"The beer pours a gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice malty scent that boasts of pale, light crystal, and roasted malts. It has a fruity quality as well as a wonderful English hop aroma. The taste is great. This is what I like about the English style pales. It's malty with a smooth, dry finish. The hops add good balance and it attains a slight fruitiness. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is quite possibly the best beer these guys brew. I like everything about it."
"Exceedingly drinkable. This is NOT another cookie cutter APA full of grapefruit and pine flavor and scent. This is much closer to a Pilsner in bitterness and hops used. This beer is all about the hops, satisfyingly bitterness and very well dry hopped. I did not expect this beer to be so tasty; this is now my favorite Sam Adams brew!"
"Notes: this is a good beer. Not intense, but has a bit of flavor. Also goes well with bar foods, chips and such. The sulfer kills this brew."
"gold colored with a thin white head. 'earthy' hoppy smell with a little malty sweetness. good amount of hop bitterness, with a chewy caramel honey-like sweetnes to back it up. a little thin in the mouth, but nothing get bent out of shape about. overall good drinkability, and worth a try, but for the most part nothing special at all."
"Pours with a bubbly white head. It settles then reforms now and again. The body is a beautiful gold. The nose is fruity at first, fresh rasberries.. then a honeyish malt aroma. Good taste, something barely estery.. it's a nice element although it doesn't remind me of any particular fruit. The finish is only mildly bitter and that will add a point to the drinkability."
"I'm not sharp enough to pick up that East Kent Goldngs and Fuggles were the hops used in this one but I do know enough to taste a stab at the classic British style pale when I taste one. Very well done, in the style of Bass way back in the day. Subtle and well-crafted."
"Easy drinking, but not exciting. If I want an American pale, I'll reach for a Sierra Nevada or Sweetwater."
"This beer isn't doing much for me tonight. Something seems a little off with the flavor, or maybe this beer is made differently than the APAs that I've had. Anyway, the color of the beer is amber with a large, semi-creamy head. Smell is fairly hoppy, but has a generic quality to it. Flavor is sweeter than I thought it would be and less hoppy. Usually the APAs I've had have more bite in the hops department. The sweetness is a little too strong, but is only bothersome in the finish. The middle of the sip is well-rounded, but not complex and full enough for me. Still, this isn't too bad of a beer, just something seems a little off here. I won't be getting this in the future, I've found APAs I find much more tasty."
"This ale poured a clear, light amber color with white foam that settled but clung to the glass a bit. The smell was very modest: lightly malty with a touch of grain. The taste was lightly malty with a hint of citrus and a slight tanginess and medium hoppiness, though the hop bitterness did linger. The mouthfeel was smooth and dry with medium body and medium-low carbonation. The aftertaste was lightly malty with a lingering mild bitterness. This was an OK plae ale, but nothing to go out of your way for."
"Overall this is a nice Pale Ale, but there are much better American craft beer options out there for this style."
"Appearance: Copper slightly hazed nice creamy white head leaves nice even rings of lacing. Aroma: Bready with citrus pine edges not bad mellow but nice. Taste: Very nice semi sweet breadiness with flowery hop flavor with a good amount of bitterness, simple pretty reserved English style pale ale. Mouthfeel: Medium body carbonation is solid no complaints. Drinkability: Damn fine session brew in my eyes, not much to say balanced decently hopped ale."
"Would make a good session-er if a tad fresher."
"Overall Impression: Just not floating my boat. Given all the good pale ales out there, Id have to say give this one a pass. Im on the edge of a drain pour with the rest of my glass. Guess I was in the mood for an AMERICAN pale ale, not an English one."
"Overall a good solid beer, a nice rounding out of their offerings."
"This beer poured a medium copper color with a small fizzy pale head. Lots of bubbles rise to the top. Little lacing. It was almost too dark for a pale ale imo. The smell was very floral and hoppy. I could almost get a crispness from the smell of this beer. The taste seemed a little too one-sided to me. The hops were very flavorful but not really bitter at all. The malts seemed weak but ones that were there were toasty. The finish is quite crisp and refreshing. This was a decent beer but nothing to get too excited about."
"very nice ale. nice balance between full bodied and smooth. intricate taste, sort of unusually pale, but it's good. somewhat reminds me of spring ale, but a little more bodied. hard to find this here anymore but i woulden tpass it up when i do. never had a chance to try it but im sure it would be a great tap beer."
"Nice 1/2"" white head on top of the light amber brew. Slightly hoppy aroma, rounded out with minimal malts. Taste was upfront pale malts, and balanced with a crisp hops bite. Actually, a bit more balanced than I would expect for a pale ale. Mouthfeel and drinkability were both good, placing this brew in the ""lawnmower/thirst-quencher"" category, in my mind."
"Medium bodied."
"Another brew from Sam Adams that doesn't get enough of respect I think. Poures out a light amber color with a good amount of carbonation. Smell is on the sweet side a little bit. Some hops are there but it's mostly malts with a very slight toasted aroma to it. Taste was malty in the beginning with some hop bite blending in the middle and lasts all the way through the end. Aftertaste is mostly that hop bite that seems to last quite a while. Solid brew."
"An all around, above average brew. Appearance was a light caramel gold with a very nice head and very nice lacing. Smelll was distinctly malty with a ligh hop undertone. Taste was lightly sweet followed by lightly tart on the finish...smooth. Mouthfeel is smooth and medium-bodied. Smooth qaulity lends itself to very easy drinkability. A definte warm weather pleaser."
"Pours a clear, amber body with a two finger, offwhite head that demonstrates good retention and laces the glass with considerable patching. Aroma features pale malt, a hint of caramel, and a restrained, but evident, English style, herbal/floral hops note. Mouthfeel is light bodied, and has medium carbonation. Very mild hops bite on the tongue. Taste is of a well balanced, British style, pale ale, similar to Bass. A sweet malt backbone is balanced by a subdued, but pleasant, hops presence. Don't expect an American style, IPA here. This is nowhere close to a hoppy, SNPA, but compares favorably to a Bass Pale Ale. Finish is clean, and slightly dry. Drinkability is very good. A very nice alternative if you're faced with a limited selection in a store or restaurant."
"taste: mild pale ale with some noticeable hop flavor and grainy character makes it more flavorful than bass, but milder than snpa. good drinkability with some lingering hop bitterness, and light mouthfeel. good alternative for light beer drinkers that may not scare them away."
"Pale gold, medium white head, some retention, some lacing, very clear. Spicy and slightly earthy English hops. Lightly biscuity malt. Nice simple malt character with complementary spiciness and light orange peel. Finish is grassy and herbal. Crisp and light feel, very drinkable, very nice, rather distinct. Impressive."
"Sam Adams Pale Ale poured a fairly clear gold with a lasting creamy head (about one inch high). The lace was very good. The aroma was not as strong as I was expecting. It was mellow, floral, citrusy, with a bit of maltiness. The taste was also not what I anticipated. It was a litle laid back with nice hop flavor, some sweetness, caramel, and decent hop bite. The finish was dry, and a bit sweet with some hop flavor. Overall I found it to be milder than what I was expecting in a pale ale. Nonetheless, I enjoyed it. I found it to be quite drinkable and subtle enough to go with a variety of foods."
"This Pale Ale is dry from start to finish. I would have liked a little more sweetness, but will still enjoy it."
"Overall, a brew I found to be only marginally above the average. Drinkability is decent but I'd have liked it better if it had a stronger malt profile."
"Golden color, medium white foamy head. Aroma is fruity and sweet. Medium hoped, medium malts. A nice hoppy pale ale. Good balance of hops and malts, with a crisp hop flavor. Finish is very clean and crisp. Aftertaste is very hoppy and slightly bitter yet smooth."
"Pours a nice golden orange color, about two fingers of quickly dissipating head, but some lacing throughout. I liked it quite a bit. Many American Pale Ales have quite a bit more hop bitterness than English Pales, but not this one. The aroma was pretty strong and I was expecting a pretty big bite, but the taste was very well balanced. Pour a Sierra Nevada and a Bass together, and you'd probably come pretty close to this beer. Maybe it caught me at the right time, after a hot late August day on the golf course, but it really hit the spot. Great summer session brew."
"Another slightly better than average brew from Sam Adams. This one poured a pale golden with a creamy off-white head. Smell is of metallic hops and slight malts. Taste is nice, not too sweet, bready malts up front, witha pleasant hop finish. Not too hoppy, or malty. Maybe I'm crazy, but I swear there is a lemon-tart component in here. Not my type of pale ale."
"It feels very nice. Easy drinking and not heavy. A great ale when a person wants to have more than one or just to sit back on a warm day and relax."
"A good summer drinker with burgers, dogs, and all the fixins!"
"Drinkability is, again, about average. There are difinately worse beers out there but there is also many better ones. Why waste the time."
"The smell is malty and slightly sweetish. Nice. A caramel front gives way to a full, deep, malty middle with some caramel and a little chocolate at temperature. The finish is dry, a little nutty and shows some buttery toffee. Overall, this is good."
"An all-around good beer that tastes much as it looks - refreshing and flavorful. This beer poured a hazy amber with an ample 2 finger head of creamy ivory. The head is long lasting and creates very good lace affect. The nose is a bit light but gives off some malt, a trace of hops, and a small sense of citrus - not much. The taste leans to the malt side and starts a bit sweet. The hops do balance the malt very well and the finish is dry without any sense of bitterness. Mouthfeel is moderately full and creamy. Very drinkable pale ale - I like it."
"Color is opaque, light yellow, small white head with very light, sandpaper, misty like lacing. Smell is faintly bright hop thats a touch on the citrusy side. Taste is mildly smooth, has an immediate little bite that fades quickly and lends itself mostly bright and clean with a a dry bittering effect thats very subtle, not bad at all. It trys to be hoppy but is a little on the weak side but very tolerable in the drinking department. Feel is bright and dryish with a light tipping toward a medium body. Very drinkable and mildly smooth. I was pleasantly surprised that it was better then it looked. Not a favorite but not a turndown by any means."
"A light orange in color with a faint head that will stick in patches throughout. The aroma is rather dull and faint, light hops, some orange peel are to be noted. The taste of hops, and somewhat bitterness up front, some light, roasted malts noted with banana clove in the background. This was more on the bitter than pale ale side, somewhat subtle in taste and flavor, finishes creamy and dry, slightly above average, not one of the best beers produced by the BBC."
"Pours thick with a typical Samuel Adams head. Smell is very hoppy, with malt accents. The Taste is malty and sweet. I don't know if this is what a pale ale is supposed to taste like. Overall, a pretty decent beer. The problem I have with Samuel Adams is the the beers all taste pretty much the same. I drank this out of a sampler, and after a few they all tasted the same."
"This brew poured a clear golden color with a half inch white head and tons of bubbles rising to the surface. The aroma was very hoppy with a grassy smell also a little bit of citrus and not totally void of malts. After that wonderful complex aroma I was expecting a wonderful complex taste but I was wrong. I felt the taste was very thin. The little taste that was there was sort of flowery and grassy. There just wasn't a lot going on with this brew. Hard to pick out any specific flavors, maybe because there wasn't any. The mouthfeel was okay with a nice amount of carbonation. I doubt I will puchase this again but I would take one for free:)"
"The beer as it sets in the pint pounder a crystal clear golden amber with the head large and white, the lace adequate to cover the glass. Nose is crisp and fresh, lightly floral, but malt dominates. Start is lightly sweet, the top light in feel, the finish strikingly acidic, the hops pertinent to the style and a darn good session beer any old time of the year."
"Pours a medium amber color with a creamy white head that dissipates into a nice lace. Floral hops come through in the aroma along with a hint of cinnamon. Nice balance of malt and hops in the taste up front with oily hops dominating the finish. Quite smooth and refreshing."
"Dark golden with a big-bubbled white head that settles, but stays slightly. It looks English. Aroma of mild ""English"" hops and grainy malt, that ""Sam Adams"" aroma. Flavors present are grainy malt and a bit of a hop bite from those ""English"" hops. Very crisp and dry. A bit bready in the aftertaste. Definitely English-style. Great ""less thinking, more drinking"" beer. Tasty, but not complex, and a good session beer. This was the first beer I ever purchased on my own, back when I was discovering good beer. I give it an honorable mention for that, and for introducing me to the rest of the Sam Adams line, which led me to try other ""craft"" brews, bringing me into the world of die-hard ""beer advocacy"". Great memories in this glass."
"I like English-Style Ales, but I thought this one was only slightly better than average. A nice, solid copper defined the appearance in the glass, but a thin head with little to no retention was a disappointment. I sensed a faint, hoppy, floral scent after a little swirling. The beer had a pretty good hop bite, and a brief lingering bitterness that disappeared a little too early. But I did like the mouthfeel...my tongue was left a little numb between sips. I'd gladly have a few of these in a sitting...it feels good going down, but overall this wasn't too much of a standout beer for me. A pretty safe pale ale, overall, but one can find better."
"Like I said, a good Bass contender...maybe Whitbread also.  The first American beer (with more to follow......I hope) I've had that even approaches an English ale profile."
"Another good brew from Boston Beer. Floral aroma with some hops in there too. Nothing special as far as pales go, but very smooth and very drinkable. Nice hop flavor that lets you know you are still drinking an english pale."
"A very drinkable, tasty brew. Nothing earthshattering, but not lacking either. Carbonation is just right. Aroma is a bit estery and alcoholic with soft hop character. nice balance of malt sweetness and hop bitterness. Goes well with spicy food, too.  I am sick of people bashing Boston Beer Co. Come on, admit that they are at least making (for the most part) quality beers with real beer character. I just finished the glass. I think I'll have another."
"pours out a clear light amber colour with a big white foamy head. lotsa lace, too. lightly malty and fruity in the nose. pretty dry and crisp with a definite english hop bite. little sweetness to be found. a bit crackery in flavour; would be a fine pale ale to wash down some food. body is light, and the mouthfeel is somewhat watery. finishes crisp and dry as stated before....very drinkable. overall an average pale ale...nothing stands out to make this version remarkable."
"Don't confuse Sam Adam's Pale with an American version. Boston Beer has brewed what is most definitely an English version of the Pale for our taste. A cobbled London street in spring brought to us by a leading brewer. Thanks again BBC, for a good distribution network, fair prices, and a quality brew."
"A little light on flavor considering the great aroma and autumn color. Not Sammy's best offering by any means but I actually like this more than their flagship beer. It is not as good as their Summer or Winter brews though."
"as i have developed more of a taste for pales, i found this one to be quite good. golden and smooth with a perfect amount of hops. this beer is a very good drinker, and it just simply goes down great"
"Less malt that in the Boston Ale and more hops. This seems to make it a pretty typically pale. The hops bite first (but only a little bite like a small fuzzy puppy going throught it's teething stage) hang around for a bit and then it finishes with a smooth malt flavor. Not unpleasant, but not as good as the Boston Ale."
"This pale ale was not quite what I expected, but it is good.  I was under the impression it was an APA, so I expected a nice bitterness and a stronger aroma.  It has a nice head, and a smooth flavor, but is just an average pale ale.  Perhaps I've been spoiled by my recent SIerra Nevadas and Burning Rivers.  I agree with some of the previous posts: an average beer from a company that could do more. Perhaps the bitterness is subdued to appeal to the mass market."
"Orange-copper body, topped with fairly smooth white head, which soon settles into quarter inch cover.  Fresh floral aroma, with some fruit lurking in the background. Fairly balanced between malt and hops, but hops stick around much longer in aftertaste. Run of the mill pale ale, from a brewer that can do much better. On the other hand, my opinion of this beer has improved since its introduction, when I thought it was more of a weak golden ale. Has it been reformulated?"
"The bottle says American, but the taste says English. This is a good beer in the style of those that you'd sit around and drink in the pub with your friends without thinking too much about the beer you're drinking. Amber colored, nice white fluffy head. Mild floral hop aromas (Kent Goldings), with a slight caramal malt presence. Taste is relatively tame for a pale ale, with quite mild hop flavors balanced by an unobtrusive maltiness. Finish is smooth and refreshing, if not entirely memorable. Again, a good beer to drink with friends if you really don't want to be thinking about the beer you're drinking."
"Not great, quite thin in the end, and it had quite a funky sort of flavour, a bit oily aswell and a bit soggy tasting, not their best."
"Okay, another confessional.  I am still trying to sample other Samuel Adams, but for the pale ale, my local brews outshine it.  Has a nice color and smell, but the taste is nothing that really moves or surprises me.  If is of course better than the macros but still far removed from my local pales.  I realize this is at a local, so maybe if I check out a tap version to what I am comparing it to it may do better."
"The Boston Ale is the bigger brother to this brew for sure."
"Aroma of musty malt and hops.  Light gold in color.  Interesting choice of East Kent and Golding Hops, (the style dictates cascade, williamette, centennial..etc..)  Slight cardboard (oxidation?) taste.in the finish.  The brew lacks real character next to the other high power PA's."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce brown glass bottle with a pop-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"Full flavoured pale ale leaning towards English style, good balance to make for a beer that one could sit down and have a few and not be overwhelmed in any aspect. An all around good pale ale and a decent stab at the English style."
"Golden in color w/ a slight haze.  The head is thin and unimpressive. Quintessential floral Kent Goldings notes dominate the hop nose, and the earthy Fuggles note is secondary.  Malt aroma is minimal.  It's quite similar to their Boston Ale in aroma profile having a slight butterscotch note, but is more mild comparatively.  Decent toasty malt flavors are present, but this brew is a bit lacking in malt character overall.  Hop bitterness is moderate and clean, with the characteristically earthy Fuggles flavor dominating.  It finishes clean but unexciting.  I wasn't left longing for another.  Although a decent beer, the lack of malt complexity deterred from its potential.  A British base malt such as Maris Otter would've been a better malt foundation."
"Nice and well-carbonated pour, clear pale yellow body. Fizzy refreshing mouth feel, pretty full and foamy with a more than adequate carbonation. There’s a lack of hop bite, nice sweetness, but still enjoyable. Very nice finish that is slightly dry, smooth with a nice crispness. Overall pretty good stuff."
"Very nice copper color.  Very nice belgian lace clings to the side of the glass the whole time.  The taste is a nice light ale, dry finish.  Would match well with chicken and other dishes."
"Hops are floral and spicy (and a tad metallic), not fruity.  Average finish.  Reminds me of Bass.  The Boston Lager tastes more like an American Pale than this brew.  Average mouthfeel and not a distinct finish."
"9"
"Something of a let-down.  Mild to the point of being too reserved.  Flavor was nice and clean, but it was mellow to the point of being bland."
"I haven't had a lot of experience with pale ales, but this one ahhhh ""pales"" in comparison to the one I had at the Green Mill restraunt in St. Paul...this is definitely on the dry side...almost spicey a bit on the finish..crisp..and pretty easy drinking...tastes very clean and crisp...certainly not a bad beer, but only slightly above average in my book."
"This is an average pale ale.  The hops are there, but lend mostly bitterness rather than flavor.  This isn't a bad thing, but there are other Pales out there, i.e. Sierra Nevada, that are better."
"Very smooth pale ale.  Probably one of the most mellow ales I have had in a while.  Not to say this was weak, just smooth and tasty.  I could many these at one sitting.  This is a nice beer to give to inexperienced beer drinkers; not intimidating."
"Good color, decent head.  Slightly sweet and hoppy aroma.  Clean taste, good flavor.  Well balanced.  A good mouthfeel and a nice aftertaste.  Overall a very good beer."
"and a tangerine flavour. not a favourite of mine but still enjoyable."
"Crisp and refreshing. A good entry level pale."
