"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is malty, bready. Taste is malts, some sweetness, a bit of fruit, light hops are present. Feels light in the mouth and overall is a smooth and refreshing beer."

"I liked this beer."
"Not a bad offering New Castle, rivals there Brown Ale."

"O-  I wasn't expecting much from this and got exactly that."

"Overall- I gave this an average rating, it did nothing for me.  I would drink this again if handed one."

"Overall (3.42) : Glad I didn't purchase a six pack of this. It's not a bad beer, but at $2 a shot, well...whatever. Their flagship beer is better. On to the next one! Getting crunked tonight!"

"A nice golden colored ale with a medium white head. Aroma is fruity, grass notes and grains. Taste is sweet toasted grains, grass with a bitter ending. Palate is medium body, crisp with good carbonation. Finishes with a toasted grain flavor, grass notes, fruity with a moderate hops bitterness bite and a bit of a nutty aftertaste as well. Overall nothing really stand out but still an ok summer brew."

"Flavor: pleasant combination with the sweet white bread malts along with a tangy, earthy hops. Overall: since this is a summer beer, I actually was pleasantly surprised at the hop characteristics. By no means is this a hop-bomb, but it has a nice bitterness that sets it apart from so many of the super sweet summer ales that are so popular at present."
""
"A perfectly middle of the road pale ale. Nothing really wow or amazing or different for that matter. Mainly bought it because of the name and label on it. I definitely prefer the darker Newcastle brews. Not much else to say about this beer...I would have liked a little citrus flair in there personally."

"Notes: Overall this one just didn’t impress me."
""
""
"O: I was pretty unimpressed with this beer, If one could return alcohol I would have. However this is a summer beer and I am trying it in October. I was unable to find a date on it, but If I assume it was bottled in April, May, or June then that would put the age at around 6 months. Perhaps I got a bad batch. The style is also not my first choice. Alas I may pick this up again next late spring/early summer and give it another shot, after all everyone deserves a second chance."

" A decent pale that drinks easily. A little thin and watery feel overall, but then it's pretty light in the ABV department, too, so this is a really good candidate for a session ale. What it lacks in body in does a fair enough job with flavor."
""
"Presentation: Packaged in a short twelve ounce brown glass bottle with a pry-off crown, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice."
"Cascade, Hellertau, and Northdown hops are in this beer and it just didn't work for me. The color and the aroma was ok. I really enjoyed the mouthfeel and the amount of bitterness this beer had but I did not care for the flavor at all. There seemed to be some notes of toasted malt as well."
""
""
""
""
""
"Light straw yellow, white head, no lacing. Apple, pale malt, and vinegar notes on the aroma. The taste is just awful, dominated by apple cider vinegar and cheap white wine. Its undrinkable. 400plus BA reviews and this is only my 3rd drain pour. Awful. Avoid."

"Sampled 8/8/13 in a pilsner glass from my home bar. Bottle was chilled to 36 degrees in my beer cooler. Pours a yellow/gold color with a 1-finger white head that leaves good lacing with each sip. The aroma is hops and sweet malts. The taste is close to the same with a hint of rice and a slight dry bitter finish. Overall, not real impressed with this one. I do like their regular ""Brown Ale"" and their 'Founder's Ale"" was better than this. Overall it was just OK."
""
"Pours a clear, gold color. One inch head of a white color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of rice, slight sweet malt, slight pale malt, and a hint of hops. Barely, barely, fits the style of an English Pale Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, pale malt, slight hops, rice, hint of wheat, and hint of citrus. Overall, bad adjunct aroma, good appearance, and better body than aroma, but still very poor."
""
""
"From a brown bottle in to a Newcastle Geordie Schooner glass. The beer is a clear golden color with a white head that thins out in a few minutes. The aroma is light fruit, white grape and pear come to mind with a hint of toffee in the background. Toffee flavor starts things out with the fruit flavors passing by finishing with a quick tart bitterness before being sticky sweet on the lips. The beer is crisp, light, refreshing and very easy to drink."
""
""
""

""
" The flavor is mildly malty with some light toasted grain in the taste with some light hop notes adding to the flavor with subtle sweet elements from the malt and mild yeast fruitiness but in general it has a somewhat gentle flavor profile befitting the style. I like this and would enjoy it again, but it would not be the first choice unless I was having for a lawnmower ale...it is pretty well suited for a quenching thirst slaking ale of that type."
""
""
""
"Overall, this beer surprised me. I've had some of the other Newcastle offerings and haven't really cared for them. I found this ale to be different from the standard Brit ale and American ale. It was a nice change of pace, pleasant and refreshing, and I would buy it again."
"Overall, not a bad effort from Newcastle on a light and summery brew. A bit better than I was expecting and i would consider picking up some more of this."
""
"O: I think this is an OK thirst quencher, but it has some flaws that will keep me from buying it again."
"Overall – The lightly bitter grass, lemon, and earth flavors at the end of the taste was actually rather nice for the brew and made for a nice drinking summer beer with a bit more earthiness then most."
"O: Sorry, I prefer brunettes and redheads."
""
""
""
""
"While not very distinctive, it is refreshing and quaffable for another humid summer day in the nineties. I am pleased to see Newcastle expanding their product line."

"verdict - extremely poundable summer beer if your looking for a lighter slightly hoppier summer ale. Not bad at all."
""
""
"D: light, refreshing while providing a decent amount of malt complexity. wouldn't have minded a greater hop presence but im not exactly sure how old this bottle is."
""

"Overall- Easy to drink but it is not memorable in any way."
"Grassy, musty horse blanket taste, very little malt taste. A little breadiness, but really, I expected more from a Caledonian beer. Somewhat thin, could had a little more to the mouthfeel, but overall, quite disappointing."
"Pours a clear gold with a foamy off-white head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and grassy or hay aromas. Taste is much the same with grain and earthy flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer that is fairly flavorful but has a slightly better smell in my opinion."
""
"o: Not as good as I remember from a year ago, but an ok summer refresher with enough flavor to enjoy."
"O - Worth trying since I'm a blonde ale fan, but this doesn't match up to Newcastle Brown or its blonde ale brethren."

"Pours a bright gold, perfectly clear, white head leaves a lot of lace. Aroma of noble hops and toffee. In the flavor, hoppy, some mineral. Bready malts. Honey lemon tea comes to mind. Faint mint notes. Refreshing. Light bodied with a low carbonation level, this drinks like water. A good session ale that hits the spot in the summer."
""
""
""
"To the Point: while not a lot of fun to review (not reviewogenic), it is easy and refreshing – tasty for a toasted lager or Pale Blonde; I would buy this again when I want a plain beer with a little flavor."
""
"Had on tap at the Corner Slice in Greensboro last night.Poured into a standard pint glass a clear light golden color with a nice looking sticky one finger bone white head atop.Toasted malts mainly in the nose,a hint of sweetness but not much.Crisp feel and toasted crisp flavors with a bit of iron as well on the palate.It's light and I didn't expect much but it went down real easy."
""
"O: A little tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, very mild kick, decent representation of style, it’s a sessionable beer but there are others in the style that I would choose first."
"Overall not going to get this one again but it was easy enough to knock back even from the bottle."
"RJT"
""
"Pours out to a thin white head that lasts and leaves bits of foam on the side of the glass. Color is a deep gold...a ""brassy blond?"" Aroma is sweet, buttery and slightly hoppy and estery. Flavor is a balanced mix of sweet grains, Cascade hop flavors and a pleasant, bracing finish. Mouthfeel is correct for style, nothing special there. This is a good beer, a solid choice. It gets tastier and more complex as it warms up a bit."
"O - This beer tasted better after I had left it in the glass for about half an hour. The baby needed to be bathed and put to bed, so I had to take a break. I would definitely allow this one to sit before drinking more of it, but on the other hand, I wouldn't really seek it out. Not bad, but didn't have any memorable positive aspects for me."
""
""
""
"It tastes better than it smells with a reasonable supply of grainy pale malts and clean hop ending. It is lot like a pilsener in that regard. Newcastle should be commended for trying new things but they would be better off sticking with what they do best - their classic brown ale."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: the more I drink it, the more citrus comes out. It's a fairly easy drinker."
""
""
"Atmosphere is okay. Nice hue, solid head, not much lacing. Nose is really pungent and almost rancid hop tone, with some sweet tea leaf and dish soap. The pungency really overwhelms the flavor profile. Soapy and leafy....? Overall, this is not so good a quaff."
""
""
"As I mentioned earlier, inoffensive but rather bland. Not a bad choice for a hot day. It's a pedestrian light pale ale."
""
""
"I see from the label that they uss e kinds of hops: Cascade, Hallertau, and Northdown. I've never heard of that last one."
"Not many really good blonde ales out there, but this one is very respectable. But, this is in fact an English Pale. Not as promising, style-considering."
"Apologies for the lack of style - this is my first review, hope to get better :)"
"Overall a good summer beer and and decently refreshing. It is in no way best of its kind but it isn't with out its charm. I can see consuming this to beat the heat of summer while not getting drunk."

"Single finger white head with some lacing on a golden hazy body. Aroma of sweet corn, honey, butterscotch and pale malts. Flavors include Pale malts, grassy hops, honey, butterscotch. Light body and moderate carbonation. A recently released seasonal and what they say us limited beer. Standard Newcastle brew. Not terrible and decently drinkable."
