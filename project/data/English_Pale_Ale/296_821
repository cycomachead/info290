1.82,-49.7,4,2,1,3,2,"At first blush I'd say it tastes like earwax. Hops are very grassy/floral. Pale malts. Chalky. Has an oddly skunky Heineken aspect to it. Dry aftertaste. Somewhat astringent. My will to live fades with every sip.","MeisterBurger","Mar 29, 2011"

The nose is an immediate travesty. That's what you get when you put a pale ale in a green bottle. This is simply gross and ridiculously-skunked. That's all that is there. The taste isn't quite as bad as the nose, but doesn't offer anything other than light-struck hops. It just has less of a skunky character. The feel is gross and astringent. Bad, bad, bad. Change the bottle color, please.","Thorpe429","Jan 24, 2011"

Smell has some floral hops with a bit of earthiness. Flavour has a tiny bit of bitterness from the hops, with some sweetness. Nothing off about this, just a little bit lacking in flavour compared to other pale ale's. Carbonation level was a little weak, but still a highly quaffable beer.","kwjd","Aug 04, 2010"
3.62,0,3,3.5,4,3,3.5,"I think I appreciate St Peter's English Ale more for its uniqueness than its quaffability, although I do enjoy drinking it too! It's definitely more charismatic than its generic title lets on. As I finish writing this, the fruity hoppiness and chamomile tastes grow more and more assured, triggering vivid thoughts of spring and budding flowers - it's a good beer that can do that!","biegaman","Apr 17, 2010"
3.77,4.1,3,3.5,4,3.5,4,"This is my second time having this beer, and the second time is what it took to appreciate it. The first time I had this, I drank it directly from the fridge and it seemed very minerally and skunky, but now, as I let it sit as I reviewed, this beer's nuances really started to shine.

1.95,-46.1,2,2,2,1.5,2,"Final Thoughts: This beer isn't for me, that is for sure. I'm not sure skunking or poor storage have a factor here because I just can't see many characteristics I can appreciate. Really, I feel that the only reason this stuff sells, is because of the odd shaped green bottle. I also have the St. Peter's cream stout in my fridge, and I must say I'm not looking forward to it.","TheHammer","Nov 21, 2009"
3.85,6.4,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"The mouthfeel is watery creamy and smooth with some diacetyl slickness. However, the carbonation fades quickly for a flat beer midway.","ecoastman","Oct 15, 2009"
3.94,8.8,3,4,4,4,4,"It's deep golden orange in colour with almost no head to speak of. What little head there is fades to a ring around the edge and splotch in the middle. It smells of caramel, ripe fruit (apple and plum?), with a faint musty character around the edges. There's an earthy base to the flavour profile. Caramel and fruit, with lemony finish. Nice lingering bitterness in the aftertaste. I think I opened this too cold, it took some time to really open up. It improves significantly as it warms. Very low carbonation and smooth-bodied, but somewhat light as well. Easy to drink and light in the stomach - it's definately a session ale.","mintjellie","Sep 12, 2009"

3.8,5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"St. Peter's unique bottle design is what first drew me to try their beers several years ago but it is the quality of their brews that has kept me coming back. This beer pours a very hazy yellow gold with just the tiniest of white heads briefly appearing up top. The aromas are very earthy with a pleasant, honey-like sweetness. Its flavors are also have earthy notes with a very intriguing sourdough breadiness that I like very much. The cost of St. Peter's is a bit steep but its beers are well worth revisiting every now and then.","droomyster","Jul 21, 2009"
3.9,7.7,4,4,4,4,3.5,"Drinkability - wouldn't have more than 2 of these because of the same reason for limiting IPAs - I don't want to only associate beer with hops. It does get a little unidirectional when the malt isn't as present in the mix.","DoctorStrangiato","Jun 12, 2009"
4,10.5,4,4,4,4,4,"What a very interesting beer this one is. Upon opening the bottle I get a whiff of that skunky hoppy smell, but upon pouring I get honey and very faint hops. Foam dissipated rapidly even after some of the yeast residue poured out into the glass. A cloudy orange-yellow color (maybe shades of brown) that is pleasant to look at and tasted quite good. You get that honey at first, followed by a bit of spiciness and a hint of hops/sour at the end. Very smooth going down and I finished this beer off pretty fast over a fried chicken and buttermilk biscuit dinner. Really very tasty - I'll have to get this one again. I was expecting something more in the hoppy pale ale department, and this is very different than any English ale I've had.","damndirtyape","May 25, 2009"

3.4,-6.1,3,3,3.5,3,4,"Poured a light amber, orangish color that was cloudy with very little to no head. The smell was hops, plums, roasted barley and floral scents.

It is a good beer with decent drinkability, but not great and not horrible, very average.","Kromes","Mar 27, 2009"

1.94,-46.4,3,1.5,1.5,3,2.5,"Pours a mirky golden orange color with a thin fizzy white head that quickly fades without any lacing. Earthy aroma of grass, soil and hops with a vegetable-like quality. Crisper than their IPA but still very earthy and dirty tasting. Vegetable-like and bitter but in a rotten unpleasant kind of way.","corby112","Feb 11, 2009"
3.33,-8,3.5,3,3,4,4,"Drinkability: definitely not a session beer, but great to sip and enjoy. I believe that (at least here in Ontario) that what is labeled as St. Peter's English Ale is indeed the same as the Organic Ale that I believe they serve in the UK. Not my favourite St. Peter's offering, but still a pleasant brew, as was expected given their range of other fantastic brews.","barleywort","Feb 08, 2009"
4.2,16,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Bought this bottle at Green's, and it fits nicely into my English pint glass. Pours with the slightest chill haze, an orange amber with a fairly slight head, but one that is creamy and settles to athin cap and leaves some lacing. I lie the design of the bottle, but this one is is still in that light green glass that I hate since it skunks the beer. This one seems okay, however. Nicely balanced aromas of lightly sweet grain, earthy hops, and some floral top notes. A bit of clean hay is there as well. Smells rustic and delicious. Pretty similar in the taste, just beatifully balanced with some nice but slight lingering earthy bitterness and a pleasant, slightly metallic undernote. Tastes fairly fresh with some light sweetness and some more hay. Very nice. Medium bodied with just enough graininess and bitterness to keep it interesting. A pleasure. I'd love to try this on cask.","Georgiabeer","Dec 20, 2008"

2.79,-22.9,2.5,3.5,2.5,4,2,"Smooth and refreshing, modestly complex but well meshed. This would be an extremely enjoyable beer if not for the skunkiness. What's with the green bottles?

3.91,8,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,5,"Some may not agree, but I think packaging does say something about the beer inside. A beer can certainly be delicious without being stored in something pretty, but an eye-catching bottle makes a beer easier to pick out on a shelf. Interesting design here, which I believe claims to be a faithful reproduction of a late 18th-century bottle. A nice historical tidbit to accompany a nice historical beer!","maskaggs","Nov 03, 2008"

2.71,-25.1,3.5,2.5,2.5,3,3,"Pours into the glass a clear, pretty golden amber with a fairly thick and fluffy but not persistent head. Aroma is crisp and malty, rather like a lager instead of an ale.

The aroma is a light sweet bread with a touch of hoppy citrus. Smells like a great session beer. The first sip brings together a perfect balance of hops and malt. Biscuits with splashes of orange and grapefruit juice. Great mild bitter finish with hints of pine in an acre of grapfruit trees, while Grandma is baking a batch of biscuits. Very smooth ad balanced ale. Maybe even a little more bitter than I expected from an English ale. A great session beer for anytime of the year.","scruffwhor","May 17, 2008"

In my mouth this beer was a bit too fruity without the alcohol or malt to balance it out and add richness to the flavor.

There is almost no head even with a vigorous pour, though this is not uncommon for English PAs. The color is a nice dark golden amber. Not an overly aromatic beer, but does smell faintly earthy/dusty/musty, actually kind of like an english tavern. The taste is subtly malty and not overly hoppy, again fairly traditional for EPA. Not overly complex, but tasty and enhanced by the nice light bitter finish. This was fairly light bodied and not very carbonated. I wonder how much of that is due to original craftsmanship versus shipping to Colorado. With no freshness date i have no way to know.

Hops hit the nose as well as earth tones and caramel blended in together. Perhaps a few nuts in there for good measure. Taste was to the point which I liked. Starts out to be very smooth and drinkable. Hops, grain and barley all hit the palate with some sweet malts finishing the job towards the end. Next time I'll know what to pick for an English ale.

3.9,7.7,4,4,3.5,4,4.5,"Murky amber hue. One fingered persistent, creamy off white head leaves sparse lace. Lightly buttered honey drizzled biscuit in aroma is accompanied by softly earthy hops and a subtle hint of caramelized almond. Mellow, toffeeish sweetness in flavor lazily gives way to stately biscuit and bread base malt notes. Judicious hop bitterness seemlessly emerges after a deliberation along with agreeably mild butterscotch, which longers sufficiently to facilitate a balanced, buttery undertone to the lately surfacing simple residual sweetness and nutty malt combination. Vaguely woody hop flavor. The low carbonation helps wring out the body from the unfermentables lending a smooth, quasi creamy mouthfeel. Finishes soft, with mild notes of whole grain biscuit enused by a light continuation of diacetyl. A mellow, simple, well balanced bitter with a firm malt backbone. St. Peter's English is highly reminscent of Belhaven's St. Andrew's Ale, but is comparatively a couple notches shy in overall character. Tasty, and a fine ""light"" session brew.","marc77","May 30, 2003"

Malts are bready but not sweet; hops come on strong and tickle the tongue, almost puckering effect. Sharpness with a metallic hint makes me wonder if bottle has been damaged by light. Bottles are neat but I am guessing they don't protect the beer as well as they should. A very earthy ale, quite raw, unusual and lacking the heartiness that the best British ales have.

Some yeast aroma also present, but I might notice it because I'm having a cheddar cheese sandwich along with the ale.  Taste is mild, sweet malt and mild hops blend incredibly well.  Slight metallic tang, mostly noticable in the finish.  Beer is pretty lively on the tongue, even after a hard pour to create that big head.
