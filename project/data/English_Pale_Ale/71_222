The aroma is malty and rich, with notes of fruit and burnt sugar. The taste is superb, with incredible malt depth for the light ABV. The bottle version doesn't do the UK cask version justice, but it is still delicious. It has a nice weight to it, not too heavy but not thin or watery, either. In total, an excellent pint of ale.","delta490","Apr 06, 2014"

Pours slightly cloudy deep golden amber color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of caramel, toffee, pear, apple, grape, biscuit, toast, floral, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with very well balanced malt, hop, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, toffee, toast, pear, apple, grape, biscuit, floral, grass, herbal, light pine, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, pear, apple, grape, biscuit, toast, floral, grass, herbal, light pine, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a god bit. Very well balanced and moderately robust malt, yeast, and hop flavors; with a moderately crisp malt/hop balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied; with a lightly creamy, smooth, and moderately crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish as expected of 4.7%. Overall this is a damn nice English pale ale! All around good balance and robustness of flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Dec 07, 2013"

3.9,-0.8,3.5,4,4,3.75,3.75,"Had on tap at an alehouse in Calgary (1600 in the south). Arrived in a signature London Pride pint glass (always a nice touch), a nice honey golden to orange amber color with around three fingers of white head. Aroma a classic British ale waft of pale malts, woody earthy hops, and a touch of fresh orange and coriander spice (the latter a bit unusual in a British pale, but I swear that's what I smell here. Must be the integration of citrus and peppery esters). Body is classic for the style, on the thin side but not watery. Palate is a subtle but rich complexity of soft bready malts, savory spice, floral citrus that mirrors the orange and lemon aroma, medicinal herb notes, maybe a little diacetyl butter, and a clean ultra-smooth bitter finish. Even the non-beer geek I was with was amazed by the smoothness. Overall effect is malty and bright vibrant citrus notes rather than super-sweet, but make no mistake, I am not talking citrus as in pungent West Coast hops. This is earthy, woody, fruity (from ale yeast), but smooth and bitter, with only a touch of caramel. A sublime integration of classic English flavors that taste quite bright and fresh on tap and with an aggressive yet English hopping regime that leads the way but does not overpower the malts. Rivals Samuel Smith Old Brewery but tastes a bit less rustic and ""dark", more bright and fruity. Incidentally, many sources say this is a bitter rather than a pale ale. I think the cleaner malt taste and hopping make it a pale ale, but a perfect example for the old debate around whether these are even different styles.","CalgaryFMC","Oct 31, 2013"

I say that because it's hard for me to picture something not along the lines of Boddington's or Bass but had a nice niche all of it's own. While not like their American counterparts, this fell into a style that I could easily enjoy and even love. Beers like this are a classic for reason - no one would ever want to see this change. A must-try for anyone looking to find a new session Ale that feels like an old friend.","JerzDevl2000","Oct 01, 2013"

The beer poured a very nice amber with white head that laced. The smell was primarily buttering hops. The taste was a well balanced beer between the hops and malt. There was a subtle sweetness that worked well with the bitter hops. The mouthfeel was a decent light to medium bodied ale with decent carbonation. Overall it was a good session ale.","WoodBrew","Feb 10, 2013"

It's nothing that's gonna blow your mind, but if you wanna kick back and have a few brewskies during the game, you could do a hell of a lot worse.","TheSixthRing","Feb 09, 2013"

Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet slick mouthfeel. Nice beer, I've never had it before but it was on special so I gave it a shot.

A few streaming bubbles can be seen rising from the bottom of the glass. The aroma is of sweet, bready malts and citrus from the hops. The taste follows the nose. The beer tastes bready with some mild background sweetness. The hops provide a nice citrus balance as well as faint back end bitterness. This beer also tastes clean. The body is light with some carbonation. The finish is smooth and slightly dry. The drinkability is very high. This is an excellent and very sessionable pale ale.","acevenom","Jun 20, 2012"

To fit into this style of beer better, it would need a good dose of bitterness. Ensure that your bittering hops are being boiled for a sufficient amount of time (i.e. 60 minutes) and that the alpha acids are on the higher range of the scale. Don't go too high as the malt flavors need to come thru too, but the bitterness does need to be increased. Also, perhaps laying off the caramel just a bit may help the beer shine in other flavor and aroma areas.","tophers","Feb 16, 2012"

3.7,-5.9,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"London Pride pours a clear orange to amber, depending on how well lit the beer is. The white foam that serves as a crown tops out at one finger at the most, leaving a little bit of lacing and showing a touch of head retention. The nose is surprisingly malt forward. It predominantly displays a nutty sweetness, though there's a touch of herbal European hops present as well. The malty aspects of the beer open up a little bit more on my palate. Toasted nuts, caramel, and a little bit of diacetyl show themselves, followed by a mineral laced bitterness. That same mild herb hoppy note from the aroma closes out each sip. The mouthfeel comes across as a bit slick overall. The body is mid to light, which is a boon to drinkability, but the carbonation isn't quite enough to cut through that. I enjoyed my bottle of London Pride, but I'm a bit surprised at how much the malty vs hoppy flavors are what I enjoyed about this pale ale.","axeman9182","Jul 27, 2011"

4.42,12.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Picked this up at the biggest beer store in the UK, Beers of Europe Ltd. Beautiful clear copper pour with fluffy two finger head with great retention and lacing. Toffee and caramel malt dominates the nose with a subdued, but appealing floral, perfumy hop aroma. The taste is much the same with plenty of toasty caramel malt with hints of biscuit, tea, vanilla, toffee, brown sugar and just a touch of metal. Great balance with just enough of a tangy, bitter hop bite on the finish to perfectly complement the sweet malt. The drinkability of this beer is off the charts!

The sweetness of it though might put some people off as the bread and caramel malt flavours really dominate this one from start to finish, although I must say the flavours are very well balanced. A very quality ale although I wouldn’t rate this one world class by any stretch of the imagination, more on the above average scale I would say, I would drink this one again though and Fuller’s seems to have very solid offerings, I actually really enjoyed their porter and ESB, this is just another win for them.","Roke87","Jun 30, 2011"

In the aroma, there are a nice balance of earthy hops and malt. The taste is a tad too bready and sweet for me to feel that this is world class, but it's pleasing enough.

This one possesses a nice sweet malty flavor nicely balanced with some mild grainy tones and some faint hoppy bitterness. There's some definite graininess here, but it's so nicely balanced that it adds to the character of the beer instead of making it seem blah. The more I drink, the more it seems to have a nice woody flavor to it. I could drink this beer all evening long and not get tired of it.

I get a little taste of candy/taffy every once in a while, also. The bitterness steps up in the finish and aftertaste, which makes it easy to take another sweet sip to follow-up.

Taste is sweet and light. Really easy drinking. Honestly it's kind of a disappointment when comparing it to it's big brother in the ESB, but it's a decent beer in it's own right.

The flavors are subtle yet well-balanced; there's nothing here to blow your hair back and yet it's one of the finest, sessionable, sipping ales around. Sweet malts are perfectly balanced by woody, slightly earthy hops in a medium-bodied, lowly carbonated blend that seems to take its flavoring as lightly as it takes its mouthfeel seriously. It's one of the most perfectly weighted ales I've ever had, which only adds to its sessionability. Bravo to this understatedly brilliant beer.","droomyster","Aug 26, 2010"

I realize that European hops are by nature less expressive than the very assertive American hops, but this to me defines our nations, particularly the West coast hop-heads compared to our across the pond neighbors. I know what people must be thinking, an Irish-American New England boy must hate the British for innumerable reasons, but don't get me wrong, I respect the style and the nation and realize what was aimed to be achieved in this beer was undoubtedly achieved, and I enjoyed it. What's more, I prefer English barleywines to extreme American ones.

A favorite!","gfreed","Feb 05, 2009"

Behind that lie some faint notes of honey, nuts, and fruit, which leads to a complex aroma for a pale ale.

Taste is very malty. The subtle hop element belies the fact that Challenger, Target and Northdown is the combo. Fuller's got it right on hopping levels. The house yeast lends a fruity element to the finish. Finish is spicy hop and smoothness. Reminds me of Young's Ram Rod. Drinkability is at cosmic level.

In the aroma there's a strong floral and citrus lined caramel note. On the palate, a low carbonated beer delivers a strong malt backbone, small amounts of toastiness from Munich or crystal malts, with a floral, slightly bitter finish. Style guidelines say this style should have a firm bitter note, and I simply don't see it. I see this beer as a very drinkable, balanced ale. Body is medium thin, and the low carbonation gives it a very easy drinking feel. I would like to see this beer on cask or nitro to really get a better sense for how it should be served.","dreadnatty08","Feb 17, 2008"

The mouthfeel is medium bodied, with moderate carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is a very good pale ale, and a fine session beer.

The smell has a nice malt but has a sour note to it that I don't care for. The taste is much better than the smell, though. The malt hits up front followed by a nice floral hop back & even better aftertaste. There is an acidity to it but not too pronounced. The sourness comes back a bit in the finish but is subtle. The mouthfeel is a bit thin, not really living up to the malty flavor. It does have a nice silky quality to it. The drinkability is OK. The malt balances the light body. In general, a good choice and in England a great choice. They really do a nice job with the malt/hops balance, each taking over at its own time & making for a nice complexity.

Smell is very light, I smell a small amount of hops and some good light malty flavors as well. The first thing is a noticeable light bitterness that follows with the sweet malts and in the finish there's a meeting of the two and it's almost a metallic flavor. Yeah, the metallic flavor is very apparent now. Must be old, and I don't know how I would ever get a fresh one in Iowa that's in good conditon. The mouthfeel is a little overcarbonated.

Throughout, there's a solid body with just enough carbonation to give it, at the same time, a crisp, light feeling.

Mild apricot and bergamot tea aromas at first, slight bready malt scent later. Leafy and spicy hop flavors hit the palate up front, dwelling for a long time and introducing apricot essence, warm biscuit, bitter orange, honeydew, and a subdued yet dense butter notes.

4,1.8,4,4,4,4,4,"My favorite English soccer team--West Ham United, of London's East End--came up painfully short in the FA Cup final Saturday. It was a bitter loss, but also a day that left all Irons/Hammers supporters full of immense pride at their underdog side's brave performance. Hence, it was a perfect day for Fuller's London Pride. This is such a classic example of its style, there really isn't much to say. Its caramel-malty aroma and golden copper-brown appearance are extremely inviting. Again true to style, its flavor and body are perhaps a little on the thin side, but extremely drinkable and balanced, with a straightforward hop bitterness slightly more assertive than the caramel malt background--although the maltiness becomes more noticeable as the beer warms. The only thing really limiting this style-defining beer is being served in a bottle; this refreshing, lightly carbonated, but deceptively flavorful session brew absolutely demands being served traditionally cask-conditioned.","petemorris","May 14, 2006"

Very low carbonation, once the head is gone, there's little sign of activity in this beer. Smell is malty, bready, fairly light. Taste is mostly the malt backbone with some very subtle hoppiness. I expected more out of this brew, it just seemed rather bland and unexciting to me. The minimal carbonation almost makes it seem as though it's flat.

There is quite a noticeable caramel smell as well. It's just so well balanced. Not too much or too little of anything. A masterpiece. The taste is quite lovely as well with a robust maltiness in the beginning with a pleasantly bitter hoppy finish. The mouth feel is so smooth and almost buttery. This is also very drinkable.

Assertive malty and buttery diacetyl taste with a slightly hoppy, drier finish. Trace vegetal notes. Lighter bodied, very drinkable and carbonation level is just right.

Pours as clear as most pilsners -- where's the yeast? (This is obviously not a bottle-conditioned ale.) Almost reminds of a little bit of the last Pilsner Urquell I had -- but his is supposed to be an ale, right? A good beer, but lacking some of the traits of other English beers from other breweries I Iike -- Young's or Adnam's, for example -- the mouthfeel, body and fruitiness contributed by the yeast.

Pretty well balanced if you are a malt lover. Mouthfeel is nice. This could be a great session beer, but I seem to prefer my pale ale's to have more floral qualities.

Taste is excellent with a slight roasty character in the front followed by a strong malt background that is matched perfectly with a flavor of english hops and a light hop bitterness in the finish.

Nose is rich, buttery bread, sweet malt and caramel, a bit of toffee, and a faint hint of mild hops. Flavour is smooth and well blended, buttery toffee taste, toasted malt, and nice compliment of hops towards the end. It goes down like liquid heaven.

I am stunned at how smooth and drinkable this beer is. Every sip becomes larger and larger as I try to have as much of this luscious fluid touch my tastebuds. There is no ""biting"" hops bitterness. A more mellow hop character is preceded by a lightly carbonated and very wonderful maltiness.

Tons of flavor, creamy, nutty; a huge beer flavor-wise, but remains incredibly easy to drink. Head leaves perfect rings down the glass, and the beer massages the inside of my throat on the way down. Generous malt presence; initially sweet up front, but said sweetness makes ample room for assertive hops and a perfectly dry finish. The aftertaste toys with me, teasing, beckoning me to partake in more. I happily obey. It's an experience like this that makes beers like Bass and Boddington's seem especially dull. The bartender told me that most customers don't like the cask-conditioned beers and instead opt for Heineken, Corona, Amstel Light. Idiots. More for me, I guess.","Thrasher","Jan 31, 2003"

Slightly sweet, the predominant flavor is biscuity malt with a healthy dose of buttery diacytel Low ABV means you can put away quite a few of these which is a good thing (the put away a few, not the low ABV...I prefer a bit more bite).

Very pleasing taste, not too overwhelming, but definitely not lacking in flavor or body. English hop bitterness and toasted/bready/grainy malt are matched perfectly to create what is probably the finest example of an English pale ale you can find. At the very front, sweet malt makes up most of the flavor profile, but in the middle, the hops really take hold. The finish is more of a balance between the two.

Smooth with a nice malty start to it.  Light diacetyl from start to middle and then in the finish lightly.  Quite a nice bitter hop finish, especially for the style.  Much more bitter that I expected.  Nice lingering bitter finish makes this brew much crisper than I was expecting and a nicely drinkable brew with its medium body.

The full, long-lasting flavor was big in the mouthfeel department and this is a VERY drinkable beer. An excellent english style pale ale.","ryanocerus","Sep 10, 2002"
4.13,5.1,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"This pale pours a nice dark copper from the bottle with a sizeable off-white head, which looks great. There is a faint hops smell. The taste is somewhat biscuit-like with heavy malt notes and a hint of hops. The mouthfeel is rather creamy and malty. The drinkability is quite good. A great example of an EPA.","Jon","Sep 07, 2002"
4.3,9.4,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"This is a real winner on draught. It has a healthy white head and a pleasant smell that is subtle hops and malt. The taste is also a nice balance of slightly sweet malt flavor with a hint of hops. It goes down like silk. This is one of my favorite session beers and goes well with many meals, not the least of which is a genuine plate of fish and chips.","mickeymac","Aug 29, 2002"
4.5,14.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Notes: Indeed this brew goes down as one of the greatest ... bliss in a bottle. BTW this is Fuller's flagship brew. A true ale-drinkers ale. Up there in greatness with the ESB also.","Jason","Aug 29, 2002"
3.7,-5.9,3,3,4,4,4,"An interesting Pale. Reminded me alot of Bass, but without that ""metallic"" taste Bass is known for.  Fuller's puts out some fine beers and this is quite good as well.  Pours out to a golden/amber color, with a light aroma.  Slight hop taste that is in no way overwhelming with a slight taste of caramel.  Very easy to drink.","proc","Aug 04, 2002"
4.5,14.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Rich carmel colored beer with a pillow soft white head. Very inviting hop bitterness hits your nose. Extemely rich hop bitter taste with full malt backbone. Very creamy smooth balanced beer. Crisp dry finish, asks you to drink more and more. Very smooth feel, very easy to drink to the point you feel guilty putting your glass down. A real treat on tap, a great beer, and perfect example of the style. Magic in a glass....","StevieW","Aug 02, 2002"
4.33,10.2,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"A fine example of what English Pales should aspire to be.  It drinks hearty and tastey and is a good looker.  Dig it, dig again.  Cheers!","BillyBrew","Jul 18, 2002"
3.68,-6.4,3.5,3,4,3.5,4,"I can't say anything bad about any of Fulers beers I have tried they are all very good.  This pale ale is a little on the dark side IMO for the style.  Not much aroma here and has a decent mouthfeel to it.  Taste more on the malty side than the hoppy, I think a little more hops would enhance this beer.  Overall I will gladly drink this brew again...............CHEERS","tigerpaws","Jul 13, 2002"
4.31,9.7,5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Great traditional bitter,nice bronze color with a light amount of lace.A lot of malt aromas going on caramel brown sugar and biscuit dough only a light geranium hop presence lingers.A true session ale malty and fruity with some iron in there but there is a green hop presence light but it make the beer balanced,a gret ale from Fuller's.","oberon","Jul 11, 2002"
4.1,4.3,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Deep golden in color with a hint of orange...small lace...nice doughy aroma...almost like being in a bakery...malt dominates the buds with a tasty bread/dough flavor....hops are not strong but deliver a tight dry finish...VERY drinkable...overall very good pale ale bordering on outstanding..","ZAP","Jul 06, 2002"
4.33,10.2,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours an orange  copper color, with a minimal off-white head. On the nose the aroma is moderately malty light toasted bread, caramel notes evident, and hop aromas. On the palate the malty flavors take front seat with caramel, light toasted bread, and hops take the back seat, nice fruitiness to it, well balanced with a smooth mouth feel. I really liked this stuff, I love going back and forth from the English Pale Ales back to the more hop filled American pale ales. Overall great stuff, and a great session brew...","WilliamPhilaPa","Jun 15, 2002"
3.76,-4.3,4,3,4,4,4,"Pours a nice deep golden with a very slight head that has no retention.  I get very little on the nose.  Just a little herbal character from the hops.  Pretty good taste.  Nice malt backbone.  Good earthy tones from the hops.  And a nice dry touch.  Medium body.  This beer gets better as you work your way through it.  I tend to prefer American Style Pale Ales more than the English counterpart, but this is one of the best English versions I've come across.","Bighuge","May 21, 2002"
3.8,-3.3,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Fuller's is really good with Malts. I'm not sure if they malt their own, but if they don't, they sure know how to buy them. The malt flavors are complex in and of themselves. That's good because it's really light on hops (on tap anyway) and the malt has to carry it. It's not an IPA or a Bitter, so it's not supposed to be really hoppy. This is a really good meal to go with a meal. It really went well with the Shepherd's Pie I had.","aracauna","May 20, 2002"
4.05,3.1,4,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Fine clear deeper amber color, approaching copper.  Nice 3/4 inch head that's big-bubbled on the outside and cottony on the inside.  Sweet and sour smell, a little like candied lemon.  Great low-carbonation body, malty sweet with a touch of restrained hops.  Very much of the English style but far more flavorful than a Bass.  Medium-bodied and satisfying and highly drinkable.  I prefer the hoppier American Pales but this is good.  Nice brew from Fuller's again.","ADR","May 16, 2002"
3.44,-12.5,3,4,3,3,4,"Copper in hue and perfectly clear.  The head settles quickly leaving a meager layer.  There isn't any lace left.  Assertive and earthy Fuggles hop nose hits first, but mild biscuit malt notes follow.  The carbonation, at least in this bottle, is too high and results in a soda - like prickly mouthfeel.  Hop flavor is grassy and distinctively British-- hop bitterness is crisp and assertive (considering the lack of malt body) while the subdued malt flavors are comprised of bready and generic caramal malt notes.  London Pride finishes dry and a touch toasty.  It's a good pale, but malt flavors were lacking, IMO. I could still drink a lot of these.","marc77","May 03, 2002"
4.5,14.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Fat lace clings to glass above a copper liquid nirvana. Rich, bready, fruity nose. Drink in a deep malt start that turns instantly bitter and lingers enough to beckon you to taste again. Smooth and appropriate for a session or a treat. A standard that any brewer going for the English Pale should reckon. Worth the outlay.","inebrius","May 03, 2002"
4.1,4.3,4,4,4,4,4.5,"An excellent all around drinking beer.","bmills1608","Feb 27, 2002"
4.85,23.4,4.5,4.5,5,5,5,"A totally soothing smooth malty ale. The bottled version we get here is just a tease. Having this cask conditioned in the U.K. is really where it's at, Maltier almost caramel taste is the base. Smooth mellow hops with a touch of fruitiness rounds out this top ale. One of the keepers.","Mark","Feb 02, 2002"
4,1.8,4,4,4,4,4,"A good solid choice, and a nice benchmark for the classic pale ale style. Malty, firm, crisp with a nice soft character. You can't got wrong with this beer.","Todd","Dec 18, 2001"
4,1.8,4,4,4,4,4,"This is a classic English pale. Rather mild malt with a gentle hop flavor and aroma.","John","Oct 18, 2001"
4.4,12,4,4,5,4,4,"Firm body and a steady finish.  This is the sort of beer I associate with the name ""English ale.""","Brent","Jul 08, 2001"
