3.06,-5.3,4,3,3,3,3,"Served from nitro-can into a Duck-Rabbit nonic. Poured yellow-orange with a one finger off-white head that subsided to half a finger very slowly. The pour really reminded me of a Guinness with the head consuming the entire beer and working its way up slowly to form the final head. Nice. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, cream, grain, and wheat. The flavor was of sweet malt, cream, grain, earth, and subtle spice. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation (almost velvety). Overall this was a pretty average brew. I have to say the pour on this one was pretty cool as it looked like a Guinness only it was a Pale Ale! However, that is where the fun stopped on this one. There was really not a whole lot going on in this one which really made it a bit of a buzzkill for me. Very light on all aspects so good for the non-robust beer drinkers out there, but if you like loads of flavor and complexity. Avoid this one.

Mouthfeel was full and creamy as the result of the widget and the taste was only moderately bitter. It had a pleasant biscuit maltiness up front, followed by a light bitterness before the swallow.

Great sticking and retention. Caramel corn, toffee, sweet tea, and even some rose wine and strawberries crop up in the nose, with just a light dusting of hops to provide a veneer of leafy resin. Mild in flavor, but well-rounded, and it stands up to overchilling (as it is usually served), with a light, woody base, hollow caramel malts, And a paper-thin layer of leafy hops. Easy drinking with a mouthfeel that actually does approximate proper real ale, but the flavor doesn't exactly leave me wanting more. Nonetheless it is a nice thirst-slaker and I'd certainly be happy to have it again, especially in situations like this, where all the other beers are boring pale lagers.","soulgrowl","Sep 21, 2009"

The head leaves quite a bit of lacing and stays for the entire time. Im not sure what to make of the smell. It's very malty and, leaving me not quite sure if i like it. It remided very much of the smell of malt extract. At first the taste is almost non-existant. I really couldnt pick out much from it. There were some flavours there, just extremely milld. However, as the beer warmed there was a slight malt sweetness that was failry enjoyable, but still on the minimal side. Mouthfeel was really good though, very smooth, very creamy and just really enjoyable all round. Honestly, drinkability could be a 5 on this if there was just a little more flavour. The 'extra smooth' is no lie, i just wish there was a little more flavour to go with the smoothness.","belias","Aug 25, 2006"
