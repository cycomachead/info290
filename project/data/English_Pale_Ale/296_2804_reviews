"O: Boring. I've had plenty of 3% ABV beers with twice as much flavour as this."

"O) Buy it to support the small brewery and make your own mind up. The bottle is cool. I won't buy it again."

"Not bad - a well-judged ale that hits the right notes. Looks good, while the aroma and flavour showcase biscuity malt and delicate, grassy hops. Decent body. A good example of a traditional ale; goes down nicely. Worth sampling if you have the chance."
""
"Pours a orange/amber in color with a thin white head. Some spotty lacing is seen but settles back down the glass. The aroma is at first a mild' skunky' (as is COMMON for some reason with brews in green bottles) and is of malts with a hint of floral hops. The taste is MUCH better than the aroma with some buttery malts coming through. Lower carbonation which fit this one to a tee. Actually easy to drink as I wasn't sure."
""
"O: The skunkiness could be dealt with better, by putting it in darker bottles, and it could be a more interesting beer, but it's tasty, and worth a try. Recommended."

"Not amazing, not terrible. I would like to try a fresher bottle or on-tap, then speak my opinion again."

"Overall / Drinkability: Not bad, but not a great English pale ale either. A bit unbalanced but okay. I guess it's a rather hoppy English pale ale."
""
"D: A clean and refreshing English pale"
"Overall: this beer is probably not objectively bad, but its flavor profile jibes neither with what I know of this style, nor my palate in general."
""
"The taste is full of English yeast, toffee, malts, and a decent semi-lingering hop bite on the tail end."

"500 ml. dicinal"" bottle. Orange to gold colour, with normal head that dissappears sooon. Smell is earthy, grains, hops. Palate is maybe too light, fizzy, but smooth. Taste is rough in the beginning, earthy, caramel, citrus notes. Yes, is similar in character to Czech lager, and it's good."
""

""
"Overall: Decent but not a highlight for me."
"Don't usually like this style, but this is really well developed. Nice beer."
""
"Got this guy from his new, round bottle. Gotta say, I almost prefer the more flask-like model... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear golden straw topped by over a finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises wheat, light orange peel, and very light banana. The taste sticks to the smell's guns, altering pretty much nothing. Fair enough. The body is a hefty light, with a very light moderate carbonation and a wet feel. Overall, a nice little EPA, nothing amazing, but something easily taken down with moderate pleasure. And, yes, I could sound more like a humanizing robot...I just choose not to..."

"Drinkability: It's a smooth drinkable beer accompanied with decent flavors and aromas."
"D: A clean and refreshing English pale ale that would be nothing short of sensual art on a July afternoon. Besides the drinkability, it's flavourful and has complexity to make it worth sipping as well as sessioning. Well worth a try."
"O - This tastes more like an emaciated Bitter, than a British substitute for a Pilsner. I don't mind a good Pilsner, when fresh. But my experience with their other beers had me hoping I had found my go-to Warm Weather beer. Sadly it lacked comparable character and isn't worth the price."
"O- The soft malt flavor is very dry with the hops becoming mostly bitey with the carbonic acid but they do hold a bit of their flavor. The hops were very nice in the nose but the off aromas were hard to get past."
"Pours a murky light honey orange with a 1/2 tan head that fades to nothing. Very small dots of lace randomly form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, grains, and some honey. Taste is of malt, grains, bread, and slight hop flavors. There is a slight bitterness that sticks around on the palate after each sip. This beer has a low level of carbonation with a creamy and smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but I wish the carbonation level was a bit higher."
"Other than the unusual bottle shape I found this beer underwhelming. Poured a 2"" white head which quickly vanished. Clear straw yellow in color, not really even golden. Smell is moderately skunked. It tastes like standard BMCs except for a lasting bitter finish and a moderate zing. I don't see what's the big deal."
"O: On the whole, this is an easy to drink, well made English Pale Ale. It's not something that will wow you, but it is a good, solid brew."
"O - A pretty solid brew overall though I'm not sure I'd buy it again. I prefer much maltier English ales but that being, it still has some unique qualities that certainly make it worth a try."
"D - Not bad, there is nothing too complex going on here but it certainly has all of the requisite components of beer. The hops and yeast are appropriately disposed to misty and fruity notes, respectively. I wouldn't turn this down if offered a glass in the future, but I can't really see any reason to spend money on it."
"The mouthfeel was soft and under-carbonated."
"Drinkability - I didn't know what to expect of this brew when I opened it, however I was pleasantly surprised. A very nice well rounded beer. A great brew for Spring and Summer. Worth a try. Very sessionable and easy to drink. A great beer to sit back and relax with. It was rather filling for a low ABV beer also."
"D: The beer is very easy to drink. I would definitely consider having another one of these because it is very flavorful."
"D: Light session beer, easily can drink a few of these in one sitting, nothing special"
"The English pale ale is a style of beer with which I'm sort of going through a bit of a rough spell. This little brew will certainly go far towards rekindling our once powerful romance. An easy-drinking pub ale, full of flavor and brilliant-looking in the accompanying glass. Great stuff."
"D - A very drinkable beer, would definitely work as a session drink."
"It's definitely a passable, drinkable beer, however I find it weighs a bit heavy and it's not as good as some of the other varieties produced at St. Peter's Brewery."
"Medium bodied with a lighter than normal amount of carbonation...that's a high point in my review of St. Peter's Golden. That, and drinkability. I could put a few away for sure."
"Nice fair for summer patio sipping or with Bar B Q solid offering from this brewer."
"All things considered, this is not one of the better beers I've ever had, but it's really not bad. I could even see this growing on me in time. Definitely worth a taste."
"I recently had a positive experience with the St. Peter's Winter Ale so I went into this tasting with enthusiasm; unfortunately, my enthusiasm was short lived. On the pour, a hazy honey gold colour with no head and the thinnest of rings. No visible carbonation, almost perfectly flat but for a few suspended bubbles on top. Slightly grassy bouquet with a lemony-lime odour. Very earthy taste, heavy tasting, unpleasant. Not much by way of a hops, could be an abundance of malt but whatever it was it didn't work; with warming a distinctly sour finish. I found it hard to finish this beer, in fact, I didn't. Not recommended."
"d-relatively good drinkablity, not my favorite beer but worth trying and drinking again everyonce and a while"
"The first mouthful was surprising, as it was very bitter tasting. It got better with every mouthful. By the end of it, I was wanting more."
"Overall - Not bad. Now I can say I've had one. Don't know that I'd go out of my way to find another."
"A very nice beer and a good mark of the style, I only wish we could get it here all year round."
"Drinkability...no. Not really."
"Drinkability: A nice, pleasant golden brew from St. Peter's. I'm particularly digging the softer, lighter carbonation."
"There are some sweet and slightly tart elements to this beer that balance quite nicely. Nice refreshing qualities. I can honestly say I'm pleasantly surprised. On the other side, the beer is a little unremarkable. It is a solid beer, don't get me wrong, I just don't think I could do more than a pint at a time."
"This slightly bolder ale poured a golden orange color with slight head that hung on to the glass. It left a lacy film. The smell was a bit citrusy and fruity, not too strong, slight peppery. There was a tartness at first taste to the tongue, definite hopness, that immediately disappeared and was replaced by sharp citrus flavors. The taste lingered for a while after and left a filmy feel. The overall taste was fairly smooth. Fairly drinkable, not one in which I would particularly pick up again, but good to try."
"This is a fairly smooth beer, but lacks punch. It went down very easy, and is quite sessionable. Extreme beer enthusiasts will scoff at this one, but it is a pretty solid beer. Worth having from time to time."
"It's drinkable, and the robust bitterness gives it its edge. It's just not particularly special otherwise."
"It's drinkable enough, but only because it's bland."
"I've had a few others from St. Peters and really enjoyed them - not quite sure what happened here."
"Ultimately a very good golden ale and probably bolder than most on the malts and hops. Certainly worth a try."
"Drinkability: Low ABV makes this a decent session brew, but I'm thinking the import cost would prohibit that. Not a bad brew...I'm not mad at it, and I wouldn't turn down another."
"500 ml bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 4.7%. Deep golden colour, moderate white head. Very moderate aroma, weak notes of hops and grain, hints of toffee and biscuits. The flavour has decent hops on a slightly sweet base of moderate malts, with a hint of caramel. Distinct hoppy bitterness in the finish and aftertaste. Not a bad beer, but far from the best offering from St. Peter's."
"Not a bad beer, just not my style."
"A solid brew, while not at all outstanding it is certainly quite sessionable."
"Taste is rich and creamy. Hopps are subtle but deffinatly noticable."
"Pours a hazy light golden color with a thin fizzy white head. Aroma is a bit skunky (probably green bottle syndrome), wheat malts, buttery, and some floral and citrus hops. Taste is a little bit of grass, earthy, ends with a touch of hoppy bitterness. Mouthfeel is dry and fairly active on the palate. It's a very drinkable beer, perhaps sessionable. I like this beer, but not my favorite, and not worth the 'import' price for a beer in WV."
"D: Slightly above average drinkability with the tartness and sour citrus flowering hopping giving this a slight edge."
"Not a bad session ale, pours a golden colour with a bit of white head. Grainy, grassy and easy mouthfeel. Medium body. Drying maltish, not a bad finish, a little hops, drinkable for sure. Not staple, but slightly above average brew.Understated carbonation is good."
"Has an orange-hued color with a short white, slightly lacey head. Smells light-struck, grassy, grainy and maybe a bit of biscuit involved. Looks and smells more like a european lager. Tastes of minerally hard water, slightly drying grain husk, lightly smoked tea leaf, and lightly hopped. Has an earthiness to it and slightly silky lactose accompanying the other flavors. But feels rather thin. In general I feel that this beer is lacking in many aspects. Not enough malt or hop or anything to overshadow the the thin yet hard water. Seriously it's about the same quality as an imported macro lager, and has many similar qualities... sigh... sorry I can't seem to find anything exciting in this beer."
"The beer earned a passing grade for taste, but fell horribly short of the mark in all other categories. Nearly every aspect of this beer was bland, lifeless, and uninteresting. I'm not sure I could envision any situation where I'd find this an acceptable, nevermind satisfying pint. I've found St. Peter's beers to be hit or miss - their Golden Ale was nowhere near target."
"Pretty drinkable beer, I wouldn't mind having another two or three!"
"Bottle: Poured a light copper color ale with a dirty white foamy head with good retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of dry English hops with a dry malt base. Taste is slightly bitter from the hops with a nondescript malt base. No flaw could be detected and overall I would have to say that the beer was really refreshing but also lacking some characteristics such as some floral notes."
"Pours a cloudy rusty brown, thin white head forms, quickly settles to a thin collar, some decent lacing, colour is a bit strange though, very muddy. Smell is decent, sweet and malty, some caramel, bread, grassy, soft floral, bit of orange zest, refreshing. Taste is not as good, kind of dull, light maltiness, very bready, some floral, herbal bitterness, bit grassy, otherwise not much. Mouthfeel is light bodied with low carbonation, pretty refreshing and easy to drink but the flavour it throwing me off."
"M&D: slightly more fizzy than it appears to be, but overall the experience on the palate is refreshing rather than sharp. Compared with the Organic Best Bitter that I tried yesterday, this golden ale seems to lack a ""central theme"" to adhere to, hence slightly losing the plot after half a bottle - luckily, the lively bitterness and hoppiness are always the timely saviour that a drinker like me can't do without~~"
"Pours a nice golden colour with a decent white head that laces fairly well. A lot of grain, but also a slight skunky note in the aroma, which I find really disappointing, but somehow predictable. Luckily its not too dominant in the flavour, so I'm glad I drank this on day of purchase and not later. Very grainy flavour with grass, earth and lemon (I'm guessing the last three are from the hopping). Overall too much grain for me to enjoy, and I even picked up on a slightly unpleasant corny undertone that reminded me of macro swill. The mouthfeel is smooth with medium-light body and carbonation. Drinkability, however, suffers greatly from the inbalance of flavours and the nagging hint of skunk. FFS, sort it out. I'm not the first one to have noticed this with this brewery. St. Peter's lighter beers seem to be skunk magnets due to the bottle colour, which is a terrible shame because their heavier, darker brews are fantastic. I would be interested to try this fresh or on tap."
"Tasted on 6/17/08."
"Ill be sure to get some more bottles. Another great beer from St Peter's."
"D - Very drinkable, solid EPA. Nice balanced flavours."
"D - This was pretty good. I liked it better than their English Ale. However, the $5 price tag is about high."
"The taste is weak toasted bread with a lot of bitter lemon rind that makes it sharp and bitter but leaves little real flavour. It almost gave me a sore throat."
"First of all great bottle. I gave the appearance an extra half point for it. The ale poured a nice tinted golden hue with tiny bubbles throughout and a half inch bright white head. Light hop aromatics and pale malt aromas. The flavor made me think ""honey hops"" if that makes any sense. Warming in the mouth, very soft. Very drinkable. Solid ale. The price keeps it from being a session beer around here. If I were to get a raise or win the lotto, this would be one of my favorites to session."
"D,notes: This is a very good beer and highly sessionable. Well balanced with good grain flavor."
"O: Enjoyable.. would have another.. especially with peanuts at the pub.."
"Drinkability : A well-balanced beer in the style pale ale."
"Pours a foggy gold with a decent off white head that leaves a lot of lace on the way down. Hoppy, grainy nose with an apparent earthy tone. Flavor is earthy with mild hops in there. Very earthen and a bit almost dirty it seems. Standard feel. Overall this is decent. I can't say it is the greatest or one I would ever go back to really."
"D: This drinks very nicely. I will be drinking it again."
"D - A nice beer but not my first choice for St Peters."
"D - A nice light bodied ale, would be perfect for a summer quaff as a lawnmower beer. It went well w/ my tilapia - very crisp w/ flavor that makes you want more."
"Poured out of a pint bottle. Nice golden honey color, fair head retention. Smells of flowers, dandelions?, light woody aromas as well. Tastes of toffees, caramels, candys, slightly sweet, yet a great finish thats not too sweet, delicious!. Light, nice smooth pale ale moouthfeel. drinkability is quite easy, great English ale to quaff back anytime. First beer Ive tried from this brewery, very enjoyable."
"This beer wows the drinker with an old-school bottle that is very attractive. Itpours a hearty orange-red with no head at all. It is subtle to smell--you kind of have to get right in there to smell anything at all. Once you get the nose, though, it's very damn good. It's a subtle buttery, burnt caramel nose, but with a hint of coconut liqueur. For such a mild scent, it's surprisingly bold, though expectedly rich and buttery. Pretty good! It's very heavy and syrupy in the mouth, and with a complete lack of carbonation, letting only the hops dictate any pep. It's a pretty tasty beer--very cozy, but a bit too dense and sweet for extended drinking."
"Pours with very good clarity and a pretty, jewel like golden amber hue. No head. Aromas are predominantly grainy, with some honey-sweet malt smells and a touch of cooked/vegetal adjunctish smell. On the palate things are much more pleasant, with some sweetish, caramelized malts that are rounded into shape by a mild hop note at the mild palate. At the finish there's a nice, mellow biscuity note at the end. Mouthfeel is light and emphasizes drinkability. Overall, this is a nice, easy drinking beer that would be really sessionable at a lower ABV. Good."
"drinkability is good. this brew is light bodied and goes down smooth. a solid brew that would suffice for any beer lover. this is an honest beer that doesn't have any extra flavors present to get in the way of the core flavors of malts and hops (and a touch of yeasty goodness). cheers!"
"So far all the light colored St. Peter's (English and IPA plus this one) taste very similar, like variations on a theme of brew. While not bad in their own respect none of them, including this one, stand alone in their category, though all are quite drinkable."
"D: This offering is very much in the St. Peters tradition, as it has that organic flair to it, but is still distinct from the other products in the line. Overall, a drinkable brew that has enough to keep the palate enticed without going overboard. Not bad at all."
"Surprisingly bouncy little brew, I enjoyed the Golden Ale. St. Peter's brews some good ales and this here is another flavorful english pale - nothing too outstanding, but definitely a 'real ale'."
"A fine ""session"" ale from England. Rather complex for the stlye."
"Drinkability-A nice drinkable, British Ale."
"Out of the 5 that I've tried, this is the least to my liking. Good for what it is, simple pale ale, but I thought the presentation of thier IPA was a better rounded quaffer."
"Not a bad beer at all, but IPA lovers will find it lacking in aroma and complexity of flavor, despite the bitter attack."
"Even with a hard pour I didn't get much of a head, just a thin veil of foam around the edges. Pours a light golden color with a tinge of orange. Aroma has hints of coffee, butterscotch, a tiny amount of skunkiness that dissipates after a few moments. Flavor is buttery malt with a perceivable hops presence that is more leafy in character than citrusy. Mouthfeel is pretty nice, a bit on the creamy side. Decent brew, but nothing special."
"Average pale ale, still nice to drink. Don't expect any big flavors out of this one though."
"Good drinkability."
"The beer pours a warm golden color with just a hint of orange and a clean white head that dissipates fast, but leaves a bit of lace. The first whiff from the bottle is all hops, mostly EKG(?), but with just a little citrus. The flavor maintains the hops presence and adds light malt and biscuity notes. The mouthfeel is just a notch heavier than a macro lager. This is a very drinkable beer, and would probably be far more impressive on cask. The only thing that gets in the way of this becoming a house beer for me (other than that I'm a homebrewer) is the nearly $3 a bottle price. This is a nicely executed English Ale. It's just not a $3 a bottle ale."
"St. Peter's Golden Ale definitely has the appearance and presentation of a good pale ale. It pours a very nice orange gold color and displays decent lacing, though minimal head retention. It's got a great nose too. Notes of citrus and coffee are predominant with some hops showing through. The flavor however, is underwhelming. It's mostly coffee and musty yeast with a bit of weak citrus. Not nearly as good as the nose. The mouthfeel is somewhat thin as well. There was also a lot of yeast sediment in the bottom as well which may have contributed to the musty flavor. All in all, it's not a bad ale, just disappointing. Everything leading up to the flavor was quite good only to be finished with mediocrity. However, the bottle is pretty cool, so it's worth having at least once."
"Very soft and smooth in the mouth  quite cask-like character and very quaffable. A nice drinkable, and very British Ale."
"Overall I was not thrilled with this. Sure, it was better than typical large brewery beer but the bottle looked like it would be better than it was. Definite ""Pale Ale"" components but the taste was off for me. I'll finish the bottle but probably won't be buying more, especially at the price."
"Overall: An odd offering thats worth a try, but not much more."
"Drank fairly easy. Not a bad bottled English PA at all, just lacked some astethics"
"We've had better ales, but please, don't [you] think this is a generic, run of the mill ale."
"A respectable ale, but at $3 a bottle I don't know if it's worth picking up on a regular basis. Why St. Peter's doesn't sell this cheaper I'm not sure."
"The overall smoothness of this beer is what really grabbed me. Nice looking pale gold body with a creamy little head. Light wheat and citrus combo in the scent and on the tongue. Just very tasty. No a huge mouthfeel, but consistent. Absolutely an easy drinking ale. It goes down effortlessly."
"The first taste is crisp and cool; there is, following that, imho, a not so pleasant hop bitterness that carries through to the finish spoiling an otherwise good mouthfeel and sturdiness. THe malt does not balance; itsw still complex enough to arouse interest, and by all means try this stuff; just make sure its accompanied by a nice big calzone stuffed with eggplant and sausage. Then I bet its tremendous."
"Notes: Overall it was below average in my book and nothing to keep on hand as a staple beer. I will definately try their other offerings though as this is a pretty complex beer for the style it just didn't come together well."
"OK drinkability here but I can think of many ales of this style that I like better. An interesting beer that you should try but I can only recommend as a novelty brew."
"mouth: Sour upon entering the mouth with a delicious, lasting, extremely bitter swallow that heats up the back of the mouth and throat on the way down. This beer has just the right amount of carbonation and is very drinkable. It is extremely refreshing but manages to pack high quality AND quantity flavor. Hints of pitted fruits (peaches/apricots) which linger from the scent and a tinge of gooseberry."
"Or even if it doesn't."
"I like sublteness in ales as much as hop bombs but this is so sublte as to be non-existant. Kind of a bummer as it was a bit expensive..."
"This beer pours a light copper color with a small head from a 16.9 ounce green bottle. Aroma is hoppy with a bit of grain. Taste has good, solid malt backbone with hops noticeable toward the finish. This is a pretty good pale ale. I'm really impressed with this brewery, I haven't had a bad beer from them yet. Recommended."
"Nice appearance in the glass. It had a golden color as the name suggests but it had a strange cloudiness which I did not expect and is very unusual for this style. Small head, that dissapated quickly. The beer had a nice aroma filled with hoppiness and some citrus. Tha flavor followed with more hoppiness and citrus with a slight bitterness on the back end. This was nice beer to drink and would recommend it to British beer lovers."
"Not bad... I'd try again."
"Pours from pint bottle into pint glass to a full golden honey color, very flat pour with a one half finger head that rises of large bubbles and fades to near nothing, no laceing except for tiny spots following the beer down the glass. The smell is a full boquet, very powerful grain malts say ale all the way with a nice mix of floral hop aroma, more sweet malt and some sour grain. Taste is full and more complex than I expected from the look and pour creamy sweet malt mixes well with a nice bitter hop kick at the end. The middle lacks a little, but the hop kick was and pleasant surprise. The mouthfeel is creamy but a bit watery and under carbonated. Overall a good brew but not one that I would choose on a regular basis. If your offered one drink and you will enjoy."
"Paid $4.19 for a bottle. Damn, that's steep. I don't know about it really being golden in color, more of a pale ale appearance. There is a winey smell in the nose. Taste is good, nice malts, good alpha - maybe too much. Alcohol is noticeable. Bubble is sharp but small and not foamy. Good session beer."
"I haven't been overly thrilled with the two other St. Peter's beers that I've tried. Golden Ale is a head scratcher more than anything else. It's far from unpalatable, but if flavor is high on your list of priorities, look elsewhere."
"A very clear golden pour with a fluffy foamy head that faded slightly but laced throroughly. I smelled something not unlike raw wild honey and some tart citrus. Grassy, citrussy, a bit of bread.... like being a kid and soaking my bread in orange juice (don't ask). Not as sweet as OJ, somewhere inbetween Tangerine and Grapefruit. There was a residue that lingered unpleasantly but not horribly offensive. Served cold it was quite refreshing until the residue was the remaining quality."
"Other comments: A very long, slow flavor ""evolution"" on the first sip. Just when you're about to call it too sweet, a nice hop bitterness creeps in and hangs around long after you've finished drinking the beer."
"Comes in a very classy flask shaped bottle. Very enjoyable."
"My first sip almost erradicated the smell from my memory. It was light, floral and quite tasty. I found myself liking this brew more and more with each sip. The character of this brew has the confindence to know you will grow to respect it, even after any initial hesitations."
"Mouthfeel: Low carbonation (which is perfect for English beers), nice creamy texture."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"This beer is a murky, almost muddy, earth colored brew. The head is wispy and very thin. English hop aroma with a yeasty undertone. Very earthy and rustic smell, with just a touch of sulfur. The taste is light and delicate, considering the appearance and aroma. Its a touch grainy, with a very mild maltiness: caramel with a light doughy-ness. Yeast and hops mingle in the flavor, and the mouthfeel is soft, gentle, and creamy. Low carbonation. Drinkable and enjoyable, but not outstanding."
"Drinkability  This was delightfully bigger than I expected but would still make for a wonderful daytime sipper."
"This brew is a deep golden color, with a small white bubbly head topping it off. The scent is sweet malt, buttery, flowery hops. Fairly buttery up front with a pepper hop bite. Sweet malt with a bit of honey and wood. Smooth, full mouth. Pretty good for such a light beer."
"Its drinkable it chilled ICE COLD but even for the nice price of 2.99 I don't see me purchasing more."
"To me this is a very drinkable and refreshing beer"
"Pours an amber color with skimpy head and no lacing. Smells of honey and sweet malts very nice nose here. Taste is very nice; malts, honey and a nice sweet smoothness to it. Feels very creamy smooth and is easy to drink. Nothing spectacular, but a nice drinkable brew."
"This came over as nothing more than a thirst-quencher. Nothing after the color to make you want it. Add it to your list of beers tried and move on.I was quite disappointed by this brew, not up to the standards set by the others I've enjoyed from St. Peters."
"Overall: Beautiful. Looks nice, decent nose, great tastes, drinks exceptionally well and is a great all round Golden Ale. About as close to a Golden Real Ale in a Bottle as you will ever get."
"Time for the golden ale now. Like the appearance of this beer. Poured out a golden color, but it was more like a dark gold color with carbonation that was visible and lacing that was happening all the way until the end. Smell was a little left to be desired I thought. It was malty, hoppy, and slightly buttery, but It just seemed to be all over around. Luckily the taste made up for it. Malts mixed with honey hit the palate first then blend in with the hops that last through the aftertaste. Finishes on the peppery side but has that wet spot in the aftertaste. Tea like finish as well. Creamy and smooth, One of the better golden ales on the market. Excellent."
"Clear golden-yellow in color, small white head that doesn't last long, light floral aromas. Light grainy flavors with some sweet honey flavors in the finish, light bodied, crisp and clean, not much going on with this one, may be a decent session beer."
"It pours a dark golden color with a thin head. It has a woody, fruity, and nutty aroma. The body is malty with some fruit and nut character as well as a tinge of anise. It has a hoppy and grainy finish. A very nice ale. It is easy drinking and tasty."
"1 pint 0.9 oz bottle is quite unique in appearance, with its antique, oval shape. Pours a slightly hazy, gold color with a small ivory head that quickly fades away, with minimal, patchy lace. Aroma is restrained, with caramel maltiness and English herbal hoppiness. Mouthfeel is light bodied, to the point of feeling watery, and carbonation is low. Taste is biscuity, slight caramel, and funky, bitter English hops. This seems watered down, and lacks any substantial character. Finish is bitter and metallic. For such an expensive looking bottle, the contents are a disappointment."
"A classic case of 'don't judge a book by its cover'."
"The beer pours a cloudy dark golden color with a lacey white head. The aroma is yeasty with a breadlike smell. There is a carapils smell here sneaking through to accompany the darker than average color. The taste is bitter and breadlike. It's watery and lacking complexity. The mouthfeel sucks. This is a light bodied ale with no carbonation; the beer is flat. The beer is a horrible drinker. This beer sucks, but I've had worse."
"Pours from tha trademark St.Peter's oval flask as clear gold under a one finger white head with bubbles that leave next to no lace. The nose is mild but flowery, with more malt coming out as it warms. The mouth is prickly and medium-bodied. The taste experience opens with a great hoppy bite reminiscent of the best pale ales. A good malty backbone provides excellent context for the hops. The finish is bitter and flowery, leaving a crisp aftertaste. This is a great drinkin' brew!"
"St. Peter's is a must for bottle collectors. Their olive green flask-style shape is one of a kind. This one pours a bright golden color with mostly medium to large sized bubbles and thin wisps of lace. The mild aroma is of sweet malt and hops. The malt body is more substantial than it appears providing a nice biscuity and lightly herbal quality. The hops are somewhat grapefruity, with a mild lemon and faint metallic after bite. Hints of fruity flavors linger in the background."
"Flavor is very golden ale-like. Semi lagery tasting, with perhaps a little bit of ale like esteriness. Maybe a hint of grape. Very smooth, mild carbonation. I'd like to say more about this beer, but it's just kind of dull. I really don't like goldings hops."
"This beer pours a light orange/yellow color with a small white head that dies off quickly. There is not really any lacing left on the glass. The aroma was a little skunky and yeasty. The flavor was not very smooth and had a ""green"" taste. I do not particularly like this flavor as it is a little too tart."
"Now with a piece of breaded, fried salmon on a plate in front of me and a dollop each of ketchup and mustard, the fragrance of the beer dances up to my nose with a message of pale fruits and fresh cheeses. Wonderfully pure, watery sweet fruit like melon, bartlett pears and white plums. It tastes like it smells. What luck to have a plate of this kind of food with this kind of beer. Neither are my usual, but they go together seemlessly. It's not that the fish is very good either...careless, powdery breading, plus I burned one side. But it loves the beer. It seems like a brilliant compromise between the many robust Pale Ales you get in bottle from Britain and the need for lighter alcohol, more refreshing beer. Faint gas pressure makes it just creamy, nearly like a Nitro package, but there are alive, unpasteurized flavors alight on my tongue too: a permanent delicate bitterness from boiled hops forms the base for moss, lychens, birch bark, driftwood, romaine hearts, whipped cream and lemon leaf."
"Lingering aftertaste is just a bit bitter, but is a great way to end the beer."
"A golden/orange color with normal cream colored foam and a slightly hoppy aroma mixed in with a light skunkyness. The flavor is fruity malt and green hops finishing with a light caramel malt and earthy hop dryness. The body is medium and has a slightly cookie/grainy flavor making for an average summery ale."
"This is another of the St Peter's beers out of my sampler pack and I must say I have been impressed by all of them. The Golden Ale poured a light amber color with a small head that left a good lace throughout the whole glass. The smell was very sweet and inviting. The taste was more roasty and burnt than I expected but very good indeed, and had just a touch of bitterness at the end. I noticed however that the sweet tastes came out more as the beer warmed a bit. Out of the 3 beers I've tried in my pack, which are the cream stout, old style porter and the golden ale, I've noticed that they all have a slightly roasted or burnt flavor to them, which I think is very tasty. Another great brew from England."
"at first, this beer tasted like charcoal, and nothing else. it was very very strange. as i went through it, i got some nice sweet malts and hops that were balanced very well, but i could not shake that terrible charcoal taste. i don't know if something was wrong with this beer, but it was just not good at all. body was smooth with very light carbonation, which would have made it very drinkable if the taste was not so horrible."
"Notes: A very tasty little golden ale, such a complex brew for a smaller built ale. It also feigns as a cask ale with the lighter carbonation, this real “real ale”."
"Pours a deep golden color with adecent creamy white head that fades to a lasting, thick film.  The smell is of earthy hops and some slight toasted malt.  Smooth toasty malts are evident with some very subtle earthy hop tones in the background that don't really do much to add bitterness to the brew.  The brew is smooth and not at all crisp as it should be for the style and this detracts from the drinkability of this brew.  This is a nice brew but not a good golden ale.  It lacks the hoppy bitterness and crispness that is typical for the style, if you know that going in though, it is a good tasting brew."
"This beer tastes solid, a traditional english ale.  It is worth tasting if you can find this, and you get a flask-shaped bottle ta boot.  Cheers!"
"A nice golden colored ale, not heavy, low carbonation.  The after taste is only slightly hoppy and not bitter.  The ABV is 4.7%."
"This is more of a Best Bitter IMO. Deep gold (of course) with decent head retention. Malty grainy nose and a hint of floral hop. Definite ale like fruity-ester character and a partially dry finish with a lasting bitterness. Quite smooth and drinkable. With the exception of the ginger-lemon spiced ale, St. Petes puts out some good brews. Definitely worth a try."
"First off love the bottle, great idea to use a flask style bottle. I bought this yeasterday and had 2 right away. As I poured  the first the color was just great and the aroma made my mouth water. I noticed that the beer had a thin head that vanished quickly. Very easy to drink, this is a beer you can have several of and not feel the effects of gravity. If you see this beer do yourself a favor and buy it."
