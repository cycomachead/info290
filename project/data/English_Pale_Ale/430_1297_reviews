"Overall: I didn't rate this beer very high for the sole reason that it is billed as a blend of English Pale and Irish Red. It doesn't fit either style very well. However, it is still a very enjoyable ale that I would buy again."
""
""
"This beer is a little more complex than it would appear.  It is rich and smooth.  It is not hoppy per the current American fashion."
""
"This is a very nice Ale. It's smooth and easy to drink. Very nice flavor, though not totally unique, very enjoyable."
""
"Refreshing beer, tastes more like a standard lager to me. Hints of ale flavor creep into the finish."
"Reminds me a lot of Miller - corn based and not a lot to it.  I will not drink again."
""
"I wasn't keen on this ale upon drinking the first bottle.  However, I have finally decided this is an okay brew.  There's not a lot of carbonation, the head starts out at about half an inch and quickly dissipates to  a thin white peel.  This is not an offensive drink, nor is it world class.  But if you just want to enjoy a nice ale blend, then this might work for you.  I'll buy it again on occasion."

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has dark golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is a bit weak, some light malts. Taste is well balanced. Hops and a mild bitterness up front, malts at the finish, some hints of caramel. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a refreshing and easy drinking beer."

"I poured this average looking labeled beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was a orangey amber looking concoction tat looked a little on the cloudy side. The head was tan and decent. The beer smelled pretty good like sweet rolls. However the taste was ciderish, much like the crap I made with the Mr. Beer kit. I will not buy again,yuk!"

"O - For the style advertised this is a nice choice. Maybe I'm biased living so close to the brewer but I think I'd like this if it came from 1000 miles away."
"Like the nose, I get a good caramel malt character in the flavor which stands strong for a moment as the earthy, clean hop finish kicks in. I found it be drinkable and likable."
"Presentation: Packaged in a standard twelve-ounce brown glass long neck bottle with a pry-off crown, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice."

"Described a cross between and English Pale and an Irish Red. For me I really taste the Irish Red. It is a little too light for me with not a great body. There is almost no after taste to enjoy. A buddy of mine picked some up at a world market in Cleveland, TN. If I were in a Kentucky city for a stopover I might enjoy a few cold ones and then move onto something else."

"of opening a daily pour. I have the feeling that the aim was to introduce the Budweisier drinker to a micro brew. That's the kiss of death for me. I'm always on the lookout for a beer with a frugal price. Back to trader joe for old standby's. If I'm going to drink ale Fat Weasel is much better. I'm surprised that Ky Ale gets better marks than FW."

"Wait, there's no barrel here? Anyway, this stuff pours a clear sunset brass topped by a half-finger of off-cream foam. The nose comprises mild honey, milder biscuit, light apple, and a vague smattering of flowers. It's light and simple, but fairly pleasant regardless. The taste brings in more of the same, with that pesky apple character playing a larger role. It's this apple-ness that really detracts from the positives a bit too much for my tastes. The body is a light medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a generally fluid feel. Overall, a nice little English-esque brew, one I could see being a mild-ish staple if I found myself in Kentucky, but that damn apple character doesn't endear the beer to me all that much."

"Overall, a great, cheap session beer! (I live in Kentucky, might be cheaper for me than most)"

"O - Decent, not great."

"O: This beer is very easy to drink and has a nice smooth mouthfeel, although the taste seems a little bland."
"12oz bottle, pours amber with a thin off-white head that leaves little lacing on the glass. Aromas are sweet and malty with toasted grain and caramel dominating the nose, slightly earthy. Tastes match the aroma with more malty sweetness, toasted grain, bready, prickly, earthy, modest piny hop bite on the end. Feel is thin-medium and creamy. Overall, not too bad. I get the Irish Red, I get the EPA, but nothing ground shaking here. Well put together for what it is though. Not sure that I'd buy it again."

"I might like this beer more if it didn't remind me of Magic Hat #9 on so many levels. But prejudice aside, it's smooth. Flavor profile is consistent. It's smooth. Perhaps I have cracked the secret recipe of the #9. Anyways. This is an easy drinking beer. Interesting mix of styles."

"O: A good beer that does Lexington well. Bourbon barrel ale is better, though, and more unique. So, if you're buying beer in Lexington, spend the extra dollar and get the bourbon beer."
""
""
""
"In conclusion, a pretty adequate beer with enough off notes to keep you from coming back. So here's to comrades near and far, so raise a glass, raise your voices."

"Overall a very enjoyable, simple ale. A nice casual go-to beer for the spring and summer."
""
"OVERALL: An average session ale, not that theres anything wrong with that."
"Overall I was somewhat impressed by this beer. Some good flavor but still light enough to have several of. I'll probably pick up some more of this."
"O- Nothing really great, however it still manages to be a pleasantly drinkable beer. Not a bad choice for intoducing someone to craft beer either."
""
"The first was okay. The second made me wish I had ordered something else."
""
"O:  Decent English Pale.  Comparable to a Bass if you ask me.  Nothing groundbreaking, but not bad either, especially since this is a local offering for me.  Seems to pair pretty well with most food types – since it is pretty mild, it does a decent job supporting most food offerings without getting in the way."

"I'm not quite as intricate as others with my reviews, but I will say I do recommend this beer. It is not the ""best beer on earth," but certainly makes for a great regional brew. I used to live in Lexington, and have had this beer many times. I prefer it on draft in Lexington, but a bottle is fine as well. It is definitely a beer that is highly drinkable - one seems to lead to anther."

"Sorry guys but just getting the carbonation right isn't enough...you need balance. Edit, it looks well carbonated but it creates burps which I don't enjoy!"
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being moderate. Overall it was a lighter, easy drinking beer with some pretty decent flavors to it. I liked the honey, floral like flavors that got out of it. It wasn't bad at all, but it just didn't have anything that really stood out either."
"Taste like Crystal malt, with notes of plum and other mystery fruit. Syrupy in the mouthfeel. No hoppiness to it, and a long Nyquill like aftertaste that lingered forever"
"Notes: This one is straight forward a very sessionble beer. Cheers."
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, decent beer to drink for a while but there are better beers in the style."
"Pours a clear, copper color. Two inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of sweet malt, slight earthy malt, slight grain, slight hops, and hint of spice. Fits the style of an English Pale Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, grain, slight floral, slight citrus hops, and pale malt. Overall, good appearance, decent aroma and body."
"Decent beer but nothing crazy here."
"Overall: Not a bad beer, but nothing that really stands out either. An easy drinking potentially sessionable beer, but there are several others in the style I would go to a lot quicker."
"Not sure how this fits into the EPA category, or any other category except for the watery, blah, you've-got-some-nerve,-pal category. Decent white head; plenty of nothing in the aroma; plenty of corn in the taste with a side of peaches and even a little... prunes? Something along those lines. A lot like Old Speckled Hen. In other words, not worth decoding. Pass."
"D - I finished the first one so quickly, I wished I had a second. I will definitely pick up more of this one. I usually put in comments about when the beer warms up, but I didn't get to it on this one because it was gone so quickly!"
"Thanks to my great Wife for bringing this one back with her from a trip to Lexington. Nice deeper amber color with a slight off white head. Aroma is gentle with caramel malts leading the way and some hoppy bitterness following, faintly piney. Taste is much the same with a generally good balance of sweet and bitter. Feel is very smooth, and has some slight oilyness on the finish. Overall a good beer, though not the best in the style."
"Overall, it was a good beer. A cut above BMC, but nothing special by any means."
"Not terrible, and a nice, light brew. However, this one's got no complexity or any trace of a unique flavor profile. Very average, any way you cut it. I wouldn't buy one of these again."
"On to the Bourbon Barrel Ale. I don't have high hopes considering it's just a -bal aged version of this...."
"Amber-colored ale topped with about one finger of head which dissolves in 10-15 seconds. The odor is faint but smells grassy and sweet. Tastes creamy and bready with a little undertone of citrus and caramel. Has a nice weight to it-not something you'd want to drink in mass quantity but great when having a pint or three."
"As far as the date on the neck goes, I'm not sure if that's best by or produced on, but I'd imagine it's the latter. I don't think BEERchitect would send me spoiled brew."
"Drinkability: This a fairly balanced and simple beer; I can see it going with just about anything as far as food goes. While not spectacular on its own, this beer may serve as my local go-to brew for its consistency and its originality. A big step above many macro-brews, and a drink like this is probably a good crossover beer for macro drinkers."
"I guess if macros are your thing this could be your thing. Not for me. Life is short, drink great beer."
"D - With my growing preference for darker stouts, probably won't chase this down again after this six pack."
"Kentucky Light is a pretty good low-ABV kolsch that stacks up very well against its light lager competition. Unfortunately, Lexington's Kentucky Ale is the lesser beer all around. It isn't bad, exactly, but it isn't anything to get excited about either. Ho-hum."
"I don't see this as being a good representative of the EPA."
"This was refreshing and not all that bad, but it wasn't anything special either. Just a typical Pale Ale."
"This brew is not too bad really. Not the best beer ever, but I like it alright. I usually pick some up every now and then because I like the fact that it is brewed in Kentucky and I want to do my part to support our local breweries."
"Overall not bad. Nothing I would probably go after again, but I would have a hard time saying this one was bad in any way. Certainly average."
"D - not sure about this one. not an awful beer, just certainly nothing special. might be a good gateway beer."
"Overall decent enough brew. Nothing stands out about it, but I'd take this over any EPA I had in the old country!"
"I may be a little biased, for I live just a few miles away from the city it is made in. Definitely something local KY beer geeks like to drink on the cheap."
"Pours a super clear and pale amber with nice bubbling, lack luster head after the pour, but a nice film of foam. The aroma is a week water craker malt and some musty hop. The taste starts a little tinny, then watery melba toast with a lemon twist. Palate is pretty thin overall."
"D: This isn't a terrible beer, but it's pretty lousy for its style. I'd certainly rather drink this than most BMC style beers, but some of those might do better on ratings because at least they are good examples of their style."
"I ordered this knowing nothing about the beer or the brewery. Visually it was a clear copper colour with a tight white head. Tastes like an American pale ale with a touch of another grain in there (rye or wheat maybe ?). The hops were very restrained and the adjuncts left a strange after taste. Not bad but I couldn't drink it all night."
"This is a run of the mill, average Pale Ale all around. Perhaps a Kentucky locals way to combat the likes of a Bud, MGD, Coors, etc. This one is far superior to all of those, but is on even ground in terms of lack of originality. At least this no frills, no noticeable flaws beer has some flavour to it. Eh."
"Overall this is a decent EIPA, though it's nothing to write home about."
"Drinkability - Supposedly this beer was designed along the lines of Smithwicks. A very drinkable beer but nothing too impressive. A decent everyday beer though."
"Taste is very very malty, lots of bready, rye flavors going on. Nose, intensified, and much sweeter. Mouthfeel is pretty decent- sudsy, chewy, slick. Overall a pretty decent beer- much preferred over the light version. A bit too sweet for my taste, but not at all shabby."
"Bottle from Ashland Beverage Center. The beer is a clear yellow-amber color with a thin and foamy white head that disappears quickly. Thin strings of lacing. Mild malt and caramel aroma. Light body with with sweet grain, malt and fruit flavors. Just a hint of hops bitterness in the background. The finish is short with a sweet malt aftertaste. Barely average overall."
"D - Nothing really stood out for me with this beer if I wasn't drinking it right know I would have nothing to remember to review theres better beers out there."
"D: Extremely quaffable. Maybe a good lawn mower beer but just not interesting enough beyond that. Thanks for the bottle, Jonathan :)"
"All around solid ale. Amber in color with a decent head. The flavor is much better than I anticipated so I was quite pleased. Standard flavor for an english style ale. The taste is good and the price is right unfortunately it is hard to find in this area. I will pick more up if I ever run across it again."
"I drank this in copious amount sin college, as I lived in Lexington and it was usually $2 or less at the bar. Just picked up a sixer on a weekend excursion to Kentucky. Poured a nice amber color, with inch worth of foam that slowly faded leaving behind little lace. Sweet smelling on the nose, with hints of fruit. Nice caramel malt use in the taste, hints of noble hops in the background, very malty and sweet. Refreshing, easy to drink quite a few of these in one sitting. Not as good as it bourbon-barrel aged big brother, but good nonetheless."
"Overall, I consider this ale better than the local rival's American pale ale brewed by Bluegrass Brewing company. I have seen this ale many times in the local liquor stores but always picked up something else. If it is similar in taste as the version on tap, I may purchase a six pack now and then. With the low ABV and refreshing flavor this could be a classic English session ale."
"Overall, this beer is pretty average across the board."
"Drinkability: Have this one all day... refreshing, light, un-offensive. Nothing really outstanding... just a good solid beer."
"A -"
"I like this beer - a real quaffer."
"It pours a light tan color with nice head formation which is very durable for a non-secondary fermented beer. Aroma is light caramel balanced with hops. I could tell from this preview that this wasn't going to be a hop-fest, but might be nicely balanced (between malt and hop), like McTarnahan's Amber. Flavor was fairly balanced. However, flavor was a bit watery with some cerealness. This beer was rather drinkable and uncomplicated, but not immensely commendable."
"Drinkability: a pretty average beer that is not as refreshing as I would like. After the glass was empty, I was looking for something else."
"Poured from the bottle, this beer gave good first impression, decent head, nice carbonation, nice light copper color. After that, it was all average. Smell very mild hop, as was the taste, nothing real bitter, just mild. Mouthfeel was fairly light and a little flat. All in all, average at best."
"Not bad by any means, but could use more body."
"Pours a clear golden in color, with a white head of moderate duration. Simple, pale malt-driven nose and not at all indicative of the flavor! This is to say that Kentucky Ale has a wonderful, almost exceptional malt profile and flavor and it is definitely on-style. Might be something of a turn-off for hopheads as there's almost no hop presence to speak of: instead of the bitter beer aftertaste you may instead appreciate something of a clover honey-ish character and herbals aromatic notes, both of which make this one hell of an easy drinking beer. Light on the palate, but hardly boring: I caught a very slight astringecy alongside the moderate carbonation . . . plenty of finesse to this one. Dry-ish finish, with more herbal aromatic notes lingering. A very nice rendition of a British style Pale Ale."
"Not much of a smell to it at all, and this beer is very bland. I'd recommend it over your BMC brews, but other than that it is nothing very special at all. It's drinkable because its so thin and light."
"I admire the simplicity of this one and the flavors that it accomplishes."
"Very drinkable beer. Nothing outstanding but a good session beer. Could be well liked by the BMC drinkers. Maybe something to help transition one over to good beer...lol."
"On to the beer itself. The appearance is nothing spectacular although it does have a dark appearance leading you to believe its going to be rich. The smell is nothing out of the ordinary and is what you would expect. The taste is far richer than other beers its price and makes it an easy choice over the larger brands. Mouthfeel is good and overall drinkability is good. Many times this is the beer that finds its way into the fridges of my friends as its a good staple ""drinking beer"" as we call it."
"I'm not originally from Kentucky, but currently go to school there. I saw this on the list of beers at a bar and thought what the heck. This beer far surpased my expectations, and everyone else who tried it also liked it. It made me want to try more of what this brewing company makes."
"Rounded mouthfeel, not overcarbonated. Quite nice, very drinkable."
"Easily drinkable, but just a completely average beer."
"Inviting reddish amber, clear. Thin head. Smells of lightly toasted grain. Subtle sweetness. Rather nice hint of vanilla and biscuity aroma. Light bodied feel, smooth with modest carbonation. Not a bad beer really. I may be judging this beer a little too harshly because, for me, their Bourbon Barrel Ale is a far superior ale."
"Not exactly a thriller in my book, but then, wasn't meant to be. I wouldn't be so rude as to turn any down, however."
"Suprisingly good flavor. Not great, but good. Malty yet bright."
"Overall: A nice effort from a brewer in my beloved home commonwealth. Nothing mind-boggling, but a solid, subtle English pale."
"This is a nice drinkable ale that can be enjoyed by enthusiasts and macro-drinkers alike. Nothing out of this world but a decent example of the style."
"A pretty tasty beer that is well crafted and drinkable."
"mouthfeel: medium body"
"A solid and drinkable beer. Definitely worth trying."
"Overall: Average to above average american try at the English version. I liked this one better fresh and on tap than in the bottle. I'd really like to try this on cask and/or nitro..."
"Being from Kentuuuucky, I'm relatively excited to see what the folks at Kentucky Ale have to offer. Doesn't look too promising...a very wimpy and unimpressive amber with a magical, vanishing head of white. Smells of moderately high alcohol with pine and caramel strands. Distinct and simple (in a good way). It tastes sweeter than expected, the caramel resonating on the palate the whole way through. In the end, it warms pleasantly into a smooth, buttery taste. The pep of carbonation is beautifully offset by an uncanny smoothness. A very enjoyable drink!"
"Really glad I was given the chance to try this brew...a solid offering and my first from the Lexington BC."
"Impression: A better beer than what I was able to describe. Something more of a English Red style than an American Pale Ale. Even at that, a better Red than most that I have tried. Nicely balanced and aged. Very fresh and thirst quenching. However, this is one of few beers that I prefer from the bottle than on tap."
"Overall, a very easily drinkable English Pale. I could see myself having a 6er of this in my fridge at all times if I lived in Kentucky."
"Mouthfeel is light of medium, nice carbonation very crisp and refreshing. Drinkability is good this would be a great warm weather thirst quencher. Don't think the style listed on BA is right but still not bad little beer."
"Alright. So, some breweries want to boast abour brewery fresh beer. I helped out with bottling of this beer tonight and this bottle comes from the run we just did about an hour and a half ago. That is brewery fresh beer my friends. It pours a deep copper color with a 2 finger head that falls to not much over top The nose is nice, with a good caramel base and a slight citrus and spicey hop. Much more of a hop profile than I recall finding in this beer before. The flavor is also caramel, with a very slight diacetyl butteryness, but not in a bad way. The hops are more subdued in the flavor, giving just a slight hop bitter, but not much flavor. The feel is moderate with a moderate carbonation. Well balanced between feel and bubble. Drinkability is very good. Its smooth and crisp. Very drinkable. A very good show for my hometown beer!"
"This was, to say the least, a very refreshing beer. Like I said I tried to walk into this one with an open unbiased mind and I really think I did it. This was a good beer that is worth a try, don't avoid it."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed 3/4"" of off-white head over the clear light copper brew. Head fades to half its height and holds more or less steady, with nice foamy lacing. Aroma is lightly of sweet malt and hops. Taste is pale malt sweetness coupled with a balancing amount of medium bitter hops. Mouthfeel is good, pretty smooth, and the drinkability is even better, with high sessionablility. Pleasant English-style pale ale."
"Drinkability - I like Kentucky Ale. On the sweeter side for a session pick, but its smooth character makes 'em disappear fast."
"This ale poured a clear, light copper color (hazy if the sediment was poured) with light tan foam that settled but clung to the glass and coated it. There was a good carbonation. The smell was sweetish malt with some floral hops. The taste was lightly sweet and malty with light floral hops and a mild hop bitterness with a touch of citrus. The mouthfeel was very smooth and creamy with medium-light body and modest carbonation. It was relatively clean but a light hoppiness lingered. This was an easy to drink, nice, balanced pale ale."
"Didn't realize that I hadn't reviewed this out of the bottle yet. Pours a copper color with a medium white head that doesn't stay around too long. The aroma is malty and full of caramel notes. Not much hop to be found. The flavor is much the same. Quite sweet and malty with caramel being the main flavor. Body is good and the drinkability is good. It's actually a mixture between two different styles (having talked to the brewer about it), neither of which is an APA ... so the style is wrong here on BA. But it's a nice session beer."
"Pours a white, one-fingered head, fades quickly and leaves some lace. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied. Clear amber color. Light malt nose. Starts with a mix of hops and sweetness and finishes smooth like the brewer says - no bitter aftertaste. $1.25 for a 12oz bottle from Liquor Barn Lexington, KY."
"Got this from BIF 15 from oracle. Pours out a clear light copper color with about an inch of off white head that dies quickly. Aroma is light with malt and a faint grassiness. Taste was more malt than anything with caramel sweetness being the only real component to stand out. Maybe a faint hoppiness in the slightly bitter dry after taste but that might be stretching it. Body was light to medium with good carbonation. Drinkability was decent enough, not a bad beer just not a typical pale ale. I would definitely take this over the macros but this is below average."
"Nope no significant difference. Mostly malt and sweet carmel. Few if any hops. I like the beer, but it's not an APA"
"I picked these up in Lexington, in passing. At home it poured a nice looking copper-amber. The head at a half inch, left little lace. The carbomation was moderate about the body of the same grade. Nothing over the top here. The malt I think favors this brew while balanced by a slight hop. The mouth is left with a faint, not bad, hop dryness. Drinkability is there for like I said, nothing over the top here to bother anyone."
"Clear copper body with a white head. Faint hops are pretty much all Im getting in the nose. Its a dry beer with fairly little malt in there. Some grassy hops is all there is of the flavor. This is pretty bland and pretty much a dissappointment, although I wasnt really expecting much from a brewery that makes nothing but an ""ale"" and a ""light."""
"Clear, golden-amber in hue, no animation. A foamy white head of a finger in height topped off the beer; the head retention was very good, it slowly faded before gently resting as a tight cap. The subsequent lacing was spotty and insignificant. Still the appearance of this beer was decent. The nose doesnt say much. All I get is an impression that this is an ale because there is very vague fruitiness. The hops contribute minimal aromas, maybe a kiss of citrus. Little more. There are some notes of grain and a hint of caramel maltiness. The potency is weak. The bouquet is not inviting but not offensive either, in other words it is apathetic. The palate vaguely falls into what I would call a Pale Ale. It obviously lays closer to the English versions than a hoppy-ass American adaptations. I am always happy to quaff a good EPA, is this one of them? The bitterness is odd, it is not very bright and it seems very wide yet swallow. And largely flavorless, a faint kiss of citrus. This works in combination with yeast fruitiness, which is also faint. The grainy, caramel malt flavors easily penetrate the hops, which kind of muddles the taste especially in the middle and finish. The malt isnt tasty like an English Pale Ale, it is boring like an American but without the bold hoppiness the palate comes off dull. Lazy aftertaste, nothing tries to standout. This is far from a bad beer; honestly it doesnt taste much of anything. Nothing is very distinct and the muddled flavors do little for me. Medium in body, low carbonation but not low enough to be bothersome, the mouthfeel is passable. It is drinkable; I think this is little more than lawnmower beer. So there is a time and a place for Kentucky Ale. Thanks SheepNutz!"
"Kentucky ale is brewed here in Lexington and I have had it both on tap and in the bottle. It is frequently offered for 2 bucks a pint at Pazzo's and is a great deal at that price. The ale pours as a slightly darker/amber lager, it's a combination of the lager and scottish ale styles actually. When served cold, the beer will have a medium frothy head and will have a slight fruit smell to the top of it. The taste is very solid for a lager, not tasting too bitter nor getting overpoweringly sweet. This beer is great for drinking several of, very easy to get down and recommended for the price."
"I love the taste of this, although there is really nothing stellar to speak of. Seems like pale malt, some buttery notes, fresh baked bread, and a restrained use of floral hops. Very smooth and pleasantly drinkable. Reminds me of a fresh Bass Pale Ale. This would be an ideal session ale."
"It's ok, but so are a thousand other pale ales."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a deep amber color with one finger of head that dies away quickly. There is minimal lacing left on the glass. The smell is malty and sweet, with just a touch of hops. Not too much on the nose. The taste is malty and a little bland. Some sweetness to it. Not much hops presence. The mouthfeel is a little watery, but the drinkability is fairly good. A sub-par pale ale."
"Appearance is a deep golden completely see through nice sized white head large bubbled carbonation, lacing is intricate and nice. Aroma is slightly metallic, semi sweet watery malt profile. A bit grassy and herbal in the nose with a subtle sweetness, very reserved overall. Flavor has a sour twang that just isn't working again light herbal hops maybe some prickly citric notes coming through just barely. Again watered down malt profile leaves a grainy cereal sludge with minimal sweetness, just a poorly made beer. Very different experience than I had years ago before this became the official beer of the Alltech FEI World Equestrian Games. Mouthfeel is heavy with carbonation and watery in body, leaves a slight metallic note in the finihs of each sip, whta's going on. Drinkability overall, this beer is so forgettable it's really not worth another shot, let's move on to the Bourbon Ale I've never had or seen that one yet."
"I really like the looks of this beer, but the smell had a lot to be desired. I guess this is considered a pale ale, but compared to others I enjoy, this was very weak! It seemed very watered down without any bold characteristics. There was little hops noticed and I couldn't specify anything that struck me as a good pale ale. I would take a Sierra Nev anyday over this."
"Golden dark yellow in color with a firm off-white head about a finger high with some looser bubbles staying present, fades slowly to nothing, lace in fast drippings that don't stick. Aroma has a fairly nice malty sweetness with a great breadish tone of sourdough, nice and fresh with just a touch of grassy/citrusy hops. Taste is more of the same with a nice malt load, good bready sweetness of bagel dough with some nuttyness upfront and into the midway, light hops dot the finish which lingers of some sticky sweet malts and slight crispness. Good smooth medium body, clean, light creamyness ventures well as it warms, very nice drinker at that stage, sure its not as hoppy as most Pale Ales but for some reason that didn't bother me with this one. Its quite nice. Thanks to Brent for the KY sample pack of bottles!"
"Very smooth and creamy mouthfeel. I'd put the ABV somewhere around 5% which makes this an all day beer. Had it with a cheese pizza at Pazzo's and loved the combo. Very nice from the Bluegrass."
"Good color: darker than you would expect. A light amber. Good head, but it fizzles away rather quickly. Smells like wheat fields. Smells like summer. Not a very good taste. Tastes tart and weak. Not nearly enough going on here. Not a bad aftertaste or unpleasant on the palate, but nothing much on the mouth in general. No rush to have another, I just have to finish this one."
"I brought some of this back from my trip to Lexington. This golden amber colored beer pours with a white head that slowly fades to a thin film. The aroma is mostly of malt sweetness, with a bit of grassy, herbal notes. The taste is a very solid malt profile, with much more sweetness than bitterness. The finish produces a bit of a mineral taste, presumably from the limestone water the beer is brewed with. The mouthfeel is solid, and the drinkability is excellent. I had several of these my first evening in Lexington. It is a very refreshing beer, and one of the few it seems from Kentucky."
"Quite a unique tasting brew. Don't expect this to taste like any other American Pale Ale. I actually find it to be much closer to the English Pale Ale style. It pours a pale amber in the glass with a brilliant white head that shrinks to a cap. The smell is pretty muted, mostly grain and some lightly roasted malt...it even vaguely reminds me of the smell of the mash from a bourbon distillery (yes, I've toured a few). Hmm...but that would mean, among other things...corn...which doesn't translate to the taste, maybe it's the water??? The taste leans toward bready malt, in fact it has a very grainy/bready taste, but some herbal hops make an appearance and provide ample support. Mouthfeel is pleasantly creamy and light-bodied. The finish is dry with a unique mineral taste. A highly quaffable brew, worth a try for the experience but not outstanding."
"Dense rocky head. Deep amber hue showing a zesty carbonation through lines of tiny bubbles. A really nice appearance. The aroma is sweetly malty with a slight bit of hop. The flavor is of fruity, delicate malt lightly backed by hops. Light to medium in body. Not astonishingly different from a standard pale ale, but very unique in its own way which keeps me going back for more. A very drinkable beer."
"This is a very nice ale, with a good balance of hops and malt, with a slightly floral hops at the finish.  Limited distribution area, but a good ale if you can find it."
