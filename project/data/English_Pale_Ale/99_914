The aroma is mild and has just hints of the crystal malt sweetness and a little pine hops. The taste is more malt forward, with befitting its English-style, and the hops play a complimentary role. It grew on me as it warmed. The body has a nice thickness but just a little too much carbonation. This is good and with a little tweaking could be a great English Pale Ale.","delta490","Oct 27, 2014"

Now for the taste, it is smooth at first with some bitterness at this end. This brew has a nice balance to it nothing overpowering in it brew.

Aroma is strong pine, sweet malt, and a bit of biscuit. Very little citrus or florals, and mostly goes on the pine. Flavor doesn't have much sweetness, mostly pine, but balanced enough that makes this pretty easy to drink. Slightly watered down. Mediocre and not exciting, but certainly not bad.","BMMillsy","Apr 12, 2013"

No head, but a very visible, off-white colored film ring. Aroma is a light caramel malt blended with a citrus mix, and a light, oregano spiced hoppiness. Flavors range to a heavier spiced spectrum, with pepper and all spice coming through. Also a good healthy dose of citrus tang and roasted/toasted caramel. The aftertaste is spicy and tangy, all the while remaining light, with a quick, crisp, slightly dry finish. Very light and tasty beer. Great for warm weather, and just about any type of food.","GarthDanielson","Aug 02, 2011"

A bit sweet, the beer leads with malt, while a subtle hop bitterness sneaks in near the finish. The feel is medium bodied, heavier than is customary for a 5.5% pale ale.

Pours reddish amber, clear, with medium carbonation and two fingers of tan head that leaves nice lacing. Crisp aroma consists of pine, citrus, fruit and flowers, with sweet caramel malt and flavorful yeast that gives just a dash of well-integrated diacetyl. Very English-tasting, with notes of floral hops, bready/biscuity malts and fruity/earthy/nutty yeast. Also, hints of burnt sugar, citrus, resinous pine sap and a moderate, lingering bitterness. The finish lands a bit watery and I was expecting more caramel malt based on the color (adjusted with black malt perhaps?), and the body is smooth, with low carbonation and a dry, almost tannic edge to it. Not too bad of a brew here. It's approachable, easy to drink, well-hopped, and fairly priced to boot; definitely recommended.","mmmbeer","May 22, 2011"

Grassy herbal minty hops share the aroma with a much more subdued breadiness. Herbal hops with apple, nut, bread, and a hint of butter toward the finish. Medium in both body and carbonation.

Some toasted notes and light caramel sweetness. Dry nutty finish with some clean grapefruit hop oil bitterness. It lingers a touch. Medium weight with a prickly carbonation that nonetheless is quite refreshing and smother that it has a right to be. Quite drinkable and my glass is empty in short order.

Color was a deep orangish-amber with NE-quality clarity. Nose was at once slightly malty sweet, but also grassy and even with hints of tobacco. A very earthy beer, to be sure. Mouthfeel was slightly thin, but the commingling of malt and hops on the tongue was extremely pleasant. Finish tended more towards sweet than bitter, but that is part of the distinction of an English Pale Ale.

About a finger and a half of head, slightly stained yellow with fair retension supported by rising bubbles of carbonation. Decent amount of lace clings to the glassware. Somewhat fruity aroma has other scents of hoppy citrus and the malt is pretty distinct in the nose with a bit of a biscuit/grainy smell. Taste has a mild bitterness upfront with some citrus hops reminding me of mildly bitter orange rind. Moderate amount of carbonation and a light feel with this pale. As it warms, a touch of the alcohol is noticeable that helps to accent the hop bitterness. The slight bitter aftertaste is yet again reminescent of orange peel or rind. Fairly crisp and refreshing it would be a pretty decent beer as a substitute for the typical ""lawn mower"" beer but outside of that nothing really exciting.","stakem","May 09, 2010"

Taste is decent, at first it was a good balance of malts and hops but then it turned into cheap fruity flavor with a weird hop bitterness after taste, the fruit flavor takes away from the beer for me, it tastes like a cheap fruit themed beer after a while but started out good. Mouthfeel I actually enjoy on this one, not too heavy for a pale ale but a good creamyness and coating on the mouth, leaves you with the hop bitterness, good carbonation and no alcohol presence.

A light hop bitterness finished off the palate. A medium body feel, with a light fizziness goes down smooth. Saranac's Pale Ale is a staple for me. A good go-to beer, when all else fails. Good to get in a pub with a dinner, or just to sit back and drink a 6-pack of on a Sunday afternoon.

The aroma is a nice malty and hoppy aroma with hints of fruity undertones, probably citris of some sort. The taste is exellent! Really well blended malts and hops for a nice ale taste. There is a hint of citrus in the beginning and aftertaste. A nice finish to a refreshing pale ale. The beer is usually very well carbonated which makes it really nice for drinking a few of these after a long day.

A very pleasant aroma on the whole. The taste is sweet and malty as well, with some cherry flavors mixed in with apple and pear. It has a little hop kick to it in the finish too, which rounds things out nicely. The mouthfeel is a bit thin, but not too distracting. All in all, a highly quaffable ale.

1.81,-47.1,3.5,2.5,1.5,1,1.5,"Saranac's Pale Ale poured a perfect amber color. No flaws, no highlights, it was just an amber color. It had a white head of foam that was close to half an inch in height. It quickly fizzled away into some white rings along the edge of the beer and a trace of white bubbles that acted as the lace. When I first smelled this beer, the aroma was almost nonexistent with just a hint of caramel malts and Saranac's famous burnt malts. When it's slightly chilled, the aroma is a bit different. After that, then the aroma is filled with spring mountain water, caramel malts, a few slices of juicy fruits, and their famous burnt hops. When it's warm or slightly chilled, the taste is the same either way. It tastes exactly like carbonated water with traces of malted grains, caramel, and of course it wouldn't be a Saranac without it's famous burnt hops. Well, at least it didn't have any corn in it. That's the only good aspect of this beer, no corn taste. It's sad really. The mouthfeel was extremely light with an aftertaste of carbonated spring water, a few grains, and Saranac's famous burnt hops. This beer costs only $.95 a bottle and it shows it big time. If you like bottled carbonated spring water with some beer flavoring to it, then this is your session beer. For me, I wouldn't touch this stuff again unless it comes free. Is it an English Ale? No, unless all true English Ales are bland and boring. I doubt that.","AltBock","Apr 15, 2007"

There was some honey underlying the hops. It tasted similar to the scent, and my fears were realized. Pine hops, a bit o' honey, and a crisp almost bubblegum finish. Medium body.

No single smell dominates its mildly spicy, fruity and malty aroma, but there's a slightly acidic smell which reminds me of tomatoes, oddly enough. The flavor is pleasant though unremarkable and is mostly more of the same, if a bit more malty than the smell, with a pretty mild hops finish that's still lingering on my tongue twenty minutes after I finished the bottle. Great for drinking slowly and very pleasant to relax with, it doesn't really stand out, but it's soothing and goes down easy.

I'm more inclined to agree with BA, as I think the hops prevail over the malt--which in my opinion is the big difference b/w an English and American Pale Ale. Sure, Saranac may use traditional English hops (at least that's what the bottle says), but in this case, I think the quantity used is more important than what variety is used. The dominant hop taste slides this one over to APA territory, I think.","Kendo","Sep 01, 2006"

I'm inclined to got with the bottle. The predominant flavor is malty and, other than a crisp finish, there is no strong hops flavor here. Pours a clear amber with a small head. The head hangs in there and the lacing is strong. Noticeable malty aroma at first. The taste was surprisingly strong, crisp and pronounced malt flavor with some bitterness as well. Mouthfeel is a hair thin, but the overall effect was that I could drink several of these at a session.

Hops seem a bit oxidized and mild flavored. Obviously an English Pale Ale with the hops and malt profile. Almost papery and copper-like in the body.

Taste is totally quaffable; flavors of malts and hops, citrus, cereal grains, oily hops and some traces of caramel. Nice, especially considering this is a ""mass made micro", as some would call it.

The aroma seems to be the weak point; there is a malty sweetness and, if you swirl it, a nice hoppiness comes out. The taste is delivered on the broad shoulders of a very nice malt base. Slightly sweet with a background fruitiness. A nice grassiness and florally hop element comes quickly and stays the whole time. It finishes crisp and slightly bitter.

If it weren't for this beer I might not be sitting here writing this review, I could be off pounding a 40. We used to always get this stuff in the summer and in high school. Relatively cheap but even they we knew that this stuff was better than Bud. But enough nostalgia... Looks pretty typical for an APA, a nice orangy amber color with a little foamy head that dissipates quickly, but it's a little bubbly and a little thin looking. Smells rather hoppy with a nice backbone but nothing really jumps out at you. Taste does have a decent hop taste and a malty profile, but there's weird other tastes in there that aren't really supposed to be there. Little bitter, metalic, dusty tastes. I'm sure I've used the terms bitter and dusty (not metalic) in a positive way before when reviewing beer but this is different. Mouthfeel isn't bad but it's a little thin and watered down. All that being said I find this beer to be pretty drinkable anyway, for whatever reason. Like I said, this ain't no ""heady brew"" or whatever you might want to say but it is respobsible for heading a lot of people down the trail that leads to ""better beer.""

Surprisingly, malts dominate the nose and initial mouthfeel. This one is much better crafted than Saranac's IPA. The absence of the floral Cascade hops is noticeable, but their English cousins fill in admirably to produce a lighter profile. I can detect hints of hazelnut and raisins in the taste, on top of the hops and malts. This becomes a very drinkable pale ale as the flavours improve at room temperature.

I was hit with the aroma of hops on first smell, along with a crisp citrus rind smell and a touch of yeast. The mouthfeel is light and slightly carbonated, and quite pleasant to have in ones mouth. The flavor is at first a smooth malt, but it quickly builds to a mild bitter marked by hops, and the citrus rind lingers through. THere is also a very slight hint of burnt earthiness. The sip leaves a interestingly dry feeling in the mouth, and as I usually like, left a desire to drink more. Quite a good ale.","FranklinPCombs","Jun 27, 2003"

The bitterness was almost chewable. In general, fairly tasty with a decent malt body. Had a crisp and quick finish, with very little linger  mostly simple hops and bitter cream.

The nose is perfumey (but without any distinct hops) with some caramel malt and a touch of sweet tobbacco. The body is medium and a very fine/moderate carbonation leaves it just slightly crisp on the tongue. The flavor displays a solid caramel-laced malt that's well infused with floral and gently spicy hops. The signature Matt's yeast plays a big role here, and it finishes dry with a lingering bitterness, but also somewhat soapy. Firm bitterness; decent balance; nicely rounded. Overall, it's a pretty solid offering - especially considering it's full maltiness - although the hops may let you down.","NeroFiddled","Mar 29, 2003"

A dry, malty beer that is just a tad more aggressively hopped than most British beers but otherwise is a dead ringer. Some butter flavors, bread crust, lots of caramel (trademark Saranac flavor if you ask me) with some spiciness derived from the yeast. A dry finish with some puckering on the tongue is chief evidence of hops; a bit of citric flavor in taste, and lots of hops in the aroma. This is a solid, underappreciated beer and if you're stuck on what to buy for yourself or your friends, this will not disappoint.","Thrasher","Mar 29, 2003"

You could say it needs more malt or more hops, but as it is, it is finely balanced. This is a nice middle of the road pale ale, walking the line between American and English.

The amber copper tone it pours with a decent off white head leaving haphazard tracks off lace down the glass nothing uniform in the appearance. The bottle says a bouquet of hop aroma, but I am going to guess and say my flowers have wilted. No but seriously the hop aroma is there and semipleasan only it is so faint. The taste is smooth and refreshing, but the bitterness is not really that bitter for a pale ale. This beer is also lacking any kind of a balance in the wannabe hop flavor nothing is here to offset it. I better quit drinking Saranac losing respect fast. I like the way it feels like it expands to feel fluffy in the mouth and the hops spread across the tongue reaching the back of it as I swallow allowing the optimal bitterness to reach my palate. Th overall drinkability is so so, but nothing here is realing me in. I am just not sold on this one, and that's about it.","WVbeergeek","Feb 04, 2003"

The smell was deep and rich with heavy notes of coffee, smoked wood, malts and some quality hops. The taste was rich and creamy with toasted malts and burnt flavors and just a little fresh goldings hops taste. This taste coupled with the fact that a 12 pack costs under 10 dollars makes the Saranac Pale a great choice. I would also recomend that the Saranac Pale and the Sierra Nevada be one that you slowly ween your more ignorant friends away from the macro swill, before they get the full blown beer revolution from some of the Victories and Rogues.","GreatPondBrewer","Feb 03, 2003"

A thick foamy head was present, but dissipated pretty quickly once a couple of drinks were taken. During consumption, head residue remained on the sides of the glass adding to taste of each drink. The taste was fairly balanced, no overpowering bitter or sweet taste, and went down very well. I didnt experience any overpowering aftertaste and I found myself looking forward to the next drink.

The hops really assert themsleves in the taste, and the malt makes a late appearance in the aftertaste. A pretty good taste overall. I'm usually a fan of hoppy beers, but for this review, the hops were perhaps just a little too assertive for me. The medium body and smooth tingle gave this beer a rather pleasant mouthfeel.

An initial, mildly bitter taste leads to tangy notes of citrus, mostly grapefruit, with a dry bitterness remaining at the finish.

The finish is a little fruity, with a hint of pears followed by a lingering hop bitterness. The hops are not assertive in this brew, but they are present in every aspect of the beer. The mouthfeel is adequate, but not a full as a true english pale. The carbonation is not as heavy as many of the Saranac brews either, which is a good thing.

3.75,9.6,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a nice pale copper color with a nice creamy head that shows good retention.  Smell is of strong malt and some subtle hops.  The malt presence is the first to arrive on the tongue and is soon followed up by some nice citrusy hops.  Very crisp and clean mouthfeel, almost no aftertaste whatsoever.  This is a very drinkable beer.  I really liked this beer.  It is a little bit off for the style but I still thought it was very good.  It is a little to hoppy for an english pale ale but it is a little to malty for an american pale ale.  Like I said I really liked this.  I would definitely recommend it to any Pale Ale fan.","Murph","Apr 11, 2002"
4,17,4,4,4,4,4,"Copper amber color with a decent head. The aroma is sweet, malty, floral, fruity and a hint of hops. Rich and fruity flavor with just the right amount of malt and hops.  Creamy, crisp medium body. Finishes slighty dry.","ThreePistols","Apr 09, 2002"
4.2,22.8,4,4,4.5,4,4,"I drink a lot of this since the closest liquor store to my house has been selling it for the past couple of years for $4.99 a six.  It's got a nice hoppiness to it, but is definitely an English-style pale ale.  Very flavorful.","jermar","Mar 15, 2002"

3.8,11.1,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Amber, nice tight head.  Fairly reserved, quick complex hop taste that retains nicely. English hop taste dominates, limiting any fresh fruit or chewy mid-mouth tastes.  Respectably brewed.","ADR","Mar 01, 2002"
4.22,23.4,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"A very pleasant ale with an interesting aroma - first a quick hit of sweet malt in the nose, then a whiff of hops, and then to a sweet candy aroma.  Malt was somewhat sweet, but not overly so, with a good balance of hops.  Slight spicyness of alcohol slides in at the back.  Very easygoing without being boring.","Brent","Feb 21, 2002"
3.75,9.6,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a nice pale copper color, with a some-what creamy off-white colored head with decent retention. The body is slightly thin. On the nose the aroma was hoppy, floral, fruity and citrusy notes. On the palate more hoppy citrus flavor, some fruit flavors, and a nice bitterness. I good pale ale for the price.","WilliamPhilaPa","Feb 17, 2002"
4.2,22.8,4,4,4,4,5,"Exceptional pale ale from a mainstream brewer. This ale stands up to many craft brewed examples. Rich, fruity body with a  cascade like hop finish. I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of this beer.","QXSTER1","Jan 08, 2002"
3.06,-10.5,4,3,3,3,3,"I was expecting this to be hoppier but it wasnt bad. Not my favourite pale ale but it was ok. It's a good pizza beer.","xXTequila","Dec 17, 2001"
4,17,4,4,4,4,4,"Very nice hop kick.  This beer has improved within the past few years and now is extremely drinkable.  No more lacking in body or flavor.","AaronRed","Nov 25, 2001"
4,17,4,4,4,4,4,"Nice hop characteristics, balance to this beer.  Great when fresh, but quality diminishes relatively quickly and you don't know when it's fresh because there are no dates.","pbrian","Oct 18, 2001"
3.9,14,4,4,4,3,4,"A good pale and pretty cheap. $4.99 a six and 5 buck pitcher specials are easily had. Full flavored and nicely hopped w/Goldings.","John","Oct 15, 2001"
3.74,9.4,3,4,3.5,4,4,"Notes: A very worthy English-style Pale Ale, but in some respects it tastes a bit like a West Coast Pale Ale. No matter, it's still a very tasty brew!","Todd","Jul 07, 2001"
