Soft noble hops and a toffee/butterscotch like note. Finishes with a leafy hoppyness and a slight tang. Light to medium bodied feel with an oily hop and sweet yeast. Overall, a mild, session able ale with a very English character.","Stinkypuss","Nov 15, 2012"

The appearance poured with a nice clear copper color. Little to no head and lace with this bottle. The smell had nice hop aroma, but the other components of beer are missing.

You really need to struggle to get much of any aroma. Tastes sweet with a touch of caramel like goodness. Nothing that really stands out. Mouthfeel just okay.

Taste is of light sweet grains and grassy / spicy hops - also some lemon zest in the hop profile... well balanced. This one has a little butteriness to it, as well.

There is nothing really noteable about the smell, light malt. Feels good on my tongue, just the right amount of tickle from the carbonation. Taste has just a hint of hops.

The taste holds notes of everything above, along with a weak hoppy bitterness and some grass. The body is light, with moderate carbonation and a dry finish.

Appears a very light orange color that is strikingly clear with a lively amount of carbonation rising through the liquid in support of the white head atop the brew. Initially the head was more than 2 fingers strong but it receeded to just a thin coating atop and lacing sticks in plenty of patches about the glass. Aroma has herbal hops, faint grainy malt and a slight mineral touch in the backend. The most prominent aspect of the aroma is the herbal hops that have a twing of citrus aspect about them as the beer warms. Taste has a combination upfront of herbal and citrus hops. The citrus aspect is a little more evident than indicated in the aroma. The malt presents itself with a biscuity flavor across a thin body before finishing quite crisp with the herbal, slightly citrus hops lingering in the mouth. The alcohol is mildly evident in both flavor and warming factor. Overall it is a decent pale. Quite light and refreshing it would be easy to throw a few of these back.","stakem","Jun 08, 2010"

The hops take a back seat to a stronger malt flavor. Some carmel and mild hop bitterness but not much. Pretty light and refreshing.

A nice clear body with a golden orange hue. Carbonation was normal. This aroma stood out by the dominance of the yeast over the hops, unusually for Pale Ales. I got hints of dough and banana. The palate was incredible, a nice medium to full body that was creamy in texture, soft carbonation, and a finish that screamed bread (my favorite).

The smell is malty, dry grass, some citrus, a wet grainy aroma overall. The taste is clearly dry, not much sweetness to this beer at all, which makes this much more a British pale than a characteristically fruity Pacific NW style pale. The dryness is what is most pronounced here. There is a grainy, somewhat sharp, slight tartness in the middle, that rounds out nicely in the finish.

I must say the hop flavors seem out of place for some reason...they come across as strong but a bit out of whack with the malt somehow. The yeast seems to be adding little to no character that I can tell. mouthfeel is full and on par, overall this is a likable beer, one I'd grab on tap, but not one I'll stock or buy again.

This is a drinkable ale worth having during a session. Overall, I was pleased with this. Not knowing what to expect, I can say I was suprised and not disappointed.","beeragent","Jun 08, 2007"

The body, in fact, makes this a sessionable beer if the taste was your thing. I'm fully aware that as an English style pale (I know BA feels otherwise) this should not taste like a typical hoppy American pale ale.

The taste has a slight sweet start then breaks to a hop presence that seems to give it a earthy tone. The flavor also seems to break to a slight metallic flavor that does not mix well IMO.

Smells like an English pale, not an American ... malt dominates the taste as well, with the hops only appearing as an aferthougth in the over all taste profile. Moderately sweet and medium-bodied. A pretty good English style pale ale, which is not among my favorite styles, but an enjoyable beer none the less.","beerphilosopher","Feb 09, 2006"

I would prefer the sweetness to be toned down in this one in favor of some more bitterness. The mouthfeel is a decent thickness and carbonation.

This is what I like about the English style pales. It's malty with a smooth, dry finish. The hops add good balance and it attains a slight fruitiness. The mouthfeel is fine.

Anyway, the color of the beer is amber with a large, semi-creamy head. Smell is fairly hoppy, but has a generic quality to it. Flavor is sweeter than I thought it would be and less hoppy. Usually the APAs I've had have more bite in the hops department. The sweetness is a little too strong, but is only bothersome in the finish. The middle of the sip is well-rounded, but not complex and full enough for me. Still, this isn't too bad of a beer, just something seems a little off here.

Very mild hops bite on the tongue. Taste is of a well balanced, British style, pale ale, similar to Bass. A sweet malt backbone is balanced by a subdued, but pleasant, hops presence. Don't expect an American style, IPA here. This is nowhere close to a hoppy, SNPA, but compares favorably to a Bass Pale Ale. Finish is clean, and slightly dry. Drinkability is very good.

I felt the taste was very thin. The little taste that was there was sort of flowery and grassy. There just wasn't a lot going on with this brew.

Fairly balanced between malt and hops, but hops stick around much longer in aftertaste. Run of the mill pale ale, from a brewer that can do much better. On the other hand, my opinion of this beer has improved since its introduction, when I thought it was more of a weak golden ale. Has it been reformulated?","RonfromJersey","Jun 14, 2002"
3.85,11,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"The bottle says American, but the taste says English. This is a good beer in the style of those that you'd sit around and drink in the pub with your friends without thinking too much about the beer you're drinking. Amber colored, nice white fluffy head. Mild floral hop aromas (Kent Goldings), with a slight caramal malt presence. Taste is relatively tame for a pale ale, with quite mild hop flavors balanced by an unobtrusive maltiness. Finish is smooth and refreshing, if not entirely memorable. Again, a good beer to drink with friends if you really don't want to be thinking about the beer you're drinking.","mophie","Jun 11, 2002"

3.06,-11.8,4,3,3,3,3,"Okay, another confessional.  I am still trying to sample other Samuel Adams, but for the pale ale, my local brews outshine it.  Has a nice color and smell, but the taste is nothing that really moves or surprises me.  If is of course better than the macros but still far removed from my local pales.  I realize this is at a local, so maybe if I check out a tap version to what I am comparing it to it may do better.","Wildman","May 30, 2002"

Slight cardboard (oxidation?) taste.in the finish.  The brew lacks real character next to the other high power PA's.","frank4sail","May 02, 2002"

4,15.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Full flavoured pale ale leaning towards English style, good balance to make for a beer that one could sit down and have a few and not be overwhelmed in any aspect. An all around good pale ale and a decent stab at the English style.","Jason","Apr 10, 2002"
3.22,-7.2,3,3.5,3,3,3.5,"Golden in color w/ a slight haze.  The head is thin and unimpressive. Quintessential floral Kent Goldings notes dominate the hop nose, and the earthy Fuggles note is secondary.  Malt aroma is minimal.  It's quite similar to their Boston Ale in aroma profile having a slight butterscotch note, but is more mild comparatively.  Decent toasty malt flavors are present, but this brew is a bit lacking in malt character overall.  Hop bitterness is moderate and clean, with the characteristically earthy Fuggles flavor dominating.  It finishes clean but unexciting.  I wasn't left longing for another.  Although a decent beer, the lack of malt complexity deterred from its potential.  A British base malt such as Maris Otter would've been a better malt foundation.","marc77","Apr 09, 2002"
3.85,11,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Nice and well-carbonated pour, clear pale yellow body. Fizzy refreshing mouth feel, pretty full and foamy with a more than adequate carbonation. There’s a lack of hop bite, nice sweetness, but still enjoyable. Very nice finish that is slightly dry, smooth with a nice crispness. Overall pretty good stuff.","WilliamPhilaPa","Apr 01, 2002"

3.23,-6.9,3.5,3,3,3,4,"Hops are floral and spicy (and a tad metallic), not fruity.  Average finish.  Reminds me of Bass.  The Boston Lager tastes more like an American Pale than this brew.  Average mouthfeel and not a distinct finish.","ADR","Feb 27, 2002"
