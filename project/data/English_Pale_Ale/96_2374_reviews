"Serving type: bottle"
"Yellow ale, light carbonation.  Not a pleasant aftertaste.  More bitter than expected from an ale.  Won't be buying again."

"When the bite calms from a heavy start, a good crispness remains consistent and it really smooths out.  Soft carbonation makes it creamy, and the bite comes back at the end of each sip."
"Grainy Pilsner malt light apple light floral spicy hop."

"Single Chair Ale brewed by Magic Hat Brewing Company, with an ABV of 5.0%  This brew pours out a nice golden amber color with a nice thick white head.  The smell is rich with grains and malts. There is also a hit of sweetness in the smell of this brew.  The taste is rich with flavor.  You pick up on the sweetness at the end of this brew.  The mouthfeel is rich, smooth and refreshing. I like how this brew goes down smooth, with no bad aftertaste. Single Chair Ale has a nice balance to it, there is nothing overpowering in this brew. Magic Hat Brewing Company did a nice job with this brew.  Overall I'm giving Single Chair Ale 4.5  out 5. I would buy this brew again."

"Very disappointing. I feel that this beer has potential but it needs a lot of work. For starters its very watered down and lacks flavor"

"Taste-Pale malt, a bit flat and lifeless to be honest. kind of a bummer."
""
"Ordered this at the casino. Very watery with no perceptible taste until a sharp bite finish. Not very interesting but drinkable."
"Terrible, very first time I've completely disliked a Magic Hat beer, of any variety. It's bland and light, and honestly I'd prefer a budweiser or PBR if this was the kind of taste I wanted to drink because honestly those are better than this beer."
""
"It's a good beer but over carbonated."

"Magic Hat has charmed me in many ways, and if they make a plain beer, well that's fine. I enjoy plain beer too."

"Tasted from a 12 ounce bottle on February 15, 2015."
""
""
"The taste is decent with gentle malt flavor with a somewhat yeast oriented flavor with a mild tanginess and bready quality combined with the light grain flavor. There is not much else going on -I am surprised it is 5%, it is pretty drinkable in general, but as far as flavor it is not much better than average. I might try pairing this with some spicy chili or wings, but it misses the mark unless you want a palate cleanser."

"Quality golden ale, but definitely nothing too special in terms of taste. Preferably drank under 40 degrees. Very drinkable and smooth. I am glad that Magic Hat continues to mix it up"
"Very mildly flavored, almost boring. Highly carbonated,refreshing, and very sessionable at 5%."
"Like the aroma, the taste is taken over by this butter, vegetable oil greasiness that buries the toasted biscuit and bread character one might expect. It ends reasonably clean and crisp."
"Laps pals laps laps laps laps"

"A very bland ale with a muted skunky taste. Why does everything from Magic Hat have a skunkiness to them? Are they trying to be like the mass-produced beers of Canada? It's a brown bottle there should be no skunkiness."
""
""
"Overall, the more I drink this the less I like it. It starts out very bread and doesn't hold up, leaving it tasting more like a thin adjunct lager in the finish."
""
"This beer reminds me of our typical American lager from the big 3. It isn't horrible, but for those looking to expand their palate,  this may not be the one for you. Don't get me wrong it doesn't taste bad, but I think I am past these types of beers. It has a slight fruity tone, no particular after taste. But for sure it lands right in the middle of the road."
""
""
""
"Overall:  Not a bad beer.  I would place it's flavor profile close to moosehead, only better."

"O:Got this beer as a gift from my friend in a growler frim a festival in vermin and the magic hat brewery. Was sure what to expect but turned out to be a very enjoyable ale that I could drink anyday. Goes down smoothly but at the same time has great flavor."

"I poured this beer into a glass, it has a golden color body with a small fizzy head. tyey The aroma has a grain smell to it. The taste is kinda dry and has a little malt and hop flavor. The mouthfeel is ok and overall it is ok nothing special."

"somewhat less than a pale ale in my opinion. pours almost clear beach sand color with a one inch white head that dies out after a couple minutes. the small is qute malty, but on the lighter end of the spectrum. no hops to really speak of aromatically. flavor is a bit more balanced than the nose. this is just an easy drinking session beer, with nothing to really set it apart. the hops only present themselves in the finish, which is mildly bitter. feel is fine, lighter in body and well carbonated. i tend to like my pale ales with a little more going on, fuller body, more hops etc., but if you want a nice cruisy drinking pale ale, this could be your beer."

"just noticed I really had to dig for those flavors. A certain grainy macro beer flavor is present as well and takes away from the subtle notes that are difficult to find anyway. not a huge fan."

"O: Goes down ok, somewhat tasty, not filling, mild kick, not a great representation of style. This would be a good alternative to BMC, but not something I would seek out."

"Doesn't really impress greatly but it's a fine ale for a simple style."
"Overall: Not over-the-top, out-of-this world awesome, but hey...it's a good beer."
"Magic Hat just isn't that good."
"Mouthfeel is light and crisp with light carbonation, a light body and a dry grainy finish that's almost tart. Not sure I really like this as it seems like it was too healthy or earthy for me. Another strange Magic Hat beer."
"Overall, while this is still far better fare than, say, a Bud, the beer lacks any distinctive characteristics, and also lacks diversity in its flavor profile. A few more sugars and fruit esters would have helped here, or at least another handful of hops."
"Overall I like this ""Golden Beer"". It's not super memorable, but is an easy drinker with enough flavors to keep you satisfied."
"Excellent summer beer. Refreshing without sacrificing taste. I wouldn't mind having another one of these. Well done MH"
"Taste is quite tart, was not expecting that at all. Lemony and grainy with a mild floral hoppiness. Lots of carbonation, little bit of zest here and there. All in all, this beer is unremarkable. Glad I only got a single of this, and as an APA (as classified here) a pretty big disappointment."
"Picked up a single at Trader Joe's. Poured from the bottle into a standard pint glass. Golden yellow color. Small white head, but it fades away quickly. Decent carbonation. Smell was grassy and musty. Taste was adequate, with enough hops at the very end to give this beer a slight kick of flavor. Decent amount of malt lends the beer a fairly good base. The beer really doesn't stand out either way. Not bad, nothing great. Not worth putting down money for a six pack. There are better tasting APAs out there."
"A good pale ale with nice fruit flavors. Kind of reminds me of #9, doubt they meant that though."
"It's not wowing me, but I am enjoying it on this hot July day. An easy drinking, pleasant beer."
"12 oz bottle in Turner, ME. A is a cloudy with a skinny half finger head. S is extremely light and bitter. T is biscuity and thin. Lacking teeth or any memorable flavor. M is ok but very watery feeling. O it leaves a lot to be desired. Decent for hot summer days and has a nice label. Missed me on this one."
"overall: easy to drink with a little bit more character than a typical summer beer and definitely a step or two above a typical adjunct beer."
"O: Not a bad pale. Plenty refreshing. Put a bottle in my hand and I'll drink it, but I can't see myself buying one."
"Not too bad, easy to drink with a no frills attitude. If you are looking for something with a bit more oomph then this might not be your beer."
"O) An alright beer. Not necessarily a stand out. I'd consider have another one."
"Pours light golden with some haze. Minimal foam settles out. Empty smell, getting nothing. Light malt taste with mild hop throughout. Orange in there. Pepper. Kind of a rind taste in there. Citrussy bittering. If nothing else, magic hat delivers another beer with a unique flavor profile and finish."
"O: This is a very nice summer beer that is very easy to drink and is very refreshing as well. Don't expect an explosion of aroma or flavor, but definitely don't expect a shitty watered-down APA either"
"Very unimpressed with this one. Never been a big MH fan, and I never have any sort of expectations for their beers, but this is truly a new low."
"Drinkability - Flavorless beer with an annoying after taste, would not try another one."
"Overall, this one just didn't do it for me. Maybe I got a bad bottle, but this beer seems like it wasn't ready for bottling or consumption."
"Brought a growler home from Vermont after visiting the brewery. The beer poured out as a clear golden color with a good looking white head on top. The smell of this beer is almost a splitting images of #9 without the apricot. The same goes for the taste... remove the apricot flavor and you have Single Chair. I found it to be interesting that they were nearly the same brew in my opinion. I like #9 and I found Single Chair to be good also. This was nice to have back at home because it's one of their brews that isn't distributed. Overall, enjoyable refreshing brew"
"D: This was more like a witbier or blonde ale than an APA. The bottle claims it's a """golden ale.""" Either way, it wasn't very good. Not very clean or crisp, lacking refinement and body. Easy to drink (or chug), but not worth trying otherwise."
"Medium body, higher carbonation, dry and a bit rough. Not bad, not great, but pretty drinkable during the summer weather."
"A drinkable beer on a hot summer day, but still a disappointment. I remember hearing about this beer many years ago when it was a very limited release and I was hoping for more."
"overall, just not much taste. good for a hot day, but that's about it."
"O: This brew really misses the mark for an APA. It really isn't a bad beer just mislabeled in my opinion."
"O: Decent enough beer. Lagery. Not my thing. Wouldn't have again."
"This is not one of the better pale ales I have had. That sour flavor just ruined it for me."
"I like how the dryness from the hops the sweet grainy malt taste and yeast taste perfectly combine together for a really good tasting lighter beer. This is a fantastic ""lawnmower beer"" and has all the right qualities of a session beer. Actually one of the tastiest well rounded lighter beers I've had. This is like Magic Hat's twist on an American Adjunct yet it has no adjuncts and has a better yeast, hop and malt taste over one any day."
"Grabbed this out of a friends mix pack. A hazy yellow with a large amount of carbonation. No head only some puddles of bubbles. The nose is faintly grassy and wheat. Smells close to an adjunct beer. Flavor is crisp and tart upfront with some light malt notes. A lingering bitterness that is unpleasant."
"I enjoy this brew for being exceptionally easy-drinking; it is damn-near a stand-in for water."
"overall, not really sure what to take from this beer. definatly wasnt brewed to be a pale ale, so im not really rating it as one. more of a blond/ golden ale. not something i would really buy again, but an easy drinker, that any beer drinker could enjoy."
"Overall: Certainly an interesting and unique beer and a great summer seasonal. Once again, I'm confused by the APA label but what do I know? Regardless, this is definitely one of Magic Hat's better offerings and certainly worth a shot."
"O: This is a big departure from Magic Hat's other beers in every way. I would definately not buy this beer again, since it tastes way too much like Bud, which I do not like under any circumstances. Luckily most other Magic Hat Brewing Company's offerings are very good. This one just is not one of them."
"O - I would call this an average brew. Nothing that would make me really search it out or drink it again. For less money, I would just buy some Bud. Nothing particularly craft worthy about this one."
"Tastes like it smells. Simple grains, but full flavor and crisp clean body. Overall, this is a pretty good quaff."
"Not my favorite beer from magic hat but it has a good clean taste. I am used to a more unusal flavors in a magic hat and this has a very standard flavor for a brew from them. It is a well rounded brew and has good flavors I just usualy get magic hat to have some intersting flavor combinations and I feel this beer let's me down on that front."
"PRETTY GOOD, COULD DO WORSE!"
" Look, smell and feel, bares resemblance to some mass produced American beers, but the taste character is more complex"
"The mouthfeel is a bit thicker than normal for the style, and highly carbonated. It's still nice though. The drinkability is great. This reminds me a lot of #9 minus the apricots. I'd take #9 over this any day, but it still a pretty good brew."
"O- i wont be drinking this again. it reminds me more of a macro lager than a pale ale. i didnt know what it was going into it, and im shocked about the classification. avoid."
"Just got done gutting the grass and twisted a couple of Single Chairs into my 500ml glass. The color is golden clear with nice head which laces well. The lemony aroma is pleasent. The taste favors lemon citrus....could be considered closer to a golden ale. The mouthfeel is great and was a good drink for after laboreous effort. Definitely worth a try."
"it is refreshing though. nicely carbonated."
"Pours a bright clear straw, decent foam forms and recedes to nothing and no lace. Aroma of grain, wheat, cat pee, hop pellets and alittle citrus. In the flavor, biscuity malt, herbal tea like hops and a more or less clean finish. Alittle lemony, alittle tart. Kind of an odd ball beer, and average at best for an American pale ale. Closer to an American blonde in style."
"I don't know anything about Mad River Glen, which the label says Single Chair celebrates (a ski resort, I presume?), but I can't help but imagine it deserves better celebration than this beer. It's not bad really, just one of those Magic Hat beers I feel very ""ho hum"" about. It happens. Next."
"Decent tasting, though not terribly complex. I'd have it again, but I don't find it memorable enough to want to search it out."
"Overall, I'd happily drink this all summer long."
"This APA is typical, but has an exceptional filtering to it! Not so great for the beer snobs, but very good for the local pub and colege students. The only reason I rated the 3.5 was for it's ability to sell. This could be a popular beer with the right publicity. The smell however is almost as standard as a chevy. My first mouthful was quite pleasing, and would pair well with sourdough pretzels (no joke). I hope that no one was offended. It's just my opinion."
"Pale golden color with a slight haze to it, egg shell white head forms nicely leaves fine speckled lacing behind. Aroma has a bit herbal hops, biscuit malts with a hint of rust/metallic edge, something earthy similar to the wacko beet infused beers aroma. Flavor wise it's a clean biscuit malt profile hints of herbal/earthy hops with a fruit malt driven light golden ale, pretty unoffensive at it's core. A beer I've never tried from Magic Hat and I've been trying their offerings since the early 2000s. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied sturdy carbonation somewhat creamy texture to it especially for a straight forward golden ale. Overall a decent easy going drinking beer that should be looked at for pure simplicity of the flavor. When you have had too many Double, Imperial offerings and you're ready for something you can have a couple of then grab something like this come summer."
"Overall this is a nice refreshing beer from Magic Hat."
"A slightly-hazy gold in color. Stark white head is decent in size but caps to a film. Lace is ok. The aroma is a bit wheaty up front, nothing strong. Taste starts semi sweet with a touch of honey, finishes earthier with notes of hay and basic malt. Citrus? - Maybe, but not noticeable enough to me. Mouthfeel feels crisp at first but finishes smooth. Drinkability is fine, but I didn't want another only due to the ho-hum flavor. I could see others liking this as go-to session brew, but I'll probably look elsewhere in the future for my pale ales."
"D - Extremely drinkable. Also a bit more flavor than I was expecting overall, it is still a little on the light side, but there was enough flavor there. Really refreshing beer."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not filling at all, mild kick, decent representation of style, it's not the best beer overall, but it's very poundable and beats the typical swill beers."
"This beer is a light golden color with a foamy white head that lingers on the glass. Its taste is smooth and not too hoppy. It's the kind of beer that would be excellent to drink on a nice summer evening at a barbecue."
"Much lighter than other APAs, it forgoes hop dominance in favor of a much more drinkable beer that doesn't line up with this style. Magic Hat calls it a ""Golden Ale", which seems to be better aligned with its style."
"Single Chair pours a basic pale golden color with some light orange within, a loose head died into a cap that stayed, but left no lace. This smells like, nothing, i mean, i really get nothing. Some pale sweet malt and that's about it. I can't smell what's not there. Let's make that for the taste as well, a really bland tasting pale that's bordering on adjunct with a semi rice thing going after time. No citrus at all, nothing, Im not joking. No really. This tastes like all of MH's other light offerings, I guess it's the yeast, well their yeast strain sucks. The feel is light bodied and carbed pretty well with a slight crisp on the tounge so it's got that going for it. The drinkability suffers because this is not good, but i drank it, because i paid for it. I wish I got a bottle of this, it would of been the same thing with less carb. Add this to the list of Magic Hat beers that are blah."
"D: Due to the light body and lack of any strong flavors I could see this being a decent beach or BBQ beer. Other than that I will probally never try this beer again."
"I received a kegerator as a gift. On a whim, not having had this beer, I decided to get a sixtel. Nice choice (lucky gamble?) This beer would appeal to both craft and macro drinkers as it is light, subtle and drinkable. Has characteristics of a typical macro lager (though I know it is not) with a ginger-y spiciness. Interesting - and certainly an ""easy session"" brew."
"Drinkability: I would have this again on a hot summer day and could make a decent session beer."
"I thought this was a summer ale when I got it and as that I thought it was light. This is not a pale ale. Very light in color, smell is not hoppy at all, taste is like an american lager and overall it does not have much character at all. I like this brewery and, even though I don't like all their beers, i like that they're different. This one doesnt' do it though."
"Just returned from big z beverage in Huntington. Bought a growler of this magic hat single. Was described as ""#9 w/o apricot"". Immediately upon opening I got the whiff of a budweiser-esqe beer. Beer pours a nice golden color and retains nothing but a millimeter or so of head. No lacing. Boring type flavor. Think budweiser but a little better. I guess I was expecting more out of magic hat. Malty and a slight hop finish. You really have to look for it. Overall not impressed. Drinkability however is excellent on a hot day."
"I have to admit that I didn't like this beer when I had it at the brewery a few months ago. However, it really is underrated. I could drink pints of this because the low ABV makes it easier to enjoy."
"Heres to a beer that has some nostalgia when it comes to Magic Hat."
"Drinkability - A very nice and simple ale. Definitely pleasant and food friendly. something very straight forward from magic hat."
"Off the tap at the brewery this beer was a pale yellow with a thin white head. Weak lacing or retention. The aromas were fairly standard, doughy, bready malt and some citric hops providing a nice balance. The flavors were similar, bready malt, some crisp wheat followed immediately by the floral hops and citrus hops. Again, nice balance. The mouthfeel however was watery and the carbonation being light did not help. It's a good smelling and tasting brew with a typical Magic Hat floral-ness but it's a little light in my opinion."
"Golden blonde ale,poured in glass and left a good frothy head. This is a light tasting beer, the dry hopped process takes away the flowery taste, making it a very drinkable brew, Light lacing remains throughout the pint. I did notice a bitter aftertaste, which I felt took away from the dry hopped lack of citrusy/flowery flavours."
"D - Goes down quite easily - not a good thing for this selection. Weak from start to finish."
"On tap at the place it was made for, Mad River Glen. Very pale and very cloudy pour. Intereting. Not too much in the smell I can remember, but it was probably crisp and kind of sweet. Taste had that and more. Apparently the recipe changes every year - This was the first one I've had, so I don't have others for comparison, but I'd swear they used some kind of fruit this time. It screamed of raspberries. The raspberries were right up front, tart and sweet, followed by an extremely crisp and corny aftertaste. It was so corny that I would have thought it a lager if I was not informed prior. But not that twangy harsh corniness of a lager - the good kind. Decent amount of carbonation. Smooth and easy to drink. A nice way to end a day on the slopes."
"One of Magic Hat's better brews and is similar to #9, Hocus Pocus or Circus Boy in that it has a strong floral scent and taste to the beer. Decently hopped, but not over done and not overwhelmingly bitter."
"Overall a servicable ale. Nothing too exciting, but certainly an easy drinker."
"the single chair is light in color with little laceing not to hoppy in flavor, mabey could use a liitle more, but overall very drinkable and smooth finishing. ome fruity undertones, not what youd expect from a pale style ale. but overall very good would drink lots of"
"Not a big fan of Magic Hat, but the name of the beer intrigued me, and it's not a bad beer. An orange color with a small head. It had a floral aroma, with some fruit (?pear) detectable. It had a sweet taste, nicely hopped. Fairly assertive. I would drink this beer again."
"A beer named after the legendary single chair at Mad River Glen deserves a legendary taste. This is a decent beer that goes down smooth but I was expecting the holy grail of beers. Pours clear with a golden color and a decent head for an APA. A bit on the bitter side with kickin' hops although not as overhopped as your typical APA which is a good thing. It is a very quaffable beer that I could drink all night. Still, for me it doesn't quite live up to some of MH's other fine brews such as the sadly unavailable heart of darkness"
"Bought this at the brewery in Burlington. This pours a clear yellow straw with a large 2 finger white foamy head. The smell is hoppy with some earthy floral scents, it's not all that strong. The taste is citrus hoppy with some slight malt sweetness that's very refreshing and good. The m/f is light,but the aftertaste is abit watery. This is a good brew that I can see having a few pints tailgating or at home watching football."
"Drinkability...nothing knocking my socks off here. Seems pretty average."
"Pours a pale pale pale amber with a big bright white headskie. Tastes good, but mild. The hops are very much there, yet the malt balance keeps this ale in check. Mouthfeel is ok, quite the drinkable beer. Single Chair is much better on draft though. Bring on the Mad River mountain!"
"Half-gallon growler straight from the brewery. Poured out a clear straw color with a good amount of head on this one. Left good lacing as well. Smell was a tad on the hoppy side with some light sweeten malts in the background. Taste was pretty clean, but had some grains, floral hops and malts all blending in. Mouthfeel was light-medium and had some good carbonation. Good brew to drink in the summer time."
"Magic Hat presents this in literature as a cream ale. Sampled at the brewery. Was OK, malty aroma, lace in glass. Hops, herbal, balanced. Spiciness.Golden colour. Tad of fruit and spot acidic. Served up quite fresh. Light mouthfeel. Nothing special for Magic Hat."
"Well, well...it's nice to see that Heart of Darkness and Humble Patience are being replaced with Mother Lager and crap like this."
"On tap at the Magic Hat brewery in Vermont. I had to try this twice as my wife did not care for the sample she ordered at the bar. A nice tasty average American Pale Ale. Possible session brew. It was one of many I tried at the bewery. Whilst it was not the worst I tried it was clearly not their flagship."
"This beer poured a hazy, yellow color with white foam that clung to the inside of the glass. The smell was minimally malty. The taste was malty and somewhat bready with modest hoppiness. The mouthfeel was smooth and dry with medium body and low carbonation feel. The aftertaste was lightly bready malt. This was an easy-drinking pale ale."
"A pale hazy gold color with a simple white head. This isn't a glamourous beer by any means but it's drinkability is very good. It has a smooth texture of fruity taste that has very slight bitterness. It's on the lighter side so mouthfeel is a little tart and wheaty. If you see it give it a whirl."
"This was shared with me by a fellow homebrewer. It pours a straw color with a small head that falls fast and doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma is filled with hops, but it has a strong malt backing. The flavor is mostly comprised with a hefty does of hops with some caramel malts thrown in for good measure. A pretty decent brew. Has a medium body and good drinkability."
"The cap said, When in a trance dont take off your pants. Seems like good advice. Thin, filmy head, though carbonation was noticeable and maintained throughout; large bubbles, creating constellations on the surface. Yellow, straw hue with a slightly hazy aspect. Smells suspiciously wheat-like, with clover some other grasses, and lemon all mixing it up. On the tongue, coriander come immediately to the fore, with some hints of basil, wheat, and lemon zest. Slightly meaty mouth feel, with what I would describe as the Magic Hat feel. Soothing alcohol, I could drink a number of these sitting on a dock in Maine, watching the stars blink on in the twilight, a Red Sox game on the radio."
"D- Quite smooth and easy to consume. Would make a better session beer on a hot day in the Summer than in the Winter."
"I stared at the label for a good fifteen minutes before I figured out, ""Oh a beer for Bill Lee."" With that out of the way, it was time to drink. Golden yellow, with a puffy white head. Good hops, hot over powering. Some citric. Overall a good drinking ale."
"This beer reminds me more of a lager than an ale. It's light and refreshing and very well balanced."
"Pours with a white, two-fingered head, fades soon and leaves a good lace. Medium carbonation. Clear pale yellow color. Nose is hoppy, starts and finishes hoppy with some bitterness. Lingering hoppy aftertaste. $2.99 for a 22oz bottle from Drum Hill Liquor, Chelmsford, MA."
"I was not impressed with the taste, however. It had a bitter foretaste, and a finish that tasted like a wheat beer, but it was unremarkable. The aroma led me to believe there would be more complexity to it. I liked the bitterness, but there has to be more to a beer's flavor than just bitter."
"I was a fan of Bill Lee's but not his freaking Eifiss Pitch."
"Spaceman ale pours up a sizeable and lacy white head to crown it's bright golden body. The mild grass aroma hints at the beers flavor but doesn't tell the while story. The light-bodied ale enjoys a marvelous balance between grass and grainy notes and a tart citrus hop flavor. There's a hint of diacytl butter tying the whole beer together. For a beer with such mild flavors, it's quite interesting. As a magic hat beer, it's surprisingly normal."
"I presume it is named after ""Spaceman"" Bill Lee who used to pitch for the Red Sox and I believe lives in Vt. Label has a baseball on it in the typical Magic Hat Weird Logo. Says it is an ale but reminded me of a lager Medium yellow with a good head and excellent lacing. Smell is mainly malt with some buttery notes. Flavor is a light round malt with an equally light hop finish. Mouthfeel is somewhat light and drinkability therefore is quite good. A good brew to drink cold...quite refreshing...a definite summer type offering."
"I got the ""You're So Wry"" cap. I'll bet someone out there collects these..."
"I'm not really sure what to make of this beer. It doesn't tell the style on the bottle except that it's an ale. At first I thought it was a hoppy lager, but it says it's an ale. Anyway, it's very light, sort of tastes like a hoppier version of the mother lager. Nothing to write home about, just a simple, very drinkable lawnmower beer."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a big 1+"" white head, which has a reasonable amount of staying power and laces excellently. Aroma of pale malts and slight hops over this straw hued brew. Taste of slight bitterness through the delicate grains. Very drinkable brew, for sure."
"Golden with a good white head; highly carbonated. Aroma was predominately fruity. Taste was clean and refreshing; hops, malt, and a zesty fruitiness all present. Citrusy, slighly sweet notes were detectable; the finish was a bit more bitter with a dry, slightly fruity aftertaste."
"Appearance a pure yellow with small bits of carbonation and small white head. Slight smell of fruit with a mix of a moderate hop smell. Taste was slightly spicy, slightly bitter. Mouthfeel was smooth with enough texture to remind you this isn't swill. Drinkability is quite high, smooth enough to be a great session beer. Magic Hat has better beers, but you won't be disappointed with this brew. Don't expect to be amazed either."
"When they say pale, they mean pale. This poured a clear, light gold, like apple juice with a thick foamy head as white at the Vermont snow. Unfortunately that was the best of it. The smell was indistinct: some light lemon and pine esters offset by just the slightest touch of hops. There followed a disappointingly thin mouthfeel and rather a bland taste. Best left for summer, not hearty enough for the ""chair lift"" weather."
"slightly cloudy yellow with a thin white head the majority of which dissappates quickly. first wiff is of euro lager but after few more it smells slightly belgian with a little bit of a ginger ale smell. i can pick out white grapes and spiciness, and a little of that ginger taste too. it's gets a little bready as it warms. pretty mild but pretty tasty. light to medium bodied. drinkability is good. i just polished off the bomber and i feel like i could drink some more."
"Big Bottle: A bit of a pale golden, almost yellow color. I didn't get a whole lot of head in mine. A bit of a fruity aroma, although it wasn't too strong. A bit of malts and some spiciness (ginger?) to the taste, but not much else. A hint of bitterness in the aftertaste. Somewhere between light and medium bodied. Not likely to be bought again."
"Bought a 22 oz. bomber of this today. Poured a hazy yellow, with a thick but firm head, slow to recede. Hops were the main tone of the beer. Hops to the nose when I took it in, and hops again when I drank it in. Not at all a bad brew, but not the best I've had from Magic Hat or even today."
"thanks again to paceyourself!"
"F."
"Pale yellow color, with a thin white head. Hoppy smell and very hoppy flavor. Pretty dry, with light hop bitterness from start to finish. Much more hoppy than I remember from having this when it first came out a few years ago. Very drinkable, could have many of these but the flavor goes stale after a handful. The coolest thing about this beer is that it commemorates Mad River Glen ski area, an old-time resort just down the road from Magic Hat in Waitsfield, VT. Mad River preserves the skiing experience the way it was before corporate America took over the ski industry, and still has the original single chair lift in operation that was installed in 1948 when the mountain opened."
"Presented in a 22oz. bomber, this is a clear, golden colored ale with a small head that left a bit of lace as I drank. When I took a whiff, it smelled almost exactly like the lemon-ginger Hocus Pocus that MagicHat release last summer - full of citrusy hops and a hint of ginger. The only thing that troubles me about this is I wish it was a summer release instead of winter. I can picture myself drinking this out in the sun at a barbeque or what-have-you instead of couped up inside. The taste itself was at first of ginger and spices, and then softened up to a smooth finish. I may be crazy, but I swear the aftertaste was a little reminiscent of shrimp (don't be frightened by this though - this isn't as bad as it sounds). Once again, a beer that I will look for for every season to come."
"The crystal clear light golden color caught me by surprise as did the taste. The spicy aroma and flavors reminded me more of a pilsner than a pale ale. A hint of ginger is present but not for long. Overall i was disappointed with Single Chair Ale but i still remain a big fan of Magic Hat."
"Very unique. Unlike any beer I've had before. Would definitely have this again."
"I had thought I had tried everything from the Hat, but I was pleasantly proven wrong.  This brew has a nice light golden glow and spicy aroma.  The first flavor to jump out is the spicy hops.  This brew has a characteristic I have never tasted in a beer before, the hoppiness morphs into a lingering  malt sweetness.  I loved this beer."
"I could easilty see pairing this with sushi, or other fish meals."
