"This beer is crisp, refreshing, and has the perfect amount of hops in it."
""
""
""
"O:  Drain-pour"
"A nice balanced pale ale that hits the spot."
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  Good beer and tasty.  Definitely worthy of the medals it has won at both the World Beer Cup (Gold in 2000) and the Great American Beer Festival (Gold in 1999 and Bronze in 2006).  I’ll certainly get it again!"

"I know it's described as ""English-style"" on the label, but it's still surprisingly malt forward for a pale ale.  Not as balanced (or to my taste) as more hop-forward pale ales."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a fairly solid offering.  While certainly not the best Pale I've ever had, it's certainly makes a great session beer and provides a nice alternative to most other Pales.  I should add that it also goes well with most food."
""
""
""

"Overall: A really nice English style beer that is thick and hearty.  Low alcohol makes it easy to drink, and I will definitely seek this one out again."

"Copper on the pour with a one finger head from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass.   Bland smell of Malt and outs.  Taste was slight hops on the front, and slight malt on the back, but nothing special - good - but was hoping for more from Great Divide."
""
""
""
""
""
"Beer #1 on a great divide sampler night. Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a golden color with a 1 inch head. Smell is of malts, some sweetness. Taste is less malty than the smell. Hops are up front, but not overpowering. Some malts are present, as well as a bit of lemon. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a decent beer, but one is enough for tonight."
""
"DPA is one of Great Divide's best sellers, and it's easy to understand why.  Smooth, very drinkable, and not too high alcohol, you'll reach for this one a lot.  Nothing wrong with a basic pale ale, and this one delivers."

"The taste is also full of caramel and toffee malt roasted sweetness with just a hint of pear maybe and a low bitterness to finish things of. It is a nicely done Pale for certain."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Definitely more in the vein of the English Pale because of the dominating malt presence which is fine if you're in the mood for that."

"A great bitter beer without being over the top bitter. The hops almost feel as if they jump around while you're drinking. There's a slightly sweet start with that aforementioned bitter finish that I personally look forward to when I go for another swig. Not sure how it is in the bottle but I'd definitely have this beer again."
""
""
"Overall - a nice pale that should appease pale fans."
""
""
""
"The Denver Pale Ale is ok...While I am writing this I am still drinking it hoping it will grow on me a bit more. The beer poured a nice Amber clear color with thin foamy white head that is leaving a spotty lace. The scent has some fresh hop to it....but very faint. The taste a decent balanced beer with slightly bitter hops paired well with caramel type malt. The mouthfeel is medium in body with good carbonation. Overall it good....but not outstanding."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A+ for at least trying to brew an English pale but the brew is a D at best. if somebody put a macro-brew label on this, I might buy it. there is no malt taste at all, and what hops there are taste more like rubbing alcohol than Fuggles. too bad ... I had high hopes, but this is definitely a one-off for me."

"This beer is a great pale ale. Totally satisfying, and with the non-crazy ABV, you can have a few. However with all the malt, not sure if I'd want more than a couple. I'd get this again though, certainly welcome it in the mixed pack."
"O: a decent ale, and not a style I'm familiar with, but a worthy try. Muted bitterness and easy drinking."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Seems like it would be best enjoyed in 6 seconds or less."

""
""

"O-Enjoyed this beer, it had many things going on and balanced out great."
""
""
"O - Easy drinking, which is what you want out of an English Pale Ale. Well balanced. Neither hops nor malt really take center stage. Happy to have tried, but I don't need to come back to this."

"A pretty slavish ode to the headier of the English pale ales out here, even delving slightly into ESB territory. Denver can be proud to call this their own session ale, even if the style and ABV hardly qualify it as such."

""
""
""
""
"Haven't tasted anything quite like this, but now that I have, I'll be back for more."
"Great with giant NJ sea scallops, and yellow heirloom tomates with lightly sauteed cukes, beet leaves, chard, and pasta and rosemary bread. Great food beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A well-done APA with excellent, distinctive flavors and aromas to please your palate. It's not a powerhouse hop bomb nor an overly bold malt monster, just a well-balanced yet easy drinking ale. Tasty and classy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: A pretty solid take on the English Pale Ale style. Good bready biscuit taste with some nice earthy backing hops."

"Let's hope our Colorado brethren don't start clamoring for a new style, the DPA... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear amber topped by a finger of lightly off-cream-white foam. The nose comprises earthy and spicy greens, light leek, cilantro, mustard seed, and peat moss. ...Didn't see that coming, like a surprise roundhouse from JCVD. The taste is mostly a blast of spicy and salty greens (think a salad of cilantro, chive, parsley, and spinach, all drizzled with a chlorinated peppercorn dressing), though there is a backbone of mild biscuit trying desperately to bring things back to reality. No avail, I'm afraid. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a wet feel. Overall, this is a strange and downright unpleasant (or, if I'm not being so euphemistically-inclined, nasty) beer. It's touted as a balanced and mild English-style pale ale, but it comes across as an oddly spicy and salty mess. I thought I got a bad bottle, but, upon talking with others who have had it from the source (on tap in the Rockies), it's clear this stuff is just plain awful."
""
""
"Had this poured into a pint glass. Smell was understated with hints of malt, toffee, and slightly floral. The taste was less hoppy as you might expect from a English style pale ale, and there were nice hints of caramel and vanilla. The carbonation was maybe a bit more than I'd like but not too bad. The appearance is sort of a goldish-copper, and there wasn't much of a head. Overall, pretty decent."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: this was a nice change for a pale ale. It has a good malty flavor and the oil from the hops give a nice mouthfeel but could have hit more flavor points"

"Pours crystal clear with a finger of egg white head. Nice caramel / orangish hue. Faint to no hops in the nose but hints of straw, biscuit, and a touch of sweetness. I really like the mouthfeel of this beer, upper end of medium body. Slight earthy hops present in the taste with nice caramel and toasty malt character. Overall this is a very pleasant beer that is well made. My enjoyment was after a particularly stressful day and it went down well in the adirondack chair on the front lawn."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-I have mixed feelings about this beer. I tend to like more sharpness in my pale ales, and this brew was definitely on the butter side and malt heavy (which is odd given the lack of head and oily lacing on the glass). Nevertheless, I guess this IS an English Pale, so it can't be faulted too much for being overly malty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Appearance is pale and clear with minimal head. Smell is mild and grainy, almost no hops to speak of. Taste is much like the nose, with and addition of a little earthy hop presence along with some caramel. Mouthfeel is lackin in carbonation and is very light. Pretty boring beer overall."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – My bottle is from August 2012, which isn't helping I'm sure.. It's got a little too much of a herbal/wet grass type flavour going on for me. It reminds me of a fall/oktoberfest type beer."
"O-A very complex brew. I feel like I haven't picked up on all the flavors as I have only drank one. A damn good pale ale, though. What a good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a decent take on the British style. It doesn't have a very complex flavor profile, but the drinkability is there. I could definitely work on a six-pack of this while watching the game."
""

"On tap at Great Divide. Apparently have never had this. Golden color. Lots of grainy malt. Light bitterness. No hop flavor."

"An interesting light drinkable ale, just on the high end of being sessionable but probably could be. I've never had a beer that tastes quite like this one, so it gets points for uniqueness. I'm not sure how I feel about it, but I think I like it. Yes, I think I would like to have this again."
""
""
""
"This is a pretty good english pale ale. I would order it again if I see it on tap."
""
"O-At the end of the day a boring run of the mill Pale Ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is easy to drink and very well balanced. It's a nice change of pace having this compared to American Pale Ales."
""
"This is a pleasant ale to knock back during dinnertime. Denver Pale Ale features an amber orangish color with an attractive creamy head which retains well. The nose hints that this pale ale is going across the Atlantic for its inspiriation, lead by notes of orange, cream, and buttery fusels. The taste starts off crisp and netural, eventually breaking towards a buttersctoch note. A modest kick of hops make their mark in the 2nd half of each sip. Offering both a crisp and somewhat creamy texture, this pale ale is a more than fair choice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: Decent, though not quite English in style. Missing some of the toffee and butterscotch flavors you'd expect from an English style pale ale. There was also a bit too much grassy flavor for my liking. Nevertheless, this is a solid beer that that some people will really enjoy. Give it a chance if you see it. Thanks again Doops!"
""
"Overall this was nice. Would buy again."
""
"O- not bad if your in the mood for an EPA."

"Notes: Nicely drinkable and solidly hearty tasty meal in a bottle. Cheers."
"Bottle from Tipples in Gainesville. Pours golden copper, clear, and with a nice frothy white head. Light floral aroma, some caramel malts in the background. Flavor is sweet with some caramel and biscuity malts, very little bite or hop influence. I originally drank this thinking it was an APA, rather than an EPA, and was disappointed there wasn't more hop bite. But given the style, that's OK. Solid brew and very drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
"I was not fond of this creation. It had a confused set of flavors and aromas."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is creamy, with mild carbonation, a medium body that leans on the heavy side, and a sweet grainy finish that has bready notes and a slight hop bitterness. A very tasty pale ale that is easy to drink and well above average for this style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not something I'll have again. No character in this beer. Easy to drink as a macro, but it's not a macro, so it does little for me."
""
"O: This beer is enjoyable but not the easiest to drink - there is something a little different about the flavor and mouthfeel (especially for the style) that was not really to my preference."
""
""
"O - A unique pale ale that has a lot of exclusive characteristics. Not quite for me, although it makes me realize that aside from the formidable Yeti, not many of Great Divide's brews are to my liking."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours clear orangey amber in body with white bubbly head that fades. Smells of pine, citrus, slight nuttiness. Tastes of light nuttiness, pine and grassy, clean bitterness and then caramel and toffee to ride it out. Light in body with light carbonation. Malty pale ale that's well balanced."
""
""
""
""
"An average pale. One and done for me. 3.5"
"Pours a golden amber with a medium white head. Aroma and Taste of biscuit malt, yeast, some fruity citrus notes and some floral citrus hops. Palate is a medium body slightly crisp mouth feel and some good carbonation. Finish is sweet biscuit malt, yeast, fruity citrus notes with some citrus hops on the end for balance with a bit of a nutty ending. Overall a good drinking a solid ale for this style"

"I don't know what it is bout this beer but I always love kicking this one back. It has a distinct flavor that seems to stand out from the rest."
""
""
""
""
"O-This is a pretty good beer. I enjoy the bitterness a lot. Would prefer a bit more of a caramel body but this is still a damn good beer at a pretty nice price."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a good pale ale. The balance between hops and malts is what I think of in a pale ale, and Great Divide gets this one right in that aspect."
""
""
"This pours an amber golden color in the glass. I get a pleasing orange hop aroma followed by some toasted malt notes. The flavor has an upfront bittering with a light orange citrus and a pleasing finish."
""
""
"Pretty average pale ale overall. The sight and smell were above average, but the taste and feel was fairly average overall."
""
"Pours a dark gold with a finger of white head, minimal beading. Definitely smells English. Malt forward - nutty/bready malt presence supported by a minimal amount of earthy hops. Little bit of wood if you really snort for it. The taste brings a lot of the same plus a bit of metallic malty afterburn. Perfectly drinkable but not too exciting. Don’t mind getting this one in a mixer but wouldn’t ever seek it out on its own."
"Pours a wonderful golden orange with a short bubbly white head. Pale malts, caramel, fresh hops, citrus and lemongrass; earthy and mildly floral aroma. First sip is very similar to the nose. Pale malt, fresh hops and citrus on the initial taste which rolls into a flattened, medium sized body. Dry, hoppy finish. Great drinkability."
"O: Great session beer. Slightly hoppier than the Ipswitch. I liked the Ipswitch just a little bit more, but both are very good."

"Poured from bottle to pint glass the beer pours a clear amber color with a 3/4 finger white head, some retention, some lacing. The nose is a nice blend of hops and caramel malty sweetness. The flavor is very much the same with a an initial surge of earthy and citrus hops that gradually mellow and allow the caramel malt to emerge creating a balanced flavor. Mild to medium bitterness and medium bodied with good carbonation. The beer finishes with a lingering hop flavor and mild sweetness. Crisp and clean. Overall, a good pale ale, not one I would actively pursue but wouldn't pass on necessarily."
"Pours amber with a finger of whipped creamy foam. This falls to a quilt of the same. Some pine, citrus and a hint of body odor on the nose, nothing remarkable. Taste is malty with a dominant english and oxidized character. Medium body with moderate carb. Decent for drinking, nothing to send home about."
""
""
""
""
""
"the head formed quickly and went with some moderate lacing. its smell was it's least interesting quality. it was bitter. the taste was decent. there wasn't the malt i was expecting. it reminded me of a weak IPA. the hops took this one over. all in all it was ok. worth a try but not a full six pack."
""
""
"The taste is a nice mix of hops and malt, but neither is too much. Not the greatest pale ale I have had or the best from Great Divide, but certainly not a bad beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"decent english style pale ale. pours a darker yellow color with a medium head. smells very english, tons and tons of malts, like a dense loaf of fresh bread. some more hops in the flavor, but only in there at the end. feels pretty good too in the mouth. lots of body here, and enough carbonation. easy drinking but not particularly thrilling. overall good beer in the great divide lineup"
""
""
""
"Pours a copper/amber with a white head that quickly leaves. The aroma is a balance between the lemon zest and sweet but bready malt. Flavor wise is pretty much in line with the aroma as the first flavor that presents itself is that of some lemon, then comes the bready but sweet malt middle, and it closes out with a distinct dose of some hops. A nice medium body to this thing. A very solid EP that fans of pale ale's will surely like a lot more than me. For me, I can drink it happily but generally don't go out of my way for."
""
"At first glance, this isn't all that different than your standard APA. It's a nice amber color, but nothing overly glowing. Has a clean, white 1 finger head after the pour, but it doesn't stick around for very long. The appearance is the only thing that I find average on this beer. The smell holds little back: sweet, earthy hops right up front, but the malts get in there too. The same could be said for that first swig of it: more hops than it would lead you to believe right up front, but a really nice malty backbone that a lot of beers with this much hops seem to leave out. In fact, the balance on this one is really spot-on. The mouthfeel is a little thicker than your typical pale, with medium, foamy carbonation, but this beer is really very drinkable. I think the mouthfeel is really where it excels. Overall, this is my favorite standard pale ale. The 5.4% is hard to believe from a beer that packs this much hoppiness, but I don't think there's much that could get better about it. A staple in my fridge."
""
"O: I do enjoy this beer, but it is not one of my regulars. I drink it when I buy the variety pack. Still, it's above average and I look forward to drinking it when I do get it."
"O: 3"

"Sparkly, clear copper pour with a light but foamy white head and a solid amount of lacing all the way down. Very pleasant floral hops in the aroma, with just the right amount of sweet caramel malt behind it. Light caramel backbone with the bitter English hop presence. Smooth and dry on the palate, with a crisp bitter finish. Quite tasty and refreshing!"

""
""
""
""

"Although I liked it, it's still slightly too bitter for my tastes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a orange/amber/tan color, the hues slightly remind me of the look of a marzen. The head is about 3/4 of an inch an has pretty good retention. Carbonation is visible. This is truly a visually appealing beer. Smell is of toffee, grainy malts, and citrus hops. The taste emphasizes the malts, but it still doesn't seem disproportionally flavored to me. The taste starts with a caramel sweetness them gets a mottled more toasty. A slight bitterness is imparted by the citric hops. Mouthfeel is good, feels satisfyingly thick, often other pale ales feel a little weak in this dept to me. I really enjoyed this, I'd love to get my hands on more of it to drink as an everyday sort of beer."

"Overall, a decently balanced beer. Slightly heavy on the palate for my preference; I could see this benefitting from higher attenuation, fewer crystal malts, or both."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a very drinkable beer, though nothing spectacular. A lot of my friends who are getting into beers love this though so I would definitely recommend it for someone getting into beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Easy to drink with a medium body, good carbonation, and a clean, crisp finish. Not super exciting overall but very well made and tasty. Quite sessionable, I’d think."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Solid pale ale, not sure if I'd ever purchase this in a 6-pack considering Great Divide has so many incredible beers, but it was a welcomed addition in the variety pack."
""
""
""
"D - Another solid offering from GD. It's idealy built, and well balanced."
""
""

"Drinkability – If you are a fan of the style you will love this effort. This is a terrific drinker, well-balaned yet bold, with an incredibly smooth character."
"Its so easy to drink and matches up so nicely with the best of the best beers out there. Great Divide is such a top notch brewery even their Pale ale is a winner. Good beer from Colorado."
"This is an interesting brew. Curious as to how they got the feel of it without amping up the body."
"Nothing that really knocks my socks off here, just a solid pale ale. Nicely drinkable, but nothing that I'd go out of my way to get again."
"OVERALL: This reminds me a lot of Goose Island Honker's Ale. It is an easy drinking, slightly bitter, beer that is widely available."
"Overall, solid pale ale a touch on the bready/biscuity side but a flavor profile that works well with the bitterness to complement."
"O - one of the best pale ales I've ever had. Love this one"
"Poured into a pint glass. Nice two finger head that sticks around for a while. Great lacing down the sides. Nice grapefruit hop flavors. The hops are not very biting and round out nicely considering the beer. It's a nice middle of the road beer for hop heads. I'd buy this beer again sometime."
"Overall: A nice example of an english pale ale in the taste. A little off in the aroma. A very good beer."
"Overall Impression- Tough to say, but this was not a good English Pale Ale from Great Divide. Way to sweet and malty. Needed to have more hops in here. I'm still wondering why there wasn't a Bottled On date on this one but all the rest... This may be just a bad brew. Will try again to see."
"Great Divide Denver Pale Ale: The label reads “English Style Ale”, and that what you get! Pour this beer and you get and English Oak panel brown color body topped with a thin off-white head that fades by the time most of the brew is gone. Very good aroma, nice complexity with a lot of roasted malt coming through. Flavors come on slowly, but end with the unmistakable roasted malt that is typical of an English style ale. There is just the right amount of bitterness, and lots of malt sweetness. This Great Divide ale goes down smoothly for a beer with a thick feel to it. English style ales are not my favorite type of beer, but this is a good one if you are so inclined, and a good beer overall."
"Ov- One of the true great american pales, that isn't just a masquerading IPA. Excellent."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being moderate. Overall it was a pretty solid and easy drinking beer. It showed off the malty, toasty, somewhat sweet flavors nicely while still managing to be balanced and drinkable."
"O: a good beer to try and enjoy, good malt character with slight hop presence."
"appears hazy orangish color, with big rocky white colored head. it does smell a bit stale, a little cardboardish. taste seems fine, about in-line for an English pale ale- malty with just a touch of hops to balance. medium body, higher carbonation."
"O-overall a good pale ale that is perfect to session with the hot weather."
"OK I guess? The apple cider/applesauce character, which at times makes me think of Gerber baby food, really picks up steam as it warms which isn’t my favorite flavor profile in a beer and detracts from my enjoyment."
"Definitely worth a try."
"Pours a clear copper color, soapy head and moderate lacing. Aroma is lightly floral, some citrus and caramel. In the taste, english pale malts, semi-fruity yeast, and a small pine/citrus hop presence. Not so bitter, tang from the yeast, not too sweet either. Light to medium bodied feel, adequate carbonation. Overall, an easy going pale ale with crossover potential."
"Taste is mild, but certainly well-hopped. Nonetheless, it's not too bitter or heavy. A solid and session-worthy pale ale with a clean, fresh flavor and good balance."
"It's a pretty tasty beer. I'd happily drink this one again, and I'm glad I bought a sixer of it because I'm ready for another!"
"Not a bad beer and I am enjoying it for sure, just very simple and there are better pales (American or English) out there."
"Good job, Great Divide. Another amazingly balanced, drinkable, delicious beer. Definatly recomend to anybody. There isnt a bad note in this one."
"Found at the back of the beer fridge at a friends house. A good pale ale with a healthy kick and awesome mouthfeel that made it stand out from your usual domestic pale ale entries. It didn't taste like it was old or skunky, which made me wonder why it had been lost in the depths of the fridge. Glad I found it."
"Don’t let me mislead you. While the hops to me are more prevalent than the light malt, this is not a hoppy beer. It’s just a well balanced pale ale. It seems like it’d be a great session beer, or even a great fallback beer in a moment of indecision. It’s a classic in the pale ale style, well done in that regard."
"This pours a light amber color with a white head. The smell is light, a little bread malts, a hint of grass. Feel is medium. The taste is better than expected from the smell, I get some bread malts up front, a ittle caramel / toffee sweetness and a nice hoppy bitter finish. Overall a pretty good beer."
"Taste- Yup, same as the smell, which is to say AWESOME. You get the taste of warm, freshly baked white bread, followed by some maltiness, then a moderate hop bitter finish, and its all in perfect balance. Its amazing. Its refreshing. Its comforting. Its super satisfying and thirst quenching."
"Cheers!"
"A very well balanced pale ale."
"A really good pale ale, its just a shame that really good pale ales leave you with little to say. This one is a well made exercise in restrained, classical brewing."
"D: Definitely not for the hop head as this is a very basic beer. Nice and simple if you are trying to get started with pale ales and haven't quite gotten the taste for strong hops yet. If you're a hop addict, avoid this as it will taste quite bland."
"Not alot of frills but that's what I expect with english styles"
"Well, it's pleasant enough. I won't write a ballad about it, but nicely carbonated and quaffable."
"Overall it isn't bad, its just not good... not going to recommend it to anyone"
"Pours a slightly hazy orange color with a 1/2 inch off-white head that fades to an oily film. Random spots of lace dot the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt and citrus zest along with an off-putting herbal and skunk aroma. Taste is of malt and citrus zest/pine hops with a very herbal quality. Mild hop bitterness on the palate fades quickly. This beer has good carbonation with a crisp and clean feel. Overall, this is alright but I wouldn't get it again most likely."
"D- 3.5 I'm glad I gave this single a shot, but I don't think I'd buy it again. OK overall, but nothing all that exciting. It was kind of bland. If I preferred the flavor a little more I could drink plenty based on its smoothness alone (and it isn't heavy, either). I'd like to try some other Great Divide products nonetheless."
"D - Very drinkable. The flavors all mix together really nice and there is a really solid hap malt balance here. The stronger yeast character is also very nice."
"Pours a clear copper color with a one finger head which gives way to nothing with no lacing. The aroma is subtle with a slight hop hint and some caramel malts. The taste is much of the same, there is a slight caramel malt character along with a little lemon and at the end a little hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is a little watery. Overall the beer is solid, the taste is what shines through on this one, the nice subtle notes of the style are really present there. You could have a couple of these."
"Overall: This is one of my favorite beers to drink with chili or other spicy food. Just a great complement. It shines with a meal but is not as fantastic by itself, in my opinion."
"O - Not my favorite in the style, probably wouldn't go out of my way for another offering. It's not bad, but not great. I'm such a huge fan of Great Divide's Imperial Stout, DIPA, and Barleywine...I guess you can't be great at everything."
"This beer is pretty typical of the style a little better than most I've had, but not as good as some. Very drinkable and sessionalble, though."
"Well balanced and sessionable GDBC has gotten those aspects of the English pale style down pat but this beer barely makes it into the pale range with the hops. Only slightly bitter and lacking in flavor, sessionable for sure but not enough integrated into this beer to be memorable. A stepping stone beer into the world of pale ales."
"Bottle. Poured into a tulip glass a darker hued orange amber color eith a fluffy white big bubbled head that sticks to the glass. Sweet orange with maybe a slight pineapple flavor in the nose. Medium mouthfeel. Not really overly bitter by any means and leans more on the citrus sweet side. Some bitterness lingers. Overall, this is ok, and probaby would be better suited for folks that are just getting into Pale with a light hop quality. No real alcohol notes. Fairly easy drinking but far from remarkable."
"O: Quite enjoyable, kick back and relax kind of beer. Well worth a try."
"This was much liked by my wife."
"O-That sour aroma and taste make this one tough to get down. I have to say I am greatly surprised by this one. Normally GD beers can be counted on for quality. I'll have to buy this one again and revisit it, maybe it was a bad bottle."
"O--I believe this is my first English Pale Ale. It's nice, but I think I prefer the APA more. I don't see myself buying this again, but I wouldn't turn it down if offered."
"Overall: This may have been the first pale ale i ever had some 17 years ago. It is like a remembered it, a well balanced sessionable ale."
"Taste, bitter, not hoppy though. A little bit of caramel, offputting aftertaste. Gritty. Yeasty. Once your palate gets adjusted, becomes easier to drink. Somewhat lemony. Too pricy at almost $10 a 6 pack."
"Overall, this is an excellent English style pale ale. I wonder if some of its detractors on the site are grading the style more than grading the beer to the style. Interestingly, it does not seem to have suffered from being a bit past its labeled prime."
"But that isn't the case, and I wish for more. I don't mean to be cruel here, but this beer just seems a little too watery, with a hint of the bitterness and an even fainter hint of the hoppiness that I'm lookin' for."
"Overall, probably the least impressive of the Great Divide line up. Would be scored higher here if the prices were lower. Still, a decent beer for grilling out or enjoying with snacks."
"12 ounce bottle. Pours crystal clear light orange amber color with a 2 finger off white head with very good retention that reduces to a lacing cap that lasts for the entire glass. Some ok glass lacing. Aromas of citrus, floral, spices, and caramel. Aromas are a bit weak, but still pretty good. Taste of caramel, spices, bread, and some citrus. There is a fairly large amount of bitterness that comes at the finish, and it linger for a while with spiciness and citrus flavors. No alcohol noticed at all. Medium body and fairly high carbonation, the carbonation seems to detract some of the flavor, but is not too bad. Some good balance of the hops and malts. Very refreshing beer with a nice bitter bite. Overall a very solid pale ale."
"D: Goes down alright, but not something I would drink all the time. Other Great Divides are better."
"O - a very drinkable beer; has plenty of interest; perfectly sessionable"
"Pours a pale yellow with a bit of an orange hue. Nice one-finger white head. Really good lacing. Faint citrus hop aroma. Not much there. Taste starts off with a refreshing, light hop profile. Solid mix of grassy, citrus and pine hops. Fairly big, sweet malt profile gives this one a classic APA flavor profile. Hints of cherry, sweet bread, toffee and caramel malt. Some hop crispness lingers on the aftertaste."
"D- Ill drink it again but not top on the list."
"the denver pale ale pours a beautiful golden orange and looks great in the glass. The smell is a rich hoppiness that really gets me excited for a sip. The flavor is a sharp bite at first followed by a rich smoothness. A worthy beer. If you get a chance give this one a try."
"Not GD's best."
"The mouthfeel is nice, it goes down easily without being too thin. And it's drinkable enough, it's a bit too sweet for me but otherwise goes down very nicely. Another middle-of-the-road craft brew that does nothing different to stand out from the pack."
"D: Eh, I could take it or leave it. Was ok. I would drink it if there were no other craft brew options available."
"Drinkability: Very solid English Pale Ale. Well balanced and drinkable."
"A solid representation of a pale ale. Good, not great. I wouldn't turn it down but probably will not seek it out in the future."
"Pours a medium gold color w/ a off white head that quickly disappears. Very floral nose to this beer, and not much else. There's a floral, grassy, hoppy taste to this beer. Maybe some vanilla in there as well. The mouthfeel is the best part of this beer for me. Very smooth and creamy, like an IPA root beer float. Drinkability is somewhere between fair and good. This is a good solid beer. Not great, but I'm thankful to have tried it."
"Bottled on Nov. 24, 2010"
"Poured from the bottle with an explosive thick foamy white head,even with a gentle pour the head pillowed,color was a bright orange copper. Smell was of tropical and piney hops with perhaps a bit of buscuity malt. Taste was hop dominated mostly grapefruit and piney hops with a touch of buscuity malt. Mouthfeel was alive very crisp and dry. Drinkability was nice would enjoy in the summer or fall!"
"Drinkability: Has a bit more bite than most Pales, but it is still pretty drinkable."
"D: Very drinkable and smooth. Could drink a few of these no problem. Goes great with a cheeseburger and fries."
"Solid beer from Great Divide; tasty, crisp and quite sessionable. Nothing spectacular, just solid."
"The M&D are dry at the finish but but easy to drink and very satisfying. a great beer for anytime."
"Overall a refreshingly good beer. Nothing too exciting and not something I would actively seek out or feel I am missing to not have regularly. Just a solid pale ale, much like many others."
"All in all not to bad of a beer."
"Poured a clear copper amber with a one fingered off white head with a fair amount of sticky lacing the entire pint glass. Light aromas of malts and citrus hops on the nose. Crisp piney hops and malt on the palate with nice clean feel and desent carbonation."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a nonic, hazy gold pour with a big, sticky white head. The beer leaves nice rings of lace on the glass. The aroma is light and floral. It has a floral hop taste up front and a lighly bitter finish, kinda muddled in the middle. The body is lighter than I would like, but not terrible. A decent English Pale, not a beer I would seek again."
"It says ""English"" on the label, as in English Pale Ale, but it seems to me that the only thing English here is the label copy. Everything about this beer says American Pale Ale. There's isn't enough fruity aroma or taste to qualify as a good English PA, but it has enough floral stuff in it to make it compete with a decent APA, such as those from BBC. There's a edgy, sharp bite from the hops and the ample fizz, and the dry finish would make it a decent pounder, although I would't recommend wasting it that way. Overall it's a nice, average beer for average circumstances."
"D- Very drinkable, but not impressive. Watery. Goes down easy. Bland."
"The contradictions in this beer place it very high on the list of most-drinkable beers."
"D/O- Drinkability is high due to low ABV% and the fact that there isn't too much flavor to kill the palate. A six pack would be no problem with this beer. Consider me a tad unimpressed."
"D - Taking into accounnt the complexity of this beer, the drinkability is extremely high. The first night picked this beer up I drank 5 in a row at a party and felt great. Therefore, I would deem this beer a very tasty session beer."
"Slightly below average pale that can be skipped. I'd try it again on cask."
"Notes: This is a solid English Pale Ale with a touch of American boldness and flare."
"This is good, but I'd throw it in with the many beers I've tried that taste almost the same. Entry level pale ale, along the lines of Great Lakes or Sierra Nevada."
"Seems more like a crisp APA than an English Pale Ale. Either way...damn good. Never dissapointed w/ Great Divide."
"Highly drinkable, this is an easy go-to session beer."
"One of my all-time favorite English Pale Ales, for sure."
"All in all, it's certainly drinkable but I wouldn't say that I would rank this in the top beers for style. I love EPA's, and the maltiness and caramel usually found in them. So, I'm a little disappointed."
"Poured into a pint glass. Nice golden amber color with a fluffy slightly off white head and sticky lacing. Lots of visible carbonation. Smells like sweet citrus fruit with a nice malts and a hint of hops. Really good balance on this one, Taste of oats and grains with a bit of a hop finish and a mild sweetness. This is really great. Good mouth feel with a medium body and nice carbonation. At 5.4, this is a great one to enjoy a few of."
"Bottled on May 12, 2010. Drank on August 12 2010. Thanks to my brother for giving me this one. Poured into a pint glass with minimal head. Nice golden color to this one. Smells like bready malt sweetness. Spicy hops can be detected as well. As far as the smell goes, everything is in perfect balance. The taste is immediately sweet with bitterness hitting the sides of the tongue. This is a crisp, nicely balanced medium bodied ale. I would recommend this to anyone who just wants a better beer."
"Decently done beer from Great Divide. It tastes slightly hoppy, but the word I would most use to describe it is light; not so much weak, or watery, but light. I find it incredibly drinkable, very clean, but only slightly buttery aftertaste, just enough to invite another. Perfect for a hot day in my opinion. Not the most remarkable or complex, but I think it makes for a fantastic six pack."
"D: Quite a good pale ale, I thought. I could drink many of DPAs, and I think it should appeal to a wide range of beer drinkers. Recommended as an easy-drinking, sessionable brew or one to break out when all your rowdy friends come calling."
"Deep yellow-orange in color with a nice white head that leaves a healthy white cap. Light citrusy lemon and malt aromas. Light bodied with a buttery smoothness. Light hoppy lemon and grapefruit flavors in the beginning that lead to malty, biscuit flavors adn a noce dry finish. Very easy to drink."
"This is a good, yet uninspiring pale ale that would make a good refreshing all day/night drinker."
"D- Very drinkable. This is actually my first english style Pale Ale, and though it probably wasn't the best choice for first try, it certainly got me more interested in the style."
"D: A nice enough pale ale, but so far it seems the English pales on this side of the pond have some work to do."
"Fairly smooth, slightly warming with a medium effervescence. Good stuff but somewhat weaker than other Great Divide offerings I've had."
"A solid pale ale from Great Divide which doesn't go overboard in really any direction. I had this with a burger before (which is suggested on the bottle) and it was pretty ideal."
"M/D: Very drinkable and very smooth. Good beer."
"Drinkability - Over all a decent Pale Ale, I would have it again"
"d- great, this is for sure one of the better pale ales that i've had in awhile. i would definately buy this again."
"Into a pint glass, poured a transparent copper with a high degree of carbonation and three fingers of white head. Possessed a very subtle, floral bitter hop nose; not much else. The taste revealed more; toffee, pear, apple, and maltiness, with a bitter/dry finish that lingered afterwards. Very thin feel to this one. Good for sessioning, however I prefer some more body and nose to it."
"Drinkability is great. A great example of true English Pale Ale."
"D - One of the best pale ales that I have had. Will definitely become a regular."
"Bottled on Feb 8, 2010 but has been in my fridge for the last month so hopefully it held up reasonably well. Pours a clear amber color with half inch of white head that held up well. Quite a bit of spotty lacing is left on the glass. Not much for carbonation bubbles after the pour. I get a lot of citrus hops in the aroma. Makes me think more American than English. Just a hint of floral in the aroma as well. Flavor features the citrus hops as well. A little too much caramel malt for my taste. Sort of has an artificial, plastic flavor. Bitterness is high for an English style. More substanital body than other pale ales. Carbonation is very gentle but this beer is far from flat. A beer that is very good in some ways but falls just short in others."
"Get this. I loved it"
"The beer has a good body to it and is wonderfully drinkable. This is a really good pale ale. Better than several I've tried recently. It's no Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, but it'll do."
"D: Very drinkable. Flavors are there and not overbearing. Actually a really nice drinkable pale ale."
"D - A little too hoppy for the ""English Pale Ale"" description on the label. A decent IPA or APA, but not one that I would get a second pint of - malt sweetness a little too much up front, bitterness lingering a bit much for what I was hoping for from an English pale."
"Great Divide Denver Pale Ale is a clear, sparkling, golden ale with a dense, bubbly, white head that fades to blotchy film and leaves nice lacing. It has a wooden and leafy aroma-- it's all hops. It has a smooth medium body and a dry finish. There's a nice, hoppy bitterness. The dry, crackery malt lays low. It's mostly the flavor of yummy hops. This is an excellent bitter session ale-- really tasty stuff."
"Drinkability is good. Tasty, and easy to drink."
"Buy Again? Yes."
"Pours a light golden-orange color, topped off with a decent amount of light beige foam. Not a whole lot going on with the nose, just a little biscuit malt and some inoffensive British hops. Similar flavors to those mentioned above: sweet malt cut with a little grassy hops. Not my favorite style by a longshot. A decent, solid beer, but far from interesting."
"Overall: This is a fine English Pale riding the line with American Pale Ale. Another strong offering from Great Divide."
"D - This is a very nice, balance brew. It is restrained although I would say a tiny bit sweet for the style."
"Taste: The beer is lighly smokey, a good dose off hop bitterness. The best before date is near and I am afreight that the beer has had it s best time. Next I will surge for a fresher one. I liked it enough to give it a second try."
"Some bread and spicy cereal blends nicely with late addition hops. Overall a decent pint."
"Got this as part of the current Great Divide sampler pack. Pours a deep, clear amber, with a decent off white head. Smell is a little faint and mostly malty. Has a definite English malt flavor up front with an earthy, resiny hop finish. Hops were a little more subtle than I would have liked; however, still felt this was a solid offering. Drinkability is pretty high with this one, when I finished the three in the sampler I was a little sad not to have more."
"Had this with Hyland from his Great Divide sample pack. Poured an amber-tan color with a light cream colored 1/2"" of head that reduced to an 1/8"" throughout with spotty lacing. Nothing overpowering but had a light hoppy smell with a malt backbone. It had a big malts up front with a surprisingly strong hop flavor despite the light aroma. This was surprisingly solid, well balanced ale, alot better than I expected. I can definately put a few of these back, wish it had a bit more APV."
"D - Not my favorite style, but I could see myself enjoying a good amount of these sitting outside in the middle of the day."
"This brewery does other things better, look elsewhere for a good Pale Ale."
"The bottle indicates Denver Pale Ale is ""brilliant"" & ""balanced."" I am inclined to agree. It's certainly not the most memorable of pale ales, but it's pretty darn solid - especially considering it's about two months old. I'd like to try it on tap."
"Appears a brilliant copper hue with a bright white head. The foam pours on thick and dwindles slowly leaving behind fine speckled lacing patterns between sips, a very nice appearance. Aromatics offer up a nice bread dough or biscuit malt sweetness with dry yeast notes, on the backend comes delicate floral and light citric hops flowing. Flavor is beautifully balanced APA, not aggressive with hop bitterness but has herbal and floral hop flavor. Malts are nice with biscuit malt flavors holding up the backbone of this brew. It is definitely English style compared to most APAs, you almost ask yourself where are the hops? Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied slighty oily texture going on, carbonation is soft and mild, which fits the flavor profile well. Drinkability is solid, if I had a sampler pack of the GD offerings this would be no problem."
"Medium bodied, firm and dry. A nice, drinkable pale ale."
"Poured from a cellar temperature bottle into a standard pint glass. The beer is light copper color, nearly golden. It's very clear and has a thick head of slightly tan bubbles. There is some patchy lacing left behind as this head settles. It has a nice floral hop aroma. The taste has a bit hop to it, both bitter and piney. Otherwise, there is some dry malt flavor with a kiss of sweetness. There is a bit of coating, but nothing significant. The carbonation is average. This is a decent pale ale, but it isn't all that complex. It doesn't demand your attention, you could easily drink it out of habit, not out of enjoyment. This bottle is a little old, it may have a more nuanced flavor when it is fresher."
"D - will stumble upon this again. Must track down the yeti."
"This has become one of my favorite pale ales. nice golden yellow color. Nose shows nice hops with some citrus notes. As far as the palate, it goes down nice and smooth. The hops are balanced with a creaminess usually common among English style pale ales, finishes somewhat bitter and leaving you wanting more. This is great beer to enjoy on a hot summer day"
"An excellent pale ale and I must add this to my list of must have beers."
"D - Very easy to drink and quite enjoyable right to the finish. I found myself able to drink a whole glass in about 10 minutes without any trouble. Very refreshing"
"I am a ""malt head"" but I like this a lot! I cannot wait until warmer weather comes so I can sit on my porch, barbecue some ribs, and sip this ale on a warm afternoon!"
"Great Divide has another solid brew here. Great Minds Drink Alike! Love it!"
"Na Zdravje!"
"D - Very sessionable."
"I love the English take on a Pale Ale. It'd be easy for a Colorado brewery to throw out another American version, but I really like the subtleties in this beer. It's deftly balanced, crisp, drinkable, refreshing, and interesting. A welcome holiday from the citrus bombs (which I also really like). Not to mention it's one of the few fresh English-style Pale Ales available to me regularly."
"M/D: GD really did their homework on this beer, since it fits the style perfectly. No real big flavors, but I could drink a lot of these. This beer went great with some Cheshire cheese."
"Very drinkable brew. This would make a great summer brew if you're into ales. Refreshing without being too light in body. Great brew!"
"Value: For what it is I think the value is pretty good. Could be a buck or so cheaper."
"Notes: While this isn't my favorite pale ale, I do enjoy and recommend it."
"D - Clean flavors and a great feel lend to high drinkability on this one. Could make for a very nice session brew. I will definitely revisit this one again."
"Drinkability - A good but average example of the craft Pale Ale style."
"Poured from a cellar-temperature bottle into a standard pint glass. Beer pours a clear golden amber, with lots of tiny bubbles and a big, rich, off-white head. Bubbles in the head are a variety of sizes, and it leaves lots of lace on the glass. Aroma is mild and malty, with traces of yeast and hop. The flavor is big on malt, with a dry hop bitterness taking over toward the end. There are other flavors lending complexity to the brew, but I can't quite identify what I'm tasting - I just know it's good. Carbonation is present but not overly so, keeping the flavors moving but not making the beer feel too crisp or thin, and there is a good amount of malty body to this beer. This is a hearty pale, very drinkable - interesting enough to keep me drinking, but not so interesting that I'm getting a flavor burnout."
"D - Drinks fine. Nice dry finish. All in all nothing terribly special about this one."
"A very drinkable offering from Great Divide, and thus, a good session beer."
"Pretty damn drinkable. Not very bitter, but has a solid flavor and mouthfeel that makes drinking a couple of these no gargantuan feat. A good beer."
"D: I would say many of these could go down but it might get boring. A solid one, two of malt and hops in its style."
"Drinkability - Goes down really smooth and shows just how easy it is to down a sixer of this stuff. Will continue shopping from Great Divide as I would be interested in trying an IPA from them."
"Overall: Smooth drinking, lip-licking beer that perhaps is stronger overall than its idividual aspects.... the taste is clean, clear, and pleasant--as versatile a paleas I've had ina while, besting the Stoudt's offering..."
"Pours amber orange color, dense frorthy head, good retention and lacing. Smell is composed of piney and grapefruit hops blended with nicely roasted carmel and pale malts. Taste is slightly more mild than scent dictates, but follows the same patern of piney and grapefruit hops up front with a nice carmel and pale malt background. Medium bodied, slightly oily and chewy. Good beer, could use some slight cleanign up to make it one of the better in its style."
"Not a beer I really enjoy sipping on its own, but a good companion to salty fried foods and in my limited experience with the English Pale Ales, a solid representation of the style."
"D - Very quaffable as I find my self taking small sips rapidly one right after another... Another all around solid offering from Great Divide... Definately English in nature..."
"D - This beer, along with Firestone Walker's Double Barrel Ale does not get enough recognition because the hops do not rip your face off, but this was a good drink"
"A very nice English pale ale! Great Divide brews great beers and DPA is well crafted example. While not my favorite style (I prefer APAs) I would be very happy drinking this whenever it was available!"
"Lots of drinkability here!"
"Drinkability - this ale goes down really smoothly and the hops won't taint your palette like other Pales. Having just returned from the UK a couple of months ago, I would've loved to have enjoyed this in the pubs."
"Medium-light body. Appropriate carbonation. Somewhat creamy texture. A very easy drinker, though not a contemplative one. Not a bad beer, but sort of disappointing compared to Great Divide's other quality brews."
"It is a bit heavy feeling on the mouth but is a good beer."
"Overall this beer is average. Not exactly what I'd expect from a brewery like Great Divide. Unoffensive at least, which I guess is what some people are looking for."
"Great pale ale!"
"D: I could certainly revisit this beer. A nice example of the style, although this may not have the malt-dominating characteristics that I love in my EPAs. Certainly sessionable, too."
"I was hoping for a bit more, but I can also tell this is not the freshest sample. I would like to try this brew again at some point."
"Denver Pale Ale is a wonderful, if unattractive, hot day or post workout ale."
"This is a wonderful Pale Ale. I really enjoy toasty malt flavors in pales and this one has it goin for it. Great biscuity flavor backed by a great earthy hop presence. I think this is a extremely high quality Pale Ale and would recommend it time and again."
"Overall this is one of the better EPA's that I've tasted. Granted it's a slightly Americanized version, but it's good nonetheless. Worth a shot."
"d - highly drinkable. this is what an EPA should be and is an incredible session beer."
"Drinkability: One of my all-time favorite English Pale Ales, for sure."
"From Bottle August 8, 2009. Pours mostly clear amber with small white head. Great hop aroma and a very well balanced English Pale Ale. I just found this beer pleasantly enjoyable, even more than their Titan IPA. Very crisp, and it definitely hit the spot on a warm summer evening - cheers!"
"Pours a clear golden orange/amber color with a two-three finger head that retains pretty well and leaves light-medium lacing as I drink the beer. Lots of rising carbonation in the glass, a very good looking beer. Smells of malt presence and citrus hops, kind of strange considering the taste. Tastes of hops, but I pick up more piney/woody hops up in the taste with only a bit of citrus. First few sips had large malt presence but as the glass emptied the hops picked up and it started tasting more like an IPA. Malt was heavy in the aftertaste, turned into a well balanced hop/malt beer. Mouthfeel is light-medium, coats the mouth well and has a bit of cream to it, medium carbonation, good mouthfeel. Drinkability is about as high as it gets here, could probably session the hell out of this since it has a good taste and its not filling at all, will probably buy this again and consume the whole six pack in one night."
"Drinkability- 3 to 5 wouldn't be a struggle at all to drink. Especially with food and a decently warm day."
"This beer may not be nearly as good on tap normally or from a bottle, but from the firkin, it is excellent and extremely drinkable. I could drink it all day long. So good."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a light amber, with a 2 finger half bubble/half foam head. Aroma was clean, reminded me of fresh laundry, a small amount of citrusy floral was evident. Taste was hoppy, a bit of bitterness after sipping. A bit of milky sweetness kept it pleasant. Overly tingly on the tounge, and a bit watery in the mouth. Kept drinking it faster than I expected, can't place why."
"This is a nice brew, clean and balanced."
"This is the first beer I have tried from Great Divide. The color is a dark pale orange with a decent head. It has a rich hoppy smell, but the taste is more subtle with a light copperish hop flavor and there is only a mild bitterness. This is certainly an easy drinking beer and one of the better pale ales I've tasted."
"D: Very drinkable pale ale with good flavor and balance."
"It is nicely balanced in an ""American"" way. It says on the bottle ""English-style", and it is in the way of the tea-like spicing, but more of an American Pale with a nod words the traditional English. Anyway, it is a flavorful, balanced brew."
"D- Great session beer. Could sit around with some friends and enjoy this guy all night."
"Overall, it went down easy. This is not a beer with sugary elements. You know you are drinking an adult beverage. It is a nice change compared to alot of knock-offs or one-trick (flavor-dominant) ponies out there. Worth the try."
"This pale ale has great drinkability with a balanced palate, low abv, and traditional flavors."
"Drinkability: I could have two or three. This is slightly above average for the style. I love the taste of tea that I get. I could see myself wanting this inearly spring or late fall."
"I love great divide, and will try anything of theirs once. My buddy warned against this one though. Shoulda listened. The belgian ipa they just came out with had this weird, pungeant flavor and smell that I cant' put my finger on. Absolutely hated it. This beer has a little bit of the same thing. I really dont' like that taste and smell. It might be a hop bitterness that I dont' like. I'd have to study the recipe to know for sure. The mouthfeel was pretty good, but nothing makes up for the way this beer tastes and smells. Not one I'll ever try again. I'll drink yheti and the other line by the gallon though!"
"Drinks pretty well and is refreshing in the hot weather."
"This beer pours a hazy bronze color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes rather quickly into nice lacing. The aroma is very floral, with strong herbal notes, and a nice caramel malt undertone. The taste is just as vibrant as the aroma. The floral and herbal hops are strong without being overly bitter. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is a very pleasant surprise. I will certainly drink this again."
"D- quite a drinkable brew, esp. on a warm spring day, not the best english pale i've had, but certainly in the top 10..."
"This is a good beer. Nothing else really to say about it. I just think it needed a bit more hop flavor and bitterness to combat the earth-like malt flavors that dominate the finish. Worth a try."
"Excellent, simple pale ale. Bright golden liquid topped by a decent head. The aroma is balanced between light malt and floral hops. Nothing overwhelms. The flavor is clean and crisp even at a fairly warm temperature. DPA is the picture of balance, as a pale ale should be. The hops and malt flavors work very well together. The beer would garner an even higher score if the end product was a bit more interesting. As is, it's still very good, just not earth-shattering but perhaps that was the goal."
"D: A very good English pale ale with a bit more floral and spicy hops to give this beer a nice flavor to match the excellent feel and drinkability."
"Very dry, almost astringent, flavor which I think is the source of the earthiness. I like the hop content; it is both bittering and spicy. Predictable body."
"medium body, smooth with light resins in the finish. lively, sometimes prickly, moderate carbonation can also be fluffy."
"The taste I thought I forgot is one of the first Base Ale I had. Something very new, unexpected and delicious. This ale is not new for me flavor wise, but it was unexpected and reminded me very much of my first experience with Base which is a fond one."
"D: nice Pale Ale. I find it to be different than many Pale Ales. Down any road, it is tasty! This is a hearty Pale Ale"
"Denver Pale Ale is more London than Los Angeles. I'll give it that. Generally speaking, English Pales pale in comparison to their American colleagues. No pun intended. This one has a pretty good flavor, but seems a little short on hops, even for an English Pale. It's not a bad beer and is more than decent for the style. But, it'd benefit from a nice infusion of hops nonetheless. Very much worth a try in any event."
"D - I would like to review this beer more thoroughly sometime, but it's going to be a while until I'm back in Denver. The thick body and hop flavor make it difficult to drink more than a few of these in a given sitting. A solid pale ale, but nothing special and certainly not something I would make the trek for..."
"drinkability: a slow drinking pale ale for the summer. Great sessionabilty"
"D: Not bad. Would have liked to pick up more from the malts. Hops were present, just wanted a better flavor from them. A decent pale ale, and I would drink again if offered."
"Overall: Excellent beer. I was not expecting it to distinguish itself like it did. I will be purchasing this again!"
"Morey's Bottom Line: A pretty good Pale, but I tend to like mine a little hoppier. Would be a superb choice to introduce Macro-swillin' friends to the world of craft beer."
"Mouthfeel is substantial and dry. Good beer all around."
"(as a side note, this beer is classified as an English PA, but aside from it being slightly maltier than other APA's on the market, it has more characteristics of an American PA than an English one)"
"Great beer, even better on cask."
"D) Everyday DPA! I realize that my rating will be above the norm, but this was a delicious pale ale. Well crafted."
"Beer is a simple, good tasting, sessionable beer. Nothing really special but overall i think EPA's are meant to be that way"
"M: medium bodied. Mild carbonation level, leading to a nice smoothness that accompanies the balance of the taste. Good mouthfeel overall."
"Although I am more inclined towards IPA and American Pale Ales, this is a nice representation of an English style pale ale. Probably not my favorite Great Divide, but not bad overall."
"An orange-gold honey-hued beer with a big, rocky, sticky off-white head. Hazy body. Smells of toffee and biscuitlike malts -- very English. But the taste was much more reminiscent of a West Coast APA -- bitter hop presence with an overall dry presentation. The bready, biscuity notes in the nose were almost completely hidden form the palate. Definitely more bitter than an English Pale Ale. Medium-bodied and refreshing -- went down easily. The drinkability is the best feature. Won't go out of my way for another one, but basically solid."
"Drinkability: It's drinkable, but I just don't like it that much."
"Pours an amber-reddish colored body, with a big foamy creamy white colored head. Big bubbles, and good lacing. Malty hoppy aroma, sweet & fresh. Some odd taste, like sour or almost dirty-diaperish. Fresh taste, dry, kinda watery. Dusty almost. Warmin up, milder, not as bitter."
"Overall I'm really impressed with this beer after it has had some time to sit."
"Not stellar but a solid offering from Great Divide. For a brewery that make so many really hoppy beers, undertaking an English-style ale should be commended. I'd be happy to order this out at a bar, but I doubt I'd bring a six pack home."
"On tap at Baker's Street Grill and Bar. Poured light gold with almost no head, what was there was light, white and fast to disappear. Smelled slightly malty and hoppy but mostly crisp and clean. Taste was clean, hoppy with malt aftertastes and slightly watery. Watery in a good way, a sort of refreshing finish. Overall, I enjoyed it, I thought it was a solid pale ale. I would say I was most likely drinking it in the wrong season, but would be more than happy to share a six pack in the sun over the summer."
"A very drinkable APA. Almost as good as Sierra Nevada"
"again the two hundred and fifty character limit rears its ugly head"
"Very drinkable."
"This beer poured a burnt organge amber color with slightly rocky head that fills the pint glass. Decent lacing throughout. The nose had some caramel and toasty bready aroma with a hint of herbal hops. The flavor was of a thin caramel and toasty malt that gave way to a thin hop and citrus. Floral hop aftertaste subsides. The mixture towards the end actually gives an almost soapy taste to the beer. At first I thought this was due to the glass used - but tried another glass, and then simply to drink it right out of the bottle. Moderately light body with decent carbonation. It goes down easy, but I have had better of this style."
"Drink: Balance, clean, bitter, pretty drinkable in my book."
"Not much going on with this one to make you want to drink many. There is simply very little taste or complexity. I would stick with the Titan IPA."
"D- Smooth characteristics and a great balance of flavors make for a superior EPA"
"Thick, buttery malt balaced by a heavy herbal hop thump. Thick mouthfeel compliments this dense beer. Dry peppery aftertaste and low carbonation. A very traditional and well done English Pale Ale."
"D-Pretty drinkable brew. Good flavor overall for the style. I'd recommend getting your hands on a bottle or three."
"The aroma of this ale was unremarkable to me, but I found the color and aggressive head quite a visual treat, especially as it ambushed the glass and flowed out onto the counter. It was smooth and clean and its finish was crisp and solid. This is a beer that is very easy to drink."
"Pours a clear golden color. 3/4 inch head with good retention and decent lacing. Smells of hops, nuts, and earthy malt. Smooth and crisp mouth feel with low carbonation levels. Fits the style of an English Pale Ale. Tastes of hops up front mostly and then the nutty flavor comes through. The earthy malt is strongest in the aftertaste. No component is too overpowering, a good blend. I'm even detecting a slight sweetness, that also is not too strong. Overall, a good beer and worth a try."
"Mouthfeel is good, but pretty average for this style. I could definitely get in trouble with this beer."
"Heavy duty carbonation pushes the head beyond three fingers, rich and slow to dissolve, moderate amber color, not so translucent as to hide the bubbles flowing throughout. Pleasingly airy nose of flower blossoms, orange zest, the light fruitiness accompanied by a curious edge of plastic aprons like grandma in the 1950's, hops edge out the malts, some breadiness. In the mouth it's medium-bodied and smoothly polished, the carbonation fairly high and adds spring to its step. More biscuit, bread and borderline butteriness here, the white citrus relaxed, same for the fruit tones. The hoppiness swells in the mid-palate and lets the malts smooth things out through the finish. Admirable balance and drinkability."
"Kind of a hopped up Great Lakes Burning River or Captain Lawrence Freshchester Pale. A little off for the style but if you enjoy hops you'll enjoy this. Not my favorite, but worth trying."
"D- Very good, maybe a bit too hoppy for a pale ale. on the verge of being an IPA, but still tasty, none the less."
"April 2013, revisted in Denver. Great tasting beer with my steak dinner."
"D: Pretty nondescript, but a nice beer overall. I still have a couple more of these left and look forward to drinking them."
"7/4/8/4/15 (3.8/5)"
"I like this brew. Nice representation of the EPA. Recommend."
"D - mild and highly drinkable"
"This came from a Great Divide variety case. Really? An English pale ale? I guess I can see it, but the level of hops was more in line with that of an American Pale Ale. The hops were relatively big and upfront with grassy citrus flavors and aromas. The malts, on the other hand, are hard to pick out behind the hops and only give off a bit of mellow biscuit. So overall, this was a tasty and sessionable pale ale, but I'd have liked a more balanced flavor before I call it a great beer."
"This beer is so damn drinkable it's scary. I bought a Great Divide mixed 12 and it was one of the best mix packs I have bought. This one was so crisp, clean, and refreshing. One of my favorite styles and this one lived up to it very well. I will be unting for this guy in the future."
"Full mouthfeel and easy drinkability make this a very nice beer to drink. Much better than I expected."
"Very cloudy, bright yellow, darkens toward honey-golden at the top of the glass. Rich aroma has strong overtone of orange. Flavor is somewhat wheaty and has a strong orange component and some hop hints. This tastes more like a wheat beer than a pale ale. Texture is smooth and pleasing."
"Mouthfeel is good and drinkability is strong but the roasted flavors might make me stop after two."
"A really nice session Pale Ale. It really rides theline between American Pale Ale/IPA and English Pale ale. The big American hops play really well with the big British malt background. A really nice and very drinkable beer."
"Very well done, Great Divide, one of my very favorite breweries."
"Pours all head and I'm not sure why? This has been in by beer fridge for over a month stored upright and at around 50 degrees. I poped the cap and got distracted,and by the time I came back this thing looked like one of those snake sparklers that just keeps growing and growing. When I poured out an ounce or two of beer I got like six fingers worth of head,I'm baffled. After ten miniutes or so I finaly got to take a sip and it was worth the wait. This brew smells sweet with ripe bananas and grassy hops in abundance. The flavors are nicely balanced with some lightly toasted malts and good amount of hoppage. It seems to lose it's carbonation at a rapid pace,but the body overall was a bit fuller than expected(a nice suprise),left a little residual sticky coating behind. Pretty nice Pale Ale that is far better than average."
"I had a finger's worth of off-white head initially, but it quickly fell away to wisps. The color was a really deep copper with NE-quality clarity. The nose had a grainy maltiness to it underlain by a mild bitterness. The mouthfeel was medium with a pleasantly light hoppiness on the tongue. The finish gave a nice commingling of hoppy and malty with the malt sweetness lingering well after the swallow. A really nice beer and one that could be a session candidate."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass. Pours a copper color with a lot of lacing and a head that does not go away throughout the entire beer. Hoppy, slightly fruity nose. Taste starts relatively sweet with a bit of citrus and finishes bitter and dry. Mouthfeel is watered down...I'm not too crazy about that. A very drinkable pale ale on a hot summer day."
"A solid Pale Ale that you can drink just about anytime. Copper colored topped with just a thin head. Aroma is slightly floral and hoppy albeit somewhat faint. There's a nice amount of flavor for a Pale Ale. Sweet and hoppy turning bitter to a dry bitter finish. Mouthfeel leaves me wanting a little more though. An above average beer but nothing special."
"D: Definitely drinkable, I was pleasantly surprised by this beer. I really need to try some other Great Divide brews."
"The colour and smell are both really average and easily forgetable, but the taste and drinkability are wonderful. Colour is a medium orange with a snow white head that, even with an aggresive pour, doesn't stick around very long. Smell is sweet hops with a good measure of malt, too, indicating a well balanced brew. At least in the smell, anyway. Taste is fantastic in that the hops, while present, are rather modest. There is no doubt that this has your stereotypical West-Coast style hops, but it just isn't so over the top or ""in-your-face"" like so many others. Low to medium intensity malt up front, bitter hops in the middle and on the finish, then malt again a few seconds after you've swallowed. Nice flavour, very easy to drink; a definite favourite of mine. I like Stone's Pale Ale for the same reason as this in that it's not so assertive."
"D: Good session beer, not too pricey, I'll enjoy the rest of this six pack."
"D: Overall this is a drinkable beer. I'm not huge on pale ales, but Great Divide is an excellent brewery so I thought I'd give it a shot. This one's OK. The taste isn't quite as complex or vibrant as I would've liked. Still, a decent beer."
"Poured a deep golden color. Small dirty white head. Nose is sweet, hop aroma is light and flowery. Very malty, plenty of English malts and even some fruitiness. Strong hop flavor, but low bitterness. Almost oily the amount of hops they put in. Good body and almost sweet malt, but finishes dry with a light bitterness aftertaste. Good attempt at a English Pale."
"Rich malt up front takes a back seat to citrus hops thereafter. The oil and butter tones remain from the smell. There is a bit of metal in the aftertaste but it isn't a major complaint. The texture is balanced and accents the taste well. This is a quality drinking ale with nice hop character. I would definitely try this again, especially on tap."
"I'm not too familiar with the English Pale Ale style, but this brew was excellent. I'm really looking forward to trying more varieties of both this beer and brews from this company (Great Divide Brewing Co.). I need to try it in a bottle for the sake of comparison, but it's excellent on tap/draught."
"This is a nice pale ale, and one that accomplishes all intended flavors with a slightly jacked up hop presence. Not so much to warrant it an IPA, but it's noticeable."
"D - Very smooth, pleasant and easy to drink."
"D: Quite drinkable. Perhaps a tad heavier in body than I prefer my APAs/EPAs, but it's yet another well-crafted beer from Great Divide. Damn shame I can't get this stuff in Alabama."
"D - This would be a pretty nice session beer: really do enjoy the nice bitter hop aftertaste. Light body helps me to easily drink this ale."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a slightly hazy, golden-orange color with a one-finger, pillowy head. The nose is of slightly toasted malt, slightly biscuity and a nice bouquet of earthy English hops. The taste has a constant and consistant bitterness throughout. There is a nice malty backdrop that complements the moderate hop forefront. Sort of one-demensional but it works for this beer. The mouthfeel is fairly light in body with a underwhelming carbonation and a dry finish. Overall drinkability is pretty good, this is a sessionable beer for sure. Nothing out of this world but a solid offering."
"Excellent drinkability once the foam dies down."
"There is a nice floral hop to the beer and a bit of malts on the nose. The beer is a bit more malty than I'd expect with a pale ale, but it works fairly well. The bitterness and slightly roasted malts are quite tasty. Caramel and other sweetness are there as well, making the beer quite balanced. The mouth feel is carbonated, but a bit watery. The beer is quite drinkable because of the balance."
"Drinkability: The beer's other strong point. It's very pleasant to drink, and doesn't overpower you in any aspect; it would definitely make a good session beer."
"It was chewy and I found it to be a good session beer."
"O/ M - Great balance and flavor of malts and hop bitterness. Light to med mouthfeel. Great session beer."
"Body medium, slick, and quaffable. A nice, well-hopped session brew."
"D: Pretty drinkable because of the almost watery nature. Flavors are full but nothing too amazing. Decent beer."
"This is an amber brown color with a fizzy tan head. The nose has a nice floral hop presence followed by mild malts. The taste has fruity cirtus hops up front and finishes with somewhat sweet grainy malts. Medium bodied with crisp carbonation. Another good drinker from Great Divide."
"This is a very sessionable pale ale from Great Divide. Nothing fancy, but not every beer needs to be."
"Overall. I was quite pleased with this one. It is not a stand out as far as PA's go, but it is definitely good. I would drink it again, and probably will soon."
"This pale ale pours a lighter shade of amber. A thick white head adorns the liquid and leaves some lacing. Moderate carbonation. Smell is mostly a citrusy hop note with some floral notes. Sweet. Taste is mostly floral hops with a fairly strong malt temper. Finishes with just a hint of bitterness, definitely not up to what I crave in a pale. Mouthfeel was a little too bready and not cleansed by the hop aspects. When in the mood for a malty offering, I'm sure I would appreciate this beer more."
"A good try at an English Pale Ale, but not the best of the style. Not bad, and is worth a try, but there are better versions out there."
"D - Great session beer, you wouldn't find me turning this one down. A great find for the price as well. Recommended."
"12 ouncer, with ""month and week bottled"" info notched onto the label. Pours fairly dull, typical almond amber. Clear. Creamy tan head, showing decent retention and then leaves ample spotty lacing. Dull malty nose. This one is Brit style all the way, malt/hop, sweet/bitter balance, sessionable, easy drinker. Pleasant and nicely crafted offering."
"D: Great Divide's great reputation kind of leaves me wanting more... its good, but not quite at the level of some of their other brews and the best in this category..."
"Recommended..."
"The body is mid but to style. A bit watery at the end but still brings enough sweetness and flavor through to be considered a good beer. Nice sessional beer."
"In the mood for a good session beer, I grabbed a sixer of these since I've pretty much tried all the other local Great Divide offerings. Looking for no frills, just some straight-forward drinking. I don't think there's anything wrong with that. A two-finger, slightly off-white head sits atop a pale golden brew. Retention is excellent. When it finally fades a consistent lacing is left surrounding the glass all the way to the top. There's not much going on aromatically speaking. Malt, esthers, a slight lemony zest, and almost no hops. Taste is a bit more robust with the hops floating between the malts, grass and oranges. Carbonation isn't bad, with fairly good activity after each drink. Mouth-feel is a bit dry. All in all this brew has a pretty good drinkability to taste ratio, and happens to fulfill the qualities I was originally looking for. It doesn't knock the ball out of the park, but it will get a good single or double if you're looking to get a man on base until the big hitter comes up to bat."
"Light amber color with a small short lived head. Mild hop aroma with a milder sweetness too. Decent hop flavor, mildly bittered, and a thin body. I found this quite boring, and have had many better pales. Not seeing this is an EPA, I understand... I always find those blander, and more boring. Simple, but decent pale."
"drinkability was very fine, I am not usually a big fan of these type beers, but this one is well crafted and might start makin me look for more like this, I wish now I had bought the whole 6-pack..damn....good stuff!"
"has a more lagerish type look to it than a normal pale ale, but still has a good color and head retention. the smell is very ale like though, biscuity malt flavor dominates the nose while there is a hint of hop bitterness. taste is matly at first and finishes with a hoppy bitterness just like the aroma. good beer, too bad i only got one of these in a mix a six."
"D - really good; this would be my session if I lived in Colorado. Glad to see Great Divide can brew normal beers as well. Pick it up if you can, you can easily rock several of these in a session and have a nice night"
"BLUF-this is a great session beer that is well balanced. I will seek out again."
"I was always afraid of the DPA thinking that it was an unusual style. Instead, it reminds me of an English mild like FFF Pride and Joy. Good choice."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into a Smokestack Goblet. Poured a slightly hazy straw with a inch head that disappeared quickly and left a nice lacing. Aroma is of sweet malts with a little citrusy hops that sneak in. Taste is much the same, finishes with a grape fruitesque twang. Mouthfeel is medium with a nice carbonation. A decent brew put out by a great brewery."
"hmm. I don't know what to make of this beer. I know I've had it before and enjoyed it, but this one isn't sitting well with me. It wasn't last night either, but I thought my palate was off. Tonight is the same thing. I don't know if the bad aftertaste is just from the hops they use, if the hops are stale or if it's just an off flavor. Can't quite tale. maybe give it a go if you get a chance. I may run down to the brewery soon and give this another go."
"The DPA pours a hazy golden color with a nice finger head and awesome sudsy lacing. The aroma is biscuity malt. The flavor starts malty and has some hoppiness in the finish. In the mouth the bitterness is apparent all over. I think it is true to the style and a worthy beer."
"I like this beer alot. This might have taken over as my favorite pale ale. It pours a nice copper amber color from the bottle with a thick yet light feeling light copper head. The aroma is of fresh malts and hops blended together with a hint of sweet flowery scent from the hops themselves. The taste is lives up to the aroma. Beautifully blended malts and hops with some bitterness, but not too bitter mixed in with a hint of sweetness. The aftertaste is very mild with a sweet and fruity aftertaste. But mainly it was smooth. Very smooth. The mouthfeel is exceptional and it is a very drinkable beer in my book. Try this if you get a chance."
"D-I could session this but being a hophaed I would long for more hops."
"D = Pretty good. I would not turn this down, but will probably not buy any more bottles. Might try on tap next time I'm in Denver though."
"A little over carbonated."
"Tastes weedy hops. Gentle citrus and chalky. Oxidized. Stale cheesy hops with some tettnagner gritty. Sweet is presnet but way underneath the hops. Not so good, IMO. Light body and moderate carbonation."
"Pours light amber with little head or lacing. Smell is dry malt, a light fruitiness, and a touch of metal. Light hoppiness on the finish. The taste is primarily malty as well up front but with some light citrusy hops through the midpalate, but this drops off somewhat quickly. Crisp mouthfeel. Fairly refreshing."
"D: Not my first choice and certainly not my last in terms of pale ales, but this one seems pretty one dimensional."
"Now I really do not believe this one was never tried by me, but there are actually still a couple Great Divides I need to get my hands on. This one was going to go down on tap though so that will make it even sweeter. Poured very nice hazy yellowish tinted amber with a more then ample two inch plus foamy and sticky head on top. This faded reluctantly down to just a small thin film across the top and that pretty much stayed the entire time. Now there was a good amount of side glass lace present here and this had a really nice effect of the look of this. I know it was a pale ale, but it was really starting to look like an IPA. Smell was very hopped, but also nice and light. Very nice blend of floral hops and light grassy grains. The flavor was very similar to this as well. A very nice hopped up front greeted you right away and was quickly followed up by the nice and almost a touch of sweet grain like back to it. Long drawn out dry finish left a really nice taste and follow through. The feel was great. Lots of carbonation really helping to push it along and lighten it up nicely. Absolutely great session ale, something that could have gone on and on and it would have been no worry to me at all. I really liked this one overall; I thought it was a fine example of a big hopped west coast pale ale. Something that was light enough to get let you put down a couple, while at the same time, really had a nice touch of floral, bitter hops to it. I would definitely recommend this one and will have to go pick some up; this could become a staple of the house very easily. Just seemed like the perfect session ale."
"This is a typical pale ale. It's nothing to write home about, but it's still good. It's definetly worth a try and it would make a decent session."
"Pours a hazy golden brown color with a smallish white head that dissipated fairly quick. The smell is rather faint, I pick up some light citrus hops. The taste is of piney, resin hops that is quickly balanced from a sweet graham cracker like malt base. The feel is fairly light and fizzy, and finishes well balanced. A very drinkable brew that has some good flavor and good balance between the hops and malt. Easily a beer you can drink quite a few in a night."
"A nice contrast between the American and English styles. The floral aroma is more like the hoppier APA, style, but it has a nice, well-balanced taste like an English Pale Ale. Just a very good, very drinkable beer that should be a hit with any Pale Ale aficianado."
"For me, this is truly an exceptional brew."
"Beer poured a copper color with a strong white head that is sustaining quite well. Nose is slightly malty but otherwise non-descrept. Taste is good, starts off malty and finishes balanced nicely by an apple/citrus hop. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, surprising for an epa. Drinkability is very good. Once again I have found another very good Great Divide brew. This is not a huge beer by any stretch but is worth seeking out for epa fans."
"D- a solid english pale ale"
"D: This is a filling beer that doesn't satisfy your beer jones. In my experience, it drinks best ice-cold, straight from the bottle."
"Pours a clear sunny amber color with a one-finger white head that settles into a spotty cap. Sticky lacing like a Victorian tablecloth. Aroma is malty with citrus hops and slightly fruity scents. Taste is Earthy maltiness balanced with nice hop bitterness. Medium bodied. Hop flavor stays in the mouth. Overall this is a tasty and easy drinking beer."
"I think Great Divide has the worst looking bottles. They should let me redesign them. That is really the only compalint with this beer. I see that it is listed as an english pale ale but i belive it to be much closer to the American version. I can't be certain which type of hops they use but I would guess cascade or something similar. Pours a clear gold color with a decent head. Nice aroma with citrus hop and malt balance. Taste is equal to smell very nice. The balancing act is perfect. I don't think you can find a better mouthfeel in a beer."
"Pours a slightly hazy pale orange with a quickly diminishing head. The aroma is some light caramel malts and weak citrus hops. The taste is a decent balance with citrus hops just slightly overpowering the sweet malts. The beer is slightly high in carbonation, but is still refreshing. This is a somewhat enjoyable beer, but there are many other Pales that are much better including several from my home state, so I'll probably stick with them when I want a pale."
"As soon as I saw that this is an English Pale Ale, I realized why it was unique from other Pale Ale's. It's unique in a good way and can be a good change from American Pale Ale's. It reminds me of Ipswichs' Original Ale, which is also an EPA, and has a nice spicy bite to it. The traditional Pale Ale color w/ a frothy head. The smell was spicy and malty with a hint of hops. It seems to have the taste that would fit colder weather too, so it's a great year-round beer. Strong flavors which linger in your mouth but at the same time, a very refreshing beer and even better on tap. I let it sit too long at one point and now I'm drinking it piss-warm and it still has great flavor. Gotta love Great Divide."
"This is my second Great Divide beer in as many days and I'm impressed with both. Color is a clear, light copper. off white head that draws down quickly to a film. Lightly fruity in the smell, which given the hops in the taste was surprising. taste brings lots of pine and florals to the mix with malty sweetness (caramel and grains) balancing out. Medium body, not to full of carbo. (Thankfully, I didn't;t have the exploding fountain effect like an earlier reviewer.) The hoppy twist gives this some solid drinkability."
"very hoppy and bitter ore than fruity, great overall taste."
"Final Note: Good Beer!"
"Notes: In my opinion this does taste a bit more like an English Pale Ale (as the bottle describes it) than an American Pale. . . . As noted above, this is the 3rd or 4th bottle from that GD 12-pack that just exploded out of the bottle. I even let this one sit on the kitchen counter for about 15 minutes before cracking it open, and still it was all head. I hope this doesn't happen regularly with GD beers, but my experience with this 12-pack hasn't been all that promising. . . ."
"A nice change from the every day domestic beer. It has a good strong taste but with no bitter aftertaste.It also packs a little more punch than your average beer.This would be one of my top choices if I go to a bar that sells microbrews.I recommend trying this ...nothing negative to say."
"Ah, after all the hop bombs I've tried in the past few months, it's great to have something a tad more low key and drinkable. Pours a nice medium copper with a nice head that sticks around. Aroma is grassy with biscuity malts, not hoppy at all. Taste is very well balanced with a slight hint of malt chocolate in there. Taste is refreshing, with a nice dry bitter aftertaste. This would be a great session beer, it reminds me of some old English ales I have had in the past. Good stuff."
"D: Overall not impressed with this one. It seemed very unbalanced and the finish left a lot more to be desired. I would say pass on this beer"
"On tap at the Great Divide tap room. This was orange-red in color with a good white head that hung around for the duration of the beer. The taste was malty and hops seemed to be missing in action. This seemed like a decent pale ale but I prefer American style. I think this oen is a GABF gold medal winner but it just didn't wow me. The only beer that I have been unimpressed by from Great Divide. Even the raspberry beer made me lift my eyebrows."
"A good pale ale. Definitely not as hoppy as the IPA or double IPA. Would be a nice transition for those drinking amber ales to try something different. Easily drinkable, would work well as a session beer. Not my favorite of Great Divide's offerings, but I would still order it if choices were limited."
"Good job. B+"
"Tastes very good. Smooth, sweet malty taste with a hint of caramel. Very crisp mouthfeel and more than rich enough for this style. This is a highly drinkable beer. Would be a great session beer and is good with food also."
"D - Is pretty good with this beer, tastes alright. Very mild beer."
"Drinkability: It's okay!"
"D: Very true to style but, with a hint of America :) I am a fan of this beer and will definitely pick it up again. Knock .5% off and I could drink this all night, great session beer or intro to real beer for your BMC friends."
"D- This beer has a smooth malt flavor with a nice pine hops are complimented by the malts."
"Nice grainy flavor, just like Titan, but a slight bit less intense. Similar beer, just not quite as loaded with flavor. Nice, nice, session brew, with some kick. Nice craggy head and beautiful lacing down the glass. Nose of piney hops and oatey grains. Satisfying beer and highly recommended."
"Denver pale ale poured into an ipa glass, pours an rustic amer color with fluffy head that leaves a nice bit of leace on the glass. Smell is bitter sweet with floral a floral hop smell. taste is a bit chewy with roasted malt body with a bit of hop bitterness towards the end and aftertaste. Very refreshing and good I would drink this often if given the opportunity."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours an orangish amber color with a white head that shows a decent amount of lace. The aroma consists of malt, caramel and some citrusy hops. The taste was some caramel malt flavors and a dry and bitter finish. Overall, this is a pretty decent brew that is worth trying."
"Overall: The label states that this beer is a winner of various awards for English Style pale ale, and it presents as such, though with a bit more assertive hops character. A good hoppy English Pale; worth a try."
"Mouthfeel is a little sticky, even more when the beer warms. Drinkability is very good, especially because of the superb balance this beer has. I like it!"
"D - Excellent ale with pleasing hop bitterness and residual sugars. A balanced a quaffable ale that could use a pinch more effervescence to be great."
"D: Very tasty, goes down easily, not very filling, good representation of style, it’s well-worth sticking with for an evening and one of the best English Pale Ales I’ve had."
"A little more bitter than my tastes usually prefer, certainly for an English style pale ale anyway, but nothing about it is undrinkable. A tasty brew."
"Drinkibilty - Oh, you could go through quite a few of these in a short time."
"Amber brew pours about a finger in a pint, head retention won't win prizes but the lacing is quite lush. The nose is sweet with malt and some aromatic floral notes. The tasting is also dominated by the malt - somewhat sweet with good carbonation, and some ester flavors..some spice, some spring flower. Finishes with a very lightly toasted biscuity taste and faint bitterness. Good thick mouthfeel in the pale ale category. This could be called a copper or amber ale to avoid competing with hop-laden demi-IPAs but carves out a good niche for itself as a malt-driven pale ale."
"Flavor is straight forward and simple. Not complex in the least--and that's not a bad thing. Great beer for those nights when I don't want to be inundated with crazy amount of hops, malts or unique flavors. I am even picking out some wood-like tannins. Medium body that I find tends to improve or regress depending on the age of the beer."
"Color of the body is amber and the head was white but it falls fast.Smell is of malt and taste is malt and some hop.Taste is actually good and I didnt think I was a fan of english ipa's but its g ood.This would be a good session beer and is easy on the palate and goes down easy and.The mouthful is light and is between thick and thin.I liked it quite a bit and would have again for sure."
"GD has much better beer than this. Not the best pale ale."
"D: This is often my go to beer when drinking with friends. Despite its lack of hop/malt balance this beer is good and I enjoy drinking it regularly."
"Nice English PA, one that would be very good this summer"
"Slightly citrus smell with a strong lace around the glass...a mid-range taste...hoppy but with a citrus background...a middle of the road Pale Ale...I gave it an extra .5 for drinkability becuase it was smooth enough to be a session beer."
"D - Nothing really bad to say about this beer. Better and average, but not extremely outstanding."
"This may be the best pale ale I've ever had. Its simple and fresh tasting and eminently drinkable. I could enjoy another immediately. Great Divide knocked this one out of the park in my opinion. Try it!"
"This is a drinkable APA from Great Divide. Pretty straight forward characteristics with a nice aroma and taste."
"D- sessionable, tons of flavor and an easy drinker, this is one heck of a brew, must try"
"D - The beer has a very good taste but the heavy carbonation almost ruins it. I would probably try this again, hoping that my next batch wouldn't have as much carbonation as the one I had."
"Pours a dark amber, almost brown with a light tan head. It leaves some lacing. Aroma is floral and earthy hops, maltiness in the background. Finish is very bitter. Hops dominate the flavor. Medium bodied. This is a good one, this would be a good session beer."
"A fine example of an American English-style pale ale. Recommended."
"Got in a trade with jhammerly. Pours a clear golden/orange color, nice carbonation, nice creamy tan head, nice sticky lacing afterwards. Scents of slight malts, hops, spices, and some caramel. The taste is sweet malts and hoppy, nice caramel/hop bite in the finish. Medium body, well rounded brew. Drinkable, another nice GD brew, would recommend."
"Overall a good drinkable pale ale. A decent rendition of the English style."
"Ive been completely impressed by Great Divide. I cant wait to taste their other offerings."
"Overall- A delicious Pale Ale. A session beer, must!!"
"Pours a clear copper color with a giant white/tan frothy head. This beer has a ton of carbonation. The smell is a pleasant bread ""bisquity"" aroma with floral, sweet malt, and some hops. The taste is creamy with bread yeast, hops, and some sweet malt. The after taste is a bit mettalic, holding the rating down. The m/f is light and the flavors mix fairly well. A good everyday beer that is light ,refreshing, and worth buying."
"Nice brew fron GD, but the sixers are a bit on the expensive side."
"Good feel, makes for nice drinking. A good choice of a PA."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle with a bottled month and week notch on side. Had a little head that quickly dissipated. The color was a darker honey with a little amber in it. It had a light hoppy smell and good mouthfeel. I enjoyed the beer overall but is still to hoppy for me to really enjoy and seek out. On the plus side, a year ago, I would have hated it but my hoppy tolerance is really coming on so gonna try again next year to see if score improves. A really good beer and recommend trying. (3, RB, T,O)"
"It's a solid, rather distinctive ale overall."
"Pours a light copper with a thin but sustainable frothy head. Leaves quite a lot of thick lacing. Malt is toasty and biscuity smelling and there is a citrus hop aroma with hints of pine. Taste is sweet and malty with the toasted biscuit flavors carrying over from the smell. Hop bitterness is subdued but has a pleasant rounding out flavor given by the citrus and pine tones. Mouthfeel could feel a bit thick from the sugars in this. Carbonation is apropos: smooth. This is drinkable enough. Would be a good session. Not a stellar pale ale, but a solid one overall."
"Mouthfeel is okay. Drinkability is limited for me by the exceedingly long bitter finish."
"The Denver Pale Ale pours a crystal clear ambery-goldish-copper into my pint glass. A thin layer of white foam sits atop the beer, quickly diminishing to a spotty skim after a few sips. The aroma of the beer is well balance with moderate sweet maltiness and moderate hop aroma, elements of spicy and citrusy. The beer glides into my mouth riding its moderate carbonation and delivers moderate sweet maltiness quickly followed by moderate bitterness. There is a fair amount of hop flavor in the beer, in the moderate/moderate-high range. The hop flavor is tasty, I think the best way to describe it would be spicy, maybe slightly citrusy. The DPA has a medium bodied mouthfeel with average drinkability. The beer would seemingly go very well with pizza or a spicy pasta dish. Overall, the DPA is a well balanced beer offering a nice malty sweetness upfront, quickly followed by a good balance of hop bitterness and hop flavors. The beer was quite enjoyable and would definitely enjoy again, would recommend to anyone who enjoys a beer with a fair amount of hop flavor with out high bitterness or high hop aroma."
"I really want to give this beer a fair shake. I'm trying not to punish it for tasting like soap. I'm really not."
"It has some things going for it, but the maniacal carbonation and off-key hops bring down the mean. One or two of these is doable, but being just drinkable is less than desirable, at least in my eyes. It's not totally beat, but I have to think Denver deserves better as a beer namesake."
"Flavor is quite hoppy, esp for the style. This could pass for an IPA to some people. Starts out with a malty balance, then the hop profile develops and finishes strong."
"D: great beer everything is balanced well, however to me I dont feel like this is a pale ale I see it leaning more towards esb in characteristic *my opinion*"
"Pours a golden straw color with a three finger head. The head leaves alittle bit of lacing. The smell of the beer is mostly hops with some grassy and floral smells. The taste has a bit of maltyness quickly followed by a strong hop bitterness with some citrus from the hops, cascade I think. The mouth is good. A good drinkable pale ale."
"Into a pint glass, pours a slightly hazed copper with little bubbles rising and a massive head, long lasting, decent stringy lacing. Aroma is almost absent it seems, just a peep of nice citric, floral hops coming through to me. Taste has nice bittering hops up front, pine and citric fruits, with a long, nice malty finish that seems almost English-styled. Mouth is medium bodied, enough carbonation to keep it lively, but really nice and creamy throughout."
"Nice drinkable session ale on a hot summer day."
"This beer is a golden yellow and there was not much head. The smell is hoppy. The taste is bittersweet. There is a deffinate hop presence. There is a lasting bitterness in the aftertaste. The beer is sticky in the mouthfeel. Smooth. I could go for this again. I have yet to be dissapointed by this brewer."
"Great Divide hasn't thrilled me - the Yeti Imperial Stout was good, but all their basic 12oz beers have left me unimpressed."
"Denver Pale Ale pours a light orange color with quite a large fluffy white head that overflowed my glass from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The label calls this an English pale ale, but it sure smells American to me. Citrusy, flowery hops dominate the aroma. Good malt backbone and citrusy and flowery hops balance it out nicely. Definitely not an English style beer, but a pretty decent American Pale Ale for sure. Recommended."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability/Overall: fairly drinkable as far as APAs go (not my favorite style) yet no where near as enjoyable as their Titan I had before this."
"D - Alright. It is nothing to fuss over, but it is easily sessionable and has a great flavor for barbecues. I will have this again is the oppurtunity arises."
"D- I enjoyed it and would like to have more than just the one that I purchased."
"Deep amber color-not the usual hazy amber of most pales I have had. Ok aroma-the hops are there but a bit muddied. Somewhat harsh bitterness followed by a decent helping of malt. Bitterness tends to linger. Ok mouthfeel-the lingering bitterness tends to overshadow the whole thing. An above average pale ale. Needs to be a bit softer if you ask me. I prefer Great Divide's other beers to be honest with you."
"A surprising brew. I find the unusual herbal mustyness thing to be one of it's charms. Hopped enough to be interesting, but certainly not a hop monster. Toasted malt is in good balance. A decent session brew."
"I really like this beer. I've heard the Great Divide name for a while but had yet to try any of their beers. This is a really nice, simple APA. Sweet caramel malts with a floral hop essence. Reminds me of Troeg's Pale Ale or maybe even a west coast like Red Seal. This is a really easy drinking brew and one I think others (non-BA's would really enjoy as well). I'm starting to home brew and if I could have something akin to this in my recipe book (and on tap) as a regular I'd be really happy and content. Very solid offering and one that makes me want to try the rest of Great Divide's lineup."
"My first Great Divide beer, poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Mediocrity ensued. It poured with a fairly creamy head, though not very thick. Good lacing. Lightly copper color and a medium hop nose. Nothing impressive. It has a medium, if not light, body and was easy to drink. It didn't really make a strong impression on me. As english pale ales go, I'd had hoped for a little somthing more in at least one of the categories, but this beer just seemed an average example of the style."
"A nice easy to drink session style pale."
"I opened three bottles of this. Two of them were like a home brew gone amock. Got an inch and a half of beer and the rest of the glass filled with foam. Not surprisingly, those bottles were dominated by a yeast flavor. The bottle without the yeast problem wa certainly distinctive but not much my style. It was more a British style pale ale than American. Had a toasty flavor and decent aroma. I'll try again and see what kind of luck I have with this stuff. So far, though, I don't think this is going to the top of my Favorites list."
"Re-rate 6-18-06: Obviously a much different beer than prior, now that infection control is under way. The nose is wonderfully hoppy and sweet with some grain husk and substantial malt underneath it all. The mouthfeel is nice and smooth with a medium body and mild-mod. carbonation. The hops are full, green, sweet and slightly pungent, and the finish is clean and crisp and hoppy. Cleanly fermented. No off-flavors. This time around, this is a world-class APA. I could drink this all day...kinda like a timid cousin of Stone IPA in it's hop flavor. A wonderful brew, highly recommended and inifinitely drinkable."
"Pours an auburn color with a great, big head that lasted well. Aroma is subtle, kinda hoppy with a bit of malt. Not much there for me. Taste was good, but nothing special. Just seemed a bit boring to me. Mouthfeel was light in body with a lot of carbonation. Overall a good, drinkable beer but just not something that grabbed me."
"English pale ale? I think not."
"This is very pleasent to drink, not highly hopped like a Sierra Nevada, but not a bad Pale ale. Would not travel out of my way for this, but very nice drinkable Pale ale."
"drinkability: moderate"
"Poured a medium copper color with massive tannish puffy head. Smell is mainly hoppy with some malt also present. Taste is predominately hoppy with some malt in the background. Finish is more dru than malty and very pleasant. A very enjoyable beer from Great Divide."
"Cheers2Beers"
"This could be by new favourite session beer....for those rare occasions when I crave one..excellent"
"Poured into pint American pint glass and was suprised by the vast amount of foam, I poured kind of hard because I like forcing a head out of my bear. Normaly PAs don't foam like this. Born on date clearly labled, first week in sept, 05, it is now may 06. There is a nice bit of yeast appearent in the bottle Nice amber color, what is to be expected of a PA. Lots of carbonation rising from within the beer. Nice piny and citrusy smell, but not as strong as I would like to see. smooth malty flavor to begin with followed by a piney hoppy flaver, absolute backwards of what I expected, normally hops comes first and whatever malt is in the beer comes out in the aftertaste. Very enjoyable but threw me a curveball. light bodied and clean in the mouth. The reason I picked it up was becuase it was on sale at beers of the world, and I hadn't tried it yet. I don't think I'll buy it again, because I normally get either my favorite of the style, or a beer I havent tried yet, but definitely worth a try atleast once."
"Not a bad Pale Ale. Pours out to a hazed brownish orange color with a big head of white foam. Lots of lace, and medium carbonation. Aromas of hop oil, pine and citrus fill the nose. Taste is medium bodied and straighforward. Hops, pine, malt, citrus, grain. Kind of weak in the hoppy dept. but still drinkable. Mouthfeel was acceptable, but bland and boring. Nothing noteable. Drinkability is average."
"D - For the style it definitely needs some work."
"Bright golden copper with soapy white lather atop strafing carbonation. Grassy and floral hop notes stand out in the aroma; a deeper sniff reveals a sweet and toasty malt presence as well. Hop flavor is spicy at first, then mostly floral -- quite English, for the most part --, then the middle is malty -- the sweet kind of malt, not really toasty or biscuity. Some brief mineral content at the finish, along with an indistinct sweet fruitiness. Smooth and crisp mouthfeel, average medium body -- totally appropriate for the style. Eminently quaffable. Once I had this on tap at some bar in the Denver airport, and it really hit the spot."
"12 ounce bottle. Notched at N and a slight notch at 2 (2???)"
"Opinion: Well, I am not a hophead by any means, but this is a pretty good beer. I like how Great Divide's beers don't end harsh like they over-use high alpha hops. This particular one is a bit on the hoppy side for my personal taste, but it is still to style so you can't fault it for that. I'd drink this beer again."
"Mouthfeel was average. I don't think I'd buy another of these beers. The strange, nutty taste just didn't do much for me."
"Frankly, I'm not a big fan of pale ales but this one is very, very nice."
"Brew was a part of a mixed 12 pack. Poured to an amber color with a large off white head that has good retention leaving lacing along the side of the glass. The aromas are good, floral hop notes jump out mixing with a sweet malt smell of caramel and toasted grains. The taste is sweet at first and then you get a fair amount of hop taste that balances this brew out. Over all it is a good brew, nothing spectacular but one I would not mind having in the fridge. Probably my least favorite of the brews that cam in the mixed 12 pack, had 3 other brews in it."
"A lite orange red color with a decent white head, that laces slowly on the glass. Very clear for a pale ale. A nice scent of hop aroma of pine and citrus are there, with touches of the malt. The taste the malt starts off at the beggining, then a rush of hop flavor hits the palate, and that flavor lasts for sometime. In the mouth, it was slightly watery, but does not loose any of its flavor and finishes dry on the palate. Overall a good beer, probably, stronger hop flavor then people usually taste in a beer."
"Verdict: The malt provides plenty of body, but not much distinctive flavor. It's merely a palette for the hops. This is a nice beer, even if it's a little one-note."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, medium bodied with a nice carbonation that adds a bit of a creamy texture to the brew. This would be a nice session brew, although I think I'd probably opt for the IPA personally. A tasty pale ale that's good to drink, enough said."
"This beer isn't as deep as most of those that I prefer to drink, but it works well for a variety of drinkers. Not too extreme and not bold, but solid enough to enjoy it's nuances. American pale ales have more citrus, hops, and variety to them, but seeing an American take on an English style, such as this, proves to me that this style from across the pond can compete with it's Yankee cousins..."
"Drinkability: nice session beer. A bit more bold than other American brewed English Pale Ales."
"Overall, a very nice beer. Probably my favorite out of the sampler pack that I picked up the other day. There is lots to enjoy here, but it is not overdone. I can appreciate that."
"Overall, this is one you could get some life out of. Smooth, tasty, and not too overpowering (as long as you love hops)."
"Pours a lightly hazy solid copper color with a finger of head that falls to a very solid full coat over top. Nose is rife with raw toasty and grainey character, almost even a freshly cracked marris otter with a touch of crystal. I'm amazed at the rawness of the aroma. No real hop characte coming through in the nose. Flavor is simialr to the aroma...very raw and grainey. Very nice toasted maltyness with just a hint of graineyness to give it an edge. I'm not getting a lot of hop flavor, but there is a moderate but mellow hop bitterness on the finish that lingers just long enough to let me know it is there. Feel is on the lighter end of moderate with a lighter carbonation. It works well with the flavors of this one. Overall, I am liking this one. The raw quality really gives it an edge that I have not found in other pale ales. I have always liked taking grain and chewing on it before mashin in, so that may be where this one draws me in. I'd have it again, especially on a brew day."
"This is decidedly an English style pale ale. OK, but nothing special. Easy to drink but rather boring."
"Pours a nice coppery color with an inch of tan head, with good carbonation. It smells kind of tangy and hoppy, with some sweet malt notes as well. The taste is a bit bitter, with just the right amount of tang, some sweet notes are present too. The mouthfeel is very good, kind of creamy. A very drinkable beer."
"Definately a beer in the English Pale tradition. Another boring offering from GD. Could have been something better, but it has a metallic taste and the hops are lifeless, just kind of there. It has a decent mild amber color with a white head. Forget about this beer I know I did."
"good beer worth a try if you can find it not for everyone though"
"Pours with a three-finger light tan head that fades slowly and leaving some lace. Cloudy amber color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Nose is hoppy with some caramel overtones. Starts sweet but the hops are there, finish is clean. Not bad for a pale that are usually loaded with hops. $1.95 for a 12 oz bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, Ma."
"I was pretty pleased with this beer. It deserves better than the (relatively) lower scores it has gotten so far."
"This brew pours out with a nice head and copper color. The aroma is not that strong and it has faint hints of typical English bitters. The taste reminds me more of an English bitter of English pale ale than an American Pale Ale. It's has that mellow, buttery, just sort of ""ale"" favor that you get from bitters. The mouthfeel is very consistant with a mild pale ale and well balanced. It's probably a great session brew."
"Will probably become my default pale ale since it's available locally. I liked it a lot and found after the first one I was ready for another one."
"This one poured with a beautiful, two-fingered and fluffy head that has a bit of a peach hue. The beer itself is straight copper in color. The nose is wonderfully complex and assertive. Bountiful floral hop elements mix with prominent sweet malty notes. The body is medium but the mouthfeel has clear traction to it, leading you to believe it will be gritty and hoppy. As Lee Corso would say, not so fast my friend. The lovely hop notes are balanced well with what can mostly be described by a sweet, creamy malt concoction. The contrast is unreal. It finishes with a puckering kick, but floral remnants keep it an easy-to-drink offering. A very complex beer for the style."
"This pale ale pours a maroon reddish color that leaves a very thin beige lace that sticks to the glass. The aroma is sweet, honey, herbal tea, spices, crystalized sugar. The taste starts bitter, somewhat tannic like a strong tea. Then the beer then gives you an unsweetened fresh lemonade tanginess, that quickly sweeteness with a honey coating on the throat. I like this beer, it kind of brings a new kick to the pale ale but still sticking to the tradional style. I paired this with a lemon glazed chicken over wheat rice to mirror the lemon, honey sweetness, and some wheat flavors I found in the beer."
"Overall: A very drinkable pale ale that I could keep in my fridge any day of the week. Nothing too challenging, but a brew with enough going on to keep you interested."
" Props to breaking the mold in the pale ale style and doing it in such a great way. This is more like a hybrid style closer to something like Fat Tire than Sierra Nevada. Which makes sense given the geography. :) Also, it's very good that this beer is alot more than just a light version of the breweries IPA; this is a whole different beer. Gold medal winner at both the World Beer Cup and Great American beer Fest Very happy Great Divide is in Cali now. Colorado, you are the bomb. New Beligum, Boulder (not in cali..yet) and Great Devide. All hail!"
"The aroma is hoppy and fruity sweet. Almost honey twinge to it. The taste is great. It kinda reminds me of Middle Ages Syracuse Pale ale. Really simple with a good fruity side to it. Hops and malt is very well balanced. Simply a pleasure to drink. Good for a not too bitter mood, awesome balance of flavor. Fresh and crisp. A hint of roastiness. Medium body. INSANELY drinkable."
"Light on the palate and easy to drink, this is one of the more rare APA's that doesn't grind on me and I could drink a session worth of these 5.6% pale's."
"Great Divide has hit many home-runs in the last couple years with their special beers, but the original lineup continues to disappoint, largely. They should drop this one from the lineup and move one of their excellent 22-ouncers into its place."
"It is quite good aside from its explosive head. It overflowed my pint glass on both pours."
"At least it looked good . . . as it went down the drain. One of only a few drain pours for me."
"Drinkability: Quite good."
"Last Tasted: 11/14/05"
"Drinkable effort that doesn't stand out in the pack, but is solid ale."
"To my way of thinking, this is a pretty tasty pale ale. I tend to prefer the more hoppy, American style pales, though an English pale is a pleasant session beer. This is not the latter, and I'd happily drink several of these, and wouldn't shy away from it in the store."
"Had moderate carbonation but could have used more. Definitely a drinkable brew for times when a wheat is too weak, but an IPA might be a little much. Would stand up well with lower alpha APAs."
"I let it sit on the counter to warm up for about 15 minutes, and boy did the head take off when I poured. I got through about 2/3 of the bottle and ended up with a foamy 3"" thick head that was dark cream in color. The beer itself is crystal clear, copper in color, and has streams of tiny bubbles rising throughout. The aroma is light and crisp with just a hint of malt to go along with notes of orange from the hops. The citrusy hop aroma is a bit strange, almost aritificial/chemical and a bit distracting. Searching the bottle I find it was bottled in the first week of June. Not the freshest pale ale I've had, but it should be fine. The strange chemical orange flavor seems to enter my mouth along with the beer, but it's not stopping me. Flavors are faint and crisp. Very light malt base reminds me of white bread, and then there is a dash of sweet citrus hop flavor. The finish is strange with a bitterness thatis mild, but is still overpowering and a bit of plastic thrown in for good measure. I don't know if it's old or bad, but based on Great Divide's other beers and pieces of this one I know this beer can be much more."
"Taste starts with a bit of mild malt and yeast, spicy hops kick in for the finish with a touch of oranges all the way through. Fairly crisp, moderately dry finish."
"Sampled in Denver during GABF week. A delicious pale ale with a very nice nose of pine and a touch of citrus. Great body and nice beer foam when poured into pint galss. Color and clarity were fabulous. This is a great pale ale that is amazingly drinkable. I also thought the label was well done."
"Pours a nice copper color with a 1-inch off white foamy head. The nose is a very nice balance of citrus and floral hops and select malts. The taste is very hearty and earthy. Bitter hops with a nearly skunky edge are combined with floral hops, which make for a clean, dry finish. Seems to taste just a little off the beaten path. The mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, and the drinkability is fine. Not a bad beer here, but not a sensational one either."
"Drinkability: The grainy element of the beer doesn't really do it for me; I just think it is very rough"
"Aroma of Very citrussy grapefruit, floral, piney, with carmel and malts. Juicy hop and fruity, with bitter aftertaste. Certainly not a lot of malting, more IPA and can pass as one. light golden yellow with a bit of froth. Understated carbonation. A good one."
"This was an ok Pale Ale. Not something I'll go out of my way to look for again."
"Moderately light body with lively carbonation that grows to frothiness on the tongue. Not that great of a brew, but perhaps a good pale ale for Macro drinkers to start ona craft experience with."
"Overall: A solid brew displaying nice characteristics of a traditional American Pale Ale. Worth a try."
"The other Great Divide beers Ive had have been a little disappointing. However, this one breaks that mold. Big caramel color, with respectable head retention. This beer was very fresh, the packy (ie) said they had just arrived. Hoppy up front followed by caramel and pine. This beer was quick drinking, so I guess that makes its drinkability high. I really enjoyed this one."
"A terrifically drinkable pale ale. Simple and true to style. Nice esters and malty sweetness to the nose. No yeast, not grain, just clean aromas. Look is traditionally an APA: golden and well carbonated. Flavors are totally of barley malt. Not too heavy, or trying to pick up too much fruitiness. Not too weak. Warm fermenting hopping brings out nice esters in flavor, bitterness, spiciness and slight hints of caramel and toast. Body falls a bit short, but has fair creaminess. Aftertaste is mildly malty and bitter. Very appropriate to style."
"Drinkability: I'd have another, wouldn't mind watching some football with a couple of these."
"A mild sugary taste vies for attention, throughout. Like a kid sister; she's cute but doesn't belong with the big guys."
"A clean amber beer with a small off white head and some lace. There is a little sour wet grain aroma in front of a promiseing grapefruit note. The smooth malty start to the flavor has a hint of carmel in the background. Then the hops take over the back of your tongue with a peppery bite and a hint of citrus on the finish."
"Appearance is red amber with beige foam and some lacing. Aroma is creamy malt, floral, and plum-scented hops. Initial taste is mostly malt with some hop extract, mild fruit esters and slightly bitter. Finish is dry and hoppy, with a mixture of hops and barley. Okay. Might work as a session beer."
"single bottle with no legible born on date. poured a massive foam head with orangish tint. Good hop smell, but not one that knocks you over. Tons of lacing, I was excited for my first taste. Surprising Malty taste with a hop finish. A little disappointed, for me a slightly above average pale ale."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/4"" beige head over the amber brew. Pillowy head lasts well, with good lacing. Aroma is citrusy, piney hops over a sweet pale malt base. Taste is slightly spicy hops with some opposing sweetness, but not too much. Mouthfeel and drinkability are great. Nice APA, not too over the top. Nice session brew, but if you're looking for a hop monster, move along, nothing to see here..."
"Drinkable for sure, but not fantastic."
"Overall: a pretty drinkable APA. I cant say it would become a staple in my fridge but it certainly beat out all the other beers on-tap at the Denver airport. Worth a try."
"Smooth in the mouth. Good beer for a hot night."
"Pours a really attractive crystal clear amber color with a sticky, rocky white head. Sticky rings of lacing are apparent on the glass. Smell is grassy with some lemons and citrous, also some caramel. Overall, the taste is a little bland. Toasty malts and subdued caramel mix with clean herbal English hops. Some grassiness is there as well, along with a hint of subtle citric American hops. I was expecting a little more hop flavor from Great Divide after enjoying their IPA and DIPA. Although this seems to be more in the English style of pale ales, it is nevertheless a well balanced, easy drinking brew."
"The beer pours a dark gold/amber color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a mildly malty scent that boasts of pale and light crystal malts. It also has a citrus hop aroma and a toastey quality. The taste is decent. It has a soapy flavor that is the product of citrus hops and light crystal malts. There isn't much balance here. It has a musty, bitter aftertaste. The mouthfeel is decent also. It is a low/medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is an average American pale ale. It's one and done for me."
"Poured a pale amber color, with a solid white head and little floating yeast chunks. Surprisingly fresh floral hop aroma, followed by a strong toffee aroma with a slight buttery tint. The flavor brings out the caramel and toffe with a significant up front bitterness. Decent body with just a little slipperyness in the finish. This was a good beer, which I suspect would be better if a little more fresh."
"This beer pours out an amber color with an off-white head. The aroma is a balance between the malt and the hops, with the malt coming out slightly ahead. The flavor is sweet at first, a little like honey. A nice dose of piney hops come through, but this is not as hoppy as most American pale ales. I think this beer would have been pretty good if it were just a little lighter. There were some nice flavors, I just thought it was too filling."
"Acquired this beer in a ""brewers mix pack"" along with 3 other Great Divide Brews. The Appearance is almost amber but perhaps a little paler but definately one of the darker APA's ive tried...it poured with a 1 finger pearl white head that dissapated quickly but left nice blotchy lacing along the glass. The aroma is interesting, with a sweet maltiness (caramel malt maybe?) followed by a subtle floral hops scent. The taste is interesting but for me doesnt live up to the smell, first the hops hit your tongue with a mild bitterness (definately not one of the hoppier American Pale's) followed by a bit of bready malt flavor but quickly reverts back to the hop oils with a lightly bitter and dry finish. The moughtfeel is descent with a medium body and moderate carbonation which is really what is expected of this style. An easy drinking American Pale that could be a nice session beer, but isnt really hoppy or complex enough to make it a standout brew in any sense. Not bad by any means and could possibly be a ""gateway"" beer for future hopheads because it has that wonderful bitterness we all love but doesnt overwhelm the tongue."
"This tastes like an APA that should be a lot hoppier than it is. Really, it's not complex enough to be impressive and it's not bitter enough to get the attention of hop heads."
"I wasn't too thoroughly impressed by this beer, but it was still a refreshing change of pace. It almost seemed to be more of an English style than American. The pour was slightly hazy and amber/copper hued with almost no head that faded to a film. Smells of noble hops and pale malts. Almost smells like a hoppy tea with the hay-like sweetness of the malts in the bouqet. The taste is kind of buttery and sweet, kind of similar to a Fullers London Pride or Sam Smith's Pale. The hoppiness reminds me quite a bit of Boulevard's Pale Ale, though slightly subdued compared to the traditional APA style, IMO. I will probably try other Great Divide brews in the future."
"Pours an orangish copper hue with a one-inch off-white head that hangs around for a little while. Good carbonation keeps coming. Pleasant aroma is characteristic of an English pale or mild ale - smooth, subtle malt with just a whiff of hops in the background. Similarities to the English style continue on the palate. Rich, almost creamy body holds a mild, slightly bitter palate up front with a touch of spiciness (black pepper), followed by a touch of bitter hops on the finish. Aftertaste is a little harsh. Could be a decent session beer; makes me wish I'd bought more than a single."
"Medium bodied. The appearance is too light, the aroma is too light, the taste is too light and the bitterness is too low."
"the mouthfeel was easy drinking"
"Great Divide's dlagship Denver Pale Ale strattles the fence between an English-style and American pale ale. The brewery promotes it as English-style, and to their credit it certainly wins enough medals when entered into competition as such. But Michael Jackson has called it an American-style pale ale, as have many others. It's amber colored body is a touch darker than what we might normally think of as American (although it certainly fits within the guidelines), but color alone does not make it English. The nose, however, does. The hops are decidedly floral and grassy, over some yeasty fruitiness and a lightly sweet malt base. It's medium-bodied with a standard carbonation (right @ 2.5 volumes CO2), and it's a bit airy and smooth across the palate. In the flavor, however, some more hop flavor is present than might be expected in an English version. Still, it's nicely malty with a wash of crystal malt character; and some delicate yeasty fruitiness rounds it out. But does it have the depth of malt character to make it truly English? That could be argued, but it's also fairly clean and straightforward like and American pale ale. But regardless of its designation, it's quite nicely balanced with malt, hop and yeast all present but distinct, and anchored by a solid but far from obtrusive bitterness. It finishes dry with some quickly fading malt and hop flavor, followed by some mold, lingering bitterness. Very well done!"
"Decent mixture of copper and amber tone with a white lacey head that appears to float nicely. A definitive hoppy aroma, some fresh fruit also quickly detected. Up front, oily and slick, hops presence is full and bitter with a malt-based middle. Dry and grainy, a bit of caramel rides in the background. Juicy hops and citrus rinds round out this very nice beverage. Some hops-heads may question its character, yet this is a pretty well balanced APA, session-able indeed."
"Pours a medium copper color, pretty standard looking, except for the ridiculously large head, about 1"" in an American pint glass. Served at about cellar temp. floral hops and bready malt in the nose. Taste is very malty, with good hop presence, but is utterly ruined by a melted plastic flavor that i have not encountered from an APA for a very long time. Disappointing, this might be a bad batch, will rereview later on if I get the chance."
"Overall, this is one of those beer that is nice to try but is easily forgotten."
"Pours a brilliantly clear full copper color, it is topped by a light amber tan head with a fairly low level of carbonation. The aroma is sweet with caramel malts and hopily spiced with notes of tangerine, apricot, and oranges, and a nice fruity flower nectar type thing. The taste is quite well balanced. This beer is not quite sweet yet quite fruity & hoppy. It is very well balanced with a complimenting malty caramel note that accentuates the hops. This beer reminds me of candied orange peels, spruce tips. The hops nearly dance across my tongue with spicy herbal notes of pine and a nice bitterness that moves from the middle of my tongue to the back of my mouth as this beer passes down my gullet. This is just a really nicely made Pale Ale, it is actually even better than the IPA and IIPA from this brewery."
"i really liked this stuff. more than sierra nevada. does this get me into the mile high club?"
"Overall Impression: All in all a decent Pale Ale. Nothing outstanding, but a good beer to spend the day with."
"12 oz. bottle pours a clear rusty orange hue. A massive, fake looking off white head leaves an awesome lace. Has a spicy, black pepper caramel smell. Medium bodied with way too much carbonation. Mildly sweet caramel taste with a raw hop bitterness to finish. The big foam and carbonation reminds me of Hales Pale Ale ."
"Dig it!"
"Overall, a little too sweet for me, although it got better as it warmed. Not much of the classic English PA hoppiness."
"Amber colored pale ale? Not sure about that. No head or carbonation to speak of, slight lacing. Fruity smell, a little stronger than a typical pale ale. Little complexity in the mouth, could be from the lack of carbonation. Nice hops and bitterness, strong flavor characteristics of an india pale ale. Label mentions it has won three medals for English Pale Ales yet this description above says its an American Pale Ale, what's the difference, does it just depend where it's brewed? Paid $1.59 for a single at a local beer store. Good deal but there's others available there I like much better."
"Update: I've now finished the sixer, and nope, I don't like this beer. I'm downgrading the taste to 3. It's not necessarily a bad beer, I just prefer my brews vegetables without. ;-)"
"An adequate ale all the way, something that fills in quite nicely as a standard sessioner...nothing wrong with that, nothing at all. Actually, despite that i prefer other types of ales, I like this better, for what it is, the more I drink."
"Pours a murky copper brown. Small tannish yellow head disappears to a lace around the glass very quickly. Smell is sweet, hop aroma is light and flowery. Very malty and even some fruitiness. Low-moderate carbonation. Strong hop flavor, but low bitterness. Almost oily the amount of hops they put in. Good body and almost sweet malt, but finishes dry with a light bitterness aftertaste. Its definitely a wussy american pale ale, probably good a good gateway into stronger, more bitter pale ales."
"Light bodied with a moderate carbonation. Not a showy Pale Ale in the least, but a decent one regardless. This tends towards the 100's of other mediocre, instantly forgotten APAs, but a slightly foward malt presence saves this from that fate. Good session/grill choice, I feel."

"One cm of pale, beige-white, thick, foamy head sits on a dark, amber-brown, clear beer. The smell is citrus-hoppy with some sourish cream. Tangy, hoppy and dusty up front; sour, fruity and a little watery through the middle; toasty, grainsy, hoppy bitter in the end. It's a decent APA: quite roasty, not overly hoppy."
"Bought this as part of a Brewer's Picks collection for around $13. DPA pours a dark copper color with short off-white head. Aroma is hoppy, with some sweetness buried in the hops. Taste is a balanced combination of mild pine hops and sweet malts. The flavor lingers in my mouth for an almost perfect amount of time, leaving me ready for another sip when it's finished. This is really tasty and almost too easy to drink. Great Divide's flagship beer, DPA, is very good, but there are better APAs out there."
"Beautifully bright copper color, medium sized foamy creamed cap of ivory hue sits briefly, moderately laced with thin patchy sheets. Keeps some thinner foam on top along with a foamy collar pretty much the entire glass. Aroma has a dry leafy/wood hoppyness, touches of peach and orange, toasty, raw breadish malt backing. Flavors are about the same, little more of a malt sided pale with a dull sweetness of toasty bread and a somber caramel blending within, midway brings in some slight fruity malts and hops, notes of dark orange, finishes nice with a complexing little display of hops, tame bitterness overall, leafy, woodish and floral hops with a super squeezed in piney bite and some tannic and metallic hints. Feel is about medium with a somewhat loosened slickness and creamyness. Finishes dry with a narrowing chalky texture. No real cohesiveness to its body, its just kinda there. Not what I prefer out of a Pale, but not bad...but there's better."
"Overall this is a good beer, not one of the best of the style but very good, and very drinkable."
"A while back someone was asking for a beer to put on tap at his Asian restaurant; this would have been my choice had I know about it at the time. I have a feeling this would go really well with General Tso's chicken."

"Denver Pale Ale carves out its own little niche in the style. Although it isn't among my very favorites, I can see how it's won some awards along the way."
"A nice American Pale Ale, with good drinkability, but nothing to set it apart from the crowded field."
"This PA has a dark orange/amber colored body. Good sized cream colored head on top. Good lace. The nose is floral hops, some hints of hop oil. The hop blast is balanced out with sweet caramel malts. Somewhat thinner bodied than some of my favorite PAs. Some citrus notes. This is a good PA, not outstanding but delicious none-the-less."
"Nice pale ale, very good job. First taste of the Great Divide and I'm hoping to try many more."
"Picked up a 6-pack of these over the weekend. Frankly not all that impressed with this beer. It's hard to describe, but the taste just did not sit well with me - that plus a watery mouthfeel did not make for a very enjoyable brew. Like one of the previous reviewers, I too was expecting a little more hop character...so I was a little let down by that. The appearance and aroma were decent, but nothing spectacular, and if you can get past whatever taste was bothering me, I guess this beer is pretty drinkable. I'm not going to write-off the brewery, and plan on trying their strong ale, and their porter, but based on my personal experience, I think you can find much better pale ale's out there."
"A nice offering from Great Divide that would be a nice introduction to those who have not known the pleasure of a micro brew."
"The flavor is of the hops and some malting. The body is thin and more than a bit watery. Smooth and a bit creamy, just the same. Easy drinkability with a fine ending bitterness."
"Overall Impression: I’m really hoping my bottle is 50 weeks old, but that still wouldn’t explain away the DMS taste. It might help explain where the hops went. The most hoppiness I got out of this was the picture on the bottle. Maybe I’ve blown out my hop receptors with all the Rogue and Stone beers, but I’m just not tasting any here. Despite the DMS taste, this ends up being fairly drinkable beer, but I can’t really recommend it."
"The beer pours to a nice amber color with a modest and frothy off white head, as it erodes a fine sealing sheet of lace is left behind to drape the glass. Nose is lightly floral, malt sweet, crisp and fresh; start is sweet, nice malt profile with a light to moderate top. Finish is crisp in its acidity, hops apropos to the style, a drinkable beer, and one I received in or from four different Beer Clubs, so somebody must like this beer."

"Amber colored ale that pours with a rocky head. This beer has an herbal aroma with herbal tasting hops that blend with an assertive clean malt flavor. There's a hint of a mineral-like quality to this lighter bodied pale ale. The finish is lightly bitter and quick. A very quaffable, tasty pale ale, but a bit on the lightweight. Found this at a Brennan's produce market in Monroe, Wisc., and hadn't seen it in awhile around my homebase in the Chicago suburbs."
"Kind of a bland APA in my opinion. Clear copperish golden colored with a slim head and little lacing. Medium hop aroma and a bit sweet smelling. Flavor is slightly bitter and has a metallic taste to it. A bit watery. Medium body. Not a bad beer just nothing really impressive."
"Clearish medium amber appearance, creamy 1/2 inch head that's shiny and a pale tannish white. Nice laces, interlocking webs of crystalline foam. Aroma is reserved, minimal malt and a somewhat sharp huckleberry flowery hop smell. Malt flavors assert early, medium body and carbonation, some bits of pizza dough breadiness and pale caramel. Hop balance is good and leaves the floral impression slightly behind as there is a weak assertion of a juicy bit of citrus rind. Not piney at all. Not as aggresively hopped as many in the American style. Decent beer here, a little on the straight forward side for me to pick it up again."
"A nice hoppy pale ale that hop lovers will enjoy...a bit more blalance and this would be very special...as it is, I still think it is very good..."
"As the six pack carrier exclaims, call it DPA. Well, DPA pours a slightly hazed apricot color with a creamy white head, which leaves subdued trails of lace down the glass. Nose is of some floral hops and a surprising amount of biscuity malt. For a beer that is supposed to have a dense concentration on hops, I didn't notice as much as expected. Flavor is a decent balance between bready, biscuity, somewhat caramel-tasting malt and some citric hops. Once again, not nearly as hopped-up as advertised, or maybe it's just me. Tastes and smells a lot more like an English style IPA. This is a medium to full bodied brew, which is fairly drinkable. Would work as a solid session beer, as well."
"Overall, a solid pale ale."
"This beer is quite bitter, despite the overall thinness in body. Has an unusual, and quite hoppy fragance. The hops are relatively restrained in effect, however. Some fruity notes, but less so than my favorites of the style. Little head, some lacing throughout. Overall, just seems out of balance. Most noticeable is the thinness and bitterness."
"Drinkability: Your basic pale ale. Crisp and puckering on the back end with just a little bit of a hoppy aftertaste. A pretty solid pale ale when all is said and done."
"Although its ben awhile since i have had this I do remember some of the qualitys,it is one of the first pale ales I ever had.Had a decent copper color with a small head,had a firm malt background with hoppy herbal tones the most.Quite balances for a pale ale good malty background with floral fruity hop flavor.A little filling as I reacall but a pretty good pale ale."
"The finish offers a twist of toffee that seems to be revealed by the exhaustion of the other flavors. like little toffee pebbles glistening in the sun after the tide washes away. I try and catch one between my teeth, only to drain the glass all too quickly...darn."
"Pours a slightly reddish amber color with a creamy white head that dissipates into a thick and bubbly lace. Nose is sweet malt and very floral hops. Taste is sweet fruits and malts at first quickly replaced by bitter hop resins that makeup the core of the flavor with a bit of citrus in the end. The hop oils also create a bit a slick feel in the mouth. Crisp and refreshing, this brew is a fine example of what a good English-style pale ale should be."
"This beer pours a clear light tea color with a large 2-½ finger off-white head. The smell consists of mouthwatering citrusy hops with fresh baked bread background aromas. The taste is more of the fresh baked bread and pungent citrusy fruit hops and mild malted background. This is a refreshing light bodied brew that drinks down easy and finishes with a light dry finish with each swallow. Very nice brew! Cheers!"
"Nicknamed DPA, Great Divide's pale ale is a popular choice with the locals. The beer poured with an attractive amber honey appearance. The creamy head was quick to dissipate, leaving even lacing and a mixture of fine foam and larger bubbles on the surface. The aroma was notably hoppy, but yeast was present as well. The malt lingered in the background in a rather light, almost tinny effect. With a watery mouth-feel, this highly-carbonated ale brought up the malt when the tongue was struck. The balance was pleasant and the hop bitterness gently bit upon a shallow-bodied swallow. This is a highly drinkable beer, with no objectionable qualities. The issue here is a lack of originality, making for a somewhat light, and burpy, experience."
"Tasted at the Barrelhouse Brewing Company Microbrew Fest on November 9. Light amber color with minute head. Hops aroma that was difficult to detect. This seemed watered-down and nothing special to me. I like more hops in my APAs."
"Hazy orange with yeast chunks. HUGE head, in fact this stuff foamed over my glass with little provocation. Yikes, lookout...the carbonation is out of control! Much care was needed to pour the remaining half of the bottle. After the foaming ordeal I was able to enjoy this fine example of a pale ale. Light-medium toasted malt, with citrus orange/tangerine aroma and flavor. Yeast haze lends a breadiness to the character and contributes to the medium body and full mouthfeel. When all's said and done, a good brew. Thanks to the wife for scoring this for me from a recent business trip. What a good woman."
"In the bottle I still love this beer, but the carbonation is often a little high and the beer is often not as fresh, as can be expected.  This style is just better on tap.  The high carbonation adds a little acidity that slightly throws off the balance and edges the beer a bit to the bitter side.  Still a great beer though."
"Denver Pale Ale:  Remarkable carbonation, I mean scrubbing bubbles, and the head was explosive.  There was very heavy sediment in the bottle and in the glass.  That being said, the beer had some taste and had a nice hoppy aroma, taste and aftertaste.  I’m guessing the beer sat around awhile, but it wasn’t unpleasant."
"Well, unlike others, I got an amazing head on this beer!  Next time I will pour it differently.  This beer formed a large, sudsy almost float style head that left some lace after it subsided.  It was a cloudy dark gold color with some sediment present.  There was a heavy amount of carbonation.  The aroma was of hops, citrus and malt.  It had a flavor of hops, rather oily.  Also some light caramel malt present.  The finish was a bit tangy no doubt due to the heavy carbonation.  Not a bad pale ale."
"copper in color with a minimal head.  toasty malts and citrusy hops in the nose.  very easy drinking, quite smooth with a nice balance of malt and fruity hops.  the quintessential session american pale ale.  just what the doctor ordered after a long hot, humid day in the sun at work.  very refreshing!"
"This beer has a sweet malty aroma with fruit and hop notes.  Color is a dark yellow gold with a thick white head when poured, and which settles to a thin layer with lots of lace.  Smooth taste with a lightly sweet solid malt flavor, citrus fruit, and mild hops, which rises towards the finish.  A solid pale ale, not as distinctive as some others that I have tried, but certainly not bad."
"Notes: True characteristics of an American Pale Ale. Distinct hop profile with a straight forward malt palate."
"This struck me as a pale ale in a very traditional English style.  A hard pour produced a tall, pillowy head, that settled down with an intricate Brussels lace pattern on the side of the glass.  Nicely hopped, but held back somewhat.  The hops profile was quite clean, without a lot of floral or citrus notes.  Quite smooth and unassuming, a good session candidate."
