"Looks good but not tasty"

"A fun brew, and certainly one to keep in mind every year."
""
"Overall not a bad beer, just that aftertaste that throws the balance of the beer off."
"Serving type: bottle."
"Appearance 4, Aroma 3.75, Flavor 3.75, Palate 3.75, Overall 3.75"

"Overall â€“ The look was fantastic, but other than that, this was a fairly unbalanced and slightly off putting brew.  Not one I will go to again."

"Pours a light orange color with a little bit of lacing. The smell had a lot of spice such as pepper to it as well as pear and apple scents. The taste starts off strong with dark fruits like plum and apple with pepper and vanilla flavors coming in at the end. The alcohol flavor was definitely there but was not overpowering to the rest of the beer. A little forgettable but not a bad beer by any means."

"01/02/13 On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. Definitely like Aventinus' little sibling. Less sweet & a tad more toasty, but having seen the light it reflects a bit dim."

"A decent English pale, it's big on the herbal hops and buttery malts which is always kind of an 'eh' flavor combo for me, but really not a bad beer."

"Overall - It is a pretty decent English pale ale."

"The body was full and even, and not quite full. Drinkability was very good, I could easily drain a couple bottles of this. Overall, a very good beer, certainly worth grabbingif you see it, perhaps even a bit of effort to find."
"Very Bad Elf is actually Very Easy to Drink. Subtle layers of citrus and toffee sweetness without the chalkiness you might expect from an English pale. Quite balanced and smooth, but I noticed the tightly wrapped layers loosen up a bit as the beer warms. Drink cold."
"Overall - Classic English pale. Solid all-around. It's not worth the high asking price ($7-8 for approx. 17 ounces) considering it is, at best, a very good but not remarkable EPA. I got it at closeout for $2.99 though, so I can't be too miffed."

"It had a fresh taste and was very drinkable. We will be sampling several other elves soon including A well aged barleywine. Based on this I really look forward to that treat."
""
""
"Honey amber color, some bready, yeasty aromas. The initial taste was sweetened grapefruit, then a bit of fruity anise. Perhaps a bit too sweet for an English IPA as it approached a dubbel-like quality. It didn't warm well - the flavors became muddled. Still, a good tasting beer at a decent price."
""
""
"A pretty decent ale, nothing spectacular but I have no problems with it. Glad to have it, wouldn't turn it down in the future. Drinks pretty easy given it's slightly above-average abv."
""
"D - Not my favorite, but an interesting beer for sure."
""
"Wouldn't you know it, Very Bad Elf is pretty much exactly what you'd think a higher gravity version of Bad Elf would be. It has aromas of pithy, citric, and spicy hopping over a medium leveled booze and caramel / toffee malt component which also shows up in the flavor teamed up with some stone fruits (reds and purples) and the same noble hopping finish teamed up with some mildly rising boozey warmth for a nice level of dryness."

"O: The look and buzz are about the only highlights of this brew. The 7.5% ABV is bracing and warms the soul on a wintery night, but it lacks true complexity or balance expected in an English pale. Not terrible, but I probably wouldn;t pick it up on its own."
"Not a good beer. Definitely expected a lot more."
""
""
""
""

"Pours a lucozade colour which leaves a two finger creamy head and just a rim of lacing,the smell is boozy alcohol,toffee and dried apricots,the mouthfeel is medium bodied and has tastes of brandy,xmas cake,fruity hops,caramel and toffee,with the finish being quite sweet like port and overall its not bad and would be great for xmas but since thats over id say its a nice nightcap."
""
"O-I liked the smell, I wish more of that carried over into the flavors but a pretty good beer anyway"
"Pours crystal clear, copper-colored with minimal carbonation and thin, off-white head that dissipates pretty quickly. Aroma of sweet caramel and bready malts with an ample amount of floral hops and a touch of cherry and raisin fruit. The flavor comes on malty with grainy bread and caramel notes. Just a hint of floral, fruity hops comes through. The aftertaste is smoky at the end, overshadowed by a rather intense bitterness. Smooth but thin mouthfeel, becoming entirely too bitter and rough with a strong ethanol burn as it warms."
"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a vibrant copper coloring, slightly hazed, with no head. The nose is a syrupy caramel malt with toffee highlights. Very sweet aromas. The beer's flavors are roasted and toasty, with a solid hops presence in the backbone that is peppery and resiny. Very well balanced flavors. Some highlights of juniper and berry. The aftertaste is mostly toffee, with a slight hopping, and the finish is slick and smooth. Tasty beer, and the booze presence is minimal, serving more as a highlight throughout. Good brew."
"O- A nice ale, with overall great drinkabilty and decent complexity. A bit too boozy for the style. Looked very interesting at first but somehow i kinda felt like it was progressively losing flavour"
""
"A full flavored and full bodied English Ale. Above average for the style. I would love to have this on cask. The best beer I've had from this brewery so far."
""
""
"Poured a 3/4"" linen colored head. Pretty body in clear amber but it appears to exhaust all the carbonation into the head during pour. Smells of malt. Taste is malt, a little sweet, and there's a crispness usually in lagers instead of ale. Body is rich and creamy, quite nice. An unusual but very British bitter hoppy finish shines through. All in all a good beer, I'm just not sure what is supposed to make this elf a bad boy."
"Drinkability: I like this. I like this a lot. The cashier at the store said she liked it, too, so it is not very bad after all."
"O - This was really boozy and a little unbalanced."
""
"O -- Yes, I'd definitely call this an ESB. The maltiness up front, caramel and biscuit flavors along with a good balance of earthy English hops speak ESB to me -- and this is a great example."
""
"O - This was OK, but really felt like it left me wanting much more."

"I see this lineup every year and finally decided it was time to pick one up. Pours a light, clear, mahogany with an off white head. Head is fizzy, disappears quickly, and doesn't leave much lacing. Nose is spicy and bready, very seasonal. Taste is very malt dominated. Lots of bready malts with a nice roasted touch and a definite alcohol bite to the finish. Mouthfeel was a bit thinner than I expected. To sum it up it's a good, but not great beer. Glad I picked it up and I might again next year, or even try some of the other variations, if the mood strikes me. One thing I will give it is 7.5% will certainly warm you up on a cold winter night."

"Overall a very nice warming drink for the winter months, and at 7.5% i'm having a hard time writing this so good night!"

"Overall an average ale, nothing really stands out."
"D: This beer is extremely drinkable because the alcohol is well hidden and the bitterness is subdued."
"just kinda bland, I wouldn't pick up again."
" D- This beer didn't have much flavor at all and the dish soap flavor was very off-putting and made it hard to sip. The other flavors were very watery and just didn't see the point in finishing this beer."
"Rather drinkable, I'm finding that I'm liking the Ridgeway offerings."
"Drinkability - Complex and good enough in taste..not too filling and the aftertaste isn't too much to take."
"Tastes of toasty grains, sour citrus, and almost raisin like. Finishes with a light alcohol burn. Fairly plane ale overall, but still not terrible."
"D- Easy to drink but not that impressive. The ABV is okay but the flavor doesn't really jump out at you"
"a pretty good english pale ale, more on the bitter side than the typical pale ale."
"Overall not a bad purchase. I think our English brothers do quite well at brewing. I think it is enjoyable but perhaps not quite my style? First of this kind I have had."
"D: Easy to drink and well balanced. Alcohol is a bit hidden so this can work for a few in a row."
"Certainly drinkable - not overhwlemning, but an enjoyable start to the gift pack."
"Taste is caramelised raisin toast, toasty and raisiny with spiciness and a rather English leafy-fruity quality with spicey-toasty-raisiny quality up front followed by leafy sweet-sour fruit and a bittersweet raisiny finish. It's a bit interesting and different, and overall pretty good."
"I came back to the glass after about 15 minutes and when it was room temperature and had been in the glass a while. Better all around after some air and warmer. Prior comments still valid."
"Drinkability: Go on, friends, cram some Very Bad Elf into your mouth this holiday season. It's Very Okay and a notable notch above the lesser Bad Elf. Each year I avoid working through the Ridgeway Christmastime beers like I avoid mopping the linoleum kitchen floor but maybe, just maybe, I'll give'm a 'go' this winter."
"My first EPA - I guess they aren't for me if this is indicative of the style."
"Smooth, round mouthfeel. Caramel flavor with a pleasant hop finish. This is a malty beer but the hop finishes the beer for some balance. If I were blindfolded, I'd guess that this is a American Amber."
"Overall perception was that this basically tasted like a malty, roasted apple cider with alcohol. Has similar balance and taste to a cider beer, however, this beer possesses a malty, molasses-like backbone that renders the consistency a bit more syrupy and complex in the mouth."
"D: I enjoyed this EPA. I sort of expected a little more from a ""Special Reserve Ale"" but I was nonetheless pleased with how drinkable and light this was."
"Pours an auburn yet clearish body with decent carbonation and a 1.5 finger white head that slowly receeded w/ minimal lace. A mix of sweet and roasted malts along with light bitterness of hops (citric mostly) comprises the aroma. Thin to medium-bodied with a good citric/sharp fruit flavor and herbal hoppy bitterness. Balances with a good, sturdy malt backbone of bready and roasted malts for a slight chewiness and dryness, yet finishes with a smooth backbite. A sessionable EPA that is easygoing but refreshing."
"Has a Britishly fruit and malt feel to it. Very clean and fresh tasting, seems to be a well crafted beer....I like it, well balanced and tasty as it combines mild hops, fruit and malt flavors into a easy drinker with a good amount of complexity and hides the ABV well."
"...just give me a reason why...."
"Nikki"
"It pours a copper color with a small 1/2 inch foam head with not much in the way of lacing. The smell is dominated by the pale malts and buttery. The taste was malt dominated with a bitterness that stayed with you most of the drink. In the mouth it was semi dry. Overall not a bad effort for a EPA."
"Going through the Christmas gift beer. Pours bright copper, clear, with a thin off-white head. Smell is piney hops, oranges, and a whiff of something minty. The taste is malty, with nary a hint of the hops in the smell. Warm caramel, wood, and a slightly dry finish. Hops in the aftertaste. Good, subtle at first, then a bit more assertive. Mouthfeel is slick but substantial. Drinkability is good. A decent brew, nothing spectacular but very drinkable."
"This poured a clear gold with off-white head. It smelled like sweet yeast and caramel malt with earthy barley and copper hops. It tasted like light caramel and barley malts, with sweet yeast and mild copper hops. It was slightly thick with no carbonation, and had a mildly bitter aftertaste. Overall this had a pretty good and clean flavor with a bit more character than other Ridgeway beers. But it was still pretty basic. It at least had a good body and was easy to drink. Moderately enjoyable."
"Pours a golden amber color with a rich creamy head. I detected a sweet vanilla and honey aroma which was really pleasant. It has a caramel/honey flavor and is slightly malty. I really thought it had a great mouthfeel and drank very easily, leaving me wanting for more. This is a solid beer out of Ridgeway Brewing, one of my favorite of their line of beers."
"Notes - Not enough dry malt for my taste. None of the buttery flavor characteristic of the style. On the other hand, these guys make the alcohol taste good, which takes skill; but it's just not by kind of beer."
"I found this one to be a lot better than the Bad Elf."
"Well, this ""elf"" isn't very bad, but it's not ""very good"" either. Something of a bland, though not very might fit. Other than appearance, pretty mediocre-ish with a boozy touch in my opinion. A gimmick that is worth trying, but hardly worth repeating."
"Nice body, smooth and enjoyable to drink. I won't have a problem with this big bottle at all."
"Finish is warm, moderately alcoholic but nonetheless I find it very drinkable."
"It had been given to me in a gift pack and I was a bit concerned by the source but this is very pleasant surprise!"
"D: Nicley balanced malt and bitter. Pretty much a classic English bitter."
"I consider 'Very Bad Elf' to be dangerously close to very bad beer. I've always felt Christmas to be a time to celebrate 'the good' and this just gives me more reason to feel that 'the bad' has no place in this holiday. One thing for sure, I don't think there will be any place in my fridge for Ridgeway Brewing next season, baring of course they come out with a 'Better Elf'."
"D: decent all around but wouldn't drink this in multiples. There is some presence of its 7.5%abv with a sour tang on the finish but overall didn't find this particularly impressive."
"Nothing special, but enjoyable. There are better and worse beers to be had. Try it for yourself."
"This is an ok beer. It was ok to try, but I wouldn't purchase it again."
"The drinkability is not so great, just average. Theis is not a brew I would suggest to others. MK"
"thanks H+A! ... smell needs major improvement ... heads abit low for my liking ... golden copper in colour ... hides the abv quite well ... lacing is very nice ... smooth and drinkable but lacks that special something to make it stand out ... 'jiminy jilikers'"""
"Overall, it was ok. A better then average English ale, though I am just not that fond of English ales. I am sure there are better ones out there, though this was by no means terrible. I would be interested to see what the regular bad elf is like, but the taste just turns me off."
"Poured a orange amber color with a one finger white head with some standard lacing. Smelled of malts and some hops with a slight sweet fruit coming through. Tasted a little honey but mostly malt and some hops. This is the best out of all the Ridgeway Christmas beers. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a slight sweet creamy feel and not a lot of alcohol for being 7.5%. Overall I liked this one and even though Christmas was three months ago I still like this one for a cold winter night."
"A British Pale Ale at 7.5% alcohol? A very gorgeous medium amber color with a thin white head. Aroma of sulfur with a hint of orchard fruit and stale white bread. OK, not quite stale, maybe a dry biscuit baked in the early morning and still sitting on the table around 11am. The flavor and body is amazingly light for its strength. More fruit and dry, crumbly biscuits. I think I'm drinking a regular British Pale Ale here (regular in my case being the stronger 5% versions they send over here). A little alcohol starts showing through on the finish. I'll bet this would be a good joke to play on an English geezer - he thinks he is quaffing his 3.8% session bitter, but in reality is getting tanked off the Very Bad Elf. Now I know why this elf is so very bad. Like getting fooled by Belgians when they have you drink a bunch of Duvel and you think it's pilsner."
"Very tasty brew, glad I caught a break with a $3 cost for the 500ml."
"The right color, just no head at all. Nothing special looking abou this plae ale at all. The aroma is a straigt forward biscuit malt with some mild hopping. Good old fashioned English pale ale smell. Smells a little bit more sweet than others. The taste is a dry malt bill. Mayb like a scone ith a little drop of honey and small sprinkle of lemon witha room temp cup of tea. Pretty good for just a pale ale. Pretty warm for just a pale ale too."
"Overall a very solid beer for someone who likes balanced, complex flavors."
"Not as impressed as I was hoping but at least I can say I tried it. There are other beverages I would much rather pay $5.31 for."
"I got just a glimpse of the color; it is orangy or coppery. Aroma is not strong but malty and spicy, rather inviting. Flavor is mainly malty with some spice undertones, not strong or rich but still pleasing. This is a good party beer to sip while talking with friends or playing a game."
"Pours brilliantly clear orange-amber, with a small white head that lingers as a small collar of foam. Aroma is earthy English hops (Fuggles?), backed by butterscotch, hints of malt, and indications of higher alcohols, possibly fusels. Warming all the way down, the flavor is earthy English hops up front, quickly matched by some big alcohol that is not offensive, but not quite smooth. Tail is all crystal malt and butterscotch, with a faint hop note."
"Hmmmm. This beer really reminds me of something...oh yeah, every ridgeway brew! Very bad elf = bad elf with more alcohol in it. Pours an identical color. The nose has the standard ridgeway funk to it. Taste is of maltiness and runky almost rotten hops. The alcohol is the dominant flavor. mouthfeel is really thick and warming. The drinkability is not what i would prefer, i had trouble finishing the glass when it warmed up. Not really impressed with this line of elves. I prefer the gnomes of the ardennes."
"I would love sitting in a UK pub enjoying this beer-it's definitely good, but the hops really aren't my style."
"Poured into a pint glass. Slight copper/golden hue in the body and a nice foamy head that dissipates to a thin layer for the rest of the session. The fuggles come through in the aroma. The malt blend is strange to place and the rye make sense to be that unfimilar scent. The flavor is unsweet tea bitter. A great mix of clean and bitter. The body of the barley and rye gives a twang to the overall taste that does linger well after the sip. The body is a good medium. I would say that I will have this beer @ least once a winter season."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer was a reddish gold color and the beer also had a very nice head with very nice lacing qualities. The smell of the beer was a little nutty. I thought the beer tasted a little sweet to me and the alcohol burn was a little to much for my taste. Not a bad beer but I will not buy again."
"Drinkability: this is a fun drinking beer, both tasty and warming. One or two to close the night down on a chilly evening. I actually like the series' labels too."
"Nothing spectacular, but this brew is nice and well crafted. A nice english ale that I could drink for a session."
"Pours a clean orange-ish/ yellow color with a small white head. In the aroma, a malty alcohol presence. In the taste, a sticky malt and alcohol taste, with just a hint of gingerbread. A malty alcohol mouthfeel and a dry alcohol aftertaste. Big in alcohol and a sticky sweet malt. OK, but the name does more."
"Drinkability: Very nice beer in the English style; I'm quite impressed"
"D = This is a perfectly pleasant beer. I could imagine sitting back drinking this with friends. That said, if I decided I really wanted to drink an English Ale, this is probably not the one I would single out."
"Pours a nice clean/clear golden dark orange color, some carbonation, tiny fizzy off-white head, some little slicks and sticky lacing around the edges. The nose is mostly malty and lots of caramel. The taste is slightly sour/tangy, malty, and lots of caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, not a bad brew, but would not buy again."
"The beer evacuates the 500ml brown bottle a clear amber color with a demonstrative creamy off white head, as it erodes the lacing provides a fine sheet to obfuscate the glass. Nose has a rich malt aroma, sweet, hints of spices, nice hop tone, and citrus like in crispness. Front has a decent malt presence, slight bite at the back, moderate in feel at the top. Finish is sternly acidic, the hops perfect, sweetness ligers long with the dry aftertaste, also a bit of a tummy warmer at 7.50 percent alcohol, quite drinkable and IÂ’ve enjoyed all the beers from this series."
"Pours a clear copper color with a small egg shell white head that dissipated into a light cap. The smell is of caramel malt and some light leafy hops. The taste is of strong caramel hops with woody characteristics, some light leafy hops to balance out the brew. The feel is light and well carbonated, finishes crisp and balanced. An excellent EPA, good malt and hop balance makes this beer quite easy to drink. I'm surprised that this ale is 7.5% abv."
"I don't know why this hasn't been getting better reviews. It hasn't been rated bad, but this is one good Ale. There isn't much hop flavor, but that isn't really expected in this style. The %ABV is maybe a little high, but it's still a rather enjoyable beer. Recommended."
"Â·Drinkability: Enjoyed drinking this beer while trying to decipher tastes, could have used another one."
"Drinkability/notes: Pleasant and drinkable example, not bad."
"This beer poured a golden color with a one finger head Â– not very retentive. The aroma is spicy and floral. The taste is quite spicy and reminds me of evergreen. The malt is enough to keep it from being off balanced. The mouthfeel is medium bodied. Overall, this is an interesting beer that reminds me of the holiday season."
"The Very Bad Elf, came in a half liter brown bottle, and looked quite good when poured, with a clear, orange amber body, soft but steady carbonation, and a creamy, off-white head. The smell was very subdued, and was a little bit like soaked wood chips. The taste was sweet-sour and somewhat metallic. The hops were perfumey, and earthy. The flavors were not quite well melded, and seemed to present a discordant note from time to time. The mouthfeel however was quite good, with a creamy, soft, silky quality. This was obtained at a clearance sale from my local package store, and at that price it was a good deal. I am not sure I would ever pick it up for its own sake again."
"Was fun to try, and want to try the other character flawed ""Elf"" ales. Cool bottle and lable."
"Pours a two finger off-white head that fades to a thin layer leaving traces of lace. Clear amber color. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Hay and malty nose. Flavor malty, rusty raisins, not much bitterness, clean finish. $4.99 for a 500ml bottle from John's Grocery Iowa City, IA."
" I consider my taste and palate to be pretty sophistacted and well-rounded, since I started thinking about and reviewing the beer I drank. Even though this ale isn't my cup of tea, I'm glad that I got a shot to rate this. It's neither brash nor understated, and for the above-novice drinker, it's certainly worth a try once; if for no other reason, than to laugh at the name and enjoy the introspection within."
"D- drinkable but nothing jaw dropping, fun and enjoyable for the season, thats bout it"
"Cheers!"
"Poured from a 500ml bottle with no date into a pint glass. Had a slightly hazy amber color. With a hard pour there was about a finger of head that quickly dissipated with no lacing. The aroma was caramel malt and alcohol. The taste was alright just not very exciting. This is 4th beer from the holiday sampler and all four had been average at best. Great marketing, average beer. Skip this one and buy something better. (3.5, NA, Tie, O)"
"Pours clear copper / orange with no head and thin lace. Smells gently herbal with sweet caramel & molasses undertones. A decent dose of bitter pine and grapefruit hops on the tongue, but rather overwhelmed by bitter metallic alcohol. Finish is leafy and green with lasting alcohol warming. Mouthfeel is a reasonable combination of small-bubble carbonation and malt heft. Not an altogether successful beer. Making this pale ale stronger doesn't particularly help its character."
"Drank pretty easy a very good ( and bigger) take on this style. Except for the price, $6.50. I really dig this"
"Good drinkability,would be more drinkable if not for the tart,sour taste,which wasn't real appealing to me. Not a bad beer, just nothing special."
"Pours a clear copper amber color with a short off-white head that soon fades into a thin lace. Nose is quite fruity with additional notes of caramel malt and alcohol, which becomes more pronounced as it warms. Taste begins with a sugary sweetness along with some maple syrup and a bit of fruitiness (apple, cherry, and fig). Some mineral notes are also apparent. Bittering hops are present in the finish along with a bit of alcohol."
"Everything is good about this beer except the taste (and the elf, I guess). It's just not a very drinkable beer, in the end."
"Medium body, moderate carbonation. Balance seems off, and I feel like the aftertaste overly dominates the taste experience. Seems to have some of the same smell and tastes that a Christmas Ale might. Alcohol does produce some warming. As far as drinkability goes, it's ok, just doesn't have anything that makes me want to try it again."
"definitely not worth the price of admission. although i did gain another bottle with a label of an x-mas elf acting impish. cute."
"Drinkability: is hindered by alcohol."
"Notes: If you like the lighter English Ales like Boddingtons, you may like this. But for me it kind of leaves a less-than-ideal taste in the mouth and for that reason I wouldn't really recommend it for the taste -- there are plenty of better English Ales out there. However, the label and the whole series of Bad Elf ales makes it a decent ""novelty"" gift to bring to a holiday party, and it's really not all THAT bad a beer. . . ."
"Drinkability: very average at best. Bought it for a holiday party and friends were not overly impressed either."
"Not a bad beverage. Certainly is enjoyable. Sad to say, the bottle is the best part about this beer. Quite festive I do say. Worth a try but I will not purchase another one."
"Overall....definitely an English Ale....hits the spot nicely but certainly not an all-time great."
"volume 7.5%. Very good!"
"Lastly, this beer reminds me a lot of Geary's Hampshire Special Ale."
" Anyway, it pours a clear copper, very thin white head. pretty average. Nose is alocohol and grain, with some sweetness. Taste is more grainy corn and alochol. Mouth is actually pretty good, a bit foamy. Drinkability is just average."
"Cheers!"
"After just having the Bad Elf, this brew seems to have a very similar hop profile, showing big earthy and pine flavors and aromas. However the malt character shows much more caramel, amber, toasty, and malty characters. This seems to balance the brew much more than exhibited in the Bad Elf. There seems to be an added Christmas spice character that shows some nutmeg, cinnamon, and allspice. The body seems more firm with the bolder grains, but may be similar. The finish is a much more balanced blend of malts to hops. Even the extra alcohols seem equally well hidden as in the Bad Elf. Good brew, and I do prefer this one over the lesser Bad Elf."
"Very bad elf indeed. I'm tempted to upend this one into the sink."
"overall: a solid good beer, a great break from the double IPAs I've been drinking lately. The best english pale ale I have tasted (ok, so I haven't tried very many). Now I understand what Harp is trying to do."
"Very happy with it."
"Drinkability: Nothing to complain about, a very drinkable yet strong beer, I recommend it."
"16.9 ounce bottle. This beast was very ellusive. I searched for months to find it and got it yesterday so I could try the trilogy."
"Pours a 1.5 finger light tan whitish head over a crystal clear dark orange-gold liquid. Smells malty with woody coriander and a hint of winterfresh. Tastes malty wet, but not noticably sweet. There, but non-descript...like a store-bought apple. Some clovey phenolic with coriander. Kinda like a wheat beer. Md-light body and md carbonation. Sorry this review is so short, but there's not much to this beer."
"Overall I give this beer respect, but i dont think i will get it again.."
"Had this one very recently while visiting a few good friends. It pours a clear amber-orange color with a disappointingly slight head. The aroma is very fruity and herbal. ThereÂ’s notable apple and pear, with an slightly yeasty ale smell. A bit estery. ThereÂ’s also a bit of woody earthiness and subtle malt in the aroma. This is a moderately sweet beer, with a medium body and just a little carbonation. It works together pretty well. A nice hoppiness creeps in at the end, with a little spicy touch. All in all, this is a decent and quite drinkable brew."
"The taste is lightly sweet, and pretty light (almost watery) on the palate. The beer has a week finish that is a bit astringent, and perhaps even a bit vegetal. There is a definite fruitiness here that reminds me of currants, berries and a bit of raisins. I really can't get over the finish of this beer though, it is just bad, and downright un-enjoyable. I am definitely disappointed by this beer."
"500 ml bottle pours a clear bright copper color with a small off white head that leaves some lacing in my glass. Honey, lemon and apple aromas, nutty, caremel and apple flavors, medium bodied with a soft and creamy mouthfeel with some bitterness in the finish. Alcohol very well hidden and pretty damn drinkable."
"Notes: the name implies it should be ""bad"" as in good, but this just barely kicks up a mellow style and in the end the name ""very average elf"" comes to mind."
"Weak all around. Way too light and delicate of a beer to have an abv of 7.5%. The alcohol overpowered everything else. I paid $5.99 for this bottle . . . that's about $5.52 too much."
"Pours a clear amber in color with a white head that retreats to a surface covering. Fruity aroma that's matched with the scent of Fuggle hops. Hints of apple skins and roasted malt also on the nose. Soft, medium-bodied mouthfeel. Mild-mannered front has a pleasant malt flavor to it. Things shift quickly in the middle as the hop bitterness emerges. Sour apple, caramel and an underlying roasted malt flavor linger. Finish is slightly metallic and a touch on the dry side. The 7.5% alcohol is masterfully hidden. Although it will catch up to you by the end. Enjoyable and rather drinkable Christmas offering."
"Overall: An enjoyable brew to spend the night with, but nothing special, more Â“a little naughtyÂ” than Very Bad."
"Clear darker amber color. Pale head of about 1/4 of an inch in height and with a white hue to it. Dripping lace, attractive. Aroma seems fairly hopped with some apple skin qualities. Mouthfeel is in the medium range, carbonation on the understated side but still with some life. The taste doesn't match the aroma, it exhibits sweet pumpkin and squash, with maple, rather broad from front to back. Flattens at the back with some chalky bitterness and a light pine sense. Alcohol is decently hidden but asserts by the end of the Imperial pint glass. For all the fuss about Bad Elf labels for these beers, they really aren't particularly notable in defining characters for me."
"Copper in color with a medium tan head. A nutty, buttery, spicy aroma takes over. Some caramel is in there underneath. Taste is really strong on the nutty flavors. Some roasted nuts but really more of a salty nut flavor. Body is a bit thin and really lets this beer down from its potential. Light fruits and spices around but they never really come forth. A light buttery taste is in there as well. Mineral finish is not good at first but I got used to it and started to enjoy it towards the bottom of the glass. A cool label and decent beer but nothing too great."
"This is an odd, but interesting, beer. Very fruity, slightly sweet, with strong notes of apples and raisins. A pretty good alcohol kick finishes off this good holiday beer. Recommended."
"This went straight from the importer, to wholesaler, to retailer, to me within a fortnight. Old bronze, clear as filtered beer with a short, quick topping. Lemon and candy cane aromas brighten suggestions of date and fig pie. A sweet flood of flavor includes maple syrup, marischino cherries, cigar, whiskey-soaked lemon peel, hashish, brandied fruits and nuts. All intermix as if on a two-dimensional 'tablet' rather than a three-dimensional 'space'. Clean and clear. Satisfying roasted bitter nut tannins embrace the sweet finish."
"Sample from WFM. These holiday-gimmick beers always seem to be below average and this is no exception. Clear reddish amber with a thin off-white head and minimal lacing. The aroma is vaguely sweet malt and caramel. Medium bodied and a little watery with malt and fruit flavors. Some bitterness as well but it is distracting more than anything. The finish is metallic and lightly bitter. Not worth going back to."
"It's not Very Bad, but it's not very good, either."
"Pours a very light amber color with copper hues and just a tiny white head. A firm dosage of bready like aromas and spicy limey hops make up the nose of this beer. This beer is initially fairly sweet up front and then hits with a decent dosage of biscuity, pilsner, and bready like malts. The finish is fairly spicy with a sweet citrusy lime hop flavor that reminds me a lot of a classic pilsner. This beer is medium bodied and has a light body to it. Overall this brew in no way reminds me of a pale ale, and just doesn't hit the spot for me.."
"Has a hefe/tripple sort of nose with banana and cloves in the background, but a sulfery ester comes out up front. The sulfer seems to mellow over time, but it is still unpleasant. Its a solid copper color and thereÂ’s very little head. Very thin bodied. Pronounced alcohol flavor with some sweetness, caramel, light citrus. Very unbalanced flavors. I could not finish this one, down the drain it goes."
"Mouthfeel is not too shabby...I get a feel for the 7% alcohol it is offering right away and much of teh carbonation is burned away by it. Carbonation is a bit stingy when I first sip it but then the alcohol takes over and in a way smooths it out a little, leaving a slight alcohol tingle during the swallow. However, another example of a middle-of-the-road hoppy beer that leaves a little to be desired."
"Very Bad Elf isn't Very Good Beer, but calling it good doesn't do it justice. Even though I can't quite recall my bottle of Bad Elf from last year, it seems as though this more ill-behaved brother has upped the ante and is a better beer for it. If the pattern holds, we can only hope that Ridgeway continues to locate increasingly evil elves who brew increasingly beatific beer."
"This is pretty good, even is the non-""Very"" version was superior."
"Drinkability - tasty enough to have another, even at 7.5 abv, but the Bad Elf has more depth and flavor."
"This showed up as a rather gimmicky trilogy at my local store (along with Santa's Butt and Lump of Coal), and, of the three, I liked this the best. The flavor profile was somewhere between an English pale ale and an ESB. Sturdy caramel malt, with a touch of vinious alcohol in the background. Finish was a bit sweet."
"Poured a nice copper color with a frothy white head that stayed around for a bit and left some lacing behind. The smell was of some hoppy spicyness and sweet malts. The taste was excellent with sweet malts the beginning, fading into a nice bananna flavor, then finishing with a touch of alcohol. The mothfeel is very smooth, slightly carbonated and crisp. This is a pretty drinkable beer, I will be sure to pick up some more next time I see it."
"A deceptive beer with a higher abv. Nose was spicy (cinnamon?), malty and a tad fruity. Appearance was a medium copper with an initially nice head that remained as a coating of froth. Taste is different,,,lightly sweet on the front...alcohol in the middle,,,and and a nice hoppy finish. Mouthfeel overall is smooth and light to medium bodied...Drinkability is very nice for 7.5 abv...Has some winter warmer qualities."
"This one pours a copper color with a medium head that actually sticks around very well and leaves a bit of lacing on the glass. The aroma is mostly a very suble hop (Fuggles) that has a grapefruit character. The flavor is very nice and well balanced. It has a nice malt backbone, but this is a malt that I'm not familiar with. I like it. Finish is slightly dry. Oddly enough, this beer seems weaker than the Bad Elf. Perhaps they should swap the two labels."
"This beer pours a nice golden amber color wtih a finger of head that falls to a quarter inch over the top of the beer. The nose has a bit of fruity esters in it along with some light caramel. The flavor is really different from other beers I've had. Its similar to the nose, slightly caramel and a touch of artificial strawberry. The hop comes through on the finish. Overall a nice beer. The feel is moderate, just where it should be. Drinkability is just okay as well. The fruity flavors are not really what I look for. Overall an okay beer, but I liked the bad elf better."
"50 cl bottle. Pours a tawny copper color with a short, fluffy beige head. Aromas of amber malts, a touch of vanilla and some English noble hops. Malty sweetness mixed with some husky astringency that mixes nicely with the Fuggles and a lightly fruity yeastiness. Pretty nice, I think I'm a little more partial to the Bad Elf though. Worth a try."
"An English Pale Ale that almost drinks like a barleywine. Pours a clear amber color with little fanfare (not much foam.) Caramel malt and toffee aroma mixed with a faint whiff banana.The body is fairly full. Carbonation is low. The mouthfeel is a bit slick. There's lots of tawny malt flavors mingled with caramel malt and finally a smack of hop bitterness. The finish is fairly long and bitter. This is a very hearty ale that's a bit strong. It's not quite as complex as I would like it be, but it's not bad. I'd like a touch more fruitiness from the yeast."
"A clean dark orange/amber ale with an off white head. The aroma is mostly a citrusy hop aroma with a nice sweet malt background. The flavor starts out sweet malty then slides into a hop citrus sweetness and finishes with a nice smooth hop bitterness. The flavors, tho not agressive, get and keep your attention."
"Pours a reddish-orangish brown with a small head and little lace. Smell is sweetly sour, malt, fruit, bread and hops. Taste is more involved with flavors of smoke, peat, malt, grass, hops and a light caramel-like fruitiness. Mouthfeel is smooth, full bodied, rich. Warms the throat. Drinkability is high, light effervescence and slight hops bitterness. Good flavor & balance."
"finish- head dissolves completely after 5 minutes with some chunky lace left on the glass. taste fades into banana and the alcohol stays hidden on further sips. overall, a worthwhile beer for any time of the year."
"Drinkability is solid if not spectacular. Decent example of a Winter Warmer although could have used a bit more ""oomph"" and/or complexity, pretty one-dimensional."
"Last Christmas I got to try the Bad Elf so I figured I'd give the big brother a try this Christmas beer season. Appearance: Pours amber orange hue forms a decent sized head not very resilient leaves specks of lacing down my pint. Aroma: Caramel malt base with some warm biscuit notes as well, herbal flowery hops thrown in the mix doesn't strike me as really hoppy. Taste: Good mix definitely one of the hoppier English pales I've tried pine and flower flavors come of through the English hop dose nice malt presence pretty balanced for being Very Bad. Mouthfeel: Mild carbonation medium to light bodied. Drinkability: This one was worth a try glad I had a chance to imbibe not a beer that blew me away but solid hoppy English Pale."
"It's a new Xmas tradition."
"This beer pours a mild amber color with a thin head. The aroma is piney and slightly alcolic. The taste is full malt with some alcohol notes in the back with a slight hop aftertaste. Would have liked some spice or deep malt flavor for a christmas ale. Overall like a Bass beer, plus malt profile and alcohol."
"This beer pours orange/amber with a one finger head on the pour. It has no retention or lacing to speak of. The aroma is citrus/pine with hints of sweet malt coming through. There is a good malt base in this beer and you can tell from the first sip but its the spicy/piney bitterness in the finish thats most memorable. This is a hearty ale thats well balanced and I plan on picking up more of them."
