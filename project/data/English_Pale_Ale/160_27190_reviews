"Nice easy-drinking beer, very mild in all the attributes that I care for like hop-malt-yeast balance.  More bitter than aromatic, but still very mild by my palate.  Aroma was more bold than flavor, reminded me of a Belgian blonde in maltiness and yeastiness, but didn't deliver those notes on the flavor.  Mouthfeel was pleasantly light, and carbonation was medium-low.  Fans of bold ales may find this a bit boring, but it would be a good summer beer."
"Pungent aroma. Good taste for a Blonde Ale but a little bitter."

"Overall:  I like this beer.  Sure, as a blonde, it's not especially rich in character; however, it's eminently drinkable and low-enough ABV to provide a nice little session."
"An unassuming but satisfying beer—smooth and refreshing with considerable fruitiness and just a little sweetness and bitterness to keep things balanced."
""
""
"Pours a hazy golden yellow in color with about 1/2+ finger of a white fizzy head that settles down to just the top of the glass and sides. Some spotty lacing is seen. Perfect carbonation for this style of brew. The aroma is of hops right up front with some citrus and spice. More going on with the taste that what the aroma suggests with some caramel malts, hint of toffee and sugar as well. Slight bitter finish that doesn't last too long though. Lighter to medium bodied, Overall, it was decent."
""
""
"The taste is also jolly sweet (I say) with an overwhelming caramel and toffee note. Mild to low bitterness. Smooth to the end. Bangers and mash please."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: another fairly average beer from Wychwood. Not offensive, but very average for the price. It's over $100 a case of an equivalent case of 24 x 330mL, for what is effectively quite a boring beer."

"Overall a good beer with a bitter after taste. Amazing smell that was not entirely matched by the taste. A slightly refreshing beer that would pare well with a burger or steak. This beer is pretty much a solid 3/5 its not fanatastic but definitely not bad. Fairly recommended"
""
""
"O: This beer is easy to drink and goes down easily. It is rather flavorful for the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel - Medium-light body, high carbonation, crisp finish."
"O: Overall a drinkable beer but lighter than I anticipated."
""
""
""
"Overall – A good, mild thirst quencher, however I would considered one of their other offerings if you’re looking for something with even more substance."
""

"MB"
"O - A nice rendition of the style although to my taste it needs more carbonation and more flavour touches..."
""
"Very light hops, citrus, almost no after taste. Put this one in the freezing for 20 minutes, just started to ice up, took it out, poured and drank. Excellent super cold, very easy drinking. I would compare it to an ale version of a flavorful cold lager."
""
"Pours a cloudy light golden color. Smell consists of bread, mild hop, and a touch of citrus. Taste is more of the same, with the bread flavor quite pronounced and the hops adding a bit of citrus flavor, namely lemon. Mouthfeel is fairly thin but this is to be expected for the style, while the carbonation is on the lower end of the spectrum. The beer finishes dry and somewhat sticky. Overall, this is pretty standard. While the low ABV and simple flavors, it could make for a good session beer for someone looking for a dry and bready light brew."

""
"Remarks: Did not score A, T, S, M at that time; disregard those scores"
"Overall- A good, easy drinking beer. However, there is nothing that makes it stand out either."
""
"Pours a hazy light orange with a foamy white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and slight citrus aromas. Taste is much the same with grain and citrus flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer with a subdued but fairly tasty citrus hop presence."

"I'm trying to rate to style and if I was leaning more towards personal preference today it would score lower because I'd get board. That being said they made what they were attempting to make fairly well."

"O- easy drinking English ale, more flavor than some others that ice tried if the same style."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A beer that is meant to be highly drinkable and refreshing, and it succeeds at that. But it has no character, nothing really interesting. Still a pleasant drink though"
""
""

"O= This isn't a bad beer and actually is quite nice for an everyday drinker. The skunk is a little troublesome as well as a touch of the kitty litter that I have no explaination for. Anyways it tastes pretty good and while I prolly won't but it again I didn't think it was a bad beer."

"A good solid flavoursome easily available beer, what's not to like."
"This is not a bad medium ale. It is easy drinking and refreshing. Flavour intensity could be stronger but otherwise its not a bad brew. 3.5"
""
""
""
""
"O - Doesn't come across as a Pale Ale. There's Lager vibe to this one. Pretty average beer overall."
""
""
""
""
""
"I always enjoy the Wychwood labels....lots of detail. The beer, however, is a bit too one-dimensional. Hazy and golden in color, the beer has a slim white head. The aroma is grainy and grassy. Some subtle fruit notes are also present in the taste...a little apple and pear. The beer is balanced, with a sharp hop taste. The body is refreshingly light, with a moderate carbonation. It's a good beer, but it is also a very average light pale ale."
"Drinkability: It's a smooth drinkable beer accompanied with decent flavors and aromas."
""
"In spite of appearances, this actually ends well. Musty citrus hops put me in the mind of Citra. (Lager malt and Styrian, it turns out.) Aggressively refreshing, if there is such a thing."
""
"Not the usual high quality that I have come to expect from Wychwood brews, not bad none the less. Pours a peach color with a white medium fluffy head and citrus and grapefruit aromas, a little mild on the nose. A hint of sweetness in the flavor with some malt flavors coming through. Nice taste with a strong finish. Drinkable, with the signature English hops."
"That being said, this would be great on a hot summer day, and I'm quite enjoying it with my sweet potato curry"
""
""
""
"Pours a cloudy hay colour with about a finger and a half worth of foam, that slowly works its way down to a half finger. Smells of grains, citrus and a bit of grassy hops. Taste is primarily bready, with a bit of acid coming in with the lemon. Finishes dry and hoppy. Very light bodied, medium carbonated, smooth drinking ale."
""
"Overall -"
""
"O: This beer was all over the place for me. Seemed like a weird mix of a Witbier/Hefeweizen/IPA. Won't be seeking this one out in the future."
"Edit: Was looking over my reviews and it seems I now can give this beer a 2.75."
"Overall: could drink a lot of these! Is a great summer beer, refreshing and interesting"
"Goes down easy, very light in texture. I would have rated this a notch lower overall, but I've got to give credit to the great bottle and label presentation."
""
""
""
""
""
"M: Very smooth all the way through, leaves excellent mouth-coating, light bodied."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A HUGE disappointment! I struggled to finish the bottle."
""
""
"O - A tasty English Pale Ale, the earthy hops are nice, but it's still a tad on the mild side. By no means offensive, an easy drinking session ale."
""
""
""
""
"A dark golden colour, similar to apple juice, with minimal white head and no lacing. Aroma is very bready. Taste is less single dimensional, with malt / grain sweetness ending with a pleasantly dry finish. Bittering hop presence is what I would deem ""typically British", but overall a pleasant surprise. At 4.5% ABV, perfect for a Sunday afternoon!"
""
"O - I started drinking this beer when it was still a bit too cold, so I was not very impressed at first. Once it warmed up a little, I grew to appreciate it a little more. It's a nice refreshing and seemingly straightforward beer with an interesting hoppy twist to it. I have no regrets I bought it; after all, this is a Wychwood beer, and those guys don't know how to brew bad beer!"
"Drinkability : an average beer in the style English Pale Ale."
""
"O - all of the flavours and gentle but distinct and the combination adds up to a unique EPA that is very drinkable"
""
"A solid English pale... you're not likely to be disappointed, but on the flip side of that coin, I doubt you will be enthralled with it either. The 'thrice-hopped' bit probably hurts this brew's score more than it helps - I don't doubt its veracity because there's plenty of hop character, but a line like that engenders certain expectations that just aren't easy to satisfy in a mild, sessionable style like this. Glad I tried this stuff, definitely a satisfying ale I'd certainly drink again, but it's not something to seek out."
"Flavour - Clean and smooth malt profile with a solid streak of bitter, earthy hops. Flavours of buttered bread and herbs."
"Overall, a decent smelling English pale but the flavour is unbalanced. Unimpressive."
"Blonde, EPA, who really knows. At any rate this ale is quite enjoyable, and equally drinkable. A (baby) step up for hoppiness cause - 'cause it's Wyyyychcraft, wicked Wyyychcraft'..."
"A decent brew that was more complex than its first impression. Nevertheless, I have yet to fall in love with anything from this brewery."
"D: An interesting interpretation of the English pale ale that’ll no doubt please drinkers who like a big hop presence, but it felt excessive for the style. Otherwise, it’s an easy-drinking and exceptionally refreshing ale that’ll be best enjoyed while autumn’s warm."
"O-not bad, but I don't think that I will try another one"
"I don't think I've had a bad beer from Wychwood yet. This one doesn't have any real standout qualities, but makes for an easy drinking, bright and refreshing ale that works great as a meal accompaniment or session beer."
"Eventhough it is Fall and and I am trying to move away from summer ales etc I had not seen this beer in BC before so I grabbed a bottle. The colour is pure summer gold and I expected a lighter drinking experience. The nose is very complex with a brewery smell combined with light floral hops. The taste was surprisingly deep with lots of body and a strong malt backbone. It is a EPA that is light in colour only rather than the golden ale style which often suits patio fare. I will buy some more of these even as the nights get longer."
"A rather enjoyable Blonde Ale, and probably one of the better offerings I've sampled from Wychwood."
"Great beer in the fall to wash down after a couple Oktoberfest!!"
"Felt OK in the mouth, a little weak, but not so much so that it spoiled the experience. Good with dinner on a warm summer day."
"O - A fine beer indeed from the Wychwood brewery, I will grab this one again."
"Drink-  This was a tad too English AAl for me, couldve been a bit more tasty less malty."
"O. A nice light beer, nothing special but a good show."
"The pours a hazy, brownish-golden color with a white two finger head that dissipated into a thin filmy layer, leaving behind web-like lacing. The smell is mostly sweet, nutty malt with fig and a hint of lemon. The taste consists of bitter lemon that is smoothed over by some floral and biscuit flavors. The aftertaste is citrusy and slightly bitter. The beer is medium bodied with low carbonation and a moderately dry finish. I thought this would be better, especially at $4.69 a bottle, but it's still a solid session beer with delicate flavor."
"Not a bad beer overall, the smell is lovely but I feel the taste is missing something at the start. Decent session beer."
"Decent beer; a little subtle for my tastes, but a reasonable blonde."
"This brew is a lot like a traditional English ESB brew. The malts are there and are nicely balanced with the hops. Even thought this beer is triple hopped I wasn't able to taste it. The color was on the amber side which was nice. I would like to revisit this brew sometime."
"A decent blonde ale; would be refreshing on a hot day. The aromatic hop flavours are nice but could be a bit more prominent. Worth trying if you see it."
"Drink ability is quite easy drinking like water. I could have another one. Not a lot of alcohol in this one, maybe of that like in a light beer."
"Wychcraft is a study in balance. Hence I would study it all night."
"D - Beer is delicious and has some lower ABV to boast. Very good brew."
"A very good blonde ale and somewhat underrated on this site, in my opinion."
"http://abarwithnoname.wordpress.com/"
"Poured from a bottle, the beer presents with a standard yellow/gold color, with bits of amber in deep. The beer poured with a airy, thick, foamy head that disappeared within less than a minute of pouring. Very scant aromas of malt and citrus (?maybe). The beer tastes like a blend of a pale and a blonde. Heavy on the malt, with a stale tinge to the taste. The staleness persists in the finish, and the beer leaves a sour aftertaste. Easy to drink, but there are better things out there to enjoy."
"An average beer of no great offence."
"Bottle: Poured a clear golden color ale with a bigger then average foamy head with OK retention and some lacing. Aroma of light sweet malt base with unrefined grain and some light dry hops is not that impressive. Taste is also dominated by light sweet malt with unrefined grain and overcooked vegetables and some dry hops notes. Body is about average with good carbonation. The malt bill wasn't the most interesting and the hops profile not as deep as advertised."
"Simple but well balanced and good enough for a day-to-day beer. I like this."
"Nose is hops and grain with a hint of citrus. Decent enough, but nothing too special. Same tastewise. This beer skates at the edge of being interesting, but never quite breaks through. I'm liking the graininess of it, but needs something more. Better than your average macro, but that's it."
"Not a bad beer, just above average when compared to other English Pale Ales."
"Drink - Alright, there is nothing spectacular here.. but it still is a highly drinkable and somewhat flavorful beer. Probably not something I'd seek out again, but I'm happy I tried it."
"D: A solid offering from Wychwood. Not particularly recommended, but a drinkable (and overall enjoyable) beer."
"Mown hay, grass, lemon, a hint of oranges and apples, dry minerally bitterness in the finish. Just the faintest sweetness from a caramel malt, hint of that English yeast. Nice level of carbonation. Nothing too exciting here, pretty one dimensional but it has a passsable bitterness and enough 'uumph' to at least make it a pleasant pint and, if in a pub with this available, I certainly wouldn't snub my nose at it."
"D - A good EPA but the hops seem inapropriate. ABV is nice for the style but I couldn't have more than one bottle b/c of the hop profile."
"Wychwood's Wychcraft is neither trick nor treat: it is wholly consistent with this brewery's fair quality but underwhelming style. That being said, I reckon it's one of their stronger offerings and, while it's not the type of beer to cast spells over people, it is a solid, highly serviceable blond ale that fares better than most exported English milds."
"Drinkability: A very tasty and highly sessionable pale ale. I could definitely see myself having this one again."
"Pours a hazy, copper color. One inch head of a white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of dry hop, slight spice, hint of citrus, hint of yeast, and slight sweet malt. Fits the style of an English Pale Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of dry hop, slight citrus, slight sweet malt, hint of earthy malt, slight wheat, and slight yeast. Overall, good appearance, aroma, and blend."
"D- One of the best brews from Wychwood in my opinion. Very smooth and some nice hops. Not as hoppy as I'd like it, but it's pretty good for the price."
"D- It's very drinkable in the sense that it's quite bland. Wouldn't want another though."
"D- Pretty easy to drink, and a good all around beer for the most part. Sadly nothing really stands out and makes me remember it, and I don't expect to buy it again, but I'm satisfied drinking it now, and don't feel ripped off. Not a bad choice, but there are many better ones."
"d-Pretty drinkable. I like the Wychwood beers but I would def pick up Fiddlers Elbow or Hobgoblin over this one."
"A descent session beer but I couldn't see myself reaching for one of these over a pale ale on a hot summer day."
"Worth a pickup for the bottle design alone (as most Wychwood brews are). A little off in a few places, but certainly drinkable - smooth, decent taste, low ABV. Probably will pick up a few for Hallowe'en partying later next month!"
"The body is light but the mouthfeel makes up for it, crisp and tart are the buzzwords. It is astringent, even a little soapy, in the finish, and the lack of a real malt backbone makes this one ""pucker"" a little too much to be really drinkable: it's refreshing but it needs better balance."
"Mouthfeel is good though.. light and crisp with excellent carbonation. Drinkability, given the poor nose and taste, is hard to rate highly."
"Had again a year later and felt the same about it."
"D- low alcohol and great all around. i love this brewery. wychcraft is a great session ale perfect for the end of summer."
"D - Interesting take on the pale ale. Good sessio or summer brew."
"I don't like it. That all being said it's not Corona so it is n fact drinkable."
"Not my favourite from them."
"D - ok. But the corn flavors make me think it's more like an American adjunct lager. If you watch the average ratings of wychwood it seems like the are going farther and farther down. This is the 2nd of their beers I've had in a few years and the second time I've been disappointed. Has fame hurt them or are there cost cuts involved here."
"Pours a pale golden orange colour with thin white head and spotty lacing. Smells of citrus and floral hops with bready malt. Flavour has a small amount of bitterness with some sweetness. Nice smooth carbonation level. A nice English ale, but nothing too special."
"Drinkability: Goes down well and nothing is really bad here, however the flavor is pretty dull."
"Enough drinkability to finish off a 500ml bottle. Wouldn't spend money on another bottle, although I have a strange feeling this would be pretty decent on tap. Not sure why."
"D. Quite a good beer from Wychwood but I have to say it is my least favourite of their beers."
"Highly recommended! Nice complexity and lots of flavour and character to the brew."
"An all around decent pale ale, but not one I'll pick up again due to price and freshness issues I've encountered from lower strength English ales here in the states."
"Drinkability: This one goes down very easily. That aromatic ""cooling"" taste would be really nice on a hot, summer day. I could drink this one for a long time."
"Poured from a brown 16.9 oz. bottle. Has a golden color with a small head. Smell is of malts, a touch of hops. Taste is crisp, malts, hops, a bit of caramel, slightly sweet. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and is very drinkable. Overall this is a good quality beer."
"D - This is a pretty fine English ale. Very tasty and complex."
"A really nice beer to have from time to time, however I wouldn't drink it every day, just as it is a nice beer different from the norm. A great English Ale."
"Conclusion: Meh. This was alright. Not as good as their Hobgoblin by any means. It's got the bitterness of an American Pale Ale with an English yeast character, but I'm not sure the hop variety was really situated to this beer. Probably not one I'll revisit, especially for about 5 bucks a pop."
"Pours a very nice light copper/dark yellow color with some very nice head and decent lacing throughout. Very nice scent, mostly English hops (Fuggles I'm guessing, from the jerky aroma) with a nice malt backing. Good taste, a very nice bitter brew with jerky/egg hops and a nice malt body to sweeten it out. Goes down smooth and easy. Probably one of my favorite English standard pale ales."
"My pour produced two fingers' worth of a yellowish-white head that had good retention. Nose was mildly citrusy with an underlying yeasty pungency. Color was a deep gold with NE-quality clarity. Mouthfeel was medium with a combination with a mild hops bite combined with a mild banana-esterish flavor on the tongue. The finish was slightly biscuity, along with a hoppy bitterness. I would have to say that while this was an interesting beer, I just felt as though there were too many flavors involved with none getting to really shine. I have had better from Wychwood, so I am giving this a low drinkability rating."
"Overall: The mouth feel is a low carbonation, smooth, and creamy. The body of the beer medium and the finish is medium. This is a wonderful example of an English Pale Ale. Wychcraft has very nice flavors and is easy to drink. I really like this beer."
"Wychwood Wychcraft pours a spritzy peach colored brew under a disk of sticky foam. The nose is funky English yeast with floral and butterscotch notes. The flavor is mild light malts, the butterscotch notes again, and a bit of citrus and herbal hops off the back, notes of meadow. Mouthfeel starts round-ish, goes crisp, then dry. It's my understanding that the English Blonde style is sort of a flavor ghetto, kind of like our American Wheat or our Macro Lagers. This one seems a cut above, that it's got a little extra going for it, still pretty light, but with a a little something extra. A solid session brew, and like all Wychwoods pints, a sexy presentation."
"Drinks easy, I will see if I can find some of this fresh next year (pre-Halloween) & see if the hops can fight their way into the flavor picture"
"I really did like this beer, it is the definition of sessionable at 4.5% abv and with a solid flavor that won't fill you up. This was my first English Pale Ale experience, and I feel as if I chose a good one."
"D - Low ABV and high taste. This is one seriously excellent and supremely drinkable beer. I could easily put away 2L of this beer without blinking. Its great balance has officially turned me way on to English Pale Ales."
"D: Damn, I wasn't sure what to expect with this beer as I bought on a whim. I will definitely be picking up again if I can find it in the Metroplex."
"I detected malt in the nose first then a hint of hops. Tasted just ok with a hint of clove and bananna. Thinner than what I like and highly carbonated. It had a sour finish. It was just ok, but I am not planning on getting it again."
"Overall, I really like this beer and could drink it all night long. The bitterness and sweetness balance out very nice and the flavors work well together. The use of the citrusy hops is uncommon in an English style Pale Ale, but the meld between the malt and hops are very much signature English Pale Ale."
" I must be under a spell, 'cause i love this brew."
"This beer is a bit pricey, but well worth it if your looking for a great blonde ale that is well balanced. If you don't like blonde ales, don't bother purchasing/drinking it, because you probably won't like it and you'll regret spending the money on it."
"Not recommended."
"Overall quite a well made English pale, but needs more malt and body to support the hoppy bitterness."
"Drinkability is solid. This isn't a beer I'd drink all the time but its a solid beer, and worth your time."
"D - Drinkable."
"This is a very light, clean and refreshing beer. Goes down very easily. There are other brews that have the same lightness but pack more of a flavour punch."
"Not something I'll never drink again but nothing I'm gonna go out and have to have this second, probably could only drink 1 a night just not enough flavor"
"Great beer. This is the 2nd one I've tried from this brewery now and they're 2 for 2."
"D: A good drinkability factor, nice grain palate balanced nicely with the aggressive hopping. Good example by style."
"Overall, an easy-drinking and refreshing brew. It's not going to overwhelm anyone with flavor, but it was not meant to. Pretty solid English pale."
"Pours a cloudy golden yellow color with thin white foam head. Earthy hops dominate aroma. Not that bitter for a thrice-hopped IPA. Kind of bland and boring. Watered down with very little malt balance. I don't expect this to be as hoppy as an American IPA but since it is ""thrice hopped"" I thought that it would have a little more bitterness and character."
"Overall: just ok. Not something I would buy again. There are much better english pale's out there, don't waste your time or money on this one."
"A solid brew and a nice English Pale, though I probably won't be seeking it out in the future. I expected the hops to have slightly more presence. The citrus characteristics mentioned in the brewer's note are certainly there, but ""a counterpoise of bitterness"" seems - to me - to be something of an overstatement."
"The taste is light, zesty, very fruity with apricots, lemon, bready-grapey sweetnessn and a dry, leafy finish with some citrus. It is lightly sweet, with the light tartness and slightly stronger bitterness balancing, the bitterness slightly taking over in the finish. It's highly refreshing and very tasty, a good alternative to something like a kolsch."
"Now on to my useless design review portion. Frankly, the bottle design and name are a good effort but ultimately silly. The medicinal flavor almost fits with the theme. I guess witches might make a cough medicine potion on less dramatic days. I imagine Wychcraft more as a spiced beer, but I digress. Anyway, the design seems targeted to women, which, of course, isn't a flaw in and of itself but comes off a little cheesy here. I would place it on the Wiccan end of witchiness (probably why I think it's somehow effeminate, so maybe it's more just an feminine aesthetic rather than really marketed to women), which isn't an aesthetic that I particularly like. Also, it's an expensive beer and I wonder how much more it costs them to use custom bottles. I feel like I'm paying for the packaging, rather than the beer."
"Light/medium bodied, smooth and very drinkable. A bit more hops than typical English Pale Ale but that's not a problem. Well worth a try anytime."
"Comes out of the bottle a slightly hazy golden amber with a white and frothy but not too persistent head. Aroma is crisp and malty and has a little bit of a nip to it. Flavor is rich and malty with hints of fruit and just a teeny bit of hoppy bitterness. Texture is very smooth so it goes down the pipes like a happy kid on a water slide. Not spectacular, but a good fall brew."
"A pretty decent English Pale Ale. A nice change of pace. Worth a try."
"Good English Pale, but nothing special."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not filling at all, mild kick, very good representation of style, this is a very nice beer to drink for a long time if you want a lighter session beer with a lot of flavor."
"Overall this is unlike any other English ale I've tried previously, but characteristic of the style it is very, very drinkable. An interesting brew that I might just try again if it weren't for the nearly 5 dollar price tag per half liter bottle."
"The label describes Wychcraft as a blonde beer combining the four elements to ""create a truly magical brew"". Wychcraft pours a fantastic amber colour, with a nice head that doesn't fade too quickly and leaves some slight lacing down the glass. The first thing which hit me was a very citrusy smell, probably from the fact that this is ""thrice hopped"" - eventually that citrus would define itself more clearly as a combination of grapefruit, lime and marmalade, getting sweeter as time went on. There is a nice refreshing tartness to the beer, and having been hopped three times, hops are clearly at the forefront of both nose and taste. With such a citrus element to the beer it is unsurprisingly zingy on the tongue, although I found it left a slight catch in the back of my throat. In general though it is a nice refreshing beer I could happily imagine drinking in a beer garden over a Ploughman's lunch."
"Drinkability: This is an OK EPA; there are better ones out there, but with the exchange rate these days, I always worry about getting an old beer"
"overall an average beer that is drinkable."
"Hops dominate this rather dry brew which reminds me of white wine without its pear juice quality, albeit much better because this is beer after all! Whatever malt is present here is very much in the background, creating a very slight biscuity flavour, but the dominating yet not hugely bold hops render this beer rather herbal with a slight citric hint. I quite like this as a one off but the hops aren't big enough to wow me (as in say a top quality pilsner) and there isn't a lot else going on: not bad but definitely not a session beer for me."
"Dorothy, Cindarella, and Snowhite, crouching on all 4's...expecting delivery. They all ask for it light and safe. I comply and get it overwith. So its a great tasting PG-13 night, complete with corn and hop fizz. A perfect subsitute for water. Wychwood after running a race, Wychwood for taking a bath. I think she's lying...she's a Pilsner fresh outta church. Unfortunately I'm on the move; I'll be slopgoblin her older sister the Hogoblin; hopefully she doesn't tell her parents."
"D - Great for a session. Middle of the road alcohol lends itself to this."
"When poured into a Sly Fox imperial pint glass, this Wychwood beer is a lighly hazy golden tangerine orange with a 1 1/2 inch fluffy head of white foam. It had OK retention that manage to leave behind a small bubbly film, foamy white rings, and a fair amount of white spots of lace. The aroma started off fruity, but as it progressed, it gets toasty and lightly hopped with toasted biscuit malts, a hint of barley, and a touch of grapefruit and citrus hops. The taste starts off lighlty malted with toasted biscuit malts, but then finished up dry and slightly bitter with subtle grapefruit and citrus hops. The mouthfeel was light bodied with a dry and lightly hopped aftertaste of toasted biscuit malts and citrus hops. Don't be fooled by the label. It says that it's triple hopped. If it is then it sure doesn't taste like it. I guess it was triple hopped for an English Pale Ale. In the end, it's not a overly malty beer or an overly hoppy beer. It's just a nice session English ale."
"D: A good starter and I'm glad to be adding more to my english beer pedigree."
"D: I'm not a huge fan of English Pale Ales, but this one was very nice."
"I probably won't go out of my way to try one again, but I wouldn't turn it down."
"Drinkability: easy-drinking, good"
"Pours a cloudy almost orange color with a small white head that dissipates quickly with little to no lacing. Malty citrus aromas. Sweet honeylike up front which becomes smooth and hoppy with a lemony, tealike finish. Medium carbonation leaves the mouth feeling cleansed. Interesting aftertaste makes this a nice, drinkable beer."
"Plenty of malt in the taste, really making the beer go. It's very crisp and clean but not flavorless by any stretch. Occasional bursts of hop bitterness emerge now and then, particularly near the finish, but this to me is a malt-driven brew, and a good one. The crisp, smooth taste makes the mouthfeel quite nice and the drinkability very high. Easy on the palate, this is easily one of the best from Wychwood."
"This is a fine English Pale. The beer pours a nice coppery golden color with a nice slightly foamy off white head with a nice lace and retention. The smell is a bit musty hop very typical of the style and a bit bready malts. The beer is moderately carbonated and tilts towards a lighter body. The taste is nice bready malts, some citrus notes, and a bit of a pepperishness in the finish. This is a refreshing beer that does have a bit of citrus spritz to it in the backbone. As mentioned by other reviewers, there ""ain't much hop in this beer"" assuming that it has indeed been thrice hopped. Overall, this is very drinkable, relatively low ABV beer. The only down side is the aftertaste which lingers a bit long, and is where some unpleasant hoppiness does emerge. The mouthfeel is little watery in the finish as well. This is well worth seeking out. L'Chaim."
"Mouthfeel was smooth with a raspy finish. Medium to lighter bodied. Overall very drinkable."
"Cost: US$3.99"
"Drinkability: Surprisingly nice. After careful consideration, I have decided this to be a fine, refreshing English ale."
"The beer pours a gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a weak pale malt scent along with an excellent noble hop aroma. It's light and refreshing. The taste is decent. It has a watery pale malt flavor that goes down likw water and finishes clean with a mild hop bitterness. It says it's thrice hopped. It can't be hopped with much at each interval. The mouthfeel is decent also. It is a low bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This looked like an interesting beer, but it's a big let down. Don't get me wrong. It's a fine English pale, but it's not a hoppy beer at all."
"This is a really drinkable ale, just about what you would want from an English Pale Ale. A great session ale too. Unfortuneately, even though this one is pretty good, it's probably past its prime after coming overseas. I would love to try this on cask in England. Recommended."
"A cloudy pale yellow/orange colored beer. Has a very small white head that vanishes quickly. Even though the head appears to dissappear it still leaves a little lace. There is a light sweet aroma of herbs and lemon with a background perfume like note. The taste has that herbal/lemon character all over it. Reminded me ever so slightly of a Ricola cough drop. Some more of that perfume like note just before a nice little bitter bite at the back of your tongue."
"Pale amber, small but dense white head, hazy. Aroma is a nice malty, toasty, bready character, with hints of earthy hops in the background. Flavor follows through nicely with the rich malty character, with toasty and malty notes. There is a slight sharpness , but not bad. Thanks goodness they switched away from the clear bottles. This beer has no skunked character at all. Mouthfeel is a little thin, with some astringence."
"D = Tastewise this is not among my favorite English pale ales. It is good but not great. However, it is quaffable and at this low an ABV could be a great session beer."
"A very nice English Pale Ale with the hops a bit more noticable. It's quite refreshing and enjoyable. I'll probably pick this up again -- definitely worth a try."
"D- A solid all-around pale ale that borders on ESB territory, I can find no major faults here, but at the same time nothing too exemplary, well-balanced and easy to drink (definitely sessionable), overall I'm pleasantly surprised"
"This beer poured a golden/orange color with a quickly disappearing thick, rocky head. The aroma is hoppy and floral with a hint of spice. The taste is also a slightly floral and sweet. The hops are noticeable. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and works quite well for this brew. Although this isnt an intensely flavorful brew, its balance and ease of drinking make this a good choice."
"Light to average in body. Malty aftertaste, with camomile, herbal. Quite dry."
"From a 16.09 oz bottle, poured an amber / copper color without a head... Nice darkish appearance that was appealing... Smell is very hoppy... not overpowering, but certainly enticing... Tastes really good, with a nice citrus flavor that is hoppy but not bitter... This has a nice, crisp, refreshing taste that was easily drinkable with a good mouthfeel... I could definitely down a few of these, and like most Wychwood brews here in America, it's too bad I can't find this one in a six-pack, because I would certainly buy it again... It sucks having to pay almost four bucks for a bottle, but all in all, it's definitely worth a try... another good sample from the Wychwood brewery that is certainly recommended..."
"Pours a medium copper-yellow, with a good sized off-white head which lasts quite well, though it leaves little lacing. Smell is alright, some hops apparent, though a great deal of caramel and diacetyl shows as well. Some dry breadiness as well. Taste is along the same lines, quite malty and with the ""thrice hopped"" tagline not particularly evident. Still, a bit of the Goldings do come through alongside the crackers and caramel. Butter in the finish. Mouthfeel is substantial and well carbonated, and drinkability is very good. Not a bad beer at all, and the brewery's best offering as far as I've seen. Still, nothing overly special."
"Pours a cloudy pale color with a one finger head. Aroma is biscuity and malty upfront with a faint hint of fruitiness. Taste is biscuity upfront and then fades into a slightly sour aftertaste with malt on it. It has most of the characteristics of an English Pale Ale but feels somewhat unrefined and rough. Still very drinkable and I have to give it props for that. Smooth as well and the aftertaste is biscuity/bready."
"Very thin, not really hoppy. this is expected from Britan. Much like St. Peter's. it's like a light ipa. 4.5 almost makes it sessionable. Not a gateway brew either. It has good quality, just not my cup of tea. I suppose as an american I prefer something much more hoppy. I'll taka a Burning River PA, or FFF's."
"Wychcraft pours an orange color with hints of red with an off white head that laces nicely from a brown custom half liter bottle. There is a light malty aroma. The taste is mostly on the malt side, but very nice, biscuit, maybe a hint at caramel. There is a touch of hops, but it seems pretty subdued to me. A bit of butterscotch that is appropriate and pleasant. A pretty enjoyable English Pale Ale. I'd have another."
"I was impressed by this English brewery's Hobgoblin brown ale, and their Wychcraft pale ale is a very nice follow up. I'd liek to try and find more styles from this great International brewery."
"Neat bottle! It is a burnt orange color in the glass with a thin, off-white head which lingers despite its lack of volume, and leaves nice lacing. Its nose is subtle, mostly consisting of hops, raisins, and metal. The flavor is exceedingly complex with many different phases...this could be difficult to describe... The hops and raisins really come through brilliantly, and the metal element backs it nicely. It is a hearty beer, and an excellent choice for the present season (fall). This is really worth trying, my friends."
"Drinkability is very nice. Good craft quality thats not the norm while the abv is low to go with anything. The medium bodied brew that won't get in the way."
"I feel very ""meh"" about this beer, and will probably not try it again."
"D- Although this beer has some dry crisp lager qualities there are some nice malt flavors with some depth and a good hop profile."
"Drinkability: Would be very easy to throw a pint or two back with problem. Would buy this beer again."
"Drinkability- Nice beer with a lot of good flavor."
"A pricey yet good ale without too much of the butter flavor that you come to expect from a Wychwood beer and Ringwood yeast strains. Worth a try for sure but I can't really see reaching for this beer again because of the cost. For less money I will be reaching for the Lagunitas and Firestone beers for normal consumption."
"This is a good neutral English ale that should offend no one. I wouldn't necessarily place it in a flight, but I wouldn't be disappointed with it as an option at the local pub."
"A nice pour, with a fading head leaving plenty of lacing on the glass. A much more noticable hop flavor then other beers from the brewery. Drinking back to back w/ scarecrow gives a nice lesson of the flavor of Styrian vs. Target hops both are noticable in the smell and flavor. While both allow the hop to be the centerpiece without being overpowering, the Wychcraft has a much stronger hop character. But with an easy finish and a pleasant rocky after taste. A much more easy drinking alternative to ""tons-o-hop"" beers popular in america."
"Golden straw colored with a nice head. Oily hops are very noticeable in the taste and smell but never really assert themselves. There's an initial bready characteristic followed by a sweetness as it warms. This is a very pleasant beer that I could certainly drink in large quantities. Though it's not all that exciting, it is the kind of beer you wouldn't mind drinking all night."
"D: Expected more of a hop bomb, but this is actually quite balanced and enjoyable. Granted, there's room for some improvement, but for the most part, this ale satisfies and does the job."
"This beer pours an amber color with a medium head, nice retention and leaves plenty of lacing on the glass. The aroma has quite a bit of sweet caramel along with a nice dose of English hops and some fruitiness. The flavor has plenty of hop and fruit flavors with a fairly solid caramel malt backbone. The fruity, hoppy flavors linger on the palate long after drinking. The body is moderate and the drinkability is good. Fairly smooth drinking here."
"afterthought: the head on this one is probably the best i've seen for a beer this light. good amount, no lacing, dense, creamy, frothy, and pure white. great!"
"A nice change of pace / conversation piece."
"Standard English pale ale. Amber colour with a white head. Nothing out of the ordinary. Malt nose with a bit of hop bitterness. Hops are a bit more pronounced in the flavour, but the malts still demand some attention. Carbonation is decent, and this is a good session ale. By no means is this the best EPA I've had, but I've had worse."
"The mouth is light, but shows pretty good complexity, though the grainy, metallic finish is a bit much. Rather drinkable--solid, but nothing spectacular."
"D- definitely give it a try, good for sitting around watching tv, i could go for another one"
"Another decent ale from Wychwood."
"Pours a two-finger white head that fades quickly to a thin layer leaving some lace. Clear amber color. Piney nose. Light-medium carbonation and light bodied. Flavor is almost sweet, some hops at finish but nothing that will rip your face off - the ""thrice hopped"" must be a marketing label. $4.10 for a 500ml bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
"It's good for a session brew, so it is pretty good in the drinkability department. But I was honestly disappointed with this Wychwood offering. The other brews for Wychwood are far better than this offering."
"A nice ""sessionable"" ale with a good amount of hops for the style."
"Notes: It was enjoyable as are most every beer I've ever tried but it was forgettable."
"Burst of English hop flavor, not too bitter but an involved hop interaction: Styrian and Fuggles blend, never competing, no bitterness left. Easy drinking pale ale finishes dry, a little bready finish with the yeast and pale malts cleansing the palate. Very delicate, nicely done, will stand up to flavorful dishes without overpowering simpler ones. Terrific for the style."
"Overall, a mellow hop oriented British pale ale with some reasonable bite."
"Overall, a decent beer, but nothing to write home about. I'd consider this a good session beer. It's good enough to sit and think about a little bit, but it's lackluster enough to just drink and enjoy with friends. Seeing as how it's a british beer, I guess that's most of the point. I'm glad I tried it, but I don't think I'll be buying it again."
"Pours an amber orange, with a thin white head that disipates rather quickly. There's not much of an aroma at all. The taste is delicate (to be polite) or underwhelming, depending on your preferences. There's a slight presence of hops, but the taste has a slightly disconcerting ""perfumey"" quality that takes away from the ale flavor. Maybe I'm spoiled by IPAs, but this didn't seem to be that great. I won't remember it a week from now. It had a cool bottle, though."
"D - An easy drinking, flavorful ale. Easy to session, but it would be hard to do in the US, as I have never seen this on tap, and it would be a little steep to buy a few bottles of this import. Dryness is well-crafted - enough to keep you wanting more, but not so much to make it puckering and astringent. An interesting ale to sample - much different than the common American Pale Ale."
"Poured a semi-hazy orange with a thick beautiful head that was slow to diminish and left great lacing. Aroma was of some pale malts and mild hops, not all that much to it. Taste was just slightly off-balance on the hoppy side, in a good way. It was not overpowering at all like an IPA, but very pleasant and mild, with just enough of a hop bite that people that don't like IPAs should enjoy this one. The mouthfeel was good and light, very easy drinking, not too carbonated. This is an enjoyable beer,just a little pricey as most Wychwood beers are here in America."
"From a 1/2-litre, this poured with a shiny orange-copper color with a rocky head ... is this an Englishman impersonating an American? The aroma almost says yes ... sweetly hoppy and inviting. In the first swallow, the endeavor slows ... this is much maltier and biscuity than its American cousins. indeed this dry, subtly balanced is elegantly balanced ... the hops are penned in, but ready to rumble in the background of this excellent beer. (#2699, 2/13/2007)"
"Slightly hazy golden orange with hints of red. Nice foamy ivory head. Nose is a nice amount of hops with traces of pine and sugar. Taste is gentle but good hops, with a bit of biscuit and malt at the front. Mouthfeel is good, Drinkability is high. Pretty good brew all around, but no particular feature stands out."
"A nice uncomplicated English pale ale. I still prefer the Goliath, though."
"500ml brown bottle from Ron's in Farmington. Translucent amber body with almost no head to speak of. Smells very hoppy - bitter and citrusy - with hints of malt. Tastes hoppy - somewhat citrusy and bitter - with some malt backbone. Flavor is a little more watery than one might expect. Still, what flavor there is a rather good. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium-bodied, somewhat watery. Very drinkable. What flavor there is is impressive, but not as strong flavored as it could be. I could see myself having this one again."
"Notes: I'd like to see this one hopped up and turned into an English IPA. That'd be interesting..."
"Brew poured a nice copper gold color with a vanishing head and no lacing to speak of. There was a strong aroma of hops, some slight euro maltiness and esters. The taste was of flavorless and unidentifiable hops with a bready malt note and a bitter aftertaste, again with no flavor. Very watered down ale, with hardly any distinguishing flavors. Drinkable only because it is so inoffensive."
"Did Wychwood use witchcraft to brew Wychcraft? Quite possibly. How else to explain how it stands head and shoulders above the rest of their offerings? Anyone looking for a classic English pale ale could do worse than to start right here."
"Clean and sharp but a little bit boring for me"
"500 ml bottle."
"Pours transparent gold with an inch of foamy off-white head that dissipates quickly to a film and very good lace. In the nose, the beer is dominated by herbal bitter hop notes and mild toasted malts. Strongly hopped flavor for an English pale ale. Light malts lead the way, and are quickly followed by bitter herbal hops. The finish is medium-dry with touches of toasted malt and vaguely unpleasant skunked notes. Body is very low in carbonation; creamy and easy-drinking but a bit thin and unsatisfying. Much fresher and better than the worst Wychwood beers (I'm looking at you Scarecrow). Not a standard-setter by any means, however."
"500 ml brown bottle, ""thrice hopped", courtesy of Cardinal pub, Stavanger. ABV is 4.5%. Golden colour, with a slight haziness (due to cold temperature?), moderate head. Nice hoppy / grapefruity aroma. Pleasant hoppy / grapefruity flavour too, spritzy mouthfeel. Distinctly bitter finish / long aftertaste. Not bad!"
"""Thrice hopped"" per label,poured a nice medium clear golden with a well formed but quick to vanish bone white head.Muted aromas toasty malt and a little caramel biscuit with a hint of ""green"" hop,more subtle but very pleasant flavors lightly sweet and biscuity up front with a nice drying herbal lingering finish and I mean it lingers I noticed a little medicinal quality as well.I lighter EPA with good flavor packed into it its a quaffer no doubt,I recommend it."
"Mouthfeel is light and very smooth. This may not bring a power punch to the flavor but this is a delightfully balanced and delicate beer. I would gladly session this over and over."
"A fair brew, nothing exciting, nothing too boring. Pours a rusty, clear color with some head, little lacing. Smells lightly hoppy and malty, not much there though. Tastes a bit like Bass, more biscuity and bready. Mouthfeel is bubbly enough but a little on the thin side. Quite drinkable, really refreshing. A great session brew, but a bit pricy. I'd probably pick Bass over this unless the price lowered."
"Three bucks for a half liter makes this not so great of a deal; for the money I'm more likely to pick up a Bass, but this is solid stuff."
"Clear and orange, a big head that goes away real quick. Nose is surprisingly more malty than hoppy. Has some alcohol, spice, and apple as well. The taste has more hops than the nose, but otherwise mimicks the nose. Additional sourness, with a slight green hops finish. Has a crisp mouthfeel."
"500 ml bottle with great image and packaging. I like the shape and feel of the bottle in my hand. The label says that this is a thrice hopped golden ale. I was different than most of the other Wychwood ales, except Scarecrow, being that it was lighter and easier to drink. I like the ligh mouthfeel, but you still feel and taste that typical English maltiness. This beer will be easier for most people to drink due to it's lighness. It was not overly hoppy, but pleasent. I likes the light malt flavor. The smell was clean and balanced, plus I did like to golden color of tye beer in my Hobgoblin glass.It was not my favorite Wychwood beer, but I would definately buy it again."
"Other comments: Another OK-but-not-very-interesting beer from Wychwood."
"Recommended by a Marrika's bartender. It took one sip to agree that this guy knew what he was talking about. This is one terrific beer. A solid English Pale malt brew with emphasis on orange and appricot flavors and aromas. A series of healty hoppings of English hops lends a supurb balance, juicy fruit flavors, and appealing earthy aromas. Ripe and fresh flavors and aroma abound. Medium feel and remains firm throughout. Finishes with a nice blend of fruity sweetness and hop flavor / bittering. A true English IPA and the best beer that Wychwood makes."
"A lovely example of the style. Poured a clear golden straw colour with a pure white foamy head that lasted about 40 seconds. Smell was very mild botanical, dry earth, and faint malts. Everything was very gentle, and this seemed to carry over into the taste, as well. Finish was a nice pleasant dryness. A tiny bit biscuity, and definately bitter. I simply love the English style ales such as this, and this is a wonderful example of the style. I could drink this al day long. Great name and great lable, too."
"Pours to a bright copper color with thick white head that lingers throughout, and slowly diminishes to a white foam cap with excellent lacing. Aroma is very hoppy, with some citrus, but not real strong. Flavor is very tasty at first, but fades in later sips, for this thin bodied beer. The finish is bitter, as expected with this much hops, but there is neither malt nor alcohol to help temper this, and so the finish is not what it could be. Not bad..not great."
"Decent beer. I would prefer it if it had more malt character."
"D - Above average, but nothing interesting enough to make me want to revisit it any time soon."
"M&D: pretty lively on the mouthfeel throughout, though I'd say it's a touch too fizzy for a mild-flavoured English ale; however, the texture does benefit from the ending touch of soft bitterness and plenty of hops, thus making this a rather light, refreshing bitter to quaff. Not that interesting and exciting, though."
