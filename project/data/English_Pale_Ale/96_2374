The smell is rich with grains and malts. There is also a hit of sweetness in the smell of this brew.  The taste is rich with flavor.  You pick up on the sweetness at the end of this brew.  The mouthfeel is rich, smooth and refreshing. I like how this brew goes down smooth, with no bad aftertaste. Single Chair Ale has a nice balance to it, there is nothing overpowering in this brew. Magic Hat Brewing Company did a nice job with this brew.  Overall I'm giving Single Chair Ale 4.5  out 5. I would buy this brew again.","nicholas2121","Mar 05, 2015"

Smell was grassy and musty. Taste was adequate, with enough hops at the very end to give this beer a slight kick of flavor. Decent amount of malt lends the beer a fairly good base.

I found it to be interesting that they were nearly the same brew in my opinion. I like #9 and I found Single Chair to be good also.

Flavor wise it's a clean biscuit malt profile hints of herbal/earthy hops with a fruit malt driven light golden ale, pretty unoffensive at it's core. A beer I've never tried from Magic Hat and I've been trying their offerings since the early 2000s. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied sturdy carbonation somewhat creamy texture to it especially for a straight forward golden ale. Overall a decent easy going drinking beer that should be looked at for pure simplicity of the flavor.

Let's make that for the taste as well, a really bland tasting pale that's bordering on adjunct with a semi rice thing going after time. No citrus at all, nothing, Im not joking. No really. This tastes like all of MH's other light offerings, I guess it's the yeast, well their yeast strain sucks. The feel is light bodied and carbed pretty well with a slight crisp on the tounge so it's got that going for it. The drinkability suffers because this is not good, but i drank it, because i paid for it. I wish I got a bottle of this, it would of been the same thing with less carb.

Apparently the recipe changes every year - This was the first one I've had, so I don't have others for comparison, but I'd swear they used some kind of fruit this time. It screamed of raspberries. The raspberries were right up front, tart and sweet, followed by an extremely crisp and corny aftertaste. It was so corny that I would have thought it a lager if I was not informed prior.

The only thing that troubles me about this is I wish it was a summer release instead of winter. I can picture myself drinking this out in the sun at a barbeque or what-have-you instead of couped up inside. The taste itself was at first of ginger and spices, and then softened up to a smooth finish.
