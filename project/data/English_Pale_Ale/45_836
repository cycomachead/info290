The taste backed up the aroma with a nice caramel malty flavor with just a hint of sweetness in the finish.  The mouth feel was rich and the carbonation level very good.  I would recommend this one to any fan of English style pale ales.","Retroman40","Aug 15, 2014"

Nose is watery, with notes of corn. Tastes like it couldn't decide what it wanted to be when it grew up: an English ale? A pint of Yeungling? As other reviewers have noted, hop and malt characteristics are poorly matched, as if someone had blended a so-so lager with an ale. Although some of the characteristics might have been likeable in a more balanced beer, it's less than the sum of its parts. I did not enjoy it at all and would certainly not try it again.","jps0869","Jul 08, 2014"

The flavor was not as complex as other pale ales, but what it had was quite enjoyable. An extremely sessionable ale, as it is refreshing, goes down smooth and leaves you wanting more - plus the relatively simple flavor means you won't miss too much if you get a little drunker. Not quite one of my favorites, but I would definitely drink this again if I was in the mood.","rjcohen","Oct 08, 2013"

APPEARANCE: swirling activity below a two-finger thick froth that paints (rather than laces) the glass the body is a burnt orange with steady effervescence--drop-dead gorgeous , and only a foot away!... AROMA: smooth, malty base with a bit of bready dough that mellows the secondary citric kick with a surprising apple scent--otherwise, reserved, as an ESB might behave... PALATE: understated, almost buttery smooth with little resistance from teeth to throat--a bit watery...TASTE: a basically thin malt profile pervades; typical doughy funk intertwines with buttery notes and a bit of toast--not feeling this one as impactful or winning a specific category... OVERALL: Plusses include its attractive pour and easy sipping nature; negatives (if there is such a thing for Brooklyn brew) is its paper-thin fortitude and rather doughy aftertaste...bearing the ""pennant"" moniker, this beer should be more of a success that its name suggests; as it is, this beer is merely serviceable, but a lesser player in the mix pack than I hoped.

Nose is classic and very understated. Strong and steady malt base, biscuit, caramel and toast. Hops are subtle citrus, pine & floral. With the smallest hint of yeast on the nose the balance is fantastic and appetizing.Taste is delicious. Smooth, buttery, mellow. Toast and biscuit, the malt opens up deeply sweet and round. The hops are not the star here. Not much bitterness just the slightest oily touch in the finish and no aftertaste. Very mild with apple and grass as it opens up.

3.78,4.4,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before March 2013. Pours slightly hazy orange amber color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of caramel, toast, brown bread, pine, floral, citrus, grass, and herbal hops. Nice and pleasant aromas with good strength and balance. Taste of carmael, toast, pine, floral, grass, brown bread, citrus peel, light nuttiness, and herbal hops. Light floral bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, pine, floral, brown bread, citrus, grass, light nuttiness, and herbal on the finish for a bit. Very nice flavor robustness and balance of malt/hop flavors; with zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very good English pale ale. Nice balance and robustness of flavors; and very smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 16, 2013"

This beer has all the great characteristics of English ale but is a really good, reasonably priced domestic. All aspects of it are on point for style: look, smell, and flavor. Not too sweet either. The best part is the bready and yeasty flavor that comes through. Hop flavor is aromatic, slightly herbal, but not so bitter. It can only be perceived as bland if you drink it too cold. This is ale... let it warm a little to let the flavors surface. One of my favorites.","angusdegraosta","Jan 04, 2013"

Aromas are light, with a roasted toffee balancing out a floral and effervescent hops profile. Flavors are light and a little sharp from the carbonation, with a roasty toasty toffee backbone and some floral and peppery hops lightly cleaning up the end of the palate. The aftertaste is a tangy sweet toffee flavor, with a clean, crisp, and someone astringent finish. Good flavors, but the body doesn't do the beer any favors.","GarthDanielson","Apr 28, 2012"

3.67,1.4,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Moderate one finger head of darker cream white with less than average retention, the lacing forms a thin sheet down the glass sides that slowly slides into oblivion. The liquid is a slightly murky, muddy orange hue, as close to brown as to red, some loose bubbles trying to form beads here and there. There’s some roast in the nose alongside the caramel, honeyed nuts and hard butterscotch candy scents, does have a greener, more herbal side as well with some mixed white citrus spritz, apricot and apple fruit, muscular and lasts for some time. Medium-bodied, the carbonation wants to make it fluffy but it is pretty damn dense, not a beer which just glides down the chute. On the sweet side, the caramel, scone, soda bread pairs well with the peach, apricot, yellow apple fruit. Some lemon peel but nothing sour nor biting. Again, presents a grassy undercurrent but by no means a focal point, brings some bitterness to the finish. Suggestive of complexity while remaining safely accessible, I can see this as an “adventuresome” beer to some. Otherwise, would drink it if handed one but unlikely to seek out for further purchase.","farrago","Sep 22, 2011"

3.4,-6.1,3,3,3.5,4,3.5,"Brooklyn Pennant Ale pours a clear burnt orange. Head formation is minimal to say the least, leaving no opportunity for the pleasant affectations that come along with a foam crown, namely retention and lacing. The nose is fairly muted, but a little bit manages to make it's way out of the glass. Biscuity malts and a buttery note are what command attention, with some light herbal hoppiness present as well. The malt is more cracker than biscuit, and surprisingly crisp, with just a hint of diacetyl bleeding through into the back end of each sip. The same herbal hoppiness from the nose is back, this time with a little bit of a spicy pepper presence added into the mix. The body is nice and light, while still being solid enough to support the not insignificant malt base. The carbonation though could probably stand to be just a tad more active. Brooklyn Pennant Ale was an alright beer. I wasn't expecting an American IPA style palate shredder as far as hops go, but I do think the beer's a bit too restrained in that regard.","axeman9182","Jul 29, 2011"

The beer is a clear copper liquid with a big off-white head made of small bubbles. Lots of additional small bubbles are rising within the glass. It has a grassy, fruit aroma. Are those green apples I smell? Some medium colored (not pale or dark) malt sweetness is noticeable. There is a lot of pale malt flavor. A little bit of fruit and some hops in the finish. A kiss of toffee is also in the finish. It has a medium body and strong carbonation. It leaves a slick film on my tongue. I find it to be pretty drinkable.

It carries a pretty fair amount of bitterness that leaves me feeling like this beer has an identity crisis. I find that this taste is not really bold enough nor clean enough for me to considerate it anything special. The body is on the lighter side of medium and wonderfully smooth with a nice balanced finish. It is probably this beers best attribute.

Subtle hops in the finish. Medium-bodied. For whatever reason I was expecting something lighter. I guess the label had me thinking summertime, sitting in the sun, watching baseball, etc. This would be nice during the fall. Ok, so they won the pennant in the fall. I get it.

The dry florals are right up there with the grapes.

So judging color and lacing among other things is kind of tough but who knows when I will see this again on tap around here. Even in the cup this stuff exhibited a fair off-white head over what appeared to be a fairly clear medium copper color brew. The aroma was mild but gave off some malt, almost a brown bread scent. The flavor was instantly gratifying, a bit creamy with a peppery crisp carbonation and sweet biscuit malt. Surprisingly, I don't find much in the way of hops going on here but what there is would be on the herbal side, fairly dry. All in all a decent blend and a welcomed sight compared to all the other macros on tap at the bar that night. It certainly is drinkable but the dry quality probably wouldn't suit that purpose as much as others, by my tastes. Definitely deserves a try and should be much more than serviceable to all.

Rich, dark and vinous in the nose, with a backing of earthy/floral hops - good, but not very strong. On the palate it is vinous and bready, with toasted malts, chocolate, some fruitiness, and a touch of alcohol. On the hop side of the equation, there are green/floral and piney/earthy flavors and a mild bitterness that brings the beer together. The body is medium and well-carbonated, smooth, drying and a bit numbing, and both the malts and hops contribute to the medium finish.

The carbonation is perfect in this beer. It dances through my mouth and goes down cleanly, leaving a great aftertaste. All said I enjoyed it fully, though perhaps the hops were not as assertive as I've come to expect from an APA.","zdk9","Oct 14, 2007"
3.65,0.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Picked up the Pennant Ale '55 in Brooklyn's Party Pack, but I've seen the Pennant Ale in stores all around New York. Poured out a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. Thin head and not too impressive on the smell. Already smells heavily of malts. Taste was a little powerful on malts. There were hints of some fruits, but lacking a hops balance to mellow out the malts. Great mouthfeel and drinkability though. I could down a couple of these, but the malty sweetness would eventually slow me down. Overall, I would say this brew is a bit out of place as an ""American Pale Ale"". The word unbalanced comes to mind.","zerofear13","Oct 11, 2007"

The taste is much the same, but much more assertive, with a British character to it almost. And so, while the mouth is quite nice, good body and a fine carbonation, it almost screams for cask conditioning. Now that, would be a tasty beer.

Let me say this, it is not a bad smelling brew just not real good IMO. The taste also while being good seems lackluster as the first thing I notice is a buttery flavor that seems to dominate and really seems to stick around. The finish that surprisingly seems to be very un-bitter is more metallic in nature. Overall I would classify this brew as a slight disappointment, for me.

The head falls to a solid coating over top, and a decent carbonation is seen in the brew. The brew looks like it is glowing at the bottom of the glass. Inhaling over the glass, I find lots of toasted and bready malt, with a mild caramel underneath. The hops come across as more earthy in nature; they blend nicely with the toasted character of the malt. A sip brings me a good toastyness, with a raisin fruityness, as well as some bready sweetness. It is a nice combination. A mild earthy hop hits more on the finish, along with a very, mild bitterness. Mouthfeel is thick, with a very mild carbonation. It could use a touch more carbonation in there to balance it out. I think this one is pretty drinkable. Even though it is not traditional for a Pale Ale of any flavor that I know, I think they work well together. It's like a pale ale with some special b or aromatic in there.","kmpitz2","Nov 25, 2006"

Came home, cracked open a bottle, poured into an old-style mug that showed off a nice coppery color. Head was light and thin, but the carbonation reminded me of a lager or pilsner...I wondered if this was a lagered ale or some such. Smells great, a lot of malt and earth to go with the hops. First mouthful reminded me of a Scotch ale, with some good malty flavors. The hops balance it out nicely, especially after the beer settles down a bit. Good overall mouthfeel...you definitely know something's hitting all your tastebuds. Not a very heavy beer, however, which makes it quite drinkable. I'd be very selective pairing this one with food, because I have a feeling that it would be great with simple fare, but could clash with more complex dishes.

There's this biscuity taste that is just- I don't know. It's like an overwhelming malt that is just too light and too metallic. In a way I think they try to copy the water of Bass or Sam Smith for this one, and almost hit the mark, but nope. No cigar.

3.83,5.8,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"This beer poured into the glass a crystal clear amber color that when held to the light it had an orange hue on the edges. The head that was created was an off white/light tan color. The consistency was thick, creamy, and very full, it lasted a decent amount of time after the pour. Lightly carbonated. There was some lace left behind. The aromas that came from the glass were of fresh grass, flowers, with wisps of fruit (citrus) and caramels. The tastes were crisp, clean and smooth on the pallet. Flavors of sweet malts and fresh grass and floral hops seemed to balance each other all through the sip. Some citrus and biscuit flavors were also noticeable. The finish is on the dry side, but had a sweet feel to it as well. The body is light to medium. Decent beer, refreshing and well balanced in the nose and in the mouth.","Jarod","Oct 27, 2003"

The smell was sweetly malty with a hint of caramel and some floral notes. The taste was malty with floral hop flavors, but not much hop bitterness. The flavor was rather subdued. The mouthfeel was smooth and very dry. The body was medium with a lingering tangy and mildly floral aftertaste. This ale was easy to drink. This bottle had been in my refridgerator a long time (best by Nov '02), but the only effect on the flavor seems to have been a mellowing of the hop bitterness; otherwise, it tasted fine.","UncleJimbo","Sep 17, 2003"

Once sip reveals that they were shooting for a British-style pale which they nailed with ease. This oozes Maris Otter with a little floral hopping to balance. Long caramel, toast, 'n tea finish. The bitterness and carbonation are clean, creamy, and cleansing prepping the mouth for another nutty sip. Not a showy West-Coast-PA, but a refined traditional example.","yen157","Aug 25, 2003"

Nice blend of malt and hops with the hop presence being less pronounced than in many Pale Ales. No unpleasant aftertaste.

The aroma is of malt and bitter hops, with some citrus thrown in for good measure. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, and just feels really good overall. The flavor is round and smooth, and well balanced. A bit yeasty, very pleasing malt, a bit tannic, and hop bitterness that tingles the throat. Also some citrus, pine, and a bit of fruit. Very drinkable. Especially if you're fortunate to have it very fresh at the brewery.","far333","May 18, 2003"

Not quite there with the mouthfeel - a little thin. Malt is not nearly hefty enough, and comes across as timid, rather sour and astringent. Hopping is mild and nondescript. Not up to par with the other brews I've been fortunate to sample from Brooklyn.","Brent","May 12, 2003"

Appearance is a medium amber brown with a cream toned decent sized foam head. Minimal lacing going on but an overall decent appearance. Aroma well, even after being well past the best by date this beer stilll retains many adimrable qualities. A nice smooth floral hop aroma balanced by a nutty caramel malt tones. You can tell this beer is overly ripe, but I think the hops preserved enough to make it a pleasant session brew. The flavor has a sweet forefront of malt followed by a trickling of mild bittering hops with a nutty finish to it. Lighter in body with little or no complexities to make this beer that interesting to me. Drinkability as of now this is a mediocre session beer that I still will drink only to try it fresher.","WVbeergeek","May 09, 2003"

The smell was impressive, with subtle fruity elements mixed with a strong malty odor. The hops become a little more noticeable in the taste, but the maltiness remains dominant. A bread-like taste was also present, maybe a bit too much for my liking. The medium body was appropriate, but I would have liked a bit more fizz on the tongue. Maybe a little flat, but not terribly so. Overall, this Brooklyn product was a pretty good ale, and it went surprisingly well with my fish dinner!","SchmichaelJ","Apr 17, 2003"

Carbonation is light. There is a mild hop presence that adds a little complexity to the brew. A wonderful drinking beer, I had to fight over these tasty treats as the card games rolled on.

3.88,7.2,4,3.5,4,4,4,"According to other reviews, this Brooklyn Ale is the same thing as Pennant Pale Ale, they just changed the name. So here I go... Orangish brew with a very nice white head on top. Nice and thick. Stays pretty well for a while, but loses its edge about halfway through. English hop aroma for the most part, maltiness is bready. A bit of sourness is in there too. On the palate, hoppiness dances on the tongue creating a tingle, while malt stays at the edges. For the maltiness, think sourdough bread with a little sugar added. English with an American touch. Smooth, medium bodied, nice mouthfeel overall. Clean, crisp finish. Pretty good pale ale, nice take on the style. Thanks to francisweizen for this one!","hyuga","Mar 16, 2003"
3.88,7.2,4,3.5,4,4,4,"This was a little darker than most Pale Ales witha very deep copper/chestnut color. The head receded immediatly into some bubbles that lined the side of the glass. The smell lacked the hop that usually accompanies pales. There were aromas of yeast and pears with a definite emphasis on malt characteristics. The taste was sweet with subtle notes of wheat bread, pear and apple upfront. I ddi not experience a very strong hop finish until the last third of the beer. The mouthfeel was, howver, very mellow without too much carbonation. Definitely thick and malted without a real crispness of some pales. This beer is not what I am used to in a pale ale, but I will definitely buy this again.","GreatPondBrewer","Feb 19, 2003"
4.17,15.2,4,4.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Overall, an easily drinkable ale base, and when you can get it fresh (which can be a problem because it is so widely shipped, and thus widely sits around and waits) it gives off a potpourri blend of nose and tongue. For myself, a great day-to-day ale but with more character (mainly in the nose) and complexity (mainly on the taongue) than a typical day-to-day ale. I grab it when I want a cheaper six pack that won't drink like a cheaper six-pack.","nomad","Feb 17, 2003"

3.33,-8,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"A golden copper color with beige head and both moderate head retention and lacing. Problems begin in the nose. Immediately, a heavy alcoholic element, similar to scotch, seeming inappropriate to the style and just plain unappealing to me. Also in the nose, caramel malt and citrus. On palate, the promise of the nose is delivered with, again, that alcohol off-note that is just too direct and out of place. Additionally, a heavy sweetness with roasty, caramel malt notes. There is a slight dryness in the finish but nowhere near balancing the heavy sweetness. And despite this potent combination of heavy alchohol and sweet elements, the mouthfeel is rather thin. The finish is somewhat cloying and just sort of drops off haphazardly. Boy this is coming off negative. I'm just not a fan of this beer, though its still Brooklyn, its still craft-brewed and its still better than lots of beers out there.","Riggo","Feb 10, 2003"

3.31,-8.6,4,3,3.5,3.5,3,"The bottle indicates that the color of this beer is ""chestnut""; I would call it amber. Head retention is medium-low, but the beer does leave behind some nice rings of lace. The nose is fruity (suggesting grape) and yeasty, with some additional, more aggressive spicy notes that I've had trouble identifying even after multiple samples. On the palate a rich malt flavor stands out, with slight citrusy undertones. The finish displays contrasting elements of sweet and sour which are unbalanced and could be brought together more effectively. This is a decent beer, but also somewhat odd. It's too sweet for my tastes, and lacks the appropriate bitterness that I expect in a Pale Ale.","jward","Jan 27, 2003"
3.8,5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Clear, deeply tawny / reddish mahogany in color. The ivory colored head is a creamy, holds well, and leaves some minimal lace. The aroma offers a lightly fruity, caramel maltiness with some earthy & spicy hops. Very nice. The body is medium with a fine and restrained carbonation; giving a smooth and lightly creamy mouthfeel. The flavor is somewhat fruity with a distinctive caramel maltiness that's gently supported by hop bitterness. The maltiness has a certain richness to it, but I question how much of that comes from using Maris Otter and how much comes from mash temperature and dextrinous crystal malts. Some grassy, earthy, and lightly spicy hop flavors appear in the finish. An excellent English-style pale that would make a good session ale with a slightly lower alcohol content. I'd love to try this out of the brewery in Brooklyn - and a cask would surely be stellar - however, the bottled version offers some of the F.X. Matt house character that is sometimes described as ""soapy"". Still, I was pleasantly surprised by this offering.","NeroFiddled","Oct 05, 2002"

Normally I prefer the American version, but this is one of the better English-style pale ales I've had.  Very solid malt backbone and enough hopping to give a nice bitterness.  Very easy drinking.
