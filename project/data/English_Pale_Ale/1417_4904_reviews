"500ml bottle pours nice deep bronze color with bright white head that slowly settled to a lasting thin 1/2 pencil head. The aroma was malty with a hint of fruit hut all in all the aroma is low with a very little citrusy hop presence. Taste is malt forward rich bread and caramel notes throughout the palate. Bitterness is strong which leaves a nice dry finish. A very refreshing sessionable beer that is one on my favorite English bitters I had while in the UK."

"Not really my beer but drinkable. I expected a black beer but this one is goldenyellow with a fairly decent head. Nice lacing in the glass. Bitter taste and the funny part is that you do not really notice that this beer is low on alcohol."

"This pours beautifully, as an English Ale should. Nice foamy head that gradually dissipates. Black Sheep leaves some faint lacing and has minimal carbonation- again, true to the style. The flavors are excellent - caramel, nuts and overall  earthiness with a minimal hop profile. This is a wonderful beer - a nice treat when I feel a longing for a plough man's lunch at the local."
""

""
"Overall:  A strident, roasty and bitter brew. Not bad but a tad underwhelming."
"Good Head, little bit of a yeast or faint sour tast, but smooth to drink."
""
"Overall - Mild but it does have flavour and is not a bad beer overall."
""
"O: If you're looking for a bold hoppy beer this isn't for you. It's beer that just tastes like beer. Would be great with a ploughman’s."

"A very smooth taste"

"500 ml bottle into pint glass, L31 bottle code. Pours slightly hazy deep orange/copper color with a 1-2 finger dense and fluffy off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, toast, brown bread, light nuttiness, herbal, grass, light pepper, light pear/apple, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with well balanced dark/bready malt, earthy hop, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, toast, brown bread, nuttiness, herbal, grass, light pepper, light pear/apple, and yeast earthiness. Light earthy herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, brown bread, nuttiness, herbal, grass, light pepper, light pear/apple, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice robustness and balance of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester notes; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Quite restrained on yeast fruitiness which was surprising. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish as expected of 4.4%. Overall this is an excellent English bitter style. All around great robustness and balance of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"The taste is super caramel sweet with next to no bitterness. Easy to pound down in a pub. This is one of those beers that I would have drunk a lot of regularly 1+ years ago but my palate has changed. Still, a good beer to drink in a UK pub. Worth a higher rating."

"O - I really didn't enjoy the malty vegemite like flavours, maybe because I eat so much vegemite and marmite normally. The mouthfeel was also a bit inconsistent. I wish I left this beer on the shelf for a while longer..."

"DATE TASTED: February 1, 2014... GLASSWARE: Hobgoblin pint...OCCASION: prepping for the Super Bowl with Blades of Glory... APPEARANCE: orange-amber, semi-translucent body akin to tea; white, frothy, thin head; lacing twists and turns somewhat seductively... AROMA: luxuriant scotch-like notes; light, buttery English muffin; some malty elements too--attractive... PALATE: active, medium-bodied and drinkable; a pub compatriot for certain...TASTE: buttery, slightly doughy malts as an ESB would be; mellow with an unmistakable, oaky, highland fortitude; a dry, thin finish akin to sherry--though not nearly as powerful... OVERALL: A pleasant draught from a brewery I've had little else from, but in seeking to rate this beer (one I'd last drunk in 2005, if my records are accurate), I am pleased with the experience; it's no nonsense, light fragrance invites quick sips and rewards with thirst-quenching malts and enough hops to achieve a worthwhile balance ...."

"It's plenty crisp in a sturdy medium body with a smooth flow, easing off into the finish but not thinning. There's a light earth and herbal dryness in the middle and beyond, ultimately making for a semi-dry feel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It has an accentuated bitterness and a very light body."
""

"Mellow and soft body: very easy to drink."

"Gotta love it when awesome customers travel to the UK and bring you back some tasty beverages. This stuff pours a clear brass topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises lightly-toasted biscuit, mild grass, and sweet flowers. The taste brings in more of the same, with a stronger vein of sweetness stemming from the biscuit, though this serves only to perfectly balance the grassy and flowery hops. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a smooth feel. Overall, this stuff is not gonna set the world on fire, by any means, but it is a very tasty, very easy-to-drink little brew. Something tells me it would taste just grand (Wow, did I just say that? Who am I, a middle-aged upper-class Victorian woman?) from a hand engine..."

"O: Nice beer for the style. Has good flavor with character without being overpowering."

"Food match: PPF (Pommy Pub Food); pot pies, Guinness pie, stews of various flavours with unreliable meats in them, and fried battered fish with a wedge of lemon and chunky chips (or ""fries"" as Americans call them). Also if you're still peckish: crisps! (or ""chips"" as Americans call them)."
"A very bready and sessionable beer. This will be my new standard for breakfast drinking."

"The beer is transparent and amber hued with a soft white head. Biscuit and bread aroma. A simple beer with a touch of bitterness in the finish. Notes of toasted grains and a subtle earthy quality, perhaps mushrooms. Light bodied and while unexciting, certainly drinkable. Worth a try."

"Overall: This would have scored even higher if it was full bodied, but that's just my personal opinion. I appreciate that others might prefer this type of mouthfeel. Either way it's a great beer and one I would certainly recommend. I'll probably try one again in the near future and see if I like the feel better."
""
"Overall a solid bitter."
"Notes: This is what a good beer is; hits all 4 aspects well. Great!"
""
"for style its good, not my favorite style of beer but I'm learning to appreciate low booze, mellow, balanced English brews"
""
""
""
""
"O: Good beer for the style which is not one of my favorites. The beer is very drinkable but personally I would not go back for another in a single sitting, on the other hand I would not refuse this beer if I came across it again."
""
""
"Overall, this is a nice ale, and I'd definitely recommend it. I'd even think about getting a few of these to enjoy over an evening sometime in the future."
""
""
"Poured a amber body with and off white head. Smell is sour and not pleasing at all. Taste is sugary sweet and also not pleasing. Medium mouthfeel. Overall I didn't like this beer at all. I would avoid this next time. Too many off smells and tastes for my liking."
""
""
""
"In a blind taste test, even I could pick out the country: England. Far more than some other Pale Ales, Black Sheep has the aroma and flavor profile of a bitter or an ESB. That esthery smell, with yeast and caramel malt, is one of a kind. Complex flavor. You'd think this is a dark, almost black beer from the name, but no, just the classic copper look with a fine head, classic being the key term. The dark brown bottle simply preserves the freshness better. A solid recommendation here."
"Serving type: bottle"
"A decent ale. A restrained flavour and good body make for easy drinking. Dry but fruity. Well-crafted and worth sampling."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a decent English Pale Ale. With the low ABV (4.4%) a nice session brew."
"Overall, decent and widely distributed, but when there are decent pale ales from other breweries available, I would certainly skip this one."
""
""
""
""
""
"NICE, NOT A MUST HAVE!"
"This is really good, I may need to stock it in the cellar if I can find it again."
"Overall - Not bad at all, easy drinker. Has nice amount of hop and malt flavor. Slighty too bitter and overpowers the overall sweetness but other then that a decent english pale ale."
"A solid English Pale Ale, in fact better than I thought it would be. I've ignored this beer for years, and I'm not sure why, so I'm glad I decided to pick up a bottle on a whim. Pours a nice amber, not copper colored, but not as pale as some pale ales from England either. A medium head that eventually fades away away to nothing. Very little of the often present metallic aroma in present, but there is a bit of a buttery note that is not out of place in the style, as well as some earthiness, some clean graininess, and a decent bitterness, particularly on the finish. A light biscuity sweetness on the palate as well, but that plays well with the hops. The more I drink of this, the more I like it- always a good sign."
"Overall: Nice drink for pubquiz"
"-i enjoy this beer. it's a nice easy drinker, with a good english style balance. seems like it would be a very good cask beer"
"Medium carbonation and a medium body. Overall not bad, nothing outstanding about this."
"pours golden with two finger white head. smells like a general ale with a good mix of hops and malt. sweetness from malts and a bit of bitter from hops. This is nothing special, it is just a standard ale. I feel that this is about as middle of the road as you can get."
"O - Nothing overwhelming on the palette, but certainly poundable. Nice light, crisp, English Ale that is definitely worth a try."
"Black Sheep is one ale that I put off trying for years, but I thought that I would like it. The reality is that this okay, but it looks like I'll be putting off a second helping for longer than I put off my first helping."
"Verdict: You can find better British ales for around the same price point. Look elsewhere as this is undistinctive."
"The Black Sheep Ale is much like most of the ESB's on the market out there. The color is amber or copper. The head is white and soapy. The lacing isn't too bad here. The smell is mostly malts and a little bitterness going on. The flavors are of dry malts with a little sweetness in the background. The the mouthfeel is smooth and for the most part really drinkable."
"Notes: Overall it goes down easy but the thin feel and flavor are a bit of a let down. I do like what is there but I just want a little more of it."
"M/D: more carbonated than I would have wanted. I would expect this to be much better on cask"
"D- Nothing special about this pint, average at best."
"Overall: Overall the beer is pretty good. I enjoyed the nice sweet aroma that the beer had. The balance of that sweet aroma in the flavor along with the hoppy bitter finish made for a nice complex flavor. I would recommend this beer to any beer drinker out there."
"d- overall this is a very good beer, i prefer the yorksire ale more but this is still a very good beer and i would highly recommend trying it if you enjoy english ales"
"Final thoughts - I would recommend this to anyone who likes bittersweet chocolate or nutty beers. Good mouthfeel. One of the better dark ales i've had recently."
"This is an excellent all round ale that is incredibly easy to drink & would work wonders as a session ale."
"Pours a clear coppery amber color with a nice plume of sticky white head, good retention and lacing. Scent is nutty with touches of toffee, fruit, bread and earthy/herbaly hops. taste brings all the components of scent in a nic elight balanced flavor. Medium bodied, slightly oily, dry. A nicely English Pale Ale with good flavor for the low ABVs.."
"Big English hops - the bitter side of bitter. Nice feel, too. I'd go back."
"nice stuff."
"Drink ability is hard to explain. I wouldn't mind having another to try to figure this beer out. It's not horrible tasting but just overall a very strange beer."
"D - Very pleasant and drinkable and would definitely work as a session beer."
"Drink - This is a nice easy drinking beer that would be perfect for a session."
"D- Very drinkable and refreshing."
"Drinkability: Goes quite well with a meal (apple cider chicken and mashed potatoes) - enough flavor to be noticed, but not so much that it gets in the way. I think this one would be right on from a cask, and it's a very good, and sessionable, British ale. It may not be tops in everything, but it was gone fast."
"Overall quite enjoyable but nothing to write home about. If I had more than one, this'd be a great session beer."
"Dr: Won't buy it again, especially at this price."
"Drinkability: A fantastic session beer that ranks with the finest of what gets imported from the British Isles"
"Pours a pale copper colour with a light white head that didn't stick around too long. Sweet malt and candy apple come off of the nose leaving a little to be desired. A nice bitterness comes out from the first sip with an underlying sweetness, the malt reveals itself before the hops takeover for a long dry finish. Medium body and well structured. I will probably pick this up every so often, a quality british ale."
"Black Sheep Ale has a lager-like ordinariness and an overall shrug-inducing what-was-the-pointness."
"D: Superbly drinkable beer, and something that may very well enter my normal rotation, or at the very least something I will frequently suggest to others."
"Drinkability - An enjoyable beer, nothing i would hunt down but would drink if offered. Overall, i found the beer lacked a ""punch"" taste in the end, there was no quality that separates it from the rest in its field."
"Pours a golden orange colour with nice white head and some spotty lacing. Smell is of bready malt with some caramel and a hint of grassy hops. Flavour has very little bitterness for a pale ale, but nothing is off about it either. Carbonation level is good. Overall a little bit weak."
"Pasteurizing a beer and then bottling it and shipping it half way across the planet only to have it sit on a shelf for an uncertain amount of time at warm temperatures is kind of like driving a stake through its heart and hoping that it dies and fails. That being said, Black Sheep Ale still fares surprisingly well and makes a great quaff for anyone who appreciates flavourful, sessionable and traditional British-style ales."
"D - Easily sessionable due to the light flavors and low alcohol. This is a very dry and nicely bitter beer that is pleasing to drink. Again, would have liked more forward flavors overall."
"Rather average in many ways for an EPA: hazy brown-orangey color, loose white head, fizzy carbonation with a not-thin but not-dense body. The odd thing is that the aroma was packed with the stuff I really enjoy about UK ales-- sharp fruit pushed forward by a bitterness that isn't sour and isn't harsh-- but the taste was rather flat. It was okay, but after the first whiff I felt the rug being yanked so cruelly from under my feet. Weep for me."
"Tried this new one on a whim, win some lose some. Not a terrible beer, but probably not worth another buy for me. Historically this style hasn't been my favorite, but I think there is more potential than was delivered here. The beer poured a nice thick head. Nothing really notable in the aroma, but not bad either. The taste seemed to be some standard malts and hops, maybe a touch of ginger, not a ton going on. Fairly light. Finished dry. You could drink more than one. If it's around it isn't a bad option, but there is likely more excitement in the competition around it."
"Pours a very nice copper hue with a frothig offwhite light khaki head forming large bubbles and dwindles at a moderate pace. Aroma has a great ripe plum and fig fruity tone that jumps out with the initial smell. Some earthy herbal qualities are tucked beneath a sweet bread malt profile. Flavor is balanced not overly sweet or bitter in either direction, very much an English session ale finishes pretty dry. Some definite hop character with some mineral water tones, a bit of caramelized fruit and earthy herbal hop flavor blend nicely. Mouthfeel is well rounded medium bodied dry semi bitter finish left behind on the palate between each sip. Drinkability overall is prett solid, I would just rather drink a 10 dollar six pack instead of this for 3.99 a bottle. Worth a shot especially if your into English ales, I will see this beer again when in the mood."
"I might be too nice, this was really unbalanced, and I wont go for another one."
"D: An easy-drinking EPA... not a stand-out by any means, but quite decent."
"D: Nice change from overly sweet ales. Flavors are light and mild. Overall it is an easy drinking ale. I wanted another."
"A reserved, enjoyable enough, and still quite tasty, crisp British pale ale - more or less well balanced, and a candidate as a decent potential sessioner, were I ever in a joint that offered such an option."
"In the glass, good foamy head, warm reddish amber color. Buttery funk with yeasty grains in the nose--very dough-like. Taste: malty cracker, dry with smooth butter to balance--very breadlike. A bit syrupy in the mouthfeel. An enjoyable lingering aftertaste."
"D: Drinking this was a breeze - I would definitely have another one of these given the unique contrasting flavors."
"D - A good beer to sit and contemplate for a half hour or more. Would buy again."
"Notes: This was hard to put my finger on how I felt exactly about this. However this is toward the top for easy to drink subtle flavor that builds while you drink it."
"Drinkability - Great beer and I would rate this very high in its category, really enjoyable."
"D- This is my favorite category of beer and wish this is how our standard beers were made. I would love this one to be available on tap where I am. It's lower alcohol level makes this one easy to enjoy as a session beer and would go well with salty fried pub food! I will definitely buy this beer again! Just short of Fuller's London Pride but a strong second!"
"A decent English pale, but at the price point it's not one I'll regularly pick up. Bitter and full, but not memorable."
"Serving- 12oz bottle."
"Drinkability: To me this one met the style guidelines. The tea taste is the dominate flavor. I was not overly fond of it and have had better in the style. I will pass on this in the future."
"D: Tastes are rather muted on this one, goes down easily, somewhat tasty. ABV makes it highly drinkable, though I may opt for others of the style."
"The taste has definite but moderate bitterness up front balanced with sweetness. The two balance each other nicely throughout although the bitterness has just the edge by the finish, making it slightly on the bitterside but with a firm sweet malty base. Flavours are firm toasted grain, faintly caramelly, qwith light leafy-citrusy hops. The feel is lively and zesty with a long, smooth but very crisp, clean finish followed by an aftertaste of light cistrusy-resiny bitterness and mild grain sweetness."
"Like the Monty Python Holy Ale, this is really not that good. Kind of a cool label, but that is it. Nothing bad, but nothing good either."
"Two many of these and I may not be able to stop myself! There is a simple timelessness found in good English Ale's right in this one."
"The beer shows a copper-orange body with three fingers of tight beige head. The head has good retention and leaves behind a spotty lace. I smell deep notes of caramel and damp earth in this ales inviting aroma. There's a light hit of cracker at the beginning, followed by caramel and treacle. This is followed by a musty, leafy bitterness mid-palate that carries into a long finish. Faint fruit notes come out as the beer warms a little bit. Medium bodied with almost flat carbonation. It's very smooth. It feels substantial in the mouth without being bloating or filling. It's a great session ale."
"D: Pretty good. I'd call this a more-or-less standard English Pale Ale."
"drinkability is very high"
"D - Good Yorkshire ale, maybe not competition for Samuel Smith's beers but still a flavoursome ale in its own right."
"Drinkabilty: Easy drinkability, overall, a good beer. Fans of Boddingtons would probably like this."
"Goes down nice, very good drinkablility. Very good session ale."
"Its slightly complex because of the different levels like bitter, buttery, malty."
"I'd buy it again and stop my wife from laying the bottle on its side in the fridge, which is what must have caused the foaming."
"I'd say it's crisp and bittersweet, but not overly dry. Not at all. And I'd say there are lots of beers I like better, but there is no mistaking this is a good beer."
"Overall this was a much more complex beer than I thought. It's amazing what some brewers can do with their brews, even at a session-able ABV."
"D - The light mouthfeel combine with the satisfying taste makes this a highly drinkable English Pale Ale."
"Very easy to drink. Overall very well balanced and tasty."
"Drinkability: Overall, a very drinkable beer. Refreshing, simple, nothing offensive. I can definitely sit and relax with a couple of these."
"Good density to the just off-white foam, pleasingly slow dissolve with a highly respectable lacing left behind. As much golden orange as brown in hue, more jaundice yellow around the rims, clear with visible bubbles. Very dry and bready nose, sourdough, raw pretzel dough, rye, quite floral at times, no real fruit presence, hint of powdered chocolate, otherwise it's a clean and openly knit presentation, more tactful than penetrating. Medium-bodied, dry and, even with above average carbonation, seems reluctant to move forward. Same crisp, sour profile of sourdough, rye, pumpernickel bread, gets drier and drier with each sip. The floral side diminished here, in turn the mocha, cocoa so dry it hardly registers. Vague raw yeastiness. Not much going on here, even if true to the style."
"The nose on the beer is buttery diacetyl, crystal malts, toffee, caramel, maybe some roasted notes too. The nose is quite good. The taste is really nice old fashioned toffee, the kind your grandmother would have in the candy dish, caramel, maybe a chocolate hint or two. There is ample carbonation, a slightly prickly mouthfeel, some very tasty bittersweet malts. The beer is a bit nutty and drying in the finish. The aftertaste is slight. This beer is quite a session beer at 4.4% ABV, but with a full palate of flavors, a substantial enough body, and lots of character. This is worth seeking out. L'Chaim."
"I thought this beer would be more interesting given its relative rarity, but I wasn't overly impressed. It's just a dry english pale ale. Good, not great."
"I hardly ever slam a beer - and this is about as close as I come, but this is horrible. I can't say I would ever want to purposefully try this beer again. It's dry and rather stale - much like eating week old french bread. Stay away!"
"A lot of floral hops come gushing through the palate, blended with a rich, sticky maltiness. Very bitter finish to an otherwise short, sweet palate. Almost an IPA bitterness really, although it's more of a lingering than an upfront hit. Very bittersweet flavour, a bit lacking in complexity but otherwise quite nice. The hops and malt are actually very nicely balanced to make this a competent and drinkable English ale. Mouthfeel is a bit sharp but that's the only real issue."
"Immaculately thin and crisp body with moderate carbonation and a soft smoothness from malt. It has the thin body a nitro-stout has after all the fun's gone, only it has carbonation to boot. Soft malt - chocolate, toffee, and biscuit notions. Moderate dull bitterness like tea or coffee bean. As far as flavor goes it's quite reserved. Tastes okay. Feels good. Excellent drinkability."
"Pouring into a mug resulted in a medium amber color with about a finger of sticky head that leaves some nice lacing. Scent is very faint, leaving me unable to really identify any particular scents. Taste is fairly smooth, somewhat malty, with a bittersweetness to it. Feels refreshing, but leaves the mouth somewhat dry. Overall a decent pale ale for the patio season."
"Really solid atmosphere. Nice appearance, and although nose is only mildly complex, it is very pleasing. Malt has a roasted yet smooth quality. Nice complimentary tones. More like a bitter, than a pale ale really flavor-wise, and heavier body-wise than you generally associate with the style. Overall, really good quaff."
"Waiting to have it on tap or cask"
"Black Sheep is above average beer, but doesn't really stand out in any way. More hops and a stronger nose would improve it a good bit. I don't hate it, but I'm not exactly loving it either. It's very ho-hum, if you will. But, that's generally my opinion for the style. Worth a try nonetheless."
"Overall: The mouth feel of the beer is slight carbonated and dry. The body of the beer is medium. The finish of the beer is bitter, but not overpowering. The beer is subtle and very tasty. The Pale Ale is well made and quite refreshing. I enjoyed drinking this beer."
"Very drinkable - easy to finish and easy to think about going for 2nd. Solid brew."
"Pours with four finger cream head that fades slowly leaves a good lace. Clear deep amber color. Light earthy nose. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Flavor is nearly balanced but hops win, some initial sweetness. Hop bite at finish that lingers. 500ml bottle from Barb's Beer Emporium Concord, NH."
"Drinkability is average. It's good, but I won't seek this out again unless there's not much else available."
"I think there was a possibility this one was in the sun."
"Future outlook: Old bottle? Hard to say. Without any notation on the bottle from which to deduce freshness, I can't really see any reason to give this one another shot."
"Flavourful, with a great feel to it. Should have picked up more bottles of this tasty stuff. All-around great english pale ale."
"D: Low abv and easy to drink. Nothing that will wow you, just a sit back, relax drink."
" A really nice session brew with gentle flavor's that really work together."
"Overall- a nice balanced smooth pale ale, not much on the nose but other then that I was impressed , would reccomend it."
"D: A beer I could have several of, if there was nothing else available. Perhaps this was an older bottle where the hops had faded, but this was very average. Certainly was not above average in any way."
"D: I wasn't super impressed by this one. Low ABV makes this a nice session beer, however"
"I hope this was an old beer, or the taste was just too bitter to balance well."
"7/4/7/3/14 (3.5/5)"
"Overall - A very good English Pale Ale. Not my personal favorite but it is definitely a sturdy beer. Well worth a try ($4.69/16.9 oz bottle)"
"Purchased a bottle from Biggs beer in Vancouver WA. This pale ale poured into my pils glass looking just like an IPA last night, they are cousins after all. It poured hazy orange with almost one finger of off white head that stuck around just for a bit. Nose is malty, sweet and has a bit of sour note in there like the vinegar you use for deep fried fish. Taste is different than I expected and dissimilar from other pale ales that I've had. That sour note I detected in my nose comes through as slightly acidic, pleasant and altogether unique. Predominant flavor is a dry slightly roasted malt backbone supported by bittering hops. Mouthfeel is medium light and the carbonation light and very fine. Overall this is a good beer that has inspired my to try more English pale ales."
"D - I have had this ale several times and will continue to seek it out - I really enjoy it."
"Smooth. Nice pale. Perhaps a bit thin. But it's good drinking."
"This one's been sitting in the fridge for well over a year so it's overdue. It pours cool into my pint glass with a pretty solid amber color and a decent frothy white head. Lots of lacing all over the place. The aroma is very mild with hints of honey and caramel, orange wheat, pleasant but hard to define. The first taste is firm malt grain and wheat bread with a very fine carbonation. It's a pretty clean flavor, with a vague smokiness, almost peaty. The body feel is nice middle of the road, drinkable stuff. Not too much sweetness here, some grassy dryness but not too much. Likeable ale, definitely recommended. Could session this as long as I had some eats to mellow out the bite a bit."
"Drinkability: A rather full-flavored session ale with a keen drinkability. Worth a try."
"Pours a really nice deep golden, copper like colour with an off white head. Sweet malty like smell with a little bit of caramel. The label says it all for the taste; crisp, dry and bittersweet. Practically no lacing. The level of carbonation makes this beer pretty quaffable. I liked this beer a lot more than the Holy Grail Ale I had a few days ago. Can't wait to have another."
"D, notes: Well balanced. Great sessionability."
"D: Very easy to drink, has the sweetness with a bitter kick at end...nice amber aleish!!!"
"Well carbonated with a tingly mouthfeel. This would be very nice after a long hot summer day and a great session beer with some hotdogs and hamburgers."
"Sessionable at 4.4% abv. Also quite flavourful. Needless to say i found this to be a very enjoyable example of the style, and is something i would certainly recommend to fans of the english PA."
"Drinkability is great. Great English pale ale, drinks easily, very smooth, and has a great flavor to it. At 4.4% ABV it's a nice session beer, or just something to sit back and relax with. Check it out!"
"Overall, a classic English PA. Could be a go-to beer if it weren't so expensive. At 4.4% this is fairly sessionable ... and what a pleasant session it would be! Not quite as good as the Sam Smith Organic Ale (my favourite PA of all time) but a solid brew nonetheless."
"D - Pretty high drinkability. Low in abv and full in flavor. Went well with the bowl of chili and the polenta cake I was having."
"Drinkability: In this humble beer drinker's opinion: THE quintessential session beer. It's loaded with flavor and character, but it's light enough and low enough in alcohol to make this one to enjoy all night long. Which is just how the Brits drink their Pales and Bitters."
"Flavors are not in your face but relaxed. No lack. I could drink this for a long minute."
"D: Would be easy to put a few of these away and I could imagine they would get better with each one. But then again what beer doesn't. :)"
"A great try. Perfect beer with fish and chips. Taste and aroma are very well done. AN example of how good this style of beer can really be."
"If you haven't had an English Pale Ale, this would be a good place to start. Very different than an IPA or APA, so if you are somewhat afraid of a strong hop character, you may really like this one."
"Ooooh, that's damn good. It's got the hair on the back of my (...) standing up. Delicate, crispy carbonation eats away at some of the best head an English Pale Gal ever gave me. Butter toffee is squeezing a sexy pair of big hops. The backdrop is so pleasant; the tummy welcomes the treat and burps for more. The dry finish is having me Pilsner my pants. I gotta hook up with this Black Sheep again, just next time...I'm gunna put it in her glass."
"An orange brown color with a modest centimeter of head. Grainy malt in the nose along with some fruitiness and caramel. The flavor is an extension of aroma: husky grains followed by sweetness. An English bitterness prevails at the finish. Fairly light and pleasing on the palate, slight carbonation. A good clean balanced English ale."
"This was my first beer from the Black Sheep Brewery and it most certainly won't be the last."
"Bloody fine brew!!!"
"The feel is thick and milky. Has the feel of a nice English pub ale. Leaves a little milky film. Still, it's smooth-drinkin'. Overall it's big and milky, thick and sweet. Not bad but not one I'd crave."
"It was nothing out of the ordinary. I guess it could have been worse. There could have been malted corn or rice in here. This one has session written all over it."
"D: In general, this is a drinkable beer, but it didn't knock my socks off. Not a bad beer at all, nonetheless."
"Golden with a slight chill haze. 1"" off-white head that retains well at 1/4"" and leaves nice lacing on the glass. Aroma is of slightly sweet caramel malts and herbal hops. Clean nose. Caramel malts up front followed by grassy, herbal hops and a nice bitter finish. Subtle, but complex at the same time. Surprised by the amount of bitterness in the end of this beer. Medium body with medium carbonation. Very drinkable, will drink again."
"M/D: Easy to drink and really light in the mouth. Slightly bitter and not really sweet."
"D: I was expecting something totally different, but I got a very nice refreshing ale. This is highly drinkable. Dig this brew."
"a decent find."
"It's not a bad drop, but it doesn't have a huge amount of complexity to it. Drinkable enough, in its way, but there are English Pales I like a whole lot more."
"Whoa, a bit on the watery side of my taste. Med-low carbonation. Smooth as hell though. Sweet palate, malty finish with a light leafy hop edge. Mouth coating. Spice comes back. Just a bit metallic. Lightly herbal. Tea-like in the finish, which ends up rather bitter (yes!). My favourite EPA for sure."
"MF/d: This brew is smooth and tingly to the mouth but has an moderate feel. The 16.9 ounce size is PERFECT. It is very drinkable but that is plenty for me. After this one you will have quite the malt mouth."
"Poured a nice dark amber in color but not super dark, decent head. Had a decent malty fragrance and no hops. Kinda caramelish. Tasted the way it smelled... very nice and quite drinkable. I would buy it again, and am anxious to try some of the other by this company."
"D: Pretty drinkable, overall. Ok taste, but as the beer went on, it lost flavor and overall quality. The thin mouthfeel also did not compliment the beer as well, but it was still pretty smooth and overall, not too bad."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, mild kick, very good representation of style, this is a very nice session beer to drink several of throughout the entire evening."
"A good, tasty beer. I liked the hop smell. The hop taste was there, but not overwhelming. I didn't notice an alcohol taste. The label mentioned a ""bittersweet taste", but I didn't notice any sweetness, just a mellow hop taste. The beer went down nice and smooth. I'd buy this again."
"Poured a nice slightly off-white head over an orange-amber colored body. Smells almost fruity, with light hints of malt and hops. Tastes of pale malt with subtle herbiness from the hops, then finishes dry with a bit more bitterness. Smooth mouthfeel, and good drinkability. Overall it's pretty good if not overwhelming, and it seems like it'd probably be a good session beer."
"This beer pours an ornage amber color with an off-white/tan colored head. It smells very sweet and malty with a hint of a scotchy aroma mixed in as well. The taste is really good. It is malty and hoppy blended together extremely well for a balanced full-bodied taste. The afertaste is kind of scotchy which is a very relaxing flavor. It is a very smooth beer with excellent mouthfeel and carbonation and it is certainly a very drinkable beer. I am glad this one came in a 16.5oz instead of a 12oz bottle."
"Given the price, I was somewhat underwhelmed by this. If you like English Pale Ales, you may want to try this. I can't really consider myself a fan of the style."
"D = This is a very drinkable beer. It would be a nice pale ale just by itself if you were in the mood or an excellent choice for a session beer."
"D- This beer has some nice flavors but they are very soft and it makes this beer a bit drab. Perhaps on cask it would bring out more of the subtle notes but in the bottle it is not that interesting."
"On the palate it isnt powerful and moving, but it does give a somewhat smooth, sweet, and deep flavor. And overall, that is enough for me to enjoy it. It wont take a place among my all time favorites, but it is worth trying for the smooth flavor in itself. And on a total side note, the cap has a cool design I thought (I collect them)."
"Drinkability: easy drinking, good"
"D - This is a fairly easy to drink brew I think I'd buy it again"
"Pours a reddish-golden color with a one-finger head. Aroma is mostly fruity/bready on the nose. Taste is kind of bitter and cloying and while there's still some biscuity and malt flavor going on, I don't really find anything to be impressed with here. Could be considered an average interpretation of an English Pale Ale at best."
"d: i think this review is a little biased since there is very limited access to even slightly hoppy beers in hong kong but overall a very enjoyable english pale ale with hops to rival its californian equivalent"
"Review added 10-28-2007, translated from french 1-26-2008."
"Poured out of a 500 ml. bottle,nice copper color with a tinge of orange,big white foamy head with good retention and very nice spotty lacing. Smell is of a nice malts with some fruity aroma,kinda got a faint fig smell in there and lite caramel.It goes down very well,crisp and dry with the malt flavor and hitting you at the back with the bitterness and a tinge of sweetness all at the same time than finishing off dry with the bitterness hitting hard at the very end.Excellant brew in my mind and very easy to drink and to make a session beer out of,highly reccomended."
"Pretty standard English Pale ale in most ways - in fact, I find I have very little to say about it. Slightly fruitier and maltier than one might expect from the style, but nothing excessive. Not something I'd seek out."
"Light amber or auburn, clear and seemed to lack carbonation. At the same time, there was a generous two finger head with good lacing and decent retention ... go figure! The smell is of hay, floral notes, some sweetness. Taste is crisp, dry yet full textured, a bit sweet there as well. Some hops, bitterness is balanced in the finish with a mildly malty aftertaste. I've always enjoyed this English Pale Ale and tonight was no exception, some of my scores were rounded down but could have gone the other way."
"I was originally under the impression that this was intended to be an old ale rather than a pale ale. Now it looks like I probably just had a bad bottle. Will review again someday."
"Pretty satisfying beer. Perfect for relaxing with a couple of friends into the early morning. A nice hearty ale that would be lots of fun on tap. I've only seen these in singles, which makes me lean towards saving them for Sunday roast beef dinners."
"D: Could drink a few of these during a fiesta!"
"The taste has a few hints of coffee and roasted malt flavor that is well blended with some bitter hoppiness. I also detect some sweet flavors too. The mouthfeel is dry and nicely hopped."
"Bottom line: Here's a session Ale that really hits well on all marks and I can *only* recommend it. Very good stuff!!"
"Pours out a dark amber honey with some rather active carbonation and a thick, foamy head that leaves rings of lace on the pint glass. Nose is faint, pale malt, bread, honey, and some unidentifiable Euro-hop aroma. Flavor is sweet with a yeastiness in the background, some grain as well, and a finish that is slightly bitter and rather astringent. Mouthfeel is moderate in terms of body, but the carbonation is kind of foamy. I'll finish the 500 ml, but I surely won't buy this again. Not bad, just eh."
"D - The taste combined with the mouth feel makes a very drink able beer. You know you are haveing a real ale, but yet you can drink more then one."
"Pours a dark clear orangish gold color with light tan chunky head. The smell is a bit spicy and a little citrusy, very nice. The taste is of roasted malt, but not really sweet. There's a lot of hoppy bitterness there as well, enough to leave a slightly bitter aftertaste. The mouthfeel is creamy with a slight carbonation tingle on the tongue. Overall, it's a drinkable, tasty beer."
"Drinkability of this beer is high, coupled with a low ABV, this might become a go-to session beer."
"Excellent drop, even from a bottle that's travelled half way round the world."
"There wasn't much of a hop presence in the aroma, but they showed up in the flavour, following a malty caramel start with a dry, bitter finish with a lingering herbal aftertaste. The low carbonation was appropriate for the style, but the beer was a little thin-bodied. I was hoping it would be a little creamier, but that's a small quibble."
"A very nice ale, if not fantastic. Appearance was hard to gauge due to its coming in a brown (but rather pretty) bottle. Aroma is malty with a whisper of sweetness, very inviting. Taste has some surprising hoppiness and a little bitterness, but is still malty with smoky undertones. This is a pleasant ale worth enjoying and savoring, rather than chugging at a party or sipping with dinner."
"Quite drinkable and tasty - can't find much to complain about here. I could see myself picking this up again."
"overall, very enjoyable. a well balanced flavourful ale."
"It's a nice one, and it's a sexy-looking pale ale, but there's not much to distinguish it. Don't get me wrong; with the low ABV, I'd happily quaff gallons of the stuff, but it's just not much to write home about."
"nice looking copper colored ale with a nice creamy head and decent lacing. Nice carmel malt with a hint of hop smell. Taste..very nice..almost perfect IMO balance of hop and malt. Smooth creamy mouthfeel. Very nice ale that is extremely drinkable albeit maybe not at $4.99/pintCdn at the liquor store."
"It's something to try but hardly something I'd recommend - due to its low carbonation it would make a good session beer if the flavour is something you like."
"A very drinkable beer and one I may have again."
"Poured out a reddish brown with no head. The nose gave some malt, hoppy bitterness, and a bit of spice. The taste offered some malt, apple, fruityness, and again some hops. The mouthfeel was crips and highly carbonated, and this was a fairly drinkable beer."
"Almost like drinking a cracker with it's whole-grain characteristics. There is a bit of that buttery quality to the taste as well but it is quickly derailed by a somewhat off-putting bitterness in the finish. Not bad at all and an interesting change from American pales but I'm not sure I'd make a habit of this one. Mouthfeel is pleasnant and, if the style is your thing, this is an exceptionally drinkable beer."
"500ml bottle from Ron's in Farmington. Slightly murky orange-amber body with less than an inch of off-white head. Smells kind of fruity with some caramel. Tastes fruity, caramelly, with a little roast and alcohol (oddly enough). Medium bodied. Honestly, I'm not that impressed with this one. It's okay, but not sure it's something i'd buy again..."
"Beers pours a nicely, with a nice foam, but not too much. Has that look of an English Pale Ale- darker then most American versions. A slight bready aroma tells you this is not going to be a fruity syle of ale. Rather a crisp and dry ale, without the bitterness- it is something to create such a beer and still be balanced. I am really impressed. Goes down easily - so enjoyable."
"D: A little high on the carbonation for a true session beer, but otherwise an extremely drinkable beer with an ABV that permits one to drink at length without dire consequences."
"This one is easy to drink. A nice example of an English ""session"" pale ale. Its unique flavors make it stand out."
"Taste is sort of textbook English pale ale, pleasingly bitter from start to finish, great foil for just about any food. Would love to drink this from a cask at a pub...no doubt from the cask it would be creamier and more fresh. Personally, I would choose more interesting stuff at this price ($4) but that's my own preference, this is a finely crafted ale."
"Drinkability: Pleasing flavor that reveals its virtues subtly. Excellent balance superbly styled, making for an enjoyable beer."
"Glad I saw these on the shelf, a nice heavy brown bottle from a familiar name, as drank the Bitter the last few times I was in the UK."
"Opinion: I like this beer. It is clean and well balanced, and leaves you with a subtle sweetness to linger which is a welcomed attribute for me when talking about British beers. The hops are reserved, but there...all components are noticeable in and of themselves. I would drink this beer again."
"Mattt"
"I felt the mouth was a wee bit watery. It didnt really stay on the palate long enough for me. As for drinkability, I find it neither offensive nor exciting. I could drink this all night in a nonchalant fashion, the beers just alright. An uneventful review for a particularly uneventful ale."
"This feels great: nice carbonation with the right level of creaminess. It is reasonably complex for a pale ale: there is a nice bitter hoppy background which dominates towards the end and at the start, but in the middle there is a very pleasant roasted nut malty flavour."
" [ as is usual with most liquor stores i go to, this one might be old, and been overly warmed up]"
"Medium carbonation in a medium body, finishes crisp. A decent English Pale Ale."
"This is a very tasty ESB. Flavors are balanced and complex."
"Very easy to drink, very tasty, goes down quick."
"D - It is a very drinkable ale. I wish it was more readily available where I live."
"Texture was thin, watery. Won't go out of my way to drink this one again, but I'm glad I tried it."
"Poured from a 22 ounce bottle to a golden-red appearance with decent cream-colored head that lingered through much of the glass. The flavor was okay, although it was difficult for me to pin down exactly what the predominant taste was. Beer was somewhat bitter, with a mediocre, dry finish."
" I was expecting something so bitter I wouldn't be able to finish it. It's not my favorite ale, but it is something I would drink again if it were offered to me. It's a little pricey, so I doubt I'll stock up myself."
"D  Very easy to drink. Pretty good beer which doesnt quite match the competition."
"This poured a clear coppery gold color with slightly tan head of tight compact bubbles. Thick foam had good stability and left thin rings of lacing. The aroma is biscuity malt and caramel notes, combined with earthy and flowery hop. At first taste it was almost closer to a ESB, but the flavor mellowed. More malty characteristics came through with some bitterness. The overpowering bitter finish isn't there making it smooth and complex. A very good example of an English Pale Ale. Would be a great sessional - I can picture myself in a traditional english pub right now. One of the best examples of the style I have had to date."
"1.09 pint bottle. Nice enough looking ale darker amber than most ESBs..nice frothy/bubbly creme coloured head. Liked the real English malt aroma to this, fruity and pipe tobbacco hints quite nice. Nice bitter/sweet malts dominate the mouth then theres asmattering of hops to break it up,also gets rather creamy before a semi-dry finish and a long lingering bitter chocolate aftertaste. Very good on the palate..quite smooth then dries out..well done. I liked this beer..then i do like the English style brews..and it packs plenty flavour for 4.4 alc."
"Once poured from the bottle I felt a little dissapointed. I expected it to be black, hence the name, but it was brown. It was a nice brown with a white head on it that dissapeared quickly. The nose was sweet and malty and typical of an english ale. Taste was kind of weak. Light malt taste was about all I could pick up. I'm not too impressed with this brew. I've had worse so it's drinkable, but I probably will not buy this one again."
"What is it about British Bitter? The impatient say ""nothing"" and indeed, upon first smell and taste of this marmelade colored ale with its fluffy white cap (in my glass at least) I do not sense much. But then the ever so slightly chewy mouthfeel taps me on the shoulder and beckons me to look again. British beer is most often as subtle as its citizenry, and here I seem to begin sensing a mineral quality beneath a layer of biscuity malt and a touch of fruit flavor that I can't put my finger on. Oh! I must be full of it now, and I started off sipping this beer in my sun room/ porch with a book on ancient China. I began to fall asleep, but the memory of my half drank glass woke me up to continue my studies - of the beer of course. I shut the book and came upstairs to share."
"This beer was not very fun to drink, overly sour and not very inviting for another sip."
"Final Statemet: Proof that taste buds develop. My once favourite ale now is just drinkable."
"an easily sessionable pale ale, thats a good example of it's style. not a knock out, but it's not designed to be. it's a solid simple beer."
"beer is very drinkable, bet it will be great this summer."
"Price: $3.99 for 1.9pt bottle (a fairly good deal)"
"Had this at a cheese and beer tasting. It was paired with Keen's Farmhouse Cheddar - Somerset. Has a more fruity aroma than I would have expected. A bit more fuller than some other English Pale Ales I've had. This beer has a nice long finish. Almost no head or lacing."
"Musings: A very solid English Ale. Nothing complicated or complex - but very consistent from pour to finish."
"blindfolded I might have mistaken this brew for a stout ... albeight an extra fruity one ... the bitterness is dominating, however there are hints of pink grapefruit, tangerines and cashew nuts in the palate as well .... a brew for the eclectic taste ..."
"Drinkable enough. Try this this I've had this on prior occasions & it had more malt character, rough crossing for this sheep?"
"This was purchased for me by my in-laws while they were in England (shhh, don't tell them I can get it in Georgia) and brought back just for me. It poured a nice amber with a decent head that stuck with the beer as I drank it. It had less chunks that the Hen's Tooth I had from England (but chunks are okay). Perhaps this was because I gave this one more time to sit. Anyway, the cool thing about this beer is that I tasted and smelled flavors I've never tasted or smelled in beer before. The smell was like an English garden--lemongrass, cut grass, lemon thyme, orange blossom, and something floral like lavender, honeysuckle, or heather. The beer tasted great! It was well balanced between the carmelly and slightly buttery malts, the bitter and citrusy hops, and then, coming through toward the end of the glass, lemons, grapefruits, and tangerines. Also toward the end of the glass, a new garden smell came through--Mint. Really! My wife commented that it smelled more like clover, but I swear it was mint and could almost start to tast it. This beer started out so-so, but finished grand. All in all, it did very well with the somewhat greasy shepherd's pie that had cheddar cheese, onions, tabasco, and herbed mashed potatos. Nothing like pairing traditional English pub food with traditional English pub ale. High marks all around!"
"Overall - A pretty good beer.... worth a try..."
"An outstanding English pale Ale. Lots of bread, peaches, and pears in the nose and flavor. Hopped for balance, while adding a mellow spiciness over the firm malt base. Lightly grainy in flavor, but not to deter. Round, yet smooth feel. Thins a bit into the finish for easy drinking. A good beer for any occasion."
"This dark red Ale poured into the glass with a small head and slight lacing. Smell is a bit sour, almost of vinegar, not very nice at all. Taste however makes up for this, it's rich, nutty with some bitter accents that make their way down pretty nicely. Feels good on the mouth, not too thiick and pretty consistent, slight bitterness all the way to the finish. The low ABV makes this pretty drinkable. Overall a pretty good brew."
"This is a good beer. I'll pick this one up again."
"D: Drinkability is very good."
"D - Not bad. Not spectacular though."
"Purchased a 1 pint .9 oz bottle from Sunseed Co-op in Cape Canaveral. Poured a cloudy orange with nice head. It seems to me that I taste alcohol fairly strongly at first, but not as much as I finish the drink. I'm a bit disappointed, I think it could use more hop character, it seems a bit understated. Not bad, but I don't think I would buy it again."
"I'd buy again."
"Pours a clear orange shade of amber with a thick off-white head that leaves good lacing. Smells of bitter hops and some slightly medicinal notes with sweetness in the background. Tastess hoppy upfront, with buttery and malty flavours as well. Mouthfeel is well carbonated and refreshing, and drinkability is great."
"Nice, natural carbonation leaves the tongue somewhat sticky though. Very sessionable and I imagine it's quite a bit nicer on cask in some cozy English pub. Maybe even the Winchester."
"D = Average. Smokey taste detracts me a little from getting this again."
"A standard English pale. Very decent hoppy and barley aroma. A bit light on taste but goes down well with food. Satisfying but nothing extraordinary. Understated bitterness and a great big head. Light body colour and mouthfeel. Dry and somewhat bitter aftertaste."
"Drinkability is very good. An all-night session beer under proper circumstances. Not at the cost /bottle that I shelled out for this guy, though..."
"Dinkability: This is a textbook session beer; I could drink these all day. For a lightish beer, it puts a lot on the plate. Much to like. Thank GOD for an English beer in a brown bottle for once!"
"Subtle and pleasant. Very well made."
"a fine english ale from a brewer that should well and truly know what hes doing, and does."
"Black Sheep Ale provides a tasty insight to a real English Ale and one that I will look forward to enjoying again."
"This is a good one...Nice pour gives a two finger tan/white head that lingers with large pockets of air stuck inside smaller bubbles. The color is golden red translucent. Very nice look. Smell is sweet organic, hops are prevalent, spicy with some soft malts coming through. The taste is full, a nice balanced taste, grainy sweet malts up front with a smooth malt middle and a nice hop kick at finish with a little more of the grains showing through again. The mouthfeel is nice and smooth, a nice carbonation kick adds to the hop punch at the end. A very drinkable brew, good stuff. I will try again."
"From North Yorkshire comes Black Sheep Ale, a newcomer to Alberta. A very nice 500ml bottle with hop vines embossed in the glass, and a light mauve-coloured label showing the sheep. Distinctive black cap with the words black sheep on it too. This poured very smoothly into my glass and gave birth to a billowing bright white head full of tiny bubbles and leaving rings of lacing. Copper coloured beer, hints of light red and tangerine orange. Clear and rich looking liquid. The head settles permanently as a centimetre-thick cream top to the beer. There is really nothing else for which you could ask apropos of this beer's appearance for the style. The aroma is burnt biscuit malt, with plently of the expected toffee and caramel notes, but all very well balanced with some earthy almost continental-style hopping, but they are Goldings. Complex fruitiness almost like an ESB, nutty brown bread. A little flowery sometimes, but the dark fruits make the malt intensely appetising. The taste up front is burnt toffee maltiness: quite bitter from the beginning. In the middle is the sweetness of the malt, honeyed, and the Goldings adding a big dash of dryness right to the end. The finish leaves a strong, mouth-puckering dryness, with tastes of sticky malt and a little citrus. A very good English pale. Medium carbonation and good drinkability, with plenty of complexity at 4.4%. Lovely drink. Paired interestingly with brie cheese."
"I am pleasantly surprised by this one."
"This beer is ridiculously smooth! the only thing that i didn't love was the mouthfeel was a bit thin, but overally a very tasty and smooth ale. Don't drink this one too cold as all flavor is severly diminished (more so than most beers i think)"
"The body is quite creamy. The hop is no longer missing--in fact, it defines the taste from sip to swallow and aftertaste. This is a very traditional English bitter, perhaps the very best I've ever had in a bottle."
"All and all a very good beer worthy of a try and one to keep for future B.A.'s in training."
"All 'round, an excellent brew."
"Good, all the way. Nice, well balanced English ale. The usual carmel flavor is there, and it's dry and smooth. Deep amber tone, nice foamy, lasting head. Not quite as full-bodied as the best of the style, but not far off. Anyone who likes a good English ale should try this one out (a good pint!)."
"This beer is quite pretty after being poured into my imperial pint glass. This clear, amber brew has a great half-inch head of foam that is sustained for a few minutes and some nice lacing is left down the sides of the glass as the head falls. The aroma is weak, but bits of fruity esters and woody hops are present. My tongue is greeted by sweet malt and spicy hops (unusual for a British ale) followed by a fairly assertive and somewhat tannic hop bitterness that teases the side of tongue and dries out the mouth; this an unpleasant effect. Despite this flaw, this is still a fairly enjoyable pint, but I recall it being a bit better in '04."
"The color is golden copper with very good carbonation. The thick, chucky head has excellent retention and leaves thick lacings. The aroma is of English malts with an almost honey-like sweetness in the mix. A touch of hops adds a little something to the malt smells. The first couple of sips seem overly bitter, but then as Black Sheep warms up, a nice fruity malt flavor comes to life. A decent English hop flavor comes in towards the finish. Still, I find this a little too bitter and hopped for the style. Which is strange, because I love an APA to be this hoppy. This isn't bad, but not an EPA I'd be too tempted to buy again."
"Overall-there is something to be said for a balanced beer and Black Sheep Ale is one of the best balanced beers I've ever drank, definitely check this one out, while there is nothing to shout about the sheer simplicity and balance of this brew left me very satisfied."
"Pours a clear orange-amber color with a thick and creamy light tan head that sticks all over the walls of the glass. Nose is sweet bread pudding with notes of buttery alcohol and dark rum. Taste also contains a lot of the sweet malt and bread flavors that were present in the aroma along with a mild fruitiness (predominantly plum and apricot) and a bit of black tea all followed by a bit of citrus and mild hop bitterness. A nice English ale to be had here."
"The brew is really very drinkable. It's not heavy or filling, and the dryness lends to your feeling like taking another drink very soon after the last one. Not nearly as sweet or as bready as the Monty Python Ale by the same brewery. This one comes much closer to my idea of a great English ale. I'd give it a thumbs up, but then I'd drop my glass, and we can't have that, can we?"
"Taste is cold steel. There is some subtle hop bitterness which comes through, but the taste is very thin otherwise. Mouthfeel as I said - thin with little carbonation. Aftertaste is organic and makes me wonder if I picked up a skunky bottle at the market. A little too pale for me."
"500 mL brown bottle, best before date stamped on the neck."
"Exceedingly balanced great example of the English Pale."
"Drinkability: it is indeed a one-is-not-enough, balanced, robust premium bitter, whose body and structure definitely outweigh its alcoholic strength, and that's why I really enjoy it!"
"Overall a zesty and high quality ale. A perfect balance of sweet and dry with a crisp and slight tart component also. Complex but very approachable. A great year-round offering for beginners to veterans. A fine english ale indeed."
"Pours a perfect amber with a huge full light tan headskie that just won't quit. This beer does not, however, taste quite as good as it looks. Hop bitter comes on rather strange but does serve to balance a mellow malt chew. A decidedly average beer. Very plain."
"This beer has built a massive reputation in Britain in the fifteen years since its creation, and for good reason. It's quite unusual, for a Pale Ale - somehow I remember it being darker and creamier in Harrogate and Masham, North Yorkshire. It looks good for the type, slightly redder than usual, but with a nice head at the start. Retention lessens as the glass is emptied. As others have said, it has more effervescence than is ordinary, prompting more burps than the usual English cask ale. It's a nice beer, lots of different tastes, quite distinct hops, surprisingly warming, a good one to have drink at the Old Bell Tavern on a cold night in the Yorkshire winter. Carbonation does not spoil the mouthfeel but it is unusual. Overall, this is a true real ale that some Northerners would die for, and for good reason. I would drink this all the time if it were ever on cask here in Australia."
"Mouthfeel is the best thing this ale has going for it. Crisp and clean, quite peppery, with ample carbonation and smoothness, and an aftertaste that is quite enjoyable. An extremely drinkable ale over pizza or something. This ale is an excellent starter ale for someone who is used to drinking domestic swill."
"500 ml bottle, as ""Black Sheep Ale", bought in England. Amber colour, moderate fluffy head. Aroma of toffee / caramel and dried fruits, hints of barnyard. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, moderate flavour of dusty malts and hops. A bit too carbonated for my taste."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1"" off-white head over the slightly cloudy, orangey- amber brew. Head is frothy and lasts well, with nice lacing. Aroma is a light pale malt sweetness with bitterness apparent as well. Taste well-balanced, yet delicate bitterness rears its head upon the swallow. Right what I expect from the style. Mouthfeel is nice and smooth, and drinkability is great. Check it out, this one's worth the trouble for a single visit or a session. Imagine it on cask at the source land, mmm..."
"A nice session that has a great taste. This is a good beer to demonstrate the various aspects of taste - hops and malts - yet not so strong as to blow your mind."
"Pours a nice burnt orange colour with a light, fluffy white head. Good smell, a nice combination of malts and hops. Taste is of a similar balance, with a creamy hint to it. Smooth, with a slight fizz. Very strong flavour, rich and satisfying. Good drinking."
"Is this a bad bottle or bad beer, I do not know, but it does not taste like what any of the other reviewers describe."
"Notes: Not that tasty at first. It gets better the more you drink, but it just has such a dry finish that I'm not a big fan of. It is also just a little bland and a watered down kind of taste. I've had better."
"Somewhat uneven, but overall a tasty and extremely quaff-able ale."
"The beer poured an amber hued golden color with no head. The nose had some honey sweetness atop a layer of caramel, but no real hop of note. The flavor was mostly caramel touched wtih honey, finishing with a nice bitter, as expected in an english beer. The feel was thin to moderate...nothing real special here. The drinkability was not bad, but not great. Just an ok beer."
"16.9oz bottle - no freshness date. Poured a dark amber with a little head and little lace. A good looking beer with a great smell. After pouring it, the color and smell had me looking forward to great tasting beer. Unfortuantely, it was disappointing. It was light bodied and had an almost watered down aftertaste. Worth trying once and maybe mixing in once in awhile but not a keeper in the regular rotation. PR 2.5 RHML."
"Somewhat reminiscent of Sam Smith PA, but more malty. A quite decent example of a north-England strong bitter."
"A very good head. Fluffy and full. The color was a nice copper color like a good tan. The first sip was tasty. The malt was apparent and sweet but there was some bitterness in the background. The mouthfeel was good but lacked some body. The aroma was pleasant but the hops were not overpowering. Worth a another try."
"poured copper with light tan medium sized head and good lacing.aroma, malts, caramel. sweet. flavor citrus hints of malts,fruity, has some sourness with a bit of sweetness. not to bad of a beer but nothing special about it it will be one f those beers that I will buy again"
"This is a good beer. No, I'm lying. This is a great beer. Though it won't be my highest rated, nor perhaps my favourite(though it will be damn close), this will perhaps be my most respected. Pours a ruby orange colour, with a head that's not quite two fingers. Plenty of victorian lace sticks to the glass, giving the impression that doilies are stuck on the glass. Beautiful to look at. First smell. Oooh, pleasant. I have the feeling after I eventually finish this divine nectar, my nose will still be inside the glass, sniffing at what once was. Big, bold malts, yeast and butter that reminds me of a bakery. Light pears and green apples. Even toffee. Smell this beer and the mind wanders to an old England countryside, where bicycles still outnumber the automobile. The taste. Oh, the taste. Beautiful. Big malt profile upfront, mellowed by a diacetyl flavour and texture. Soon follows a light fruit presence. Pears, apples and even a bit of apple cider. Toffee on the tongue as well, accompanied by a dark friend. Is it coffee? Could it be dark chocolate? I can't quite tell, but I also don't care. It's enjoyable, that's all that matters. For simplicity, I'll say it's both. Smooth, full bodied and heavy mouthfeel that gives the illusion I'm not drinking beer, I'm drinking nectar given by God himself. Drinkable. Too damn drinkable and too damn good. I've got half a glass left, and I don't want to finish it, knowing that once it's finished, it's gone. And I can't get another bottle for quite some time. A terrific beer. I highly suggest seeking this out to anyone and everyone who likes a good, wholesome ale."
"This beer pours orange and tan, with a thick lasting head. It's quite cloudy. Aroma is mild and earthy. Taste is biscuit maltiness balanced by mild hops. Mild, winey flavor. Finish is clean and dry. Light to medium bodied. Smooth. Overall, this is a very satisfying session ale."
"I like simple English pales, and this is a great study aide. Plus, its lower ABV doesn't interfere."
"Yeah, don't listen to me, it's a fine ale...sweet, and bitter, citric, and smooth...quite a nice little brew...go knock ourselves out..."
"A very good bitter (pale ale, whatever). It has a nice copper color and starts off with a nice head. The taste has very good fruit flavor combined with a noticeable hoppiness. Some sips weren't as good as others, but I'm not sure why. In the middle of my beer, I got a slice of angel food cake with pineapple icing. Perfect. The pineapple-like fruit tastes in the beer complemented the cake perfectly. I would highly suggest doing something similar. The bitterness helps the food match as well."
"Good balance and a surpisingly crisp finish lead to excellent drinkibility."
"An interesting brew don't think I would buy it again though."
"The taste was bitter, with some hop astringency. There was little malt character and it felt somewhat thin."
"Today, August 1st, is Yorkshire Day! As a proud Yorkshireman myself, this Yorkshire beer is raised high to all my Mates back in Yorkshire, England, including my fellow Tyke BA and good friend, BSF, who I met at Easter and whom is ironically betraying the clan by spending his Yorkshire Day darn sarf at the GBBF. Oh well"
"The mouthfeel is light, it beefs up towards the end of the sip from the carbonation and the texture of the hops. In all this reminds me a great deal of the English bitter that I just sampled rather than a pale, but it is an okay speciman either way. Not something that I would turn into a session beer though, I had to nurse this one."
"Although this beer makes the oft-made mistake of removing its ringwood yeast, it is good even after filtering and pastuerising. I would love to try this on cask in its true form."
"Notes: Beer has a nice feel on the tongue. Session quality. Aroma seems more pleasant and interesting than the taste."
"The taste was a decent mix of malt and hops but I think the hops won out in the end. The aftertaste is very dry and a bit nutty. The low level carbonation makes this a easy beer to put down and one sip naturally leads you to another. If it wasn't for the price barrier this would be in my usual list."
"It went down easy, and I probably could have a few in a sitting. A mediocre ale."
"Not a bad little ale"
"This is a great brew. It pours a slightly hazy orangey color. The carbonation is very mild. The head is pure white and long lasting, leaving very solid lace behind. The nose is of copious bitter and aroma hops and a little bit of maltiness. The taste is very complex with cedary, resiny hops dominating. There is also a dry yeastyness that is very evident, and pleasant. The malt is definitely in the background, but to me this is a good thing. I sense a slight astringency in the finish, though not overpowering. The mouthfeel of this beer is very creamy and smooth, I like the low carbonation. Highly drinkable, the low carbonation makes it less filling than lagers etc, I could through several of these back."
"Black Sheep Ale is a good to very good English Ale that--due to the sub-5% ABV--should be an excellent session beer. I will definitely buy more if I run across it again."
"Very easy drinking ale, good session beer."
"It has raw and wild feel and a fine Micro-brew-like quality. All in all this is a very tasty and balanced brew with an edge."
"Medium, cream-colored, dense, ice cream head. Swoops and arcs of lacing. Clear, reddish-amber beer. Nutty, tangy, fruity nose. Caramel front. Grapes, too maybe? Thick, tangy, caramel middle. Loads o'butter. More caramel in the finish with nutty crackers. Quite bitter. This is a nice, nutty, bitter, British session. I could drink it all night."
"A nice amber brew, with a fluffy white cap of foam. The aromas lean more towards the biscuity, bready malt side of things, but there are some nice floral hops in there as well. The taste is very bready and malty, but the hops do shine through in the finish. The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth and the drinkability is very good as well. I sampled this at the Harp in Picadilly, London."
"Notes: With this brewery producing this one along with the Holy Grail Pale Ale, I'm not certain why you would have both. I know this is the better of the two by far. Cheers!"
"Delightful, session, real-deal ale. This is quaffable in monster doses."
"It has an impressive head and an orange-amber color. The aroma has some reserved hop character as well as a sweet maltiness. The body is smooth with some fruit notes. There is a sublte anise and woody tastes that come out in the dry earthy hop finish. A good quaffer."
"Pours a nice deep golden color with a much larger head than was expected,very nice lacing.Great fruity aroma of oranges with a real light hop presence.Taste is a little subdued but nice,fruity from the yeast I presume with a light hop backbone I also get dry malt in the finish.Could this beer get easier to drink?hey I really like this beer and glad I have a case."
"Good bier."
"1pint.9oz brown bottle pours out a mostly clear, amber gold colour. The head is an offwhite, enormous froth of thick and sudsy foam which leaves massive lacing of all kinds. Odd aroma for an English ale, with nectarines, and what seems to be a tart apple note dominating the nose over the usual malts. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, smooth, and even. Taste is slightly bitter, with some funky hops going on. Malt profile is some very faint caramel. Earthy yeastiness, and some wild fruitiness provide most of the flavors. The hoppiness seems more herbal than fruity or floral in the taste. Spearmint comes to mind. It's light and refreshing and finishes with a herbal bitterness. This is, indeed, a Black Sheep, and would take me some time to grow accustomed to."
"Drinkability  A terrific easy-drinking English Pale Ale."
"pours out a very hazy and foggy amer-orange colour with a inch thich bone white head. lots of chunky lacing. very interesting nose....fruits and spice...mint and malts. smells wonderful! upon tasting....the first thing to strike the drinker is it's sessionability. flavourful and light bodied...the taste profile is of bready maltiness and yeasty fruitiness, all balanced very nicely. the hopping comes off to me as minty....quite appropriate in the mix. body is again medium to light, with a mineral twang no doubt from the water used. finishes balanced with a lingering metallic singe. quite drinkable and tasty. a fine english ale."
"I have been looking forward to trying this beer and we'll see if it does not disappoint. The color is like a summer brewed iced tea. The head is creamy and rich, almost like sea foam. Leaves a nice lacing on the glass. Fruity and pungent, earthy grains emanate from the beer with just a hint of chocolate sweetness. The taste is light, fruity and finishes dry with a pleasant bitterness that reminds me of dry cherries. Medium body of malt. Hops are earthy and give the beer a flavor of grassy rawness. A very enjoyable and flavorful English ale. Yummy."
"More orange in color than amber with a thin vail of head and not much stick. Aromas are dominated by bitter as is the taste. The bitter is more of the bitter found in black licorice. The beer is medium bodied and fairly crisp. The finish is clean with a mild citrus and even some ripe pear or apple flavors showing. This is a sound brew but nothing astounding, though I bet it would be much better on tap."
"Good pour, a somewhat cloudy-appearing amber color with brownish-yellow, coppery highlights. Good, frothy head of large, cream-colored bubbles with decent cling that stays steady at about one finger deep. Freshly yeasty up front in the aroma, with mild breadiness... not much malt to speak of; hops are soft and fruity with a green-apple character. Flavor is also yeasty at the outset; immediately this is a very British pale ale. With warmth, flavors emerge suggesting rye bread (caraway seeds) and fruit, particularly green apple and even banana (?). Leafy hop with a twang that develops substantially with warmth. Mouthfeel is firm, smooth; lightly carbonated and with a decent hop tingle; aftertaste lingery with some chewiness. Good drinkability; after sampling the first half of the bottle for review, I matched up the rest of this beer with a pot roast, to very good effect. All in all a decent beer but not to the point where I'll be consistently shelling out $4.00 per bottle."
"Overall Impression: All in all, a good beer. A bit too dry for my taste. Thusly, the hop bitterness gets a little puckering. Not sure where the beer fits in the quality spectrum of English-made beer as whole, though."
"Poured a dark gold/orange colour with a big white head that left lots of lace. Nose that was lots of malt with maybe some oranges. A wonderful taste greets the tongue - malt and some hops. Mouthfeel was quite good. The beer felt alive in the mouth and the aftertaste was wonderfully hoppy - just the bitterness I like. Good stuff. The stronger than usual ale aftertaste is just what I look for. A darned good brew."
"The aftertaste is clean and not assertive. Bitterness remains. Not blown away, but very quaffable. If your in for a session beer this is it. If your looking for an adventure, then maybe not."
"Overall another nice ale from Black Sheep Brewery that was very drinkable and refreshing. My only fault with it was the high ester content in the finish that could become overpowering for many people IMHO."
"Pourred a very nice copper brew with a with a thick foamy head that disapear a bit quickly. Good malt nose and taste until I feel the sharp sour and metallic aftertaste. Wow, such a great start but a very disapointing ending. Below average for this one but I would still be curious to try other product from this brewery."
"Orange gold color. Head is about medium, white and frothy. Aroma is malty and earthy, with a hint of fruit sweetness. A lighter to medium bodied bitter. Malts are mild touches of fruit and a little earthy. Hops are slightly spicy. A fairly mild English bitter. Taste is a little watery. But, it has a really nice yeastiness and fruitiness to the flavor. Light and refreshing. Mouthfeel is thin. Finish is dry and clean. Aftertaste is fruity and sweet."
"This one pours a slightly amber color with a moderate that leaves very little lacing on the glass. The aroma is mostly malty and a little sweet. Nothing too impressive there. The taste is slightly bitter with a dry finish. Easy to drink, but not extremely exciting. I could see having several of these and enjoying it quite a bit."

"A cloudy golden colour with little head. Left a small, delicate lace on the glass. Pleasant, moderately strong smell with good mouthfeel. Easy to drink, all around good brew; fairly typical English ale.This one almost reminds me of Belhaven Scottish ale. A great brew for the money and considering the style it is."
"A typical English ale, which can be both good and bad. Good in the sense that this was a quality brew, with nice solid malt - some biscuit - and ample, broad hops bittering. Bad in the sense that this ale was pretty one-dimensional. Once you get past the up-front flavors, there is just not a lot going on with this beer. Monochromatic."
"The beer pours a hazy golden color with a frothy white head. The aroma is musty with hint of maltiness. The traditional residue of English ale yeast is present. The taste is terrible. The beer is quite watery, bitter, slightly malty, musty, and dry. The mouthfeel is decent. It's a light bodied beer; smooth, dry, but in need of carbonation. It drinks fine, although it's unlikely for me to ever have another."
"When poured into my glass, this beer had a medium sized white head with fine-small bubbles.The head was long-lasting with this beer and the body was somewhat cloudy with no carbonation observed.The hue was orange and the lacing was excellent.The nose was somewhat hoppy and the flavor was bitter with a fore and aftertaste to it.The mouthfeel was a little tingly on my tongue.Not bad for a Bitter as it was not as bitter as I was anticipating."
"Poured up a good rough head over a clear, nicely copperish beer. The head didn't hang around, but the beer still showed good lace every step of the way. Soft, nutty, earthy smell. Hoppy, bitter and dry. Stays on the mouth bitter and slightly metallic for some time. A comfortable enough drink, but not something I'd go looking for."
"Toward the end, the sourness changed to bittersweet. This is a beer to linger over, because it evolves. Interesting."
"Got to get some more of these."
"Half a liter bottle poured into a pint glass. It pours a light amber color with 2 massive fingers of head. The head really sticks around, and the lacing is nice. The smell is fruity, with some hops aroma, and a little butter (diacetyl?). The taste is fairly hoppy for a pale, and has a bit of spice to it, maybe nutmeg or clove. The finish is nice and crisp. Fairly nice mouthfeel as well. The drinkability is very nice, and I could drink plenty of this classic English ale."
"Not entirely spectacular but still a solid pale ale. Good head, cloudy orange-amber coloration, and just the right amount of bitterness. The aftertaste reminds you you've been drinking a good pale ale long after you finish it. Most notable is the bottle, though, which is not only adorned with hop vines, but also weighs in at about a deuce and a half."
"500 ml bottle. Not bottle-conditioned. Best before end of March, 2003."
"I had this at the Classic City Brewfest in Athens this year. I was less than impressed by this. I've had some other bitters before, but this had perhaps the highest diacetyl level I've had in a beer and I'm not really all that perceptive to the flavor. Just a so-so bitter."
"Oh well, here goes the real review! A muddy deep amber color on the pour, head is modest and frothy, light tan in color, as it erodes a fine sheet of lace clings mightily to the glass. Fresh malt and lightly sweet is the nose, start is lightly sweet, thickly malt, the top is middling in feel. Finish is a tad tart, mildly acidic, the hops pleasing in their spicy bitterness, quite dry and a drinkable beer, well worth a try if you are into English Ales."
"Prost!"
"in Britain."
"Clear shiny copper in color. Creamy full rich off-white fluffy head. Laced the glass nicely and stayed in clumps all the was to the bottom. Smell was somewhat acidic, floral, and faint citrus. Some faint metallic smells. Taste was very much traditional english bitter. Nice crisp hop presence. Lots of citrus, grapefruit tart flavors. Sticky hop resin to it at times, which is a good thing to me. Very good flavors, minimal malt presence which is perfectly fine. This beer really grows on you, and turns out very impressive. Light to medium bodied, carbonation is just right. Made for a very drinkable beer., before I knew it, my glass was empty ! Perfect with grilled chicken, red potatos meal. A very good English Ale. I had this tonight in honor of the PGA Cup Matches completed today at work. US 19-GB&I 7.What a great event !"
"The first thing you notice about this beer is the tremendous, solid, rocky white head.  It leaves a web of lace all the way to the bottom of the glass.  The smell is very subtly hoppy.  This is a very dry, cidery beer, with woody characteristics.  The finish has great balance, and a lingering bitterness.  Overall, a great beer...certainly worth trying."
"Orangey body is topped by a huge active fluffy, sticky head, leaving excellent lacing behind. Nose is hoppy, fruity and a pinch of British sulfur. Taste has fruits (apples?) vying with malt sweetness, wrapped up in a buttery blend, and a bit of hop bite in the end. A really sterling example of English Bitter."
"Notes: I am quite pleased with this brew, flavours and aromas bouncing all over with an impressive head. All of this is the big picture for what an English ale is supposed to be."
"Kind of edgy bland flavour. Nice hop bite and decent slightly roasted bitterness, but doesn't do enough to excite me, slight watery finish, i will give it another go after seeing its decent ratings, but i can't really see myself liking it that much."
"This beer is really good. Beautiful copper colored brew with nice lace head that follows the brew to the bottom. A nice balance between malt and hops that lead to crisp dry finish."
"Nice bitter from Black Sheep. Copper beneath a thin and sticky head. Well balanced caramel malt and earthy hop with a mildly tart and fruity finish. More flavor than some other brews that like to call themselves ESB's. Pricy, but worth a try."
