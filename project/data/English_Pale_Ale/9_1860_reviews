"Yeah, it's just OK out of the bottle cold. Cellar temp knocks it up a point in flavor and aroma. On tap, it is another ball game. This has been far and away the most popular draft beer I have sold in my 40 year restaurant career so far . It just fit the old colonial early american atmosphere of my tavern so well, it was a natural."

"O: A truly great beer can stand the test of time (unless they're hoppy, natch), and this hasn't. If you still see this at your Neighborhood Liquor Store™ and you're considering picking this up, don't do it! Get something else instead."

"O: I don't want to completely trash this beer, but I simply do not understand its appeal. In my opinion, Whitbread is one-dimensional and lacking in balance."
"A blast from the past and a timely reminder of how much bottled beer in Britain has improved in recent years."
"The beer is a light brown in color with some orange in there too. The head is pretty good too, it's got a nice tan color to it. The aroma that this beer has is something really good to me. Something that I'm unsure of how to describe. It smells sweet and really enjoyable. It's gotta be what ever malts they've used in this beer. The taste also carries over that sweetness and coats your mouth with some really nice sweet malts. I wish I knew what they put in this because it reminded me of my childhood somehow. I found the mouthfeel to be a little watery but overall this beer is quite good."
"Without a doubt, Whitbread Pale Ale is a solid ""session"" beer. Give this one a try."
"Got this from a friend. Pours an amber color with a small one finger white lace that leaves quickly. Alot of carbonation after the pour. Nothing disernable in either the smell or taste, very bland in my opinion. I am glad that I got a chance to try this however it will be the only time."
"Not much complexity to this brew, but makes for a strong sessionable beer."
"All in all, I love this beer. Malts, malts and more malts. Very drinkable."
"A muddy chestnut brown color with a fair white head and decent lacing. The aroma is a brown sugar sour mash combo. The flavor brings more of the same. A mild Jack Daniels sweetness and subtle maple butterscotch theme. A nice midland body brew with decent carbonation and good drinkability. The English Pale is a little different than most American Pale Ales. Not the same hop bitterness but quite decent in this example."
"Poured a very dark orange color with a nice white head. Nose is deep malt nose little hops. Taste is fruity a bit, chewy and malty but lacks any real hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is nice and thick, coating, chewy and tasty. Very drinkable and easy drinking."
"This is an interesting brew to say the least. Different smell, different taste. If they could fix the mouth on this, this may be more drinkable for me."
"drinkability- not bad, but really worth mentioning"
"Conclusion: Not a home run by any means (a bit drier and it would have been much better). This would be a pretty solid English-style Pale, with an interesting character, if not for the somewhat odd tart fruit on the finish. Definitely more character than Bass though."
"D: This to me is just an average beer, perhaps I've grown accustomed to the hopped american styles as opposed to the english styles. Either way, its not bad, I don't think its great!"
"Overall- Full flavored and tasty. Tasted very fresh. A good session Ale."
"D: Yet another beer I'm torn over. It's quite drinkable as is. The problem is that it doesn't fit the style well at all. I guess I best split the difference with the scoring on this one."
"D - Easily drinkable. ABV right in line, and the flavors are muted. Carbonation on the low side limits stomach filling."
"Unimpressive"
"The first sip tasted quite good but it subsequently became more boring. Not a bad beer by all means, I could probably drink this stuff all night if given the opportunity, I'm a sucker for English ales, but there are definitely better Bitters out there."
"Overall: This beer was ok. Nothing I would seak out, but it wasnt bad either. Just boring, even for a pale."
"D- not bad session beer to enjoy but it is filling. A nice beer to have with a game."
"Pretty good frothy head, continuous ringer left behind with froth around the glass. Amber color, darker than I thought it would be for a Pale. Sweet, malty, caramel with a bit of the hops coming through at the front, not much left in the after. Scent of sweet malt. Mouthfeel was not impressive but not bad at all. Very easy to drink."
"D: This drinks pretty well, but it's quite atypical for a pale ale. Quite malty and sweet. Interesting, but it just seems a little unfocused."
"Medium body, semi-sweet finish that lingered a bit. I gave higher points for drinkability as I could knock a bunch back, but only because it lacks punch and tons of deep flavor -- making it a bit easier drinking considering the style. Not a favorite, but not the worst I've had."
"With all that said, it's no surprise that drinkability also sits as decidedly decent. I wouldn't pick up a six-pack, but you could do much, much worse than Whitbread's pale ale."
"Bottom line, try it, you will like it, if you can find it."
"D: A unique yeast profile is what distinguishes it from several of its peers and also produces a classic session beer."
"Overall a good pale. Alcohol taste is a bit strong (in my opinion) for this style, but good flavor, decent atmosphere. Good quaff."
"D - I am surprised at how much I am enjoying this beer and will try this one again."
"The taste is a tad bit less than what the aroma reveals. It is a medium bodied beer, a bit chewy, with loads of sweet caramel malts. There is definitely a full palate of fruity maltiness, a very bready backbone to the beer, balanced out pretty nicely by traditional Noble hops. There is a bit of a butterscotch, diacetyl characteristic that diminishes the taste to a degree. This beer seems to have a higher ABV than its 5.7% given it slightly thick and slightly cloyingly sweet syrupy mouthfeel and texture. There is perhaps a raisiny note or two towards the finish. The beer is defined by its sweet caramel malts, its malty fruitiness, the Noble hops, and the diacetyl lurking throughout. This is a nice pale ale, a bit stonger than one might expect, but full of character and worth seeking out."
"I got this beer in a variety pack from World Market. This wasn't a bad ale but it was not great either. I was expecting more from it. I would try this again to see if I just got a bad bottle in the pack but I would not rush to specifically look for it."
"The aroma is malty with diacytle yeast effects. There is also plenty of hops, toffee, and leaves. The appearance is amber with an average sized foamy head. The taste is like the aroma with a hint of sour dough. The palate is thick and smooth. Overall I like this one and it's one of the better easy to find beers."
"After reading the label and looking here I confirmed my initial suspician that this ""English Pale Ale"" had not been brewed in the mother country. What tipped me off initially was the fancy screw off cap which screamed DOMESTIC! Considering the value of this beer I was not upset that it's contract brewed here in the states but after sampling I got upset that apparantly this beer is rushed through production, this is indicitive of the extremely noticeable diacetyl aroma and flavor. Now the ""buttery"" affect from the diacetyl isn't completely offsetting to me, in fact I sort of enjoyed this taste in the brews I've sampled from Shipyard Brewing. It's very prominant and almost overpowering in this beer though. This one looks decent in the pint glass, nice copper color, small fizzy white head with decent lacing. Creamy and nicely satisfying mouthfeel. Lightly hopped even for an English Pale Ale, perhaps more hops would help offset the boring buttery flavor. One sixer and done for me."
"Medium watery brown color with a creamy tan head. Nice lacing and retention. Aroma has some diacetyl and apple juice along with caramel maltiness. Flavor is English toffee malt with a touch of darker fruits and a nice appreciable earthy hop finish. Not a lot of bitterness, but nice and dry. Mouthfeel has a nice heft to it, with appropriate carbonation and little wateriness. Not bad at all."
"It's very enjoyable, quite tasty, and overall the character is amostly winey, raisiny, spicy sweet-sour-tart fruit quality throughout with a very lkight leafy bitterness. It's highly drinkable and light, but with a creamy feel."
"M&D- Feels and drinks like high quality mineral water."
"D - I wouldn't mind having this again from time to time."
"Drinkability is good on this beer. More than one would make for a nice afternoon."
"Wow, this was blended well and very easilly drinkable. I could drink a session of these easilly despite the ABV. I'll be getting more."
"D- I could drink this again, but wouldn't at all go out of my way to get it."
"Easy, easy, easy to drink--but the same way chocolate milk is. Not enough bite or distinctive flavor for me. However, harmless and quite filling."
"I personally wouldn't recommend this one..."
"D: Average drinkability, being fruity, dry, but overall worth a try."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into pint glass. Darker tan than what I usually expected of a pale ale with a slim frothy head. Smell revealed a very buttery aroma with a strong malt overtone. The best description of the taste I can give is that of a caramel rich/non-sweet butterscotch flavor. Overall I find this to be an excellent pale ale, but not the kind of thing I could indulge in - a great beer to experience in single offerings."
"Smooth and crisp, this is a very simple and drinkable beer."
"Serving type: bottle"
"With a lot of the English elements, this is an interesting beer. I wish it had a stronger hop presence."
"Finish brings in some hop bitterness that takes over once the biscuit/bread goes into the background. Medium to light bodied."
"M/D- The feel is sticky and smooth. The carbonation is there but its light and doesn't add much tingle. I would gladly down a full 6 pack of this. The sweetness could get to you ventually though. A clean and refreshing brew that doesn't skimp out on flavor."
"Pours out a slightly hazy amber brew with thin white head. Smells slightly caramelly ,malty. Taste very malty slightly tart in the end. Really low in hop flavor. Mouthfeel a little thin.Drinkablility is pretty good not really too high in alcohol. An ok beer , ive had better english pale ales a little too tart for me."
"Head dissapates rather quickly and gives way to an amber orangish color. Smells of white breads, slight yeast and some hops in the background. Hops bitterness with a slight breadsy taste and almost muted citrus. Pretty much a lighter-medium mouthfeel. Pretty good drinkability, malt comes a little more as it warms."
"A decent English style beer for the states, though certainly not the best example you could find worldwide. Also, the alcohol is way to high and apparent here to make it a session beer."
"D-at first sip this beer seemed ok,but it really missed the mark(BIG TIME) from the middle to the finish,I will try other styles by Samuel Whitbread,but you would have to be pretty sneaky to get me to drink this Pale Ale again!"
"D - Reasonably drinkable, but it is a bit overcarbonated and the bitterness is harsh and unpleasant."
"Drinkability: If it wasn't for the corny flavor, this might be good."
"A robust, bready taste that is a mix of some hops and dry malts and even a sharp acidicness. A full-bodied beer that went down easily but still left a dry and smokey finish. The hops are used pretty good here, and overall a nice session beer that I look forward to drinking again."
"On the whole, this is a drinkable beer. A nice example of a pale ale."
"D - A decent beer. I would say it is one of the best pale ales I've had, but I admit I haven't had the privilege of trying a lot of what the world has to offer just yet. I could easily see this replacing Bass as my go-to English pale ale on account of the price tag, if for no other reason."
"D- Have it all the time. It's good. A fine example of an English Pale Ale, it's clean and refreshing, goes well on its own, in warm or cold weather, as a social beer, and with food. Pretty versatile and always refreshingly tasty. Just don't drink it expecting to be blown away, just relax and enjoy."
"The bottle was drinkable, but this was nothing too special for me."
"D: All night long. This is a pale ale that is very drinkable, yet not boring like other session beers."
"An uninteresting beer kind of weak in the flavor department. I don't think there is anything here that makes the beer have any true character."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, it's a decent beer to drink for a long time if you're in the mood for this style, but overall I consider it just an ordinary beer."
"Amber pour with little offwhite head. Light smell or sourness, caramel, and a metallicness to it as well. Same tastes, sour, caramel and metal, but I didn't get much in the way of hops as the description states. Boring, bland, and possibly a bit past its prime for this particular bottle. World Market doesn't seem to be the best place to get fresh beer... Thanks to RateBeer.com however for the MIDI version of the song ""Another One Bites The Dust"" in celebration of my 200th rating on my last beer."
"Drinkability is very high for a pale ale. This is a good session beer."
"The beer poured a clear amber with a white head. The aroma was good and strong of a good mix of malt and floral hops. The taste if very biscuity with a dry hop finish that has a floral edge to it. The feel is nice and wet with a good dry finish, quite nice. A very nice beer I can see setting up a session or two with this one."
"Pours a translucent amber brown. The head is medium and off-white. It fades away pretty quickly. Smells of English malt, with a yeasty character. Taste is malty, buttery, with a hint of tea. There is a good amount of bittering hops to round things out. Mouthfeel is rich, and carbonation levels are slightly high for the style but otherwise good. Pretty drinkable, not really a session ale in the British sense (due to its relatively high alcohol) but I could drink a few of these."
"Mouthfeel is pretty standard for the style, not watery and not overly carbonated. It isn't a tough beer to drink, but it doesn't have that sessionable feel that the style should."
"Decent ale...would have another for certain, but the sweetness would get tired after more than 2."
"Pourd a very nice dark auburn/copper color, with great head and decent lacing. Has a very low scent, which seemed much too malty for a pale ale (in my opinion). Low taste, hardly anything there, not really a hoppiness, maltiness, or anything, beyond a very weak, almost water flavor. Went down fine, but not great. I doubt I'll get any more."
"Overall, pretty typical for a British beer, which is not a bad thing for me. Not as good as Fuller's London Pride, but I can see bringing this into the rotation if Fuller's isn't availabe."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: This beer has a light body and is appropriately carbonated, nothing gets in the way of this brew's flavor profile. The finish is slick and leaves a slight warmth with the diacetyl that I am picking up. After a few seconds the finish becomes much drier leaving the tongue looking for something to rehydrate it. This is a beer I'd not be opposed to buying again, however, I don't see anything that is all that great about it. It didn't WOW me. I find it to be a classic example of the style and an overall good beer, but nothing to write home about."
"Drinkability : une bonne bière pale ale, même en bouteille"
"The finish was medium duration and pleasant, though I never did detect the bitterness expected of this style. Actually, this resembled more an English Ale/Amber mix than an ESB, but not a bad offering."
"D: Drinkable I suppose, but nothing about it makes me want many more. It may be a shade better than Bass though. I guess I just prefer a nice, hoppy APA to this English stuff."
"A rich and malty EPA, but the surprisingly high ABV may cut into its drinkability. 5.7% is whopping for a British beer."
"pours a reddish brown color with a minimal head, that disolves almost immediately. has a great malty smell to it, the malt smell overpowers everything, almost like a molasses or mild caramel scent, its great. as i taste it, its pretty darn good, unlike most pale ales there is no taste of hops, its more of a brown ale than anything, but whitbread has been making it for over 260 years so i think they know more than me. pretty good beer, i love me some newcastle and this is somewhat similar. has a nice smooth taste to it, very easy to drink, i'm a fan."
"D -Highly quaffable, fruity and mild. Very thirst quenching and a great example of the English bitter style."
"Drinkability: It's certainly an atypical pale ale. I'm all for brewers playing around with styles, but this beer's differences are not in line with my preferences."
"definitely in the english style in appearance and taste. pours a bright amber color with a off white one finger head and moderate lacing. mostly caramel with a slightly fruity nose. taste is a little to sweet, mostly malt with a hint of fruit maybe grapes come to mind. mouthfeel is ok. not my favorite beer to review but worth a try if you like the style."
"The Whitbread Pale Ale is a decent English bitter, although hardly bitter tasting at all. The aroma is malty sweet and fruity (pears). The taste is dominated by pale malt that masks most of the underlying Styrian Golden hop flavors, although their presence does provide some balance. The WPA has a medium light body and moderately low carbonation that is perfect for a session beer. I was surprised to see that the abv was as high as 5.7%. The beer finishes semi-dry and very mild bitterness that lingers in the aftertaste. Overall, I thought this was a very decent English pale ale."
"On the upside, the lack of extremes in the brew make it highly drinkable. Especially in a social setting where your mind might be elsewhere."
"This is not a English pale ale but a Belgian pale ale in all but name. And a pretty average one too."
"beer only gets a average from me,not one id buy or encourage my freinds to try."
"If I could settle on a single beer for a daily drinker this one would be in the running."
"D- What do you know? I like it. Can I have another?"
"This is a nice average English beer brewed in the US. I like how the label says they use Styrian Golding hops, probably because I homebrew and need to know these things. It smells malty, tastes malty, and is typical of an English Pale Ale--wow we Americans like hops in our Pale Ales-and this shows that they don't in England. I don't detect much hop flavor at all-I'm guessing they use Styrian Goldings as bittering, and leave out flavor & aroma hops. The beer pours a deep amber color, produces a medium head with decent lacing. It is unbalanced since it favors the maltiness of beer, however the specialty malts used are good, and makes it a better than average beer. Not bad overall, very clean beer."
"This beer is appropriately named as a very unexciting beer. Its not bad, but not good. Its not a beer you'll remember. Very light aftertaste of fruit, but not much of one. Very light aroma that isn't bad but not strong enough to be exciting. I can't really stress how average this beer is. If a bar has Whitbread on tap, I'm sure they have something better on tap."
"A middle-of-the-road brew. Sweet. Easy enough to drink, but rather boring. I would like to compare this to the original English brew. This one didn't really ""do it"" for me, though not ""bad""."
"Cheers!"
"D: Being as it's pretty much just an average beer...I wouldn't actively seek this out, but if offered one, I wouldn't turn it down either."
"12 oz. bottle- color of dark amber , with a decent whitish head - nose of sweet maltyness , melon , dried fruit , and no hops??  taste of roasted malts , sweet maraschino cherries , very subtle hops , and other red fruit - body is medium , smooth , and with medium to high carbonation  aftertaste of cherries or candied fruit , and maple"
"Edit: After reading a few pages of reviews, I'm puzzled by the mixed reception this beer has gotten (to put it kindly!). Perhaps there are quality control issues?"
"Poured a hazy amber with a creamy off-white head. Pleasing aroma of malt and grain, with bittering hops in the background. Taste is straighforward and pleasing if -- like me -- you're a fan of traditional British ale. Not overly complex, and the finish is a little flat, but all in all a good English Pale Ale."
"The finish is so astringent and gummy that it almost completely takes away from any positives achieved by the consistency and carbonation of the drink. I really dislike this beer and am thankful Trader Joe's has a 100% satisfaction policy on their products because this is going back."
"Poured a light amber, almost yellow with a huge white head that fell and left a thick lacing. Aroma of sourdough bread and a hint of rye, but very light overall. Somewhat watery and highly carbonated. Left an odd aftertaste. I wouldn't have another."
"Definite drain pour. Ugh."
"This brew isn't bad but isn't great either. Mild hop bitterness, a tad of fruitiness, but a watery mouthfeel. I wonder what kind of water they have in Cincinnati..."
"Not what I'd expect from a pale ale. Very chewy in the mouth. No hop flavor whatsoever. Tastes alot like malt extract at first. And like wheat bread. But also tastes almost like gelatin, very strongly. Very offputting. And sticks in my mouth. I'm definitely not enjoying this one. I think I'll stop 3/4 of the way down."
"Smell is of yeast with faint hops. Not particularly complex. Taste is average at best. I find that it's a bit more rounded at 55'F rather than straight out of the fridge. Fairly drinkable. Goes well with Glouster cheddar and a couple rounds of darts."
"This pale ale pours a nice deep amber, with a good head head that trails off to some nice lacing. The smell is a bit light and sweet, more caramel and a bit less fruit. The taste is sweeter than I would expect for a pale ale, but pleasant and caramel maltiness. Kind a nice mouth feel and a bit of a sharp finish. Quite drinkable too."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle, into a pint glass. The beer poured a deep orange, with a good 1 inch head, that left nice lacing along the glass. The aroma is slightly citrus, but mostly caramel. The taste is nothing like a pale ale. The flavor is heavily caramel, not at all like a pale ale should be. This reminds me alot of Sam Adams Boston Ale. Not whats expected from a pale ale, but nonetheless, a very enjoyable beer. A very sessionable beer."
"Clear golden amber.Full, billowy pale tan head of moderate duration which leaves a fair amount of lace as it drops. A bit of chill haze. Musty, sour, bready malts on the nose, like pale malts blended with sourdough bread starter. Smell seems a bit off, but then again, the last time I had this on a regular basis is 1992 and we all know what happened meanwhile don't we? Wow, this is MUCH sweeter than I remember it, and the sweetness is complete with a fuller -albeit duller- mouthfeel. What happened to the pale, light, crisp ale I remember? I know I'm getting older but I remember a much different brew. Tangy and bittersweet as I recall, but loaded with the more of that buttery, butterscotch off-flavor that I picked up in the Stone Mil yesterday. Carobonation is mild to medium,and body is -again- fuller than I recall from many years past, being medium-full / moderate here. Chewy, but not necessarily in a good way. Fruity and vegetal, with notes of anise, cherry, ginger/gingerbread, and marshmallow . . . If this wasn't already an alcohol delivery vehicle I'd call it a good candidate for a drain pour - maybe it's just me, but this just ain't cutting it. There's a creamy-lactic quality here which makes me wonder if there's not some run-off from the Mackeson's used in the making of this? I'll re-try this some time after scoring a fresher bottle, but . . . I'm surprised that a brew (and my palate, too) has changed so much in the past 14 years."
"One thing, I think this beer has a superior drinkability in part that the ABV isn't as high as most and that the flavor is mild."
"Best thing is, one glass gave me a nice mellow buzz. At $7 for six pack, I'll buy this one again."
"IMO the English brew their pale ales a bit too weak for my tastes. I love beers that are up in your face screaming bloody murder...this one whispers. Also, I didn't realize until I looked this beer up on this website that it is brewed by the folks that make Mackeson's XXX Stout...which is one of my all time favorite beers."
"D: A lot of character and depth for an ""English pale ale"". Enjoyable beer."
"This is a light, carbonated brew. It has some fruity light hop scents. Taste is nice, I pick up a lot of apple in it, almost like an apple juice, theres some sweet apple taste to it, not like a cider though and not offensive or too sweet. This is a pretty decent ale, I have a 6 pack, but i'd probably purchase another in the future some time."
"Pours amber. Thin tan head. Not much retention,but good lacing. Smell is pleasent, but weak. Mostly malt. Body is on the light side with some carbonation. Taste is light. Malty up front,with a bit of a fruity hops in the finish. Nothing offensive here, so give it a shot."
"Poured a crystal-clear chestnut color with large puffy slightly off-white head. Minimal lacing. Smell is very slight with sloght notes of malt present. Taste is malty with sparse or no hops to be found. Finish shows a touch of hops, but nothing major. A somewhat boring, easy drinking ale that seems to be made with the attempt to offend no one."
"Whitbread Pale Ale was a deep amber color with a light tan head. The head stuck around for a while, leaving a little lace behind. The aroma was sweet with plenty of crystal malt. The taste was mostly malty as well. It was a little sweet upfront with a little more balance towards the finish. It was a medium bodied beer with light to medium carbonation. This was a decent beer, but one is enough."
"Notes: Pretty smooth but this beer just doesn't jive right. The mix is not that appealing. Forgettable other than the appearance."
"Easy to drink, light with some nice flavors, a nice session brew."
"Unpleasant. It's been quite a few years since I had this in the UK, but surely that was vastly better than this swill. Does look nice though."
"I wasn't too excited about this beer at first, but it has really grown on me. A inoffensive, malty session beer that I seem the be returning to in between my 'big' beers for a change of pace. A nice interpretation of an english pale. You can't beat the price!"
"Clear, deep amber with an off-white head. The foam was fairly dense and left behind a solid sheet of lace as it receded. Malty, brown sugar aroma with a bit of fruit and light floral hops. Mild bitterness that grows into the finish. Caramel to start, but malt flavour dropped away quickly. Lingering grassy hop flavour. Overall, not that appealing. Light bodied with a slightly buttery texture. I was hoping for a little more from this one. Not entirely bad, but not very good and not a very good example of the English style."
"Overall: Not a bad pale ale. Worth a try."
"12 oz. bottle poured out an amber hue with a minimal head. The rich amber color doesn't look like a typical pale ale. It smelled very hoppy and of a sweet, fruit flavor. Upon tasting it, there seemed to be a cherry-like flavor. The hop flavor was subtle compared to the aroma. It was crisp and smooth. I'd call it very drinkable."
"The price grabbed me and will continue to lead me back: $8.99 for a 12 pk in SE Wisconsin, a great value."
"Drinkability: Not something I enjoyed very much; way too sweet and unbalanced"
"Bottle pours a light cola brown bubbly ale. A frothy foam is well sustained, nice looking, crystal clear body. Aromas are deep and caramel like, lots of malt in this one. I pick up a bit of cherry and roasted coffee like aromas. A medium bodied brew, very sweet and malty. To me, it's almost like a brown ale, but I'm not altogether familiar with the British pale ale style. Hops make a minor backup in the end, nothing citrusy or pinelike in an American brew. Like others have said, this one has a bit too much sweetness and detracts from the hops. Overall, this is a pretty decent beer, overpriced at the local liquor store, but worth the single purchase."
"This beer is the color of rich, strong, ice tea with a nice thick and creamy head that leaves good lacing. It isn't too pale for a pale ale. Aromas are faint but of sweet malt and musty grain. The flavor is mostly dominated by this same malted grain sweetness, tempered by some wet cardboard and bready tastes. The hops definately play second fiddle here, but are fresh and fruity tasting, if very subdued. The mouthfeel is lovely, creamy and mid-bodied. As a ""pale ale"" this is definately an oddball in my book, but very good and drinkable none the less."
"Poured into a standard pint from a 12oz'er ... typical amber color with a thick, off-white head that retained well. Intricate lacing in the pint. Nose is malty and not a lot else ... smells home brew-esque. Bready and ever so slightly sweet smell. Taste is definitely of malt and on the sweeter side. Where are the hops? No hop balance, especially for a pale ale style beer. Mouthfeel is smooth and light/medium. Finishes sweet. More like a nut brown ale or something. This beer is drinkable, but doesn't impress in any particular way. It's okay, but not outstanding. Maybe worth a try, but don't expect anything too exciting from this one, especially if you expect to encounter a beer with decent hop character."
"Overall: Fruity but balanced. A nice English Pale. I especially like the mouthfeel."
"Mouth feel is medium bodied and carbonated well, but the odd sweetness ruins this one for me."
"Overall it's decent. I enjoy it, but i dont ever seeing myself going out and picking up a six pack of it, just one or two every once and a while."
"About average drinkability, could've been a contender. Usually a beer of this ABV hides these kind of faults. make up your own mind, maybe this kicks ass in the heartland??"
"Would I buy this again? The ultimate question. First time in years I've seen it here in New England, but I would."
"Clear copper color with an orangey-beige foamy head of meringue that fills a good inch of the glass and sits back down quickly to a thin cap with lace rising up the sides. Faint aroma of biscuity malt and sweet fruit. Flavor is even and balanced, doughey malts, a hint of cinnamon and some ripe apple. Grassy hops ride beneath, adding a fine tingle that complements the flavor. Mouthfeel is full and satisfying, moderate to heavy carbonation adding a bubbly flourish in the finish. Good session beer, pretty balanced and inoffensive without being over the top in any aspect."
"A simple beer. Looks like a pale ale, smells slightly like one. It has a syrupy malt smell to it. The taste isn't spectacular or exciting. A plain taste, with some sweetness to it. A bit of carbonation. I wouldn't buy this, but it's not the worst I've ever had."
"Drinkability- Not to say the beer didn't taste good, but any kind of fruity beer doesn't register as something I can drink copious quantities of."
"D: I hate to ""slam"" a beer but this one is outrageously bland. Maybe my anger during tasting has prevented me from discerning more subtle flavours, but I still think it's not worth the money nor the expectation of a long-established beer like this. Definitely the worst-ever bottled British beer I've tasted, provided it was not wrongly-handled at certain points during the whole brewing and packaging process."
"Its drinkable, but its not desired. This is not horrible, but its a one-and-done for me."
"Overall drinkability is moderate here. I like this just fine, but don't love it. Those who are looking for a completely non-hopped pale ale to whet the appetite might do well to start here."
"Not a bad brew, but not a great one either. I'll stop at one."
"Neither bad nor good....'interesting' describes it best for me."
"Notes: My sample was ""brewed and bottled for Whitbread PLC by Chiswells, London ECI, England"""
"Over all, I find it to be a drinkable English Pale Ale and if it were available locally, I'd buy it from time to time."
"I would have love trying one of these from the 50's from a pub in Sheffield, Yorkshire, or even later as the national group Whitbread began brewing near Blackburn, Lancashire - but ""brewed and bottled under the strict supervision of Brewmasters of Interbrew UK LTD., by contract in Cincinnati, OH, USA - I'll take a pass!"
"Opinion: Well, here I sit at the point of indecision that we all get ourselves into. I don't really care for British ales, but I keep trying them to make sure. I suppose according to style, this beer probably fits the mold pretty well. I don't care for the blend of flavors, myself."
"Poured to an amber color with a good head that lasted. Very malty with little hop odor or flavor. Not a bad mouthfeel with an average finish. Drinkable, but not something you need to go out of your way for. Add enough hops for it to make a difference and call me."
"The taste is exactly like the aroma; slightly hoppy with a dry toast body. I wont go out of my way to buy this again but I wouldn't turn down a free one either."
"Poured into an Imperial pint glass this amber-colored pale ale displayed a thick white head that sustained itself for several minutes. The brilliant clarity and lace left down the sides of the glass enhance the appearance of this ale. The aroma is was fruity and ful of apple skins and apricots. The flavor is malty, quite fruity and tart, espcially towards the finish. An ale of fairly full body, with a rather smooth mouthfeel, Whitbread comes across as a fairly drinkable ale that's just shy of being too sweet. (This beer would be much too sweet for hopheads.) I would prefer some more bittering hops in this beer, but it's still rather drinkable. Unfortunately for Whitbread, if I want an American-brewed English ale, I prefer to brew it myself."
"Drinkability: I could see getting this again as a trade when JWD's isn't available. Compared with Goose or SN, for the same price, I'd prefer this taste."
"Not bad; unremarkable, but not bad at all."
"Deep amber color with a large white head. The head retention is nice. Sticks to the glass a little. Smells malty with a touch of butterscotch. Meduim body with a little carbonation. The taste is pretty much your standard English Pale Ale. Malty body, a little butterscotch flavor, and a decent spicy hop. I must say I enjoyed this beer. No flavor was over the top. Just what I would look for in a English pale."
"Drinkability is just average as the brew is slightly astringent, yet not offensive. Not bad for a buck, but there are much better."
"Brewed in Cincy. The color is reddish amber, head is average in size with moderate retention. Aroma is a combination of maltiness, fruitiness and some butteriness. The taste is malty with noticible fruity and buttery elements. Tasty enough, but nothing spectacular. This is easy enough to get down and nicely priced. However, nothing here stands out to make this beer a great one."
"You ever touch an electric fence or been shocked by something? It's not the pain of electric heat--it's what it does to your pulse. That's what this beer is like. It's all very strange and uncomfortable but not in any traditional ways. It's a whole new kind of bad--the first beer that I've dumped out in a long, long time."
"Overall, this is a decent beer...just quite not what i expected. However, it's worth checking out on the basis of smell alone."
"This was a 12 oz. bottle left over from BJCP class, where I hated this beer. Seemed to suffer from mineral harshness. Must have been whatever we were tasting before, or a bottle in rough shape. Now, at proper cellar temperature, this is pretty decent. It's not favorite style and I wouldn't drive twenty miles for it, but I could put a couple of these back without complaint."
"Palate is a citrus sour with hints of diacetyl and gypsum in the background."
"Drinkabilty: Extreme bitterness by itself is not enough. Next."
"About the only this beer had going for it was it's look. The color was nice and dark armberish and it poured with a nice white head that stuck to my glass nicely. Other than that, the beer reeked of too much sweetness, no balance, and a really thick mouthfeel that made it hard to finnish the bottle. Not recommended at all."
"This is a clean dark amber ale. Has a big creamy beige head that leaves a nice lace. The aroma has a nice sweet malty character with a hint of caramel. There is a sweet molasses character at the start of the taste. The finish has a light hop spiciness that gains strength as the brew warms."
"This beer pours an amber color with a small head that dies off really quickly and doesn't leave any lacing on the glass. The aroma is metallic, but has a floral and apple smell. Not bad. Has a bready flavor with some slight fruitiness coming through. Mouthfeel is medium. Drinkability is just ok. Something about this beer doesn't sit right with me. It's not bad, just nothing special."
"poured a nice copper with a big light tan meduim sized head. aroma, caramels, malts, honey, molasses, raisins.flavor, honey, dark fruits, malts,nutty, molasses, has a slight dryness with a touch of bittterness. has a nice smooth mouthfeel. not a bad beer."
"Nice amber color, crystal clear, rich tan head. Aroma punctuated by a heavy ester note blended with floral hops and some malt - ester note seems like a cross between a little juicy fruit gum and perhaps lemons. Flavor is nicely balanced between sweet malt and hops, with neither dominating. Some tea-like notes come out at the end of the tasting. Maybe a touch of unpleasant astringency. The beer is nice overall, although I remember when I thought it was a real heavy hitter - that was before I got really immersed in micros though. Overall a nice beer."
"WTF, mate? There are definately hops here, but they're overpowered by a molassesey sweetness. This stuff is brewed in Cincinatti. The last porter I had was hoppier than this. I think I'll go drink some cough syrup now."
"Taste is fruity, like Granny Smith apples. Lightly spicy, clove , cinnamon and nutmeg. Metallic which is a bit unpleasant. A dry hoppiness in the finish. Nothing great but a tasty and decent session beer."
"It was darker than I was expecting. For some reason, I was expecting something much paler like a dark gold or something, but this is pretty dark mahogany with a slightly khaki head. The aroma is slight, mostly a bit of cherry fruitiness and caramel malt. The cherries and caramel carry into the flavor with the addition of egg custard spiced with nutmeg."
"12 oz. twist-off bottle. Pours a clear copper color with a light beige head. Bready malt aroma with a faint yeastiness and further caramel, sticky-sweet maltiness. Mineral watery background, light bready malt and not a lot of hops to speak of, other than some subdued floweriness. Quite dissapointing, to say the least. I've had this before, and I seem to recall at least a smidgin of character, but I'm not gettin' any love with this bottle. Quite synthetic tasting. A faint fruitiness is evident, but not helping any. Maybe all contract-brewed traditional English ales brewed in Cincinnati are this way."
"Dont bother!!!"
"Very mild and drinkable brew every sip brings you a hit of that wonderful fruitiness, better than Bass I think."
"Great session beer. I wish I could have tried the original version from England. I got a 6pack on sale at Trader Joe's. Might have to go clear them out. Could use some more hop aroma, flavor, and bitterness."
"Not a bad beer .an English Pale to be sure..but its not as good as the original."
"Not the best pale Ive had."
"Taste is primarily caramel malt, slight hints of nuts, a mild metallic note, and just a rumor of floral hops in the finish. Buttery aftertaste. A rough alcoholic aspect is present as well, which makes this unfavorable for sessioning...reminds me of cheap vodka, which is fairly unsettling for a just moderate ABV. Stylistically, a frankenstein brew...the illegitimate offspring of a nut brown ale and an oktoberfest."
"Poured a dark reddish amber with a light tan head. Pretty dark for a pale ale? Anyway, the smell of hops and malts filled my nose with a hint of a spicy yeast. The flavor was mild and pleasant. Nice finish and a pleasant suprise for me. I wish the finish would have last longer on the palate. I would purchase this beer again! A great sipper on a hot day!"
"Pours a deep reddish-copper colour with an absolutely exceptional smell. Very grainy and very sweet smelling. Very faint sweetness to the taste, but mostly bitter, but pleasantly so. There also seems to be a tiny bit of caramel present in the smell and taste, as well. A lack of carbonation makes this stuff real easy to drink. It's a wee bit heavy, but I still think one could drink quite a few of these with little or no problem. A great brew; will buy again."
"Looked good, but ultimately to light and acidic to hold my interest."
"Sampled 2/1/04"
"Overall, a run-of-the-mill pale ale that, while not bland per se, certainly isn't very lively. A mild-mannered, innocuous brew that could make for a decent gateway beer to give to a macro-drinker you're trying to convert."
"Overall, a slightly-above average British-style pale ale. None of the dominant hops I'd expect from an American ale; in fact, less than I'd expect from most British varities. This is an enjoyable beer that I can see ordering at a bar over the usual Euro lagers, but not something I'd otherwise buy again."
"Red-tinged brown color with a bulbous, rocky, creamy-white head: this is a very attractive head. The aroma is something of a disappointment.faint graininess with a musty, earthy character. Very faint hop aroma. Taste is grainy with an underpinning of toasted malt. Its moderately sweet with a creamy, soft texture and a moderately bitter hop finish. Low carbonation. Its what Id call very polite pale alemildly hopped, easy to drink, quiet, and very restrained. A little more hops and a more intense aroma would greatly help this brew."
"Although Whitbread Pale Ale is drinkable, it's a letdown in more ways than one. It doesn't seem like an English pale ale at all. More importantly, it isn't very good beer regardless of style."
"Appearance: Caramel amber hue with a creamy textured off white head lacing is thin but evenly disparsed. Aroma: Toasted caramel malts in nature very English malt presence solid throughout can't complain. Taste: English malt sweetness excellent with a mild bitterness and a biscuit malt finish. Mouthfeel: Slightly creamy texture easy going nice overall tone. Drinkability: Needs some more hop action nice English style pale but not enough hops going down decent overall."
"Drinakability is very high, good definitely get through a night of this in the pub. Like to taste this cask-conditioned."
"Solid, not spectacular beer."
"The beer pours a dark amber color with a thin white head. The aroma is great. It is sweet and creamy with the scent of crystal and pale malts; very malty. The taste is decent. It is malty and bitter, but really smooth and refreshing. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This beer drinks quite well. It has a unique taste, but I like it; a real sessions ale."
"Dry toast. Crackling biscuity, dries out to a light, crisp finish. Nutty. A bit lively. This strikes me as infinitely more drinkable than most American pale ales -- and this isn't even the ""true"" version of this beer. Very well balanced and supremely easy to drink."
"The feel is smooth and creamy with edge to the finish. Too unbalanced for great drinkability."
"Whitbread Pale pours a deep copper color, perhaps a shade darker than most pale ales, but quite attractive with a well-retaining off-white head. Nose is full of fruity esters and caramel and not much else. Where are the hops? Taste brings some of the anticipated hops, but only in a subdued fashion. The fruity, caramel malt is the dominant factor here. Mouthfeel is smooth and full for this medium-bodied brew. Fairly drinkable for fans of fruit and sweet malt, though a bit lacking on crispness and hoppiness to make this a truly quaffable ale. Certainly well-crafted, but not among my favorites for the style."
"A malt aroma was evident with only a faint presence of hops. For a pale ale, the flavor profile has a noticable malty caramel taste, but not cloying, and not overwhelmed by the hop bitterness. It had a very smooth, creamy mouthfeel taste. The beer finished with a slight dry taste, but it was generally well balanced and drinkable. It might be better characterized as a mild ale than pale ale."
"Poured a beautiful bronze color with a thick foamy head that lasted for the drink. Thick lacing also developed. Tha aroma is average, noticing only some sweetness. The taste was of malts and fruit with little noticable hops. Some bitterness was detected late after swallowing. This has a good body, and is slightly dry on the tongue. Very drinkable, but I wish there was some more hoppiness to this - it could be outstanding."
"Head is big, off-white, crusty. Color is dark red/brown. Lacing is thick. The smell is very fruity, but also a little sour with some veggies. Lots of nuts in the front complement the sweet malt toffee. Dark, dark malt in the middle with a nutty, fresh, long, long finish. This beer is quite malty. And quite nutty. It picks up some chocolate at temperature. But the sour undertones don't seem to fade. Strange. Decent beer, though."
"Medium brown color. Small head. Aroma is malty and fruity. A medium bodied English pale ale. Malts are fruity and way too sweet. Caramel, toffee and fruit (plums and cherries). Hops are mild and slightly citrusy. Way too sweet and overbalanced. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is dry. Aftertaste is very sweet."
"Overall, a solid pale ale, but nothing exciting."
"First off, I was disappointed that they have been Americanized and have a screw-off cap. The beer is a copper color. There is a small, fluffy light tan head that went away almost instantly. Some sweetmess to the nose. Honey? I get a bit of caramel to the taste. Very light bitterness in the aftertaste. OK, but I like my pale ales a bit hoppier."
"This looaks and tastes like a Bass clone. It has an amber color, and an uninspired, slightly bitter taste. However, it goes down pretty smoothly. Overall, its a mediocre import with only its relative rarity to set it apart from other beers of the same style. Drinkable, but not worth seeking out."
"Nicely carbonated and this beer goes down very smooth. Would be a good session beer as it is not ""too"" anything. A decent beer at a price a little cheaper than Bass. I would not buy this on a regular basis, but it would be good at a cook out or such as I think many people might like it."
"also similar. Malty, but the hop bitterness provided is in a bad way, IMO. Just a bitter finish..and not a good bitter. Its better than a lot of beers, but then its my favorite style, and it falls short of most other Pale Ales. Well short. I'll drink it again if given to me, but probably won't ever buy it again."
"Per label: ""Styrian Golding hops"""
"Looked really nice with a dark amber color and a thick head that was quite large. But this beer fell from there. Aroma had an unpleasant astringency to it. The taste was of a bland non descript sweetness. Slight hops were there but not even strong enough to provide any backbone in the beer. Finished with an astringency where it seems the yeast should have been. This still isn't a terrible beer but not that good either."
"Pours a nice deep copper color with a light but creamy head,the aroma was really sweet (almost to sweet) with some cider notes.The taste has some decent fruitiness but is lacking a nice balance for a pale ale.Average at best beer probably wont go outta my way to buy again."
"There is a significant difference between American Pale Ale and European Pale Ale. I think this one is half way in between."
"Pale orange in color. Medium sized head that doesn't linger. Light in body, not much malt or hoppiness in there. Unobtrusive in the extreme, but certainly a cut above the macros. A perfectly acceptable session beer when you want to give you taste buds the night off.."
"Poured out a clear amber orange color. The head was huge and creamy which gave off some strange aromas. Something like peanuts and sour yeast. The taste didn't fare that much better. The body was weak and the hops didn't seem to ever kick in. A bland and ordinary beer that didn't impress me."
"Pleasant carbonation and smoothness, soft sweet and slightly bready aftertaste. Not the best choice for a hot summer drink, but nice for relaxing with in the A/C or cooler outside temps. Disappears fast, at least mine did, but not sure how appealing it would be after 3 or 4."
"No sir, I didnt like it, I didnt like it at all. Poured a dark golden color topped off by a very thin white head that dissipated very quickly leaving no lace. The aroma had some hops intermixed with a hint of skunkiness. The taste was just as bad as the aroma, it had some hop bitterness, but mostly funky sweat socks. There was a bit of an astringent almost soapy aftertaste, I guess that was there to try to cleanse the taste buds of the sour taste of the beer. I will not drink this beer ever again and I do not recommend it to anyone."
"Poured a dark amber with a dense cream colored head. The head fades to a thin layer of foam rather quickly. Wonderful caramel, butterscotch aroma with a delicate spiceness. The taste also has a bit of a butterscotch note, with a hint of bitterness. A slightly sour aftertatse greets you rather quickly and lingers for a while at cooler temps, but is mitigated a good bit as the beer warms. There's a good bit of malt here, and decent bitterness, but I don't dig the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is good, but the drinkability suffers from that lingering aftertaste. Not a bad beer, but there are much better Ales."
"Color is a deep amber/copper kinda clear with a decent large off-white that was about two fingers high but faded quickly leaving some sheeting action in the lace. Smells faintly of sweet malt and has a twinge of floral hop. Taste is leveled out and mildly roasted malt caramel and toffee like with a nice balanced in herbal, clean hop bite and drying bitterness. The feel is full medium bodied with a good sense of bittering dryness thats smooth, clean, and slightly creamy/silky and is favorably easy to drink."
"Flavor is very malty, with different layers of malt to pick out as it coats your mouth. Somewhat unpleasant bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is somewhat smooth. Needs a serious kick in the chops with some hops."
"Not a bad beer, by any means. A decent pale ale in both color and aroma, it taps out a decent copper color, although it is a tad faint. The aroma is hoppy and quite good, actually. This one really surprised me. I was not expecting it to drink as well as it did. Well worth seeking out. Bottoms up!"
"Pours dark amber in color with a creamy light tan colored head that coats the glass in lace as it recedes. Nose is sweet malts and a good deal of fresh fruit. Medium in body with a fairly creamy mouthfeel. Taste is sweet toasted malts, caramel, and a bit of candied fruit. Some mildly spicy hops come through towards the end, but not enough to offset the initial sweetness. A nice brew, but Id love to try the original."
"Deep amber brown with profuse streams of carbonation and a huge pillowy head, retention is excellent, lace rings the glass quite nicely. Aroma of sweet caramel, molasses and some rather faint hops. Taste is dominated by the caramel malt, mild hops make their appearance only towards the end of the taste - and then are a second to the malt. Finish is a bit dry. Mouthfeel is pleasant, but not as good as expected. This beer seems quite bland for the style."
"Color is a caramely brown and clear, underneath a full, creamy, well-retained head. Aromatics are disappointing, lacking any hop associations I come to expect and look forward to in any ""pale ale"" wothy of the name. Soft, dry, slightly buttery. Smooth texture, sweet palate, light body, with a yeasty/bready taste. Lasting finish. It drank well, but brought absolutely nothing to the table, making little impression on me at all. I'm sure they succeeded in creating exactly the beer they wanted, but it's too lacking in hops to be of any use to any ale drinker!"
"It was a drinkable beer, but did not stand out in any particular way"
"Amber-copper hue; off-white head, smallish with pitiful retention, good lace. Fruitiness (banana mainly), some malt, and caramel construct the nose. A solid foundation of malt sets the tone for the palate, some hops for a nice bite, good carbonation then, unfortunately, buttery and caramel-apple-like. A tad sticky tacky mouthfeel. Alcohol is warming. Whitbread is a slightly below average English Pale Ale. I would not recommend it."
"Just slightly hazy dark brown color, dark for the style. Head is pretty much on the refuge side -- 1/8 of an inch for 20 seconds max. Malty aroma, some definite sweet caramel smells. Malt dominated flavors, sweet bread and candy apple, with the afore-mentioned caramel. A bit of cinnamony and flowery hops -- not much. Definitely on the malty side for a Pale Ale, with medium body. Could use a tad more balance but I would drink this one again, as a cool weather transition brew for the shoulder seasons."
"pours out a dark ruby color; slight fizzy head that died in ten seconds and no lace whatsoever. nice toffee, caramel malt, and a floral hop aroma is really inviting. smells great! tastes of the caramel malts and soft hops, with a misplaced hop bitterness that lingers on the tongue too long. mouthfeel is creamy at first, then a huge tongue tingling crispness asserts itself in the finish. strange mineral metallic flavors are perceived too. sort of schizoprhenic. out of balance too. something amiss here."
"Very pleasant if a bit confected."
"On the pour deep amber color with a decent head and nice lace to coat the glass, both pleasingly beige in color. The nose is malt and slightly fruit sweet, a pleasant aroma for the old schnozzle. Front is malt and sweet, the top skinny as a rail. Finish is moderately acidic, mildly hopped, and malt dry. As I vaguely recall, much better from the tap, but then most beers are, dont you think?"
"Pours a clear semi-dark amber with a 2 finger light tan head.  The smell of fresh baked bread with butter is present as well as alcohol in the background.  Strange medicinal taste like cough syrup along with a buttery flavor with alcohol on the tail.  Very lightly hopped, could stand more IMHO.  Has a light to medium bodied mouthfeel that is slightly sticky.  Too bad it doesn't taste even near as good as it smells.  Again I say ""Mo hops, please""!  The lack of just lends it to taste mighty flat.  Weird at best.  Looks great, smells good, tastes weird!  Cheers anyways!"
"Pours a clear orangish amber color with a small head that fades very quickly and leaves no lace.  Light biscuity malt aroma that is a bit too sweet smelling and far too weak.  Biscuity malt from beginning to end with some very boring and very subtle hoppiness in the middle that fades towards the finish as the brew turns vaguely fruity.  Thin and watery on the tongue but fairly drinkable due to its lack of character.  Not something that I will be buying again.  This was a big dissappointment.  I had this at a beer tasting at my local store and really liked it and this isn't at all how I remember it."
"Nothing earth-shattering going on here. Very nice amber color and medium head, but the flavor was a little on the bland side, there was very little hops to keep it interesting throughout."
"Nice, but could do with some more character. It barely has enough oomph to accompany and stand up to a mild creamy cheese such as Havarti. Drink by itself as a sociable beer, not with food."
"Clear. Russett in color with a reddish cast. The head is light tan, very creamy, holds quite well, and leaves a pretty solid lace down the glass. The aroma is quite bold with fruitiness, some caramel-malt, and rich earthy-mineral hops. The body is medium with a fine carbonation that gives a very nice creaminess in the mouth. The flavor mirrors the aroma with a light fruitiness above a rich & smooth medium-crystal maltiness and earthy hop flavor. There's a bit of oxidation as well. A balanced bitterness plays a supporting role to the maltiness. The finish is somewhat dry, but not really bitter, with a lingering maltiness. This ""contract"" brew lacks the character of the true Whitbread version, especially the fruitiness of their dual-strain yeast; and seems to have a bit of a flabby maltiness that's not present in the authentic version."
"This sample was brewed in Cinncinnati, OH.  It looked great, had a frothy, clingy head but a little too gassy for the style. The flavor reminded me of a rough, overattenuated homebrew I made--my first all grain mash brew. For a home brewed ale this would be acceptable. For a commercal product, it needs work (and the elite homebrewers would work on it if it was theirs).  Estery fruity flavor, lacking in mouthfeel. Rough, dry finish. Decently drinkable, but I'd rather drink a Sam Adams brew."
"Ditto on the PRICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Jeeesh!"
"Sharp bracing taste. Somwhat biting and yeasty.  Full flavored, but a little too complex for my personal preferance.  Better on draught than in a bottle."
"The sample I had was brewed in Cincinnati, they are not doing this brew any justice. Decent at best, not even close to the real stuff."
"Very dark in color in comparison to an american pale ale.  Deep malt nose with little detectable hops.  Deep amber color..  Taste is fruity/estery but lacks any real hop bitterness.  'Tis good but laks on the hop side of my brain."
"Deep amber sporting a quality lace. Raisin bread nose. Huge malt start ends mild hop complete with a fruity ester tang, a hint of currant in the mix. A complex English Pale which seems to want to lean towards an Old Ale in character. A unique beer worth a try."
"This ale was very full flavored, but perhaps too sweet for a pale ale.  The banana character got to me after a while.  Almost too rich, but good non the less"
"Good character...smooth...some ciderness on the nose, and on the finish which I don't care for...some chewiness..pretty good pale ale...better than most I've tried...take away that ciderness on the nose and finish and I would rate higher..very smooth and pretty tasty overall"
"True to form English pale. Now contract brewed in the US under supervision of Whitbread PLC, but still good."
