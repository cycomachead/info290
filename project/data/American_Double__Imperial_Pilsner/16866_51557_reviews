"On tap at The Bruery, poured into taster. Hazy yellow in appearance with thin white head that settles to a persistent film. Leaves some lacing. Aroma is hop-forward with citrus, floral, and pine. There is a little grain, too. Hops carry the day in taste, too, with a moderate bitterness that is less than expected based on the nose. A thin ribbon of sweet malts is perceptible in the background. Nothing shocking in the palate: medium body, crisp texture, average carbonation, dry bitter finish."

"Very light and crisp. More on the hoppy side"
"One of the first beers to help me identify the infamous ""cat piss"" note some hops apparently evince. Combined with a noteworthy sulfuric note (not uncommon in lagers, but amped up to an overbearing level here), I just couldn't get into this brew. I admit that the Double IPL has historically been a touchy style for me, but Humulus was one I just couldn't abide."

"An absolutely delicious hoppy concoction, a bit out of the typical wheelhouse of The Bruery it seems. This shows they can make a hoppy beer with the best of them."

"O: Very tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, decent kick, very good representation of style, this is a very solid beer to drink for a long time if you’re in the mood for the style."

"Well balanced and enjoyable beer that keeps the ABV well-hidden."

"Overall: Not what I was expecting. This had a buttery grainy taste to it that was not appealing. I usually like Bruery beers, but this did not come together for me. I will be passing on this."

"Definitely one of the better IPLs I've had.  The style is getting some nice attention , and what I've seen recently (i.e. this and Dissenter) have me wanting the next one."
"Pours a nice yellow beer. Smell is average. Taste is exactly like an IPA. Bitter, dry, light, refreshing and easy to drink. I don't know why they bother with the lager label. In any case, this is a great beer. The Bruery is got the funk."

"Had this one on draft at Bruery Pint night at Columbia Ale House. Outstanding beer, looked the part completely. Had the absolutely wonderful smell and the citrus taste that I love in IPAs without the bitter bang that can turn me off. Truly a great beer and one I hope to enjoy at some point in the future."

"O: Quite a twist on the traditional massively hopped double IPA and the lager qualities stand out. Hard not to compare this to Jack's Abby offerings and it just doesn't match up. While very delicious, it lacks consistency and has some rough edges."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Further proof that lagers can be quite flavorful. Bitter and oily like an IPA with the refreshing, dry crispness of a pilsner. A hoppy departure from The Bruery's standard fare and good stuff in a very different way than what I typically drink by them."

"Overall - The more I drink it, the less I like it. I guess it's good for a Pilsner, but that doesn't say a whole lot."
""
"Clean gold covered with a sticky pure-white head. Stinky, leafy citrus and fresh hop pellets in the nose. Grass and pineapple becoming more pungent and spicy towards the bottom of the glass. Fresh peppery citrus, spicy bitter pine, peach, and grapefruit hop flavors. A bit of trailing cracker-like malts, but the focus is squarely on the hop resins. Drying, fairly crisp, and extremely drinkable for a style that can sometimes be a little tedious."

"Bold and crisp golden body with a perfect head. Smell is piney and bright. Really sharp and biting bitterness with a really clean and crisp lager body. Reminds me off a bigger and more bitter Jack's Abby hoppy lager. Booze is hidden well behind grapefruit rind, light pine, and some mango."
""
""
""
"Hoponius of the West I suppose. Glad to be able to finally try this one. A brew I would gladly drink again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Rather sharp after some sipping. Really spicy hop flavors linger invitingly, wafted up by the hottish alcohol. Some deep fruity flavors that remind me of mango and apricots. A tasty brew that seems stronger than it really is. And a good example of another homegrown style that seems to have a reason to exist. My favorite Bruery product so far."

"D: Light, dry, crisp, and refreshingly hoppy this is a very drinkable lager and one I order whenever available. I will say this has been more on par with Sculpin or Pliny in my previous experiences. Found it to be a little less vibrant and a lot more floral here. I really want to score this higher. Perhaps next time will convince me."

"A super drinkable big lager, bending the boundaries between an ale and a lager."
""

""

"Overall- Very solid beer. It's a very good representation of the style the brewery is trying to make but not the one BA classifies it as. Even though I went to Beermongers with the intention of having this one beer (and only one), I almost had another."
"A bit of a restrained beer from The Bruery. It's in that hoppy lager vein and they did it well. Relatively easy to knock back a few glasses, but the ABV creeps up quick. Definitely a solid summer beer."

"Not sure if its because its not an ale, but this beer lacks complexity and the flavor begins to weigh heavily after while. Still a hoppy monster though and was glad to try it, but its perhaps a bit overrated."
""
""
""
""
"O: Really good beer. The hops dominate this beer, and it's really intense at times. Maybe a little too intense for my personal preference. However, if i were in the mood, I'd buy this beer fairly regularly if i could."

""
"Edit #2 - The batch that was out in April was better than the current batch available now."
"32oz growler. Pours a clear copper with 2 fingers of rich and frothy bright-white head. This soaps the sides of the glass with thick sticky lacing. The aroma smells fresh, floral piney and dank, with bright and zesty citrus flavors straight up the nose. Tropical character mixes with sweeter bready notes to give this a ripe flavorful twang in the nostrils. The taste matches the aroma, which a fresh, zesty and resinous bitterness that lights up the mouth with a bright feel. Herbal and tropical flavors spread out, mingling with the honeyed and bready sweetness from the malts. Man, this is just juicy feeling across the back before things finish dry and piney with a pithy bitterness that sticks. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a crisp and tight feel that is undercut by a creamy slickness that has this just moving effortlessly across the palate. Overall drinkability is impeccable for 7% ABV. With this tasting like a fantastic West Coast DIPA and drinking like a super smooth Pilsener, I can say with a certain degree of certainty that this might be one of the best beers I've ever had. It's that good. I have wanted to try this one for a while now and it more than delivered. This gets my highest recommendation."
""
"Medium body, decent carbonation, crisp and refreshing on the tongue. Despite the ABV, I could easily have 2-3 of these in a sitting. Refreshing, flavorful and probably the best Imperial Pilsner I've had the pleasure of quaffing."
""
""
""
""
"O-a delicious pilsener that has many IPA-like qualities, really enjoyed this beer"
""
"Lovely take on the quiet pils. A bit of a schizo of a beer, but very good nonetheless. Glad I got to try it."

"not only the best lager ive ever had (not even a close second), but possible the best beer ive ever put to my lips. this stuff is incredible. on tap at the monk on Colfax. the pour is glowing golden with an orange hue, mostly clear, and an inch of white thick whipped cream looking head that lasts, and is easily roused with a swirl of the globe. the nose is really hoppy, this was obviously dry hopped generously. the lager yeast gives it a crispness, and I smell some tropical fruit in there with all the bitterness. the flavor is just astounding, it has a very similar hop complexion to the pliny the younger, no kidding. its that decadent. the grains are light on the toast but give a lot of body, which I think works well with the lager yeast, a fuller bodied crisp clean beer with a ton of hops, its really a nice and new combo. so much fruit and hop oil here, ive really never had anything like it. the mouthfeel is also fantastic, lots of tiny bubbles and a full body make it feel like almost a nitro dispense, and the texture is so big and coats the whole mouth with this fresh hopped goodness. this is a beer that is worth every bit of its hype, it reopens the lager category as exciting for me, and it is another reason why the bruery is near the top of the brewing world right now. this is absolutely divine, and I cannot wait for my next one. A+"
"Overall I was impressed with this beer. Usually I feel that Bruery beers are overhyped and underwhelming, but I enjoyed the thought that was put into this beer's design. This is the type of beer where the total is definitely greater than the sum of the parts; the interaction between the lager yeast and the hops alone makes this beer worth trying."
"Pours a clear amber with gold hue and a layer of off white head. Smells of fresh green hops, citrus peel, and some sweet bready malt undertones. The taste is made up of citrus peel bitterness, green hops, and a sweetmalt and bitter hop finish. The body is medium with tingly carbonation and a finish that is not very dry."

"Hands down the best pilsner I've ever had. The ABVs are hidden very well and the beer drinks like a balanced, tropical ipa. Definitely worth the praise."
""
"o-really great beer, refreshing citrus hops, blends the line between pilsener and ale"
"O- An excellent beer, has a really wonderful hop character and is highly-drinkable, one of the better hoppy beers, lager or otherwise, I've had in a while."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall. This is one fantastic hoppy beer. Seems like a mix of noble and west coast style citrusy hops in a great combination."
"Served in a mason-pint, bright straw golden body, some nice white lace. Very hop forward - clean and bright citrus, fresh and green with limited bitterness. Definitely at the very far-end of the pilsner spectrum - very americanized. Great beer - tick, tick."
"The feel is dry at the end but very juicy up front. Altogether an extremely good beer."
""
""
""
"O- This was a great hoppy lager/pilsener with a very nice tropical fruit presence however I'm not sure if it's necessarily better then some of the other hoppy lagers I've had such as Kiwi Rising and HF's Mary. Overall though I thought this was great, I'm glad I had the chance to try it, and I hope The Bruery does more hoppy beers and sends this to Boston again in the future."

"Tap at PP Old Town. Pours a chill haze light orange. Sheety white lacing. Nose is hoppy, citrusy, pithy melon, sweat. Taste is dry, very nutty, meaty, lots of paper on the finish. Moving to extremely soapy. Hard to finish. My rating: 3.2 Fiancé rating: 3.6"

"Overall: Amazing beer. I could drink a pile of it. Perfect for the hot day that it was."
"Verdict: Carbonation aside, this is a knockout. Great hop profile, easy to drink, refreshing, spot on. The Bruery isn't known for their hoppy beers, but this leads me to believe they have the potential to make a really fine APA or IPA."
"Overall: very good, light, initial attack almost too hoppy. but, I wanted more."

"o - Overall I thought this was a fantastic beer; I haven't had a ton of Imperial Pilsners but this is definitely the best I've had. The nose reminds me of a fresh IPA as it has a ton of citrus hops and tropical fruits; I loved it. The taste was great too, though it dropped a tiny bit. Very easy to drink; could definitely take down half a growler of this one. The firrst really hoppy beer I've had from the Bruery and I think it's awesome; they should make an IPA or bottle this or something."

"Cloudy golden color with a little head. Taste is hoppy and quite bitter akin to a west-coast IPA. Supremely drinkable with a potentially potent 7.2 IBA. Excellent beer, very quaffable, easily to get drunk to."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a slightly hazy golden yellow with an off-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grain, citrus zest, and some tropical fruit aromas. Taste is of grain, citrus fruit, citrus zest, and some subtle tropical fruit flavors on the finish. There is a mild bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good lager with some very nice aromas and flavors."
"O: A very good hoppy lager. Glad to see the Bruery with something approaching an IPA, but why don't they just brew this as an ale?"
""

"Had this on tap at the Bruery. Poured a pale light straw color with a 1"" pillow of bright white head. Big nose of citrus like hops and a very light biscuit like aroma. The taste was great. Fruit like hop presence with some piney flavors as well. Light bodied and carbonated well. A little dry on the finish. This is a good beer. I'm not much in to lagers, but this is an exception. Tasty stuff here. Heard a lot about this stuff. It didn't disappoint."

"O - probably one of the best lagers I've ever had. Great aroma, good taste, and an interesting beer. Definitely recommended."
"O: Unexpectedly great for a pilsner. I highly recommend this beer."
"Overall: very drinkable. Drinks like an IPA. More of an IPL. Nice beer."
"Pours a clear, bright golden color with a large, white head that hangs around for a bit. Scent is very hoppy for a beer that labels itself as a lager. Tons of citrus and pine. Taste is extremely piney... drinks a lot like an IPA (don't really have the palate to say what is an ale and what is a lager). There is a ton of fresh hop flavor...absolutely delicious. Nice and bitter! Mouthfeel is medium bodied and well carbonated. Drinkability is very high. Overall, this is my first encounter with this lager. Maybe after I have it a bunch of times, I will be able to distinguish why this is not a hoppy pale ale or an IPA. All I know is that it was yummy as shit."
"Taste, almost perfect, I think I like humulus session or xpa a little more, the yeast seems to just not be the same fit as an ale, but it could just be such a foreign concept to have a lager this well hopped. Have to have more to determine with greater certainty, either way, its still very good. Hides alcohol very well, a Bruery tradition. If you like the fruity yeast presence from lagers and are a hophead, this might be right up your alley."
"This poured a nice foamy head with a beautiful golden body. Tons of tamed but strong hops in the nose. The taste of this is about as good as a 'lager' can get. You get a nice malty lager background and the hops just come up so nicely in the front, showing off their might but never applying any painful force on your tastebuds. This beer is a work of art and an honor to drink."
"D - Very drinkable. This is without a doubt one of the best Pilsners I have ever had. The hop flavor is super strong and has a really nice profile from start to end."
"Lunch break over. Time to get back to work."
"T: Wowzers. Starts with a soft malt flavor that soon gives way to some piney and peppery hops. A bit of grapefruit as well. Really tasty and well balanced."
"O-one of the best lagers i have ever had, including all pilsners. this is just great. its something i want again...and again."
"O – I was blown away by this beer. Easily in the top 5 best beers of 2011 for me. I knew it was a ticker, but I generally dont really care for lager, and this one exceeded my expectations! Very well crafted. I think I will go grab another tomorrow for lunch before its all gone."
"Overall, this is an excellent Imperial Pilsner. I think it suffers a little bit in the drinkability department, and if they toned this down a notch or two, I'd probably score it an A+. But this is certainly no slouch of a beer..."
"On tap at burger. in Santa Cruz. Pours a brassy orange with a thick white froth. Smells like lawn trimmings, but in a good way. Lots of grass, pine needles, and unripe grapefruit. Flavor is based on crackery malts with a big grassy hop explosion. Light bitter grapefruit in the finish. Dry and very herbal but avoids astringency. A tiny bit of malt sweetness comes through at the end. Palate is light, refreshing and dry. A great lager, very satisfying."
"O: If I am ever lucky to see this again, I will, without hesitation, order it."
"Light bodied with excellent soft carbonation to keep this refreshing despite the higher abv. Dangerously easy to drink as the bitterness is not overbearing, while still being capable of delivering exceptional flavor."
"O - An excellent beer that exceeded my expectations! It's not an IPA, not a Pils, but something in between. Whatever they did, it's done right. Can't wait to try it fresh at the brewery in the near future."
"Overall the beer has a lot of potential it just feels really rough around the edges to me"
"Huge thanks to Sean for this impossible to get DONG... bright murky gold, light tan head, looks good for a growler... smells great, tons of tropical fruits, grapefruit and pineapple, the finish is a touch of alcohol pines... the taste is mostly hops, loses most of the sweetness, more herbal than anything, with some lemon and pine, really easy to drink"
"O - I was excited to try this and I wasn't disappointed. Very hoppy, but not so much that it was overpowering. I could drink this all day."
"A little thin in the body department but not watery. This is a great crisp full flavored lager. It combines the clean taste of a lager, with the bitter full flavor of an IPA. I can get used to drinking this."
"So drinkable and delicious. This is the top IPL and rivals some nice IPAs/IIPAs on my wish list."
"As an aside, I had the opportunity to try Alpine's new imperial pilsner the last time I traveled to their pub, and while a good beer, it was not able to approach the seamless intensity of this beer. This beer smells and tastes like it was brewed by Alpine, such is the mastery over the hops demonstrated here."
"Perfection."
"Overall i simply cannot say enough about this beer and look forward to hopefully having it again sooner than later. Its such a smooth beer with one of the best fruity smells to come from a beer. I would actually put this up with hopslam as one of the best beers i have ever smelled. Nice job on the great beer Patrick!"
"Pours a clear vibrant orange with a fizzy white head. This beer I call Sculpin-light because of how similar it is in flavor to that. However it does have more of a lager ""bite"" to it, obviously, as it doesn't have that fruity backbone. Still lots of flavor from the hops though, very citrusy, orange is predominant. Mouthfeel is also on the fizzy side, being a lager. Just a weird overall tasting experience.... weird but good!"
"Amazing drinkability. This is very complex for the style, goes down too easy, and is just incredible. This is a beer that has something for everyone"
"Drink- I could pound this all day long. It has great well balanced flavors. Juicy, crisp, strong, soft. I have a crush on a beer. Damn, though those were just myths."
"I don't have a lot of experience with impy pils but this is a big, balanced, easily drinkable beer. Well made, big hops and malt. What else do you want?"
"O: Can I have another? This is a hoppy lager done right. good job Patrick."
"Pours pretty yellow/gold with a good amount of head/lacing. Smells pretty much like an IPA, hoppy and delicious. Taste is like a good IPA, bitter, hoppy, and still very refreshing. This is a very good tasting beer, i could drink this all night. Mouthfeel is about what you'd expect of an IPA, a little bitter, but nothing bad. If they're calling this a lager, it's the best lager i've ever had, and i would drink it non-stop."
"Beer is medium to light in body, even with this high level of hop aroma and flavor, its not harshly bitter and it finishes completely cleanly. This is seriously a beer that I would have to monitor myself drinking due to the level of alcohol and the complete ease of drinking this beer. There is nearly no room for improvement and this was a GROWLER. The perfect beer."
"D: Without question the best imperial pilsner I have ever had. Wow - my highest recommendation."
"Pine, citrus, the intense perfume of flowers; all the usual American hop suspects are there and I'll spare any further description of their character since we all know what American hops are all about. They're everywhere. Leaping from the glass to my nose, coating my palate, and lingering into a long, smoothly bitter finish. Malt doesn't even dare to rear it's head. It knows its place. Clean, dry, and bitter on the finish. This could just as easily be Chico as a lager strain. I don't give a damn what yeast they use it's still an IPA that's all about the massive hoppiness in my book. Get it anytime you have the opportunity."
"Tons of grassy, floral notes, just a great hoppy nose overall. Why is this listed as a double pilsner? There is really not much pils malt flavor here in the taste? I mean it's basically an IPA.... I couldn't have told you it was a lager if you asked me. The flavor is much of the same, crisp hoppiness, a little more citrus here complimenting the grassiness of the hops. I got some grapefruit throughout the finish. Firm bitterness throughout, but completely well executed without any astringency. I had no idea this was 7.2 while I was drinking it... an awesome beer. I hope the brewery continues to brew this I.P.L."
"This was a nice, big beer that didn't show it's strength. I was shocked when I looked up the ABV, but by then...it was too late. Like I mentioned, I didn't get as much lager characteristics as other reviewers, but that doesn't take anything away from how good this is."
"Picked this one up in growler/bomber form via Charleston Beer Exhange's ""Rare Bomber Thursday""... Pours a bright, hazy gold / orange with a white head that leaves sheets of lace on the glass. Smell is of tropical fruit hoppiness: pineapple, mango, peach - and some grassiness. Taste is more of the same - tropical / citrus hops with a touch of light grains - so delicious. Mouthfeel is light and crisp... cue the lager! Highly drinkable and awesome... wish I had more!"
"All and all, top three hoppy beers I've tried and the best of this small small category"
"Very, very good stuff - probably my favorite beer from The Bruery. I was glad to get to try this fresh at the brewery after it was a standout for me at last year's Bistro IPA Festival. It would be great to see them bottle this stuff in the future."
"D: This is one of my favorite hoppy beer. Every time I unconsciously say ""Wow."" Very tasty. Hope one day it'll be bottled."
"overall one of the best lagers ive ever had as i generally try to avoid the style...this one was very lively and showed great potential but needs some cleaning up..."
"Overall I thought I would like this beer but I had no idea I would be this big of a fan. A phenomenal showcase for hops, well worth a shot."
"D: Well, this beer humbled me. Seriously. So absolutely delicious. I got the email from the Bruery last week saying that they were growlering Humulus Lager and I thought to myself, ""Oh well, another Bruery beer I won't get to try."" The very next day I got a bm from Derek saying there's a package on its' way to me that's meant to be consumed ""soon"". Imagine my surprise when I opened the box and saw a Bruery growler inside with a sticker on the top that said ""HL"". Thank you very much for your generosity Derek!"
"D - I enjoyed this beer very much and hoping they make more of it. Not a beer I would have too many glasses of in one sitting but I did enjoy it quite a bit."
"Poured a dark golden with a nice wheat head and a decent amount of lacing as it went down. The smell and taste were both fantastic. Loads of citrus hops, mostly orange; also, a bit of some tropical fruits. The taste went along very similar lines, with the addition of a nice bitterness that nicely balanced out the citrus and tropical flavors. The mouthfeel was a bit light and exceptionally drinkable. Very delicious--hopefully they bottle this."
"Light-medium body. Drinkability is very high. Pretty good overall, as I've come to expect from The Bruery."
"Draught at the Bistro IPA fest. Hazy blond with a lasting head. Resinous grapefruit peel aroma with some sweetness and flowers. Clean and dry with a bitter finish and low fruitiness. Medium bodied and smooth. Good stuff, but not a standout. The lager yeast is nice because it lets the hops come through very cleanly, though I think they could have finessed the bitterness a little more and given the aroma a little push."
"Overall, well...I stand corrected. The Bruery has produced something that has blown my mind. After this experience I will most definitely be seeking out some of their more limited offerings."
"Each time I try this beer (and this style, in general) I appreciate it more than the last. I really hope this is brewed again. Highly recommended."
"Overall everything I thought it would be and a bag of chips. This was sublime. One of the best beers I have had in the last year hands down and worth every effort to try and obtain. Wow.."
"Served in a 10 oz tulip glass. Cloudy, with a thick, yet bubbly white head. Golden in color and possessing a medium amount of carbonation. Aroma and initial taste of Cascade hops. My guess is that the only thing lager about this is the yeast. Think IPA or IIPA. Medium mouthfeel and bitter finish with a hint of fruit. A great IPA, not sure about how good a lager."
"Damn, but I wish this beer wasn't so rare. I could drink a lot of this beauty and can only wish that I someday get the chance."
"Finish is somewhat drying and astringent rather than lush, which is, again, different from what I see in the IPA family tree. Engrossingly drinkable, really good."
"This beer also exemplifies the difference between East Coast and West Coast hoppy beers. The hop character of this beer is just epic, without whelming my palate, making this an absolute pleasure to drink."
"I know it has ""lager"" in the name, but I was still surprised when I found out this wasn't an IPA. A damn good beer."
"Overall: Really impressed! Even if it's considered a lager...a top 10 or 15 hophead beer for me. Cheers!"
"toro sd draft. smells like wet juicy sweet hops, but when you drink it you get a dry hop whit kind of flavor. maybe the ultimate extreme west coast hoppy beer that is super dry. very unique and easy to drink. just was super complex. i've been away from hoppy brews lately. would LOVE to try this with several other comparable brews. i think it would stand out but for me it was fun to try and not sure i'd rush out for more. then again this was just 1 tulip one 1 afternoon."
"Draft at Toronado. Cloudy blond appearance, tons of hop haze on this one. Served with a finger of foam that retains well for a draft pour. The aroma is explosive and mind-blowing, loaded with pine, wildflowers, freshly cut grass, a touch of citrus and a bit of weed for good measure. Incredible. The taste, surprisingly, lives up to the aroma, with the slightest hint of malt supporting an enormous amount of dry hopping. Resiny, floral, fresh and crisp with a light body and the perfect amount of bitterness in the finish. Lager yeast is faintly noticeable but really, this is all about the hops. I really couldn't fault this beer in any area except for appearance, it's one of the most well-crafted lagers I've ever had and has a more complex hop character than 99% of the IPAs I've tried."
"D - Low bitterness, well-hidden ABV, great hoppy flavor - sounds like a winner to me. Glad I tried this one, even though I was initially not very interested."
"Hopheads will want to seek this beer out, and I hope Bruery can bottle it soon. This is an emerging style (not really Pilsner) and the Humulus Lager could very well be the benchmark."
"Serving type: on-tap"
"This stuff should be bottled immediately. It has the great hop profile of an IPA but has the smooth lager bill that makes it so drinkable."
"D - I'm really glad I happened across this unique and flavorful beer."
"I would drink this one again."
"The Bruery demonstates with this beer than not only can they make outstanding tasting beers with oddball adjuncts like basil and yams, but they can also jam those hops into a strong lager. Think Sculpin IPA and you're all set."
"really though, this is a great beer. I'd absolutely recommend it if you want something new."
"D: For as hoppy and apparently high in ABV as this is, you could certainly drink a lot of this (which is why I got my growler filled with it)."
"Edit 7/2/10 - Finally got to try the regular version. Nose is fragrant and is filled with pot and skunk (the animal, not the green bottle Euro lager smell), dank Summit hop heaven, loved it. Taste brings more pot, the Citra comes out and adds an interesting tangerine and lemon play. Really good flavours. Upping the smell score, everything else is staying the same as of now."
"-solid. if i had to make a list of pilsners to keep around, this would be one"
"Calling Humulus Lager an ""India Pale Lager"" is an accurate descriptor. Perhaps more accurate would to call this a hop focused, unbalanced, in your face hop bomb, but it's a lager! If this were ""just"" an IPA, a Belgian IPA, or an Imperial Pils I would probably be more critical, but the idea that this is a unique creation gives them the full benefit of the doubt when scoring this one. Another +1 for creativity at The Bruery."
