3.79,3,4.5,3.5,3.75,3.75,4,"Picked up at Grapes & Gourmet in Virginia Beach. 750ml corked and caged bottle served in a pilsener glass - no freshness dating. Pours a lovely honey-gold with a translucent clarity and a fluffy 2.5 inch, buttermilk colored head. Head eventually settles into a frothy, quarter inch cap with semi-concentric bands of textured lacing revealed during the tasting. Not much to the nose; just a suggestion of lemon, noble hops and a light grainy quality - very clean. Taste consistent with nose; however, malt character is much more assertive in the flavor profile - there's a pleasant sweetness without being overly assertive and finishes with a delicate fruity character. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a texture that's not quite oily, but not quite silky. Carbonation is easy and even, but I'd like to see it be a little more crisp. Overall, I haven't had too many Imperial Pils; however, I did enjoy this beer.","Jwale73","Sep 20, 2013"

4,8.7,4,4,4,4,4,"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, best before June 2014 on the cork. Pours lightly hazy golden amber color with a 2-3 finger dense white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big lemon, pear, apple, pepper, floral, bread, honey, cracker, grass, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with great balance of malt, hop, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon, pear, apple, pepper, floral, bread, cracker, honey, grass, and yeast earthiness. Light earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruits, pepper, floral, bread, honey, cracker, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and good complexity of earthy hops, malt, and fruity ester flavors; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly slick, smooth, and fairly crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Imperial pils! All around nice balance of hop, malt, and fruity ester flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jul 13, 2013"

4.3,16.8,4,4,4,5,5,"Very dry beer and also pretty clean for the size of the beer but not a super clean beer. Smooth creamy body from the bottle conditioning. Nice and full too, doesn't thin out anywhere. Grassy with faint citric fruits and peppery bitterness on the backend which is rounded out by the thick malt body. Balance is impeccable with layers of flavors. Grassy, citrusy, toasted graininess, rich hearty breads, all layered to create a wonderful balance. I like it.","jtierney89","Apr 22, 2013"

3.2,-13,4,3.25,3.25,2.75,3,"Overall: I think this was definitely a miss for Blue Mountain. I really enjoy most of their beers, but getting through a full bomber of this was a struggle. Maybe I haven't grown accustomed to the style, but it tastes like a super thick, super sweet BMC beer to me. I don't completely hate the brew, but definitely wouldn't buy again at the price point this is sold at!","Mattyb79","Mar 21, 2013"

3.61,-1.9,4,3,3.75,4,3.75,"Best by March 2013...no wonder it was marked down at Total wine.Poured into a 1/2 liter stein a slightly hazed orange tinged light to medium golden with a large blooming white head atop that settles oh so slowly leaving broken chunks behind in its wake.Graint and lightly toasted in the nosewith verly light leafy hops,pretty light in the aroma department.The flavors still seem pretty fresh with dryer malty tones and some toasted grain,a decent shot of herbal/leafy hops are there and the alcohol presence is not.A lighter double pilsner,it's not heavy and or sweet,I liked it but it won't knock your socks off.","oberon","Jan 23, 2013"

3.76,2.2,4,3,4,4,4,"This ain't just any pils: it's an uberPils! *insert exhale-y cheering facsimile* It pours a clear pale straw topped by over a finger of white foam. The nose is rather faint and bland, comprising only some light wheat and florals. The taste improves on the smell, with notes of cooked wheat, light biscuit, and a nicely (and somewhat surprisingly) subtle floral bitterness. The body is light, with a lightly moderate carbonation and a crsp, dry finish. Overall, a solid imperial pils...if only it had some kind of nose...","TMoney2591","Aug 02, 2009"
4.3,16.8,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"This is a double pils that doesn't forget what a pils should be...and then expands on all the right facets of the style. A fantastic beer, one I hope Blue Mountain will consider brewing year-round.","Metalmonk","Jul 05, 2009"

3.88,5.4,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Drinkability: I'd been looking forward to this one and wasn't disappointed. It's definitely not BMB's best brew, but it fits the time and place perfectly - a strong and flavorful beer that is still light enough on the palette and crisp enough in the mouth for a warm July afternoon in Nelson County, Virginia. The abv%, truth be told, isn't really that high for an American DI Pilsener, just enhancing its drinkability a little more. Another welcome (hopefully) seasonal to BMB's already impressive rotation, and one I'm looking forward to trying again as the summer presses on.","CrellMoset","0"
