Holy cow it was good. I have to say I've never seen a beer that looks like this. Pineapple yellow, and murky as f**k. Small white head that leaves decent lacing. Smells of strong, sweet and bitter hops. Wonderful citrusy pineapple favors with sharp evergreen aftertaste. Strong. Good. Will definitely seek this out again.","datalager","Saturday at 02:55 PM"

Pours hazy deep golden color with a 1-2 finger dense and rocky white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice dense soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of big lemon zest, orange peel, grapefruit, citrus rind, pine, herbal, floral, grass, cracker, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great complexity and balance of bright citrus/pine hops and light-moderate pale malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big grapefruit, lemon zest, orange peel, citrus rind, pine, herbal, floral, grass, cracker, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Good amount of pine/citrus rind bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, lemon/orange zest, citrus rind, pine, cracker, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and balance of bright citrus/pine hops and light-moderate pale malt flavors; with a great bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Very clean on lager flavors with zero yeast ester notes present. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and fairly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very excellent IPL style. All around great complexity and balance of bright citrus/pine hops and light-moderate pale malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 07, 2015"

The lager yeast/heavy hopping combo creates a shrill effect. Losing hold of the malt character isn't super surprising for the style, but without it here the shrillness is especially stark.

The flavor is lots of lemon bitter hops, a bit of pine, some fruits, and low sweetness from the malts. Finishes smooth but with a funky note left on the palate. High carbonation, light or medium body, super easy drinking, and slightly dry. Overall extremely solid and dangerously crushable.","BMMillsy","Sep 28, 2014"

There's some sediment at the bottom of the bottle, but a gentle-ish pour didn't disturb it and cloud things up. Big puffy white head. Lots of lacing. Big clumps on the walls of the glass. Excellent retention. Floral and citric hop aroma. Pale bready malt sweetness. Some peach, white grape, mango. It's all a bit mild, though, and really could be juicier. Surprisingly little lager yeastiness. Taste is similar. Some lemon, peach, grass, pine. Again, fairly mild. Moderate bitterness. Very clean. Some pale malt sweetness, doughy sugars. Little bit of solvent bitterness in the finish. Light and crisp, particularly for the abv. Pretty good beer.","popery","Jul 08, 2014"

Plenty of lacing. Aroma is big, pine, lemon pinesol, pithy citrus. What more can be said? The aroma blasts out of the glass and is the strongest aspect of this beer. Tastes good! Hoppy in the citrus and pine variety way with a slight grassy quality married with hidden sulfur. Clean malt profile, the hops lead the way. Somewhat one dimensional in taste and a slight let down. Medium bodied, medium carbonation, medium all the way around in the mouthfeel category. Clean, clean finish, slight bitter hop, but with the clean palate expected of a lagered beer. The finish is another strong aspect of this beer. It's good, period.","pmlondrigan","Apr 17, 2014"

The smell is dominated by the hops - a mix of citrus fruit notes - grapefruit rind, lemon, some lime, orange rind. There are also some hints of pine. Smells like a west coast IPA to me. Taste follows the smell though there is a strong, sweet, malty base to the beer that has strong honey-like qualities. I picked up on more lemon than I had expected though grapefruit rind dominated. A little pepper at the close, which I think comes from the lager yeast - finishes dry and pleasant. The mouthfeel is pretty big and smooth for the style though there is medium carbonation. As with everything else I've had from Jack's Abby I really quite enjoyed this.","jwchestnut","Mar 11, 2014"

Taste isn't as tropical as the smell. Very good though, a bit of pine and grass, and pleasant bitterness on the end. Bitter grapefruit rind. Not a lot of carbonation here. Very thin and drinkable. Second time having his brew. Thought I remembered there being more orange flavor. I wish I could get the flavor from the nose, it's a great aroma.","Mikeypnh","Jan 01, 2014"

Complex hop aroma (floral, lemon citrus, fruity, slightly spicy and earthy) with faint malt character, a bit powdery. Solid bitterness balanced by hops, alcohol, and mild malt sweetness. Spicy/lemon up front with lingering bitterness and alcohol warmth. Medium plus body with moderate carbonation, good texture.

Smell is of malt, citrus fruit, citrus zest, and some earthy hop aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus zest flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel.

As the head slowly settles into a half-inch cap, spots and strands of textured lacing are revealed. Nose expresses bitter-sweet citrus notes (perhaps tangerine and grapefruit), followed by an earthy/herbal rind quality. Taste consistent with nose; a perfect balance between sweet and bitter and a great interplay between the two characters. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a touch of oiliness to the texture and an even carbonation that leaves just the faintest hint of a burn at the back of the throat between quaffs. Overall, a fantastic anniversary beer. I am consistently blown away by what they guys do with lagers.","Jwale73","Sep 02, 2013"

4.45,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.25,5,4.5,"The beer pours a clear golden yellow, like clean, yet dehydrated piss. The beer pours with a beautiful head of bubbles that sits well over two fingers widths above the beer and is made of a menagerie of different sized, creamy bubbles. When the head leaves, the beer leaves a lacing of long strings of medium width tiny bubbles alongside the glass. In body the beer is beautifully clean and pure, with just a slight haze coming from the malt. This is a pretty looking beer. On the nose, this beer is a damp head rush of everything I love about American hops. Big and bristling pine moves into smooth and juicy mango and pineapple notes with light hints of grapefruit and a touch of tangerines. There is also a slight dank smell lurking below all the other smells, and a touch of caramelly malt. Though I haven’t had Heady Topper for about a half a year, this beer smells quite similar to Heady to me. As it sits in my glass the dankness grows and bristles onto the nose, but there is some beautifully juicy fruit notes right beside it. This beer smells great. On the tongue, this beer is fearlessly bitter with just a touch of sweet on the finish to remind us that there is, in fact, malt in this beer. Slight touches of salt and acidity can also be sensed on the fringes of the tongue, but really, this beer is all about the beautiful bitters. In flavor, the beer begins as a blend of pine and tropical fruit juice, and the bitters gracefully build from there, trouncing over my mouth in perfect formation. Light biscuit cracker coincides with a deep dank flavor in the middle of the palate, though neither works its way in front of the fruity bitters which continue to work through the fruity flavor profile of hops, finishing with a big, bitter, grapefruit shiver that lingers into dank pine notes in the aftertaste. In the mouth, the beer is on the light side of medium, with near perfect carbonation working to caress the tongue like a soft pillow, even as the beer’s bitters bludgeon it. The mouth is left terrifically dry and slightly sticky, and though the tongue wets slightly, the mouth is just left begging for another sip. This beer is a masterpiece of hops, and I am loving it. A richly complex smell and flavor that work to be both thirst quenching and inspiring. This is an awesome beer to slug during the summer, but be careful, as its 8% alcohol never quite shows in the flavor. Try this beer for sure, and Jack’s Abby please make this a regular!","Maxwell","Aug 01, 2013"

4.07,-4.5,3.5,4,4.25,4,4,"It's light gold with a solid sheet of whites and near brilliant clarity. Smells absurdly dank, marijuana, pine, weed, dankness, the dankness, my high school years, etc. Flavor is a little less hoppy, but dank nonetheless. Lots of resiny hops, some nice pilsner malts, and a bit of bitterness, but really, really hoppy flavor for the style. Medium on light with hi carb and a wet finish. This beer is seriously tasty, but appears not to give a fuck about a poorly defined styles guidelines. Cheers to Jack's Abbey.","harrymel","Jul 16, 2013"

A very well-executed hop bomb, 2nd Anniversary is more than just a beer with hops piled in. Clean, crisp, and focused: this took some skill. Bravo and congratulations to Jack’s Abby.","ryan1788a5","Jul 13, 2013"

4,-6.1,5,4.25,3.75,3.75,4,"Pours a crystal clear deep straw with a huge bubbly bone white head that takes forever to recede. Aromas of spicy onion and garlic with a bit of pine and dankness hiding a hint of bready sweet malt. The flavor is lightly bready but overpowered by resin pine and green onion. Smooth hop flavor with just a touch of bitterness. Medium body with a spirited level of carbonation and a slick resinous mouthfeel. Nice beer, I'm glad I found some of this.","johnnnniee","Jul 08, 2013"

Only reason I didn't give a five on mouthfeel was because it's perhaps a tad bit too sticky for my taste but it's really an exceptional brew. Go get it!","Hopdaemon39","Jul 06, 2013"

This beer is fresh and phenominal. The hops really shine through the lager body of their beers and i' m loving em more and more. This should become a year round beer. Fantastic aroma, taste, great body and dangerously drinkable. I already know i want another and i'm only a third of the way in. Gotta find more of these.","jageraholic","Jul 03, 2013"
4.02,-5.6,4.25,4,4,4,4,"A very pale golden color that's clear with lots of little bubbles racing to the top where a big fluffy white head sits and holds decently. The lacing is very solid. The aroma brings out a nice citrus with a spicy bread and fruity yeast. Pleasant hop goodness. The flavor comes out with a more prominent citrus-grass hop bite. The yeast and bread ideas remain obvious as well. Cereal grain with a very bitter grass and citrus theme that camps out dryly on your palate. This brew is crisp with a medium-light body and just an edge of some creaminess. Very nice.","Durge","Jul 03, 2013"

The ABCS struck a fine balance between the crispness of a lager and the hoppyness of an IPA. This was shockingly bitter to start, though I'm adjusting to it now.","Sheppard","Jun 22, 2013"
