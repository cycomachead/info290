"2.95/5: If it's just like sucking on a pine cone past its prime, how good will it be fresh?"
"Number 2 of the evening. Golden glow, fluffy white cap. The smell is Northern Michigan; I want to marry it. Taste is smooth and silky, a little bite of spruce/hop. Not something to drink a six of, but a nice slow sipper on a hot day"

"love the idea here, playing heavy spruce pine flavor and aroma with a very aggressive hopping. surprised by the color, has an almost brown hue to the pale beer, not yellow at all. big frothy head and a great aroma that smells like cutting down a christmas tree. fresh spruce, really springy and nice, maybe as much spruce as ive ever seen in a beer. the hops go with it so well, bitter and leafy and balancing well. malt is not normal pils malt to me here, its not crackery and thin, but instead a little richer, huge in body, and quite flavorful, even a touch of dry smoke it seems. the spruce is so intense when it comes on, so fresh, i love how flavorful this is, and the curious malt base seems to fit it very well. nice bog body, effervescent carbonation, and not a trace of booze on it at all. there is an almost menthol herbal intensity to it in the throat, eucalyptus or something, real strange, but not unappealing. woody and wintery, i absolutely love how different this is. top notch stuff from a brewery who had really yet to impress me. this is astoundingly delicious."

"This one is too heavy-handed to be taken all that seriously. I like the flavor of spruce, but it's overused here."
"Like drinking a Christmas tree!  Very tasty."
"Very strong pine taste, which i like.  Yards brewery makes a spruce amber which is also good but tame in comparison.  A good beer to share if your friends have an open mind and a broad palate."

"No mistaking the spruce tips here; very piney. My fourth beer from Shorts and all have been unique. So far so good."

"Keeping this short and sweet. Best beer I've ever tasted so far..."

"I really enjoy this beer, but I doubt I could have more than a bottle of it. That pine note is super intense. Regardless, pick this one up without a second thought, assuming you don't hate the smell or taste of pine."
"O - This is a really good offering from Short's. Well balanced with lots of great piney flavors."

"O- This stuff is great and traditionally Short's. I can really imagine sitting among the pine tree in Northern Michigan and knocking back a few of these."

"O: The only Short's beer to date I haven't enjoyed. The huge herbal spruce flavor just doesn't work for me, as only the tiniest amount of hop flavor attempts to balance it. Not my thing, unfortunately."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium-thick bodied, with a largely oily, resinous, and almost sticky mouth feel with medium carbonation. A harshly bitter finish that could wake up a corpse. Jesus, this stuff is pretty damn intense. It's a very polarizing brew, and now I can see why. I understand why some people may dig this stuff... Me? I thought it was alright, but nothing to rave about. Hard to drink in quantity."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: not as unique as other shorts beers. But executed just as well as any. Delicious bitter and sweet balance. Another shorts beer I was disappointed to miss in bottle only to find on tap."
""
""
""
"overall: Another cross-breed of a beer, Shorts never disappoints with their experimental creations. Reminds me a lot like Beard of Zeus from two months ago, but with a lot more pine presence and it's a little thicker/more syrupy. Glad I got my hands on a sixer, will be going to pick up some more while it's still available. This may be one of my all time favorite's from Shorts, right up there with Huma Lupa."

"Overall a very unique beer. It wants to be that beer that reminds me of walking and chewing on the forest spruce lined sap and soil covered earth. However, they seem to have added extra earthy spicy chewy hops on top of it which was not needed and brings it down. It is bitter and astringent, earthy soil flavored, and malts and yeast at least bring nice Belgian blond flavors, esters and hint of phenols even which accent the spruce nicely."
""
""
""
""
""
"This poured out as a slightly hazy yellow color, the head was white. The retention fades and doesn't leave much lacing. The smell of the beer is spruce, big time herbal spruce aromas... Very pungent. The taste is also very much full of spruce but it's also nicely balanced. The spruce is huge upfront then settles into a nice dry bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel is clean and crisp, very drinkable. Overall pretty damn impressive. It's got a ton of spruce flavors so if you're up for it give it a try. Very nice brew."
""
"pour is a pale yellow, hazed, with a thin bubbly white head. Nose is piney and different, fair amount of pine with light lemon and herbal hop, notes of pepper. Taste is heavy pine sol, some lemon and pepper, body is syrupy and disjointed, favors are off putting and harsh, harsh carbonation, overly piney and artificial chemical notes."
""
"Medium body, well carbonated, dry and lingering on the tongue. I've been a Short's fan for a while, but this might be one of my all-time favorites. This completely demolishes nearly every other beer in the genre, while completely nailing the described intention from the label - I want more of this immediately."
""
"O: An excellent and uniquely flavorful pilsner. I can really say I would drink this all the time if I lived in Michigan still."
"O - Pine all-over the place. Some lemony-soap in the finish."
""
""
"Pours with about a fingers worth of head and leaves a lacing after every sip. Smell is of pure spruce trees/needles. I also get a some hops on the smell. Very good smelling. Taste is very similar to the smell for me it is a little to over bearing on the spruce almost like I'm drinking a tree, but I totally appreciate what they are going for with this one. Mouthful is nice with a moderate about of carbonation and little hop bite on the end. Overall this is a solid beer from Short's and one I would welcome having again."
""
""
"O: Unique (again). Very refreshing drink. Perfect for summer."
""
""
"12 ounce bottle into pilsener glass, bottled 6/14/2012. Pours hazy golden straw color with a nice 1-2 finger fairly dense white head with very good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Good spotty lacing clings down the glass as you drink; with a fair amount of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of lemon, citrus peel, grapefruit, bread, herbal, floral, spruce, pine, grass, and earthiness. Very nice aromas that are extremely unique; and have great balance with a nice hop profile as well. Taste of big orange, pine, grapefruit, lemon, pepper, spruce, floral, earth, and big herbal spiciness. Nice amount of pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of orange, grapefruit, lemon, pine, spruce, floral, earth, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a while. Great bitterness and hop flavor balance with the malt profile; with good complexity. Medium carbonation and body; with a nice fairly creamy and slightly sticky mouthfeel. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very excellent and unique imperial pilsner. Great hop profile and balance; and extremely easy to drink. Highly enjoyable."

"What can I say but WOW. I loved this beer last year but thought, maybe it was just because of the circumstances of when I tried it. Well, this year i bought a six pack and needless to say had to go back and buy 12 more. This has to be one of the most unique beers I've ever had. The smell of spruce works SO well with the IPA and the flavor is just exceptional. This is a beer I hope to stockpile a bit more of, as last year it really lasted a long time and still tasted good."

"Mouthfeel is ver fresh- light bodied with medium carbonation and a little oiliness from the hops. Definitely a beer I would get again."
"O: This is a great example of what an imperial pilsner can be. I really enjoyed it and would get a growler of it if it were down at my shop."
""
"D - Very drinkable. The strong spruce flavor works really nicely alongside the strong hop flavors. Great hoppy pilsner."
""
""
"O - While I wasn't a huge fan of the Spruce Pilsner in bottles for 2011, I really enjoyed the Imperial version on draught. The flavors and spruce tips meshed a lot better and eliminated the harsh after-taste."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: After a few disappointments this is a beer that kind of brought me back to Shorts. If you dig bitter hops and like the smell/taste of pine I highly recommend this beer. Can't wait till next years batch for more. Tasty!"
"Hazy pale blonde colour, one finger of white head, good lace. Smell is of sprunce and pine, quite hoppy, citrus fruit in there, biscuity malt backbone, lots of hops in here though. Taste has a sprucey forest note, citrus following, fruity flavours, grapefruit and pine, good amount of maqlt in the finish, nice bitterness with a light alcohol aftertaste. Medium carbonation, medium body, resinious and oily, good feel. Solid stuff, flavourful stuff, very drinkable."

"Overall a very very interesting beer - I have never had anything like it. Hard to drink a whole pint, but enjoyable in small amounts."
" The Flavor is intriguing to me, it tastes as you might expect with some bitterness present from the hops with slight citrus edge, but mild in relation to the deep woody and almost tannic sharp acidic and earthy pine-like taste that comes forward in the peripheral and lasts into the finish with only a mild amount of pilsner malt light cracker elements. Overall I found this to live up to the name, it was woody but not so astringent that it was undrinkable. I found the feel to be not very pilsner-like, but that really isn't the point of this. The spruce is conveyed in the taste more than any other spiced or other flavored beer and still compliments the base beer very well."
"O: Just way too much spruce flavor for me."
"Short’s Brewing Company has a knack for blazing trails. Spruce Pilsner is definitely a unique, trailblazing beer. How is it? Good. Personally, the spruce aspect seems a tad old by the end of the bottle. But, it does work well with the pilsner malt and strong hop flavors. Definitely worth checking out if you have the opportunity."
"Overall: Way too bitter in the finish killing all the other flavors. Otherwise I thought this beer was quite nice and very interesting."
"For all their oddities, Jimmie Garant's had no Schlitz on hand. Regardless, I enthusiastically give two Schlitz for this amazing brew."
"O- Yet another interesting beer from Shorts. I don't think I'd buy this one again, but I'm glad that I did try it. I would be curious how it would mix with other beers though, to perhaps round it out a little bit. This may actually be what I consider one of Shorts stranger brews, and that's saying something. Buying a single rather than a 6pk is highly recommended."
"O: Interesting, and bonus points for the novelty, I guess. I had trouble finishing the bottle, though."
"Overall- the growler tastes alil different than the bottle. like i said it seems like the hops are coming through more there. really tasty!"
"Cheers!!"
"overall: very nice"
"Golden hue, glows in the glass. Whispy white head appears and fades to lace. Aromas are very piney. Good hop presence and the spruce wafts in and out. Flavor is very nice, very bitter and foresty. The spruce is nicely integrated, the massive hops carry it through and there is enough base malt to give a slight balance to it. Definitely hop forward but nicely done. Definitely the best spruce beer I've had."
"Wow. The bitterness runs rampant in this beer. The spruce adds a nice touch, but it needs some more balance."
"O: Another beer that presents what Short's does best. Lots of intense flavors without feeling too convoluted. Couldn't drink more than one or two a night, but could have no problem revisiting frequently. A little off the mark for a pilsner, but the basic pilsner premise is in there and creating one is an exact science. Short's just took a mad scientist approach. Enjoyable and recommended."
"O: Pretty interesting beer all around. It’s definitely got a clean, sharp bitterness going for it which sounds like what the brewer was intending. One of the better beers I’ve had from Short’s. Thanks again, Jay."
"The beer pours a nice golden color with a thin head of white bubbles. Pure spruce in the nose, with just a hint of hops and sweet malt. This has all the apperence of a beer, but almost none of the taste. Like eating spruce sap right from the tree. Way too much spruce for me. I drank half of my half of the bottle and topped off my glass with whatever pale ale I was drinking, and that was about as much spruce as I wanted in this beer. I was looking forward to trying this (as I do alot of Shorts beers), and was dissapointed (as I am with a lot of Shorts beers)."
"overall, this is another head scratcher. I appreciate the pushing of the envelope and the sheer novelty this brewery has been known to pump out, but repeating an experience with this brew has proven to be a chore. a single bottle may have left a better taste behind, but an entire sixer is a cumbersome load that lingers without a solid place in the rotation. buy one try one or buy six and trade five and let others get a taste."
"Definitely try this beer, if only for it's unusual nature, although you might be best advised to split that 6-pack among friends. That being said, it does what it's trying to do exquisitely well."
"O- This is another great experimental brew from Short's. The actual spruce tips work with the hops to really showcase what a pine profile can accomplish. That said, as the pine qualities build, this becomes a single serving sort of beer. I won't hesitate to crack open my second bottle at some point, but back-to-back would be a bit much for me. The pine does overwhelm or become a little long by the end of the bottle."
"Overall- From the aromas in the beginning right down to the last drop of deliciousness left in the glass, this is a very enjoyable beer and probably one of if not the best pilsner that I have had to date. Very enjoyable and a very well balanced and complex pilsner as well, great bitter flavours from the resin and pine needle, a nice mixed of hops and bready malts, and finishes with a somewhat sweet flavour of apricots and grapefruit. I was pleasantly surprised by this one as I had somewhat low expectations when I first picked it up at the liquor store, but am now wishing I had picked up more than just a review bottle. Would definitely pick this one up again and will be on the lookout my next trip down to Michigan."
"O. I love this beer. It's different enough, exciting enough to be exactly what a summer evening calls for. Piney and sweet, and just right."
"O - This is a very good offering from Short's. The strong bitterness may not be for everyone, but I really enjoyed it."
"Wackiest beer I've had from Short's. There are parts that are enjoyable to this beer but the taste is a little too much to enjoy more than a bottle. I recommend people to seek this out however because of the novelty/craziness of it. Obviously there are many people that enjoy it given the A- grade here on BA. I wouldn't turn down a pour/bottle of this but doubt I'll seek it out."
"Overall, this is a hophead or spruce lovers dream! Very memorable and unique enough that one is not quick to forget it. Overall, a very solid beer and very indicative of the style."
"Thank you, hurfer, for the opportunity. "
"Drink- This was very tasty little beer that was quite new and unique to me. I'm not normally a pilsner fan and even more a double or imperial. Shorts does some good stuff."
"O - I like this, and I look forward to trying it next year."
"Edit* Just had the 2012 release and I am bumping the aroma up to a 4, it's full of blue spruce and grapefruit. I really like it, this one of the beer that I always anticipate Short's release, it one good and intense beer. Update, I just tried the 2013 release and this one is almost a different, it's so much more balanced without the tons of bitterness I have got in years past. I like this one almost as much as the other years, it's much more drinkable, but it doesn't have that super intense spruce flavor like years past, it's good and it seems like the intestity was toned down to enhance the drinkability, I think the Pilsener base shows up much more in the years release, it's still a damn good beer that I always look forward too."
"pours a light golden yellow with a white head that has very good retention and lacing. The carbonation is good also. The nose has a strong pine and citrus scent to it. The taste starts out with some pine and citrus hops that stay in the taste. The mouthfeel is smooth, but on the dry side and overall it is a nice pilsner that reminds me of a strong IPA."
"Overall: Avery good solid beer with a huge pine aroma and flavor. I will definitely buy this beer again."
"This really is one of my favorite Short's seasonals. You really should try this if you find it in stock. It really is an experience to be had."
"Pours a golden yeloow color with a tight one finger soapy head which gives way to a little bit of lacing. The aroma is of big bold spruce, it is like sniffing a christmas tree, there are hints of lemon and citrus underneath, but the big star is the spruce. It is very inviting. The taste has a hint of lemon at first, but then big big spruce taste. Very piney and oily and very bitter. It is a very unquie taste but very enjoyable. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated. Overall it is a very solid beer, it has a bigger bolder yet smoother flavor than other spruces I have tried, overall just a very good beer, it left me wanting more."
"Golden Hue with a thick white head.The nose is full of hops. Some citrus, herbal, pine (spruce), slight sweetness buried somewhere beneath. The taste follows suit and the malt quietly attempts to add balance but lets face it- this one is hop forward and heavy on the spruce. This brew had a medium body and had medium carbonation. I liked this tasty treat but perhaps too much spruce for me to have more than one."
"This is a medium to light bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. The spruce brings out a lemon and oily bitterness which is very bold. Certainly not your typical pilsner, this brew was a little rough going down. Interesting take on the style and certainly something different that is worth a try."
"Beer is too dry, too high in alcohol, and too....much like a tree. I do get everything you'd expect from licking a tree including wood and spruce needles, it's just way too much for me. Congratulations, it's a tree, you've done it."
"Pours a slightly-hazed golden-orange color with a good white head with mild retention time and a slight collar on the way down. The nose is incredible with ginormous amounts of heavy spruce and pine. Really quite awesome. The taste follows down the same path. Not sure how else to describe this other than to say that the spruce character is nearly overwhelming and I absolutely love it. Bitter and resinous, the mouthfeel is killer. I could drink this until my mouth completely dried out. Delicious."
"Drinkability - Relatively so for the style. I love Short's because of their impressive way to make a beer that sounds like it would be bad, to be damn good. Cheers!"
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, I really liked it. I've had spruce beers before and wasn't impressed at all, this one however is different. I really liked how they mixed the spruce with a lot of citrusy hops. It was very drinkable and added some very cool flavors and a twist to a hoppy beer. Very nice beer overall and I have to say I'm surprised I liked it so much."
"D- I was expecting something else but was surprised by this beer. I was expecting a less drinkable beer but it was not. The flavor was not overwhelming and was good all around."
"D - This is another good beer from Shorts. However, with all the overpowering lemon and mint going on, this is not the most drinkable brew."
"Pours a surprisingly light golden color, with about a fingers worth of head. Smells like hops and spruce, with a little malt. Damn! I always forget when Short's does something, like say use spruce needles, they go all out! Tastes hoppy and christmasy, but in a good way! First thing I noticed was spruce, then a lot of high alpha hops, finished with a huge bitterness. Spruce in the aftertaste as well. Mouthfeel is good and drinkability, I'm not sure, I only have one but I could probably drink one more. Short's doesn't play around, when they set out to do something, they do it. Good job!"
"Poured a clear medium dark golden color, with a decent little white head. Aromas of pine needles, resiny hops and spearmint. On the palate this one was crisp and somewhat syrupy, medium bodied and challenging at times (overwhelming Christmas tree here), with mint, a pine forest and some sweet malt. Although this brewery has produced a few good beers, they almost seem to experiment for the sake of experiment."
"This really is like a hoppy, christmas tree. The scent and the taste is just like a Christmas tree, but alas, it works! Such a great combo and I had this a few months after release and still tasted fresh. Imagine the pine aspect of hops kicked in by 100%. Awesome beer."
"Drinkability is good. This scores points just for the uniqueness, light years better to me than the Alaskan Winter brew that also has spruce tips in it. With that being said, I don't think I would want to drink more than one of these per session. It's a bit of a palate destroyer. Well worth tracking down."
"D: I like, but I wouldn't buy it all the time. I'd definitely order a second pint. It's unique. It grew on me."
"Poured to a one inch head. Head was slightly offwhite in color. Beer itself was a light brownish yellow and cloudy. Had some lacing going on and left rings with every swallow. Head hung around for a little while. Smell was nothing but pine. A deep pine smell just like you broke a branch off a pine tree and took a wiff. Tasted very piney, I mean strong pine. No alcohol taste. Had a slight bitter aftertaste of pine. Also a little on the dry side. Felt good in the mouth. Carbonation was good also. I got this bottle from a friend. Ill be buying a sixer tomorrow. Just a note, the alcohol was evident after a few swallows. You got that warm alcohol feeling. Very nice."
"4/4/3.5/3.5/3.5"
"D- The taste really gets to me. I know this beer isn't meant to be guzzled in the first place, but this one was hard to finish. I'm glad I traded all my other bottles away as one is enough for me. This was a VERY intriguing beer, and I'd recommend it to someone who's willing to test their palate."
"Slightly cloudy pilsner with a medium white head and good lacing. Aroma is pine with a hint of citrus. Flavor is a pine explosion. The first bottle I had I honestly didn't like it. I'm now at the end of my six pack, and have come to appreciate it. Flavor is heavy pine dominant, with some citrus hop flavor and a touch of grain sweetness. The biggest drawback to this beer is drinkability. Just one is more than enough."
"Love this one...."
"Excellent beer. Unique, tasty, & punches my nostalgia button for the north woods I haven't seen in...two days. I need to go back. Thanks Short's."
"While I personally liked this, I could definitely see how some might not. I will say that the boldness of the profile does subside some as this warms up, leaving behind a lot of flavor but with less bitterness than when this first starts out. The crisp killer body on this ultimately really makes this though, keeping everything together and in check. This was my first experience with a spruce tip beer and I really dug it."
"Interesting, I respect the effort and creativity, but I will probably not drink the whole six pack myself but rather send them away as extras. Definitely worth trying because of its uniqueness, its just really not doing it for me."
"very drinkable."
"This was the star of the Short's lineup we tried at HopCat, the others being the 2009 Anniversary Wheatwine and the Black Licorice Lager (all three were good, though). I can't wait for this one to be bottled again, as I will be picking up several sixers."
"Beautiful nose of spruce tips. A nice little foam lacing with a cloudy yellow color. Flavor is a bit acetic for my taste, but drinkable by all means."
"Pours a slightly gold tinged pale yellow with a fluffy and bubbly head that leaves wonderfully sticky lacing. The aroma is quite pleasing with lots of pine and nice grapefruit citrus notes. The malt component of the flavor is quite grainy and a little toasty even. Taking a sip I am blown away by this beers complexity. Spruce is definitely the first thing I pick up, but there also is a good amount of citrusy and piney hops in there. The malt backbone is fairly sweet and both toasty and slightly buttery. It mingles well with the pine flavors and makes me a believer. I am also picking up some interesting green herbal notes, and some minty medicinal qualities. The mouthfeel is medium with a fairly dry finish that coats the tongue. The drinkability on this is insane for being 10%. I dig it, and while I couldn't see myself downing these one after another, I definitely wish I had another bottle right now."
"I have to admit I came to this one not very optimistic. Last spruce beer I had was god-awful and one of my only drain pours in a long line of beers. Short's really pulls this off by balancing the spruce with a heavy hand of hops. Could not do much of this but it tends to be very enjoyable. Would love to try the 10% version!"
"D- Amazingly high. I love this beer. I will seek out bottles of the old and the new batch. One of the best beers I've ever had. This is what American brewing is all about."
"When I looked this up on BA after I had had a few sips, I couldn't believe it was 10%. This thing could be anywhere from 4-8% but I didn't think it would be 10%. For that, I will give it a high mark."
"Overall this is a great brew, it masks its alcohol content and has a delicious hop and pine taste that really stands out. I couldn't drink a bunch of these in one sitting , not because of the ABV but rather just how strong and pronounced the flavor is. Really great and unique beer though."
"Overall, a unique and epic beer, that ranks with the best I've ever had."
"This beer does NOT taste like 10%. Not even close. Im not a huge fan of imperial pilsners (some things arent necessary. Its like souping up a pinto). But this one is nice and drinkable without being in the least bit cloying or (alcohol) hot. If someone told me this is 5.5% I wouldnt doubt them. I guess the spruce adds something to this beer that I normally dont get in any other imperial pilsner Ive ever had. Good stuff."
"This is certainly a pretty wild beer by Shorts, and it comes close to really working well. The reason it doesn't quite get there is not because it's over the top but because it slips down the slippery slope toward being medicinal. Beer and cough drops don't mix, and that flavor hurts the beer in my opinion. As I said before, it's better as it warms and if I have it again I will let it warm up before digging deeply into the glass. That's a curious approach with a pils but it helps cut the cough drop flavor. At the end of the day this is a nice effort by Shorts, but I can't call it a triumph."
"Delisiously quaffable at 10%, ouch!"
"D: I think this is more of a once in awhile experience for me. The spruce flavor is an inventive novelty, especially in a lager, but I don't think this would be a regular in my beer drinking lineup."
"D: What a cool beer and beer experience. I definitely recommend it if you can get it."
"Overall impression: Interesting, piney, hoppy pils. Very enjoyable, immsensely drinkable, and delivers as advertised. Thanks to malty for the chance to enjoy this delightful beer."
"Definitive proof that Short's Brewing knows what extreme beer is all about. No pussyfooting here, taste and learn because this one is the real thing. Without a doubt the combo of spruce and hops within a big lager works."
"D - I got more than I bargained for with this beer, as I didn't notice the ""imperial"" distinction until I got home. Still, it's a happy accident. As a proud Michigander, this is a nice regional ""re-twist"" on a west coast twist, I just wish it drank a little more like a pils."
"D - This is definitely a different pilsner. Right away you get the spruce and it is pleasant at first but almost becomes too much drinking the whole bottle for me, but certainly not a bad beer."
"D- A unique, intriguing, and sessionable take on the style. I dig it."
"Pours very clear yellow with a good amount of carbonation that forms about three-quarter-inch head that falls slowly leaving lace behind, but never really goes away. Really interesting combination of aromas: hops, toasted malts and of course spruce wood. Tastes woody and crisp, with lightly toasted malt and peppery hop notes. Surprisingly light-bodied. Dry, with a powerfully bitter hop finish and slight alcohol bite that eventually fades as a lingering hop bitterness coats the tongue. Overall, I would say this is perilously drinkable and quite tasty and bitter."
"I really liked this beer. I knew it was way more massive than any regular pilsner. Its more like a run away IIPA."
"The 12 ounce bottle released in 2010 is lighter with loads of sweet pine flavors and more drinkable than the original. Maybe just being fresher than the 3-year old 750 mL bottle I had previously makes the difference."
"D_Great summertime beer. Ridiculously drinkable for the abv. Very refreshing."
"D- I am enjoying the first couple, I think I may end there though"
"M/D: yea... it was alright, smooth, but just such a weird taste."
"Tastes just like it smells only stronger. Lots of bitterness, pine sap and more pine on top of that. This is a really unique beer but not something I would choose to have more than one or two in one sitting."
"Overall a sensory overload of a lager. I'd LOVE to pair this with some spicy Thai food and/or a zesty herb-laden pizza. Since I've got 5 more bottles, I'm definitely going to be on a food pairing quest to showcase all of this beer's qualities. Leave it to Short's to blow my mind (once again)!"
"The 10.00%abv brings a slight sweetness and a warming touch with it. This is the part of this beer that will keep it from perfection, as far as drinkability. Other than that, it is very easy to consume and very enjoyable."
"All in all, a real treat!"
"D: The pils is complex. That complexity, including the overpowering spruce flavor, makes finishing the bottle difficult. Pow!"
"D: Can't drink a ton of this one, but damn is it unique and tasty."
"Thanks to Deuane for bringing this back from MI for me. Shorts Brewing Company Limited Edition Release # 357 of 886. A capped 750ml bottle poured into my nonic Imperial pint glass. The lager appears a hazed golden amber color with a full two fingers of creamy off white head. Well, the aromas and flavors are certainly dominated by notes of resinous spruce sap and needles as well as pine, gin, caramel malt, grass, and grains. Moderately carbonated and nearly full bodied with a touch of alcohol as it warms. Overall, an intense dose of spruce. if you dig that flavor, enjoy the bottle alone. If not, this is a good one to share with friends."
"Bottle from the brewery. Tremendous aroma from the tips of the tree, I enjoyed this forest. Grapefruit body with white lasting head. Carbonation there and helps drinkability, which is easy. Taste is piney,juicy, a bit of citrus. Saaz hops? ABove average mouthfeel."
"D-Outstanding in it's flavour but this fact makes this one a bit tough to enjoy in mass quantities. I am glad I could share this bottle. I like the taste but it does become too much. Another brew from Short's that does not back away from the flavour line....but instead vaults on past it!"
"The taste is good, but overpowering. Tons of lilac and an overpowering malt sweetness that becomes overbearing after a few sips. Still very well executed as Short's captured the name perfectly. The hops are incredibly fresh, which makes this easier to throw down. Very creamy mouthfeel. Nicely done boys, keep crankin' out these off the wall beers!"
"Overall, this is an incredible beer. Like nothing else I have ever tried or imagined, but it is so off the wall, that this is a one-and-done for me."
"Shared very graciously by gford217 at the Brick Store Pub awhile ago. I'm fascinated by these Short's beers, and especially by this one. I happen to be a fan of that spruce flavor, and I strongly suspect that more than a few batches of spruce beers were made by the early settlers. If you like gin, you'll probably love this beer as its got that same strong piney aroma and taste- but sharper and sappier, that gin gets from juniper. Pours a hazy golden with a thin wispy head. Not too bad for a beer this strong that's been around for a while. Smells strongly of spruce and juniper, like a northern forest on a warm day, and with undercurrents of candi sugar. The taste once again spotlights the spruce with the sappy snap of pine ringing out against just enough malt to provide a nice framework for the spruce. You may or may not care for this, but for what it is I think it is perfect and very nicely balanced- this is clearly still beer, and not a spruce eau de vie. Smooth and piney, but not sticky or sappy or too bitter in the mouthfeel. Extremely interesting beer and well crafted from this most exciting brewery. Thanks a bunch, Grant. I'd been wanting to try this for a long time."
"Drinkability- This beer reminds me a lot of the Orbitz Mint Mango gum. My buddy was saying that the spruce is intense, which it is, but I don't think it's exceedingly over the top. This is an extremely unique beer that I really enjoyed. I probably couldn't drink this too often, but I did enjoy the hell out of it. Thanks Ed!"
"Well, being a lover of pine hops, I was really looking forward to this one and it absolutely delivered the goods. It's certainly intense and probably a little over-the-top, but since it's intensity is focused on something I enjoy so much, I've got no other option but to love this beer. Thank you Short's!"
"Poured a glimmering hazed gold. Sweet sticky alpha hop aroma, spruce, high quality caramel. Pretty wild that this still has so much aroma 2 years down the road. Sticky, resiny sweet with a building herbal spruce or spearmint flavor that culminates in a long bitter finish. Body is thick and robust for a Pilsner, there's a spicy tingle on the finish, that must be what chewing on spruce needles tastes like. Overall good in small doses, definitely a fine example of creative brewing."
"Overall this is easily the piniest beer that I've had, and it surprised me by not being too over the top. Definitely worth a shot."
"Overall would have been better served by being toned down a good bit, but it was just way overboard. Sometimes you don't need to go soo big with things,"
"Joe is a maniac. And it turns out that maniacs can make some tasty beer!"
"Overall: An interesting beer. It has more in common with a double IPA than a Pilsner, with spruce replacing any flavor hops. However, being a lager it lacks the fruitiness of an IPA, while at the same time the alcohol, hops and spruce overpower the bready malt nuances you get from a traditional Pilsner. Not a bad beer and worth trying, but I think this would've been better as a Double IPA (and I say that as somebody who generally prefers a nice Pilsner to an IPA)."
"Holy shit, this beer is intense! Soooo incredibly piney. PineSol & booze, with loads of resinous hops and juniper berries. It's all together too much for me, but I respect the ability of Shorts to craft something this monstrous. Mouthfeel is crisp, well-carbonated, and packs a lasting bitter finish of (you guessed it!) pine. I loved trying this beer, and it was perfect for a 3oz tasting, but there is absolutely no way I could make it through a full glass (let alone a bottle!) of this stuff. Potential drain-pour in large amounts."
"Big, majorous props to BA EriktheRed for hauling this gem all the way to Cooperstown for me, Thanks man!"
"D: Not overly easy to drink but very interesting."
"Notes from 2/8/08"
"Thanks, hoppymeal, for another opportunity to sample beer from this amazing brewery"
"A pillow like three fingers of rocky light tan head seems to last very well. A murky haze of wheat colored glowing orange makes up the body. A crown of scattered lace is left as the head slowly fades. Nose is like a pine forest just after the rain, with a bit of musk thrown in. Taste stays with this same tone with tons of up front musky pine, like liquid pine needles. When it comes down to it, it really tastes like a christmas tree. A bit of a bitter bite joins in on the back of the palate. A bit of sweetness arrives in the middle as it warms. The piney feel is just shy of harsh on the mouthfeel and throughout. Drinkability is well...short. I think the pine needles could have spent about half the time in the brewing process and you would have still got the desired effect."
"One of the beers I was looking most forward to trying from the imperial series and I was a bit let down, could not believe how fresh it smelled and tasted though, interesting experiment but I do not know if it necessarily works, this is a beer I would only need to try once, still worth trying as it is very unique"
"If you're a lover of all things evergreen, check out this sticky little pinesicle."
"Been sitting on this bottle since Feb. when I did a trade for several shorts beer with Hoppymeal(Thanks Derek), and wanted to open it ever since. Bottle number #202 of 886 poured into Pizza Port 6th Ann Real ale glass. Pours a golden hazy color with a very slight orange tint and a thick white foamy head, good lacing on the head. Smell is like the name, I got a huge whiff of pine mixed with some citrus and a little spice in the background inter mixing with a sweet malt profile. Taste is pine sap and lots of it but still layers of citrus and bitter sweet malt profile. Mouthfeel is light body with low carbonation. I wish I had another bottle of this beer, I love hops but now I love Spruce and hops together. This beer should be made year round."
"Drinkability: I liked this, but I am not certain other people would. This was poignantly flavored and made me feel like I was walking in a pine forest. Unique and worth a try among friends to share."
"Incredible. I really hope some other brewers get on the spruce tip bandwagon...perfect response to the hop shortage! And with that, I bump this one up to the 10 reviews it needs to be in the top 10 for style, and deservedly so!"
"Mouthfeel is nice and creamy with a medium body that makes for a really solid drinking experience. Good carbonation at work here as well. Overall, an incredibly unique brew that ended up being very tasty and unlike any other I have had. I shared this and I think a whole bottle might be much, but hey it's always better to share anyways! I wish I had another of these cause I keep thinking about it. Cheers to Short's!"
"This is one of the most unique beers I've ever had - period. IMO, Joe Short is pushing the envelope of extreme/experimental beers in a very meaningful direction."
"Cheers to hoppymeal for this treat!"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, sweet up front, & yeasty spice."
"Pours a faintly cloudy golden hay with a cumulus pillow of thick, rocky, light beige head. Exceptional lacing. Doughy biscuit and buttered roll malts hide behind a big wall of grapefruit and marmalade hops and an incredible fresh spruce needle/sap aroma. Wow. The name does not lie: this is a spruced beer! Conventional, herbal hop bitterness hits up front. Caramel and powdered sugar pastry malt mix with rummy fruits mid-palate. There's considerable sweetness coming from these malt flavors, but the citrus, minty, and mostly evergreen hop bitterness and the huge spruce needle/sap more than balance it out. The finish is so herbally bitter and spruce-y that I can hardly believe it. Phenomenal. Full-bodied with a syrupy feel (although the finish is drier). So intensely spruce-y and hoppy that it would be hard for even the most hophead of BAs to drink more than one bottle. But what an experience!"
"Bottle # 5 of 886. An imperial pilsner brewed with northern michigan blue spruce needles. Pours honey gold in color with a slight haze, a large fluffy white head builds and slowly recedes, lacing heavily as it does so. Aroma shows some very nice citrusy sweet hops, sweet tangerines, grapefruit and oranges. Then a pine needle aroma comes in strongly, like a fresh cut christmas tree, very strong and straight up piney. Wow, the taste is pure piney-ness. Like drinking a pine soda or syrup, but its beer. There is a nice sized malty sweetness that really helps to accentuate the pine flavor. A slight perfuminess follows the pine in the finish along with some bitter and dryness and of course a pine aftertaste that blends quite well with a warming alcohol. This beer reminds me of one of the anchor osa's that was large pine flavor, but then some. This beer is incredibly unique with a great flavor and mouthfeel, but you have to like pine flavor a lot to drink all of this, which I do and did. 750mls may be a bit much for some with the flavor and the sweetness so share this beer it is intense and very extraordinary."
