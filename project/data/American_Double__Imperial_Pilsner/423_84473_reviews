"Pours hazy straw under a fine 1” bone white head that slowly dissipates to a thick film that produces good lace. Spicy nose with light grains.  Bread and grainy malt lead the palate to a drying, crisp finish with a touch of tartness. Medium body and medium to medium high carbonation.  Full flavored but well balanced with a pleasant bitter hop accent on the finish."

"TASTE: Deep crispness, dried grass, bready, nutty, yeasty, peppery, balanced hop bitterness, goaty, vegtal, very malty, herbal, spicy hops, warming alcohol, very dry finish"
"Taste is nice raisiny breadiness, apples, grassy-fruit skin bitterness with hint of herb.  Zesty zingy bitter hop character dominates after up-front sweetness up front, but lots of sweetness and bitterness.  It's excellent with lingering sweet and bitter, bread and grassy herb."

"O: Tjis beer had the bready malt aromas and flavors as one would expect from the style but it seems like the high amounts of malts pushed this beyond the typical flavors that one would expect from the style, which normally is not sweet."

"Overall though, I'm not quite sure I get the point. A pils can be a wonderful beer expression, and an imperial one in my opinion should just accentuate the hops, the structure of the malt while maintaining that crispness. This has something of the crispness, but almost nothing of the flavour. Not poorly made, just boring."

"O: Good for the style but nothing to particularly write home about. I would drink this again if I was looking for something drinkable on a hot day but not something that I would go for in sessions. Overall, not something I'd crave but paired well with the applewood bacon BLT I had it with. Would pair well with lightly flavored pizzas, lemon/citrus grilled chicken or a good BLT as I had."

"I was surprised by this one... I wasn't sure what to expect going in, but I walked away happy I picked this one up. Aside from the warming bite of alcohol's presence, everything else highly enjoyable."

"The beer is a clear golden color with a fizzy white head that slowly recedes. Light spots of lacing stick to the glass initially. The aroma has a faint notion of malts before really getting into some lemongrass and black pepper, notably. The taste is like the aroma in that a real black pepper body takes over. Traces of banana, grains, and Saaz hops can be found. The mouthfeel is fairly light and dry. Overall, there's a bit too much pepper in this for me to really enjoy."

"Overall a tasty and mild beer. Super easy to drink and refreshing."

"750 ml bottle into lager glass, best before 2/2014. Pours lightly hazy golden straw color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big lemon zest, pear, apple, pepper, cracker, bread, light honey, floral, grass, herbal, and floral/yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with bright and balanced notes of hop, malt, and yeast esters; with great strength. Taste of lemon zest, pear, apple, pepper, cracker, bread, light honey, floral, grass, herbal, and floral/yeast earthiness. Light earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, light fruits, pepper, cracker, bread, light honey, floral, grass, and herbal on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance of bright hop, malt, and yeast ester flavors; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very crisp, smooth and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent imperial Pilsner style. All around great balance of crisp and bright hop, malt, and yeast flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"Interestingly spicy. The hops seems to be an appropriate choice for this stronger kind of brew. The slightly higher ABV makes for pleasant mouthful with all the malt and that hoppy tang. A very drinkable and flavorful brew that keeps the bitterness in the background, but it's still nicely balanced. From the 750 ml bottle bought at Olive Tree Market in San Diego for $9.75."
""
"This imp. pilsner is stronger and more yeasty than your everyday pilsner, but retains the malty base, Saaz hops and dry, crisp finish. Higher ABV is partially hidden."
"O: A solid American imperial pilsner. An easy drinker for the summer months that provides just enough kick. Lager fans should seek this one out"

"Very pale golden colored body looked very much like a typical Pilsner, but the carbonation was much more lively, and made it look like a club soda. The beer initially had little head, but the fizz formed it soon afterwards. The smell was clean and malt, with a hint of grass as well as lemon. The taste was much more intense than I expected, with a flavors of of honey, white pepper, banana, bubblegum, and a hint of lavender and blonde raisins. The beer was light in the mouth and had a peppery aftertaste. This was definitely quite interesting."

"Perhaps there was something wrong with the CO2 at the Boulevard booth (I got a foamy pour), but this tasted god-awful, somewhere between skunk and fecal matter. I'm a big fan of the Boulevard IPA, so maybe I'll give this another chance. But for now, the worst beer I've had in a looong time."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: not a bad offering, little note of the extra alcohol in the imperial. It seems like its struggling to have a nice hops finish and comes up slightly flat."
"Overall, I was very impressed with this beer. Was surprised to see some of the lower scores on this one. Will definitely get again."

"Seriously, I drink cause it makes me horney and this beer is it! Other then Delirium, Reverb is the one! Will report back after the coitus has taken place :)"

"Backward, it spells ""Brever"". Yeah. Mindblow. Anyway, this stuff pours a clear brass topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises mild biscuit, flowers, light grass, and wild rice. The taste brings in more of the same, along with a strong vein of straight plastic, as though I licked the cheap bag my groceries came in. This not only tastes bad on its own, but it also mixes strangely with the breadiness of the malt, leading to a rather off-putting flavor on my tongue. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, I've been searching for a really nice impy pils and thought Boulevard would be the brewery to deliver it. Alas, this was not the case. Instead, theirs stands as a fairly middling version at best (I've had some absolutely horrid ones in my day)."

"Overall- Pretty good pilsener. I am glad I tried this and would buy it again if the price is right."
""

""

"O: very good pils, I would have liked it more bready but still very good, light and true to style."
""
""
""

"Imperial pilsner s can vary, but I like this light and super drinkable boulevard . Wish I could remember how similar this might be to the collaboration 1..."

"Sweet toasted cracker flavor is pretty thin. Strong alcohol presence. Finish is a bright, boozey earth flavor. Toasty malt, yeasty dryness. Boozey warmth throughout. Not bad, but seems like a par beer for an awesome brewery. Glad I tried this brew though."
""
"OK...small head remains, aroma of wheat, grass, light lemon citrus and malt. Full flavors of lemon, grassy hops, roasted malts, some bitter notes from esters and hops. Overall rich, full bodied, lots of grassy hops, some citrus, some malts...decent but not something I would crave."
"This is a great pilsner that I will seek out next Summer as well. Another win for the Smokestack Series."

"B = 83"
"O: Good beer. Not great. I would have no idea that this Imp Pilsner is 7.7%. I'd drink it again, but I wouldn't seek it out."
""
"Sharp and dry finish, a bit boozy. Very nice"
""
""
"O: A pilsner with a lot more malt than normal; that’s it. It’s a pretty one-dimensional drink that manages to hit on all the fundamentals of the style, but just barely. For the price-per-ounce, it’s pretty good, but I doubt I’ll get it again."
""
""
""
"Good stuff. Clean flavors, solid noble hop profile, full pilsner malt backbone, with good carbonation. No alcohol presence with high drinkabilty makes this go down smooth and quick."
""
"O- This beer has a great full flavor of Pils malt with just a hint of sweetness to make it fresh and nice full rounded hops without becoming bitey and no sulfur harshness either."
""
""
"O - A nicely done Imperial Pils from Boulevard."
""
"A nicely done imperial pils that keeps the ABV under control while emphasizing excellent pilsner qualities. I see another reviewer called for this to become a regular four- or six-pack release from Boulevard. I second that suggestion..."
""
""
"Mouthfeel was superb, very soft but not quite imperial. It was a bit light."
""
"O - Wonderful. As a pilsner, it is ok. As an imperial pilsner, it is quite delicious and what I imagine it should be. I could easily get carried away with this as it hides its 7.7 ABV well."
""

""

"Pours a slightly hazy yellow with a foamy off-white head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and some grassy aromas. Taste is much the same with a mild hop bitterness with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is pretty tasty but somewhat basic."
""
""
"Overall very impressed with this one, lots of fun, and more Boulevard win too."
"O= This is a nice subtle beer that somehow works. A great grainy hay flavor and enough hop character to make it interesting. It works and it's tasty. Don't pay an arm and a leg but try this if you like pilsners."

"Overall: I generally do not like this style but like Boulevard so I figured I would give this a try. The problem I have with most versions of the style is that the way breweries imperialize pilsners is by adding massive amounts of hops or alcohol. When that happens, the grassiness and some of the refreshing qualities I like about regular pilsners get taken away. Boulevard is the first brewery I have tasted that still has a lot of the pilsner taste I like in their imperial version. The alcohol is upped, but I do not feel like I am choking on it. This is a very good beer and one I will get again. If I was not grading to style, it is probably closer to a 4, but it blows away every other example I have had in the style."
""
"a great beer overall, all of the alcohol is masked well by the great flavors. A very refreshing treat for any time of the year."
"I in general find Imperial Pilseners to be a style that's mostly unnecessary. This brew reinforced that opinion."
"An explosion of bubbles fills the Pilsner glass to the rim and continue unabated, keeping the huge white head in full effect. Color is pale yellow with golden hues. Smells of fresh squeezed lemon, grain and a hint of grass. Not much going on aroma wise. Flavorful light fruits and malt are quickly followed by a subdued hoppiness and an afterthought of caramel. A bit of spice lies underneath it all. Not as dry as expected, and actually has quite a creamy mouth-feel. The alcohol heat tickles the throat. Overall this one is quite balanced and drinkable. And while I'm not the biggest Imperial Pils fan, I'm thoroughly enjoying this one."
"This beer comes by way of cpolking, thanks. Poured from a brown 25.4 oz. bottle. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is a bit malty, some grains. Taste is the same, malts and grains, some alcohol is present, just a faint touch of hops, a bit mild. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a pretty good beer."
""
"The Reverb...as compared to other stack series is not amazing....however it is still a very smooth beer. The beer poured a bright clear yellow until some settlement interrupted the astetics. The head start nice and bubbly then dissappeared. The smell was grainy with hints of saaz. The taste started sweet then the nice malt/grain balance. The mouthfeel was medium body with smooth carbonation. Overall it was pretty darn good."
"O: Wish I had been able to try this a little fresher, but as is I think this is a solid beer, as is every other offering from the Smokestack Series. I like the simplicity of the single hop-single malt recipe. Very refreshing and worth trying."
"Overall, this isn't very pilsner-like, and with the muted hop and alcohol, not very imperial. But I would say it is a tasty beer."
"O:  I list for this beer. It's so balanced, fresh, and complex all at the same time. This 750 went quick. I want to grab more of this right now. Too bad it's too late. Oh well i can grab more in a few days and you can be sure I will. Stop what your doing and go get Reverb. "
"Light bodied with plenty of carbonation. Crisp, clean, and refreshing. A nice Imperial Pilsner. Worth trying if you have the chance, just like with other beers in the Smokestack Series."
""
"Brilliantly clear gold with a perfect dollop of pure white foam. Harmony between a soft, clean, elegant graininess and slightly aggressive Saaz. Honey, lemon zest, black pepper, and barley husk. Great balance, which seems to be difficult to achieve in this style. Great flavors, but what really makes it stand out is that the brewers managed to maintain that lean pilsner dryness. Four packs of this would be nice to see in the future"
""
""
"A ramped up/amped-up version of their Pils with some American influence. I like this, would love to see this out in 4 pack next year"
"Overall: Pilsners are not one of my favorite styles of beer and I rarely stop and buy them at bottle shops. I have to say that this would be best to have on a hot day sitting on the back porch barbequing and sharing with friends. I did enjoy this, especially when I got to the second half of the 750mL bottle. It was nice to have a hand-crafted pilsner for a change brewed with quality ingredients. This is definitely a giant step over all the other massively produced adjunct brews available out there. I’m a real big fan of Boulevard’s line of Smokestack series beers and I when I heard that they were going to make an imperial pilsner I realized that I haven’t had a craft brewed pilsner yet and I just had to purchase a bottle and give it a chance. This beer was well crafted and moderately well-balanced, and if you a fan of pilsners, I would recommend picking this up while it’s sticking around and still fresh."

"O: Glad to see this one hit the shelves again under a different name. I'd love to try this on draft sometime."

"I enjoyed this Imperial Pilsner quite a bit. Will definitely have again."
"Overall a drinkable, refreshing Pilsner. Well done Boulevard."

"this is the first smokestack series brew i havent loved to death. its good, it just sint as unique and standout as many of the others from this series. it pours an almost perfectly clear pale straw color, with a hint of that yellow 5 mountain dew color to it, but just a hint. a frothy two inch head rests on top. the smell is alcohol right from the get go. a grassy hop profile and some crystal and pale malts are also present in to nose. the malts seem pretty substantial here, not heavy and sweet or bready, but just providing a solid backbone for the brew. the flavor is the same. light in color but not in flavor, the malts are dominant. the alcohol wins though, which i think is a detractor overall. it just kind of trumps what would be very interesting flavors. the feel is good though, perfect carbonation for the beer, and a lighter than medium body. its drinkable, just not supremely delicious. overall a letdown from the smokestack standards, but dont let that dissuade you, its a well made beer with a nice punch."
""
""
"O- All of Boulevard's Seasonals are worth trying. The Smokestack Seasonals and their ""Heritage"" seasonals. Seek them out, you will not be disappointed."
"O - This is very good. Often Imperial Pilsners are too sweet or too boozy. This is not the case with Reverb. Good balance."
""
"Drink- I thought this would be a couple things. 1. A little crisper and cleaner and 2. I just thought would be overall better."
""
""
"Overall - This is certainly a brew worth trying. Solid taste, good for almost any occasion. Pretty expensive though, but a good beer nonetheless. I'm not a huge pilsner fan, but I love Boulevard brewery, so I knew I was going to try this."

"Overall, this is a very good imperial pilsner. It's tasty, refreshing, and nuanced. It shouldn't have replaced the world-class Two Jokers by any means, but Reverb is a beer that I'm glad exists."
