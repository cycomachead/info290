3.91,-9.7,4,3.5,4,3.75,4.25,"Overall, this was a nicely refreshing surprise.  We hadn’t previouisly known Jack’s Abby had come into the greater Rochester market, so we were floored to see a heavy hitter such as Kiwi Rising on tap at an admittedly smaller establishment well outside the city’s downtown!!  It stood out almost immediately on the menu, and we had to order it.  We felt the interplay between the pilsner, lagery side of the brew and the cloyingly fruity hoppiness made for an interesting and well-received tasting.  The ultimate balance wasn’t perfect, as both aroma and taste tended towards the sweeter side, but the feel helped to keep it even keeled.  To hop a lager, and something so traditionally bitter and muted as pilsners can be, was really the most exciting thing about it.  These hops were just wildly juicy and forward.  What a great chance introduction this was for us; we look forward to many more meetings in the hopefully near future.","TheBrewo","Feb 17, 2015"

Awesome fruit, resin and flowers followed by slight malt sweetness all in a very dry and refreshing brew.

4.24,-2.1,3.75,4,4.5,4,4.25,"T: Surprisingly sweet to start, very resiny. Passionfruit and mandarin presented on kaffir lime leaf platform. Very floral and fruity. Bready malts; heavier than expected. Overall, it's like a cross between a bock and EIPA. Could have used some more alpha notes; hop bitterness is nearly non-existent, and would have provided the needed balance; pine and light wood tingle.  Another slant would be that the bitterness has mellowed and taken on some cask like quality. It's unique, delicious, a must-have for anyone into hops from Down Under.","orcrist_cleaver","Dec 05, 2014"

4.25,-1.8,,,,,,"I have been waiting for this beer for quite some time and we were finally able to get some in the store. I was impressed with the earthiness and minerality in this double IPL 's hop profile. It has a wonderful citrus bouquet but not a specifically lemon, grapefruit or lime taste for me, more of just a general cirtus flavor. I would guess this may come from Kohatu variety but who can be sure.  Not sure if it lived up to the hype of "best beer jacks abby has made" but it is definitely up there. Worth the purchase at under 5 for a bottle.","NinjaJesus","Dec 05, 2014"

Grassy aroma, pine needles, distant biscuity malts, pretty stale overall. Major vegetal hop bitterness in the taste, the bitterness nearly blasting out all flavor and complexity in the brew; grass and pine-scented cleaner, ammonia, herbal tea. Body was light and watery, like lagery, but not fleshed out enough with malts to compensate for the overblown hop profile, and the higher almost soda-like carbonation wasn't helping either. "Messy" I guess is a good way to describe the beer. Between the people fawning over this when it was shared, and the high ratings it seems to get...I'm simply confused.","Rifugium","Jan 25, 2014"

Fruity aroma, orange and lemon, grassy and a bit tropical. Nice flavour. Hops are in full force, tropical (mango and pineapple) up front, a bit of citrus mid-palate, then bitterness and a hint of spicy alcohol in the finish.

Really though, this is a blend of citron, mangosteen and a little pineapple. Interestingly enough, the spiciness that I picked up on the nose isn't particularly noticeable, though this is definitely on the spicier side of IPLs I've had. The mid palate brings out some bitterness, with a blend of hand of Buddha-like brilliant, clarifying brightness and a very focused citrus resin bite. Very clean, this beer finishes with flavors of honey, simple syrup and a mild bitterness. Alcohol is very well hidden, there is no way I'd peg this at 8%. Malt character is nonexistent. This is one of the more memorable beers I've had this year. Outrageously good.","DefenCorps","Dec 08, 2013"

Some cattiness can be detected. Not such a bitter bomb on the palate, sweet grapefruit and other fruity flavors come on the front giving way to some bready malt and tropical fruit. Nice dry finish.

Copious tiny bubbles are present effervescing in-solution from the base of the glass to the underside of the head. Head eventually settles into a two-finger cap with delicate, textured bands to lacing revealed in the wake. Nose expresses grains, a hint of skunk and aromas akin to white wine. Taste consistent with nose; however, the kiwi definitely expresses itself in the flavor profile (more towards the tart side of the spectrum). There's a also a slight piney/floral hops presence and a kiss of ethanol bittering towards the back. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a pleasant, even carbonation and a slightly oily texture. Overall, a great beer, but not as good as I remember. Nonetheless, well worth your time if the opportunity presents.","Jwale73","Dec 01, 2013"

There is a bit of bright citrus and fruit on the first taste, but the bitterness overwhelms after that. The body is very clean and smooth to drink. Overall, I was taken aback by the level of bitterness on this beer. It's very clean and well-made, but the intense bitterness reminds me of some of the west coast IPAs that aren't my personal favorites.","PHBoiler","Nov 18, 2013"

This is my second favorite Jack Abby's beer and they make some wonderful hoppy beers! i am impressed again by Abby Jack's. But Hoponius Union is still my favorite. You can think of Kiwi Rising as bigger version of Hoponius Union. My favorite aspect of this beer is how unique the hop profile is... its true unique.","4DAloveofSTOUT","Jan 07, 2013"

4.2,-3,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Overall, this is most certainly a powerful double IPA, and you won’t find many more hop flavors crammed into a single bottle of beer. This does, of course, mean that many casual drinkers will find the beer utterly unpalatable. But hopheads should rejoice in what is an excellently crafted hop profile. Unfortunately, the sugars and breads aren’t quite capable of keeping up with the massive lupulin blast, making the beer seem off-balanced. Worth trying, but be aware of what you’re getting into.","jondeelee","Jan 03, 2013"

4,-7.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Big thanks goes out to MSquared2 for sharing this one during one of our random Sunday tastings! Served from bottle into Sweetwater 15th Anniversary snifter. Poured a hazy golden yellow with a half finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, fruit, citrus, citrus hop, tropical fruit, and pineapple. The flavor was of sweet malt, fruit, tropical fruit, tropical fruit hop, citrus, and pine hop. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. Another brew from this brewery and another hit. Everything on this one really worked in complete harmony and unison to make it very easy to drink and refreshing. The tropical fruit profile going on was nothing short of awesome on this one. So glad that I finally found out about this brewery . I hope you get the chance to do the same.","thagr81us","Dec 31, 2012"

4.32,-0.2,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"On the mouth, this beer feels crisp and smooth, with a nice bitter bite on the tongue and the sides of the mouth. The mouth is left wet on the sides while the roof of the mouth and the tongue have the slight scorch of a bitter burn. Overall this beer is an excellent success, and is reminiscent of a more succulent and fruity version of Hoponius Union. Great big bitter hops from the high IBU’s, scrape the mouth but leave it begging for more, and a higher alcohol percentage that is not present in the taste at all. I was a little worried about this beer after trying it at the end of a tasting last week and having it taste bland and uninteresting, but I now can safely say that was because of all the beer before it that I had tried. This beer is a winner. Very easy to put back with terrific clean and crisp lager qualities while carrying the big juicy fruit bitters of a west coast imperial IPA. This beer is a must try, especially for its super cheap pricing.","Maxwell","Nov 20, 2012"

Why...why make a beer this good, this surprising. If lagering an IPA turns it into this symphony then all breweries should play these notes. I would drink this over any nondark beet any day of the week. This is truey something magical get this while it lasts everyone because as Cinderella said: "You don't know what you've got till its gone."","rudzud","Nov 17, 2011"
