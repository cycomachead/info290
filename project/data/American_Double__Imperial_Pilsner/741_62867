3.84,-1.5,3.75,3.5,4,3.75,4,"Overall: A good, hoppy lager. One needs to keep in mind that this is a lager when drinking so it's going to have a different taste than wet-hopped pale ales also popular in fall/winter.","Beric","Dec 01, 2013"
3.63,-6.9,4,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.5,"O: An interesting take on a trad pilsner. I'm a fan of the style and of wet hop beers, but this one was kind of disapointing. Maybe an American style pilsner or an IPL with the wet hops would be more up my ally.","guityler83","Dec 01, 2013"

4.06,4.1,4.25,3.75,4.25,4,4,"O - This may be one of LFB's best beers. I really like the wet hops added to the Pilsener malts. I'm going to get another bottle of this since I enjoyed it so much.","Ri0","Oct 01, 2013"

3.98,2.1,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"I've never seen the normal Local Acre around here, but I saw the wet hop variation at Whole Foods yesterday and had to pick it up. Local Acre Wisconsin Wet Hop ours a hazy straw color with three fingers of head that drop down leaving some decent lacing. The aroma is a bit weak, but offers up nice grassy/floral hops over some pilsner malt. The taste brings those tastes to the forefront, over some relatively subtle pilsner malt for a double pils. The mouthfeel is light and slightly oily, and the drinkability is solid. Overall, a solid twist on the fresh hop beer.","shand","Nov 10, 2012"

3.97,1.8,3.5,4,4,4,4,"O - Not radically different from the normal version, but I like the normal version a lot. Just a well balanced beer, the floral and citrus notes in the nose get turned up here and I like it even more.","johnkale","Jun 26, 2012"
4.18,7.2,5,4.5,4,4,4,"O - Lakefront expands on the "normal" version of this beer, Local Acre, dumping in fresh Wisconsin wet hops to create, well, Wisconsin Wet Hop, a unique result. Some "green" characteristics of the fresh hops emerge but quality traits of the hops do well to elevate the beer into a dangerously drinkable pilsner. And you can go wrong with it's $5 price tag either!","BeerFMAndy","Beers"

4,2.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Golden-yellowish in color with a persistent two finger head and some medium levels of lacing on the glass. Smells very floral and grassy...'green' and tea-like in hop character is the best way I can think of to describe the aroma. Flavor has all of the elements described from the nose, but also including medium amounts of green peppercorns and a light citrus/pine garnish on top of the semi-dry pilsner malt. Alcohol content is hidden very well on this one. Medium thickness and plenty of crisp sparkling carbonation to keep things moving around. Very fresh and clean in feel. This one is certainly worth trying.","WastingFreetime","Apr 01, 2012"

3.55,-9,5,5,2.5,4.5,3," ~ I have to admit the flavor did wear on me a bit after a half pint or so. That being said, I'm still a bit unconvinced on the beer as a whole simply because of the flavor.","cdkrenz","Jan 02, 2012"
4.33,11,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"This lager pours brilliantly clear golden color with a moderate white head that leaves nice rings of lace all the way down the glass. A good looking Pils. The aroma is moderately malty, grainy and sweet, spicy and floral hops also are rather evident. Solid. The flavor is a 100% American version (ingredient-wise) of a German pilsner. Upfront bready, sweet, grainy malts that are quickly whisked away by moderate hop bitterness and spicy hop flavor that pleasantly lingers into the slightly dry finish. The body is medium and carbonation medium-high. Overall a really well designed and executed Pilsner. One of Lakefront's best offerings.","uwmgdman","Jan 01, 2012"

2.56,-34.4,3.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Overall the other qualities of the beer are consistent and pretty much average. Nice slight toasting to what at times tastes like Vienna malt. Anyways, can't call a beer wet hop if you can't even taste the hops, much less the wet, or fresh, etc. . .","Beerandraiderfan","Dec 05, 2011"
4.2,7.7,4,4,4.5,4,4,"O - This is a great imperial pilsner! It's easy drinking and brings just enough hops into the picture to keep things interesting. This is definitely one of the best beers I've had from Lakefront.","EnJeiBee","Dec 03, 2011"
3.62,-7.2,4,4.5,3,4,3.5,"Good exhibition of almost noble Wisconsin hops. The flavor could use some reworking to create a really great American Pilsner.","BerkeleyBeerMan","Nov 30, 2011"

3.99,2.3,3.5,4.5,4,3,4,"The beer is great; it reminds me of a higher hopped maibock (which, style-wise, i guess an imperial pilsner is just that). I would like to have seen it less sweet. It does finish dry due to the alcohol and is balanced well so "less sweet" is debatable. The hazy, unfiltered body kind of adds to the whole local, rustic mantra the beer embodies and brings some interesting nuances to the beer not found in other lagers. Definitely would like to grab this one again before it disappears off the shelf. Here's to Lakefront or any other Wisconsin lagering-great (i'm looking at you New Glarus and Capital) bringing us an over-hopped summer pilsner sometime soon.","knepper","Nov 07, 2011"
4.4,12.8,4,4,4.5,4,5,"O. This is a tasty creation from Lakefront. The alcohol is completely hidden to make for some extremely easy drinking. At 5 bucks a pop for a bomber, this is also a pretty good deal. Worth seeking out.","bound4er","Nov 05, 2011"
4.11,5.4,4,3,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall: One of my favorites from Lakefront. I think this beer is what would happen if somebody tried to make one of the beers Milwaukee is famous for using high quality ingredients instead of adjuncts.","AbsoluterZero","Mar 28, 2011"
4,2.6,4,4,4,4,4,"O: A clean and refreshing lager, with a somewhat deceptive 7% ABV. One of Lakefront's best.","bierbrauer","Jan 01, 2011"
3.48,-10.8,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"All in all, an enjoyable heer. Missing some crispness and a lighter body that would help make this a go-to lager option. Worth a try with plenty of herbal hop and crackery grain character to lend palette interest.","BrewerB","Dec 04, 2010"
4.33,11,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Interesting brew I have never had a wet hop or harvest ale that was this tasty","crossovert","Nov 14, 2010"
4.35,11.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Thanks to Downer Ave Wine and Spirits in Milwaukee for this one. Bomber pour in a tall pilsner glass. Gorgeous slightly cloudy with a deep golden hue. Very sticky head, thick and frothy that remained throughout the glass. Aromatic floral hops and bready malts are present in the nose. Taste: rich malts, beer bread and bright flowery hops. Very heavy and chewy on the mouth. The wet hops don't add that sharpness that I expected, but they do give this beer a fresh organic taste. Well balanced but a bit rich to receive high marks on drinkability. Overall a really tasty and very fresh imperial that I highly recommend.","JohnWaynes44","Oct 28, 2010"
3.93,0.8,4.5,4,4,4,3.5,"Aroma is perfumy with floral wet hops, somewhat green, with a little malt sweetness poking through also. The nose does strike me as somewhat "lager-y" once I found out it was one. Daffodil, white grapes, vegetal hop bitterness in the middle that lingers momentarily. Medium bodied, somewhat dry in the herbal finish. A little bit of orange peel comes out late. It's an interesting take on a wet-hopped beer. Could be a bit lighter bodied to increase drinkability, but overall solid.","emerge077","Beers"
4.16,6.7,5,4,4,4,4.5,"Another great beer from the Lakefront Brewery. This wet hop is 100% WI grown. This hazy golden lager had a fresh hop and citrus taste with great balance. The bottle was just as good as when Russ gave us a sample during fermentation. Like BeerFMAndy said, for $5 you can't go wrong with this one. Nice work Lakefront!","TheDTrain","0"
