3.95,-4.8,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Something about evil twins strong hoppy beer that is punishingly sweet. I hated the single hop Molotov, and while this isn't quite so diabetic, it's majorly sweet, especially for a wheat lager. Not sure why, but it is. It really takes away from the mosaic hops, which smell a whole lot more alive and awesome than they taste. Goes great with the wheat malt, which is robust in both flavor and texture. Grainy but sort, with. Ice bubbles, if this were drier it would feel amazing. Nice combination of flavors, and well balanced, but so sweet as to be distracting, and not just in the finish but all the way through. Hard to tell its a lager, not much yeast flavor here and no crispness because of the sugar. I had it on tap, but have heard bottles are much better for some reason. Still love evil twin, but this had way more potential. Add Brett and give it a year I bet it would be epic!","StonedTrippin","Sunday at 10:46 AM"

4.43,6.7,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a medium coppery amber with a two finger white head with good retention and lots of thick lacing. Aroma of bready malt, citrus, piney hops, lightly floral. Flavor is biscuit malt, lightly grainy, lemon and orange citrus, tropical fruit, piney hops with a light dankness, complex. Nice medium mouthfeel with light creaminess. The complicated name gave me cause and slight trepidation. Seriously, imperial india wheat lager, maybe too much going on? They really managed to pull this one off. Superficially tastes like an imperial IPA, but the richer flavor and body of a lagered beer is present as well as a nice, lighter wheat character. This is a quite complex beer, but all the parts fit together well. Lots of interesting fruit and pine resin hop flavors together with a satisfying malt body, perfectly balanced. Westbrook is doing great work for Evil Twin and this is no exception. Every so often, Evil Twin tries to hard to be different, but usually they seem to produce something great. This is an unexpectedly, very tasty lager. Kudos.","LiquidAmber","Jan 03, 2015"

4.26,2.7,5,4,4.5,4,4,"22 ounce bottle into lager glass; no bottle dating, but is a recent release. Pours lightly hazy bright golden color with a 1 finger dense and rocky off white head with incredible retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Incredible appearance. Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, mango, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, herbal, floral, grass, wheat, cracker, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great complexity of bright citrus/tropical/piney hops and light-moderate pale malt sweetness; with great strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, mango, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, herbal, floral, grass, wheat, cracker, and floral/grassy earthiness. Good amount of pine/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, mango, peach, lemon/orange peel, pine, wheat, cracker, and herbal/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Incredible complexity of bright citrus/tropical/piney hops and light-moderate pale malt balance; with a great crisp malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium body; with a very smooth, crisp, and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is and outstanding imperial pilsener style. All around awesome complexity of bright citrus/tropical/piney hops and light-moderate pale malt balance; and very smooth and crisp to drink for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","0"

Nice amount of wheat flavor with some tropical notes towards the end. Bready. Finishes with tangerines, wheat and honey. Super carbonated. Can't be in a hurry to drink this one.
