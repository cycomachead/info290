"I was expecting a darker beer, but it was definetly interesting.  It came out almost like a Japanese IPA.  Bitterness was there, but nothing compared to what's in the states.  Color is a dark amber, no hint of sweetness, good hoppy taste."

"1 pint bottle poured into a standard pint glass. Color is a somewhat unusual dark orange, cloudy and topped with a small but persistent amount of white head, around a quarter of an inch. Aroma is unique, full of Sorachi Ace notes (citrus rind, mostly lemon, pineapple, bubblegum, dill) and fruity yeast esters along with a moderate dose of butterscotch-like diacetyl. These fruity and herbal characters translate well on the palate. Quite sweet but with a strong underlying woody and herbal character as well. I am tempted to compare this to a Belgian brew with regards to yeast. There is ample pineapple, clove and coriander spice, citrus, strawberry and a little raspberry, and dried apple/pear flavor with the Sorachi hops (presumably) adding some subtle perfumed lychee fruit that I did not get on the nose. Malts are subdued in favor of the yeast and hops. Moderate to thick body, quite highly carbonated, smooth and drinkable but with a woody bite in the semi-dry finish. One simply cannot escape the Belgian yeast character, which manages to overshadow the malts and distinctive Sorachi hops, although the latter do add their own unique flourishes. Is this really made with lager yeast? If not, how is this beer an imperial pilsener? In any event, another offering from this brewery that offers some unique flavors and that defies any real attempts at categorization."
"O: other than marketing, I don't understand why you would feature an indigenous malt and hide its potential unique nuances with such distinct yeast characteristics and Sorachi Ace hops on top of that - this ends up tasting like the lot of their light-colored beers (not that that's a bad thing!)... drinking yet another one of these just convinces me that I have to trade for fresher West Coast bottles or visit this place"

"Overall, this is a very intersting beer. The wood/vanilla notes are unique and I love Sorachi Ace hops. A different, but well put together beer."
"An odd take on a pilsner – not clean and crisp but a more complicated flavor, probably from the Sorachi Ace hops. To me, this has more characteristics of a hefeweizen/weissbier than a pilsner. Not a bad beer, but not what I was expecting from a pilsner."
""
"o - a good pilsner (imperial) overall. I enjoyed the creaminess of it, while still being crisp. easy to drink."
""
"Beautiful golden orange amber color. Not much of a head. Has a nice fresh citrusy smell. Tastes pretty good. Combination of malty sweet with some tiny bit of bitterness. Very balanced between the citrus and the hop. Not a heavy beer but refreshing. Nice beer."
""
"Poured a cloudy golden body with a thin ring of foam, no real head to speak of, that reced to nothing, leaving no lacing. Not the best appearance, but decent enough. Scents of lemon, sweet spices, especially nutmeg and some slight cinnamon, pear, pale malt, yeasty bread, some floral aromas, and some grassy and hay-like aromas. Very complex for a pilsner, even an Imperial pilsner, with a lot going on, some of it very Belgian-like, other aromas very much true to pilsner form. The hops and yeast they use in this give it a very pleasant, complex aroma. Flavor begins with bitter lemon and other citrus rind that are sustained throughout, moves into some floral hops, spicy yeast flavors, some sweet pale malt and some hints of oak and vanilla in the middle of the sip. Finish is quite dry and spicy with a zesty, bitter and spicy aftertaste. Its a good flavor, very refreshing, bold, citrusy and spicy. Very different from other Imperial pilsners, with a lot of Belgian style spice and some unique citrus and flora hop flavors. Very well done. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation and a somewhat drying mouthfeel. Quite good, the drying feeling makes you want to sip more and the body and carbonation encourage sipping. Overall this is a very good Imperial pilsner. Its unique, using a distinctly Japanese hop variety to add some nice spicy, citrusy flavors that balance the sweet pale malt. Its aroma is also distinct and quite spicy like a Belgian, giving it complexity you don't usually suspect from any form of pilsner. Very good, highly recommended."
"Lighter bodied wih a bit more of a crisp, spicy hop bite than the aroma suggests.  Still subtle with earthy grass and bitter, dry pine needle.  There's a decent amount of dryness followed by a pilsner malt backbone with a touch of light fruit sweetness. Some bread/yeast in there as well along with biscuit and a subtle cracker-y malt character."

"Overall Impression: A nice example of an American Imperial Pilsner with some interesting hop character-- from Japan! The sorachi ace hop with its lemony, zesty, and floral characteristics evoke summer afternoons and a nice cold glass of lemonade. The biscuity malt brings it back down to earth and away from a completely lemonade like taste. I enjoyed this beer a lot!"

"This is a decent brew, but I am not sure I am also drinking this at its prime either. I'd have this again sometime."

"O: This is a very interesting beer with an interesting story behind it (how the owner brought back the historical barley from 16 seeds). Enjoyable but more of a sipping beer than an easy drinker. I think this is probably more of a Belgian Pale or Strong Pale Ale rather than a American Double/Imperial Pilsner but I have nothing definitive to have the style changed."
"O: This is a very interesting and enjoyable beer that has unique flavors from the malts and hops."

"O – You will pay a pretty penny to enjoy a Hitachino Nest brew especially in America, but you have to try all of these award winning brews at least once in your life time. This beer is very easy and light to drink. It reminds me of a Belgian dubbel because of the yeast tangy taste that you get after the spice bites and light carbonation. I can tell the brewer paid close attention to detail in designing and brewing this beer because though it is a Belgian style, he made it his own with a good balance in all the characteristics of the beer from appearance to even the feel of it in your mouth. I am satisfied with my purchase and would drink this again."
"Medium golden coloured with long lasting head. Sorashi can be a powerful hop less diluted, this one tastes rather orange than lemony. Kind of like a pomelo is to a grapefruit. Neutral aroma.Decent drinkability and complex, though what's actually in here is a secret."

"3.53/5.00"
"Great beer."
"O: I've been wanting to try this for a while, and it is quite good. Just wish it wasn't so pricey. Nevertheless these guys know what they're doing."
"Overall not the intense flavor I was hoping for but a smooth and delicious beer. Would get it again if the price was less."
"Had much higher hopes for this; especially given the cost. Poured at a good temperature, fairly aggressive with a small to medium size head that soon settled and some lace. Color is a clear amber with lots of bubble trails. Aroma is nice - malt, yeast, hop, funk, ginger, bread dough. Flavor's similar to nose, but not quite as an appealing mix that is fairly dry, astringent, hop and yeast bitter, some malt, carbonic tang. Body is there, but not very balanced and harsh with carbonation at the verge of being ambivelant. Finish is like flavor, astringency lasting a long time. Not a fav."
"This is really well made, and blows Brooklyn Sorachi Ace out of the water (which is the only thing I can compare it to). Something I would highly recommend."

"Another lovely beer from my favorite brewery. Really very lovely."
"Bottle. Sweet looking bottle. Pours a glowing sunburnt orange with a tall airy frothy white sticky head. Nice fresh dry hop aroma, sorachi ace all the way and it seems fairly noble like, light biscuit sweetness, lovely, dry, maybe light cedar. Flavor follows, very dry, all sorachi ace, medium bitterness, dry dry, little alcohol shows in the finish because of this I think, light fruit and lemon, lemon cookie, touch of white pepper. Light bodied, with larger slightly sharp carbonation, lightly milky. Very good beer."

"O: I really don't know how to categorize this beer. As mentioned in the ""taste"" category, it has some strong lemon attributes, reminds me of sunshine - especially since it is the dead of winter here. Unusual description, I know, but it's hard to put words to it. Nice unique brew."
""
"Really nice brew, and interestingly drinkable for a special-release beer. Indeed, I'd be perfectly happy to drink this regularly as a pleasant after-work beer."
"Tastes like Bass or Beck's. Reminitions of a highly carbonated belgian with a metallic scent and taste. Good to experience and add to a collection, considering it's scarcity, but not worth the price. The Foodery in Philadelphia, PA carried this. Collectors should buy it, and enthusiests should enjoy other Nest beer."
"pours a fairly clear dark gold with a white head that holds quite well and leaves tons of lace. nose brings a lot at once, but all things olfactory seem to be harmonizing here like they were meant to be. grains are definitely one of the highlights; kind of a spelt/buckwheat thing going on, on top of some woodsy flower notes and a honeyed hop(?) character. taste isn't nearly as grainy to me, and the floral seems to come out much more. soft, elegant, delicate taste on a soft, medium body. barely any alcohol detected, and minimal bitterness. first new beer i've seen from hitachino nest in a long time, and they've really showcased their world wonderfully."

"This beer pours a nice golden yellow color. It has a finger of white head resting on top. The head has good retention, and it leaves a lot of sticky lace behind on the glass. The nose starts off with some sweet bready maltiness and a big earthiness. There is a nice bit of lemon zest here, as well as a bit of a medicinal quality to it. The taste follows the now pretty well. It starts off with some bready malt sweetness and some earthiness. There is a nice mild hop presence, as well as some citrus and lemon zest. It has somewhat of a medicinal honey cough drop taste coming through. The finish is dry, and it leaves some lingering earthy citrus flavor on the palate. This has a medium body and medium to high carbonation. It goes down easy and there is a nice smooth quality to it. There is some earthy hop bitterness and some sweetness. There is some dryness on the back end as well. This has pretty good drinkability. It would really benefit a lot if it didn't have that cough drop quality to it. Other than that, It is a really nice beer, but it still isn't as good of an example of the style as it could have been. I would drink this beer again, but I don't think I would buy it."

"The hop usage is quite nice in a BPA. Refreshing and balanced."
"OK, I need to get out more. Saw this on the (50 taps) board at Frisco Grille in Columbia (MD) and had to try it. I'd seen the bottles in the stores and knew they were expensive, so thought I'd be able to try it out. Most expensive beer I ever bought... Served in a very heavy 10 oz (?) goblet. Color was deep yellow with an amber center and a nice 1/2 inch head. Very light (subtle) carbonation visible. I remember thinking flowers--like sakura--in the nose (probably because I knew it was Japanese and predisposed to smell cherry blossoms). But I also remember thinking it was quite unusual in its hints of floral in the initial taste and a subtle and welcome sweetness--like sweet rice bread--in the body. Many different (all pleasant) flavors that ended in an ever-so-subtle hint of bitterness. Coupled with the richer and somewhat ""smooth and creamy"" mouthfeel, I enjoyed it immensely. And for $10 a glass it's a good thing. Of course I didn't know how much it was at the time. But no regrets."
"O - Really liked this beer, though it is a bit steep for the price. That being said, I'd buy it again to support Japan's pushing of boundaries."
"This pours out as a really clear looking yellowish golden iPod with a fizzy white head on top. The head has a very light amount retention but it also has a light lacing too. The smell of the bet is a little grainy and fresh smelling. The taste has some element s of grains, light spices and rice. The mouthfeel of this beer is light and easy going. Overall it's better than I remember it being the first time I had it from a bottle. Worth a try I think."
"Its very hard to judge a beer on the qualities (above) because it doesn't look particularly good but its a very good tasting brew. Its my first Hitachino and so far I really like the individuality it has."
"O - A very pleasant drop without being powerful. Its balance is outstanding and leaves you wanting more."
"Nipponia is a very characterful Belgian-style ale that because of the hops remind me of Brooklyn's Sorachi Ace (the lemon pepper and lemongrass flavors are unmistakable). The lemony Japanese influence fits like a glove as do the peppery notes, sweet and bitter earthy wood notes, and overall sake-like lightness. This beer begs to be paired with many sushi dishes."
"I thought this was one tasty beer and that should be enough reason to drink it again... but at 10$ a 550ml I doubt I`ll be drinking a whole lot of it in the future with so many great beers I`ve never tried here in Alberta. I now want too explore the Sorachi Ace but can only thing of Brooklyn examples in Alberta, please correct me if I`m wrong."
"overall a phenominal beer with crazy unique characteristics. Bravo."
"O - a solid brew front to back, definitely represents both aspects of a strong Belgian with an English pale ale, well worth a purchase"
"O: A tasty beer, showcased the sorachi ace hop quite well."
"Pours with a one-finger white head that vanishes quickly leaving traces of lace. Hazy light amber color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Malty nose and flavor is malty, hints of honey, slight bitterness at finish. $12.95 for a 550ml bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"O - A tasty take on the style, and definitely worth picking up. Easy drinking flavours and very refreshing for a sunny afternoon."
"O: The most outstanding parts of this beer was its mysterious, slight, unusual flavors and the incredible light sessionability. Almost like a lager-replacer this is the sort of thing you can drink and savor or beer pong with if that's your thing. Dont freak out if you haven't had this and can't find it, but if you do find it I'd definitely say pick it up. Good stuff! Interesting!"
"An interesting and unique beer; check it out if you get the chance. [I'm not a huge fan of Hitachino's beers in general, but this is one of their good ones.]"
"This is a good beer, and I will get it again and again."
"D: Like all of Hitachino's spicy beers, it's an acquired taste."
"Nose is lemony and zesty, hints of Belgian esters, a little bit of tropical sweetness. More lemon in the flavor, along with a reall earthy character, bit of spicy peppercorn quality, perhaps a touch of loamy wood, light honey bread sweetness. Clean and refreshing while still nuanced and interesting. Would gladly drink again."
"O: Very decent Japanese craft beer, but somehow still reminds me of Asahi Super Dry."
"A whole lot of unfamiliar, but ultimately enjoyable, stuff going on in this brew. Trying the Brooklyn Sorachi Ace a while back prepared me somewhat, but wow, what a difference terroir makes. Calling this a Belgian Pale Ale seems like trying to force a square peg into a round hole - there are apparent similarities, sure, but after a while, you just want to create a whole new definition - thus, no points debit here for not adhering to style."
"Overall: A disappointment. I know some folks who love a good cough drop. Me, I can't stand'm. So a beer that reminds me of one from the initial sip isn't particularly a good one."
"Happy i was able to taste this obscure rarity. Pours a cloudy brown sunset orange with a fleeting half inch of head. Nose is sweeter bready malts, bright citrus especially tangerine. Taste is more of the same with maybe a touch of light caramel and mandarin showing up, along with some vinous notes. Tasty beer but far from though provoking for the price."
"Would love to get my hands on a fresh as possible bottle of this brew, love Sorachi hops and this does not disappoint."
"Nothing really offensive about it, yet not a very strong rendition of the style, no real character or depth of flavour to speak of. Perhaps an unintimidating stepping stone for those just getting into Belgians, but it still doesn't do the actual style any justice."
"This is a pleasant pale ale with complex flavoring. Definitely worth a try. Hard to find though."
"Notes: Interesting beer with the sorachi hops giving a good amount of the flavors (which is good since this is why I got this). Lemony with a slight funk. Slightly resembles a saison although not entirely like one. Good and interesting. Worth a try."
"D: Not quite classically a BPA, but definitely drinkable."
"It starts off with an acidic sourness and then blooms with floral hops into a very nice balance of flavor. This is a great beer. The carbonation was very high initially."
"Another good one from Kiuchi / Hitachino."
"Price = $10.50 at Witherspoon Wines"
"Not knowing what to expect, I was surprised with this beer. Unfortunately, at least for my review, the nose really kills the overall score. Of the beers I've had from the Asia region, this one ranks at the top of my list. Definitely worth trying if you have an opportunity. I'd definitely pick up a few more bottles of this in the future if I find it again."
"D - This is a very nice beer, Hitachino seems to do quite well interpreting old world beer styles and this one is no exception. The soriachi ace is a very nice hop for this style with a musty, pithy character that compliments the yeast, but some citrus zing to help it stand out from other examples of the style. I have never had a beer brewed with this variety of malt before, but it seems to provide a bready richness that acts as an effective background for the hops to play out their role. Well worth drinking, I would love to try this beer on draught."
"Nipponia (a Latinization of Nippon, which means Japan) is a tasty little Japanese pale ale that features one of that country's contributions to hops. A price tag of $9.99 is waaay too steep for a second go-round, but this certainly was an enjoyable 550 ml."
"This could really be made in any country. While I like the idea of an all Japanese beer it lacks any distinct character for me."
"Malty and lightly citrusy sweet. Orange juice and hay, grassy, weedy wildflower hop character. Lingering traces of orange juice and even hints of grape juice or pomegranate oddly enough. Malty backbone with a complexity from the yeast. Medium bodied and pleasant to drink, though this seems somewhat faded by time. It's interesting, the Sorachi Ace hops lend a nice citrus note, but I can't help but think it was better a few months ago..."
"All around, a solid, easily drinkable beer. Comes across as an IPA or American Pale, brewed with alternative hops and malt. Good subtle-but-not-boring beer. Could probably stand up to a wide variety of foods - lemon pepper fish, chicken seem too obvious. Worth a try."
"Definitely a different type of beer but well made as expected from the folks at Hitachino."
"Pours a typical straw yellow - not inspiring, but at least the white head is thick, frothy and persistent. Aroma is mainly yeasty with a fruity overtone and a malty undertone as well as some sweetness. Flavor is malty and fruity with a surprising hoppy tone and hints of both apple and grapefruit, as well as sweet, sour and bitter touches. Texture is smooth and a little thick, just subtly tingly. Give it a try!"
"This beer comes in a 550ml bottle brew pours a light golden honey hue with average carbonation that leaves behind a fast vanishing two finger head and some little lacing,the smell is barnyard funk,herbal hops and barley,it has a pretty average light mouthfeel which leaves you with tastes of orange zest,barley,yeasty bread and finishes with a nice,dry herbal hop hit of bitterness which leaves you thirsty and wanting another sip to whet the palette,overall i was really excited to try this brew as i do like this Japanese brewery alot but this is not one of their more memorable brews and for the price would rather revisit some of their other ones that where cheaper and i really did appreciate way more."
"Not a great BPA however."
"D: Pretty well done. I hope this and Brooklyn represent the beginning of more beers utilizing the Sorachi Ace hop."
"The beer pours very hazy, color is trapped between lemon and gold. A nice two finger creamy white cap rises, but it quickly disappears and lacing is practically nonexistent. The nose is intriguing, some Belgian pale malt fruity sweetness along with citrus and a hint of funk. After that nice setup Nipponia's flavor is a bit of a letdown. The sweetness has lost it's fruity character, there's no funk (but a bit of yeast spiciness), and the lemon is still present. There's also an unwelcome, somewhat rough hop bitterness that comes crashing through after the malts. While the nose was of a possibly interesting Belgian Pale, each sip tastes like an underattenuated and overhopped saison. The beer is surprisingly light (this is a good thing) for the amount of perceived sweetness, but carbonation is a bit much (although how over the top it is is hard to tell, Nipponia doesn't fit neatly into a style). I'm a fan of the Sorachi Ace hop (love me some Brooklyn Sorachi Ace), and it's used to good effect here, but unfortunately the beer surrounding it is a little poorly executed."
"Very nice beer... impressive."
