"O - A fairly decent pils with a good blend; wasn't sure what to expect from this, but turned out to be a good hopped pils that I wouldn't run tell everyone about, but would certainly drink again if presented"

"O - pretty decent flavors for a one hop double pilsner with a hefty abv to boot, but I'm just not that crazy over it; it doesn't taste a whole lot like a pilsner, which was what I expecting."

"I really like Sam Adams Noble Pils and the double version didn't disappoint.  Pours hazy orange with nice white lacing.  Sweet, somewhat sticky.  Green apples, peaches, and citrus emerge.  Finishes with a spicy note.  More similar to a double IPA than a stereotypical pilsner."

"O: Using current parlance, this is a good single-hop IPL or Imperial Pilsner."

"Well I will enjoy my other 3 with reviews lower than their other Imperial Pilsner this is a close clone but not as great as it could have been."

"Overall a very impressive sign of the what’s to come if I try the rest of the Adventures in Lager mixed case I bought from Sam Adams, drink up while it’s fresh!"
"Overall - I love my Sam, and this is a great offering from them. A great find that I wouldn't mind having around regularly. Pilsners tend to be a bit grassy and light for my liking, but this one is anything but."
"Golden copper.  Earthy hops in the nose.  More malty than hoppy.  Still, this offering possesses a nice bitterness and is fairly drinkable for an 8.6%"
