4.5,16.6,,,,,,"I really like Sam Adams Noble Pils and the double version didn't disappoint.  Pours hazy orange with nice white lacing.  Sweet, somewhat sticky.  Green apples, peaches, and citrus emerge.  Finishes with a spicy note.  More similar to a double IPA than a stereotypical pilsner.","McBeerin","Nov 02, 2014"

3.75,-2.8,,,,,,"Overall - I love my Sam, and this is a great offering from them. A great find that I wouldn't mind having around regularly. Pilsners tend to be a bit grassy and light for my liking, but this one is anything but.","dropkickguinness","Beers"
3.93,1.8,,,,,,"Golden copper.  Earthy hops in the nose.  More malty than hoppy.  Still, this offering possesses a nice bitterness and is fairly drinkable for an 8.6%","57md","0"
