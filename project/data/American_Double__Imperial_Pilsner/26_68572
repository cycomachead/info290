The taste brings in more of the same, amping up both the flowers and the stone, and adding a hint of orange rind and some very light pineapple in the back. The body is a hefty-ish light, with a moderate carbonation and a pretty damn crisp finish. Overall, a nice pils, though kinda weak, especially for its classification and strength.

Bready and biscuits, that moves into some lemon and florals, grass, some sweetness. Soapy, touches of more lemon, with a light rind. Medium bodied beer and decent carbonation throughout.

The nose carries a bit of light grain and a very slight touch of floral hops. A bit bready. The flavor is all too bready without a real ho component to back it up. It seems like it's a bit stale, which I would expect to be the case had I not just picked it up at the brewery. Body is far too thick with a strong bready component. Hops are tertiary; I'm not sure what's secondary. Adequate carbonation but I can't get past the excessive body and lack of bitterness or anything resembling crispness.

4,7,4,4,4,4,4,"I picked up two bottles of this at DLD right after grabbing my four bottles of DLD. I ended up opening both of them within the hour and sharing them with random BAs. It poured a thinner golden yellow in color with a sticky bright white head that laced my snifter. It smelled of sweet pale malts, bitter hops, honey, and lemons. I thought it was interesting. It tasted of sweet pale malts, light honey, and had a bitter lemony finish. It was well carbonated and drank well for the style. It was good, but I wouldn't say that it was My Antonia good. I meant to hold on to one of these for others to try but ended up opening my second bottle, only to talk football with a random BA for a half hour. Oh well, guess I'll have to go back to FFF.","aasher","May 01, 2011"

Wouldn't seek it out, unless I was a big pils fan. Jinx-Proof made a return; but even if this did I think 1 was enough.","3FaveryRogue","Beers"
