"Regal Pilsner pours brilliant gold with a  1” frothy, persistent white head that produces excellent lace. . There are no big no hop aromas on the nose to season the rich fresh baked bread aromas. Malty sweetness initiates the palate with a definite lemony citrus hop presence. Excellent lacing. It has medium to medium full body - not quite chewy – and has a smooth, creamy texture. Well balanced, drinkable and repeatable."

"Very yummy.  Heavy wheat flavor."

"Also, remember it's a lager. Regal lager... not just a good beer, but also a palindrome!"
"now i have passed this thing over in stores for years, but finally i grabbed a single and i think it was a great buy. its only 7% abv, which makes it drinkable and light for any type of imperial, but its still quite hoppy and bitter, and the german type pils malts are huge in the flavor, while its still dry and clean drinking. very well mad obviously, and while its by far not my favorite breck beer, i have to appreciate that a beer this simple is so good. its gorgeous in the glass with a big tall white head and a hoppy nose. vegetal there and fresh and green. its new and excited, and i like the virgin nature it hits the palate with. carbonation is at war with the flavors though, its almost too bubbly, and this is the only style it could ever work with, but work it does, and i appreciate a blue collar mouthfeel as much as anything else. its still a pilsener though, and i will never get off on one, but i like it for what it is and i am sorry i waited so long to indulge. its well worth the few bucks i paid for the single, and i may even drink this one again some day. breck has come a long way lately i think, and maybe i have been behind the times on some of the beers, but this is very good."

"Everything I dislike about the 'style'. Adjunct aroma and flavor, overly sweet, with an amplified lager character. Finish is overly bitter."

"Its malty-dry finish carries a modest warmth, but its the tale of those spicy hop bitternesses that carry the late palate into a crisp and refreshing closure. Shying away from the rougher alcohols or maltier weight, the dry finish still remembers its base lager flavor. Rather than imperial pilsner, I prefer to see this lager as a firm Oktoberfest with the soul of structure of German lager."

"Overall - a little big for sessioning but a very tasty double pils."

"Easy to drink and enjoyable. Sweeter than I was expecting but doesn't ruin the experience. Worth consideration, but nothing I would regularly seek out."

"O: Overall a good flowery hop level, nice pilsner grain base, the more you drink, the more you appreciate. Definitly worth a drink, worthy of repeat, a 2x pilsner with extra incentive."

"Overall I guess this beer is OK the ABV is well hidden but it doesn't have the snappy hop profile it suggests on the label. Not going to pick it up again."

"interesting. not my fave double pils by a longshot but not a bad beer, a nice option if you see it on tap on the town out with the boys"

"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, no bottle dating. Pours lightly hazy golden straw color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of lemon, orange zest, pear, apple, pepper, cracker, bread, floral, grass, light pine, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of malt, hop, and yeast notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon zest, grapefruit, orange zest, pear, pine, cracker, bread, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon zest, grapefruit, orange zest, pear, pine, cracker, bread, floral, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance of malt, hop, and yeast flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice imperial pils. All around well balanced hop, malt, and yeast flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"Decent pils. Kind of a grain thing on the nose. Flavor is kind of clogged and thick. Doesn't really shine as sharply as I'd want. It's just there really. Definitely could use a sharper character profile."

"The taste is very hoppy. It has a bitterness and hoppy piney taste, but it is unique. It has a great hoppy bitterness that stays on the tongue long after it is gone down the hatch. Overall this is a big win and a brew I would buy again when I wanted a big (or just good-sized) beer."

"(O)- Overall, an easy drinking imperial pilsner. Nothing done over the top either, just a crisp, enjoyable take on the style."
""
"Overall: Way off the mark for an Imperial Pils both in the sweetness and in the hop profile but still rather enjoyable to drink"
"More ""round"" than crisp, particularly for a pilsner. The malt is rich as is the body, which belies the style. Still, it holds its own with spicy BBQ food. The hop is stronger than the smell suggests, making this a well-balanced profile. Very clean."
""
"The beer is lighter golden in color with a head that sports middle of the pack retention and spots of lace around the glass. Its nose is respectable too, with notes of lemon and grassy aroma, and a touch of biscuit. Then I was in for a little surprise with the nose...well, relative to what I was anticipating. Not knowing what the ABV was, it tasted like a good pilsner without a kick of alcohol. Biscuity and lemongrass flavors, and some notes of simple crisp hops make this pilsner worth a go. And that's before we had in a body which is a lighter medium with agreeable carbonation and one that's easy to drink despite the alcohol. I don't normally understand the concept of taking pilsners to a higher alcohol, but I think Breckenridge has done well here."

"O: An OK beer .. worth buying a single but not a sixer."

"O: Very nice double pilsner here. Everything balances out nicely and nothing takes over on the tongue. Very good brew here."
""
""
"This beer was better than I expected, on par with the quality put out by Breckenridge. The most notable part of this beer in my opinion was the delicate floral flavor at the end of each sip. The alcohol also made itself known in a favorable way. Nice offering, will try again."
""
"O- Overall, not a fan of this one at all. The taste is just a mess in my opinion. "
"D: too many negatives on the palate to really find this enjoyable or worth recommending. the metallic flavor is rather prevalent and therefore off-putting. pass."
""
"O- Pretty good double pilsner. Somehow it came off to me as a ""milder"" IPA but all the flavours came together well. Would go good with some spicy food."
"Overall, this is a solid double pilsner that fits in with what Breckenridge does."
"Pours a honey golden color that is appetizing, with medium width head. Nose is certainly well within bock territory, nice and bready-malty with some hop zing in there too. Palate offers a big hearty malt profile, light hopping to balance it some, and is very drinkable. A little boozy but still very drinkable."
""
""
"I can sense kingliness whilst in this beer's presence. Not sure why, though... It pours a clear golden straw topped by a finger of white foam. The nose is kinda plain, comprising sweet flowers and grass, with a touch of white bread. The taste brings in more of the same, along with a vague sweetness and some menthol. Things don't quite sit on my tongue all that well, frankly, what with this strange twang tossed in there at what I hope to be the last minute. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly drying finish. Overall, a pils that's a touch too thick and heavy, one with an odd flavor, and one that certainly ain't worth the cost, frankly. Not a fan."
""
""
""
"Overall, an unusual and interesting beer. However, the flavor is a little muddy. Hops are strong, pungent, and spicy."
""
""
""
"Flavor is sweet, biscuit-like with a distinct malt backbone mixed with a hops bitter finish. Hopping is unique, almost a hop-burst character that is both bitter and floral at the same time with a short noble hops bitter finish. A good beer overall but the price was steep by comparison. Has some of the characteristics of Victory Prima Pils but finishes sweeter and not as complex in the hops finish. I'd order it again and buy it again but it's not my go-to Pils."
"Flavor has a touch of light sweetness, almost honey-like. It has a little crackery malt as well. Hopping is interesting, at it has both some bitter, pithy qualities as well as some grassy, spicy, almost pepper-like notes. Rindy bitterness lingers a short spell before fading. Overall? Not bad; I'd have this again, though I wouldn't go out of my way to find it. Prosit!!"

"Poured into a standard pint glass. Pours a light carrot orange, or a hazy light copper color. A light cream sudsy head sits on top for a few moments then dissipates to a wisp of bubbles. Some sticky lacing. Smells bright and slightly hoppy, a hint of a grassy presence. This beer tastes really clean for a 7% ABV beer. Hint of hops, grass, and citrus with a malty undertone makes this beer finish clean. The mouthfeel is just about right. Overall, a clean, bright pilsner that goes down smooth. But the 7% ABV can sneak up on you. The beer is not boozy at all. Another great offering from Breckenridge."
""
"This poured out as a nice looking clear yellowish gold color with a soapy looking white head on top. The smell of the beer wasn't too grassy which I liked. There was a good amount of earth malts and some nice grainy aromas too. The taste of the beer is pretty good, It's got a nice crisp bitter flavor with a light sweetness up front. The mouthfeel is a light and very drinkable. Overall this brew is pretty good, I could see someone drinking quite a few of these in a short period of time."
""
"Overall - Just an ok pilsner. Not too keen on the boozy and spiciness to it."
"Whoa that aftertaste really doesn't work for me. I've had worse, but this is far from the best."
"The palate opens with a blend of the grainy and cereal malt character with the resiny and pungent hops. Moderately floral, though not necessarily ""bright"" (to me, the floral character from, say, Centennials are bright, while the Americanized old world hops are more pungent and snappy), the hops are quite enjoyable. The mid-palate has a moderate malt sweetness, with some honey and graham crackers. The sweetness increases as this beer warms up, making it less pleasant. Mildly metallic and mineral-like on the finish, the combination of pungent hop resins, grainy malt sweetness and the mineral character isn't entirely pleasant. An occasional wisp of alcohol is also noticeable. Medium in body with moderate carbonation, this beer is decent. I doubt I'll go out of my way to drink it again, but if proffered a fresh pour, I will imbibe."
"Light bodied with good carbonation. Goes down smooth. I'm not a pils fan, but this one wasn't too shabby. Wouldn't have again, but a good one to try once."
"Pours a clear, gold color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of alcohol, sweet malt, slight pale malt, yeast, and slight hop. Fits the style of an American Double / Imperial Pilsner. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, alcohol, citrus hops, and slight pale malt. Overall, well blended, good appearance, and good mouth feel."
"On tap at my watering hole, Old Chicago Westminster. Served with a nice finger plus of head that quickly disapated; lacing was pretty nice throughout. Couldn't really pick up anything on the nose. Taste? SWEET. That's the main description. Honey, some malt, SWEETNESS, no hop bitterness to finish. Left some kind of aftertaste I wasn't too fond of. I think I'll pass on this one if offered up to me; I definitely won't be purchasing it again. TOO sweet; no crispness that I like in a pilsner."
"Up for review is a 12oz bottle of Regal Pilsner. Poured into a pint glass. Golden brown with a beige head. Pilsner malts and soem hops. Taste is quite malty for a pilsner. Body a bit thick, but drinks pretty well. More of a big American strong pale ale than a double pils though."
"Poured from a bottle into an Umphrey's McGee pint glass. Clear golden honey color with a thin, wispy layer of white head that leaves some streaky lacing before disappearing almost completely. Aroma is light, of pale malts, grains, and grass. Taste is similar: bready, light malt sweetness, grains, grass, a touch of citrus zest, with a decent balance of malts and hops. Smooth, light mouthfeel, and easily drinkable. It's not often I find a pils that I like."
"Thanks, but I believe I'll pass on this one. This is not what I want from my pilsners."
"guessing that this would be better totally fresh and on tap."
"Overall this is run of mill for the style, not impressed. Would love to try a fresher sample, I believe the hops are tired in this bottle"
"O- Needs a little more carbonation in it. Goes down smooth. Not bad."
"Drinkability- I could easily drink several of these in a session"
"Good drinkability. Well balanced, overall."
"Drinkability: OK but not my favorite. Too much of a Ale/Lager hybrid. I want clean, crisp, refreshing from my pilsener. This was too much like drinking an IPA...but not as good as a standard IPA. Good as far as the style...but not something I'll be looking for."
"Pours a pale golden body with a light off white head billowing nicely above the rim of my glass, with fine even lacing. Aromatics contain pale cereal malts where are the hops, well they are here but not like other imperial pils. A bit of citrus grassiness, but the malts shine out a bit brighter here in the hop profile. Flavor has mineral water harshness with a touch of cereal grains light citric hops, really coatas the palate with a nice rolling biscuit malt sweetness with minimal alcohol showing up on the palate. Just enough herbal/citric/hops to balance really one of the better offerings I've had from Breckenridge. Mouthfeel has a nice full on creamy/airy carbonation going down smooth with each sip leaving behind a faint hop bitterness with streaks of hop oils evident. Drinkability is solid, I was surprised at how well this bigger pils drank and the lack of extreme alcohol and hop bitterness compared to what I have come to expect with this style. I really liked the bottle on this one as well super creative well executed I hope this one makes it back in 2011. If you couldn't tell this review is from notes when it was last released."
"D - This beer is a step up from a normal pilsner but I would not go as far as saying it's an imperial pilsner...a decent beer but there was something missing for me...maybe it was the imperial part"
"D: A pretty good Imperial Pilsner which puts malt qualities up front and thankfully leaves the alcohol behind. It has some flaws but not a bad brew."
"Nothing really stands out with this Imperial Pilsner from Breckenridge."
"This started out good. I really enjoyed the nose. Though it did not hold up after that. Overall another sub standard beer from Breckenridge. Not to mention I think this is a bastard style."
"This beer would be wonderful on draft, but I highly recommend the bottled as well. Awesome packaging too if I might add."
"D: personally like this pils mainly because its simple yet complex."
"Part of Breckenridge's Small Batch Series. Bright, rich golden in color, crowned with a creamy white foam head with legs. Big hop nose that's a bit resiny and dank. Some grass and hay too. Super smooth and creamy with a slightly viscous and chewy body. Malty up front with fresh sweet grains and a touch of honey. Fresh, juicy apples. Spicy hops, with floral, some mild grapefruit, resiny herbal hits, and grass. Mild astringency and a bone-dry finish. Overall, one of the more drinkable Double Pils available. Less about heat (alcohol), more about balance and flavor."
"I poured this average beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was a nice golden color. The beer smelled hoppy and also tasted pretty hoppy. There was nothing special about this beer and nothing terrible, but I will have to say because of the hoppy tast I will not buy again. If you like a strong IPA then maybe you will like it."
"This beer pours a clear golden color with a slight haze. The head is a quarter inch in height, and recedes very quickly into nothing. The aroma is of faint bready malt. The taste has a the same bready malt, and a little bit of noble hops. It is still faint for a beer of its strength. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation that is way too low for a pilsener. Overall, this is a really bad beer that I will not be drinking again."
"The imperial pilsner is a different style to brew, and while this certainly isn't a perfect example, it's definitely a good one. Quite drinkable."
"Drinkability is good an enjoyable enough brew, not something i would really repeat purchase now that its winter. Make a nice tasty hot weather brew though."
"Breckenridge Brewery Regal Pilsner 471 Small Batch Series 12 oz. Bottle Sampled 11/22/2010 from 6-Pack purcahsed same day @ Colorados Liquor Outlet, Colorado Springs, Colorado. 7.0% ABV. 35? IBU's. Mild Noble hop front overwhelmed by sweet malt aroma and lightly flavored thick pils malt liquor body. Odd flavor and cloying mild hot thick end. Rich and smooth, but off balanced and somehow odd. (2.75 / 5.0). Lacy white head. Clear bright rich gold color."
"D - Again, it's a departure from the drinkability of a classic pilsner, something I understand because it's not the same style. This is a tad cloying through it's not offensive in any way. The hops have good flavor and balance. The alcohol isn't noticeable at all."
"D: Feels like an inferior version of a souped-up helles. It would be much more interesting if they cranked up the hops."
"Notes: A little strange tasting beer. It is different from a pilsner in taste. Not a big fan of the way the apple comes out, and a little sweet (not necessarily in a nice sweet bready malt way that some of the great pilsners pull off). Probably not worth the price to get this, even though it isn't a horrible beer, there are better choices."
"Crisp and easy drinking. On the hoppier side for a pilsner. Not bad."
"Picked up a bottle at Abe's Cold Beer. Poured a brilliant gold with a short head a sudzy lacing. The aroma is a touch catty as it warms, but otherwise there's an enticing fruity, floral mix under big woodsy spice. The flavor has a crisp and toasty malt background under big kick of those spicy hops and before a big (but not a huge) biting bitterness. It reminds me of a more reasonable version of the old Sam Adams Imperial Pils. Check it out if you're a fan of the style and big Euro hops."
"There are a few Breckenridge brews that have gotten my attention over the years. Lucky U IPA and 471 ESB (a Scottish ale) come to mind. Sorry to say, Regal Pilsner doesn't have what it takes to be considered among this brewery's best. On a positive note, it has more character than much of what they brew."
"The beer is light to medium with a oily, sticky texture. Carbonation is average and the finish is abrupt with lingering bitterness. What can I say about a beer where the taste is the worst part of the experience? Rather than ponder or get verbose, I'll just say this: I won't be drinking this again anytime soon. If you want to appreciate this style in all its glory, seek out the Boulevard Orval collaboration or the Sam Adams Hallertau Imperial Pilsner."
"Overall, just no. This just isn't good. Too bready and too malty. This one just doesn't work and I don't want a lot of it."
"The beer pours a golden color with a white head. The aroma is some grassy hops along with a lot of bready malt. Not nearly as hoppy smelling as a lot of the imperial pilseners that I have tried. The flavor is more of the same, with a lot of malt and a little bit of grassy and spicy hop character. The alcohol is present, but not too strong. Medium body and medium carbonation."
"D- This beer I had to choke down. The higher ABV limits this beer to a couple of glasses. This beer I didn't like at all. Although, this seems to be a problem I have with this brewery."
"Very drinkable a lot lighter than i was expecting but I could see myself drinking more than one."
"D: The flavor of this was nice, but the nose was just not enjoyable. Not sure what happened there, but such is life."
"Taste: Much like the smell. Floral hops. Moderate bitterness. Smooth mouthfeel with some hints of the alcohol in the finish."
"One of the best ""double pilsners"" I've had. Not completely over the top, this one remains well balanced, with the spirit of a pilsner intact. I'd think of it as a lager for IPA lovers. It's too bad this is an occasional, and the price point is so high, because I'd drink this all the time. I love hops, and really great hoppy pilsners, and this is exactly what I want in a beer."
"Soft, sweet malts up front. Honeyish, with a nice biscuit backing. Herbal, peppery hops come in mid-palate. Bitterness gradually increases toward the finish. Notes of candy-ish fruit and powdered sugar. Dryish finish, with lingering noble-resin bitterness. Not bad. Medium-bodied with a slick feel. Lightly carbonated."
"Taste-Subtle malt sweetness, grain, biscuit, and a nice sharp, spicy hop bite that lingers throughout. Crisp, well balanced and very drinkable. A good match with a plate of tacos."
"This is a very drinkable brew that would likely pair wonderfully with many dishes. A worthy small batch production."
"Overall- The combination of bigger alcohol and an excellent hop balance creates a delightful brew that reminds me a bit of a white wine! Very drinkable (maybe dangerously so) and one of those beers that you can sit and sip, or really have fun pairing it with food! Well done Breckenridge!"
"I wasn't sure about this at first, but it grew on me as I made my way through the bottle. Smell is fairly mild, a hint of bready malt with subtle hop aroma. This seemed watery and a bit sweet on the first sip, but a definite hop backbone comes through in the aftertaste. Well-balanced, full-bodied (but not heavy) and pleasantly strong. I got this as a single but would be happy to have another one."
"Clear, copper with a sudsy cream colored head that leaves sheets of sticky lace on the glass. Fruity american hop notes and untoasted grain with a slightly floral perfumey quality in the aroma. Clean and dry flavors with plenty of fresh spicy hop bittering and a slightly warm alcoholic finish. Full bodied with nice heft and smooth carbonation. This is a strange brew for sure..clean and grainy with a boozy kick and plenty of hop flavor, kind of like a small batch, hoppy malt liquor. I dig it."
"D - I found this to be one of the more drinkable Imperial Pilsners I've come across in my travels. This one swaps flavor for warm alcohol notes, making it one of my favorite examples of the styles I've sampled thus far."
"Pours golden with grassy and lemony citrus hops. The flavor is similar; hoppy, peppery, grass up front with the Pale malt showing more in the finish, easing up on the dryness level a bit, but it's still fairly dry. It's stronger, but still maintains the flavor and hop character of a good traditional pils. Not bad."
"With all that said, it's not a bad beer. Drinkable, but with the choices given, certainly not one to select again."
"On tap at the Rackhouse Pub. I think it was just listed as Breckenridge Imperial Pilsner but whatever. I t was yellow and smelled like a pilsner with an unfortunate hint of wet dog at first. As it warmed up it was gone so I can't complain too much about the dog qualities. it had a fruity taste but also dirty and thick, not my cup of tea as far as a pilsner goes. Odell I think had this style nailed with their Double Pilsner but I would not get this again."
"D: This was a nice offering, but a bit too boozy for my tastes on a warm June evening. The lightness makes it go down quick for a beer this strong."
"Had this one on tap at the Rackhouse Pub in Denver. Don't really know much about it, but it was billed as an imperial pilsner. Maybe a little dark for the style, a dark gold/amber color, with a little bit of white foam. Some sweet malt/caramel aroma, almost like a strong adjunct lager. Not much flavor wise, similar to the smell. A decent beer, but I won't be ordering another one."
