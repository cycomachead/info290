3.53,-8.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.5,"This is a crisp beer. Definitely a lager or pilsner style beer. Color is light copper color, very similar to Yuengling really. Not a malt bomb but not really hoppy either. It was labeled as a IPA style lager. I don't detect that much hop in the flavors. Maybe I have had too many true IPA's but this one is not hoppy at all. It is very much a lager. I won't go through a full review. I will say that its a decent beer but like so many craft breweries that make stuff that is away from a good IPA or Stout that they are known for it just is not worth the price difference. When you can get a 12 pack of adjunct lager 12 oz cans for maybe a couple of bucks more. Like I said this beer reminds me a lot of Yeungling and was only two dollars less than the local grocery chain has a 12 pack on sale for this week.","humuloner22","Jul 15, 2014"

The flavor mirrors this, with a great balance of toasty malt and sharp, bitter hoppiness. Very drinkable hoppy malty lager, like a hoppy octoberfest!","allengarvin","Jul 03, 2014"

The taste is a replica of the nose, but the flavors are a bit more intense than the aroma would suggest--the piney hops flavor was most prominent. I was pleasantly surprised that there was a good malt character to the brew. The finish, as typical with lagers, was very clean. Overall, it was a flavorful, well-balanced brew.

Very hop forward aroma sweet delicious citrus and pine resin. Just the slightest bit of pale malt coming through as it warmed but I am comfortable saying this brew basically smells of nothing but sweet delicious hops. Hell yeah! The taste of this beer is also very hoppy. Piney and grassy characteristics with a good amount of hop bitterness. This is quite a tasty brew but it is not particularly balanced. There is not enough malt backbone to support the intense hop presence in this beer. That being said, that is kind of the point of this beer; to showcase the hops on a clean base that you don't really notice. In this sense they succeeded but the whole idea is fundamentally flawed. However, I personally prefer beers that are overly hoppy as opposed to overly malty so i dont really mind that this beer is unbalanced and this is a flaw that is in someways appealing and it sets this beer apart. Overall this is not a Ballast Point masterpiece but it is damn good. Absolutely something to check out if you like hops and like IPAs that aren't too malty. I will buy this brew again.","CA_brewster","Nov 19, 2013"

4.2,8.5,4,4,4,4,5,"Drinkability is pretty much off the scales. It's super refreshing and finishes super super dry which beckons you to sip more. I dusted it off ridiculously quick and could have had much more. Super approachable as long as you like hoppy beers already.","Bubba83","Dec 22, 2009"
4.42,14.2,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Poured a nice golden color at the lighter end of the spectrum, but well within a lager's range. A nice white head on it. Smell is strong with hops--lots of pine and a bit of backing citrus and floral. Taste was nice and resiny with little malt backing. We had a few IPL's on the trip, and this one was right up there with Humulus from The Bruery. Nice mouthfeel and fantastic drinkability. This is an emerging style I'd like to see more of, and Ballast Point has absolutely nailed it.","Thorpe429","Dec 04, 2009"
4,3.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Draught at the brewery. Orange tinted gold color with a lasting white head. Lots of hops in the aroma with flowers, mangos, and peaches adding fruit to the spicy and grassy notes that some more euro hops seem to be adding. The flavor has some light and toasty malt with lots of hop flavor (mango, peach, grapefruit peel) and more bitterness than the sculpin that I had right before. Medium bodied with smooth carbonation. Cool mix of fruity with grassy and spicy hops. I'd definitely like to have this one again.","bulletrain76","Mar 09, 2009"
4.1,5.9,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Very nicely done version of this style, that packed a ton of juicy hop flavor into a firm, crisp, (and most of all) extremely easy drinking package. I literall could have just stood around and drank this all day but other beers beckoned.","Kegatron","Jan 20, 2009"
4.31,11.4,5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"D: Very high. This is higher in alcohol, but only feeling it rather than tasting it. Only lower points due to alcohol feeling. (Only 6.8% I see! It felt higher)","dfillius","May 11, 2008"
4.27,10.3,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Tap @ Hamilton's. This is not the first IPL I've had, but its definitely the best. Pours clear gold with a one-finger white head. Moderate lacing. Sweet, floral hop aroma. Lots of pine and lemongrass, less of the grapefruit/citrus. Sharp, crisp resin bite up front. Mellows a little into a grapefruit-lemon-orange peel sweetness. The lager back enhances the West Coast IPA feel, giving it a sweet finish. I could drink this all night its so smooth. Very well done.","magictrokini","Apr 02, 2008"
4.1,5.9,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Drinkability is high, nice balance of malts and hops in a lager framework, carbonation is overly high, but this is very drinkable for a unique style","Stoneman78","Sep 29, 2007"
3.4,-12.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"D: An interesting beer from Ballast Point, but I'd take their regular IPA over this any day.","Halcyondays","Beers"
