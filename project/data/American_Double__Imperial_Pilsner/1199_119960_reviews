"In a blind taste test, not sure I could tell this apart from an IIPA, but it does have a bit of a hop-to-malt character with little taste in between. More malt-forward as it warms up, but IMO, it's best consumed cold. I feel like this beer was made to get you drunk on a nice, summer evening with no questions asked. 8.7%, but by the bottom of the bottle, you'll swear it was 11%. Good stuff."

"I was not really a big fan of this beer. My best succinct description of it would be ""a syrupy IPA""."
""
""

""

"O - Nice combination of flavors.  More bitter/aggressive than Sierra's Hoppy Lager. The candied fruit sweetness in this beer saves it from being too bitter. I like it."

"2/20 Bottle - Nice solid golden clean pour with a clean white head. Smelled of orange, lemon, and fruity hops. Tasted somewhat bitter, hoppy which I enjoyed it a lot. Higher carbonation than expected, it good drinking. The beer felt stronger/ more intense afterward than I expected based on the ABV, but clean taste and smooth going down. This is another very good offering by Founders, and I look forward to more pours of this and other offerings down the road"

"Overall, a superb Founders limited brew that has a bitter, earthy, fruit-hinted hop-bite, and sips quite well despite it seeming at times to exceed the 8.7% abv. as labeled. To me it seems a fine line between a DIPA and an IPL (as this is labeled). Dissenter's hop profile reminds me of Stone's Enjoy By. That's a great thing."
""
""
"O:  This is a great IPL.  Great hop flavors and the malt struggles to balance.  decent complexity and a solid mouthfeel as well.  Not a lot of clarity but I won't hold that against it.  If you like clean hoppy beers this is a good one to try."
""
""
""
""
"Excellent beer. Great hops, awesome aroma."
""
""
""
"Golden yellow with a sprightly white head.  Smells vociferous with pine, melon, and citrus zest.  Tastes of more citrus and other light fruits.  Slight chalk and cracker in the middle.  Full on pine in the finish.  Has a medium, well-rounded body.  Alcohol asserts itself in the end.  A grand example in a style that shouldn't work but does."
""
""
"An interesting concoction from Founders in a relatively new style: the India Pale Lager. It's hoppy and bitter in the beginning like an IPA but the maltiness comes in and mellows it out on the finish like a real lager. Fairly good and worth a try!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very Crisp and clean. Smooth taste"
"O: nice crisp hoppy version of the hybrid style"
""
""
""
"O – Very much like an IPA, but with mostly absent malt character, allowing hop aroma, flavor, and bitterness to be showcased.  Bitterness might be a bit out of whack, but this is a very good imperial pilsner, a lot more interesting than I expected."

"Overall this isn't a style I'm usually fond of, but this beer was good. Not something I'm going crazy over, but still enjoyable."
""
"Brings out some deep hop notes amidst a clean palate and crispy smooth mouthfeel. Light floral feel on the nose. Bold and layered. There is an IPA feel but this is rooted firmly in the lager camp, which sort of makes it an odd and unique hybrid. A diversion from the usual Backstage series offerings but worthy of a look nonetheless."
""
"Beer was ok.  Give it a try"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
" A solid take on the style."
""
""
"This was great the first time I imagined reviewing it, and it's remarkably still great nearly 4 months later. This might still be worth picking up if it's collecting dust on a shelf. It does not reach the glory of some of the hoppy lagers from Jack's Abby, but that's not really a fair comparison."
""
"Nice Imperial IPL with a clear bitterness backed by a good deal of caramel malts. I found the Fathom a bit better, maybe it is less sweet."
""
""
""
""
"Finally got my hands on a bomber of this in Dec. '14 (ie, not terribly fresh). Still, very impressed with hoppy, highly floral aroma (with a hint of a soapy/piney backbone) on the front end, followed by a hop-wallop that dissipated nicely into a heavy Pilsner-like finish that was more like a smooth, slightly barley-ish finish. Overall, a very enjoyable IPL, though not quite up to the standard of others (esp. those from Jack's Abby, which are the obvious gold standard). All the same, I'd be in favor of Founders adding this to the yearly seasonal 4-pack rotation along with Backwoods Bastard and Dark Penance."
"D: This was a great IPA, not sure about the lager part. Great crisp scent and taste. The body was only ok, and the finish was a little hot, so it was better to sip. Still, a delicious brew."
"Taste is potent. Intense bittering citrus hops. Booze is hidden well in this wallop of a lager. Would easily double as a high-octane IPA. Hop-hounds flock to this one, others steer clear."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Rich golden colored with good clarity.  A fingernail of off white heads covers the top.  Brussels lacing. Lucious aroma of grapefruit emerges from the glass.  The taste is very much as advertised by the nose.  Grapefruit like flavor with a very smooth finish.  The malt is dulled due tot lagering.  Very easy drinking hop forward beer,but the back of the palate is pretty tame."
""
""
"Slightly hazy yellow-orange pour with a one finger pure white head with decent retention and nice lacing.  The nose is fruity, floral, and hoppy with a bold malt profile complementing.  Hints of pine, caramel, grass, mango, and butterscotch. The taste follows suit with loads of bitter, resiny hops up front along with hints of pine, caramel, grass, pineapple, mango, brown sugar, and grapefruit.  The mouthfeel is chewy and oily with incredible balance and drinkability and a smooth, tangy, bittersweet finish.  Overall, this beer really shocked me.  So bold and flavorful, balanced and drinkable.  Kicking myself for not picking up more of this.  Highly recommended!"
"O - A tasty brew. I would consider it a side project of a DIPA.  Well done though."
"Very tasty"

"Not bad, but also not great.... ballast point Fathom IPL much better... the aftertaste lingers way too long on this beet and smell, color, looks just like any IPA... had side by side with Ballast Point Fathom and hands down Fathom blew this one away in all aspects... color, smell, all... Fathom IPL for a 22 oz bomber is also 1/2 the price for same and better beer and I love most Founders Beer."

"Brown with red tint and light head.  Sweet on the front end with subtle bitterness of unsweetened chocolate.  Not at all chewy, which I was hoping for, but all in all a tasty beer."

"Dark straw. The nose has both hoppy and citrus notes.  Potent malt flavors start off the tasting experience and are followed by a strong punch of hops."
""
""
""
"Deep golden body with a finger of white head and great lacing.  Cracker malts, lemon, orange and citrus piths in the nose.  Citrus flavors grip the palate with grapefruit and orange flavors.  Bitterness grips ups front with cracker like malts doing little to hold back the hops.  Clean on the finish and the bitterness doesn't linger, which I like. Body is medium and mouthfeel is carbonated just enough.  This was interesting, very nice platform for hops to just take the stage.  If your looking for balance, look elsewhere."

"Humans are naturally hard-wired skeptics of bitterness. It's in our DNA. So it's fair to say that most of us had to acquire the taste for beer. And many never become comfortable enough with it to enjoy IPAs and other such aggressively hopped styles. I don't know why not. For me, overtly, tropically hoppy beers like Dissenter - whether lager or ale - are pure bliss in a bottle."

"O - do I personally want to see Founders brewing lagers in place of ales? Probably not. Not when there are already so many good ones available. That was my thinking going in. If something like this could find its way into a 4 pack through the summer it would be a real treat. It's that tasty! The big bodied stout brewery pulled it off with flying colors. Now, let's get back to ales. Kudos to Founders and this Imperial IPL, the Dissenter!"

"Pours a clear yellowish orange color with a big 2"" head that slowly falls to a thick surface covering. Big earthy and grassy aroma. Caramel, grapefruit, earthy hops bitterness, and asome grassy tones are wrapped in a warming alcohol blanket. Mildly refreshing. Easy to consume and provides a nice flavor profile."

"Poured a lovely clear golden body with a thin cap of white foam. It looks quite typical for a lager, but very inviting. Scents of pine resin, vegetal, oniony hops, grapefruit peel notes of tropical fruit, and orange flesh and peel. Overall impression of aroma is of a nicely hop forward beer, that is most like an IPA, despite this being an imperial lager. Very nice and appealing. Flavor begins moderately bitter with notes of pine resin, oniony, earthy, vegetal hops and light grapefruit. In the middle, the same flavors continue, but grapefruit becomes more prominent, as do the earthy, vegetal hops. Finish is earthy, vegetal hops, grapefruit peel, pine resin, and a hint of faint alcohol. Aftertaste is pine resin, floral, bitter hops, light sweet Pilsner malt and grapefruit peel. Overall impression of flavor is of a wonderfully hoppy lager that is clean and thus showcases the hops. Very nice. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation and a somewhat resinous, drying mouthfeel. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a wonderful hoppy beer that is easy to drink and pleasant. Overall is an excellent beer that is hoppy in aroma and flavor, with a nice mouthfeel that aids the overall impression. Very nice and highly recommended."

" The taste is very smooth with mild malt that leads to tangy tinge with herbal hop flavor bordering on dank with medium spice and gentle piney almost noble-type flavor with slight lemongrass which leads to sweetened grapefruit and mild orange zest flavor w/ mild pils malt backing up the hops well. There is only a slight grassy/peppery tinge in the finish as the alcohol is low and the malt seems a little sweeter/bitterness in balance as it nears cellar temp with resins giving a dry impression in the finish.  Overall I consider this an excellent India Pale lager with nice amount of alcohol and hop bitterness with nice dry crisp lager quality ..I would glady drink this again for sure!"
""
""
""
""
"Clear golden pour with an airy white one-finger head. Big citrus aroma with grapefruit standing out. Powerful flavor with a strong grapefruit, orange and resin bitterness upfront. Mango also stands out a bit. Medium bodied but drinks very easy for being so strong and bitter. Finishes with a really nice lingering grapefruit bitterness."

"Overall: Another great beer from Founders."

"(3.80) O: Overall a big dry hopped pale lager, not much flavor component, crisp use of lager yeast, dry hopped to the max, warming glow of alcohol shows its abv. A bit pricey at $15 a bomber would be my only hesitation for recommendation. Its good, just not impressive with exception of the dry hopping level."

"Overall, this is the latest release in Founders “Backstage Series”, and it’s certainly a different style, being a lager, for them to take on.  Like each member of the series, the label is alluring, bizarre, and beautiful.  Our first thought on the aroma was that it smelled just like their All Day IPA, but with a touch more sweetness.  But let’s be real, the most surprising thing about this beer is how dang heavy and full-bodied it is.  This, combined with the penetrating piney bitterness of the hops, makes for an intense beer.  All of this makes the drinker sit back on their heels a bit, allowing you time to discuss and pontificate.  We are pleased to have been able to try this offering, and feel it fits well amongst the Founders pedigree.  The aromas and flavors are bold to the last drop, and should appease all but the most obstinate of advocates."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bomber into a shaker pint, the beer is a bright, crystal clear, honey-gold coloring, with a tall, foamy, frothy, bright white head.  Plenty of carbonation moving throughout the body. Aromas of resinous hops, with a richly sweet grapefruit character, subtle sugary and floral highlights, and a solid toasted backbone. Smells terrific. Flavors are resinous forward, with a blast of pine pitch, bitterness, grapefruit notes, hints of tropical fruits, floral highlights, and a toasted grain backbone once again.  The body is smooth and big, robust, but all the while remaining very drinkable.  The aftertaste is roasty and toasty, with a hops fingerprint all over, including a bitter and resin blend. The finish is smooth and light, with a subtle crispness.  Dangerously easy to drink."

"Big hop bang and bitterness for a lager!"
"It's a hop bomb with a pleasant smell. Though it looks like a lager, it tasted like a west coast-style IPA to me. I loved the beer, but the ABV is 8.7%, so drink this with caution.  Think of it as an imperial IPA."

"Haven't had too many APL's and of the few I have tried none had done enough to get me to consider myself a fan of this style until I tried this one. If they would throw this in 12 oz bottles and sell 4 or 6 packs of it, it would be a staple in my fridge. Pours light golden yellowish with a white head. Aroma is very clean and crisp with some sweet and citric fruitiness of some tangerines and grapefruit, a touch of some apricot,  floral, a little grassy, and a thin underbelly of some cracker. Flavor follows suit. Really enjoy the clean, crisp finish to this. A thinnish medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall love this beer even if I won't spend the $12 for a 750 ml bottle of it. Any time I see it on tap, though, I will continue to order it."

"Overall-  Very Good IPL, but comparatively speaking its not quite a great IPL.  The hop flavors are good, but not great and the finish is a bit awkward.  This would probably work better as a lower abv IPL to reduce he malt and showcase the hops more.  Definitely glad I tried as this is a style I love seeing more of, but I probably wouldn't get this again (this year at least). However, If it were in a 12oz 4 pack for $12 then I might.  (86/100)"

"Overall - Excellent beer. Loads of flavor, hoppy, balanced and easy enough to drink. Really drinks like a ipa but the lager aspect comes in and really ties it together. Excellent beer."
"Got some sharp citrus in the nose, but that went quickly by the wayside. Favoring grassy, resiny, lightly oniony hops for flavoring, the only respite before the bitterness kicks in is slightly sweet, alcohol laden malt. Very earthy, and just not my style. Not a lager fan, and this is uber lager."

"Overall: Top marks. A tasty sipper that could easily go down too easy. Will have to pace myself."
"750ml bottle served in a tulip.  Pours a translucent straw gold with a loose, quarter inch, white head that quickly dissipates into a sudsy mass towards the shoulders.  Nose is grassy with a trace of citrus and skunk.  There's also a suggestion of biscuit malts.  Taste consistent with nose - fortunately, the light skunkiness present in the nose is not present in the flavor profile.  Definitely a little more malt forward than a typical IPL; however, not much so.  Citrus, grassiness and biscuit malts coalesces nicely.  There's also a distinct noble hops bittering and a trace of ethanol that lightly lingers between quaffs. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a pleasant, even carbonation and a kiss of oiliness to the texture.  Nothing crazy here, but a solid representation of the style without being too malty."

"Overall: another great beer from founders backstage series, unfortunately this one doesn't do quite enough to stick out in its style. cool to see founders bottling lagers but they could do other things without a barrel much better"

"This is an Imperial India Lager and it does an excellent job of fulfilling all three descriptors. First off the Imperial portion is obvious as this has huge flavor and high alcohol, but no booziness. The India portion denotes a strong hop presence of grapefruit, herbal tones, flower, some citrus, sour lemon, pine and resiny bitterness. Lager is obvious in a crackerish, dry, bready malt backbone. This is a fun and different beer with a strong astringency and dryness."

"Overall a good beer that covers the ABV well enough and was enjoyable, especially for a style I don't have often. This beer was confusing a bit as it seemed like a DIPA at times and seemed like a strong lager at times, so this hybrid Imperial India Pale Lager to me is a pretty tasty style since this beer worked for me and I liked it. The booze was present the whole time, but it was still smooth and not a slow sipper. Definitely worth checking out."

"overall, REALLY impressed by this beer.  will definitely need to seek out another,"

"Pours a beautiful clear gold with a creamy head that mostly melts away fairly quickly, but leaves just enough to offer some nice lacing. The aroma is interesting, with a distinct IPA hop profile (citrus, pine) but a certain lighter, crisp quality to it. The taste is similar, with a almost 100% IPA flavor profile (caramel sweetness and a nice hit of hops) but there's a pleasant crisp quality to it. The body is definitely a lager, but its not thin or watery and holds the flavor well. This is a great new style of beer."

"One inch white head with excellent retention. The aroma of this beer rivals some of the best DIPAS I've ever had, crisp citrus especially grapefruit. The taste is really interesting. Its apparent that this is a lager yet their is a ton of hop flavor especially in the after taste. The bottom fermenting yeasts allow for the hop flavor to dominate this beer. Mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing, high ABV is masked quite well."
"Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Has a grapefruit and pineapple aftertaste with some pine. Very nice India Pale Lager from Founders. Worth picking up if you get the chance."

"Golden color lager with a rich, soap like head that leaves suds all over the glass. Exceptional retention.  Fresh aroma of floral hops with a tropical, citrus quality.  Huge bitterness his the tongue right away and follows the nose well.  Mild honey sweetness mid drink. Well balanced.  Medium bodied. Smooth feel. Great carbonation. Dry finish. This is the first lager I have ever had from Founders brewing and I am pleased to say it is delicious."

" O: The alcohol was a bit much for me, I think if this wasn't imperial strength (scaled down ) it would have been world class, but the alcohol bite took something away for me. Great beer nonetheless, maybe not worth the price but something you don't see everyday"

"Pours a clear, gold/copper color.  1/2 inch head of a white color.  Great retention and good lacing.  Smells of strong citrus (strawberry), hops, sweet malt, alcohol, and a hint of pine.  Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level.  There is also a strong bitterness.  Fits the style of an American Double / Imperial Pilsner. Tastes of slight strawberry, strong citrus, hops, sweet malt, slight pale malt, hint of alcohol, and a hint of pine.  Overall, good appearance, decent aroma, body, but weak feel, and average blend."

"O: Interesting IPL. Lots of great bitter, drying hop flavors in this one. Lots of super pungent, super bitter citrus flavors. Just enough spiciness to complement it. Little sign of a malt at all. Super dry and crisp, the aftertaste is like the sahara desert in my mouth."

She decided based on the other beers I was drinking that I deserved to have the last bottle of this beer to go!  However I cracked it with a new friend and fellow Italiano that day @ Giant Eagle Market District Robinson’s tasting bar!"

"Mouthfeel has to be the absolute best part (100/100!!).  With how flavorful this beer is, its a light, to medium feel, not heavy at all, yet it has a lingering flavor.  Strong carbonation without being fizzy and doesn't bite at all.  Starts sweet and gradually goes to the appropriate amount of bitterness leading to a nice hoppy dry, and very clean bitter finish.  Balance is perfect and it's CRAZY drinkable.  I was literally disappointed when I emptied this bottle.  If this were sold in six/four packs I would love it.  Nice job Founders!  This is a phenominal beer and an ""Imperial IPL"" like this holds breweries like Jack's Abby (the best brewery at lagering in my opinion) in check.  This is a great, drinkable beer that I hope isn't a one time brew.  Special thanks to Bin Ends Braintree for saving me a bottle."

"Dissenter is crisp, clean, packed with hops and bone dry. It's everything most Imperial IPLs try to be and fail. Founder's nailed this guy and while this is still a bit of an odd style to me at times this version works well. As usual, go buy this beer that Founder's brewed, you won't be disappointed."
""
""
""
"O - Definitely an interesting IPA (listed as an IPL; India Pale Lager; due to bottom fermentation yeast) Subtly complex with a different feel than normal.  Malt stands out more as compared to normal IPAs.  ABV is hidden well.  4.25/5"
"O:  A great beer, overall.  It's called a lager, but its name is pretty much the only thing lager-y about it.  That doesn't stop it from being really good, though."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: Really reminds me more of a DIPA as I'm not getting the malty/sweetness I expect with imperial lagers but still a well-made tasty beer and definitely recommended if you like that style"

"Wow. Awesome beer. Darker shade of straw in appearance. Had a frothy head that slow dissipated. Smells of light pine, lots of grapefruit, biscuity malt. Tastes like it smells. Lots of grapefruit and a bready malt. Well balanced. 8.7 abv hidden well. Nice thick lacing down the glass. Mouthfeel has an oily feel and just enough carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I tried this on tap at Founder's on the day of release. I like today's offering better. It is loaded with aroma and flavor, and I like how the malt mellows it from being really bitter beer. The slick mouthfeel seals the deal for me."

""
""
"Overall:  I have never been thrilled by Imperial Pilsners and this one is no exception; I often find them too sweet and that is the case here, as well"
""
"Overall, not my favorite IPA (or IPL) flavors.  This definitely beats you down with hop resin and bitterness, I guess in an attempt to prove that lagers can be imperial as well.  The nice mouthfeel lessens the impact somewhat (in a good way), but it's still kind of an over-hopped monster."

"Too heavy for the flavor profile."
"750 ml bottle into lager glass; no bottle dating, but was just released. Pours crystal clear pale golden color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of big tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, lemon zest, apricot, floral, grass, pine, cracker, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great complexity of bright citrus/tropical/pine hops and moderate pale malt balance; with great strength. Taste of big tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, lemon zest, apricot, floral, grass, pine, cracker, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Good amount of earthy pine/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, lemon zest, apricot, pine, cracker, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity of bright citrus/tropical/pine hops and moderate pale malt sweetness; with a nice malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent IPL. All around great complexity and balance of citrus/tropical/pine hops and moderate pale malt sweetness; and very smooth and crisp to drink for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."
"Recommendation: If you're a big fan of Founder's or the lager style, definitely try this beer."
""
""
""
""

"The taste brings back some of the flavors I originally smelled.  Light flavored pitted fruit flavors combined nicely with a honey sweetness, but also a nice strain of light pine woodiness.  The beer is a bit sweeter than is like, especially on first sip, but also has a good dose of bitterness to counter it.  I definitely would have trouble telling the was a lager."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I kind of wish the malt presence was a tad bit higher but, other than that, this is a very drinkable and enjoyable IPL."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Another gem from the Backstage Series. Emphasis on the Imperial in this IIPL. The aroma is certainly of a big DIPA but the taste reminds to this is just a massively hopped lager. Glad I should be easily able to pick up a few more bottles of this."
""
""
""
"The aroma is filled with citrus, with lots of orange, lemon peel, and some peach. In the taste these are toned down somewhat. There is also an almost complete lack of malt backbone. What malt is there only adds a slight bready/cracker ness to the beer. Being a IPL this is to be somewhat expected. I only wish the malt would have kicked up just a bit."
""
"O: Really an outstanding beer. It's just shy of the best, and not by much."
""
"o - Overall a very nice lager; if they made this all the time and knocked it down to 12 oz. 4-packs I'd buy it all the time. Hoppy and easy to drink, well worth checking out."

"Altogether a very agressive beer featuring strong hop flavors. Enjoyable without any glaring flaws, but I don't find all the pieces of the puzzle coming together cohesively. The malt gives a sticky sweet finish and the hops can be a little strong and almost astringent."

"Solid hoppy lager coming from Founders but the one problem I have is the heavy zesty bitterness and high carbonation combining to a bit harsh. This distracts somewhat from the other flavors."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Dissenter is the best example of a hopped up lager I've tried yet. The body is remarkably light and refreshing for a brew with such an alcoholic heft and this goes down dangerously easily. I've strayed away from this style for the most part but might have to give it a little more attention after enjoying this delicious lupulin shot."

"A very tasty and drinkable IPA-inspired lager that comes across like a pilsner with some ale-like characteristics. Goes down easy and doesn't really let on its strength at first, although it warms a bit later on. Pretty great and worth a try."
""
""
"The overall rating for this beer seemed a bit low to me at first, but I can understand why, I think -- it tastes quite familiar, but with a pretty big bump on the price tag. Not sure I'd buy this again with cheaper beers tasting a bit similar to this one, but this is still a World Class sort of Imperial IPA -- well, lager -- that deserves your attention. One of my very favorite beers of 2014."

"750 ml bottle. Served in a pilsener glass, the beer pours a mostly clear gold color with a half inch white head. Head retention is good, and there's a decent amount of lacing. The brew smells like citrusy hops (tropical fruit, grapefruit, orange peel), grassy hops, and some bready/grainy malt. Taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but with the addition of some pine hops, light floralness and melon. Mouthfee/body is medium, it's smooth and a bit creamy with moderate carbonation. I think it's a good brew, certainly worth a try. $11.99 a bottle."

"O: Big 'ol hop-bomb of a beer. Reasonably priced. Would have liked a little more lageristic crispness and a little less booze, but definitely something I could drink regularly."
"O: struck me as a pilsener in the style of an IPA, with some extra abv thrown in for good measure; I suppose fans of pilseners and IPAs and pale ales in general will enjoy this; not as crisp or refreshing as pilseners usually are. Reasonably priced (for Founders) and worth a buy and try."

"Properly poured into a matching Dissenter glass. A clear, golden color, with a huge puff of frothy bone white head--three fingers in the glass at least--which simmered down to a thick layer, and eventually to a small collar, leaving random dabs of lacing on the glass. Lots of fresh fruity hops in the aroma up front, floral, giving way to an obvious bready malt nose, full of lager yeast. No amount of hops could hide the fact that this was a lager. Taste was pretty much full-blown lagertown, bready, yeasty, caramel, the hops bringing in a dull bitterness, and the freshness of the aroma just not carrying through into the taste. Some solventy booze heat in there as well, sensing every bit of the 8.7%ABV. Body was pretty big actually, and on the fuller side of medium, which I didn't much care for, chewy, syrupy, and obviously malt-driven to get that ABV up. Got exponentially worse as the beer sat / came up closer to room temp. This one just didn't do anything for me. Came off like an IPA that was way past its prime."

"Served on tap at Bigby's Pour House. Pours a nice and bright clear gold with some soapy white head. Nose is delightfully hoppy with and emphasis on floral notes paired with some heavy cereal malt character. The hop present with some leafy grassy notes, flowers, and pine. Taste has a heavy bitterness throughout. The lager components are noteable throughout as the is less of that fruity ale component and more of that dry grain lager quality. The floral hops come through strongly and make for a resinous finish. Mouthfeel is exceptionally light for the weight of this beer. Overall, decent brew with a nice hop profile and it sets itself apart from its top fermenting brethren."
""
"25.4oz bottle. Pours a translucent golden straw color with an inch of head. Good amount of lacing. The aroma is lots of juicy tropical fruits and citrus. Sweet grapefruit, pineapple, mango, and white grapes. Some sweet bread as well. The taste is more dank than the aroma indicated but there is still the citrus and tropical fruits. Grapefruit, lemon, orange and some mango. Pretty noticeable alcohol presence. Finishes with grapefruit and some light malts. Dank aftertaste. Lots of bitterness. Mouthfeel is light but has a lot of carbonation. Overall, I'm very happy with this one and it is certainly one of the best of the style I have had to date."
""
"Overall (3.75): This is plenty enjoyable, no question about it. It didn’t live up to its potential, though—only Jack’s Abby has really nailed the Imperial IPL, from what I’ve seen anyway. What this does do is offer a drinkable beer that’s India first, Imperial second, Pale third, and Lager last. If that’s what you’re looking for in a beer like this, then you’ll be very pleased. If you’re looking for a big lager that’s hoppy as hell, it won’t hit a bullseye but it’ll do just fine."
"Overall it's a big style blur since the hop forward quality hints at a classic American IPA, with much classic lager character hardly distinguishable if left to pasture. It's probably not what I am looking for in a lager, but it's a neat creative bent, and certainly drinkable and enjoyable. Good for Founders mor mixing it up a bit."
""
""
"Fantastic aroma, juicy fresh hops, clean, with nothing to mess up the beautiful aroma of the hops. Mouthfeel was crisp like a Lager should be, followed by a sticky, juicy, exposed hop flavor. (the hops tasted like they were naked, with nothing there to cover them up, and they stood tall, let'n it all be exposed). The finish was dry, with a slight, almost forgettable, slick oily, at the back of yer throat, persistent, lingering, hop taste that clings to yer teeth and gums,...WOW!it tastes so clean, yet I feel so dirty!!!"

"O- I haven't had too many hoppy lagers but this is definitely the best one I've had. It slight edges out Short's MMMKAY because of its restrained bitterness. The price point was still a bit high, especially when I could get a 6-pack of MMMKAY, an equally hopped beer, for the same price. Still a great beer and hope to see more Midwest hoppy lagers like this one in the future."
"Overall I thought this was a good beer and I thought it was a very nice example of a hoppy Lager, it did a really great job at showcasing those great fruity hops and the clean lager base seemed to work well with the hop profile and it let the citra hops really shine. This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, clean, crisp, slightly oily, slightly sticky, not too filling and the taste did a good job of holding my attention, I think one glass would be a good amount for me, but I know I wouldn't have a problem drinking a full bottle, but that would be my limit and I think it makes for a nice beer to enjoy on a warm summer evening. What I like the most about this beer was the hop profile, it was very nice and it had all those fruity hop flavors that I love. What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, there isn't anything that I disliked or would change, it's fine just the way it is. I would buy another bottle of this before it's all gone, but I don't think I'll be clearing the shelfs of it especially for $11.49. I would recommend this beer to anyone who likes hoppy Lagers or just hoppy beers a general, I think it's pretty much a must try for all Hop Heads. All in all I was pretty happy with this beer, I was expecting good things since this is a Founders Backstage Release and they delivered a very nice and hoppy Lager. So far I think this is the best hoppy Lager I've had and it's for sure the best Lager of the summer, but it isn't a favorite Founders beer. Great job guys, I really like how the only thing that I can always expect from this series it that's it's going to be a great and unique beer and that's exactly what it was, keep up the hard work guys."
""
"O) Really enjoyed this beer. I would love to see this become a seasonal release. Delicious..."
"Bottle from Gator Bev. Pours beautiful clear golden with a one finger white head. Aroma is...pretty much just like Double Trouble. Lots of grapefruit, pineapple, citrus rinds, a bit of mango, some pale malt sweetness. Flavor is strong citrus and tropical pineapple, a bitter pine finish, and some definite caramel malt presence. Finishes less crisp than a pale ale, and longer smooth lager yeast notes if you try hard to find them. Medium plus bodied with medium plus carbonation. This is good, but really just a very solid DIPA with what seems to be a bit more malt heft."
""
""
"Pours a slightly hazy deep straw color with a huge tightly bubbled white head that shows moderate retention and some sticky lace. Aromas of sour pink grapefruit some pine and resin with a hint of menthol and mint. Very faint crackery malt deep underneath. The flavor is intense sour grapefruit with hints of pine resin and earth. Still very faint malt deep underneath. Medium body with moderate carbonation. Intensely bitter but I couldn't stop drinking it. The hops are a bit of an odd combination and at first I was a little put off, but about half a glass in I was drinking this like a champ."
""
"Overall - Big hoppy lager pulled off pretty well, almost reminded me of Southern Tier Unearthly in lager form. The sweetness was a bit much to start but it eventually came together nicely. Glad they went for a different route for this style than Jack's Abby."
"Three of us tried a bomber of Dissenter this weekend and none of was impressed with it overall. We decided that we have been spoiled by Fiddlehead Second Fiddle and that every IPA from here on out is going to be disappointing. Normally we consider Founder's to be among the top brewers in the Country. We still do, however Dissenter was not one of their best products. We would can it. No pun intended."

"Bold and bitter citrus/pine hops, smells and tastes like a double IPA, but drinks like a session ale. Very crushable on a hot summer day. Light body with a crisp, bubbly finish. I laugh at those who balked at the idea of Founders making a lager, because they nailed it with this one."
""

""

"Its building bitterness is unrelenting as the hops grip the throat tightly and refuses to release. Gaining bitterness sip after sip, its grassy, herbal and woodish spices tighten their grip, weaving in citrus piths, leaf and grass along the way- en route to a piquant alcohol warmth that's indicative of its high strength. Its mild astringency is unavoidable with not malt taste or texture to buffer out the hop and alcohol rougher edges."
