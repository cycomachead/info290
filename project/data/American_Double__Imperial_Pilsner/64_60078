I was a little worried it would be too hoppy due to the label saying ""continuosly hopped"". However I was pleasantly surprised by this beer. The hop taste was quite mild, and there was an interesting and unexpected grape flavor to the beer. This beer was good enough that I would consider buying it again.","mchegash","Mar 22, 2015"

My only dis on this is that it came across a touch hot in a medicinal kind of way, but that taste sunk in after the initial hop bittered grain taste. I was attracted to this beer after reading My Antonia, which I was turned onto after eating kolaches while in a Texan town strong in Czech influence.","gopens44","Feb 02, 2015"

4,0.3,,,,,,"	Every other beer I've reviewed so far having been an ale, I felt it fitting when I finally got around to a Dogfish beer, that I'd choose their ""lagerific"" brew - as they put it... Pouring a orangeish/gold color, it quickly formed a 2.5 inch head made entirely of large bubbles that dissipated moderately quickly... It left behind a decent amount of lacing as the aroma of earthy/spicy hops rose from the hazy brew... On the nose is the drier malts integrated with the earthy hops, as well as a fair amount of green apple and traces of citrus hidden in there also... Upon tasting it, a spicy, yet still somewhat mellow bitterness hits your tongue, with the pilsner malt coming through on the second ""wave..."" It finishes strong in it's dry malty flavor, but the apples make a small cameo, popping up in the background from time to time as the beer makes a curtain call... The mouthfeel is actually fantastic, as it serves as a good balance to the style and serves as a good platform to host the flavors!! Overall I'm pleased to have indulged in trying this brew from Dogfish, as it is far from what was expected... I'm not the biggest fan of lagers, so this was slightly out of my comfort zone when I decided to try this beer, but I'm glad I proceeded with the gameplan as it worked out swimmingly... This brew was composed of enough ""old-school"" back bone to be able to host and compliment the ""new-school"" funk Dogfish head loves to apply to their concoctions!! Another good brew - Cheers!!","NSXAG","Nov 19, 2014"

The flavor falls a bit short, probably a result of being rather old.  There is a subtle bitterness which counters the sweet peachy notes.  There are other fruity flavors as well like bitter orange and maybe pears as well.  The mouthfeel is quite nice.  There is a nice light crispness to this beer.  Overall, I like this beer.

The smell is of sweet light malts and a ton of floral hops really quite different. The taste is much like the smell with nice sweetness and light bready malt. The hop character comes next with an assertive bitterness, not as much as an IPA as it is still well within balance of the malt. The bitterness is followed by aggressive hop flavor again all floral, grassy and peppery. Carbonation is relatively high and the finish on this one is a bit sweet a little slick and perhaps a touch of fleeting tingly bitterness just at the end. Overall this is good but not as good as I had hoped I understand that the hops are meant to be more European and floral but that leaves them seeming flat and a bit one dimensional. It is also a bit strange to have something as sweet as this is considering the style. In the end interesting but it may need a bit more work.","fank2788","May 09, 2014"

Half the beer ended up on the counter and floor. Once I finally got a good pour it was a hazy Golden color with a huge thick white head. There had to have been some active yeast bottled with this otherwise I cant describe the beers reaction to stimulation. The nose is funky; think saison funk. Lots of malt and sour/sweet European yeasty aromas. The flavor is marvelous and nothing what I expected. It is sour and funky. Not the hoppy palate spoken of on the label. It is sweet and malty on the front with a sour and slightly off taste following (when I say off taste I only mean it in the best of ways). I have no idea if this was DFH original intention of the beer or just a result of being bottled in 2012, but it has turned into a damn good, damn funky biiig beer.","lochef81","Feb 25, 2014"

4.1,2.8,4,4,4,4,4.5,"750 ml bottle into signature tulip glass, bottled in 2012 C. Pours moderately hazy golden amber color with a 2 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of pear, apple, lemon zest, orange zest, grape, biscuit, cracker, toast, floral, grass, honey, pepper, light pine, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance of hop, malt, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of pear, apple, lemon zest, orange zest, grape, biscuit, toast, cracker, light honey, floral, grass, light pine, pepper, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, light fruits, biscuit, toast, cracker, light honey, floral, grass, light pine, pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of hop, malt, and yeast flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a lightly creamy, smooth, and fairly crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent imperial pilsner style. All around great balance and complexity of hop, malt, and fruity yeast flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 14, 2013"

Doesn't smell nearly as hoppy as I would have thought from the ""continually hopped imperial pils"" caption on the front of the label. Flavor is mellow, only slightly grainy, and while not all that crisp on an absolute scale (it's supposed to be pilsner...), it's quite crisp considering how heavy it is. Overall it's pretty good, but not that special. I can't get past that fast that it basically tastes like a golden ale, and bears only a passing resembles to the beer I thought I was buying. Dogfish has apparently brewed quite a few imperial pilsners over the years, and I'm really wonderig how this would compare to Golden Shower (or Era, if you must be revisionist about it).","hreb","Aug 01, 2013"

I wish they used M/Y dating. Overall thought this is a quite nice beer from DFH. I bet it is much better fresh with more of a hop profile (hopefully), but it holds up over a year. At least here in MD around me this one is hard to find fresh. Also, this is one of the cheaper DFH 750s ($8-12).

This may have been a good jump into the pilsner game for me as it seems to be a bridge between a true pils and something more intense like an IPA. It pours an interesting cloudy off yellow with a huge fluffy white head that is glued to the side of the glass. Smells of fresh hops, lemon and grapefruit. Hints of yeast and spice. Wonderful aroma. Flavor is not at all what I expected. Hops, pine, lemon, touch of honey and some bread at the end. Flavor is well balanced and not in your face like some imperials can be. Mouthfeel is very light and refreshing. Great summer beer. Overall, I really love this beer, definitely my new favorite pilsner.","Samuel906","Apr 10, 2013"

3.12,-21.8,3,3.5,3,3,3,"Served from bottle into a Dogfish Head snifter (proper!). Poured a golden yellow-orange with a three finger white head that subsided to a half finger very slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wheat, grain, spice, pepper, bubblegum, and alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, bubblegum, grain, wheat, floral, spice, pepper, and alcohol. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty average brew. Nothing really stood out on this one for with the exception of the alcohol if I am honest. This made the enjoyable aspects of this one really lost in the booze going on. This was a bottle with some decent age on it so I would have expected the alcohol to be completely gone, but alas, there it was glaring back at me. Glad I got to try this one finally and get it out of my cellar, but I doubt I would do so again.","thagr81us","Dec 31, 2012"

Smells of citrus and caramel on top of bready grainy malt. Bits of grapefruit and lemons meld with the sweet grainy and bready aromas usually associated with a lager. The flavor is sweet with bready and caramel malts with some grapefruit and a lot of lemon from the hops. There's a touch of spice and a bit of earth and a fair amount of bitter hop bite that lingers long after every sip. Medium body with a semi dry finish, a moderate to high level of carbonation and a sweet almost syrupy mouthfeel. Decent beer, probably not something I would buy again, but I'm glad I got to try it.","johnnnniee","Dec 01, 2012"

The nose hit includes deep maple malt and nutty red grapes with some wheat wine ideas. Very nice. And thankfully the taste follows suit! Wow. Again, somewhat like a wheat wine brew in my book. Pleasant fruit sweetness blended expertly with nutty grain. A medium bodied beer with a pretty viscous feel, slightly cloying but not a problem. Delicate carbonation and smooth going down for an imperial. Delicious.","Durge","Sep 12, 2012"

The flavor profile is vastly different as well. There is much more tang and citrus on this, and I just want to say that the word ""clogged"" comes to mind. Perhaps congested would be more appropriate as there seems to be too much going on and piled together, leaving little room for the beer to speak subtly at all. And yes, I realize this is DFH and subtle would never be a word associated with the brewery. But I am comparing this version against the Borgo version. Overall, judged to style, I'll say that this is ""okay."" A bit too vibrant for me.

Solid blast of herbal and citric hops - black pepper, lemon pith, mint, grass. Sweeter than expected with some sugar cookie and raw dough. A tad yeasty. Definitely one of the better takes on this style, but the sweetness is too much for more than about 12oz and some dryness would really help bring out the pilsner qualities of the beer.","bump8628","Jun 15, 2012"

Mouthfeel is thick, and the hops are bitter , and yet sweetness is slight,but the bitter isn't bad, You can taste that they used some quality hops in this brew. I wouldn't reccomend to someone who's used to lighter pilsners due to the fact this flavor is so intense it might turn off a possible convert.But if you're looking for a pilsner thats gonna give you some bang for you buck, this isn't bad.","Barnabas","Apr 23, 2012"

I really can't put the aroma into words, other than to say that it smells like it's going to taste crisp and delicious. And it does! There's a slightly bitter, strong alcohol bite that follows the crisp pilsner taste. A little bit of tangy citrus there as well. This is the only imperial pilsner I've had, so I have nothing to compare it to. Even so, it's a great beer, for sure.","DrStiffington","Apr 01, 2012"

Any how this beer is fairly lite in flavor and really has no bold side and I would say the only thing that really leaps out at your palate at any given point in a sip is a sweet brief citrusy moment that is soon followed by a quick finish.","Remydakine","Feb 21, 2012"

Aroma is fantastic with pronounced floral and fruity aspects - lemon, pineapple, grapefruit, apricot, as well as sugary caramel all in there. Tastes great, much like the aroma, and has a deep malt backbone as well, with a pleasant smack of hoppy bitterness. Coats the mouth nicely with a warming sensation going down. Lots of lacing on the glass. Overall, I have only had a few 'imperial pilsners' but this one stacks up quite well and also is the archetype of the BA description for the style.

I appreciate what the brewers were trying to do but it's got just a bit too much going on and the elements don't all mesh well for me.

The taste of this brew was semi sweet, full of malted grain and had a nice bitter hoppy citrus flavor. Full body, dry finish.

It finishes slightly dry but nothing like an IPA. Lemon and grass are the most dominant flavors. Remarkably refreshing and easy to drink. This is a beer I wish DFH would sell in 6 packs. Overall, fantastic brew. This is not complex, this is not unique, and this is not the best beer I have ever had. But this is surely the most refreshing and best tasting pilsner I have tried to date.

Moderate signs of carbonation throughout the body of the brew. The nose is clean, with toasted oats and a smooth hops presence. The flavor is a smokey-toasted cereal characteristic initially, with a mild lacing of peppered hops. The beer has a creamy feel, and it leaves a considerable lacing along the flass while you drink. The aftertaste is all hops, with a smooth, and slightly bitter finish. Very tasty.","GarthDanielson","Aug 09, 2011"

4,0.3,4,4,4,4,4,"This beer lends credence to my growing belief that, if you crank up the ABV and toss in loads of hops, you can pretty much pave right over any ability to distinguish between an ale and a pilsner. Here we have a tasty beer, bright carbonation, assertive but not overpowering hops with some citrus notes. Body is a bit on the lighter side, as befits a pilsner, but, then again, it could pass for a light-bodied ale. Alchohol lends a bit of pepper at the finish, with just a little rawness.","Brent","Jul 20, 2011"
4,0.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Got to try this one at the 2010 ACBF. The beer poured out as a nice golden color with a strong looking white head on top. The smell of citrus and grains come through on the nose, very pleasant aroma. The taste of the beer is nothing like a typical pilsner, I was hoping it'd be something a little over the top and it was thankfully. It had mostly citrus fruit notes, lots of hops also. The mouthfeel of this beer is smooth and very drinkable. Might be a bit of a dangerous beer to drink a lot of. Overall I really enjoyed this one. I'd like to have it again one day.","Knapp85","Jul 20, 2011"

Earthy and musty at first but soon some lemony citrus cuts through. A lot of sweet Pilsner malt is present. Flavor is very sweet but with a huge lemon hop character that transitions to earthy/hay then piney bitter on the finish. Has the mouthfeel of an imperial IPA along with the hop character but the malt is obviously lighter from using Pilsner. This was an interesting mix of hop flavors put together over such a light but thick body. Interesting to try this one time.","DrinkingDrake","Jul 04, 2011"

4,0.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Probably more akin to an IPA than a pilsner, the malt profile is crisp, clean, large, and on one side of the field; whereas the American/European hop flavors are on the other side battling for dominance. A good beer throughout, but there seems to be an offset in balance and contrast in identity- kinda schizophrenic.","BEERchitect","Jul 01, 2011"

Smell is that of grapefruit, pine nut, lemon peel, malt, black pepper, and roasted wheat. Taste is to almost steal for more, with lots and lots of hops in the forefront as the taste of pink grapefruit and lemon peel there also flavors of black pepper, wheat, weak coffee, sweetness of orange, and malt. Mouthfeel is full and creamy, with a crispness in the front and a slight drying in the back. Good beer, wonderful hop flavor, and the buzz is just a fabulous wave of buzz.

This beer smells mild,low levels of hoppy citrus and pine are noticeable. There are also aromas of sweet malt and a mild grassiness.

There was a lemon twist taste in the finish, and some alcohol warmth after each sip. Not exactly a quenching beer, but the complex profile, and creamy mouthfeel made me want to keep drinking.

Suggestions of lemon, grass and green hop in the nose and taste. Very smooth on the palate, crisp and also belgianesque in its carbonation. A touch of hop, this ale tastes like a big clean pils, does not taste like a euro style pils, distinctly American despite the origins and name. Good feel and overall interesting and well made. A successful beer and would love to have again.","Stinkypuss","Mar 27, 2011"

3.76,-5.8,4,3,4,4,4," This beer pours a slightly hazy, bright gold color. A pretty epic amount of bright, white head retains its shape quite well. Not much in the aroma department. Hints of copper and a slight hint of hops. A nice clean front; crisp with just a bit of honey. The finish is dry with a very, very minimal hop presence (but it's there is you look for it). These guys continue to be one of my favorite breweries ever. This, while not anything totally out of the box, is still a super delicious beer that is worth trying at least once.","shodrod","Mar 26, 2011"
4.23,6,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Quite well-balanced, with an alcohol level that is hidden very well (until it sneaks up on you, of course). A bit heavier and more pungent than a regular Pils, such is to be expected from an ""Imperialized"" version of the style, and this one pulls it off very well, taking all of the bits of a good Pilsner and extrapolating upon them. Subtlety is not its main suit, but toned down, subtlety would be the name of the game -- this is definitely a top-notch example of what it means for an American brewery to take a classic staple and give it a bigger, bolder flair.","superdedooperboy","Mar 25, 2011"

Taste is firm, and very dry from a dominant profile of hops. Quite bitter, and not the softer, easy-drinking grain flavors that one might expect in a pilsner. It is pleasant to drink but bone dry. Given the one-dimensional and bitter flavor profile, I think it would be better matched with some ripe cheese and fruit, rather than as a stand-alone.","malloyca","Mar 07, 2011"

It's covered up so well and you don't that typical beery alcohol yeasty taste you'd get from most lower quality pilsners.

Rather than Hallertau hops this has plenty of Saaz style spiciness, also some juicy citrus that I associate more with American IPAs. It tastes very nice, not really a refined pils but rather more of an agressive IPA. Lasting bitterness in the aftertaste but it's a flavorful bitterness so I like it.

There is a mild level of fruitiness and toasted elements in the flavor with hints of floral noble hop tinges throughout. I almost get a sweet golden delicious aspsect from the pils near the finish which is probably yeast derived. I find this to be a wonderful Imperial Pils -a beer I would drink daily if given the chance. It is not boring to me, very flavorful and it fits the style well.

Aroma is bready malt along with some grassy, spicy and citrusy hops. I think the brew tastes similar to the aroma, but with the addition of a bit of peppery spice. Also, I think the grassy hop and bready malt flavors are the strongest. There's also a good slightly bitter hoppy finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a little bit creamy and has good carbonation.

It's pilsnery with a bright white billowy head that's a inch up with staying power, and sticking power as well. Smell is str8 forward, pilsner malt blasting out the ying yang, knowing dogfish, they used a ton of this variety and it shows in smell and taste. Some tropics and bubblegum as well. This tastes a lot better than many imy pilz out there, they just don't cut the mustard, Antonia gets the job done while remaining in style with a big back. Tastes include pilsner malt up front, light fruits, a nice faint earthy hopping with some tropics (this bottle is about 5 months old at this point). I like how the hay I get in alot of pilsners is muted here. The feel is a nice medium, greatly carbed and lively on the tounge, kinda bitey, not killer though. Gotta knock some points on drinkability as I cant gulp this like a lighter pilsner, It's not a knock on the beer, it tastes good, but not as easy going as most in style. A case purchase would be ideal, if it came in 12oz'ers. I like DFH better when the beer is under 10%, beyond that, things get fishy.","BARFLYB","Jan 04, 2011"

A pilsener with American hops isn't really a pilsener at all. The pilsener malt base is shattered by the amped up bitterness, and at the end of the day I'd feel a lot more comfortable calling this some flavor of IPA. I haven't rated it lower for that reason. Maybe it's a double pils for hopheads who don't love pilseners. I do love pilseners, and hops as well, but I don't think this particular marriage quite works.

Aromatics first address my nares with grapefruit/citric rinds, herbal/grassy qualities and a touch of booze reaching my senses. Overall an intense hoppiness is brewing even before I taste it. Flavor is abrasively bitter initially as it warms up and the malts open up a bit the pilsner malt adds enough sweetness to dance around a bit with the malts. True perfect balance between malts and hops never occurs this is a hop odyssey, continuously hopped imperial pils. Grapefruit/bitter rinds, herbal grassiness big booze and sugary malts hit altogether on the palate with no real direction. A lot of big hitters show up with no clear leader to choreograph what happens on the palate. Overall mouthfeel is big a bit heavy, carbonation is kicking. Super bitterness with a wave of booze and malt bringing the finish amongs the big hop bomb of a beer this is. Is it the West Coast hop additions that make this beer pretty hard to handle, I like west coast hops but I'm not sure about them in a pilsner malt profile. Drinkability takes some getting used to, it grew on me as I sipped and temperature change had a big effect on my overall opinion of this offering. Under attenuated the yeast didn't fully perform here, a pils that finishes this sweet didn't ferment out all the way, I'm glad they didn't dump this one. Experimental style I've been drinking their different versions of this from Prescription Pils, to Golden Shower, to Golden Era, back around to the collaboration with the Italian brewer that brings us this bottled release My Antonia is better than earlier attempts at an Impy Pils, but keep striving for perfection because we're not there yet, at least in this newly bottled big bottle release.","WVbeergeek","Dec 20, 2010"

Grapefruit and other citrus hops in the nose here, coming off potent but clean at the same time. I also get some prickly pear and cucumber as well. More of the same from the taste. It would have been easy to just make this a hop bomb of a Pilsner, but instead they made something that is well hopped, but balanced and drinkable. The body is right there in the middle, not too big and not too small for an imperial version of this style. Having had their other big Pils beers, (Golden Shower/Era) this one stands alone as my favorite. DFH is known for going over the top with their brews.

Hops are very present, they begun with a slight tropical edge and were followed by a smooth transition into the bittering hops which left hop resin on the palate; it was well balanced by the malts. The carbonation levels were decent.

The smell is mostly malty with a bit of herbal and woody noble hop. The taste is sweet and thick with a good dose of bittering. The mouthfeel is thick from the ample amounts of dextrin malt flavor.

It's not one that I'm going to use to slake my thirst and also a beer that see me open a second in the same sitting.

Aroma is mildly boring blend a pale malts, green apples, faint hops and lingering booze. Flavor starts initially overly sweet, witha strong malt body and ripe fruit flavors before the dry, exceptionally hoppy finish. The finish is lacking any dryness or crispness associated with the style and has an unpleasantly strong alcohol burn. The mouthfeel starts extremely thick and almost syrupy before some mild carbonation settles in with the bitterness from hops.

Thick white head that dissipated quickly, but throughout the beer a thin white head lasted. The ale appears hazy at first and becomes clear later in the glass, pretty unusual. Has a very nice color, very golden. Smelled just like it tasted, like a super hoppy pilsner. Smells like fresh hops, citrus and some grass. Tastes like a prime example of a pilsner, with a huge load of hops dumped in(dry hopped or continuously hopped?). I'm not a huge fan of pilsners but I liked the Sam Adams Imperial Pilsner, so I gave this a shot since I trust DFH with any style of beer. Well they didn't let me down. I really enjoyed this beer. It's just not something I will seek out or miss that I can't get. It a really good example of the style though. Hides the fact that it is 7.5% very well. This is a very drinkable beer, The hops are definitely the star in this brew, but don't over dominate the taste. It's kind of like a stepping stone for people wanting to warm up to IPA's.

Light and balanced with a generous amount of crystal malt to hold up to the heavy handed hoppy bite which is mid to late palate.

It ain't much to look at, but, then again, most pilsners aren't. The nose comprises plenty o' hops, a slight tinniness, and wheat. The taste holds notes of light wheat, a very light tin (that ol' pils taste...maybe it's just me?), and plenty o' hoppy bitterness.

Bright orange color, deep enough to have a light bronzed look, transparent with widely spread, if fast moving, bubbles within. Noticeably sweet nose emphasizing tangerine and pink grapefruit citrus, buttressed by peach, apricot fruit, pine cone and fresh rose petals, hardly any bready or doughy notes, slightly more wheat or simple grain, if you think about it being labeled a pilsner you can kind of see it but if someone just handed you a glass of it, pilsner would unlikely be the guess. Medium-bodied, the carbonation is light with a slow churn which keeps the liquid sticky and pressing down on the palate. More general maltiness here, same for pretzel dough and wheat. Yet, still insufficient to match up with all that sweet orange, tangerine, pink grapefruit citrus as well as golden honey notes. Robust apricot, peach, nectarine fruit with a slice of pineapple. Big florality, pretty and matches the creaminess of the overall mouth feel.

Each sip demanded attention, such were the tastes. Creamy mouthfeel, more than I'd expect from a pilsener. I must admit the Imperial Pilsener is new to me.

I was a bit disappointed in the aroma as it seemed much more subdued than I remember the original being, lacking the complex, herbal hop notes, though it does have the same sweet, rich malt character. Since the aroma was not as good as the original, I was worried that the flavor might disappoint as well, but it was not so. The rich, doughy malt was still present and the hops came to life much more than they managed to in the aroma. The pithy, juicy grapefruit notes that I recalled from last December were all there along with a herbal juniper note and balancing honey malt. While this batch may lack a little of the depth of aroma that the previous one exhibited, it is still an unusually delicious beer and certainly up there with Sam Adams Hallertau Imperial Pilsner as a fantastic example of this often poorly interpreted style.","nickfl","Jul 29, 2010"

4.47,12,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"It's VERY much like an IPA but its not. It's it's own tasty creation, and one that I'll have to try and brew on my own it's so good.","Pinto21","Jul 19, 2010"
4.05,1.5,4,4,4,4.5,4,"750mL bottle into a Duvel tulip pours a crisp light orange with a nice frothy off-white head that lasts as a thin layer and leaves nice lacing on the glass. Aroma is citrus hops just in front of sweet malts, quite fragrant. The taste is an interesting malt profile with a nice hop kick to it, there is a nice subtle lingering bitter hop finish. The beer is medium bodied and smooth and well carbonated. This is another great, unique brew from Dogfish Head.","atsprings","Jul 17, 2010"
4.33,8.5,4.5,4,4,5,5,"Note: this is the 2010 release brewed by Dogfish Head in Delaware, not the 2008 Birra del Borgo-DFH collaboration brewed in Italy. I'd imagine the two are very similar beers, if not the same recipe. But, they should be separate listings because they are brewed at two entirely different locations.","dasenebler","Jul 14, 2010"
