"O: A crisp, smooth, well balanced double pilsner."
"Produces a nice, long lasting foamy head. Rustic, grape smell. Tastes of citrus and hops. Smooth finish. Great overall beer, different than most pilsner's that I've had. Very nice."
""
"I have little experience with Pilsners is general, and so I didn't really know what to expect from this beer. I was a little worried it would be too hoppy due to the label saying ""continuosly hopped"". However I was pleasantly surprised by this beer. The hop taste was quite mild, and there was an interesting and unexpected grape flavor to the beer. This beer was good enough that I would consider buying it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I typically don't go for pilsners, but was willing to give this one a try due to it being an imperial.  For me, it started off good, but something in the finish didn't sit well on my palette.  I found this beer to be drinkable, but not enjoyable."

"Taken from notes, as I had this one a few months back. Generally I enjoy double Pilsners and this one was no exception. My only dis on this is that it came across a touch hot in a medicinal kind of way, but that taste sunk in after the initial hop bittered grain taste. I was attracted to this beer after reading My Antonia, which I was turned onto after eating kolaches while in a Texan town strong in Czech influence."

"Taste seemed off with the bottle I had. Not a fan personally of this one."
""
""
""
""
"It's a very clean double pilsner. I enjoyed this beer a lot. Crisp, bubbly and tasty! Would buy again, for sure."
""
"This had the most dominating creamy foam that stuck around each pour that I can ever recall.  I'd recommend this to any imperial pilsner fan, even though the Italian version of this beer collaboration was somehow superior, as my memory recalls."

"	Every other beer I've reviewed so far having been an ale, I felt it fitting when I finally got around to a Dogfish beer, that I'd choose their ""lagerific"" brew - as they put it... Pouring a orangeish/gold color, it quickly formed a 2.5 inch head made entirely of large bubbles that dissipated moderately quickly... It left behind a decent amount of lacing as the aroma of earthy/spicy hops rose from the hazy brew... On the nose is the drier malts integrated with the earthy hops, as well as a fair amount of green apple and traces of citrus hidden in there also... Upon tasting it, a spicy, yet still somewhat mellow bitterness hits your tongue, with the pilsner malt coming through on the second ""wave..."" It finishes strong in it's dry malty flavor, but the apples make a small cameo, popping up in the background from time to time as the beer makes a curtain call... The mouthfeel is actually fantastic, as it serves as a good balance to the style and serves as a good platform to host the flavors!! Overall I'm pleased to have indulged in trying this brew from Dogfish, as it is far from what was expected... I'm not the biggest fan of lagers, so this was slightly out of my comfort zone when I decided to try this beer, but I'm glad I proceeded with the gameplan as it worked out swimmingly... This brew was composed of enough ""old-school"" back bone to be able to host and compliment the ""new-school"" funk Dogfish head loves to apply to their concoctions!! Another good brew - Cheers!!"

"Pours up a hazy golden color with a white head.  The aroma is of honey and fruit with hints of biscuit.  The flavor falls a bit short, probably a result of being rather old.  There is a subtle bitterness which counters the sweet peachy notes.  There are other fruity flavors as well like bitter orange and maybe pears as well.  The mouthfeel is quite nice.  There is a nice light crispness to this beer.  Overall, I like this beer.  It is crisp and refreshing.  I need to try a fresher bottle to compare."

"I do not really know what to make of this. I expected a Pilsener but it is way too sweet for that. I think it is overly hopped but the hops are nice. It does not have the refreshing sharpness of a lager but it is smooth. The suspended yeast would make it a Zwickl still it is more an IPA than a lager. Do I like it? I am not even sure about that."

"The lime notes I picked up on the nose seem to disappear in the taste. Instead, I pick up an adequate combination of grain, barley malts, roasted malts, sweetness, and a played down hop finale. Dry finish. It does not fail to satisfy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very clear pale gold in color with an off white head that starts out thick and just never goes away. The smell is of sweet light malts and a ton of floral hops really quite different. The taste is much like the smell with nice sweetness and light bready malt. The hop character comes next with an assertive bitterness, not as much as an IPA as it is still well within balance of the malt. The bitterness is followed by aggressive hop flavor again all floral, grassy and peppery. Carbonation is relatively high and the finish on this one is a bit sweet a little slick and perhaps a touch of fleeting tingly bitterness just at the end. Overall this is good but not as good as I had hoped I understand that the hops are meant to be more European and floral but that leaves them seeming flat and a bit one dimensional. It is also a bit strange to have something as sweet as this is considering the style. In the end interesting but it may need a bit more work."

"Overall: This was my first Imperial Pilsner and it did not disappoint. While it is fairly light, it does leave a profoundly refreshing aftertaste on your palate. Enjoy!"

"This has been sitting in my cellar for over a year now and I think its time to pop it open. To begin with, it almost explodes with white foam. Half the beer ended up on the counter and floor. Once I finally got a good pour it was a hazy Golden color with a huge thick white head. There had to have been some active yeast bottled with this otherwise I cant describe the beers reaction to stimulation. The nose is funky; think saison funk. Lots of malt and sour/sweet European yeasty aromas. The flavor is marvelous and nothing what I expected. It is sour and funky. Not the hoppy palate spoken of on the label. It is sweet and malty on the front with a sour and slightly off taste following (when I say off taste I only mean it in the best of ways). I have no idea if this was DFH original intention of the beer or just a result of being bottled in 2012, but it has turned into a damn good, damn funky biiig beer."
""
"O: At first I was a a bit disappointed. by the time I had worked through the bottle midway, my mind had changed. It is a very tasty beer that I wouldn't mind having again."
""
""
"Overall, I do feel that My Antonia is just a lesser form of the 60 Minute, which I would take any day over this brew."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a good beer for a hot day. The flavors are mild and the focus seems to be on carbonation and balance. As the label states, this is a different type of beer for Dogfish Head. I am glad I tried it."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Pretty enjoyable beer given the date on the bottle. Wish I could have tried the Italian version."

"It doesn't have the smoothness of a pilsner. It's a bit raw. ""Interesting"" and unique. It's a strong, hoppy pilsner that just doesn't come together well, for me."

"Outstanding beer, far better than I expected. Would drink it again."
"750 ml bottle into signature tulip glass, bottled in 2012 C. Pours moderately hazy golden amber color with a 2 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of pear, apple, lemon zest, orange zest, grape, biscuit, cracker, toast, floral, grass, honey, pepper, light pine, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance of hop, malt, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of pear, apple, lemon zest, orange zest, grape, biscuit, toast, cracker, light honey, floral, grass, light pine, pepper, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, light fruits, biscuit, toast, cracker, light honey, floral, grass, light pine, pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of hop, malt, and yeast flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a lightly creamy, smooth, and fairly crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent imperial pilsner style. All around great balance and complexity of hop, malt, and fruity yeast flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on. A very enjoyable offering."

"750mL bottle served in a tumbler. Beer is yellow and loaded with big soda bubbles. Oh, and it's got a lot of head. Bottle shows a surprising layer of sediment. Doesn't smell nearly as hoppy as I would have thought from the ""continually hopped imperial pils"" caption on the front of the label. Flavor is mellow, only slightly grainy, and while not all that crisp on an absolute scale (it's supposed to be pilsner...), it's quite crisp considering how heavy it is. Overall it's pretty good, but not that special. I can't get past that fast that it basically tastes like a golden ale, and bears only a passing resembles to the beer I thought I was buying. Dogfish has apparently brewed quite a few imperial pilsners over the years, and I'm really wonderig how this would compare to Golden Shower (or Era, if you must be revisionist about it)."

"O: Delicious! one of my favorite IPLs. easy to drink with perfect balance between that classic pilsner malt and hops. /92"

"O-Likable beer, not one of my favorites, once I down the bottle, I may update, or pass out..."
""
"An awesome American Imperial Pilsner. Who wouldn't enjoy this beer? I couldn't say, for sure."
""
""
""
"Absolutely recommend."
"This creation is fine, and certainly has more character on account of the continuous hopping. In a summer of thirst, though, I don't feel the need to return. All the interesting elements suggest it could be a pioneer, but it's missing an inspired (woman's?) touch to settle them together."

"I found this beer, a collaboration by great brewers whilst in Italy, to be a world classic. I wish it was in steady supply. A new favorite of mine. I wish it came in cans too. Beautiful with food, beautiful in summer. Hop heads and as well as all craft fans must try this original pilsner."

"O: I like it. Considering the commercial pilsner garbage that is sold in the states, this is a great change of pace. I don't seem to have many craft pilsners sold in my area so it was finally nice to try one. A great summery beer to have. A whole bomber could go down very easy on a nice day."
""
""
""
""
"Overall tasty and interesting, a good choice for introduction to this beer style."
""
""
""
""
"O - Nothing special but it's a well done pilsner."
"O- It may be unfair for me to rate a Pils because I only drink IPA these days, but this heavily-hopped offering from DFH is a great transition for me. I had it on tap (cask) a few months ago and I loved it. This bottle reaffirms that love. Good show. Not an IPA, but a great beverage overall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is my first pilsner and thus my first double pilsner. I had wanted to get a 2013 bottle, but instead I had to settle for a cheap 2012 bottle. I wish they used M/Y dating. Overall thought this is a quite nice beer from DFH. I bet it is much better fresh with more of a hop profile (hopefully), but it holds up over a year. At least here in MD around me this one is hard to find fresh. Also, this is one of the cheaper DFH 750s ($8-12). I don't know but I feel as if this one might benefit from being a core beer."
""
"Despite pilsners typically being my least favorite style of beer, I love Dogfish Head so much i decided to give My Antonia a try. This may have been a good jump into the pilsner game for me as it seems to be a bridge between a true pils and something more intense like an IPA. It pours an interesting cloudy off yellow with a huge fluffy white head that is glued to the side of the glass. Smells of fresh hops, lemon and grapefruit. Hints of yeast and spice. Wonderful aroma. Flavor is not at all what I expected. Hops, pine, lemon, touch of honey and some bread at the end. Flavor is well balanced and not in your face like some imperials can be. Mouthfeel is very light and refreshing. Great summer beer. Overall, I really love this beer, definitely my new favorite pilsner."
""
"O: quite a nice lager"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: a very tasty beer, a bit simple but such is the style and this one is clean and refreshing with a solid dose of hop flavor"
""
""
"Slightly more orange in color than a typical pale lager, with the most incredible floral hop aroma and delicate, refined taste. I guess this one qualifies as imperial pilsner due to comparatively high alcohol content. Certainly a lager brewed right. Enthusiastically recommended!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not bad, but they certainly didn't ""nail it"" either. I know that Dogfish Head is known for their experimental brews, but usually their label tells you when they are getting into the territory of eclectic tastes -- Maybe I was just expecting something truer to the style than this beer delivered."
"Drinkin this on the most beautiful day of 2013 so far. Pours up murky orange with big 'ol white frothy head. Aroma of big pale malts, lots of floral and some citrus hops. Lil bit of yeasty esters. Taste is hops up front. White pepper, lemon peel. Sweet pale malts. Full bodied. No hot alky taste. Nice medium carbo. I dig it, Sam"

"Served on tap at whole foods Schaumburg. Appearance is a bright brilliant gold with bone white head. Nice clarity and cascading bubbles, good head retention. The nose is malty with notes of toasted bread, grass, and some herbaceous qualities that I can't quite put my finger on. Earthy character on the finish. Taste features deep malts with notes of caramel, a hint of molasses, and some grassy hop character. Not getting a whole lot of hop bitterness on here, just a touch of earthy character. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated with a light body. Overall, pretty unique flavor, but it doesn't all add up to a totally enjoyable brew. Would pass next time around."
""
""
"O: not familiar enough with the style to comment on how well it meets style-expectations, but this was a very fresh, crisp, and also satisfying drink - great finish, feel, and flavor. A very drinkable beer. Probably great starter beer for people who are leery of ""weird""/craft beer, but know there's something better out there than Bud, Miller, Coors, et. al."
"Served from bottle into a Dogfish Head snifter (proper!). Poured a golden yellow-orange with a three finger white head that subsided to a half finger very slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wheat, grain, spice, pepper, bubblegum, and alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, bubblegum, grain, wheat, floral, spice, pepper, and alcohol. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty average brew. Nothing really stood out on this one for with the exception of the alcohol if I am honest. This made the enjoyable aspects of this one really lost in the booze going on. This was a bottle with some decent age on it so I would have expected the alcohol to be completely gone, but alas, there it was glaring back at me. Glad I got to try this one finally and get it out of my cellar, but I doubt I would do so again."

"Pours a slightly hazy medium golden color with a huge fluffy white head that filled more than a quarter of the glass and stalled my enjoyment of this brew. Smells of citrus and caramel on top of bready grainy malt. Bits of grapefruit and lemons meld with the sweet grainy and bready aromas usually associated with a lager. The flavor is sweet with bready and caramel malts with some grapefruit and a lot of lemon from the hops. There's a touch of spice and a bit of earth and a fair amount of bitter hop bite that lingers long after every sip. Medium body with a semi dry finish, a moderate to high level of carbonation and a sweet almost syrupy mouthfeel. Decent beer, probably not something I would buy again, but I'm glad I got to try it."

"My Antonia pours a darker copper color, with a nice sized lacing head. There is a bitter dry, floral aroma, much like an IPA. The taste has a nice crisp sweet citrus taste that then turns floral and bitter. Great full flavor, complex, I love the change on the palette, nice and dry too. Overall a very interesting beer, worth a try."
""
""
"M: Medium bodied and drinks easy with the carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pour is crystal clear lager yellow with a tight white head and nice lace. Nose is doughy and buttery up front with a blast of citrus and pine behind, very resinous. Taste is about the same with almost no bitterness. Almost like an IPA with the hop punch, body is light and creamy but very light carbonation with a burn of alochol in the finish."
""
""
"Overall: Definitely one of my all-time favorites here. The idea of mixing a Czech pilsener with West Coast hops is brilliant and really pays off in this beer. I can't recommend this one enough."

"O - I absolutely love this brew. It's such a great balance of sweetness, hops, citrus, grapefruits, a hardly a hint of the 7.5% abv, could drink this all day. Have had it before this review and will continue to look for it again in the future. Great job DFH on this brew."

"Smells great, looks a bit hazy for a pils. Mouthfeel is average for a pils. Taste is a bit disappointing as it has a strange bitterness to it that I have not experienced in a pils or an Imperial pils. About 2 fingers of head and I drank this out of a pilsner glass. Almost a weird chemical aftertaste. Not great not terrible. Very middle of the road-I was hoping for so much more. Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
"Enjoyed at the Fairfax brewpub this imperial pilsner is a very clear pale amber color with a decent white head and plenty of lacing. The nose hit includes deep maple malt and nutty red grapes with some wheat wine ideas. Very nice. And thankfully the taste follows suit! Wow. Again, somewhat like a wheat wine brew in my book. Pleasant fruit sweetness blended expertly with nutty grain. A medium bodied beer with a pretty viscous feel, slightly cloying but not a problem. Delicate carbonation and smooth going down for an imperial. Delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Light gold in color and definitely hazy towards the end of the bottle. Head is overbearing and often overflows the glass even after just a moderate pour. It does linger nicely once relaxing. The mouthfeel is great with a finer and frothy carbonation. Smells of a pilsner beer mixed with honey. Taste has a lot of sweetness - again honey - but the pilsner is hard to detect. Its still a good beer but have trouble putting it in a pilsner category."
"This beer is one that seems to have some highs and lows but overall is pretty solid. I just wouldn't buy it again at that price - around $12."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: An excellent beer that respects ""tradition"" but is somewhat unique at the same time. The combination of hops really works here. I don't normally spring for $10 bombers, but anyone who like a good pils should give this a try. Highly recommended."
""
""
"O - Different. Lots going on in this one, like a complicated film you have to watch a couple of times to pick it all up."
""
""
"Immediately, I can tell that this is going to be a different beer than the Borgo version. The nose is kind of an unusual citrus thing. The flavor profile is vastly different as well. There is much more tang and citrus on this, and I just want to say that the word ""clogged"" comes to mind. Perhaps congested would be more appropriate as there seems to be too much going on and piled together, leaving little room for the beer to speak subtly at all. And yes, I realize this is DFH and subtle would never be a word associated with the brewery. But I am comparing this version against the Borgo version. Overall, judged to style, I'll say that this is ""okay."" A bit too vibrant for me. The refined nature of the Borgo interpretation speaks to me in volumes, while this one seems more like a three line blurb on the 10th page of yesterdays newspaper."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: While I like a bit of crispness in a pilsner, that aspect is hard to find in an Imperial Pilsner, and this beer is no different; otherwise, it is a very good example of the style"
""
"O: This is a good beer for a hot day. The flavors are mild and the focus seems to be on carbonation and balance. As the label states, this is a different type of beer for Dogfish Head. I am glad I tried it. It is a good beer to serve chilled at a summer picnic."

"O: This beer is pretty easy to drink and the higher ABV is very well hidden. Not quite as good as the version from Birra Del Borgo but it is enjoyable and a much better value (considering it costs less and is a much larger bottle)."
"This was good, I just think I don't prefer the imperial pilsener for an imperial lager."
""
"O - Quite good, the only thing i dislike is the tartness which interrupts the otherwise ideal characteristics of this beer. Otherwise the flavor profile is ideal, its drinkable and enjoyable overall."
""
""
""
"Pours a cloudy golden color with a fair amount of head. Hops are a little more present on the nose, but the malty profile comes through on the tongue. It's definitely stronger than a regular ol' pilsener, but it's not out-of-this-world. It doesn't have to be, because that's not why we drink pilseners. This beer is still refreshing while also providing a little extra warmth."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O- Almost like a pilsner/pale ale/IPA hybrid. Not your typical pilsner, but very tasty and enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I wish I could find more pilsners like this one. I'm sure there are many German/Czech examples, but few fresh ones. This packs refreshment and complexity in one bottle and is one of my very favorite DFH beers."
""
""
""
"This was an excellent example of an American Imperial Pilsner. I am not much of a pilsner lover (generally prefer heavier beers) but this was a delight. My buddy and I really enjoyed this as a nice switch to the conventional American pilsner genre. A heavy, yet pleasing pilsner."

"On-tap at Star Bar in Denver (I love that place). This was a nice find. Hazed straw gold with a thick puff of white foam. Solid blast of herbal and citric hops - black pepper, lemon pith, mint, grass. Sweeter than expected with some sugar cookie and raw dough. A tad yeasty. Definitely one of the better takes on this style, but the sweetness is too much for more than about 12oz and some dryness would really help bring out the pilsner qualities of the beer."

"Overall: Although not a huge fan of the style, I really enjoyed this beer. I enjoy IPA's and other hop forward styles, so this beer is a no brainer for me."

"Overall this is extremely drinkable and quite refreshing, perfect for a warm Saturday evening. Didn't have any problems finishing the pint @ a rapid pace, even though I wanted to enjoy it, couldn't help myself."

"There is no real complexity however, which holds it back a little bit from being absolutely ideal, but still it's a strongly crafted brew with obvious quality, and I would certainly recommend it to any one who is a fan of hops or bold lager brews."

"O good pilsner. Dont usually appreciate a pils but has good amount of hops puts in another league with complexity."

"Overall: This is quite tame for Dogfish Head but I like it a lot. It's clean, crisp, and flavourful in a reserved kind of manner."
""

"I've tried some different examples of pilsners' in my time, and I must say, though dogfish head is able to make your mouth feel like it just got punched with flavor, this time around I dug the hit. Mouthfeel is thick, and the hops are bitter , and yet sweetness is slight,but the bitter isn't bad, You can taste that they used some quality hops in this brew. I wouldn't reccomend to someone who's used to lighter pilsners due to the fact this flavor is so intense it might turn off a possible convert.But if you're looking for a pilsner thats gonna give you some bang for you buck, this isn't bad."
"O: Def. an enjoyable DFH beer. Nice fruit flavors mixing with the floral hops flavor and ending with a crips bitterness. Overall another great beer."

"a crisp clear golden yellow pour with a perfect looking 2 fingers fluffy white head. smells hoppier than any pilsner i've ever had and am looking forward to tasting it! aromas of grass, bread, honey, orange. bitter sweet hoppy taste up front with slightly sweet malty backbone. the hops come back for the aftertaste and make their presence in this wonderful display of a pilsner. a nice light bodied beer with a crisp finish. i give this a high overall score because it makes me actually enjoy a pilsner. usually, they are lacking flavor and aroma but not this one! if it weren't for the fact that i haven't enjoyed any of the birra del borgo beers, i'd want to actually give their version of this a shot."

"Pours a clearish yellow body with mucho head that stays around forever and is very clingy/sticky. A strong pils malt aroma with some sweetness as well as a grainy, grassy hop aroma. Good clean pils taste - the igher than usual ABV doesn't deter from an easy drinking beer that is hoppy and grainy and has a good sweet edge to it. Simplitsic but very enjoyable beer this is easy to drink on a warm spring day."

"O: A really amazing, interesting beer that takes a totally fresh approach to the pilsener, adding tons of hops that give it a rich, layered flavor that's unlike anything else. It's very original and delicious."
"An intense yet enjoyable beer for the style. Bold and delightful. Nicely balanced between grains and hops for such a big beer. I'll hate to see this bottle gone, so I may pick up a few more bottles in the near future...gotta have more..."

"Review from 1/2011 notes. Poured into a Nostradamus flute glass. Pours a light orange amber. Moderate white head that lasted a little while; nice lacing. Aroma of citrus, light fruit and hops faint floral notes. Citrus, hops and light malt, with a dry middle and hops bitter finish. A mild off flavor in the bitterness in the end, otherwise a nicely balanced, good tasting imperial pilsner."
""
""
""
"On a bit of a pilsner kick this Spring. Decided to revisit My Antonia. Pours a lovely light clear gold with a fluffy head. I really can't put the aroma into words, other than to say that it smells like it's going to taste crisp and delicious. And it does! There's a slightly bitter, strong alcohol bite that follows the crisp pilsner taste. A little bit of tangy citrus there as well. This is the only imperial pilsner I've had, so I have nothing to compare it to. Even so, it's a great beer, for sure."

"Overall – This is one nice beer. It is crisp and refreshing yet packed with quite a bit of flavor. One I will surly do again."
""
"Wow, one fantastic beer."
"Have had the Italian brewed version and the American version. I am not sure if I actually enjoyed the Italian version better or just the idea of it. But the carbonation is definitively better in the Italian version, many very tiny, densely packed, and very effervescent bubbles. Any how this beer is fairly lite in flavor and really has no bold side and I would say the only thing that really leaps out at your palate at any given point in a sip is a sweet brief citrusy moment that is soon followed by a quick finish."
""
""
""
""
"Golden effervescence... mammoth, billowing white head, great clarity with only a bit of yeast...this is a beautiful beer. The smell is fresh, herbal and spicy hops, along with a soft pale malt scent. The taste is soft, sweet, and refreshing. It's sweeter and stronger than most pils, but is still clean. Full in body, but the finish is crisp and abrupt. Nice mixture of hops and malt. It's an aggressive beer that still projects a subtle and delicate balance. Great."

"This seems like sort of an odd style as pilsners are quite light and delicate and Imperial anything tends to be... less than light and delicate. I wasn't really sure what to expect but this beer really impressed me. If it wasn't so damn expensive I would buy this all the time, especially for the warmer months. Note: if you pour the yeast it changes the beer for the worse, sort of mellows it out and makes it boring."

"+ comes in a champange huge bottle.. its like a bomber + a few more ounces"

"Overall, while this is an ok brew, it does leave me disappointed. I think because I was expecting more and was super excited to try it. Worth a try but glad I didn't buy the bottle."

""
""
""
""
""
"O- this has the makings of a good beer, and I really don't think the hops should have fallen off as quick as they have....but what can you do? I'd try it on draught if I saw it, but I don't think I'd buy it in bottles anymore"

"O: This is a fine imperial pils that has Dogfish Head's unmistakable signature all over it. I'm surprised it has taken this long for them to produce a lager, because judging from the quality of this beer, they obviously have the ability to do lagers well. Even if you're leery of bottom-fermented beverages, give this one a go."
"Pours a translucent honey color into my pint glass... a tall billowy head develops on top. Aroma is fantastic with pronounced floral and fruity aspects - lemon, pineapple, grapefruit, apricot, as well as sugary caramel all in there. Tastes great, much like the aroma, and has a deep malt backbone as well, with a pleasant smack of hoppy bitterness. Coats the mouth nicely with a warming sensation going down. Lots of lacing on the glass. Overall, I have only had a few 'imperial pilsners' but this one stacks up quite well and also is the archetype of the BA description for the style. Well done DFH!"

""

""
""
"O - This is a very good brew, though I would agree with another post that this resembles an APA maybe more than a pilsner. Even still, this was a very nice, balanced, beer. This still resembles a pilsner enough to satisfy pilsner fans, but has enough hop complexity to cross over for the PA/IPA fans."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a much better beer than I remembered, maybe the first time was too fresh and too hoppy. We've had this for a few months, so the hops probably faded back a fair amount. Now that the 90 Minute IPA is hard to find in New England, I think this is going to be my recommended substitute."

"Overall- As I mentioned, I'm not a big pilsner fan as a rule, but this beer grew on me a bit as the bottle emptied. It's definitely enjoyable, though I probably wouldn't pick it up again. I do have to dock it points though, because it really comes off to me as a crisp APA rather than a pilsner. I appreciate what the brewers were trying to do but it's got just a bit too much going on and the elements don't all mesh well for me. Not as ""clean"" as I was hoping for, if that makes sense."
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is exactly like the smell. It feels so slippery and soapy, and also tastes slightly soapy. Citric hops give it a bit of balance. Actually has a light body and feels light for its style. Malt is almost non-existent which is odd for the style, but I dont mind. it is very balanced, and rather drinkable. Glad I got to try it on tap instead of buying a 750 and drinking it all myself."

"O - Leave it to Dogfish to buck the trend of traditional Pilsners. This is not your traditional, nobly hopped, crisp and clean Pilsner offering. It is a flavorful, strong, original take on the style. While not strict to the style, it is certainly an interesting adaptation. Would recommend."

"750ml bottle: This one pours a slightly hazy, straw yellow color. There was a HUGE frothy white head on it that leaves some lacing. Pretty good hop nose to this one. Earthy and floral notes. Some spiciness also. A fair amount of maltiness in the background. The taste is just a bit bitter, with a hint of spiciness. Fair amount of maltiness in the background. All in all a pretty nice pilsner."

"finally! a pilsner than i can get off on... this is a hop masterpiece, with all kinds of aromatic and bittering hops going on. pours a chewy straw gold color with a nice white head. smells strong and very hoppy. taste is complex for a pilsner, with layers of interesting hops and pale malts juxtaposing one another in rhythm. this is a really groovy pils, and a strong one. really full bodied for a pilsner as well, and has that hop thickness like the 120 minute, just to a much lesser degree. nice job yet again here by DFH"
""
""
""
"Pours with a three finger white head that fades very slowly leaving a good lace. Hazy amber color. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Floral hop nose and flavor is good balance of caramel and hops, lingering hop aftertaste. $10.99 for a 750ml bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, Ma."
""

"Bottled in 2011. Golden yellow in color with excellent clarity. Poured with a huge, rocky foam that clings to the glass in thick sheets. The constant migration of large bubbles from the base of the glass to the foam is mesmerizing. Earthy floral and herbal aromas with biscuity malt and a hint of spice. Heavier than medium bodied and smooth with assertive carbonation throughout. Biscuity malt flavor up front with floral hops and spice grabbing the taste buds through the middle. Finishes crisply with a lingering biscuit and pine hop bitterness that slowly drys the palate. Nice complexity for a generally simple style."
""
""
""
""
""
"One finger small bubble head, a bit rocky, over surprisingly cloudy medium gold body, hard to see any carbonation. Once the beer warmed up floral notes with some faint citrus aromas. Taste is solid malt up front, some floral notes in the middle with noticeable but not strong C-note hops on backend. Mouthfeel a bit on full side of medium, good effervescence. Decent taste, fairly complex hop profile on the tastebuds, but lack of clarity for the style had me scratching my head."

"This is an easy beer to drink. I am not the biggest pilsner fan, I like them fine but it isn't a style I usually seek out. That said I'll try anything with the Dogfish name on it. This beer is a must for Pilsner fans, or DFH fans."
"Cloudy straw color in appearance with two fingers of white head, but no retention or lacing. Bold smell of hops and citrus in the nose. This offering has a very strong hop presence for a pils (I am NOT complaining). The finish is nice and dry. I am a fan of DFH and this offering upholds my faith in them"

Great mingling of flavors with a welcome touch of alcohol on this 'bigger' pilsener. Greatly enjoyable, and I will enjoy this again."

"O – Not a big fan of the style, this was a good pilsner I enjoyed & would recommend, enjoyable with good drinkability 4"
"Drinkability - one of the more drinkable imperial types. Tasty! Here's to a few wins next weekend!"
"The carbonation isn't strong, the body is medium, and the brew is a bit dry."
"This imperial pilsner pours a rich golden orange color with a fingers width of white head. Smells of sweet hops. Taste is sort of bready, a bit of a heavy lager taste. sweet and citrusy hop bite lingering with a slight bit of alcohol coming through. I've heard many mixed reviews but I have to say I like this one. Thumbs up!"
"Some very nice flavoring and the obvious use of quality ingredients that DFH is know for is there, but this may be extreme to the point that it maybe shouldn't be labeled as a pilsner. Obviously this isn't my favorite from my favorite brewery, but I would give anything they do a try. If you like DFH, then try this one."
"D- although it's undeniable this beer was made with quality ingredients and craftsmanship, what i poured out of this bottle was a disappointing imbalance resulting in a ridiculously over hopped beer being subsequently over malted. or maybe underlagered? i don't know but i think the yeast needs to eat some more of the sugar and bump up the abv... or just make it one hell of a fragrant regular pils. but then again, that wouldn't be off-centered now would it?"
"I give a Schlitz for this high gravity pils. It is tasty and interesting, but quite expensive."
"94."
"I would definitely drink this again."
"Imperial Pilsner is an intriguing style that had me at ""hello."" Dogfish Head's representative works because it was created under the aegis of one who knows the craftiness and complexity of certain beers. Anyone can put ""Imperial Pilsner"" on a label and make it work; Dogfish Head did and does."
"O - a great interpretation of the style definitely worth picking up."
"I enjoyed this Imperial Pilsner out of a bottle, poured into a pint glass. This Pilsner poured a hazy, golden color It produced a medium sized white head. Retention was very good. The lacing was above average. The aroma was very nice for a pilsner, full of malt and grassy hop and citrus. The taste of this brew was semi sweet, full of malted grain and had a nice bitter hoppy citrus flavor. Full body, dry finish. This was my first shot at an Imperial Pilsner- I will say that this is the best Pilsner that I have ever sampled! Another awesome brew from Dogfish."
"O: inreally enjoy this brew, love the hop character, smooth but very complex, not what i had expected out of a pilsner but notnat all disappointed"
"Pours a slightly hazy, but clear straw gold with tons and tons of tiny bubbles rising to form a massive three finger pillowy head. Smells like fresh cut grass and lemon. I also get a nice maltiness coming through. Nothing stellar about the aroma, but nice nonetheless. The taste starts off malty sweet, but then turns into a nice bitterness. It finishes slightly dry but nothing like an IPA. Lemon and grass are the most dominant flavors. Remarkably refreshing and easy to drink. This is a beer I wish DFH would sell in 6 packs. Overall, fantastic brew. This is not complex, this is not unique, and this is not the best beer I have ever had. But this is surely the most refreshing and best tasting pilsner I have tried to date. If you are a hop head looking for something new, try this one out. A+ for style!"
"Dr: This is an outright perversion of the style. The price is high (this was in Rome), and the quality is rather limited. I'll try it in bottle form back in the states, but it's far from high on me list."
"O/D - Very drinkable. A lovely blend of strenth and lighter hops to make the style seem very workable. Quite nice."
"Tulunes, in J'Town, PA, set me up again with a great F'ing beer. The ""My Antonia"" from Doggie Fish head was awesome!!! The color was a hazy yellow with thick white foamy head that laced like a hot Victoria Secret model. The smell had nice hop/cirtus tones with balanced pilsner malt. The taste flowwed the smell lead and was quite good. the hop/citrus notes were balanced nicely with pilsner malt. The mouthfeel was a bit tough because of the ABV, but otherwise a very drinkable beer. Overall...VERY GOOD!"
"Bottle: Poured a lightly hazy orangey color pilsner with a large foamy head with good retention. Aroma of sweet malt with loads of floral hoppy notes is quite enjoyable. Taste is a nice mix between some sweet floral malts which are well balanced by some dry crisp hops. Body is quite full with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Very well brewed and even though quite extreme still manage to retain some balance and drinkability."
"Bomber of great smooth fun. The pilsner hops and European malts comes through the scent, which is floal. Thick white head on light yellow pilsner body. Very smooth and good drinkability. Carbonation is right there. Burning in system, so a bit acidic with its lemony taste. Drying finish."
"O- I found this one to be rather boring, but still pretty easy to drink. Just not really me thing I guess."
"The appearance is a bright straw color with a generous white head. It has an exceptional nose, very inviting. There is hay, citrus fruit, corn and sugar. Moving on to the taste, this imperial comes across with banana, malts, hops and more of that sugary sweetness. But I found all of it to be very well balanced. It has a medium body to it, with perfect level of carbonation."
"Has a nice, fresh, hoppy flavor. Not too heavy but not too light. Held up with some sweet non-descript fruity flavors. The finish was a pleasant hops bitterness. Pretty solid beer from DFH. Nothing too extreme or complex. Serves as a reminder that lagers can be made this good and be quite enjoyable. Rather smooth and cream on the palate."
"O - Meh, not worth the price atall!"
"D - I received a bottle of this for my birthday, and what a gift it was. Glad I got the opportunity to try it. If you see one around, don't hesitate."
"Overall I thought this was an excellent rendition of the imperial pilsner style. I’ve had better versions, but this had a unique hop character and was probably one of the best looking that I have tried so far."
"i guess things are bound to get crazy when you try to make an imperial pilsner and especially when Sam is at the helm. this is a kick ass beer. though it just doesnt remind me of a lager."
"O- A solid interpretation on the style. I'm not a huge fan of Pilsners in general, but this was a tasty beer. This makes me want to try other Pilsners, but not more than one here and there."
"Overall: A complex beer which may be one of the better imperial pilsners I have had."
"Even if you don't like pilsners, this one would be worth trying."
"This is a very good and interesting beer. I'm glad I stumbled upon it, and hope to have it again. It is very balanced, nuanced, and fairly complex. Definitely worth a try."
"D/O- one of the better impy pils I've had. Nice summer evening beers to split with a great friend. Thanks fdkayti!"
"Overall: Bouncing it off my recollections of DFH Golder Shower, this one seems to have a more rustic grainy quality, certainly more bitterness, and less sweetness, alcohol, and body."
"This is a solid beer. Everything about it is enjoyable. The only down side is that pilsners, imperial or not, are boring to me. The 750 mL bottle is about all I'd want of this."
"O- Really impressed w/ this beer. Definitely the best of the style I've personally had. Recommended- and a nice summer beer w/ a malt backbone."
"M: The mouthfeel is sweet and thick, decent but I think that I need a fresher bottle."
"A taste forward drinking pilsner. Lacks the spicy dry attribute that makes most pilsners."
"D: Overall an interesting style that I'll have to try more of to get more familiar with. With regards to this offering, I enjoyed the taste quite a bit with the mouthfeel leaving a little to be desired for me. Nonetheless, I could easily go through a bomber of this. Delicious."
"O: Another great brew from DFH. Very close to an IPA, with the malt flavors being the only separator. I would and have bought this more than once, and will continue to do so when its available."
"Just a really great job by DFH….I really love this beer and will seek it out (and other imperial pils) down the road!!"
"Glassware: 750ml bottle into snifter"
"Nothing mind-blowing here, but a solid beer, and enjoyable drink - well-suited for the summer."
"Poured on-tap and served in a pint glass, the beer is a bright, burnt yellow coloring, extremely vibrant, with a thin ring of film on the surface. Moderate signs of carbonation throughout the body of the brew. The nose is clean, with toasted oats and a smooth hops presence. The flavor is a smokey-toasted cereal characteristic initially, with a mild lacing of peppered hops. The beer has a creamy feel, and it leaves a considerable lacing along the flass while you drink. The aftertaste is all hops, with a smooth, and slightly bitter finish. Very tasty."
"O - one of these big bottles will set your mind right. Goes down fast, at 7.5, packs a more than average pilsner punch. One of the best smelling pilsners I have had, but it strangely seems more like an IPA. Recommended."
"Although I am not a big pilsner guy, this is definitely worth a shot. Personally - and I realize this is an imperial, if this were the standard pilsner - then I'd be a big fan of the style. Another great, tasty brew from DFH - probably wouldn't have even picked this up had they not been out of just about everything else down at the Rehoboth brewpub - I'm definitely glad I did though. Will definitely be revisiting this."
"O- I drank nearly a whole 750ml of this on my own - happily. Definitely some of DFH's best work."
"OD- A great beer that is only showing it's alcohol content as the bottle empties. Can and will finish this on my own (greedy Kayti is greedy). Really enjoyed this Imperial Pils."
"Mouthfeel is creamy and silky smooth, with low carbonation, a medium body and very high drinkability that covers the ABV completely. Another great beer from DFH that I recommend trying."
"Glad I got to try this one..."
"O: I enjoyed this brew, an interesting member of DFH's lineup, considering its a lager. I would enjoy another, but it is pricey."
"Overall it's DFH so that should say ""damn good"" all on its own without much further comment."
"This beer lends credence to my growing belief that, if you crank up the ABV and toss in loads of hops, you can pretty much pave right over any ability to distinguish between an ale and a pilsner. Here we have a tasty beer, bright carbonation, assertive but not overpowering hops with some citrus notes. Body is a bit on the lighter side, as befits a pilsner, but, then again, it could pass for a light-bodied ale. Alchohol lends a bit of pepper at the finish, with just a little rawness."
"Got to try this one at the 2010 ACBF. The beer poured out as a nice golden color with a strong looking white head on top. The smell of citrus and grains come through on the nose, very pleasant aroma. The taste of the beer is nothing like a typical pilsner, I was hoping it'd be something a little over the top and it was thankfully. It had mostly citrus fruit notes, lots of hops also. The mouthfeel of this beer is smooth and very drinkable. Might be a bit of a dangerous beer to drink a lot of. Overall I really enjoyed this one. I'd like to have it again one day."
"O: Overall, this is a solid Imperial Pils, one that sets the baseline for the style. Maybe a bit over hopped, but still a very good beer."
"While it might be imperial, I expected a lot more from DFH."
"O- This limited release from Dogfish Head was a pleasant surprise... A nice combination of a classic German pils and a westcoast AIPA. I would drink this again."
"Overall - A nice change of pace from imperial ales but I would have like the flavor to have been a little bit less sweet and cleaner. Not my favorite style and IMO overpriced but a good beer all the same."
"O: This is a really well put together Imperial Pils. Has the main characteristics of a Pilsner but a nice amount of hops that give it a really nice kick."
"A great IP. Not too big and a nice change of pace for DFH. How often do you see this style? Not cheap, but a nice treat!"
"A good beer for sure, but not necessarily up my alley I suppose."
"Citrus up front - sweet orange followed by bitter grapefruit which dominates the citrus notes. Finishes dry with a creamy smoothness - butterscotch coating. A damn good beer & the best pilsner I've had."
"Great beer. I have something of a love/hate relationship with Dogfish Head; I love their experimentation, and their boundary pushing, but I often find their beers a little misguided and sometimes undrinkable. This is not one of those—this is a big beer, no doubt, but one which has been put together with style and balance in mind. Great work."
"O: This is one of several lagers I've been enjoying since the weather got warm. Anything like this summer teeth, joe's pils, etc. that can give you tons of flavor and be this sessionable are great for this time of year. My favorite DFH hop-forward beer to date."
"Would gladly drink more of these."
"O: Overall I enjoyed the slight bitter hop bite that was well balanced and mellowed with a decent malt backing, This was a very drinkable pilsner that I wouln't mind having another one of."
"Overall I can't say this is my favorite DFH brew. But for a Pilsner I guess this is pretty good."
"Na Zdravje!"
"O - I wasn't overly enamored with this one, but it was my first exposure to imperial pilsner style and the beer did get better as a drank down the 750."
"I normally turn to the 60 Minute as my standby, but this one gives it a run for the money. Absolutely worth trying!"
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: At the beginning I wasn’t all that certain I liked this beer, but the more of it had the better I liked it. One sip followed the last quite easily. My overall impression is of an interesting take on the Pilsner style and one that I’ll enjoy occasionally. That said, however, I’ll continue to prefer Pils style beers such as the Prima, Stoudt’s, Sunshine and Pikeland from the breweries of SE PA."
"Overall definitely a beer I'd seek out again."
"A hazy dirty golden. A large amount of head formed and had great retention all the way too the end. The nose has a pungent hop aroma. Earthy and musty at first but soon some lemony citrus cuts through. A lot of sweet Pilsner malt is present. Flavor is very sweet but with a huge lemon hop character that transitions to earthy/hay then piney bitter on the finish. Has the mouthfeel of an imperial IPA along with the hop character but the malt is obviously lighter from using Pilsner. This was an interesting mix of hop flavors put together over such a light but thick body. Interesting to try this one time."
"Overall, I enjoyed this one quite a bit and would definitely have it again."
"Slainte!! and Happy Independence Day!"
"Overall: had this side by side to the Birra Del Borgo version and I like this is bit better. Slightly more crisp and refreshing. Easy drinking too."
"Probably more akin to an IPA than a pilsner, the malt profile is crisp, clean, large, and on one side of the field; whereas the American/European hop flavors are on the other side battling for dominance. A good beer throughout, but there seems to be an offset in balance and contrast in identity- kinda schizophrenic."
"O - I really enjoy this beer. I am not a huge fan of Pilsners but this is really a great tasting beer. I enjoy drinking it and would consider this a nice go-to beer when having some light pasta and lighter style foods."
"this beer is awesome"
"Two finger head of white foam, with lots of cling from the lace. The color is a very slightly cloudy 6 on the SRM beer color chart. Lots of micro bubble action. Smell is that of grapefruit, pine nut, lemon peel, malt, black pepper, and roasted wheat. Taste is to almost steal for more, with lots and lots of hops in the forefront as the taste of pink grapefruit and lemon peel there also flavors of black pepper, wheat, weak coffee, sweetness of orange, and malt. Mouthfeel is full and creamy, with a crispness in the front and a slight drying in the back. Good beer, wonderful hop flavor, and the buzz is just a fabulous wave of buzz. I am going out to get a few more once I sober up."
"While many examples of this style expand on a regular pilsner - this is more of a distillation of key flavors. Bare bones, but intense and sharply honed. Cuts right through spicy food."
"Overall: More of an occasional treat than an everyday beer."
"Overall, nicely done brew, somewhere between a stronger common and strong pils."
"I didn't even want to finish the 10-12 oz pour of this one. I actually handed the thing off to a friend an ordered something else. Maybe I'm just a crisp, noble hop type of pilsner guy."
"O: I typically stay away from pilsners because of their lack of body and flavor. However, this one takes the cake! I purchased it because of the comment on the label that it is ""continually hoped"" and it stands by its words. And, I am a big fan of Dogfish Head beers. This is a beer that is perfect light lovers and hopheads alike. Bravo Sam Calagione! Another great beer out of Delaware!"
"Slight haze in the golden body of this beer. Large white head that leaves lacing. Smells of light wheat, light citrus, floral notes, some herbal, and applesauce. Spice hops, herbal notes, bitter dry hops make an appearance, light citrus background, slick herbal flavor stays in the aftertaste. Medium bodied with light carbonation. A pilsener that feel like a pale with that hop presence. A good touch."
"Overall - I personally think this beer seems slightly overhyped and definitely overpriced (paid $10 for a bomber). It is very unique and complex, I just don't think the overall taste is that spectacular. Still a good beer worth trying. I've sampled 2 of the imperial/double pilsners so far and haven't been overly impressed."
"Overall, solid brew. I was impressed yet again by DFH."
"The beer pours a bright, clear amber, with a big, fluffy white head, big bubbles, with noticeable carbonation rising to the top. The head was well retained and lasted throughout the beer, some lacing was noted. The beer has a nice aroma to it, well balanced. The taste of the beer is really good, again, well balanced with some pine hops noticeable. The beer had a light feel to it with good carbonation. The beer was clean, crisp and very enjoyable. Overall, this is a very good beer and one that I look forward to trying again."
"O: An absolutely beautiful Imperial Pilsner! Spot on with hops throughout. Incredibly smooth, crisp and refreshing."
"O: Pilsner? – more like an IPA crossed with a ESB. But I’m not complaining!"
"Mouthfeel is somewhat heavy as expected, but smooth and relatively easy to drink. Put it all together and this is a fairly potent brew that can sneak up on you pretty easily due to its easy drinking nature."
"O- This beer stays clean, dry and crisp with having just a touch of sweetness to the pale malt and a full hops flavor that is nice and pungent with very little bitterness. This drinks like a beer half its ABV."
"O: Very well done and I would have liked to have had 2."
"O: I believe relying on Saaz, rather than PNW varietals, would have made this a better beer. DFH mentions the use of noble verities, but they are definitely in the background. Don't get me wrong, the brew is tasty as is, but is hardly identifiable as a pils."
"D: Nice. I'd order another and might buy again. A good ""IPL"""
"Finished the bomber myself, perfect beer for a nice hop craving. Certainly hoppier than I expected from DFH and this beer wasn't all that ""imperial"" to ruin the experience."
"O: Overall, a decent beer. The flavors are a bit bland and heavy on the hops, making it taste more like a pale ale or IPA. I'd prefer a bit more of a pilsner taste to the beer."
"Poured from a 750ml bottle into a Duvel tulip glass. This brew poured a bright amber color with a 3 finger foamy white head. Medium high carbonation and little bitter hoppiness gives this beer a crisp character. Mouthfeel is medium with a slight slickness. This beer smells mild,low levels of hoppy citrus and pine are noticeable. There are also aromas of sweet malt and a mild grassiness. The flavor is a good balance between hoppy bitterness and malty sweetness. There are notes of bread and hint of spices and the finish is bitter sweet...and long lasting."
"Overall, a very unique beer that I greatly enjoyed. I rarely drink pilsners but if they all were like this one that would probably change. I'll be seeking this one out again."
"O-I have never had an imperial pilsner before this one and i fully enjoyed this beer. Another interesting delicious beer from Dogfish Head."
"D: Low due to the ABV content."
"Decent beer refreshing and kinda sneaky. I tend to drink hiefes and pils fast and this one got me decently doozy"
"O Yes, deserves more than one, but be careful, this one is deceiving and very quaffable.  4.5 "
"Even poured slow, this head is a behemoth! Thick, rocky, eggshell head patches all over. Body is slightly cloudy, pilsner-yellow. Looks delicious. Smell is candy hops, and a lot of sugary sweetness. Taste has a nice bready and hay-like backbone, but the hops shine through and show their muscle. Grassy, complex hops that stay on the aftertaste. A tad bit of heat on the end, but it's expected for an imperial offering such as this. Sticky after-finish. Very good beer."
"A nice take on the style but I believe I'd prefer Odell IMP Pils or Sam Adams or for sure a fresh Prima Pils. The predominant grapefruit makes me think west coast IPA meets Pils"
"Finish: A tad dry but very drinkable because of the good carbonation of this beer. Lots of good flavor here"
"Overall is a good beer that I'll probably end up grabbing again. If they dropped the price just a hair and put these in 6 or 4 packs I'd be all over it."
"What a great beer by DF. This is a good representation of the hardest beer to perfect. Did they perfect it? I will leave that up to you."
"O= not for the faint-hearted or for standard Pils fans at all. Hopheads Dream, however. Pairings? Probably nothing-- but why ruin a superb beer with food, anyways?!?"
"Pours into my DFH snifter a slightly hazy, light amber color with about an inch+ of creamy white head and decent lacing. Aroma is light: some hops, a bit of grass, some yeast, maybe some lemon peel. Mouthfeel is of a medium body. Taste is of yeast, a bit of hops, maybe a hint of spice. This is my second attempt at this brew. I am still unimpressed. It tastes like a slightly better version of a cheap, mass produced pilsner."
"O - A good and unique lager. Not just your typical run of the mill lager. But coming from DogFish Head, what would you expect. In my opinion, I think the $10 price tag is a little steep for this brew tho."
"Overall is this is a very nice refreshing imperial pilsner, very enjoyable."
"O: Very tasty beer, albeit a bit hot for me. If I had tasted this before I bought, I might reconsider the $12 purchase. Still glad I've tried it."
"D- The alcohol is well hidden. This drinks rather nicely. I am impressed."
"O – In a blind taste test I’d be more inclined to call this a ‘DFH 30min IPA’ than a Pils, but on whole the brew is refreshing with nice, clean flavors. I definitely enjoyed it."
"The mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with a slightly below average carbonation. This goes down easily and is very easy to drink. Overall, this is a great beer. With high drinkability, and great flavors this is an impressive Imperial Pilsner."
"O - Not bad but not worth the price. Go with Prima Pils or Sunshine Pils."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, this is a nice beer with flavor and substance making it worth drinking for a long time."
"O: I really enjoyed this, and will definitely be picking up more. Nice way to kick back on a warm day after work or watching a game."
"I'm not a big Pilsner fan, but this one would be welcome with dinner any time!!"
"Comes out of the tap a clear amber with a respectable, if not persistent, white head. Fairly strong aroma is malty and fruity with just a hint of hops. Flavor is malty and has a firm fruity undertone that is mainly pear, along with more than a hint of hops and touches of both sweetness and bitterness. Texture is almost silky smooth with a subtle fizz. I know that I tend to be unfair to pilsners, but I hope I gave this one a fair shake."
"Closer to medium body, with a good amount of carbonation. Alcohol seems pretty well hidden. Not a bad beer here. Hop character is not as strong as I would have thought."
"Overall-A home run; bravo! BUY SOME. Perfect complement to the Caps-Rangers game that's on right now."
"Pours a golden yellow with a huge, thick, fluffy white head. Awesome lacing and stays throughout. Aroma of grass, pepper and yeast. Flavor starts off with some nice sweet grass notes and bready yeast. Hay and a bit of lemon zest as well. Nice citrus and floral hops in this roided up pilsner. Ends with big pepper notes and other spices."
"I'm pleasantly surprised with this one. Flavor is outstanding for a pils yet the body remains lighter than suggested by the rich taste."
"Drinkability is good an enjoyable beer."
"Overall: This is one of my favorite pilsners. The flavors all work together well and the slight bitterness at the end is perfect for this beer."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - A slight ethanol taste on the swallow can sometimes take away from the earth and grass notes. Light bodied and easy to drink in a flash. A good beer; but nothing fantastic."
"The flavor is very deceiving at first. It has the body and the initial flavor of a big pilsner, but then you are immediately hit with lots of earthy hops and grass. A bit of citrus comes through toward the end and then it finishes out with a bit of peppery spice. It's good and rather unique. But not exactly amazing."
"A sipping and enjoying type of beer. Worth the time to enjoy."
"O/D: It's a tasty brew, but can't entirely recommend it. Kind of a weird beer (and style). Maybe freshness was an issue? (Not sure, just wondering)."
"I'm a bit surprised at how much I like this beer. And not for the reasons that I thought I would be. Try it, if you can find it."
"Draft. Sampled at Kickbcaks. Poured into a small snifter glass a clear straw colored golden color with a white collared head. Slightly fruity, grape aroma but very light otherwise, some wheat and mild citrus. Light mouthfeel. Light fruit like start with citrus notes and some bitterness. This one has a nice balance between bitter and sweet. Bitterness lingers and reminds me of almost a lime rind flavor."
"O- I was looking for just a good drinkable beer tonight, and this fit the bill and delivered. This will be awesome on a hot spring/summer day."
"Overall, a nice lager departure for usually ale-centric Dogfish Head. I'd like to see some more lagers out of Milton."
"o - Overall this is a good brew. Nothing too crazy but the hops added to the pilsner is a nice touch. The DFH feel is there and it works nicely for this brew."
"4.0 D: Pretty good beer. The taste score was just about bumped up another half point. Has the benefit of the bottle conditioned flavor without being too bready. High hop levels is a welcomed addition."
"Overall, a good double pilsner, all of the components necessary are present and blend well together."
"Fairly full bodied with some fruity yeast esters and grassy hoppy notes leading off. Dry crackery middle, herbal finish. Clean and easy drinking. Additional notes of citrus rind, some dried orange peel bitterness, pleasant hop notes that blend seamlessly with mildly sweet pilsner malt. Overall very enjoyable, seems like it would pair nicely with a variety of food. Thanks Chris for sharing!"
"If I'm ever in a place where Prima's not available, but this beer is, I won't hesitate for a second."
"It was a real pleasure to drink and it would be very easy to sit back and enjoy several of these in one sitting on a nice warm spring night. I'd love to pick up a big bottle and see how it compares."
"Overall enjoyment for me is very high. I love this beer. A big winner for DFH."
"Notes: im glad that its not that high in terms of abv, like some other imperial lagers out there. the hops in this beer are intense and actually almost make this pilsner a sipping beer. i prefer this beer over something like ST Krampus because, if i recall correctly, this has a greater pils malt character to balance the extreme hops"
"I was quite surprised how little hop presence this had, especially considering the branding and style. While I wasn't expecting a hop overload like an Imperial IPA would give me, I still wanted more from this. Judging the beer for the style - taking a Pilsner and amplifying its qualities - this is spot on. It may catch some people off guard by the overall mildness of the hops and increase in the grains, though it's still a devilishly tasty beer."
"Great Drinkability. I was worried that DFH's imperial take on such a session style would kill its drinkability, but that wasn't the case. I look forward to buying more of this!"
"Love the balance. A pleasant surprise. Sometimes the imperial label is used as an excuse for a ""big"" unbalance beer. This time it is not."
"Maybe the (well maybe not) stealth way the alcohol took hold had some influence, but I found My Antonia to be one lovely high-octane pilsner. Highly recommended."
"This is my first ""Imperial Pilsner"" and while I'm looking forward to trying others, the bar has been set fairly high."
"Nice, soft, mild, easy to drink beer. Very crisp and refreshing, yet with a creamy edge. Its a nice golden copper with a white fluffy head, great retention and lace. The smell is faint, but it mostly floral, with hints of grass and a touch of pine. Soft, pale malts in the the front with a slight syrupy sweetness, followed with a touch of earthy hops, a hint of citrus and pine. Nothing bitter in the back. Very mild, easy to drink and crisp and refreshing. alcohol well hidden. Very nicely balanced beer."
"this beer is def. worth trying....i've never been let down by these guys!"
"Overall I remain unsure as to what constitutes a ""traditional"" imperial pilsner. In any event, this beer seems to fit the bill and is a nicely done beer. Worth a shot."
"Very well put together big pilsener here. Tasty and highly drinkable."
"Excellent, and at only $7.99 for the bottle, one that is worth having in reserve formthat summer evening with friends."
"The classic Pilsner pale golden body was highly effervescent, and the head was a good four finger thick. The smell was very hoppy, with some clove, hay, and faint hint of smoke. The taste was departure from a Pilsner, due to the high hop content, which showed up as a mix of bitter and spicy flavors. There was a lemon twist taste in the finish, and some alcohol warmth after each sip. Not exactly a quenching beer, but the complex profile, and creamy mouthfeel made me want to keep drinking. Hard to tell this was a lager, until you knew beforehand, and then the lack of residual sugars was a bit more apparent."
"O: a fantastic brew -- perfect for introducing that light-beer-chugging skeptic you know to the world of craft brewing. This is the best pilsner I've ever had, hands down. Cheers!"
"The beer pours a golden color, with the slightest haziness. The head looks fluffy and tastes creamy and lasts well into the beer. Nice lacing. Smells like fresh rising dough and is balanced with a good earthy hops. Slightly sweet malt upfront sweet with some a bit of spice towards the end. finishes with long lasting pungent flavors which are surprisingly quite good. It is medium bodied, and coats the mouth nice. A beer I could drink in many situations. A great version of pils spiced up a bit."
"Pours a pretty golden brown with hints of orange sunset. Big fluffy head that sticks around even half through the beer, leaving nice lacing in its wake. Nose has some sweet bready malts, some spiciness, almost fresh backed cinnamon roll and some light pine forest. Taste is a nice hoppy. Bitterness with caramel malts - for the style a tasty beer. Finish is dry and a bit astrigent, but cleans up decently well for the next sip. I was happy with the purchase a nice example of an imperial pilsner and for the limited choices in the category a good one to make."
"-Cheers"
"O- certainly not the worst imperial pilsner that ive tried. i found it easy to finish my glass and enjoyed the next one too. the 750ml bottle size is perfect for a person if thats all they want in an evening."
"O: A wonderfully balanced, complex pilsner that rivals any other pilsner for top dog. It's the perfect beer for a springtime evening or a cool summer night. I was sad when I had reached the bottom of my bomber bottle."
"Tasty, high drinkability. The 7.5% is well hidden. Nice contri to the DFH line-up in the ""non-extreme"" space (and i do loves the extremes too)."
"Pours a clear straw in color, soapy head and a bit fizzy at that. Bright and clarity is good. Retention is decent and some lace is noted. Suggestions of lemon, grass and green hop in the nose and taste. Very smooth on the palate, crisp and also belgianesque in its carbonation. A touch of hop, this ale tastes like a big clean pils, does not taste like a euro style pils, distinctly American despite the origins and name. Good feel and overall interesting and well made. A successful beer and would love to have again."
"Great pils, very enjoyable, not too bitter. Strong, for a pils anyway, but hides it well."
" This beer pours a slightly hazy, bright gold color. A pretty epic amount of bright, white head retains its shape quite well. Not much in the aroma department. Hints of copper and a slight hint of hops. A nice clean front; crisp with just a bit of honey. The finish is dry with a very, very minimal hop presence (but it's there is you look for it). These guys continue to be one of my favorite breweries ever. This, while not anything totally out of the box, is still a super delicious beer that is worth trying at least once."
"Quite well-balanced, with an alcohol level that is hidden very well (until it sneaks up on you, of course). A bit heavier and more pungent than a regular Pils, such is to be expected from an ""Imperialized"" version of the style, and this one pulls it off very well, taking all of the bits of a good Pilsner and extrapolating upon them. Subtlety is not its main suit, but toned down, subtlety would be the name of the game -- this is definitely a top-notch example of what it means for an American brewery to take a classic staple and give it a bigger, bolder flair."
"The taste starts with a mouth full of carbonation with a sweet and pungent hop flavor. The hops are earthy grassy with a slight spicyness nice"
"Overall, a pretty tasty Imperial Pils. If they made 6ers of this I think it would be a big hit. Could be a spring/summer seasonal to rival sam adams noble pils."
"Bottle poured into a snifter. This is a clear golden color, very fizzy with a foamy head. Smell is heavy on crisp, foresty hops and cereals. Taste is hoppy with more cereals and a somewhat soapy finish. Mouthfeel foamy, fizzy, and soapy. Excellent drinkability."
"GET THIS YUMMY PILSNER!"
"Overall - A basic pilsner jacked up on hops. Nothing extreme just a twist on ths style. A decent change, easy to drink and flavorful. The bitterness takes a few drinks to get used to but its solid. Pilsner is not my favorite but i found this drinkiable and would be a great bbq or hot summer day drink."
"D: Solid and distinctive. I enjoyed this quite a bit. And unlike a few of DFH's 750ml offerings, it's pretty reasonably priced, so you can give it a try without too much of a hit to your bank account."
"Taste is exactly the same, followed by a touch of hop bitterness. Drinks smoothly with very light flavors, and can be enjoyed during any season. This is the highest ABV of any pilsner I've ever had, and in my very humble opinion, I can finally do justice in reviewing this style of beer. It needs that extra kick of heat. Thank you, DFH. I would definitely buy this beer again."
"O- This is a great beer, alot of DFH are too experimental for me, this is not. This is just a straight up Pilsner Lager, just jacked up and done right."
"Hazy Golden color with a white head. Spicy earthy hops aroma with grain and fruit. Grain and hops dominate the taste. Big mouth feel with some warming alcohol. Pretty smooth and clean which makes it very easy to drink. Runs slightly hot for only 7.5 percent but I guess the beauty of the pilsner is its simplicity so it's harder to mask."
"O- This is only my second adventure into the Imperial Pilsner style, and the first I've reviewed. I don't know exactly what is being looked for here, but the beer is good. I wish I had another."
"A huge improvement over Golden Showers, I can seek more of this."
"I like this beer, even so pilsener is not my favorite style."
"The brew is flawless, like I said. Huge foamy head. Lovely lace. It's most redeeming quality is hiding the booze taste - there isn't much considering how wimpy the flavor is. I would have like more finishing hops. A stink, Still, I will enjoy the rest. Don't refuse this if someone offers, but I won't buy it again."
"O: if I must rate to style, and I feel I must, I have to subtract points for a cloudy appearance, an ale-like body, and not enough crisp carbonation. Otherwise, a very tasty beer."
"drinkability was decent - the 750ml was a tad to much for me but overall a good beer and reasonably priced"
"O- Another very drinkable brew from DFH!!! Lager has never been my favorite style, but DFH hit one out of the park again with this clean and crisp beer."
"drinkable - yep."
"Pours a clean bright cold color, bubbly white head with good retention and lacing. Scent is hop forward with citrus, floral and a touch of piney hops. Backbone is light and clean pilsner malt. Taste brings the hops first, but not as aggressively as scent dictates. Solid pilsner malt body that doesnt ge tlost behind the hops. Medium bodied, smooth, clean. A nice suprise as the hops and malt work very well together."
"Opinion: This is a pretty good beer overall, and I was surprised that it wasn't just an imperial IPA brewed with German hops and malt. This beer actually comes across as a Pilsner, which is a little surprising to me. I didn't realize that I had some pre-conceptions of what to expect, but I guess I did. This beer shattered them and proved to be what it is...a Pilsner."
"D - Nicely drinkable, we had no problem with the bottle. Not particularly memorable, though, I won't be looking for this again."
"Overall, this is a great pils. You would guess this is a higher ABV pils until it's too late. Good beer! Well worth a try."
"D - I'm not a big pilsner fan but given Dogfish Head's unique brewing approach had to try this. Not a bad brew, flavors are woven well throughout the brew."
"D- My wife and I are drinking this one. She likes it, I'd pass on another one."
"Still another good venture by these brewery"
"D - This beer has great drinkability. It goes down easy and the flavor is great. I really enjoy this beer, and I'm glad that I picked it up. I recommend picking this one up. It is a very nice representation of this style."
"D: Drinks well enough, but nothing too special here. Pretty much just a high abv pilsner"
"I also like the fact that this is unquestionably Imperial, but at 7.5%, not as high as others that have been seen in this style. This is a good strength for this beer."
"D - This one did not blow me out of the water...this was a ""good"" pilsner...I expected a little more West Coast hop flavor and something different coming from DogFish Head...but like I said, don't get me wrong, this was a ""good"" beer"
"This beer poured a clear gold color and formed a nice big foamy off white head that coated the sides with lace. A medium amount of carbonation is present and it looks like a float. An aroma of grain, light hops, lemon and pepper. The favor was of malt, hop, bread and lemon with a hint of pepper. The body is light and the finish slightly astringent."
"The mouthfeel feels medium bodied and well-carbonated, but there's a bit of a hop stickiness that I find a little bit out of place with the balanced flavor profile. The drinkability is very good as well. I'm glad Dogfish has a lager out in production. Of course, it's very big and very Dogfish, but it's still great."
"Clear, golden color with a thick, foamy white head. Aromas of earthy grains and fresh dough, with some grass, too. Taste is firm, and very dry from a dominant profile of hops. Quite bitter, and not the softer, easy-drinking grain flavors that one might expect in a pilsner. It is pleasant to drink but bone dry. Given the one-dimensional and bitter flavor profile, I think it would be better matched with some ripe cheese and fruit, rather than as a stand-alone."
"Pours a light gold, huge, fluffy head, doesn't recede. Had some hop scents, some bready notes. This was not what I was expecting from a pilsner, but not in bad way. More hoppy than I expected, crisp and did follow through with some biscuity essence. The mouthfeel was crisp and is a drinkable pilsner. A nice offering from DFH."
"Notes: This is just an outstanding lager beer and I would highly recommend this to anyone!!!"
"Poured into a DFH glass a very nice hazy golden yellow color, nice carbonation, very nice two-finger creamy white head, with some very nice sticky lacing to follow. The nose is malty, with some nice hop notes, slight citrus note. The taste is slightly sweet, bitter, malty, hoppy, with some citrus notes. Medium Body, nice dry/bitter finish. Drinkable, a very nice brew, glad I've gotten a chance to try it."
"D- I loved this pilsner, great beer from Dogfish, will buy it every time."
"Great drinkability and very flavorful for a style that doesn't usually get this hopped up."
"Good for a pilsner I suppose, but the taste isn't too refined or memorable. Not too drinkable either."
"By the way... I drank this beer alongside a freshly made bowl of smoked tomato soup with bacon and a provolone & gouda grilled cheese."
"Dogfish makes wonderful ales of all sorts, but their first lager offering leaves a bitter taste in my mouth, literally and figuratively. Why not try something a little simpler, and work your way up to the ""extreme"" pilsner when you get that mastered?"
"My Antonia pours with a cloudy amber color with a creamy, frothy head. You can smell the hops right off the top of the pour as it went into the glass. It was a clean, smooth drink with the nice bite of hops but not too much where your taste buds are hurting. It is a smooth drink from first sip to bottom of the glass. The extra kick is the higher ABV, which is needed here, I think if it was lower the beer would suffer."
"Dogfish can really brew their ales but this proves they know how to really brew a lager just as well. Amazing mouthfeel doesn't feel light at all and the 7.5 alcohol is covered up as much as possible for a lighter pale beer. It's covered up so well and you don't that typical beery alcohol yeasty taste you'd get from most lower quality pilsners. This is like a German IPA and I really wish they could brew more of this one year round! With that being said this beer deserves way more notice than it gets."
"Taste-Sweet, mildly toasted malt, leading to a bit of a hoppy bite in the finish. Seems like a pale ale/pilsner hybrid. A bit more on the subtle side as I was expecting a big dose of Saaz hops and more fuller flavor."
"Good stuff. Love an imperial pilsner and this one is interesting."
"D: Probably because of my like of IPAs I could drink this all day. The highish ABV is hidden well also. Would be cool to find this on tap somewhere. I would certainly drink it. Just don't see as a Imperial Pilsner that I've had. Could have had bad examples?"
"This is an easy drinking well balanced beer. Seems a bit sweet for the style. I'd like to see it somewhat drier and more bitter. Overall though this beer would go great with dinner or as something to drink while watching sports."
"Overall a very nice and easy to drink imperial pilsener. Highly sessionable despite the abv."
"Cheers!"
"D: Very drinkable; not as complex as I though it would be but still pretty good."
"D: I'm not usually a pilsner drinker, but this is really nice. Great mix of flavors and very well balanced. Very easy to drink."
"Bottle. Pours hazy-golden with a short lived white head and lovely carbonation. Aroma is musty and hoppy. Full, crisp body. Biscuit malt is balanced on the palate by herbal hops with hints of orange fruit. Pleasant, long, hoppy finish. Nice, delicious brew."
"D - really quite drinkable, but I don't think I'll go back to it"
"smooth, medium-bodied mouthfeel with prickly carbonation. decent drinkability."
"D- The booze was just too distracting for me to really enjoy this bottle."
"This was my first offering of a Double Pils. Maybe I am just not used to the style but to me this was too sweet and not very good in the drinkability department."
"I'm really impressed by this beer. It's big on flavor and very unique. Plus although it's an Imperial it's still refreshing. A very nice break from the giant hop bombs and huge roasted imperial stouts."
"D-Really easy drinking, I was expecting quite a bit more bitterness from the other examples I've had of this style. It's a very interesting and complex beer that I'm glad I got to try, but not sure I would purchase again."
"(D)- A good imperial pilsner. Smooth and crisp with an ample hop addition. Pretty good"
"My Antonia is an impressive Imperial Pilsner. It's not my favorite, and doesn't come quite close to displacing Sam Adams Hallertau Pilsner. Nonetheless, it's an impressive beer for the style. In terms of critiquing it, I don't have much to offer. Maybe add some sort of citric hop? I don't know. Nonetheless, it really is good as it is. Definitely worth checking out."
"Dogfish Head My Antonia is a very sparkling, slightly hazy golden lager with a huge, pillowy white head that has outstanding retention and lacing. It has a doughy aroma with a little grass and spice. It's pretty full bodied; lively, but smooth with a really clean, dry finish. It has a simple, well hopped taste. There's a leafy bitterness. It's a little sweet and a little boozy. It goes down real nice."
"S -"
"This is an excellent beer that I liked a lot more than I thought I would. It's a very enjoyable beer to treat yourself to."
"750mL bottle, purchased in Columbus for something like $8. It pours a golden-orange color, slightly hazy with a wet looking foam on top. Very nice aromatics, this definitely has a pilsner base but the hops are amped up big time, not quite the same as Sam Adams Hallertau but maybe a first cousin. Rather than Hallertau hops this has plenty of Saaz style spiciness, also some juicy citrus that I associate more with American IPAs. It tastes very nice, not really a refined pils but rather more of an agressive IPA. Lasting bitterness in the aftertaste but it's a flavorful bitterness so I like it. Creamy mouthfeel, very good match with the flavors, overall an excellent beer. I'd be happy to have it again any time."
"I found this beer extremely drinkable and am looking forward for the next bottle."
"D - Very easy to drink! And I like it!"
"my my my antonia,what a beer,grassy hop flavor.This beer begs to be savored.Clean finish,slightly cloudy brew.Only problem is the price tag,but found them to be much cheAPER IN NY STATE.Wish they would decide to brew this year round.would be nice to get this in 12oz bottles."
" The taste has herbal sweet and lightly malty qualities with low bitterness in the flavor and smooth lemony noble hop accents. The gentle alcohol flavor and spice provides some contrast to the mild honey-like tinge from the malt. There is a mild level of fruitiness and toasted elements in the flavor with hints of floral noble hop tinges throughout. I almost get a sweet golden delicious aspsect from the pils near the finish which is probably yeast derived. I find this to be a wonderful Imperial Pils -a beer I would drink daily if given the chance. It is not boring to me, very flavorful and it fits the style well. I would recommend this to German Pils fans and it went well with my brats with spicy dijon mustard countering the fattiness well."
"VERY well done take on the Imperial Pilsner style here, with a flavorful and nicely balanced character that is driven home by the ridiculously smooth body on this. I initially split this because I thought that it was going to be a warm and overly sweet affair but was pleasantly surprised to find the opposite. Heck, I could have drunk this whole bottle my self! An excellent job by Dogfish Head keeping this one accessible despite the higher ABV."
"Not my favorite style, but usually because tangy lager yeast takes over. There are some notable exceptions that are quite pleasant, and I'd add this one to that list. Crisp and dry, with just a touch of tanginess, and lots of floral and some earthy hops. Pours a pale amber/golden with a somewhat thin head, but some lacing as well. More tanginess in the nose, more hops in the flavor. Quite smooth,very dry, and quite enjoyable."
"D: The beer is rather drinkable because the alcohol is well hidden from the taste."
"D: Easy drinker, very refreshing."
"My Antonia is a nice pilsner from dogfish, but I think I will be sticking to their ales and other offerings."
"Drink- DFH does it again. Off centered ales for off center people. I am beginning to think I am not normal. Not the best pils in the world but still pretty good as its meant to be different"
"M/D: Medium bodied, has a slightly bitter finish, but not a negative at all. Very nice carbonation for a pilsner. Overall very enjoyable, one that I will pick up again for sure."
"D - pretty drinkable, I am beginning to notice a bit of an alcohol finish."
"This is a great beer containing all of the traditional pilsner characteristics, just amplified."
"D-Rather drinkable, nothing out of the ordinary a good example of the style, but there is better."
"Poured from a 750mL bottle into a pint glass. Nice thick one inch head that lasts for about a minute and just leaves its remains on the side of the glass. Smells like bread straight up with a little bit of citrus and hops. Tastes very much like bread as well with some hop flavor that I can't quite put my hands on as well as some lemon and pepper shines through. The alcohol is completely hidden and this is pretty drinkable. I am rating this to its style and I feel that it is one of the best pilsners I have ever had."
"D: Dangerously drinkable pilsner lager at 7.5% ABV, this is the rival to Prima Pils in my mind for Americanized pilsners. Super smooth, well-balanced and drinkable relative to its strength, My Antonia is a brew I'd like to have on hand for any lager-centric crowd I might encounter. A good brew to trump weaker pils or upstage German counterparts."
"Bravo DFH. Its beers like this that keep me from totally ignoring you guys."
"Very drinkable--another good one from Sam and gang."
"D: I'm glad DFH didn't do anything too wacky on this; it's nearly perfect for the style."
"D: Not normally a pilsner fan but this is delicious, recommend it to anyone who likes light beers but wants to up there game, it is a good place to start."
"I really liked this one. I still think Sam Adams has the benchmark in the style, but this is a close second."
"A tasty & hoppy Imperial Pilsner, helped by being a very fresh sample. Alcohol is well hidden making this very drinkable. Nice one, Dogfish Head!"
"D: Goes down nicely, even with food. Enjoy it with some nice bread and olive oil and salt. Mmmm..."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The body of the beer is shy of medium. Nice carbonation helps break up the beers body. Again an excellent play between sweet and dry. This balance is at the crux of the beers excellent drinkability. The beer avoids an alcoholic cough syrup feel and is really a treat."
"750 ml bottle. Served in a pilsner glass, the beer pours a slightly hazy gold color with an inch and a half frothy white head. Head retention and lacing are both pretty good. Aroma is bready malt along with some grassy, spicy and citrusy hops. I think the brew tastes similar to the aroma, but with the addition of a bit of peppery spice. Also, I think the grassy hop and bready malt flavors are the strongest. There's also a good slightly bitter hoppy finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a little bit creamy and has good carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's an easy and enjoyable brew to drink. I think it's a solid overall brew, I'd buy it again in the future."
"Overall: I've always loved hoppy pilsners, yet there is something about My Antonia which just isn't doing it for me. I need to seek out other imperial pilsners for comparison. I'm sure I'll give this another shot sometime in the future."
"This is one well balanced, hoppy, double pilsner."
"Nice medium carbonation avoids being too sparkly. The body is medium and never syrupy. The finish is clean and dry with some malty graininess and mild bitterness lingering. My Antonia is drinkable but nothing exceptional. Pretty nice for an imperial (well crafted and balanced) but I'd like more distinction. Drinkable, especially for the ABV."
"Notes: A fine craft beer from a great craft brewer!"
"There are no surprises with My Antonia, just a really well-crafted representation of the style. Drinkability is done with great ease in general, not to mention the respectably moderate abv. Recommended."
"D: Very tasty, solid hop flavor with being too bitter. Nice."
"That segues conveniently into the ""thesis"" of this review & hence, the style. Kind of an oxymoron to take a style that's all about precision & mutate it, but I like the results, nonetheless. Not hard to drink, but I'm not sure the flavor notes justify the alcohol. It took me a little bit, but I'm feeling this one. Maybe one to share."
"d - dangerously so."
"Pours a hazy golden yellow to straw color with a thick four to five finger head which resedes to a smaller head and leaves rings of lace up and down the glass. The aroma is of big pilsner malt character with a slight citrus smell. The taste is of a nice big pilsner malt backbone with citrus notes and a nice earthy hop balance. The mouthfeel is of a nice carbonation and is slightly creamy. The drinkability is very high, an easy drink along with a great complex flavor."
"D: This beer is very crisp, smooth and very good. It has just the right amount of hops and sweetness, making it a nicely balanced beer. Not surprising from the great DFH brewery."
"Pours a clear straw pale yellow with a billowing, foamy off white head. Leaves decent lacing all the way down. Nose is caramel malts, grassy, yeast. Taste is smooth and balanced; great body of malt character and pale straw grain. Medium bodied, easy drinker all round. No presence of the ABV, I thouroughly enjoyed this brew. Too bad this wasn't available more frequently in 12 oz bottles, tastes like a strong go-to. A top for me in it's style. DFH!"
"Wow. That is all i can say. Murky and yellowish orange pour with lots and lots of head. Smells very hoppy initially with some malt hints. Te head hang around all day! Very smooth and crisp. Light on the pallette and quit drinkable at such a high percentage. Kudos dogfish head!"
"Antonia is a glowing beer, casting a big bright golden color bordering on straw yellow like hay. It's pilsnery with a bright white billowy head that's a inch up with staying power, and sticking power as well. Smell is str8 forward, pilsner malt blasting out the ying yang, knowing dogfish, they used a ton of this variety and it shows in smell and taste. Some tropics and bubblegum as well. This tastes a lot better than many imy pilz out there, they just don't cut the mustard, Antonia gets the job done while remaining in style with a big back. Tastes include pilsner malt up front, light fruits, a nice faint earthy hopping with some tropics (this bottle is about 5 months old at this point). I like how the hay I get in alot of pilsners is muted here. The feel is a nice medium, greatly carbed and lively on the tounge, kinda bitey, not killer though. Gotta knock some points on drinkability as I cant gulp this like a lighter pilsner, It's not a knock on the beer, it tastes good, but not as easy going as most in style. A case purchase would be ideal, if it came in 12oz'ers. I like DFH better when the beer is under 10%, beyond that, things get fishy."
"I suppose what makes the mouthfeel so unique is that it isn't particularly creamy like most imperial pilsners I've sampled. It's easy (and dangerous!) to gulp down. Savor this one or it may bite back!"
"D- as I enjoyed my glass this beer got better and better. Maybe its was some warming, maybe its was me finding this beer, maybe I got a bit of a buzz on, maybe all three. Is it a great pilsner not really but in the imperial way its very good. While it loses some of the subtle complexities of a pilsner it does make up for it in other ways. Cool stuff, real glad I tried it."
"D - Delicious offering from DFH - one of those types you wish would be available more often."
"UPDATE: Not as good in the bottle. But if you find it fresh on tap, go for it."
"D: very, wish it could be a year round beer for dogfish head, would be a everyday beer for me."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. drinkability is decent, the hops were really blended nicely to give it a nice range of flavors. The noble hops aren't my favorite hoppy flavors though so it was a little less drinkable for me personally. overall though it was a really cool beer with a nice range of flavors to it."
"D- Over all a great larger! Has great after taste that fills my mouth with fruity under tones."
"D-the taste stays well. in fact, it starts to taste better and better. i genuinely enjoyed all of this one even though it doesn't blow me away. this was my second bottle and i plan to have more some day."
"Honestly, I expected a little more from this brew. Its well-crafted but a little conservative compared to the rest of the Dogfish Head lineup. Its still worthy of a try. My Antonia is one of the breweries ""Occasional Rarities," so you should definitely pick it up if you come across it because you may not have another chance for a while."
"They should bottle this in 12 ounce bottles, I'd buy it by the case."
"Poured a slightly hazy golden orange color with a thin bright white head. no lacing. aroma. not much. taste is awesome. this is one simple ass beer. you can they used awesome quality ingredients. Perfectly hopped and slightly fruity! perfectly balanced. feel is crisp and tingly."
"Thanks Sam, for all that you do."
"Great job by Dogfish on this one!"
"Extremely drinkable and refreshing. A nice change of pace from IPAs but completely intriguing for hopheads. To me, this is the goal of a good big pilsner, go hops, and mix it up. Well done."
"A nice amped up pilsner. A hybrid, like a cross between a pilsner and an IPA. A very nice one from Dogfish Head."
"This beer is interesting because it is an extremely hoppy interpretation of a style that isn't usually so. There is also a bit too much of an alcohol presence that hurts the drinkability. Not quite balanced enough and the ABV is not well masked. I like both of these breweries so I was excited to try this but it was only average."
"A drink is nicely carbonated like a pilsner, but not quite as dry. Tastes very good 'going down' and a very drinkable beer. I would definitely recommend."
"Overall: WOW!! This beer is another reminder of what a great brewery they have over there in Delaware. This beer is extremely tasty and easy to drink. What a great take on a classic European stlye pilsner. Hoping I can find it on tap someplace in Philly. Cheers!!"
"Drinkability: A truly exceptional pilsner that only further solidifies DFH as one of my favorite breweries. The innovation and care that went into this beer is clearly evident. This is definitely a must-have beers for lovers of pilsners and Dogfish Head's other offerings."
"D: Pretty good overall, easy to drink"
"Notes: I first sampled this beer at the 2010 Americn Craft Beerfest. This time it's from a 1 pint 9.4 fl ounce bottle. Dam this beer is amazing such a great example of a American Double Imperial Pilsner. Cheers."
"M/D - Light carbonated body makes this perfectly refreshing. Too bad I'm drinking it during a blizzard and not a sunny summer brew day. Overall great beer, shared it with some friends and they all like it as well. Totally hides the 7.5% alcohol."
"You get a great amount of sweet and spicy aroma coming from the brew I got some grass and pepper to it along with a nice bready malt. The flavor was malty sweet but had enough hop bitter to be perfectly balanced in my book. If it wasn't for the price tag I'd be drinking more of these. It was medium to light in the mouth with great carbonation. The 22 oz bottle went way to fast I will be looking forward to the next fresh batch I see"
"D - I like this drink, its another great brew from the folks at Dogfish; the flavors are complete from start to finish and its not really missing much"
"im very glad i tried this beer. aggressive american like hop bitterness in the lager style is definatly something we need to see more of. IMHO, recommended."
"This is a tough beer to rate. As a pilsner, imperial or not, it misses the flavor and feel mark. The malt might not be too off since it is an ""imperial version"" of the style but the hops are way off. I don't pick up much in the flavor profile and the flavor lacks an edge. That being said this beer is damn smooth and very tastey, its just a loose interpretation of the style. IMHO an imperial pils is not a style that needs to be made but it had no effect on my rating."
"The beer pours a beautiful gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a clean, pilsner malt scent along with a moderate hop aroma. It's incredibly balanced. The taste is great! It has a smooth pilsner malt flavor, dry and clean; no graininess. The hop character is outstanding. It's aggressively bitter up front with a nice mix of both noble and west coast hops. There is a mild citrus edge along with solid floral character. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking beer. This is an interesting take on the pilsner style; traditional with a nice modern twist."
"A nice amped-up pilsner from DFH here. I haven't had lots of imperial pilsners, but this one seems pretty good for the style. It retains alot of its pilsner character while still cranking up the flavor. It's quite enjoyable overall. I'd get it again if I were in the mood. Recommended."
"750mL bottle with Bottled In 2010 2B. Pours a cloudy golden color with a medium head. Lots of lacing. Aromas of citrus, namely lemon, and a bit of a skunky smell along with cut grass. Tastes like a hopped up pilsner. Lemon peel aftertaste. Mouthfeel is kind of creamy. Overall this is like someone took Miller High Life and added some more hops, flavor and alcohol and put it in a 750mL bottle. A bit pricey for what it is. Decent but I wish I had drank this one in the summer."
"I wanted to like this so much more, and it's really not a bad beer by any means, but I do think that DFH missed the mark here. A pilsener with American hops isn't really a pilsener at all. The pilsener malt base is shattered by the amped up bitterness, and at the end of the day I'd feel a lot more comfortable calling this some flavor of IPA. I haven't rated it lower for that reason. Maybe it's a double pils for hopheads who don't love pilseners. I do love pilseners, and hops as well, but I don't think this particular marriage quite works. Not for me, at least."
"This is well done. A hoppy and sweet pilsner."
"Pours a semi clouded golden haziness, full on creamy textured off white head. Lacing forms fine and speckled down the sides of my chalice. Aromatics first address my nares with grapefruit/citric rinds, herbal/grassy qualities and a touch of booze reaching my senses. Overall an intense hoppiness is brewing even before I taste it. Flavor is abrasively bitter initially as it warms up and the malts open up a bit the pilsner malt adds enough sweetness to dance around a bit with the malts. True perfect balance between malts and hops never occurs this is a hop odyssey, continuously hopped imperial pils. Grapefruit/bitter rinds, herbal grassiness big booze and sugary malts hit altogether on the palate with no real direction. A lot of big hitters show up with no clear leader to choreograph what happens on the palate. Overall mouthfeel is big a bit heavy, carbonation is kicking. Super bitterness with a wave of booze and malt bringing the finish amongs the big hop bomb of a beer this is. Is it the West Coast hop additions that make this beer pretty hard to handle, I like west coast hops but I'm not sure about them in a pilsner malt profile. Drinkability takes some getting used to, it grew on me as I sipped and temperature change had a big effect on my overall opinion of this offering. Under attenuated the yeast didn't fully perform here, a pils that finishes this sweet didn't ferment out all the way, I'm glad they didn't dump this one. Experimental style I've been drinking their different versions of this from Prescription Pils, to Golden Shower, to Golden Era, back around to the collaboration with the Italian brewer that brings us this bottled release My Antonia is better than earlier attempts at an Impy Pils, but keep striving for perfection because we're not there yet, at least in this newly bottled big bottle release."
"Cheers."
"Taste has a very pronounced yeasty banana taste. There is a very crisp mix of hops over clean grains - the taste is a bit stronger than a classic pilsner, but the pronouncements of flavor are the yeast and hops much more than the malt. Mouthfeel is very crisp and smooth with some thickness from the yeast and bite from the hops. Very drinkable for a beer of its strength and style."
"Very drinkable. Very good beer, but nothing really memorable about it."
"D: A good, solid, drinkable beer."
"A good drinker. Pleasant taste and a great aroma. A very happy encounter."
"The only gripe is carbonation. Regardless, this is an interesting take on an uniquely Americanized version of the standard pilsner. Worth it if you like SA Imperial Pilsner and others."
"D: Solid. Slickness slows it down a bit."
"very drinkable"
"And we have a gusher! I was shocked by that. My puppy got to try it and apparently he thought it was pretty good by the looks of the floor. It poured a murky, honey like yellow with a three finger spongy white head. It smells better than I thought it would, being a pilsner. It smells of honey cream and is very light on the hops. The taste too is light and has light honey cream accents to it. I surprisingly like it. It has the typical ultra smooth mouthfeel typical of DFH 750mls and is also pretty crisp as well. It's very drinkable, especially for the style. This is one pilsner I'm a fan of."
"I don't know how Dogfish pulled it off..."
"M: good, lightly carbonated, alcohol is hidden well. Could drink this all night!"
"Medium bodied a tad dry and bitter. The ABV is hidden well and has great drinkability. I will definitely stop by to pickup more."
"D - This is quite good. I'd really love to try this fresh to see how much impact the hop aroma had. But it's an enjoyable, well-crafted pilsner. One of the better Dogfish Head beers for certain."
"Reviewed from some notes I took last night. Poured this into a pint glass. The body is a slightly hazy straw color with a white fluffy head about two fingers large and soapy lace. The smell is very grainy with a slight lemon zest and a slightly bitter hop finish. The pallet follows the nose nicely. Big grains and horsefeedy flavors with a tart twinge and bitter finish. The mouthfeel is kind of buttery with good carbonation and a light body. When it comes to pilsners unless they are terrible they always rank high on drinkability for me. Probably one of my favorite styles to drink."
"So, I don't, personally, want to drink this all of the time, but, as far as pilsners go, I could drink this one. It's not the one to win me over, but it will get me to come visit from time-to-time."
"Guess I have to say that this is a quintessential Imperial Pils. Not perfectly pleased with it, but that's splitting hairs a bit. Anyway: Poured a large, foamy, frothy, off white head that doesn't give up and lots of lace. Color is hazy dirty amber. Aroma is floral, malt, perfume, spice, caramel. Body is ok and so is carbonation. Finish is like flavor and a bit boozy. If this beer didn't try so hard, it might be a lot better. Still damn good."
"Taste begins sweet, goes lightly fruity in the middle, and closes with moderate bitterness and delicate floral flavors. Mouthfeel is very smooth, and drinkability is nice as well. Interesting brew that exhibits artful use of hopping."
"CHEERS"
"At any rate, poured into a chalice. A hazy straw color with not much of a head that dissipated into a thin filmy head that results in very nice lace. Not a very strong smell, but faint hints of lemon grass. A substantial flavor, especially for the style of beer--probably because it's an imperial--that has a bit more hop character than expected, with some pepper spices on the finish. A pretty smooth beer with good carbonation. A dangerously drinkable beer for the ABV."
"Drinkability for this 7.5%, continuously-hopped, Imperial Pilsner is through the roof. You can use this bottle split amongst friends or quaff back on during a game. Just another kudos to Sam and his amazing crew at DFH."
"drinkability: nice beer, great story, honored to drink. just not a beer I would drink often"
"Drinkability: Overall a decent take on a style that Dogfish Head usually doesn't do. I would have given it a higher drinkability rating if it wasn't so sweet."
"D: I was a bit disappointed. Since I discovered this brew, I have heard and read nothing but rave reviews about it. To be fair, I may have let this one sit on my shelf for a bit too long (2 months), so I would be more than happy to give this one another go. Rumor has it that this brew has almost completed its run and will not return."
"Drinkability is rather high, thanks to the clean, crisp taste and mouthfeel and lightish body. Very easy drinking, as is to be expected from a pilsner. Definitely could have knocked back more, but still happy that I shared it with a fellow BA."
"Mouthfeel was very carbonated like the usual pilsner. Light-bodied, crisp and light. Drinkability is good; it's dumb easy to drink this, although the 7.5% will really catch on to you quickly. If this was canned and sold as six-packs, this beer would be dangerous!"
"Mostly clear solid yellow with a huge, puffy white head that extends beyond the limits of the glass. Smells of sweet pale malt, lemon, and leafy, floral hops...a little stickier than in a typical pils. A hefty amount of pilsner malt sweetness followed by a peppery, juicy citrus hop bitterness. It actually pulls off being crisp and pretty drinkable like a pilsner should, despite the ""Imperial"" factor, which is admirable. A little heavy feeling for my liking, but it stays in the medium-bodied range and has a prickly carbonation and dryish finish. Not really a favorite style of mine, but this is a pretty successful example."
"Highly carbonated, the body seems thinner than it should be. Still, this feels creamy to the tongue. A good start with pale grain flavors; begins dry. The hop is quite powerful, particularly in the swallow and the very long aftertaste--peppery. Notable alcohol in the finish."
"I snagged a couple of 22 for the road after a daytime trip to the DFH brew pub in Rehobeth. Had it on vacation in OCMD, so I was in a particularly good mood while drinking it. This beer proved to me that a Pilsner can taste good. Poured a great head, left lacing around the glass for the duration of the experience. Really could taste and smell earthy hops; I was actually grabbing bits of the head off the top and chewing on them it was so good. I really recommend this one."
"D: Really impressed with this. I think I like this version a little bit more for no other reason than it is fresher. They should make this a regular release and last I hear they were. RIP Golden Shower."
"I've had quite a few impy pilsners this season and this one is decent but not one of the best. Still good."
"Damn, this is awesome. I'd say it's like the lager cousin of 60 min IPA. It's very hoppy and bitter but also super well balanced - it's got a very nice caramel backbone that's a bit odd for a pilsner, but damn does it work. The alcohol is a bit present but the hops do a good job covering it up, there's a nice chewiness to it as well which reminds me of many of the German lagers i had in München. Very tasty and easy drinking, glad I picked this up!"
"Nice job DFH. Don't be afraid to try more lagers!"
"Drinkability is exceptional, and it was a REAL good price point where I got it. Fantastic value for the money."
"Drinkability is ok. Low abc but sticky sweetness and a little astringency."
"I shared this with a couple other BAs and we were all surprised at how good this was. I thought the carbonation was a little much, but other than that good stuff."
"D: I would love to try My Antonia when it's extremely fresh. Unfortunately, bottles either flew off the shelves too fast, or it didn't make it to PA, cause I didn't see any. Drinks very well, and I can only imagine that it drinks better the younger it is. Very nicely done."
"This is a style I'm all for, and My Antonia is one of the best I've had yet. DFH could have easily called this a Belgian-style Imperial Pilsner, as it shares many characteristics with that country's medium-strength pales."
"Notes: Hmmm, one of the recent DFH takes that is gathering less attention, and while not brutally outstanding it is rather remarkable and pleasing."
"I wish this beer came in six-packs. I would buy all of them. Even if you aren't a fan of pilsners, you should give this one a shot (it just might change your mind)."
"Flavor has a nice spice character with a lemon and pepper background. Offers a full feel and a moderate grainy texture, a good carbonation and a smooth drink. Very nice"
"M-D- Medium bodied with a proper amount of carbonation. Juicy with a quick dry finish and minimal aftertaste. 750 was just a little too much for me, but like a champion I conquered another DFH beast with a smile and poise that payed off."
"This is a light bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. Not only is the carbonation visible from bubbles continuously rising from the bottom of the glass, but it is prickly on the tongue. Overall quite drinkable, about the only complaint is that the alcohol creeps up with this offering."
"D - Extremely drinkable, wish they would have released this closer to june or july, would have been nice on a hot day, very refreshing"
"MF/D- Medium bodied, with a generous amount of carbonation to make it jump around on your tongue. Drinkability could be better if it wasn't for that damn apple taste in the finish. That being said, I thought this was an excellent pilsner from an ale centered brewery."
"Overall: I like this beer very much. Maybe one of the best made European-tasting pilsner I've had made domestically."
"Overall, I like this one but wish it was more of a Pilsner and less pale."
"D- This beer is one to remember in its excellent Pilsner qualities pushed to the limits of outright perfection. I do believe that if i see this one again i will buy it."
"A very interesting beer."
"Overall I would say this is the best NEW beer DFH has done in years. I haven't been impressed with a lot of there new stuff and I was starting to lose a bit of faith in DFH. This was a great beer in particulary based on the style. My scores don't really reflect how good this was. I felt I had to give low marks for smell as it was nothing great."
"My Antonia.... I will have to look in to the origins behind that name at some point. Anyway, it pours out a clear golden color, with a perfect two fingers of frothed heading that lasts till the very end. This is definitely one of the best looking beers I have run in to recently. Grapefruit and other citrus hops in the nose here, coming off potent but clean at the same time. I also get some prickly pear and cucumber as well. More of the same from the taste. It would have been easy to just make this a hop bomb of a Pilsner, but instead they made something that is well hopped, but balanced and drinkable. The body is right there in the middle, not too big and not too small for an imperial version of this style. Having had their other big Pils beers, (Golden Shower/Era) this one stands alone as my favorite. DFH is known for going over the top with their brews. In this case, they showed a bit of refinement I think. By far one of their best. Cheers"
"This beer poured a clear golden color with a nice fluffy head, lots of lacing. The head and lacing were very impressive. The nose had some earthy hops notes that were hard to detect, pilsner malt was also present. The taste was very pleasant. Hops are very present, they begun with a slight tropical edge and were followed by a smooth transition into the bittering hops which left hop resin on the palate; it was well balanced by the malts. The carbonation levels were decent. Overall, this was a very good Imperial Pils, the others that I have had were way to sweet and had a syrupy feeling that really distracted from the overall enjoyment of the beer."
"i have become a HUGE del Borgo fan lately, so i was stoked to see this collaboration. i had it on tap at max's italian fest in baltimore (one of the most impressive tap lists i've ever seen that day by the way) and thoroughly enjoyed it, so I had to pick up a bottle when i saw it. golden with a white head that holds very well, diminishing to a thin layer with big, chunky islands floating around. nose is minty, spicy earthy piney hop followed by a kind of strange mix of caramel and pilsner style malts that kind of works here to produce a kind of bubblegummy thing that harmonizes well with the hops. taste is mostly quasi-bitter piney, grapefruit rind and the spicy-toasty-breadyness of the pilsner malt, with the sweetness of caramel malt poking it's head out and giving the beer a rounder feel and taste. pretty full, very soft mouthfeel with a good amount of heat and bitter in the finish. good amount of carbonation, but it gets lost a little bit with the viscosity going on here. hate to say it, even though i gave this one good marks, i think i'll stick to del borgo. this just didn't leave me wanting more."
"D: Has a Abv of 7.5% but it is very easy to drink, can't really tell, wish it was around 9%. It is a very well rounded imperial pilsner and would recommend it to others."
"D: light enough that its quite easy to drink, but enough flavor that you only need to sip it."
"Pours a slightly-hazed golden color with a big, white head. Good amount of lacing after the head finally recedes. Good spicy, earthy hops aromas with some grain in the background. The grain takes over a bit more with the taste, but hop notes definitely still present. Fairly thick body, and along with that comes a good alcohol kick, although nothing too substantial. Very nice and clean. Great hot weather beer."
"Overall very enjoyable and something I'll most likely buy again."
"D: Drinks bigger then its 7.5%abv would indicate. Warming, spicy with generous amounts of hops and dry grainy palate gives this a definite chance of repeatability."
"Medium body and prickly. Would like to see this a little smoother. Overall though, I found it rather easy to drink and really enjoyed this take on an imperial pilsner."
"Reading the other reviews I wonder if something went awry with my batch. Only DKter's review below sounds at all like the beer I tried."
"This Imperial Pilsner is a far cry from the mass-produced American lagers, but not quite on the level of most DFH beers. There's a funky and bitter floralness to the flavor I didn't enjoy tasting as much as I enjoyed the smell. Points for uniqueness, but I won't be seeking this one out again."
"D - Super drinkable due to it's pilsner, lager characteristics. Not hugely drinkable because it's over 7%. Bottom line, this beer is really good....pick it up!!! I will again!"
"d- great, i was suprised when my cousin pulled this bad boy out of the cooler. one 750ml just wasn't enough, really tasty - i would definately drink this again, i just hope i can get my hands on some more. kudos yet again go to the dogfish."
"d: this is a nice offering from Dogfish, definitely a different Pilsner beast; i would liken it perhaps to an Incredible Hulk of pilsners. It may not be green, but it does have alot more bite, more bulk, and a great taste. This is lawnmower beer on DFH steroids...definitely a winner and one I'll drink again."
"Overall, a great beer and I will be looking to have this one again."
"Pours gold with alot of yeast with a thick white head. Smell is intensely hoppy. Taste is intensely hoppy, one of the hoppiest pilsners I've encountered. The beer is highly bubbly too which makes it nice. I find it very drinkable for a pilsner, I'd recomend it to anyone looking for a bubbly yet strong beer."
"Had this one on tap at the DFH Alehouse in Falls Church, VA, outside of DC on the bartender's recommendation. Really enjoyed it. A really nice crisp double pilsner that definitely reminded me of their now defunct Golden Shower/Era. Noble hops all over the place, nice light fruitiness with a quiet balancing malt backbone. Would definitely grab this one again if I found it."
"This beer is as good as an IPA and a pilsner can be in my opinion, like a sexy Czech exchange student visiting Pacific Beach."
"Definitely good beer, but something I think I'll need to drink again (and maybe next to a regular pilsner) to really appreciate all the complexities. A 750 ml just wasn't enough."
"Beer is medium bodied and quite good. Strong pilsner malt flavors and really quite bitter. There are decent earthy hop flavors in the midpalate and moderate sweetness at the front. Drinkability good except i'm super tired."
"Bought it at Total Wines in North Miami. Served into my Delirium Tulip. My Antonia, a novel from 1918 that focus on a Bohemian Family. Yes, this is a drink for you bohemians. Did you ever wanted to drink a Pilsner with more alcohol, hoppy and with a creamy head? This is it, a great mixture that Dogfish Head has created for us."
"D - Quite simply this is a solid and very enjoyable Pilsner... I'm not typically a huge fan of the style, but found this offering rewarding... Quite restrained by Dogfish Head standards... Woudl recommend and welcome in my glass in teh future..."
"POured from 750 ml bottle to dfh pint glass. pours transparent yellow , taste medium body alcohol is well hidden. you can really taste grassy hops and pilsner malt. Smell of cut grass good old noble hops. i can drink this all day mowing my lawn. I be hammered but happy. Cheers BA"
"My Antonia is a good beer from Dogfish Head, with a really cool label and presented in a 750 magnum. The beer is pretty with a shiney golden hue and a full head. The smell is mostly malty with a bit of herbal and woody noble hop. The taste is sweet and thick with a good dose of bittering. The mouthfeel is thick from the ample amounts of dextrin malt flavor. To me, the beer is a bit too thick to be any version of a pilsner, which should be light and crisp. I enjoyed the beer, but for the price I don't think I would seek out any more."
"The beer is almost creamy in feel, having more body than most Euro-pilsners. The bitterness of the hops has a quick attack and then backs off and allows you to enjoy all the flavors. This is a complex beer that makes you work a little, so it takes a hit on drinkability. It's not one that I'm going to use to slake my thirst and also a beer that see me open a second in the same sitting. It is one that I will get again for when I want to savor a beautiful conflagration of German and American elements in a phenomenal pislner."
"Color is an effervescent, clear gold with a massive, dense off white head. Excellent retention and light lacing; this beer looks very appealing. Aroma is mildly boring blend a pale malts, green apples, faint hops and lingering booze. Flavor starts initially overly sweet, witha strong malt body and ripe fruit flavors before the dry, exceptionally hoppy finish. The finish is lacking any dryness or crispness associated with the style and has an unpleasantly strong alcohol burn. The mouthfeel starts extremely thick and almost syrupy before some mild carbonation settles in with the bitterness from hops. I always enjoy the Sam Imp Pils, but sadly this was a letdown, particularly in the finish and composition; regardless I'll still give this another try as it seems promising."
"Picked up a 22 of this at DFH Milton. Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Beer Glass, whatever they call that new one with the curves and laser etch in the bottom. Thick white head that dissipated quickly, but throughout the beer a thin white head lasted. The ale appears hazy at first and becomes clear later in the glass, pretty unusual. Has a very nice color, very golden. Smelled just like it tasted, like a super hoppy pilsner. Smells like fresh hops, citrus and some grass. Tastes like a prime example of a pilsner, with a huge load of hops dumped in(dry hopped or continuously hopped?). I'm not a huge fan of pilsners but I liked the Sam Adams Imperial Pilsner, so I gave this a shot since I trust DFH with any style of beer. Well they didn't let me down. I really enjoyed this beer. It's just not something I will seek out or miss that I can't get. It a really good example of the style though. Hides the fact that it is 7.5% very well. This is a very drinkable beer, The hops are definitely the star in this brew, but don't over dominate the taste. It's kind of like a stepping stone for people wanting to warm up to IPA's. I could really see this being sold in six packs and becoming a popular offering. It's just not my cup of tea. But I would recommend it anyone."
"overall as solid as they come. i did not know what to expect here, but damn this one was good. would do it again in a heart beat."
"A very good lager from an ale-centric brewery."
"Taste is light and crisp for an imperial pilsner, the hops meld well with the malt with neither overshadowing the other, finishes a bit spicy."
"D - If it weren't 7.5%, you could have this one while mowing the lawn. Has a good amount of taste, but isn't over done."
"Pours a brilliant yellow with some carbonation turbulence and a huge rocky snow white head. Light floral esters, mint leaves, fresh cut red apple, grass and a hint of soap. Light and balanced with a generous amount of crystal malt to hold up to the heavy handed hoppy bite which is mid to late palate. More on the dry side than the rest of the options in the style usually display. Perfect texture, crisp enough with a great amount of carbonation, no offensive alcohol note to speak of. Extremely well done, this one changes my view on the Imperial Pils style completely."
"Why have it from the bottle when you can get it from the tap? Water, beer, the conventional wisdom holds for both. Besides, Willa Cather references were meant to be sampled from a tap. Prove me wrong, kids. This guy (or is it gal?) pours a clear semi-amber straw topped off by light bit of white micro-foam. It ain't much to look at, but, then again, most pilsners aren't. The nose comprises plenty o' hops, a slight tinniness, and wheat. The taste holds notes of light wheat, a very light tin (that ol' pils taste...maybe it's just me?), and plenty o' hoppy bitterness. The body is light, with light carbonation and a nicely crisp finish. I may not be much of a pils fan, but if they were all like this one, I might not be so negative toward them."
"Pour gently or you'll get a third of the glass filled with delicate, openly knit pure white head, for as soapy as the foam is, good retention with lacing which looks like fake snowflakes dotting the glass sides. Bright orange color, deep enough to have a light bronzed look, transparent with widely spread, if fast moving, bubbles within. Noticeably sweet nose emphasizing tangerine and pink grapefruit citrus, buttressed by peach, apricot fruit, pine cone and fresh rose petals, hardly any bready or doughy notes, slightly more wheat or simple grain, if you think about it being labeled a pilsner you can kind of see it but if someone just handed you a glass of it, pilsner would unlikely be the guess. Medium-bodied, the carbonation is light with a slow churn which keeps the liquid sticky and pressing down on the palate. More general maltiness here, same for pretzel dough and wheat. Yet, still insufficient to match up with all that sweet orange, tangerine, pink grapefruit citrus as well as golden honey notes. Robust apricot, peach, nectarine fruit with a slice of pineapple. Big florality, pretty and matches the creaminess of the overall mouth feel. Heaviness detracts from refreshing factor, however, no denying the vivacious richness of the base flavors."
"D - Oh yeah, go for this one..."
"Extremely easy to drink if the bitterness doesn't bother you. A great bargain big beer for this summer."
"I enjoyed this on tap at Quotations in Media, arriving at my table in a wine glass. A thick, pillowy head graced the brew. Golden color with a bit of haze. Wonderful nose, very malty with herbal notes and the promise of its 7.5% ABV. Malty, fruity taste up front with a big hop finish. Very nice flavor ride transitioning through esters into bitterness. Each sip demanded attention, such were the tastes. Creamy mouthfeel, more than I'd expect from a pilsener. I must admit the Imperial Pilsener is new to me. If My Antonia is representative of the breed count me as a supporter. Eminently drinkable. Not a beer to hurry through."
"d - A pretty nice pilsner. Easy to drink and would try again."
"Pours very clear yellow with a vast fluffy white head. The aroma is clean and pilsnery, with a sharp hop sting. The flavor is too hot, with a huge hop blast wiping out the crispness of the pilsner malt. Strange and extreme, though not entirely unpleasant. The finish is large, bitter, almost sour. The mouthfeel is thick and prickly."
"The beer pours a hazy yellow color with a white head. The aroma is grain with some perfume hops and orange citrus notes. The flavor is pilsener malt with some lemon. Low to medium bitterness. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A pretty good Imperial Pilsener."
"750 ML bottle from Pinocchios into a Pilsener glass. Pours a lemon color with a small head that gradually diminishes into a coating. Lacing is thin but lasts throughout. Nose is some citrus and herbal hops, grassy notes and some nuttiness. Taste is lemongrass, citrus, bready malt, and some honey. There is some nice bitterness in the end but sweetness is what you are left with. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium, creamy and ample carbonation. You notice the alcohol but it is something that adds rather than detract. This is really refreshing and something I would seek out again."
"D- Overall, this is one of the better Dogfish Head beers I've tried. It isn't the biggest or most extreme beer in the DFH arsenal but a well-crafted hoppy lager. Wish there were more breweries making these kinds of beers. Recommended!"
"D- really impressed with this pilsner...kind of surprising to hear me say that after striking out with most beers in this style; it's an imperial version, which usually makes everything taste better so maybe thats the reason; whatever it is it's an easy to drink summer beer that should be regularly produced as a summer seasonal or at least a regular 750ml occasional offer"
"D - I had this beer (well, the Italian version of it) on tap last year and I was interested to see how this new, bottled version stacked up. I was a bit disappointed in the aroma as it seemed much more subdued than I remember the original being, lacking the complex, herbal hop notes, though it does have the same sweet, rich malt character. Since the aroma was not as good as the original, I was worried that the flavor might disappoint as well, but it was not so. The rich, doughy malt was still present and the hops came to life much more than they managed to in the aroma. The pithy, juicy grapefruit notes that I recalled from last December were all there along with a herbal juniper note and balancing honey malt. While this batch may lack a little of the depth of aroma that the previous one exhibited, it is still an unusually delicious beer and certainly up there with Sam Adams Hallertau Imperial Pilsner as a fantastic example of this often poorly interpreted style."
"This is the best pilsner I have ever had, I know it is a Imperial Pilsner, but damn. This is an awesome brew, so happy I picked a bottle up on a whim at the DFH restaurant as I left."
"Poured this into a pilsner glass. Nice foamy light head with a solid golden hue and good carbonation. The aroma is faint with some earthy grass notes, but nothing that stands out. The flavor is a full bodied, smooth, pilsner that has a good balance, maybe too good for a pilsner. There isn't any crisp or sharp bite to the brew that you look for in a pilsner, but the taste is still great just not to style IMO. The body is full and the brew is smooth. I would drink this one whenever it is on the table."
"A very nice, refreshing beer for the summer. Nice to see DFH go outside the box yet again, this time with a nice, robust lager. Very tasty stuff, another triumph from DFH."
"Mouthfeel is a little dry but it's typical for Pilsners."
"D- Easy to drink and a very nice beer. I would love it if this was easier to find. I am very happy that I was able to get a bottle, but would like it if I could get one in a local store instead of having to drive 90 miles to the brew pub!"
"It's VERY much like an IPA but its not. It's it's own tasty creation, and one that I'll have to try and brew on my own it's so good."
"750mL bottle into a Duvel tulip pours a crisp light orange with a nice frothy off-white head that lasts as a thin layer and leaves nice lacing on the glass. Aroma is citrus hops just in front of sweet malts, quite fragrant. The taste is an interesting malt profile with a nice hop kick to it, there is a nice subtle lingering bitter hop finish. The beer is medium bodied and smooth and well carbonated. This is another great, unique brew from Dogfish Head."
"Note: this is the 2010 release brewed by Dogfish Head in Delaware, not the 2008 Birra del Borgo-DFH collaboration brewed in Italy. I'd imagine the two are very similar beers, if not the same recipe. But, they should be separate listings because they are brewed at two entirely different locations."
