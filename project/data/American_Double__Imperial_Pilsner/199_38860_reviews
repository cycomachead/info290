"Not the best Ballast Point has to offer but still a dang good beer"
"Very nice IPL.  There are better ones from Jack's Abby but this is very good."
""
""
"I enjoyed this beer a lot - the hops were much stronger than I expected. I enjoyed the subtle, fleeting sweetness in the aftertaste. Pretty dry and bitter finish but it worked very well in my opinion. The smell was pretty thin, but I would prefer this beer over most lagers."
""
""
""
"An interesting take on a style I have had limited exposure to where all previous versions have had somewhat similar profiles.  I didn't love everything about this brew, but the grand total has it as one to have again."
""
""
"This is an easy drinker despite its 7.0% abv.  I would say they generally achieved their goal of making a bottom fermented IPA.  I would recommend giving it a try."
"Love this beer. No better bomber for the price. Go to fave."

"The pine is strong in this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"There is a hop to malt ratio of about 60-40 if I was to take a guess. The citrus and pine hops lead the way but the underlying roasted malt/bread character can also be found. Lingering bitterness at the end.  Nicely done."
"O - Sneaky. Seem like a beer you could drink all day, but I doubt that would be a good idea!"
""
"I really like what Ballast Point makes and this is just another great to add to the list. Not too heavy, not too light. I could host a BBQ and drink quite a few of these."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – A rather nice and tasty IPL with a nice mix of tropical fruits, bready tastes and a decent hop blend.  A rather nice drinking IPL overall."
"Overall - I wish it contained a bit more of a flavor transition toward the finish, but a good beer nonetheless."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Fairly good, though it is probably not something I would search out."
""
""
""
"Never a bad choice. Never the best choice. Good all around."
"22oz into pint. This is as advertised. The aroma and citrus-pine elements found in a well made IPA, but with the crisper, biscuity malt tones and mouthfeel found in a lager. My first hoppy lager, so I have little to go on. Did indeed enjoy it and will purchase again as my hop addiction has me having a difficult time making a true foray into lagers just yet."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  not bad at all, but it drinks like a hi-test beer; sweet and a bit alcoholey, as the style tends to be."
""

"Overall, not bad, but I was expecting Dissenter, so I was a little let down."

"Really liked this blend of IPA and Lager to create the IPL.  Liked better than then plain lager or IPA, worth a try for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Didn't really have high expectations for this one given the style and that this bottle is less than fresh, but I have to say I was quite pleasantly surprised."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Excellent IPL. They made a Lager to be much more fun and it does feel cleaner than an IPA. I wonder of what type of yeast they used. This is superbly well balanced and surprisingly citrusy; they really managed well its hop profile. Worth it trying and sure I wouldn’t mind to seek it again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Easy to drink, light malt and citrus."
""
"Not my favorite beer. I liked Samuel Adams IPL, but this missed big time. The malt character truly beat the hops. This was a true resin filled IPA/IPL, and not in a good way. Overall this was disappointing."

"Overall - One of the better IPL's I've had to date. For the price I paid, it's well worth a few more trips ""into the Fathom""."
""

"This is a crisp beer. Definitely a lager or pilsner style beer. Color is light copper color, very similar to Yuengling really. Not a malt bomb but not really hoppy either. It was labeled as a IPA style lager. I don't detect that much hop in the flavors. Maybe I have had too many true IPA's but this one is not hoppy at all. It is very much a lager. I won't go through a full review. I will say that its a decent beer but like so many craft breweries that make stuff that is away from a good IPA or Stout that they are known for it just is not worth the price difference. When you can get a 12 pack of adjunct lager 12 oz cans for maybe a couple of bucks more. Like I said this beer reminds me a lot of Yeungling and was only two dollars less than the local grocery chain has a 12 pack on sale for this week."

"Poured into a standard pint, this is a medium amber colored beer with a modest head. The nose offers plenty of hops, as expected, but also a nice clean malt aroma. The flavor mirrors this, with a great balance of toasty malt and sharp, bitter hoppiness. Very drinkable hoppy malty lager, like a hoppy octoberfest!"
""
""
"Purchased this at BEVMO in a 22oz bomber and am anxious to try it. Poured a straw gold with a decent head. The aroma is a combo of resinous hops and sweet malt. The taste is a replica of the nose, but the flavors are a bit more intense than the aroma would suggest--the piney hops flavor was most prominent. I was pleasantly surprised that there was a good malt character to the brew. The finish, as typical with lagers, was very clean. Overall, it was a flavorful, well-balanced brew. I wish I could find a six-pack!"

"Again, not sure if the IPL style is a common offering; however, highly recommend those who like IPAs / Pale Ales seek this out. Ballast Point doesn't disappoint (disclaimer: biased towards SD beers)"

"O: A really good beer. A lager with a west coast IPA taste. Nicely hopped but not overpowering. I'll have another..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A crisp, clean strong lager. Nicely hoppy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A very tasty beer that is all IPA except using slightly cleaner lager yeast that imparts less fruit esters and complexities. Still very doughy and sweet, the hops completely carry this beer on its shoulders into a good level."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Overall an idea to have a clean version of IPA that makes you have more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I guess I prefer IPAs. If this were top fermented, I think it would have been an A- or an A. Overall, though, it was decent. I can kind of see why the style is growing in popularity, but Im not into it just yet."
"Would buy again and serve to friends"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Was expecting something boring, but this is an excellent beer and I will be buying it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - While I personally love hops I hate overly bitter beers. This gives me the best of both worlds. It's a hoppy beer for sure and I really enjoy it. The cost point is outstanding at $4.99 a bomber. It's not the easiest beer to find. I've had it both on tap and in the bottle and have never been disappointed."
""
""
"This is a my second ""IPL"" and this has changed my view of what the style can be. Great offering by Ballast Point."
""
""
"O: Overall a delightful beer. Very much like an IPA"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a great twist! Pours from the tapas nice golden amber with a lacy head that dissipates somewhat quickly. Smells floral and citrusy with pine notes. Tastes of grapefruit, pith, a bit of salt, and some bell pepper. Finishes cleaner than most IPAs, with only a little stickiness and a creamy citrus aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
""
"B-"
""
""
""

"I like this beer way more than the avg rating. I'm blown away by the Abu dant, clean hop profiles accompanied by the pilsner like body. Nailed it."
"o: this is my first IPL. after drinking, i can understand why this style is on the rise. the lager qualities harmonize with the hops to cut some bitterness and provide an extremely refreshing, clean, crisp, and juicy beer. definitely would recommend"
"O: more of a lager than an IPA, would have liked to see the hops being more present and pronounced. Maybe a wet-hopped variant?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: malt character is very sweet, crisp, and clean, hops are very aggressive and quite bitter"
""
""
"O - A great IPL. Never had one of this style, but enjoy it. Great summer brew I would imagine, though its January and its still great."
"Overall: I have been spoiled by Jack's Abby and while this is good, it is nowhere close"

"90/100"
""
""
""
""
"O: I liked this lager because it showcased the citrusy flavors of the hops but wasn't that bitter and didn't have the bite or crispness you get from ales. As such, it has good drinkability."

"O: Not bad, but inferior to several other so-called IPLs I've had lately. It's lacking a big enough hop punch, and the body seems thin. Still, nothing I'd council someone to avoid particularly. Rather, one to check off the list and move on."
""
""
"Yellow / amber color with a very good sized off white head that recedes away. Steady streams of carbonation and thin lacing on the glass. Awesome smell to this beer! Very hop forward aroma sweet delicious citrus and pine resin. Just the slightest bit of pale malt coming through as it warmed but I am comfortable saying this brew basically smells of nothing but sweet delicious hops. Hell yeah! The taste of this beer is also very hoppy. Piney and grassy characteristics with a good amount of hop bitterness. This is quite a tasty brew but it is not particularly balanced. There is not enough malt backbone to support the intense hop presence in this beer. That being said, that is kind of the point of this beer; to showcase the hops on a clean base that you don't really notice. In this sense they succeeded but the whole idea is fundamentally flawed. However, I personally prefer beers that are overly hoppy as opposed to overly malty so i dont really mind that this beer is unbalanced and this is a flaw that is in someways appealing and it sets this beer apart. Overall this is not a Ballast Point masterpiece but it is damn good. Absolutely something to check out if you like hops and like IPAs that aren't too malty. I will buy this brew again."
""
""
""
"A little disappointed with this one. The aroma is the best factor, mostly, because it reminds me of Campari."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I like it more with each sip and am surprised it is even close to 7%, it drinks so smoothly and is very crisp. Delivers nice hops but doesn't try too hard, very clean base."
""
""
""
"THE cleanest, tastiest example I've had of this stuff thus far."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Can Raul get a ""yeah buddy!""?"
""
""
"Overall: A nice and hoppy lager with some bitterness in the end. IPL are becoming more popular with myself more and more."
""
""
""
"O: I wonder what the hop bill on this bad boy is. It reminds me a lot of Stone 17th Anniversary. Like, a lot. Still, this one could use some ""cleaning out"". Reminds me too much of an ale, and misses on the clean/refreshing side."
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste starts with crisp bitter floral hops and grass, then bread orange and pine. Has a very floral earthy piney and minty finish with a bit of orange and straw. Has average body with a bit of chewiness, above average carbonation, very creamy and bready."
""
""
""
"O: Great brew from Ballast Point! Crisp and refreshing! Perfect for a summer day. More ale like but still has that lager finish. Excellent version of the style!"

"Another pleasing brew from Ballast Point."
""
""
"Really really good. Bitterness isn't that of an IPA but hop flavors is. Beautiful ipa hop flavors with incredibly clean attributes, a crisp, solid and grainy malt bill. Sweet dry cereal grains up front followed by the faintest note of underlying fruitiness, big tropical fruit hop punch, citrus and grapefruit, touch of pineapple with a bit of pine. Finishes super clean with a resinous and drying bitterness. Medium bodied with brisk carbonation. This beer should be the epitome of this newly popular style. Delicious, clean, solid malt, bright hop, and balanced with lingering bitterness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall ok but do much for me, pretty much no lager character either."
"medium in body with high carbonation, creamy mouthfeel with a dry finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a bright, clear, golden blonde coloring with a filmy, clingy, white surface coat of head. Aromas of toasted grains, floral hops highlights with a bitter, resiny undertone, and some grassy highlights. Flavors of toasted grains, peppery dry hops characters, and some buttery highlights. Light, crisp body, with a dry endfeel. Toasty and bitter resiny hops in the aftertase. Very drinkable and very refreshing."
"Poured into a becker a clear rich burnt orange infused golden with a great looking large fluffy white crown that settled slowly leaving alot of broken lace behind.Aromas were yeasty with overripe citrus fruits and a bit toasted bread,a hint of sweet booze as well.Flavors of somewhat sweet doughy bread with a big shot the overripe citrusy hops,again the yeast plays a big role.I really liked this hopped lager,it actually seems bigger than what it is."
"O/D-Good, not great. Especially when Jack's Abby IPLs are constantly sitting on the shelf for me at a fear better price point for a noticeably tastier product."
""
""
"32oz mini growler filled at Top Hops in NYC. Pours a translucent orangey honey color with almost no head. Good amount of lacing. The aroma is sweet with some citrus and tropical fruits as well as some grassy notes. Pineapple, tangerine and sweet grapefruit. Some breadiness. A lot going on in the nose. The taste is more of the pineapple, tangerine, and grapefruit. Honey. Sweet with some floral hop notes near the end. Hints of grass with malt throughout. Fair amount of bitterness. Mouthfeel is light and crisp. Overall, a pretty interesting beer well excuted. Hope to have it again."
""
"The body was medium and had a bitter finish that lingered for a bit. Drinkability was OK, the beer went down easily enough, but didn't really have a noticeable personality. Overall, a pleasant enough little brew, probably worth a shot if you see it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Gorgeous lace. Terrible beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Was back and forth between a 3.50 and 3.75 overall, but I guess I was feeling gracious. Decent."
""

""
""
"Drinkable, but unremarkable. When I heard they were bottling this I was expecting more, but I may have had too high of expectations. I'm assuming they accomplished the flavor profile they were looking for, there's nothing off-putting in this pint, but I think I need more IPL's before I can be as objectively critical as I should. Categories aside, the beer in itself is OK, better than average but nothing I would chase down."
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is pretty boring. I give is credit for being refreshing in the summer, but just not a lot of character all the way around from nose, taste, mouth. Not to impressed. Ballast Point is a great Brewery so I am glad they don't bottle this one. I have been pouring it at the shop on tap for drinkers that come in looking for something generic like Blue Moon or Bud light. It seems to go good for them. For a heavy beer guy I would really stay away."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste - very clean and light to medium body, I love it. Great citrusy hop flavor with a balanced malt and bitterness that doesn't linger. All around just good!"

"O/D - Weaker for the style. Missing that strong, delicious noble hop profile. Tastes good, but just didn't want more of this interpretation of the style."
"Overall: This is what lagers/imperial pilsners should taste like. Not sure I've ever had an imperial pilsner that balanced the enjoyable characteristics of a lager with an india pale ale this successfully. Just a delicious, refreshing beer."
""
""
""

"Overall one of my favorites from Ballast Point...and I truly wait for this one to pop up infrequently throughout the year - just went on tap yesterday at Ballast Point so I swooped this up today and it never disappoints - I love traditional Czech pilsners and Cali style IPA's and this has the both of best worlds in every aspect. Cheers!"

"Had this at the public house in san Francisco while at the giants game. This beer saw the first pitch. Really cool. Tastes slightly hoppy but it's pretty balanced overall. Definitely has a pilsner/lager finish to it. Pilsners and lagers are styles I have stayed away from with craft beer,but this wasn't too bad."
""
""
"Pours a clear orange with an off-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. A nice latticework of lace forms on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt and herbal and citrus zest hops. Taste is of herbal and citrus zest hops up front with a nice malt backbone. There is a mild bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp an clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with a nice hop presence."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a golden color, a little paler than an IPA, had a nice strong head. The nose is a lot of floral hops with no to little malt. The taste is great, it is a little lighter in maltiness than an IPA, very slight buttery. Has a great smoothness in the mouthfeel that I thought complimented the hops very well. I was glad I ordered this, I drank it while watching an evening football game, I can see doing this a lot, and ordering numerous of these in an evening."
"I can't believe the overall rating for this beer. I would take this any day over Sculpin. Maybe I just had a good batch. This beer is incredible. IPLs might be the next new craze."
"O - Overall I liked this beer while its a style I don't quite see why its around its a good beer like an IPA except different woth trying if you see it ever"
"Gotta say it has been a while since I have had this brew and it did seem different to me this go around but it is always a favorite of mine. I personally just really like the idea of India Pale Lager's. The Lager yeast allows for a much cleaner hop profile delivery IMO. I wish more breweries would take on this style. Definitely need to make a point of seeking out more IPL's!"
"Nice enough. I recall liking this a little more when I first tasted it though."
"O - Great style compared to an ipa, hard to get close to an ipa and be different."
"I like a beer that creates some head-scratching as to style. Good to remember that the creative urge challenges the artificial boundaries. Call it a low-voltage DIPA. But for hopheads I think it would be worth tasting as a highly drinkable novelty."
"Fresh batch tapped yesterday and enjoyed today at Old Grove. Outstanding beer and really nice batch. +.5 to mouthfeel."
"I don't understand why breweries continue to make ""Imperial Pilsners."" It is just an oxymoron IMO. This is really not bad. Though, just a bit of overkill. Tone it down a bit and this is a really good lager. As is, not something I really enjoy."
"A nice try at an emerging style, but a let down especially with everything else they brew. If you can find it try it!"
"D-An interesting and well made brew from Ballast Point for sure. I like and appreciate the effort of this rather rarely done hybrid style but I didn't love it. An easy to drink and enjoyable beer but not overly memorable."
"Another very good beer from Ballast Point. It isn't on the same level as Big Eye, which is much bigger and fuller an Imperial. However, this is quite good, and well worth a go."
"D - Wow this one was very easy to drink...my first one went down rather quickly...I allowed the second one to warm up and that's when I found the lager characteristics coming out...I love the fresh, juicy, sweet tropical fruit flavors from the hops...I'd like to see more hoppy lagers or pilsners"
"Had on tap at Ballast Point taproom in San Diego. This is my first IPL. Pours a golden yellow with a moderate white head. Smell is strange. The hops are there as well as a funky yeast. Taste is challenging for me. Some mild hop bitterness up front then a wash of diacetyl and buttery yeast flavors. Aftertaste is pretty dry but something sticks around longer than is welcome. Mouthfeel is medium. Not into it."
"D - I wish I could get more taste, but it's definitely drinkable. It might be a good beer to try and switch people from BMC to ales."
"D-Not a bad brew. Not sure I get a pils feel to it."
"Drinkability is pretty much off the scales. It's super refreshing and finishes super super dry which beckons you to sip more. I dusted it off ridiculously quick and could have had much more. Super approachable as long as you like hoppy beers already."
"Poured a nice golden color at the lighter end of the spectrum, but well within a lager's range. A nice white head on it. Smell is strong with hops--lots of pine and a bit of backing citrus and floral. Taste was nice and resiny with little malt backing. We had a few IPL's on the trip, and this one was right up there with Humulus from The Bruery. Nice mouthfeel and fantastic drinkability. This is an emerging style I'd like to see more of, and Ballast Point has absolutely nailed it."
"Draught at the brewery. Orange tinted gold color with a lasting white head. Lots of hops in the aroma with flowers, mangos, and peaches adding fruit to the spicy and grassy notes that some more euro hops seem to be adding. The flavor has some light and toasty malt with lots of hop flavor (mango, peach, grapefruit peel) and more bitterness than the sculpin that I had right before. Medium bodied with smooth carbonation. Cool mix of fruity with grassy and spicy hops. I'd definitely like to have this one again."
"Very nicely done version of this style, that packed a ton of juicy hop flavor into a firm, crisp, (and most of all) extremely easy drinking package. I literall could have just stood around and drank this all day but other beers beckoned."
"D: Very high. This is higher in alcohol, but only feeling it rather than tasting it. Only lower points due to alcohol feeling. (Only 6.8% I see! It felt higher)"
"Tap @ Hamilton's. This is not the first IPL I've had, but its definitely the best. Pours clear gold with a one-finger white head. Moderate lacing. Sweet, floral hop aroma. Lots of pine and lemongrass, less of the grapefruit/citrus. Sharp, crisp resin bite up front. Mellows a little into a grapefruit-lemon-orange peel sweetness. The lager back enhances the West Coast IPA feel, giving it a sweet finish. I could drink this all night its so smooth. Very well done."
"Drinkability is high, nice balance of malts and hops in a lager framework, carbonation is overly high, but this is very drinkable for a unique style"
"D: An interesting beer from Ballast Point, but I'd take their regular IPA over this any day."
"Congratulations Ballast Point on brewing this masterpeice"
