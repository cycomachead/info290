"CHEERS!"

"O: Overall, this is just okay. This isn't my favorite style at all, so I can't really judge it too harshly. The smell and taste is good, but the look and mouthfeel leave a lot to be desired."

"Smells good, looks great, tastes good, body is ok. Lacks a certain zest or quality of refreshment that I associate with a great pilsner. Carbonation did seem to be just a touch on the light side which could account for it. Finish is ok. Good enough beer."

"It has the aroma of a true pilsener. The problem might be one of imperializing the style. As with other examples I've had, it just becomes a sticky brew rather than a refreshing one. Still, it is what they were going for, I suppose. Overall, enjoyable for one."

"Overall: Chad's barleywine was solid, John's Dark Lager w/Cherries was nice (especially @ $4.99 for a bomber) and Johnson was a delicious fresh IIPA- It felt like Lakefront was just starting to hit their stride with the My Turn series. Well, they couldn't make it four straight. Pilo is a mess of malt, yeast, and alcohol- I don't say this often, but this is a beer worth passing up. Maybe take a free taster if you see it on tap. Although it might be worth buying a pint to smell it. Just don't take a sip."
"a strange imperial pilsener. its loaded with lavender or jasmine floral aroma, coming from seemingly nowhere, its extremely aromatic and almost perfume-like in its impression. no additives in here that im aware of, so maybe high fermentation temperatures pulled these esters out of the yeast? i just dont know where else that flowery thing could come from. i dont dislike it, but it seems odd for the style. the beer is really sweet too, so much residual sugar on this its hard to drink more than one glass of, which i guess is common in this big pils style now, but its a contradiction to me, and unpleasant. also a lot of body on it for a summer release, hard to drink much of it. the alcohol is well hidden though, and the bubbles keep it moving. when i think of pilsener, i think refreshment, and this one doesnt take me there. it is however quite unique, and an interesting example of the style if indeed those floral essences were intentional."

"This is surprisingly nice. Not overly bitter, good malt, and a nice hoppy graininess. I'd drink this again. Another solid entry from the My Turn Series."
