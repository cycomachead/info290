"O: Probably one of my least favorite brews from Duclaw."
"O- I like it, but can see why someone wouldn't. The lemon is a bit much, but it's not overly hopped and gets better as it warms. Recommended."

"o: Imperial pils is a style I don't really get. I loved this beer in part because it hid its alcohol so well. So why not have a regular pils and a safer ride home?"

"On tap at the brewery and at an Oktoberfest beer festival in MD. Medium sized white head, good retention and some stringy lace. Clear golden hued color. Nose is soft, grassy, light citrus and honeysuckle notes, lightly bready. Med/light bodied, surprisingly crisp and lightly oily on the palate with a nice carbonation. Clean malts, a touch toasty, bready, grainy with laid back spicey flowery hop flavors, apples and a nice bitterness to cap it all off. A tastey lager indeed."
"This was one of my favorites of the day as well. Poured a hazy blonde with a nice thick white head. The smell was average a little hoppier than some. The taste was great. Very hoppy all around with a little more malt at the end. Very crisp and smooth going down. Could have drank these all day. Alcohol is covered up very well and you almost forget that is an Imperial and not a regular pilsner. Great job!"
"A deceptively drinkable beer imperial pils. Maintains a pils character that has been pumped-up - as it should be!"
"Golden lace on top with a thin with lace head. Sweater then any imperial pilsners I've had in this country. Smell was herbal and hop. The taste was spicy, almost an orange rind and cinnamon taste with noticeable hop finish. Felt lite bodied on the tongue but bubbly and crisp. Drinkable is one way I could describe this beer as it goes down easy and begs for a second."
"This beer is exceptionally drinkable. It is flavorful and smooth without any of the alcohol presence you expect. I will go back for more each time they tap this seasonal."
"A DuClaw's seasonal beer deserves mention of what great events their ""release nights"" are. Join their email list, and DuClaws gives away T's, beer mugs/glasses, or other free stuff for 2 special ""release"" evenings. This draws a nice crowd of beer lovers and aficionados. I have yet to be disappointed by the company. Kudos to DuClaws, they not only know good brew but good marketing and how to please their customers."
"Drinkability: Not really to style but a decent drinker"
"Drinkability: The pils is very drinkable, well-balanced with a distinctive hop flavor that stands out nicely."
"It was served a light gold with a white head. The aroma was hops over malt. The taste was quite well balanced. It was definately hop powered, but with just enough malt to make it go. The feel was incredibly clean and dry with a sweet alcohol finish expected from such a strong beer. I chose this because I couldn't resist trying an Imperial Pilsner. I was ready for the hops, but was pleasantly surprised by the great blending of tastes."
"Snake Oil pours a vibrant gold colour with a thick pillowy white head that eventually diminishes but never seems to go away. Very aromatic with scents of grass and flowers. The flavours are biscuity malt, yeast, and a clean hop finish. Nice delicate mouthfeel, with light but persistant carbonation, excessively drinkable. Yum!"
"This is Duclaw's latest seasonal, brought home a growler on Thursday night, reviewing it on Sunday. Pours a clear light gold with a finger of white head and some decent lacing. Aroma is simple grassy hops. Taste brings in a full biscuity malt that really balances well with the assertive hoppiness. Really smooth rounded flavor. Beer seems a little undercarbonated for a pilsner, and while I would usually attribute this to the growler, I had the same thoughts when I had the beer directly from the tap. Overall another solid seasonal from Duclaw."
