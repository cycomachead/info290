"O- Although they only do one thing, they do it so damn well.  Probably the best pilsner I've ever had.  If this were to come out in cans for the summer, I'd buy it by the 12-pack.  So deliciously crushable."

"Resiny aroma, floral, pine. Good citrus flavor, with resin and lightly bitter finish. A bit too bitter for me."

"Enjoying a pint of this at 1702. Very smooth and clean. Would order it again."

"Bright brass with a white head that leaves some nice strings of lace.  Hoppy aroma, though not super aromatic...grassy, citrusy hops, green grapes, and a herbal, spicy edge. Fresh, clean hoppy flavor, crisp and green sort of like a handful of hop pellets. A light malt sweetness runs through the middle, but it finishes hoppy like it starts, only in more of a traditional peppery, spicy way.  Surprisingly light bodied for it's strength, maintaining the crispness that I want from anything including the word ""Pilsner"" in its title.  Good tingly carbonation and a restrained bitterness make for pleasantly easy drinking.  Nice!"
