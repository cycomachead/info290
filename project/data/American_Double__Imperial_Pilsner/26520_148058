Big, honest nose that is right in line with the Jack' Abby family. The label says I'm dealing with Columbus, Chinook & Citra. The Citra is very noticeable, as is the grainy, kernel maltiness that is fairly dry. I also get their yeast strain pretty quickly. The flavor makes me sit straight up in my seat. The hoppiness is huge and almost stringent but somehow very agreeable and tropical tasting. Lots of melon, mango, peach and the citrus family. A very grainy, cereally, kernally flavor. Dry yeastiness. I am very impressed by this beer's lack of overall sweetness. Somehow maintains a complete dryness...maybe it's because it's a Lager? Alcohol is not surprisingly noticeable. The bitterness is also heavy and astringent. Well carbonated. Yet another hop-irradiated Lager from Jack's Abby. I am very impressed by gravity-to-sweetness ratio. They did it again? They did it again!","VelvetExtract","Dec 24, 2014"

4.14,-3.5,4,4.25,4.25,3.75,4,"On tap at NY Pizza. Pours a translucent orange color with an inch of frothy head. Good amount of lacing.The aroma is lots of citrus hops and tropical fruits. Orange, tangerine, guava, mango and a hint of peach. The taste is a lot like the aroma. Tangerine and guava but with some orange peel as well. A bit more floral than the aroma indicated. Light alcohol warmth, but I would never have guessed the abv is 10%. Finishes with the citrus hop bitterness and some warming alcohol. Light mouthfeel. Very drinkable. Overall, well made beer I would grab again.","PicoPapa","Dec 18, 2014"

5,16.6,,,,,,"This is a top class imperial ipa (okay, ipl).  Pine and resin dominate the hop profile, with a bit of floral.  Many great beers with tons of hops often fall a little short with a medicinal off flavor on the finish, but TrIPL finishes super crisp.  There's a perfect amount of malt balance, and a body that encourages you to keep drinking.","parris","Dec 12, 2014"
