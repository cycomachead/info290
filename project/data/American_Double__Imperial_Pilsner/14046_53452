It pours from the bottle with a cloudy, muted, orange-yellow color and is topped by a giant, dense, foamy head. The aroma has a decent yeast presence, some dull, earthy/leafy hops, a little bit of bready sweetness, and a tiny hint of alcohol. The flavor has a nice contrast of dense, woodsy bitterness against a chewy, yeasty breadiness. The light carbonation allows a mouth-filling, resinous texture to develop. Overall, this one is a bit hefty, with a rustic and bold flavor profile that is quite satisfying.","devilben02","Jan 17, 2015"

Noble hop spice and earthiness are more noticeable in the head then in the body while the rich Moravian malts shine more brightly in the body but the two blend in the mouth giving the beer an enjoyable parfait quality.

Dark hazy brown almost looks like a belgian strong along with the same requisite rocky off white cap (dont remember it being this dark). Very nice head that sticks around for the duration. Also to note, this bottle let out a very loud hiss when opened. Nose opens with bright citrus and biscuity malts, alcohol phenols, corn husk and some vegetalness, intriguing for a imp pils. Mouth hits right away with gushing carbonation and brings corn flakes, corn fields (reminds me of frshly tilled land - a bit of greeniness), dry malts and a twinge of hop bitterness - only bitter no flavor from them and finishes with bitter belgian spices. Refreshing and the carbonation does well to wipe away the flavor and nose to prepare you for the next sip. I actually prefer this to the dfh version which seems lighter in color (doesnt matter) does have an almost astrigent alcohol taste. The bdb version seems to be better intergrated and a well made beer regardless of which brewey it comes from.","Trilogy31","Jan 11, 2013"

The hoppy, citrusy notes coming off this smell are amazing with a taste that just blew my mind, completely changing my definition of what I thought a pilsner was.

3.6,-10.2,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,"The beer pours a dark brown with a fluffy tan head that laces. There is no sediment, but a slight haziness. The nose is a fierce competition between candi sugar and piney hops. Very interesting for a double pils. The taste is more similar to a Belgian strong than a double pilsner...I'm quite confused and let down. The mouthfeel really seals the belgian strong ale deal with a potent, palate-coating sweetness, biting alcohol, yeast and resinous hops. There is nothing light and refreshing about this beer. I will not try this beer again and don't know why I bothered.","ThePorterSorter","Aug 26, 2012"

Speaking of animals, the taste doesn't really have any noticeable barnyard notes to it, but it does have a touch of funk. Other than that, it's not overly sour but does exhibit some acetic notes and the same peach and lemon fruit found in the aroma. Smooth, and all around a pleasant beer, but not earth shaking.

4.23,5.5,4.5,4,4,4,5,"This beer is way up there when it comes to drinkability, it just hits the spot. I wold say that this beer would be a great starting point for someone who is learning about craft beer or if you are trying to ween a freind off Budweiser or Miller Lite. It is light in body full in flavor and pairs with just about every kind of food out there making this a great beer for just about everyone. For a hot day like today this is just what I needed to quench my thirst and if you come across this beer I'd say you better not pass it by.","Bmoyer0301","Jun 01, 2010"
4.88,21.7,5,4.5,5,5,5,"It's not brewed continusouly by Dogfish in Delaware. You know it's going to be good when even the foam is tasty. It pours with a big, creamy head. The color is a slightly cloudy gold. The aroma is big with grapefruit and hops. The flavor is very reminiscent of a medium IPA like their 60 Minutes. But it's somehow cleaner than that. The spiced hops are there. Lots of grapefruit, lemon, and coriander. But it slides down the tongue instead of punching it. The lagering really helps mellow the flavors without muting them. You could down many of these without hesitation despite the 7.5% alcohol. It's just that clean and smooth without sacrificing flavor. Why haven't I seen this before? Truly a great concept and a new favorite.","skinny0ne","May 25, 2010"
4.1,2.2,4,4,4,4,4.5,"I'm not a huge Pilsner fan but this particular one is definitely worth seeking out because it's more extreme and more interesting than a typical Pils.","jzeilinger","May 09, 2010"

3.97,-1,3.5,4,4,4,4,"This is a very interesting beer. Had a nice golden appearance, with a nice head lacing which sticks to the glass. Has some nice hop aroma, but a nice malt to balance it out as well. A pretty balanced beer overall. A good crisp light taste, but still a firm malt backbone. A very drinkable beer for 7.5% ABV.","Drone53","Mar 13, 2010"
4.2,4.7,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Taste is light and crisp for an imperial pilsner, the hops meld well with the malt with neither overshadowing the other, finishes a bit spicy.","deltatauhobbit","Mar 08, 2010"
4.25,6,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"On tap at The Lion's Pride. I, too, was looking forward to having some Belgian beers, but couldn't pass this up. In a tulip glass the beer was a clear gold color with a voluminous white head. Lots of lacing. A very fresh, outdoors aroma, like newly mown grass. Hoppy, with a big malt influence. Kind of breadlike. A great Bohemian pilsner. Very drinkable; two went down fairly quickly.","lordofthewiens","Jan 17, 2010"
4.23,5.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Reviewed from my notes. Served in a brand new Lion's Pride goblet as my first beer of their Belgian Beer Festival [I found it quite funny to order an Italian/American collaboration as my initial beer of a Belgian fest, but I didn't want to pass up this brew, as I'd never seen if poured before]. It has a very pretty tarnished gold color. It is very clear, as a good pilsner should be. It had a large foam head that was pure white; it left behind lots of lacing as I drank it. Surprisingly, I couldn't see any carbonation rising within the glass. It had a musty yeast aroma with some sour citrus mixed in as well. My impressions of the flavor were creamy, malty, and a bit fruity. There was a touch of crystal sugar I could taste, a nod to the imperial nature of this beer, but it was subtle. It had a medium body and a medium level of coating. It felt good, but was not remarkable. I found it to be very drinkable. I thought it would go well with a pork dish. I could see myself enjoying a few glasses of this over a great meal.","ToasterChef","Jan 08, 2010"
4.3,7.2,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Had this on tap at the Thirsty Monk in Asheville, NC. The light straw color and thin lacey head made me think this beer would be much lighter and Belgian in flavor. I was extremely surprised to find that this is an excellent well hopped pilsner. There's a good amount of lingering hop bitterness as this beer goes down, and it goes down very easy for 7.5%. Very impressed with this one, a definite must try.","theWrkncacnter","Jan 03, 2010"

4.38,9.2,5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"D - This is a really nice imperial pilsner, which is really quite a rare thing. It has a wonderful aroma of pilsner malt and interesting spice notes as well as an intense hop flavor that keeps it quite well balanced and drinkable. Unlike most other imperial pilsners it does not become cloyingly sweet and the hop character is complex and interesting instead of the flat bitterness that some other examples of the style display. I would happily drink this again, though I don't expect that I will get the chance.","nickfl","Dec 20, 2009"

4.51,12.5,5,4,4.5,4.5,5,"D: This is probably the best example of a imperial pilsner that does well as a regular pilsner. A really great beer.

3.9,-2.7,4,4,4,4,3.5,"Mini growler pour from Decicco's in Ardsley, NY. Very clear darker orangy golden, with a slight greenish, olive oil sheen. Near white heat that collects at about 1/2 inch, stays for a spell. Loose and light, leaving a collar and moderate lace/light sheeting. Lime in the nose, grassy hops and light malts. Full flavor brew, with more lime up front, bold and bracing. Some alcohol simmering in the mid section and then a moderatly snappy and dry finish. Clean and tasty offering. Interesting collaboration. Enjoyed the mini growler, but not sure if I'm a big fan of the style.","Billolick","Oct 17, 2009"
