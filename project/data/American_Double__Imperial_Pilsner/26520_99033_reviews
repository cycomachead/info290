review_text
"Was at the local pub tonight, ordered this on draft. SHWEEET!!! I had no idea what I was ordering, except that I generally like all of Jack's Abbey brews. Holy cow it was good. I have to say I've never seen a beer that looks like this. Pineapple yellow, and murky as f**k. Small white head that leaves decent lacing. Smells of strong, sweet and bitter hops. Wonderful citrusy pineapple favors with sharp evergreen aftertaste. Strong. Good. Will definitely seek this out again."
""
"Pineapple aroma.  Huge citrus punch and a bitter pine finish."
""
""
""
""
"This is the best IPL hands down!"
""
"TASTE: Hop forward, pungent, smooth, medium body, aggressive bitterness, grapefruit rind, peppery, warming, faint nuttiness, underlying breadiness, pithy, fresh-cut grass, herbal, juicy; drying, bitter finish"
"Deep golden color with an off white head that builds thick and laces great.  Smell is of biscuit, citrus pulp and zest.  Great aroma but a bit subdued.  Taste is light biscuit backbone carrying great citrus zesty flavors.  Crisp feel with an initial zip that breaks and goes creamy on the palate.  Great beer, very drinkable at 8% and great flavor."
""
""
""
"Almost a wheat-ipa. Had the hops I love but had a drop of lemon similar to a wheat beer on the back of the tongue."
"Very nice IPL, hoppy, with the perfect malt for the balance!"
""
""
""
""
"Smooth and creamy feel, very interesting stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A little too sweet for me but otherwise a fantastic beer. Would love to try this on a hot summer morning next to a nice, spicy bloody mary. Jack's Abby continues to amaze me with what they can do with their Lagers, try this one without hesitation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Eh. I guess I don't like lagers"
"O: very good beer they make hoppy lagers like nobodies business I wonder what one of their straight up IPAs would be like. Fantastically fruity and great mouth feel"
""
"Overall: A great beer, and probably my favorite from Jack's Abby so far. Really like how the lager yeast and lagering affected the DIPA flavors and made a crisper, cleaner but still massively hoppy beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Its young nephew Hoponius does quite well for himself. He obviously doesnt take after uncle Mass Rising. Also, ABV isnt anywhere on the bottle."
""
"Got in a BIF from ZebraCakez. 12 ounce bottle into lager glass; bottle dating is worn off. Pours hazy deep golden color with a 1-2 finger dense and rocky white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice dense soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of big lemon zest, orange peel, grapefruit, citrus rind, pine, herbal, floral, grass, cracker, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great complexity and balance of bright citrus/pine hops and light-moderate pale malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big grapefruit, lemon zest, orange peel, citrus rind, pine, herbal, floral, grass, cracker, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Good amount of pine/citrus rind bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, lemon/orange zest, citrus rind, pine, cracker, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and balance of bright citrus/pine hops and light-moderate pale malt flavors; with a great bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Very clean on lager flavors with zero yeast ester notes present. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and fairly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very excellent IPL style. All around great complexity and balance of bright citrus/pine hops and light-moderate pale malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."
""
""
""
"Overall: A delicious, sessionable lager that sneaks in fantastic hop flavor and relatively high alcohol content. I'd drink this any day of the week."
""
"This is what an IPL is supposed to be, this is the king of IPL's. No other comes close to this in Aroma, taste, look and feel, it gives you all the amazing characteristics of a world class IPA but with the lightness and stunning crystal clear picture perfect quality of a pilsner. If you can get a hold of this beer do so."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is very pilsner like with the malts and the hop aromas, flavors, and bitterness are pleasant and abundant."
"A fantastic IIPA, light body with active carbonation. Taste is very happy and fruity, smooth with a citrus finish."
""
""
"It's a step up from the harsh imbalance of Kiwi, but I still think it doesn't work as well as Hoponious. The lager yeast/heavy hopping combo creates a shrill effect. Losing hold of the malt character isn't super surprising for the style, but without it here the shrillness is especially stark. Wouldn't reach for this, deferring instead to the aforementioned Hoponious or another more balanced option from JA."
"one of the best pilsners out there"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Well made beer totally enjoyable! I would seek this on out again for sure"
"great everyday IPL.. Jacks abbey has solidified their spot at the top of IPL makers. Creamy first sip as the head dissolves. nice lacing on glass. Hoppy experience througout"
""
""
"Not my traditional beer style but glad I tried this one.  Excellent, smooth, hoppy beer that is exceptionally balanced.   You can drink this all day long."
""
"Overall, this is a nice full bodied double IPL with ample hop flavor.  Not the most complex, but great for what it is."
""
"It s/b noted that this beer is a double ipl and not a pilsner."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"very good IPL-  Happy with my first JA beer"
""
""
""
"Overall:  An interesting tasting beer.  For me, this tastes like a nice session beer with a high ABV.  I would like more.  I like it a lot."

"This beer has won me over ... When I first had this beer I didn't put this beer up there with Kiwi Rising BUT I put them both right up there with each other.. Mass Rising has a nice strong hoppy smell to it... Very distinct taste and smell.. Such a great beer.."

"My favorite India Pale Lager, although often is represented as a Pilsner.  Great drinkability, while still 8%.  Must try for IPL fans."

"This is a mix between a double IPA hoppiness combined with a double lager/pilsner body.  very drinkable beer good hop nose."
"Not my kind of brew, but one of the better IPLs I've had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours hazy yellow with a fluffy white head. Big time lemony aroma here with some grassy pine to go along with a hint of pineapple and honey. The flavor is lots of lemon bitter hops, a bit of pine, some fruits, and low sweetness from the malts. Finishes smooth but with a funky note left on the palate. High carbonation, light or medium body, super easy drinking, and slightly dry. Overall extremely solid and dangerously crushable."
"This is really good beer, pick up a sixer if you can get it. It has the hoppiness of a good IPA but it's significantly smoother. It doesn't have that biting astringincey. Really well balanced, just a hint of sweetness. Remarkably drinkable at 8%."
""
""
""
""
"Overall I liked this a lot...I thought it was really good and had an amazing nose to it. Easy to drink and worth checking out, would drink this all the time if I could."
""
""
""
"A great IPL that I would love to have regular access to."
""
""
""

""
""

""
""
"Overall, a little bitter for my palette. Somewhat astringent and the herbals are a tad medicinal, but, sometimes you need your medicine! I'm impressed that this is a lager."
"O - I would bet that few could tell this apart from some of the best IPA's on the shelf. I almost thought I was indulging on a Toppling Goliath IPA for a moment."

"O: I liked this beer but wish it had more complexity -- it is a one-trick pony flavor-wise but it does that trick with noble hopping well."

"O: This is a really enjoyable beer. The mouthfeel is clean and crisp. There are malt and grass notes that make the taste very nice. I was worried about the bitterness at 100 IBUs - but it was nicely balanced. Also the 8% ABV was hidden well."
""
""
""
""
""
"On tap at the Worthy Burger. Deep straw color and attractive in the glass. A thin but attractive head and great, thick, and lasting lacing. A light scent of hops and citrus, nothing heavy or overwhelming. Feels light and drinkable, with well masked alcohol. A citrus pallet and bitter finish. An excellent IPL from JA."

"Thanks to jlindros. Pours a bright yellow gold color. It's quite transparent. There's some sediment at the bottom of the bottle, but a gentle-ish pour didn't disturb it and cloud things up. Big puffy white head. Lots of lacing. Big clumps on the walls of the glass. Excellent retention. Floral and citric hop aroma. Pale bready malt sweetness. Some peach, white grape, mango. It's all a bit mild, though, and really could be juicier. Surprisingly little lager yeastiness. Taste is similar. Some lemon, peach, grass, pine. Again, fairly mild. Moderate bitterness. Very clean. Some pale malt sweetness, doughy sugars. Little bit of solvent bitterness in the finish. Light and crisp, particularly for the abv. Pretty good beer."

"o: The ""hops adjusted"" version of their Second Anniversary Lager (which I rated 4.26 last August) has hops enough to satisfy most hopheads, just as its predecessor did. I enjoyed it more when the flavor turned from piney to more citrus."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, another fantastic beer from Jack's Abby. If these guys distributed to my area, I would certainly drink a lot more of the styles from the lager method of brewing. Glad that SammyJaxxx has been kind enough to share the wealth."

"Overall a solid DIPA.. but I prefer hoponius union - this is it's bigger brother that just got outshined by it's sibling."

"Hazy opaque yellowish golden colored beer. Judging this as a lager, should be clearer. Egg whites is what the head looks like, not tight carbonation but pretty. Plenty of lacing. Aroma is big, pine, lemon pinesol, pithy citrus. What more can be said? The aroma blasts out of the glass and is the strongest aspect of this beer. Tastes good! Hoppy in the citrus and pine variety way with a slight grassy quality married with hidden sulfur. Clean malt profile, the hops lead the way. Somewhat one dimensional in taste and a slight let down. Medium bodied, medium carbonation, medium all the way around in the mouthfeel category. Clean, clean finish, slight bitter hop, but with the clean palate expected of a lagered beer. The finish is another strong aspect of this beer. It's good, period."
"O- This is one serious DIPL...the L only for the fact that it is fermented with Lager Yeast. However, this is nothing but a tried-and true DIPA in all aspects. Jack's Abby continues to break the barriers and twist our (yes...us, the craft beer aficionados) definition of the 'L' word that we so (up until now...) herald as the bane of our existence. However, we should release those shackles and rejoice in the beauty of what our bottom-fermenting microorganisms can achieve with proper care...and proper hopping! (4.75)"
""
"Overall: a good ipl. Good hop character and good clean feel. Very refreshing and drinkable. Can't wait to try more of the great lagers from their line up."
""
""
"Beautiful golden color Slightly cloudy, as unfiltered. Huge head when poured; with head that lasted the entire time I was drinking the beer. Not much of a smell. Delicious taste; perfect amount of hops, bitterness and nice light carbonation. Nice body - not too heavy and not thin. Great drinking beer. Would be great with a light meal, pizza or Italian."
""
"o. Excellent beer from an excellent brewery."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pour is hazed golden yellow with a tight white head. Nose has a light touch of grain and an appealing citrus and grapefruit hop balance. Taste is similar, very nicely done. Light grain and a hint of earthy malt. Hops aren't overly strong but take center state, soft grapefruit with notes of sweet orange rind. Body is light and very well carbonated with a softer feel through the finish. Not super bright but good stuff!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Quality lager and one of the mainstays when one thinks of an 'IPL'. First venture into Jack's Abbey and I hope not the last"
""
"Very good iPa. I really like the beers that Jacks abbey is bringing to market. Another great lager. Saved my growler and I will have it refilled soon"
""
""
""

"O- spectacular IPL, lots of crisp hops and balanced. Impressed and slightly caught off guard."

"This has to be one of my favorite IPAs..well, IPLs. It blows most IPAs out of the water. Its just so crisp and drinkable that its a true pioneer of the style. Nearly perfect brew. Enjoy it."
""
""
""
""
"12oz bottle. Pours a murky dirty yellow color with an inch plus of chunky thick head. Some lacing. Citrus hop aroma. Tangerine, light grapefruit, lemon and some sourness. The taste is much like the aroma. Tangerine, mango and lemon. Hints of sweet grapefruit and sweet malt. Nice mix of bitter hops with some sour notes. Very drinkable with a mild alcohol presence considering the ABV. Heavy mouthfeel with a lot of carbonation. Overall, a fantastic hoppy Imperial India Pale Lager I will be buying again."
""
""
"O- great ipl, lots of hops, zero booze detected. Another home run for jacks abby"
""
"A delicious take on a double pilsner. To make this beer REALLY stand out, I'd love to see a continuation of the texture, which was ""pillowy"" before the alcohol heat kicked in."

"Mass Rising is a solid beer. The sweetness is a little higher than I'd like but besides that it's an interesting combination of robust pilsner and heavy hopping. I would happily give a couple more of these a try in the future. Thanks again, Mark!"
"O- This is a pretty good beer, but I think the single IPL is way better than the double."
""
""
"Pours a hazy straw, yellow orange-ish color, with a compact white head of medium bubbles. The smell is dominated by the hops - a mix of citrus fruit notes - grapefruit rind, lemon, some lime, orange rind. There are also some hints of pine. Smells like a west coast IPA to me. Taste follows the smell though there is a strong, sweet, malty base to the beer that has strong honey-like qualities. I picked up on more lemon than I had expected though grapefruit rind dominated. A little pepper at the close, which I think comes from the lager yeast - finishes dry and pleasant. The mouthfeel is pretty big and smooth for the style though there is medium carbonation. As with everything else I've had from Jack's Abby I really quite enjoyed this."
""
""
"Starting off with the nose there is big hop citrus aroma that transitions right into the taste. The taste and feel of this feel are an awesome combo. Taste consists of big citrus flavors , a slight bit of grapefuit, and a nice dry malt backbone. The lager aspect gives this beer a smooth, crisp taste that makes this extremely drinkable. The amazing citrus hop taste and smoothness of this beer has instantly made this one my favorites."
""
"Just a great beer. Jack's Abby proves that bottom ferment can do just as well what top ferment can do. Highest recommendation, better than their Flagship Hoponius Union."
""
""
"This is a hop bomb with plenty of grapefruit rind style bitterness. There's seemingly no malt base. The swallow is lip puckeringly bitter, giving this beer a very long aftertaste. The body is heavy for a pilsner but the higher combination makes it feel appropriate."
""
""
""
"O - excellent. Cheers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Oh man, this is awesome. I'm a huge fan of crisp, refreshing lagers, and to get one that embodies its mouthfeel and uses intense hopping and fruity yeast often found in ales to elevate its complexity is a job well done indeed. In a way, this is like the lager counterpart to PtE, if only a little less refined. I do hope that more breweries work on developing the IPL style as ambitiously as Jack's Abby has. The results are quite terrific, and are among the most intriguing offerings in American craft beer."
"O: I've yet to have a bad beer by these guys. I'm super impressed by each and every one of their offerings. They're the only brewery I buy every single new beer I see without hesitation because I know it's going to be good. Highly recommended."
""
""
"What JA lacks in bottle art they more than make up for in brewing chops. Mass Rising is good as the best stuff they've put out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Jack's abby has yet to disappoint. They brew drinkable and usually sessionable craft lagers. For someone who doesnt consider myself as a lager fan, i am a HUGE fan of what jacks abby is doing and suspect that this and others in the portfolio will be regulars in my fridge now that i can easily get them!"

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Citric and hop forward Imperial lager. More grapefruit, lime and orange. Unflinchingly hoppy, crisp and quite enjoyable. Well worth a try."
""
"If the label didn't insist, I wouldn't even notice the lager yeast, it's subsumed by layers of tastiness & hops. Tame the carbonation & this would be excellent; as is, an easy-drinking, very good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: A really nice beer. I wish I got this around here to get regularly."
""
""
""
""
"O: A pretty good beer, though the lighter qualities of the beer do little to hide the aggressive alcoholic qualities of the beer. That said, I am typically not a fan of the Imperial Pilsner style and while I am not entirely sure this was brewed to be in Imperial Pilsner, I can say this is my favorite example of the style that I've come across."

"I'm an IPA guy, not a Lager guy, but bumping the IBU's to 100 seemed to kind of work. I would choose this over many standard IPA's out there but prefer the 65 IBU's of their Hoponius Union over this. The beers seemed identical with welcomed less bitterness at 65 IBU."
"I am not a big IPA fan, but I found this India Pale Lager to be quite refreshing. The flavor was crisp and citrusy. It was hoppy, but it didn't smack you in the face and leave you with the bitter after taste. Totally recommend for those of us that are a little skittish of IPAs"
""
""
""
"This is a delicious hoppy lager. Very smooth and easy to drink but certainly piney with citrus rind scent/taste. Surprisingly smooth given the ABV and intense hop bill. Really clean mouthfeel and base like all from Jack's Abby. Great standard bearer for them here."
""
""
""

"Warning - the alcohol is well hidden on this one. I found myself getting a bit sloppy half way through the growler without even realizing it. Whoops."
"Mouthfeel is pretty freaking awesome. Hard light to medium bodied and a great carbonation level, perfect anytime beer. Perfect amount of bitterness from the hops. This beer starts slightly sweet, has a nice smooth feel with a dry, earthy, snappy finish. Crazy drinkable (like almost anything from Jack's Abby), you most certainly wouldn't think this beer was an 8%er. Goes down quick, this one almost needs to be in the bigger bottles, this amount is barely enough. Great beer."

"Once again, this brewer nails to perfection the look. Constant stream of tiny bubbles race up a clear gold body. Huge head (remarkably white) that is foamy and whipped, almost like meringue. Aroma is strong on the peaches, grassy, piney hops, fleshy, tropical fruit. Flavor is lush, lots of fruit, hoppy yet flavor shines rather than the bitterness which plays a supporting role. Solid stuff here and i will be grabbing more from this brewer for sure."

"Pours a very clear golden color, minimal head on my pour, starting to see some nice lacing though. Smells outstanding. Tropical fruits. Passion fruit, citrus. Taste isn't as tropical as the smell. Very good though, a bit of pine and grass, and pleasant bitterness on the end. Bitter grapefruit rind. Not a lot of carbonation here. Very thin and drinkable. Second time having his brew. Thought I remembered there being more orange flavor. I wish I could get the flavor from the nose, it's a great aroma."
""
""
""

"This beer does not have too much obvious fruity notes from the hops, but still has that hop “juice” flavor. Extremely hoppy. Very clean and bitter. Very drinkable."

""
""
""
""

"Bright gold with a bit of haze apparent as it warmed. Fluffy cream coloured cap with excellent head retention and plenty of sticky lacing. Complex hop aroma (floral, lemon citrus, fruity, slightly spicy and earthy) with faint malt character, a bit powdery. Solid bitterness balanced by hops, alcohol, and mild malt sweetness. Spicy/lemon up front with lingering bitterness and alcohol warmth. Medium plus body with moderate carbonation, good texture. A solid beer with lots of hop character that still felt refined in its excesses."

"A very easy drinking beer for 8%. Well balanced and quite tasty."
""

"O - I fear I may have neglected to drink this beer at its prime; however, I had a Hoponius Union that I bought at the same time, and it was fine. This may have been on the shelf longer. I am not sure. What I am sure of is that I liked the Hoponius Union much better. Regardless, this is my celebration of National Lager Day."

"Thanks to mj0126 for the trade. Pours a clear with a thick, 3-finger white head. Good retention and lots of lacing. Aromas of tropical fruit and pine. Lots of citrus, pine and tropical fruit on the tongue. Finishes dry. Smooth, medium bodied mouthfeel with lots of carbonation. Overall, this is a very impressive double pilsner, well balanced. Very hop forward. I'm not usually a fan of lagers, but this one is worth seeking out."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Obviously extremely similar to the original 2nd Anniversary beer, but it's slightly more drinkable. Definitely backs up the statement on the label that states that it's extra hoppy. The 100 IBUs are definitely right up front and in your face. This one will either get you hooked on lagers or extremely hoppy beers... not that many people aren't already hooked on the latter"

"Another winner from Jack's Abby. Really creative and non-traditional lagers coming from them."
""
"The beer is mostly clear and golden with a half-inch of white head. The aroma offers dank citrus, hops. Oo...smells nice. Grapefruit and oranges with a dry finish. Bold and exciting. Delicious. Some sourbread and yeast notes blend beautifully with a predominantly hoppy beer. I definitely recommend this."
""
"Drink fresh!"
""
"O - Hop forward lager, pretty dirty grass and earth."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy light orange with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus fruit, citrus zest, and some earthy hop aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus zest flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is tasty but has a slightly better hop aroma in my opinion."

"O - Very interesting mix of hops and lager. Good complexity. Great beer."
"Overall, a solid brew I'm glad to have tried and would definitely drink again. Could have toned down the sweet, sticky malt-forward nature a bit, but otherwise really nice."
"Overall, another excellent hoppy lager from Jack's Abby."

"Every time I drink a beer from Jack's Abby, I feel more pride about being born and raised in Massachusetts. This beer is quite remarkable. It's not perfect, but it really pushes the boundaries of stereotypes associated with lagers. So, so hoppy. It becomes borderline abrasive, but not. Definitely worth seeking out."

"Pours a golden hazy pale hue allowing some light to penetrate. A fluffy long lasting head rests on top... Aroma of juicy guava and mosaic/galaxy resembling tropical fruit quality, light bitter grass backing. Semi-sweet pale grains to go along with the preceding. A touch catty all around. Fresh and nice... Flavored are a continuation of the same with sweet grains upfront that quickly dry out with a pithy bitterness. Seedy tropical fruit note abundant. Pretty clean with a nice balance between a bigger lager grain presence and an assertively well hopped offering. Medium bodied with adequate carbonation."

"Overall a great beer! Pair it with some good cheese (Meadow Creek's Grayson would be great!) for a nice treat."

"Taste is a peek of sweet maltiness to start, pine hops in the middle, and bitterness carries through the close. Hops burps are immediate. Mouthfeel is soft and smooth, with easy drinkability. Worthy of being an anniversary brew."
""
"Overall, one of the better pilsners I've tasted. Unique, flavorful, balanced, and big. Not my ideal style, but Jack's is doing a phenomenal job with it. I really respect their talent as well as this brew in particular."
"o: Very good for sure, butI wish I would have tried this 2 months ago."

"Mass Rising is another excellent offering from the boys at Jack's Abby. While this beer might not be quite on the same level as their 2nd Anniversary Lager, it is an amazingly flavorful and remarkably quaffable double IPL."
""
""
""
"Overall (4.25): This one isn’t quite as fruity and juicy as Hoponious Union, and not quite as pithy-bitter as The ABCs, but man this is still a damn good, hoppy lager. It’s lean, lemony, sneaky, dry, way too easy, and just damn good. Jack’s Abby has kind of defined the IPL sub-style, and between this and the other two aforentioned beers they’ve made me a believer. I still haven’t had Mass Rising or Kiwi Rising, but man I can say that I absolutely look forward to the day that I try them."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall great, another amazing beer from Jack's Abby, but this time getting into the realm of Hill farmstead of Tree House with the amazing hop characters, tropical fruit, etc, but keeping that nice crisp soft lager base to make this a winner and a half!"
"O - great ipa/lager. I dont care what it is i just know it was damn tasty."
""
""
"O: Another great DIPL from Jack's Abbey. Big bitter hops with a light crackery malt leads to a crisp and sharp brew. Surprisingly drinkable though, their lagering work tends to see to that."
""
""
"It's a Jack's Abby aggressively hopped lager, which means it's damn tasty. Pulls back on the bitterness of 2nd Anniversary and makes a more drinkable beer."

"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass, bottled recently for sure. Pours a straw yellow, with an enormous billowing white head that leaves incredible lace everywhere. Smell extremely tropical and floral, tangerine, pineapple, mango, grapefruit, and flowers. Taste is even better, everything in the nose, but even more assertive. Citrus, flowers, and grapefruit in the aggressive finish. Body is medium, perfect carbonation, a little dry, and very easy drinking. This is scary good, WOW!"
""
""
"Overall: This is a very impressive IPL. Delicious hop flavors and a wonderfully smooth body combine to make this a really refreshing beer with a whole lot of flavor. I've had the 2nd Anniversary Lager and to me, this one beats that one for sure, although both are great."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I hope that Jack's Abby continues to brew this recipe. The wonderful flavors met me right away, with a lingering piney bitterness that held my attention throughout. I started to feel the alcohol in my face about halfway through, but never tasted it's presence. These probably won't be around for long, I strongly recommend picking up a bottle if you have the opportunity. (My hope came true and has been improved upon)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O/D-This must be a re-brew of their 2nd Anni brew. Therefore, until I am proven wrong I will give Mass Rising the same grade. What a beer. Year round? Hell yes."
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall, this is one of the best beers to come out of Jack's Abby. While not as good as that first go around of Kiwi Rising, this is very close. Very well crafted and at $4.99 a 500mL it does not break the bank."
""
""
""
"The taste begins with a biscuit maltiness and then becomes rich with floral and pine hops, citrus but more specifically grapefruit and tangerine, and a long lasting bitter finale. An amazing beer and I'm glad I got to celebrate Jack's Abby's second anniversary with this one."
"Pours a dull, light orange hue with a hazy clarity and a voluminous, fluffy, three-inch butter-milk colored head. As the head slowly settles into a half-inch cap, spots and strands of textured lacing are revealed. Nose expresses bitter-sweet citrus notes (perhaps tangerine and grapefruit), followed by an earthy/herbal rind quality. Taste consistent with nose; a perfect balance between sweet and bitter and a great interplay between the two characters. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a touch of oiliness to the texture and an even carbonation that leaves just the faintest hint of a burn at the back of the throat between quaffs. Overall, a fantastic anniversary beer. I am consistently blown away by what they guys do with lagers."
""
""
"N-not quite. While Humulus retains just enough crispness to clearly differentiate itself from a double IPA, the back end of JA's second anniversary strays into the harsh medicinal nodes that mar most iterations of this difficult style. Thankfully the front end is still smooth and pleasant and the back-end never gets painfully sharp, but it comes too close for my liking."
""
""
"After having this a few times out of the bottle and once on draft it just reinforces something I already knew. Jack's Abby knows how to use their hops. The clean feel of the base beer just accentuates the great blend of hops they choose. Drinks like a super fresh ""West Coast"" IPA. Loving this brewery more and more with each day, err sip."
"O: Very good hoppy lager. I am impressed with the giant amount of hops in this beer and the clean crisp bitter finish. Well done."
""
""
"O- A ballsy take on the style as we have come to expect from J'sA. Bold hop profile pushes the edge of a hoppy pils. Only knock is the malt base seems to be rather bland and hindered the balance/drinkability. Overall, a very solid showing, but not my fav imperial Pils. I'd like to think of it as a west coast imperial pilsner."
"O: great lager. To be honest, if it was placed in front of me as a mystery beer I would absolutely guess ale. That being said, I don't want to take anything away from this one. I really enjoy the hop presence throughout, as well as the drinkability (8%... Seriously?) would absolutely recommend/pick up again (fingers crossed!!)"
""
""
"D - A nice brew to be certain, but I was slightly disappointed considering the pedigree. The hop character was a bit muddled rather than complex, and I was also hoping for more hop kick and a bit less malt. Well-executed and quite tasty, as all Jack's Abby brews tend to be, but I'd still prefer Kiwi Rising or Hoponius Union."
""
"Absolutely recommend trying this, IF you can find it."
""
"I've enjoyed the three Jack's Abby lagers I've had up to this point in my beer drinking career, although I've gotta say that many of them could probably pass for ales. They've all got a nice, crisp, clean finish, but I've seen similar palatable qualities achieved with ale yeast, or at least close enough to not require extended and cooler fermentation. In any case, another good brew, though I prefer the less aggressive, more drinkable Hoponius Union."
"O – This is a phenomenal beer. It’s just like a great DIPA except maybe even better. The crisp lager mouthfeel gives it a much more drinkable character while still having enough body for the magnitude of the beer. This is really a marvelously crafted brew. Thank you so, so much for giving me the opportunity to try this one, Jared!"

"Delicious! Can't beat the drinkability of a hoppy lager!"
""
""
""
"Yes, more of this please. Super hopped up double pilsners seem to be coming around, and I couldn't be happier to see a young brewery like this nail it. This reminded me of Humulus Lager, which is by far the best in this style IMO."
"TOTAL = 47/50"
""
""
"O- This was another great DIPL from Jack's Abby that is easily up there with Kiwi Rising, however I think I prefer Kiwi slightly more with the more intense citrus presence. The 2nd Anniversary is more balanced and has a great drinkability. Despite being at least a few weeks old the hops in this beer are holding up great. I hope Jack's Abby continues making this beer and I definitely recommend checking it out."
"The beer pours a clear golden yellow, like clean, yet dehydrated piss. The beer pours with a beautiful head of bubbles that sits well over two fingers widths above the beer and is made of a menagerie of different sized, creamy bubbles. When the head leaves, the beer leaves a lacing of long strings of medium width tiny bubbles alongside the glass. In body the beer is beautifully clean and pure, with just a slight haze coming from the malt. This is a pretty looking beer. On the nose, this beer is a damp head rush of everything I love about American hops. Big and bristling pine moves into smooth and juicy mango and pineapple notes with light hints of grapefruit and a touch of tangerines. There is also a slight dank smell lurking below all the other smells, and a touch of caramelly malt. Though I haven’t had Heady Topper for about a half a year, this beer smells quite similar to Heady to me. As it sits in my glass the dankness grows and bristles onto the nose, but there is some beautifully juicy fruit notes right beside it. This beer smells great. On the tongue, this beer is fearlessly bitter with just a touch of sweet on the finish to remind us that there is, in fact, malt in this beer. Slight touches of salt and acidity can also be sensed on the fringes of the tongue, but really, this beer is all about the beautiful bitters. In flavor, the beer begins as a blend of pine and tropical fruit juice, and the bitters gracefully build from there, trouncing over my mouth in perfect formation. Light biscuit cracker coincides with a deep dank flavor in the middle of the palate, though neither works its way in front of the fruity bitters which continue to work through the fruity flavor profile of hops, finishing with a big, bitter, grapefruit shiver that lingers into dank pine notes in the aftertaste. In the mouth, the beer is on the light side of medium, with near perfect carbonation working to caress the tongue like a soft pillow, even as the beer’s bitters bludgeon it. The mouth is left terrifically dry and slightly sticky, and though the tongue wets slightly, the mouth is just left begging for another sip. This beer is a masterpiece of hops, and I am loving it. A richly complex smell and flavor that work to be both thirst quenching and inspiring. This is an awesome beer to slug during the summer, but be careful, as its 8% alcohol never quite shows in the flavor. Try this beer for sure, and Jack’s Abby please make this a regular!"
"o- you can really enjoy this one, another good effort from jack's"
""
""
"Anyone that enjoys a tasty hop bomb should seek this out...Impressive brew!"
""
""
"O: Drinks like the smoothest IPA possible. This is the definitive IIPL, if there's even any competition, which maybe there is literally... but certainly is not in any other sense."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Congrats JA on 2 years. This beer is a fantastic big brother to the Hoponious Union. A much cleaner version of a DIPL than Kiwi Rising, and honestly I'm not sure which I like better. Whatever... try this beer. If you're a hop head you will not be disappointed."
""
""
"overall execellent brew"
""
"Jack's Abby's 2nd anniversary beer is a seriously hopped up lager, fitting for them, seeing as that is what they do best and what basically put them on the map. They take it to an extreme here, completely unbalanced hop bomb, but a great beer - I think I prefered this to Kiwi Rising."
""
""
""
"Poured from the bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a bright, slightly hazed, goldenrod coloring with slow, steady carbonation flow and a tall, frothy, light, white head that slowly, unevenly settles, leaving a wicked cling along the glass. Aromas of pine resin, subtle tropical fruit sweetness, pepper spicing, and a rich bitterness. Subtle toasted grain backbone in the nose, also. Flavors are very hop forward, with a resiny, bitter blast. Subtle grassy notes, with tangy and tart tropical fruit highlights. Toasted grain undertones. Very smooth, light bodied, with a hoppy, resiny bitterness into the aftertaste. Clean, smooth finish that has a slight drying effect. Solid brew."
""
""
""
"O: A pretty excellent beer. Delighted that it's made a return in year-round form in Mass Rising...even if I do think the latter is actually a more balanced and all-round better beer, I have to give credit where credit's due to the one-off that spawned one of my current year-round favorites."
"Cheers."
""
""
""
""
"O - A total hop bomb. I really enjoyed this beer. Another home run by the crew in Framingham."
""
""
"It's light gold with a solid sheet of whites and near brilliant clarity. Smells absurdly dank, marijuana, pine, weed, dankness, the dankness, my high school years, etc. Flavor is a little less hoppy, but dank nonetheless. Lots of resiny hops, some nice pilsner malts, and a bit of bitterness, but really, really hoppy flavor for the style. Medium on light with hi carb and a wet finish. This beer is seriously tasty, but appears not to give a fuck about a poorly defined styles guidelines. Cheers to Jack's Abbey."
"Overall a very nice beer, very glad to try it and wish I could easily get more and try it on tap as well. cheers!"
""
""
"O: This has got to be very high up on the priority list for all the hop-heads out there. It’s got all the bitterness you could want and then some. A very well-executed hop bomb, 2nd Anniversary is more than just a beer with hops piled in. Clean, crisp, and focused: this took some skill. Bravo and congratulations to Jack’s Abby."
""
""
""
"Overall: 100 IBUs and showing it. This will not disappoint those who love hop bombs. Much like the rest of Jack's Abbey's brews, it is very clean. Nice beer, but one is good enough for me."
"Pours a crystal clear deep straw with a huge bubbly bone white head that takes forever to recede. Aromas of spicy onion and garlic with a bit of pine and dankness hiding a hint of bready sweet malt. The flavor is lightly bready but overpowered by resin pine and green onion. Smooth hop flavor with just a touch of bitterness. Medium body with a spirited level of carbonation and a slick resinous mouthfeel. Nice beer, I'm glad I found some of this."
""
""
"Mouthfeel is really awesome also- medium body, well carbonated, a good dose of resin but not too sticky. Only reason I didn't give a five on mouthfeel was because it's perhaps a tad bit too sticky for my taste but it's really an exceptional brew. Go get it!"

"O: jacks abby surprises me with every new beer i try from them. Loving this a lot more than the ABCs double IPL, and the kiwi rising i had was old. This beer is fresh and phenominal. The hops really shine through the lager body of their beers and i' m loving em more and more. This should become a year round beer. Fantastic aroma, taste, great body and dangerously drinkable. I already know i want another and i'm only a third of the way in. Gotta find more of these."
"A very pale golden color that's clear with lots of little bubbles racing to the top where a big fluffy white head sits and holds decently. The lacing is very solid. The aroma brings out a nice citrus with a spicy bread and fruity yeast. Pleasant hop goodness. The flavor comes out with a more prominent citrus-grass hop bite. The yeast and bread ideas remain obvious as well. Cereal grain with a very bitter grass and citrus theme that camps out dryly on your palate. This brew is crisp with a medium-light body and just an edge of some creaminess. Very nice."

"Great beer. Quite dry beyond the juicy tropicals and super smooth. Call it what you will but this beer is a IIPA."

"O: Very, very good DIP w/ the classic Jack's Abby ""L" touch. Glad I got 2 while I was in town and if my cart wasn't full w/ other MA offerings, I'd have gotten more."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I'm kind of disappointed. I was really looking forward to this beer, but I think it lacks the balance that I expected from it. It's very, very hoppy. The ABCS struck a fine balance between the crispness of a lager and the hoppyness of an IPA. This was shockingly bitter to start, though I'm adjusting to it now."
