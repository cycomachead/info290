4.27,0.5,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Resiny bitter hops, orange peel, citric and oily hop vibes. A vague fruity sweetness flashes quickly before segueing into a long resiny bitterness in the middle and lingering into the aftertaste. Some trace lager yeast character. Light bodied and super hoppy. Overall very drinkable considering the abv. Paired well with Rutger Hauer in Blind Fury.","emerge077","Jul 03, 2013"
