However, they seem to have added extra earthy spicy chewy hops on top of it which was not needed and brings it down. It is bitter and astringent, earthy soil flavored, and malts and yeast at least bring nice Belgian blond flavors, esters and hint of phenols even which accent the spruce nicely.","jlindros","Jan 10, 2013"

The spruce is huge upfront then settles into a nice dry bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel is clean and crisp, very drinkable. Overall pretty damn impressive.

4.2,7.1,4,4,4.5,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into pilsener glass, bottled 6/14/2012. Pours hazy golden straw color with a nice 1-2 finger fairly dense white head with very good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Good spotty lacing clings down the glass as you drink; with a fair amount of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of lemon, citrus peel, grapefruit, bread, herbal, floral, spruce, pine, grass, and earthiness. Very nice aromas that are extremely unique; and have great balance with a nice hop profile as well. Taste of big orange, pine, grapefruit, lemon, pepper, spruce, floral, earth, and big herbal spiciness. Nice amount of pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of orange, grapefruit, lemon, pine, spruce, floral, earth, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a while. Great bitterness and hop flavor balance with the malt profile; with good complexity. Medium carbonation and body; with a nice fairly creamy and slightly sticky mouthfeel. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very excellent and unique imperial pilsner. Great hop profile and balance; and extremely easy to drink. Highly enjoyable.","superspak","Jul 15, 2012"

Well, this year i bought a six pack and needless to say had to go back and buy 12 more. This has to be one of the most unique beers I've ever had. The smell of spruce works SO well with the IPA and the flavor is just exceptional. This is a beer I hope to stockpile a bit more of, as last year it really lasted a long time and still tasted good.","chromemittenman","Jul 01, 2012"

3.86,-1.5,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,4," The Flavor is intriguing to me, it tastes as you might expect with some bitterness present from the hops with slight citrus edge, but mild in relation to the deep woody and almost tannic sharp acidic and earthy pine-like taste that comes forward in the peripheral and lasts into the finish with only a mild amount of pilsner malt light cracker elements. Overall I found this to live up to the name, it was woody but not so astringent that it was undrinkable. I found the feel to be not very pilsner-like, but that really isn't the point of this. The spruce is conveyed in the taste more than any other spiced or other flavored beer and still compliments the base beer very well.","Slatetank","Nov 06, 2011"

Definitely worth checking out if you have the opportunity.","prototypic","Oct 01, 2011"

Flavor is very nice, very bitter and foresty. The spruce is nicely integrated, the massive hops carry it through and there is enough base malt to give a slight balance to it. Definitely hop forward but nicely done. Definitely the best spruce beer I've had.","Tripphop","Aug 12, 2011"

Couldn't drink more than one or two a night, but could have no problem revisiting frequently. A little off the mark for a pilsner, but the basic pilsner premise is in there and creating one is an exact science. Short's just took a mad scientist approach. Enjoyable and recommended.","phishisphunk","Aug 07, 2011"
4.03,2.8,4.5,4,4,4,4,"O: Pretty interesting beer all around. It’s definitely got a clean, sharp bitterness going for it which sounds like what the brewer was intending. One of the better beers I’ve had from Short’s. Thanks again, Jay.","scottfrie","Aug 06, 2011"
2.85,-27.3,4,4,2,3.5,2.5,"The beer pours a nice golden color with a thin head of white bubbles. Pure spruce in the nose, with just a hint of hops and sweet malt. This has all the apperence of a beer, but almost none of the taste. Like eating spruce sap right from the tree. Way too much spruce for me. I drank half of my half of the bottle and topped off my glass with whatever pale ale I was drinking, and that was about as much spruce as I wanted in this beer. I was looking forward to trying this (as I do alot of Shorts beers), and was dissapointed (as I am with a lot of Shorts beers).","baconsausage","Aug 03, 2011"
3.52,-10.2,4,4.5,3,4,3,"overall, this is another head scratcher. I appreciate the pushing of the envelope and the sheer novelty this brewery has been known to pump out, but repeating an experience with this brew has proven to be a chore. a single bottle may have left a better taste behind, but an entire sixer is a cumbersome load that lingers without a solid place in the rotation. buy one try one or buy six and trade five and let others get a taste.","SupaCelt","Aug 02, 2011"

4.32,10.2,4.5,5,4,4.5,4,"O- This is another great experimental brew from Short's. The actual spruce tips work with the hops to really showcase what a pine profile can accomplish. That said, as the pine qualities build, this becomes a single serving sort of beer. I won't hesitate to crack open my second bottle at some point, but back-to-back would be a bit much for me. The pine does overwhelm or become a little long by the end of the bottle.","GRPunk","Jul 31, 2011"
4.2,7.1,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Overall- From the aromas in the beginning right down to the last drop of deliciousness left in the glass, this is a very enjoyable beer and probably one of if not the best pilsner that I have had to date. Very enjoyable and a very well balanced and complex pilsner as well, great bitter flavours from the resin and pine needle, a nice mixed of hops and bready malts, and finishes with a somewhat sweet flavour of apricots and grapefruit. I was pleasantly surprised by this one as I had somewhat low expectations when I first picked it up at the liquor store, but am now wishing I had picked up more than just a review bottle. Would definitely pick this one up again and will be on the lookout my next trip down to Michigan.","Roke87","Jul 30, 2011"

I really like it, this one of the beer that I always anticipate Short's release, it one good and intense beer. Update, I just tried the 2013 release and this one is almost a different, it's so much more balanced without the tons of bitterness I have got in years past. I like this one almost as much as the other years, it's much more drinkable, but it doesn't have that super intense spruce flavor like years past, it's good and it seems like the intestity was toned down to enhance the drinkability, I think the Pilsener base shows up much more in the years release, it's still a damn good beer that I always look forward too.","StoutHunter","Jul 12, 2011"

The aroma is of big bold spruce, it is like sniffing a christmas tree, there are hints of lemon and citrus underneath, but the big star is the spruce. It is very inviting. The taste has a hint of lemon at first, but then big big spruce taste. Very piney and oily and very bitter. It is a very unquie taste but very enjoyable. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated. Overall it is a very solid beer, it has a bigger bolder yet smoother flavor than other spruces I have tried, overall just a very good beer, it left me wanting more.","goblue3509","Jun 06, 2011"
3.65,-6.9,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Golden Hue with a thick white head.The nose is full of hops. Some citrus, herbal, pine (spruce), slight sweetness buried somewhere beneath.

The nose is incredible with ginormous amounts of heavy spruce and pine. Really quite awesome. The taste follows down the same path. Not sure how else to describe this other than to say that the spruce character is nearly overwhelming and I absolutely love it. Bitter and resinous, the mouthfeel is killer. I could drink this until my mouth completely dried out. Delicious.","Thorpe429","Jan 03, 2011"

I always forget when Short's does something, like say use spruce needles, they go all out! Tastes hoppy and christmasy, but in a good way! First thing I noticed was spruce, then a lot of high alpha hops, finished with a huge bitterness. Spruce in the aftertaste as well. Mouthfeel is good and drinkability, I'm not sure, I only have one but I could probably drink one more. Short's doesn't play around, when they set out to do something, they do it. Good job!","Lukafer","Nov 24, 2010"

On the palate this one was crisp and somewhat syrupy, medium bodied and challenging at times (overwhelming Christmas tree here), with mint, a pine forest and some sweet malt. Although this brewery has produced a few good beers, they almost seem to experiment for the sake of experiment.","emmasdad","Nov 20, 2010"

Head hung around for a little while. Smell was nothing but pine. A deep pine smell just like you broke a branch off a pine tree and took a wiff. Tasted very piney, I mean strong pine. No alcohol taste. Had a slight bitter aftertaste of pine. Also a little on the dry side. Felt good in the mouth. Carbonation was good also. I got this bottle from a friend.

4.33,10.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a slightly gold tinged pale yellow with a fluffy and bubbly head that leaves wonderfully sticky lacing. The aroma is quite pleasing with lots of pine and nice grapefruit citrus notes. The malt component of the flavor is quite grainy and a little toasty even. Taking a sip I am blown away by this beers complexity. Spruce is definitely the first thing I pick up, but there also is a good amount of citrusy and piney hops in there. The malt backbone is fairly sweet and both toasty and slightly buttery. It mingles well with the pine flavors and makes me a believer. I am also picking up some interesting green herbal notes, and some minty medicinal qualities. The mouthfeel is medium with a fairly dry finish that coats the tongue. The drinkability on this is insane for being 10%. I dig it, and while I couldn't see myself downing these one after another, I definitely wish I had another bottle right now.","zoso1967","Aug 29, 2010"

3.67,-6.4,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,3,"This is certainly a pretty wild beer by Shorts, and it comes close to really working well. The reason it doesn't quite get there is not because it's over the top but because it slips down the slippery slope toward being medicinal. Beer and cough drops don't mix, and that flavor hurts the beer in my opinion. As I said before, it's better as it warms and if I have it again I will let it warm up before digging deeply into the glass. That's a curious approach with a pils but it helps cut the cough drop flavor. At the end of the day this is a nice effort by Shorts, but I can't call it a triumph.","number1bum","Aug 03, 2010"

Really interesting combination of aromas: hops, toasted malts and of course spruce wood. Tastes woody and crisp, with lightly toasted malt and peppery hop notes. Surprisingly light-bodied. Dry, with a powerfully bitter hop finish and slight alcohol bite that eventually fades as a lingering hop bitterness coats the tongue.

A capped 750ml bottle poured into my nonic Imperial pint glass. The lager appears a hazed golden amber color with a full two fingers of creamy off white head. Well, the aromas and flavors are certainly dominated by notes of resinous spruce sap and needles as well as pine, gin, caramel malt, grass, and grains. Moderately carbonated and nearly full bodied with a touch of alcohol as it warms. Overall, an intense dose of spruce. if you dig that flavor, enjoy the bottle alone.

4.67,19.1,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Shared very graciously by gford217 at the Brick Store Pub awhile ago. I'm fascinated by these Short's beers, and especially by this one. I happen to be a fan of that spruce flavor, and I strongly suspect that more than a few batches of spruce beers were made by the early settlers. If you like gin, you'll probably love this beer as its got that same strong piney aroma and taste- but sharper and sappier, that gin gets from juniper. Pours a hazy golden with a thin wispy head. Not too bad for a beer this strong that's been around for a while. Smells strongly of spruce and juniper, like a northern forest on a warm day, and with undercurrents of candi sugar. The taste once again spotlights the spruce with the sappy snap of pine ringing out against just enough malt to provide a nice framework for the spruce. You may or may not care for this, but for what it is I think it is perfect and very nicely balanced- this is clearly still beer, and not a spruce eau de vie. Smooth and piney, but not sticky or sappy or too bitter in the mouthfeel. Extremely interesting beer and well crafted from this most exciting brewery. Thanks a bunch, Grant. I'd been wanting to try this for a long time.","Georgiabeer","Jul 27, 2009"

4.02,2.6,4,4.5,4,4,3.5,"Poured a glimmering hazed gold. Sweet sticky alpha hop aroma, spruce, high quality caramel. Pretty wild that this still has so much aroma 2 years down the road. Sticky, resiny sweet with a building herbal spruce or spearmint flavor that culminates in a long bitter finish. Body is thick and robust for a Pilsner, there's a spicy tingle on the finish, that must be what chewing on spruce needles tastes like.

3.54,-9.7,3,4,3,4,4,"Overall: An interesting beer. It has more in common with a double IPA than a Pilsner, with spruce replacing any flavor hops. However, being a lager it lacks the fruitiness of an IPA, while at the same time the alcohol, hops and spruce overpower the bready malt nuances you get from a traditional Pilsner. Not a bad beer and worth trying, but I think this would've been better as a Double IPA (and I say that as somebody who generally prefers a nice Pilsner to an IPA).","Windigstadt","Apr 22, 2009"

It's all together too much for me, but I respect the ability of Shorts to craft something this monstrous. Mouthfeel is crisp, well-carbonated, and packs a lasting bitter finish of (you guessed it!) pine. I loved trying this beer, and it was perfect for a 3oz tasting, but there is absolutely no way I could make it through a full glass (let alone a bottle!) of this stuff.

A crown of scattered lace is left as the head slowly fades. Nose is like a pine forest just after the rain, with a bit of musk thrown in. Taste stays with this same tone with tons of up front musky pine, like liquid pine needles. When it comes down to it, it really tastes like a christmas tree. A bit of a bitter bite joins in on the back of the palate. A bit of sweetness arrives in the middle as it warms. The piney feel is just shy of harsh on the mouthfeel and throughout.

Smell is like the name, I got a huge whiff of pine mixed with some citrus and a little spice in the background inter mixing with a sweet malt profile. Taste is pine sap and lots of it but still layers of citrus and bitter sweet malt profile. Mouthfeel is light body with low carbonation.

Doughy biscuit and buttered roll malts hide behind a big wall of grapefruit and marmalade hops and an incredible fresh spruce needle/sap aroma. Wow. The name does not lie: this is a spruced beer! Conventional, herbal hop bitterness hits up front. Caramel and powdered sugar pastry malt mix with rummy fruits mid-palate. There's considerable sweetness coming from these malt flavors, but the citrus, minty, and mostly evergreen hop bitterness and the huge spruce needle/sap more than balance it out. The finish is so herbally bitter and spruce-y that I can hardly believe it. Phenomenal. Full-bodied with a syrupy feel (although the finish is drier). So intensely spruce-y and hoppy that it would be hard for even the most hophead of BAs to drink more than one bottle. But what an experience!","alexgash","Dec 31, 2007"
4.23,7.9,4.5,4,4.5,5,3.5,"Bottle # 5 of 886. An imperial pilsner brewed with northern michigan blue spruce needles. Pours honey gold in color with a slight haze, a large fluffy white head builds and slowly recedes, lacing heavily as it does so. Aroma shows some very nice citrusy sweet hops, sweet tangerines, grapefruit and oranges. Then a pine needle aroma comes in strongly, like a fresh cut christmas tree, very strong and straight up piney. Wow, the taste is pure piney-ness. Like drinking a pine soda or syrup, but its beer. There is a nice sized malty sweetness that really helps to accentuate the pine flavor. A slight perfuminess follows the pine in the finish along with some bitter and dryness and of course a pine aftertaste that blends quite well with a warming alcohol. This beer reminds me of one of the anchor osa's that was large pine flavor, but then some. This beer is incredibly unique with a great flavor and mouthfeel, but you have to like pine flavor a lot to drink all of this, which I do and did. 750mls may be a bit much for some with the flavor and the sweetness so share this beer it is intense and very extraordinary.","hoppymeal","Jun 29, 2007"
