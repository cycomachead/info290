3.88,-3.7,3.75,3.75,4,4,3.75,"Found this brew, a relatively rare style in these parts, on tap at National Beer Hall in Calgary on 10th Ave. Missed out on the funky bottle but oh well. Arrived in a pint glass (?), a cloudy gold amber color that is of course is on the light end of the Lovabond scale but still manages to look thick and imposing. Smells of concentrated sweet grains, a pungent fruity note like grape juice, another sweet note almost like brown sugar, and aggressive grassy green hops. All of these elements are reflected in the taste ... Nothing tastes quite like an imperial pils. This one is at once rich and sweet, chalky and woody, almost carbolic, and features a heady mix of green and spicy hop flavors along with some equally spicy aromatic alcohol. The thick and chewy body and buttery mouthfeel make things even more satiating. I get heavy sweet dough, dried fruits (currants, sultana raisins), candy apple, and an oaky dryness that does work to cut the sweet grains to some extent. The hops provide some additional woody tannic bitterness and funky gooseberry notes and pine in the finish. A big beer with considerable decoction malt and hop power. A pint is a lot to get through.","CalgaryFMC","Jan 16, 2014"

The bitterness doesnt seem imperialized but the alcohol and sweetness sure is. That sweetness distracts a little and ruins the overall snap, crispness and ease of drinkability I look for in a good pils. Worth trying but I probably would not revisit this again.","stakem","Dec 10, 2013"

4,-0.7,4,4,4,4,4,"750 ml ceramic bottle into lager glass, no bottle dating. Pours fairly hazy pale golden amber color with a nice 2 finger fluffy white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Dense spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a ton of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big apple, pear, bread, cracker, honey, floral, grass, pepper, pine, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance of malt, yeast ester, and hop notes; with good strength. Taste of pear, apple, bread, cracker, pepper, floral, grass, pine, honey, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruits, bread, floral, grass, pepper, pine, honey, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance of hop, malt, and yeast flavors; with a moderate malt backbone and no cloying flavors after the finish. High carbonation and medium bodied; with a very crisp, smooth, and moderately prickly mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice imperial Pilsner style. All around nice balance of malt, hop, and yeast flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","0"

It poured a hazy golden straw colour from a very cool ceramic pot-stopper bottle. The first flavour that struck me was honey, thick mellow warming honey. It had much less carbonation than normal pilsners, which I welcomed because it complemented the flavour better this way. The typical Czech yeast finish was totally buried in honey, with some grass and a pinch of hops. If it wasn't $18 a bottle I would definitely buy this very regularly.","Cookeeman","Nov 14, 2012"

The aroma is sweet malty with a strong hop presence giving it notes of grass, herbs, and citrus. The flavor is sweet malty at first, but very soon first the hops hits the tongue with notes of grass, grapefruit, hay and herbs, and then the alcohol comes a long with a power, that makes its presence known, then the alcohol resides a bit, to leave a quite acidic grapefruity note towards the quite bitter end. Now this is a complex interpretation of a pilsner.","Serge","Oct 20, 2012"

The taste was better than expected, the flavors of some sweeter malts were upfront that faded into a subtle bitterness at the end. The mouthfeel was pretty slick, not too heavy or overly carbonated.

This pilsner is labeled as 74IBU but the hop bitterness is so well integrated that there is no way that this number could be guessed. This is probably due to the obviously large malt presence. These two components are so large in this brew that any change could cause the flavor profile to go awry, but the balance between malt and hops is perfect. This super-big but suspiciously well-balanced beer, plus it's hefty 8.8%ABV, makes this is highly drinkable beer. This is an incredibly expensive beer, so it's not for everyday, but it is one that deserves it's place at special occasions. Recommended.","matt20102","Jul 16, 2010"

Some upfront fruity, piney, nutty even hop action on the nose. I tell ya, try this blind with some IPAs and I'd be impressed if many people could pick this as being an Imp Pils as opposed to an IPA.

A strong, sweet, yeast smell quite nose tingling. The aroma alone lets you know this is a step up from the rest. The sip starts off pretty mellow compared to the aroma but then it hits the back of your tongue. Strong malts (a hint of roasted?) and then the hops kick in. Just enough citrus to really enjoy it. It seems a bit more mellow than the Sam Adams version but this one has more of a mouth feel I believe. This one of those styles you don't see very often. Very well done but not too complex.

The hoppy bite comes out in the taste - it cuts but also has something that reminds me of lavender - then it goes heavy and sweet, with more hop, and finally a pleasantly bitter finish that lingers with just a hint of sweetness.

3.59,-10.9,5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"26 oz ceramic flip top bottle. I have been anxiously awaiting this one. Golden colored topped with a thick foamy off-white head and lots of lacing on the glass. Aroma is quite grassy and malty with only a touch of hops and perhaps some hay notes as well. The flavor starts with some rich french pilsner malts then turns fruity, hoppy and sour. Sour aftertaste that sits on the tongue. More of a malt presence than I expected. Better as it warms. Definitely a good beer but something was just a tad off. Way too expensive but I guess that's partly because of the bottle.","changeup45","Beers"

But for $16... there's a bit more on the market just as good for significantly less. Maybe if Rogue released this in one of their regular glass bottles rather than the fancy ceramic one I'd consider it. I found it difficult to finish in one sitting, though, so perhaps the resealable bottle wasn't such a bad thing. That said, I was trying it on its own, without food. With a good meal in front of me I'm sure the whole thing would have disappeared. Funny thing is, having eaten Morimoto's food a number of times, I don't see it pairing with his cuisine. This is not a subtle beer. Would probably go great with sweeter, more forcefully flavored Asian fare - Vietnamese or Chinese.","sanhedrin","Jul 07, 2008"

Appearance is just a tad lighter than a typical pale ale, and definitely darker than a regular pilsner. About what I expected. Head doesn't show lacing like a heavier beer, but impressive again given the style. Smell is excellent -- alcohol is noticeable but not overbearing. Tastes very good and is very drinkable, especially given 9% abv. I could pretty easily drink 2 of the bombers or probably 3 pours if on draft. Deceptively high abv.

All in all, I'm certainly impressed and feel like the style designation is apt. That said, the aroma was a bit too fruity and hoppy. As for bitterness and character, I do look for a certain spicy hop character in a pilsner, but the aftertaste borders on excessive. Other than that, the body and mouthfeel are quite pilsneresque, for an 8.8% brew. The appeareance is clear, but do I detect a slight hint of chillhaze? There is a bit of a sweet malt quality somewhere in the middle of a taste, but much less than I expected from something this strong. It must have taken quite a bit of care in the fermentation of such a beverage. Do take note: it's easy to think your drinking a light lager here... take your time.","BabaJohn","Mar 29, 2008"

I didn't have my regulation tasting snifter on hand over at my folk's place, so I used a standard straight sided water glass. The beer poured a deep golden color and was crystal clear. The head was very thick and remains until the beer was entirely consumed. The smell was musky, but had a relatively strong hop aroma. The beer had a good amount of hoppy bitterness, but also smooth malty tones in the background.

The finish was moderately bitter, but there was this weird aftertaste that I just really didn't care for, nor could I place it, kind of a grain/hay/earth thing. Pretty mild taste overall though, other then that aftertaste, ugh. Did they use some type of unusual adjunct? The alcohol, however, was inperceptable, which was this beer's biggest accomplishment. The mouthfeel was also really quite nice, a moderate body that is not at all cloying like the Imperials can often be. I would have like to seen more carbonation, as on draft at least, there basically was none. The drinkablity was low due to that aftertaste that I couldn't get used to, I was being generous with a 2.5, because I certainly didn't want another one.

It seems to me like Rogue took their fantastic uber-pilsner and tried to dry hop it, but there was not much forethought on the execution. Hops peek through about a third of the way through the beer, but nothing really develops. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both good, simply because its not that big of a beer.","Toddv29424","Sep 03, 2006"
3.85,-4.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Big ceramic bottle. Pale yellow and slightly hazy. Large white head. Hops are first impression, citrus and floral. Malt came next, a supporting role, earthy and bread-like. Flavor was similar, with the hops driving. Now I am getting floral and grassy, maybe a hint of grapefruit. Some sweetness, bread/yeast in character, shows up in the middle. Finish is a bit acidic. Light in body, medium carbonation and quite drying. Overall, an excellent beer. I will enjoy more of these despite the price.","","Sep 03, 2006"

The nose hints at light sweetness, with big white pepper and spicy hops on a bed of hay. Great, appetizing, enticing nose. On the palate, this beer is quite sweet, due to both malts and, it would seem to me, present alcohol. The mid palate is full of doughy malts, while the hops kick in at the end for a sweet and spicy finish with relatively little bitterness for a beer this big. The quality of the mouthfeel is diminished somewhat by the raw, present alcohol, and the body is thin and stretched like a rubber band. Overall, an interesting beer that suffers from too much present alcohol and too much sweetness. Not terribly drinkable, but interesting.","geexploitation","Sep 01, 2006"

Not a lot in the way of bitterness. The malts are by far the major player. Sweet and fruity. First Impilsner I've had that the malt takes center stage, but honestly I've only had two. It doesn't really have that pilsner funk that I like in some of the czech pilsners...at most a hint. Mouthfeel is very full bodied. Alcohol is deceptive since I don't really recognize it at all.

I'm not really sure which hop variety is dominating the aroma but it seems spicy and German which is kinda refreshing compared to all the American hops I've been exposed to recently.

Taste is hoppy to be sure, but less so than I confess I was hoping for, and it fades into a fairly strong buttery taste with some fruitiness in the mix as well. Mouthfeel is thicker then I'd expected, with less bite, so pretty darn good all in all. Drinkability is solid, no trace of the big ABV, making this a dangerous beer, coming as it does in the big ceramic swing top.

Overall a strong but malty pilsner with nice hop balance. Goes down easy for being as strong as it is. Great flavor and helps redifine the pilsner style. However for the price of over $10 a bottle I am not sure it is really that great. If this were a regular $3.99/22 oz I would be more impressed.

Taste is all Pilsner, but slightly sweeter and hoppier than I care for. I typically like a very dry pilsner, but maybe I'm accustomed to a German or Czech? This IS an American Double Pilsner, so I should keep an open mind. It was strong, plenty of alcohol, floral hops, mild sweet fruits, yeast. Well-balanced carbonation, sweetness and dryness make for a good mouthfeel, and if you sip this guy, you can polish off a few before you realize how housed you are.

I was pleasantly surprised, and that beer quickly became a favorite. I jumped at the chance to try the Rogue offering. It poured from the ceramic bottle a hazy gold color with a thick cream colored head that clung as a sheet of lace to the side of the glass. The nose is a piney hop character , a touch of dough, no real malt. The taste is an explosive bitterness, the pine I detected on the nose, along with loads of citrus/grapefruit. There is a mild malt back that lends a sweetness to the beer. There is a definite alcohol warming on the finish along with a subtle spiciness. Crisp mouth feel, and surprisingly drinkable. Very interesting beer, and despite the posts to the opposite, I love the new ceramic bottles.","carln26","Feb 12, 2005"

Initial flavors to this brew were crisps and full with a heavy dosage of pilsner malts and a nice sweetness. The finish was absolutely majestic with a firm hop presence that was spicy and citrusy with a lemon zest finish. There was just a final tone of alcohol just in the end but the hops really helped to hide this out. As for drinkability this one creeps up on ya because it tastes so damn good, yet you wonder where's the alcohol since the flavors are just balanced so amazingly. Overall a beer that must be sought out, especially on draft.","bigbeerdrinka","Jan 27, 2005"

Pours with initial frothiness that settles down to nothing but Casper the Friendly Ghost. Light golden color with extreme clarity, almost to a fault, with slow bubbling. Washed out light malt jam with just a touch hint of lemon and icy wash on nose. May have gone over slightly; very tart on mouth with a cilantro-like taste, but it grows and actually becomes more agreeable with the alcohol pronouncing itself and a low level malt feel. Initially suspicious of this, I ended up enjoying it.","Truh","Jan 25, 2005"

Taste is initial malt, but not sweet, almost a little carmelly or slightly burned. Hop hits initially a little "musty" - I am wondering if this is an older bottle. Although I would imagine the earthenware would protect this beer amazingly well, maybe the dry hop aromas have aged out a bit because there is no citrus. The hop reminds me a little of drinking a highly hopped English ESB past its prime. Musty. Still pretty enjoyable because of the real smack in the face bitterness that lingers on.

This is an interesting experiment, but for me it fails miserably, Pilsners are not supposed to be Imperial, itÂ’s a fancy pants brew that I guarantee you will only ever buy once. This is clearly a Hoi-Polloi exhibit for an Art Gallery aimed at Americans that donÂ’t travel, if you catch my drift. Imperial Pilsner is really an Oxy-Moron for me, but I will be more than happy to try the first Double-Lite beer, so I suggest that you try this if you get chance, its damn good - but its not a practical brew by any stretch of the imagination. In short it's the Classic British Sports Car that you always wanted but can't be arsed to maintain.

The aroma contains orange, coriander, sweetish grains, along with grassy and flowery hops. The flavour is comprised of spicy coriander, pepper, orange peel, toasted biscuity malt, mild hebal hops, and is a bit yeasty. Carbonated mouthfeel, mildly abrasive texture on the finish.

When it first hits the tongue, it seems in danger of being overwhelmingly sweet. Quickly, however, things come together with a healthy hop bite. Floral aromas carry over into the flavor, as does a nice alcohol kick. This is a dangerously drinkable beer and one worthy of its hefty price.","mickeymac","Sep 06, 2004"

The taste is sweet, thickly malty, with lots of hops, but it could actually use a bit more hops to balance out the thick maltiness. This is definitely enjoyable, the spicy hop flavor and bitter finish are quite nice. There is a bit of hot alcohol, which does detract slightly. With this hopping level, if this had been stepped back to a 7% alcohol, it would have been just about perfect. As it is it is just a bit too malty for my tastes.","Gueuzedude","Aug 17, 2004"

Mostly sweet, resiny and husky tasting with a significant hop crispness in the middle and finishing clean tasting, then a slight alcohol burn in the aftertaste. Pretty darn good for a high octane pils. I like pilseners a lot and I've only tried a few of the newer "Imperial" style. This one's quality, overall, it maintains a pilsener feel, yet "Imperial" in that newfounded phrase. I think the beauty of this beer is that it maintains the basic pilsener feel, yet exponentially crafted in its root style.

Gentle wafts of sugar cookie rich in vanilla and fresh cut grass with a floral twang. Mellow, but enticing aromawise. In flavor, prevalent in malt character is a doughy, buttery, rounded impression of underbaked Challah. Complementing is a stately floral, almost perfume like hop flavor that couples with malt sweetness to lend a suggestion of concentrated nectar a notch shy of honey. Hop bitterness is mild, serving only to offset residual sweetness, thus allowing the pervasive bready sweetness to prevail. Burly, viscous, lusciously dextrinous mouthfeel. As the beer warms, notes of hay and bread crust arise, but remain understated. Finishes sweet, with a fleeting hint of caramelized almond and sugared dough. Quite a unique and delicious brew, indeed. A bit too buttery and sweet to retain base pilsner characterisitics, but a fine brew in itself. If a doppelhellesbock were a style, this would epitomize it. Outstanding.","marc77","Jun 27, 2004"

It poured a clear golden orange color with an excellent white head that dropped to a cap of bubbles about half way through. This one left a decent lacing around the glass as it was drank. The aroma consists of mainly citrus hoppiness with a slight biscuity malt attempting to balance it out. The taste starts of with a bitter hop spiciness that it accompanied by earthy notes as well, malt presence is minimal in the taste. Mouthfeel is good with good carbonation.

Over two fingers of fluffy white head tried its best to hold pat. After a few moments it subsided to about half the original size and then it collapsed to a tight cap. The subsequent lacing was very widespread and it looked like old, slightly tattered wallpaper. This is a very striking looking beer. The nose is a little raw with big, warm, alcohol notes, in conjunction with some strawberry like fruitiness. Honestly this smells like a Belgian ale of sorts! The hops are noticeable but they are not bright and they donÂ’t really remind of any Pils I have had. The hops are floral and herbal, very nice. The malt was largely undetectable. I like the bouquet, it is unique, and it reminds me a little bit of Duvel (with less potency). Inviting. The palate has a big blast of hops upfront, now this is what I am looking for! The hoppy flavors are great; it is very herbal (somewhat flowery too) with all sorts of little flavors sprouting off. Some lemon notes, pears, and white wine. The straight bitterness is above moderate and very fitting. The alcohol punch is strong and it creates heat that is very noticeable on the back of the throat. Add in some peppery notes and faint strawberry-like fruitiness and you have one winner of a palate here! Again, it has some underlying Belgian qualities, IÂ’m digging that, and, yes, I realize that Czech Pilsner Yeast was used. The malt is thin but Pilsner-like, clean and crisp. This is damn tasty and far more complex then I was expecting. The 8% plus abv is really working in this beer, I just love the dimensions it adds. I am very impressed. Surprisingly long aftertaste, mainly of raw heat and residual hops bitterness, in other words this beer burnt one wicked imprint into my tongue! Medium/medium-full in body, the carbonation is low but natural and the mouthfeel is quite good. Filling. The drinkability is fantastic! It truly is for such a big beer. IÂ’d imbibe in this regularly if it were less expensive and found in Omaha. My girlfriend purchased me a bottle in Iowa City for around $12 (thanks Tara!). It was worth every penny!

4.26,5.7,5,4,4.5,4,4,"Between the awesome ceramic bottle and the beautiful pour topped with a luscious three-finger head and massive amount of lacing left behind, this is the most beautiful beer I've ever seen. The smell is very clean with a solid punch of grassy hops, and it tastes like you'd expect -- a pilsner on steroids. Mouthfeel is on the thin side, but I suppose that's normal for the style. Nearly 9% abv? Where's it hiding? Overall the ultimate summer's day beer and another feather in Rogue's cap.","altctrlsdelete","Mar 18, 2004"
3.45,-14.4,4,4,3,3.5,3.5,"I didn't like the taste as much as I was hoping I would. Starts out a bit sweet with a pleasant malty taste followed by a piney hop flavor. This is all overpowered by a strong alcohol flavor that lingers long into the aftertaste. It isn't bad at first but half way through it just starts to take over. This isn't a bad beer there just isn't much for the alcohol to hide behind.","Bruiser81","Mar 15, 2004"

4,-0.7,4,4,4,4,4,"This was interesting and not bad. I didn't find it great, but was surprised to find that it wasn't the bad monster pilsner I thought it could be. I had tried only a very small sample at the CS at the last BA beer fest. I wasn't sure what to think. So this past weekend ordered a bottle at Anam Cara. The bottle is very nice, a lovely ceramic with swing top and graphics, I took it home. The pour was a cloudy light golden. I found the aroma to be reminiscent of a thick jellied candy aroma...it was not thin and treacily, but really just what I wrote: thick and like jellied candy. I found the mouthfeel to be full-bodied: thick and chewy. The alcohol tried to hide, but I could tell. In spite of that, it was a well-rounded beer that was smooth but strong. I think this beer is it's own category, and I just couldn't find the pilsner qualities that are contained in it's name. Not a bad beer, but not outstanding.","PatandDavid","Mar 13, 2004"

4.25,5.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"On tap at Max's on Broadway. With a slight cloudiness that didn't bother me in the slightest, it left some measurable lace. The color was yellowish and the head puffy and fine. An Imperial Pilsner has plenty of malt backbone and a detectable bit of alchohol. Enjoyable all the way down, with a Saazzy aroma and a lingering bite. I'd rate it more drinkable if it were a bit less powerful. But I'd definitely have another anytime.","farHillsBrewer","Mar 10, 2004"

Anyway, this nectar is found within a magnificent ceramic bottle that weights about 10 pounds. Pours a striking golden color with a lofty inviting creamy head. Smell if of Saaz hops, some other aromatic hops, and sweet malts. Full bodied and smooth as a zambonied ice rink. Full malt flavors backed by a mango-like subtle sweetness and a very flavorful dose of those hops. Goes down very smooth and easy. I could drink this all the time.","chaduvel","Mar 06, 2004"
4.3,6.7,4,4,4.5,5,4,"On tap poured into a pilsener glass. It pours a cloudy gold color with two fingers of head. There is lots of sticky lace left on the glass. The smell is fairly hoppy, the sterling hops are interesting. Good malty aromas as well. The taste starts malty and grassy, and ends with a floral hop punch. Very well balanced. Just a hint of alcohol on the finish. The mouthfeel is thicker than any other pilsener could possibly get. The drinkability is fairly good for a 8.8% brew. An awesome pils!","SheepNutz","Feb 20, 2004"
4.77,18.4,4.5,5,5,4,4.5,"Simply fantastic. A 9% beer that drinks like it's 5.5%. If this was a regular beer (are you listening Rogue?), this would certainly be something I'd drink regularly. Hopefully this will enter the regular Rogue rotation and I'll be able to have it again.","beergeek279","Feb 14, 2004"
3.58,-11.2,4,3.5,4,3,3,"It has a bright golden color and big hoppy aroma that is spicy, floral, and slight cirtus. It is medium bodied with a crisp, dry, very bitter, herbal finish. Big on hops and alcohol, which is hidden very well. The lager equivalent of the Imperial IPA. I think it was a little syruppy. I know it needed to be to stand up to the bitterness. This is not a beer that I can drink a lot of even though I enjoyed it.","ark57","Feb 08, 2004"
4.3,6.7,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"The beer pours a hazy gold color with a thin white head that eventually fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice pale malt and hop scent; very appealling. The taste is good also. This beer has an elevated abv, but it goes down smooth with a slight warmer at the finish. It has a nice balance of pale malts and hops which make it quite enjoyable. This is a pilsner I can get used to. The mouthfeel is just right. This is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. I love this beer. Rogue is probably my favorite brewery. They just push the envelope every time. Only they can take a simple, boring, beer style and turn it into something great. It drinks very well.","WesWes","Feb 07, 2004"
3.45,-14.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3,"This was a nice beer, but the overpowering alcohol flavor and aroma detracted from my overall enjoyment. The first few minutes that it was in my glass was very nice, and I took that into consideration in my numbers. But very quickly, this beer turned into an alcoholfest. In my opinion, it was worth the $14.00 one time to try it, but I doubt that I will pick up any more.","Quaffer","Feb 04, 2004"

4.42,9.7,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Thickish pour with a marmalade color. Head is scant and thinnish but leaves a lot of dotty laces. Very nice malt, lightly bready with a shortbread feel and honey sweetness. Some sense of an orangey quality that transitions into a sparkling and very well-done hopiness. Light nutmeg sensations. Very close to perfectly balanced. While straying away from a Pilsner in many ways, lagering seems to make this "Imperial" brew plenty easy to quaff, despite respectable alcohol. Rogue does another fine beer with this one.","ADR","Jan 06, 2004"
4.05,0.5,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Great painted ceramic bottle that was capped yet has a swing top attached as well. Poured a slightly hazy bright gold with a huge head that settled down to a not so huge head. Aroma reminds me of a Wit style with wheat malt and yeast in the nose. Maybe it's my imagination though. Also detect quite a bit of hops in the aroma and sweetness from the malt as well. This aroma is a big and bold one to be sure. I wasn't sure what an Imperial Pilsner would be like, but now it makes sense to me with the latest trend in super charged styles. Just double up on malt and hops and you've got an Imperial-fill in the blank brew. Body is really full and smooth. Flavor is also a strong one with sweet malt leading the way along with some hops blending in. This is a big beer and if you like big bold beers such as the Imperial class, you will like this one for sure. It's not a to style pils and doesn't claim to be one either. Enjoy it for what it is.","BierReise","Dec 31, 2003"
3.58,-11.2,3.5,3,4,3.5,3.5,"Drinkability...well it was a good tasting beer. However for the price, I'll stick with other brews. Not worth the cash. I wonder if it was in a regular glass bottle instead of a ceramic swingtop if it would be cheaper. Then I might consider it. Maybe.","stegmakk","Nov 29, 2003"
4.52,12.2,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours cloudy golden color with a white head that laces the glass. Earthy smell of hops with a twinge of grain round out the nose. Tastes malty sweet with a strong earthy-spicy hop / grainy malt mixture coming out to tantalize the pallet. Upon second tasting is a much more complex beer then my initial first taste. No alcoholic flavors permeate and thus is extremely drinkable while you can still stand. The cool bottle is just a bonus and I wish this beer was available in standard packaging and also be available to other markets.","leeenglewood","Nov 21, 2003"
3.72,-7.7,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Nice deep golden body with some cascading bubbles. The head average size, bright white and lasted a reasonable amount of time. Good lacing. Sweet, slightly grassy aroma, a bit of pine, but mostly noble hop aromas. Sandy malt flavor, but not dry. Easy drinking given the size of the beer. A little fruit (almost like apricots or peaches.) Tasty, but there's something missing almost.","aracauna","Nov 18, 2003"
4.48,11.2,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,5,"At $12.99 for 26 oz., it is not a beer I could make a habit of, but I heartily recommend everyone picking up at least one.

Great bottle yes, but great beer is it's own reward.","RonfromJersey","Nov 14, 2003"
3.16,-21.6,4,3,3,4,3,"cool bottle, bought a case (6 bottles) for $54 at a PA distributor. Was stamped Oct 15th on the box (brew date??). This was a very good beer but it's more like a bitter then a pilsner. It has a nice malt flavor and the yeast of a good pilsner but way overhopped for this style. I was surprised just how bitter (and good) it was. if you don't like hoppy beers I wouldn't recommend this. I like it.","tommarino","Nov 08, 2003"
4.5,11.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This beer came in a way-cool re-sealable, ceramic 750ml bottle with japanese writing and iron chef Morimoto's signature on it. It poured out a dark golden colour with a very bleach white head. The aroma was very hoppy, citric, and yet still quite malty. This really smelled like a hopped up, high octance version of a classic czech pilsener such as budvar or pilsner urquell. The taste was definately unique, but still very "pilsner-ish". This beer tasted heavily of fresh, citric hops and heavy background malts. It was very well balanced. The mouthfeel was not too thick or cloying and the drinkability was quite excellent...","francisweizen","Oct 13, 2003"

It pours a hazy brassy gold with a creamy white head. A biscuity cracker-like malt houses a lemony bitterness. Orange peel and a lightly astringent taste linger in the background. A slightly tart quinine-like effervescence makes for an unusual mouthfeel. This brew only sweetens a little as it warms. Warming alcohol can be noticed throughout. Thanks to Genaro for bringing this back from Newport, OR.","BeerResearcher","Sep 12, 2003"
4.3,6.7,3.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Sample was 22oz cerami swing top bottle. Pours a nice light blonde with a pillowy white foam head. The head lingers nicely and laces well down the side of the glass. The smell is crisp with the floral sents of the hops. The taste echos the smell, crisp pilsner bite. But if a regular pilsner bites like a dachshund this think is a doberman. Malts and Hops are notched up to the breaking point.. But never give in. This is one impressive beer. Smooth drinking and well balanced. One could drink this for days, except for that pesky 8.8abv. One of the best Rogue products ive had. plus it comes in that handy dandy resealable bottle, which could be used for left over beer from 750s or 22s.","TinusTime","Aug 25, 2003"

The color is an attractive pale straw yellow with a large fluffy white head, and heavy lacing that bands the inside of the glass. Might be my imagination, but the aroma smells almost...ceramic! Wonder if it's the packaging. As for the taste...imagine a regular old pilsner...on steroids. Everything is more pronounced, but still balanced. More hop, more malt...yet it remains relatively true to the style. There's a nice fruit character to the malt. The hops predominate on the finish, but are not overpowering. I'm intrigued by this beer, since it's the first non-ale I've had from Rogue. Not sure if it's worth the pricetag, but an intriguing brew and definitely worth a try.","queenboadicea","Aug 23, 2003"

I can't wait until they bottle this! Poured a brilliant golden with a big white head. Smell is mostly Saaz hops but sweet malts detectable. Taste is sweeter than your Prima pils up front--good malt presence--but a perfect dose of Saaz hops smoothly takes over along with an almost fruity element as well. Very interesting and unbelievably drinkable for an 8.8% abv beer. Awesome.","alexgash","Beers"
