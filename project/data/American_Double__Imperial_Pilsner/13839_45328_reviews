"Not a style that you find a lot of, so I'd hope that Port delivers on this. Unfortunately, it misses the mark for me. A bit too much booze and not enough character. Drinkable, sure. But the whole thing could be a lot better. One of my least favorite from Port."

"D - Pretty drinkable. Feels a bit rough and a bit warm. Needed some more flavors to balance out the body and booze."

"A big, thick, and heavy imperial pilsner. There's nothing here I particularly liked, and I didn't finish my pint, though this is not at all a bad beer."
"Appearance is a deep yellow with a 1/2 finger head, that leaves some lace after a few sips. It has a smell of sugar, hops, lemon and bread. The taste has grass, hops, lemon and a bit of grapefuit, a sweet beer. MF is light-medium, with moderate carbonation. A good imperial pilsner, which cloacks its` abv well, so be sure to sip."
"Just popped the top of a stinger of Panzer Pilsner from Port Brewering and poured in to my new fish bowl thick chalice style glass!!! The beer pour a orange cloudy color with very thin white head. The scent carried alcohol and sweetness from an orange peel. The taste is heavy with alcohol and the attempted balance of malt and hop. The body is full making this a big beer. The mouthfeel is slightly downgraded due to teh alcohol. I am glad to have tried it tho."
"O - As much as I think this is a dumb style I really do like this beer and most others like it as they liven up a boring beer and add flavor to it this is a very easy to drink beer and ont thats worth getting if you see it around"
"Poured a clear copper color with an average frothy white head that was lasting and produced excellent lacing. Good moderate to heavy earthy leather hop and small malt aroma. Medium to full body with a smooth dry slick texture and soft carbonation. Moderate to heavy bittersweet flavor with with a moderate to heavy bittersweet finish of moderate to long duration. This is a standout beer and best of style I have had."
"Would be a very good beer if the alcohol heat was tamed a little bit, but nonetheless, still likeable."
"NICE BEER, SEEK IT OUT!"
"Narrative: She just swerved out into the road, her eyes in the headlights, oh god! WHY DIDN'T I JUST DRIVE THE SPEED LIMIT! Her body laying mangled in the road, do I call the police? No..I..I just cant think! Oh wait, what's my motivation in this scene? ""Line?"" "Your line is..'life will never be the same again.'"" The gravity of this scene just seems to be escaping me, I am just far too relaxed and enjoying thoughts of the beach to be thinking about this old homicide re-enactment seems so petty. ""Sorry, just having a tough time focusing on how serious my character should be what with it being such a nice day outside...does anyone else notice that light breeze?"" "Jennings, you need to focus we have to shoot this while we still have the light, now pull it together."" Deep down I know there's a serious situation but I am too busy enjoying this moment to care."
"Drink- This was a nice beer. Tasty and flavorful and pretty balanced. A bit of a leaner to the malty side. I might not come back to this one. Was a bit thick for me in terms of style."
"Totally out of control head easily fills half the glass with an average pour, just off-white with a loose construction, you really feel it pop against your lips as you sip, more hills and vales than dimpling, lacing all but completely slides down the glass sides. Lightly filmy yellow to orange colored liquid, achieves a full translucent depth, few bubbles visible but they are large and move slowly. The nose retains that pretzel dough, crusty quality with salt and pepper notes, however, more raw herbaceous bite than might be expected, peat and earth, then dried orange and lemon peels, briefly passing peach and apple scents, stiff and penetrating, allows few moments to relax. Full-bodied with a plush and creamy mouth feel, the carbonation is sneaky in how it covers ground cheek to cheek to add further fluff. At first much sweeter than the nose might suggest, grapefruit and orange as much pulp as zest. Aided and abetted by pine sap then appears milk chocolate and some pressed flowers. Apple, peach, apricot fruit competent, still, gets successively drier towards the finish. Offers less yeast, dough, bread than in the nose, maybe it’s the dryness. Keeps the hoppy bite while avoiding bitterness. Just leaves you feeling it’s more of a DIPA than anything else. That said, it’s fun albeit more “interesting” than mindlessly enjoyable."
"Overall this is a good beer and a decent IP. I may never find another I truly love but I will keep looking."
"O - Good beer but will probably wait till next year to drink again"
"Enjoyed on 3/17/11 in a Pilsen glass. Egg yellow color. Foggy almost opaque body. Headed with a very dense, close & lasting foam. Thick layer, yellowish center & lemon yellow circle. Subtle malty but intense hoppy aroma, kind perfumed. Heavy & dry bitterness all over - feel the chains of a Panzer tank rolling on your tongue. The aftertaste keeps the dry bitterness but refreshing flavor. Excellent drinkability no matter alcohol level."
"Panzer is a nice change of pace from an IPA or DIPA. It's a pleasant beer but after finishing it I kind of wish I would have grabbed a Mongo instead."
"9/10"
"Very good beer, highlighted by the drinkability of water after a 40 mile bike ride. Port? Any time you want to branch out to Minnesota, & bring your hops with you, I'm game. Thanks."
"A lively pour that induces a very thick, white foam head. Hazy gold that drops bright as the beer warms. Fresh, dank hops in the nose with plenty of floral notes. Smooth. Creamy. Up front bite of alcohol, heat and spice. Bready, biscuity malts. Sugary sweet. Suggestions of honey. Fruity; apples, tropical. Hoppy, bitter and assertive with decent doses of citrus, herbal and resins. Coarseness and astringency. Bone-dry, bitter finish with alcohol fumes on the breath. Perhaps a bit too hot and sweet, and could use some cleaning up, but other than that, it is what it is ... a big American Pils, brewed like a tank, hopped-up and ready to kick your ass."
"While there are some good things going on here, the bad parts become way too much and way too soon. Thankfully I'm fixing some food, so hopefully I can manage to finish this bottle."
"First beer of the night on Christmas eve. Paired with a salad at dinner. Served in a pilsner glass. Pours with a very light yellow golden body, and lots of carbonation. Heavy white head forms atop the glass. Smell was very malty and bready. Taste was on the hoppy side for a pilsner. Also, this beer had a very clean and crisp taste, which I enjoyed. Mouthfeel was smooth and the drinkablility was easy. Surprised to see an abv of 9.5% on the bottle - dangerous; would never guess that. Highly drinkable and high in alcohol might be an interesting combination."
"I can feel the buzz already (9.5%!) at the end of this bomber (duh!), and the lack of redeeming flavors fails to make this the imperial pilsner to make me like imperial pilsners."
"Linger: 3"
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, strong kick, good representation of style, it's a decent beer but there are others in the style that I would choose first."
"D- They need to rework this one before I'll touch it again. At present, it's a mixed bag."
"An unusual beer, that doesn't really fit the style. Flavor and feel are too heavy to hold much pilsner character. Very malty, with spicy German hop, and a Belgianesque yeasty funk."
"Overall a rather bland big beer, so over the top sweet and grainy it doesn't really have much pilsner quality to it."
"D: Very good beer and definitely should be in the top 5 in it's class."
"D: Thank goodness, it's not as bad as before. Actually, it's pretty decent. I'm still somewhat skeptical, but for now, this beer has redeemed itself."
"M/D: Medium bodied, carbonation is slightly high. Drinkability is pretty good. Overall, a solid if not outstanding beer."
"Really interesting. Highly recommended for anyone who likes pilsners, hops, and big brews. I couldn't see myself putting away more than a bomber's worth though."
"Poured from a 22oz into my Ommegang Goblet. Really nice white fluffy, foamy head, about 2 fingers high. Decent retention and laces quite nicely. Smells straight up Pilsnery, spicy, appley. Can't wrap my mind around the flavor. A medium malty sweetness, but then there's the German hops. A good deep lingering bitterness. Nice piney spiciness. But then there's the sweetness. Nice carbonated mouthfeel, creamy. Tastes a bit hot though."
"D - Drinkability is actually very good for an Imperial Pils. While there is a slight alcohol tang, it never becomes too obtrusive."
"D: don't really like the pilsner style but I guess double the ingridients make the cut."
"D: Not a fan"
"Clear golden body, some rising carbonation, big 3 finger rocky slowly dissipating head, significant lacing. Very hoppy nose for the style, smells like PNW hops, malts overwhelmed by hoppiness. Taste is tres hoppy, spicy with a bit of noble pine, a bit of sweet malts on back end but once again subsumed by hops. Mouthfeel is full, some effervescence. Very confusing beer, not close to style, alcohol quite prevalent, at this high ABV one is enough. Too be honest, I don't get a Pilsener taste as much as I do a Imperial Pale Ale like Lompoc C-Note. Worth a try for those BAs looking for uber-hoppy pilseners."
"My first foray into imperial pilsners, and most likely my last. Not that this was a bad beer-- it's simply that pilsners are brewed the way they are for a reason: they're light and refreshing. An imperial pilsner (this one, at least) is neither. It smells decent enough, with a bit of the lemony-orange that a regular pilsner has, but doesn't have much of a head. And it tastes decent enough, with a modicum of lemon and fizz, but not enough of either to really do the job of a pilsner. The 9.5% abv is not a huge presence; there's almost no warmth (thank goodness) and there's no scent of alcohol to speak of. The extra malt is nice, and the citrus from the extra hops is okay, but surprisingly enough there's not a lot of bite. In fact, I've had plenty of regular pilsners that packed more sting. I'll stick with those."
"D- very good. I approve. 4.0"
"D - Pretty easy to get down, just not entirely sure I'd want to do tons of this. Not unpleasant, but won't miss this one if I don't cross it again."
"This is a very interesting beer as I haven't seen many Imperial Pilsners out there. Considering a pils is a difficult style to brew and given the fact Port can squeeze 9.5% out of this beer, I'm really impressed. Coming from Port Brewing, I expected this to be an extreme beer and one that would be heavily hopped, as they seem to do on many of the beers, especially the IPA's which is why they have become one of my favorite craft brewers. Nice job, PBC!"
"Port Brewing's Panzer Imperial Pilsner is interesting. I find every imperial pilsner interesting because I don't quite understand it. Good beer when its going down but bitter after. Would be complemented by some cheese, perhaps, but what wouldn't? Another beer made in the west coast. Huge in all aspects. Needs something to balance out that finnish. Is it the water?"
"Tastes like it smells, big and well balanced. Only the hops are much more aggressive, much more varied. Big yeast, sweet bread, sourdough, weeds, flowers, grapefruit, raisins. Very very nice."
"Drinkability is pretty good, a satisfyingly sturdy pils and fine example of the style, but not one I need another of anytime soon."
"overall for a pils it was pretty good, not your typical skunky tasting brew."
"Not bad, but not what i hoped for. I can't believe I think a Port beer needs more hops."
"Overall, this is a loaded brew in terms of flavor and balance. It lives to its name of an extreme pilsner."
"D: Meh, I'd pass on a second bottle. Knock this sucker in half and I think it'd be a pretty damn good pilsner, but this is just too much. This beer is in no way offensive, but it just doesn't work for me. I'll have no problem finishing the bomber, it isn't too bad for overall drinking, but there's just better beers in this price/abv range that I'd rather spend my money on."
"OVERALL I liked it better when I had it the first time, on tap, and will likely try it again. But this sample didn't live up to my memory of the first sample. Though the pilsner character is identifiable, this is an IIPA, not an ""imperial pilsner," in my view. It's an interesting brew, and adventurous hop heads would do well to try it."
"Palate has a clean character with some dry herbal flavors. Finish is hoppy with some alcohol peeping through."
"the flavor was light tasting, seemingly reasonable alcohol (a trick!) but overall, not very good. indeed, a friend accused the beer as assuming a false poor homebrew quality. i can only assume this to be a result of a bad combination in the recipe, or perhaps a result of the low carbonation, seemingly a persistent problem of these otherwise fine folks down in socal."
"Bottle: Poured a hazy golden color lager with a small foamy head with minimal retention and some light lacing. Aroma of dry European hops with some grainy malt notes. Taste is a mix between some some dry European hops with subtle floral notes and light astringency. Malt is dominated by grainy notes and doesn't really fits well with the beer. Body is full with limited filtration and carbonation is too low for style. Not my favorite style but I still think the malt and hops were not in perfect agreement and carbonation was too low for the style."
"Pours a bright sunshine straw yellow color that has just a touch of haze. No bubbling and no head or foam to speak of. Thin fruity aroma with the dry, faintly toasted malts. The abv. adds a big splash of heat in the nose. The taste has a strong warm feel throughout the entire palate. That being said, you can get some apricots and hot, thin bread in that alcofuel heat. The finish is a slow relieving heat from the abv. Nice try from Port Brewing Co., but I expecetd a little more. Would taste better if you could drink a whole 22 oz bottle before it gets slightly warm."
"I like hops, but I need balance, and I'm not sure this has it. I'm glad I sampled this, but 22 oz. is a bit large and I'd have been happier with a 12 oz. serving."
"22oz bottle. Orange-gold color with a medium sticky white head and lots of sediment at the end. Aroma of sweet oranges and lots of spicy hops. The flavor has a solid foundation of paler malt that is sweet but clean in its profile, then there are a ton of citrucy and spicy hops with definite grapefruit flavors. The finish is very hoppy and bitter but balanced by a pretty big sweetness. Medium-full body with a lightly mouth-coating texture and medium-intense carbonation. I really enjoyed this, though the finish could have been dryer. I think they nailed the hop profile but could probably tweak the malts an bit on the next go around."
"D - Sweet, bready, corn and slightly heavy do not make for an easily drinkable beer."
"3.5 D: I can't imagine having more than a bomber of this. It's too hot for that. Good, not great."
"D - This is a tasty Imperial Pils which is pretty strong flavored as the 9.5% is not really hidden, but it is a pleasant beer and fits the style."
"D - this beer tastes and feels like it was brewed with supreme drinkablity in mind. in what is essentially a well constructed pils with twice the alcohol, this could be dangerous!"
"Overall- The high alc. ruins it. Drinkable but too boozy."
"Drinkability - OK, I know this is a big beer and it's not going to taste like a classic Pils, but this was just downright horrible and a huge disappointment from one of my favorite breweries. Stick to what you know, guys."
"Decent feel though a bit towards corn syrup in body. Drinkability is unimpressive as the thick oily body surely outweighs any malt complexities or hop notes. Any sense of a 'pilsner' is remote."
"I would say this is beer is what I expected. It's an imperial pils, not just a double pils, which made me expect a big pils with the balance tilted to the hop side. I've had hundreds of small brewery fresh German pils, and they are more bready and hoppy than anything that makes it to the states. The core of this beer reminds me of some of my favorite examples."
"This beer is very hop forward and lingers into a bready yeasty body with a decent pilsner malt backbone. Slight earthy grass notes are followed by a very astringent strong alcohol finish. I don't really know how you could call this a pilsner. It seems like they pitched some pilsner malt into some kind of hoppy alcohol juice. Way too hoppy and too much of an alcohol presence. The body is full with some of the above mentioned bready yeast but the ABV is not masked at all. This beer is kind of a sloppy mess. They just hopped up some ingredients and slapped the word imperial on there. Avoid this one."
"All that said, it's a Pilsner, and after 20 minutes it's wicked warm. So, it may not drink as cleanly as your average bear. But it's still damn good."
"M/D: From sweet to dry, this beer surprises. Not only is the malt profile strange, but the alcohol seems to play almost no role in the flavor. As a result, this is one dangerous beer...As delicious as it is, I am not sure how many you could get away with drinking."
"Some hop aroma is present in the glass when poured. this definitely looks like a pilsner but drinks like something much stronger."
"drinkability - if i think of this beer as an ipa it drinks well but slow down its 9.5%"
"Firm residual hoppiness, warm buttered bread, simple and fresh, with a bitter hop and apple duality. Amazingly light, yet retaining the richness of a 9.5% malt bomb. Medium bodied and very dry, with a tacky finish. Plenty of firm, lasting bitterness in the end too. So dry it was like licking a 2x4...but in a good way. For what it is, it delivers the hops and malt like no other Pils i've had."
"d - while this is a lager, the intensity of the bitterness and alcohol on this beer takes it well out of the traditional lager drinkability realm, I would think of this more along the lines of a not-so-balanced DIPA in terms of drinkability, this gets point here for being much more interesting than most lagers, however"
"Pours a dark golden with a fairly short head that fades to nothing almost instantly. Smells hot, with lots of lager yeast, and some notes of stored apples and grain as well as some firm malt. Any hoppiness is pretty overwhelmed by the fruit and the heat from the alcohol. The taste is less hot, but still very fruity with nectarine and apple as well as quite a bit of bitter herbal hops. A little sweet up front and quite a lingering bitterness on the end. Quite bitter, and quite hot, and not all that balanced. The somewhat sweet, very ripe fruit up front doesn't really match with the very long, dry bitterness, which doesn't really match with the hot alcohol. Not my favorite from this brewery."
"Pours a light golden color with a fizzy white head. Aromas of citrus, grassy malts, herbal hops and a touch of alcohol. Taste also has a nice fruity presence balanced by bitter hops. Big body comes off a bit thick. Crisp carbonation. Quite the hoppy pilsner from Port."
"Rotation: not available here. If it was, one is probably enough for me (style)"
"Drinkability - After the first few sips, in which I can easily taste the alcohol, it becomes more drinkable. As it warms up it begins to taste better. After one bomber I am feeling pretty good. An interesting try by Port but just not really doing it for me."
"Not sure on the style."
"Conclusion: I wasn't real impressed with this one...it's big and powerful, and it did grow on me throughout the pint as it warmed a bit and a big more malt flavor emerged, but this is a bit rough and over the top for me."
"im not too keen on this pilsner although ive heard alot of good things! i poured it off without much head being produced and the beer was good going down but the after taste really steered me away! the price is great for 26 oz i paid like 4 dollars and its a whopping 9.5% alcohol!"
"D - This is a rich beer with a firm kick. I haven't got much experience with big pilsners but this one grew on me over the course of the bottle."
"drinkability is great. for an imperial pilsner, this is a solid example; everything great about a fresh pils only twice as concentrated. cheers!"
"This is a drinkable brew, but the ABV is very apparent & shows itself quickly. I find it more like a weak DIPA than an Imperial Pils."
"Nothing really wrong with this offering but just not a whole lot going on. I suppose I expected a little more something, it just seems as though it's a regular pilsner with added abv."
"D- This beer is pretty drinkable despite the hefty ABV and a somewhat heavy mouthfeel. I made short work of my 22oz bottle."
"This beer if really quite good, drinkable and goes well with food. Front finish if fruity and orange lemony that goes to a rich smokey pine and resin. All in all a very impressive effort."
"The beer is very well carbonated and the crispness is really nice. The beer is really approachable and not overwhelming in any way, something that I feel like I could drink all day, despite the high abv. The only negative thing I can say about this beer is that I feel like more hop flavor would put it over the top in my book, so it just leaves me wondering ""what if?"". But I always want more hops...."
"This is an interesting, and pretty tasty bev. Nothing awesome, but very nice, and an interesting style. I'm always happy to try something new from Port."
"Nice job Port! Much love to swnicholson for this one."
"This is a pretty hefty beer for the style with a strong herbal presence as well as a noticeable alcohol kick. It's not the most drinkable brew but it's tasty."
"Smell is very hoppy. More than you would expect from a pils. Flavor is very nice. Very crisp, clean and aggressively hopped. I'm really enjoying this beer. Good flavor and very inviting to drink."
"Poured from bottle in my duvel tulip. Two finger off white head that has soapy bubbles as it falls, leaving spotty lacing on the glass. Body is amber and transparent with initial bubbles of carbonation that slow to a crawl. I can almost get a solid identification off this a foot away from the hoppy aroma, primarily grapefruit on the nose. Smooth on the palette, hops dominate, but I almost get a belgian yeast back there, hidden funky flavors. Alcohol comes out on the tongue after a few sips, a slight sweetness there. Tasty."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, zesty, with a bitter hop pop in the finish."
"Pours a hazy gold color with 1/2 inch of foamy eggshell colored head. OK retention and some lacing. Smells of oranges, pineapple, grass, pale malts, and honey. Tastes of spicy hops, pineapple, oranges, mango, and ginger up front then honey, biscuits, and caramel with a finish of dry grasses, some pine resin, and alcohol warmth. Medium in body with nice poppy carbonation. Smooth with a crisp finish. A little too much hop character throughout for a pils, but still good stuff that I'd pick up again."
"Decent stab at the style here but this was just a bit too hefty in the feel to be totally enjoyable for me. Maybe a bit less beef or some heftier flavors to help mask some of it would have been nice."
"Drinkability: I have found Imperial Pilsners to be hit or miss; while this one misses the style somewhat and is more like a DIPA, I rather liked it, particularly the pineapple flavor"
"What is not to like about this beer? Pours bright, cloudy gold with an exploding white head. The usual clove, spice, and grass, are here, but with mango, pepper, and herbs from the added hops. Creamy, smooth mouthfeel. The sweet lagery tastes blend well with the hops. More clove and bananas in the flavor along with a little grapefruit and tangerine that breaks through the Saaz-like notes. Maybe this will spark a Cali-Pils crossover akin to the Belgian-Cali IPA."
"9/5/8/4/16/4.2"
"I expected big things out of Panzer Imperial Pilsner, as I do out of all Port/Lost Abbey beer. Unfortunately, this is one of Mr. Arthur's few misses. Since his hits are so numerous and so spectacular, it's hard to be too disappointed. Bottom line: for want of hops, the battle was lost."
"Big bitterness with spicy hops and thick chewy malts. Some sour fruit aspects but mainly just bready malts. Good amount of alcohol noticeable. Very chewy indeed with a long finish. A good beer with hard carbonation."
"I'm impressed with Panzer. I didn't quite know what to expect from it. It's unique and I find myself liking it quite a bit. Perhaps with all the imperializing that's going in the beer world, we'll see more beers styled ""Imperial Pilsners."" Definitely recommended."
"Poured a medium and hazy golden color with a small sized white head. Aromas of wheatiness, citrus rinds, spices, and grassy. Tastes of citrus, grassy, and some spices. Medium alcohol burn in the finish."
"Glad I tried it, but I'm probably not going to pick this one up again."
"D - Drinkability is okay bordering on good. The higher level of alcohol does take a toll on this category. Don't get me wrong, it's a good brew but a little more boozy than expected. The limit for me would have to be one bomber. The hop profile seems to be done very well to match the malt base. Another good brew from Port Brewing. Glad I got to try it."
"Drinkability- Like I said at the start I don't like those overly bitter Pilsners with all German hops. Luckily this only shows signs of for a few moments before a engulfing fruitiness takes the beer over. A good example of the style? Probably not. A good beer? Definitely! Big thanks again to Matt for his generosity!"
"Drinkability- Quite different that other noteable imperial pils such as Golden Shower or the Sam Adams version. Drinks well though. Not sure what kind of food I would pair this with though."
"D: Not a bad beer at all but not quite up to par with nearly all of Tomme's other beers. The feel and ABV(and alcohol presence) make the drinkability much lower than it should be, regardless if this is an 'imperial' or not."
"Very solid brew from Port Brewing...high octane, delicious stuff."
"Light golden colored brew with a head that fades into a collared ring around the liquid. Bold hop nose stinks of spruce, grapefruit, weeds and lemon rind, but it only smells of hops. Super bold hops in the taste, with delicious notes of pine, lemon, resin and fresh herb. Basically a pretty tasty, massively hopped and bitter lager. Intensely hopped, basically a Double IPA."
"D: ABV was a lot to read, but it is very mellow. Slow creeper, beware. very nice, best ESL I have had."
"Notes: This beer would appeal to folks who would a slight west coast malty DIPA character to their pils but as someone who thinks the Trumer, Prima and New Glarus Bohemian Pils are close to perfection, I find this a disappointing attempt at experimenting with the style."
"Surprisingly drinkable for the abv. Got better as it warmed. Worth a try. I liked this one more than I thought I would."
"Cool to see an official beer from Julian, now if Port only bottles the rest of his brews, it probably is not meant to be aged but I am going to try it with a bottle or two and see what happens, by the way this an imperial pilsner for those wondering what style it really is, anyways this stuff was great and I look forward to drinking more of it in the future, recommended"
"Props out to WeeHeavySD for another SD freshie!"
"Overall, I guess Strong Lager is a better fit, but they labeled the beer Imp Pilsner so based off of that it really is lacking for a Pils. And to boot there are a lot of off flavors here. Very disappointing."
"Overall a very interesting beer. Much hoppier than I expected. Certainly complex. A very well made beer, and one I would revisit. A fine line between this and a DIPA, but there is also certainly noticeable differences. A good hoppy treat. Recommended for all the hopheads out there, in fact, that is who i got it from! Thanks again Shane!"
"I finished the 22oz and wanted more. It was very drinkable once I gave into its unique flavors. Can I have another? Maybe in a few days."
"I like that this has the crisp character and herbal hop notes of typical Pilsner, yet it has that something else in the background with the fruity hop character that is not so typical. This is definitely interesting, more quaffable than beer of this strength should be yet (which is good for something with the name Pilsner on the label) with a certain heft and definite palate presence. Not as abrasive as double IPA; I was expecting this to be more harshly hoppy, but it is not and this is quite nice. This is actually really good and I am kicking myself all the more that I somehow missed out on Tovarish at GABF."
"It was almost sickly sweet in a way that you would get sucking on a hop-flavored honeycomb. One with a boasting booze content. Banging through the 22oz solo wasn't the easiest as the ABV was quite noticeable. I'd try it again, but would rather a smaller serving."
"Overall like this beer. I don't get the ""Imperial Pilsner"" label, though. Don't see pilsner characteristics coming through too much. But enjoyable, nonetheless"
"Amazingly easy to drink without the slightest hint of how strong it really is. I like it but at $7 a Bottle I can't afford it very often."
"D: I liked the first 2 fluid oz, but had to rapidly decelerate consumption after that. Excessive ABV plus hops was not very drinkable. This should be sold in 12 oz bottles, not bombers."
"**Not clear to me why this isn't in the Double/Imperial Pilsner category. My ratings wouldn't change, but instead of being the best beer in its class it would certainly be ""average"" for style.**"
"Overall I was very impressed with this. There is a good and a bad way to do this style, and this was definitely firmly in the good side of the spectrum. I would love to get a hold of this one again, and I am glad I have a few to go back to. Got to share this one with a few people for sure."
"Somehow, don't ask me, but somehow it all comes together to make it fairly easy to drink, and is fairly enjoyable. Gotta love beer."
"D - Except for the ABV, would not tire easily for me."
"Not too drinkable, way too sweet. I struggled with finishing the bomber."
"Medium body, oily, drinkable but I wouldn't drink too much, the 10 oz I got was enough."
"Special thanks to the Verdugo for having this one in stock!"
"this is pretty drinkable. smooth. a great ride. im not a huge pilsner fan so i might be a bit swayed on my rating. but i would love to try this off tap."
"Cheers Tomme & Julian"
"Thick and almost syrupy, low carbonation level but it fits well. Pretty easy to drink, just feels a tad syrupy near the end."
"D: An interesting new brew from Port, I don't really know what to think of it. I wasn't a huge fan of the hop character, but it has some interesting complexities and is well made, worth a pick up."
"The person below me reviewed saying they tasted alligator skin. People seem to be stretching in reviews these days. At the end of the day, it's a solid brew, very drinkable. And before I knew it, all gone."
"A very cool new style of beer for me. Id buy it again!"
"Note, very cool label, as are all of Port Brewings bottled beers."
"A fine beer, and an interesting DIPA alternative. A must-try for any port lover or hophead, but I think it lacks a bit in balance."
"Really solid brew. Strong lager is noted? Seemed more like an Ale. Great aroma, strong pils flavor and German'esk. Lots of minerals and a strong rustic and bitter finish. After this opened up it was more intense. Golden color with some amber, lots of sediment. These would benefit from 6-12 months of bottle age. Tried from Bomber."
