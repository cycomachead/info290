"The head on this beer is pretty remarkable, nice lacing. As the bottle describes high in alcohol but very approachable."

"O: I got this to better understand the style of IPL, which I was told this represents by the experts at Bruisin’ Ale’s in Asheville. I had Hitachino’s Nipponia a while back, and this is also considered an imperial pilsner as this one is. So, I am guessing IPLs and Imperial Pilsners are considered to be under the same category, not yet specified by some experts. Of the two, Nipponia is superior in my opinion. Tilted smile is good however, and worth a try."

"Bottled two years ago, but stored in a dark 68 degree area for 18 months or so it's been in my possession. I mention this because on one hand I think this beer might have turned a bit, but reading through the reviews, plenty of them mention an overly sweet taste, and mine is almost syrupy. Smells faintly of citrus, but also rusty water. Plenty of carbonation and lace left, though, so maybe this is just far more sweet and sticky than I prefer."
"O - Not a bad brew. Flavors seem more like a Belgian/pilsner. Normally I prefer a pilsner to be lighter and more dry. Definitely a beer worth trying, but not one i'm likely to come back to often. I do love the labeling though."

"A really great beer and style I haven't seen before. Even though it has a higher alcohol content the beer didn't have an alcohol flavor to it. It came in a 22 oz bottle and was a perfect size and ABV to share with 2 other people. Everyone enjoyed it. There is no hoppiness to the beer as would be expected with a pilsner, but my biggest pet peeve is when pilsners have an overwhelming amount of that strong pilsner malt, but this one did not at all. It was a great balance of a strong beer and a pilsner, if Imperial Pilsner wasn't written on the bottle I would have had a hard time putting this beer into a category."

"Overall: This imperial pilsner is a bit too much for me. Alcohol is a bit much along with the pilsner malts. The hops are nice and traditional."
""
""
""
" I'm not the biggest fan of this style usually, but this one is spot-on. Big in all the right ways while still leaving room for the classic aspects of a pilsner. I also appreciate any brewer that can create a well rounded IMP Pils. not an easy style, almost blasphemous in many regards, but it certainly is a style-bender and envelope pusher!"

"Pours a three finger off-white head that fades slowly leaving some lace. Crystal clear amber/copper color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Sweet grapefruit nose and flavor is grapefruit and caramel. Higher ABV is hidden. Worth trying. $8.49 for a caged and corked 750ml bottle from Hannaford's Concord, NH."
"In the end I'm disappointed, because almost everything on the label about the beer has been completely the opposite."
""
""
""

""
""
"Pours a murky orange with a foamy beige head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, grass, and slight alcohol aromas. Taste is much the same with sweet grain and grassy hop flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is tasty but there is an alcohol bite after each sip that slightly takes away from the drinkability in my opinion."
""
"Pours a golden copper color witha two plus finger fo white fizzy foam. On the nose its a bit sweet with a honeyed grassy profile that mixes with a bit of fruity yeast. On the palate it is more of the same. A touch sticky and the yeasty fruit flavors far outweigh the saaz hops and the bready pilsen malts."
"This finishes clashing. Sweetness with a moderate bitter. Thank goodness the carbonation was more than ample to keep the body of this beer from being heavy like a rock. The corn outdoes the spice and that is half the flavor of the pils as far as I am concerned. It's a little slick on the palate and overall just average."
""
""
""
"Pours medium amber, slightly dark, with huge white foam. Sticks everywhere. Light malt layered nose, hints sweet. Taste is straw like light but with a firm hop. Crisp and boozy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I really like this one, and heartily recommend!"
""
""
""
""
"Nice taste, not amazing, but there was something about the head that just felt great, not at all the gossamer insubstantiality of other lights, but rather, a curiously coherent, dense foam approaching - what? the chewiness of hops itself? - that was different, exciting, and enticing."
""
"O - Booze dominates this beer. Nose is just about nonexistent. small carmel, booze and a hint of barley. Uinta must tone down the booze. Carmel is nice. More Saaz. Crisp this up. This is straight sugary maltiness. Germans would be disgusted with this pilsner. I don't recommend this."
""
""
"O: Supremely well-balanced. A place for everything, and everything in its place. Great execution of this uncommon and difficult style."
""
"overall, its just a good flavorful version of a pilsner which is usually a really lack luster brew style save for the few that add some light, super dry hopping."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel: The heat in the presence is neat in a pilsener style but it's not all that distracting. Medium bodied but heavy for a pilsner. A little thick actually... carbonation feels... lazy. Different take on the style. Moderatley complex flavors. I'm sure this would rank a bit higher with fresher example."
""

"Pours a big frothy two plus finger head of eggshell white, mainly dense microfoam but some larger bubbles interspersed here and there, adequate plus retention, the lacing is actually much stronger than you’d expect and the residue all but fully coats the inside walls of the glass. The liquid is a dull rust water orange, light in hue and more pale yellow at the rims and glass bottom, the widely dispersed tiny bubbles are active as they rise. The nose is quite fruity with pear, yellow apple, fig and peach notes, some pepper and then salted pretzels, more straight up malt than associated scents like chocolate, not herbaceous but has a stiff spine, some cornmeal but the good kind. Full-bodied, almost heavy for its type with an unusual emphasis on sweet citrus, a blend of lemon, grapefruit and orange, very dominant. Leafier here, the hops come through in a drying sense, helps balance out that citrus as well as the apricot, pear, mango, cantaloupe fruit. At times close to honeyed. The carbonation stays on the fluffy side and spreads it like glue across the palate. Buttered biscuits and some sweet corn but nothing in the area of adjunct land. This is a definite “take” on the style and not a classic rendition, as such more likely to polarize. But, in the end, it’s fun taken on its own terms and just thrown back in that spirit."

"Would have this again as the weather warms. Interesting take on the style."
""
"Overall- This was a rather interesting brew. The aroma with its fermenting melon smells was slightly off putting, but not totally so (somewhat intriguing). Its taste was rather unique with a fascinating mixture of flavors and transitions. I kind of liked the odd flavor profile and while it is not something I would go frequently, it is worth a try and a time to time go to."
""
"Bottle: Poured a hazy dirty beige color pilsner with a rather large off-white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma consists of dry and floral hops with some sweet notes from a crystal malt base. Taste is a mix between some dry and floral hops profile with some quite sweet crystal malt base. Body is quite full with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Interesting though a touch too sweet to be an everyday beer."
""
""
"Tasted again...full bottle...3/23/2013...above and beyond all stated above, tasting much better with a touch of age...ratings gotta reflect the love..."

"This just showed up in Maine. I hope to find other beers from Uinta."
"O: A solid imperial pilsner with complexity and depth. Very easy to drink given the abv. Worth a try if you're into imperial pilsners or lagers"
""
"As far as this beer goes, there are a lot of grain tones to it. Quite boozy. It's just a boozy, alcoholic pilsener really. Nothing overly interesting about it, or interesting at all really. Just...a beer. And thus ends this whole Utah thing."
"O: Shouldn't have aged this long. I'd like to see what it tastes like fresh. I didn't mind this, but it wasn't great. 3.5"
"O: The taste was the big let down in this one. I found it to be too one dimensional. Some added complexity, particularly the sort that was found in the aroma, could really add some value to this beer. I haven't had many imperial pilsners yet, but despite the disappointing lack of complexity in the taste, this seems to be an adequate example of the style."
"Small pour (thank God) served in a snifter, hazy straw-yellow color with a medium-sized frothy white head that receded to a wispy layer. Lagery aroma, corn, toasted grains, grassy, floral hops. Similar taste, corn, toasted bread and grains, biscuity pils malts, floral hops with a metallic bitterness. It's true I'm not a big pilsner fan, and this was no champion among them. Light-medium body, sort of harsh going down, with some alcohol heat coming through. Definitely glad I only got a small pour."
""
""
""
"O - I know a lot of people dislike the idea of an imperial pilsener, but this is a good one. Not overly sweet like some others."
""
"4.0 D: Everything other than the taste is done really well, so this is getting a better score than it deserves. But, in any case, this is a tasty beer and I'm happy to be drinking it."
""
""
"O: OK, not a world-changer. Booziness not evident. Decent brew."
"Overall, not something you'd knock down alot of. Rich and boozy, this needs to be sipped. Worth trying."
"O: OK."
""
""
""
""
"O: Not bad on its own, but certainly not representative of the style and not as strong as I expected it to be"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - a pleasant version of a pilsner. I would never guessed it was 9% abv. But it was definitely too sweet for the style."
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a stemmed pilsner glass, the beer is a slighlty hazy, amber tinted yellow-gold coloring with a tall, frothy, foamy white head that starts around an inch and a half and slowly settles into a dense cap on the brew. Good lacing along the glass as you go. Aromas are blended well and subtle, with a toasted backbone and some buttery highlights, as well as a slightly sour character. Flavors are bold, with a boozey kick. Biscuity backbone with a butter sweet blending and some floral and citrus highlights. This beer is a mouthfull, but remains smooth and mid-bodied in mouth. The aftertaste is more of the toasted grain flavoring common of a Pilsner, leading to smooth, clean finish. Tasty beer."
""
""
""
"At Thirsty Monk....pours a yellowish with a fizzy head as is indicative of a Pils. Slightly darker than typical though. Taste is grassy from the Saaz hops up front, but there is a much richer malt backbone than is typical. Drinks like an IPA without the hop dominance. Nice brew."
"Pretty good take on the style here. I could go for more prominent hops, but the malt bill seems pretty choice for showcasing the old pilsner malts. I'd definitely like to drink it again."
"O: For a Double Pilsner it is pretty good. Not a big fan of the style but it is definitely better than others I have tried."
"An excellent and rather unique example of the style - while not a replacement for my favorite retired Imperial Pilsners (e.g. Grand Teton's Persephone; the Blvd/Orval collaboration), I'm glad I picked it up."
""
""
""
""
""
"Toasty malts,sweet yeast combine for a sweet and warm pilsner overall. A little earthy and citric ops here and there. Finish is particularly alcholic once this beer warms. A sipping pils."
"Overall pretty good and something I'd recommend for converting a BMC drinker to the craft side."
""
"Overall; a good beer in a style I don't drink all that often, the ABV is well hidden and it goes down smooth... I'd definitely drink this again, perhaps on a hot day behind the BBQ if I was looking to go a different route than an IPA..."
"O: I really like this beer. it is very drinkable which makes it dangerous at 9%. Definitely worth the 7 bucks and will most likely pick more up in the future"
""
""
"Mouthfeel is particularly disappointing. Even though it is ""imperial", I was hoping for the characteristic bubbles from this pilsner. Almost no carbonation. Medium light body. I won't buy this one again."
""
"O: Honestly I liked it, it was an easy drinker though a bit big...not too hot, pretty malty and I'm not the hugest fan of Saaz hops but Uinta did a good job here."
""
""
""
"O: a pretty nice take on the style, good depth, definitely drinks smooth enough and has a good character, would like to see the alcohol hidden a bit more but id pick it up again for sure"
"D. I could drink this all day. Delicious and relaxing to drink."
"Not a classic pilsner but very tasty and drinker friendly."
"D: This wasn't anything special, but it didn't have a bad scent or taste either. The body was great, and the alcohol was pretty well hidden too, so it was easy to drink. Enjoyable enough, but you're not missing out on much if you skip it."
"O- Good price for a good beer. $8 a 750 worth checking out if you like the style"
"There's something comforting about this stuff. It's so big and rich, without either an overdose of hops or a crazy flavoring. It's beery to the max and very straightforward. Cold night + hot bath + imperial pilsner = Tilted Smile."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Nice label and overall taste. Good summer beer. Will purchase again..."
""
""
""

"Do yourself (and your wallet) a favor and pass on this. If you're looking for a top shelf Uinta brew, grab their Impy Stout Labyrinth or their Imperial Pumpkin beer Oaked Jack."
"T: Semi-sweet up front with bready malts, and nice parsley/herbal hoppiness. Hints of pepper and alcohol. Nice balanced sweetness and bitterness throughout with nice dynamics and oscillations between them. Often nicely pleasantly bitter but at times its a bit sweet and syrupy, but overall its not a bad balance. Pleasant and reasonably complex classic noble hop character with a parsley, herbal character. Finish has a nice mix of alcohol and graininess, but is still crisply bitter. Has a pleasant, balanced, and complex herbal hop character which lingers nicely."
"Will not buy again especially when I can buy a classic German/Czech Pils or Victory pils for a quarter of the price"
"Good double pils, a style I am warming to. I prefer the Odells version now but I'll have to dig around for other options."
"O: All in all, this is a great example of a pilsner, very light bodied, mild flavors, and alcohol that is completely hidden. Give this a try if you like the style, even if the higher ABV brews don't appeal to you. The 9% ABV is hidden very well, you can't even notice it. Good beer."
"The beer had a thick body to it and seemed to be lacking in some carbonation. Overall, the beer was enjoyable, but I think that it could have been so much more. Certainly not the best representation of the style."
"O: I've loved all of the other Crooked Line series brew except for this one. ""Explore pairing with grilled meats and seafood."" That better be some damn good meat and seafood..."
"O - This has good drinkability. It goes down pretty easy and has good flavor. Overall, I thought this was a good beer. I am not the most familiar with the style, but I enjoyed this. I think it is worth a try. It gets a little too boozy as it gets warmer."
"Overall a pretty solid beer, very well balanced. Definitely a winner, and fun to try if you can find it reasonably fresh."
"O: Tasty Imperial Pilsner. 4"
"My notes to self by the end pretty much said they'd shot for big bold everything but kind of overdid a few things and fell short in a couple others. So my beer 300 I'd call a B+."
"O: Perhaps if I see it fresh, I'd try again, but otherwise....pass."
"O - I would love to pop another one that's closer to the bottling date. With this one having seven months on it already, I opened this bottle with no expectations and more curiosity than anything to see how it fared over the months. This particular bottle, I enjoy, but it's not a bottle I will sit and savor each sip, I'm going to pair it with dinner, just wanted to try it on it's own initially. Worth checking out...there's not alot of Imperial Pilsners out there which makes it unique."
"Overall: These doubled-up, imperial-fied pilsners can be a real chore to get through, like changing the rear tire of one's car along the side parallel to traffic. This one, well, it's about average among its brethren, not as cloyingly ganky as some, but it sure ain't that Boulevard Imperial Pilsner."
"overall: Hard to justify a higher overall than all the individual scores, but hey it is."
"A relatively simple beer for being so ""big."" Relatively earthy and grassy. A good pilsner with a real alcohol punch (in ABV only, no alcohol flavor present)."
"This beer looks like a sunset and tastes like butterscotch. I drank this beer after a very hectic weekend of attending my best friend's wedding, and the lace on the glass reminded me of what a bride's dress should look like - with pure classic lace. The head looked like a soft blanket. Overall, the beer was near perfect, except that the smell of yeast was definitely present. But this ice cold beer was the perfect ending to a weekend of chaos. I didn't want the glass to empty; this beer definitely brings me a tilted smile"
"I received this as a gift, but at $8-$10 retail in my area, I doubt I would ever drink this again, unless I saw it on draft during happy hour & had an understandable bartender who(if needed) would take it back. :/"
"Nice, sweet beer, but it's really lacking in the pilsner department. Needs to lean more on the non-sweet aspects to produce more balance. It stays in overall sweet territory and isn't unpleasant but not a hugely impressive effort on the imperial pilsner front."
"Not bad, but it should be better. It has a lot going for it, and I like how closely it resembles a standard pilsener—but in so doing, it actually just delineates how it is in fact less crisp and less drinkable than a regular pilsener can be."
"Bottled on 3/20/11"
"D- This beer is light and crisp and not really dry as I would like. There is a light flavor for such a big beer and some DMS sneaks up in the aroma as the beer opens up. I would mind a bit more hop character for such a high alcohol beer either."
"Not a bad beer, a lil pricey when its in the 9-10$ range, but saw it recently on sale for $7 which is tolerable."
"O: Sort of a letdown for me as I have come to enjoy a lot of this brewery's beers."
"This is a very good impy pilsner that I think would be even better super fresh. I like the hoppy character but could use a bit more of it. I don't think this one will hold up too well with age as the sweetness will get pretty overpowering. Solid right now though."
"Overall I really like the taste of the beer. It brings a whole new dimension to pilsner. It lacks the full on crisp and refreshing nature of standard pils, but brings a big beer presence to the style. Just wish there was more carbonation."
"First try from this Uinta Crooked Line series was nice. Looking forward to a fresh slice."
"Drinkability is excellent! This beer approaches the Imperial Pilsner concept from the malt end. Instead of trying to be a Nobel Hopped IPA this is a high test Pils that is closer to a barley wine. Not a bad beer at all and a good choice for anyone turned off the Imperial Pils concept by Hop Bombs."
"This is my first Imperial Pilsner, and I must say that I am very impressed. Pours a thicker head than expected, with a good amount of attenuation in the the body. The nose is fruity/bready/yeasty. Taste sweet, with a bit of fruity/bready qualities. I also really appreciate the slight alcohol character that comes in the after taste. I sense a creaminess that is a wonderful surprise for a pilsner. Overall, a great introduction to a new class of beers for me (imperial pilsner). Gonna have to brew me one of these :)"
"Drink- So far I haven't been impressed with the big bottles from Uinta. I wont come back to this and the Detour. This was thick and malty and not really what I was hoping for."
"Poured from bomber at a beer festival into a sampler glass. From notes: Pours clear golden-orange with a thick white head that slowly recedes to thin, even lace and a lace collar that is a little thicker. The nose is very fruity with zesty tangerine and somewhat tropical with mango along with traditional pilsner malt, spicy noble hops, and a hint of dill. The flavor is more straightforward pilsner with the malt and spicy noble hops taking the forefront, and the fruit still present, but very much underlying. The body is medium with a somewhat oily texture, lively carbonation, and a long nutty pilsner malt and spicy hops finish."
"Increasingly, I just don't think the pilsner style lends itself very well to ""imperialization."" At least or me, the sweetness and obvious high alcohol wear on me, making me long for good 5% German or Czech pils. Oh well..."
"I think that this is a good one. Big beer with not giant 'off' qualities. Plus, pilsners are a relatively mild beer and this one packs quite a wallop while remaining pretty drinkable. Am having it with sushi and it is a fine compliment."
"D: Good drinkability. Refreshing and crisp. Alcohol is hidden very well."
"Imperial euro-lager maybe. Was expecting some wonderful continental hops but not to be. Better examples of the style out there."
"I could drink this all night or until I pass out, ABV is well concealed. This would work better for me as say, a Mai Bock. Would love to get a fresher bottle, to see if the hops are more prevalent, but one I'll buy again to be sure"
"This one is quite enjoyable despite the domineering alcohol heat. The flavors are wonderful and well-balanced. If the alcohol had been better masked I would have been wholly satisfied and put this up there with my favorite American lager, the aforementioned DFH My Antonia. Uinta has done a nice job presenting a flavorful lager with a high ABV. I need to try more of this particular offshoot brewery project."
"This is a style I've always enjoyed and Tilted Smile is even different within its style category, almost crossing over into the world of Belgian saisons/pale ales. I find it hard to believe it's got that much alcohol, and that it's an imperial anything, and I suppose I was mildly disappointed that it didn't perform with the ""huzzah!"" of other, better double pilsners. But in the end, the taste was a compelling, nearly seductive thing of subtlety and nuance that I can appreciate. I'll award Tilted Smile a high score for drinkability, because it drinks like a low-ABV pils or some such, despite being 9% Alc by Vol (nice shirt, dude)."
"Pours a golden-straw color with a thin white head and not much in the way of lacing or retention. The nose is slightly fruity with a bit of grain and grass plus some slightly-sweet malt on the backend. The taste is mostly generic malt without the complexity of the nose. Light to medium body with good carbonation. Drinks pretty well and is probably my favorite of the Crooked Line Series."
"D - This beer is very drinkable. At 9% you'd think you would taste a lot of booze but in this case you do not. I think this beer is as drinkable as standard alcohol pilsners and will get you drunk much faster, if that's what you're going for."
"D: Pretty darn good"
"I'll pass on this one, a mish mash of some good but also disappointing faults."
"Pours transparent yellow with foamy white head that sticks around for the entirety of the drink. Smells of sugar, floral notes, vague hop leaves. Tastes of leaf, sugar notes, hop bitterness towards the finish but still with underlying sugar residue. Medium bodied with a crisp mouthfeel. The booze is unfortunately brought on by the excessive sugar that is placed in this drink. The crispness is downplayed by the sweetness and no pilsner should have that."
"D // Not very drinkable. I was trying to see if any of my companions that night would have some, and I'm struggling through twenty-two ounces. I guess I can imagine worse."
"D- Can definitely put a couple of these down. I would have liked a little more attenuation and a little more hop, but otherwise a solid IP."
"Really digging this style. Solid Effort."
"It's lovely to see the Uinta Crooked Line Series here in Illinois. This one pours a clear pale golden straw topped by over a finger of white froth. The nose comprises honeydew, wheat, corn, grass, hay, and light caramel. The taste is very similar, with the addition of light minty pine and even lighter mentholated caramel. It all mixes together better than the words make it sound. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a crisp finish. Overall, a very solid impy pils, not a guzzler but definitely a tasty brew."
"This beer pours a light golden color with a nice frothy white head that laces on the glass. The smell is distinctly of that sour pilsner aroma, bold sweetness and a hint of pepper spice. The flavor is really quite pilsnery with the malts amped up for this brew. There is a decent mouthfeel to it and it's rather enjoyable, but not a beer that I would bring to a tasting. This is really a beer that is meant to be enjoyed with pizza and sports of some sort. But alas it came with cork and cage and shall never meet it's potential due to that very fact."
"Drinkability: compared to others in the style, this one just didn't cut it for me with a slightly unbalanced profile. Very slow sipping, and a bomber bottle is too much for one session."
"Taste is very similar to aroma, sweet pilsner malt flavors with dextrose for body, and some saaz hops for flavor. Its an earthy beer, not overly hopped, or overly sweet. Nice and mellow like a pilsner should be. Not a ton going on in this beer, but that is the point of an imperial pilsner. Crisp and clean taste with a higher abv. This is what I had expected and it delivered. A good imperial pilsner."
"Bah, I am quite disappointed that this was so disappointing; I wasn't expecting much, but I was expecting a carbonated beer and this doesn't even deliver on that. Well that is $8 dollars down the drain, but there might actually be some potential here."
"D: Not a winner by any stretch, falls far short of the promise of Detour DIPA. Very disappointing."
"Drinks: very sweet and flavorful for a pilsner. Not one that I'll seek out again, but interesting to try nonetheless."
"Which leads us to drinkability. That falls where the flavor does - it's good but it's not great. There's nothing holding you back from wanting to drink more, but there's nothing there motivating you to want to drink more. That said, you might as well just have a decent Pils, or a decent helles bock."
"Mouthfeel is light with a crisp amount of carbonation."
"Poured into a chalice a very nice hazy golden yellow color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger foamy white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, very slight yeast note, fruity, very nice hop note. The taste is malty, hoppy, some citrus, fruity. Medium body, ABV hidden very well, definitely not as hot as other Impy Pils. Very Drinkable, for the price you cannot beat it, well job done Uinta."
"D: I was impressed by how refreshing it is, but it was way too malt-forward for an imperial pilsner. It felt more like an imperial helles than anything else. They really need to kick up the hops to take this to the next level."
"Refreshing despite the ABV, but this is a pretty average Imperial Pilsner."
"D: I don't know why the reviews are so low for this. It is spot on to style. One of the better examples I have had in fact. Dangerously drinkable to boot. Watch out for their crooked series."
"A nice Father's Day gift from my wife. Pours a nice crisp golden color, with little effervescent bubbles streaming up from the bottom of the glass. Not a whole lot going on with the aromas here, a little bit of sweet malt and just a hint of the expected hops. Flavor follows along pretty well, somewhat crisp, but mostly sweet and alcoholic."
"It's a big beer but only from the alcohol content. The malt/hop content is completely dominated by it."
