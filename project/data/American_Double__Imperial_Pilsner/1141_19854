3.67,-7.1,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Big thanks goes out to oldp0rt for this one as an extra in a recent trade! Served from bottle into a Grolsch pilsner. Poured a golden yellow-orange with a half finger slightly off-white head that remained throughout. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, fruit, grain, spice, and alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, floral, grain, wheat, fruit, and alcohol. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. I was really surprised at how much alcohol I found in this one. There is just something about imperial pilsners that don’t really carry enough flavor and complexity to carry the alcohol over for me. It may just be me, but that is how I feel about the style as a whole. The aroma and mouthfeel on this one were actually quite nice though if I’m fair. Just wish the booziness was toned back just a touch. Still worth trying if you get the opportunity.","thagr81us","Oct 08, 2012"

3.73,-5.6,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Certainly worth trying at any rate. Maybe a stronger dose of the noble hops or something to combat the fruitiness would have made this beer closer in line to a pilsner, which would have been really something. However, erring on the side of a strong IPA is not a bad thing either!","JohnnyBarman","Sep 07, 2012"
3.45,-12.7,4,4,3,3.5,3.5,"O: This is a decent beer but nothing that makes it stand out. I did enjoy it but I wouldn't recommend it either.","flipper2gv","May 04, 2012"
4.08,3.3,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Overall – Interesting 'fruit' flavours typical of this brewery, blended into a nice hoppy pilsner/double that therefore verges on a type of IPA. Very easy drinking for the ABV of 8.9%, which could mean trouble if you wanted to keep drinking this beer, which you most likely will. Good thing it comes in packs of 4! Recommended to drink in a proper pilsner glass which really brought out more flavours than when tried in a modest tulip.","4ster","Apr 26, 2012"

3.5,-11.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Bottle: Poured a clear dark golden color ale with a medium size foamy head with good retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of sweet malt with light dry hops notes is interesting. Taste is more dominated by sweet malt notes then Nobel dry hops then I was expecting. Body is fuller then expected with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Interesting take of the style but I would personally have preferred more Noble hops notes.","Phyl21ca","Oct 03, 2011"
4.08,3.3,4.5,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Overall – I really enjoyed this one.. it's got some shades of a DIPA. The taste is bold and in your face and the flavours are fantastic. I'll be buying more of this one for sure.","spinrsx","Sep 16, 2011"
4.3,8.9,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"O- It's the first time I ever tasted an imperial pilsner and I must say I'm really impressed. As it has been said before, it feels like a Double IPA/Pilsner cross. Looking forward to trying it on tap. Very enjoyable, definitely worth tasting. Wishing it wasn't only brewed in September...","ctgui","Feb 11, 2011"

3.78,-4.3,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"I don't think this would really be sessionable but I would certainly grab a pint if I was in the mood for a pilsner-style beer. I'm not sure if I would have necessarily guessed they were going for a pilsner here but can see the influence.","eat","0"
4,1.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Dark golden, near bronze with a nice head of slightly off-coloured white foam that lasts and leaves decent lacing as well. Aromas are all about spicy saaz hops, a bit of fusel alcohol, and some nice bready biscuity malts. Taste follows suit with spicy hops, fiery booze, and nice malting. Finish is not too dry and is almost a bit slick, with no real booze flavor, burn, or aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied>full and drinkability is quite good. Another winner from DDC, i'm not suprised, at all...","francisweizen","Jun 03, 2005"
4.32,9.4,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Deep golden colour, hazy, with a thin lace of off-white head. Strong but mellow aroma, with a nice balance of malt (almost caramel in character) and hops. It's a little spicy with a bit of pine as well. Also a bit vinous with some alcohol apparent. Soft yet strong bitterness seems to be due to the use of a whole lot of low alpha acid hops. Also a bit spicy and malty sweet, which provides a nice balance. Alcohol flavour and warmth appear at the midpoint and carry through to the finish. Sweetness appears at the finish as well, along with peppery phenols and spicy hops. Light to moderate carbonation with a medium body, and it still has a CO2 crispness and slighty effervescent texture. Very interesting, tasty beer and certainly worth a try.","DrJay","Sep 19, 2004"
3.55,-10.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Received a bottle, bottled 9/11/11 and it was just a strong lager. Drinker but uninteresting with little hop flavour. So I have averaged my rating.","Sammy","Sep 17, 2004"
3.38,-14.4,4,3.5,3,4,3.5,"Clear shining yellow. Low carbonation manages an honest foamy and sticky white head. Field aroma, straw, hay spicy hops... Comes out peachy and orangey with grapefruity hops. Refreshing on the tongue. Mild alcohol warming. Slight grain touch. Less sharp and fresh than Rogues but spicier. Theyre obviously of similar origins. Creamy body, smooth carbonation. Gentle bitterness, floral. Id much rather have a light and crisp helles and am definitely not a fan of imperialised blond lager, but what fool wouldnt welcome a rarity.","Rastacouere","Sep 13, 2004"

4.35,10.1,4.5,4.5,4,4,5,"I'm usually not a big fan of pilseners but seeing as this is Dieu du Ciel I couldn't resist a pint. It was very smooth and malty, with just enough hops to dry out into a nice clean finish. The mouthfeel was definately different from most pils I've ever tried, this one had character, and didn't taste watery at all. And surprisingly, it went down wickedly well, even at 7.5% ABV, you couldn't feel it at all. Superb.","Goldorak","0"
