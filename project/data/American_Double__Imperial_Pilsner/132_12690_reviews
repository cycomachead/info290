"I traveled with this from NJ to Dom Rep because there's only so much Presidente one can take. My brother-in-law and I split a bottle in pilsner glasses.  Drinkable and refreshing but has noticeable substance and body--I suppose therein lies its ""imperial"" quality. Crisp pilsner flavor with no sense of the higher alcohol content. (9.0)"

"O: strong pilsner just like the name implies. Bitter. Great spin on a pilsner. Strong."

"overall: Not a big Rogue fan but this is nice, well crafted brew."
""
""
"I found a place that still has a few bottles of it for sale so I'll need to pick a few up and re-review it but I'm excited to have more of it."
""
"O- This is definitely the most bitter lager I have ever had and right up there with the most bitter beers I have ever had. Really nice crisp pilsner mouthfeel with a little more body and good flavor."

"Found this brew, a relatively rare style in these parts, on tap at National Beer Hall in Calgary on 10th Ave. Missed out on the funky bottle but oh well. Arrived in a pint glass (?), a cloudy gold amber color that is of course is on the light end of the Lovabond scale but still manages to look thick and imposing. Smells of concentrated sweet grains, a pungent fruity note like grape juice, another sweet note almost like brown sugar, and aggressive grassy green hops. All of these elements are reflected in the taste ... Nothing tastes quite like an imperial pils. This one is at once rich and sweet, chalky and woody, almost carbolic, and features a heady mix of green and spicy hop flavors along with some equally spicy aromatic alcohol. The thick and chewy body and buttery mouthfeel make things even more satiating. I get heavy sweet dough, dried fruits (currants, sultana raisins), candy apple, and an oaky dryness that does work to cut the sweet grains to some extent. The hops provide some additional woody tannic bitterness and funky gooseberry notes and pine in the finish. A big beer with considerable decoction malt and hop power. A pint is a lot to get through."

"This is a medium bodied brew with a moderate amount of carbonation. The imperialized pilsner concept is a little strange especially in this example. The bitterness doesnt seem imperialized but the alcohol and sweetness sure is. That sweetness distracts a little and ruins the overall snap, crispness and ease of drinkability I look for in a good pils. Worth trying but I probably would not revisit this again."

"750 ml ceramic bottle into lager glass, no bottle dating. Pours fairly hazy pale golden amber color with a nice 2 finger fluffy white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Dense spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a ton of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big apple, pear, bread, cracker, honey, floral, grass, pepper, pine, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance of malt, yeast ester, and hop notes; with good strength. Taste of pear, apple, bread, cracker, pepper, floral, grass, pine, honey, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruits, bread, floral, grass, pepper, pine, honey, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance of hop, malt, and yeast flavors; with a moderate malt backbone and no cloying flavors after the finish. High carbonation and medium bodied; with a very crisp, smooth, and moderately prickly mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice imperial Pilsner style. All around nice balance of malt, hop, and yeast flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"I thought they were done with the morimoto brews, so when I saw this I had to pick it up, ignoring the 20 dollar price tag, because morimoto is just a boss. the boss of bosses. anyways, this pilsner pours bright honey colored yellow, with a colossal white head that doesn't relax much at all. the nose is a little sweet, a little floral, and hopped with some noble variety that really gives a nod to tradition in the genre pushing bomb. the flavor is well balanced and surprisingly interesting for a pils, which I usually find so uneventful. floral hop profile, grassy malt bill, and some excellent yeast that is light, but ties the whole thing together and tames the alcohol, which is expertly hidden. would never know this was almost 9% abv. feel is nice too, fuller bodied for the style, and well carbonated. sort of a richness to this that cool. it trumps out the refreshing qualities usually found in a pilsner, but it also adds an element of class and satisfaction I don't usually come away with from a pils. overall an excellent brew, expensive, but damn good."

"Overall, a big tasty pils, I am not sure I love this one all to much, it has a lot of flavor but nothing compared to ales of similar strength. I would recommend it to anyone who is on the fence about it, and I am sure I will try it again."
"If you enjoy a good imperial pilsner, or other Rogues, or are feeling like treating yourself, I recommend this one."

"Let me preface this review by saying that I don't normally enjoy Pilsners, mostly because I dislike the Czech yeast finish. That being said, this beer was amazing! It poured a hazy golden straw colour from a very cool ceramic pot-stopper bottle. The first flavour that struck me was honey, thick mellow warming honey. It had much less carbonation than normal pilsners, which I welcomed because it complemented the flavour better this way. The typical Czech yeast finish was totally buried in honey, with some grass and a pinch of hops. If it wasn't $18 a bottle I would definitely buy this very regularly."

"Ceramic bottle. A dark golden beer with a bubbly whipped cream like off-white head. The aroma is sweet malty with a strong hop presence giving it notes of grass, herbs, and citrus. The flavor is sweet malty at first, but very soon first the hops hits the tongue with notes of grass, grapefruit, hay and herbs, and then the alcohol comes a long with a power, that makes its presence known, then the alcohol resides a bit, to leave a quite acidic grapefruity note towards the quite bitter end. Now this is a complex interpretation of a pilsner."

"O: I’m not a huge pilsner fan – but this beer kicks ass. Very tasty and enough alcohol to make it interesting."
""
""
"O - don't believe i've ever had an imperial pilsner, definitely enjoying this, much sweeter and maltier than a classic pilsner making it interesting and tasty"
"O - Pretty much what I expected. When the bottle says imperial pilsner, you think pilsner kicked up a notch. I'm usually not a fan of Rogue but this is a good one and could lead others from the BMC category."
""
""
""
""
"O - I have only had one other imperial pilsner that i can recall, it was a (local) Holy City Trippin Brick and it was amazing. After having my first rogue xs (imperial IPA) and being totally blown away i was pretty pumped for this one.. although this is definitely a decent brew, there is no way I will ever pay 16.99 for this one again, the bottle alone is awesome and worth at least $7 or $8 I would think but this beer just wasnt quite special enough for me to spend that kind of money on 2 brews. Again, the review is based on quality not taking price into consideration. I'm giving it a 3.5 because taste is most important, and it was sadly my least favorite part of this one."
""
"Overall not even a taste of alcohol heat, but it's a one trick pony beer, but boy what a trick it is. It gets strangely a bit more interesting as it warms up which is not how I would want this style. But regardless this is one impressive pilsner and it's quite shocking they pulled this off."

"Overall, this is an excellent beer. The flavor profile is complex and bold, as one would expect from an imperial. The aroma and mouthfeel accompany the flavor very well to create an enjoyable beer. The ceramic bottle with the resealable top add a nice touch, although entirely unnecessary."
"This is a good beer. It was a different experience from any other beer I have had."

"O: I tend to dislike strong lagers, but this one was a pleasant surprise. Easily the best lager I've tried from Rogue."
"Overall, havent had too many nice pilsners but this is certainly one of them."
"Overall: Pretty much love all of the Rogue beers that come in the ceramic bottles and this one is no different."
"Nice beer, very over priced. Yellowish with a huge fluffy white head. Smell is solid, but for $16.99 better blow me away if I am going to purchase twice. Taste is better and more bitter then smell. Mouthfeel is very solid. Overall nice beer in my opinion, but step back and improve the price. I would have gotten into more detail, but my kids prevented me from writing as I was drinking."
"The brew pours a slightly hazy golden straw hue, and is capped with a good bit of soapy froth. Lemongrass and bright citrus hop notes are noted in the nose and upon the palate, and sit upon a light, pale grainy malt base. The whole thing is very smooth, with a nice mouthfeel, fairly refreshing and sans indication of the high ABV. Overall, fairly delicious, and better than most Rogue brews."
"This is an interesting beer. I appreciate what they've done here but for me it's a touch to syrupy and sweet."
"This beer poured out as a pretty clear looking golden yellow color. The head was white and fluffy at first, as it settled the lacing was light and didn't do too much. The smell of the beer wasn't overly grassy which I was happy about. The aromas were a little grainy and hoppy. The taste was better than expected, the flavors of some sweeter malts were upfront that faded into a subtle bitterness at the end. The mouthfeel was pretty slick, not too heavy or overly carbonated. Overall this beer wasn't too bad, best of the Morimoto series that I've had for sure."
"the"
"Overall I was pretty surprised with what a tasty brew this was, I guess what else can you expect from such a great brewery."
"Wow. I was surprised by this beer. I'm not really a pilsner guy, but this one was highly recommended. From he tap, iot pours golden with a dry hopped nose. Very thin mouthfeel. Starts like a pilsner, finishes like a malty IPA, with a hoppy finish that is uncharacteristic of a pilsner but is necessary because of the ABV. I really enjoyed this brew."
"Opinion: This is a pretty good beer. It is a bit aggressive on the hops where I really don't think that it needs to be and this pushes it out of the Pilsner feel for me overall. It is more like an Imperial IPA with German Ingredients. I will certainly finish the whole thing, but it will be a while before I decide I need to try this again."
"D: Big malty and bitter hoppy beer; made it balance. ABV a little daunting. It was pricey too."
"D - Morimoto is an amazing Imperial Pils. Loved it! This is a huge Pils hop bomb that still retains its crispness and drinkability, which is what I really love about the pilsner style. This one just adds a ton of hops, which makes it all the more tasty. Plus this wasn't as alcoholic as some other Imperial Pils I've had in the past. No alcohol sting, but plenty of hop sting!"
"That said, I don't think this beer is worth the money that you pay for it, I've felt this before that Rogue makes very solid brews for way too much money."
"I really like this beer, pretty easy to put a whole 750 back and my roommate and I burned through the growler I had pretty quickly. The price of the bottle may turn some away, but if you can get it fresh (on tap/growler) I'd give it a shot."
"D: Average to good"
"I am not impressed to say the least. Take away the fact that an Imperial Pilsner is an oxymoron, this is just bad in any regard. Sorry, but a big miss, and something that I will avoid if I ever see it again."
"Tasty and refreshing. Great imperial pils. Hoppy and bitter."
"OK, this beer is really oddly super bitter. Its kind of disturbing. Its kind of sweet medium bodied and really really bitter. Its almost fruity in the middle but the bitterness lingers. Its a big bottle and I made it through the whole thing but I doubt i'll drink it again."
"Highly drinkable, I'd definitley order another."
"Aroma is of fruity malt and apple cider although without any ester taste that could be expected from an 8.8% brew. This pilsner is labeled as 74IBU but the hop bitterness is so well integrated that there is no way that this number could be guessed. This is probably due to the obviously large malt presence. These two components are so large in this brew that any change could cause the flavor profile to go awry, but the balance between malt and hops is perfect. This super-big but suspiciously well-balanced beer, plus it's hefty 8.8%ABV, makes this is highly drinkable beer. This is an incredibly expensive beer, so it's not for everyday, but it is one that deserves it's place at special occasions. Recommended."
"Taste: Thick mouthfeel but light malts - overtones of straw and caramel. Slightly bitter orange oil as well which sweetens up in the middle which has notes of tree bark (in a pleasant way), light white rice, caramel, and more straw. White grape skin come in toward the finish. Finish is yeasty, a little boozy and herbal. Lingers fairly long and has a touch of dry, bitter herbs."
"Double Pilsners? The more of them I drink the less I like them. I think it's a style that is very difficult to do well. Part of the beauty of a pilsner for me is that a beer can be light and refreshing but still complex and flavorful. This beer is heavy and cloying, and doesn't resemble light or refreshing in any way. The malt is sticky sweet and drowns out any hope of balance. The alcohol flavor is pretty unwelcome."
"Not sure I would buy again only because expensive Pilsner's is not my typical expenditure. If I was forced to buy Pilsners, this would prolly end up at the top of my list."
"Overall a top notch Imperial Pilsner... I liked this a lot and despite the steep price, I will probably grab one of these from time to time.. Very nice..."
"D - This was a decent imperial pilsner...it could have used a better nose but I did like the balance of malt and hops"
"D- drinkable, but not more than a standard German pils. If you just keep pounding away like you would on one of them, the alcohol could really sneak up on you. Good beer"
"Never had an Imperial Pils, wasn't sure really what to expect...having said that it was kind of like what I expected. It's kind of like an IPA or DIPA brewed with pilsner ingredients, isn't it? Anyhoo, firstly one of the crappiest heads I've seen in a while - some big ass bubbles in that fella. Some upfront fruity, piney, nutty even hop action on the nose. I tell ya, try this blind with some IPAs and I'd be impressed if many people could pick this as being an Imp Pils as opposed to an IPA. The piney hop flavours on the palate just reinforce this. Pretty low carbonation too for something of the pilsner family. Still, an enjoyable beer but like most Rogue and other USA beers here, barely worth the price."
"(D)- I am not sure how old this is, but I am glad I did not pay the full price for this one. It just does not work for me. There is some citrus & hop bitterness, but it just feel & tastes thin. I am not a fan, but it does somewhat resemble the style here & there."
"Drinkability is very much so. Overall, it's a very well brewed beer. Fabulous, actually."
"Served in an Imp. Pint glass. Straw yellow a lil less than golden color with a frothy head. Strong scents of cut grass and lemon. Flavor profile has hints of orange hops and forward straw malts. Slick almost oil feel in the mouth. Very drinkable, alcohol is well hidden."
"Slainte! No, for real Slainte!"
"Nice beer, probably awesome with sushi and spicy food. I'm thinking mexican or thai."
"Good flavor overall, and a unique presence, but not worth the pricetag. Wondering if I just had a bottle that was on the shelf too long."
"Should have gotten it when it was still fresh. Regardless, it's mellowed and is still quite drinkable at this stage. Alcohol has faded away a bit as well."
"Poured in pils glass for a sparkling ghost with great carbonation and a good head that sticks around on top of a strong pils malt smell with a touch of sweetness and breadiness as well as some citric hop. Crisp, easy to drink, pils malt very strong, no weak veggie taste in this beer as it has a bready/woodiness to it and also some sugary sweetness and fruit sweetness like grape and some citric hops and finishes slightly dry. A happening and easy to drink pils that goes down great."
"D: A little more hoppy than I would expect for a Pilsner, being that it is imperial...why not? Subtleties of a typical Pilsner are appreciable but big bold malt body is intact."
" Worth looking for and trying."
"Notes: Very pleased with this Rogue beer that I was able to enjoy on tap at Ballantines, a nice BA place."
"Overall this beer was quite refreshing and seemed to a relative Imperial Pilsner novice to represent the style quite well. Recommended."
"As are most beers of this type, the Rogue Morimoto is not a sessional quaff, but a big bodied brew that demands respect, patience and, as always, the proper glassware. Rogue does have its detractors; however, I am not one."
"Imperial for sure. Pilsner, ok. Worth the experience: you bet."
"The mouthfeel is smooth, sweet and chewy. Good body on this pilsner. Some warming alcohol at times. I don't drink too many pilsners, but I find this one quite drinkable and will definitely enjoy finishing the bottle."
"D: Like a lot of people, I think it's bullshit that Rogue charges you more for the packaging than for the beer. Still, this was interesting enough with flavors I'm not used to from pilsners."
"overall a great brew from rogue...they are hit or miss with me...their cost are outrageous....i dont mind paying for the beer but im not into paying for the container it comes in....glad this was a gift"
"I liked it and would love to see it on tap in my neighborhood. Well done to the chef and brewer!"
"I am so impressed with this bottle so impressed its taken me a few months to crack it and ive been looking forward to it as i do love this style,it pours a semi cloudy honey colour with decent carbonation that leaves a nice creamy one finger head with nice lacing,it has a nice straight up aroma of fruity,pine driven hops with a bubblegum background very pleasant,the mouthfeel starts off quite heavy and finishes with a medium feel with really nice tastes of piney,piney,grape bubblegum hops and the alcohol is very well hidden for a beer of this ABV,a very nice beer in my eyes and would drink it all night if only it didnt cost $42(australian) for one bottle but to be honest ill still prob buy another one to put away in my collection,once again Rogue or should i say morimoto has proven what a beer should be for the style it is representing."
"RBSG09 on tap at the Rogue Publick House in SF. Lightly hazy straw color with a frothy white head. Noble hop aroma, very spicy, pils malt. Lots of pils malt flavor, dough, fresh bread, noble hops reduced to an afterthought. Dry finish with a light astringency."
"A so-so amped up version of a Czech PIls, the alcohol obviously not too well integrated, but drinkable, I suppose, once one's palate succumbs, like when you're sipping whiskey or the like. Morimoto Imperial Pilsner is the second highly-rated big Rogue product to come off like a booze bomb to me. While it was somewhat easy to procure another bomber of their Yellow Snow IPA for another try, I don't know that I want to drop another 22 bucks for another go around at this one."
"Last of the available Imperial series from Rouge that I haven't tried. Pours a hazy, golden hue with some foam that sticks around. Aroma is very floral with hops and malt. A strong, sweet, yeast smell quite nose tingling. The aroma alone lets you know this is a step up from the rest. The sip starts off pretty mellow compared to the aroma but then it hits the back of your tongue. Strong malts (a hint of roasted?) and then the hops kick in. Just enough citrus to really enjoy it. It seems a bit more mellow than the Sam Adams version but this one has more of a mouth feel I believe. This one of those styles you don't see very often. Very well done but not too complex. Very good, but a bit pricey."
"Drinkability: A surprisingly competent beer. A Double/Imperial Pilsner at 8.8% is nothing to sneeze at, but honestly could be a lot higher. This one manages to be intense and flavorful without coming across as too boozey, but be careful - it is, ever so slightly. Re: the flavors and intensity, they're nice, well-balanced, and well-crafted. Though it's not my favorite DIP, I'd recommend this one to anyone who's a fan of the style."
"Drinkability: The heavy nature of these Imperialized, Double-fied pilsners totally negate the simple, refreshing qualities of a good pils. Starts engaging, but, for me, it soon grew tiresome and turned into the beer-equivalent of helping someone move."
"overall, i felt like it was over priced. tasted good, but lasting hops after taste wasn't as enjoyable"
"d: highly drinkable, very nice mix all around; different from other imperial pilsners but one i want to have again"
"Enjoyed 1 of these during the 1st quarter of the Super Bowl ... Let me tell you - it didn't suck! Pours out of the ceramic bottle with a clean white head and golden, crisp body. A little subdued on the front of the palate ... Then it kicks in! Toasted malt flavor & underlying bite followed seamlessly by a crisp, dryness that zips through your mouth as you swallow ... leaving you savoring the finish and wondering when you'll decide to partake again... Dude, THIS is a good thing! Cheers!"
"D: One of the best Rogue beers I've had, I'm certainly impressed with it. Strong flavours, not overdone or overhopped. A classic flavour of this style, though the style is anything but classic."
"The beer overall, while expensive, is well worth it. The citrus fruits come through beautifully, and the smooth, creamy mouthfeel leaves you refreshed and wanting more more more!"
"The apple flavor dominates some. But based on price, can get a Sam's 4 pack for cheaper and both are very good and I may even say the Sam's impy is a bit of a step up in hop flavor."
"Poured into a 10 oz. goblet. Bright yellow in color with white suds surrounding the air exposed beer. Big hit of lemons is the main attraction. Very clean, in the light, with some moderate alcohol present in the nostrils. Gulp. Hops! With a combination of the pilsner bitterness makes for a sweet blend that surprises the palate. Very refreshing given the ABV. A nice treat of a beer indeed, recommended to the all Imperial fans around the globe."
"Is it worth the price tag? Certainly not."
"At $15.99 for 25.36 oz. or 750ml, it is not a beer I could make a habit of drinking daily."
"D - I could do too much with this high ABV."
"Success! I finally found this one in San Diego at Servall. And for only $15! Pours like a glass of regular grapefruit juice, murky orange-yellow with a frothy white head. Delicious aroma of saaz hops, cornbread, sugar, grass, and cereal. Smooth, sweet taste with more hops and a decadent Bavarian malt back. A hint of crystal malt. Velvet, smooth mouthfeel. An incredible all-around beer."
"Since it's a pilsner, you can't tell the alcohol presence at all. Very drinkable."
"D - A good beer indeed. Would I buy it again? Probably not. $32AUS is worth it to try once but not for repeat purchase."
"Pours a golden color body, somewhat cloudy and bubbly. Huge rocky frothy white head, lasting a while. Hoppy bitter aroma, sweetness, and some floral-ness. Some grain present too. Soft mouthfeel a little watery. Has a bitter aftertaste. Grainy taste, maybe wheat or something. Bitter. Letting this one warm up a bit has minimal affect. Thirst quenching. Nice bitter taste."
"Not sure I'm supposed to include the bottle in appearance but it is SO cool it has to go somewhere. Nice copper apricot color with active head that leaves nice lacing and I've NEVER seen a pilsner get my attention like this one. Smells of rose hips, caramel, and pepper. I could learn to like pilsners. Taste. Yes. yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Caramel, crisp hops, a tad metallic but crisp finish. I'm not a big hophead but this one is a hoppy beer for the rest of us. The mouthfeel is a touch sticky, a little smooth, and all good. Drinkability is good but the finish is a touch too hoppy for a lot of these. Still, one of the best pilsners I've had & one of the best hoppy beers."
"An impressive beer, but frankly I prefer my pilsners to have all the flavor without the high alcohol."
"D- For 8.8%ABV this is dangerously drinkable"
"This beer is a bit on the pricey side, but nothing to complain about... good beer commands a higher price, and you get to keep the nice ceramic bottle with re-sealing cap!!!"
"D: Drinkable, the price of this bottle is absolutely ridiculous however. Rogue is a great brewery but I am little frustrated with the fact that all of their beers are at least a few dollars more than others."
"I guess I am just a sucker to have paid $14.99 for the stupid ceramic bottle full of just average beer. Rogue really has got us beer geeks where they want us. This poured a copper color with a nice fat white head and good lacing. Nose however is just strong citrus and floral hops. Not much else. Mouthfeel is crisp an clean, but not remarkable. Flavor shows a lot of malts and is decently balanced with the hops. Alcohol shows in the bitter finish. Smells and tastes more like an DIPA than a pilsner. The best part of this was the bottle."
"Poured from a nifty white 26 oz ceramic bottle into a pilsner glass. Looks light, moderately bubbly, and has a uneven off white head that coalesces into bigger bubbles that disappear and fades into fingers of fizz. Has a light sweet and flowery scent with a kind of caramel undertone, but not very hoppy. The hoppy bite comes out in the taste - it cuts but also has something that reminds me of lavender - then it goes heavy and sweet, with more hop, and finally a pleasantly bitter finish that lingers with just a hint of sweetness. Feels light and effervescent in the mouth, but kind of coats - it's not as crisp as I'd expect a pilsner to be. It's very good, but not exceptionally good, and pretty expensive."
"26 oz ceramic flip top bottle. I have been anxiously awaiting this one. Golden colored topped with a thick foamy off-white head and lots of lacing on the glass. Aroma is quite grassy and malty with only a touch of hops and perhaps some hay notes as well. The flavor starts with some rich french pilsner malts then turns fruity, hoppy and sour. Sour aftertaste that sits on the tongue. More of a malt presence than I expected. Better as it warms. Definitely a good beer but something was just a tad off. Way too expensive but I guess that's partly because of the bottle."
" Crazy drinkable for 8.8%, if I didn't already know what the ABV was I never would've guessed 8%. We polished the bottle off pretty fast. Thanks Ryan!!"
"D- drinkable and well brewed for style, not something i'll miss but if you like the style its worth it"
"D: Tasty, goes down dangerously easily, not too filling, strong kick, good representation of style, this is a good stronger beer that's worth drinking for a long time until the ABV catches up to you."
"Excellent brew, but I have to put it in context of the price. Brilliantly hoppy, refreshing bitterness just dances around the mouth. But for $16... there's a bit more on the market just as good for significantly less. Maybe if Rogue released this in one of their regular glass bottles rather than the fancy ceramic one I'd consider it. I found it difficult to finish in one sitting, though, so perhaps the resealable bottle wasn't such a bad thing. That said, I was trying it on its own, without food. With a good meal in front of me I'm sure the whole thing would have disappeared. Funny thing is, having eaten Morimoto's food a number of times, I don't see it pairing with his cuisine. This is not a subtle beer. Would probably go great with sweeter, more forcefully flavored Asian fare - Vietnamese or Chinese."
"Ordered a bomber of this and was very impressed overall. Generally prefer more flavor than a pilsner, but this is an excellent example of the style. Appearance is just a tad lighter than a typical pale ale, and definitely darker than a regular pilsner. About what I expected. Head doesn't show lacing like a heavier beer, but impressive again given the style. Smell is excellent -- alcohol is noticeable but not overbearing. Tastes very good and is very drinkable, especially given 9% abv. I could pretty easily drink 2 of the bombers or probably 3 pours if on draft. Deceptively high abv. Overall a very good beer, and for someone who can't get enough hops, a nice change of pace."
"Eric"
"Rogue deserves serious credit for this one. It would be nice to see this in cans or 12 oz bottles."
"I had a more fresh one on tap, and the flavouring was about the same, just more bitterness at the end."
"D - One of the best Imperial pilsners I have had the pleasure of tasting. Big thanks to my Mom for this gift for my 35th. I remember having a bottle of this 5 years ago and the quality of this Imperial Pils has not diminished for me. To enjoy the 750ml bottle at Morimoto's Philadelphia location was so enjoyable and the way the beer complimented the Omakase was nice considering the contrast of the citrus and soy flavors w/ cilantro in the yellowtail sashimia and baby snapper dishes. I thoroughly enjoyed the 8.8% lager and the booziness was not apparent at all until we walked out into the near 90 degree street temperature and felt the moisture leave my body."
"D: Hilariously drinkable, this one's going down very easy!"
"Very nice beer. Not a great value, though. At 15 bucks, I doubt I'll buy another one. They should make this one of their permanent bomber lineups, though. I'd happily pay 5 for it."
"The head withered, but lacing maintained its integrity down to the last drop, which I was sorry to see. Would strongly reccomend. Haven't repuchased yet, a little pricy."
"Second pour into a pilsner glass proved much more enjoyable. Bad smell was replaced by a sweeter, almost ale like yeast aroma, sweeter fruits, pale ale malts, crisp and clean. Convinced the first glass wasn't clean."
"Don't know what else to say.. I like it more than Envy.. and definitely more than SA Impy Pilsner.. I probably won't buy it again because of the price unless I am trying to do a ""really"" big pilsner."
"Notes: Excellent stuff, and unlike many beers labeled as an imperial pilsener, this actually tastes like a pils (I'm talking to you, Sam Adams)."
"This is an incredible Imperial Pilsner from Rogue. I could drink these all night."
"Well done and am glad to have waited."
"It's interesting to see so many fusion styles on the shelves these days; I bought this beer mainly to see whether it could live up to the title of ""imperial pilsner."" All in all, I'm certainly impressed and feel like the style designation is apt. That said, the aroma was a bit too fruity and hoppy. As for bitterness and character, I do look for a certain spicy hop character in a pilsner, but the aftertaste borders on excessive. Other than that, the body and mouthfeel are quite pilsneresque, for an 8.8% brew. The appeareance is clear, but do I detect a slight hint of chillhaze? There is a bit of a sweet malt quality somewhere in the middle of a taste, but much less than I expected from something this strong. It must have taken quite a bit of care in the fermentation of such a beverage. Do take note: it's easy to think your drinking a light lager here... take your time."
"This is a great Imperial Pilsner. Rogue and Morimoto really know their stuff. I'm just sorry I don't have some sushi, teriyaki or udon to go with it."
"This was a strange pour, the first half of the bottle was much brighter than the second half and had more head. The second half poured a hazy gold with no head (but both halves tasted basically the same). It smelled of lemony yeast and some malt. It tasted very strongly of citrus hops with a dominate grapefruit flavor. It was slightly thick with minimal carbonation, and had a long bitter aftertaste. Overall it was a decent but unbalanced beer."
"Near- full-bodied. Initial harshness eases at it progresses, but it still is a slow sipper. Interesting, but there are examples of style I would prefer...Too pricey to have as any kond of regular or rotating - don't know if it was worth the price, though the bottle is cool!"
"Moderate/medium mouthfeel, soft yet substantial. Pretty good for a Double Pils, but still not that drinkable."
"Excellent drinkability; this one went down nice and smooth, and I could have easily polished off a second bottle."
"Definitely recommended..."
"Drinkability is very good. This is a style which is difficult to get right, and this beer is spot on. Let's be honest here, this is a real Imperial Pilsner. Sam Adam Hallertau, in contrast, is an imperial IPA made with H. Mittelfrueh hops. So, if the scoring was BCJP certified, Morimoto would win hands down. But because I'm a hophead IIPA addict, I score Hallertau higher at the end of the day. I highly recommend Morimoto Imperial Pils."
"My folks bought me back a bottle of the Morimoto Imperial Pilsner from a recent trip they took. I'm not much of a ""Pils-man", but I found this beer to be very enjoyable and drinkable. I love the packaging that Rogue chose for its XS line. I didn't have my regulation tasting snifter on hand over at my folk's place, so I used a standard straight sided water glass. The beer poured a deep golden color and was crystal clear. The head was very thick and remains until the beer was entirely consumed. The smell was musky, but had a relatively strong hop aroma. The beer had a good amount of hoppy bitterness, but also smooth malty tones in the background. I can't say that this beer will switch me of to pilsners from ales, but I am definitely going to recommend this beer to all my buddies."
"Cheers"
"This is the first Imperial Pilsner I have had that comes close to resembling a pilsner, even better than DF's Golden Era. Most have too much hoppiness, so that you can barely tell what it is. This one did it right."
"Overall, this is a crisp and clean yet flavorful beer. Easy to drink this and not notice the high abv. until the bottle has been emptied. One of my favorite Rogue brews."
"Poured a nice gold color with a nice, but thin head. The smell of both hops and malt were very noticeable even before drinking. This beer is strong, but very well balanced. The chewy malt character is balanced well with a big dose of hop goodness. For such a strong beer, the alcohol flavor is balanced out well too. I could drink a few of these, but the price may prevent me from doing so."
"Overall a good beer and I hope the problem of not being full is a one time deal. I do not think it was ullage as the beer still tasted good but then what do I know. Im pod!"
"D- It is easy to drink but just pretty bland tasting besides the bitterness from hops afterward. I would think this would be a great beer if it was sold in 6-packs for $6-8. I will probably not buy this again but I wouldn't mind a bottle for free at all."
"Beer poured a golden color with a nice white head. Nose is sweet, of pilsner malts and floral hops. Taste is a blast of those pilsner malts balanced nicely by a generous amount of hops. Mouthfeel is full bodied and is decently carbonated which provides a smooth and lively treat on the palate. Drinkability is very good. The alcohol is very well masked in the taste and has a way of sneaking up on one! This is a very nice representation of the style. If you have the cash to splurge this is definitely one to try!"
"Drinks a little slow, due to the complexity of this beast, hides the ABV well. Let this warm up a bit more than usual. At first I hated this, but as the complexity grew on me, I figured out what the buzz is about. Still disappointing visually. I'd love to find this on draft. Not worth what I shelled out, but not bad"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- With all of the commotion of malts, hops, and dastardly strength, the texture seems appropriate and unoffensive. It's slick and nicely active, which keeps the intensity in check. Just invite a guest or two to the table for this walloping."
"Tastes of a large amount of German hops, earthy and floral. A touch of malt and alcohol come through as it I make my way towards the halfway point of the bottle. Has a very bitter but clean finish. Very refreshing and drinkable for such a complex beer. A great take on a style (Pilsner) that is over looked and underrated (IMO)"
"This beer rocks, no question about it. I've been hunting good pilsners all summer and finally I find this and I'm blown away. It didn't even taste that big, it just tasted good. The hops standout, but don't dominate or overpower the beer. They're crisp, a little grassy, with citrus and herbs. The malt is pale with a touch of biscuit and that distinct slightly funky pilsner malt taste. It's perfectly balanced and wonderfully drinkable. I can imagine the only improvement being to add a little more malt character. But damn, this is good beer."
"This beer was a wonderful surprise to me. A really great beer, one I will look for whenever possible."
"The mouthfeel is described as hedonistic on the bottle and I concur. So silky smooth and chewy. At the same time your palate is refreshed after each sip. I really enjoy this beer. Highly recommended."
"The feel is thick and creamy. It's a tad bubbly. Very dry. Leaves a malty film which isn't entirely welcome. It's not a bad beer. It's pretty got-damn strong for a pils, that's for sure. One and that's about all I can do."
"D: No noticeable alcohol, stronger body than expected and an excellent flavor profile make for a quite drinkable brew. I had no idea what to expect, as names like ""imperial pilsner"" and such always seem like marketing to me. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that this was actually a pretty well-rounded beer that offered enough flavor without being over the top. Well done. Now if only we could get a full line of original Iron Chef beers, as opposed to that uber-lame Iron Chef USA crap."
"Just because it says ""Imperial"" doesn;t mean it will age. I bought this about four years ago at Rogue Portland and saved it. Doh! It was a mistake. It was a good beer but by the time I got around to drinking it,,,it was way past its time. Fresh is best with this one."
"Taste is yeasty, fruity, and dry, it is sharp, the hops and their floral flavours comes in but are well balanced with the heavy maltyness of this beer."
"Wow, had this on tap at Barleys, and I feel in love with this one. Poured a nice golden yellow with a average white head that faded rather quickly. The aroma was awesome, lots of hints of bright citrus and fresh lemon and grass, really a bright, aroma. The flavors was just outstanding. So light and yet complex at the same time. The bright citrus flavors were huge with alot of lemon and orange coming through. This was really absolutly a suberb beer, I would honestly drink this all day if I could, and hope to find some bottles to bring home shortly!"
"If the word ""sacrosanct"" pops into your head at any point during which you're thinking of the word ""pilsner", don't bother here. If you like pushing envelopes, then check this one out. With all pilsner malt, exclusively Sterling hops (sharing similar earthy-sweet flavors as the popular pilsner varietal Saaz), and ""Czech Pilsner Yeast", Rogue has bottled something completely different from others using the same ingredients - in prodigious quantities. Lots of fun, very interesting, and complex in the way that it embodies so many characteristics of other styles without deviating from pilsner ingredients."
"Highly recommended, even if just once is all you can ever get around to."
"Very easy to drink, and little sign of the alcohol content throughout the whole bottle. Still, this is not something I would drink regularly, even if I COULD afford it. Decent. Worth $20 for a bottle? Definitely not."
"Even with almost double the normal amount of alcohol typical of a pils, this is still refreshing. There is a slight warm bite to this brew, but not overbearing."
"Very impressive for its ability to hide its high alcohol, but lacking in complexity, particularly for a >$10 beer."
"cellaring. Unlike their Barleywine, I think it would be worth the investment."
"D: A very tasty and drinkable beer, a bit high on the ABV but nothing overbearing, the place where this beer suffers the most is the hefty pricetag you'll pay to pick one of these up, it's not too bad for a first tasting but a continual pick up? I don't know, we'll see."
"Not a bad beer, but not something I see myself buying again. I don't see a good value on the dollar for this one. My first of the style, it may be that I'm just not a fan of this type."
"On draft at Rogue Public House in Portland, in their XS goblet, the Imperial Pilsner looks just like a macro pils, clear pale gold, but with no real head and only slight white lace. The aroma was very slight, straw and citrus. The taste is mainly pilsner malts, with a bit of citrus/floral hops. No noble hop spiceness that I look for. The finish was moderately bitter, but there was this weird aftertaste that I just really didn't care for, nor could I place it, kind of a grain/hay/earth thing. Pretty mild taste overall though, other then that aftertaste, ugh. Did they use some type of unusual adjunct? The alcohol, however, was inperceptable, which was this beer's biggest accomplishment. The mouthfeel was also really quite nice, a moderate body that is not at all cloying like the Imperials can often be. I would have like to seen more carbonation, as on draft at least, there basically was none. The drinkablity was low due to that aftertaste that I couldn't get used to, I was being generous with a 2.5, because I certainly didn't want another one. But the smoothness of the ABV helped."
"Drinkability: In a bar, I would probably not order another. The price really makes this beer prohibitive, while the bottle is quite cool I would probably not pay 14.99 again for it."
"It's hard to get a handle on the beer because there are few examples with which to compare it. It is considerable less hoppy than SA Imp. Pils but also considerably more balanced and perhaps drinkable than SAIP. This doesn't pack what some might consider to be an ""imperial"" punch but it is a crisp, refreshing, and hoppy take on the pilsner."
"Very nice in flavour and fairly drinkable if not for the large bottle size. Look and scent just don't match it."
"Appearance is a golden/copper slightly clouded with a large foamy white head, and it leaves even thick bands of chunky lacing with each sip. Aroma has deep rich alcohol and pilsner malts bursts of grassy herbal hops and mild floral citrus fruits with a mineral character overall a bit perfumey kicks ass with biscuit malts kinda doughy as well. Flavor really great the bottle I initially sampled lacked the freshness that this draft version expressed the assertive hops bring a great mix of bitterness and hop bite...mineral tones with grassy citrus hops are killer second best Imperial Pils I have tasted defitnitely doesn't dethrone Sam Adams version but close. Mouthfeel is medium to fuller bodied especially compard to the standard pils but really has some smooth even moderate natural carbonation. Drinkability is heavenly great dose of hops and really gives this style some credibility I'm a fan...I could have downed a few more effortlessly especially during happy hora at Mad Mex Robinson."
"From this amazing earthenware Kanji-inscripted swing-top bottle pours an intense golden-yellow hazy brew, obviously lots of sediment, will try for a more careful pour next time. Whitish head that makes up for its lack of volume with grandiose lacing. Aroma of citrusy hops and grapfruit, and (surprisely) dark chocolate. Starts grapefruity with some sweetness, then dark chocolate, and a long piney citrus hop finish. Mouthfeel was buttery full yet still having some clean crispness of a pilsner, with no high ABV noticed until the warming of the throat reminds. This is wonderfully drinkable, were it not for its disheartening price. Great for sharing, yet hard not keep for oneself."
"The mouth is complex and well balanced, the hops providing a nice contrast to the fruit and grain. Low carbonation makes it very velvety. Very drinkable. Overall, a very tasty, well rounded pils with a personality of its own."
"A superb souped-up pilsner. Worthy of multiple tries. Yeah, right. Delicious."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden, almost amber, thick white head forms, lots of lace, and the head refuses to leave. Smell is nice, sweet toffee, very malty, grapefruit and apricot dominate, no alcohol I could discern, very nice. Taste is sweet up from, nice residual sugar, really coats the mouth, grapefruit and apricot hop blast, nice bitterness, very balanced in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with low carbonation, very smooth and drinkable, really coats. Excellent, second best Imperial Pilsner to Sam Adams Harvest, worth it to try this one. Thanks again Dave!"
"Semi hazy yellowish gold with a thinnish head. Not the most attractive. Smell is also lacking a touch. Solid dry hopping but not really anything else. Flavors are smooth and go nicely but nothing really jumps out at me. Some fruity base characteristics with pine notes at the top. They balance well in the end but the malts seem to sweet and hops too bitter. Finish is acidic. A good beer but not worth the price and it didn't wow me whatsoever."
"D - Give me two 750's of this for a baseball game with some brats and I will trade sexual favours without hesitation."
"Pours a gorgeous slightly cloudy golden color with an awesome solid head that hangs on modestly through the glass. Hops and citrus greets the nose. Taste is oh so grand with the bite of the hops and an impression of grapefruit on the finish. I find it very drinkable and quite concealing of the alcohol content. Hope to never pay this much for a case again, but for now; it's all mine."
"This beer pours a hazy yellow brown with a light foamy head that settles into a light lace that has good retention. The smell is fruity and mellow with a hint of a hops quality. The taste is citrus with a blend of hops and malts. The beer feels smooth and full with a creamy texture. It finishes with a hops spice and a slight tingle. In all this beer is great. You get a nice tasting beer that drinks well and a fun bottle for those that collect beer merchandise."
"Notes: Really an oddball brew but it works, kinda. Hops and the fruits were a nice combo but the mouthfeel was long lasting and meal'ish along with the mundane sweet malts it was just ok for me. Price per quality factor is not favoring a quick re-purchase anytime soon."
"1pt 10oz white ceramic bottle, with no freshness date, that I purchased a tad over a year ago and has been in the back of my fridge since. Pours a deep gold with just a hint of amber. One finger head with OK longevity and nice lace. Not much aroma but I am catching some pilsner malt mixed with citrus and honey. No real hop aromas to speak of. Taste has sweet malts up front mixed with fair amount of citrus and honey. OK hop flavor but a decent hop bitterness in the finish. Alcohol is well hidden. Nicely balanced until the hop bitterness in the finish. Crisp and fairly lite considering the ABV. A full flavored pilsner and another quality beer from Rogue."
"Notes: This one is quite tasty nicely hoppy crisp a very well crafted brew out of Rogue once again. An excellent summer beer lace lines the galss from start to finish. Cheers"
"Recently I have had many imperial porters and I was looking forward to Rogue's offering, but unfortunately this one doesn't rank very high with the rest of the lot. The smell is faint, but when teased out it is like a weak tripel, with a bit of citrus, spices, and sugar/honey. The taste is good, but not really what you would expect. It seems to me like Rogue took their fantastic uber-pilsner and tried to dry hop it, but there was not much forethought on the execution. Hops peek through about a third of the way through the beer, but nothing really develops. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both good, simply because its not that big of a beer."
"Big ceramic bottle. Pale yellow and slightly hazy. Large white head. Hops are first impression, citrus and floral. Malt came next, a supporting role, earthy and bread-like. Flavor was similar, with the hops driving. Now I am getting floral and grassy, maybe a hint of grapefruit. Some sweetness, bread/yeast in character, shows up in the middle. Finish is a bit acidic. Light in body, medium carbonation and quite drying. Overall, an excellent beer. I will enjoy more of these despite the price."
"Pours a gorgeous dirty gold -- not just an analagous gold, it looks like actual, primitively shaped gold. The nose hints at light sweetness, with big white pepper and spicy hops on a bed of hay. Great, appetizing, enticing nose. On the palate, this beer is quite sweet, due to both malts and, it would seem to me, present alcohol. The mid palate is full of doughy malts, while the hops kick in at the end for a sweet and spicy finish with relatively little bitterness for a beer this big. The quality of the mouthfeel is diminished somewhat by the raw, present alcohol, and the body is thin and stretched like a rubber band. Overall, an interesting beer that suffers from too much present alcohol and too much sweetness. Not terribly drinkable, but interesting."
"First of all, this is one of the most beautiful bottles that I have ever seen. Not that is the only reason to buy this beer but it is a plus. Poured a nice yellow color with a beautiful white head. Tasted very sweet with a little too much carbonation. I just wish i could have sampled this with a little sushi or some top of the line chinese food. Was definetly a great pilsner."
"Bottle courtesy of Daalamar: Poured a light orangey color pilsner with a big white bubbly head with good retention. Aroma of hops is quite intense and reminiscent of an IPA. Taste is also dominated by big floral hops with medium bitterness and some sweet malt. A bit more balance between malt and hops would have been preferable IMHO. Body is above average for a pilsner and alcohol doesnt show. Overall, this is a rewarding experience but not necessarily what I was expecting."
" It pours a pale, clear gold and forms a frothy white head that subsides rapidly but leaves intricate lace down the side of the pilsener glass. The aroma is surprisingly bold-- flowery hops with a touch of spice. The taste is bold -- fresh malt, yeast, a tinge herb, andof course spicy hops. If it wasn't so darn expensive I could polish of a few of these bottles no problem."
"Mouthfeel- Dry yet effervesant, almost champange-y."
"As far as I'm concerned, a benchmark Imperial Pils. Best one I've ever had. Seek it out on tap, because it is pricey at $13/750ml in the bottle."
"Like other BAs, I had to try this because of the cool bottle, and also because I really liked DFH Golden Shower. This was a pretty good beer. It was orange, with a medium head. It had a floral aroma, and the alcohol was perceptible. A fruity, hoppy taste, again a noticeable alcohol taste. Smooth, and drinkable, but not my favorite."
"Overall: A very good double pils, probably not the best pilsner Ive had, but as a double, quite good. Recommended."
"I thought this was very drinkable. It was enjoyed by all."
"Tall head. Rich golden wheat color, but more cloudy than I'd expect. Has a nice nose to it. Very floral with a hop smell that is like cascade hops mixed with some of that saaz smell and yet distinct. The malts come from behind with some grassy sweetness. A very sweet beer. Not a lot in the way of bitterness. The malts are by far the major player. Sweet and fruity. First Impilsner I've had that the malt takes center stage, but honestly I've only had two. It doesn't really have that pilsner funk that I like in some of the czech pilsners...at most a hint. Mouthfeel is very full bodied. Alcohol is deceptive since I don't really recognize it at all. An okay beer, but not worth the price I regularly see it for."
"A very enjoyable beer. The appearance is a slightly hazy yellow gold beer with plenty of carbonation. Very big hit of hops in the nose and some malt although it is difficult to find much of anything past the hops. I'm not really sure which hop variety is dominating the aroma but it seems spicy and German which is kinda refreshing compared to all the American hops I've been exposed to recently. The taste is pretty smooth and a little fruity with a mega bitter backbone. The burn of the hops lingers on my tongue for a good while. Loads of body. Surprisingly drinkable for something so potent."
"Thanks Fugazme!"
"D - Very drinkable. Rogue has a nice little Imperial Pilsner here, different taste than a SA Harvest Pilsner."
"This beer poured a slightly hazey light orange. The smell was citrusy. The taste was pretty smooth. The taste of this beer flirted with an IPA. There was not a powerfull hop presence but it did have that feel. The mouthfeel was smooth. The higher alcohol was well hidden. Not a beer you could drink many of but a beer I could certainly drink again."
"Pours a clear, bright golden yellow with a small but tight white head that fades gradually and leaves behind some lacing. Smell is sharp floral hops with a piney tone, and a bit more sweetness than one would expect from a DIPA, which is nicely in keeping with this style. Taste is hoppy to be sure, but less so than I confess I was hoping for, and it fades into a fairly strong buttery taste with some fruitiness in the mix as well. Mouthfeel is thicker then I'd expected, with less bite, so pretty darn good all in all. Drinkability is solid, no trace of the big ABV, making this a dangerous beer, coming as it does in the big ceramic swing top. Thumbs up, but I'd like a bit more hoppiness to really take it to the next level."
"Im liking this one. Very appealing to all of the senses."
"Great balance. Great beer."
"This offering seems to defy the classic characteristics of a pilsner. A very complex beer. Nice to try every now and then, but probably wouldn't make it a must-have after this one."
"Poured from a white ceramic bottle. Very hazy straw blonde color with big thick head and sticky lacing (a bit hefe looking). Aroma is sweet and malty with citrus and some earthy hop aroma. Mouthfeel is fuller than expected with a creamy body. Taste is huge malty sweetness and strong but smooth earthy but sweet hop bitterness. Finish is pretty smooth for something this strong. Alchohol is not noticed in spite of almost 9% ABV. Overall a strong but malty pilsner with nice hop balance. Goes down easy for being as strong as it is. Great flavor and helps redifine the pilsner style. However for the price of over $10 a bottle I am not sure it is really that great. If this were a regular $3.99/22 oz I would be more impressed. I give it a lower drinkability due to the price. . ."
"Desperately wanted to try this one after my recent pilsner-kick. Poured a clean, clear gold, with a medium white head. Major floral notes, yeasty, and mild citrus. Taste is all Pilsner, but slightly sweeter and hoppier than I care for. I typically like a very dry pilsner, but maybe I'm accustomed to a German or Czech? This IS an American Double Pilsner, so I should keep an open mind. It was strong, plenty of alcohol, floral hops, mild sweet fruits, yeast. Well-balanced carbonation, sweetness and dryness make for a good mouthfeel, and if you sip this guy, you can polish off a few before you realize how housed you are. Not what I look for in a PIlsner, but nice take on one of my favorite styles."
"Body is a hair below large, with a soft, creamy texture and slick, almost syruppy mouthfeel. No trace of the 8.5%, definately quaffable, but sipping is reccomended to enjoy all the not so subtle nuances."
"D - Its not something that could be a session beer. I wondering if it would be better if it was colder. I'll have to review it again sometime."
"Pours a three-fingered white head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Cloudy pale amber color. Hoppy/floral nose. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Starts sweet but hops take over in finish. Label description is actually close: ""intense hop bitterness supported by a big malty backbone."" Slight bitter aftertaste. Better than Sam Adams imperial pilsner. $13.99 for a 26oz (or 750ml??) bottle from Capital Convenience Concord, NH."
"Overall a very tasty brew and something to pop on a special occasion. Also one of the coolest bottles on the shelves and I must admit that it caught my eye right away and thats really what swayed me to buy it despite it's high price tag."
"I have had less than a dozen Pils that Ive actually paid attention to (Im relatively new to the beer advocacy thing), but this is far and away the best Pilsner Ive had. It is a good thing this is a special release, because I could see getting addicted to this stuff."
"I like this beer, not just because I payed....oh $14.99? Sounds outrageous even for such a quality brew. But it is cleary worth the money at least once. Great looking beer with nice creamy white head- breaks down sofly, like foam from a cappuncino. Bitter and more bitter, so if you like hops, this is for you. Not fruity or sweet, just dry and very mellow. This is a beer you have to pay attention to- you don't passively drink this pilsner- it's serious business."
"I dig the bottle and all, but seriously unless you like the hand painted fake Japanese stuff enough to use it as a vase this beer is overpriced."
"Cheers!"
"The beer pours a frothy white head on an orange-golden body that is quite cloudy. The head retains and laces well. There is a floral and sweet citrus smell about the hops in the beer. The taste does not reveal much more than the smell does. This is a very thick beer that is complemented well by the carbonation. This is a good beer that could use a bit more sweetness and less floral."
"Drinkability: I did really enjoy this beer and I recommend it, but I can't say I'll ever buy it again. At most places it's $16 a bomber (I found it for $12), and I'm afraid it's just not worth that. Awesome bottle, though."
"If you add up what I just wrote, you might think that I don't favour this brew all that much but guess what? I liked it enough to say to myself, I'm buying this one again."
"Poured smooth with a nice head of very dense somewhat spongy foam slightly cloudy/murky with lots of tight bubbles. Laced the glass nicely. Smooth and creamy mouth feel but very hoppy, good flavor, slightly sweet (I like slightly sweet beers), tastes of malt and some yeast flavors, good finish with a little alcholol bite. Reminds me of some ales I have tried. Overall quite nice I would buy again."
"Drinkability - a good tasting beer but a bit costly and not on my short list of favorite styles."
"Drinkability: Even at 8% I find this to be a very drinkable beer, though I think the hops might be a little bit overwhelming for non-hop-heads. Though I don't how often I will come back to this beer at $12 bucks a pop"
"Drinkability: The strong flavors of this beer are very interesting, but impact the drinkability somewhat; I really like it but one glass is aplenty for me"
"Cool 750 ml bottle pours a hazy bright yellow color with a decent creamy white head that leaves a sticky lacing in my glass. Flowery and citrusy aromas, sweet bread, honey and lemon flavors. Medium to full bodied with a slick, smooth mouthfeel, finishes with a lingering bitterness, alcohol very well hidden."
"Indeed. Try to find some for under $12...and enjoy."
"This brew pours a cloudy wit color. The head is large, billowy and bright white. The aroma is of nobles hops, grassy and floral, but with some citrus notes too. The taste begins with grassy and herbal flavor, finishes with citrus, then reverts back to a grassy aftertaste. The mouthfeel is slightly fuller than medium bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this is a very good beer."
"This pours a rich golden, orange, honey color with a huge foamy head.Aroma wise,this is a very floral smelling beer.The earthy floral smell along with the malt,hops,and even a little orange make this an outstanding smelling beer.The taste is very hoppy and you can really make out the alcohol.This may be this beers only slight flaw.It is very good and rich tasting,but the alcohol takes away some of the flavor.But don't get me wrong,this is an excellant tasting beer.The m/f is very full and dominates your taste buds.The only thing that I don't like is the price and ceramic bottle.I could do with just a regular bottle and give me a couple!!"
"I'd love this at a kinder price tag... even if it means the absence of the spiffy ceramic bottle."
"Mouthfeel is maybe stout-ish, smooth, very creamy. Not too thick. Very sneaky for 8.8%. A very tasty brew that's easy to drink- not sure if it's worth the price... wish it was cheaper... but I wouldn't turn it down if it was offered."
"The taste starts with a jolt of citrus hops, then sweetens slightly with clean malt, hint of caramel, tingly carbonation and honey. The finish is tart and almost dry with lingering hops bite and alcohol warmth that makes you want another. Medium body, very tasty and drinkable. Head and shoulders above the typical mass market Pilsners. Very classy ceramic bottle and label art."
"and made the sesame noodles that Rachel Ray recommends to go with the tuna. The five spice powder, anise and all, went very well with the beer. I chose this dish because the bros. recommend pan-asian cuisine be paired with this style."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, smooth and creamy. It still manages to be refreshing even with the heavier feel. The 750 will disappear all too fast, however drinkability is hindered by the large price tag on this brew. I purchased this at Jungle Jim's in OH for $12.99. Still, for the experience and the beautiful bottle...I'd say that is one that everyone should check out at least once. Another tasty brew for Rogue for sure."
"Not sure if it is the fancy ceramic bottle or the Morimoto name that justifies the $12 price tag on this here brew, but either way its overpriced. Dark and lightly clouded straw color with a thick off-white head and stringy lacing. Tangy hops and banana aroma. Light-bodied and faintly metallic with floral hops, spice and a bit of fruit in the flavor. The finish is dry and hoppy with a bitter aftertaste. Above average but no way will I pay the hefty price tag to try this again."
"Really enjoyable. Great bottle, but probably too pricey in the long run."
"More sipable than drinkable tasty but a beer for special times not everyday."
"Drank this one for the first time in about 6 months. Tried at a local Japanese recipe--most impressive grasshopper. Looks terrifically straw-golden and clear. Assertively carbonated. Pours a tighter white head than most pils. Shows impressive legging. Smells terrific. Of sweet honey like malts, herbs, and fresh citrus fruits. More estery than expected, but I like what I smell. Tastes sweet of honey, powdered sugar, and tangerines. Sweet controlled alcohol sneaks into the firm round body, but never dominates until the end finish. Nice movarian type barley flavors and subtle but American hops round out the sweetness. Alcohol cuts the sugar in the finish. Bittering scoots into the aftertaste without becoming abrupt. Whew....I could keep on going. This may be the best lager that I ever drank."
"Drinkability- A bit too much alcohol taste and scent for me. Only my second double pils, so it may not be my cup of tea. Liked it enough though to possibly get it again in the future."
"Deliciously smooth and full of flavor...not to mention, it packs a punch at 8.8% abv. Biscuity sweetness, a boisterous alcohol presenece, and nearly perfect on the palate... A little too expensive to drink on any sort of regular basis, but quite a treasure if you find it somewhere."
"Nice full mouthfeel that's closer to a BW or a strong IPA than a pilsener, but it doesn't go too far. As drinkable as an 8.8 abv could be. Highly recommended."
"A very enjoyable beer, too bad it costs so much!"
"Clear amber color with moderate white head that quickly fell to thin lacing. Smell is of extreme hoppiness. Taste follows through with the hoppiness and a crisp aftertaste. Left a supremely enjoyable taste that got better with each taste. A very enjoyable beer."
"thx unionmade & ms. unionmade"
"Didn't know what to expect from this. A double pilsener. Another one of the crazy hopped up American beers, but this time a lager. Aroma was tremendous. So fruity, hoppy, floral and just plain amazing. I could smell this a mile away. Great taste. Has the characteristics of a lager, but packed with flavour. Hops, malt, fruit, bitterness but still somewhat crisp and clean if you can believe. Great beer."
"D&N: A great choice of beers for NBS number 13. Very complex, Rogue is getting some big style point from me for their wicked cool bottles. Surprisingly easy to drink for such a big beer. Writing this review I can hear it in my head, and the voice of my review is Fukui-san! This beer definitely reigns supreme. Outstanding brew and enthusiastically recommended."
"Cloudy dull orange in color with a thin and tightly-packed white head that did a tolerable job of hanging around and even lacing the glass. Nose is almost all floral hops, with some medicinal alcohol detected as well. Flavor continues to amaze me with only 4 ingredients coming together for a wonderful experience. Front is doughy sweet, with distinct honey flavor creeping in soon after. Dries out, and ends with an alcohol kick that warms you up. Again, very well-balanced and drinkable. I'm very glad to have tried this one again."
"Did I enjoy this one tremendously with my excellent meal at Morimoto? Yes. Will I shell out the 15 bucks to buy it again? No. This is a great beer, but if I can get two great six-packs for the same price, I'm going to pass."
"This is a beer you'd likely want another of, but there's a lot of it in one bottle. I did note that the more esoteric qualities outpaced the meat and potatoes of taste and smell, but I think that's more due to the fact that the ABV is very present, even though it is well-disguised by the malt, hops, and yeast. It's there in the periphery, and while not distracting, you can't totally ignore it either. Still, while not a session beer, for my money, and while a bit pricey, I'd relish another go-round with one of these. And the bottle itself is a keeper."
"A wonderful, thick and pillowy head sat calmly atop a darker-than-straw brew... A sticky lace followed all the way down the side of my Willi Becher. The nose was full of malt and hops, to be sure. The flavor is somewhat caramel-sweet, but not in a cloying way whatsoever. Very smooth and crisp, even for a Double Pilsner. The ABV is well-hidden in this brew, as all I can think about is the fine balance between the hops and the malts..."
"For such an alcoholic brew, this was refreshing and one that, if cost were not prohibitive, I could stick with all night."
"The only problem: if you want to enjoy this beverage again you have to pay the monetary equivalent of inserting the finished ceramic bottle directly up your ass (or in other words, anywhere from 10-15 dollars for a ~22 oz. depending on your location). I doubt I will be making the plunge, no pun intended, even though this was a damn good beer. My compliments to the Iron Chef, Morimoto, and Rogue, but please don't hose your customers on bottling expenses... even though it is quite a fancy one for the collection, it is a one time thing."
"Last swigs: Apricot schnapps with orange juice pulp tickle. $17 a bomber. I got hosed!"
"Drinkability and Overall: Not a bad beer at all. Definitly not. The hops are wonderful, the alcohol adds a nice character to it, and while the malty taste isn't the best, it rounds it off well. I could really drink this one for a while. Try it."
"hop and malt are both up front, not any bite to the hop due to the balance of the malt. this doesnt taste 8.8% at all except maybe a twinge at the very back end of the after taste. the carbonation is perfect, just enough to bubble but not enough to froth or be over bearing. I am amazed how balanced this beer is, especially at the higher ABV.. friggin kudos to rogue, this is tasty, doesnt have the bitterness one finds in some typical european pils... and not as sweet/malty overkill as stuff from the czech repub.. damn tasty (although the ABV can catch up with you), quite a surprise for a pilsner, the style often maligned by beer snobs like me but this one is worth trying. It never peeks into any other realm of too hoppy for a pils, or too sweet for a pils.. it really stradles the line, recommended."
"This posessed some characteristics of a damn good IPA at times, and a strong maibock at others. But nothing, NOTHING like any pilsener I've ever tasted. But damn good."
"Huge creamy head atop a cloudy amber body. Sweet hop smell entices the senses. Silky smooth in the mouth, sweet, hoppy taste with bit of alcohol at the end. Fantastic brew, and my first double pilsner. Highly recommended if you can find it."
"I really dug this beer! It was like a pils yet it was not your average pils by any sense of the word. The color was beautiful with a medium goldish color with hints of copper, this was a great looking beer. The smell was very fresh and grassy with a nice crisp hop scent in the nose as well. The taste was outstanding with a nice crispy hop zing with a nice spice and full bodied malt flavor. I just wish it was not so damn expensive or this would be the session beer for me."
"I had never even heard of an Imperial Pilsner until I first had it about a year ago at Trinity in Providence. I was pleasantly surprised, and that beer quickly became a favorite. I jumped at the chance to try the Rogue offering. It poured from the ceramic bottle a hazy gold color with a thick cream colored head that clung as a sheet of lace to the side of the glass. The nose is a piney hop character , a touch of dough, no real malt. The taste is an explosive bitterness, the pine I detected on the nose, along with loads of citrus/grapefruit. There is a mild malt back that lends a sweetness to the beer. There is a definite alcohol warming on the finish along with a subtle spiciness. Crisp mouth feel, and surprisingly drinkable. Very interesting beer, and despite the posts to the opposite, I love the new ceramic bottles."
"Pours a light pale golden color with a faint head that leaves no lace. Aromas consisted of warming pilsner malts mixed with citrusy floral hops. Initial flavors to this brew were crisps and full with a heavy dosage of pilsner malts and a nice sweetness. The finish was absolutely majestic with a firm hop presence that was spicy and citrusy with a lemon zest finish. There was just a final tone of alcohol just in the end but the hops really helped to hide this out. As for drinkability this one creeps up on ya because it tastes so damn good, yet you wonder where's the alcohol since the flavors are just balanced so amazingly. Overall a beer that must be sought out, especially on draft."
"On opening, I noted a chip in the bottle's rim and some sticky brown substance, perhaps some crystallized sugar. Pours with initial frothiness that settles down to nothing but Casper the Friendly Ghost. Light golden color with extreme clarity, almost to a fault, with slow bubbling. Washed out light malt jam with just a touch hint of lemon and icy wash on nose. May have gone over slightly; very tart on mouth with a cilantro-like taste, but it grows and actually becomes more agreeable with the alcohol pronouncing itself and a low level malt feel. Initially suspicious of this, I ended up enjoying it."
"Pours a somewhat hazy deep golden color. Thin,foamy head. Nice hoppy aroma. Vanilla and somewhat grassy. Not as much as I thought there would be considering the ""imperial"" moniker. Nice big malty and hoppy flavor. Very well hopped but nicely balanced with the malt. Slightly astringent. Good body. Overall a very drinkable beer. Im wondering how fresh this bottle might be but enjoyable none the less. Well worth a try."
"And the bottle itself makes a wicked lightproof growler. Fantastic!"
"There is a lot of merit and purpose here."
"Price a little high but I'm a sucker for new beers and interesting pils in particular. The beer pours a hazy gold-organge. Smell is sweet malt and a little hop. Taste is initial malt, but not sweet, almost a little carmelly or slightly burned. Hop hits initially a little ""musty"" - I am wondering if this is an older bottle. Although I would imagine the earthenware would protect this beer amazingly well, maybe the dry hop aromas have aged out a bit because there is no citrus. The hop reminds me a little of drinking a highly hopped English ESB past its prime. Musty. Still pretty enjoyable because of the real smack in the face bitterness that lingers on. I don't know about this quantity of malt though - man - I get that kind-of-burned malt taste hanging around. Alcohol is very well hidden flavorwise but at 8.8% it's in there!"
"Taste was very good and quite powerful. This one is a sneak-up-behind-you-and-whack-you-in-the-head-when-you're-not-looking kind of beer. Alchohol does not enter into the flavor much, but after drinking the full bottle, you will feel an effect."
"2 fingers of head when poured out which dissipated in 3 minutes into a thin film and ring. Average to above-average carbonation. Poured a clearn tan color. Bitter sweet taste followed by a dry hoppy ending that lingers in your mouth. Unique taste for a unique style of brew. Served in a cermac bottle that is worthy of holding this fine American brew. Thanks again Rogue!"
"All in all this really went well with the pad thai I was enjoying."
"rom the bottle. shared this one with bieristgut. poured a cloudy honey color with a white head. aroma. hops, malts. barely, honey,, citrus, caramel, as it warms grapefruit comes out. this is one of those beers you want to keep the nose to the glass.flavor,bitter hops, malts, honey, a nice sourness, and dryness, and hints of sugar. I think this was a little over priced it was a very good beer but for $14.00 I do not think so. the bottle was nice, so I think that is were the extra cost comes in"
"Cheers"
"An interesting product, as long as you can stomach the price, knowing that much of it is probably paying for the cool bottle."
"Pours gold with a good sized head. Lots of hops in the nose. Mix of grass, spice and citrus. Most interesting pilsner I've ever smelled. Pilsner malt comes through, but the real focus is the hops. Light citrus with most of the flavor being a blend of grassy and citrusy hops. Very interesting pilsner. I wouldn't drink it regularly, especially considering the price, but it is something different, so I can appreciate it. Enjoyed with fellow BA Nickbagofdonuts."
"What a cool bottle this comes in. Flip top and clay/porcelan body. It pours a golden color with a monster head that sticks around for a while and leaves a nice lacing on the glass as well. The aroma has a floral hop with a light pilsner smell over the top. Smells pretty good for a pilsner. The flavors were mostly hops as well with a slight pilsner malt character. Finishes a bit dry. Some spices there, but the taste is very clean and well done. I'd have this one again if it weren't so expensive."
"Excellent."
"""ZAP! BANG! POW!"""
"Overall: Cost me all of $11.49, but considering that I got 750ml worth of brew and another cool fancy looking empty Ceramic bottle to display in my Kitchen, its not bad overall I guess. Would I buy this one again?  Erm, thats a resounding NOPE, NO way Sir!! For $12, gimme two Six-Packs of 12 ounce bottles of StaroBrno instead any day of the week. This is an interesting experiment, but for me it fails miserably, Pilsners are not supposed to be Imperial, its a fancy pants brew that I guarantee you will only ever buy once. This is clearly a Hoi-Polloi exhibit for an Art Gallery aimed at Americans that dont travel, if you catch my drift. Imperial Pilsner is really an Oxy-Moron for me, but I will be more than happy to try the first Double-Lite beer, so I suggest that you try this if you get chance, its damn good - but its not a practical brew by any stretch of the imagination. In short it's the Classic British Sports Car that you always wanted but can't be arsed to maintain. Worth a try, but you'll soon get tired of it, assuming that you have some spare beer money to burn that is, but I'll stick with my practical Japanese Car that I don't have to fuck about with or waste money on."
"I'm enjoying this with raw oysters and must comment on how the two compliment each other. Fell like pouring this stuff right on the shooter."
"Sampled while in Vegas. Came in a 750 ml white ceramic bottle, bottlecapped, but with a swingtop cap for later re-use. Pours out a rich gold colour with a thick white head. The aroma contains orange, coriander, sweetish grains, along with grassy and flowery hops. The flavour is comprised of spicy coriander, pepper, orange peel, toasted biscuity malt, mild hebal hops, and is a bit yeasty. Carbonated mouthfeel, mildly abrasive texture on the finish. A whole bottle of this packs quite a punch, pretty potent, not something I could drink everyday."
"A hazey golden yellow beer. With a creamy white head that leaves just a little lace. The aroma is lightly sweet and spicey. As soon as this hits your mouth you know it is not anything close to your grandfathers Pilsner. There is a touch of grapfruit sweetness at the beginning. Followed quickly by an alcohol rush and a nice dry hoppy finish. Quite interesting."
"Cloudy gold garnet. Fine 1-inch foamy head. Big grassy aroma, very herbal, fresh, sharp. Expressive spicy hops are peppery and floral. Malt is mostly honeyish and almost mango-like. Great malt vs. Hops balance. Aftertaste is long and hoppy. Fine herbs abund on the tongue and marry well the floral suggestions. Definitely has some pilsner malt characteristics. Full body is rather airy and displays low carbonation. Pretty good, but not worth trying more than once I guess."
"P.S.: This is an unfiltered Pilsner, and the last pour was much more foamy, with a hazy yeasty body. The taste however did not change much. Either that, or by now the alcohol has gotten to my head."
"The bottle finally broke me down and I dropped the dough. Previously mysterious within the ceramic container, it pours a beautiful glowing gold. The head looks like an enormous arctic iceflow, slowly melting into a thin layer of white that hangs in to the end. The smell is delightful malt sweetness with thick floral smells in the background. When it first hits the tongue, it seems in danger of being overwhelmingly sweet. Quickly, however, things come together with a healthy hop bite. Floral aromas carry over into the flavor, as does a nice alcohol kick. This is a dangerously drinkable beer and one worthy of its hefty price."
"Big, bold, floral hop flavours. Just the right amount of bready malt flavour to back it up. Dry finish, very clean, with just a touch of spiciness. Slight orange aftertaste. Medium bodied, very soft. Lively carbonation. Surprisingly light on its feet for an all malt beer of this strength."
"26 ounce ceramic flip top bottle. Best if consumed by Jan 1, 2005 on bottle. Malt was present, but it took a backseat to the hops which are present in the bittering, the flavor and the aroma. A slight bit more maltiness would balance the beer near perfection."
"This beer pours a clear, deep gold color. The pouring process generates a prodigious, thick cream colored head. The aroma is all hops, with a pleasing spiciness, and notes of hay, light pine, and a sharp grassiness. The taste is sweet, thickly malty, with lots of hops, but it could actually use a bit more hops to balance out the thick maltiness. This is definitely enjoyable, the spicy hop flavor and bitter finish are quite nice. There is a bit of hot alcohol, which does detract slightly. With this hopping level, if this had been stepped back to a 7% alcohol, it would have been just about perfect. As it is it is just a bit too malty for my tastes."
"Well, this is a fantastic beer brought over for my birthday festival by SheepNutz. Thanks to him for this one. This is a nice beer. It pours an orange tinged yellow. The nose is sweet with malts and nicly hopped, as I like to see in a pils. The flavor is nice and hoppy. The hops flow over the top of my tongue. The finish is a bit sweet from the malts and a bit of spicy peppery hops too. Nice nice and nice. I don't like lagers by rule, but this is very good. The beer is thick, and very easily consumed. This is a nice beer. What a way to spend my birthday."
"This is one cool bottle with the porcelain swingtop. This is a mid gold beer with a huge white head. The nose is very hoppy and it hard to recognise which hops are used. The main notes are fruity and slightly bitter with an unlagerlike profile. This is very drinkable for such a high alcohol lager. Typical Rogue with the large amounts of hops but a nicely put together beer."
"Wow! What a nice bottle, a white ceramic swingtop job with nice graphics. Pours into my Duvel tulip glass with a large soapy aggressive white head over a hazy yeast-infused golden liquid. The nose is quite pilsner like, all light n' delicate smelling with some light fruitiness, them BAM...your tastebuds get slammed by mouthpuckeringly intense hop bitterness undercut by sweet and juicy malt, slightly grassy, slightly bready and a hint of alcohol. Finishes up potent in both bitterness of hop and of alcohol...just delicious as all hell, makes any other pils look positively wimpy by comparison, I don't care what you stack it up against! Unparalleled in taste...unreal!"
"another masterpiece from rogue."
"75 cl ceramic crock painted white with a screened-on label. Swing-top enclosure. Best before Jan 2005. Pours a deep golden, almost bordering amber range with a fluffy, off-white head. Grainy, malty aromas with a fair amount of hops creeping in there, too. Alcohol noticable in the nose. Mostly sweet, resiny and husky tasting with a significant hop crispness in the middle and finishing clean tasting, then a slight alcohol burn in the aftertaste. Pretty darn good for a high octane pils. I like pilseners a lot and I've only tried a few of the newer ""Imperial"" style. This one's quality, overall, it maintains a pilsener feel, yet ""Imperial"" in that newfounded phrase. I think the beauty of this beer is that it maintains the basic pilsener feel, yet exponentially crafted in its root style. I will, most certainly, give this one a whirl if the oppurtunity comes around again."
"Slightly hazed deep golden hue. Mountainous, creamy, steadfast porcelain white head yields lace. Gentle wafts of sugar cookie rich in vanilla and fresh cut grass with a floral twang. Mellow, but enticing aromawise. In flavor, prevalent in malt character is a doughy, buttery, rounded impression of underbaked Challah. Complementing is a stately floral, almost perfume like hop flavor that couples with malt sweetness to lend a suggestion of concentrated nectar a notch shy of honey. Hop bitterness is mild, serving only to offset residual sweetness, thus allowing the pervasive bready sweetness to prevail. Burly, viscous, lusciously dextrinous mouthfeel. As the beer warms, notes of hay and bread crust arise, but remain understated. Finishes sweet, with a fleeting hint of caramelized almond and sugared dough. Quite a unique and delicious brew, indeed. A bit too buttery and sweet to retain base pilsner characterisitics, but a fine brew in itself. If a doppelhellesbock were a style, this would epitomize it. Outstanding."
"This one defiantly is some eye candy sitting on the store shelf calling for you to try it. It comes in a very nice 750ml egg white ceramic-capped growler bottle with a swing top that allows for easy resealing. It was a bit expensive at 13 dollars for the bottle but it was worth it. It poured a clear golden orange color with an excellent white head that dropped to a cap of bubbles about half way through. This one left a decent lacing around the glass as it was drank. The aroma consists of mainly citrus hoppiness with a slight biscuity malt attempting to balance it out. The taste starts of with a bitter hop spiciness that it accompanied by earthy notes as well, malt presence is minimal in the taste. Mouthfeel is good with good carbonation. Nowhere was the 8.8% alcohol detected defiantly making this highly drinkable. Good beer at an expensive price due to the container. I would defiantly get more if it cam in a cheaper bottle."
"ng"
"Hazy, golden in hue with a slight peachy-straw highlight, the color is a little more developed that a typical Pils. A massive white head donned the beer beautifully. Over two fingers of fluffy white head tried its best to hold pat. After a few moments it subsided to about half the original size and then it collapsed to a tight cap. The subsequent lacing was very widespread and it looked like old, slightly tattered wallpaper. This is a very striking looking beer. The nose is a little raw with big, warm, alcohol notes, in conjunction with some strawberry like fruitiness. Honestly this smells like a Belgian ale of sorts! The hops are noticeable but they are not bright and they dont really remind of any Pils I have had. The hops are floral and herbal, very nice. The malt was largely undetectable. I like the bouquet, it is unique, and it reminds me a little bit of Duvel (with less potency). Inviting. The palate has a big blast of hops upfront, now this is what I am looking for! The hoppy flavors are great; it is very herbal (somewhat flowery too) with all sorts of little flavors sprouting off. Some lemon notes, pears, and white wine. The straight bitterness is above moderate and very fitting. The alcohol punch is strong and it creates heat that is very noticeable on the back of the throat. Add in some peppery notes and faint strawberry-like fruitiness and you have one winner of a palate here! Again, it has some underlying Belgian qualities, Im digging that, and, yes, I realize that Czech Pilsner Yeast was used. The malt is thin but Pilsner-like, clean and crisp. This is damn tasty and far more complex then I was expecting. The 8% plus abv is really working in this beer, I just love the dimensions it adds. I am very impressed. Surprisingly long aftertaste, mainly of raw heat and residual hops bitterness, in other words this beer burnt one wicked imprint into my tongue! Medium/medium-full in body, the carbonation is low but natural and the mouthfeel is quite good. Filling. The drinkability is fantastic! It truly is for such a big beer. Id imbibe in this regularly if it were less expensive and found in Omaha. My girlfriend purchased me a bottle in Iowa City for around $12 (thanks Tara!). It was worth every penny! Strongly recommended."
"The taste is somewhat peppery up front with a full on punch of hops in the finish. There's no trace of anything but the highest quality grains in this thing. The alcoholic content is strong but does not put one away by any means. The flavor is huge and great."
"Drinkability: Surprisingly so given the high abv."
"Thick mouthfeel and high abv hinder the drinkability. I have reservations about whether an imperial pilsner is a viable style. This is much better on tap, if you can find it, at least in terms of drinkability."
"expensive. but worth trying. pours out a orange hued golden color, the head, white as can be. the nose is raw, some grain and malt with a noticably strong hop presence (for a pils). in the mouth it is full bodied, slightly sticky and hearty. flavors are all in check, big malt, big hops, big beer. some alcohol is noticable on the finish, but this is mainly a simple tastey beer that has all of its delicious qualities kicked up a few notches. good stuff."
"Sampled 4/2/04"
"NB: There is a slight possibility that my bottle was subjected to freezing as much of the recent NJ allotment of this was. However the condition of the crown, etc., lead me to believe this was a decent sample."
"This came in a rather unique bottle and poured a golden color, forming a very foamy white head that latticed the side of the glass with lacs as it subsided. A medium amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of hops, a touch of malt and a small amount of caramel. The flavor was of hops, caramel and grain. The finish was bittersweet and heavy on the palate. Fairly hop heavy for a pils, so I don't know if this is what they mean by an imperial style."
"Many thanks to Winomark for the sample. I was expecting to hate this, or find it to be a real distortion of the pilsner style, but Rogue has done good work here."
"Its so hard to write about this beer. Its just so simple. Big, malty, hoppy, very yummy. Thats all you need to write. Nothing like youd expect from a pilsner. Its actually more along the lines of a nice malty IPA just a little toned down. Definitely worth trying if you feel like spending the money."
"Presented in a nice ceramic 750ml bottle with a swing-top cap and silk-screened graphics. Beautiful aroma of pilsner malt as soon as the cap is popped. Pours a nice golden hue with a bubbly white head that vanishes quickly. More aroma of pilsner malt, with some undertones of hops and a whiff of alcohol. Thick, almost syrupy mouthfeel. Huge maltiness, but overall very light, since it's pilsner malt. Packs a bit of a punch at 8.8% abv. Probably couldn't handle a whole bottle by myself, but I'm very impressed with this one."
"Drinkability: Overall, a very nice beer. I'm not a big fan of pilsners, but this (admittedly not a very pilsner-y pilsner) is a tasty brew. It certainly cements my conviction that I will like pretty much any beer that has the word ""Imperial"" in the style."
"Floral aroma with blending of malt. Crisp excellent pils. SO much alchohol, but well masked by the above. Light on tongue, light carbonation. Lace. Even fruity yeast. Dry aftertaste but satisfying. A beautiful bottle with a cap. Enjoy the weekend together."
"Dayglow orange color in the glass with a airy pale white sticky head. Mostly grapefruit peel in the nose. Upfront the taste is slightly bitter and warming with abv apparent right off the bat. Lots of heat and bitterness on the tongue. It is bitter but not very complex otherwise. Strange light mouth that leaves your tongue high and dry. Also a strange slight smoke aftertaste. It's ok but I was a little dissapointed."
"Such an odd beer, both things I like with it and don't like. I like the big hop character to it, but yet the finish is strangely barleywinish with a large sweet malt (in a pils style beer?) with a slap of hops to try and wipe it off."
"Special thanks to LuckySeven82!"
" This is one very intersting beer. It brings a lot to the table, and the drinkability and balance they achieve with it is outstanding. Good on Rogue for this one."
"On tap at the Blind Tiger NYC. Poured golden amber and cloudy with some sediment, minimal head. Bready nose. Big beer, floral hoppyness, tons of malt. Very strong pisner. Enjoyed at the recent extreme beer fest. Rarely on tap, I liked it, would be interested in the bottled version as well."
"I think this style should go over well. This is for all those people who think pilsners don't have enough flavor to be enjoyed. Well double the ingredients and those wonderful delicate flavors of pilsners are now very powerful. Very basic recipe. Pilsner malt and sterling hops. This hop variety gives a wonderfull floral and citrus aroma without being extremely bitter. I hope to see more of this style. It's just too hard to enjoy a pilsner with all the big barleywines and imerial stouts out that. This changes that. it is worth $12 a bottle? Hell, the bottle itself is worth the $12."
"First off I really love the bottle. Anyway, the beer poured out a hazy golden/orange color. Almost looked like an IPA to be honest. Huge hop aroma combined with some floral aroma as well. Also a slight whiff of alcohol, but it's not over the top. Taste was brilliant. Very profound malt taste hits you first with some hop bitterness that seems to last forever. These hops really seem to have a big bite to them, but yet their controlled. Very interesting, and very good too. Finishes nice and crisp. Quite clean. 14.99 a bottle, but worth every penny I spent on it. I might get another bottle soon."
"Slightly hazed golden. Big crop of frothy long lasting white head adorns the surface. Lacing is quite full. Nice hop aroma, but it is quite subdued. The mouthfeel is nicely carbonated. And the body is about medium-full. The taste has a crisp hoppiness to it. But also a rounded maltiness. Hay like flavors accent lightly. Some grassy tones and yeast too. And an agreeable lingering bitterness. Definitely unique taste for a pilsner. Tastes good enough and goes down the chute nicely, but this is not the elite beer I was hoping it to be."
"This ""Imperial Pilsner"" poured a cloudy gold yellow color with some sediment and with white foam that settled. The smell was a grain aroma with a hint of hops. The taste was bready and grainy with some floral hops and bitter NW hops and a bit of alcohol. There was a slight sweetness to the malty flavor. The mouthfeel was sweet and creamy with medium body and low carbonation. This was an interesting beer, and it was difficult to compare to ""normal"" pilsners. The flavor improved as the glass warmed."
"Between the awesome ceramic bottle and the beautiful pour topped with a luscious three-finger head and massive amount of lacing left behind, this is the most beautiful beer I've ever seen. The smell is very clean with a solid punch of grassy hops, and it tastes like you'd expect -- a pilsner on steroids. Mouthfeel is on the thin side, but I suppose that's normal for the style. Nearly 9% abv? Where's it hiding? Overall the ultimate summer's day beer and another feather in Rogue's cap."
"I didn't like the taste as much as I was hoping I would. Starts out a bit sweet with a pleasant malty taste followed by a piney hop flavor. This is all overpowered by a strong alcohol flavor that lingers long into the aftertaste. It isn't bad at first but half way through it just starts to take over. This isn't a bad beer there just isn't much for the alcohol to hide behind."
"Whatever super tasty brew, both of 'em."
"This was interesting and not bad. I didn't find it great, but was surprised to find that it wasn't the bad monster pilsner I thought it could be. I had tried only a very small sample at the CS at the last BA beer fest. I wasn't sure what to think. So this past weekend ordered a bottle at Anam Cara. The bottle is very nice, a lovely ceramic with swing top and graphics, I took it home. The pour was a cloudy light golden. I found the aroma to be reminiscent of a thick jellied candy aroma...it was not thin and treacily, but really just what I wrote: thick and like jellied candy. I found the mouthfeel to be full-bodied: thick and chewy. The alcohol tried to hide, but I could tell. In spite of that, it was a well-rounded beer that was smooth but strong. I think this beer is it's own category, and I just couldn't find the pilsner qualities that are contained in it's name. Not a bad beer, but not outstanding."
"This is like love in a bottle :)"
"Overall, this is a great beer. I would definitely come back to it (if the price drops)"
"On tap at Max's on Broadway. With a slight cloudiness that didn't bother me in the slightest, it left some measurable lace. The color was yellowish and the head puffy and fine. An Imperial Pilsner has plenty of malt backbone and a detectable bit of alchohol. Enjoyable all the way down, with a Saazzy aroma and a lingering bite. I'd rate it more drinkable if it were a bit less powerful. But I'd definitely have another anytime."
"And oh yeah -- the bottle is neat too."
"This is one hell of a beer. Drank to honor of the life of Debris; shared with alexgash and sus. Anyway, this nectar is found within a magnificent ceramic bottle that weights about 10 pounds. Pours a striking golden color with a lofty inviting creamy head. Smell if of Saaz hops, some other aromatic hops, and sweet malts. Full bodied and smooth as a zambonied ice rink. Full malt flavors backed by a mango-like subtle sweetness and a very flavorful dose of those hops. Goes down very smooth and easy. I could drink this all the time."
"On tap poured into a pilsener glass. It pours a cloudy gold color with two fingers of head. There is lots of sticky lace left on the glass. The smell is fairly hoppy, the sterling hops are interesting. Good malty aromas as well. The taste starts malty and grassy, and ends with a floral hop punch. Very well balanced. Just a hint of alcohol on the finish. The mouthfeel is thicker than any other pilsener could possibly get. The drinkability is fairly good for a 8.8% brew. An awesome pils!"
"Simply fantastic. A 9% beer that drinks like it's 5.5%. If this was a regular beer (are you listening Rogue?), this would certainly be something I'd drink regularly. Hopefully this will enter the regular Rogue rotation and I'll be able to have it again."
"It has a bright golden color and big hoppy aroma that is spicy, floral, and slight cirtus. It is medium bodied with a crisp, dry, very bitter, herbal finish. Big on hops and alcohol, which is hidden very well. The lager equivalent of the Imperial IPA. I think it was a little syruppy. I know it needed to be to stand up to the bitterness. This is not a beer that I can drink a lot of even though I enjoyed it."
"The beer pours a hazy gold color with a thin white head that eventually fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice pale malt and hop scent; very appealling. The taste is good also. This beer has an elevated abv, but it goes down smooth with a slight warmer at the finish. It has a nice balance of pale malts and hops which make it quite enjoyable. This is a pilsner I can get used to. The mouthfeel is just right. This is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. I love this beer. Rogue is probably my favorite brewery. They just push the envelope every time. Only they can take a simple, boring, beer style and turn it into something great. It drinks very well."
"This was a nice beer, but the overpowering alcohol flavor and aroma detracted from my overall enjoyment. The first few minutes that it was in my glass was very nice, and I took that into consideration in my numbers. But very quickly, this beer turned into an alcoholfest. In my opinion, it was worth the $14.00 one time to try it, but I doubt that I will pick up any more."
"This beer has been sitting in the cooler calling my name everytime I go into the beer store so I finally got it $19.00 bucks!Besides the kickass bottle it pours a great rich golden color with a real nice head that leaves some terrific lacing,aroma has that light steely tinge with some malty fruity aromas I dont pick up that much hop presence.But the hop presence comes thru in the taste with a big resiny taste but with a great crisp malt atack to balance it out,man what a great beer worth $19.00 uhm not sure but a great beer that Iam really enjoying."
"The only improvement I can think of - ditch the fancy expensive bottle and put this in some normal glass bombers."
"Comments  This came in a really cool 26 ounce painted ceramic bottle."
"Thickish pour with a marmalade color. Head is scant and thinnish but leaves a lot of dotty laces. Very nice malt, lightly bready with a shortbread feel and honey sweetness. Some sense of an orangey quality that transitions into a sparkling and very well-done hopiness. Light nutmeg sensations. Very close to perfectly balanced. While straying away from a Pilsner in many ways, lagering seems to make this ""Imperial"" brew plenty easy to quaff, despite respectable alcohol. Rogue does another fine beer with this one."
"Great painted ceramic bottle that was capped yet has a swing top attached as well. Poured a slightly hazy bright gold with a huge head that settled down to a not so huge head. Aroma reminds me of a Wit style with wheat malt and yeast in the nose. Maybe it's my imagination though. Also detect quite a bit of hops in the aroma and sweetness from the malt as well. This aroma is a big and bold one to be sure. I wasn't sure what an Imperial Pilsner would be like, but now it makes sense to me with the latest trend in super charged styles. Just double up on malt and hops and you've got an Imperial-fill in the blank brew. Body is really full and smooth. Flavor is also a strong one with sweet malt leading the way along with some hops blending in. This is a big beer and if you like big bold beers such as the Imperial class, you will like this one for sure. It's not a to style pils and doesn't claim to be one either. Enjoy it for what it is."
"Drinkability...well it was a good tasting beer. However for the price, I'll stick with other brews. Not worth the cash. I wonder if it was in a regular glass bottle instead of a ceramic swingtop if it would be cheaper. Then I might consider it. Maybe."
"Pours cloudy golden color with a white head that laces the glass. Earthy smell of hops with a twinge of grain round out the nose. Tastes malty sweet with a strong earthy-spicy hop / grainy malt mixture coming out to tantalize the pallet. Upon second tasting is a much more complex beer then my initial first taste. No alcoholic flavors permeate and thus is extremely drinkable while you can still stand. The cool bottle is just a bonus and I wish this beer was available in standard packaging and also be available to other markets."
"Nice deep golden body with some cascading bubbles. The head average size, bright white and lasted a reasonable amount of time. Good lacing. Sweet, slightly grassy aroma, a bit of pine, but mostly noble hop aromas. Sandy malt flavor, but not dry. Easy drinking given the size of the beer. A little fruit (almost like apricots or peaches.) Tasty, but there's something missing almost."
"At $12.99 for 26 oz., it is not a beer I could make a habit of, but I heartily recommend everyone picking up at least one. And assuming the price is at least partially effected by the bottle, I would gladly welcome more conventional packaging in exchange for a lower price. Great bottle yes, but great beer is it's own reward."
"cool bottle, bought a case (6 bottles) for $54 at a PA distributor. Was stamped Oct 15th on the box (brew date??). This was a very good beer but it's more like a bitter then a pilsner. It has a nice malt flavor and the yeast of a good pilsner but way overhopped for this style. I was surprised just how bitter (and good) it was. if you don't like hoppy beers I wouldn't recommend this. I like it."
"This beer came in a way-cool re-sealable, ceramic 750ml bottle with japanese writing and iron chef Morimoto's signature on it. It poured out a dark golden colour with a very bleach white head. The aroma was very hoppy, citric, and yet still quite malty. This really smelled like a hopped up, high octance version of a classic czech pilsener such as budvar or pilsner urquell. The taste was definately unique, but still very ""pilsner-ish"". This beer tasted heavily of fresh, citric hops and heavy background malts. It was very well balanced. The mouthfeel was not too thick or cloying and the drinkability was quite excellent..."
"Very impressive, and NOW I HAVE GROWLER!"
"It comes in a cool white stopper-style bottle with Iron Chef, Morimoto's signature and Japanese writing and artwork on the side. It pours a hazy brassy gold with a creamy white head. A biscuity cracker-like malt houses a lemony bitterness. Orange peel and a lightly astringent taste linger in the background. A slightly tart quinine-like effervescence makes for an unusual mouthfeel. This brew only sweetens a little as it warms. Warming alcohol can be noticed throughout. Thanks to Genaro for bringing this back from Newport, OR."
"Sample was 22oz cerami swing top bottle. Pours a nice light blonde with a pillowy white foam head. The head lingers nicely and laces well down the side of the glass. The smell is crisp with the floral sents of the hops. The taste echos the smell, crisp pilsner bite. But if a regular pilsner bites like a dachshund this think is a doberman. Malts and Hops are notched up to the breaking point.. But never give in. This is one impressive beer. Smooth drinking and well balanced. One could drink this for days, except for that pesky 8.8abv. One of the best Rogue products ive had. plus it comes in that handy dandy resealable bottle, which could be used for left over beer from 750s or 22s."
"Presented in a 750 ml ceramic silkscreened bottle with resealable top. The color is an attractive pale straw yellow with a large fluffy white head, and heavy lacing that bands the inside of the glass. Might be my imagination, but the aroma smells almost...ceramic! Wonder if it's the packaging. As for the taste...imagine a regular old pilsner...on steroids. Everything is more pronounced, but still balanced. More hop, more malt...yet it remains relatively true to the style. There's a nice fruit character to the malt. The hops predominate on the finish, but are not overpowering. I'm intrigued by this beer, since it's the first non-ale I've had from Rogue. Not sure if it's worth the pricetag, but an intriguing brew and definitely worth a try."
"Had this at the Stone 7th Anniversary drunkfest. This might have been my favorite of the fest (perhaps tied with Speedway Stout). I really liked this beer. I can't wait until they bottle this! Poured a brilliant golden with a big white head. Smell is mostly Saaz hops but sweet malts detectable. Taste is sweeter than your Prima pils up front--good malt presence--but a perfect dose of Saaz hops smoothly takes over along with an almost fruity element as well. Very interesting and unbelievably drinkable for an 8.8% abv beer. Awesome."
"All in all, it's quite nice."
