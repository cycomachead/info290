"I've only had a few IPL offerings and this one is really more of an IPA. No lager finish and way heavy on the alcohol IMO."

" I did not see any settling, but I still poured sort of gently, getting a finger of tawny head with good retention in the process. Color was a deep-gold (SRM = > 5, < 7) with NE-quality clarity. The Unholy Trio of Midas, Mammon and Croesus did not suddenly show up. Instead, they were already here, just based on the beer's name! They are such punks. Nose had a scent of tropical fruits, especially coconut and papaya. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium. The taste was nothing like the nose, sadly. It was much more bitter, more towards citrus rind and some grass. Not bad, but not what I was expecting. Finish was dry, with some fusel alcohol heat."

"O- A great tasting IPL. Easy to drink with a huge helping of hop bitterness."

"Overall – A rather tasty and quite easy drinking brew. A rather nicely, moderately, hopped brew that maintains a still crisp lager taste. A very nice drinker."
""
"Final Thoughts: Definitely not the beer I was expecting given the description on the bottle. I hope more breweries try out the IPL style though just to see if it can be refined. Would I drink it again? Meh."
""
""
"Taste / Palate: The taste is the same with a smooth feel and mild bitterness in the finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Something just isn't quite working for me here... Between the bready malts, bubblegum and grapefruit bitterness, it just isn't adding up to me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Beer is medium to medium-heavy in body, with medium carbonation intensity, resulting in a beer that has a mouthfeel that is gently foamy and smooth. Closes quite dry, with light stickiness on the lips and palate."
""

"Interesting, but not really one of my faves out of the hybrid world of IPLs and Imperial Pils. I'd rather just have the base Dortmunder Gold. Sometimes less is more."
"It's a decent beer, and perhaps I'm being a little hard on it because I expect great things from Great Lakes, but there are too many other, rising ""IPLs"" out their now to ever really justify picking this one up again (especially with the price). Vapid lager qualities and not too standout-ish in the hop bill, either. It's okay, it really is, but I expect more from these guys."
""
""
""
""
"O - Interesting take on a lager. Glad I had a chance to try this and wouldn't mind drinking again."
""
"Overall- This beer in my opinion is very complex and keeps me going back for another sip to figure out what has me stumped this is a very well crafted beer."
""
""
"O: If it weren't so bitter, it might be among the better lagers I've ever had. As it stands, it's still a good hoppy lager, but bring your bitter tooth."
"I great beer, but not sure it's hoppy enough or malty enough... but it is a combination of the two styles, to some extent, and that's by design. Anyway, it's a unique celebration beer and I give it good praise. Yes, I am quite biased in favor of Great Lakes Brewing Company because one of my best friends worked there for nine years and I've spent many a fine afternoon/evening at the place. But my preference for GLBC beer is primarily because the beers are almost always outstanding. Cheers!"

"Deep golden, brilliant pour with 1.5 inch creamy, off-white head. The initial nose suggests citrus, malt, and biscuits. Rich palate with medium-full body and extended hop and malt notes. Floral hops and a slight hint of soapiness. Modest carbonation. The head has settled to 1/8 inch, leaving beautiful Belgian lace. Well balanced malt and hops on the palate - some spiciness. The ABV is not noticeable. Fresh."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – In interesting beer that has a little something for everyone taste wise. Reminds me a bit of a fall seasonal/Oktoberfest type brew. Probably wouldn't pick this up again, but was worth trying once."
""
""
""
"This is Dortmunder gold's bigger brother, I guess. I certainly has the same flavor profile. Well worth trying, but I prefer my lagers a little less sweet. For their 25th anniversary, I expected something more unique."
"Pours a clear orange-hued gold with two inches of frothy off-white head that settles unevenly and leaves a ton of lace streaks and spots. Aroma of sweet and biscuity malts, grassy and floral hops, citrus peel, and a bit of a spicy kick. Surprisingly clean. Flavor of sweet malts, tangerine, floral notes, grass, and resin. Light-medium-bodied, with moderate carbonation and a juicy then dry mouthfeel. Some bitterness late."
"This is a great summer choice for people like me who are not generally big fans of pilsners and other lighter lagers."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I've never sought after pilseners before, but I've really been enjoying this one! There is a nice complexity here, a balance where all of the flavors play their part in this coordinated symphony, no one stands out from the other. A very flavorful and nearly refreshing beer, and one that may leave you contemplative after each sip. I highly recommend this one."
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is very nice- medium body and moderately carbonated. A little resinous for my taste. This is certainly worth trying but they should do some more experimenting with this style."
""
"Overall: Great Lakes is a company that seems to always deliver. While I'm usually not into the hoppier beers, I appreciate the complexity of this one and how, even with the bitterness of the hops, I can walk away feeling that everything is balanced and I want more."

"O-The balance of the hops and the Imperial Pils did not go together."
"Not one of my favorites from Great Lakes. This beer poured a clear copper with frothy white head that is lacing quite nicely. The scent is faint but there is bittering hops and maybe a tinge of English malt. The taste is mostly dominated by alcohol...and it is very bitter all the way through the beer....not much malt balance. The mouthfeel is medium in body with decent carbonation....and very dry. Overall not a fan of this one....glad I split a four pack with my neighbor as it was a bit pricey."
""
""
""
"Overall: great balance that is hard to find in this style. It truly is a hoppy beer and a lager at the same time. Great celebration of 25 years"
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a very well done IPL, my first in fact. It is really bursting with many layers of flavor. I like the choice for a 25th anv. beer from GLB."
""
"Overall: A pretty good twist on a lager. Good biscuity rye spiced malts with a big helping of hops."
""
""
""
""
"O- A solid beer but doesnt really raise the style to the next level."
"O - Like the few other IPLs out there, this was very well done. I commend GL for their work and for helping define a new category of beer with the few others out there doing IPLs. I would recommend IPA lovers try this one for sure."
"Overall - Really nice beer. A nice mix of a ipa and lager, with one of the best balances you could ask for. Its not the smoothest beer out there, so the drinkability is hinder after a couple bottles, but none the less, is enjoyable and worth a drink."
""
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied."
""
"Well, I don't know all of my scores off the top of my head, but this is probably my second least favorite GLB beer (Just behind -- or ahead? -- Lake Erie Monster). It's far from a bad beer, but I'm not sure what to make of it. It smells like an IPA (and a pilsner. And Dortmunder Gold.), but it tastes of dough and alcohol. I'm strangely compelled by this one. Pretty solid, and worth trying, but I won't exactly miss it once it's gone."
""
""
""
"O - I was looking forward to this offering and though the entire time I was saying, ""just give us the Imperial Dortmunder and ill be happy"". I am glad they released this IPL as it was extremely well crafted and really the staple of what the brewery is about. They make some excellent ales but also some of the best lagers.. It was appropriate to do Silver and Gold and its something to get ahold of now. Very creative brew and one ill always remember as GLBC's way of celebrating 25 years of fine brewing. Not only was this a tribute to their past but like the bottle says a nod to the future. Glasses up to GLbG again and a congrats on 25 years!"
"Overall, this is a great example of a new American style. Known as an India Pale Lager, very few examples of the style if any have ever been drank there."

"Mouthfeel is very nice not to heavy with a great mouthfeel."
""
""
""
""
"D/O: This anniversary lager is of the typical high quality of Great Lakes, full of great intentions and careful consideration of different aspects of balance. If there is a continuum of qualities with Commodore Perry at one end and Rye of the Tiger at the other, this IPL would comfortably be placed near the midway point between them. What this beer bears little resemblance to is traditional pilsner--rather, it is another iteration of this brewery's approach to IPAs, that happened to be brewed with lager yeast. The single greatest complaint that can be leveled upon it is the strength of this beer--excessive, considering the qualities present."

"O- leaned more towards their lager then a PA it was more spicy and malty than hoppy but it was refreshing and worth a try"
""
"Vibrant copper color with quickly diminishing white head and nice lacing. Aroma is malty with a light hop presence, but pretty weak. Flavor is huge compared to the aroma. It's got a powerful mix of bitter, piney hops, roasty malts, and herbal earthy notes. Mouthfeel is light with high carbonation that tingles. Overall it's a very good, unique beer."
"The beer is golden hued and clear with a small white head. Huge lager yeast aroma, with grain, sourdough bread. Nice flavor, though a bit unbalanced by the over-abundance of lager yeast character. Hop character throughout with a gentle bitter finish. Overall, this was decent, but I wouldn't want to drink a 12 oz. bottle by myself."
""
"Pours a slightly hazy yellow-ish color with an off white head. In the aroma, orange citrus hops. In the taste, big citrus hops, and a touch of alcohol, but a nice balance. A small bite of citrus hops and a medium bodied mouthfeel, with a nice earthy citrus hop in the aftertaste. I am truly impressed by this beer, I have not really enjoyed and IPL until this one."

"Well done....not an all-time great but very enjoyable...if anything slightly overcarbonated as GL beers can be from time to time...just slightly..."
"This is a new style du jour, and I love it. This is a worthy entrant into the arena."
""
""
""
""
"If the beer is a hoppy lager, then it's a fine beer. If its a light bodied IPA, then it's a fine beer. There's nothing about the fusion found here that suggests that it is anything more or less that simply a fine beer. But it is one that makes me think with every sip."
"The body is light, almost medium, and deep. There's a good smoothness to the consistent crisp bite as each sip rolls on the tongue off a steady carbonation. It's clean overall and goes slightly dry into the herbal finish without getting too chalky."
""
""
""
"A hoppy lager with a little bit of a booziness problem. Still a damn fine effort from a stand-up brewery. A bang-up brew. A four-pack is an optimal quantity. Good job, Great Lakes!"
"This was my first beer review."
"Overall: Interesting hybrid, but this isn't really a Pale Lager. I would describe this as an Imperialized version of Eliot Ness with a boatload of citrusy hops. Which really makes sense as an anniversary beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Smooth, bright, citrusy grapefruit. Nice full-bodied mouthfeel and crisp aftertaste without being syrupy. Very drinkable. One of the better beers I've had this year. A 6 of these could go down very enjoyably which is not something that you can say about all 7.5% beers."
"O - I hope to see more breweries taking on an IPL, but this is really lacking in the lager area, its very reminiscent to Alchemy Hour, but just a little less awesome. It really needs toned down, but if you told someone it was an IPA, they'd believe you."

"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, best before 8/31/2013. Pours lightly hazy golden amber color with a 1 finger dense off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass; with moderate streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of grapefruit, lemon zest, pear, apple, grape, floral grass, cracker, bread, honey, light pine, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of hop, yeast, and malt notes; with good strength. Taste of grapefruit, lemon zest, pear, apple, floral, grass, cracker, bread, honey, pine, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, light fruits, floral, grass, cracker, bread, pine, honey, and earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of hop, malt, and yeast flavors; with good sweetness/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Overall this is a very nice India pale lager. All around nice balance of hop and malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."
"Very flavorful brew. Malt is masked by hops, which are somewhat muddled. Citrus is tough to decipher. Bitterness is a little too intense for my palate."

"right up there as one of my favorites of the style. Great Job guys, it seems like the last two new beers I have from them were all pretty good and this one might be the best of them, keep up the good work."

"A very good beer. Here's to another 25 year Great Lakes!"

"Overall a fun brew from the Great Lakes brewery, let's hope there's still 25 more years left in the tank."
"Happy 25th Ann. to this old school midwestern brewery wich I still think is the best of the mid west...and Iam from Michigan!Poured into a becker a deep rich golden/copper with a large fluffy two finger white head that left multiple broken rings of lace as it settled.Caramel and doughy malts stand out most in the nose with a shot of spicy hops,to me it's like an amped up Vienna style lager in the nose.a smooth feel to the beer with just the right feel.Flavors of caramel and boozy fruit,the doughiness is alot like a bigger pale bock,the hops give a mildly citric but more spicy finish.This is a cool lager,it's Vienna like at one momint and maibock in another,then a big shot of hops come.Iam warming to this style a little and this beer helps."

"Overall (4.25): Strikes me as a fuller version of Dortmunder Gold with a very solid IPA-styled hop load. It’s got the characteristic notes of what a good lager should be in my mind, with nutty, toasted malts and a clean, snappy finish. Add to that a well-styled, well-structured, and appropriately bitter hop character, and the various parts of this beer add up to an exceptional example of the style. Personally, I really, really dig this beer."
""
"12oz brown bottle with a freshness date of 9/2/13 poured into a pilsner glass. Amber/orange with a golden halo. Thin head. Smells of American hops, burnt veggies, potpourri, and the 7.5% ABV comes through very clearly. Bitter clumsy taste. Finishes drier than expected - but not as dry as the Tank 7 by Boulevard I was drinking last night. This was my first imperial pilsner and my first from Great Lakes. I've now had the anniversary offerings from Goose Island, New Glarus, and Great Lakes. Are anniversary beers just categorically bad?"

"overall another winner from great lakes. had no idea what to expect from this one going in, and i like what i got. ill enjoy the rest of the 4 pack."
"Brilliant amber color with a creamy, ivory colored head, good retention & frothy lacing at the top of the glass. Fresh aromas of citrus, biscuit, caramel, grass, slight tropical mango. Balanced flavors of biscuit, toasted grain, caramel, mango, grapefruit rind, pine, yeast. Medium body; crisp, dry finish with some pine & grapefruit rind lingering. Excellent idea for a 25th anniversary beer! I want to get some more of this!"
""
""
"Overall another solid beer from Great Lakes. Really digging this style and am excited to try any breweries take. Dortmunder Gold is a solid base to start with and it makes this beer solid. Give it a try if your into hops."
""
""
""
"Silver and Gold Imperial Style Pale Lager is a 25th anniversary beer from Great Lakes. Pilsners are not my favorite style, but I do enjoy (traditional) lagers with their clean malt flavors and nice peppery finish. This one is like Dortmunder Gold with a generous dry-hopping. Experimental? Possibly. Successful? I think so. I could definitely see myself enjoying the earthy bitterness of this one just before a meal."
""
""
"Overall: Definitely worth a try. Will please light and dark beer drinkers alike."
""
""
""
"O: This is a very enjoyable IPL. It strikes a very nice balance between the classic lager style and the hops that finish it up. This might become one of my go to session lagers. its smooth, crisp, refreshing, easy drinking but the flavor doesn't let you down at all! / 90"
""

"O- My first IPL, which seems to be an emerging style. I really liked the hop character on this beer and it was really refreshing. The lagering of this beer seemed to give it a lot more sweetness and crispness than other IPAs. Really glad I got to try this one."
"This is a huge miss. A shame that this is the 25th Anniversary of a brewery I normally like. Either Great Lakes is living in a vacuum where lagers with American hops don't exist or they tried to ""sell"" an imperial Pilsner or Imperial Dortmunder w/ the promise of American hops. Whatever the approach was, this plain sucks. I wish this had been vetted in the pub, I would have happily passed along this feedback - there are SO many other beers that they could have riffed on. This actually made me miss Imperial Dortmunder which, besides the booze, was a much cleaner and focused beer. One of the worst big releases of the year. Disappointing through and through."
""
"O: Overall another winner from GLBC"
"O - Its a lager and it has great hop flavor. Best part is 25 years of Great Lakes Brewing!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"In conclusion, as a long-time fan of Great Lakes, this is another great anniversary ale based on their flagship brew. The IPL presents the potential danger to simply unload hops on a middle-of-the road lager, but the brewers crafting truly great lagers can bring new complexity in an exciting way. Well done - cheers!"
"Silver & Gold IPL is surprisingly good. It’s a really nice hoppy lager. It’s honestly much better than I anticipated. Great Lakes may surprise some with this 25th Anniversary release, but it doesn’t surprise me at all. Given that their flagship, Dortmunder Gold, is a lager…this is perfect. I believe Imperial Dortmunder was their 20th Anniversary release. Silver & Gold IPL is fitting for the 25th. Good stuff. Happy 25th!!!"
""

"I really like this beer. It's another winner that Great Lakes can add to their resume. More proof that Great Lakes knows their lagers. This is great example of this emerging ""IPL"" style. Recommended."
""
"O - The IPL is a fairly new style to me. I had my first one about ten months ago and have only had a handful of varieties. I find it an interesting alternative to an IPA. It has a lot of flavor and goes down quite easily. I am kind of a Great Lakes homer, so of course I like this beer."
""
"O: This tastes very nice. Seems like a similar hop bill to Burning River. I'll probably be picking up another four pack while it's still around."
"Great Lakes try at a hoppy lager doesn't really do justice to their 25th anniversary."
""
"Appearance is the gold hue you'd expect from a German lager. The aroma is unique, plenty of hops but with an almost sugary sweetness. The flavor is similar, a full-bodied hit of complex hops followed by a sweet aftertaste reminiscent of Munich lager (which, oddly enough, is among the most subtly hopped lagers out there). The mouthfeel is rich but not at all heavy, making this a complex but drinkable beer. I've tried Sam Adams IPL and Victory's Prima Pils but have never tasted anything that so purely melded the flavors of an IPA over a refreshing lager base. An ambitious experiment pulled off flawlessly."
""
""
""
"I think the IPL is a bit of a confused style, one that I like a lot. I've had many that have a similar likeness to a very clean APA or ones like that that are pretty much an Imperial Pilsner. Either way, a whole lot of fun to drink."
