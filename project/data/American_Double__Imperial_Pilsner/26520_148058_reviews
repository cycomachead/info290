"O - A very intense beer, Jack's Abby has renewed my interest in Lagers.  (!!)"
"nope this is not good imo"

"Not a fan of triple's so I should have stayed away. Had heard good things prior."
""
""
""
"Huge tropical aroma and taste. Hint of pine in the end."
""
"M - Fuller bodied and medium carb.  Creamy finish..  Not too sticky for a double.  A little boozy tingle.  Very drinkable for the style."
"Not up to the level of Jack's Abby's usual work."

"Full bodied beer with a nice lingering flavor.  With the exception of sour it really touches all of your taste buds.  Even with all of the big flavors it's still reasonably smooth with a good carbonation level.  Starts slightly sweet  moving to slightly salty/earthy then goes to a nice not quite gritty bitter finish.  Really drinkable, as drinkable as any IPA you'd have that would be sub 7% and this IPL is 10%!  Great beer all around, Jack's Abby does it again."

"This is a 10%pint- drink slowly!"
"Incredible on draft and still a great bottle...I am saving one to see how it ages...happiness with just a bit of sweet with a smooth & crisp finish ... Not hot at all for 10%er"
"O - This is pretty nice.  Jack's Abby continually puts out great, hop intense beers that are quite enjoyable.  Not much differentiation between this and some other JA's offerings, but good, nonetheless."

"O - zounds this is a quality beverage. Super fresh and really enjoyable. Cheers."
""
"Tastes fantastically balanced and smooth, but also a little boring.  Resinous pine and fruit hop nodes reign throughout, but there's no variation, nothing huge.  That's great normally, but with a 10+ abv brew it's a little but of a letdown."

"Pours a clear golden color, with a 1 finger head.  Amazing, smooth, high citrus nose beer that finishes with an IPA bite.  It's a sneaky 10% pour as it doesn't feel like such a high alcohol brew.  Definitely a beer that has jumped onto my favorite list."

"I couldn't drink it everyday, I'm not even sure if I should finish the mini-growler, but wow. Alcohol may be too hidden, it's so fresh, so clean. Citrus, pine. Head and lacing that set the new standard for 10% and above. Prometheus calls JA up for gift giving advice."
""
"Overall pretty nice, still like kiwi rising and original mass rising better but this is quite enjoyable."
"Huge hop character.Very tropical at first but it gets more piney the longer it sits and warms. Anyone who likes jacks abby needs to try this lager, it is one of (if not) my favorite beers from them"
""
"Dank pineapple greatness. For the ABV it is truly a well crafted brew. I rarely find hop bombs 10% or above to compete with those approaching 9%. This one is just great; super clean still with hops shining."

"O: Really nice triple IPL. Huge hop flavors but bitterness is not off the charts. I like it like this, teeth-chattering bitterness can detract from the flavors sometimes. Don't get me wrong, it's very bitter and very dry but the hop flavors are the priority here. Lagering has made this one exceptionally smooth for a 10% triple IPL. No IPA of this caliber even comes close to the smoothness and drinkability."

"Merry Christmas. Bottle. Pours a hazy but extremely illuminated orange color. Large, frothy, white head that slowly dies down and leaves a full gown of lacing. Big, honest nose that is right in line with the Jack' Abby family. The label says I'm dealing with Columbus, Chinook & Citra. The Citra is very noticeable, as is the grainy, kernel maltiness that is fairly dry. I also get their yeast strain pretty quickly. The flavor makes me sit straight up in my seat. The hoppiness is huge and almost stringent but somehow very agreeable and tropical tasting. Lots of melon, mango, peach and the citrus family. A very grainy, cereally, kernally flavor. Dry yeastiness. I am very impressed by this beer's lack of overall sweetness. Somehow maintains a complete dryness...maybe it's because it's a Lager? Alcohol is not surprisingly noticeable. The bitterness is also heavy and astringent. Well carbonated. Yet another hop-irradiated Lager from Jack's Abby. I am very impressed by gravity-to-sweetness ratio. They did it again? They did it again!"

"Nearly clear, the pale Amber color is deceivingly inviting to the timid and shy but please be warned that THOU SHALL NOT PASS... A breathalyzer after consuming a .5 liter bottle."

"Jack's Abby makes a number of fantastic hoppy lagers and TrIPL is another great one to add to their portfolio. Although this beer may not be ground breaking (it tastes very similar to an imperialized version of Hoponius Union), it is definitely worth seeking out."
"For being a triple this drinks light. Similar hop profile to kiwi rising but a bit more tropical."
""
""
"O: the cloudiness caught me by surprise; didn't really get any malt profile from either the aroma or the flavor; really good flavor; you would never guess that this is 10% ABV - dangerously smooth;"
""
""
"O - A very well-made hoppy, high-alcohol beer. Not boozy in the least, but the resiny hops lend it some gravitas. Great to split amongst friends around Christmas."

"On tap at NY Pizza. Pours a translucent orange color with an inch of frothy head. Good amount of lacing.The aroma is lots of citrus hops and tropical fruits. Orange, tangerine, guava, mango and a hint of peach. The taste is a lot like the aroma. Tangerine and guava but with some orange peel as well. A bit more floral than the aroma indicated. Light alcohol warmth, but I would never have guessed the abv is 10%. Finishes with the citrus hop bitterness and some warming alcohol. Light mouthfeel. Very drinkable. Overall, well made beer I would grab again."

"This is a top class imperial ipa (okay, ipl).  Pine and resin dominate the hop profile, with a bit of floral.  Many great beers with tons of hops often fall a little short with a medicinal off flavor on the finish, but TrIPL finishes super crisp.  There's a perfect amount of malt balance, and a body that encourages you to keep drinking."

"Overall: This is a tasty triple IPL. Really big hop attributes, and quite bitter - but a smooth drinker, with some nice flavor. Sits somewhere in between a session beer than a slow sipper. Tasty. (4.5)"
