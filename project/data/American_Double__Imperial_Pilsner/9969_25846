Thin carbonation and a warm malt finish round out this slightly average beer. I've got to say I'm unimpressed but happy to see Rahr moving in this direction. This beer is worth trying just to support your local brewery.","jbphoto88","Dec 13, 2011"

3.68,6.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a pilsner glass unknown freshness date. This pours a light golden color with a massive off white head. The smells are a little light but I get grassy hops with a little malt. The feel is medium to light. The taste is pretty good, I get a load of hop bitterness with a little malt, even though I think this is older, it seems to have more hop bite than other imperial pilsners I've had.","DavidST","Oct 28, 2011"

4,15.6,4,4,4,4,4,"O. Not bad at all. I've only had one imperial pilsner before (and I can't even remember which one), so I've got little to go on as far as the style is concerned, but I like this. It's got some character to it, and for a lager it bears more than a striking resemblance to an ale.","omnigrits","Beers"
3.76,8.7,4.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,"It is a clear burnt orange color with a thick and lofty tan colored head that spilled over the glass. The smell is sweet grain and alcohol with lemon and pine. The taste has sweet woody flavor with some pine and lemon, there is a lot of sweet malt. The beer is thick and soft and smooth, has a nice bitter bite that kicks in mid-swallow, there is a very dry finish. This is the first I have had of this style and was very impressed by Rahr.","JMad","0"
3.11,-10.1,4,3,3,3.5,3,"O: Can't say that I've ever had an Imperial Pilsner before, so it's hard to compare it, but I just didn't enjoy it. Tasted like a light pilsner they just upped the grain bill on and didn't really add any backbone to or anything interesting.","kerklein2","Jun 22, 2011"
3.5,1.2,4,4,3,4,3.5,"It pours light copper with a thick off-white creamy head. Doesn't look like a <anything> pilsner, but that's fine by me. Smell is caramel malt with rose-like hops coming on as the beer settles and the aromas have a chance to get going in the glass. Taste is assertive, with the hops and the malt vying for attention. The hops seem to be mostly about the bittering, not too much in the aroma, bringing out some leather-like tastes and...onion? Mouthfeel is tingly but slick, making me feel funny like when I climbed the rope in gym class. Overall good but the hops start building up in the aftertaste for me, kind of an accumulative effect. Those whose heads are hoppier than mine will enjoy this better. Still, an interesting brew and a great different take on a pilsner.","roblowther","Jun 21, 2011"
3.78,9.2,4.5,4,3.5,4.5,3.5,"O: This one didn't blow me away but it was a solid offering. I may go grab a few more bombers to enjoy over the summer but at around $9 a pop they aren't cheap.","GregSVT","Jun 13, 2011"
3.46,0,4,3,3.5,4,3.5,"Taste is interesting, and better than I envisioned after sniffing. Imperial pilsner would be one of my last guesses for this beer blind. Nutty, grainy and light toffee flavors lead the way with a floral hop bitterness on the finish. Alcohol helps dry things out as well. Yeast is not quite as boastful as an ale, but is assuredly more notable than most lagers. Interesting beer, has a decently enjoyable malt/hop interplay and the mouthfeel is nice and smooth. Dont think of this as an imperial pilsner and you'll probably enjoy the quaff.","twiggamortis420","Jun 10, 2011"
3.33,-3.8,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Sip after sip begins with a strong gain flavor along with some hop bitterness. This feels a little heavy and to me a bit sweet. The alc was hidden when I first started the bomber but once this warms some it gets more of a bite. One of the most enjoyable parts of this was the finish. I like the hop dryness and the light oil like coating on the tounge. This was fairly drinkable and a nice shot at the style.","lonestar4lunch","Jun 05, 2011"
2.68,-22.5,3.5,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,"The taste was not as hoppy as I had surmised from the nose. There is the grassy bitterness accompanied by some onion. To me, this beer tasted like plain potato chips, A LOT. There was also a lot of nuttiness to it that wasn't balanced that well with the hops. Mouthfeel was crazy dry, way too much, and tacky. Overall I think this was a fail in the To Thee series. I really enjoyed the BB winter warmer and the Snowmageddon was decent but this one didn't do it for me.","OakedCanuck","May 29, 2011"

3.33,-3.8,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"The beer pours an orange-amber color with a white head. The aroma is heavy on the bread with some grassy hops. The flavor is more of the same. I get some low bitterness from the grassy and earthy hops as well as some toffee and bready malt. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Not as good as the last two releases: Bourbon Barrel Winter Warmer and Snowmageddon.","Mora2000","Nov 16, 2005"
3.38,-2.3,4,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Opinion: I was really wanting to like this beer. I like the Rahr group, but I have been out of the loop for a couple years, so I don't know if Mark and Fritz are still calling the shots there. If so, this beer is falling short IMHO. At least the carbonation needs to be higher, but it really seems like there is something off with both the water and the mash schedule on this one. Not to mention the fact that the bittering is really high...which almost indicates a longer boil than intended or something. I will drink my whole glass, but I won't go back to this one unless I know that there was some major process change to improve the drinkability and to a lesser extent, the flavor.","SkeeterHawk","Oct 23, 2005"
3.33,-3.8,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Pours a clear amber color with a foamy light tan head that fades into a nice lace. Nose is a bit subdued but there are notes of spicy hops. There are notes of sweet honey malt in the taste, though this is overpowered by an earthy mineral quality as well as a very pronounced bitterness. The hops do not provide much in the way of fruity citrus or spicy flavors, but rather just a strong bitterness leading to a very dry finish. An interesting beer and certainly worth a try.","Morris729","Oct 10, 2005"

3.28,-5.2,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3,"Overall Impression: A very dry, very embittered beer. Overall I found it just a touch harsh between the bittering hops and a noticeable alcohol flavor. That said, it was well made, just not quite my personal cup of tea. I learned they only made 100 kegs, and there are only about 33 left. You might want to hurry if you want a sample, they werent sure they were going to make this one again.","HardTarget","Beers"
4,15.6,3,3,4.5,4,4.5,"Sampled at it's debut at the Fort Worth Flying Saucer, with the 1st Anniversary pilsner logo glass. No plans to bottle in the immediate future but that could change if it is well-received; it will probably be a fall annual, in any case.","assurbanipaul","0"
