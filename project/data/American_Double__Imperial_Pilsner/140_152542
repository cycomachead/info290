4.02,2.6,4.25,4,4,4,4,"Poured into a Sierra Nevada shaker pint. Pours a medium coppery amber with a nice one finger white head that continued to build well after the pour, with thick lacing. Aroma of light bready and biscuit malt, citrus, dank hops, light orange and tropical fruit. Flavor is sweet bready malt, light citrus, piney and dank hops, developing lightly estery mixed fruit into a slightly astringent, hoppy finish with light but nicely balanced herbal hop flavors and bitterness. Light to medium bodied with active carbonation. The aroma fooled my into thinking this would be similar to an IPA, but the flavor is much closer to a bready, biscuit pilsner or heavy lager, but with more interesting herbal hop character and a very nice, interesting fruit and malt body. Except for a slight astringency, the finish is very satisfying. A very nice example of an uncommon style that I'm enjoying whenever possible. Another great hoppy beer from Sierra.","LiquidAmber","Mar 05, 2015"

4.05,3.3,4.75,4,4,4,4,"Bottle. Pours a vivid, honey color. Like all Sierra Nevada beeyaz, this one sports a textbook cap of foam. I don't always like their beers but goddamn do they look the part. I was initially impressed by the nose. It's hoppy for sure, yet there is a very clean Pilsner malt. It actually smells like an amplified Pilsner. Ipso facto an Imperial Pilsner. Got it, now I'm on the right track. As I digress, I will say most of these hip, new hoppy Lagers/Pilsners seem to be IPAs with different strain of yeast. This one smells closer to its ancestry. It's still a Pils. The flavor keeps most of what I was yapping about right before. It's sweeter and loses a bit of its charisma but it's still tasty. Its not the tunnel-visioned hop bomb I was expecting. It's done well. The yeasty flavors manage to stay crisp despite the high ABV. It's plenty hoppy and it keeps its Pilsner malt profile. I was not expecting to like this. Sierra Nevada did a collaboration beer in their last Beer Camp package...Electric Ray was the name. It was the same style per se and the label art was nearly identical. I did not enjoy it. I expected a reincarnation of Electric Ray. This offering is far from it. I liked this a lot.","VelvetExtract","Feb 06, 2015"

The nose is nearly non-existent for me, though some minor notes of dank greens and leek struggle to push through at times.  The taste holds notes of pine, onion, light bread, and grass.  Though not completely offensive, I would almost rather these flavors be as meek as the smell...  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry finish.  Overall, I was not a fan of this hoppy lager at all.  Many aspects were muted, and then what sensory inputs (outputs?  hmm....) were there weren't all that pleasing to my organs.

The whole cone hops shine right on through. Nice and big citrus (grapefruit stands out), a bit of bitterness (55 IBUs), and it balances the bitterness with a nice malt sweetness.

An upfront hop taste, with a pleasent metallic taste that lingers. Lagering is what makes this beer. I'd describe this as a 1 1/2 IPA, the layering takes what I'd call a double IPA and makes an amazingly drinkable and refreshing beer full of flavor. At 7% ABV this had boy can be sneaky!

Hoppy Lager smells like hops, grains and some malts. Nothing bad so far.  The taste is bitter sweet, with a smooth aftertaste. You also pick up on some nice grains and malts at the end of this brew.  The mouthfeel is bold with flavor, with a clean smooth aftertaste. Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. did a nice job with this brew.  There is nothing overpowering in this brew, it has a nice balance to it. Overall I'm giving ,Beer Camp: Hoppy Lager (2015), a solid 4 out 5.  I would buy this brew this again.","nicholas2121","Jan 29, 2015"

I think part of this sub-par experience is there choice of hops for this beer...[internet search]...wait a second: Palisade, El dorado, Citra, Equinox...that couldn't necessarily be it, some of the greatest IPAs are made with Citra: Surly Abrasive, Psuedo Sue, Zombie Dust and probably Odell IPA and Laguinitas Sucks!  Although I'm not sure there is any reason to use palisade hops...Blah!...in anything!  Not familiar with Equinox though.  Had beers I've enjoyed that have ad El Dorado hops, so I think that's a good hop too.  ...warming up the beer...reminds me of Bauhaus Brewery, a brewery in Minnesota that makes similarly exceptional hoppyish lager beers.  ...warming up the beer still...I'm not getting the familiar smells and flavors I'm used to getting with the Citra hop.  After warming it up some the smell/flavor is pretty similar for me as my latter experience.    The other thing I do like is the ABV is at 7%...never would have guessed it after sampling it!  Still waiting for that lager that really brings home the name hoppy lager.  This is great for the lager realm but some day I want to be punched in the nose with American hop aroma and then subsequently the mouth with the same experience along with a clean taste the comes with a lager.    All in all Great Lager!  I lover the bitterness of it.  Wish it came through with that familiar American hop aroma/flavor...even though, I think, it as all American hops...but yet still reminds me--for some reason--of European pilsners/lagers...is it just me? or...","plsmanx","Jan 28, 2015"

3.99,1.8,4,4.25,3.75,4.25,4,"Picked up a couple of singles at the Sunoco Craft Beer Exchange. Glad to see that I could sample this before committing to the 12-pack I ran across at the grocery store the other day. After chilling at home for an hour I filled an IPA tulip with a measured pour. The honey golden lager's exceptional clarity highlights the lively carbonation, as soda-like bubbles stream to the surface. A frothy white layer of foam gives the impression of a styrofoam puck. Excellent quality lacing clings to the glass. Without the carbonation I might mistake this for apple juice from concentrate. There's a nice bright hoppy fragrance. Dank, with an earthy smell that obscures the typical pale lager aroma. Plenty of sweet tropical scents round out the complex and aromatic nose. The first sip yields a cracker-like malt flavor that compliments the citrus sweetness. Dry in the finish with mild bitterness of grapefruit pith and pine. Considerably sweeter than any other pale lager that comes to mind. The 7% ABV is well hidden by the lingering hop qualities, though a boozy breath develops by mid-beer. The mouthfeel is juicy, with zesty carbonation. By far the best IPL I've had to date. However, generally speaking, the style is simply not my cup of tea. The 2 styles that come together here are just not entirely compatible in my opinion. Not to the extent that they can ever rival the finest stand-alone lagers or IPA's anyhow. I'd take Sierra Nevada's Summer Lager or any number of their IPA's over this. That said, it's a super-hopped, big blonde lager. Exactly as advertised. And it's great!","JohnnyI","Jan 28, 2015"

It's got an earthiness to the nose and a bit of spice. There's touch of some kind of fruit rind, and a bit of musk.  On the nose the malt seems neutral and not very sweet. In the drink he malt is  crackery and soft.  The fruit flavor and hop bitter never comes up to IPA strength and the earhty softness of the beer keeps the palate from getting fatigued by either the alcohol or the hops.  The mouthfeel is creamy and medium.  It's darn good.  I like it because it's mild on the hops and they seem to blend in so well in this beer.  More breaddy than bitter in the finish without too much sweetness.

The crisp mouthfeel is there, but not quite as clean as I would like.  Drinks like a 5%er.  Quite easy to overdo it on this one.","Andrew041180","Jan 19, 2015"

The smell of the beer was very citric, evoking mostly grapefruit.  The taste was clear, crisp, and smooth, like a lager should be, but unlike a typical lager, there was a citric American hop presence mid palette onward.  The bitterness was not that strong up front, but as the beer lingered on the tongue, it became more and more apparent.  Very soft feel, and very well hidden alcohol made this a classy, yet approachable offering.  Sierra Nevada just keep up to their usual standards of excellence here.","rajendra82","Jan 18, 2015"

A bit different from some of their other hoppy beers, as there is a bit of a yeasty note there too. Smooth mid-palate of smooth malt. Bitter on the end. Nice lemony/citrusy flavors as well. Balanced, if a bit on the bitter side. Really clean and refreshing. Crisp. My only real complaint is the timing. This would be the definition of a  July/August lawnmower beer for me.

It's crisp and refreshing like a lager, but it has a hop bite of an IPA. It's well balanced with mainly floral hops and hints of pine and citrus hops all over a nice malt backbone.

Popping the topn I get a piney, citrusy waft of hops.  On the pour into the trusty SAPP that I believe is really only 14oz, I get a bright yellow brew with a yellow tinged big bubble head that stands strong and laces as is slowly recedes.  On the taste this brew has a balanced yet complex flavor that bounces between a dandelion bitterness and a tarty sweet maltiness.  As it states on the bottler it is indeed crispy throughout and leaves a slightly bitter sticky aftertaste leaving one yearning for more.  Another keeper from SNB that never fails to please.  Notice that they now brew in Mills River, NC, good to know as it makes SN even more accessible.","mooseisloose","Jan 10, 2015"

Pours slightly hazy bright golden color with a 1-2 finger dense and rocky off white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice dense soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of lemon, lime, grapefruit, orange zest, pineapple, melon, light pine, herbal, floral, grass, cracker, biscuit, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good complexity of bright citrus/tropical hops and moderate pale malt balance; with good strength. Taste of big lemon, lime, grapefruit, orange zest, pineapple, melon, light pine, herbal, floral, grass, cracker, biscuit, and floral/grassy earthiness. Fair amount of pine/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, lime, grapefruit, orange zest, pineapple, melon, light pine, cracker, biscuit, and herbal/floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Outstanding complexity and balance of bright citrus/tropical hops and moderate pale malt sweetness; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding imperial pilsner style. All around awesome complexity and balance of bright citrus/tropical hops and moderate pale malt sweetness; and very smooth and crisp to drink for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 09, 2015"

Very citrusy with hop taste and lager crispness coming thru at different times. Little high in the ABV dept but very well hidden. Will buy again.","Davidstan","Jan 07, 2015"

4.34,10.7,4,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.25,"Overall: A really good take on the India Pale Lager style. Big ripe and juicy mix of hops upfront with a very nice Pils malt backing.","MattyG85","Jan 06, 2015"
3.85,-1.8,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Re-factored Electric Ray, reduced abv and ibus... Pours a clear gold, one finger thick fluffy white head, spray of lace on the glass. Smell: spicy up front with grapefruit peel, semi-sweet and floral, lightly resinous and biscuity. No oomph. Taste: nectarine, juice orange, grapefruit peel, resinous and spicy into the finish. Fluffy feel midsip into a crisp spicy and nectarine peel finish. Pretty nice, not quite Electric Ray which was one of the better beer camp across america offerings.","babaracas","Beers"

3.58,-8.7,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and I thought it was a nice example of a Hoppy lager, I don't find it to be  a standout example of the style, but as far as Hoppy Lagers go it's pretty true to style and I thought the creamy aspect was a nice and slightly unique touch.  This beer had nice drinkability, it was smooth, fairly crisp, pretty creamy, not too filling and the taste did an ok job at holding my attention, I wouldn't have any trouble drinking a couple of these, especially in the summertime, but anymore than that and I know I would start to get bored with it.  What I like the most about this beer was the balance between the malts and the hops, it was just where I want it to be for a Hoppy Lager.  What I like the least about this beer was the hop profile, it was ok, but it started to wear on  me after a little while and I think they could make it a little more brighter and interesting.  I might buy this beer again when I'm in the mood for the style and i for sure wouldn't turn one down.  I would recommend it if you like the style, but I don't think it's a stand out example of the style.  All in all I liked this beer, but I didn't love it, I think with a little work on the hop profile this could be a very nice hoppy lager and i think they are mostly on the right track when it comes to the style.  It's not my favorite Sierra Nevada beer and I would say it's above average for the style.  Nice job guys, this was a solid Hoppy lager, keep up the solid work.","StoutHunter","Jan 04, 2015"
