4.24,10.4,4.5,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,"Poured a beautiful golden yellow with two fingers of pure white head. It looks like what a quintessential lager/pilsner beer should look like, like every picture in media one has ever seen. Excellent. Scents of pilsner malt sweetness, Bohemian hops and some very slight citrus. A nose very similar to many a pilsner, but with a unique, American twist. I like it. Flavors of grapefruit, grapefruit pith, citrus and crystal malt sweetness, but with a nice Bohemian hop character present as well. It balances the bitterness with the sweetness as a good pilsner should and is quite pleasant in it's taste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. A bit heavier than a normal pilsner, but fitting an American Imperial Pilsner. It was still quite easy to drink and was not unpleasant. Overall this was a unique, yet familiar beer. It had the hallmarks of the classic pilsner, but with the twist of American Craft. I greatly enjoyed it, and would go back to it again.","Auraan","Aug 23, 2013"

While Double Pilsner is a fine beer, it doesn't measure up to the Double IPA. My biggest problem is that the flavor is too buttery without the requisite peppy citrus hop punch I expected. Besides disguising it's ABV of 8.1% remarkably well, there really isn't anything special about this beer, which coupled with the price tag of $2.50 a bottle, is enough to keep me from picking up more of this in the foreseeable future.","Bockrules","Nov 22, 2011"

Nothing to write home about, and you are wondering if money was well spent. But the aroma is fantastic, the head lasts right to the bottom, and the flavor is top shelf.

3.95,2.9,4,4,4,3.5,4,"6/25/2011 - Summer is putting its foot in the door here in Colorado, sweating and heaving with awkward heat. The rest of us emulate summer, panting and clamoring for panaceas to the heat. It's time to put away the stouts and porters for good and find some lighter brews. Today's cooling agent is the O'Dell Double Pilsener. I've been slowly consuming my four-pack since May, but I'm finding it's just as much a Spring beer as it is a Summer beer. This dandelion yellow beer takes on a beautifully chilled haze, and beckons for the drinker to share in it's thermal alms. Before I indulge (desperately and greedily, with beads of sweat racing across my face) I take in the aroma - a fresh and balanced pilsener aroma with corn and fresh cashews, and not too dry. The taste is refreshing, cooling and engaging - it's a light flavor objectively, but a relatively intense pilsener, packed with flavor. O'Dell's Double Pilsener doesn't rely on alcohol to mask clumsy flavors. It's open and honest, packed with pilsener goodness, and perhaps the closest I'll come to the flavors of a fresh Pilsener Urquell. Roasted corn, dandelion petals, and a superbly executed bitterness all make the O'Dell Double Pilsener a beer worth splurging on, and a fine brew for a late summer afternoon where the winds are as lazy as us, the awkward guests to an burdensomely hot summer day.","GarrettB","Jun 25, 2011"

The aroma is of grass, and spicy noble hops with a nice malt backbone. It isn't the most complex aroma, but it is strong and what is there is very appealing to me. The taste is considerably maltier than the aroma. It is almost maibock like. There is a long grassy finish. There is also a present but well integrated alcohol note. The mouthfeel is full bodied with moderate carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is a great beer that I will surely drink again.","KarlHungus","Oct 13, 2010"

This doesn't have the drinkability and lightness that a normal strength Pilsner should have, in fact I wish that it did somehow; it would be nice if this was more like an equivalent of Pliny the Elder. While I wasn't expecting this to be quite as refreshing as a Pilsner, I was hoping for more expressive hops and a touch less malt than is here; like I said this strikes me more as a hoppy Helles Bock (there are even traditional German examples of this), than a Double Pilsner. Somehow a bit dissapointing in the end b/c of this last; this would likely hit the spot in the March time frame of the year, but is just a bit too sweet and chewy for me at this moment.","Gueuzedude","Oct 07, 2010"

Tastes like a malt liquor, albeit a good malt liquor with its light malt and boozy qualities. I am not picking out the hop flavor but the bitterness is very much apparent. The body is what I would expect in a double pilsner. Feels fairly large and chewy. Abundantly carbonated but not harsh. This beer was a big letdown.

High alcohol percentages, while they aren't necessarily required in those styles, don't take anything away from them either. However, with the lighter style of beers, especially the golden lager category, there's just nowhere for the alcohol to go. In most cases, especially in this one, this causes alcohol to overpower what otherwise might be a great beer - though there's no real way for you to know. Unfortunately in the case of O'Dell's Imperial Pilsner, this means the beer just isn't that enjoyable to drink.

4.21,9.6,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"D - A tasty brew that I can't decide if it has improved or worsened over time (since I last tasted one many months ago). Regardless, I recommended trying this out if you can. Its a very drinkable brew that hides its alcohol well and is interesting enough to keep you coming back.","gmcfarre","Jan 24, 2007"
4.27,11.2,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall impression: This is a highly drinkable beer - and it hides the alcohol suprisingly well. Dangerous! Nice balance of flavors, I would love to see this become a year round offering.","rowew","Dec 11, 2006"
3.25,-15.4,3.5,3.5,3,4,3,"I only had one of these and I'm not sure when I'll finish the rest of the sixer. For $11, I probably wouldn't buy any more. For a similar taste, I would probably go with something more ordinary like Pilsner Urquell or some Euro Lager. I had been looking around for this beer for a while. I was expecting a lot more from a double pilsner.","biking4beer","Nov 15, 2006"

3.93,2.3,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Thick mouthfeel and moderate carbonation. Nice beer, but not one I need to spent $11 on for a 6-pack.","mentor","Oct 15, 2006"
4,4.2,4,4,4,4,4,"Mouthfeel is reasonably full, medium bodied really. Light carbonation only lends a little crispness. Good drinkability but the sweetness is a bit much for me to have too many. Overall a solid beer for the style.","blitz134","Sep 06, 2006"
4.03,4.9,4.5,4,4,4,4,"On the palate... whoa, is this a Mai Bock? Big malt flavor, good Saaz spice, but then a malty flavored alcoholic hot whop finishes out the flavor. Finish is alcohol dominant with some lingering sweetness. I don't mind the latter charactersistics due to a preference for Maibocks, but those not preferring such a beer may want to pass on this offering from Odell.","yemenmocha","Aug 08, 2006"
4.38,14.1,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Another treat from Liquor Mart on my last stop. Lovely pour into the Duvel tulip glass. Clear, clean golden yellow body with a pillowy, dense creamy white head. Pungeant honey malt mixes with cantaloupe and fruity alcohol. Saazish hop aroma of sea air. Taste doesn't disappoint. Herbal, bitter hop edge up front that lasts throughout and intensifies in the finish. Sweet, smooth fruit and honey malt come through mid-palate providing balance. The hop flavor is perfect for the honey candy malt intensity. A winner. Medium-full bodied with a near-syrupy feel. It clings to the inside of the mouth. Reminds me of Rogue's. A big compliment!","alexgash","Jul 30, 2006"
4.13,7.6,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"The only changes I could say for sure is that I now find it more drinkable than in my first review and it seems to have a better nose. I don't know what happened but dang, the alcohol is *very* well hidden this time around and my new scoring will reflect that. Darn good stuff!!","Bitterbill","Jul 25, 2006"
4.06,5.7,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Odell has done a great job with this one. With this brew in their line-up, they continue to build their case as one of the most underrated breweries in North America.","benito","Jul 22, 2006"
4.42,15.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"What a shame this is a limited edition. This beer is crisp, easy to drink, quite good. It's also oddly refreshing, in spite of the high alcohol content. I'd highly recommend seeking this one out. Well worth the trouble.","jokelahoma","Jul 09, 2006"
4.31,12.2,5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Drinkability: Very drinkable beer but would limit intake because of the alcohol content. It's definitely not a lawnmower beer but it's an excellent example of what I envision a double Pilsner style would be.","TxTechBrewer","Jul 07, 2006"
