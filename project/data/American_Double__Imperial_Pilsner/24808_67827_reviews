"Hoppy but not overly so. Has a malty sweetness that balances well with the hops."

"Pours into a becker a clear rich copper/bronze with a fluffy full one finger white head atop that leaves two broken rings of lace as it settles.Wow great fresh hops aromas that really hit ya,grassy and herbal with some pineapple also being detected,just big and fresh,some sweet dough and booze is there as well.The hops hit up front on the palate with some grass and citrusy notes,the malt base is bigger in the flavors than aromas with some caramel and sweet dough being rather large,some more sweetness comes from sugary alcohol as well.Really liked this beer,just a great hop profile in the nose."

"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, no bottle dating. Pours lightly hazy bright orange color with a 1 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, light caramel, bread, pine, and floral/grassy earthiness. Very nice aromas with bright citrus/earthy hop notes with moderate malt sweetness; and good strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, pine, light caramel, biscuit, and floral/grassy earthiness. Fair amount of floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of big grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, pine, light caramel, biscuit, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity of bright citrus/floral hops with moderate bready malt sweetness; with a nice malt/bitterness balance and minimal cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Imperial Pilsner. All around nice complexity of bright hop and moderate bready malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"O- Well balanced and extremely drinkable. Clean crisp citrus flavors with a keen balancing malt backbone. I have never heard of this brewery before but I need to check them out a little more because this brew is something else. An IPA with a light feel. Freaking sweet!"

"Very good beer, although I fear that this one falls victim to the ""IPL syndrome"" that I've come to find with many beers of this style - the heavy hoppage of IPL's covers up the lager yeast flavors a bit too much, and you've gotta wonder, why not an IPA? I will say, though, that the lagering gives this beer a nice, refreshing, clean and crisp finish. Very good overall, and I'm glad that I picked up a sixer to share with friends."

"O - This beer is listed as an India Pale Lager. I think we need a new category here on BA. It was a nice variation of a lager. It is not a flavorful as an IPA, but this is quite a good lager. I have had it a couple times and is a nice change of pace."

"Interesting take on the IPA by lagering, making it an ""IPL"". A little heavy on the Cascade hops for my tastes (I know the tendency with American IPA is to be ""all grapefruit, all the time", but too me it makes a dynamic beer style very one dimensional). There is an ester note coming through, perhaps from the yeast strain, that gives an almost candy-like sweetness as well. Medium body with long lasting highly citrus hop oil aftertaste that has a drying effect on the palate."

"This growler is courtesy of a coworker who picked it up early this week. The growler was labeled as ""IPL", India Pale Lager. Very interesting. It pours a light bodied, bright bronze in color with a slight white lacing around the glass. The aromas are slightly hoppy, with a piney presence. It has the soft malt characteristics of a lager but the stickiness and pine resin of an IPA show through. It's interesting. It tastes of sticky, piny hops with a slight hoppy, yet this lager-esque bitterness. It's interesting. It drinks pretty light and is somewhat sessionable. It drinks fine and is an interesting hybrid. Overall it's a fine beer, yet a tweener and in between styles."
"Nice brew. Try it."
