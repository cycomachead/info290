3,-15.5,3,3,3,3,3,"Not a pils in my mind.  More like a doulbe IPA with the bitterness, heavy body and alcohol-ness.  Not a crisp refreshing light beer, but a heavy, in your face wallop.  Not bad, but not what I was expecting at all.","pajeff","Jan 08, 2015"

3.78,6.5,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"22 ounce bottle into lager glass; no bottle dating, but is a recent release. Pours slightly hazy deep golden color with a 1-2 finger dense and rocky off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice dense soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, light pine, cracker, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good complexity of bright citrus/floral hops and moderate pale malt balance; with solid strength. Taste of grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, floral, grass, cracker, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Good amount of pine/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, lemon/orange zest, pine, cracker, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and robustness of bright citrus/floral hops and moderate pale malt sweetness; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and fairly crisp/sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good imperial pilsner style. All around good complexity and balance of bright citrus/floral hops and moderate pale malt sweetness; and very smooth and crisp to drink for the ABV. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 05, 2015"

3.74,5.4,,,,,,"Poured from a bottle into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a medium golden amber with a thin white head that dissipates to light patchy foam. Aroma of bready, mildy caramal malt and light grassy hops; does smell like a classic Saaz hopped pilsner, but milder. Flavor follows aroma closely, with bready and biscuit malt, grassy Saaz style hops ane a light fruitiness and spiciness. Finishes with moderate grassy hops and residual crackery biscuit. Medium bodied with slight creaminess. A good domestic take on a double pilsner. The flavor profile is subdued, but right on style. The lighter malt flavor does a good job of presenting the European hops, which are somewhat mellower than West Coast style hopping. The hop and malt flavors are well balanced and taste good. The alcohol is amazingly well covered, I'd guess this was half the actual ABV. Does not push the envelope, but well made a pleasure to drink. Better than expected from a movie tie-in beer.","LiquidAmber","Beers"
