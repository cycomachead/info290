"Overall: 8.8%? Typo, surely? I could drink bottles of this stuff: it's so easy! Anyway, on looking at the other reviews, I suspect the beer has been altered somewhat in the last few years. Mine was a 2012 bottle. The beer was very simple indeed, but I enjoyed it."
"Two finger head with nice lacing on a cloudy golden with mustard hues body. Nice lacing. Aroma is very earthy with wet sock hop, floral and grassy notes. The taste is fairly boozy and bitter overall. The grass and floral notes are very overwhelming at first and take time getting used too. This may have something to do with the age of this one. Light to medium bodied and moderate to high carbonation. This one is both interesting and a little tough to drink. It is certainly unique. This one may be very different as it is an older keg."

"A decent beer for sure. Though not a lot of character, and overly simplistic for my tastes. You can do a lot worse, but nothing that really sticks out for me."
"m/d-After the initial taste there is a slight sweetness that fades from the mouth rather quickly. Decent drinker, but there better options."
"Drinkability is good. There are no unpleasant aftertastes. The high ABV is well hidden. Not a beer I would typically choose but I'm glad I had the opportunity to try it."
"It went down very well but I won't be buying any more of this one for sure."
"D= Very good goes down nice and taste real good. had no problem!"
"This was a very nice option on a beautiful day on the Oregon coast."
"It pours a rather typical clear straw-yellow, but gets a point for having a rather thick, fluffy white head. Aroma is strong and malty with a firm fruity overtone, mainly apple and lemon. Flavor is a bit bland and has an unpleasing metallic taste to it, but is still palatable. Texture is edgy and just a little tingly, nothing to write home about. This is the only Rogue beer I have ever tried that disappointed, but I will finish this bottle."
"Had this on tap at The Stable. Nice golden color with a fair amount of head. This really had a yeasty and grainy smell to it yet the taste was crisp. Very breadlike. Nice body and almost no aftertaste, which is surprising for a high ABV beer. While not y favorite style this is pretty good."
"Poured a crisp very see-thru light golden color, 1 1/2 finger head that stuck around for a little bit. very active carbonation. Smelled of grain, yeast. Tasted very refreshing, very easy to drink. Medium bodied but fairly big for a pilsner. I would love to find this again."
"Drinkability is good, I really love this beer. It's really different then most IPs, but I did that it's so p-town style...way better then Morimoto's."
