"10% imperial pale lager that pours a slightly hazed orange gold color.  The aroma is of fresh citrus zest, green tea, apricot and honey.  The flavor has more of the intense orange citrus note, substantial bready malt, but bitter.  Alcohol is well hidden for a 10% imperial pils, but it's still there.  Hop flavor is plentiful with semi tropical notes and some herbal elements.  Full bodied, carbonated lager that is damn smooth.  Another winner from Mikkeller, solid hoppy strong lager."

"O - I have never had a bad beer from Mikkeller, but I have had some overrated ones. This beer is by no means overrated; in fact, I dare say this is way better than some reviewers make it sound like. Great drinkable IIPA brewed with lager yeast."

"330 ml bottle poured into a tulip glass. A cloudy yellow amber color with a reasonable amount of dingy white head and a rather sweet and rich aroma, concentrated pale malts and candied citrus/tropical fruits, orange, papaya, and peach with honey-like and brown sugar overtones and something else a bit more funky, almost like yeasty vitamin tablet. Does feature a power hop flavor that to my reckoning keeps up with that found in Hop Burn High, if anything the lemon, orange, red berry, salad green and camphorous spice flavors are even cleaner here despite the malts contributing ample sweetness. Rather boozy and here and there I get a solvent-like blast, although this does not overly detract from a lingering citrus peel (lime) and spicy hop finish. I do find myself enjoying the aroma more than the flavor per se. Rather thick bodied and carbonation is right where it needs to be, cutting the sweetness to some extent and lifting up the hops. I rather enjoyed this Hop Burn duo. Bold, spicy, rich, boozy beers well worth experiencing at least once."
"NOTE: this beer is in no way a pilsner. It's an IPA brewed with lager yeast, and has more in common with those. It is not an imperialized pilsner."
"A veritable hop tsunami that does a number on your senses. Looks great, while the aroma offers a fantastic smorgasbord of hop notes backed up by malt. The flavour is equally intense but with a leafy, vegetal edge to the bitterness that detracts a little from the experience. Lovely body. A memorable brew, but not one I'd want to drink every day. It made me realise that it is possible to overdo the hops. Nonetheless, an impressive lager that is worth sampling if you really love lupulus."

"A- orange cloudy peachy. S- orange, peach, cream. T- malty, creamy, lemon, aggressive, orange (but not blatant orange). M- again, creamy, aggressive, the alcohol burn at the back of the tongue and then a hop presence leftover on the tongue. O-I'm really glad I finally got a Mikkeller. I was thinking of getting a coffee IPA the other day but I couldn't part with my precious $16. I recommend this one. It's a bit of a mess but one can't stop drinking it for how rewarding it is with flavors galore."

"Overall: a more aggressive than your typical IPL beer. Mix of crisp lager and DIPA with strong focus on bitterness. Still an interesting, drinkable and solid beer."
""

"O: Compared to the Imperial Pale Lagers (IPLs) I've had, this one tastes the most like an IPA and the only discernable difference is that it isn't as crisp."
""
""
""
"Overall - A typical oddball Mikkeller brew, this is an intense and unique beer. Much more aggressive than other takes on the ""IPL"" style that I've had, this emphasizes the bitterness and spiciness more than anything else, but the lager characteristics are enough to keep it drinkable. Not a sessioner by profile or ABV, but definitely different and overall solid."

"Overall, this is quite drinkable, with the hops giving it a good bitterness but without being overpowering. I was expecting something more overwhelming and while there is some good hop and alcohol burniness here, there is still some maltiness present. I would drink this again if it wasn't six dollars a bottle."
"Mikkeller Hop Burn Low ---3.5/5"
"D - Nice hoppy imperial pilsner. Nice hop profile and bitterness throughout."

"O: Not so obviously delicious as Hop Burn High, but subtler and more interesting. I like this series (duo?) a lot and would highly recommend the pair."
""
"Bottle: Poured a cloudy beige color lager with a large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of dry and citrusy hops is dominant with dry caramel malt base quite discreet. Taste is also dominated by herbal hops notes with quite dry notes and a medium citrusy finish. Body is quite full with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. The description is spot on with hops being the dominant flavour and honestly I could not have known that this was lager if it wasn’t for the label."

"Slightly darker orange, unfiltered with a finger or two of white head. Nose has some pungent citrus, big caramel malt character and a smidgen of pils malt. Slightly spicy hops, and a touch of alcohol. Taste has a load of sweet, caramelly malt. Bitter citrus hopping and slight pils malt. Bitter, spicy and drying finish. A little more alcohol. A big beer, perhaps more than I bargained for this eve - almost like an American style BW. Interesting nonetheless, and a style tick."
"Too much carbonation."
""
""
"I might sit on one of these and see how a few years treats it, as a young beer it already reminds me of a Barley wine and I see some aging potential with this one"
""
""
"One of the strangely more agreeable versions of the style, the grand uptick in hopitude perhaps distracting me from the normal alcohol heat problems that I normally seem so pissy about. Anyways, this is verily a DIPA, but without the big caramel sweetness, for which you apparently have to switch over to the Hop Burn High to experience. I have, and it's a somewhat more full-on affair, I have to say, but one which should take very little away from this particular incarnation, which has much to offer all on its own."
"O - this is a great example of a high octane IPA (obviously categorized wrong), the hop flavour mix is outstanding and it is dangerously drinkable"
""
"Peachy coloured body. The good bitterness, with complex hops and orange juicy citrus is up front and immediate. Malting pretty good too. Fuller mouthfeel. In your face like a double IPA. Very tasty, good drinkability for a high a.b.v. and it may not have been had it had more aggressive US hops. Recent cellar of Blue Monk."

"The beer pours a yellow color with a white head. The aroma is full of orange citrus hops, with some nice biscuit malt mixed in. The flavor is similar. The orange and grass notes from the hops add a low amount of bitterness, which is evened out by a nice biscuit malt character. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"On-tap. ½ pint glass. Orangish amber in color, foggy appearance. Yellowish white, rocky, well retention crown. Copious collars. Subtle caramel malt, resins, tropical fruits & grapefruit notes both in flavor & aromas. Sharp, but gentle, bitterness in the middle lingers into the finish. Oily, flavorful, creamy palate. Full body, extra-soft carbonation. Refreshing, delightful. ABV is not annoying at all."
"O: I'm not sure what all the fuss is about. Sure, this is a rather solid imperial pilsner, but compared to some others (Southern Tier's Krampus, Rogue's Morimoto, Mikkeller's Draft Bear), it is relatively nondescript. I mean the flavors don't really separate for any length of time and there seems to be little integration of malt and hop flavors. All in all, I think what I'm getting at is that there just isn't a ton of depth here. If you're a diehard hophead you'll likely enjoy this lager, but it's not really doing anything for me."

"Pale coppery gold liquid with three fingers of thick rocky foam that leaves copious lacing. Very attractive. Smells of pine cones and hay, crackers and slightly sweet. Taste is pungent pine resin, fresh cut grass, earthy spice, flaky biscuit, subtle sweetness. Medium body holds together well with a smooth, creamy mouthfeel. I really didn't know what to expect based on the label. A very nice double pilsner."
""
"O= This is a solid IPA from Mikk. The name is a little confusing so check the bottle on the lower right hand corner...the dial should be set to low. I would love to try the high after trying this one. Check it out it's a fun beer."

"Overall (4.5): This was one of the very few occasions that I’ve given something a five on the “taste” part of a review. This was awesome, just great, and I want some more. Really dug the mint character in the hop profile, too. Price and dating issues will prevent me from spending too much on Mikkeller, but knowing that the guy’s capable of this kind of stuff, I’m going to be making the leap a bit more often from now on. Highly recommended, if it’s likely to be fresh."
""
"The body is sticky and full with lingering flavors. Overall this is pretty tasty but seems more like a hoppy pale than a pilsner."
"Well done, good balance, and the 10% ABV do not show."

"Thumbs up! I'm glad I took the chance on this!"
