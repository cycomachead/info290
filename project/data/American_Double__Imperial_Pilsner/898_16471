Aroma indicates oxidation, but caramel malt comes through. Flavor is pleasantly malty, however tinny oxidation is hard to get over. Medium body, creamy texture, lower carbonation, semi-dry finish. Drank a quarter and then drain poured, but would definitely give a fresh one a shot.","SierraFlight","Feb 07, 2015"

Aroma not overwhelming nor overly defining of what's to come. It seems almost flat for lack of carbonation that I would expect other than the fact I'm getting this out of a bottle -- on tap could've been different. Mostly an average pils experience compared with others... There is a pleasant taste that really comes through mostly with the aftertaste, my palate feels "tricked" into thinking there was more than what it really was. I'm likely to share this with fellow consumers who tend away from hops or dark brews i.e. for whom a pilsener would be ideal. Possibly because I've such hops-affinity I feel getting an opinion from a regular adjunct-beer consumer would be interesting if they tried this beer. Nor did I notice the 7 ABV, since I'm usually kind of sensitive to the amp'd up alcohol content of select beers.","A_Frayed_Knot","Dec 07, 2013"

Pours lightly hazy golden amber color with a nice 1-2 finger dense off white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon zest, orange zest, pear, apple, bread, cracker malt, floral, herbal, and light peppery hops. Damn nice aromas with good strength and balance of malt/hop notes. Taste of lemon zest, pear, orange zest, bread, cracker malt, apple, floral, grass, and peppery hops. Good amount of floral citrus bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, pear, bread, cracker malt, apple, floral, grass, and peppery hops on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice flavor balance with good complexity; with a nice malt/hops flavors balance; and zero cloying flavors on the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy, smooth, and fairly crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice imperial Pilsner! Great balance of hop/malt flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 24, 2013"

This beer has a creamy mouth feel and a sweetness that is not a typical Pilsner flavor profile, and it brings bitter hops, sweet malt and a distinct alcohol note. It leaves a bitter hoppy finish. I don't think that Pilsner is as amenable to the "imperial" treatment as other styles (IPA, stout) and can come off overwrought, so I will tend away from this.","malloyca","Oct 06, 2012"

4.06,8.6,5,4,4,4,4,"Pours out to a brilliant orange golden, forming a tall peaking whipped meringue-like white head with amazing retention and beautiful lacing, owing to it's brisk carbonation. The aroma is nice and dry with floral hops, most likely Saaz sitting on a delicate pilsner malt background. Suggestion of tea biscuits and orange marmalade. Mouthfeel is spritely with a medium rich body. The taste is very nice...clean, with a well balanced bitterness that doesn't obscure the malt. Even though it is an "uber pils", it is a little sweeter than the style would suggest, but it's still quite a nice beer. Very well made.","Mitchster","Feb 06, 2012"

The malt is not nearly as dry and cracker like as most pils but for an imperial pils that is to be expected. Moderate body with softer carbonation, leans on the dry and bitter side. I'm not a big fan of the style as it doesn't make much sense to me as I see traditional pils to be delicate with fairly low abv. It is just not a style that needs to be "imperialed".

Medium to full-bodied, very round and dense in mouth feel without at the same time feeling soft. Presents all that ripe, juicy apricot, peach, cherry fruit as well as pink grapefruit, tangelo citrus, thin glaze of honey keeps you smiling and just wanting to uncritically throw more back.

Nice lacing. The aroma was a good blend of floral and citrus hops with pilsner malt and a generally dry, grainy character. The flavors were complex and impressive. At first there was a shot of sweet, caramel malt and toffee followed by the rich grainy character, followed by bready yeast and a bitter finish. Elements of fruit persist throughout and yet the character remains dry. The mouthfeel was smooth and the body rich and full though not heavy. Perfect carbonation too.

This is intriguing, maybe because it is my first of its kind. Hits the mouth with an almost gritty spice to it and finishes with a little bit of mineral astringency. A slick oil feeling. So... it tastes a little yeasty, pale malts, and again a strange hop presence that is oily/buttery and slightly citrusy... fairly light beer but much more interesting than most any pilsner I've had to date, maybe the best. ... best description I can give of this beer is - buttery.","joshwlt","Jun 30, 2008"

The taste is almost sweet with just a little bit of bitterness from the hops sneaking in at the end of the sip. The sweetness is like a pilsner, malty, buttery.

It's a smell that takes me back to my younger years of buying malt liquor (there it is again) 40's because they were more bang for the buck. The thing is though that while there is one day every summer where I go and visit my old friend Mickey Big Mouth I wasn't planning on today being that day. Maybe it's because of the higher alcohol content but the taste reminds me of malt liquor (3rd reference now) too more than it does of a proper pilsner. Metallic and too sweet like a corn syrup quality. It tastes like everything was overcooked turning the entire presentation into a flavor lacking mush.

The aroma has sweet fruity malts, some husky smells come through too right after the pour. The taste is very chewy, some hop bite in the finish, just a fruity pilsner that is interesting. The dryish, wheat crackishness of a pilsner is lingering in the background, but there are more interesting tastes presenting themselves. This is also much more medium bodied for style, slightly more bready, more chewy, more husky grain too. The aftertaste is very mild, the mouthfeel is about right for the style.

A little extra kick and body, but much smoother than many beers. Mouthfeel is very good, creamy yet effervescent. Drinkability is also surprisingly good.

It's got the nice pils aroma with a little saaz but just a lot more malt complexity going on; which I imagine the higher alcohol helps heighten. On the palate, again the toasty, slightly buttery malt and yeast profile come bursting through the tight threshhold of hops. It has a very big body but is able to still finish quite dry. Unlike other Uberpils, I think this one is still able to BE a pilsener, not just another DIPA. Though style is still blurred with this one, it is nonetheless a very drinkable beer. It lacks some footholds in certain areas, esp the hop character (I'm drinking it only 1 month before it's "purchase by" date).","dreadnatty08","Jun 12, 2007"

The aromas that are noticeable to me are toasted malts that also seem to give off a bready smell. Also noticeable are the hops that meld in nicely giving off an aroma that is not dominant but is a great accompaniment. The taste is very nice, has a smooth feel to it along with flavors of a lot of malt, yeast and hops. The malts seem to give the toasted tastes that where identified in the aroma while the yeast I think give it the bread like flavors. The hops give a nice juicy like flavor that seem to be more along the lines of citrus but not like the flavors from a cascade hop. The hop flavor while noticeable is not dominating the beer, just like in the aroma, I think it adds a lot to this beer. Some folks who love strong dominant hops might think that more would be warranted but I feel it is better this way as it adds to the whole experience.

Highly sweet upfront; a high-gravity pale malt flavor, follwed by assertive, cidery alcohol taste and finally pungent german hops. The hop flavor is more prominenet in the semi-dry aftertaste; bountiful spicy Saaz character and floral Hallertau flavor also impart a dryness that helps break-up the cloying sweetness of the malt. The medium body with a perculular "light-syrupy" texture is interesting, and the medium-level carbonation is very subtle and smooth, although fine and abundant. Finishes with some residual pale malt and apple ester but is well-balanced by voracious German hop biterness.

The taste is dominated by a malt base and just has a touch of grassy hops. It has a sweetness to it that isn't balanced enough by a bitterness as a pilsner should. There is a very strange taste that asserts itself, but I can't tell if it's an odd hop flavor or if it's coming from the malt. Either way it obstructs the pilsner taste that should be there.

The foretaste is sweet, very sweet. The sweetness has a pils malt flavor, and is balanced with a lot of hops. The beer has a heavy, almost syrupy feel to it, and could stand for a crisper finish.

It starts off bitter, then veers toward dextrin sweetness before moving back to bitter again. Throughout all this, the beer displays a spice profiile unlike other pilsners I've had.

It has fairly good visible carbonation and a 1 finger off-white head that slowly recedes and leaves lots of nice lacing. One bottle produced a head so dense you could poke at it and it would move - never seen a head that thick on a pilsner. It smells of citric and piney hops with notes of malts and perhaps a vinous quality. The taste is about the same with a decent bitterness, some fruitiness, and a medium body that is pretty smooth and leaves a medium finish. Pretty tasty, but I bet it tastes better when fresh.

The aroma was less cleanly hoppy than a regular Pilsner, and had hints of tropical fruits creeping in, which although attractive, dont normally belong in the style. The taste was sweet and minerally-dry with more than a hint of spicy noble hops. The mouthfeel was silky smooth, and flawless. The 7.5% alcohol was masterfully hidden. Hidden behind what, I cant tell. The only thing that slightly hindering high drinkability was the sweetness that got a little heavy handed. I am glad these are available here in Georgia now, as I can see going to this well quite often to quench my thirst.","rajendra82","Beers"
2.91,-22.2,3.5,2.5,3.5,3,2,"So, I just don't know. I probably would not get this again because while it was fairly good, it was dangerously much like malt liquor.

3.01,-19.5,3.5,2.5,3.5,3,2.5,"light yellow with a pumpkin-tinged crown.. lots of random sticky lacing and a patchy funk of wisps on the surface. bubbles struggle in the mix. smells of lager yeast and syrupy sweetness. not much in terms of hops or developed sugar. slight roasty character. hoppier in the mouth, with a dry finish and a unique counter-balance of sweet adjuncty base and green green botanicals. for 7.5%, this is a heavy ass beer disguised as something much lighter. with morimoto, i got more flavor and balance out of the beer and didn't mind its big gravity. here, i wish for a similarly flavored 'single' pils with a higher drinkability. decent, but not one i'd revisit again. this style needs an affordable, flawless example to continue to flourish.","goodbyeohio","Sep 13, 2005"

The nose was faintly malty, but there was a definite presence of hops. The mouthfeel was medium with a really interesting spiciness, like cloves, on the palate.

The taste of yeast/bread comes through as well. There is a very slight kick to remind you of the 7.5%abv.

4.47,19.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Although it may look just like a regular pils, looks can be deceiving! Clipper City's Uber Pils delivers a rich, strong, hoppy and drinkable lager! The nose is bright with citrusy (lemon rind), floral (dried rose petals), and spicy hops nestled down in a bed of sweet bready malt. It's surprisingly medium bodied (although it does lean towards being full); and it's superbly smooth and dextrinous across the palate with a very fine, natural carbonation that just lightly pricks the tongue. The flavor is even richer than the nose suggests, but it's not overdone in anyway. The doughy malt base is backed by a solid bitterness; and it's well-infused with floral, grassy, and spicy hop flavors. It's very well balanced, and perhaps even a bit too much so, as it finishes pretty much the same way it began. Hmmm...? The sweetish, bready malt slowly fades along with its beautiful hop flavors and bitterness, leaving us not with a bang but a whimper. Maybe another 5 to 10 BU's are warranted.... and then again, maybe not - this is one really drinkable strong lager, and perhaps its overall round softness is more important that a little bit more complexity. Either way, this one's a winner!","NeroFiddled","May 24, 2005"
4.3,15,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"I poured this tasty pils into a pils glass. Pours with a big, white, foamy head. Head dissipates after a few minutes leaving some nice lacing. Visually, the beer pours a pale golden yellow. As for smell, hops are up front with hints of fresh cut grass. What an incredibly smooth beer. Not over the top considering the avb of 7.5%. Hops and malt are well balanced making for an easy drinking beer, crisp and downright tasty and refreshing though it does leave your mouth a bit dry which makes me want to drink more of this beer. Overall, a very good imperial pils. Alcohol is well hidden which could make this beer a very dangerous session brew. Not quite as good at the Dominion Spring Brews but its not far behind. Go out and seek this one.","SwillBilly","May 09, 2005"
4.09,9.4,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Drinkability: I could easily make this a session beer. Definitely try this if you see it. After drinking this style it's going to be hard to go back to a pilsner.

4.68,25.1,5,4.5,4.5,5,5,"This beer has a great taste, it is slightly sweet alcohol laced with noble hops that compliment the nice pure malt flavors. It is so pleasent and subtle that each sip invites another. It stands up as a good beer even warm as a 32oz serving can get warm towards the bottom. The nose is staright ligth maltyness mingled with hops of fruityness and spice. Wonderful beer and not something to be past over when you see it.","Higravity","Apr 16, 2005"
4.28,14.4,4.5,4,4,4.5,5,"Light gold with fine-bubbled carbonation rising continuously. Huge white head is mostly creamy but some big bursts in there too. Clumps of foam cling to the glass. Smells leafy and spicy, with a little crushed aspirin (amarillos?!) also limey and mineral-like. Taste is again leafy spicy hops, minerals (a bit salty), and honey. Very tasty. The only things I would ask for is a little bit more flavor from the malt (more graininess perhaps) and skip the aspirin-like amarillo hops that bother me in the aroma and flavor. Starts medium-bodied and sweet, but quickly dries out and finishes wonderfully balanced but flavorful. Well-carbonated and alive. Hell yes, this is a nice beer. In fact, until going to review it, I had no idea that it was 7.5%. Look out, it is hidden!! This is a dangerous one. Very very good.","waughbrew","Apr 15, 2005"

Aroma is a bit of bready malt and more spicy floral hops. There is also a bit of candied tropical fruit citrus note in there. My wife said it smelled like candied oranges from 5 feet away. Taste is good. Spicy hops with enough malt backbone to keep it in balance. Does not seem as bone dry hoppy like the Dominion Spring brew. This one seems to have more floral and citrus notes. As noted earlier carbonation is ample, but not over the top. Alcohol is very well hidden. A very very drinkable beer that goes down exceptionally smooth. I would definately recommend this.

A sharp strong aroma of hops emanates from my glass; it is grassy, herbal, lemony, and slightly funky. The taste is soft and malty up front, but leads to a solid hop flavor and then to a bitter finish. I get notes of toasted biscuits, spicy-herbal hops, and hay all mixed together. This is a pretty good example of a Pilsner, and it is quite tasty on this warm Arizona evening.","Gueuzedude","Jul 15, 2004"

In the mouth this is much more full & rich than a pilsner hitting you with some butterscotch and sweet malts initially. Some gentle hopping with hints of citrus & an herbal/floral flavor.

Picked this one up after staring at it at my fave distributer for quite a while, then finally speaking to Larry who pours for Weeping Radish at some of the fests around here, who said when ya see it to grab it.

4.23,13.1,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Poured a crystal clear mix of gold and straw colors, with super carbonated dancing bubbles that lasted to the last sip in the glass. The head was thick and compact composed mostly of tiny tightly packed bubbles and after a semi-vigorous pour about 1 ½ inches high. It was off white/cream colored and the surface was sticky and sheet like. The head lasted to the last taste and was creamy on the tongue. There was light lace present, spotty in some places. The aroma was fairly light, crisp, fresh and at times on the sweet side, only down side was that at times hardly noticeable after it sat for some time. I nosed a mix of grassy, citrus and floral hops through out some malt and a bready yeast in the finish. The tastes were more pronounced and seemed to only blend and mellow as the temperature rose. Flavors of hops (spicy, floral, and citrus) all were very pronounced as well as fresh cut grass, along with those flavors, a light leafy presence was noticeable in the mid swallow and it finished with a sweet bread and yeasty taste as it finished. The aftertaste was mostly of dry hop leafs. Which gave it a semi dry finish that was left in the mouth. I would say that it was medium bodied. All and all a refreshing, clean beer that when first tried was a little on the dry side but as the temp. rose it mellowed and seemed to become less dry and more on the watery side. One thing I did notice was that the alcohol content of this beer was very sneaky, no presence in the taste, but will hit you after a few. Side note from the bottle and nice was that on the bottom there was a nice coating of yeast, probably not a beer that could be cellared for a long time, but I am sure it would improve more with a few months. A fine example of an American styled pilsner beer.","Jarod","May 12, 2004"

Appearance; Filtered vibrant golden tone white head leaves even lacing, nice. Aroma: Alcohol comes through with a hoppy zest of Saaz and more noble hops providing a grassy tone to it all blended with some semi-sweet pale malts to balance this one will bring up the hop burps. Taste: Mouthfeel: Medium light bodied a beefier than most pils even carbonation slightly sticky in texture.

The smell was fantastic -- crisp hoppy bite, abundant floral and citrus hops, piney, honey, malty.... a little bit of everything. The taste just floored me.... really nice true Pilsner character that gave way to super floral and citrusy hops, but not cloying sweetness or overly sweet in any way. This was very impressive. I have to say I bought a six, but I'm definitely going back for a case before it's all gone (no luck finding a keg of this I'm sure...) This is also very drinkable, one after the other --- that's the nice Pilser quality.
