Lightly filmy yellow to orange colored liquid, achieves a full translucent depth, few bubbles visible but they are large and move slowly. The nose retains that pretzel dough, crusty quality with salt and pepper notes, however, more raw herbaceous bite than might be expected, peat and earth, then dried orange and lemon peels, briefly passing peach and apple scents, stiff and penetrating, allows few moments to relax. Full-bodied with a plush and creamy mouth feel, the carbonation is sneaky in how it covers ground cheek to cheek to add further fluff. At first much sweeter than the nose might suggest, grapefruit and orange as much pulp as zest. Aided and abetted by pine sap then appears milk chocolate and some pressed flowers. Apple, peach, apricot fruit competent, still, gets successively drier towards the finish. Offers less yeast, dough, bread than in the nose, maybe it’s the dryness. Keeps the hoppy bite while avoiding bitterness. Just leaves you feeling it’s more of a DIPA than anything else.

Hoppy, bitter and assertive with decent doses of citrus, herbal and resins. Coarseness and astringency. Bone-dry, bitter finish with alcohol fumes on the breath.

Heavy white head forms atop the glass. Smell was very malty and bready. Taste was on the hoppy side for a pilsner. Also, this beer had a very clean and crisp taste, which I enjoyed. Mouthfeel was smooth and the drinkablility was easy. Surprised to see an abv of 9.5% on the bottle - dangerous; would never guess that. Highly drinkable and high in alcohol might be an interesting combination.","morebeergood","Dec 25, 2010"

Very hoppy nose for the style, smells like PNW hops, malts overwhelmed by hoppiness. Taste is tres hoppy, spicy with a bit of noble pine, a bit of sweet malts on back end but once again subsumed by hops. Mouthfeel is full, some effervescence. Very confusing beer, not close to style, alcohol quite prevalent, at this high ABV one is enough. Too be honest, I don't get a Pilsener taste as much as I do a Imperial Pale Ale like Lompoc C-Note. Worth a try for those BAs looking for uber-hoppy pilseners.","jdense","May 02, 2010"
3.02,-17.9,3,3.5,3,3,2.5,"My first foray into imperial pilsners, and most likely my last. Not that this was a bad beer-- it's simply that pilsners are brewed the way they are for a reason: they're light and refreshing. An imperial pilsner (this one, at least) is neither. It smells decent enough, with a bit of the lemony-orange that a regular pilsner has, but doesn't have much of a head. And it tastes decent enough, with a modicum of lemon and fizz, but not enough of either to really do the job of a pilsner. The 9.5% abv is not a huge presence; there's almost no warmth (thank goodness) and there's no scent of alcohol to speak of. The extra malt is nice, and the citrus from the extra hops is okay, but surprisingly enough there's not a lot of bite. In fact, I've had plenty of regular pilsners that packed more sting. I'll stick with those.","gfreed","Apr 24, 2010"

Considering a pils is a difficult style to brew and given the fact Port can squeeze 9.5% out of this beer, I'm really impressed. Coming from Port Brewing, I expected this to be an extreme beer and one that would be heavily hopped, as they seem to do on many of the beers, especially the IPA's which is why they have become one of my favorite craft brewers.

Taste is a mix between some some dry European hops with subtle floral notes and light astringency. Malt is dominated by grainy notes and doesn't really fits well with the beer. Body is full with limited filtration and carbonation is too low for style.

The finish is very hoppy and bitter but balanced by a pretty big sweetness. Medium-full body with a lightly mouth-coating texture and medium-intense carbonation.

Slight earthy grass notes are followed by a very astringent strong alcohol finish. I don't really know how you could call this a pilsner. It seems like they pitched some pilsner malt into some kind of hoppy alcohol juice. Way too hoppy and too much of an alcohol presence. The body is full with some of the above mentioned bready yeast but the ABV is not masked at all. This beer is kind of a sloppy mess. They just hopped up some ingredients and slapped the word imperial on there. Avoid this one.","corby112","Oct 06, 2009"

Smells hot, with lots of lager yeast, and some notes of stored apples and grain as well as some firm malt. Any hoppiness is pretty overwhelmed by the fruit and the heat from the alcohol. The taste is less hot, but still very fruity with nectarine and apple as well as quite a bit of bitter herbal hops. A little sweet up front and quite a lingering bitterness on the end. Quite bitter, and quite hot, and not all that balanced. The somewhat sweet, very ripe fruit up front doesn't really match with the very long, dry bitterness, which doesn't really match with the hot alcohol. Not my favorite from this brewery.","Georgiabeer","Sep 08, 2009"
