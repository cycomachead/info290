"On tap at Sugar Maple in Milwaukee. It’s dark in here, but this beer appears to be a nice amber color. Very sweet aroma. Lots and lots of malt. Good hop bite, but mostly sweet tasting from the grains. Interesting and good."

"O- Solid, tasty and a nice one to split with friends. Price isn't right, but if you like your big pilsners with a lot of hops, this is one you should consider buying."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Very nice Imperial Pils, that is not to be confused with an IPL. Those looking for hops should look at other offerings. This one will satisfy the malt lovers."
"Overall, a great example of the Imperial Pilsner and would drink again!"
""
""
"Very light mouth feel. I would say the lightest for a 7+ abv beer that I can ever remember having. Super refreshing beer that would be awesome on a hot day!"
""
"Overall, if this was in cans, I'd drink this mowing the grass. This is a perfect outside, mindless beer. It has lots of taste and can be complex if you concentrate on the flavors. It can also be as simple as a Busch light with tons more flavor. Thirst quenching and satisfying. Floyd's should put this in cans or six pack of bottles. I could drink this all night, but at 7.2%abv I'd be shit faced in no time."

"O - a fairly straight forward Pilsner with a little more alcohol and a bit less skunky that usual for a pilsner. Good beer for a hot dog and ball game; though not what I usually choose for a type of beer."
"The feel is appropriately bright and crisp in a light-medium body. It's semi-dry without getting course, staying clean."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Pilsners are typically not my style, but this was very good for what it was. I would definitely recommend trying it and especially if pilsners are up your alley."
""
""
""
""

"Mouthfeel is good, high carbonation and light feel is balanced out with some hoppy oils and bitterness that keeps this very drinkable but not to thin. There is a dry finish that I really enjoy also."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Thanks to Xthul for this awesome extra! Pours a clear golden orange with a huge, white, quickly dissipating head. OK lacing. Aroma of biscuity malts followed by grassy hop notes. Doughy malts hit the tongue first followed by earthy European hops. Finishes clean and dry with some lingering hop spiciness. Medium bodied and highly carbonated. Overall, a good interpretation of the pilsner style on steroids!"

"Three Floyds Evil Power ---4/5."

"O: Again clean, no flaws which I guess means for a pilsner it's well made but being billed as an imperial pilsner (particularly from FFF) I expected more flavor"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - It has the taste of a European pils on but beefed up. It has plenty of flavor but not the flavors that I find pleasing. If you are into this style you will probably like it."

"O-The balance is thrown off, not sure what the flavor is but it hurts the beer."

"i really love this style, compared to what regular pils beers are like they blow them outta the water. this, along with new glarus' and the sierra nevada beer camp imperial pils are my top 3. this one probably being at #1."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A bit hoppy for a pilsner and definitely thicker. I like the effort to make this imperial but a thicker / bigger pilsner doesn't necessarily work as well as it does for IPAs. If it had this flavor without being so thick, I think I'd like this a lot more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Lemon and shortbread flavors, smooth and full bodied though crisp and drinkable. Lightly bitter hops seem almost balanced in the mix. This is great, wish it was in six packs instead of overpriced bombers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"M: Light leading to medium. There is a little body there. Little thicker than regular pils."

"o: this is a style I usually enjoy and the flavor set here is a nice one, something of a nice malt liquor quality, good start to finish, drinkable; a quick buzz is a nice way to set the tone for a night in the dunes"
""
""
"D - I've come to appreciate lagers more since I first had this beer, and my upgrade in score reflects that palate shift; I'm not sure the beer has really changed since I first had this in 2011, although some of those reviews mention excessive sweetness, which certainly wasn't the case here. I prefer lower-ABV pilsners like Pony, but I sill had no problem splitting a bomber with Smyra."
""
""
""
"O - Not sure what to expect at this point and with the beer aged as long as it was, but I was quite happy with the results. Kind of like a baby barleywine of sorts Would have loved to have tried it fresh."
""
""
""
""
"O - it is not my favorite style, but i warmed up to this a bit as i got through the glass. my palate adjusted some and i was able to find some citrus and grain nuance that was covered up by the bitterness at first. it is a tough style it seems and this is a noble attempt. definitely worth a shot(but it IS an imperial pilsner)."
"This one held up pretty well. Maybe some of the pop had diminished but I was really digging the unexpected fruit character that emerged here as this warmed and the overall smoothness of this shocked me a bit as well. Solid stuff as usual from FFF."

"O: Very unique beer, unfortunately it falls a little flat. You take a pilsner which is generally very light and drinkable and then make it fairly heavy and malty. It's not offensive in any way, and honestly I kinda liked the way it smelled and tasted. It just overall doesn't work for me. Admirable effort though in making a unique beer."
"O - I enjoyed this one. Nice flavor profile, not too sweet. A touch more hop bitterness would be nice."

"O- not a bad beer, nice lacing but probably won't seek this one out again"
"O-average beer. Nothing too special or that I would have again"
"O - not that special for what it is. Definitely disappointing for three floyds."
"O- I guess maybe I had a higher expectations for this one. I found this one pretty boring."
"Overall this was on the maltier side for the style, but I thought it was still well done. Not necessarily one I’d itch to revisit, but it’s worth a shot."
"I like this had it at Dark Lord Day and was dissapointed. Now it seems to have mellowed out in the mouth and much more caramel and toffee sweetness is coming though in the middle and finish. Crackery in the middle finishing with the classic noble hop flavors. A bit spicey, a floral and earthy. Mouth is creamy and decadent and alcohol only shows slightly in the chest."
"O: Imperial pilsners can often been too sweet, but this had a nice balance to it."
"5/7/2011"
"O - Kind of disappointed in this beer. I like Lair of the Minotaur and this beer doesn't really come close to what their music is like if that's what they are going for. Needed more hop character to make the beer more pronounced and less of a light malt pilsner."
"Cool beer that was fun to drink. I'm glad I picked up two bottles of this @ DLD '11."
"Y'know, I kinda regretted not picking up a bottle of this at DLD, so I'm glad to have a chance to try some now. It pours a clear golden straw topped by a finger of light cream-white foam. The nose comprises grass, light flowers, and stone. The taste brings in more of the same, amping up both the flowers and the stone, and adding a hint of orange rind and some very light pineapple in the back. The body is a hefty-ish light, with a moderate carbonation and a pretty damn crisp finish. Overall, a nice pils, though kinda weak, especially for its classification and strength. Still, I could easily see downing a few pints o' this if given the chance."
"O- This beer is a nice clean lager with some good hops that are juicy but dry and a soft bitterness. There is a faint woody note in the bitterness as the beer opens up that adds some nice depth."
"O: interesting beer, a little hoppier than I expected but still very good. I would really like to try this one again."
"Overall, this is an interesting beer that I am grateful to have the opportunity to drink. Although the style isn't one I would consider overly appealing and the alcohol taste in this one keeps it from being very drinkable."
"O - Not real great, but most imperial pilsners are not. Pass."
"Overall: Not a bad beer, a bit heavy on the alcohol. The bitterness hits pretty hard in the finish. A solid offering."
"O - Overall a nice pilsner."
"Poured a clear golden yellow with a thin white head the sticks to the glass very well. Sweet grain, slight spicy and hop aroma, tastes of spicy yeast profile along with herbal hops and bready grain slight sulfur. Kinda thick on the tounge with a nice creamyness. Overall a good beer, well put together."
"o - Overall just a pretty average pilsner. Not sure if I just don't really appreciate the style or what, but it just seemed a bit bland to me. Not a beer I'd seek out again, and a rare miss for FFF. Probably my least favorite beer I've had from them so far."
"O: An above-average representation of a below-average style. Goes down the hatch easily and is reasonably interesting on its way down. "
"Was this beer brewed for the metal crowd, i.e. drinkers of Mickey's and Steel Reserve? I know, not all of them, but many of them. Anyways, not bad and if it wasn't for the price I bet you could all the metalheads to drink this brew."
"Overall, it's possible that the hops have faded in the month since I got this beer, because that's what it tastes like. Too bad I can't get a fresh one."
"O: This is an unimpressive beer for FFF. Imperial Pilsners can be so much more: hops and malts can take on beautiful and compex nuances. Too bad they were unable to make this happen."
"A participant brought a fresh growler of Evil Power from Three Floyds…The color is golden with thin white head. I do not smell much maybe a slight hint of hop/grain, taste is common to a golden ale,,,slightly hop, slight citrus. I taste hints of clove and bananna as well….not sure what's going on. Mouthfeel is decent...certainly can suck it down."
"Did not really enjoy this one."
"O: Better than other Pilsners, but still just sort of an average beer. Nothing popped or stood out for me on this one."
"Overall, this is a decent beer, but not worth $10 a bomber at all, and not a particularly good example of the style."
"SOLID, BUT NOT A MUST HAVE!"
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It boasts a slick, creamy feel instead of the typical pils crispness. I appreciate the attempt but just couldn't get into this brew no matter how much I wanted to. Imperial pils is a hard style to pull off and I think this example missed the mark. At $10 a bomber, I would not buy this again. I was thankful to have 2 other people help me finish the bottle."
"Overall -- I was really hoping for this to be a hoppy strong lager a la Southern Tier Krampus, but to no avail. Even as a fortified Pils, this is not a very strong effort. This beer shows once again that lagers are the Achilles' Heel of FFF."
"Lair of the Minatour should stick to heavy metal and FFF should go back to making better beer. Glad this was only a 5 oz pour, I had enough."
"O: worth $10 a bomber? Probably not. Cool label though."
"O: This is sort of a weaker beer from Three Floyds though it's definitely not 'average.' I truely love 3F but I'm not sure what they were going for in this beer, it seems confused in terms of flavor and style."
"Overall a nice Imperial Pils. I really enjoy this style but seemed to like the cleaner tasting Uinta beer ; Twisted Smile."
"O= Overall - enjoyed this beer and it is very drinkable I just don't see me seeking this one out that much it is a nice beer to have when enjoying a nice hot summer day Though!"
"O- For the ABV, this drinks pretty well. I feel that this beer is about on par for the style."
"I'm not much of a pilsner guy but this is impressive. Good flavor, very refreshing, and not to mention its from my favorite brewery. I'm sure my non beer geek friends would find this brew enjoyable but I doubt this will be around much longer. Would I buy this again? Doubtful as I'm an ale man, but if someone bought a round of this I'd drink it with a smile on my face."
"It tastes very sweet, overly sweet in my opinion, with a strangely thick body that was unexpected. I think this is one of those rare times that Three Floyds made a turd, this malt-heavy creation is too thick and sweet to be very drinkable. Evident alcohol too. No more please."
"Overall-- this isn't a beer that lives up to FFf standards. Most other breweries would get rave reviews for a 7.2% pils, but here, the flavors don't pop-- and it isn't even especially well-balanced. Only just a slight hint of bitterness to counteract the massive malt bill..."
"Thanks to funkyaudio for the beer! Poured from bomber into a tulip glass. Pours a deep dark golden pour, with a healthy bright white head, laces well throughout. Aromas are vibrant florals and lemons with pale malts, bread, and biscuits in addition to some lemon, pine, and florals that round out well. Bready and biscuits, that moves into some lemon and florals, grass, some sweetness. Soapy, touches of more lemon, with a light rind. Medium bodied beer and decent carbonation throughout. There was some bite which ultimately leads to the overall taste that went flat all of a sudden. A major disappointment for such a big hyped beer coming out of Dark Lord Day. Not one of my top 3F beer here..."
"o: I enjoyed this beer. Alcohol definitely sneaks up you. Thought the beer improved as it warmed up. And if there was a label rating this one would get a 5.0. Glad I had a chance to try this."
"Evil Power pours out with a nice golden color with solid white head and good lacing. Bread yeast and fruits on the nose, it smells appealing. It tastes like light hops and malts not overly grassy for a pilnser thankfully. Creamy mouthfeel and very good drinkability. this brew is relatively nice on all levels. I would probably drinkin it again."
"O- This beer was good and a little interesting because it is not really a 3 Floyds beer per say. The alcohol really showed as this beer warmed more and more. Flavor wise I thought it was good and blended well. As a one off I wish it had a little more aging potential."
"O: Smooth pils. Easy to drink more than one. I can see where some would want more of a hop presence but there's plenty of that out there already. I'm not going to be up nights worrying about being out of this brew but I'd pick up another one or two if I came across some."
"O: A fantastic beer with a small cast of flavors that hold hands and get along great together. Kudos to FFF for another delicious beer."
"Overall it is a decent beer. No real hints of the alcohol, but I'd be surprised if there were at less than 8%. I personally would not buy again. It really isn't that easy to drink, nor enjoyable as a sipper."
"O: Drinkable, though can't say I cared for it much. Sweet and alcoholic with not much in the way of hops or malt to round it out."
"this was good but not what i was expecting. most imperial pilsners are heavy on the hops however this was heavy on the malts. probably the most true imperial pilsner i have had however i prefer them with more hops to balance out the heavy malt."
"Pour yields a mostly-clear golden-colored brew with a thin (for the style) white head and not much lacing. Some spots as it goes down, after a few swirls. The nose carries a bit of light grain and a very slight touch of floral hops. A bit bready. The flavor is all too bready without a real ho component to back it up. It seems like it's a bit stale, which I would expect to be the case had I not just picked it up at the brewery. Body is far too thick with a strong bready component. Hops are tertiary; I'm not sure what's secondary. Adequate carbonation but I can't get past the excessive body and lack of bitterness or anything resembling crispness. Not a fan, not a fan at all."
"overall - enjoyed this beer but i do not see this beer being in the rotation mine or theirs"
"Only bad thing is Evil Power name is deceiving for this beer, after hearing the band Lair of Minotaur and reading that this was tribute to them I expected a beer that would hit you over the head with its IBU but was pleasantly surprised."
"I picked up two bottles of this at DLD right after grabbing my four bottles of DLD. I ended up opening both of them within the hour and sharing them with random BAs. It poured a thinner golden yellow in color with a sticky bright white head that laced my snifter. It smelled of sweet pale malts, bitter hops, honey, and lemons. I thought it was interesting. It tasted of sweet pale malts, light honey, and had a bitter lemony finish. It was well carbonated and drank well for the style. It was good, but I wouldn't say that it was My Antonia good. I meant to hold on to one of these for others to try but ended up opening my second bottle, only to talk football with a random BA for a half hour. Oh well, guess I'll have to go back to FFF."
"Had to give this almost 4s across the board, because I enjoyed it for a style I'm not especially fond of. Not hopped to hell, not crazy sweet, not boring in the end. Wouldn't seek it out, unless I was a big pils fan. Jinx-Proof made a return; but even if this did I think 1 was enough."
"O: I really enjoyed this beer; however, not sure I would want to spend $10 for another bomber of this. I think this is a great example of this style but IMO would rather see this bottled in a 6'er."
