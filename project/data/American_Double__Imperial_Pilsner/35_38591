4.17,2.7,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"This beer pours out as a traditional style pilsner with a yellow colored body. The head is what sets it apart from most pilsners. The retention on this is very good. The smell of the beer is super hoppy and very inviting. The taste is very hoppy as well and really makes this pilsner more enjoyable than just the normal grassy flavor that most have. This brew is more like an IPA in my opinion which really tastes great. The mouthfeel remains light and drinkable. Overall this brew is very good and I'm looking forward to having it again.","Knapp85","May 24, 2011"
4.08,0.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"This is a taste for hopheads, built into an imperial pilsner. Sam Adams doesn't make their ipa's usually with that much hops, strange they went big on this one, and I like the results. Quite bitter, but zesty, lemon citrus hop flavors driving the bitterness. Has a little bit of the lager yeast flavor that was complimented by the massive hop burst. Don't know if this is exclusively hallertau, but whatever proportion, it works nicely to create a strong ass beer worthy of spring early summer time.","Beerandraiderfan","Apr 26, 2011"

4,-1.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,3,"This beer pours a copper color with a slighty off color head. The smell is an intense noble hop character. The taste of this beer is extremely bitter.

3.75,-7.6,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Pours an orange-ish color with a light tan head. In the aroma, hallertau hops stand out with a nice dry malt. In the taste, dry hops, dry malt which is quite balanced, with a small hint of alcohol. A smooth and medium to big bodied mouthfeel, with a dry, small hop and small alcohol hint in the aftertaste. Big hops and a small alcohol hint, quite IPA like, but you can tell it is a pilsner. Good nonetheless.","OWSLEY069","Oct 27, 2010"
3.53,-13.1,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall, this probably should be slipped back into rotation at Boston Beer.

2.7,-33.5,4,4,2,3,2,"They should rename this imperial to Totalitatian, because this is a ""mother"" of a pilsner...totally overwhelms my palate with bitter pine and grapefruit hops, it best described as hopjuice.

3.74,-7.9,5,3.5,4,4,3,"Notes: This is a big, full hop bomb and I even sampled it a few months passed its freshness date.

A little bit of this goes a long way.","generallee","Sep 18, 2009"
4.2,3.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"I decided to buy another 4 pack of this today as I forgot to review it some months ago when I first had it. Poured a light and bright orange amber. Nice spicy hop aroma, but I remember it being a little more pronounced the first time. As far as the hops, the taste was more of the same...a little less intense than I remembered, but I did notice some malts this time. I don't remember that aspect. It's spicy and floral on the hops and slightly sweet on the malts. Mouthfeel is same as remembered with a very rich and creamy feel. I've never been a fan of pilsners, but I really like this...probably because it's stretching the style a bit.","alkemy","Sep 11, 2009"

4.37,7.6,4.5,5,4.5,4,3.5,"D - Hmm, this is an incredible big beer but I don't really know if I'd want more than one per sitting. That's a wallop. For the age it doesn't show it being ""old"". I'd love to try a fresh one and see how much more intense the experience is.","BeerFMAndy","Jul 09, 2009"
3.85,-5.2,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,3,"This came in a bottle. It had probably mellowed a little because it sat in my closet for a few months. The beer is a little cloudy somewhere between yellow gold and brown. More on the lighter side but not light like a typical pilsner. The smell is a little too malt/sweet scented. It tastes a lot like a double IPA except with more intense hops if you can beleive that. The sweetness in the scent doesn't come through too much in the taste. The beer has a decent aftertaste with citrus being the dominant flavor. The intense hop taste makes this beer not so drinkable. I couldn't really go past a single. Definitely worth a try.","bheilman","Jul 06, 2009"

4.2,3.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"What I will say for sure is that this is still a great beer, regardless of some age. Its golden-amber body was always a bit hazy, and it still has a creamy off-white head that holds well and leaves a wide ring of lace at the outset of the glass. The aroma is floral, spicy and gently grassy over a caramel-drizzled biscuit-like maltiness. The mouthfeel is medium-full and creamy smooth. The flavor follows the aroma, and the malt and hops balance well, with the hop flavors draping themselves over the velvety maltiness, and a solid bitterness anchoring the maltiness from within. Tasting this I thought, yes, that's the hoppiness of the Boston Lager, the Hallertau Mittelfrue. It's kind of spicy and zesty. Very nice.","NeroFiddled","Jun 25, 2009"
4.04,-0.5,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"I poured into a pint glass to a half inch of white head. I really like the smell. I can smell a nice blending of malt and hops. I taste the malts up front but the more I drink the more the hops come through. It has a thick body, just like my bitch. It is a very nice beer. I enjoyed it. I kind of wish I had the whole four pack. Oh well, there's more beer in the fridge.","buschbeer","Jun 18, 2009"
4.19,3.2,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,"I was really surprised by this beer. There have been a few offerings from Sam Adams that I have enjoyed, but this one is really special. Pours a standard golden color with a white head. The nose is where things get interesting, loads and loads of hops. The taste is great with tons of floral hop presence and a smooth crisp finish. Not a lot of overwhelming bitterness either, the malt sweetness balances the beer out nicely. I'd definitely recommend this beer to hop heads or anyone else interested in trying a pilsner of a different color.","tgdigital","Jun 17, 2009"
3.92,-3.4,3,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,"(D)- Despite its 8.1% abv, it is well balanced all around. A refreshing and different variation from your run of the mill IPA. The alcohol will sneak up on you if u have at least 2 of these. I think that the overall age helped this out alot. This is easily still good even after the suggested drink by month of January 2009.","sweemzander","Jun 13, 2009"
4.08,0.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"D-A very refined, well-balanced pilsner. Matter of fact, the best pilsner I've tasted thus far. If you're a hophead, this is an excellent choice. Just be forewarned, more than two of these monsters will turn your lips into flypaper!","jonballs","Jun 05, 2009"
3.69,-9.1,3.5,4.5,3.5,4,3,"Drinkability - Wow is this beer not for the non hophead, but I knew that coming in. I found this beer a little rough but that's more because of my tastes than the beer's fault.","jwhawkins81","May 16, 2009"
4.1,1,4,4,4,4,4.5,"A 12 ounce bottle purchased at the Beer Stop for $2.50. Poured into a nonic pint glass and appears a hazed rich apricot color with about an inch of pillowy off white foam. Smells and tastes of sweet toasted grains, bread, piney hops, citrus such as orange lemon and grapefruit, followed by a healthy dose of caramelized ,alts to pull it all together. This pilsner falls somewhere between medium and full bodied with ample carbonation. Great drinkability even after factoring in the high ABV.","ClockworkOrange","May 13, 2009"
4.26,4.9,4.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Definitely a strong focus on the hops but nicely balanced with a chewey biscuity malt character that makes this very special. Pretty complex and well balanced. This is my first ""Imperial Pilsner"" So it's a bit difficult to call this one so naively... I'll keep it simple and say it surpassed my expectations with high complexity, enjoyable flavors, and a great mouthfeel. If this is a session beer then it is a short session at 8.1% abv. Don't take my word, check it out for yourself.","JVEyck309","May 10, 2009"

Plenty of hops come through in the aroma, particularly of the piney variety, but even the hop smell didn't prepare me for the size of the flavors to come. First sip is of a piney IPA with some citrus in the backend. The alcohol is noticeable, but only in combination with the hops within the grassy, intensely bitter finish that was a little unsettling.

However, this was the last of a four-pack, and I drank the other three fresh, so I can say that the hop flavor in this beer has diminished very little, if at all. That is a testament to the sheer amount of hop flavor in this beer. I would imagine that this beer could be aged for a decade and still have a substantial hop presence.

4.31,6.2,5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"T: Thicker side of medium body, almost creamy with steady carbonation and slight bite from hops. Strong malt background like the aroma and toward finish the hops take over and linger well into the finish. Primarily earthy, grassy hops, a little citrus. Slight alcohol warming sensation in finish as well. Nicely balanced for such a hoppy beer, GLBC Imperial Dortmunder reminds me a lot of this, but not as good as this (at least balance and body wise).","yourefragile","Dec 11, 2008"

The smell is purely hops, mainly pine hops, and a little honey/malty sweetness thrown in. The taste is interesting. The hops are burning, but there is an underlying malt sweetness. At first, this was basically like hop juice, but I quicly saw more complexity to it. The mouthfeel is medium thick, and a little oily. The finish is a citrusy/grapefruit hop flavor, astringent and long lasting. Interesting beer overall.","tgncc","Nov 10, 2008"
4.37,7.6,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Out of a bottle this beer was a cloudy, bright orange/gold color with lots of visible rising carbonation. The head was one finger's worth of yellow tinted foam that quickly settled into a tight cap and laced. The aroma was quite hoppy (grapefruit and orange peel in particular) and spicy as well with a background of wood and hints of peat smoke. The flavors were bold and, as described on the bottle, ""an intense hop experience."" The first flavor I got was the citric hoppiness and some bitter elements of orange and lemon peel/zest soon followed by the pine note, this was then tempered by some earthy malt which does provide just enough sweetness to balance it. Very bitter overall, as close to fresh hops flavor as I have found to date. The mouthfeel is smooth and easy to drink despite being full and rich. Though I would stipulate this beer best be enjoyed by hop-heads it truly is a great example of an unusual style and representative of the act that despite being a macro Sam Adams can brew like a micro.","thekevlarkid","Nov 10, 2008"

3.27,-19.5,3.5,4,3,3,3,"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: I really don't care if this one has higher alcohol in it. Any pils should have more carbonatino than this one does. Sure it has a bit of a heavier body, but in my opinion given the overall malt character and alcohol character this one should have more carbonation...in my opinion it would make it a bit easier to drink, its just that the alcohol is so forward. Perhaps higher abv would help to scrub that out...just some thoughts. This is a beer that I'll gladly finish, however, it isn't one that I'll readily pick up again. The only reason I bought it was becasue I've not tried it yet, and I had hoped it was one of the better Sam Adams offerings, and it is. Still though I'm not crazy about it. Its not a seasonal that I'll buy every year, its not DFH Punkin or Schlafly Pumpkin Ale.

An initial hit of sweet crystal malt that definitely reminds me of fresh baked bread, notes of lemon zest, orange juice, peppery spice, and spearmint hop flavors move through.

The hop are done right, and put to shame many well-crafted IPA's. The maltiness is a bit sweet, imparting a stickiness to the mouthfeel, but it's not too distracting. The medium-bodied brew is slightly syrupy, well-carbonated, and leaves behind an excellent finish of hop oil and pine sap. The alcohol is well-hidden, but adds just a kiss of warmth that spices up the palate at the outset.

This one didn't disappoint. Pours a light copper color, crystal clear, with a nice two finger white head on top that's fluffy and leaves good lacing as it descends. Nose is huge fruity hops - but very unique (maybe cause of the type?) - with a subtle candy malt aroma in the background. Takes a little heating up to really bring the aromas out, but they're solid. Taste is huge. Those unique hops come through hard right up front. Huge flowers in there, as well as a solid earthiness and mustiness. I don't get any alcohol out of this one, which is a feat, given the ABV (mine says 8.1%). Body is fairly thick, a little syrupy. Really a great beer, and totally original. I'm a big fan of this one. The hallertau hops give it a really unique aroma, unlike any other big hoppy beer I've ever had.

Sam Adams succeeds with this big hoppy pilsner that shows off their ability to compete with smaller, specialty brewers. If all pilsners were this good, my glasses would not have been dusty. This pilsner packs a ton of great hop flavor, although I'm fairly sure that my tongues is not refined enough to identify it as a pilsner without knowing beforehand. It's close to a heavily hopped IPA or DIPA for me. The hops have a flavor that is unlike anything that I've tried thus far. I don't necessarily prefer it to other heavily hopped beers but it's always wonderful to taste such a strong, true hop presence. The beer is a bit dark for a pilsner and has a stronger head than most. The hops are more bitter than American varieties and invoke a different palette of fruit notes. It's less citrus, but there's also a strong balancing malt presence that confuses my ability to taste. Half of the time I think tasting notes like this are nonsense but it does help me remember the taste when I review it. So, know I might be wrong about specific tastes, but I do find it enjoyable. The mouthfeel has a little mroe pucker than I'd like on the aftertaste. I had a Green Flash Le Freak earlier, so it's not so much a reaction to the hops as to some slightly runaway alcohol content. It's still a highly drinkable beer with a huge and delicious hop flavor.","popery","Oct 03, 2008"

This beer seems to be able to pull off the uncanny trick of being well-balanced while seemingly not having a big, sweet malt counterpart. Dont get me wrong, the malt sweetness is there with some bready and biscuity undertones, but this beer is all hops from beginning to end, with a nice dry, puckering bitterness all the way.

Overall taste is good and this beer is pretty darn smooth for 9%. I'm not sure if I'll revisit because drinkability and sessionability is a little low here... I should have bought the six of lowenbrau for 4 dollars less than this four pack... more drinkable and better bang for the long haul.

A large dose of hops wanders past your nose, it's an aroma I've never smelled in a beer before, it reminds me a lot of the aroma I get when I add hops to a homebrew during the boil. There's also a slight undertone of pale malt. They blend really well together. Flavor starts with a mellow hoppyiness which transitions to a slight tart bitterness. The malt body provides a nice base that holds up well to support the hoppyness while not getting too strong. A tad bit of alcohol is detectable towards the end.

I expected a harsher taste, like in Hop Devil, but it turned out to be very balanced and pleasant. The bitterness is really more sweet and tart than caustically hoppy. I think it could be a little more carbonated, but I'm surprised at the high alcohol content. I can't really taste it but it must be there.

Has a fresh smell to it. The taste starts off with a bitter rind blast. Though not known to be bitter, a large amount of this noble hop sure is bitter. A light & sweet malt presence is detected, not the traditional dry cracker like malt of a normal pilsner. I imagine you wouldn't want a cracker like malt with this type of hop presence. The feel is moderate with fairly tame carbonation, definitely finishes bitter. The harsh bitterness kills the drinkability for me. A hopped up brew that is quite different than its NW U.S. cousin. More on the spicy side which I believe leads to the harsh bitterness.","Gmann","Dec 07, 2007"

The nose is full of mostly of hops with some some sugary sweet malt. Biscuity malt is actually my first real flavor that I can pick out easily with heavy complex hop flavor trying to overpower the malt, but that never really happens. The taste is actually a bit on the sweet side but is still fairly balanced with the bitterness of the hops. The beer finishes slightly dry and doesn't coat very well.

Whereas IPAs generally use blends of different hops for a more complex product, I think this beer really showcases the single variety wonderfully and it's a treat to be able to see how the hops behave in this quantity. I think pilsner was an outstanding choice of style to do this with, especially given the use of Hallertau in traditional German pilsners. It was a little cloudy, thick and rich for a pilsner but the end product is a solid offering and I'm not one to fuss over style.

Still, the hops are pretty tasty, I'm just wish there was more pilsner in there.","tempest","Nov 04, 2007"

Nice buttery caramel malt base for a biting, bitter, spicy hop bill. Resiny hops ends with a big piny wash over some lemon character at the beginning. Spicy pepper ends strong and with the pine extends well into the finish.

Although a full bodied beer, no doubt, very unbalanced. Hops are twingy and not smooth and they explode without warning.

So it pours a great looking amber with a nice hazy and cloudiness about it. Lots of carbonation coming off the bottom of the glass made it very apparent this was a lively one. A great three inches or more of sticky lace formed on the top and took its sweet old time in settling down. Finally after several minutes it went down to a nice layer about a half inch thick with ample side glass lace around it. Smell was deep floral hops with a more then evident malty and grain back. Nice pine aroma blended in very well with a touch of sweetness. The flavor was more akin to a big IPA then a pilsner. A very full flavor it had a lot of the appeal of an IIPA and this made it go down very smooth. A nice crisp flavor blended in with the smooth mouth feel. Lots of bitter floral hops dominated this but there was also nice underlying musky bread like grain that made up the backbone of it. Overall this was a fantastic brew. I would dare to say that that this is an excellent creation from Sam Adams and the best I have seen come out of them. It had superb drinkabilty and a light body but intense flavor. Definitely worthy of a spot in the fridge on most days, this was complex, but yet simple. A very solid offering for any hop lover.

The drinkability part is obvious because this is a sipping beer. On the mouthfeel, however, I notice that IP's and IPA's tend to tingle a bit too much on my tongue. It's a little wierd to describe. Maybe it's the high IBU's from all those hops, or perhaps the alpha acid. They just don't seem to go down like a smooth porter.","Upgrayedd","Oct 30, 2007"

The thick gold came with several inches of cream-colored foam, which took some time to dissipate to a lacing. The aroma was hops, hops, and more hops. As it says on the bottle, they used a near reckless amount of hops. And that's easily detectable. The flavor had a light malt start, which quickly took a back seat to the hops. It finished with that pilsner-snap, letting it known this was brewed with lager yeast. The hop bitterness wasn't overly strong, actually well balanced. Surprising, considering how much the flavor of hops shines through, without being so bitter. It had a thick feel to it, almost creamy. The high alcohol content was also notable. This beer was a good one, but you shouldn't have too much of a good thing. I couldn't see myself drinking many more of these, but I'm glad I took the chance to try it just once.","Jp7010","Oct 30, 2007"

Aroma contains deep complex layers of herbal grassy hop bursts with mild skunk edged pungency. To balance out the intense hop experience comes pale biscuit malt sweetness with some hot alcohol action tickling the ol' nose hairs, a mild air of sweet honey character as well. Flavor offers up a barrage of Hallertau hoppiness with strong colossal hop bitterness over a delicate light biscuit malt character mild bready yeast notes too boot. Hop heavy in your face with the hops herbal grassy pungent citrus peels galore and a touch of that skunk flow. What a beer to really understand what Hallertau hops are all about, definitely tastes good to have raw hops on the tongue. Mouthfeel is full bodied with hop oils giving it the lusciousness that I'm sensing on my palate carbonation carries everything well, raw hop attack bites the tongue and finishes dry with alcohol and bitter hops left in the finish. Drinkability is great if you like the hops, because I feel like I could use about a case of this stuff just so I can fall in the hop pile every once in awhile, single hopped anything is usually great but this brew is world class.","WVbeergeek","Oct 29, 2007"

It's really nice to have the grassy bitterness just sit on the outside of the tongue on the finish and then get that familiar pils tang after feeling this thing slide right down. Very well done.

The smell is nicely balanced between a slightly waxy graininess, a spicy/earthy hoppiness, and a bit of pilsner tang. The flavor is slightly grainy and waxy, and has a nice dry malt base.

The smell of hops pillow out as soon as you pop the top and as the head melts away, the smell continues to blow that hop scent in your face. Taste.... oh the taste... Great citrus hop punch to the back of the throat. It stays with you through the entire swallow and stays on your tongue long enough to make you crave another sip. Drinkability is exceptional.

Tons of billowy head is formed; but it seems to be missing the hop particles I remember in the last one. The aroma is strong in hops, of course noble varieties, but it doesn't have the depth I would expect from fresh hop use. Very little maltiness is detected, mostly just good floral, grassy and a touch of citrus in the nose. On the palate, things open up quite a bit; I get several dimensions from the hops, but I feel there's still a freshness that's lacking. I want to like this a lot, but either I've tasted better beers since the first SA Impy Pils, or this one is just simply not living up to the previous.

This is my first Imperial Pilsner so didn't know what to expect really other than the hops. Reminds me of Double India Pale Ale but not as oily.

The beer is medium to full bodied, cloudy, orangish yellow, with a nice frothy white head. The smell is all about the hops and yeast. The taste is very good. You'll get your nice piney hops, then some sweeter hop flavors, almost bordering on candy like in their texture, and it winds up with a nice aftertaste that is not all too bitter. This is an interesting beer in all facets and one that barks out complexity. The mouthfeel is creamy and the high alcohol content is well masked over.

The flavor is up front, in your face, highly spicy hop flavor with moderate sweetness and a warm alcohol presence, especially at the swallow. The bitterness is medium-high and the beer finishes with a spicy hop flavor all over the mouth. Carbonation is moderate as was the body.

The hop character is quite robust, especially the bitterness. (There's got to be a TON of Hallertau hops in the beer!) The hops are very spicy towards the finish leading to good slam of bitterness.

Finally, after all the mediocre big pilsners I've tried, one that nails it. Citrusy hops, cracker-like malt, big as hell, and some nice alcohol warmth. Most of these turn out too sweet due to the malt (Terrapin All-American pils, DFH Golden Shower). Sam Adams'? Nails it. Crisp, fairly clean, medium bodied, and oh-so-drinkable.

At any rate, their scale must have been off when brewing this beer, because there is much more than a pound in this beer. It screams hops in such a way to make Stone and Dogfish wimper. It's all about the Haullertau hops from the removal of the lid, until way past the last sip. An agressive boquet of floral, grassy, piney notes fill the nose while the pilsner character struggles for attention. Flavors of sweet pilsner malt hit up front, but the hop flavor dominates the tast. Pleasantly bitter in the feel, with a hop / alcohol dryness that cannot be overlooked.

The ABV is well cloaked despite its size, so it comes off as sneaky, and it warrants some notice. Yet it drinks like a refreshing hoppy pilsner.

However, Hallertau hops are so distinctive and full of flavor, this beer is not your typical ""hop bomb"" you might find in a IPA, as Hallarteau hops are not overly bitter, but rather, full of character.

It's a bit harsh tasting after a while. There doesn't seem to be any balance to this beer at all. Mouthfeel is medium/full, and it's creamy and chewy. Drinkability is OK, but nothing special. Alcohol is well hidden. IMO, it doesn't resemble an imperial pilsner at all, it's more of an IPA style. Overall I think it's OK.

The sweet floral citrus like aroma is also wonderful, but the taste is overwhelmingly hopped.

The flavor was very hoppy and bitter, with a nice balance of sweetness from malt. Very bitter in the after-taste, very much like a strong IPA.

It seems balanced to some degree, but the aftertaste leaves such a bitter hop flavor in the mouth that it becomes difficult to taste anything else. Mouthfeel is full bodied, and has a bit of that imperial sweetness from the alcohol. My feeling on this one is the hell with balance. This is a serious hop head brew that is sure to please.

A pale cream colored three finger head slowly billows up, and shows good retention as it becomes rocky and slips down leaving patchy lacing. Pungent floral and spicy noble hop aromas with an unexpected citric/tangerine note and a solid Pils/Munich malt background aroma. The first sip is sweet with toasty Munich malt and biscuit notes. Sharp Pils taste comes on slow bringing with it a hint of alcohol, but zero ester. A robust german hop character develops in the aftertaste; more floral than spicy and certainly reminiscent of the rare Hallertauer Mittelfrueh varietal. The addition of an orange peel/tangerine taste seems very alien in a Pils but sits well with the rest of the malt and hop profile. The bitterness has the classic german low-cohumulone smoothness with plenty of hop flavor and the alcohol helping dry the tounge. The mouthfeel is somewhat heavy but dries so quickly there is no chance for cloying. A Fullish body and medium-light carbonation allow the hop oils and malt flavors the settle and marinate for a moment before fading away just enough to beg another sip. This is beer that takes full advantage of the possibility for high drinkibility within the style. Slight dextrin, mild residual toasted malt and lasting hop flavor linger in the finish, but the last few swigs could easily still be called ""clean"" for a Double Pils.Not quite the ""Intense Hop Experience"" that a hop-head like myself was hoping for, but nearly flawless in design and the best interpretation of the style I have tried to date.","PBRstreetgang","Sep 26, 2007"

Minimal malt notes, in the form of some sour-sweet pale and caramel malts, come through underneath the dominant hops. On the palate, big, spicy acidity from the hops comes through straight off. At the mid-palate some sweeter malt notes come in, but the hops remain the main attraction, sticking to all the parts of the mouth with their earthy, spicy bitterness.

As it is, it's certainly a pleasure, and I'll drink one about every night as long as the supply's around.","ElGordo","Sep 17, 2007"
4.77,17.5,4.5,5,4.75,4.5,4.75,"Pours a hazy peach nectar with wild carbonation that rises up to the thick and fluffy head. Leaves just a touch of lacing. Wow. Smells like sticking your head into a bucket load of hops or getting a whiff of a strong hop tea. Tons of hops in the nose with big earthy and herbal aromas. A malty sweetness and faint alcohol presence back up the hops. Hallertau takes the center stage of the flavor as well. All the intricate characteristics of this noble hop are magnified time 100 simply because there is so much of it used for this beer. Lots of fruitiness, flowers, perfume, tea, and general hop leafiness and spiciness are all up on the taste-buds. An assertive bitterness comes in the finish to wonderfully balance the well-stated malty sweetness. Although the alcohol is not pervasive in any way, it does show up a bit. While this adds a rounding complexity to everything, I kind of would have preferred this to be lower on the abv scale. It does something to the overall flavor slight so slightly hinders drinkability. Mouthfeel is full, a touch slick, and well carbonated. This goes beyond impressive.","goochpunch","Sep 17, 2007"

4.44,9.4,4,5,4.5,4,4,"Dark yellow almost orange with a head that lasted the whole way down. The first smell from the bottle is an amazing dose of hops. The second smell from the glass is just as glorious. Jim Koch is speaking the truth when he touts the amount of hops because the nose is amazing. Fruity, grassy, floral hops and then the taste is more hops and a nice malty backbone with some caramel flavor. This is unlike any pilsner I have ever had but the smell is so beautiful and the taste is delicious. This beer is hoppier than many IPAs I have had but doesnt have much bitterness to speak of which I believe is noted on the carton. This has completely upset what I thought I knew about Sam Adams. I have had several of their beers but nothing even comes close to this. The 8.8 ABV is undetectable to the taste at first but a little astringent on my tongue halfway through. Top notch and every bit as hoppy as claimed on the label, hopheads should love this. I will now proceed to give Sam Adams lineup a second look, well done.","ArrogantB","Sep 17, 2007"
4,-1.5,4,4,4,4,4,"This beer pours a hazy yellowish brown with a think foamy head that settled slowly and left a good lacing. There is a strong hop smell that is unmistakable. This beer has all the hop flavor you would ever want from an imperial pilsner. Sam Adams has taken this beer and done just what they set out to do, create an intense hop experience. There is the distinct hops taste with a spicy aftertaste that bites at your pallet. The hop is sweet and leaves a nice aftertaste. The feel is smooth and creamy and finishes very clean. If you like your hops heavy and strong I would recommend this beer. It has a great hops taste that is well balanced offering all the flavor of hops without the bitterness that you get from some intensely hopped beers.","eballard","Sep 16, 2007"
4.35,7.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"The hops are definitely noticeable upon entering the palate. They are bitter but not overly so for a hop head. More of the citrus noted in the aroma was present, although there is some lemon zest not specifically noted before. Sweet malt is noticeable in the back, but is muted by the blast of hops on the palate. Hops linger on the palate afterwards spicy and almost a slightly herbal taste is present. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a dry finsh. This is a great beer from BBC. Even at $10.49 for a four pack, I will pick this up again. This should become a yearly release.","hckyfn9999","Sep 16, 2007"

This has a lot of similarities to the one I tried in the bottle in 2005 and on the limited release kegs SA had in 2006 but there is slight change in appearance and a bit in flavor at least from what I remember. I paired this beer with some roasted salmon the fatty fish really goes well with this hoppy pilsner.","Franchise","Sep 15, 2007"

4.35,7.1,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"A definite improvement over the 2005 Harvest Imp. Pils from SA. This one's taste is much more balanced, not the raw medicinal hoppiness of the earlier version. Very nice job!","allengarvin","Sep 14, 2007"
4.2,3.4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"12oz bottle poured into a Sam Adams pint glass. Pours a hazy golden orange color with a nice sticky white head that leaves a lot of lacing all around the edges of the glass. The aroma is slightly buttery malt with a good dose of hallertau hops. The taste is smooth and creamy malt upfront with an explosion of hallertau hops in the finish. I knew this was going to be pretty hoppy, but I did not expect it to deliver the punch that it did. I am quite impressed with this offering from BBC. Overall, this is a highly recommended brew. I wish this was available year round, and not just as a special release.","cjgator3","Sep 13, 2007"
4,-1.5,4,4,4,4,4,"This starts off hoppy and then pretty much stays hoppy ...I'm going to be deaming of hops. It is bitter, but not ridiculous...well, close to ridiculous until it warms and degasses a bit. Earthy and grassy citrus-rind hop flavor dominates. Not very complex , but who cares. If you like this type of hop flavor and you don't care if it's balanced or not , then this is a good one to get. Actually reminds me of DeRanke XX Bitter , but more intense. Not much malt flavor , but there is an attempt at balance ...to make this more than just bubbly hop tea. Mouthfeel is medium to full...carbonation lively. This is a really nice one to sip slowly and picture fields of tall trellised hops...like in the SA commercials. I'm going to enjoy the rest of these one at a time.","Hautacam","Sep 13, 2007"
4.35,7.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"12oz brown bottle from Florian's in Auburn. Hazy amber-golden body with a half an inch of off-white head that sticks around and leaves a fair bit of lacing. Smells orangey, grapefruity, pithy, and somewhat spicy - the hops definitely dominate the aroma. Grapefruit and orange dominate with pith and spice in the background and just the slightest hint of malt in the background. Not as clean a finish as expected for a lager, with the hops lingering Medium to full in mouthfeel with only a moderate amount of carbonation. Becomes less harshly bitter as it finishes, becoming more sweet, but still maintaining the citrusy character. A pretty solid beer and a good one to have when in the mood for hops. Not as syruppy as a lot of these sort of ""big beers"" making for a drinkable and tasty beer. Far and away one of the best Samuel Adams beers I've ever had.","MrHurmateeowish","Sep 13, 2007"

4.02,-1,3.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Sampled at the ABF Night of the Lagers. I generally feel it's unfair to rate a beer based on less than a full serving, but I was too enthusiastic about this to take a pass. This is the best beer I've had from Sam Adams by far. It had a translucent apricot color and an intense, slightly grassy hop aroma. The taste is sweet, almost like corn bread, but citrusy too, with some pine and grassy notes thrown in. But lurking under the sweetness is an intense hop bitterness. The mouthfeel was surprisingly creamy. The bittersweet hoppy aftertaste reminded me of Pilsner Urquell on steroids. Recommended.","Flyer","Jun 17, 2007"
