"Tastes of honey and grass.  Heavier and richer than it looks at first.  Enough carbonation to balance it out."
""
""
""

"Light. Not bad. Very drinkable. Marathon beer"
"This beer has a clean white head and moderate lacing, it has a sweatness and alcoholic taste reminding me of a bock, Helles bock fits this verse Pilsner"
""
""
"A liitle too malty even though I know its a pils. Overall, nice color, decent mouthfeel"
"Purchase by December 2013. It's July of '14. Uh, oh. 12oz bottle poured into stange. Lovely auburn color with thin white head that quickly fades. No lacing. Aroma indicates oxidation, but caramel malt comes through. Flavor is pleasantly malty, however tinny oxidation is hard to get over. Medium body, creamy texture, lower carbonation, semi-dry finish. Drank a quarter and then drain poured, but would definitely give a fresh one a shot."

"I generally do not like Pilsner but this one has a strong malt taste with a subtle happy aftertaste."

"Overall: I wouldn't necessarily classify this as an imperial pils, more like a helles bock. Very nice nonetheless."
""
""
""
""
""
"Not sure what I expected from an uber pils, but this is too bitter for my liking, and the alcohol overwhelms. The floral hops are nice, but the esters detract."

"O: Meh. Every once in a while sipping this, I'll think ""hey, it's a decent brew", and then the next sip later, I go back to think ""meh, don't like this very much"". And there are even some sips where I consider a drainpour. Luckily, I toughed this one out - and I can safely say this is the only one I'll tough out."

"Poured a decent foam to start which dissipated quickly, yet lacing along the glass lingers a good while, which is mysterious. Aroma not overwhelming nor overly defining of what's to come. It seems almost flat for lack of carbonation that I would expect other than the fact I'm getting this out of a bottle -- on tap could've been different. Mostly an average pils experience compared with others... There is a pleasant taste that really comes through mostly with the aftertaste, my palate feels ""tricked"" into thinking there was more than what it really was. I'm likely to share this with fellow consumers who tend away from hops or dark brews i.e. for whom a pilsener would be ideal. Possibly because I've such hops-affinity I feel getting an opinion from a regular adjunct-beer consumer would be interesting if they tried this beer. Nor did I notice the 7 ABV, since I'm usually kind of sensitive to the amp'd up alcohol content of select beers."

"Bottle from beer of the month club. Pours deep clear orange with a small white head. Aroma is different. Some pale lager weirdness and a little bit of spiciness and fruit that I am not digging at all. Flavor is a bit fuller than a regular adjunct, dry corn and musty, dirty hay. Funky finish and a bit of light fruit. Light to medium mouthfeel and somewhat under-carbonated. Not my favorite, and I have yet to enjoy anything from Heavy Seas."

"o: very bready, but balanced.  I dig the hop profile. A session brew that will catch up to you. Not really a pills though,  richer malt profile, that's a good thing. Would pair well with food."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall this is a very enjoyable solid pils, a great picnic or ball game beer."
""
"I assume that this was some kind of horrible factory error because nobody else is complaining about it, but I am leaving this review here for anyone else who has this horrible experience."
""
""
""
"D: cant decide about this one. definitely a rich lager but I cant tell if there is a metallic off-flavor or some light dms going on here. might need some refining in the brewing process to clean this up, but has a good starting point."
""
""
""
"Delicious! A tasty and very drinkable pilsner with an almost buttery aftertaste. Crisp mouthfeel. I would call it the perfect after work beer if I wasn't shocked to find out it's 7% ABV! I would never have guessed - you don't taste it in the slightest. Impressive. Will definitely drink again."
""
""
""
"Notes: Solidly drinkable and can be enjoyed anytime of year. Cheers."

"O- Not that great, but not bad either. Most likely will never drink this again unless its free."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"T: Follows the smell. Very malty with a lot of cereal malt and grain throughout. A tiny hint of earthy hop resin before more grain and bready malt take over. Probably wouldn't have again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Fairly uninteresting; perhaps it will be better with food."
""

"O/D-I have not been happy with many Imperial Pils or beefed up Lagers (unless they're from Jack's Abby). This one doesn't really do it for me. The style is at its best when it is far less robust. All the crispness and cleanliness is lost with such a high gravity and such concentrated flavors."
""
"I poured this blah beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. This beer was just plain Jane. It was hoppy smelling and hoppy tasting. Way more than I like. To those that helped sample it they said it smelled like the ocean? The beer did pour a nice head I must admit but that was all that was nice. Beer also had a bit of a citrus note. I will not buy again."
""
""
""
"O: Well balanced beer and went down easy."
""

"Came with my beer of the month club pack. Glad I tried it... probably won't pick anymore up."

"12 ounce bottle into pilsener glass, best before Jan 2013. Pours lightly hazy golden amber color with a nice 1-2 finger dense off white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon zest, orange zest, pear, apple, bread, cracker malt, floral, herbal, and light peppery hops. Damn nice aromas with good strength and balance of malt/hop notes. Taste of lemon zest, pear, orange zest, bread, cracker malt, apple, floral, grass, and peppery hops. Good amount of floral citrus bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, pear, bread, cracker malt, apple, floral, grass, and peppery hops on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice flavor balance with good complexity; with a nice malt/hops flavors balance; and zero cloying flavors on the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy, smooth, and fairly crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice imperial Pilsner! Great balance of hop/malt flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

""
""
""

"O: Drinkable and pretty tasty. Very average example of this style and a little too on the hoppy side for a pilsner."
"The taste begins sweet and caramel-like but there is a kind of overripe fruitiness in there as well. The bitterness is mild at the end. Maybe a fresher bottle next time will result in a higher grade."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I wish the beer had a little less ABV - there are some notes of alcohol that I wish were more well hidden. I think this beer could have benefited from a little more hops but it was an enjoyable beer and paired very nicely with Spanish tapas."
""
""
"A crisp beer with plenty of fruit and fresh hop character. The alcohol can be a bit aggressive at times, but otherwise it's balanced pretty well. A bit of tart sourness also, makes for a really refreshing and surprisingly drinkable imperial pils. Could be a tad more integrated but has a ton of flavour and worth trying for the style."
""
""
""
"I recommend trying this beer out. This is probably a mildly polarizing beer."
"O: Solid Imperial Pilsner. A pleasure to drink this time of year."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"While this is definitely an ""uber-pils", it's not one I'd chase down again."
""
""
""
"I thought it was very pleasant and a bit surprising. I'm normally more of a PA or IPA drinker but this pilsner was quite a surprise. A friend of mine likened it to a ""light"" pale ale. I would drink it again, I think it would be great on a warm summer afternoon to have a couple of these. Unfortunately, those warm afternoons are gone for a few months..."
""
"O: This beer seems like it could use more hops and less alcohol in the taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The finish on this beer is a bit too dry for my liking"
""
""
""
""
"Poured from the bottle, Small Craft is a limpid amber showing steady streams of small, round bubbles. The aroma blends malt, yeast and some hops. This beer has a creamy mouth feel and a sweetness that is not a typical Pilsner flavor profile, and it brings bitter hops, sweet malt and a distinct alcohol note. It leaves a bitter hoppy finish. I don't think that Pilsner is as amenable to the ""imperial"" treatment as other styles (IPA, stout) and can come off overwrought, so I will tend away from this."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – It is a very tasty and soothing brew with some nice sweet bready flavors. One to sit back and enjoy."
""
""
""
""
"Note: Almost a year past the freshness date. The age didn't harm the brew at all."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. A bit too much residual sugar is in the finish which ruins the expected crispness I look for in this style. Regardless, it is not bad. Worth trying but not particularly something I would buy again."
"Overall: the bitterness is just right and this is a nicely flavorful pils."
""
""
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
""
"Poured a medium dark copper with a 2/3 inch foamy off-white head. LOTS of lacing left along the glass. Smell was bitter, crisp, slight hint of floral hops. Really nice. A delicious beer -- not too bitter, packs a slight punch, perfect amount of carbonation, and a solid finish. Good till the end. This goes down pretty easy, but with it's 7.25% ABV, be careful not to make it a ""session"" beer!"

"Overall, easy drinking brew that could be very good need some hop balance"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I liked it a lot. Refreshing and the amped up pils was appreciated; Uber pils is a good description."
""
""
""
""
""
"Not much carbonation in there for a pilsner."
""
"O - Nice beer, and the first double pils I have ever had. Tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall I thought it was mediocre for an imperial pils. I would have liked a more pronounced malt character. The hops are spot on, and the appearance is nice. I guess I just expected more. I won't be drinking another, because I've had regular craft pilsners with better flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours out to a brilliant orange golden, forming a tall peaking whipped meringue-like white head with amazing retention and beautiful lacing, owing to it's brisk carbonation. The aroma is nice and dry with floral hops, most likely Saaz sitting on a delicate pilsner malt background. Suggestion of tea biscuits and orange marmalade. Mouthfeel is spritely with a medium rich body. The taste is very nice...clean, with a well balanced bitterness that doesn't obscure the malt. Even though it is an ""uber pils", it is a little sweeter than the style would suggest, but it's still quite a nice beer. Very well made."

"One man's Double/Imperial pilsner is another's Helles Bock. There was really nothing about this lager that was pilsner-like. Rather, it tasted like a strong, somewhat coarse, pale bock. At least the bottle label does say in small print it is a bock. While I am certainly enjoying it, I am saddened that Sierra Nevada will no longer brew its Glissade Bock."
""
""
"This is a good beer. It's not as bold as some Imperial Pilsners, but it is more forward than your regular pilsner. I don't know that I'd seek this out, but I'd never turn it down."
""
"Pours a hazy golden orange with a nice white head. Good retention, and nice laceing. Very nice nose, with citrus hops, and bready malts in the mix. Body is medium with some carbonation. Taste is has an element of malty sweetness, but with a nice balance of hops. Spicy too. Crisp and refreshing, yet packs a punch.Nice!!"
"Wow thats good. Amazingly clean with well blended flavors. Crisp and refreshing. Nice sized body. No real malt sweetness but some biscuit like presence which is held together well with some grassy and herbal hops. Nice dry finish. Very very very good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This was passable, but I dig traditional pilsners much, much better."
""
""
""

"The APV is a little more than what is offered in MS. Therefore this pils packs a small punch. But you would not necessarily know it unless you observe the small print on the label. Not being drenched in an alcohol taste is very appealing to me."
""
"I prefer the lightness of ""blonde"" pilsners generally over the thicker more syrupy and spicy brews, so this fits my palette like a glove."
"O: An easy drinker to kick back with. A good pilsner with a bit of a kick."
""
""
""
"O - ABV doesn't come through at all, I might almost say this is more like a Pale Ale than Pilsner, but it's not hoppy enough for that, sort of a middle ground with higher ABV."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I'm not big on pilsners, but this is pretty good for one."
"12 ounce bottle, best before December 2011. Served in a pilsener glass, the beer pours a mostly clear dark gold color with about a half inch white head. The brew smells like toffee, bready malt, spicy hops and some butterscotch. The taste is mostly sweet, it tastes like bready and sweet malt, toffee and some floral and spicy hops. There's also a slight bitter finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a little bit coating with good carbonation. I think it's a solid overall brew, and if I was ever in the mood for this style of beer I'd certainly consider picking this up again."
"O: A very good beer. Flavors were well balanced and satisfying. I will buy again."
"The beer has a heavy feel to it...certainly not clean and crisp that you would think of when sampling a pilsner, but given that it is a double, it is much more chewy or full. Overall, despite the elevated ABV I think that I had at least 2 in short order. This is an excellent beer and it would be nice to see more and better beers in this style."
"Appearance is gold and typical of a Pils. Smell was good to average wth an over all good Mouth feel. Taste is good, we feel the finish falls short for this beer, tends to linger. Overall this is a good beer that is worth drinking and we would share this with fiends. Goes well with crackers and cheese.."
"O: An easy drinker to kick back with. A good pilsner with a bit of a kick."
"A sweeter American imperial lager with emphasis on the butterscotch notes and grain flavors. Not a bad beer by any means and something I may revisit or recommend to someone. Glad I tried it."
"88."
"O: Great beer to go with dinner or on a hot day. Drinkable, but with a nice ABV. A very nice offering."
"Beer is medium bodied, sweet up front, nice finish, moderately dry but heavy, mild bitterness. I actually really like this beer and have had it on several occasions. I was honestly shocked that I had not reviewed it previously. One of the better heavy seas offerings I've had. I'd have it again."
"Na Zdravje!"
"Overall it comes across as a bit of a boozy mess, without some crisp or more importantly fresh bread!!"
"im not really sure what they were going for here. isnt ""imperial pilsner"" synonymous with ""malt liquor?"" in theory this beer should work, take twice as much pilsner malt for the same amount of water, add twice as much yeast, lager. but i dont know what went wrong for them. sorry. my judgement is pass on this one."
"I didn't love it. Would drink it if offered, but not one of my favorites. I'll stick to the Loose Cannon."
"Overall, I didn't hate it, but I would never really be inclined to buy it ever again. Really disappointed in this variety pack."
"This was my first Imperial Pilsner and I'm just not a fan of something this light. I keep trying different variations and nothing has jumped out at me yet. Nice aroma after the pour but thats where this beer loses me. The flavor isn't there for me. Need something thicker with more substance."
"O- A very balanced beer, some bitterness and sweetness, nothing extreme."
"Overall this was a pretty run of the mill version of the style. It tastes good and drinks easily, but it is not as exciting as a lot of other big pilsners. Not one to seek out again, especially with Short’s recently releasing their Imperial Spruce Pilsner."
"O- Not a bad pilsner, especially with the 7+% alcohol bill. I do think it would help the overall profile to lower the strength of the beer slightly down to bring out more of the complexity, but that is just me."
"O - Not bad. Clipper City generally makes beers that I enjoy, and this one doesn't disappoint. While I feel it strays a bit from the true pilsners in appearance & taste, it's a solid offering and pretty enjoyable."
"I could sit and drink these all night."
"First sip reveals a soft creamy texture with mild rolling carbonation. The flavor is grainy malt with a bit of earthy hops to balance. Not a hop bomb or super malty nicely balanced if a bit mild. Perhaps the flavor has faded a bit with time on this one? The beer is enjoyable and VERY drinkable, I dont find the alcohol anywhere as I drink and am glad I aged one of these bottles in the cellar. Almost tastes like a well crafted english mild with the extra time in the cellar. A tasty brew."
"Interestingly strong yet easily drinkable, a nice style of Pilsner on the harder side, would go great with a burger and fries, most impressive characteristic is the ridiculously noticeable smell that came off slowly just after the pour with the carbonation, you could accidently loose track of how much you've had, lacked any other flavors other than the hops, could be just a matter of style preference"
"It's a different variation a style that can actually be very complex when done the right way, even though it gets a bad rap for being an easy-to-drink style. Somewhat impressive and I'm glad I picked this up."
"Overall this is a pretty good brew. I'd like a bit more hop presence, but that's just me."
"This beer is spicy at the finish and the alcohol definitely is noticeable for a Pilsner. Its not bitter and actually an easy drinker. It has a pleasant fruity/hoppy smell similiar the their IPS3 but not as pronounced. This is the first imperial pils I've tried. I think I may prefer regular pils."
"O - A quality pilsner that goes down smooth. Nothing extraordinary here, just a solid brew from the good people of Baltimore, Hon."
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: I thought this was an enjoyable enough beer that I’d be happy to have again. Sipping my way through this was fine. That said I’ll not go out of my way to find this again nor will it go on my shopping list. There are other, regular pils style beers I enjoy more. My overall impression was that its well made but on the ordinary side and so nothing here to write home about."
"O: Pretty good. Definitely a sipper. Might be a little too sweet, but that's what you would expect out of a double."
"O: I believe this is my first imperial pilsner and I'm not impressed. I'll have to try a different one. Perhaps they're just not my thing."
"Pours out to a golden orange with a thin white head that quickly disappears. It has little retention, not much lacing and not much carbonation. The smell is some citrus, sweet malts and a little biscuit. The taste starts out with some earthy hops followed by some citrus with a hint of honey and finishes off with some grassy hops. There also seems to be some sweet malts mixed in and the beer has a sweet taste to it. The alcohol seems to be well hidden as I can't even taste the alcohol. The mouthfeel is nice and smooth and very easy drinking. This is not a bad beer to drink whenever you feel like an easy drinking relaxing beer that tastes pretty good."
"O: More like an ale than a pislner. Good for a few, don't think I would have more than 2 or 3 as the ABV is high for the style."
"Taste-Toasted malt, biscuit, citrus zest, and a snappy hop bite. Very pleasant and flavorfull. A bit unexpected but very welcome. Label says ""Golden Bock Lager", I say it drinks more like a tasty pale ale. Will please pilsner lovers and anyone who enjoys a tasty dose of hops."
"D- A soundly made beer that is simple enough that it doesn't require intense pondering, yet complex enough to allow such. I would gladly have another."
"D: im a bit of a sucker for pilsners and double pilsners so it easy to drink and flavors suit me."
"An inconsistent Imperial Pilsner that is surprisingly refreshing, the lack of hops is disappointing but maybe a larger hop presence would be to distracting. As is though, I could pound these back during a nice hot summer afternoon."
"Mouthfeel is medium with some lingering malt sweetness and slight hop bitterness. Drinkability is modest for sure. The high malt character makes me want to stop after one."
"D: An easy drinker for such a high ABV, though this beer seems fairly plain and very out of touch with balance. Faint grains, adjunct sweetness and the boozy character just don't do it for me. Worth a try, but I won't be purchasing again."
"D - kind of grudgingly finished the 6 pack over a couple weeks, each time it was more and more forcing myself to drink it so it would go away. I really like everything else I've tasted from Heavy Seas/Clipper City, this just isn't my thing"
"D-has a unique taste but super easy to drink... a good pilsner imo would get this again"
"D: love this beer especially on the warmer days, a good offering I look forward to picking up again and again."
"A fine job keeping the bigger body balanced by the massive hops. Not your typical pils, but with all the things you expect from the pils style just big and bolder."
"For a Pilsner, it tasted much more citrus and malt oriented then hopped, still tasted good, the taste was subtle and short."
"The mouthfeel is thicker and less refreshing than most pilsners, but it still feels good. The drinkability also isn't as good as most pilsners because of the amped up flavor and thickness, but it's still quite drinkable. A solid beer."
"Another enjoyable offering from HS."
"D - Very smooth pils and easy to drink. Borderline session beer. Good for at least 3"
"Head of 1 finger, hazy color that matches a 9 on the SRM beer color chart. Some lace, but not very clingy and not much body. Smells of citrus, mostly grapefruit, and lime. Taste flavors of grapefruit, lime, lemon, tangerine, and traces of malt. Moderate body, with some fizz, and a dry finish. Good flavor and body, may have to have more, since I have two more in the fridge."
"Heavy Seas Uber Pils has slightly transparent orange colour and a decent head that fades to good lacing quite quickly. The smell is very grainy with some hops. The taste is grainy to begin and has a little honey flavour and a crisp hoppy aftertaste. The mouthfeel is pretty thick and nice. It's not overly carbonated. This is a very drinkable, if not especially interesting beer."
"great drinkability even at 7% abv...."
"I definitely applaud Heavy Seas for this one. I'm not the biggest pilsner fan, but I tend to seek this one out when I'm in the mood. May not wow you, but you will be pretty satisfied."
"D - nice take on the classic pilsner. I liked the lower carb on it, made it much smoother."
"Drinkability- This is a great drink. Not too bitter and deceptively rich."
"Another beer Mike got for his wedding, thanks for a great time and looking out bro...Bright medium gold with good carbonation...The aroma is sweet alcohol with some hops...The taste is much sweeter than the aroma, lots of alcohol, typical pilsner skunky hop. Not my thing."
"D- Small Craft Warning has some strong flavor for being in the double pilsner category. The commitment to the pilsner style still makes it very delicious. Heavy seas... keep up these brews!"
"Overall this is a great beer. I wish i had bought more of it. Would certainly order at a pub, purchase in a store or accept as a gift. Well done."
"Golden straw color, very clear. Super white head, swirl brings back a 1/2"" head at any time. Great carbonation. Very light, pale malt aroma. Faint notes of orange and lemon. Carbonation is great in mouthfeel. Very crisp. Lagery sweetness, some faint breadiness and orange peel in flavor. Not superflavorful but pretty true to style. Very light, clean, refreshing, and drinkable. One of my more favorites from Heavy Seas."
"I'm sorry ....this ain't no IMPERIAL anything... It's a good solid Pils... but not amped up in any way.... apparently brewed for the masses... this beer is totally ""safe""....and does not push the envelope in any way, shape, or form.... slightly above average"
"This is a pilsner for the IPA-loving crowd; let's hear it for imperial pilsners!"
"D- One bottle itself is very drinkable, and it's so refreshing you're likely to go for another. But the alcohol in this beer hits you hard, and, except for the first bottle I had, it is hidden extremely well. 8 bottles of this and you're really finished."
"d- only, glad to have tried this but i think that this is a one and done beer."
"I can imagine brewers sitting around thinking ""hmmm, what's left that we haven't 'imperialized' yet?"" Pumping up a pils seems like a task that could go badly wrong, but Clipper City did quite the nice job of making it bigger without losing sight of the basic style altogether. Much more hops than the style - creeping well into pale ale territory, but still retaining the basic crispness of the style."
"The drinkability suffers from the abundance of flavor: This is not a session beer. Good to sip."
"D - Easy drinking ADIP. I got this one in a trade but would like to try other Clipper City brands. I recommend this one and hope to get this again"
"Malty smells and a light pour, but the hoppy taste more than accomplishes enough to make you want to drink a 6 pack of these. 7 abv is a peculiarity - I hardly taste that and that makes me incredibly pleased. I'll stick with other Heavy Seas, but if you needed a pilsner, why not try this one?"
"d - A pretty good pilsener. I enjoyed the fruit in the taste more than the smell. Would try again."
"I have had this beer before, but this is the first time I have really given it a serious look, and I am definitely becoming a fan."
"."
"D - Extremely. This is a very good beer, I'd buy it again."
"An imperial pilsner? I had no idea this style or beer existed before my parents picked me up a mixed pack. Pours a pale orange colour, a bit darker than a normal pilsner. Nice head and ok retention down the glass. Smell is of lots of grassy hops. The hop flavour is incredible in this, basically a hopped up pilsner. A little bit syrupy in the mouthfeel, but smooth enough. I can't remember how many of these were in the mixed pack, but by the time I got to my parents place my dad had only left me one of these. He was a big fan too."
"D: OK the ABV is a little high for a session brew and not bad for 1 or 2.... Favors are very balance and makes for a very nice experience.... I'm having a hard time seeing this as a Pils.... I guess that is why it is Uber Pils... Worth looking into.. another good beer from Clipper."
"A refreshing beer. I liked it!"
"I like this beer, and think it's pretty good example of the style."
"Good drinkability, it went down real easy. Not really sure what a Uber Pils is, or that I've had an American Double/Imperial Pilsner before, but this was a good session beer that's worth trying."
"not my favorite but a good drinking beer, that should be tried.i tried mine at the heorot in muncie indiana.the beer is tasty and not hoppy which is important to me.i find myself gravitating more to ipas as i get older.if you have not tried it irecomend it."
"D: This is one of those beers that has just enough punch at %7 abv to be really dangerous. It's also one of those beers that you wouldn't guess to be dangerous. In other words: be careful and the drinkability is great."
"Taste is much sweeter than the smell suggests - grapefruit and citrus hops are much more prevalent than the more common and more bitter hops normally found in a pilsner, and a touch of yeast. The malt is biscuity and sweet, while the hops are crisp sweet - the beer is quite sweet in general, but very clean. Mouthfeel is very smooth, light carbonation, but the taste is almost overpoweringly sweet. Finished strong, quite drinkable but the flavor is almost too much for something that seems light in many other ways."
"I'm a fan of pilsners, I'm not exactly sure what an ""Uber Pils"" is, but it's not like most pilsners I've drank. It's light and crisp and with a 7.0 ABV you really can't taste the alcohol. I could see kicking back and enjoying one with friends."
"It gives a nice spicy tingle on your tongue and drinks decently for a high abv brew."
"Pours a cloudy gold with a small white head. Aromas are similar to (but less pronounced than) those of an IPA: an apple-like sweetness strongly backed by a complex array of citrusy hops. The taste is on the tropical fruit and mango elements, with lightly lemony and resinous hops supporting the sweet, cotton candy malts on the finish. Overall this beer is well balanced and devoid of any sort of sharp, offensive corners. Makes for a nice night cap."
"Sweet pilsner malt aroma, honey, cookie dough, husky grain. Flavor follows the nose, but with an earthy hop aftertaste. Rich maltiness, with very minor bitterness in the finish. Definitely a malt forward lager. The label describes it as a ""rich, golden bock lager"". Full bodied, yet not heavy. I'm still sipping this though. Enjoyable as it warms, sticky texture, the breadiness and honey notes come out a bit more."
"Dark yellow with just a slight haze. Started with a thick foamy head, but didn't last very long. Steady active carbonation. Light lemony citrus aroma along with a subtly sweet malty smell. Very fresh smelling with subdued hop aroma. Very light feel with the carbonation so light that it nearly goes unnoticed. For the higher ABV this has a very light body. Sweet malty flavors in the front that slowly roll into a light citrus hop flavor followed by a light alcoholic finish. Finishes very clean though. Very refreshing and drinkable."
"Poured a translucent yellow with a high carbonation content, one finger of white, poor retention, and average lacing. The nose revealed a decent noble hops presence, along with some grass, hay, and earthiness. The taste yielded the same flavors, but not as pronounced, with a thin dry finish. Thin bodied and highly carbonated overall. Good for sessioning, but would benefit from slightly more body and flavor balance."
"side note- My first beer from Clipper City Brewing and if the rest are like this i can't wait to try them all."
"Freshness notched until 8/10. Pours a nice deep golden, small fizzy-yet-sticky head, and a lot of suspended particles. A hoppy lean on the nose, also some alcohol odor. Tastes like it smells, bready with a decent enough twang on the end and a little extra kick of alcohol. Citrusy too, much reminiscent of a pale ale. How these Imperial X beers confound me.. Mouthfeel is light, if only a bit astringent. Easy to drink."
"D - one of the more drinkable Double Pils, has a nice hop profile to it while staying true to the style."
"Overall, ok drinkability. I don't think I could do a six, and a single was enough for me. Don't hate this, and this could be neat change of pace some days, but not a session beer. Worht a try. Well crafted."
"Deep gold to light brown. Little to no head. Spicy hop aroma migngled with malt. Definately a pils, noble German hops dominate but not overpowering, nicely balanced. Starts and finishes clean, feels nice on the palate. Very drinkable. I should buy this for my macro friends who sometimes get daring and are willing to experiment."
"I would have no hesitation in swigging a few of these by the pool in the heat of summer, once I was assured that there was a competent lifeguard who could retrieve me from the bottom of the deep end once the Heavy Seas have washed over me. Recommended."
"D: After one of these, I'm ready for something different."
"Overall - Good beer, though more like an IPA then pils"
"Overall- this brew is a unique one. for reminding me of drinking water (not much taste going on) it has a hardy body feel to it. i recommended this to my bro who isn't to crazy with strong beers (too much hops or malt action) and liked it and i can see why. if you want a hardy brew but without much backing it up i say go for it. it's clean and crisp and subtle."
"So this is an imperial-pilsner, eh? Not bad, but honestly a style I don't see the need to overindulge with ingredients. Give me a regular German or Czech pilsner anytime."
"Mouthfeel is light, a bit slick, with okay carbonation. Crisp. Good drinkability, but this beer didn't WOW me or anything."
"Way decent, a little tame in the overall impact. But the impact is sublime."
"Despite the muddled aspects apparent to taste, I found myself enjoying Uber Pils quite a lot. Sure, I would also like either more spiciness or more carbonation; these are both relatively minor points of contention. At 7% abv this is rather potent; the taste is such I'd want to drink it all night even though I know two or three would be reasonable."
"No Sir, I don't like it."
"D - Not too drinkable. Syrupy and rather strong."
"While that might be a weird compliment, it doesn't say much for it being a lager."
"Overall this is pretty good but not great for the style. The less beer snobbish people I was at the beach with liked it more than I did."
"This beer doesn't look too great...it's a bit past the recommended drink-by date. A nice amber color with little head. A strong grassy scent that's pleasing. The taste is a bit faded, but I remember it being reminiscent of a good pilsner, though a little stronger due to the imperial status. A decent overall beer that would make nice for a session with friends."
"Pours a dark macro yellow with a white head. The aroma is strong pilsner malt. The flavor is reminiscent of iced tea. Not too much alcohol or hop character in the beer. Medium, slightly cream mouthfeel and low carbonation."
"The beer is a bit sticky on the tongue with a light body. A bit crisp and biting but the carbonation was less than expected. Clean aroma and flavors and smooth drinking make this a pretty drinkable beer."
"Overall, I was quite happy with this beer. Better than your average pilsner. Definetly a beer I'd buy to drink regularly if I wanted a pilsner... the Heavy Seas sampler is definetly worth picking up."
"Drinkability - With a heavier body and higher ABV than most pilsners, this is one to be savored a bit. That said, could have one or two of these easily."
"Good drinkability and flavor for a relatively big pilsner. Very enjoyable."
"Poured into a chilled pint glass. Dark yellow to orange color. 2 finger head. Floating yeast in bottle that was not possible to avoid pouring out. First taste, very balanced. Nothing over powering. Roasted malt flavor but without any over hopping. Very small bubbles make it a refreshing drink. I could drink several of these despite the 7.0% ABV."
"D: This is nothing special. Will not purchase again."
"D: I'm not really a pilsner guy but this is an awesome pilsner. And it drinks really well. Would work well as an introductory brew."
"(Bottle into pint glass) Pours a beautiful amber with little head that quickly faded. I spent a lot of time taking in the complex aromas that hit the nose with this one. I was able to pick up loads of the toasted malts but also hints of apple and honey, and various spices I couldn't single out. Once I went in for a drink, I was not disappointed! The complexity on the nose played very well balanced on the tongue. The alcohol hits, but it is very well disguised by the heavy (but nowhere near overpowering) malt sweetness. A firm hope bite at the end gives a nice crisp finish."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, for it's abv it is pretty easy drinking. As mentioned before there really isn't any intense flavors that would make this difficult to drink a few glasses of in an evening. That being said there really isn't anything special about the flavor either. It's a decent drinkable beer but not something I would buy often. The mix 12 pack that this came in was decent for the price though."
"D – Overall, quite drinkable because of the style’s versatility. A beer for all seasons."
"Drinkability: For the ABV, it's certainly drinkable, but there isn't much to set this apart from the macro beers. This one disappointed me."
"Drinkability: A good beer and a great pilsner. Being an imperial pilsner, it has more maltiness than your garden-variety pils. Very interesting and definitely worth a shot."
"This one only falls slightly above average for me. It just didn't do enough. It seemed a little too tame and a little too generic. Drinkable enough in its way, but I wanted something more."
"Drinkability: Could have about 2-3 of these but that's it. Solid session brew though."
"This is a well built craft, one that provides any sea-loving beer drinker with a refreshing quaff. In any case, try to get past the nautical motif used in this review and get some."
"Ok, this has just become one of my favorite pilsners. Not quite the top of the list, but well above average. Great drinkability."
"Poured from 12 ounce bottle into a Unibroue tulip. One pinky of white head doesn't last very long. Golden body has aroma of citrusy hops and sweet malts. Taste like a sweeter than average pilsner, very easy and pleasant to drink. Their description on their website indicates a ""pilsner style bock lager"" That actually makes perfect sense. Either way, whatever style it is, its pretty tasty."
"This beer got better as I reviewed it. I've never had an imperial pilsner before, but this was a pretty solid beer. Tasty, smooth, and pretty damn drinkable even at over 7%."
"12oz. bottle served in a pilsener glass. Best by May09 notched on the label (guess I should have looked closer). Poured a translucent orange-gold with a dense, creamy, two inch, bright white head. Head eventually recedes into a solid half inch cap with delicate strands of lacing forming during the tasting; good retention and adherence. Nose is malty/breasy sweet; maybe a hint of toffee. Taste is consistent with nose; however, some slight bittering hops comes out in the mix as well. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a pleasant, yet subtle background effervescence. Wasn't sure what to expect from an Imperial Pils, but I was fairly pleased for the most part. Definitely worth a try."
"In the finish, there is a touch of boozy heat, but there is no astringent alcoholic flavor. The beer is surprisingly smooth, almost too much so. However, even with the relatively high alcohol content of this beer, the drinkability factor is high. Almost dangerously so..."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my SA perfect pint glass. It pours orange/yellow with a thin white head that dissipates quickly. The aroma is very bready with alot of herbal notes. The flavor is bready with citrus and herbs intertwined. The finish is sweet and lingers. The beer is light bodied and has average carbonation. Something in the flavor doesn't really work for me, I don't think I will grab another of these anytime soon."
"Overall this is one of the cleaner examples of the style I've had so far. Nothing exceptional but worth a shot."
"One finger head that leaves pretty quick. Decent orangish pale color. The smell is very malty with some hops mixed in. you can taste the malt and hops as well as some fruitieness too. Not bad at all, I wouldnt say its watery, but It could use a more full-flavored taste. All in all its a pretty good pilsner."
"Overall: Not bad. Perhaps just not in the style I like. Average."
"Wine Specialist/6-pack/$9.99"
"D: Good drinkability seems like what an American lager is supposed to taste like."
"The fact that this is rated as highly as it is makes me lose faith in BA. Just more of the same."
"Poured a hazy amber with a one finger head that quickly reduced to a thin cover. I swear that I can pick out hops in the aroma, but the tongue doesn't back the nose. The taste was a nice, modest sweetness. There is a taste here that I like a lot, but cannot name. I've been reading all the master BAer's taste descriptions searching for that elusive flavor, and can't find it. This is frustrating, but I will drink again, and again, until I can figure it out (oh, how I suffer for this craft). Mouth feel was medium bodied with low carbonation. Drinkability was very good. This was my first imperial pilsner and it was a pleasant surprise, nothing at all like a regular pils. I'm going to have to go through the list of highly rated American double/imperial pils and see what I've been missing."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a golden color with a 1 inch head. Smell is mild, some hints of hops. Taste is hoppy with some maltiness. Feels medium bodied in the mouth. This is not a beer I could continually drink. Overall this is a mediocre beer."
"Conclusion: I really liked this, I'd been searching for it for awhile, found it on vacation, and tonight we paired it with a simple Margherita-style pizza and it was quite nice"
"MF/D: Medium/heavy body, alcohol is well hidden, smooth going down, long bready finish."
"D- easy to drink...somewhat refreshing, even at 7%...not my favorite from the Heavy Seas sampler, but still a good beer"
"This is a good brew and one I'm glad I tried. Two solid brews thus far from Clipper City."
"D- A very drinkable beer, even for being a 7+abv...Not necessarily my favorite, and not quite sure you can actually call it a true pilsner (imperial or otherwise) but still definitely worth a try..."
"Pours a light copper color iwth a soapy white head that left some sticky lacing as it settled. The aroma is rather light, there is some toasted malt smell, toasted bread. The beer starts off grassy and bitter, then is balanced with a bready malt. The grassy bitterness stays throughout. I seem to pick up some very light citrus hops as well. The malt is not nearly as dry and cracker like as most pils but for an imperial pils that is to be expected. Moderate body with softer carbonation, leans on the dry and bitter side. I'm not a big fan of the style as it doesn't make much sense to me as I see traditional pils to be delicate with fairly low abv. It is just not a style that needs to be ""imperialed"". That being said, the beer tries to stay true to being a pils as it has grassy notes and is fairly dry."
"Smells hoppy with some citrus, spicy hops, and some floral senses to it. smooth taste, plenty of hops, some malts, somewhat yeasty and a touch of citrus. medium-light body with an all around average taste. easy to drink though"
"Malty, sweet smell. Traces of alcohol. Taste is very malty and sweet, like the smell. Again, not what I was expecting out of a Pilsner. Drinks pretty easy for 7.25% ABV. Glad I had this. I was pleasantly surprised."
"Drinks very well at 7.75%. Very smooth and close to what I would call sessionable for its drinkability."
"D-Smooth and refreshing from a medium bodies beer... dont let the ""Pils"" description fool you"
"A nice golden/orange color body with a two finger offwhite head,light to medium carbonation , light lacing. Aroma is sweet and fairly hoppy with just a hint of alcohol in the nose. Flavor is sweet and malty up frong with a nice level of bitterness, a little citrus rind,some peppery spice hints,faint honey. Medium body with a full slightly sticky mouthfeel fruity aftertaste, a smooth dinker."
"D: Another winner from this spectacular local (to where I am) brewery. Cheers!"
" craft pils."
"Drinkability - This was a very drinkable beer. I would have no problem putting away more than a few."
"drinkability - while the beer went down fast i just dont want to drink more then one per night"
"D - Tasty but high alcohol."
"Nice light sweet flavor and great auroma to match. You definitely need to give this one a try if you haven't already."
"d: this was a smooth one and had great balance, wish i had more of them"
"On-tap at Flying Saucer served in a standard Pint glass a crisp but slightly murky light orange with a thin khaki head that diminishes to a thin layer. Aroma is slight sweet malts and crisp hops. The taste is a muddled blend of overly sweet malts and tangy hops that don't seem to get along that well. The beer is medium bodied with an aggressive amount of sweetness. This one is not what I expect in an Imperial Pilsner, or even a Pilsner for that matter."
"D - I thought it was enjoyable and flavorful but nothing special. I'm rating it as a beer. I'd rate it lower if I was rating it as a Pils."
"D - Not usually big on the pilsners, but I really like this one."
"Well, it's very drinkable, because the flavor is rather inoffensive. I really expected more hop bitterness from this, but it's still a pretty good strong pils."
"D: I'd have two and probably walk away. It's tough to session any Heavy Seas offering because of the ABV, but this one is pretty nice and easy drinking."
"D: Very nice. Love when I can find a good pilsner, especially of the imperial variety..."
"This is a pretty big bodied lager with a decent amount of carbonation. I could drink a few of these. Something worth trying, but not a regular buy for me."
"pilsner is not my favorite style."
"This beer poured a golden yellow with a two finger tight white head. Head had very good retention with thin sheets of lacing left along the glass the entire way down. The nose could have had more. There was a hint of sweetness, slight citrus hops with a bready overtone to it. Taste starts with a touch of slight toasted malts and some light hops. Mostly of muted malts and a bit of biscuit with a kick. This is a lighter bodied beer with higher carbonation. Crisp mouthfeel, goes down relatively easily. This is a decent beer, if this is your style of beer - it's one that you could sit with for a bit."
"I really like the hop3 so I was excited to try this one. After primapils this has alot to compete with. Pours a nice golden with one finger head. Sweet smell of malt. Nice light taste and great balance, slighty boozey. Not too malty with just the right amount of hop. Creamy mouthfeel. I would not mind having a whole sixpack of these. One of the better pilsners."
"I have had this beer a couple different times and this was not up to par with the other samplings. However, I am trying to grade on the collective experience. I like this beer and when fresh reminds me alot of some of the better Euro pilsner offerings."
"D - I am not a pilsner drinker, but this is probably the closest to actual taste in this category of brewing. Well balanced and close to perfect for this style."
"mouthfeel is rich, thick, luscious...and even crisp, clean...making this another very drinkable and notable brew from Clipper City. as it goes down to the end of the bottle, it seems sweeter, though not in an overly sugary way. interesting for sure. i would like to have something very salty with this..."
"The whole Heavy Seas line is pretty solid, I have yet to try one I don't like."
"D - Could fatigue after 4 or 5, but overall, very smooth and well balanced."
"An interesting beer, which comes off (to me anyway) was sort of a cross between an IPA and an ESB. This concept of the ""Über Pils"" intrigues me. As for the beer itself, it's a very rewarding brew and I would definitely purchase this again."
"I'm not quite sure what to make of this. It doesn't seem like either a pilsener or imperial pilsener. It's still drinkable but again, I'm not too impressed. I would prefer that it stress the flavor of the pilsener malt more but it doesn't appear to do this. A good pilsener, even an imperial pilsener, should be tasty. This is just a bit too boozy for me."
"Pours a bright orangy golden with a small white head that falls fairly quickly. The aroma is malty, with a tight hop character - a little earthy, a little citrusy, with a sharp pine note that gives it a pinched, slightly sour edge. The flavor has that same piny sourness, not entirely unpleasant, but not terribly subtle or refreshing either. There is a faint slap of alcohol that is unbecoming in a pilsner. The mouthfeel is surprisingly viscous, leaving that sour note clinging to the tongue. This is not a beer I'd be happy to spend much time with."
"Feel is good body wise and carbonation wise but the drinkability is low due to the one dimension of it."
"Drinkability: Well, it is easy to drink, despite the high ABV, but that's largely because there's not much to it. I doubt I'd seek it out again, simply because there's not much to it, but it'd be way too easy to put down a few of these."
"D: Very smooth and refreshing, this beer is a wonderful example of a food-compatible beverage that can stand up to heavy flavors. It was not hard to ""accidentally"" drink all three of these that I got in the sample pack in a few hours."
"Thinnish cream white head, lacing sticks around longer than the head does. Quite cloudy, adds to glow of the bronze, orange color, only slight yellowing at the rims. Smells like a pilsner that ate three cheesecakes and got so fat it couldn't get off the couch without two guys helping, super-sweet pink grapefruit and orange juice, golden honey, dates if not outright plummy at moments, touches of coriander and cumin spice, ripe peach and apricot fruit, streaks of grassy, grainy hops without ever becoming more than an embellishment. Medium to full-bodied, very round and dense in mouth feel without at the same time feeling soft. Presents all that ripe, juicy apricot, peach, cherry fruit as well as pink grapefruit, tangelo citrus, thin glaze of honey keeps you smiling and just wanting to uncritically throw more back. The carbonation level is perfect, tiny pricks alone allowing the flavors to soak in fully. The only drawback here may be that it doesn't taste like a pilsner. My first ""Double Pilsner"" so maybe I'm ignorant. Maybe."
"Pours out a deep golden color with smaller white head. Constant carbonation makes this beer very attractive. Good looking brew. Smells really hoppy for a pilsner with some citrus in there, not too much nose. Taste is really interesting, very hoppy with a nice spiciness and almost sweetness on the finish clean this one up really nicely. Some orange that blends well with the spices, very nice hoppy pils with a bitterness that makes it fairly drinkable. Nothing too amazing that blows you away, but a very nice solid brew."
"Golden copper hazed by fine suspended particles, Big, patchy white head that leaves big blobs of lace on the glass. Smell is faint Amarillo hops and fruity yeast. Tastes pretty unique, not a hop bomb by any stretch of the imagination but just enough of a hop kick to get the juices flowing, nice chewy maltiness finishes it off. Smooth, medium heavy mouthfeel with a very fine carbonation. Cool and different beer that's worth checking out."
"D: A decent big beer that is not overpowering. Probably couldn't knock down a couple in a sitting, but as a single bottle, it was good."
"Notes: I wrote ""Tastes like a pilsner with too much fruity malt or yeast"" and concluded ""too sweet."" Not a horrible beer, but I like my pilsners (even Imperial Pilsners) to be more crisp, dry and with the hop bite or bitterness dominating any grainy (or yeasty) foundation. This one didn't live up to those expectations."
"Drinkablitity is good. High alcohol content, that isnt all that prevalent, is the only thing keeping it from a 5 in my book."
"Notes from: 8/13/05"
"An Imperial Pilsner, ... Hmmm ...pours a deep gold with an ice cream cone head, lots of sticky lacing on the glass, with a slow even-flow of tiny bubbles. Smell of wet hay, sour and musty,...also corn and grains on-the-nose. Taste of butter, hops, and grains...some orange, Body is heavier than a typical Pils, bitter, buttery aftertaste, complex. Reminds me of a Mai Bock,..Finish is dry,..Interesting brew, .."
"The feel is fizzy like champagne. Surprisingly creamy. A bit bitter and sharp, but okay. Not a bad pickup."
"7/4/7/3/14 (3.5/5)"
"First of this style to try and I am glad I did. A seethru dark gold with a one-finger foam head that left sticky lace. Light and airy aroma of floral hops and grass. Medium-bodied, smooth and creamy, with hints of sweet malt. More citric bite than anything as there are plenty of hops in this. Not a mellow, veggie twinge from a regular pils, instead this beer packs a more hearty hop punch with moderate dryness."
"(rated Aug 10, 2007)"
"Easy drinker. This is a very interesting beer, I could definately have a few of these."
"HV"
"Overall an enjoyable beer, though a style I don't particularly enjoy."
"D - The pils is not my style of beer...but this is a decent brew from Clipper City"
"Pours a clear golden yellow color with a thin foamy white head that settles into a slight lacing. Crisp light fruit aroma with hints of apple, pear, citrus peel as well as subtle malt and hop presence. Very quaffable with a slight malt character balancing out the citrus Grapefruit, lemon and banana flavors and a perfect citrus hop finish."
"Dark in color for a pilsner but light for an American Double. A clear light amber with a white, multi-sized bubbles, head that didn't stick around long but leaves a nice ring of foam for the rest of this session. Smells of typical noble pilsner hops along with a mild bisuit pale malt and maybe some other hoppiness that I can't place. This is a very good, souped up pilsner. I'm not generally a big fan of the traditional pilsner style but the extra hop and malt characteristics and a meatier med-full bodied mouthfeel and warming alcohol are much tastier and more interesting for me. Another solid release from Clipper City's Heavy Seas line."
"Out of a bottle this beer was a deep gold color with some tangerine tint to it. The head was two fingers of small, yellowish bubbles that slowly receded to a thin skim. Nice lacing. The aroma was a good blend of floral and citrus hops with pilsner malt and a generally dry, grainy character. The flavors were complex and impressive. At first there was a shot of sweet, caramel malt and toffee followed by the rich grainy character, followed by bready yeast and a bitter finish. Elements of fruit persist throughout and yet the character remains dry. The mouthfeel was smooth and the body rich and full though not heavy. Perfect carbonation too. Impressive and enjoyable, a great example of an Imperial Pilsner."
"Nikki"
"D: A good pils with some kick."
"flavor has a slight malt sweetness and a bold but not overwhelming hop presence. mouthfeel is full-bodied, and the finish is all noble hops. seems to fit the bill perfectly of an imperial pilsner, meeting all the characteristics of a pilsner but doubly so, with a fuller body and a stronger hop presence. the bright, fresh presence of citrusy hops seems a bit off-style but is a nice addition. pretty good beer."
"This stuff was pretty damn good for being an old bottle. I would love to get a fresher one and get the full hop effect."
"Really, a nice beer."
"D - pretty drinkable beer but may be a little too sweet for my liking"
"D: This one has great balance and nice mouthfeel, with considerable complexity. It's nothing special to look at, but it's very good and something I could drink several of."
"I thought this was one of the better ones in the mixed pack, a solid beer of a rare style. Pours a cloudy copper color with a small head. There is almost no aroma to speak of, which I found quite odd. Taste wise is much better than small, you get a nice mix of malts ans hops with a nice smooth finish. There's a bit of alcohol kick in the swallow but that's expected and flows with the beer. Try this if you can."
"D - Good beer but there is something there that seems out of place."
"Drinking this impy pilsner from Clipper City was a joy. A must try if you get the chance."
"d - A good imperial pils, not my favorite, but I would consider doing again."
"The flavor matches the nose. This is far more malty than most pilsner. Very rich pilsner that the carbonation balances off nicely."
"All around I say good beer for a cool fall weekend."
"You MUST try this beer!"
"overall. very enjoyable. the entire ""Heavy Seas"" bunch was worth taking a look at. No gold medals, but very well done."
"Another good Clipper City beer."
"Prosit, MK"
"A quality, drinkable pilsner. Granted, I am not normally a big Pilsner fan, but this one lacks some of that crisp bitterness of other Pilsners, which is a good thing. A nice golden color from pour, with apparent carbonization. A very slight hop smell, nothing too big though. A nice hop flavor, nothing overwhelming, not too bitter! A crisp pilsner, and feels that way in your mouth. In the end, a refreshing take on the pilsner, and one I could drink a few of."
"Admittedly, Pilseners don't usually do it for me but this is very good. Maybe a little too heavy with warmth but well-made and enjoyable for 1 or 2 nonetheless."
"D - Very drinkable. Very slight alcohol taste (7% abv), but mostly malty throughout."
"4.0 D: This is definitely a beer that I could drink for hours. It leaves a clean feeling and no one flavor dominates."
"D: Very smooth tasting beer."
"D-A good beer but slanted too malt forward for my taste. I can see the good in this but for me it simply doesnt have what I am looking for."
"Aside from the alcohol content, quite drinkable. Surprisingly mild, fairly well constructed brew, but nothing to shout about."
"D: Very nice example of the style. While I do not have a lot of experience with this style I found it enjoyable and in line with other things I have tried. The best beer from this brewery I have had to date."
"The more I have this the more I like it (when I first purchased it I did not know it was an Imperial Pils). Pours a golden color, perhaps darker shade of gold topped with a nice thick creamy head that leaves a lot of lacing on the glass. Aroma is hoppy with lemons, some malts and a faint overall tang presence. Slightly bitter hoppy flavor with sweet citrus fruits mixed in and balanced by rich malts. Crisp, clean, creamy and a great hop/malt balance. Slightly sour, tart lemon aftertaste. I can find this easily, it is bold and flavorful while being refreshing and it is reasonably priced."
"Upon first sips, floral hops and some bitterness, then mild sweetness that balances well. Very nice. I didn't think I would enjoy a pils this much. Not much in the aftertaste, tho. Light in body with loads of carbonation. Very drinkable!"
"The label describes this beer as a ""bock lager", and I'd say that Bock is a more appropriate labelling for this beer than Imperial Pilsner, and that this is a fairly decent interpretation of the style. It is very well balanced, with a sweet malty character that isn't cloying, though it seems rather tame compared to Clipper City's usual Heavy Seas offerings, and leaves me begging for a bit more in the hop arena."
"Toast and butter malt up front with herbal, spicy hop bitterness. Buttery biscuit malt turns to sweeter fruits (a little tropical). Herbal, minty hop flavors and bitterness follow. Creamy, smooth mouthfeel. Spicy, Saaz-y hop finish. Medium-bodied. Nice."
"Overall I think it's a very good take on an extreme style, but Sam Adams Imperial Pilsner still takes the gold imo."
"Nice beer. Not excellent. Certainly not a session beer, but a nice clean example of a pils with higher octane levels."
"The alcohol is well hidden, but more than a couple of these and I'd be feeling it. Very crisp and refreshing."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into 20oz pint glass. Firm pour yields one finger head that diminishes rapidly, leaving a very thin ring around the outside of the glass. Cloudy amber in color, with a light haze. Smells of light hops, and not much else. On the palate, light and refreshing, very strong hop bitters for style, good malt backbone not unbalanced. Very reminiscent of the Victory Prima Pils, perhaps with more malt character. Long, dry and bitter finish. Very nice beer."
"mouthfeel is thinner than expected for such depth, bitter, nicely drinkable but not my favorite clipper city beer."
"Pours a handsome transparent gold color, dense white head settles slowly, sheets of lacing left in the glass. Smell is floral hops, kind of a soft sweet malt background. Really nice flavors in this one, slightly bready, a touch of tangerine, some piney hops. Oh-so-slightly stickiness to the beer, but still pretty refreshing. Even with the high(ish) ABV, I can see having a few of these in a sitting. Another tasty Heavy Seas offering!"
"Small Craft Warning pours a clean, transparent, yellow/orange color with a ballet of bubbles rising from the bottom of the pint glass and a decent 1 finger white head. The nose is full of loads of dry hops and subtle malts, much like the nose of a pale ale to me. Upon tasting, lots of spicy/citrusy hops lay over a sturdy malt backbone that fades into a creamy mouth feel texture with a little alcohol heat on the finish. Its a medium bodied brew with some bright carbonation. Not many breweries are doing this style, a single bottle is definitely worth a show if spotted."
"Definatly happy with this one. I generally dislike pilsner's, but this one is surely exceptable."
"D: The drinkability is very high with this one. It is easy to knock back since it is very refreshing. This one is definitely sessionable."
"Golden-orange color, white head. Smell- pilsner malts, strange hop profile in the smell with both noble hop characteristic and a bit of citrus - hard to pinpoint, a bit of alcohol, and a strange fruitiness involved and funk. This is intriguing, maybe because it is my first of its kind. Hits the mouth with an almost gritty spice to it and finishes with a little bit of mineral astringency. A slick oil feeling. So... it tastes a little yeasty, pale malts, and again a strange hop presence that is oily/buttery and slightly citrusy... fairly light beer but much more interesting than most any pilsner I've had to date, maybe the best. ... best description I can give of this beer is - buttery."
"This is one of those beers I was expecting something and got something else, in a good way. I was expecting more hops and less malt, but I guess the hops are just a small compontent of a Imperial Pils. Nice malty nose, here is where I was thinking of the hops, not much hop in the nose, very malty, caramel and bready. The taste is almost sweet with just a little bit of bitterness from the hops sneaking in at the end of the sip. The sweetness is like a pilsner, malty, buttery. It has a good full body kind of like the DFH imperial pilsner, and not as crisp and hoppy as the SA imperial pilsner."
"Pours rich golden white a medium sized whitish head. Smell is lemon, lager like malt and light alcohol. Together comes across fresh, bright and somewhat inviting. Taste is a bit dusty, chalky and lightly alcoholic without the burn, and with lager like malty characteristics and orange rind flavor. Flavorful with strong orange rind character and light malt. Very mild hop character. Citrusy, yet lager like. Definitely unique, but not particularly great, with some alcohol presence, which is a bit obtrusive at 7%."
"Drink this one cold and have it with a few salty cashews to balance the sweetness. Only flaw is in the malt profile. It is a little weak in that area."
"D - Very appealing and I could swirl down a few of these with no problem."
"i like this beer, it reminds me of the strong eruo-lager i would get in hamtramck michigan from poland and other eastern block countries. clean and crisp with a kick."
"This brew strikes a decent balance between thin, one dimensional IPAs and full bodied DIPAs. Overall a great beer, without the general spicy characteristics of traditional pilsners. I like that."
"some hops in the taste giving way to sweet malts very quickly goes down smooth with a faint hoppy aftertaste. had i not read the label, i would never know this baby packed seven and a quarter percent of alcohol. this is a quick drink, and probably dangerous if you aren't aware of its strength."
""
"This one comes out of the tap a semi-transparent honey golden. Aroma has a nice balance of maltiness and hoppiness, but is not complex. Flavor is mouth-filling, fairly malty, with some hop bitterness and fruity hints. It goes down smoothly and leaves a pleasantly bitter hoppy aftertaste."
"D: This is an easy drinker for a cool summer evening. It reminded of a marzen or Maibock that was hopped like and American IPA"
"Flavor boasts more hops than the aroma heralded. Hops are spicy, earthy, and herbal balanced by some sweet malt character. Another layer presents what I can only describe as a buttery citrus flavor which can almost be described as greasy or fatty. Interesting."
"12 oz bottle (best by july 2008)in to pilsner glass. Pours a light amber with a steady flow of carbonation and a classic pilsner head. More malty than other pilsners I have had and less floral. Smooth biscuit malt with crisp finish. Clean mouthfeel and very easy to drink. Different than most pilsners, but not in a bad way."
"Taste is mild sweet malt and a little floral hops, no hint of the alcohol. Mouthfeel is rich enough, the floral hops are a bit too much to categorize the mouthfeel as 'crisp'. Drinkability is good, but at 7.25, this is hardly a session beer. Not a bad beer to unwind with on a hot day, but not one that I would necssarily put in a rotation."
"Substantial in body with a somewhat lower than expected degree of carbonation. Smooth yet crisp and refreshing. A great hopped up rendition of the style."
"Dark golden orange tinted color with a decent head on it. Has some citrus smell along with a bready malty aroma. Doesn't really taste like a pilsner to me, but its still very good. You can certainly taste that they added some american type of hop along side the noble hops, but that is all upfront and the main flavor is the bready malts and slight alcohol on the back end. Not a pilsner in my book but still avery enjoyable beer overall."
"Drinkability is high. I recognize that I'm a homer for anything Heavy Seas... but I could drink these all day long. If it weren't for that pesky 7.25% ABV..."
"D: Not a bad beer, although there was an alcohol smell, it was not tasted, which made it go down smooth."
"Pours a cloudy golden with a white head that sticks around for a short wile. dissipation leads to a light lacing effect. This is a refreshing looking brew! Smell is ""ho-hum"" Nothing stands out too much. Light hop aroma but that's all I got. Crisp refreshing taste considering the ABV is over 7. Drinks easily and compliments a beef dinner well."
"This beer is crisp, clean and refreshing. Carbonation is low to medium. It's hard to believe this is 7% abv. I believe this brew is bigger-bodied than a typical pilsner, but it is still very drinkable, even despite the higher abv."
"Colorwise it's a bit more orange than any other pilsner I've seen. Looks more like malt liquor (first time mentioned) actually. The slight head vanished fast and a very thin lacing that leaves from the side of the glass seconds after each tip. It smells of fresh mowed lawn and sugary malt. It's a smell that takes me back to my younger years of buying malt liquor (there it is again) 40's because they were more bang for the buck. The thing is though that while there is one day every summer where I go and visit my old friend Mickey Big Mouth I wasn't planning on today being that day. Maybe it's because of the higher alcohol content but the taste reminds me of malt liquor (3rd reference now) too more than it does of a proper pilsner. Metallic and too sweet like a corn syrup quality. It tastes like everything was overcooked turning the entire presentation into a flavor lacking mush. There is a bit of a hop flavor in the finish but the beer lacks complexities and particular characters to get excited about it."
"Overall a beer I've heard of for quite a while and I'm glad I got to try it. Dryness is what I look for in a Pils and this one's got it. I also look for a nice hit of hops in a good Pils and this one's got it (and some to spare). A big fluffy white head with gargantuan lacework...check. I'm a fan and will definitely be on the lookout for a sixer when this product officially hits my area's retail shelves."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, decent representation of style, to be honest I haven't like much of anything from this brewer, so I was well-prepared to not like this beer. I'm happy to say that I was pleasantly surprised. This beer is good one to drink for a long time."
"This beer is in style-limbo. Definitely not your normal pils, much closer to a very tame pale ale or a hoppy bock."
"The mouthfeel is hard to beat, smooth, crisp but with lots of texture. This is one worth grabbing a couple sixers, cellaring one and chilling the other for a warm summer night on the porch. Easily one of my very favorites from Clipper City. Well done."
"I have to pull this one out of my ass, but the color looks EXACTLY like Bell's Oberon, not the label but their poster! Smells like pine resin, moldy wood, tuna (so true, you dingdongs) and a little bit of grapefruit. Well, as you can think this beer is going downhill, but the palate does fend a little better. Ill throw some good in, and follow it with some more atrocities. Good entry, showing some hops that aren't overpowering at all! A little bit of lemon peel, and a little orange. After that, it turns into a very wavy like palate of off flavors that don't belong in a beer. I like to find major flaws in beers, and i rarely do- yet this one flaws like a champion. A taste of old meat, what? You would think with very little hop/malt flavors that the alcohol would shine, yet I don't taste much alcohol what-so-ever. Doesn't that make you think a little as to why the hell don't i taste the alcohol with all these off flavors? TUNA"
"I imagine this would be a fairly safe choice for folks just venturing out into craft brews."
"Didn't find this refreshing or very drinkable. I appreciate Clipper City going for a new angle here, but this seemed awfully far removed from the great pilsners of today."
"D: Nice, but different. I enjoyed the brew and will be happy to enjoy it again!"
"D - I'm not much of a pils drinker, but the uberness of this is getting my attention. Definitely has that pils-like taste profile, but kicked up a notch. Not as clean or crisp, but much more complexity. A very rich, beefy ""pils"""
"I dunno if this fact impresses me with ALL their brews, but this Heavy Seas series seems to put a new American twist on every traditional style it undertakes. In some cases, I appreciate it, in others, it's a bit disarming."
"Maybe my palette has been destroyed by months of double IPAs, such that I can't appreciate the delicate qualities of true pilsners, but THIS, in my opinion, is a pilsner. A strong, flavorful beer with real presence, well-hopped, spicy and floral but sweet, and a real beauty at that. A definite summer go-to beer."
"picked this one up the other day, states it's a bock lager tho ; pours a slightly cloudy pale orange-yellow w/ a thin fluffy off-white head which dissipates quickly leaving a moderate broken lacing down my snifter ; a steely grain smell with hints of floral hops and vinous alcoholic adjuncts ; a rich cereal grain flavor balanced with a citrus and poss. noble hops, some ""twangy"" corn (?) adjunct-type hot alcohol in the finish as well as a bit of metal, tastes like what a REAL ""malt liquor"" should taste like ; a med-full mouthfeel, but could just feel a bit thick from the bountiful co2 giving it a dry & creamy feel ; a really good beer, my first Am. dbl/imp pils, i look forward to my next & more of this style"
"The beer poured a great orange color with a huge, fluffy, egg shell colored head which stuck around for a while. Lacing was present the entire time. The beer smelled of huge hoppiness with hints of malt and citrus. Had a nice sourness(grapefruit) and citrus hint as well. The taste was similar to the nose. The maltiness was very pronounced with a nice bitterness as well. The alcohol was highly present also. The mouthfeel was a medium body with medium high carbonation. Overall this beer was good. Drastically different than your average pilsner in color and taste."
"This is probably one of the sweetest pilsners you'll encounter. Actually, it has several non pilsner characteristics so if anything else, the beer is an interest hybrid or non traditional pilsner. The beer is slightly more orangy and less pale than a typical pilsner, it has a very thick frothy head, and laces like crazy. The foamy head lingers awhile too. The aroma has sweet fruity malts, some husky smells come through too right after the pour. The taste is very chewy, some hop bite in the finish, just a fruity pilsner that is interesting. The dryish, wheat crackishness of a pilsner is lingering in the background, but there are more interesting tastes presenting themselves. This is also much more medium bodied for style, slightly more bready, more chewy, more husky grain too. The aftertaste is very mild, the mouthfeel is about right for the style. This is well worth a try if for no other reason than it is very uncharacteristic pilsner beer. L'Chaim."
"Eric"
"Nice tickle of carbonation throughout; refreshing; satisfying."
"D: This is a hearty drink that definitely fits my idea of an ""uber pils""... quite drinkable without all the blandness that sometime comes with the pilsner territory."
"this doesn't have any stand-alone ""big beer"" characteristics, but it's a great food accompaniment. i'd happily drink this again."
"An easy drinker but not my favorite of this style. This is a well rounded beer but I don't feel its anything more then slightly above average."
"M/D: i could drink this beer all day, there is a twang at the finish which is the only thing that doesn't put this beer well over the top. but man i do enjoy it."
"Dig the adherence to the pirate theme and the consistent artwork too. No Ralph Steadman, but I seriously like it."
"D: a good sipper, very malty though, I think the hop bitterness needs more playtime here."
"Interesting enough to sip on..."
"D - This is a very good pilsner."
"Overall: I enjoyed it. It wasn't overpowering, but you definitely know this is more than just a regular pilsner. If you like imperial style beers (imperial pilsners, imperial IPA's, etc.) give this one a try."
"There is nothing light about this pilsner. The brewery claims this to be the ""unofficial"" Original American Uber Pils, and to that I say congratulations. It is like taking all of the things I like in a pilsner and amplifying them, so as to better hide the less desirable traits. The best part is they have done this without making the increased alcohol stand out too much. Oh it's there, it just doesn't overpower the core ingredients. So, if you like or would like to try, a lager style beer that is full of flavor, I would recommend giving this one a try. I would certainly enjoy another."
"This is a pretty drinkable beer. It has a solidly complex taste that keeps you interested."
"D - Not as bold or alcoholic as other Imperial Pilsners I've had, which makes this one more drinkable. There's more of a balance between the malt and hops in this brew. Appearance was less than stellar, but this brew made up points in taste, mouthfeel and overall drinkability."
"Brown 12oz. bottle poured into a straight pint. Cloudy yellowish-orange straw color, that leaves a very thin head that vanishes quickly. Almost looks like a map, of white land with a lot of yellow seas. No pun intended. Nearly no lacing. Aromas of yeast and malts of the bat, almost bread-like. Very smooth flavor, a little sweet, and it tastes stronger compared to most pils. Slight hint, and by hint I mean barely there, of citrus, like just past their prime oranges. Mouthfeel is good, mild carbonation, and the flavors linger for a bit. Its very drinkable, good flavor, mild aromas, and a strong alcohol content makes this one hell of a session pils."
"D- Very easy to drink due to the light body, and the alcohol is admittedly disguised very well. I could easily drink several of these in a session if my only goal was to catch a buzz, though I couldn't see myself wanting to what with the mediocre flavor. For the same price point I would much prefer to grab a Dogfish Indian Brown Ale or 60 Minute IPA, or even a good old Sam Adams. I will not be getting this one again."
"Pours a clean golden yellow color, with a white head. In the aroma, saaz/ pilsner hops. In the taste, pilsner hops and a small sweet malt to balance it out. A small bite, yet very clean in the mouthfeel and a semi dry pilsner hop aftertaste. A nice malty pils, doesn't drink like it is 7.25%, hides the alcohol very well."
"D: Didn't want more than 1"
"A strong, powerful rendition of a Pilsner from Clipper City... Pours a hazy and cloudy appearance with decent frothy head... smell was a typical pilsner smell, fresh, slight fruity and floral notes... taste is best described as an ultra-strong pilsner... more sweet than I was anticipating, which kind of threw me off... honey and vanilla taste with fresh floral essence... no bitterness detected at all, just a honey, sugar flavor... pleasing flavor without being overbearing... 7.25% ABV is not noticeable behind a sugar-laden, rich, thick taste... pretty good mouthfeel with an average drinkability... copped a single 12 oz bottle from Total Wine and More in West Orange for a $1.79... not a bad sample at all... different and iteresting... worth a try..."
"M + D: Decent body, fairly crisp & refreshing. A hefty 7%, so not much of a gulper on a hot day unless you're actually trying to get out of mowing the lawn ;)"
"D- I could drink this beer all day long but im not sure if my liver or my body could handle it. I say about 2-3 beers a night would do it is a great beer."
"D- though actually a bock style lager, it still holds the names pils everywhere it goes. one of the best pilseners i've had, probably because i like big beers and this is UBER. i would love to try more of this style from different brewers. one thing i would like to point out is that even though 7.25 isn't all that high of an ABV, this beer gets me deee-runk! and sleepy! after 2 i feel like i've had a six pack. stumble everywhere, eventually to yonder couch. save this one for below deck, matey."
"A good beer to purchase as a variety pack!"
"Medium bodied, well carbonated and quite easy to drink. After drinking the SA Imp Pils this is a modest effort. Still enjoyable as part of the mixed 12-pack."
"D- Boozy and sweet but unique and flavorful."
"Drinkability: Quite nice. This is certainly not a typical pilsner by standards of the style. The aromas and tastes are very floral. A good beer that is worth revisiting."
"Pours a slightly fogged amber gold. Basically no head. Nose is like slightly old apples, in a very mild way. Evident metallic edge. Flavor is very meaty. Firm malt tones. Bitter overall character. Metallic back tone. Robust. Evident alcohol. After getting halfway through, I suddenly said to myself: is that vanilla?? Feel is fairly full bodied with a somewhat subdued bubble. Overall very drinkable. Well worth trying. Especially since it is such a rare style. Hard to believe that after so many beers, I would get to a style I have not tried yet."
"Pours a very clear deep gold, with a small but dense white head that leaves a fair lace. Aroma is very malty, with some alcohol, hints of hops, and some unfortunate green apple character. Hops are faint. Flavor is very malty, with a good balance from alcohol and some mild hops. Hops come through much stronger in the tail, leaving a lingering pleasant bitterness and warmth to beg for more."
"If you are looking for a big, American-made lager, here you go. Sufficiently neutral flavor profile to be very drinkable."
"D: Another exceptional creation of Clipper City -- well balanced, great mouthfeel, and thoughtfully presented. A very underrrated beer and brewery."
"D - I could do a few and would probably try it again, but I wouldn't seek this out, and if I had a choice of their brews, I'd definitely take the loose cannon. Worth a try at any rate."
"This beer pours a hazy golden yellow with a frothy white head that dissipates to wisps and no lace. The smell is dominated by sweet toasty pilsner malts. The taste is up front with bitterness, herbal and spicy german hops but is overall dominated by the taste of the pilsner malts. There is also a hint of green apple flavor. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with a touch of dryness. Overall, kind of difficult to drink and not the best Imperial Pilsner. It lacks the strong hop character of some of the other Imperial Pilsners and has some astringent characteristics that are tough to take down."
"Heck yeah. This is really good, tons of character and something new every sip. Gonna track down the rest of the Heavy Seas bunch, they're fairly common around here and I'll ignore them no more."
"The taste is very similar to the smell. It is very deep with a hint of a bite. The color brown; the beer is opaque."
"Thumbs up. Don't expect hops, but if you like the style and want the amped-up malts, absolutely go for it."
"D - While not the best beer out there its something different thats worth a try"
"Clear golden with a pinky of off-white creamy head. The aromas are floral hops, some fruit, light spice, esters jumping around, and a honey sweetness. Roasted malt and dry straw straw grains in equal amounts. A firm hop bitterness without overloading on the fruity or pine side. Some lightly metallic alcohol heat in the back but still really good for a 7.25 abv. Candy sugar sweet with a touch of honey and caramel character that builds as it warms. Medium to full body with a smooth sometimes oily mouthfeel, creamy carbonation although I was looking for thinner and crisper. Some pine, dry grains, and an herbal spice faintly like juniper for a finish."
"Taste is bitter and sweet (bittersweet?). Saaz-y and malty, this is a finely balanced but big beer. Alcohol is spicy. I enjoyed it very much. Noble hops are used wisely in this one."
"Drinkability - Very much so. Watch out for the 7% abv though."
"wow! I don't know why I put off sitting down with this one for so long. Hazy golden color with a fluffy white head that leaves some pretty good lace. Smells of nice pilsner malt, bready/biscuity as well and has a great citrusy/ floral (mostly citrus) hop character. Same as the smell, but even better, the hoppy taste is really balanced out by the nice biscuity malty flavors. Medium bodied (heavier than i would expect from a lager) and fairly silky, the carbonation is really fine, and carries this delectable beverage down the throat with an ever so slight bitter finish. Very very drinkable and enjoyable. Go B'more!!"
"D - This was a good beer overall and tasted good.."
"Golden Color with a white frothy head - what a classic beer should look like. Aroma of fresh hops and a fruity malty hint. Hoppy and fruity taste with a light malt taste. Very crisp, and clean. Smooth finish and very drinkable. Very good pilsner. Not my favorite, but a very good one."
"12 oz bottle pours a turbid amber body with a small and soapy looking white head. Lacing is minimal. Aroma is sharp and spicy hops and a wet doughy maltiness. Body is light medium with moderate carbonation. Taste is spicy pepper, bready and grainy malt with a caramel sweetness and a hint of lemon and orange. Alcohol is sensed but well hidden, overall. Good drinkability. Enough complexities to want to sample again."
"Thanks gabe for pouring this one for me at the Charlotte Oktoberfest. This may be my first double/imperial pilsner so a bit hard to compare it. Can definitely tell its higher alcohol content as it warms the throat. Lots of hops and spices. Light golden color with avergae carbonation and head retention. I think I can find this for $2.50 a bottle and will probably try it again."
"A decent beer that fills a niche in the market. Recommended over just about any macro pils, but not especially interesting. Certainly worth keeping a 6 pack on hand."
"Drinkability - delicious with some LaRosa's pizza; I could easily salt away several of these."
"This one wasn't bad...but as a standard pilsner. I certainly didn't get an old bottle as it's labled best by November 2007. Give this one a bit more flavour and punch if you want to label it an Uber Pils."
"Even the pilsners are cleanup hitters with this brewery! Two-inch head that dissipates, leaving slightly consistent tracings...pale gold, slightly bubbly body in a willibecker...strong banana (?) notes...heavy malt with a hint of fruit/perfumy aromas--intriguing....HEAVY impressions...lagerish weight in a light pilsner character: an imposter? comfortably medium taste--not at all an indictment of alcohol...overall, a refreshing brew that will fool many with a false sense of pleasure...personally, tough to want a pilsner with this much alcohol, but the balance the C.C. brewers attempt to achieve is approximating a success"
"This is a pretty solid and tasty beer, and while I'm not generally a fan of pilsners, I would drink this over a standard offering."
"D - Very drinkable for a double pilsner. Nice balance of sweetness and hops."
"Small Craft Warning pours a clear yellow with a thin head that only appeared after I poured the last third of the bottle rather vigorously. The aroma is big fresh herbal and citrusy noble hops. There is a nice sweet and slightly fruity pilsner malt aroma in background. Flavor is more of the same. It is nice and balanced, with crisp hop flavor in the foreground for sure, but not over the top. The bitterness is well balanced by the sweet pilsner malts. The beer is nice and refreshing, especially for its strength."
"Overall- This is 1 hell of a Pilsner! Watch out, at 7+% alc, this can get a little boozy."
"This pilsner pours a clear clean golden color, the highly carbonated brew is capped with a sparse splotchy head. No lacing. Nose is bready malt, not much else. Taste is again the bready malt countered with faint hops. A touch of caramel and a slight fruit note as the taste diminishes. Mouthfeel despite all of the malt factors is fairly clean and finishes dry. A fairly drinkable brew, though I was hoping for more."
"A good beer from Clipper City."
"Rich golden color body, slightly hazy, topped by a thin head. Aroma is slightly sweet with a hint of noble-type hops. Flavor is surprisingly smooth, notable malts and a slight caramel note before a dry, Italian bread finish. Bitterness has an herbal quality to it. Reminds me of a good, solid homebrewed Pils. A little extra kick and body, but much smoother than many beers. Mouthfeel is very good, creamy yet effervescent. Drinkability is also surprisingly good. Actually somewhat of a refreshing beer for the moderate ABV is packs. Hop flavor lingers a bit, but it's a nice flavor - not the woody or catty lingering note some persistent beers offer. Clipper City is offering some fine beers in their Heavy Seas lineup."
"Light to medium body with tangy hoppiness. Smooth with a juicy mouthwatering hop bite making me crave more. Could drink quite a few of these beers. The best beer i've had so far from Clipper City."
"D - This is a very unique brew that IMO seems like a hybrid of two styles; a peppery, flowery, crackery German pils and a juicy, hoppy oily IPA. All I know is that whatever they were going for works for me. I will buy this again for sure! It's an interesting way to get a good dose of hops while straying from the tried and true IPA path. Good stuff!"
"D- This is a sweet double pilsner. I expected a little bit more of a refreshing hop kick but the malty sweetness is excellent. Alcohol is barely noticable in this brew and it is something that I will revisit. The last brew to try from my heavy seas sampler and I really enjoyed 3/4 of the beers. I'm looking foreward to trying more from the heavy seas lineup in the future."
"D: Incredibly enjoyable, and delightfully unique. Worth a try."
"Will drink another."
"Pours an orangey copper with a decent head that eventually vanishes. Aroma is thick with hops, pine needles. Taste has a sweet malt backbone, honey-like taste with a big dash of citrusy hop bitterness. Resembles a pale ale except for its sweetness, and this brew has a more noticeable alcohol characteristic."
"Part of a variety pack picked up at Total Wine in Columbia, SC. Pours a great looking amber gold color with a nice fluffy head that quickly diminished. Nice citrusy hop aroma. Taste slightly sweet and bready with a clean hop bitterness. Simple and well balanced, this is one good brew. Real refreshing on a hot summer day."
"A deep golden color with a one inch head forming, that slowly fades to a quater inch and settles there along the glass. Bread and yeast fragrances come out right away, then this fruity ester comes foward, bring some spicy and citrusy hop aromas along the way. The flavor of the bread and yeast are right there at the start, then this gradual bit of bitterness begins to come out and balances everything out. Medium bodied, surprisingly, I expected it to be on the watery side, not that this is a bad thing. This is an easy to drink beer, the alchol level does push it out session beer status. But, hey if it is a hot day, I hope I find one of these in my fridge."
"Drank very easy, a very good double pils"
"Clipper City Über Pils works better as a English or Belgian strong blonde ale than as a pilsner. For the double pilsner category I much prefer the offerings from Rogue and Dogfish Head. But this is still satisfactory, although between the alcohol content and the over-the-top maltiness, drinkability suffers."
"Drinkability: the alcohol sneaks up on this one. At 7% ABV, it's unbelievably easily drinkable. Reminds me of a strong Pale Ale."
"This is a ""double"" pilsner? Standard versions of Warsteiner or Pilsner Urquell have more flavor. A big let-down."
"Pours a slightly cloudy golden yellow color, nice carbonation, nice small off-white head, nice sticky lacing to follow. The nose is mostly malty, slight hops, bready, spices, and some caramel. The taste is malty, hoppy, some spices, and caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, not a bad brew, glad to have had a chance to try it."
"I could drink a couple more of these if I wanted too. All in all a nice example of this style."
"Usually a strong hoppy pilsner is something I want to stay away from, but this one seems to be well balanced considering the strong amount of hoppiness. It's American Styling throughout, and it's like the lager equivalent of a strong American Pale Ale, or maybe a modest American IPA."
"Overall: I was really pleased with this one. And now I feel like I have to try the others from these guys. If they are even close to as good as this one, I will be VERY impressed."
"Edit: Hmm. The last half of the bottle had a huge head. It is diminishing fairly quickly but not instantly. Well, hey. Another plus, I guess."
"Another beer from my sampler pack. This beer poured a hazy gold with some reddish highlights little to no head. Smelled of fruit and with a little hint of a dirty rag and the glass didn't smell like that before the beer, so I will have to take off .5 for that, otherwise the fruity scent is decent. Tastes slightly sweet, picked up some apple and a woody taste. Decent beer. Heavy Seas isn't bad, I suggest the sampler pack to find out your favorites and at $16 for a 12 pack, it's well worth it."
"I'm a big fan of the Heavy Seas mixed twelve - all beers are consistent, well-rounded in variety, and are crafted above average."
"Pours a remarkably clear dark straw color with a nice half inch of big openly bubbly head. Aromas abound with tons of crystal sweet malts, with little in the way of hop aroma. It's got the nice pils aroma with a little saaz but just a lot more malt complexity going on; which I imagine the higher alcohol helps heighten. On the palate, again the toasty, slightly buttery malt and yeast profile come bursting through the tight threshhold of hops. It has a very big body but is able to still finish quite dry. Unlike other Uberpils, I think this one is still able to BE a pilsener, not just another DIPA. Though style is still blurred with this one, it is nonetheless a very drinkable beer. It lacks some footholds in certain areas, esp the hop character (I'm drinking it only 1 month before it's ""purchase by"" date)."
"Drinkability: Tastes more like a slightly hoppy bock than a double pilsner, to be honest; while there is considerable style drift, this is a nice, drinkable beer; I would mark it higher in a different category"
"Heavy Seas Small Craft Warning (Uber Pils) pours a light copper color with a nice white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. Nice, strong, assertive hoppy aroma. Full bodied, hop flavor from beginning to end. Malt is definitely a background player here. I like it."
"drinkability: pretty good"
"Drinkability very good, easy drinking, nothing to really find a fault with."
"Pours a golden amber color with a thin white head that quickly turns into a ring of lace. The aroma features a nice balance of grain and some nice fresh spicy and citrusy hops. The taste starts out with a faint smooth malt flavor with the hops providing a nice presence in the finish. Overall, this beer was a pleasant surprise as it is a nice deviation from your typical pilsner. Definately worth a try."
"Overall, one of the better beers from Clipper city. Very well made, and quite easy to drink. It is surprising how much alcohol is packed in there for such a light flavored beer. This give me a renewed respect for clipper city. I'll buy it again, and it's definitely worth a try."
"Recently had the opportunity to try a few Heavy Seas offerings, thanks to Todd the beer guy at McKean and Charles. Good place to buy beer, and Todd is very informative. This beer had a freshness date of Sept 2007, and was poured into a pilsener glass. It was a hazy orange color, with a small white head. Sweet, grainy aroma. Pretty bready taste, with some late hops. Solid malty mouthfeel, very drinkable."
"A nice broad flavor in the sip, with piney hops but well rounded. Some buttery and oily notes complement the malt flavors and help lead to a clean finish and makes this beer easy to drink. Maybe a tiny touch of alcohol in the opening of each sip but nothing that decreases your enjoyment. This is a pleasureable beer and worth looking out for."
"Don't drink and review."
"This is an odd call, but its an odd genre. One might almost guess Pale Ale or even a IPA in some regards. I do think food would help it a lot, and in hindsight it could probably be paired quite well with anything a PA or IPA works with and provide a different experience due to its style. Not my cup of tea, er, beer, but not bad, but yet also not really good. I would like to try it again with food. Certainly worth trying, especially if you can pair it with food or in warmer weather. An odd beer, but one I would drink again. Check it out."
"D: Easy drinking, but not the best of this style - I'll try another, if its bought for me..."
"12oz brown bottle purchased as part of a multi-pack at Florian's. Translucent amber body with a half inch of off-white head that leaves a small amount of lacing. Smells like apricot and caramel malt with hints of yeast. Tastes like caramel malt with supporting citrus hops. Rich sweetness dominates the flavor. Seems like a hint of mint in this brew too. Full flavor is complimented by a creamy mouthfeel and a moderate amount of carbonation. Overall a well-made drinkable beer."
"D/Comment: So-so. Maybe it's not that the hop flavor is particularly overpowering rather the hop combination just creates a taste I don't care for (maybe the tettang). My palate isn't schooled enough yet to pin this down. But I think that is the problem with this beer for me. The off hop flavor hurts the drinkability. I would not have this beer again but it has piqued my interest in the style."
"Poured a orange copper color with a nice white head. No real lacing present in the glass. Head disapated quite quickly. Freshness date clearly on the lable. Smelled of dough like malt with a citrus hop tone in the back ground. It also has a caramel malt sweetness mixed in. Taste was rather sweet with some hop bite in the back of the mouth. Nice balance of malt and hop bitterness. Its well rounded flavor reminds me of an ESB but with a bit less body. Nice offering and really easy drinking. I would certainly like to try it again."
"Pours a dark golden color with a little murkiness. Small head dissipates quickly and leaves no lacing. Smell is spun sugar and bready malts. Taste is malty sweetness with an excellent hop component that gives just enough bitter to wash down the sweetness and make the finish clean and dry. Very pleasant light mouthfeel. Highly drinkable. I could probably drink these all night. Will buy a six pack next time I can find a fresh one!"
"I have never had a Double Pilsner before, I usually reach for ales. This pours a nice amber with a thick head. The nose is not very strong but is pleasant. The mouthfeel is almost creamy, it seems to coat my tongue, very nice. The taste is rich, you can tell there are real grains/malts in here. The hops are very present almost like an british IPA. I am glad I have a 6-pack of this, but I am not sure I will buy more. At the same time, I would be happy to drink again if someone else is buying :) Definitely worth trying."
"Pours a clear golden, nice lacing all over, white head, good retention. Smell is sweet, caramel, very clean floral/citrus hops, yeast, little bit of funk in there, nice though. Taste is very malty, caramel, citrus and floral, some alcohol, real clean finish, nice bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with low carbonation. Only double pilsner I've had that actually tastes like a normal pilsner, nice character."
"Overall impression: Dangerous - this one tastes good, highly drinkable, and higher than average ABV. Very nice."
"Pours a great looking gold with fluffy head that diminished to a few bubbles on top and good lacing. I've been trying some simpler beers lately to clear the palete and find some good solid brews for hot summer days. This fits that bill, a solid malt taste, no adjunct and a nice clean bitterness from hops in the finish. Simple and well balanced, this is the stuff I wish macro lager drinking friends of mine would start buying, High quality well balanced beer."
"The 7.5% will sneak up on you. Go for it!! I'm not usually one for this style, but this is the best Clipper City product in my mind (almost hate to say it)"
"A nice offering. This one is a great beer to match with dim sum. Worth picking up at your local store in an effort to try a style without many offerings."
"D - For a beer of 7% ABV, this seems like it'd be a great session beer. A great lager that can be enjoyed any time of the year."
"This is a very nice brew, Pours to a golden color with a fairly good sized off whiter head that has good retention and did leave a little lacing at the top of the glass. The aromas that are noticeable to me are toasted malts that also seem to give off a bready smell. Also noticeable are the hops that meld in nicely giving off an aroma that is not dominant but is a great accompaniment. The taste is very nice, has a smooth feel to it along with flavors of a lot of malt, yeast and hops. The malts seem to give the toasted tastes that where identified in the aroma while the yeast I think give it the bread like flavors. The hops give a nice juicy like flavor that seem to be more along the lines of citrus but not like the flavors from a cascade hop. The hop flavor while noticeable is not dominating the beer, just like in the aroma, I think it adds a lot to this beer. Some folks who love strong dominant hops might think that more would be warranted but I feel it is better this way as it adds to the whole experience. This is probably my second fav from Clipper behind the Loose Cannon but depending on the time of the year this possibly would be my number one."
"Another good effort by Clipper City."
"An uber pils huh? Sounds good to me. I'm not a huge pilsner guy but this is quite good. Pours a cloudy copper color with a billowy white head that leave nice lacing. Smells a bit like a pale ale. Hoppy, florally and citrusy. Taste is nice. Hops provide a nice bitterness. Lemony and grassy. Very fresh. Malty on the backend with some sweetness. Very smooth. Highly drinkable. Overall a good beer to have on a hot summer night."
"The beer pours a golden color with a thick frothy white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice malty scent that boasts of pale and Munich malts. It's dry with lager yeast aromas. The taste is good. It has a smooth malty flavor that goes down easy and finishes with some residual sweetness and warmth. It also has a nice hop finish that compliments the high malt and alcohol content. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn fine brew. It's smooth and easy drinking despite the elevated abv."
"good drinkability despite a high amount of hop flavor, it's ends up being pretty balanced really despite the fact that it seems like a lot of hops were used."
"d-A very solid brew and for the most part very tasty.My only gripe is the thickness of it, the hops and malts blend together perfectly.Sold brew indeed,great job Clipper seas"
"D - This is my first double pilsner, so it's difficult to judge it against others of the same style, but I have to say that it was very enjoyable. It would make for an excellent substitute for a DIPA if you're not quite in the mood for all those hops. I'm going to look for more doubles and see if they are all this tasty."
"Worth while and a good pick if you want something a little beyond your average pilsner. The fact that this is one of the more entertaining lagers makes me up it on my list a bit. + Merry xmas 06!!!"
"Everything labelled double pilsner I have enjoyed, including this restrained clean and refreshing pilsner. Complex and great with food, restrained on the palate. I would have this regular if I could, thank you for bringing back Dr. Jay. As a European strong lager it is amazing no less."
"Wish I had a couple more but they don't sell it around here that I have seen."
"Not like any other pilsner I've had. Smells like an IPA, tastes like...nothing else I've tasted, really. Highly drinkable and a pleasure to smell."
"Drinkability, no problem, like I said, all year round."
"Overall an ass-kickerrific pilsner. This is a man's man brew. Thanks to Aprilluvsbeer, my new best friend, for this one."
"First sip was sweet, lemony, with floral hints. But it left a ""lemon pledge"" transient flavor. It had a light bitter finish that included a slight graininess. Mouthfeel was pleasant enough, medium-bodied. Overall, in spite of the unfamiliar (peculiar?) flavors, it was pretty drinkable. Uber drinkable? I'm not sure... I've had pilsners that I enjoyed a lot more (lots more HOP presence!), but this would still worth some more tries, a little more research definitely is called for."
"Interesting. The yellow/gold appearance is complimented by a generous, tan head. The nose is floral with hints of lemon and biscuits. The taste is bit like tea, with some citrus notes. There is a definite malt presence with hints of toasted bread and crackers. Mouthfeel is quite smooth. Drinkability is excellent. I could see myself sneaking a few of these on a cold, December evening."
"A very tasty pilsner. Flavor is balanced with a sur[rising amount of crisp hoppiness. A solid brew."
"Pours a deep gold color with a fairly large 1.5 inch head that stuck around. Aroma was flowery and hoppy, not citrusy like Casacade hops, but more grassy in character. Sweet malts were also noted in the aroma. Taste was of noble hops, bready malt and a little bit of alcohol. This is definitely a pilsner. Hop bitterness was low, but just enough to balance out the sweetness of the malt. The Saaz hops really stand out with this beer. Mouthfeel was light to medium making this a very drinkable beer and a good thirstquencher. I'm normally not a big fan of the pilsner style, but this one is damn good and one that I'll be purchasing regularly."
"The high alcohol is hidden very well and gives a good clean aftertaste."
"Pour a deep golden yellow with expressive carbonation and slight haze due to bottle conditioning. Dense three finger head is soapy and shows stubborn retention and sticky patches of lacing. Mostly noble hop nose, floral and grassy, with plenty of pale malt aromas and a hint of apple ester. Highly sweet upfront; a high-gravity pale malt flavor, follwed by assertive, cidery alcohol taste and finally pungent german hops. The hop flavor is more prominenet in the semi-dry aftertaste; bountiful spicy Saaz character and floral Hallertau flavor also impart a dryness that helps break-up the cloying sweetness of the malt. The medium body with a perculular ""light-syrupy"" texture is interesting, and the medium-level carbonation is very subtle and smooth, although fine and abundant. Finishes with some residual pale malt and apple ester but is well-balanced by voracious German hop biterness. Not much of a session lager, as the off-flavors and hop bite limit it's drinkability, but a real treat for die-hard Pilsener fans looking for something more."
"Drinkability: All around, its a decent strong lager, but it failed to deliver the bitterness I was expecting."
"A very average beer, less taste, which was certainly above average. Very glad I tried this."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pilsener glass. Appearance is a crystal clear bright golden color with a puffy white full finger of foamy head that quickly fades to a light ring of whitish lacing. Taste is sweet and malty with some bready notes, slightly spicy hops at the end. Grainy undertones, light sugary alcohol warmth also present in the slightly drying aftertaste. Mouthfeel is light bodied with moderate carbonation, very light in character. Makes for a excellent thirst-quenching beer with appreciable mild complexity. Very drinkable, excellent pilsener, would recommend purchasing."
"Came from the tap a light amber color with a thin white head. Moderate sweet malt essence with a light citrus hop finish with the end taste having a good combination of malt and hops, reminding me somewhat of an IPA, but short. Refreshing taste considering the alcohol content. A pretty good beer which I would like to drink again."
"DA: one the tastiest Pils I've had in a long time!"
"Got this in Paducah at Roof Brothers as a sampler pack for 20 bucks."
"While this is a very interesting beer, the heavy use of non-noble American hops in such high quantity gives it an oily residue that detracts from a clean finish. Also, the high gravitiy of this pils gives too much play to the alcohol. This is difficult to accept in a pilsner. Otherwise, the brewer did an excellent job in making a unique American Lager."
"Mouthfeel- A little dry but very cohesie with foods. Went well with both leftover roast beef and chicken panini with rice."
"Although I don't ordinarily go for Pilsners or light lagers, I am not disappointed with this purchase. I'd like to see what this is like on tap, and to see how much of the skunk I smell had to do with age. My suspicion is that the beer was fresh enough and that the olfactory tinge was part of the intended package."
"dont know much about what an uber pills is supposed to be, this is an ok not for me beer with only a couple problems."
"Pours a dirty straw yellow with a massive white head that retains impressively. The aroma is hoppy initially, with a big floral and spicy presence, along with some biscuit like malt, grain husk, and some ethanol. The flavor is a little less agressive, with some mild floral and spicy hops, a big graininess, some alcohol and metallic notes. The mouthfeel is slick with descent drinkability. A descent imperial pilsner, nothing extraordinary here."
"Overall- There is no doubt this brew provides interest for discussion. It is a shame that the members were not in the same room to drink this one together and discuss. Of course there have been several club selections for which this would have been nice."
"Many thanks to Aprilluvsbeer for the possibilities."
"Note- This is my first review so take it for what it's worth."
"Pours a beautiful pale golden-orange, with very little haze and thin head with large bubbles that lingers around leaving only slight lace. The aroma is gorgeous, sweet, malty, and bright, and just very appealing to me. The taste overall was smooth and malty, a bit sweet, but beautifully balanced by the hops, with little indication of the 7.5% ABV. The medium body is creamy and malty. I didn't know what to expect of an Uber Pils, and although I have to say it tastes a bit more like a strong ale then a larger, I think it is an excellent beer, and one that I will definitely be drinking again whenever I can."
"Great choice , something I would never have purchased. Id like to try another selection from this brewery."
"I couldn't drink six in a sitting, because of the surprising sweetness--but I could drink four. It would pair great with spicy or grilled foods. I'm glad I know where to get more of this, and I will."
"Surprising that a beer this crisp still has a bit of sweetness in the close, but overall a very good approach on an imperial pils."
"Drinkability is decent as it wont take your breath away but also doesnt linger too long. Mouthfeel is average, dry and ..eh..."
"Overall, this is a very interesting take on the pilsner. The alcohol warms the belly for sure. I definitely wouldn't call this a summer pils, but it tastes pretty good on a fall night. I'd love to try this on tap sometime."
"Acquired in ""These go to eleven...a bif"" from goodbyeohio. Notched as best by Jan '07."
"Very full bodied, rich and thick  even a little oily in the mouth. Very nice brew, Im looking forward to a few more of these  hell, at $8 six packs these make for a good drinkin brew."
"I will not drink this one again."
"Very good pilsner. Usually not the greatest pilner fan, but I've made the exception for this brew. Simply sweetened with bready / earthy pilner malts and balanced well with German earthy hops. Lightly lemony and citrusy with a light and round mouthfeel. A noticible alcohol flavor and warmth adds depth without becomming a distraction. Might make for a good cross-over beer."
"The label states ""Purchase before Oct 06"". Check. Pours a clear golden color with lots of streaming bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass. Fluffy white head. Looks very appealing, and refreshing. Grassy, floral and slightly sulfurous in the aroma. Great head retention, along with some patches of laced on the sides of the glass. Big amount of pale malt. Not as clean as I had hoped for. Good amount of grassy hops, with some sweetness. Some floral hops close in at the end. Medium body. Overall not bad, but a bit rough."
"Another beer from the heavy seas mix pack i bought. This one pours out orange with a large head that turns creamy on top. smells malty, with european hops and some wet yeast odor. Taste is very smooth, mildly spicy, malty and fresh. Balanced, and heavy for a pils, but thats why they call it an ""Uber Pils"" i guess. Quite good...drinkability probably its best characteristic."
"I'm not a pilsner fan. I wouldn't go out of my way for this beer because of that preferencet. If you like pilsners, but want just a little more ...heft... , by all means seek high and low for this, and try it if you see itl!"
"Cheers!"
"O= I'd drink a few of these easily, or session, or great for a party or dining with friends."
"i think the beauty of a nice pils is totally hijacked by this style. my expectation of pilsners is a clean malt that crisply sets up hops. this is just too sugary. one style that ""imperial"" or ""double"" just doesn't belong in front of"
"-Oelergud"
"All in all its worth getting and trying."
"Pours an orange color with a two finger width head that leaves some lacing on the glass. Smell starts off with some crisp hops and some malt. Taste is a very crisp and clean maltyness that finishes with some nice hop bitterness that is slightly oily. The mouthfeel is good for a double pilsner, very heavy in the mouth and sits well on the tongue. A very drinkable beer."
"A pretty good strong sipper."
"Basically, not bad at all but in my opinion could be a little more hoppy for maximum enjoyment."
"D: The aftertaste is sort of bugging me. I feel like it wasn't put together well, this isn't a flavor you strive for (in my opinion). I'll pass in the future."
"Bottled in November 2005 (review was written in March '06), clearly labelled, nicely done. It pours a pale gold with good clarity and a fairly thick white head. A steady stream of carbonation makes its way to the top of the glass. The aroma is dominated by a maltiness with some grassy hops. The taste is dominated by a malt base and just has a touch of grassy hops. It has a sweetness to it that isn't balanced enough by a bitterness as a pilsner should. There is a very strange taste that asserts itself, but I can't tell if it's an odd hop flavor or if it's coming from the malt. Either way it obstructs the pilsner taste that should be there. The mouthfeel is a bit sticky and thick. The drinkability suffers due to the strange taste and a residual sweetness that builds up over the course of the glass. This was a pretty disappointing beer."
"12 oz. bottle. True gold in color, very clear. Moderate head with a strong pour. Aroma was excellent, with the hops coming through as a pine scent, then some nice malt/yeast aroma. Taste was pretty good as well, with a balance between the malt and the hops, although the hops did come on a little stronger. Mouthfeel was lively and well carbonated. Unfortunately, for me, something intangible is missing, and I did not perceive this as something I wanted more of. The only thing I could put my finger on was that I like the malt to be less noticeable in this style."
"A quality imperial pils, hides the alcohol very well, fun to chew on, just a little too single-track with the flavors. Doesn't quite live up to the marketing (or maybe it does, depending on who's drinking), but worth grabbing if available. Yay for Charm City."
"Taste is of bitter citrus hops. Biting grapefruit-like hops. Rich crisp malt. Long hops finish. Full bodied beer. A good imperial pilsener and reasonably priced to boot. Good stuff."
"Color is darker than I expected much closer to a copper than straw, maybe a little orange. The smell is also more hoppy than I though, is this what makes it uber? First impresssion of the taste is bready malts. The flavor is very pronounced yet lacks the hop pack that the aroma implied. Also, it finishes quite sweet. Hops come through and add another layer of flavor as it warms. Mouthfeel is thick and full. Decent rew but dont go out of your way to seek it out."
"Pours gold to peach in color and very clear. Sweet grass, hay aromas. Sweet light malt taste is well balanced with a crisp bitterness. Nothing overpowering here, just a simple well balanced pilsner. I cannot discern any alcohol in the taste and have a hard time believing this is 7.5% for how balanced and how light the maltiness is. I could definitely enjoy a few of these back to back."
"Good beer and drinkable. I'd say I could session to this one, but now that I see the alcohol content... okay maybe I'll still session to this one."
"One of my favorite summer beers over here on the East coast, also one of the most drinkable American double Pilsners out there. Highly recommended."
"Pours into my glass a golden- copper color with a bit of white head; darker than any standard pils I've seen. Smells slightly floral. Taste gives me a bit of spicy grapefruit, but more spice than fruit/ citrus, and not overdone. A nice crisp refreshing grain character. Feels heavier than a standard pils in the mouth, but compared to the ABV, nice and crisp, going down fairly smooth. a little too easy to have a few, but still not a ""drink a six pack watching the ballgame"" beer."
"D: High drinkability. Not very heavy even though its a double pils. I would have this again or anything else from CC as they've impressed me lately."
"Small Craft Warning pours a pale gold color with a fair amount of haze. It produces a solid head and a lot of lacing. The aroma is serious Saaz hops, with an underlying earthy maltiness. A little musty with some bread-like qualities are also in the aroma, with a whiff or two of alcohol. The foretaste is sweet, very sweet. The sweetness has a pils malt flavor, and is balanced with a lot of hops. The beer has a heavy, almost syrupy feel to it, and could stand for a crisper finish. The hops are spicy and very flavorful, though. On the whole, this is a solid and enjoyable beer. Full of flavor and very aggressive."
"I was skeptical about this at first, but it won me over. Pours a light gold with a sticky head and endless upward stream of bubbles. The aroma is quite spicy, but the hops have a fruity character that indicates something aside from Saaz hops were used. The flavor of this beer is quite nice. It starts off bitter, then veers toward dextrin sweetness before moving back to bitter again. Throughout all this, the beer displays a spice profiile unlike other pilsners I've had. Mouthfeel is thick and round throughout, and the only drawback to drinkability is the ABV. Overall, an excellent pilsner that I'd definitely have again."
"D: Very easy to drink for an Uber-Pils. Drinks like a normal pilsner. Alcohol is low enough (for me) that it may be considered a single pilsner. Great to session as the weather warms up."
"D - Excellent. I am not much of pilsner fan, but this was well done. No way around it. It is strong, yet still sessionable. I am starting to respect Clipper City's Heavy Sea's line more and more with every beer I try."
"I came upon this brew randomly and usually don't drink a pilsner, but will be buying a good amount throughout the upcoming summer."
"Drinkability: I could drink this all day. I am more inclined to call it a pils vs double pils, but why quibble when it goes down smooth?"
"D - Aside from the kicked up alcohol, this double pilsener is a good drinker. However, I prefer a little less kick from my pilseners so I can drink and be refreshed by more than the one you should stick to when imbibing this particular brew."
"Goes down really easy, but this does get a bit sweet. Boozey at times but I really liked this. Seems like it could split the skull pretty easily though..."
"I'll take another thanks."
"One of the best of the Heavy Seas line. Very good for everyday drinking when you are looking for something that is not so in your face, but yet is interesting and packs a punch."
"All in all a nice drinkable beer. Measured by Pilsner standards it's got a very light clean malt body but was a bit lacking in the hops. Perhaps ""Über"" means ""almost"" in a language similar to Czech..."
"D - fantastic brew, would love to have this during the summer as an alternative to lighter pilsners. Seems like an interesting hybrid between an IPA and a pilsner."
"Throws a pale yellow in color, with a sticky white head. Mild carbonation. Very nice aromaspicy hops and citrus (lemon peel and oranges). A large come and go blast of juicy hops combined with sweet malts. The body is sufficient and will offer up some wheat malt and bread dough type flavorings. Crisp herbal notes and day old grapefruit juice resides on the palate. Very nicely done."
"Overall, smooth and drinkable. Almost exactly what I'd expect of a classic Pils taken to a higher gravity. If were slightly lighter-bodied, I'd call it excellent."
"12 oz. with Nov. '05 notched, but another 3 months can only do so much damage to 7.5% right? It pours into the pilsner glass a hazed gold that is unfiltered and bottle-conditioned, and is paler toward the bottom of the glass. It has fairly good visible carbonation and a 1 finger off-white head that slowly recedes and leaves lots of nice lacing. One bottle produced a head so dense you could poke at it and it would move - never seen a head that thick on a pilsner. It smells of citric and piney hops with notes of malts and perhaps a vinous quality. The taste is about the same with a decent bitterness, some fruitiness, and a medium body that is pretty smooth and leaves a medium finish. Pretty tasty, but I bet it tastes better when fresh. Seems like a good style but I need to find other examples."
"12oz. is the proper size serving for this beer- any more and it could get cloying pretty quickly. As a one shot deal this is good stuff indeed on its own, but when paired with real smoked BBQ it becomes more of a quaffer."
"Reviewed from detailed notes. A gift of Higravity ala SS'05. Thanks so much for the opportunity! Poured a 3-finger pillowy banana-meat-colored head. The liquid was slightly cloudy and slightly particulated and light apricot in color. Smelled of honey and flowers. Hallertauer hops is my guess. Orange essence. Tasted oranges, woody drying finish. Nice and crisp. Some hop bitter that combines nicely with a hint of carb sting. Some alcohol flavor? I wonder if it's just flat hop co-ho. I'll have to check the ABV when I type this in. Light body with a chewy character. Md carbonation. Substantial lacing. A bit hoppier than I was expecting, but enjoyable."
"Drinkability: Easily dispatched with here. The ""double"" billing, while somewhat undefined stylistically, seems to detract from the more refreshing nature of the pilsner style, but this is good nonetheless."
"This beer poured a dull straw color, topped by a thick off-white colored head. Nice aroma. Nobel hops give this a mild citrus aroma backed by a touch of fresh hay and hop flower. Just a hint of sweetness in the nose. Nice mild bitterness up front. A little orange citrus, not sweet, just fruity. The malt shows mid taste with a bit more sweetness. This really presents itself as a dry IPA. Nice balance of the citrus hop, and a mild sweetness that cuts the bitterness. Slick and full mouth feel with just a touch of alcohol heat. It does hide the ABV well. Nice beer. A great alternative to an IIPA."
"This is easily drinkable for 7 months past the ""best by"" date. I can only imaginge that it used to have some hop character in it's younger days. I will be on the lookout for some fresh stock...."
"Things started a little rocky, but the ship righted itself on the palate. Smelling more like a bock, the flavor brought the craft safely into port. Perhaps the big presence started things askew, because initially I wasn't clear where it was headed. On flavor alone it's quite drinkable, but the overall impression brings the sail down the mast slightly. Still, I'd have no real issue partaking in the future, should it sail my way again."
"875"
"Nicely drinkable especially for a Double Pilsner. Very good flavor without getting harsh and no detectable alcohol. Only fault is the weird thickness to this. Still I would gladly drink a second one."
"Big foamy head, a little deeper yellow than most pilsners, maybe uber-yellow. Nice crisp pilsner saaz scent. A little fruity, very saazy. Big and bold, a little bready. Smoth and easy to drink, a little tart. I like this one, one to seek out again."
"Starts off with a thick, creamy, off-white head that is fed by streams of carbonation. Golden straw colored beer is just slightly hazy. Aroma reminds me of candied grapefruit with whiffs of alcohol here and there, but a bit disappointing since I was expecting more herbal/spicy hops. Sugar coated citrus up front that dries out quickly. I swear there is a caramel sweetness towards the end, but it's mild and overcome by the bitter peppery finish. Compared to Sam Adams Imperial Pilsner this one didn't quite make the leap from IIPA. It's a tasty, inviting brew of which I'd be happy to drink several."
"Drinkability: nicely drinkable, but overall I did not get overly excited with the flavor."
"Uber tasty."
"This pours a yellowish golden color with a nice 2 finger head.This is a real good looking beer.The smell is biscuit like,like walking into a bakery.There is also a slight floral scent to this beer.The taste is a creamy,citrus filled,lemon?,floral,and yeast flavor to this.The m/f is heavier than I thought with a hoppy aftertaste.This is very ale like,not bad,but not the best I ever had."
"This was a nice clear blond beer but there was very little head. The smell is very faint, not bad or good, it just smells like any lager. The taste is mild also, slightly sweet with a tasty hop presence. It is not as bitter as I expected, but the hops do a good job of keeping the sweetness at bay. The mouthfeel is nice and thick for a pilsner. The alcohol doesn't seem as high as it is. It is very drinkable. In the summer I will definitely seek this one out."
"Mouthfeel of this beer is good. It is medium/light bodied and therefore is not heavy on the palate. It has an average amount of carbonation that nicely compliments the taste of this beer. As to the drinkability, I have to say that I do like this beer and would buy it agiain. It is very easy to drink and goes down very easily and smoothly."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1 1/2"" off-white head above the clear golden brew. Pillowy head lasts nicely, with sparse delicate lacing. Aroma is pale malts and crisp hops. Taste is upfront with biscuity pale malt sweetness, balanced and then overcome by prickly hops flavor. Mouthfeel could be a tad smoother, but still a nice brew, and drinkability is pleasing as well, especially for the abv. Always a good brew to have if you can find it."
"Pours a bright golden hue with a good inch of stark white, creamy head on top. Appealing aroma of spicy floral hops, light citrus, and a touch of biscuity sweetness. Palate strikes a good balance between a the light sweetness of the malt and the tanginess of the assertive hops. A hint of lemon also makes an appearance before a fairly astringent finish. The relatively light, crisp body belies the alcohol content of this beer, making it dangerously drinkable. I'm a fan."
"The beer with four names: Clipper City Heavy Seas Small Craft Warning Uber Pils is highly recommended. I can easily say its the best pilsner I've ever had."
"One word sums up this brew: MALT. And wads of it. Pours out to a hazy gold color similar to a well made belgian. Nice 1/2 inch head and traces of lace. Medium low level of carbonation. Aromas of malt dominate, with some notes of hops. Taste is similar; flavors of malt are powerful, with some floral hops and a breadiness character that adds to the depth, which would be nearly one sided otherwise. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and almost chewy due to the heavy maltiness. Drinkability is average; this is a good beer, but borders on malty overdose. Recommended for malt addicts and pilsner lovers."
"Id get this one again"
"12 oz bottle pours a hazy dark yellow color with a decent creamy white head that doesn't last long, some lacing in my glass. Mostly citrus in the aroma, sweet bread, honey and lemon flavors. Medium to full bodied with a slick, smooth mouthfeel, finishes on the dry side."
" Taste seemed sweet at first, but quickly becomes completely balanced. A big and refreshing malt flavor comes first, then the citric hops. The first Pilsner I actually enjoy. Mouthfeel is crisp, although a little thick. I wish I had another. Thanks to meathookjones for the trade."
"A golden amber coloered beer has a slight haze. There is a small creamy off white head with good lace. The aroma has a strong grapfruit hop character with a light grain malt background. At first sip it seems like a slightly malty pils. but the hop gradually grow on the back of your tongue. Making for an interesting bitter grapfruit hop finish."
"Drinkability- alcohol is hidden well making this a dangerous brew. A real treat, I was suprised by this beer it's only the second clipper city offering that I've tried and I'm impressed."
"Drinkability & Notes  The alcohol is barely noticeable, and the body is light, very drinkable if all I want is some alcohol in my bloodstream. Pretty good for what it is, I personally liked Rogue Morimoto Imperial Pilsner more, but this is a decent replacement for a fraction of the money."
"Drinkability is very good, despite the ABV. It sure didn't taste like a 7.5% brew, that's for sure. It was balanced very well."
"Features a lacy white head over semi-hazy rich golden liquid. Nose is perfumy,flowery, grassy hops with light biscuity malt underlying the hops. Taste is sweet and malty first with a healthy dose of hops, well balanced. Finishes herbal, bitter, fruity and quite long."
"Drinkability...enjoyable. I would get again."
"Golden yellow appearance was very attractive due to a high clarity, active carbonation, and a one finger thick classic looking head. The aroma was less cleanly hoppy than a regular Pilsner, and had hints of tropical fruits creeping in, which although attractive, dont normally belong in the style. The taste was sweet and minerally-dry with more than a hint of spicy noble hops. The mouthfeel was silky smooth, and flawless. The 7.5% alcohol was masterfully hidden. Hidden behind what, I cant tell. The only thing that slightly hindering high drinkability was the sweetness that got a little heavy handed. I am glad these are available here in Georgia now, as I can see going to this well quite often to quench my thirst."
"So, I just don't know. I probably would not get this again because while it was fairly good, it was dangerously much like malt liquor. It's kind of like when I had an imperial porter, seemed like they boosted the alcohol content just to have it and that detracted from a decent beer."
"light yellow with a pumpkin-tinged crown.. lots of random sticky lacing and a patchy funk of wisps on the surface. bubbles struggle in the mix. smells of lager yeast and syrupy sweetness. not much in terms of hops or developed sugar. slight roasty character. hoppier in the mouth, with a dry finish and a unique counter-balance of sweet adjuncty base and green green botanicals. for 7.5%, this is a heavy ass beer disguised as something much lighter. with morimoto, i got more flavor and balance out of the beer and didn't mind its big gravity. here, i wish for a similarly flavored 'single' pils with a higher drinkability. decent, but not one i'd revisit again. this style needs an affordable, flawless example to continue to flourish."
"Overall: Wow, this is really great for the price and the rarity of the style; I need to try the other High Seas beers from Clipper City."
"I thouroughly enjoyed this one. Taste is warm and familiar. My first Clipper City brew and a dandy it is. I'll take another. Try some."
"Overall quite refreshing. Will recommend this and buy it again."
"Clear straw gold when served, I liked the look of the white snowcap head. Pretty clean aroma. Medium mouthfeel, and the carbonation was pretty low as well. I did enjoy the toasty malt taste, and the fact that even though there was some sweetness, it was kept to a minimum. Pretty pleasant to drink, especially at that abv."
"Nose is herbal, leafy and exhibits some solid hop bitterness, hopefully letting its drinker know they are getting a well hopped pils. And it doesn't disappoint. Carbonation bites the tongue initially but quickly disappears, showing the softness of this brew. Crisp and refreshing with a really nice hop bitterness not oft seen in American Pilsners. Nothing too complex, but well balanced if nothing else, and the alcohol gives a nice warming effect as well. Nicely done."
"overall- im quite impressed with this beer. very clean, smooth and refreshing taste. balanced perfectly. defintely worth a try."
"This beer poured a clear, golden color with white foam that settled and clung to the glass a bit. The smell was lightly sweet and malty. The taste was richly malty with some sweetness, alcohol, and a bit of mild, grassy hops. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy with medium-full body and low carbonation feel. Overall this was a good beer, but somewhat too malty to be highly drinkable for me."
"Again, thanks go to ppoitras, and BiF 19."
"Bottom line this is one fine brew. Easy to drink and enjoy. This beer is great alone or with a meal. 7% could sneak up on you but the flavor of this beer is simply wonderful. A must try."
"This poured with a huge, thick, white head that as it dissipated, it left the begiinings of Belgian lace along the side of the glass. The color was a hazy golden-yellow. The nose was faintly malty, but there was a definite presence of hops. The mouthfeel was medium with a really interesting spiciness, like cloves, on the palate. The finish was more malty than hoppy, which was a bit of a surprise. I really like this beer. I would drink it routinely on a hot, humid east coast day like today and ABV be damned! Argh! Full speed ahead."
"This uber pils pours a rich amber golden color. Very thick creamy white head which stays around through the entire lenth of the beer. Leaves traces throughout the glass as well. The scent is hoppy, grassy and floral. Quite strong. The taste is clean and refreshing. Slightly bitter hops flavor, but not overpowering. The taste of yeast/bread comes through as well. There is a very slight kick to remind you of the 7.5%abv. All around a smooth beer for someone who likes some hops, and wants to get away from a pale ale."
"Pours a five-fingered white head that fades quickly leaving some lace. Cloudy light amber color. Hoppy/malty nose. Light carbonation and light-medium bodied. Starts malty/hoppy with some sweetness, finish is clean with some hoppiness. Nice pilsner. $1.45 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, Ma."
"Poured a nice medium clear golden with a light but sticky white head,herbal/grassy hop aromas jump out at ya with a underlying dry biscuity maltiness to let you know its there..Wow uber is the word here as in uber hopped strong grass and herbal flavors for sure with just enough bready malt in the background to keep it balanced but the hop profile steals the show.Wow a hoppy American pilsner that is oh so quaffable for the alc% I couldnt believe that it was 7.5% man I could drink this all day I Think but it would catch up to me sooner or later,either way damn good."
"Extremely drinkable. Enjoyed while night-time surf fishing and with some queso-dip. A tasty pilsner with some added hops cojones."
"A beefed up version of a traditional Pilsener. At 7.5% abv this one's worth a try for the novelty alone, and it doesn't disappoint. A session brew may be asking too much of this one."
"taste was a hit of malt with nice hit of floral hops that lingered. overall it was well balanced and the alcohol was not noticeable at all. Medium bodied this was a crisp, clean and very very refreshing brew that left me wanting another. An excellent pilsner any day of the week."
"Drinkability is very good. Very refreshing beer. Great after a swim sort of the Uber-lawnmower beer."
"Although it may look just like a regular pils, looks can be deceiving! Clipper City's Uber Pils delivers a rich, strong, hoppy and drinkable lager! The nose is bright with citrusy (lemon rind), floral (dried rose petals), and spicy hops nestled down in a bed of sweet bready malt. It's surprisingly medium bodied (although it does lean towards being full); and it's superbly smooth and dextrinous across the palate with a very fine, natural carbonation that just lightly pricks the tongue. The flavor is even richer than the nose suggests, but it's not overdone in anyway. The doughy malt base is backed by a solid bitterness; and it's well-infused with floral, grassy, and spicy hop flavors. It's very well balanced, and perhaps even a bit too much so, as it finishes pretty much the same way it began. Hmmm...? The sweetish, bready malt slowly fades along with its beautiful hop flavors and bitterness, leaving us not with a bang but a whimper. Maybe another 5 to 10 BU's are warranted.... and then again, maybe not - this is one really drinkable strong lager, and perhaps its overall round softness is more important that a little bit more complexity. Either way, this one's a winner!"
"I poured this tasty pils into a pils glass. Pours with a big, white, foamy head. Head dissipates after a few minutes leaving some nice lacing. Visually, the beer pours a pale golden yellow. As for smell, hops are up front with hints of fresh cut grass. What an incredibly smooth beer. Not over the top considering the avb of 7.5%. Hops and malt are well balanced making for an easy drinking beer, crisp and downright tasty and refreshing though it does leave your mouth a bit dry which makes me want to drink more of this beer. Overall, a very good imperial pils. Alcohol is well hidden which could make this beer a very dangerous session brew. Not quite as good at the Dominion Spring Brews but its not far behind. Go out and seek this one."
"Drinkability: I could easily make this a session beer. Definitely try this if you see it. After drinking this style it's going to be hard to go back to a pilsner. Watch out though because the balance and flavor (especially with it being a form of a pilsner) can lead you to believe its ABV isn't very high."
"This beer has a great taste, it is slightly sweet alcohol laced with noble hops that compliment the nice pure malt flavors. It is so pleasent and subtle that each sip invites another. It stands up as a good beer even warm as a 32oz serving can get warm towards the bottom. The nose is staright ligth maltyness mingled with hops of fruityness and spice. Wonderful beer and not something to be past over when you see it."
"Light gold with fine-bubbled carbonation rising continuously. Huge white head is mostly creamy but some big bursts in there too. Clumps of foam cling to the glass. Smells leafy and spicy, with a little crushed aspirin (amarillos?!) also limey and mineral-like. Taste is again leafy spicy hops, minerals (a bit salty), and honey. Very tasty. The only things I would ask for is a little bit more flavor from the malt (more graininess perhaps) and skip the aspirin-like amarillo hops that bother me in the aroma and flavor. Starts medium-bodied and sweet, but quickly dries out and finishes wonderfully balanced but flavorful. Well-carbonated and alive. Hell yes, this is a nice beer. In fact, until going to review it, I had no idea that it was 7.5%. Look out, it is hidden!! This is a dangerous one. Very very good."
"poured a beautiful amber color with enormous white puffy long-lasting head. nice crisp hoppy head. this seems like its going to a good one. Ah, the nice crisp hoppy taste comes through big and strong. feels great in the mouth and makes me want more. Hard to believe this is a 7% beer. Extremely drinkable. This will become one of my favorites"
"Drinkability- It was pretty good, but the strong nature of it made me crave a regular pils. Maybe just a bit too much over the edge for me for a pils. Thanks much to santoslhalper for the sample."
"Drinkability: I had trouble just sipping at it, I wanted more."
"Pours a clear golden with a large fluffy rocky white head that lasts for a good bit. ( Warning pour slowly or you could have a gusher on your hands.) Aroma is a bit of bready malt and more spicy floral hops. There is also a bit of candied tropical fruit citrus note in there. My wife said it smelled like candied oranges from 5 feet away. Taste is good. Spicy hops with enough malt backbone to keep it in balance. Does not seem as bone dry hoppy like the Dominion Spring brew. This one seems to have more floral and citrus notes. As noted earlier carbonation is ample, but not over the top. Alcohol is very well hidden. A very very drinkable beer that goes down exceptionally smooth. I would definately recommend this. While not quite in Dominions class, it is close"
"Drinkability and Overall: The most interesting Clipper City brew I've ever had. I had a bottle of this the other night that wasn't as quality as this one, but this is great. I just can't believe how light it tastes. Almost a Belgian Golden Ale, but with a German quality. I don't know. It's enjoyable for sure."
"Beer pours a bright golden color with a thick white head. Crystal clear with steady stream of bubbles of carbonation. Grassy aroma. Taste starts out malty, tasting of bread and grass, but finishes with on a dry hoppy note. This is an incredibly drinkable beer, one of Clipper City's best."
"It is now offered year round which is great news! Go out and get some now!"
"Not a warning, but an advisory: try this beer."
"Drinkability is rock solid here, hard to beleive this is 7%. A nice offering from clipper City, Thanks to lackenhauser for giving me the chance to try this one."
"Small Craft Warning is a beer for lovers of big beer. Throw all preconceived notions of the pilsner style out the window and just enjoy this sucker for what it brings to the table: loads of hop flavor and a lush, velvety body that carries that flavor across the palate with panache. Many thanks to lackenhauser for the opportunity."
"Hazy golden, good looking shining color, thin bubbles cover, sticky. Aroma is very bready, grassy, fluffy. Surprisingly grainy palate, somehow hay-ish, yeasty with an alcohol trace toward the finish. Nice mouthfeel: almost still, but creamy, cask-like. Thanks Larry!"
"Mouthfeel is light and smooth, the sweetness makes it very drinkable. Stronger and heavier than a traditional pilsner like Urquell. Thanks to meathookjones for sharing this unique style with me."
"Pours a crystal clear, deep gold color. The carbonation is slight and the head is an off-white when it is roused. A sharp strong aroma of hops emanates from my glass; it is grassy, herbal, lemony, and slightly funky. The taste is soft and malty up front, but leads to a solid hop flavor and then to a bitter finish. I get notes of toasted biscuits, spicy-herbal hops, and hay all mixed together. This is a pretty good example of a Pilsner, and it is quite tasty on this warm Arizona evening."
"A damn nice super-pils from Clipper City. Though it wasn't quite as good as the Morimoto, this is also more readily available, and I certainly wouldn't be sorry drinking a few of these!"
"The taste is very nice. Bittersweet and robust. This claims to be an Uber-pils and it seems to be just that. Like a German Pilsner on steroids. Full bodied and hearty. Highly attractive and inticing. Overall, this is a beer with guts. Not your typical Pilsner, but an amped-up version that has an originality about it that I like. I felt like I tried something new here, and I like it. Well done and probably underrated."
"Pours a hazy deep gold with thin lasting head & very active carbonation. Has a somewhat mild aroma of spicy hops, sweet malts, lemons, and freshly cut grass. In the mouth this is much more full & rich than a pilsner hitting you with some butterscotch and sweet malts initially. Some gentle hopping with hints of citrus & an herbal/floral flavor. Finishes with toffee & a touch too much candied sugar for my liking. Extremely drinkable for the alcohol content & probably the best Clipper City offering I've had to date."
"Beer is good. Happy heavy beering."
"Pours out a clear light gold with a nice, cream white head that settled down to a light layer. Lightly scented with freshness, citrusy, fresh cut grass... nice. Very refreshing tasting, not too much jumps out at you. Little bit of a bite from the hops, maltyness is there, but nothing is overwhelming. It is just a nice brew. Great session beer. Picked this one up after staring at it at my fave distributer for quite a while, then finally speaking to Larry who pours for Weeping Radish at some of the fests around here, who said when ya see it to grab it. Grabbed some for Father's day gifts for my beer loving fathers too! Very drinkable, nice and light- but not too light. Good pils!"
"This poured a clear golden yellow with a good-sized foamy white head. This quickly falls to a collar and leaves a little lacing. Aroma contains citrus hop scents, a bit of an earthy tone and the malt shows through as it warms. Tastes a bit sweet at first then it is followed by a spicy citrus hop flavor to balance it out a bit. The finish is a little bitter and also slightly warming. Mouthfeel is medium and this goes down quite smooth. Makes for a pretty good session beer even at 7%."
"I have only had two of these so far, but quite drinkable."
"($1.43 / 12 oz.)"
"Poured a crystal clear mix of gold and straw colors, with super carbonated dancing bubbles that lasted to the last sip in the glass. The head was thick and compact composed mostly of tiny tightly packed bubbles and after a semi-vigorous pour about 1 ½ inches high. It was off white/cream colored and the surface was sticky and sheet like. The head lasted to the last taste and was creamy on the tongue. There was light lace present, spotty in some places. The aroma was fairly light, crisp, fresh and at times on the sweet side, only down side was that at times hardly noticeable after it sat for some time. I nosed a mix of grassy, citrus and floral hops through out some malt and a bready yeast in the finish. The tastes were more pronounced and seemed to only blend and mellow as the temperature rose. Flavors of hops (spicy, floral, and citrus) all were very pronounced as well as fresh cut grass, along with those flavors, a light leafy presence was noticeable in the mid swallow and it finished with a sweet bread and yeasty taste as it finished. The aftertaste was mostly of dry hop leafs. Which gave it a semi dry finish that was left in the mouth. I would say that it was medium bodied. All and all a refreshing, clean beer that when first tried was a little on the dry side but as the temp. rose it mellowed and seemed to become less dry and more on the watery side. One thing I did notice was that the alcohol content of this beer was very sneaky, no presence in the taste, but will hit you after a few. Side note from the bottle and nice was that on the bottom there was a nice coating of yeast, probably not a beer that could be cellared for a long time, but I am sure it would improve more with a few months. A fine example of an American styled pilsner beer."
"Drinkability: Despite the higher alcohol, and easy beer to quaff. Had it after three glasses of water and a 5 mile run, so it was refreshing."
"D&N: A very nice pilsner, a very nice session beer. This beer tastes really good and goes down super easy. If you find it on tap, check it out."
"First of what's the name of this beer, and why so many names. I'm guessing the Uber part is a beefed up pils at least in alcohol. Appearance; Filtered vibrant golden tone white head leaves even lacing, nice. Aroma: Alcohol comes through with a hoppy zest of Saaz and more noble hops providing a grassy tone to it all blended with some semi-sweet pale malts to balance this one will bring up the hop burps. Taste: Mouthfeel: Medium light bodied a beefier than most pils even carbonation slightly sticky in texture. Drinkability: Refreshing and fortified with a bit of extra alcohol, isn't bad but I'm sure there are tastier versions of an Uber Pils out there."
"12 ounce bottle. Best before August 04. A very well done brew. With a smidge less sweetness it would be even better."
"Drinkability: 6.2%? Then I'm in trouble, cause this rolls down smooth as hell."
"I got caught up in all the Imperial Pilsner talk as of late, that paired with spring and a need for something different. This poured a beautiful clear deep golden with a nice fluffy white head and left decent lacing on the glass. The smell was fantastic -- crisp hoppy bite, abundant floral and citrus hops, piney, honey, malty.... a little bit of everything. The taste just floored me.... really nice true Pilsner character that gave way to super floral and citrusy hops, but not cloying sweetness or overly sweet in any way. This was very impressive. I have to say I bought a six, but I'm definitely going back for a case before it's all gone (no luck finding a keg of this I'm sure...) This is also very drinkable, one after the other --- that's the nice Pilser quality. Now, for a true Pilsner purist this might not be the answer but if you're looking for something a little different in the Pilsner vein, find this and enjoy."
"Pours a very nice golden color.The label says it contains a trace of yeast-really must be a trace as theres very little floatsam and jetsam(to use the nautical term in keeping with the name) to see.Nice slight head.Wonderful noble hop aroma-somewhat grassy/citrusy.Slightly sweet malt backround.Bitterness is subdued though it tends to linger after a taste.Good full bodied mouthfeel.Very smooth-nice balance between the hops and malt.A very drinkable beer.Im sure the 6.2% can sneak up on you.The company web site puts it at 7%.A really nice beer.Wouldnt call it an ""imperial"" Pils as the name might suggest but its defiantely cranked up a notch.Try it."
"Offered as an Uber Pils or Imperial class. It has a solid malt backbone to support a bitter tasty hop structure. The color is pure clean light gold pilsner, with an ample snowy head and evident lacing. Each mouthful was pressed into the palate as the bittering grabs you. The swallow is long and flavorful with an appropriate pilsner bite. I'm happy to see Hugh Sisson produce a quality lager that is worth buying by the case."
