3.99,10.8,4,3.75,4.25,3.5,4,"Summer is great for lagers...and this one is exceptional. It is a hazy, golden straw color. The head is white, firm, and foamy. Clean, pale malt aroma, backed with a serious herbal Novak hop scent. The taste is clean, with lots of pale malt. Medium in body and warmth is present due to the abv. This is a very rewarding brew.","Suds","May 30, 2013"

3.04,-15.6,4,3,2.75,3.75,3,"Gotta give it up for the increased local flavor, even if that flavor ain't local to me. This stuff pours a clear sunset amber topped by a finger of off-cream foam. The nose comprises buttery biscuit, light orange zest, and a hint of grass. The taste brings in more of the same, with a diminished butter component and a dull grassy bitterness pervading. A hint of dry wheat remains behind just in case. It's one note, played loudly and discordantly. The body is a straight medium, with a light moderate carbonation and drying finish. Overall, though a good idea and a laudable philosophy, the end product just doesn't do it for me, especially with that blunt bitterness that envelops all.","TMoney2591","Beers"

4.05,12.5,4,4,4,4.5,4,"The booze in this was certainly up to par for this style but not for a second could I taste it or felt it was too strong. So many of Lakefront's offerings have been less than stellar but anything with the Badger State prominently pictured on the bottle is worth every penny, as it's an indicator that the "craft" in craft beer will be found in every drop inside of the bottle. When the weather warms up again next year, this and the Wisconsinite will be on my "Must-have" list and if you're looking for a good domestic alternative to the European beers of the Pils family, you owe it to yourself to get one of these and share it with good friends on a bright, sunny day.","JerzDevl2000","Jul 08, 2012"

3.83,6.4,4.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Taste is firm, creamy, raisiny alcohol and grain, bread dough with light sweetness up front plus light spicy-herbal & lemony hops with light bitterness, balancing by the finish and both lingering. Clean, malty alcohol is noticeable throughout. Somewhat like a pretty good maibock, but like a more malty, more hoppy malt liquor. In the end, the meaty-raisiny alcohol tends to dominate a bit too much and other elements soon fade a bit.","Offa","Mar 16, 2010"
3.9,8.3,4,4,4,4,3.5,"This lager pours slightly hazy pale golden color with an ample, clingy bright white head. The aroma is a well struck balance between sweet, grainy malt and floral, citrusy hops. The flavor is medium-low smooth grainy malt with moderate citrusy and sightly piney hop flavor. The moderate hop bitterness provides balance leaving the beer with a slightly dry lingering bitterness. The body is medium-full with moderate carbonation. Overall a very flavorful, smooth lager with nice American hop presence. Well-made and quite unique.","uwmgdman","Mar 06, 2010"
3.97,10.3,3.5,4,4,4,4,"The flavor opens slightly sweet with grainy and doughy malt notes. The malt is balanced by a lower moderate level of hop bitterness. Citrus character really comes through, reminiscent of a ripe orange, and earthy notes are apparent. Alcohol is perceivable, and the bitter grainy finish exhibits a subtle spiciness (coriander?). The beer is light medium bodied with a moderate level of carbonation. A well crafted and refreshing lager beer...just the job!","HopHead84","Feb 27, 2010"

3.11,-13.6,4.5,3.5,2.5,4,3,"Poured into an imperial pint, formed a 1/2" off-white head above the slightly cloudy golden amber brew. Frothy head lasts and lasts, with coating lace. Aroma is sweet and lemony. Taste starts sweet, but quickly goes citrus in the middle, and closes with some earthy hops character and a somewhat chalky aftertaste. Mouthfeel is quite smooth, but drinkability is hindered by the flavors that I wasn't really enjoying. Just doesn't all come together for me.","ppoitras","Beers"
4.03,11.9,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Pours a very nice cloudy pale yellow color, nice carbonation, very nice two-finger plus creamy white head, with some very nice thick/creamy sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, slightly yeast, with some spice note. The taste is sweet, malty, yeasty, and spicy. Medium body. Drinkable, this brew surprised me, tasty.","Wasatch","0"

4.05,12.5,4,4,4,3.5,4.5,"D- For being 7%, you would never know it. A light clean beer that is pretty smooth. I could drink more than a few of these in a sitting. This is what I think the definition of a session beer is. Another decent offering from Lakefront.","Wisconsinality","Dec 14, 2009"
4.05,12.5,4,4,4,4.5,4,"D - If you have one alone you won't know what hint you. The 7% is hidden well beneath this drinkable lager that's both flavorful and intoxicatingly texture-driven. A pleasure to have and at $5 a 22 oz bottle, it's not a bad deal.","BeerFMAndy","Dec 09, 2009"
4.08,13.3,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Bomber poured into imperial pint glass - unfilted hazy from dark gold on the bottom to a ligher gold near the head - impressive creamy of white head retains for quite some time - excellent lacing. Smell fresh grain slight citrus. Taste malty up front with some bitter and citrus hop near the finish. Mouthfeel is cream with decent carbonation. I really liked this beer, which helps in drinkability but it is filling.","tjkurz","Dec 04, 2009"

4.43,23.1,4.5,4,4.5,4,5,"Purchased a 22 oz. bottle from Ray's Liquors in Wauwatosa, WI. Pours a hazy, golden body with a big, puffy white head. Aromas of bread dough and grassy hops. Medium bodied with low to medium carbonation, this beer boasts big bready malt flavors from the 6 row barley, but retains a smoothness and slightly chewy mouthfeel that gives way to a medium hop bitterness in the semi-dry finish. I found myself reaching often for another gulp, excellent drinkability.","blackearth","0"
