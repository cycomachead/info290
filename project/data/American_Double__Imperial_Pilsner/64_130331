This was an Imperial Pilsner stylistically but when it came to the taste and body, there was just too much going on here for this to fall nearly into that category. It's been a while since I had a beer that tailed off from the initial sip to the aftertaste that lingered but that was the case here. Props to Dogfish Head for going outside of the norm with this but I wasn't quite feeling it and can only hope that Beer Two Thousand stands a bit more above the crowd when it comes out.","JerzDevl2000","Feb 08, 2015"

I love the idea of DFH going ""against the grain"" to use 10 different hops and 10 different grains to make a lager that has some actual character. The crispness of it's mouth feel paired with the nice apple and honey elements with a healthy kick of booze on the end makes this beer a stand out.

Smooth, easy to drink, light to medium body with well-hidden ABV, I like the pils like grassy, earthy hop feel and light sweetness with some breadiness to add balance and a crisp, dry finish.

Furthermore, I've never had a beer this light in body with so much alcohol. It burns after it's down but not easily felt to the palate. But way complex, so much malt/sweetness/hop flavors going on.

Aromas of subtle resinous hops, subtle tropical fruit sweetness, tangy caramel and biscuit in the backbone, and some herbal and floral highlights. Flavors are rich and heavy forward, with a solid caramel and candi sugar blast, immediately followed by a warming ribbon of booze. The hops are there, but seem slightly outmatched. Subtle bitterness, with a toasted grain backbone. The body is heavy, robust, and slick, and the carbonation fights to keep some lightness to the body. Sugary sweet and heavily toasted aftertaste, with a building booze warmth. Smooth, slightly dry finish. Big beer.","GarthDanielson","Dec 21, 2014"

Pours slightly hazy deep golden color with a 1 finger dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big lemon, melon, apple, pear, white grape, honey, cracker, bread, herbal, floral, grass, pepper, and yeast earthiness. Nice and unique aromas with good balance and complexity of pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. A bit too perfumey/estery in the nose. Taste of big lemon, melon, pear, apple, white grape, honey, cracker, bread, herbal, floral, grass, pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy herbal/peppery bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, melon, pear, apple, white grape, honey, cracker, bread, herbal, floral, grass, pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice balance, complexity, and robustness of pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; with a nice malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, fairly crisp/sticky, and lightly bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good imperial pale lager style. All around good robustness, complexity, and balance of pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Dec 16, 2014"

There is a mild pilsner quality with gentle yeast in the taste adding a little breadiness but alcohol is subdued and finish is relatively dry which is pleasant.

4,7,,,,,,"Pours 2-3 fingers white head - Beer color is that of a ginger ale soda with a light copper color when the head starts to settle it looks like a fine glass of champagne with lots of bubble rising and a decent amount of perfect carbonation -Then as the white lacing settles on the sides of the glass as the head continues to die off the carbonation is very much alive. Beer did not come out of a bottle it came out of 1/6 keg. Beer is super fresh and alive.The nose smells of bread like yeast with a sweet smell lingering in the back. Tastes like sweet bread with a slight booziness and light trailing hops tastes that does not linger much at all. Very easy to drink beer type of beer you could get yourself into trouble lol.... with. Beer is simple and worth having. Nothing is bold in this beer its very weighted which is cool. To say it simply sweet bready carbonated light colored tasty champagne feel type of beer its cool I am down with it. I am feeling the Alcohol as we speak it creeps on you because it does not drink like its alcohol content. I would buy it mhmm it has that dogfish feel to it - Drink it while eating a white pizza they compliment each other very nicely cheers !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","Acmecondor","Dec 14, 2014"

The flavor Is a bit fruity tart with light berry and hop bitterness. Light alcohol flavor and light warming.

Pours a light to medium golden amber with a thin slightly off-white head that dissipates quickly to patches, leaving light lacing. Aroam of bready malt with hints of caramel, apple and light fruit, mild grassy hops. Flavor is sweet bready malt, grains, light apple and pear, light floral and grassy hops, becomes sweeter before finishing with a semi-sweet bready maltiness with spicy hops and light, lingering hop bitterness. Medium bodied, more dense mouth feel than expected from the color. A subtly flavored sweet imperial pilsner, perhaps a bit underwhelming, but the flavor is smooth and balanced throughout. Nice finish. Kind of what I'd expect a domestic lager on steroids to taste like, nothing stands out, moderately sweet and pleasant. It is hard to believe it is so modestly flavored yet the ABV is totally covered. Interesting experience. One of the less envelope pushing Dogfish Head beers, but as usual an experience worth having.","LiquidAmber","Dec 12, 2014"

Head retention is good, and there's a decent amount of lacing.  The brew smells like caramel and bready/grainy malt, apples, and a general earthy/herbal aroma.  For the most part I think the taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but there's also some candied oranges, citrus peel and and a bit of pear noticeable.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's slick with a moderate amount of carbonation.  Overall I thought it was a solid brew, but it really didn't do anything for me.  Worth a try once, but I'm not sure if I'd pick this up again in the future.","bluejacket74","Dec 12, 2014"

Finish Iis sweet with the same flavors present. Aftertaste is lager yeast and light citrus. Overall impression of flavor is of an odd imperial lager, quite boozy, but overall good.

Complexity is there if you search for it, but it is what it is...nothing more, nothing less. Being that one of my favorite beers is the seasonal 'Czech Yourself Pilz' Imperial Pilsner from the C.H. Evans Brewery (aka: Albany Pump Station), I was excited to try this. Being that Beer Thousand has a slightly more 'corny' sweetness, I will give a nod to the Pump Station. Not for everyone, but if you want to know what a lager can be clocking in @ 10%ABV, look no farther than this limited offering from the trend-bending brewery. Check it out while you can!

4.09,9.4,4.75,4.5,3.75,3.75,4.25,"A very good beer: looks and smells amazing, tastes pretty good, and the math certainty works.  But it also could be a lot better.  Evil Power, as far as I've tasted, is the gold-standard for the Imperial Pilsner, and there are some other truly excellent huge, high-abv lagers emerging in this genre; this, unfortunately, is a tier below—though with strengths oddly beside—those instantiations.","OrestesMethuon","Nov 26, 2014"

2.5,-33.2,,,,,,"Is this the best pilsner I've ever had? Probably. But for me, saying ""best pilsner"" is ultimately akin to saying ""best Billy Joel album"" or ""best prostate exam."" But kudos to DFH for trying.","BrewmanCapote","Nov 26, 2014"
3.69,-1.3,,,,,,"Bottle. Pours a clear, orange color with a mild head. Rings of lacing. Aroma is very floral and perfumey. It is also very grainy. A bit of honey. Some booze in the nose. Flavor is well balanced and sneaky with the alcohol. Floral hops are again perfumey. Pale fruit, grain, pale malt sweetness, grains. Some cereal. Booze well hidden. Softer carbonation. Not sticky or anything. Not super bitter. Like a really well malt Malt Liquor. I was tentative to buy a four pack but they seem to be disappearing quickly. Better than expected.","VelvetExtract","Nov 26, 2014"
3.82,2.1,4.5,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,"I'd say it's broadly in the Maibock in style- sometimes I'm getting glimpses of the old SN Glissade due to the hops- but there are so many other flavors and aromas that it's become something unto itself. That something that is hard to grasp also makes it easy to like, but hard to love, in my experience. Worth a try, though.","TongoRad","Nov 26, 2014"
