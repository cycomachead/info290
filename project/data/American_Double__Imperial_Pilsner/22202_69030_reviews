"O - An excellent, unique beer. Perfect as a summer alternative when you want a sipper, but don't want anything too heavy."

"The beer pours a white, bubbly, and frothy head that takes a while to dissipate and leaves quite a bit of very nice lacing on the walls of the glass. The beer itself is a clear brown with orange notes. The beer is also a little bit hazy but that's most likely due to the temperature difference between the beer and the glass. The smell has strong honey and graham cracker notes mixed with a bit of light oatmeal. The hops are a little bit buried beneath the other notes but provide a nice base with its bitter and grassy notes. The taste is a bit stronger with the hop notes and the oatmeal as well as the sweeter honey and oat notes are weaker. However, the mix is much better than in the smell because it's no longer so sweet. Additionally, there is a slight alcohol taste that is very faint and barely noticeable. The mouthfeel is medium bodied but on the thicker side and very light on the carbonation despite the good head retention. Overall, a very good beer that is worth getting if you haven't done so. Despite the odd pairing, the combination actually works very well in how one note offsets the other and prevents it from becoming too overwhelming."

"O-Wasn't bad but it failed to stand out against all the other beers I tried during my stay at ACBF."

"O: Basically a super pilsner. Very strong pilsner malt and grassy hops plus the grainy oatmeal for complexity. Decent bitterness for a pilsner too, but of course this not an IPA or something. Bright and sharp, tasty but I think I'm more of a fan of the lighter, more sessionable pilsners."

"A massive lager, being an “Oatmeal Pilsner” really rounds this brew out. While the malt backbone puts on quite a show, we had selfishly hoped that the hops would have been dialed up a tad more, which would have pushed this beer into a beer for the gods. We guess our palates can live with just great."

"Pours a bright golden color with a tight white head. Non stop cascade of tiny bubbles rise from the bottom of the glass. Smells sweet, slightly caramel and dough like. Malty sweet taste, very crisp and then a lingering warm alcohol finish. Very enjoyable on a dreary summer eve."

"The mouthfeel is what you would expect from an imperial pilsner style and the crisp, smooth mouthfeel makes the taste a bit more enjoyable. There is a light and airy mouthfeel within the SPF and the beer works its way across the mouth quite easily."

"Hope they make it again next summer, but I also hope they try something else because I don't think this brewery does anything wrong. It would be exciting to see what else they do."
"This is a well balanced beer with a great mouthfeel. Easy to drink for nearly 9% abv."
"Taste is odd. Don't really know what's going on here. It's pils-like but at the same time creamy (oatmeal) and dark-ish. Finish is metallic, like licking a penny. Not a fan. Mouthfeel is decent but doesn't seem to fit. One of the more confusing beers I've had in my day."
"O- So different I think I have to like it, right? Original concept for sure. I commend the effort, but not sure I would drink this again. Alcohol is a bit too forward, and everything else leaves me wanting... Very glad I got to try, thats for damn sure!"
"Overall this was a really interesting beer, the thickness was somewhat expected but still foreign, even in an imperial pilsner. Worth a shot."
"Taste begins sweet and earthy, spicy and citrus in the middle, with a lightly crisp close. Mouthfeel is soft over the tongue and smooth, and drinkability is very nice. Not as Sazz-heavy as I would expect from a Double Pils, but just an enjoyable brew."
"Wow. There is a lot going on in this beer. Perhaps one of the most complex and interesting beers I've had in a long time. Unique and delicious, I can't wait to try the other 4 Elements that I picked up. (Thanks to DarthKostrizer for bringing these guys to my attention!)"
"O: All in all, this is a very solid beer. This is a beer that will quench your thirst like a pilsner, but give you a buzz like a barley wine without any bit of cloying. Definitely try if you a like a good light beer that still has a good kick for you. Good job to Element!"
"O - This is probably the only limited release Element has done that I felt was actually worth the money I spent on the bottle. While it is still very steep ($17.99) atleast its a really good offering. I like the outside of the box combination here, the oats really works well with the pilsner qualities. While I wouldn't buy it again (due to the cost) I can actually say I'm glad I spent the money on this."
