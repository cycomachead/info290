"3.44/5: Even with a few months on it, it still has a good hop/malt balance"

"Tasted and smelled vastly different when first opened, had an almost Belgianesque yeasty feel to it. I let it sit for a while and it really opened up, or the bad stuff dissipated. Big sweet light sugary maltiness with a fair amount of higher alcohols. Grassy earthy pine sol hops. Not a fan, but better the longer it sits."

"Despite the imperialization of the beer (imperial dogs!) this is one of the better U.S. efforts at a pils that I've come across. Nice & clean with a nod towards modernity. Like it more than I expected too, this is a very good beer."
""
""
"The body might slip into the medium range but doesn't get too heavy. Dryness cuts in partway through to finish it out. Crispness is firm and stays all the way through. The only issue is that it could be a little cleaner at the end of the sip."

"Overall: a very good imperial pilsner. not a strong focus on the hops but strong. I like it"
"I'm really not often a fan of Pilsners because I often find them bland and uninteresting, but I enjoy the body and sweetness of The Curl quite a lot."

"O- This was okay, the toasted flavor I didn't care for and made this a pretty off balanced beer. The backend and aftertaste I found quite enjoyable just wish it was the same throughout."
""
""
"O - Decent pilsner. Well balanced and easy to drink."
""
""
"O - This Double Pils was a nice diversion from the norm. This is a unique brew and I would definitely try it again."

"Flavors and Mouthfeel: crisp grains on the tip of the tongue, then some light citrus spice on the mid and finish, dusty yeast in the mix, the aftertaste is dry and slightly piney when cold and a course grind black pepper as it warms, zesty feel to the hops overall, fine carbonation"
""
""
""
""
"(O)- Overall, I get how this is a pilsner, but almost comes off like a saison to me."
"Drink- I really enjoyed this. The balance was there with a good thick malt balance with a bit of spicy lemon and hops. A little bitter but works overall."
""
""
""
""
"D - really good double pilsner here...I was pleasantly surprised by this one. The amarillo hops were bold enough to provide a really nice balance to the grain malts. I love this hop and was glad to see it in this beer. Great beer, the best double pilsner I have tried so far."
""
"This is a nice double pilsner, well hopped and flavorful."
"The beer pours a yellow color with a white head. The aroma has a lot of pilsner malt, with some grass thrown in. The flavor is more of the same. I get a ton of the lighter pilsner and biscuit malt, as well as some grass and floral hop notes. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"O- A well executed take on the style. Drinks nicely."

"12 ounce bottle into pilsener glass, bottled 4/26/2012. Pours fairly clear bright golden straw color with a nice 2 finger dense white head with nice retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Some decent soapy lacing on the glass, with plenty of carbonation streaming up retaining the head. Aromas of big lemon, citrus peel, herbal, grass, earth, bread, pepper, apricot, and yeast spiciness. Nice, well balanced, and pleasant aromas; with nice hoppiness and decent strength. Taste of big lemon, bread, pepper, orange peel, grapefruit, grass, earth, and herbal spiciness. Decent sized herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, citrus, bread, pepper, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance of flavors, with just the right amount of hop bitterness to balance it out. Flavors definitely showcase the hops more than aromas(which are more of a standard pilsener aroma). Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy and fairly crisp mouthfeel. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with hardly any warming present on the finish. Very easy to drink for being over 7%. Overall this is a damn nice and well made imperial pilsener. Nice hoppy flavors with great malt balance; and dangerously easy to drink. Really enjoyable stuff."

"I've not heard of an imperial pilsner but as the name implies I expected a classic pilsner but with additional malt and hops. I was not disappointed. The aroma and taste matched each other: sweet bready malt and noble hops. Overall this beer reminded me more of a full flavored German pilsner rather than an American pils."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Very nice imperial pilsner. More bitter than I was expecting, but crisp and delicious."
"Overall not bad, brings more American style than German, a bit heavy, nice malts at first until the caramel sweet malts kick in a bit too much, and the hops were nice at first then turned quite bitter and astringent, and overpower the rest of the beer."

"O- A very nice drinking beer... crisp and refreshing. Decently bitter, yet just sweet enough. No alcohol bite, yet it warms you up nicely. Seems like it's a Pils fighting to be an IPA."
"O-good, a little excessive. not my favorite."
"This wasn't bad overall, but unfortunately it's pretty damn far from the stalwart, SA Hallertau Pilsner"
"pungent sums this one up. it really delivers on the imperial pilsner name... a touch boozy and intense for my liking, and a bit muddled and messy on the whole. but it's interesting, definitely drinkable, and enjoyable. Not a bad beer, glad I tried it, but not one I'd seek out again myself."
"amber with a nice cap of white hanging over the top of the glass. Nice rich looking head of foam on the top of the glass here now as well, nicely done I have to say. Aroma immediately is a bit boozy with hints of grass, touches of hops, and a light fruit note that seems to pick up the warmer it gets. Interesting flavor profile as well here. Not at all what I was expecting. Hints of citrus, a touch of herbal, floral notes and a really nice and well laid out malty background. Quite nicely done I have to admit."
"This beer pours a very bright and vibrant clean gold in color with good clarity and a two finger, sudsy bright white head. The aromas are typical of most of the style, pale pilsner malts, light sweetness, some honey, and a light hoppy bitter finish. It tastes of bitter hops with a lightly sweet malty, honey finish. It's a lot more bitter than I anticipated. It also dries out my palate. It's a solid beer, but like most pilsners, there's little variance from the norm. It drinks well and is very drinkable but it is what it is."
"O (D) - I guess this is ok. Some interesting things here. But I won't have it again."
"Pours a golden yellow. Pretty. A decent amount of white head. Looks very solid. Smells hoppy and lagery. Sme light yeastiness n the nose with amarillo hops creeping through. Tastes like a mess... Bitter hops overpower mediocre lagery yeasts. This one is just too off kilter for me."
"2.0 D: This is the antithesis of what I would want from the style. Heavy, overly bready and yeasty, and far from clean. Not refreshing at all and otherwise not satisfying."
"O- This beer kicked my ass which I told Andrew (betsona) when we were drinking it. The malts were a little over the top at times but nicely done. The style itself was a little messy at times but then again I never realized why a lot of brewers are doing this as a style. Not a typical Short's beer and therefore I don't know how I really feel about it."
"Admittedly this is not my favorite style, but this one is very easy to appreciate. The complex flavors and easy drinkability make this offering another Short's masterpiece!"
"D - I feel like one bottle is enough. Its not bad, but there is just something that I find tiring after awhile. 3.5"
"A solid brew. I would have it again."
"Poured on tap into sampler glass at ChurchKey. Pours a hazy light orange color. The head was white with good retention and lacing. Fruit forward nose including the likes of citrus and a bit of white grape. Nose was cereal grains, some butter, and light grass. Medium bodied and slightly sweet with moderate bitterness. Effervescent with spruce, toffee, and a little apricot in the flavor. Light to medium bodied. Decent crisp pils beer."
"D: Very nice and enjoyable. I'd order another and I'd buy again. But maybe every other year, not every year if this becomes a rotating release."
"Grand result: this beer smells bad and has a poor mouthfeel, but ranks higher in the categories of looks and taste. A mixed bag but once I'd be fine not opening again. Thanks Tom for the opportunity."
"Beer is thin and really hopppy with this mild sweetness on the get go and a nice wet finish on the end. It is erally nice overall with a nice yeast character in the midpalate and a lead off sweetness. I'd have this again."
"O: I liked this beer well enough, but there were a few off characters to it that did just enough to put me off."
"Taste - sweet bready pilsner malt backed up by a bracing, back-of-the-throat-gnawing bitterness on the finish. The bitterness is long-lasting and grows increasingly unpleasant for a good minute after the beer is swallowed."
"Pours a yellow golden hue topped by a thick and creamy white head. Great retention and good lace. Smells of honey, citrus, and a touch of spruce/pine. This a tasty beer indeed! Honey notes, slight maltiness, citrus/pine hops... all very nicely balanced. Medium bodied and medium carbonation round out this ale. Great imperial pils and highly recommended."
"Golden yellow, about a finger of head, nice lacing as it goes down. Completely transparent. Steady stream of carbonation from the bottom to top. Hoppy and yeasty smell. Great bitter taste that finishes clean with a touch of sweetness. Mouthfeel is light and airy. I really like this beer. This is a Shorts beer that I will buy more than one 6 pack. Spring is a perfect time of year for this beer. After a season of drinking dark heavies, this is very welcome. I wonder if this is the base beer for the Spruce Pilsner?"
"I wasn't expecting much and this exceeded what I had hoped for. No problem downing these on a hot day while playing 18 holes. Given the abv I may end up face down by the 9th but hell I'd give it a go."
"Untill now I have yet to drink a shorts and go ""wow""! The pour is a light golden with a crisp white head. Aroma is bready and yeasty with a hint of floral hop. as I ake the first sip I am a bit taken aback by the amount of hop that hits my tounge. This is a bitter beer! Lots of citrus, sweet grapefruit rind flavor. This is almost balenced out by the sweet malt and bready flavors, but not quite. Drinks easy, with plenty of small bubbles to keep me from chugging it. I would seek this out, given the opertunity."
"Herbal, minty hop bitterness up front, along with some sweetish, soapy, soft cookie malt. Hop bitterness crescendos, with notes of resin, sea air, and mint. It's rather dank, and also rather delicious! Honey and melon settle in beneath, but the finish is dominated by the funky, stinky hops. Dry and very appetizing finish. Medium-full body with a soft, creamy feel. One of the best Imperial Pilsners around."
"Overall this was a very good Imperial Pilsner, the best I have had so far. This beer was basically everything a good Pilsner should be, but double that. The look and drinkability of this beer was fantastic, this is something I could enjoy during the summer while playing some disc golf. All in all this was a crisp, clean, easy drinking beer that I enjoyed a lot and it gave me a new appreciation for this style, I wish there were more Imperial Pilsners on the market. If you like the drinkability of pilsners and the flavor of pale ales then give this beer a try, it has a great combination of flavor and drinkability."
"Overall- for being a hophead this brew rocks! i feel this could be the future of american genius. different in a good way but strong and assertive."
"One of the most profound examples of what Short's is capable of. Still, this one seems a bit on the bleeding edge."
"overall, good. nothing I'd go out of my way too much for, but its on par for the style. Kind of expected a bit more hop flavor/aroma."
"Cheers"
"O- A wonderful beer. It's a very easy drinker and seems to really fit the style guidelines mentioned on this site. I'm very happy this beer is back. I can see it being a great backyard bbq beer when you want something with a little kick."
"This, is a home run beer. Clean, Clear, slightly bitter-Hopped, and aromatic."
"The Curl has a crisp feel and is well-balanced. Good drinkability even with its high ABV."
"Overall- Just not one of my styles. I enjoy it more as I drink it, I think the hops are taking over. But, my palate is hyper-sensitive to Pilsner malts and or Lagers in general."
"Overall: A good beer...definitely finishable. Better than Lion Stout's offering in this same category by a long-shot."
"O- i was a little leery of this one because of my lack of experience with the style and my overall opinion of the brewery. despite these factors I was surprisingly impressed by this beer. this beer takes the style that most beer drinkers started with and makes it something they can now be proud of. nice work shorts."
"12 ounce bottle poured into a pint glass. This is a clear pale golden color, fizzy with around half an inch of head. Smell is soapy with lots of cereals and light hoppiness. Taste is dominated by a crisp hoppiness, but it is balanced well enough to not be overly bitter. Light white grape flavors are present as well. Delicious with excellent drinkability."
"Had this on tap at the HopCat. I wonder what the age has done with it seeing as the last review before mine was over 8 months ago..."
"M/D: Super smooth, refreshing, and drinkable. The best pilsner I've had, props to Joe Short on this brew!"
"D- Very drinkable, no hint of alcohol really and tons of citrusy hop character make this an excellent drinker. Definitely a recommendation."
"On tap at MI brewers guild fest. Cloudy orange/yellow pour with thin bleached white head. Lots of citric rind in the nose with some hops, and just a little bit of candy to follow. FLavours are massive grapefruit and citrus witha good hops bitterness. Dry, lingering bitter finish. Good! I liked this brweies tent!"
"D-Well done. Again, wasn't too hopefull considering the age on this one but...it came through strong."
"This has aged ridiculously well, given that this bottle is almost three years old. I would be curious to know what it was like fresh."
"Very tasty and much too drinkable. A scary combination. A must try if you can find it from Short's Brewing of Bellaire, MI."
"Notes from 7/11/08"
"Drinkability- Overall this is a pretty tasty brew. Hate to sound like a broken record but I wish that bit of over carbonation wasn't there. It doesn't affect the mouthfeel as much as the taste but overall I guess it's not that bad. It gets better as the bottle empties. Really wish I could try this fresh but I did enjoy tremendously. Big thanks again to Jon!"
"One of the better imperial pilsners I have had, cannot believe that it has not changed much since it was fresh, still nice and hoppy like it was brewed yesterday, real dry for its age which was not a bad thing, even smells really fresh still, would drink again but probably not for eighteen dollars a bottle, recommended, it is bottle conditioned and you can definitely tell with how well this tastes at this point in time"
"Keep on rawkin, Joe."
"D: Glad I had the experience of trying this great limited beer. It was an experience!"
"Overall, wow a lot of hops here! Even after a year it's still held up great. In fact it's better than when I tried it a year ago. Very bitter super pilsner. Good stuff. Taste light a very light bodied IPA."
"On with the review. Nice pilsen malt leads a full mouthfeel and dry mid palate that is encoutered with the dry hoppiness of the amarillos that leave a good minute finish for you too digest. Hints of apricot, peach and lemon fill out this complex pilsner. Probably the best Pils I've tried to date. Only wish it were more available."
"The mouth starts off moderate but turns too dry and bitter for me. I won't be dropping another $16 for this one."
"Pours a deep gold with a smallish white head on the first pour, closer to the end the yeastiness mixes in and gives it a paler color and is nice and cloudy. There is a decent size grassy hop aroma along with some sweet sugariness and a sweet grainy aroma. There is also a nice pepperiness in the finish, at the start of the tasting, although this ended up mellowing towards the end. There is a little lemon and grapefruit that develop further in in both aroma and taste as it warms. A very nice balance between the pepperyness and dryness from the hops with the medium body. I may not pay 15.99 again for this, but it is definitely a tasty imp pils and I am glad to see some shorts stuff in bottles making its way south."
"This is the perfect hot/humid but not sunny weather beer. Refreshing and flavorful at the same time. As far as Double Pilsners go I liked the Sam Adams better but this beat out the DFH offering. Pricy but it's worth it if your a true beer geek."
"Md thick body with a dextrinous quality. Medium carbonation. I must say, the lacing on this beer was the most incredible I've ever seen (too bad the beer was so cloudy). This beer is reviewed to style, which the BA description says should be much more malty than I found the beer to actually be. Honestly, I found the beer to be too hoppy and dry...but just as I finished thinking about how dry my most recent sip was I was wishing for another sip."
"Pours a light orange color with yellow highlights, slightly hazy. Half inch thick, bright white head forms, but fades quickly. Very little lacing is left behind. Very citrusy and lemony smell. Nice! Definitely can smell the hops, and malts seem to take a backseat to the hops. Somewhat floral with hints of spices. Kinda weak tasting, nothing really stands up and grabs you. Malt and hops are well balanced, with some citrusy, fruit flavors hanging in the back. A little hop bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is a tad thin for me, slightly watery. Lots of carbonation, but its not felt in the mouth. I can hardly believe this 7.1%, very easy too drink. I must say that I like this more than Dogfish Head's Golden Shower. This seems almost like an APA to me. Anyway, it would really be hard for me to shell out another $15.99 for another bottle."
