"Overall OK, but not really meant to exist. I do love DFH experimenting, and Sam is such an awesome guy, but this one wasn't quite there. The lager yeast was just not meant to make a beer this big."

"Overall: A pretty interesting and solid twist on a Pilsner. It comes across like a Barleywine with its big balanced blend of malt and hops."
"Overall this is a pretty good brew although I believe I overpaid given the price point.  Nonetheless I a m glad I gave it a shot."

"i love the idea, i dont like the beer. 10 grains, 10 hops, 10 percent, beer thousand, and it comes with music, all good things. the beer though, is pretty bad, it smells like a can of high gravity homeless beer, steel reserve or something, sweet and corny and adjuncty and boozy in all the wrong ways. pilsener types that get this strong are always a little disagreeable to me, so maybe that is part of it, but this is easily the worst dogfish beer i can remember, its bright in color, crystal clear, and with a little orange to its color, well carbonated and relatively heady, but the attraction stops at the appearance. it smells so sugary and tinny, and the taste is the same, with the booze so exposed it almost hurts. it was hard not to dump this, and i may have if it wasnt for thebrewo pushing me though it, refusing to drainpour anything. very little redeemable about this one, unless you are looking for a quick and easy buzz, less calories, and a nasty hangover. no thanks."

"Great taste, easy to drink."
"Very unique beer... Love it!"
"Meh.... Not anything special, but ok."
""
"Skunky aroma, honey finish, sticky mouthfeel"
""
"A decent enough beer, but when I want to drink a pils, a beer with a 10% abv. is just not what I'm looking for.  Will likely not be visiting this one again."

"Extremely smooth IPL, good melon taste, high ABV but doesn't  factor in the taste at all. overall a fantastic IPL. not very fragrant only issue"

"Overall: As good as it tastes it is simply not enough.  to make you want to think this is the best lager you ever had. Very good, but there are some European counterparts that give you a lot more for half the money."

"12 oz bottled on 10/31/14.  Complexity with 10 grains and 10 hops, but I like the ""booziness"""
""
"   The booze was strong but not terribly noticeable, thankfully. This was an Imperial Pilsner stylistically but when it came to the taste and body, there was just too much going on here for this to fall nearly into that category. It's been a while since I had a beer that tailed off from the initial sip to the aftertaste that lingered but that was the case here. Props to Dogfish Head for going outside of the norm with this but I wasn't quite feeling it and can only hope that Beer Two Thousand stands a bit more above the crowd when it comes out."

"D: not bad, but needs some fine tuning. turned off by the DMS and seems like it could have been a little more fine tuned before publishing."

"Pretty good for a Pilsner"

"Fantastic beer. It's 10% and incredibly smooth -- and I didn't even age this."

"The best lager I have ever had. Period. If the American Macro lagers could take note lager wouldn't be such a bad word. Top ten beer of all time."
"Serving type: bottle."
""
""
""
""
"Golden. Good head retention and some lacing. Smelled of apples and pears to me. Tasted a little of the same. Enjoyed the abv. It added to the flavors."
"This one was interesting. Strong citrus on the aroma, with hints of malt shining through. Taste is that of citrus and sweet fruit. Pine and grains, along with moderate alcohol presence. Moderate body and smooth carbonation lend to a pleasant drinking experience."
""
""
"Great head retention, nice lacing on the side of the glass.  Smelled very subtle, tasted like apple, pear but hit a note of wax on the end.  Finished okay but won't be drinking this again."
"Just didn't work for me."
"Had this for from a 12oz bottle poured into a tulip glass. Good beer, great color and head. I expected more aroma and flavor. After the hype it was a bit of a let down. I have a 750ml cellared, hopefully it will age well and bring out something it was missing the first time around."
""

"Drinkability: Overall I was really impressed with this one. First off, I love the packaging. I paid $22.99 for the box set and felt it was well worth the money, especially with the vinyl and I wasn't even expecting another 22oz bomber of the beer in this box set, which really made happy when I opened it up. I love the idea of DFH going ""against the grain"" to use 10 different hops and 10 different grains to make a lager that has some actual character. The crispness of it's mouth feel paired with the nice apple and honey elements with a healthy kick of booze on the end makes this beer a stand out. An excellent effort from Sam and the boys down in coastal Delaware!"
""
""
""
"Feel: near medium body with medium-high carbonation. Alcohol warmth and mild harshness."
"overall: Another fine DFH. They seem to be out of favor a bit for some reason but continue to deliver."
""
""
""
"Pours a three finger white head that fades quickly to a ring leaving some lace. Crystal clear amber color.  Good carbonation and medium bodied.  Tart apple nose and flavor is grainy sweetness, some tartness and spice. The high ABV is hidden. Interesting imp pilsner. $2.90 for a 12oz bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
"10 malt varieties x 10 hop varieties, all cancelled each other out to create an underwhelming beer that resembles Steel Reserve. Beer Thousand yields a fluffy white head and a golden Pilsner color. Nose of a bud diesel. Tastes like a boozy lager with a metallic aftertaste."
""
"It goes down easier than it should for a 10% ABV brew, but after the pour and nose the overall beer slid down towards regular pilsner status; it has the makings of greatness but fell short and needs to be tweaked a little to right the ship."
""
""
""
"A fairly significant miss from Dogfish Head, which is a shame- they've put out a lot of stuff that I've liked."
""
""
"O - Er so I like that it's a pilsner because that's in line with GbV. But all these different hops and grains aren't beneficial, it's even hard to say whether they're showing up here at all. At 10%, with whacko malt liquor and generic lager flavors floatin about, it's pretty much a mess. Actually, that's in line with GbV too...maybe they're onto something here. Either way, sorry Dogfish, this one is ""Yours to Keep""."
"Glass- Perfect Pint"
"for having 10 hop varieties, i smelled/tasted NONE of them. smells like a cider. intense palate wrecking alcohol flavor."
"Great taste great job on this limited run awesome"
""
""
"Negative - Way too sweet.  Positive - The abv was pretty well hidden.  One and done on this."
"Way too sweet, barely noticed any hop bitterness for having 10 hops. Well hidden 10% abv."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, the alcohol kind of dominates the taste - it's a decent beer, but nothing special."
""
""
"Poured a clear golden body with a large, frothy head that dies slow and leaves foamy lace around glass.  A grassy, citric hop aroma along with a little bit of sweetness, both  of the hop (grape like) and malt (honey, I guess) variety.  Seems to be a little dislike for this beer but I found it not only an easy drinking beer but one that is pretty good (don't know if I had a freshly tapped keg made a big difference).  Smooth, easy to drink, light to medium body with well-hidden ABV, I like the pils like grassy, earthy hop feel and light sweetness with some breadiness to add balance and a crisp, dry finish.  Not for everyone but if you like a decent non-traditional pils to relax with you can't beat this beer."
""
"Aroma oranges, grains, bready malt, spice, faint fruitiness, ABV.  Taste sweet caramel malt, spices, citrus, yeast. Little boozy but nice!"
""
"Overall: Its a decent beer, better than most Pilsners but nothing to call home about. I like my pilsners to be clean and light so that i can session the hell out of them. At 10% this is not one you could do that with its a shark in an ocean of guppies!"
"Floral  sweet notes not dry or bitter"

"Classic look and feel. Very creative taste while still maintaining the pilsner mindset."

"Little syrupy. Afterburner! Interesting. Whew!"
"My expectations were high for this one (I was thinking something along the lines of an amped up My Antonia).  That didn’t pan out."

"Tasted like Budweiser to me."
"Dogfish Head Beer Thousand -----3/5."

"O - Other than some off the initial off aroma, this was a pleasant IP, would like to do a side by side with My Antonia."

"Swing and a miss. Smelled a bit off and tasted downright caustic."
"Taste:  Hides it's alcohol very well.  Bread, lemongrass, sweet grain and light fruit."

""
""
""

"Despite high abv, this is very easy to drink. A nice, potent pils!"

"Overall - Drinks a bit like a chardonnay, though with a thicker body. It's good, but I'm a bit confused about its purpose; if I wanted white wine, I'd go get a white wine. I was hoping for something more akin to beer! This isn't the first DFH beer I've had that wished it were a wine, and I'm guessing it won't be the last."
"Overall- One hell of a beer from DFH. Incredibly complex, the name is perfect for this beer. 10 grains, and 10 hops.....enough said. Furthermore, I've never had a beer this light in body with so much alcohol. It burns after it's down but not easily felt to the palate. But way complex, so much malt/sweetness/hop flavors going on. It really is unfortunate this is a one time offering. It should be available year round as it is excellent."
""
""
"Mouthfeel is thick, sticky, chewy. Overall, tasty beer. Interesting."
"If you're seeking a big pils, this will do."
""
"I thought I hated the idea of an imperial pilsner, but this was great.  Not too boozy, distinctive lager taste.  I wouldn't hesitate to have another. Merry Christmas. I'm drunk."
"Deep gold to light brown in color.  A fingernail of off white head covers most of the top.  I smell a very light malt forward body.  There's a coppery note in there.  This is almost a light Barleywine in taste.  The mouth is thick and carbonated."
""
"Unique and a very tasty beer"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not a bad beer if you like fruity malt beers.  The alcohol in the nose seemed to add an detracting note to this beer on top of a missing bitterness.  While I would sip this beer if offered to me, I won't seek it out."
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours golden with a creamy head of foam that lasts well.  Perfect color.  Dark like a good pils with some bubbles coming up to show themselves off.  Sweet malt on the nose and herbal hops.  Smells really good actually.  has a freshness to the scent. Sweet citrus peel backing on the nose.  Really floral.  Hops are devilishly sweet on this nose.  I like it a lot.  Taste is really well done.  has a good crisp carbonation and a firm malt base. Grainy.   It has a citrus fruitiness on a floral hops.  Good lager.  The ten percent is not a hindrance to the taste of the beer. it does add a bit of bitterness and bite to the drink but pleasant.  Hops are dank  and live up to the abv.  Well done.  Dry too and crisp in the finish."
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a bright, vibrant,  straw gold coloring with a steady flow of carbonation and a filmy, sparse, white surface coat. Aromas of subtle resinous hops, subtle tropical fruit sweetness, tangy caramel and biscuit in the backbone, and some herbal and floral highlights. Flavors are rich and heavy forward, with a solid caramel and candi sugar blast, immediately followed by a warming ribbon of booze. The hops are there, but seem slightly outmatched. Subtle bitterness, with a toasted grain backbone. The body is heavy, robust, and slick, and the carbonation fights to keep some lightness to the body. Sugary sweet and heavily toasted aftertaste, with a building booze warmth. Smooth, slightly dry finish. Big beer."
"Great american style lager. Great flavor!"
""
""
""
""
""

"Exceptionally drinkable for a 10% lager. A little on the sweet side, with sugary malts coming through a lot, but the hop presence is enjoyable. If some of the sweetness was gone, this one could be really good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Although I picked up no notable booze on the nose I get a lot more of it burning into my throat along with a vigorous grainy character and a big bitter bite to finish."
""
""
"Had to at least give this one a try, so I figured I'd get a bottle rather than dedicate myself to a full glass on tap at a bar. Clear amber pour, with a foamy white head. Looked good enough. Bland, grainy aroma. Similar taste...lagery, toasted grains, corn syrup, bland herbal hops, some fusel alcohol in the finish. Medium body, harsh drinker. Not a very distinctive brew. In the ever-expanding world of unique craft beers, DFH really needs to start stepping up their game."
""
""
""
""
""
"Light, almost bread-y lager that carries a kick you would be hard-pressed to notice."
"t/m/o - taste is definitely a lot packed in there...but again if I had to pick out a flavor or vibe it would be a soft grape on a stack of grains. Comes across a bit pilsner like...full bodied and has some boozy sweetness.  Muddled finish and a lingering aftertaste. Has a dfh vibe, but fairly refined and not syrupy.  Overall worth checking out if you dig dfh and or lagers and pilsners.  Could be a good crossover craft brew?"
"Tastes like a boozy Bud Light. Very disappointed."
"O: a nice lager with a dedicated focus on the grains and hops, and the muddling of so many actually worked rather well, creating favorable flavors and aromas that are good for the style while also distinctly unique."
""
""
""
""
"Subtitle flavor, slightly booze with a bread fininsh."
""
""
"Pours a clear crisp Caramel color. No head visible. No head retention. Very little smell. Tastes boozy as hell. Would not ever seek this again."

"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, bottled on 10/31/2014. Pours slightly hazy deep golden color with a 1 finger dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big lemon, melon, apple, pear, white grape, honey, cracker, bread, herbal, floral, grass, pepper, and yeast earthiness. Nice and unique aromas with good balance and complexity of pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. A bit too perfumey/estery in the nose. Taste of big lemon, melon, pear, apple, white grape, honey, cracker, bread, herbal, floral, grass, pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy herbal/peppery bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, melon, pear, apple, white grape, honey, cracker, bread, herbal, floral, grass, pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice balance, complexity, and robustness of pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; with a nice malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, fairly crisp/sticky, and lightly bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good imperial pale lager style. All around good robustness, complexity, and balance of pale malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A nicely enjoyable offering."
""

"Light golden body. Poured heavy and resulted in a small fast dissipating head. Big Sweet alcohol aroma. Reminds me of 120 minutes aroma. Not quite as strong smelling though. Very sweet taste. Good amount of bitterness with some hints of dark fruits. Tastes like a small barleywine."
"Very drinkable and smooth. Wasn't expecting it to be as good as it was. Again good job to DFH. Haven't been disappointed in my local brewery."

"This is a strong lager that is well made -the 10 malts and 10% may not be apparent in the taste but you get the feeling it is a bruiser even though the lagering has given some smoothness with very mild hop flavor with focus more on the herbal and noble-type flavors. There is a mild pilsner quality with gentle yeast in the taste adding a little breadiness but alcohol is subdued and finish is relatively dry which is pleasant. Overall I consider one of the better examples of this style- Dogfish head hasn't made a bad Imperial Pilsner yet in my opinion"
"Pours 2-3 fingers white head - Beer color is that of a ginger ale soda with a light copper color when the head starts to settle it looks like a fine glass of champagne with lots of bubble rising and a decent amount of perfect carbonation -Then as the white lacing settles on the sides of the glass as the head continues to die off the carbonation is very much alive. Beer did not come out of a bottle it came out of 1/6 keg. Beer is super fresh and alive.The nose smells of bread like yeast with a sweet smell lingering in the back. Tastes like sweet bread with a slight booziness and light trailing hops tastes that does not linger much at all. Very easy to drink beer type of beer you could get yourself into trouble lol.... with. Beer is simple and worth having. Nothing is bold in this beer its very weighted which is cool. To say it simply sweet bready carbonated light colored tasty champagne feel type of beer its cool I am down with it. I am feeling the Alcohol as we speak it creeps on you because it does not drink like its alcohol content. I would buy it mhmm it has that dogfish feel to it - Drink it while eating a white pizza they compliment each other very nicely cheers !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
""
"Overly sweet - seems like it is verging on a barleywine style but without the depth and complexity I would expect from a true barleywine.  Big and hot, but overly sweet and lacking in any real depth"

"Great combination of flavor, color. Smoth off the palate. Does not jump out and give you that kick some higher ABVs give but taste is good and is a nice alternative to have around in my beer rotation. This brewery has great, consistent brews and this one is right up ther, too."
""
""
"Love this brewery, but this beer tastes like a 40 oz.  It's all booze with nothing else to balance out it's bite. Very disappointing."
"Crystal clear deep golden color with a decent sized tightly bubbled white head that dissipates rather quickly. Aromas of light fruit and a weird oxidative smell thats somewhere between sherry and plastic. Some yeasty aromas and light bready malt. The flavor Is a bit fruity tart with light berry and hop bitterness. Light alcohol flavor and light warming. This one has a lot going on, probably too much, and unfortunately the flavors aren't meshing very well."

"Poured into a Blanche de Namur small pint glass.  Pours a light to medium golden amber with a thin slightly off-white head that dissipates quickly to patches, leaving light lacing. Aroam of bready malt with hints of caramel, apple and light fruit, mild grassy hops. Flavor is sweet bready malt, grains, light apple and pear, light floral and grassy hops, becomes sweeter before finishing with a semi-sweet bready maltiness with spicy hops and light, lingering hop bitterness. Medium bodied, more dense mouth feel than expected from the color. A subtly flavored sweet imperial pilsner, perhaps a bit underwhelming, but the flavor is smooth and balanced throughout. Nice finish. Kind of what I'd expect a domestic lager on steroids to taste like, nothing stands out, moderately sweet and pleasant. It is hard to believe it is so modestly flavored yet the ABV is totally covered. Interesting experience. One of the less envelope pushing Dogfish Head beers, but as usual an experience worth having."

"Second time was the charm. The first time I had this I was totally unimpressed.  This time around, I was much more impressed. Way more balance, subdued alcohol and a very pleasant overall flavor. Definitely way more interesting this time."
"12 ounce bottle, bottled on 10/31/14.  Served in a pilsener glass, the beer pours a slightly hazy dark gold color with about a half inch off-white head.  Head retention is good, and there's a decent amount of lacing.  The brew smells like caramel and bready/grainy malt, apples, and a general earthy/herbal aroma.  For the most part I think the taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but there's also some candied oranges, citrus peel and and a bit of pear noticeable.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's slick with a moderate amount of carbonation.  Overall I thought it was a solid brew, but it really didn't do anything for me.  Worth a try once, but I'm not sure if I'd pick this up again in the future."
""
""
""
""
"I've never been much of a fan of the Imperial Pilsner and this beer isn't going to change my mind. It's not much more than a glorified Malt Liquor."
"I love DFH, but they can be hit or miss. I consider this one a miss. It's just not an appealing beer and it's not fun to drink. Meh.."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Muddled. Confused. They made it to their destination of combining 10 malts and 10 hops into a beer that's 10% abv only to find that they've ended up in the middle of nowhere. I can't really respect this type of brewing, it's kind of like looking in a mirror while walking backwards to see where you're going. I'd rather focus on where I want to go, rather than the things I want to pack to make the journey."
""
""
""
"The spicy taste of hops and alcohol intertwine upon the finish, giving slight numbing with a peppery prickle and leafy, grassy and stemmy bitterness. Trending mead-like, the beer's aftertaste is honey and biscuit throughout."

"Grain bomb with a tiny hop presence."
""
""
"Poured a clear golden body with finger and a half of thick, fluffy head. A very nice looking beer, a ""classic"" beer look. Scents of lager yeast, medium alcohol, orange flesh and floral hops. Overall impression of aroma is of a nice, boozy lager, a combination of a lager and a very boozy beer. Quite nice and appealing. Flavor begins boozy with notes of alcohol, sweet malt, candied orange and floral hops. Middle opens further sweet, floral hop flavors and more sweet alcohol. Finish Iis sweet with the same flavors present. Aftertaste is lager yeast and light citrus. Overall impression of flavor is of an odd imperial lager, quite boozy, but overall good. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation and a slick feel. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a very good imperial lager, not bad. Overall impression is of a good lager, with a nice aroma, an excellent if boozy flavor and a nice mouthfeel that hides the alcohol evident in the flavor. Quite nice and recommended."

"Interesting, a bit unique.  Bold.  Very satisfying.  Has the crisp and subtle characteristics of a pilsner, but the big flavors of an imperial brew."

"O- DFH has managed to brew a beer that minces no words and is a true lager worthy of the imperial title. Complexity is there if you search for it, but it is what it is...nothing more, nothing less. Being that one of my favorite beers is the seasonal 'Czech Yourself Pilz' Imperial Pilsner from the C.H. Evans Brewery (aka: Albany Pump Station), I was excited to try this. Being that Beer Thousand has a slightly more 'corny' sweetness, I will give a nod to the Pump Station. Not for everyone, but if you want to know what a lager can be clocking in @ 10%ABV, look no farther than this limited offering from the trend-bending brewery. Check it out while you can! (4.25)"

"A so-so lager that lacks balance, primarily being overly sweet, especially at the finish.  The hop bitterness and alcohol heat also standout, but not in a good way. Unbalanced and heavy hitting."
""
"10 grains... Yep. Overly sweet. 10 Hops? Where? No perceptible hop taste in the bottle I tried. It is a lagered beer so consider it to be sweetened Corona without the skunk flavor. No perceptible alcohol either. It tasted like unfermented wort rather than beer. A pilsner is supposed to have a crisp clean taste. Either I got a batch that was not properly fermented or DFH is just putting out more crappy beer. Avoid this drain pour."

"Overall: This beer has some good tastes and quality but the overall combination doesn't quite meld well. The sweet qualities come over a little to strong and way out balance the hops. Worth a try to any fan of Dogfish Head beers or for the music aspect but not by a long shot a must get."
""

"O: Surprisingly drinkable for being 10% with plenty of the usual lager tendencies. Very grainy and malt forward, with the hops playing a very modest supporting role. Nice to sip on and enjoy"

"Generally not a fan of this 'style'. Aroma is corn adjunct, along with floral esters, perfume, and fruity notes. Flavor is sweet and hot, reminiscent of malt liquor, with contrasting sharp citrus notes. I just can't help the feeling of needing a brown bag whenever I drink an 'imperial pilsner'. Lacks the bitter finish and crisp character of a true pilsner."
"After my first sip I thought ""what is this""?  By golly it a lager!  Been drinking so many IPA's, DIPA's, Stouts & Ale's I almost forgot what a lager tastes like.  But a little different than a straight ahead lager. It's crisp and drinkable, but I'm not in a hurry to have another."

"Overall, this is a pretty interesting beer but not quite at the level of the Bell's 10,000. I would definitely recommend getting this beer when possible and enjoying it. It may be a bit weird, but Dogfish Head has always been a brewery for off-centered people."
""
""
""

""

"A very good beer: looks and smells amazing, tastes pretty good, and the math certainty works.  But it also could be a lot better.  Evil Power, as far as I've tasted, is the gold-standard for the Imperial Pilsner, and there are some other truly excellent huge, high-abv lagers emerging in this genre; this, unfortunately, is a tier below—though with strengths oddly beside—those instantiations."
"not my cup of tea, or beer for that matter, well crafted as this is smooth as hell even with the kickin' ABV but I am just not digging on this"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Is this the best pilsner I've ever had? Probably. But for me, saying ""best pilsner"" is ultimately akin to saying ""best Billy Joel album"" or ""best prostate exam."" But kudos to DFH for trying."
"Bottle. Pours a clear, orange color with a mild head. Rings of lacing. Aroma is very floral and perfumey. It is also very grainy. A bit of honey. Some booze in the nose. Flavor is well balanced and sneaky with the alcohol. Floral hops are again perfumey. Pale fruit, grain, pale malt sweetness, grains. Some cereal. Booze well hidden. Softer carbonation. Not sticky or anything. Not super bitter. Like a really well malt Malt Liquor. I was tentative to buy a four pack but they seem to be disappearing quickly. Better than expected."
"I'd say it's broadly in the Maibock in style- sometimes I'm getting glimpses of the old SN Glissade due to the hops- but there are so many other flavors and aromas that it's become something unto itself. That something that is hard to grasp also makes it easy to like, but hard to love, in my experience. Worth a try, though."
""
""
"It's a kicked up pilsner. Finishes very clean with almost no flavor that hangs around.  Kind of a cardboard after taste. Dry, little to no sweetness."

"Overall this beer is a very enjoyable. It pretty much lives up to its concept as a very intense version of a basic lager, and really works as a liquid companion to one of the best indie rock albums ever, Bee Thousand."
""
""
""
"Overall: Not terribly complex, but still tasty. It's basically just a plain, run of the mill lager, with the volume turned way the hell up. If that sounds like your kind of thing, then you should pick this one up."
