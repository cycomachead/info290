3.85,-0.5,,,,,,"1 pint bottle poured into a standard pint glass. Color is a somewhat unusual dark orange, cloudy and topped with a small but persistent amount of white head, around a quarter of an inch. Aroma is unique, full of Sorachi Ace notes (citrus rind, mostly lemon, pineapple, bubblegum, dill) and fruity yeast esters along with a moderate dose of butterscotch-like diacetyl. These fruity and herbal characters translate well on the palate. Quite sweet but with a strong underlying woody and herbal character as well. I am tempted to compare this to a Belgian brew with regards to yeast. There is ample pineapple, clove and coriander spice, citrus, strawberry and a little raspberry, and dried apple/pear flavor with the Sorachi hops (presumably) adding some subtle perfumed lychee fruit that I did not get on the nose. Malts are subdued in favor of the yeast and hops. Moderate to thick body, quite highly carbonated, smooth and drinkable but with a woody bite in the semi-dry finish. One simply cannot escape the Belgian yeast character, which manages to overshadow the malts and distinctive Sorachi hops, although the latter do add their own unique flourishes. Is this really made with lager yeast? If not, how is this beer an imperial pilsener? In any event, another offering from this brewery that offers some unique flavors and that defies any real attempts at categorization.","CalgaryFMC","Jul 27, 2014"

4.25,9.8,3,4.25,4.5,4,4.25,"Poured a cloudy golden body with a thin ring of foam, no real head to speak of, that reced to nothing, leaving no lacing. Not the best appearance, but decent enough. Scents of lemon, sweet spices, especially nutmeg and some slight cinnamon, pear, pale malt, yeasty bread, some floral aromas, and some grassy and hay-like aromas. Very complex for a pilsner, even an Imperial pilsner, with a lot going on, some of it very Belgian-like, other aromas very much true to pilsner form. The hops and yeast they use in this give it a very pleasant, complex aroma. Flavor begins with bitter lemon and other citrus rind that are sustained throughout, moves into some floral hops, spicy yeast flavors, some sweet pale malt and some hints of oak and vanilla in the middle of the sip. Finish is quite dry and spicy with a zesty, bitter and spicy aftertaste. Its a good flavor, very refreshing, bold, citrusy and spicy. Very different from other Imperial pilsners, with a lot of Belgian style spice and some unique citrus and flora hop flavors. Very well done. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation and a somewhat drying mouthfeel. Quite good, the drying feeling makes you want to sip more and the body and carbonation encourage sipping. Overall this is a very good Imperial pilsner. Its unique, using a distinctly Japanese hop variety to add some nice spicy, citrusy flavors that balance the sweet pale malt. Its aroma is also distinct and quite spicy like a Belgian, giving it complexity you don't usually suspect from any form of pilsner. Very good, highly recommended.","Auraan","Sep 27, 2013"

This beer is very easy and light to drink. It reminds me of a Belgian dubbel because of the yeast tangy taste that you get after the spice bites and light carbonation. I can tell the brewer paid close attention to detail in designing and brewing this beer because though it is a Belgian style, he made it his own with a good balance in all the characteristics of the beer from appearance to even the feel of it in your mouth.

I'd seen the bottles in the stores and knew they were expensive, so thought I'd be able to try it out. Most expensive beer I ever bought... Served in a very heavy 10 oz (?) goblet. Color was deep yellow with an amber center and a nice 1/2 inch head. Very light (subtle) carbonation visible. I remember thinking flowers--like sakura--in the nose (probably because I knew it was Japanese and predisposed to smell cherry blossoms). But I also remember thinking it was quite unusual in its hints of floral in the initial taste and a subtle and welcome sweetness--like sweet rice bread--in the body. Many different (all pleasant) flavors that ended in an ever-so-subtle hint of bitterness. Coupled with the richer and somewhat "smooth and creamy" mouthfeel, I enjoyed it immensely.

Of the beers I've had from the Asia region, this one ranks at the top of my list. Definitely worth trying if you have an opportunity. I'd definitely pick up a few more bottles of this in the future if I find it again.","jzeilinger","Jan 02, 2011"
4.27,10.3,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"D - This is a very nice beer, Hitachino seems to do quite well interpreting old world beer styles and this one is no exception. The soriachi ace is a very nice hop for this style with a musty, pithy character that compliments the yeast, but some citrus zing to help it stand out from other examples of the style. I have never had a beer brewed with this variety of malt before, but it seems to provide a bready richness that acts as an effective background for the hops to play out their role. Well worth drinking, I would love to try this beer on draught.","nickfl","Dec 20, 2010"
3.88,0.3,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Nipponia (a Latinization of Nippon, which means Japan) is a tasty little Japanese pale ale that features one of that country's contributions to hops. A price tag of $9.99 is waaay too steep for a second go-round, but this certainly was an enjoyable 550 ml.","BuckeyeNation","Nov 16, 2010"

4.03,4.1,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Malty and lightly citrusy sweet. Orange juice and hay, grassy, weedy wildflower hop character. Lingering traces of orange juice and even hints of grape juice or pomegranate oddly enough. Malty backbone with a complexity from the yeast. Medium bodied and pleasant to drink, though this seems somewhat faded by time. It's interesting, the Sorachi Ace hops lend a nice citrus note, but I can't help but think it was better a few months ago...","emerge077","Oct 21, 2010"
3.68,-4.9,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"All around, a solid, easily drinkable beer. Comes across as an IPA or American Pale, brewed with alternative hops and malt. Good subtle-but-not-boring beer. Could probably stand up to a wide variety of foods - lemon pepper fish, chicken seem too obvious. Worth a try.","Patrick999","Beers"

3.77,-2.6,3.5,4,4,3,3.5,"Pours a typical straw yellow - not inspiring, but at least the white head is thick, frothy and persistent. Aroma is mainly yeasty with a fruity overtone and a malty undertone as well as some sweetness. Flavor is malty and fruity with a surprising hoppy tone and hints of both apple and grapefruit, as well as sweet, sour and bitter touches. Texture is smooth and a little thick, just subtly tingly. Give it a try!","Cyberkedi","Oct 05, 2010"
3.5,-9.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This beer comes in a 550ml bottle brew pours a light golden honey hue with average carbonation that leaves behind a fast vanishing two finger head and some little lacing,the smell is barnyard funk,herbal hops and barley,it has a pretty average light mouthfeel which leaves you with tastes of orange zest,barley,yeasty bread and finishes with a nice,dry herbal hop hit of bitterness which leaves you thirsty and wanting another sip to whet the palette,overall i was really excited to try this brew as i do like this Japanese brewery alot but this is not one of their more memorable brews and for the price would rather revisit some of their other ones that where cheaper and i really did appreciate way more.","ADZA","Sep 13, 2010"

3.29,-15,3,4,3,3.5,3,"The beer pours very hazy, color is trapped between lemon and gold. A nice two finger creamy white cap rises, but it quickly disappears and lacing is practically nonexistent. The nose is intriguing, some Belgian pale malt fruity sweetness along with citrus and a hint of funk. After that nice setup Nipponia's flavor is a bit of a letdown. The sweetness has lost it's fruity character, there's no funk (but a bit of yeast spiciness), and the lemon is still present. There's also an unwelcome, somewhat rough hop bitterness that comes crashing through after the malts. While the nose was of a possibly interesting Belgian Pale, each sip tastes like an underattenuated and overhopped saison. The beer is surprisingly light (this is a good thing) for the amount of perceived sweetness, but carbonation is a bit much (although how over the top it is is hard to tell, Nipponia doesn't fit neatly into a style). I'm a fan of the Sorachi Ace hop (love me some Brooklyn Sorachi Ace), and it's used to good effect here, but unfortunately the beer surrounding it is a little poorly executed.","axeman9182","Beers"
