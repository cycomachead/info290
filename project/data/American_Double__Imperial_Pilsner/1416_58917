I had Hitachino’s Nipponia a while back, and this is also considered an imperial pilsner as this one is. So, I am guessing IPLs and Imperial Pilsners are considered to be under the same category, not yet specified by some experts. Of the two, Nipponia is superior in my opinion. Tilted smile is good however, and worth a try.","patre_tim","Jul 03, 2014"

It came in a 22 oz bottle and was a perfect size and ABV to share with 2 other people. Everyone enjoyed it. There is no hoppiness to the beer as would be expected with a pilsner, but my biggest pet peeve is when pilsners have an overwhelming amount of that strong pilsner malt, but this one did not at all. It was a great balance of a strong beer and a pilsner, if Imperial Pilsner wasn't written on the bottle I would have had a hard time putting this beer into a category.","mediumtommy","Apr 03, 2014"

Smell is of malt, grain, grass, and slight alcohol aromas. Taste is much the same with sweet grain and grassy hop flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel.

The liquid is a dull rust water orange, light in hue and more pale yellow at the rims and glass bottom, the widely dispersed tiny bubbles are active as they rise. The nose is quite fruity with pear, yellow apple, fig and peach notes, some pepper and then salted pretzels, more straight up malt than associated scents like chocolate, not herbaceous but has a stiff spine, some cornmeal but the good kind. Full-bodied, almost heavy for its type with an unusual emphasis on sweet citrus, a blend of lemon, grapefruit and orange, very dominant. Leafier here, the hops come through in a drying sense, helps balance out that citrus as well as the apricot, pear, mango, cantaloupe fruit. At times close to honeyed. The carbonation stays on the fluffy side and spreads it like glue across the palate. Buttered biscuits and some sweet corn but nothing in the area of adjunct land. This is a definite “take” on the style and not a classic rendition, as such more likely to polarize. But, in the end, it’s fun taken on its own terms and just thrown back in that spirit.","farrago","Mar 10, 2013"

Good lacing along the glass as you go. Aromas are blended well and subtle, with a toasted backbone and some buttery highlights, as well as a slightly sour character. Flavors are bold, with a boozey kick. Biscuity backbone with a butter sweet blending and some floral and citrus highlights. This beer is a mouthfull, but remains smooth and mid-bodied in mouth. The aftertaste is more of the toasted grain flavoring common of a Pilsner, leading to smooth, clean finish. Tasty beer.","GarthDanielson","Apr 16, 2012"

But in the end, the taste was a compelling, nearly seductive thing of subtlety and nuance that I can appreciate.

But alas it came with cork and cage and shall never meet it's potential due to that very fact.","Vdubb86","Oct 16, 2010"
2.95,-18.5,3,3,3,3.5,2.5,"Drinkability: compared to others in the style, this one just didn't cut it for me with a slightly unbalanced profile. Very slow sipping, and a bomber bottle is too much for one session.","Gavage","Oct 14, 2010"
3.85,6.4,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Taste is very similar to aroma, sweet pilsner malt flavors with dextrose for body, and some saaz hops for flavor. Its an earthy beer, not overly hopped, or overly sweet. Nice and mellow like a pilsner should be. Not a ton going on in this beer, but that is the point of an imperial pilsner. Crisp and clean taste with a higher abv. This is what I had expected and it delivered. A good imperial pilsner.","alpinebryant","Oct 11, 2010"
2.62,-27.6,2.5,3,3,1.5,2,"Bah, I am quite disappointed that this was so disappointing; I wasn't expecting much, but I was expecting a carbonated beer and this doesn't even deliver on that. Well that is $8 dollars down the drain, but there might actually be some potential here.","Gueuzedude","Sep 26, 2010"
3.08,-14.9,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,"D: Not a winner by any stretch, falls far short of the promise of Detour DIPA. Very disappointing.","argock","Sep 05, 2010"
3.64,0.6,3,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Drinks: very sweet and flavorful for a pilsner. Not one that I'll seek out again, but interesting to try nonetheless.","Phelps","Beers"
3.92,8.3,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Which leads us to drinkability. That falls where the flavor does - it's good but it's not great. There's nothing holding you back from wanting to drink more, but there's nothing there motivating you to want to drink more. That said, you might as well just have a decent Pils, or a decent helles bock.","NeroFiddled","0"

4.22,16.6,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Poured into a chalice a very nice hazy golden yellow color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger foamy white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, very slight yeast note, fruity, very nice hop note. The taste is malty, hoppy, some citrus, fruity. Medium body, ABV hidden very well, definitely not as hot as other Impy Pils. Very Drinkable, for the price you cannot beat it, well job done Uinta.","Wasatch","Jun 28, 2010"
3.55,-1.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"D: I was impressed by how refreshing it is, but it was way too malt-forward for an imperial pilsner. It felt more like an imperial helles than anything else. They really need to kick up the hops to take this to the next level.","BarrelO","Jun 28, 2010"
3.53,-2.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Refreshing despite the ABV, but this is a pretty average Imperial Pilsner.","BradLikesBrew","Jun 20, 2010"
4.13,14.1,4,3.5,4,4.5,5,"D: I don't know why the reviews are so low for this. It is spot on to style. One of the better examples I have had in fact. Dangerously drinkable to boot. Watch out for their crooked series.","aerozeppl","Jun 05, 2010"
3.26,-9.9,4,3,3.5,3,3,"A nice Father's Day gift from my wife. Pours a nice crisp golden color, with little effervescent bubbles streaming up from the bottom of the glass. Not a whole lot going on with the aromas here, a little bit of sweet malt and just a hint of the expected hops. Flavor follows along pretty well, somewhat crisp, but mostly sweet and alcoholic.","emmasdad","Beers"
3.16,-12.7,4,3,3,4,3,"It's a big beer but only from the alcohol content. The malt/hop content is completely dominated by it.","smcolw","0"
