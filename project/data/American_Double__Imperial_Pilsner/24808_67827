3.9,2.1,4,4,4,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, no bottle dating. Pours lightly hazy bright orange color with a 1 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, light caramel, bread, pine, and floral/grassy earthiness. Very nice aromas with bright citrus/earthy hop notes with moderate malt sweetness; and good strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, pine, light caramel, biscuit, and floral/grassy earthiness. Fair amount of floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of big grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, pine, light caramel, biscuit, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity of bright citrus/floral hops with moderate bready malt sweetness; with a nice malt/bitterness balance and minimal cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Imperial Pilsner. All around nice complexity of bright hop and moderate bready malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Apr 03, 2014"

I have never heard of this brewery before but I need to check them out a little more because this brew is something else. An IPA with a light feel. Freaking sweet!","Emnmarko","Jan 24, 2014"

3.79,-0.8,4,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,"Very good beer, although I fear that this one falls victim to the ""IPL syndrome"" that I've come to find with many beers of this style - the heavy hoppage of IPL's covers up the lager yeast flavors a bit too much, and you've gotta wonder, why not an IPA? I will say, though, that the lagering gives this beer a nice, refreshing, clean and crisp finish. Very good overall, and I'm glad that I picked up a sixer to share with friends.","tectactoe","Jul 14, 2013"

3.82,0,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,4,"O - This beer is listed as an India Pale Lager. I think we need a new category here on BA. It was a nice variation of a lager. It is not a flavorful as an IPA, but this is quite a good lager. I have had it a couple times and is a nice change of pace.","buschbeer","May 18, 2013"

3.42,-10.5,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Interesting take on the IPA by lagering, making it an ""IPL"". A little heavy on the Cascade hops for my tastes (I know the tendency with American IPA is to be ""all grapefruit, all the time", but too me it makes a dynamic beer style very one dimensional). There is an ester note coming through, perhaps from the yeast strain, that gives an almost candy-like sweetness as well. Medium body with long lasting highly citrus hop oil aftertaste that has a drying effect on the palate.","smalenberg","Sep 04, 2011"

4,4.7,4,4,4,4,4,"This growler is courtesy of a coworker who picked it up early this week. The growler was labeled as ""IPL", India Pale Lager. Very interesting. It pours a light bodied, bright bronze in color with a slight white lacing around the glass. The aromas are slightly hoppy, with a piney presence. It has the soft malt characteristics of a lager but the stickiness and pine resin of an IPA show through. It's interesting. It tastes of sticky, piny hops with a slight hoppy, yet this lager-esque bitterness. It's interesting. It drinks pretty light and is somewhat sessionable. It drinks fine and is an interesting hybrid. Overall it's a fine beer, yet a tweener and in between styles.","aasher","Beers"
