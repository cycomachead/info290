Aroma is hop-forward with citrus, floral, and pine. There is a little grain, too. Hops carry the day in taste, too, with a moderate bitterness that is less than expected based on the nose. A thin ribbon of sweet malts is perceptible in the background. Nothing shocking in the palate: medium body, crisp texture, average carbonation, dry bitter finish.","SierraFlight","Mar 02, 2015"

Combined with a noteworthy sulfuric note (not uncommon in lagers, but amped up to an overbearing level here), I just couldn't get into this brew. I admit that the Double IPL has historically been a touchy style for me, but Humulus was one I just couldn't abide.","breadwinner","Feb 02, 2015"

4.69,9.3,4.25,4.5,4.75,4.5,5,"32oz growler. Pours a clear copper with 2 fingers of rich and frothy bright-white head. This soaps the sides of the glass with thick sticky lacing. The aroma smells fresh, floral piney and dank, with bright and zesty citrus flavors straight up the nose. Tropical character mixes with sweeter bready notes to give this a ripe flavorful twang in the nostrils. The taste matches the aroma, which a fresh, zesty and resinous bitterness that lights up the mouth with a bright feel. Herbal and tropical flavors spread out, mingling with the honeyed and bready sweetness from the malts. Man, this is just juicy feeling across the back before things finish dry and piney with a pithy bitterness that sticks. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a crisp and tight feel that is undercut by a creamy slickness that has this just moving effortlessly across the palate. Overall drinkability is impeccable for 7% ABV. With this tasting like a fantastic West Coast DIPA and drinking like a super smooth Pilsener, I can say with a certain degree of certainty that this might be one of the best beers I've ever had. It's that good. I have wanted to try this one for a while now and it more than delivered. This gets my highest recommendation.","Kegatron","Apr 10, 2013"

4.7,9.6,4.5,4.5,4.75,4.5,5,"not only the best lager ive ever had (not even a close second), but possible the best beer ive ever put to my lips. this stuff is incredible. on tap at the monk on Colfax. the pour is glowing golden with an orange hue, mostly clear, and an inch of white thick whipped cream looking head that lasts, and is easily roused with a swirl of the globe. the nose is really hoppy, this was obviously dry hopped generously. the lager yeast gives it a crispness, and I smell some tropical fruit in there with all the bitterness. the flavor is just astounding, it has a very similar hop complexion to the pliny the younger, no kidding. its that decadent. the grains are light on the toast but give a lot of body, which I think works well with the lager yeast, a fuller bodied crisp clean beer with a ton of hops, its really a nice and new combo. so much fruit and hop oil here, ive really never had anything like it. the mouthfeel is also fantastic, lots of tiny bubbles and a full body make it feel like almost a nitro dispense, and the texture is so big and coats the whole mouth with this fresh hopped goodness. this is a beer that is worth every bit of its hype, it reopens the lager category as exciting for me, and it is another reason why the bruery is near the top of the brewing world right now. this is absolutely divine, and I cannot wait for my next one.

Usually I feel that Bruery beers are overhyped and underwhelming, but I enjoyed the thought that was put into this beer's design. This is the type of beer where the total is definitely greater than the sum of the parts; the interaction between the lager yeast and the hops alone makes this beer worth trying.","KickInTheChalice","Mar 14, 2013"

Overall though I thought this was great, I'm glad I had the chance to try it, and I hope The Bruery does more hoppy beers and sends this to Boston again in the future.","jaasen64","Feb 22, 2013"

Tons of citrus and pine. Taste is extremely piney... drinks a lot like an IPA (don't really have the palate to say what is an ale and what is a lager). There is a ton of fresh hop flavor...absolutely delicious. Nice and bitter! Mouthfeel is medium bodied and well carbonated. Drinkability is very high. Overall, this is my first encounter with this lager. Maybe after I have it a bunch of times, I will be able to distinguish why this is not a hoppy pale ale or an IPA. All I know is that it was yummy as shit.","DovaliHops","Oct 19, 2011"
4.47,4.2,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Taste, almost perfect, I think I like humulus session or xpa a little more, the yeast seems to just not be the same fit as an ale, but it could just be such a foreign concept to have a lager this well hopped. Have to have more to determine with greater certainty, either way, its still very good. Hides alcohol very well, a Bruery tradition. If you like the fruity yeast presence from lagers and are a hophead, this might be right up your alley.","Beerandraiderfan","Sep 20, 2011"

Lots of grass, pine needles, and unripe grapefruit. Flavor is based on crackery malts with a big grassy hop explosion. Light bitter grapefruit in the finish.

4.15,-3.3,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Pours a clear vibrant orange with a fizzy white head. This beer I call Sculpin-light because of how similar it is in flavor to that. However it does have more of a lager "bite" to it, obviously, as it doesn't have that fruity backbone. Still lots of flavor from the hops though, very citrusy, orange is predominant. Mouthfeel is also on the fizzy side, being a lager. Just a weird overall tasting experience.... weird but good!","MiScusi","May 10, 2011"
4.72,10,4,4.5,5,4,5,"Amazing drinkability. This is very complex for the style, goes down too easy, and is just incredible. This is a beer that has something for everyone","dbmernin83","Apr 23, 2011"
4.47,4.2,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Drink- I could pound this all day long. It has great well balanced flavors. Juicy, crisp, strong, soft. I have a crush on a beer. Damn, though those were just myths.","FosterJM","Apr 09, 2011"

4.67,8.9,4,4.5,5,3.5,5,"Pours pretty yellow/gold with a good amount of head/lacing. Smells pretty much like an IPA, hoppy and delicious. Taste is like a good IPA, bitter, hoppy, and still very refreshing. This is a very good tasting beer, i could drink this all night. Mouthfeel is about what you'd expect of an IPA, a little bitter, but nothing bad. If they're calling this a lager, it's the best lager i've ever had, and i would drink it non-stop.","localhost","Sep 28, 2010"
4.85,13.1,4.5,4.5,5,5,5,"Beer is medium to light in body, even with this high level of hop aroma and flavor, its not harshly bitter and it finishes completely cleanly. This is seriously a beer that I would have to monitor myself drinking due to the level of alcohol and the complete ease of drinking this beer. There is nearly no room for improvement and this was a GROWLER. The perfect beer.","drabmuh","Sep 11, 2010"

4.8,11.9,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Pine, citrus, the intense perfume of flowers; all the usual American hop suspects are there and I'll spare any further description of their character since we all know what American hops are all about. They're everywhere. Leaping from the glass to my nose, coating my palate, and lingering into a long, smoothly bitter finish. Malt doesn't even dare to rear it's head. It knows its place. Clean, dry, and bitter on the finish. This could just as easily be Chico as a lager strain. I don't give a damn what yeast they use it's still an IPA that's all about the massive hoppiness in my book. Get it anytime you have the opportunity.","bump8628","Sep 08, 2010"
4.43,3.3,4.5,4,4.5,4,5,"Tons of grassy, floral notes, just a great hoppy nose overall. Why is this listed as a double pilsner? There is really not much pils malt flavor here in the taste? I mean it's basically an IPA.... I couldn't have told you it was a lager if you asked me. The flavor is much of the same, crisp hoppiness, a little more citrus here complimenting the grassiness of the hops. I got some grapefruit throughout the finish. Firm bitterness throughout, but completely well executed without any astringency. I had no idea this was 7.2 while I was drinking it... an awesome beer. I hope the brewery continues to brew this I.P.L.","Ineedabeerhere","Aug 29, 2010"
4.25,-0.9,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"This was a nice, big beer that didn't show it's strength. I was shocked when I looked up the ABV, but by then...it was too late. Like I mentioned, I didn't get as much lager characteristics as other reviewers, but that doesn't take anything away from how good this is.","jeffthecheff","Aug 29, 2010"
4.27,-0.5,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,"Picked this one up in growler/bomber form via Charleston Beer Exhange's "Rare Bomber Thursday"... Pours a bright, hazy gold / orange with a white head that leaves sheets of lace on the glass. Smell is of tropical fruit hoppiness: pineapple, mango, peach - and some grassiness. Taste is more of the same - tropical / citrus hops with a touch of light grains - so delicious. Mouthfeel is light and crisp... cue the lager! Highly drinkable and awesome... wish I had more!","jpro","Aug 13, 2010"

4.92,14.7,4.5,5,5,4.5,5,"D: Well, this beer humbled me. Seriously. So absolutely delicious. I got the email from the Bruery last week saying that they were growlering Humulus Lager and I thought to myself, "Oh well, another Bruery beer I won't get to try." The very next day I got a bm from Derek saying there's a package on its' way to me that's meant to be consumed "soon". Imagine my surprise when I opened the box and saw a Bruery growler inside with a sticker on the top that said "HL". Thank you very much for your generosity Derek!","GbVDave","Apr 18, 2010"

4.57,6.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Poured a dark golden with a nice wheat head and a decent amount of lacing as it went down. The smell and taste were both fantastic. Loads of citrus hops, mostly orange; also, a bit of some tropical fruits. The taste went along very similar lines, with the addition of a nice bitterness that nicely balanced out the citrus and tropical flavors. The mouthfeel was a bit light and exceptionally drinkable. Very delicious--hopefully they bottle this.","Thorpe429","Jan 27, 2010"

3.68,-14.2,4,3.5,4,4,3,"Draught at the Bistro IPA fest. Hazy blond with a lasting head. Resinous grapefruit peel aroma with some sweetness and flowers. Clean and dry with a bitter finish and low fruitiness. Medium bodied and smooth. Good stuff, but not a standout. The lager yeast is nice because it lets the hops come through very cleanly, though I think they could have finessed the bitterness a little more and given the aroma a little push.","bulletrain76","Nov 07, 2009"
4.72,10,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,5,"Overall, well...I stand corrected. The Bruery has produced something that has blown my mind. After this experience I will most definitely be seeking out some of their more limited offerings.","rhinos00","Sep 14, 2009"

4.33,0.9,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Served in a 10 oz tulip glass. Cloudy, with a thick, yet bubbly white head. Golden in color and possessing a medium amount of carbonation. Aroma and initial taste of Cascade hops. My guess is that the only thing lager about this is the yeast. Think IPA or IIPA. Medium mouthfeel and bitter finish with a hint of fruit. A great IPA, not sure about how good a lager.","LittleDon","Aug 31, 2009"

3.98,-7.2,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"toro sd draft. smells like wet juicy sweet hops, but when you drink it you get a dry hop whit kind of flavor. maybe the ultimate extreme west coast hoppy beer that is super dry. very unique and easy to drink. just was super complex. i've been away from hoppy brews lately. would LOVE to try this with several other comparable brews. i think it would stand out but for me it was fun to try and not sure i'd rush out for more. then again this was just 1 tulip one 1 afternoon.","paytoplay","Aug 19, 2009"
4.84,12.8,4,5,5,5,4.5,"Draft at Toronado. Cloudy blond appearance, tons of hop haze on this one. Served with a finger of foam that retains well for a draft pour. The aroma is explosive and mind-blowing, loaded with pine, wildflowers, freshly cut grass, a touch of citrus and a bit of weed for good measure. Incredible. The taste, surprisingly, lives up to the aroma, with the slightest hint of malt supporting an enormous amount of dry hopping. Resiny, floral, fresh and crisp with a light body and the perfect amount of bitterness in the finish. Lager yeast is faintly noticeable but really, this is all about the hops. I really couldn't fault this beer in any area except for appearance, it's one of the most well-crafted lagers I've ever had and has a more complex hop character than 99% of the IPAs I've tried.","largadeer","Aug 18, 2009"
4.51,5.1,3.5,5,4.5,4,4.5,"D - Low bitterness, well-hidden ABV, great hoppy flavor - sounds like a winner to me. Glad I tried this one, even though I was initially not very interested.","MasterSki","Aug 18, 2009"
4.54,5.8,4,5,4.5,4,4.5,"Hopheads will want to seek this beer out, and I hope Bruery can bottle it soon. This is an emerging style (not really Pilsner) and the Humulus Lager could very well be the benchmark.","mrkrispy","Aug 18, 2009"

4.36,1.6,5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Calling Humulus Lager an "India Pale Lager" is an accurate descriptor. Perhaps more accurate would to call this a hop focused, unbalanced, in your face hop bomb, but it's a lager! If this were "just" an IPA, a Belgian IPA, or an Imperial Pils I would probably be more critical, but the idea that this is a unique creation gives them the full benefit of the doubt when scoring this one. Another +1 for creativity at The Bruery.","vacax","Aug 01, 2009"
