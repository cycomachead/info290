"This is a terrific imperial pilsner, and I grab one nearly everytime I see it on the store shelf."

"My in-laws always like to bring me new beer from their travels, and this one is from one of their trips to NYC. It pours from the bottle with a cloudy, muted, orange-yellow color and is topped by a giant, dense, foamy head. The aroma has a decent yeast presence, some dull, earthy/leafy hops, a little bit of bready sweetness, and a tiny hint of alcohol. The flavor has a nice contrast of dense, woodsy bitterness against a chewy, yeasty breadiness. The light carbonation allows a mouth-filling, resinous texture to develop. Overall, this one is a bit hefty, with a rustic and bold flavor profile that is quite satisfying."
"Hopped up Heineken with Belgiany yeast."
"On tap at Novare Res, many thanks for securing the keg."

"More grassy with lemony notes than the DFH version. Very clean and crisp brew."

"Big herbal, spicy, earthy noble hop nose over light grains. Pours slightly hazy gold under a 3"" off-white, persistent pillowy foam cap. Noble hop spice and earthiness are more noticeable in the head then in the body while the rich Moravian malts shine more brightly in the body but the two blend in the mouth giving the beer an enjoyable parfait quality. The beer has big malt and hops but everything is perfectly balanced. Medium body and very fine, soft carbonation."

"I like this one better then the American brewed version."
""
""
""
"Overall: Wow, this is a year old, and still has a lot of the hop character.  The nose has really dulled out but the flavor is still strong.  Im impressed it held up this well."
""
""

"A very pleasant surprise as I usually don not favour Double Pils brews, $8.88 for the 11.1 ounce fancy assed bottles is a bit much though."
""
""
""
"O - A big approach to a pilsner, the hop profile is dense and only one part of a very complex and very enjoyable beer."
""
""
""
"A very full flavoured and unique brew - full of rich fruity flavours. Very enjoyable, unique and refreshing. Hard to fault and well balanced."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Food match: This is a brew that would feel at home with a Thai noodle salad or light BBQ fare - grilled chicken, sausages, minute steaks, potato salad and coleslaw - a veritable everymeal beer."

"overall: very drinkable, creamy brew."

"O: Amazing pilsner. Only one Ive had that I like more is Humulus by The Bruery and its very close."
""
"A nice beer with a good malt and citrus base, some pleasant fruits and a good balance between flavours. The alcohol content was very well hidden and the beer was a good, highly drinkable one."
"Overall: this is the first Dogfish Head collaboration beer I have ever had, and it doesn't disappoint. Plenty of citrus hops and tropical fruits, with spice and malt. I still don't think it's worth AU$120 a case of 24 x 330mL, but one every now and then definitely won't hurt."
""
"T - impressive beer that is recommended."

"Overall: Tastes like a slightly old 60-minute IPA, but with the spicy lemon hop bill of a pils. Not refreshing enough, nor flavorful enough."
"It pours clear light amber with a creamy white foam. Aroma has lots of floral hops, with pine and grass. The hop aroma is sharp and a reminder that this beer is continuosly hopped. The first thing that hits when tasting is the agressive hops, the body is light to medium and despite the hops it is easy to drink."
"Over all an enjoyable experience."

"Probably the best beer of this style I've had. Wish it were cheaper. Super drinkabiity"

"***Overall, its a nice imperial pilsner. Nice floral notes and pale malt sweetness, with a fruity finish."

"D - Great balanced and hoppy imperial pilsner."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very interesting beer. Definitely an ""americanized"" pilsner. Quite hoppy BUT it's not anything approaching your average big name IPA or even APA. It's just hoppy...for a pilsner. The smoothness of flavors and their great integration really sets this beer apart in my opinion. All lot of pilsners are super sharp and crisp, to the point of their detriment sometimes. Great work on this one."
""
""
"O-- Both my buddy and I were very impressed by this beer. It is unique without trying too hard and good enough to want again."
"Kind of pedestrian, but fairly pleasant and enjoyable flavours. Maybe a good bridging beer for more extreme flavours."
""

"Picked up a 375ml - never seen it in this size. Dark hazy brown almost looks like a belgian strong along with the same requisite rocky off white cap (dont remember it being this dark). Very nice head that sticks around for the duration. Also to note, this bottle let out a very loud hiss when opened. Nose opens with bright citrus and biscuity malts, alcohol phenols, corn husk and some vegetalness, intriguing for a imp pils. Mouth hits right away with gushing carbonation and brings corn flakes, corn fields (reminds me of frshly tilled land - a bit of greeniness), dry malts and a twinge of hop bitterness - only bitter no flavor from them and finishes with bitter belgian spices. Refreshing and the carbonation does well to wipe away the flavor and nose to prepare you for the next sip. I actually prefer this to the dfh version which seems lighter in color (doesnt matter) does have an almost astrigent alcohol taste. The bdb version seems to be better intergrated and a well made beer regardless of which brewey it comes from."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O = Overall, a good beer, but not something I'd seek out due to the vegetal qualities."
""
"Taste is very bitter,spicy, maybe pepper, papaya, oranges, herbal notes and simply a hop beast. Dry and bitter finish, this is a great beer."
"Overall this isn't a bad beer at all. In fact I think it is the best pilsner I have had thus far. Love the fact that the bubbles keep on and keep on."
""

"Bought a bottle of this from Harvest Wine & Spirits in West Hartford, CT. Poured into a pilsner glass. Orange-amber semi-cloudy brew with an amazingly thick creamy head that lasted the length of the drink's life, receding into a petri-dish style head at the end. The hoppy, citrusy notes coming off this smell are amazing with a taste that just blew my mind, completely changing my definition of what I thought a pilsner was. The mouthfeel was a bit acidic in the late late aftertaste, but other than that, I can't find a single flaw in this beer. Loved it, loved it, and would absolutely recommend it!"
""
""
""
"Longer explanation short - it's balanced for what it is, just not dazzling - less would be more."
"O: very crisp and clean, complex for a pilsner and a very nice hop flavor. I dig it"
"I wish I knew more about this Birra del Borgo. I know to trust Dogfish Head, and know I've got a new Italian brewery to look out for."
"This is definitely worth checking out for those who are bored with the same-old usual lineup of approaches to 'pilsner'. It's different enough to be interesting and novel, but not so different as to be unapproachable."
""
""
"O- I rated the DFH version quite high. This is way up there as well. This is spectacular. Really glad I bought the bigger bottle and spent the extra money."
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours a dark brown with a fluffy tan head that laces. There is no sediment, but a slight haziness. The nose is a fierce competition between candi sugar and piney hops. Very interesting for a double pils. The taste is more similar to a Belgian strong than a double pilsner...I'm quite confused and let down. The mouthfeel really seals the belgian strong ale deal with a potent, palate-coating sweetness, biting alcohol, yeast and resinous hops. There is nothing light and refreshing about this beer. I will not try this beer again and don't know why I bothered."
"Carbonation could be higher really."
""
""
""
"I'd describe this one as clean. Very clean. Flavor has a real consistent spiced tone from the hops. Hearty and rich, though not too powerful in the overall sense. Smooth feel. More of a sipper, but it's a nice job. I'm interested to see what the DFH version is like."
""
"I'm not going to lie: this was something of an average brew. It's not bad by any means, but the version I had from DFH was much better, and I say this as someone who's not a huge fan of the maverick DFH philosophy."
""
"A little thicker than most pils, but it does have more going on than most. Works out well. Silky. Very pleasant. I've had a few of these recently and I like it more and more. Could drink a ton."
"This is slightly reminiscent of Shorts' Pontius Road Pilsner in that I'm not sure how close this actually is to qualifying as a pilsner. However whatever it is, it is quite good and an amazing beer I would love to drink again."
"Overall this is one mean hopbomb, a very enjoyable beer but not one I'd quickly drink more than one glass of."
""
"Overall an enjoyable hop-delivery vehicle. Not for those who want a lot of malt with their hops, but then again it's an imperial pils. Good collab."
""
"O-this is a great beer. Tastes fairly different to me than the other my antonia. It has more of a rustic European taste to me. It's very drinkable and enjoyable"
"Overall: I havent had many of this genre but this one is very good, clean and smooth."
"O - If this was only brewed once as listed, this bottle is getting old, which is reflected by the reduced hop presence compared to the DFH version I had not long ago. Still, pretty tasty and was probably even better fresh."
"D/O: This beer embraces its style in a way familiar to regular drinkers of DFH's overpriced strong golden beers. In this case it chases some traditional pilsner qualities but cannot entirely shake off a generic feel that also stood out in such beers as Pangaea and Sah'tea. It cleans up well enough in the finish, although it could use more sensory contributions from the grain."
"O/D - A pretty nice Imperial Pilsner. Too carbonated, making it difficult to drink at times, but flavourful and interesting. Easy to drink aside from the carbonation. Nice stuff."
"O-- Nice beer. Quite drinkable and a good palate changer. Good collaboration beer."
"Pours a hazy golden hue with a lovely creamy two finger head and lacing everywhere,the smell is perfume fragant floral hops,honeyed malts,grains and freshly cut roses,the mouthfeel is medium bodied and perfectly carbonated with tastes of redgum honey,floral hops,tropical fruits,lychee and finished with a very light tarty dryness and overall ive been looking forwards to this for a while and it didnt dissapoint one of the better imperial pilsners going around which would be perfect with seafood and i will definately buy again cheers."
""
"I enjoyed this beer. I can't remember which version I liked better, but both are good takes on the Imperial Pilsner style. Drinks almost like an IPA, which is why I think I like it so much."
""
""
"This is a very good beer, it is very drinkable and refreshing. I am getting turned onto the imperial Pils style and this is a beer I am going to be drinking more of, along with the Bruery's Humulus lager."
""
""
""
"O: Possibly one of my favorite beers overall, certainly in its category, definitely one to try"
""
"O: This beer is pretty interesting and I think that I enjoy it better than the DFH one. I enjoy the flavor and it is a easy drinker that could be sessionable."
"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a light orange-yellow amber with a two finger fine white head and lacing. Nice continual carbonation. Aroma of hops, caramel malt, lemon citrus. Flavor is dominated by the hops with a muted neutral malt backbone. Some citrus flavors and a dry, hop finish. Medium bodied and creamy. Quite refreshing. Hoppier than I'd expect from a pilsner. Well made and tasty. Quite similar to the Dogfish Head version."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I really liked this. I would like to see more breweries doing this style of beer."
"A highly refreshing pilsner, this is what one expects, yet rarely finds. My Antonia compliments a hot summer day for lunch or casual conversation. One can only imagine this would pair exquisitely with a raw bar."
""
""
"Bottle to tulip. Looks good; Smells good too. The hops are evident, which is a plus for a pilsner. Tastes great. Hoppy, but light and crisp. Mouthfeel is good. ABV is hidden nicely. Overall, a delightful brew - probably the best (imperial) pilsner I've ever had."
"O: I enjoyed drinking this beer. It has some very nice qualities that make it more than just a beer. It's definitely worth trying (if anyone is reading this) but I don't think I would buy it again. It's really like an overly sweet IPA. If you're a hophead with a sweet-tooth, this beer should be in your fridge."
""
"T/M: Well-crafted blend of hops and malt here. Hops, drying, crisp malt, and a solid body behind it. This is certainly not my favorite style, but the execution is excellent, with a focus on integration."
"The carbonation level is very, very soft. It makes for a drinkable beer, but it doesn't brighten up the flavors very much. Overall, this is an above average imperial pilsner. I do like this, but it has some flaws that bring it below the level of some more well-made beers in the style that I've had. Mostly, I can't justify the pricetag that this beer carries. It's tasty and refreshing, but not at all worth the double-digit price."
""
"O: first ever imperial pilsner I've ever had and this has me interested in trying more of the style."
""
"O - Not a bad beer in a style that I don't usually care for. Wouldn't mind this again. Easy to drink without any real alcohol presence."
""
"O-Impressed with this one. I could see it going great with a greek salad, or a fresh turkey sandwich with pickled red onions."
"Cheers"
"O - I've had the Delaware brewed version of this and I really don't detect too much of a difference. I am having a hard time distinguishing whether or not this is aged though. The hops are still very vibrant and there is a lot of fruitiness and bitterness, but this is balanced out by a great deal of mild malts. Overall a really nice collaboration. Glad I found the Italian version."
"Delicious and easy to drink. I love it when collaborations between breweries work."
"O: I really enjoyed this beer. It is very well crafted. The hop is dominant in this beer, it is crisp and balanced well with the sweet malt."
"O: This beer has some odd tendencies, but I can definitely taste the spirit of the imperial pilsner. It’s good – good enough to seek out the DFH-only brew."
""
""
"24.5 ounce bottle. Served in a pilsner glass, the beer pours a hazy golden/amber color with a couple inch frothy white head. Head retention is excellent, and there's a good amount of lacing. The brew smells like grassy and spicy hops, bready malt, and some light citrusy hops (lemon and orange peel). It tastes like grassy, herbal and spicy hops, bready malt, lemon peel and some apples. There's a nice light bitter hoppy finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's creamy, has soft carbonation and it's easy enough to drink. I think it's a good brew, but at $14.99 a bottle I'm not sure if I'd buy it again at that price. With that being said, it's certainly worth trying."
"o - a very good beer but not quite as good as the DFH version."
""
"O- Enjoyable and a good beer, but not the same as the DFH version, based on my notes and what I remember...it has been over a year since I have tried the DFH version, probably will revisit it soon. It cost more than a 750 mL of the DFH version so I probably won't be picking it up again, but I am very happy that I finally tried it!"
"Mmmmm - tasty! An unusual style but packed with flavour. Tons of aromatic hops, with solid malt in the background. The mouthfeel is nice; very smooth with a pleasing texture (bearing in mind that a typical pilsner would be quite light). Similar to a DIPA, and just as good. An excellent showcase of what Italian craft is capable of (with a little help :)"
""
""
"Rather hoppy, and oddly spicy that I wasn't expecting. The front seems like it is going to be a fruitful IPA but then on the back end it's very bitter and even a little malty. It's a complicated flavor, not terribly thrilled about it, but I'm warming up to it as the sips go down."
""
"O: Average beer and, for some reason, not nearly as good as DFH's version. I'm not really digging the concept of Imperial Pilsners either, even though 7.5% is not completely out of control."
""
""
""
""
"The imperial pilsener category is one of the worst beer styles known to man, but every once in awhile there is a decent one, usually because they are like a lager dipa. Just keep pilseners the way they are, they are better that way, no need to imperialize."
"O- Even though this is a 7.5% ABV beer, the alcohol is completely hidden in both the taste and aroma. A good idea of an imperial pilsner, have had it several times now and will continue to keep an eye out for it."
"O - This is a great beer, but I must admit I wouldn't call it an Imperial Pilsner if it wasn't printed on the label. If there is any character added by pilsner malt, it is buried under the hops taste and bitterness, both of which point more to a strong, malty IPA for me. Borgo has created a fine beer with DFH and I think it shows a hint of great things to come from them."
"O - I honestly was expecting to be dissapoited even though DFH was involved. But time and time again Ive been tasting Italian beers and been truly impressed. This is great stuff. Not just becuase DFH is involved, I will totally be on the lookout for more Birra del Borgo. Pick this up if you can."
"Overall I really enjoyed this beer, though I will say that the flavors are very similar to a few other DFH brews that I've tried, there's nothing really in this one that stands aside from any of their other beers. still a great tasting beer nevertheless."
"The CPJ"
"Overall: Wouldn't go out of my way for this one."
"Overall it's damn delicious and a great collaboration; no surprise that there's yet another beer with the dogfish head logo on it that I love."
"Amazing, but I'm addicted to this style. Yellow orange ambrosia-like pour with a fluffy white head. Smells lemony and sweet. Saaz. Smells like Saaz. Marmalade is what I taste. with the sweet and the bitter. Small, fuzzy bubbles cut like a Brian Adams' knife. Love that....the bubbles that is. Freshly mowed grassy finish. More please...."
"D - maybe not something I'd want to have all the time but the flavor was good."
"O: I'm giving the overall a bit of a boost because this is probably the best beer I've had labeled as an Imperial Pilsner. It's really hard to not compare the Imperial and American versions of beers as something to a good IPA that is similar in style, but I do feel that this separates itself from being too close to an IPA/APA and makes me believe the Imperial Pilsner label."
"O- great imperial pils with a super clean crisp taste..the 12.7 oz bottle was perfect size on this one"
"Feels dry, light, and crisp with high carbonation. A drier version of DFH My Antonia with more fruitiness, more flavor, and more finesse. The most recent bottle I bought was very thick green glass and thankfully it did NOT affect the hops character."
"Had this on-tap at the Brick Store Pub during their recent 14th anniversary celebration. Poured amber with very good clarity and with almost no head, still a fairly pretty beer. Smells quite acetic, with notes of peaches, lemons, and quite a few tannins. Obviously a far cry from the original, this beer has become a whole new animal. Speaking of animals, the taste doesn't really have any noticeable barnyard notes to it, but it does have a touch of funk. Other than that, it's not overly sour but does exhibit some acetic notes and the same peach and lemon fruit found in the aroma. Smooth, and all around a pleasant beer, but not earth shaking. For what it was, I preferred the original, but I still enjoyed sipping on this."
"This is a medium to light bodied brew favoring medium more so than the lighter side. It is modestly carbonated to the point of being perhaps visually over carbonated and lightly fizzy on the tongue. The alcohol is ever present in this brew in both flavor and warming effect, it hits home harder than what you would expect for 7.5%. The alcohol does not even attempt to be hiding, it shows itself in full force with greater boldness than anything else. This brew is a bit of a mess to me, it is not nearly as enjoyable as the DFH take that I previously really enjoyed. I had no problems finishing the bottle but this brew was a bit of a mess, I would not have it again."
"O: like the DFH brewed version this is an excellent imperial pilsener."
"Overall a great beer that twists a simple style into something complex."
"Beer is medium in body and thin on the flavor on the front palate. The beer overall is bitter on the end and mildly dry. Nice drinking beer overall but nothing too complicated. Just a solid beer. Definitely strong than your average pilsner. I'd have it again but I wouldn't pay for it again."
"Overall a great pilsner. A bit more hoppy than most but it is fairly balanced. I would definitely drink again. I could drink this as a session beer even at 7.5%."
"Overall: this seems a bit tamer than the DFH version. Still a good and refreshing beer that is easy to consume."
"O: Really enjoyed this one. Wish I saw it on the shelves more."
"The Italians did a nice job rendering this version of one of my favorite DFH offerings. I'm glad I found it and hope that my favorite beer store relocated it next to the DFH so they'll sell more."
"Bottle poured into a pint glass. Appearance is extremely fizzy and is probably the most champagne-like beer I've seen. It is a pale golden color with at least an inch of head. Smell is strong crisp hops with mild grains. Tastes are crisp hops and white grape juice with slight pine sap and citrus. Excellent drinkability, and solid all-around."
"This beer pours a hazy golden color with an absolutely massive head that retains very well and leaves huge chunks of lacing. The aroma is very nice, it's got a huge helping of noble hops over some pils malts. Alcohol is apparent. The taste is quite smooth, smoother than the DFH-brewed version, with some more subtly than it's American-brewed cousin. It's still very noble hop-forward, but it's a smoother hoppiness instead of the sharpness of the DFH version. The alcohol is also a bit more suppressed. The mouthfeel is a little less carbonated than I'd like, but the drinkability is good. Overall, a solid imperial Pils, I'm still not convinced that pilsners need to be imperialized though."
"As it warmed, very light aroma of sweet malt and a faint floral touch came out."
"Now where is the difference between an imperial ipa and an imperial pilsner? If the second is meant to have more malt sweetness, then this one is an imperial ipa"
"Overall - A superb brew and one that i wish i could get my hands on more easily... highly recommended.."
"Pours a light copper with a white head and some good, sticky lacing on the way down. Nose hits like an imperial pilsner with a bit more, as in addition to some grain and bread I got a bit of caramel as well, though it was fairly slight. Some European hops thrown in there as well. The taste balances everything quite well and it does taste like an amped up pilsner. Feel is light to medium with good carbonation. A very nice collaboration."
"I had this on tap at Max's during their Italian Fest. It's a well-balanced pilsner, but there's nothing very unique about it, which surprised me, considering Dogfish was involved. Golden-orange color with an off-white head. Smelled like it tasted... balanced but nothing special. Hard for me to describe any individual flavors. Mouthfeel was pretty good, as is the drinkability since it is easy to drink... nothing about it is overpowered."
"Overall I was told that this batch was not the best that's been made and I believe it. As the beer warmed and the diacetyl flavors faded it was evident there was a good beer underneath it all but unfortunately I wasn't able to see, smell, or taste it."
"Drinkability: nice pilsner. Probably not drink again though."
"Although I may be a skeptic of the style when a good beer is made of any style I get it love,this was quite good.Poured into a pokal a clear light to medium golden with a large frothy white crown,alot of tiny bubbles.Big bready pilsner malt aromas along with a big shot of leafy/spicy noble hops,the citric west coast hops bring a citrusy edge as well.Flavors have light honey-like sweetness along with mild white grape like some maibocks I have had,a real sharp peppery hop bite hits along with some overripe citrus fruit.A real nice lager beer,not to heavy with alot of things going on."
"D-Very easy to drink, the 7.5% feels like 4%. Great beer for the summer."
"D: Quite palatable and the unexpected creaminess was a pleasant surprise."
"Not as good as DFH Golden Shower, but not bad- a solid pils that goes down well on the hot summer nights."
"D: I feel like this is a beer that could catch up with you fast. quite quaffable but yet not something about it is slightly off"
"This beer is way up there when it comes to drinkability, it just hits the spot. I wold say that this beer would be a great starting point for someone who is learning about craft beer or if you are trying to ween a freind off Budweiser or Miller Lite. It is light in body full in flavor and pairs with just about every kind of food out there making this a great beer for just about everyone. For a hot day like today this is just what I needed to quench my thirst and if you come across this beer I'd say you better not pass it by."
"It's not brewed continusouly by Dogfish in Delaware. You know it's going to be good when even the foam is tasty. It pours with a big, creamy head. The color is a slightly cloudy gold. The aroma is big with grapefruit and hops. The flavor is very reminiscent of a medium IPA like their 60 Minutes. But it's somehow cleaner than that. The spiced hops are there. Lots of grapefruit, lemon, and coriander. But it slides down the tongue instead of punching it. The lagering really helps mellow the flavors without muting them. You could down many of these without hesitation despite the 7.5% alcohol. It's just that clean and smooth without sacrificing flavor. Why haven't I seen this before? Truly a great concept and a new favorite."
"I'm not a huge Pilsner fan but this particular one is definitely worth seeking out because it's more extreme and more interesting than a typical Pils."
"A different take on this style. On tap at Cole's, who brought it in again. Golden with a thick white head, that leaves lots of lace. I was Ok with the pils hops,I think some ideas that didn't come together and still not that drinkable.Neutral aroma.Drying."
"Collaboration success. It's just too bad that it's expensive in the US."
"D: One of the better Imperial Pilsners I've had. Delicious with great hop character, it definitely stood out from the other Italian beers I had on this day."
"This is a very interesting beer. Had a nice golden appearance, with a nice head lacing which sticks to the glass. Has some nice hop aroma, but a nice malt to balance it out as well. A pretty balanced beer overall. A good crisp light taste, but still a firm malt backbone. A very drinkable beer for 7.5% ABV."
"Taste is light and crisp for an imperial pilsner, the hops meld well with the malt with neither overshadowing the other, finishes a bit spicy."
"On tap at The Lion's Pride. I, too, was looking forward to having some Belgian beers, but couldn't pass this up. In a tulip glass the beer was a clear gold color with a voluminous white head. Lots of lacing. A very fresh, outdoors aroma, like newly mown grass. Hoppy, with a big malt influence. Kind of breadlike. A great Bohemian pilsner. Very drinkable; two went down fairly quickly."
"Reviewed from my notes. Served in a brand new Lion's Pride goblet as my first beer of their Belgian Beer Festival [I found it quite funny to order an Italian/American collaboration as my initial beer of a Belgian fest, but I didn't want to pass up this brew, as I'd never seen if poured before]. It has a very pretty tarnished gold color. It is very clear, as a good pilsner should be. It had a large foam head that was pure white; it left behind lots of lacing as I drank it. Surprisingly, I couldn't see any carbonation rising within the glass. It had a musty yeast aroma with some sour citrus mixed in as well. My impressions of the flavor were creamy, malty, and a bit fruity. There was a touch of crystal sugar I could taste, a nod to the imperial nature of this beer, but it was subtle. It had a medium body and a medium level of coating. It felt good, but was not remarkable. I found it to be very drinkable. I thought it would go well with a pork dish. I could see myself enjoying a few glasses of this over a great meal."
"Had this on tap at the Thirsty Monk in Asheville, NC. The light straw color and thin lacey head made me think this beer would be much lighter and Belgian in flavor. I was extremely surprised to find that this is an excellent well hopped pilsner. There's a good amount of lingering hop bitterness as this beer goes down, and it goes down very easy for 7.5%. Very impressed with this one, a definite must try."
"This beer has a lot of finesse going one. Quite enjoyable, very drinkable, if you could come across that much..."
"D - This is a really nice imperial pilsner, which is really quite a rare thing. It has a wonderful aroma of pilsner malt and interesting spice notes as well as an intense hop flavor that keeps it quite well balanced and drinkable. Unlike most other imperial pilsners it does not become cloyingly sweet and the hop character is complex and interesting instead of the flat bitterness that some other examples of the style display. I would happily drink this again, though I don't expect that I will get the chance."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, this is a good flavorful beer that is worth drinking for a while."
"D: This is probably the best example of a imperial pilsner that does well as a regular pilsner. A really great beer. I want to know what it is that I am picking up in the nose. Good example of a collaboration working well. Rare as hell but good and should be bottled."
"Just about the biggest pilsner ever. Too big to be very sippable, but impressive."
"A superb brew that I wish I could keep around. Nice job Birra Del Borgo/DFH. Sam you have done it again."
"Mini growler pour from Decicco's in Ardsley, NY. Very clear darker orangy golden, with a slight greenish, olive oil sheen. Near white heat that collects at about 1/2 inch, stays for a spell. Loose and light, leaving a collar and moderate lace/light sheeting. Lime in the nose, grassy hops and light malts. Full flavor brew, with more lime up front, bold and bracing. Some alcohol simmering in the mid section and then a moderatly snappy and dry finish. Clean and tasty offering. Interesting collaboration. Enjoyed the mini growler, but not sure if I'm a big fan of the style."
"Cheers!"
"Interesting beer, but one small glass is all I could ever see myself drinking of this."
"Post-Review Edit: I agree with johnmichaelson's review in that this does not taste like a Pilsener, and I think this beer is best approached without the preconception of Czech or German Pilsener style..."
