"This is a very tasty IPL. I believe the key to enjoying this beer is to allow it to warm. The complexity of the malt truly shines as the temp climbs. It is dangerously quaffable for its high ABV. Another winner from Indeed! I feel like I could drink the entire 4 pack but I need to work in a few hours."
"I don't really ""get"" the imperial lager angle...none of the clean crisp flavors I love in lagers in this one, even though there are plenty of interesting things going on in terms of the flavor profile: honey is quite pronounced, as are some relatively complex floral and orchard notes...fairly heavy and slick mouthful."

"Kind of a clumsy, lager yeast/honey mash up. It doesn't come together as well as I had hoped. Maybe the pilsner yeast had some trouble finishing this 8.7% monster."
"Pretty good stuff for a lager.  Can see myself drinking enough of this on a hot summer day and falling off a deck somewhere"

"Radiant golden brew. Smells like a standard lager nothing special here. Taste is honey and a little boozy. OK flavor for a springtime beer. One of my favorite thing about lagers though is their sessionability and at 8% this beer destroys that benefit."

"This beer pours a clear bright gold color.  The head is a massive two and a half inches of billowy white foam that recedes slowly leaving nice lacing.  The aroma is of honey, lavender, hibiscus, and chrysanthemum.  There is a lot going on in this aroma, and it seems that a different flower sticks out with every whiff.  The taste is sweeter than the aroma with lots of honey up front.  The finish is much more floral than the sip, and lingers nicely.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a smooth texture and lively carbonation.  Overall, this is a really well crafted beer that I can see drinking regularly when it is available."
"Overall:  Really good!  Of course you have to like sweet beers, but this beer is sweet without being syrupy or heavy despite its high ABV.  I hope I can find some more cans of this."

"Mexican Honey pours a hazish golden color with a big long lasting white head.  There is a big crisp malty aroma with hints of honey and spices.  The taste is very crisp, with a big sweetness and hints of bitter honey.  Good feel, body is a little weak, very refreshing.  Overall its different, good sweet flavors."

"This was an interesting beer.  At first I thought it was just ok and hid the alc. content very well.  I picked up on the honey flavor early on but it changed a little the emptier the bottle got.  It definitely grew on me  the more I drank.  By the time I emptied the bottle I couldn.t believe it was already gone.  At first sip you think it is just ok but by the end you are wanting more and wondering where it all went.  Another great beer by the guys at Indeed."

"Overall: A pretty good take on a bigger Pilsner. The added honey adds a nice sweet kick without making things overly sweet."

"Overall: Good Imperial Lager with lots of taste and a nice citrus and mead profile from the Mexican Honey. I like the way honey can both provide a sweet taste and a dry finish. Could have used a little more hops for balance instead of primarily relying on the dried out honey finish, but very good nonetheless."
"Has some amazing features. Keep these unusual beers coming Indeed. Another winner."

"A clear yellow gold color with a flimsy white film on top but very impressive lacing. The aroma is an odd dank rotting fruit & vegetable medley. Some white grapes and potato. Not highly attractive. The flavor keeps you on guard with a boozy vegetable funkiness that is hard to warm up to. There are some bready characteristics and an unusual peppery idea that is unlike most chili pepper type brews. It's a bit of a chemical idea here in conjunction with the alcohol and not thrilling to these taste buds. There's a sickly honey sweetness in there but it's very hard to define, like water chestnuts with a swampy malaise. Theres a little bit of lemony grass hop in there but it doesn't rescue this in my mind. It's pretty much a medium bodied brew with a tangy clean feel but overall I'm not planning to revisit this Frankenbeer."
