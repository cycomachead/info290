"On the sweeter side and I loved the buzz."
"I like it because it is basically a balanced 'beer' flavor. Plus it has the coolest label I've ever seen."

"I may find better in the future, but for today, this is one of the two beers that got me started paying attention. So, for now, I have a loyalty to Pilsener Bohemian Style and a couple of breweries."

"Not a well-done beer. Not sure who this is supposed to appeal to: pilsners are one of my favorite styles, but this is not a pilsner."

"Ummm...amazing? I really, really like it, however I will say that I don't know that it's leaps and bounds ahead of a good standard pilsner, and in the realm of doubles, I think I liked Uinta's Crooked Smile a bit better. Excellent take on the style, though, and i would totally get it again. It's in my 4-pack club now."

"If I forget this is suppose to be any kind of lager, it is just a middle of the road DIPA. I am not sure what a Double Pilsner is suppose to be, but this is not what I have in mind. Fails miserably on style points. Really just an average DIPA that happens to be made with a lager yeast that seems to be fermented at warmer than normal temperature."

"Poured like a dense amber cloud, very lite head, one finger lacing, a few bubbles very little percolation. Mouth feel Bohemian pilsner, for sure. Taste refreshingly bold. At 8.1 ACL exceptionally smooth. As the owl on the label stares into eyes, for pilsner drinkers, a wise choice. Cheers"

"Poured a beautiful golden yellow with two fingers of pure white head. It looks like what a quintessential lager/pilsner beer should look like, like every picture in media one has ever seen. Excellent. Scents of pilsner malt sweetness, Bohemian hops and some very slight citrus. A nose very similar to many a pilsner, but with a unique, American twist. I like it. Flavors of grapefruit, grapefruit pith, citrus and crystal malt sweetness, but with a nice Bohemian hop character present as well. It balances the bitterness with the sweetness as a good pilsner should and is quite pleasant in it's taste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. A bit heavier than a normal pilsner, but fitting an American Imperial Pilsner. It was still quite easy to drink and was not unpleasant. Overall this was a unique, yet familiar beer. It had the hallmarks of the classic pilsner, but with the twist of American Craft. I greatly enjoyed it, and would go back to it again."

"O- Paired with a spicy burger at The Foundry in Westport, KC. Simply put, my favorite pils ever."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I'm not a pilsner fan by any means but this one is really good. It has the crisp and refreshing characteristics of a pilsner but isn't watery or boring. It could use a bit more complexity in the smell and taste department but I would still drink this again."
""
""

""

"there is something off about this beer. I love pilsners and I seek them out as much as possible. I also really dig most of the brews from Odell. This one however, the Double Pils is a disappointment. I recently had very fresh on tap and fresh in the bottle and in both cases the alcohol imparted a medicine like taste and smell. I don't enjoy it and will not buy this one again. it promises to be much better for a Double Pils from Odell. maybe it's the most recent batch."
""
""
"Overall: OK, this beer is not horrible. But it really does not float my boat."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, probably a one-timer for me. The style intrigues me, mostly because the first double pils I ever had was fantastic (and unfortunately a one-time release) and I've been searching for an equivalent ever sense. This definitely was not it, in spite of the pretty snappy looking label."
""
"Overall: I wouldn't consider myself at all knowledgeable on pilseners, but I found this to be an enjoyable if somewhat unexciting beer. I found myself wanting a bit more complexity, especially for something that was 8% Abv, though I appreciated the hop flavors the more I drank it. Very drinkable for 8%. Paired pretty well with Chinese take-out."
""
""
""
""
"Seems my past experiences have been pretty enjoyable with this beer. Maybe this batch isn't quite up to par (freshness date on bottle is 9/12/13A). This is my second bottle from this four-pack (had the first last night: same overall impression)."
"Overall: I was pretty letdown by the appearance, but there was nothing bad about the drinking process. It fit its style pretty well from what I've tried and did not even notice the high ABV. Odell could (and can) improve on this one, but so far so good."
"I could drink Albright exept the 8% abv"

"Final Thoughts: If I was drinking this blind I'd probably think it was lager version of Odell IPA. It has that great hop flavor and juicyness that they pack most of their brews. Would I drink it again? Yes, wish they'd make a sessionable version!"
""
"This poured out as a slightly hazy looking yellow color with a strong white head on top. The head retention on this beer is very impressive since its a high abv. The smell of the beer is malty, there are some hints of grass in there as well some hops. The taste of the beer is grainy with a decent sweetness to it, there is also some booze heat in there also. The mouthfeel was a little on the creamy side I thought. The body was medium with a solid amount of carbonation. Overall it's not a bad brew just not as impressive as I was hoping for."
""
""
"O - This is my first Imperial Pilsener, but this stuff is incredible. The ABV is undetectable and the flavour profile makes this brew insanely drinkable. I will definitely be searching this stuff out next time I head south, and I highly recommend this brew. My biggest problem with this beer was that there was only one on the shelf at the store."

"Good beer all around"

"I had never heard of a double pilsner before this beer, so I was pretty curious. Hey, Odell makes quality stuff, so it was a safe order. I got it on draft, and the look was classic pilsner . . . Clear and golden. Like most pilsners, this one has a very faint , slightly cleaning fluid smell. The taste is light and crisp. But with the higher than average alcohol content, the taste also had a slightly bitter bite to it. Not an unpleasant beer. Just, guess, ""meh."""
"Cheers!"
""
"O: Overall this was another solid brew from Odell's. It's a full flavor beer while very drinkable at the same time. Although it lacked the wow factor that some of their other beers provide I would buy it again."
"Finish is clean. Highly drinkable, frames all the right elements of a well crafted pilsner. Delicious on tap."
""
""
""
""
""
"I remember this as being better. From the 12 oz bottle that has been in my cool basement at least six months."
"I haven't had a good double pils in a while, and this is the perfect beer to draw me back to the genius of this oft overlooked style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Low C-"
""
"I wish they had a regular pilsner as the extra heft isn't worth it."
""
"Would drink this more often if it was a little cheaper. Screw BMC, there needs to be more big pilsners like this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A pretty good amped up take on a pilsner. Very full and bready with a nice spicy hop presence in the back end."
""
"Underrated. This imperial pils was first introduced to me years ago and I remember loving it. And I still do. It has a great fullness in the Pilsen crisp hop, yet the moxy and complexity of a full-bodied beer. Odell has done it again. The alcohol isn't noticable but the richer maltiness (than most Pilsners) is noticeable...in a good way that adds complexity. It drinks like an ale."
""
""
"About a half an inch of white froth that laced the glass quite well. A light straw color, slightly cloudy and well carbinated. Not much of an aroma, and a very light taste with florals and some alcohol. Some hops come out on the back end. I thought it was a pretty good beer for the style- not may favorite style, but a decent beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a light yellow with an orange hue, effervescent with bubbles continually rising to the surface. A half thumbs width white head.An aroma of hay, cracker, and a hint of citrus. Flavor matches the aroma quite well with a strong malt backbone giving it a nice sweetness and cracker taste, some hay and grass, and the slightest hint of lemon. The alcohol is dangerously hidden on this one A silky, active medium bodied mouthfeel to this. Odell with another fine beer that hits the spot as I sit back and watch some Rockies baseball. I don't care for pilsners but they got me to enjoy this one. The high abv to this makes this a tease, as this beer strikes you as a great session beer but at 8% it will get you into trouble really quickly."
""
"pours a clear light golden color with a small white head. smells like sweeter german malts and floral hops, very delicate for an double, very unassuming. flavor is mild too, malty but in a refreshing way, not a filling way. very light hops in the finish. you would never guess this was over 8% abv. mouthfeel is nice, very prominent carbonation makes it easy drinking, and the just medium body is perfect for this beer. potentially a nice session beer despite its strength. odell does not have any bad beer, and this one is no exception. very well made, a good spring seasonal, but not the most exciting brew in their lineup. worth a try for sure though"
""
"Easy to drink considering it's a bit over 8%."

"Chewy body, herbal hops, syrupy malts, and a kick - nails the style. Can't drink more than one, but shouldn't anyway. Cloys a bit; hops could clean up a bit more, but I'm gonna give it the benefit of the doubt and put that down to age (labelled 5/26/11 - forums tell me that's a best-by date.)"

"Overall - A decent enough double pilsner but nothing earth shattering... worth a try though.."
""
""
"One finger pure white head, small bubbles, medium dissipation with decent lacing. Very hoppy nose for style, big floral notes, some malty sweetness in the middle. Taste mirrors nose, one of the most hoppy pilseners I've had, quite tasty. Mouthfeel is medium, real good effervescence, fairly dry finish, though the ABV is fairly noticeable. Another winner from Odell, definitely worth a try."

"Overall a tasty Double Pils. Doesn't smell like much but the flavor is nice and it isn't harsh at all."
""
""
"After having and loving their Double IPA, Myrcenary, I had to try the double pilsner, but swapped half of the 4-pack out for more Myrcenary. Glad I did. While Double Pilsner is a fine beer, it doesn't measure up to the Double IPA. My biggest problem is that the flavor is too buttery without the requisite peppy citrus hop punch I expected. Besides disguising it's ABV of 8.1% remarkably well, there really isn't anything special about this beer, which coupled with the price tag of $2.50 a bottle, is enough to keep me from picking up more of this in the foreseeable future."

"amber with a nice cap of white hanging over the top of the glass. Nice rich looking head of foam on the top of the glass here now as well, nicely done I have to say. Aroma immediately is a bit boozy with hints of grass, touches of hops, and a light fruit note that seems to pick up the warmer it gets. Interesting flavor profile as well here. Not at all what I was expecting. Hints of citrus, a touch of herbal, floral notes and a really nice and well laid out malty background."
"Overall this is my first experience with a double Pilsner but I enjoyed it. Tastes like a very sessionable beer but the 8% abv suggests otherwise. I will let you know tomorrow."
"I like this, but it isn't what I was hoping for in the taste department. Still a nice beer by a great brewery."
"Overall: excellent beer. This may be the best double pils I have tried."
"Well balanced mid-bodied imperial pilsner with nice malty tones. I love to have a nice refreshing pilsner every now and then but this one really takes the cake. This has been the first beer I have had the pleasure to enjoy from Odell and overall I am impressed."
"Odell Double Pilsner: When buying a four pack for over $10, you expect something special. The Odell Myrcenary Double IPA was great, so I figured I should try their Double Pilsner. Once in the glass, you will see a clear, straw colored body, with a very average head. Nothing to write home about, and you are wondering if money was well spent. But the aroma is fantastic, the head lasts right to the bottom, and the flavor is top shelf. Very smooth, and despite appearances, this is not a light beer. It delivers a sophisticated range of flavor that any serious beer drinker will appreciate."
"Overall - As stated, I’m just now breaking into imperial pilsner territory. I’m no authority here. This beer falls neatly under the “clean” category - neither spice nor bitterness seems to crop up from malt or Noble hops. The ABV is hidden, but behind what I couldn’t say. My last foray into the imperial pils was fruitier, with a lot of yeast character. This one seems to have a palette all its own. I’ll be sure to edit this review if I get future insight."
"mouthfeel - drinkability is crazy for a 8 percent beer. heavy carbonation, medium to heavy body for the style."
"O- i was surprised by this beer's taste profile, but nothing else about is that extraodinary. if you find it on tap, then give it a try, but i wouldn't seek this one out."
"O: Very tasty, great choice for fall, heavy enough to satisfy and warm you up without being overwhelming"
"D -- Very nice Impy Pils, solid and worth a try and repeat."
"Very refreshing, very drinkable, and full of subtle flavor."
"This is only my second imperial pilsner (Boulevard’s Collaboration No. 1 being the first). I like it quite a bit. Initially I thought maybe it was a tad too thick and sweet, and could use a bolder hop bite. But really, it’s a nicely balanced big beer that’s easy—and enjoyable—to drink. Not sure I’d buy a four-pack of it, but a single certainly and on tap somewhere definitely."
"O-- Quite refreshing for a bigger bodied Pilsner. Alcohol is evident here and there but it hits the marks of what a Pilsner is. Something I would want a lot of and a good summer beer. Another reason why I am a homer on this brewery. They rarely make duds."
"O- I was impressed with this beer; usually do not enjoy the pilsner style beers, very tasty, and balanced, easy drinkability as well."
"Overall a good imperial pilsner from a brewery that i am loving more and more with everything i come across from them."
"Having enjoyed this one immensely in the past (if memory serves), I was still leary of picking up the new $10/4packs (previously $9/6packs), although I eventually did due to an upcoming trade. Poured a crisp golden yellow color with a fluffy white head. Aromas of slightly floral hops, biscuit and pepper. On the palate, this one was light to medium bodied, with flavors of hops, biscuit and a slight pepperiness."
"Overall another solid beer from Odell!"
"O: Overall really nice Imperial Pils. I found it to be very enjoyable, while on a hot summer day, this brew is refreshing, while still packing the warming punch of a winter warmer and getting the ABV on your side to get the task at hand completed. Well done."
"6/25/2011 - Summer is putting its foot in the door here in Colorado, sweating and heaving with awkward heat. The rest of us emulate summer, panting and clamoring for panaceas to the heat. It's time to put away the stouts and porters for good and find some lighter brews. Today's cooling agent is the O'Dell Double Pilsener. I've been slowly consuming my four-pack since May, but I'm finding it's just as much a Spring beer as it is a Summer beer. This dandelion yellow beer takes on a beautifully chilled haze, and beckons for the drinker to share in it's thermal alms. Before I indulge (desperately and greedily, with beads of sweat racing across my face) I take in the aroma - a fresh and balanced pilsener aroma with corn and fresh cashews, and not too dry. The taste is refreshing, cooling and engaging - it's a light flavor objectively, but a relatively intense pilsener, packed with flavor. O'Dell's Double Pilsener doesn't rely on alcohol to mask clumsy flavors. It's open and honest, packed with pilsener goodness, and perhaps the closest I'll come to the flavors of a fresh Pilsener Urquell. Roasted corn, dandelion petals, and a superbly executed bitterness all make the O'Dell Double Pilsener a beer worth splurging on, and a fine brew for a late summer afternoon where the winds are as lazy as us, the awkward guests to an burdensomely hot summer day."
"D: Super drinkable. Really nice beer from these guys."
"The hopping is the most unique part of this and I'm still deciding if it works. I'm conflicted at this moment."
"o: very interesting brew.. definite winner in my book. very refreshing.. had to keep reminding myself that this wasnt no ordinary pils."
"Overall very light and subtle and well balanced. Interesting and spicy and slightly floral and sweet but without pushing the pilsner envelope past the limits of the style. A bit too drinkable for the ABV almost. Great beer, worth the price tag (every now and then)."
"O. Overall this is really a good beer. Imperial Pilsner is one of my favorite styles and Odell's does not disappoint. A very easy drinking beer that is not flashy with big bold flavors, but excels in the simple things."
"Overall - very interesting beer!! I love the morphing quality of the taste!"
"This is really good and drinks well. The flavor will appeal to many as it is not overbearing, yet satisfies. A really nice beer for the style."
"Clear golden body. Thin tight white head. Awesome aroma. Perfect pilsner malt aroma...bready and cracker like. That's all I need right there, but there's also a little lemon and hay. Perfect A/V for the style. I don't need a 10% or 11% hot bomb when I have a Double pilsner. 8% is perfect. And there is hardly any alcohol noticeable in the flavor. Adds a little dryness to the mouthfeel perhaps, but nothing else. Body is medium or so and the carbonation is medium at best. Could use a little bit more CO2 in my opinion. Flavor is quite nice and the bready, biscuity, doughy, cracker like malt base is the showcase. Hops add a little hay and lemon. Very smooth and very drinkable."
"O-Really drinks more like an amped up Helles than a Double Pilsner. Lacks the spicy hopiness I was hoping to see but is a very tasty lager with some heft to it. The lemony hops are fine but would prefer a bit more spicy hop feel."
"O/D - Deceivingly drinkable - easy on the palette and hidden alcohol. Although no one would ever confuse this for its single strength brother."
"Medium bodied, very smooth but sticky sweet residual feeling instead of a crisp dry finish."
"I can only think of one or two other Pilsners I'd enjoy this much. Another job well done here."
"The head drops a thick crown of lace, clear and bright yellow color. Spicy herbal hops, grassy with a sweet biscuit and clean alcoholic nose. Creamy medium body, smoothness runs deep. Maltiness peels back another flavor after each sip as it slowly warms up. Biscuity, doughy, pasty flour. Bitterness is pretty high but does not go above any other flavor. Alcohol is very warming and very clean. Taste buds have their work cut our for them here, a bit too drinkable for a bigger beer but I'm not complaining."
"Overall: Surprisingly refreshing for such a high abv beer. That said, a standard Pils would be more refreshing, so imperializing a style that is meant to be light and refreshing is slightly odd. However, the taste is great, so maybe that is the whole point. If not for the residual sweetness and aftertaste, this would be a home run."
"Double the alcohol is well hidden but it also seems that the malt was doubled which hurts the crispness and sweetens the beer. A nice flavorful pilsner but one that I will take much colder the next time around."
"Golden color in the glass, light and fizzy. Nice carbonation, quick white head with minimal lacing. Aromas are light and bready, decent hop presence. Flavor is spot on American Pilsner, crisp, light, doughy, but fuller bodied than expected. Very drinkable, not a big fan of the pilsner style in general, but I could do this one, has the strength and body that I look for in other styles of beer."
"I'm really not into pilsner but since it's a 'double' I figured one 12 oz bottle would be fine and I was right, it's crisp, clean, refreshing and worth a try. If you like the pilsner then you must get it."
"I can only imagine this beer to be like a Blonde Bock that has been over hopped. I love a Blonde Bock, the malty sweetness is awesome. I almost feel that this beer would have been a great bock if they had laid off the hops and the salty finish really kills it for me."
"Comes off more like a pale bock, maibock or one of those 7%+ eastern european strong lagers, rather than a double pilsner. I would like the hops to shine through more, even be on the aggressive side. I'm not so into these maltier double pilsners. When I think of pilsner, I think of hoppy lager. The soapier, the more I like it."
"Overall a very enjoyable pilsner and at such a high alcohol content this one could be dangerous."
"Overall, another well done beer by Odell. With a few minor tweaks this could be a world class beer. Would recommend this to fans of the classic pilsner styles."
"This beer pours a clear spun gold color. The head is one and a half inches of bright white foam that recedes slowly into a quarter inch cap of lacing. The aroma is of grass, and spicy noble hops with a nice malt backbone. It isn't the most complex aroma, but it is strong and what is there is very appealing to me. The taste is considerably maltier than the aroma. It is almost maibock like. There is a long grassy finish. There is also a present but well integrated alcohol note. The mouthfeel is full bodied with moderate carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is a great beer that I will surely drink again."
"Smells and looks nice, but as far as taste, this reminds me of drinking Colt 45 when I was 19. I expected something crisper and cleaner, or at least balanced. A rare miss for Odell. Grab their IPA instead, or St. Lupulin when it's in season."
"This actually does remind me of a Helles Bock more than anything, especially the malt character with its pale grain sweetness. This doesn't have the drinkability and lightness that a normal strength Pilsner should have, in fact I wish that it did somehow; it would be nice if this was more like an equivalent of Pliny the Elder. While I wasn't expecting this to be quite as refreshing as a Pilsner, I was hoping for more expressive hops and a touch less malt than is here; like I said this strikes me more as a hoppy Helles Bock (there are even traditional German examples of this), than a Double Pilsner. Somehow a bit dissapointing in the end b/c of this last; this would likely hit the spot in the March time frame of the year, but is just a bit too sweet and chewy for me at this moment."
"Overall decent. I can't say I've had many examples of 'double/imperial pilsner' but this is a nice clean balanced beer overall. According to the description there should be more hops presence. Probably a good beer to have a BMC drinker drink side by side to introduce him/her to good beer."
"PS: Fuck ""double"" everything, really. Excluding Imperial IPA/Stouts which are better than their ""enkel"" versions at times."
"Medium bodied, decent carbonation, and there is a sweet aftertaste. Too sweet for the style IMO. A good double / imperial pilsener, but not as good as the Boulevard / Orval collaboration."
"D: A decent beer for the style but the alcohol and sweetness make this beer a tad cumbersome"
"Lots of flavors to deal with here, complex, yet still quite drinkable. A sipping brew to say the least and a good example of the style as this one is a tamer in the hops department compared to other versions."
"poured a clear lemon yellow color with a brilliant white head and not alot of lacing,,smell is lemon and grain with some malts and hops..taste is the same its sweet lemon and citrus with malts and hops all mixed in..mouth feel is medium and alcohol is very well hidden..its easy to drink its just not that tasty to me"
"Clear straw color with a large white head that had great retention before settling to a thick cap. Just a little lacing is left on the glass. Very active carbonation. Something seems off with the aroma. Cooked vegetables and some soggy cardboard is what I smell. The flavor is not that great either. Tastes like a malt liquor, albeit a good malt liquor with its light malt and boozy qualities. I am not picking out the hop flavor but the bitterness is very much apparent. The body is what I would expect in a double pilsner. Feels fairly large and chewy. Abundantly carbonated but not harsh. This beer was a big letdown. I have liked all the Odell offerings prior to this beer."
"Probably my favorite double pilsner that I've had so far. It has some of the tastes that I've noticed (and disliked) in HG malt liquors-like grape-like flavors, but there's enough hops to balance it out to make it more than just a craft malt liquor. I would guess this has better ingredients than your typical HG malt, too."
"Overall very impressed. A pilsner with more body than usual, but not too heavy. This is the Double Pilsner I've tried and quite enjoyed it."
"D: this beer is just about perfect. easily the best Double Pilsner I've ever had."
"A very solid Impy Pils by Odell. Balanced in a malty sweet warmth and goodness and somehow still maintainable to drink down with a decent ease. Well, to a point anyways as that warmth really sinks in."
"I should know better than doubt Odell. The best version of this double/ imperial pilsner style I've ever had. Almost wish I'd gotten more than one bottle."
"surprisingly drinkable if you can get past the initial overwhelming sweetness. solid effort could be better."
"Look, I enjoy big beers just as much as the next guy. Belgian Quads, Double and Tripple IPAs, Russian Imperial Stouts, they're all delicious. High alcohol percentages, while they aren't necessarily required in those styles, don't take anything away from them either. However, with the lighter style of beers, especially the golden lager category, there's just nowhere for the alcohol to go. In most cases, especially in this one, this causes alcohol to overpower what otherwise might be a great beer - though there's no real way for you to know. Unfortunately in the case of O'Dell's Imperial Pilsner, this means the beer just isn't that enjoyable to drink. It's an interesting experiment in brewing, but not one I'll be reaching for again any time soon."
"Drinkability is okay, fun to try but not sure I'd seek it out again."
"Overall, this beer was decent, but nothing over the top. I was expecting a bit more hops from a double pilsner. It is fairly easy to drink however and could be enjoyed on a hot summer day."
"D - I like this beer, but I would want it more in the winter. To me this seems like it would have benefitted from more carbonation; there is very little carbonation in this particular beer. I'm guessing the grain and hops bill are very similar to a Belgian trippel. With more carbonation and a different yeast this would have been a very nice tripple."
"Drinks: like overstepping. Pilsners are traditionally light, refreshing drinks -- inherently something that probably shouldn't be imperialized. Double Pils is an interesting take on the style, but a bit overbearing in terms of mouthfeel and alcohol. I'm glad I had only a small sampler."
"Taste, wow, for what Stone's 14th did for English IPA's, is akin to what this beer does in terms of pilsners. I mean, there's flavor, and hops! It wasn't just all carbonation and a muted combo of hops and malt. They weren't super bitter like an ipa, they were just right, you'd never know this was an 8%'r. A little expensive so I've been told, but I really can't think of better pilsner options."
"Very nice beer. No indication that this is anything but 3 or 4 %, but 8%? Well you could have fooled me."
"Mouthfeel is medium with a crisp amount of carbonation."
"Pours a bright, crystal clear, gold with about a fingers worth of light, white head. Head dissipates quickly leaving little lacing. Nose is malty, alcohol and some floral hop notes. Taste is bready malt up front then lots of spiciness, floral hops, and alcohol in the finish. I've had some other offerings from Odell that had surprisingly high ABVs, this wasn't one of them. You can taste every bit of that 8.1%. Overall a good beer, a decent double pils, but tough to have more than one or two in a sitting."
"D: It looks like a beer you drink a bunch of, but not a good idea. Big malt was good, but dry and alcoholic finish slows me down."
"Notes: This beer seems like a ""craft malt liquor"" like Tool & Die from People's Pint or Daddy's Little Helper from Rogue. Not a good pils, double or otherwise."
"Poured a clear light golden yellow with a white two fingered head that disappeared quickly leaving thin lacing. Light sweet toasty malt fragrance. An excellant sweet hoppy malt balance on the palette. Medium body with a descent amount carbonation. Very drinkable brew even with a 8.1% ABV."
"D- Too thick and overly bittersweet for drinking more than one at a time. Not a terribly drinkable brew."
"Thanks to fretlessman71 over at realbeer for this one. Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my nonic Imperial pint glass. The pilsner appears a hazed golden yellow color with about two fingers of lingering bone white head. Nose and flavor consist of grassy, earthy hops, a bit of peppery spice, toasted grain, a good dose of sweet malt. This pils is approaching full bodied with ample carbonation. Well done, and thanks again fret."
"I got just a thin, white head with low retention from my pour. The color was a honey-lemon yellow with a slight haze. The nose was quite malty with just a light hop presence. The mouthfeel was medium-to-thick and the taste was quite sweet with a bit of an alcohol burn on the tongue. That last caused me to look more closely at the label - 8.1 % ABV! Wow! After STSPHL09 yesterday, I may never sober up at this rate. Finish had a good hop bite, but I think that I would prefer a single Pils, especially if I were making an afternoon of it."
"D: Going down the pipe at a fair pace"
"A: The color of honey, thin ring of carbonation along the edge of the glass, crystal clear - 3.50, S: Very earthy aromas, some slight spice on the nose as well - 3.50, T: I suppose I shouldn't be surprised given the 'double' billing - but this beer is loaded with hops, the alcohol is noticeable, a certain degree of spiciness on the tongue, candied sugar - 4.25, M: Medium bodied, some lingering on the palate - 3.50, D: I dig the hops on this beer, not sure how many of these I could handle in a sitting given the relatively high-level of alcohol - 3.75"
"This beer is very drinkable for its 8.10%ABV, I would guess the content to be a little lower. Very easy to drink, and rather well balanced. A tasty beer overall that was a pleasant surprise for me."
"D - Very easy to drink, despite the ABV."
"M/D - My bottle seemed a bit syrupy and a bit flat. Maybe its an old bottle. Although it wasn't bad, maybe fresh would be better, i'm just not a fan."
"Mouthfeel is decent at best. Lingers a bit on the palate, but not pleasantly."
"D - Big, sweet and malty, maybe becoming a touch cloying. I think I would like this one better if it was a little cleaner and crisper."
"drinkability: ok"
"Pours a cloudy pale yellow color, nice carbonation, tiny fizzy white head, with some minimal sticky lacing. The nose is hoppy, with some malts, grapefruit, with some spice. The taste is hoppy, malty, citrus, and some spicy. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a pretty tasty brew."
"Pours out a clear, dark mustard yellow with very little foam. Slight lacing left on the glass. Smells very sweet, perfumy, fruity and floral, but mostly a very pleasant candy-like aroma. Taste is on the sweet side. The floral, candy-like malt flavor dominates, with only a small hint of hop bitterness. This was my first double pils and was hoping for more of that spicy, grassy hop flavor. Still, this was not bad. Alcohol hits pretty quick but it was still very drinkable. I would definitely drink this again."
"D_The smell was what I was looking for. A good Czech pilsener on steroids, highly hopped and slightly cereal. Tastewise it veers too much into the sweet realm. While not bad I would prefer it to be a bit sweeter. Still this is a good one DP to try."
"D- I think one is enough due to the over powering alcohol. It's a nice beer but I with a little more balance it could be amazing."
"overcarbonated for me, but pilsners are typically that way, finishes slightly bitter and clean. and drinks well, this is definitely a beer to drink slowly."
"D-Not one I would want all the time but being that its limited release I woul pick up a 6 everytime it comes around"
"D - this is pretty good, but powerful both in flavor and in alcohol making it hard to have more than a couple. However, I am glad that I tried this for my 100th review..."
"Easy to drink and pretty enjoyable, but I can't help but think it could be so much better straight from the brewery."
"Overall I enjoyed the beer. I'd say it's a little too sweet but there was a range of character in the flavor. Could benefit from being drier, getting some more hop aroma, and clearing up that syrupy texture in the mouthfeel."
"Truly luscious body with a coy palate. Fantastic beer."
"This is an amazing beer, very well made, everything is well balanced and profiles the hops and alcohol in this beer very well."
"Thanks, brewjones, for the opportunity and GilGarp, for the chance to try it with a little age"
"Pours a nearly crystal clear yellow with a small quickly dissipating head. Smells earthy, lemony, and a little piney. Initial taste is sweet and citrusy, the malt character really steals the show here. Further down the glass the bitter, piney taste of the hops begins to shine through. Body is medium to light. Overall I typically am not that excited by pilsners, but I think that this would be something I would purchase occasionally if available in my area."
"D: Very drinkable given its ABV. Like a Pils on steroids. Good stuff."
"The body is moderate to full. Some sweetness in the finish but still a nice clean flavor. Feels full attenuated for sure. Very enjoyable beer that imo is under rated. Maybe a bit hoppy for style but a Double Pils is more of a US beer so bring it on!"
"I look forward to having the Morimoto Imperial Pilsner to compare with this one."
"all in all im disappointed as ive come to respect odells but am not fond of this at all"
"Flavor is fresh and green. A semi-sour grassy funk hits the palate first, followed by a malty sweetness. Hops wait until the end of the ride to rear their bitter citrus heads. As I'm coming to realize about all Odell's brews, the mouthfeel is uber-crisp and well carbonated. Body is a bit light for the ABV and style, but still good. Overall, a refreshing, flavorful brew that I'd probably go for again."
"D: Pretty drinkable, but one is definitely enough. The alcohol really gets in there and is kinda annoying in the taste, it is quite flavorful, but not really my thing."
"This is a well-made brew. A tradtional pils that has been pumped-up. Drinkable despite alcohol notes."
"This beer poured a clear golden color with a nice two finger head. It smelled of spicy hops with a golden maltiness. The taste is considerably sweeter and malty than I expected. While it certainly has the light to medium body I was looking for it wasn't nearly as crisp as I expected. Overall this beer is light and flavorful with the alcohol hidden well."
"If you want the best beer of this style in the known universe, pick up some Samuel Adams Hallertau Imperial Pilsner. That said, Odell Double Pilsner is a damn good effort. I hope this a seasonal release because I'd love to drink it again. Isn't it about time that these guys expand their distribution to Iowa?"
"It is drinkable, but the alcohol will creep up on you if you're not careful."
"A very interesting brew. I give it extra points for originality, because I've never had anything quite like it. I think I'll have another."
"I want to like this beer. Absent the diacetyl, this would be altogether good and tasty. As is, I would pass."
"At first glance, the Double Pilsner doesn't look like much. As soon as the nose hit me, however, I knew I was in for an experience. The nose and the taste both reminded me of the smell of honeysuckles on a summer night. Kind of specific, but that's what I got. Very floral and smooth, and it masked its high alcohol content well. I could see myself enjoying a few of these outside on a warm night."
"Thanks to Gbontrag for this one!"
"D - This was pretty good. It didn't look or smell to great but it had a really nice flavor."
"Delicious doubles pils from Odell. I like double and imperial variations on beer styles. This is a great German pils with some iron pumped to it meine freunde aufschlagen. Very nice straw color, good white head, nice lacing. Nice spicy aroma with some pale malt scents. Excellent flavor, with fantastic malt backbone fleshed out with spicy noble hop flavors. Great beer from a great little brewing company in Fort Collins, USA. These guys need more kudos."
"This beer poured a straw color, golden, almost looks like a Chardonay. Not a strong head or much lacing, but a nice grassy, citrusy smell - lemons prevalent in the aroma. The taste was even better. They achieved good balance between hops and malt - I was expecting a stronger hoppy taste, but was surprized by the candy-like sweetness of the beer from the malts. There was an interesting combination between the citrus smells and tastes and the sweet, candy flavors, sort of like lemon drops (sugery and tart) that was really nice. This is a very smooth beer, and the higher alcohol concentration isn't noticeble IMO. Smooth, soft mouthfeel, still with good carbonation, but not overpowering. Very good beer, pleasant experience. I was hesitent to buy it with it's $12 price tag for a six-pack, but with the quality of the brew, it was worth it."
"M&D - medium bodied, more so than i expected after seeing the pour and the crispness of the beer, biscuity would be a good term, however that medicinal quality throws the drinkability off slightly"
"The aroma was an earthy hop smell. The color was clear golden with a bubbly white head. Taste was sticky, slightly sweet, earthy, and good. I liked this, probably the best pilsener I have ever had. It certainly had an Imperial feel to it. I now need to go buy a sixer of this for the old fridge. The only thing that suffers here is drinkability but that is to be expected with a Double Pilsener."
"Kicking it up a notch for a BBQ weekend. Pilsners are just perfect for the summer. It poured a golden color with a two finger head. Nice crisp aroma. The double hits you on the palate. Much maltier than most pilsners and the alcohol is driven home. I would have preferred it to be more refreshing, but as a double pilsner this is perhaps what I should have expected. A well crafted brew regardless, but should be taken in moderation."
"Taste follows aroma. Nice malty start, then moves to more of a mild spice and herbal flavor. Hops nip the malt quick and subtle. Some citrus and herbal spice comes into shape, but is quited by a grainy-malt finish. Crisp, though. I like this. Goes well in the warm evening. Perhaps a bit pricey, but worth it."
"Drinks good for the abv, not as flavorful as last year, but still pretty damn good & a bit pricey at $ 10 sixer"
"This is one great pilsner or should I say double pilsner. Drink on, friends!"
"What a delightful surprise. This is the best Odell brew I've had. Get some of this! Highly recommended."
"Not too bad. another good one from Odell"
"A great addition to Odell's line up. A must try that goes beyond most Bohemian Pilsners but adds some American style hopping."
"Wish it had a touch more hop flavor to balance the sweetness, but overall a good beer... I would drink more..."
"Drinkable and flavorful, not a particular favorite but not a bad choice."
"D - A tasty brew that I can't decide if it has improved or worsened over time (since I last tasted one many months ago). Regardless, I recommended trying this out if you can. Its a very drinkable brew that hides its alcohol well and is interesting enough to keep you coming back."
"Overall impression: This is a highly drinkable beer - and it hides the alcohol suprisingly well. Dangerous! Nice balance of flavors, I would love to see this become a year round offering."
"I only had one of these and I'm not sure when I'll finish the rest of the sixer. For $11, I probably wouldn't buy any more. For a similar taste, I would probably go with something more ordinary like Pilsner Urquell or some Euro Lager. I had been looking around for this beer for a while. I was expecting a lot more from a double pilsner."
"Cheers!"
"Thick mouthfeel and moderate carbonation. Nice beer, but not one I need to spent $11 on for a 6-pack."
"Mouthfeel is reasonably full, medium bodied really. Light carbonation only lends a little crispness. Good drinkability but the sweetness is a bit much for me to have too many. Overall a solid beer for the style."
"On the palate... whoa, is this a Mai Bock? Big malt flavor, good Saaz spice, but then a malty flavored alcoholic hot whop finishes out the flavor. Finish is alcohol dominant with some lingering sweetness. I don't mind the latter charactersistics due to a preference for Maibocks, but those not preferring such a beer may want to pass on this offering from Odell."
"Another treat from Liquor Mart on my last stop. Lovely pour into the Duvel tulip glass. Clear, clean golden yellow body with a pillowy, dense creamy white head. Pungeant honey malt mixes with cantaloupe and fruity alcohol. Saazish hop aroma of sea air. Taste doesn't disappoint. Herbal, bitter hop edge up front that lasts throughout and intensifies in the finish. Sweet, smooth fruit and honey malt come through mid-palate providing balance. The hop flavor is perfect for the honey candy malt intensity. A winner. Medium-full bodied with a near-syrupy feel. It clings to the inside of the mouth. Reminds me of Rogue's. A big compliment!"
"The only changes I could say for sure is that I now find it more drinkable than in my first review and it seems to have a better nose. I don't know what happened but dang, the alcohol is *very* well hidden this time around and my new scoring will reflect that. Darn good stuff!!"
"Odell has done a great job with this one. With this brew in their line-up, they continue to build their case as one of the most underrated breweries in North America."
"What a shame this is a limited edition. This beer is crisp, easy to drink, quite good. It's also oddly refreshing, in spite of the high alcohol content. I'd highly recommend seeking this one out. Well worth the trouble."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable beer but would limit intake because of the alcohol content. It's definitely not a lawnmower beer but it's an excellent example of what I envision a double Pilsner style would be."
"Wonderful beer!"
