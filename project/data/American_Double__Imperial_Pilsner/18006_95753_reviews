"O: A fantastic collaboration between Half Acre and Mikkeller, and probably one of the better non-staple beers Half Acre has churned out. Very solid for the warmer months, as this is quite refreshing."

"I wouldn't change a thing with this experiment. I hope they can revisit this on occasion as it is definitely one to seek out. A truly unique creation and one of my favorite collaboration beers to date. Half Acre getting better and better."

"Resiny bitter hops, orange peel, citric and oily hop vibes. A vague fruity sweetness flashes quickly before segueing into a long resiny bitterness in the middle and lingering into the aftertaste. Some trace lager yeast character. Light bodied and super hoppy. Overall very drinkable considering the abv. Paired well with Rutger Hauer in Blind Fury."

"D - Great beer, and totally on point for summertime. I could crush a 16oz can of this no problem. May have to go back and attempt to skirt the one 4-pack limit on this one. Wish I'd gotten a pint rather than the taster."
