"Just behind Mass Rising on the best IPL list"
""
"Overall:  This beer never fails.  Bottle or draft and you can't go wrong.  Looking forward to more of this in the future.  This beer is so delicious.  So good, I ordered another."
"This is a really excellent effort out of Framingham: a great alchemical operation that brings the best of two burgeoning genres (New Zealand-hopped XPAs and Imperial Pilsners) and holds those qualities in elegantly coordinated concert."

"Nice smooth beer! Great tasting! Very hoppy!"
"I admit, I will be an outlier. But this beer is not JA's best."

"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, this is a solid beer to drink for a long time."
""
""
""

"Great balance of being highly drinkable and citrusy against an 8.5% abv. backdrop. Refreshing and hoppy and tasty."
"Strongly hopped but pretty well balanced"
""
"Overall, this was a nicely refreshing surprise.  We hadn’t previouisly known Jack’s Abby had come into the greater Rochester market, so we were floored to see a heavy hitter such as Kiwi Rising on tap at an admittedly smaller establishment well outside the city’s downtown!!  It stood out almost immediately on the menu, and we had to order it.  We felt the interplay between the pilsner, lagery side of the brew and the cloyingly fruity hoppiness made for an interesting and well-received tasting.  The ultimate balance wasn’t perfect, as both aroma and taste tended towards the sweeter side, but the feel helped to keep it even keeled.  To hop a lager, and something so traditionally bitter and muted as pilsners can be, was really the most exciting thing about it.  These hops were just wildly juicy and forward.  What a great chance introduction this was for us; we look forward to many more meetings in the hopefully near future."

"Love this beer. Had a bottle dated at the end of October 2014 in February, but it doesn't seem to have mattered much. I wonder how much more incredible this beer tastes fresh. Just awesome. A citrus punch up front that lingers. Can't tell it's 8.5 ABV, goes down easy."

""
""
""
"Overall- I've seen a ton of this sitting around and I'm pretty confused as to why as it still tastes fresh as hell and its just a really good beer. Really nice soft tropical hop flavors and great drinkabilility that jacks abby ipl's have.  At  4 or 5 bucks for a pint bottle its a solid value too."
""
""
"All around pretty decent.  Smell is good but not worthy of a higher rating."
""
""
""
"Overall, I am impressed.  Very unique look, smell, and taste.  Refreshingly uncommon beer."
"Awesome feel; refreshing bite; nice citrus notes. Favorite beer by Jack's Abby."
"This beer is a double india pale lager, not a pilsner."

"this is a great beer... hops on hops with a clean lager finish..."
""
"O - Exceptional lager here. No surprise coming from Jack's Abbey, one of the most consistent breweries in MA. I'd recommend it to anyone."
""
"Very off tasting brew, a strange funk that was not expected.  Bottle has been stored properly and appeared fine.  Mouthfeel was quite thin and color was quite unappealing.  Bitterness was mild for such a high ibu, just an overpowering off taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A solid beer.  Extremely smooth and drinkable.  Very crisp and clean on the taste, with a  bit of hoppy grapefruit goodness on the back end."
"Good lagers are my simple pleasure and this is a great hoppy lager with Southern Hemi hops, which are some of my favorite.  I am drinking the bottle 1.5 months after bottling but I believe hoppy lagers fall off slower than certain IPA/DIPA culprits.  Would I rather have a fresh IPA w Nelson, Galaxy, or other Southern Hemi hop?  Yes.  Is this a good, enjoyable hoppy lager?  Most definitely."
""
""
""

"Poured into glasses and shared.  Pours a slightly hazy light yellow with pure white head.  Tons of dank and floral hop aroma.  Awesome fruit, resin and flowers followed by slight malt sweetness all in a very dry and refreshing brew.  I'd guess nearly all of the 105 stated IBUs are late additions and dry hop as there is little to no bitterness evident.  Nice dry but not thin mouth feel.  Overall, a really wonderful lager."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Sharp asprin bitterness mixed with a disappointing vegetal/DMS note. The new-world hops try pop up, but somehow the effect with the lager yeast produces some inharmonious accords. Really quite surprised at the love for this one. JA makes same fine brews, but I think they're really in their wheelhouse at lower ABVs - Mass Rising, while somewhat more enjoyable than Kiwi, suffers from similar problems."

"Overall: This is a great beer, you cannot taste the alcohol which can get you into trouble with too many of them. The hops balance it out and its got an intensity to it. Almost like an IPA and lager but too balanced to detect a difference. I have two of these and I am happy I got this on a trade from a good friend in RI. If you can get your hands on this beer buy it or trade for it!"

"T: Surprisingly sweet to start, very resiny. Passionfruit and mandarin presented on kaffir lime leaf platform. Very floral and fruity. Bready malts; heavier than expected. Overall, it's like a cross between a bock and EIPA. Could have used some more alpha notes; hop bitterness is nearly non-existent, and would have provided the needed balance; pine and light wood tingle.  Another slant would be that the bitterness has mellowed and taken on some cask like quality. It's unique, delicious, a must-have for anyone into hops from Down Under."
""
"I have been waiting for this beer for quite some time and we were finally able to get some in the store. I was impressed with the earthiness and minerality in this double IPL 's hop profile. It has a wonderful citrus bouquet but not a specifically lemon, grapefruit or lime taste for me, more of just a general cirtus flavor. I would guess this may come from Kohatu variety but who can be sure.  Not sure if it lived up to the hype of ""best beer jacks abby has made"" but it is definitely up there. Worth the purchase at under 5 for a bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a great beer. Unlike many IPA's that all tend to run together, this one stands apart. It's bold, fruity and smooth, with a nice little alcohol bite. Jack's Abby has done it again."
"Medium body and medium carbonation, has a noticeable warmth of alcohol."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a wonderful mosaic-showcase of hops. According to the brewery's bartender, it has about 5-6 hops, and manages to capture an array of fantastic flavours that any hop-lover should enjoy and seek out!"

"I waited until my 3rd bottle to review Kiwi Rising,dated 11/4/14 and consumed 11/23/14. This is a quality beer that is an interesting and flavorful offering featuring citrusy/grassy flavors of New Zealand hops in an interesting lager base.Highly recommended."
""
"O - Great beer! I'm an IPA drinker for the most part but this is one exceptional lager.  One of my new favorites.  I would certainly get it again and it is the best lager I've ever had for sure. It's better than Hoponius Union."

"105 IBU's.....I am still looking for them and so are my taste buds. This beer rocks. Smooth as silk going down. So light in color, you would not think you are drinking a double anything."
"O - A seasonal favorite, especially when enjoyed fresh. The piquant flavor from the hops is not for everyone, but the balance on this beer is superb.  Worth getting at least one of each November, especially when your fridge runs dry of Heady Topper."

"16.9oz bottle with ""No Fruity MFG 11/5/14"" on the side of the neck. Pours a semi translucent pale yellow with a small layer of head. Lots of lacing. Big citrus hop aroma. Lime, lemon, grapefruit, and orange. Light malt. The taste is grapefruit, lemon and limes. Big bitter hop flavor. Floral hop notes as well. Some pilsner malt flavor towards the end. Finishes with more citrus hops and a slight dankness. Lime aftertaste. Lots of carbonation with a slightly heavy mouthfeel. Nice warming alcohol flavor. Overall, fantastic Imperial IPL I'm glad I bought a few of."

"O: Kiwi Rising is an impressive beer, one of the best I've had this year -- it combines drinkability with a big ABV somehow. If you're expecting lager-like feel, that is probably not realistic with the big load of hop oils, but this beer is delicious, aromatic, flavorful, and a must-try."
""
"Tastes great.  Hops start out with more typical grapefruit and citrus nodes but there's a distinct white-white flavor that becomes more present as the beer warms. Very nice, and combines excellently with the crisp grain profile."

"Pour is lightly hazed pale golden orange with a ton of tight white head.  Nose is strong, presents a nice balance of assertive grains, lightly toasty with notes of bread and a touch of dough. Very strong hops behind, grassy and strong citrus and tart grapefruit.  Taste is even more juicy hops, still has a solid grain bill, bread crust mixed with dough.  Hops are juicy and bright, tropical fruits and some tart grapefruit, assertive bitterness through the finish.  Clean airy body with strong carbonation, great stuff."

"Overall, jacks abby doesnt disappoint. Great brewery making lagers formthe craft beer drinker. Mfloral, hoppy, wonderful."
""

"you would never know this is a lager, save for the bready crispness of the finish, but even than is covered up by an aggressive hopping that finishes longer than the yeast tries to let it. pale in color with a little haze, an inch of white head. it smells well hoppy, but this is meant (as far as i know) to be a showcase of new zealand varietals. i get a lot of nice juicy hops, but i dont get the nelson or the other tropical ones, but its still nice and bright without bitterness. the taste is good, clean, refreshing, hoppy, impressively flavorful for a lager as most people know them, but its lacking distinction a little bit for me. its not quite as unique or different (on the hop side) as i was hoping and it expecting it to be. its tasty and fresh enough, but i dont get the new zealand spark of fruity flavors, this could easily be done with american C varietals for how it tastes great feel though, well carbonated and light on the palate, refreshing and quicker finishing because of the lager yeast. good beer, not standout, but thanks to drlovemd87 for opening this one with me, it had been high on my list for awhile now."

"Its a little old for ipa standards. Nice pour into my pfriem tulip. Golden color with thick sticky lacing. Huge fruity hop aroma..with a hint of pine. Really nice. Great fruity hop flavor...its got a definite kiwi flavor with a sweet yet piney finish. Im not a huge fan of the piney hop flavor so maybe its good its a few months old. Great smooth and crisp mouthfeel. This is excellent."

"Slightly hazy, pale yellow pour, with a thin cap of bubbly white head that retained as a ringlet; light lacing. Grassy aroma, pine needles, distant biscuity malts, pretty stale overall. Major vegetal hop bitterness in the taste, the bitterness nearly blasting out all flavor and complexity in the brew; grass and pine-scented cleaner, ammonia, herbal tea. Body was light and watery, like lagery, but not fleshed out enough with malts to compensate for the overblown hop profile, and the higher almost soda-like carbonation wasn't helping either. ""Messy"" I guess is a good way to describe the beer. Between the people fawning over this when it was shared, and the high ratings it seems to get...I'm simply confused."
"O- wow, move over whales! this is a epic beer. tons of citrus, perfectly blended hops, just outstanding. still having trouble believing this is a lager"

"This is one of the beers in this style that actually drinks well. It's not a lager in that you cannot have tow, three or even four. It drinks a bit sweet and with an alcohol presence BUT the fruit and the choice of hops on this have made it work. The pale malt is at it's best to smooth everything out an leave the palate dry and even a bit refreshed with plenty of carbonation to excite the tongue."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is definitely a strong beer and i can see why so many love it. It's just very good for me but that is more because of my own taste preferences than any flaw, whatsoever, in this brew. Jack's Abby continues to impress me."
""
""
"O: Tasty and pretty drinkable IPL, with nice hoppy flavor. Not substantively different from a DIPA."
""
""
""
""
"Solid stuff, love the hops in this , very juicy. I actually prefer a little lighter body, got a little heavy in the stomach in the end."
""
""
""
"Big, fluffy whitish cap from a gentle pour. Tons of clumpy lacing, good head retention. The beer was hazy, yellow gold. Fruity aroma, orange and lemon, grassy and a bit tropical. Nice flavour. Hops are in full force, tropical (mango and pineapple) up front, a bit of citrus mid-palate, then bitterness and a hint of spicy alcohol in the finish. Malt was really just there to provide some balance. Medium plus body with creamy carbonation. Really enjoyable and quite drinkable."
""
""
""
"Hazy pale golden pour with a tall and lasting layer of foam. Nose is great, loaded with fruity and grassy NZ hops, clean and crackery pils malt, and a touch of sulfury lager yeast. Clean and crisp on the palate, loaded with NZ hop goodness but remarkably light-bodied and dry for an 8.5%er. Mildly bitter finish that doesn't linger too long. Outstanding stuff."
""
"A really interesting brew. Great that it stands out as an DIPL instead of trying to replicate some other DIPAs."
""
""
"M - Medium body; creamy. Sticky and oily. Light carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-The hops start out great but then nothing. The finish is bland."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"If I tasted this without knowing what it was I would have said it was a double IPA (and that is a very good thing!) It is like biting into fresh citrus fruit."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a beer to experience for yourself. Kiwi Rising is an intensely hoppy lager that just might replace your favorite DIPA. This beer, being a lager, gives the powerful NZ hops a clean vessel to ride on, making you wonder while all hoppy beers have to be ales. A must try for the hophead."
""
"Had this on tap. Served in a tulip 8oz. First time having it after I read a lot of great things about it. If I could sum up this beer in one word it would be ""Beautiful"". The look, the feel, the taste-bursting with a citrusy/fruity start and ending with a fair bitterness. Its a very refreshing beer. I wanted to order another one But was at a bar with 105 beers on tap so I wanted to keep tasting. I will get this again."
""
"This is pretty absurd. I'm not sure why or how I can still be surprised by Jack's Abby, but this was unexpectedly good. It's kind of like Mass Rising, except the hop profile is all about the Nelson Sauvin hops. I must say that it not only reminds me of Mass Rising, but also of Alpine Nelson. And unlike Nelson, I don't have to trade away vital organs to get a bottle of this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - An interesting and unique beer. Well worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
"The oily tinge is reminiscent of DirtWolf, but not as offensive as when I first tried DirtWolf, and as an Imperial Lager, Kiwi Rising does taste a bit lighter in color and taste than DirtWolf. When price point is considered, DW beats KR. Even if DW is around $11/4 when you can find it now, that's 23 cents an ounce, as opposed to 28 cents for KR. Oh not so much difference after all. But dayum they taste so darned similar!"

"O: Decent beer was hoping it was better fresh and it is just slightly, if I were able to regularly get this I would be inclined to drink this every so often."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is an imperial lager that could go toe to toe with any imperial IPA. Really shines in the intense hop profile yet keeps its lager roots. A must try for any hophead."
""
""
""
""
"The palate opens with a big, juicy, fruity hop character, light, tropical, airy and surprisingly enough, like a kiwi in some respects. Really though, this is a blend of citron, mangosteen and a little pineapple. Interestingly enough, the spiciness that I picked up on the nose isn't particularly noticeable, though this is definitely on the spicier side of IPLs I've had. The mid palate brings out some bitterness, with a blend of hand of Buddha-like brilliant, clarifying brightness and a very focused citrus resin bite. Very clean, this beer finishes with flavors of honey, simple syrup and a mild bitterness. Alcohol is very well hidden, there is no way I'd peg this at 8%. Malt character is nonexistent. This is one of the more memorable beers I've had this year. Outrageously good."
""
""
""
"I have been wanting to try their beer for some time. If you like the bite of hoppy bitterness, this is a fine example. Has a bite from beginning to end. Very good DIPL."
"Pours a hazy amber with a thick, fluffy head. Minimal lacing. Lots of fruit on the nose, citrus, tropical fruit, with a hint of breadiness and fresh cut grass. Some cattiness can be detected. Not such a bitter bomb on the palate, sweet grapefruit and other fruity flavors come on the front giving way to some bready malt and tropical fruit. Nice dry finish. Medium light body with decent carbonation. Overall, an outstanding double IPL. Supremely well crafted. Well worth seeking out."

"O: I have had many IPLs in the past and this is among the worst I've had. Hoponus Union is a much better beer from Jack's Abby. There was no balance between the malt and hops, it was overcarbonated, and tasted stale. As a side note the bottle was picked up from the brewery about 11 days before it was consumed, I don't know when it was bottled but I have got to assume that the brewery would only release fresh IPLs. A definite miss from Jack's Abby. Very disappointing. I have no idea how this beer got onto the top 250 list."

"Overall: Another great lager from Jack's Abby; these guys continue to impress"

"500ml bottle served in a pilsner glass. MFG. 11.11.2013 printed on the label. Pours a beautiful translucent honey-gold with a dense, four-fingered bright white head. Copious tiny bubbles are present effervescing in-solution from the base of the glass to the underside of the head. Head eventually settles into a two-finger cap with delicate, textured bands to lacing revealed in the wake. Nose expresses grains, a hint of skunk and aromas akin to white wine. Taste consistent with nose; however, the kiwi definitely expresses itself in the flavor profile (more towards the tart side of the spectrum). There's a also a slight piney/floral hops presence and a kiss of ethanol bittering towards the back. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a pleasant, even carbonation and a slightly oily texture. Overall, a great beer, but not as good as I remember. Nonetheless, well worth your time if the opportunity presents."

"O: JA knocks another one out of the park. Extremely drinkable for 8.5% even with the high amount of bitterness throughout. Definitely worth picking up"
""
""
"Deep golden color that is nearly transparent with a huge billowing foamy white head. Some tropical fruit notes but mostly citrus rind on the nose. There is a bit of bright citrus and fruit on the first taste, but the bitterness overwhelms after that. The body is very clean and smooth to drink. Overall, I was taken aback by the level of bitterness on this beer. It's very clean and well-made, but the intense bitterness reminds me of some of the west coast IPAs that aren't my personal favorites."
""
""
""
""
""
"Had on tap at Area Four. This was raved about by the waiter and so highly rated I was anticipating a lot. I like this brewery. Poured a hazy golden color with a nice head. Hoppy taste hits you right away and this had a nice smooth balance. However....I found an odd after taste. I may be kicked off Beer Advocate, but I didn't like this. Found it difficult to finish, but being a trooper I did. Maybe I need to revisit again"

"o - Overall I thought this was a great imperial pilsner. It looks great and has a great mouthfeel, and is very drinkable. The nose was good, though a little different than I was expecting due to some nuts in the smell, but the taste was fantastic and spot on. Tons of pine and citrus hops, would love to have this one again. Another winner from JA."
""
""
""

"Heard both good and not so good things about this brew so I was skeptical. Especially after loving BA Framinghammer....gotta say this is an absolutely exceptional beer. The aroma fills the room after pouring...a nice 1 inch white head....I'd never thought I'd use the description of 'grass' but that's a great descriptor....as well as a beautifully well balanced IPL...Great hop flavor with a delicious malt back bone....Thrilled that Jacks Abbey is here in NY! Well done!!"

"O: This is more on the 'refreshing' side of the Double IPA/L spectrum. Easy to drink, while still maintaining a hop-forward presence and bitterness. Doesn't dry the mouth out. Overall, quite good."

"O - A Beer Experience...."
"Bright straw/golden color with a thick lacing white head of foam. Hops hit big up front with a nice white wine and orange blossom note. Taste has that lager crispness with a touch of bread and cereal grain. Hops are present in the flavor, but with a subtle bitterness. Carbonation level is high and the mouth feel is very clean and just the right weight on the tongue. Finished with a touch of grain and some lingering slightly vegetal hops."

"Extremely clean. On the lighter side of medium bodied. Bright orange like acidity with other tropical fruits up front. Brisk carbonation. Lots of citrus like acidity flavor wise. Bitterness is very low but theres just enough to feel it. Almost like orange juice with a beer taste. One of the smoothest beers over 8% i've ever had. I love this."

"To think, I nearly avoided this brew because of the L word (lager) on the label. Glad I didn't let preconceptions guide me."

"O: Interesting, definitely good. I couldn’t drink a ton but very enjoyable especially with food."
""
""
""
""
""
"Probably one of the best ""Double India Pale Lagers"" I've had, not that there's too many of them out there compared to other styles."
"O-got this unknown bottle as an extra. Let me say wow I am impressed. I really enjoy the combination of these styles. Wish I had more."
""
""
"Cheers!"
"Overall: I have never had an Imperial Pilsner before. The hops dont really give this beer a chance to be a regular pilsner, but I dont care because this is a tasty beer. This is my second favorite Jack Abby's beer and they make some wonderful hoppy beers! i am impressed again by Abby Jack's. But Hoponius Union is still my favorite. You can think of Kiwi Rising as bigger version of Hoponius Union. My favorite aspect of this beer is how unique the hop profile is... its true unique."
""
""
""

"Overall, this is most certainly a powerful double IPA, and you won’t find many more hop flavors crammed into a single bottle of beer. This does, of course, mean that many casual drinkers will find the beer utterly unpalatable. But hopheads should rejoice in what is an excellently crafted hop profile. Unfortunately, the sugars and breads aren’t quite capable of keeping up with the massive lupulin blast, making the beer seem off-balanced. Worth trying, but be aware of what you’re getting into."
"There are better hoppy lagers from Jack's Abby in my opinion - the super earthy/veggie/sweet malt is not my top preference for flavors - but this is still quite good, impressive complexity."
""
"Big thanks goes out to MSquared2 for sharing this one during one of our random Sunday tastings! Served from bottle into Sweetwater 15th Anniversary snifter. Poured a hazy golden yellow with a half finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, fruit, citrus, citrus hop, tropical fruit, and pineapple. The flavor was of sweet malt, fruit, tropical fruit, tropical fruit hop, citrus, and pine hop. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. Another brew from this brewery and another hit. Everything on this one really worked in complete harmony and unison to make it very easy to drink and refreshing. The tropical fruit profile going on was nothing short of awesome on this one. So glad that I finally found out about this brewery . I hope you get the chance to do the same."
"Overall, wow... this is a very impressive beer. Unique, flavorful, and super drinkable. A very tasty hoppy lager that I'd be very happy to drink again."
""
""
""
""
"I will drink this again."
""
"O:I liked this beer a lot and I usually hate lagers but this has many ipa qualities which is a huge benefit for me. It is pretty tastey looks, smells great and had a real good mouthfeel not just standard local fair a really good beer and it reps mass well."
"A very bright, very hoppy beer. Jack's Abbey continues to impress the hell outta me."
""
"This is an exceptional beer. It is definitely one of, if not the best Imperial pils I have had. The huge but not overwhelming hop aroma and flavor, combined with the crisp and lighter mouthfeel make this beer dangerously drinkable. Definitely had my share before it ran out this year."
""
"Overall: This beer is better than nearly every DIPA I've ever had. Just a stellar beer in every regard. Jack's Abbey hit a grand slam here. I don't want this again, I NEED this again."
""
"A good take all around. Drinks like a burly APA, but that lager yeast keeps your tongue rooted to the base style. A solid hop profile, but the malts seem a little weak in comparison. Definitely worth checking out, but I have a hard time believing this is a Pliny/Heady killer."
""
""
"O: Definitely good, but I'm not sure I don't like Hoponious Union a bit better. Jack's Abby has it going when it comes to lagers and hops."
""
"O: The aroma on this beer is incredible, so much fruitiness. The taste is certainly very good, but is a bit of a disappointment after the aroma. A very good beer in an odd style."

"O: This is one intense beer. The nose is softly aromatic and pleasant, but it takes a little while to open up and doesn't pop as it perhaps should. This leaves the drinker completely unprepared for the no holds barred hop onslaught that awaits. This is very bitter and very spicy. Not for the faint of heart."
""
""
""
""
"O: World-class DIPL. Doubt I'll ever have one as tasty as this! In love with this beer and with Jack's Abby."
""
"M: Medium bodied."
"O: Top class Double IPA/L. The lager and NZ hop qualities put this beer over the top. Such a pleasure to drink. Thank you Jack's Abby!"
""
""
""
""
"Well done. Well, well done."
"O: This is just another great hoppy beer from Jack's Abby. Glad to have gotten my hands on a few bottles, and hoping to make it to the brewery in the near future in hopes they still have it there. If not, I'll settle for Hoponius Union with no tears shed."
"O: Really superlative lager. One of the best Jack's Abby brews, and they are all world class... This beer may not be for everyone at 105 IBUs, although I think you will come to enjoy it!!!"
"A curious beer indeed. Are they trying to showcase New Zealand hops or lager fermentation? I think the answer is both. This beer is drinkable and very interesting. The problem is that there is absolutely nothing traditionally ""lager"" about this beer, and it's not a deeply satisfying hop-bomb either. (3.5)"
""
"I have enjoyed 5 bottles over the last 2 weeks of this stuff."
""
" having again soon."
""
""
""
""
"The finish is all preventing this beer from being about as perfect as possible. I love what Jack's Abby is doing with lagers and this is their best one yet. It's like a DIPA bred with a German pils. Amazing."
""
"O - Flavors are good on this beer at the start and thru the middle, but a bit lacking on the finish. The finish really doesn't feel like it is inviting me to take another sip...comes across very bitter, dry, a bit medicinal and super piney. A softer finish with some sweetness and citrusy fruit would go along way for me here. I haven't really found a strong liking in any of the beers using New Zealand hops...so maybe this one really had the chips stacked against a bit from the beginning...good beer, but still lacking that something to make it special."
"Flavor wise, this is far closer to a Double IPA than a double pilsner. This is because of the strong citrus hop presence. Very bitter, even up front. Long aftertaste of black pepper. Relatively thin body with a high level of carbonation."

"O: Another great beer from Jack's Abby. Glad to have finally tried this one, and fruitier version of Hoponius."
"On the mouth, this beer feels crisp and smooth, with a nice bitter bite on the tongue and the sides of the mouth. The mouth is left wet on the sides while the roof of the mouth and the tongue have the slight scorch of a bitter burn. Overall this beer is an excellent success, and is reminiscent of a more succulent and fruity version of Hoponius Union. Great big bitter hops from the high IBU’s, scrape the mouth but leave it begging for more, and a higher alcohol percentage that is not present in the taste at all. I was a little worried about this beer after trying it at the end of a tasting last week and having it taste bland and uninteresting, but I now can safely say that was because of all the beer before it that I had tried. This beer is a winner. Very easy to put back with terrific clean and crisp lager qualities while carrying the big juicy fruit bitters of a west coast imperial IPA. This beer is a must try, especially for its super cheap pricing."
""
"O Really nice DIPA.. err DIPL.. Whatever you want to call this stuff it's fantastic stuff, but thats nothing new for Jack's Abby"
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a delicious beer with a great aroma. It reminds me a lot of Hill Farmstead Edward, but with a thinner body. I hope this becomes a more than seasonal brew."
""
"O: Awesome brew. I don't think Jack's Abby can make a bad beer. A big, mean, dry hopped, lager monster. Yes, they do exist."
""
""
""
"4- Overall this is an awesome beer. Very glad my girlfriend picked this one out at the store. Brewing this as a lager opposed to an ale was a great idea. Pretty unique and it worked out well! Definitely one of the best beers I've had to date thats come out of my home state of MA."
"I've only had a few ""Imperial Lagers"" most are called Imperial Pinslers, but hey, a pilsner is a lager. This is one of the better ones. It's delicate, well balanced, yet at the same time strong. I like it a lot, and wish it was more available, but I can imagine it's not an easy one to brew."
""
""
""
""
"O/D-The ""Double India Pale Lager"" is better than 90-95% of the DIPAs I have had. I love the Nelson Sauvin hop (still pretty certain this is the correct varietal) and I love how they utilized its flavors in this beer. Jack's Abby is the best brewery in MA and is up there with the best in the country in my opinion. Don't let their specific niche-brewing deter you; these lagers are unequivocally world class!"
"O: I love this beer, my fav this far from jacks Abby, and deffinatly up there with my favorite dipas... Nice... Dry.... And loads of tropical fruit/piney hops, if you love hops this beer is a must try."
"World class beer. No joke. Do this year round! PLEASE."
""
""
"Overall- Great drinkability. Everyone with me drank several. Had it last year on draft and was excited for it's return (and soon in bottles). Thankfully, it lived up to my expectations. This is my favorite Jack's Abby beer by a good margin. Highly doubt there is a better lager out there."
""
""
""
""
""

""

"Glad to see a very local brewery making a hoppy but unique beer. Doesn't just emulate your usual IIPA, the hops here are smooth and fruity flavorful."
"D - It's the Alpine Nelson of lagers. I think I liked Hoponius Union a *tiny* bit more, but this is excellent as well. I hope they make this year round, as it's a beer I'd drink often. It's really nice to see brewers pushing the lager boundaries too."
""
"O: Easy to drink, thick, with a good hoppy flavor. Worth checking out if you’re into a hoppy chance of pace."
"Holy crap, Jack's Abbey is the real deal. This beer easily holds its own with the resin hop monsters out there. Its only a matter of time till this local brewery is nationally known."
""
""
"Overall this beer is really flavorful but it could use a touch more sweetness for balance. There is some subtle heat in the finish but I was shocked to see that the ABV is so high. Fuller bodied than expected for the style but still pretty quaffable. I would love to try this again in the summer."
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a really good hoppy beer. I was very surprised when I found out the style. I would definitely have another."
"A curious looking bottle found its way home with me yesterday. Pours a cloudy deep straw color bordering on golden with a decent white head that displays minimal retention and lace. Smell comes through with lots of citrus with grapefruit and lemon dominating. Moderate pilsner malt deep underneath. Taste is quite hoppy, lots of citrus with barely any malt to back it up. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a resinous mouthfeel. Great hoppy brew and a great price too, I may have to revisit this again."
"This is my third time trying a beer by Jack's Abby Brewing and all have been outstanding. It is truly amazing how they got this lager to resemble a flavorful and dry, yet remarkably well balanced, West Coast-style double IPA. Expect to see other breweries doing something similar in the near future."
"O: This is definitely one of the most interesting beers I've had lately. I almost passed on it due to the ""lager"" label but I'm glad I didn't. It's 85% like a big DIPA. If I didn't know it was a lager I would have assumed it was a DIPA in fact. Doesn't beat you up too badly despite the high hoppiness, making is surprisingly drinkable. I think I could have more than one of these, which is more than I could say for a Ruination, Maharaja or a Hopsickle."
""
""
"O - the second beer i've had from these guys and damn does it raise a bar i felt was already pretty high."
""
""
""
"In the end I really enjoyed this. It's clean, direct, flavorful. However, I think I prefer Mass Rising, which has a more juicy tropical flavor to it."
""

"Overall delicious, hard to get and lager flavors but got a little as I really tried, great tropical fruit hops, citrus, a bit resinous, nice soft malt balance. Very drinkable esp for 8.5%."
"Carbonation is an easy fix so I will still Give Kiwi Rising a Big Thumb's up"
"O - Overall I like this beer so much I can't stand up from the bar in fear of being arrested for indecent exposure. What the hell guys. Why...why make a beer this good, this surprising. If lagering an IPA turns it into this symphony then all breweries should play these notes. I would drink this over any nondark beet any day of the week. This is truey something magical get this while it lasts everyone because as Cinderella said: ""You don't know what you've got till its gone."""
