"New style for me. Quite suprised by flavor. Will have this one again."
"Mediocre. Too hoppy for a refreshing lager, not hoppy enough for a satisfying IPA."
""
"It's a very good India Pale Lager."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve ounce short brown glass bottle with a twist-off crown, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice."

"Overall â€“ This is one tasty brew at a fantastic price.  I really liked the unique blend of hop that blended very nicely with the lager body.  Very nice."

"Overall - Not bad at all. It certainly surpassed my expectations. Only downside is the body which is more IPA-like than lager-like. Not a huge issue, but if I were looking for something more light and refreshing in the summer I'd likely grab something else."

"An enjoyable rendition of this burgeoning proto-style, the hoppiness not overbearing, but working well with the choice of peppy malts.  Good on Pyramid for branching out a bit, and venturing down different roads - I'd like to see more of this sort of thing (IPLs, that is) - done well, of course!"

"A citrusy sharp finish. Distinctly lemony with a long bitter aftertaste. From the 22 oz bottle purchased at The Market in Anacortes."

"22 oz bottle from a local ""mom and pop"" convenience store. $2.79 Pours a clear lightish amber colour ( like darker honey) with a nice sized frothy and thick off white head. Ok spicy/floral hop aromas..bread like malts. Good spicy hoppy taste..sweet bready malts balance in the back. nice. Mouth feel is fine medium carbonation and medium thick..drinks real well. Overall really nice little amber lager here..not bad at all ( i find myself saying that often with Pyramid nowadays)."
"Incidentally, I had a hard time nailing down the style for the ""Add Beer"" function. I don't think ""double"" or ""imperial"" is an apt name for a 6.0 ABV brew, but the discussion forums led me there. I also could not load a picture, no matter how many times I tried."
