4.1,9.6,4,4,4,4,4.5,"750 ml bottle into lager glass, best before 2/2014. Pours lightly hazy golden straw color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big lemon zest, pear, apple, pepper, cracker, bread, light honey, floral, grass, herbal, and floral/yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with bright and balanced notes of hop, malt, and yeast esters; with great strength. Taste of lemon zest, pear, apple, pepper, cracker, bread, light honey, floral, grass, herbal, and floral/yeast earthiness. Light earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, light fruits, pepper, cracker, bread, light honey, floral, grass, and herbal on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance of bright hop, malt, and yeast ester flavors; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very crisp, smooth and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent imperial Pilsner style. All around great balance of crisp and bright hop, malt, and yeast flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Oct 18, 2013"

The nose comprises mild biscuit, flowers, light grass, and wild rice. The taste brings in more of the same, along with a strong vein of straight plastic, as though I licked the cheap bag my groceries came in. This not only tastes bad on its own, but it also mixes strangely with the breadiness of the malt, leading to a rather off-putting flavor on my tongue. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, I've been searching for a really nice impy pils and thought Boulevard would be the brewery to deliver it. Alas, this was not the case. Instead, theirs stands as a fairly middling version at best (I've had some absolutely horrid ones in my day).","TMoney2591","Aug 08, 2013"

The problem I have with most versions of the style is that the way breweries imperialize pilsners is by adding massive amounts of hops or alcohol. When that happens, the grassiness and some of the refreshing qualities I like about regular pilsners get taken away. Boulevard is the first brewery I have tasted that still has a lot of the pilsner taste I like in their imperial version. The alcohol is upped, but I do not feel like I am choking on it. This is a very good beer and one I will get again. If I was not grading to style, it is probably closer to a 4, but it blows away every other example I have had in the style.","tigg924","Oct 24, 2012"

3.48,-7,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"An explosion of bubbles fills the Pilsner glass to the rim and continue unabated, keeping the huge white head in full effect. Color is pale yellow with golden hues. Smells of fresh squeezed lemon, grain and a hint of grass. Not much going on aroma wise. Flavorful light fruits and malt are quickly followed by a subdued hoppiness and an afterthought of caramel. A bit of spice lies underneath it all. Not as dry as expected, and actually has quite a creamy mouth-feel. The alcohol heat tickles the throat. Overall this one is quite balanced and drinkable. And while I'm not the biggest Imperial Pils fan, I'm thoroughly enjoying this one.","stephens101","Oct 18, 2012"

4,7,4,4,4,4,4,"Overall: Pilsners are not one of my favorite styles of beer and I rarely stop and buy them at bottle shops. I have to say that this would be best to have on a hot day sitting on the back porch barbequing and sharing with friends. I did enjoy this, especially when I got to the second half of the 750mL bottle. It was nice to have a hand-crafted pilsner for a change brewed with quality ingredients. This is definitely a giant step over all the other massively produced adjunct brews available out there. I’m a real big fan of Boulevard’s line of Smokestack series beers and I when I heard that they were going to make an imperial pilsner I realized that I haven’t had a craft brewed pilsner yet and I just had to purchase a bottle and give it a chance. This beer was well crafted and moderately well-balanced, and if you a fan of pilsners, I would recommend picking this up while it’s sticking around and still fresh.","Stoutfan23DJ","Oct 01, 2012"
