It sets an impression of a home-brewer brewing up a heavy-hitting beer just because he can. Lots of hops, no matter the flavor, and lots of alcohol because there are so many lightweight beers to be shamed. Just too harsh unpleasant on my palate. I feel like I have to try their Bohemian Pils just to see if they can mellow out a much as they can ramp up.","steveh","Jul 12, 2014"

4.01,4.2,3.5,3.75,4.25,4,4,"Neighbor brought a growler home from Solemn Oath. The beer poured a light-golden color with thin white head that dissipated toward the bottom. The scent had a subtle piney notes mixed with typical pilsner grassy tones. The taste had the common grassy hop character of most pilsners, but this was balanced nicely with a sweeter malt. The mouthfeel was a medium body beer with ok carbonation. Overall it was a very good beer and would highly recommend it.","WoodBrew","0"
