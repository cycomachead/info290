3.88,-2.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Aroma is crisp and malty, not strong, a subtle fruity note. Pours a luscious clear dark amber with a frothy and rather persistent pale buff head. Rich, malty flavor has a fruity undertone, mainly apple plus touches of pear and banana, and a snippet or two of hops. Smooth texture has good body, if not a whole lot of fizz. Leaves a nice malty, fruity, slightly hoppy finish. For a malt liquor, danged good!","Cyberkedi","Feb 15, 2015"
4.25,6.8,,,,,,"Tastes very hoppy, while not being intensly bitter, with grass and hints of herbs, accompanied by orange and papaya. Malts are well integrated, pushing the taste into a sweeter direction. The malt sweetness then gets damped by a wheaty, dry finish, in which the metallic carbonation shines. The dry finish remains interesting, due to tropical fruits, playing a convincing counterpart to the typical pils-like lager finish.","aleigator","Nov 28, 2014"

4.05,1.8,3.75,4.25,4,4,4,"12 oz. sampled at Beer Revolution in Calgary. A hazy orange-yellow amber with a light smattering of white bubbles. Very perfumed tropical/citrus aroma (lychee, mango, papaya, light orange), with a classy underlay of sweet bread evoking pilsener malts. Perhaps the most tropical hop accented double pils I've sampled to date, the rich malts somehow taking a backseat to hops both green/resinous and brightly fruity. The co-occurring rich sweetness (caramel and honey) and tropical hops evoke papaya spears. Fizzy but the bubbles are gentle, quite thick and overall is reminiscent of a tropical fruit smoothie. Pleasant floral perfume in the finish. Interesting brew, a double pils hopped like a less piney west coast IPA. Gentle yet still somehow conveys an image of understated strength.","CalgaryFMC","Sep 27, 2014"

Smell: notes of soft tropical fruit and citrus peel, stone fruit, biscuit. Taste: honeyed biscuit, grape, apricot, indistinctly citrusy, herbal, pine and alcohol notes. Sugary finish. Pretty hoppy, nice, but not revelatory as the shelf talker's 100 rating illegitimately professed.","babaracas","Nov 14, 2013"

The hoppy resin proceeds into the pallet and further accented by the clean malt profile. That being said, the hops really shine (as well as the noticeable but not unwelcome booze).

4,0.5,4,4,4,4,4,"pleased to find this at Davidsons on county line, a new spot for me, and a new mikkeller, brilliant! billed a malt liquor, im not sure what to expect. it pours a familiar looking English malty tannish brown color, with some golden hues and an inch or two of lazy white head. the nose is malts forward, and rather alcoholic for the 8% abv its listed at, but with an interesting twist of fruit in there, oranges, candied, I don't know. the flavor agrees, malt forward, not too sweet through, with some fruit and booze on the back end. its a little thinner than I want it to be, but the flavors work really well. its got an almost pilsner malt flavor to it, dry and European, but it also has some caramel sweetness. its not complex, but it isn't simple either, sort of a hard beer to put into context. fine carbonation above a medium body. the finish is spirited, and I get a touch of brown sugar as it goes out. overall a beer worth the 14 bucks I paid for it this time, but probably not one ill buy again, despite really enjoying its grain profile and drinkability.","StonedTrippin","May 05, 2013"

Taste starts with a blast of hops, chased by some breadiness and a hint of sweetness. Feel leaves a little something to be desires, with no carbonation to speak of. It's too smooth for a pilsener but it still has a bite from the alcohol.

Here this is well attenuated by the healthy addition of those usual American hop suspects, Amarillo and Cascade, so much so that I more than once felt like I was just drinking a somewhat overly hot west coast IPA.

4.42,11.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Picked this up at my favorite beer store in Belgium, Dranken Geers. Clear amber-yellow pour with big two finger head with great retention and lacing. Floral, hoppy, herbal nose with hints of grass, lemon peel, bread, and a bit of caramel. First sip really caught me off guard. Wasn't expecting such a bold, flavorful beer. The taste is loaded with perfumey, citrusy, bitter fresh hops along with hints of pine and tangerines. All nicely balanced out with a solid caramel malt backbone. The mouthfeel is perfectly carbonated and subtly oily with a crisp, dry, bitter finish. Hugely drinkable. I'm kicking myself for only getting one of these.

There was really very little information on the bottle, but since it was a lager, I thought I had some idea of what to expect. This is not it. They should really print SOMETHING on the bottle to give an indication as to its contents. This was really terrible. Mostly because I don't like this style of beer, but since I didn't receive any indication of the style, I feel compelled to rate it as beer in general. It was very bitter, very citrus.

The beer pours a hazy murky looking golden brown color with about an inch of head with good sticky lace. The body looks a little unapealing but it's not bad. Seems like if I drank this sooner there would be more of aaa hop presence but still a pretty good aroma. Candied orange with sweet toffee. The flavor is just like the aroma. Candied orange with a bit of toffee. Big malt body on this. I feel like I'm not reviewing this in it's prime. The feel is kind of sticky with good carbonation. Still an enjoyable beer. Even though I think it's past it's prime. If you got any of these drink up. I don't think there is any point in holding on to these.","Bendurgin","Mar 15, 2011"

Hops are a bit serious with a lot to offer in flavor and bitterness. Malt isn't holding back either, with rustic bread and dried grass on the palate.

At 8% ABV, it's a slow sipping beer that's warmly hopped and tastes like light brown sugar or that cotton candy flavor, but without being too sweet. All this is lovingly well-balanced to make a sexy, modern, beer. I was unable to find any clues about why the Mikkeller Draft Bear is called a ""bear"" (is it related to the mythical Boontville creature from Anderson Valley, the Beer?).

Still, there is some serious bitterness on the nose, which is replicate on the palate. However, this beer is a bit more complex, with some honey, pepper and dry ginger ale. Like the Danish Dream, the finish is surprising bitter (albeit not quite as dry). Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a pretty long finish. Alcohol is pretty well disguised, thought the beer seems on the boozy side after the Danish Dream. Nevertheless, this is yet another very fine beer from Mikkeller.","John_M","Jan 08, 2010"

3.64,-8.5,3,4,4,3,3,"So, I'm not a pilsner person. It's funny because I think pilsner glasses are really nice but usually I am more impressed with the glass than its contents. The other thing about pilsners is that, in comparison with other beers, there's not a lot of room for show. It's the blonde woman of beer. Can't really get much out of her. But Mikkeller can. I've yet to be disappointed with his brews. While his methods are unorthodox, his brews are delicious, and this Imperial Pilsner is no different. The head was really fluffy, and that means that even on our tall pilsner glasses, you get more lace than an 80s wedding. The head thins out, but you keep it most of the way down. The scent was something like green apples. Tart, crisp, and fresh. Like you could bite into it. Like it would make your breath fresh. The color is just a tad dark for a pilsner, but it is imperial. The taste has a very consistent hop flavor from sip to aftertaste, with the apple notes twisting around it, like snakes around a caduceus. However, it is still a pilsner. But if you have to drink a pilsner, it should be this one.","Sechavar","Oct 26, 2009"

I poured a 750ml bottle into my New Belgium goblet. This beer pours a hazy orange-honey with a huge, Crest White Strips whitehead that receded (somewhat) leaving some pretty hardcore sticky lacing down the sides of my glass. The aroma is big American West Coast hop goodness. Lots of orange, pink grapefruit, and a bit of peach. This is nothing like any other Malt Liquor I've been privy too. The flavor is big and fruity. Mostly just orange and lemon from the hops but a bit of malty sweetness muscles its way thought this hop bomb. The mouthfeel is light and crisp like most well done lagers. This is a great beer. Mikkeller definitely lives up to their reputation of taking a American style and perfecting it. But in its perfection it looses its entirety. This isn't a Malt Liquor.

It just doesn't come together entirely. It certainly has some pilsner taste, but it's much bigger with the grapefruit-orange hops than anything else. The beer does look great. I'll give it that. Huge rocky head that sticks around like nobody's business. It's ultimately just too sweet and orangey to stick with for long. It's like eating an under-ripe grapefruit after a little while. This beer might be a lot better when it's at its freshest, but it's certainly not local, so it's hard to correct for that possibility.

It is also not as exuberantly hopped as the Sam Adams Hallertau Imperial Pilsner. Tastes more like a high quality malt liquor to me- which is what the bottle says. The bready notes are still there, but they are a bit buried by spicy, earthy hops and the lager yeast as well as some caramel and buttery notes. A little prickly going down.
