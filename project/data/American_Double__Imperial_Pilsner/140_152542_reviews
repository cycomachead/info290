"Overall a good solid beer.  It is definitely beyond seasonable but at 7 abv one could have a few for sure.  Give it a shot if you see it!"
"Hoppy with a lager base...good but slightly different ...lite enough to drink all day"
""
""
"Very good beer overall. Not a Pale or IPA but close to a Pale Ale. As the name suggests, drinks like a Lager, but at 5.2 ABV, puts you in a good spot. I really wish it wasn't a limited edition, this has grown to be one of my favorites when I'm not in the mood for something heavier."
""
"This beer tasted like it was trying to hard. Nice hoppy character but overall the sweetness was a little too high. It was good, I'd drink it again, but it just seemed to be not all together."
""
""
""
""
"The floral notes on the smell aren't strong enough in my opinion. I'd like to try this right after it was bottled. Pretty smooth finish but overall just a tad bland."

"As I am just beginning my foray into lagers, I would put this in the group of beers I'll likely not buy again (since it won't be there anyway), but will certainly drink if offered. I found it to fall on the subtle side of the flavor profiles of Fathom. Keep in mind, I am very early in this lager game and my hop-headedness is still informing me. I will in time learn to extract and appreciate the ""crisp," much as I now crave the funk in Belgians where before that was an acquired taste."
""
""
""
""
""
"This really is a hoppy lagar."
"I thought this was light, refreshing, hoppy, and great overall. It would make a really nice summer beer in the same vein as Gumballhead (still love my Gumballhead more, though)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – A rather crisp and refreshing lager style beer even at 7 % abv. (which it hides very well).  I rather enjoyed this one as it makes a good flavorful summer style hopped brew."
""
"Amazing beer. Can't wait to have it again"

"O: [3.00] The word ""hoppy"" is on the label and sets an expectation.  It fell short on hops in the nose and the taste.  This beer is very average.  It has some characteristic malty lager taste - but none of the expected hop bitterness."
"Crisp and clean taste, citrus peel, florals, lightly drying grassy bitterness in the aftertaste. Light feel, pretty well balanced. Overall this is a nice beer for warmer weather, cutting the grass, etc."
""
""
""
"Golden color. Light hoppy smell. The hops are subtle to taste and definitely not overbearing. A worthy spring ""one-time only"" available lager.  With the usual Sierra carbonation. Bottled, packaged on 02/26/15 from TJs."

"you need a 12 pack to get you drunk"
""
""
""
"Presentation: Packaged in a stubby twelve-ounce brown glass bottle with a pry-off crown, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I might have had this a tad old because hoppy it was not it really just tasted like a bud or coors or miller I only drank a few ounces before asking for a different beer so take my review with a grain of salt."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Good brew you can pick at your local grocery. Couple bucks less it would be a steal."
""
""
""
""
"Continuing my affirmation that I hate hoppy beers. This one is borderline insufferable in its bitterness."
""
""
"Big, but not super bright hops. Seems to take traditional pilsner hops with a mroe American malt character, amplifying everything. The grassy, herbal bitter lingers and rolls into fruitier notes, but it's a biting, rough finish, harder than Torpedo."
"O: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, it’s a solid beer but there are several other options within the style that I would pick first."
"Nice combination of hops ans lager sweetness.  Very refreshing"
"Had this at a BBQ. Its nothing special, but it beats drinking a bud thats for sure. Its a decent selection for a summer beer. Something you buy in bulk for a BBQ"
""
""
"Clear gold pour with thick bright white head; some lacing. Biscuit and floral notes. Rose petals with whisper of lemon, hop bitterness on the finish. Lite mouthfeel with hoppy tongue coating. Lite bodied but flavorful for a lager."
""
""
""
"Good beer. Almost like a sweet cross between an ipa and pale ale"
"A hoppy lager that's great for Spring--but you could happily drink it year round.  Good in every way."
"One of the best lagers I have ever had"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is the closest thing to an IPA my wife will drink, so it's a nice pickup for when we want to split a sixer."
"Golden is color with a decent head and a little lacing too.  Smell is of pine and citrus and the taste follows that as well.  A little bitterness on the palate but finishes very well.  A very good beer that I'd try again."
"Just an outstanding recent beer."
""
""
"Nothing like Hoponious union or the IPL's out there. It definitely has an extra hop kick, and I'd love to try it on tap or fresher. Not memorable but refreshing and sierra nevada is always a good deal."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Given the descriptors I expected more hops, though for a lager I suppose this is hoppy. This does not taste like a 7% beer and overall is crisp and balanced"
""
""
""
"A delightfully tasty hoppy Lager is what we have here. Cheers SN!"
""
""
"Serving type: bottle"
""
""
""
""
""
"This one is more of a pale ale than a lager.  Light lemon peel aroma,  good, mild bitterness that sticks around a while.  ABV(7.0) sits nicely in the background."
"It's hoppy and has the classic taste of a high abv lager, which to me is like cooked corn/DMS and some sulfer, and those do not go well at all with the hop flavors.  Definitely would have been better as a lower abv lager."
"Taste: there is a fruity finish, the hops are detectable on the back of the throat - a bit sticky on the tongue.  Not much on the front end - an interesting tasting beer. Alcohol is very well hidden.  Nothing offensive here, a good beer overall, definitely worth a first try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  meh.  It's a hoppy lager.  Pretty tasty for a lager.  I enjoy ales though.  On the fence if I would buy it again."
""
""
"Overall: Nice. Not perfect, but quite enjoyable. Would buy again."
""
""
"Clean and aromatic, this is a beer to have in the refrigerator. This is one I almost passed up, but got it in a mixed sixer purchased at the Ralph's grocery. I'm going back to my local store for the 12 pack."
""
"Although the hoppy lager is an interesting idea, the flavors seem to conflic and the aroma is just COMPLETELY off."
"Overall: Even though this isn't something I would drink regularly, it seems like a good example of the IPL style. It's a bit sweeter than I prefer and it seemed to lose its appeal somewhat as it warmed, but it is basically pretty enjoyable."
"I have enjoyed a six pack and the hoppy lager is definitely there. Easy to drink smooth with a small punch . Very good taste ."
"Overall: Despite somewhat lower alcohol, this is still pretty similar to the Ballast Point collaboration from last year's Beer Camp, which was my favorite of the bunch. So I lazily copied over most of that review. Why did I buy only one?"
"12 oz single purchased from Trader Joes in Salem OR. $1.59 Typical clear lighter golden coloured lager but with an impressive bubbly white head and lace. Good juicy hoppy aroma..almost like a fresh hop ale. Flavour similar to aroma..very good juicy fresh mango and grapefruit some black pepper..excellent. Great medium carbonated medium body mouth feel and nice after taste. Excellent beer..so enjoyed this"
""
""
""
""
"Man, I LOVE this beer. The wonderful bitterness of hops, sweet malts, and a crisp lager finish. Easy drinking, smooth, balanced. Floral and citrus with sweet, light malt. Beautiful golden color with a nice big thick white head. Not as heavy as a 7% IPA would be, and is really refreshing."
""
"O: A clean and very drinkable blonde that is indeed very hoppy. Super easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
"12 oz bottle.  Pours deep golden with tall, long lasting, fluffy white head and nice lacing.  Aroma is of citrusy hops, tropical fruit and bready malt.  Body is medium and crisp.  Citrusy hops, bready malt and tropical fruit fill the mouth.  Finish is long, dry, herbal.  Excellent brew."

"Sierra Nevada Beer Camp Hoppy Lager 2015 -----3.5/5"
""
"O-  Awesome beer for the price!"
""
""
""
"Floral aroma hops with a caramel background. Bittering hops come through first on taste and biscuity lager flavors finish."
"I had it after an IPA so my taste buds may have been washed out but to me it came off as a slightly more bitter pilsner or helles. The taste of noble hops was pronounced"
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is another excellent beer from Sierra Nevada. Hops are what they are known for and this is an interesting brew with hops added to a lager. It is like a baby IPA but with that lager finish."
""
""
""
"t/m/o - crisp and grainy...they hops have faded...or one would assume since there is no citric blast, but still shows some presence.  very refreshing and a nice take on a pils.  this didn't change my life, but sierra nevada rarely disappoints and this is no exception...would be great for a batch of this to get bottled in may for sipping as the weather grows hotter."
""
"Wow this took me by surprise, hop flavor of a great citrus IPA with a super clean backing, unique flavors for a SN brew"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not bad, but not overly interesting."
""
"Drinkable but not on my buy again list."
""
""
"This brew definitely grew on me with some time. The heavy floral and herbal tones are a nice compliment to the Cascade-esque citrus tones I find at the forefront. Strong lager feel only helps to make it more unique."
""
"D: near perfect.  GUzzle time!"
""
"3.84/5.00"
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
"Light gold with a smallish white head. Wonderful aroma full of pine and earth that is very clean. Loads of hop flavor with some light bread but the lager yeast definitely lends a crispness to the beer. Very light finish with just a touch of lingering bitterness. Another awesome beer from Sierra Nevada."
""
"Overall: a pretty refreshing lager, for hop heads."
"It is good. As I already mentioned, it tastes like just about every IPL that I have tried. I have liked that vast majority of this style. It is definitely worth a try."
""
""
""
""
"Deliciously flavored hoppy awesome beer!"
"Neither hoppy nor lager-y. Just a medicine muddled mess."
""
"Not good a reviews ..but awesome Americanized example of a lager...crisp nice carb and very nice citrusy hoppyness... Similar to a American pale ale but with a hop forward appeal works great with this lager"
""
""
""
"O - this was a great beer very nice flavors and great for late winter."
""
""
""
"Pours a clear golden color with white head. Pine and citrus are the most present aromas on the nose; follows onto the palate. Finishes with a lager type of malt flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
"The lager goes down almost too easily at 7.0 % ABV.  This is another fine experiment by Sierra Nevada which leads me to ask what exactly is this: a pumped up pilsner, a hoppy, pale bock or as the label states, ""Indian Style Pale Lager"".  Regardless of the style, this is a fine spring seasonal; worth seeking out."
""
"Overall:  I like hoppy lagers (and ales) so a $6.99 6 pack was worth a shot.  Better yet, it reminds me of Prima Pils in its grassy hoppiness.  I didn't realize it was 7% until I started entering this review, doesn't feel that heavy.  Good stuff."
""
"Overall I like this beer.  Its a lager that tries to be an IPA.  Sierra Nevada has several good IPA's. This one to me is a easy drinking beer."
""
""
""
""
"This beer camp limited release is decent. Look- limited lacing, great gold color, head sticks around a bit. Smell- ok, you get the hops and bread like yeast quality. Taste- good, very bitter at first than it uniquely becomes the lager character. Somehow, the malt takes over. It is sort of strange and different. Feel- nothing too distinctive.. Drinkable with the 7.0 abv. Overall- very cool to try this effort. It is a spring limited. I did not love it but I enjoyed it for the most part."
""
"Mouthfeel is good..Crisp, light and plenty bitter!!!!  Very much worth having again. A lager for hop heads...far from boring!!!!!"
""
""
"Cheers!"

""
""
"I'm a huge fan of hoppy beers, but their flavor seems to work better when brewed in an ale and not a lager. This is not a bad brew, but the flavor is kinda off for my liking."
"Poured into a Sierra Nevada shaker pint. Pours a medium coppery amber with a nice one finger white head that continued to build well after the pour, with thick lacing. Aroma of light bready and biscuit malt, citrus, dank hops, light orange and tropical fruit. Flavor is sweet bready malt, light citrus, piney and dank hops, developing lightly estery mixed fruit into a slightly astringent, hoppy finish with light but nicely balanced herbal hop flavors and bitterness. Light to medium bodied with active carbonation. The aroma fooled my into thinking this would be similar to an IPA, but the flavor is much closer to a bready, biscuit pilsner or heavy lager, but with more interesting herbal hop character and a very nice, interesting fruit and malt body. Except for a slight astringency, the finish is very satisfying. A very nice example of an uncommon style that I'm enjoying whenever possible. Another great hoppy beer from Sierra."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a really nice beer that covers both of the categories I've been craving more often lately (hops + lagers), and I'm glad I picked some up during the limited time that it's going to be available--just this spring!  If you haven't had it yet, I'd suggest trying some while it's still around."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tastes more like an IPA than a lager. The clean hoppy finish is great. Tastes like a session beer, but at 7% it's a bit more. Overall, a gold one."
""
""
""
"Super Dangerous goes down like a Coors light, But full-bodied and delicious. My favorite Sierra Nevada offering, I'm going to have to store a case or 2 of this for the summer."
""
"12 oz bottle.  Pour golden and clear with a bit of frothy white head.  Some scent of hops but not a very aromatic brew.  Taste the hops of an IPA right away but quickly disappears and goes down easily.  This is dangerously delicious.  A lager should not have this much alcohol and character.  I hope they continue to make this because I would be a life long customer."
"Bottle of hoppy lager drank."
"Bitter initially, with sweet notes behind it.  Nice malty finish, which sets it apart from the other offerings from sierra nevada that may seem similar initially. A bit of smokiness in there too."
""
""
"very good. super citrus nots"
""
""
""
""
"Very tasty with a nice balance."
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste-Toasted biscuit malt,flowery, fruity hop note. Crisp and refreshing, a good ""after shoveling"" brew."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, not a bad effort but I seem to remember enjoying last summer's version better. It's a decent beer and perhaps a good entry point for BMC fans looking to try something tastier. That said, there are too many other choices out there and I would not buy this vintage again."
"12oz bottle poured into pint glass. Pours a clear golden amber color. Not much head and not much lacing. Slow-moving, sporadic carbonation bubbles. Definitely can taste the hop kick and much more flavorful than a traditional lager and more sessionable than many IPAs. Smooth taste without much bitterness. (8.0)"
""
"Delicious, almost the perfect beer. Enticing aroma of hops with a kiss of grain. Pours a golden color with a decent head. To me, this beer is the perfect balance of hops, malt and drinkability. I would love to see this beer available as a regular offering. As much as I like Hop Hunter, I prefer this beer instead. This is the well behaved older brother, Hop Hunter is the brattier sibling."
"O- a highly drinkable pilsner that seems to balance a honey sweetness with the bitterness of the hops"
"O: Quite good, an iteration of a pilsner that I could enjoy time and time again. Feels like a love child between SNPA and Summerfest... for the better."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Definitely a good brew. A bit oversold. Probably wouldnt buy a full sixer alone."
""
""
"This is a lovely beer, with a strange, almost AAL-like finish. Balance is really superb, and a delicate hand put all these flavors together where they can each shine without overpowering."
""
"Picked this up at the local convenience store (!) among mediocrity.  With that bar set, SN rarely disappoints and I can't say I was disappointed.  It definitely has the light mouthfeel of a lager, but hop aftertaste.  Not a whole lot of lacing, but pours out very nice and looks very good for a so called lager.  I enjoyed and was happy to see a second 6er a month after the initial release at the same store.  Overall not super great, but definitely something worth having and enjoying, especially with a price point below $9 a six pack."
"Sorry for the quick review, just didn't like this one too much. Definitely not very hoppy, lingered on the malty, lager side and the mix did not work very well. Didn't like the bite in the mouth. Gave it a go with at least 4 from a six pack, just didn't work for me."

"This beer good good good"

""
""
"Not very hoppy for a ""hoppy lager""."
""
""
""
"Kind of average for an IPA. They have better but not bad by no means. Head fades fast. Does leave rings on the way down. Just seems a bit bitter. Good flavor at first. I would buy again."
""
""
""
""
"Beer camp is I suppose, a hoppy lager. The hops have a good flavor up front, but after a few sips, seem to lose their potency. Seems like a suitable session drink if you like lagers, but only average in taste."
""
""
"Great smell, nice look. The taste sort of reminds me of a hoppier rebel ipa but a lot better. The crispness is amazing. Great carbonation"
""
"O:  Really decent beer.  The malts and hops work together to make a good balance."
""
""
""
"Overall- This is a really good American Double.  This is the first Beer Camp series that I have had.  I look forward to trying others."
""
"Overall, for my first beer in the beer camp series, I'm pretty disappointed. Not a bad brew by any means, and definitely a good taste on the style blend, but not quite what I was hoping for."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Definitely a hoppy lager. Has great drinkability."
""
"Bitter version of their pale ale"
""
""
""
""
"It’s okay. A nice go between the IPA and Maibock style. Approaches a more American hop-forward character while holding on to its roots in strong German lager land. (3.25)"
"Very bland. Was expecting more of a west coast taste."
"O - A beer that proves a hoppy imperial pilsner can be done well.  It is not necessarily something I've been looking for, but I recognize the excellent craft involved.  I do wish the hop elements included in the nose were more apparent on the tongue, and if I were to knock this brew, it would be that the hop profile is perhaps a touch too traditional.  But a solid brew, regardless."

"Pours a very slightly cloudy golden yellow color, nice carbonation, with a one-finger creamy white head, some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is mostly malty with some hop notes, some sweetness. The taste is malty with a nice hop note bite. Medium body, with a nice dry/bitter finish. Overall a pretty tasty brew, I would buy it again if available."
"IPA drinkers kinda lager, very drinkable and smooth with a nice hoppy flavor, not overdone and not to subtle. Yet another good selection from Sierra Nevada"
"I am not a lager lover, but I would order this again.  Nice latent bitter,  but not overly hopped."
"Not overly impressed. I was hoping for more hop flavors in this one lots of bitterness which was great but it could use some more of that flavor punch. Very smooth beer though, easy drinking with lots of great malt flavor in it as well."
""
"I really liked this beer but i think it was to focused on hopping it up and not supplying a lager."
""
""
"Nice even hop notes malty finish and mild but fresh citrus notes"

"Overall, damn tasty beer.  I'm going back for more!"

"Easy drinking and tasty brew, well worth a try...or two"
"The west coasts answer to Boston Lager."
""
""
""
""
"It's good, but it doesn't quite live up to the description on the label."
"There was enough alcohol in here that I could feel it once I finished this off, but never did I taste it during my session. Underneath all of these flavors was the resin that characterizes any great beer from Sierra Nevada and combined with the faint reminder of hops that are found in hose beers, served as a link to their other offerings. This was different though and had a crisp finish like any Lager should. Solid stuff her that would be a great choice during the warmer months!"
""
""
""
"I Pop!ped the cap and let fly with a heavy-handed pour the likes of which I have not employed in several weeks. I am aware of the adage that :Fresh beer is better", but my backlog is stunning (to say the least) and so I am catching up as best as I can. Two-plus fingers of dense, tawny head later and I was taking a break to allow it to slowly fall. The lacing left in its wake made me want to weep because it was going to take a jackhammer to remove and I haven't the time/patience/money/wherewithal. Color was Amber (SRM = > 7, "
""
"O: delicious"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A good beer for sure, but one I find does not play well to the lager aspects of its title."
""
""
""
""
""
"Great I.P.L always enjoy beer from Sierra Nevada, this one does not disappoint."
""
"The name is all you need. It's a hoppy lager. Smells like a lager, with some floral hops. Taste a little buttery with some hops. (Wife thought it was an ipa). Crisp, slightly creamy finish. Like this one better than the ballast point collaboration ipl. Too bad they say it is a one time only beer. Be great in the summertime."
""
""
"Tasty lager for the year of 2015"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It was quite fresh and somewhat light/medium bodied. There was also a crisp quality that reminded me of a quaffable tropical beach beer. The 7% alcohol is well hidden and it can sneak up on you if you're not careful.  Very interesting lager; perfect for the warm spring months ahead."
""
"It's a very drinkable beer. Goes down smooth. Not to hoppy. Good taste"
""
"O.  Nice summer beer. Very sessionable. It's like a lighter IPA. Would drink again calling or a barbeque."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours an amber color with a very thick foamy head.  Head retention and lacing are excellent.  Has a crisp, piney, citrus, floral  aroma.  Nice hoppy taste with a citrus, astringent aftertaste.  There is a little breadiness in the beginning.  The lager taste is detected at the end.  Very good beer.  Very impressed.  Best attempt at a pilsner meets IPA that I have had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Love the Pale Ale start to the taste. The aftertaste is where you taste more of the booze than the lager... Still too much booze, but I loved it none the less. If they can master this, they won't just be making this a seasonal beer."
""

"Very nice easy drinking beer. Smells of pepper and grapefruit. Has a nice hoppy, malty taste that finishes clean."

"some hop with a pils background, good crisp and bitter aftertaste"

"Even though I'm trying not to drink during the week, I couldn't resist since I picked it up yesterday.  88 on BA. Some gave it mediocre reviews.. Made in collaboration with ballast point. Bottled mid January. It's dangerous. Light. IPA tasty. 7% tastes like 5%. I could drink quite a few. $9.99/6 at Wegmans. Rating 4.8/5.It's sweet and hoppy - a deliteful new formula that would have appeal to IPA newbie's."
""
""
"O:  There were several other offerings in last year's Beer Camp that should've been considered over this one.  Maillard's Odyssey, the Coffee Stout.  It's OK, just not exciting."
""
""
""
"O-  much taste for a Lager."
""
""
""
"Was excited to try this one but thought it just wasn't as hoppy as I thought it would be and the lager yeast was a bit overpowering the hops."
"Yum. Wife brought home a sixer as a surprise. I'd never seen it before. What can I tell you...just a clean, crisp, hoppy, quite drinkable lager. Was shocked that this was 7% as it drinks very easily. Great job on this one SN."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  An improvement from the electric ray by lowering the ABV.  More clean and crisp than the original beer camp iteration.  Incredibly refreshing and crushable."
"Eminently drinkable... One of the best Sierra Nevada offerings in my opinion.  Loaded with hop flavor but not overdone.  Excellent paired with food or alone."
""
""
"Good quality beer. Sierra Nevada has once again out done there competition. It has a smooth taste not watered down and not to mention 7% ABV without the strong alcohol taste. I don't consider myself a expert but I have drank many beers if your looking for a good complex lager this is it. This is not for the weak hearted but for the men who like a good strong quality beer. Just my opinion of course."
""
"India Pale Lager or Pilsner? This one comes across like a melding of the two styles. The clean, grassy, dry crackery aspects of the pilsner as present, while at the other end await kisses of kiwi and pineapple. It's a medium bodied beer which drinks almost as easy as a pilsner, an accomplishment given the ABV clocks in at 7%. Cheers to Sierra Nevada for this experiment that worked!"
""
""
""
"Was surprised to see this at my WalMart so had to pick it up and try....very enjoyable...not as ""hoppy"" as the name would suggest...nice combo however of a ""hoppy"" taste with an obvious lager"
"Nose pine, grassy hops, citrus rinds, toasted malts, cereal, floral. Taste sweet citrus, peppery, floral, toasted grains, slight resin. Nice!"
""
""
"Not life changing but a seriously solid IPL. Light, crisp, hoppy...I think 55ibus is a bit of an under statement. And how can you beat a good beer, that's 7%, and under $11 a 6pk?"
""
""
""
""
"Gold and so frickin clear. Head dissipates quickly. Fruity hops and  pine in the nose along with malt sweetness. Those all come balanced in the flavor with a healthy dose of bitterness. A touch of cloying sweetness gives it a little more body and keeps it from being smooth. I do like the floral finish, though. Worth trying."

"This pours a clear gold tan with a great foamy cap. There's a bright aroma of a lightly fruity citrusy hop with a piney finish. This has a great flavor to it, with a drying pine finish. Tasty! For some reason it doesn’t stick around in the fridge here."
"Pours clear corn color with everlasting white head. Smells of fresh grains, citrus, pine, some floral. Tastes of fresh grains, cereal, citrus, pine, floral, and a boozy warmth. Medium bodied with medium carbonation. Niiiice."

"Lightly hazy light golden color with a huge bone white head. Wow that is DANK! I think I'm getting a contact high. Huge piney pitchy resinous aromas dominate, if there's malt underneath I can't find it. The flavor is light crackery malt with a bit more spice than pine in the flavor. Smooth bitterness with a lingering spice. Medium body with a moderate carbonation. Damn I should have bought more than just a single, I'm rally digging this."

"I like this Hoppy Lager.  It pours a pale golden with white head that is leaving a nice lace.  The scent carries floral hop.  The taste is well balanced between malt and hops which bring spice and citrus.  The mouthfeel is fuller in body with smooth carbonation.  Overall.....extremely solid."
"Bottle. Pours a vivid, honey color. Like all Sierra Nevada beeyaz, this one sports a textbook cap of foam. I don't always like their beers but goddamn do they look the part. I was initially impressed by the nose. It's hoppy for sure, yet there is a very clean Pilsner malt. It actually smells like an amplified Pilsner. Ipso facto an Imperial Pilsner. Got it, now I'm on the right track. As I digress, I will say most of these hip, new hoppy Lagers/Pilsners seem to be IPAs with different strain of yeast. This one smells closer to its ancestry. It's still a Pils. The flavor keeps most of what I was yapping about right before. It's sweeter and loses a bit of its charisma but it's still tasty. Its not the tunnel-visioned hop bomb I was expecting. It's done well. The yeasty flavors manage to stay crisp despite the high ABV. It's plenty hoppy and it keeps its Pilsner malt profile. I was not expecting to like this. Sierra Nevada did a collaboration beer in their last Beer Camp package...Electric Ray was the name. It was the same style per se and the label art was nearly identical. I did not enjoy it. I expected a reincarnation of Electric Ray. This offering is far from it. I liked this a lot."

"Another 'chuggable' by Sierra Nevada.  Though, this could be sipped a bit slower and still enjoyed."
"I at first loved this beer. It was hoppy and flavorful, but my opinion has recently changed. I've recently noticed how extremely heavy this beer is. I feel extremely full and pretty bloated every time I drink it. I never have this problem with an average west coast IPA. By not carry the IPA label and still being pretty good tasting and hoppy, it should earn respect, but I will probably not buy it again. In terms of Sierra Nevada, I will be headed towards the torpedo or seasonal IPAs again."

"Poured a clear straw gold with one finger head and lace pactches/ring.  Aroma is flowery/floral with just tiny amounts of citric zip and spice in the hops along with a little graininess. Light bodied, crisp, easy drinking lager with some floral hops and spice with a dry finish.  Not my favorite beer at all but it is pleasant."

"Not quite what I expected; a very sharp, assertive and boozy brew.  I thought it was as it says a ""hoppy lager.""  The ABV wasn't on the 12-pack box I bought, so I was surprised it was an imperial pilsner.  I feel like pilsner is better left alone than transformed into anything ""imperial.""  But, it is a good beer, just not a hoppy session lager like I'd hoped for.  Amped up lager at 7% ABV with some malt liquor qualities."

"Always love the creative names Sierra Nevada gives to these Beer Camp offerings.  Gold.  Anyway, this stuff pours a clear brass topped by a half-finger of off-white foam.  The nose is nearly non-existent for me, though some minor notes of dank greens and leek struggle to push through at times.  The taste holds notes of pine, onion, light bread, and grass.  Though not completely offensive, I would almost rather these flavors be as meek as the smell...  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry finish.  Overall, I was not a fan of this hoppy lager at all.  Many aspects were muted, and then what sensory inputs (outputs?  hmm....) were there weren't all that pleasing to my organs.  Oh well, SN'll likely make it up to me with their next offering, so no big loss here."

Bitterness really lingers. Reminiscent of a Kolsch but with more hops. Very crisp and light on the tongue with a vibrant carbonation. Overall a nice drinking beer. The crisp light malts really work with the bright citrus hops. Check it out for sure."

"Amazing Beer. You definitely want to seek this golden colored beauty out. This beer has a lot to offer, loaded with classic lager flavors with an awesome kick of whole cone hops. The nose for this beer has big citrus hop aroma, a nice underlining of sweetness, and a mild amount of maltiness :) The taste of this beer was amazing and complex. The whole cone hops shine right on through. Nice and big citrus (grapefruit stands out), a bit of bitterness (55 IBUs), and it balances the bitterness with a nice malt sweetness. The texture of this beer is excellent as well. I love the classic IPA spin on a lager platform. Great beer Sierra Nevada!!"

"12oz. bottle served in an SA Perfect Pint. Packaged 12/22/14 indicated on the back label.  Pours a golden-orange with a slight haze to the clarity and a loose, quarter inch, bright white head.  Head eventually settles into a solid, consistent skim with some swaths and splashes of lacing.  Nose is subdued but expresses light citrus and herbal/resinous notes.  Taste consistent with nose with a slight sour mash character as well.  Mouthfeel is light in body with a lively carbonation falling just shy of crisp.  Overall, a decent hoppy lager, but not in the same ballpark as JA's hoppy lagers."

"The palate opens with a moderate bready lager flavor, very cleanly fermented with a pleasing hop character. Focused and precise, there's a blend of pine, honey and a little citrus, fresh and complex, playing quite nicely with the bready and doughy lager base. The flaw, however, is the higher than needed ABV. At 7%, this does have a warming character that's not wholly needed. Medium in body with moderate carbonation, this has a blend of sweetness and hop bitterness on the finish. Solid."
"Wow! Sierra Nevada kills it again. Firstly, this beer looks gorgeous. Deep copper, lots of bubbles, a hefty head that lingers for just the right time. Heavy dry hopped, cannabis-like smell. Taste is the best, I don't have a refined palate, but I'm almost positive I'm getting Cascade hops. An upfront hop taste, with a pleasent metallic taste that lingers. Lagering is what makes this beer. I'd describe this as a 1 1/2 IPA, the layering takes what I'd call a double IPA and makes an amazingly drinkable and refreshing beer full of flavor. At 7% ABV this had boy can be sneaky! Buy this ASAP, and PLEASE SIERRA NEVADA, DONT KEEP THIS AS A ONE TIME RELEASE, PLEASE!"

"Pale yellow in color with a slight haze. Poured with a short, dense, white foam with good retention as the foam is constantly fed by migrating bubbles from the bottom of the glass. Sheets of thick lacings are left on the glass. Intense citrus, floral and minty hop aromas with malty aromas at the back end. Medium bodied with moderate to aggressive carbonation through the middle and a slight puckering feel. A touch of boozy heat toward the finish. Flavors similar to aromas with intense citrus, floral and minty hop flavors with a malty backbone balancing out the heavy hop character. Medium-high bitterness through the middle. Finished cleanly, crisp and dry with a lingering hop bitterness and light bready, pilsner-like aftertaste. "

"Beer Camp: Hoppy Lager (2015) brewed by Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. This lager has an ABV of 7.0%. The brew pours out a nice amber color with a nice white head. Hoppy Lager smells like hops, grains and some malts. Nothing bad so far.  The taste is bitter sweet, with a smooth aftertaste. You also pick up on some nice grains and malts at the end of this brew.  The mouthfeel is bold with flavor, with a clean smooth aftertaste. Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. did a nice job with this brew.  There is nothing overpowering in this brew, it has a nice balance to it. Overall I'm giving ,Beer Camp: Hoppy Lager (2015), a solid 4 out 5.  I would buy this brew this again."

"It's a good beer!  Smell is great for a lager, sub-par for a hoppy beer.  Taste is exceptional for a lager, sub-par for a hoppy beer.  I think part of this sub-par experience is there choice of hops for this beer...[internet search]...wait a second: Palisade, El dorado, Citra, Equinox...that couldn't necessarily be it, some of the greatest IPAs are made with Citra: Surly Abrasive, Psuedo Sue, Zombie Dust and probably Odell IPA and Laguinitas Sucks!  Although I'm not sure there is any reason to use palisade hops...Blah!...in anything!  Not familiar with Equinox though.  Had beers I've enjoyed that have ad El Dorado hops, so I think that's a good hop too.  ...warming up the beer...reminds me of Bauhaus Brewery, a brewery in Minnesota that makes similarly exceptional hoppyish lager beers.  ...warming up the beer still...I'm not getting the familiar smells and flavors I'm used to getting with the Citra hop.  After warming it up some the smell/flavor is pretty similar for me as my latter experience.    The other thing I do like is the ABV is at 7%...never would have guessed it after sampling it!  Still waiting for that lager that really brings home the name hoppy lager.  This is great for the lager realm but some day I want to be punched in the nose with American hop aroma and then subsequently the mouth with the same experience along with a clean taste the comes with a lager.    All in all Great Lager!  I lover the bitterness of it.  Wish it came through with that familiar American hop aroma/flavor...even though, I think, it as all American hops...but yet still reminds me--for some reason--of European pilsners/lagers...is it just me? or..."

"O: Not bad, but by no means my favorite."
"Picked up a couple of singles at the Sunoco Craft Beer Exchange. Glad to see that I could sample this before committing to the 12-pack I ran across at the grocery store the other day. After chilling at home for an hour I filled an IPA tulip with a measured pour. The honey golden lager's exceptional clarity highlights the lively carbonation, as soda-like bubbles stream to the surface. A frothy white layer of foam gives the impression of a styrofoam puck. Excellent quality lacing clings to the glass. Without the carbonation I might mistake this for apple juice from concentrate. There's a nice bright hoppy fragrance. Dank, with an earthy smell that obscures the typical pale lager aroma. Plenty of sweet tropical scents round out the complex and aromatic nose. The first sip yields a cracker-like malt flavor that compliments the citrus sweetness. Dry in the finish with mild bitterness of grapefruit pith and pine. Considerably sweeter than any other pale lager that comes to mind. The 7% ABV is well hidden by the lingering hop qualities, though a boozy breath develops by mid-beer. The mouthfeel is juicy, with zesty carbonation. By far the best IPL I've had to date. However, generally speaking, the style is simply not my cup of tea. The 2 styles that come together here are just not entirely compatible in my opinion. Not to the extent that they can ever rival the finest stand-alone lagers or IPA's anyhow. I'd take Sierra Nevada's Summer Lager or any number of their IPA's over this. That said, it's a super-hopped, big blonde lager. Exactly as advertised. And it's great!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I expected this to be hoppier given the name, and was pleasantly surprised that the honey-like malts stole the show. This is a beer I didn't know I needed. Sierra Nevada is knocking it out of the park in 2015 with both Nooner and Beer Camp Hoppy Lager. Now to try Hop Hunter IPA."

"Pours a clear deep gold producing 3++ fingers of foamy, somewhat lasting, white head that recedes to a small island of surface cap leaving webs & streaks of lace. Aroma is grainy bread, pale & biscuit malts, lager yeast, with lemon, grass & floral hints in terms of hops; some latent grapefruit & pine. Taste is sweet pale malt, bready, grain, biscuit & caramel with citrus, pine, grass, hops; lager yeast & a little honey. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, with a little prickle throughout, silky & creamy with a tongue coating bitterness & only slightly drying in the finish but becoming more so in the aftertaste. An interesting mixture of hops & yeast."
"Hoppy Bud Light.  Absolute garbage."
"Lots going on here. Sweet, hoppy, citrus notes on a cracker. I like it the closer I get to the bottom of the glass."
"This is really good, love the mixed style here.  Hopefully it becomes more than a single season beer."
"Overall, a pretty good lager and worth getting again. The beer is fairly drinkable, but is better suited for warmer weather."
"Well, I know now. And I'm definitely interested in exploring more beers like this. The light color says lager, and the smell doesn't suggest ample hops. But, as promised by the name, it's nicely hopped. It goes down easily. Not loving the finish. But it's still tasty. Certainly worth trying."

"I admittedly did not have real high expectations for this when I grabbed a single to try it out. I promptly went back for a 6-pack the next day. Just an extremely solid all-around beer that drinks smooth like a lager, but packs big hop flavors--without the extreme bitterness. I really hope this finds its way into year-round production because this feels like an ideal summer beer."

"Nose is quite hop forward with notes of citrus and peppery spice.  Touch of pils malt profile is apparent after the cap settles but is quickly returned to the secondary with a little agitation of the glass.  Hop spice and a moderate sweetness coexist in the flavor department.  Finishes with a flash or tangelo of sorts and then a linger of spice on the palate.  Feel is pleasant and clean with just a hint of bitterness but a more prevalant chalky spice feel.   Hoppy enough to crowd out any niceties expected from a lager per se."
"Overall 4.0: Excellent beer.  I had a few favorites from the ""Beer Camp"" experiment and this was one of them.  Glad to see it back and I highly recommend it."
"O: A very nice and drinkable IPL that definitely focuses on the hops. The malt provides a nice backing, while still allowing the hops the shine. Definitely worth checking out, as it is a bit different than the Electric Ray that they put out with Ballast Point"

"Pours orange and golden with a slight haze and a creamy head of white foam.  Nose is very citrusy.  Has plenty of bright peel and  tangy fruit on it.  It's got an earthiness to the nose and a bit of spice. There's touch of some kind of fruit rind, and a bit of musk.  On the nose the malt seems neutral and not very sweet. In the drink he malt is  crackery and soft.  The fruit flavor and hop bitter never comes up to IPA strength and the earhty softness of the beer keeps the palate from getting fatigued by either the alcohol or the hops.  The mouthfeel is creamy and medium.  It's darn good.  I like it because it's mild on the hops and they seem to blend in so well in this beer.  More breaddy than bitter in the finish without too much sweetness.  This one is pretty easy to drink and either I am getting used to the style or I really did like this one."

I don't go after SN Celebration much anymore -- but this could take its place in the rotation."

"they must have really liked this one a lot to put it out on is own, usually these are in a mixed box, so somebody was stoked on it. i liked it quite well actually, it is as advertised, very hoppy, which i think helps me get past the general blandness of the malt profile on it. the hops are really robust and fresh and citrusy, a cool fit for a style that just doesnt usually see enough hops. beer is super light in color, but quite strong for what it is. you can really feel the buzz after a bunch of this. i like the beer camp series, and hope to see more of them this year. curious sweetness in here is a little out of place for me, but big carbonation helps keep it light enough. not amazing, but pretty good, i would definitely drink this again. seems more like a summer thing to me than a winter one though."

Definitely will revisit this beer for an easy drinking, hoppy, flavorful option.

A bit of German feel meets soft hop notes.  Enters the mouth with a champagne like feel.  Hops add a second level of nice bitter dryness to the backside of the palate.  Nicely clean on the finish and super refreshing and drinkable.  A solid brew."

"As a Resident of Chico, I feel blessed to have such a phenomenal brewery within walking distance, but I feel like this one falls short of their comparable Ballast Point collaboration. Where the Beer Camp brew was slightly sharper, and brighter, this seems light IPL with the volume turned down. Maltier, with a sufficiently satisfying mouthfeel. Still delicious, just didn't meet my high expectations when compared to ""Electric Ray."""

Straw and bread dough. Taste piney most of all with some citrus notes mixed in. A nice extra bitterness is perfect. This is highly drinkable and would be nice if it wasn't a one time thing."

"was pleasantly surprised by how much i enjoyed this, smooth, balanced. citrus and light fruit upfront balanced by smooth malt in the background. finishes very clean."

"The Verdict: Good beer. Well balanced with plenty of flavor."
"This beer is exactly what you would expect, having had a couple hoppy lagers before.  It's more subdued then a Hoponius or Citra Mantra, which is good.  The crisp mouthfeel is there, but not quite as clean as I would like.  Drinks like a 5%er.  Quite easy to overdo it on this one."

"Overall:  A true Imperial Pilsner bordering on Helles/Maibock territory.  I am amazed at what a prominent role the robust malts play in this beer.  Very delicious."

"I loved this beer. I'm a big fan on IPAs and was recommended to try this beer. Nice and hoppy, but not over powering. The aroma consisted largely of hops. I would drink this beer all day. Great work by Sierra Nevada!"
"Clear body was golden in color, and had a lively enough carbonation to form a craggy, two finger thick, head.  The smell of the beer was very citric, evoking mostly grapefruit.  The taste was clear, crisp, and smooth, like a lager should be, but unlike a typical lager, there was a citric American hop presence mid palette onward.  The bitterness was not that strong up front, but as the beer lingered on the tongue, it became more and more apparent.  Very soft feel, and very well hidden alcohol made this a classy, yet approachable offering.  Sierra Nevada just keep up to their usual standards of excellence here."

"Really interesting take on a IPL.  Similar but boozier than the Nooner Pilsner but really good.  Very piney and flavorful.  The lager qualities shine through though.  Very aggressive for a spring seasonal but would love this to be year round."

"well done"
"Overall this is a big beer and reminds me a good deal of SNs Torpedo IPA flavor wise. The 7% abv is slightly tasted but not intrusive. An excellent beer and well recommended. My bottle was barely a month old."

"Pours and looks like a lager. Aroma is like a lager(Bud Lite?) except it has the fine additional aroma of hops. Taste is slightly like a lager but with a big bitter dose of hops, nice. Some citrus and overall, a great balanced lager, bold and enjoyable. Hardly even notice the 7% ABV.."

"Another enjoyable offering from Sierra Nevada. Has a pleasant skunky aroma and flavor going on that I actually kind of like. If I didn't know better, I suspect it's on purpose. I like this beer . . . I always feel obligated to buy S.N. wth good reason."
""

"Clear, gorgeous golden hue with a 1/2 finger of white head that quickly disappeared. Pretty big aromas. Lemon and lemon zest, a bit of a floral note, and the ubiquitous SN clean smell (hard to explain, but you know what I mean). A bit different from some of their other hoppy beers, as there is a bit of a yeasty note there too. Smooth mid-palate of smooth malt. Bitter on the end. Nice lemony/citrusy flavors as well. Balanced, if a bit on the bitter side. Really clean and refreshing. Crisp. My only real complaint is the timing. This would be the definition of a  July/August lawnmower beer for me. Don't think I'll hold on to any quite that long, though Sierra holds up pretty well."
"Abbreviated review: Has a really strange taste to it, perhaps a tainted bottle."
"Flavor is clean and lagery, with muted citrus and biscuity malt. Finish is piney and fairly bitter."

"Beer Camp is designed to introduce us to different and odd mixtures of beer styles and they have done a very good job with this."
"This tastes just like Hoponious Union with a smidge less something (in the hops?) and a bit more malty sweetness.  In other words, its really good.  The hops are large and mighty and, bam, so is the maltiness.  The finish is really clean.  HU is a beer I can't chug, but this for some reason I could guzzle.  If you can't get Hoponious, enjoy this while it lasts.  Its a winner!  Big time."

"Great deal for $8.99 a sixer (lowest priced craft beer in store).  Looks great in glass with lots of body carbonation and 2 finger head and bright orange/clear body.  Smell is kinda weird.  Soapy?  Well at least that is a clean smell albeit not a beer smell.  Taste is really dialed in nicely.  Smooth, smooth, smooth and creamy with a sweetness that fades to crispness.  Minimal aftertaste.  Usually I have never been a fan of higher octane pilsners, but this one defintely seems to work for me."

"Drinking a spring seasonal in January...go figure.Pours into a becker a clear medium golden with a thick bone white head that leaves multiple broken rings of lace as it settles.a good burst of leafy/minty hops with a citric component,just very green.Not as sweet as I was expecting on the palate,leafy and citrusy hops with a light shot of sweet alcohol and dough,another shot of sharpness from the hops into the finish.I really like this hoppy lager,I could come back to this often."
"Feel: medium body; crisp, medium-high carbonation; fairly dry finish."
""
"Just like it sounds. I enjoyed it a lot. Good hop flavor. Get it while you can, limited release."
"Edit: Tried a second bottle because the first didn't leave me with a good impression. Served at a warmer temperature the off-flavors were much less prominent and the hops were able to shine through. Taste rating increased from 3 to 3.25. Still would not consider 'good' compared to other readily available alternatives."
"First Beer Camp I have tried, really enjoyed looking forward to the Hop Hunter."

"Solid beer; what I would expect from a beer called a hoppy lager."
""
"Getting more traditional pilsner than ipa. Nothing special but it's a decent everyday drinking beer."
""
"Overall - A good brew, though personally it's not quite doing it for me. Maybe it's just a bit too grainy for my liking. Perhaps it'd be best for me to drink it fast and not take my time by putting it under a 'review microscope'. I enjoyed the others from the 6-pack considerably more. Regardless, looks like a one-off release, so it's unlikely I'll be drinking it again."
"Great job, this is a hopped up lager but not like Humulus lager or other danky lagers that taste like IPA's.  If you enjoy crisp beer give this a try."

"O - this would be a superb spring offering if it were indeed early April, but while this does say spring seasonal 2015, it was brewed in December and arrived first week of January. Oh yea.. the predictions.. still a darn good hopped up lager. Worth a go for certain. Sierra Nevada Beer Camp? Yes please. Ballast Point at this beer camp concocting some sort of hoppy lager? Pour me at glass!"
"(One aside, THANK YOU whoever it was at Sierra Nevada that managed to beat the ""Everything hoppy is an India X"" It must have taken a pretty strong minded individual to subdue the marketing wonks at the brewery and call it just what it is, a Hoppy Lager. Now if we could just get everyone else on board maybe ""India pale lager"" will just die it's deserved death followed by ""Black IPA"" too."
"This looks clean and crisp. Smell is of faint floral and citrus hops. I haven't had too many lagers, ( I do love Great Lakes Dortmunder though) but I have had quite a few IPAs and I think this is a solid brew. It's crisp and refreshing like a lager, but it has a hop bite of an IPA. It's well balanced with mainly floral hops and hints of pine and citrus hops all over a nice malt backbone. I think this beer nails the style. It's dangerously drinkable and I'd love to throw back a sixer by the pool."
"This poured really light, so I was thinking here is another S$#@y lager but is was really good just the right amount of hops to keep me drinking this one."
"I have liked every beer I have tried from Sierra Nevada, but this one I just couldn't finish. Whatever hops were used, one of them I didn't like at all. It seemed kind of dank, almost skunky. My friend liked it, so I'm sure it's just me, but I wanted to give my rating anyhow. Won't try again."

"O: refreshing; the dry finish makes you want another sip;"

"Underrated for sure, might have slightly tweaked this seasonal batch from original one. Reviews seem much higher"

"Crystal clear, shining gold color with a substantial head of off-white froth that lasts for quite awhile.  Peppery, leafy, oily hop aroma with floral, peach, grassy, and cracker-like notes.  Clean herbal, spicy hop bitterness on a subtle pale malt sweetness.  Orange blossoms and honey.  Medium bodied and somewhat silky feeling with fine, lively carbonation that compliments the hoppiness well.  The result is similar to some of the Harvest series beers from this year.  A quality strong lager that avoids any overbearing sweetness.   Nicely done."

"I honestly don't think I have a great palate and have a difficult time identifying some of the flavors I find in beer. On the other hand, I seem to have quite a gift for comparing similar beers. This one hit me about an hour after I tried it. ""Founders, All Day IPA."" (which I have not had since last summer) I know one is an Ale and the other a Lager but try a taste test a see if I nailed it or not."

"I was pleasantly surprised by this beer. It's definitely different than any other beer out these so it's mostly a matter of preference. Pours crystal clear as a lager should be, but without much head. Smells just like a fresh noble hop. It's magical. Light and crisp mouthfeel. Tastes like a lager, but with more noble hops. Not much added bitterness which is great."

"Well after reading about beer camp, beer camp, beer camp,  I stroll the aisles of the local big box and low and behold, Beer Camp!  Let's give it a whirl.  Popping the topn I get a piney, citrusy waft of hops.  On the pour into the trusty SAPP that I believe is really only 14oz, I get a bright yellow brew with a yellow tinged big bubble head that stands strong and laces as is slowly recedes.  On the taste this brew has a balanced yet complex flavor that bounces between a dandelion bitterness and a tarty sweet maltiness.  As it states on the bottler it is indeed crispy throughout and leaves a slightly bitter sticky aftertaste leaving one yearning for more.  Another keeper from SNB that never fails to please.  Notice that they now brew in Mills River, NC, good to know as it makes SN even more accessible."
"Taste: Very well-hopped, yet light in body (as a lager). There’s a swell of bitter citrus hops up front, followed by a mellow and malty finish to round things off. A superlative IPL, and another winner from Sierra Nevada, who it seems can do no wrong."

"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, bottled on 12/22/2014. Pours slightly hazy bright golden color with a 1-2 finger dense and rocky off white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice dense soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of lemon, lime, grapefruit, orange zest, pineapple, melon, light pine, herbal, floral, grass, cracker, biscuit, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good complexity of bright citrus/tropical hops and moderate pale malt balance; with good strength. Taste of big lemon, lime, grapefruit, orange zest, pineapple, melon, light pine, herbal, floral, grass, cracker, biscuit, and floral/grassy earthiness. Fair amount of pine/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, lime, grapefruit, orange zest, pineapple, melon, light pine, cracker, biscuit, and herbal/floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Outstanding complexity and balance of bright citrus/tropical hops and moderate pale malt sweetness; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding imperial pilsner style. All around awesome complexity and balance of bright citrus/tropical hops and moderate pale malt sweetness; and very smooth and crisp to drink for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."

"Nice change of pace from all of the heavy winter brews out right now.  This version is definitely more balanced and better than the initial summer premiere."
""

"Just a great surprise, especially after not being overwhelmed by their contribution to the 12 pack this summer.  A pleasant, if not overwhelming hop bomb esque aroma, but bolstered by a great--I guess I have to go with ""mouthfeel"". a fullness that's hard to describe, for me anyway.  Delicious"

""

"Wow what a crisp lager this one is. Clear straw color, one finger foam with nice lacing holding on thruout the session. Very citrusy with hop taste and lager crispness coming thru at different times. Little high in the ABV dept but very well hidden. Will buy again."

"Fruity nose, crisp and clean lager, very drinkable!"
""
"This is easy to drink and full of flavor. You get the best of both worlds. You get great tropical fruit notes, along with the bready/corn malt feel from a pilsner."
"Overall: A really good take on the India Pale Lager style. Big ripe and juicy mix of hops upfront with a very nice Pils malt backing."
"Re-factored Electric Ray, reduced abv and ibus... Pours a clear gold, one finger thick fluffy white head, spray of lace on the glass. Smell: spicy up front with grapefruit peel, semi-sweet and floral, lightly resinous and biscuity. No oomph. Taste: nectarine, juice orange, grapefruit peel, resinous and spicy into the finish. Fluffy feel midsip into a crisp spicy and nectarine peel finish. Pretty nice, not quite Electric Ray which was one of the better beer camp across america offerings."

"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and I thought it was a nice example of a Hoppy lager, I don't find it to be  a standout example of the style, but as far as Hoppy Lagers go it's pretty true to style and I thought the creamy aspect was a nice and slightly unique touch.  This beer had nice drinkability, it was smooth, fairly crisp, pretty creamy, not too filling and the taste did an ok job at holding my attention, I wouldn't have any trouble drinking a couple of these, especially in the summertime, but anymore than that and I know I would start to get bored with it.  What I like the most about this beer was the balance between the malts and the hops, it was just where I want it to be for a Hoppy Lager.  What I like the least about this beer was the hop profile, it was ok, but it started to wear on  me after a little while and I think they could make it a little more brighter and interesting.  I might buy this beer again when I'm in the mood for the style and i for sure wouldn't turn one down.  I would recommend it if you like the style, but I don't think it's a stand out example of the style.  All in all I liked this beer, but I didn't love it, I think with a little work on the hop profile this could be a very nice hoppy lager and i think they are mostly on the right track when it comes to the style.  It's not my favorite Sierra Nevada beer and I would say it's above average for the style.  Nice job guys, this was a solid Hoppy lager, keep up the solid work."

"Decent hoppy lager not over powering on the hops"

""
"Final Thoughts: I like this one as a one-off beer. It was a nice proof of concept but I wouldn't seek it out past the first six-pack. Would I drink it again? Maybe."

"Overall: A well-executed hop forward lager. I'm enjoying the tropical fruit flavors and aromas present in the beer. Slightly more drinkable than the original recipe (the ""electric ray"" from beer camp across america). I'm looking forward to seeing this in 6 packs. 4.5"
