"O-For a style I am not fond of, I though this was a good beer."

"22oz. bottle served in a tulip.  Best by 11/2014 indicated on the bottleneck.  Pours a slightly hazy, orange-gold with a frothy, 1/2 inch bright white head.  Nose expresses pilsner malts and light, fruit esters.  Taste consistent with nose with addition of some noble hops bittering, a hint of pine and a slight medicinal quality at the finish.  Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with slight oiliness to the texture and a crisp carbonation.  A decent brew - body is not too malty; however, the lingering medicinal bitterness in the flavor profile is a bit much."

"Overall very good but not smutty's best beer."
"O: On the whole, this is a solidly made, well thought out beer. Never overpowering and fairly refreshing."

"Overall: refreshing beer that is well balanced and hits the spot on the flavor profile. Easy drinking beer."

"Taste follows the nose with sweet orange and bitter pine dominating. There is a slight biscuit malt backbone that can almost stand up and be recognized. A very interesting beer."

"The beer pours a paler, straw yellow with golden highlights, forming a lovely, eggshell white head above the beer with nice lasting power. When splashed against the sides of the glass, the beer leaves thin, sheet-like strands of lacing on the glass, reminiscent of Smutty’s Farmhouse Ale. In body, the beer is spotlessly clean and clear, with just a touch of haze. On the nose, the beer smells deliciously spicy, with a nice citrus/white grape character balancing out the spicy hops. Bready malt gives further finesse to the smell, lending it a balanced, Germen-esque twist that separates it from other IPL’s I’ve smelt. This beer has plenty of hops, but they are balanced and deliciously delicate. As it warms, I get a scent of nettles and a cool spring meadow. I like the scent. On the tongue, the beer tastes fruity up front, transitioning into a bready sweetness that is balanced by a healthy, herbal bitter bite that eventually dries out the finish. Slight acidity does begin the sip, and puts a vinous pop to the mouth. In flavor, the beer begins as sweet Riesling, swiftly gaining a bready, nearly rye-like spice that then plunges into grassy citrus with nuances of hay, and a faint kick of pale malt. The spice develops peppery hints, moving from green pepper flesh, to white pepper spice as the beer warms. In the mouth, the beer feels medium bodied, with a crisp-though-heavy mouthfeel and middling carbonation that gives the tongue a nice fluffing, and a slight prickle. When the beer leaves, the tongue is left with a resinous sheen of spittle, while the mouth feels dry and bitter. In all, despite its heavier mouthfeel, the beer goes down bizarrely easy, making it far too easy to drink (I’ve put that to the test…). This is a lovely variation from the IPA’s-with-Lager-Yeast trend that IPL’s have been following as of late, and it actually piques my interest as to continuation of this style. Look at the complexity and subtlety that can be squeezed from milder/non-American hops used in abundance!"

"O - One of the finest things I've had by Smuttynose. I bought this one on a whim, having never heard of their BIG BEER series, and this one sold me on the first sip. Very well balanced and I'd recommend it to anyone. The price is a bit steep, but it's worth it."

"I like most of the beers I have tasted from the brewery- and although it's a good beer, it's not the aroma/taste profile I enjoy drinking."
"O: This beer has a nice amount of hops for an imperial pilsener, which really balance out the malts and makes the mouthfeel seem lighter than it actually is."

"O: A solid IPL with a good balance between the bitterness and fruity notes from the hops and the bready and grainy notes from the malts. Very easy to drink and a great alternative from your typical IPA or pilsner"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I never hesitate to grab these big beers from smuttynose. This one was a touch off but an interesting ride for sure."
"O - A very interesting brew, not what I expected, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. Smutty does a fine job with everything. It helps to get ti fresh."

"Very lightly toasted pale malt start that quickly succumbs to white pepper bite of the hop. Much richer body than most lagers. Other than the flavor it would rival a Doppelbock. Highly carbonated. Not extreme, but definitely better for the hop heads but still a very easy to drink big beer."

"This is an IPL but it seems to have a more pilsener quality to it with those grainy malts, sweetness, and an added bonus of orange and/or citrus with a crisp, clean finish."
"O: I personally enjoyed this beer, but I'm not sure if the average beer geek will get where this is coming from. These days 'IPL' automatically calls Jack's Abby and their Hoponius Union to mind, at least in this market. For good reason too, they basically created the style. This beer is not really a riff off of that approach though. It isn't boldly hoppy in the vein of a west coast IPA. It comes off more as a great big dortmunder lager with some nice supporting tropical hops. But the average beer aficionado still doesn't know much about the dortmunder style either, so marketing it that way wouldn't be any better really. I guess I'm rambling. Bottom line is that this is a good beer."

"Though FrankenLager is indeed a lager at heart, its strength exceedes the normal ranges for such pilsners and its hop character is as experimental as it is refined. All come together to give this golden ale a striking command at both lager brewing and new wave hop usage."
"Best by 11/08/14.Pours into a becker a clear light to medium golden with a fluffy white head that sticks nicely to the sides of the glass as it settles very slowly into a soapy-like mass.Aromas have some real sweetness to them alot like alcohol dipped fruit,a bit of toasted malt thrown in.Sweet honeyed malt flavors with a bit of toasted bread and a good shot of leafy hops in the finish,quite dry and spicy in the finish.Not a citric hop bomb more Euro in nature with it's hop profile,not bad."

" Overall I really love this beer and want them to turn this into a summer staple. First Durty Sick packs and now this jem. Big year for Smuttynose!"
"O-I was pretty excited to try this but I think it didn't really pan out. The first sip wasn't all that fun and even when I became accustomed to the flavor, I still wasn't very impressed. After about half the bomber, it did grow on me a bit; so overall it turned out to be a pretty decent beer."

"I've been slightly into the recent lager rebirth. Jacks Abbey is making some great beer. This Smutty is actually fantastic. Great copper color, lots of puffy white head and lacing. The nose is a little weak as IMO all lagers are. The taste and mouthfeel and pretty solid, lots of citrusy fruit, carbonation and a hint of bitter. Overall, i'm very surprised by how much I like this. It was also brewed about 2 miles from my house at Smutty's new brewery so, Cheers."
""
"This is a great hoppy lager. It's very flavorful without being particularly aggressive or bitter (not that there is anything wrong with aggressively hoppy lagers). It's definitely worth a try. I'll probably buy a bottle or two of this."
"It's Smuttynose and that's a good thing. A bit sweeter than the typical IPL, but it works. Hyper fruity which messes with a bit of the overall drinkability."
