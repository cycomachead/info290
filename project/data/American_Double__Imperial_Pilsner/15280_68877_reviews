"Hard to really know what to say about this one. This is a style that you don't really see a lot of, so who can say what is closest to style guidelines and all. This one strikes me as pretty good. A bit boozy and burning. Spicy edges to it a bit. Thick grain and hearty tones that stay consistent and firm. Even though this is a bit thicker, I find it quite easy and pleasurable to drink. I could deal with more of this. Glad I had a chance to try this one."

"Pours a deep golden color with a healthy, frothy head with a fair amount of haze. Can smell the hops eminating as it is pouring. Extremely floral nose with grapefruit and a touch of sweetness pouring through the odors. Very sweet at first immediately turning to notes of bitterness and malt. All the traditional pilsner flavors are there, but theyâ€™ve taken the best ones and boosted them. Thin mouthfeel with the perfect amount of carbonation. Flavors continue to linger, meld and change for as long as a minute after it goes down the hatch. I really liked this one, but haven't had many imperial pilsners."
"Overall I thought that this was a good beer and a slightly above average Imperial Pilsener. This wasn't a very complex beer, but it did have some nice simple flavors and aromas that were just as they should be and pretty well done. This beer has pretty good drinkability, usually these Imperial Pilseners can be pretty bitter and not that drinkable but with this beer the bitterness is kept in check and I could see myself having two or three of these. What I liked most about this beer was the appearance, it looked really good poured into a Pilsener glass. What I liked least about this beer was the higher amount of carbonation and the fact that they call this an Imperial Pilsener, this beer was more American Pilsener then Imperial Pilsener, it didn't have the high amount of bitterness and hops that I associate with that style. I would buy this beer again when looking for a good Pilsener, but at $2.59 it's a little pricey for what it is. If your a Pilsener fan this beer is worth giving a try but don't expect this beer to be as intense as most Imperial Pilseners. I think this beer held up pretty well and wasn't to affected by the age, but I would still like to try a fresher bottle. Atwater has been hit or miss for me lately and this beer proved to be more hit then miss, all in all it was a solid Pilsener that was pretty smooth and had a good flavor, good job with this beer it's got just about everything that I look for in a American Pilsener."
"Pours a clear pale gold color with a white foam collar and plenty of lacework. Aroma is grassy and piney, with hints of bready malts underneath. Lots of hops and a good level of bitterness, the Atwater take on an Imperial Pilsner tastes alot like an IPA. Citrus, rind, alcohol and malt sweetness all mix pretty well together. Mouthfeel is at a light/medium. Overall, a decent big pilsner, with bright hop character."
"O- Very flavorful considering the ""lower"" alcohol content for the style. Tasty."
"While only my second example of the style, I have to say that this category of our favourite elixir does not exactly blow up my skirt. Tastes essentially like a boozy pils, of dubious quality, with none of the extra backing characteristics capable of hiding such alcohol intransigence."
"Not a bad offering from a brewery that has yet to impress me. This beer adds some more credibility in my mind. Don't be afraid to give this one a shot."
"Overall kinda meh, some off aromas and flavors, not much of a pilsner flavor just some light toasty malts, fairly bitter and kinda overpowers the whole uber pils effect."
"Pours a deep straw semi hazed hue with a bright white head forming thick, fine evenly spread lacing on the sides of my glass. Aroma is quite pleasant with herbal/citrus/grassy hop highlights and some warm biscuit/malt notes arising. Flavor has some caramel and some rough grain notes, keep in mind this is an uber ursa pils whatever that means, Big Bear? Next hops are muddled and the malts have a really serious husk/graininess going on this should be a relatively cleaner style even if it's a double pils. The hops are more of an unrelenting hop pellet bitterness very herbal/earthy in nature, and the malt sweetness does come out a bit more with each sip, no discernable or unrelenting booze on the palate. Mouthfeel is dry finish, a bit fuller in malt body than the average crisp pils but again it's an amped up version. Carbonation really no complaints there, only issue would be a bit of a cloying residual malt aspect that is felt on the palate between sips, overall an interesting beer that I'mm glad I tried I keep trying the Single Batch series even though their standard lineup hasn't really impressed me yet."
"Thin white head that clings to the sides of the glass on a hazy peach colored body. Some flowery nobel hop aroma, but a pretty weak smell overall. The taste, however, doesn't disappoint(assuming you like bitter beers). Uber Ursa has a nice dose of cheek-puckering bitterness. This beer is okay, but it would be a little better with more carbonation and a little less sweetness."
"This is a beer that started out looking and smelling quite nice, but really disappointed in the taste department. I am usually a big fan of imperial pils, but this one just did not measure up. I would definitely not recommend this brew."
