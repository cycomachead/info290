3.6,-1.9,,,,,,"22oz. bottle served in a tulip.  Best by 11/2014 indicated on the bottleneck.  Pours a slightly hazy, orange-gold with a frothy, 1/2 inch bright white head.  Nose expresses pilsner malts and light, fruit esters.  Taste consistent with nose with addition of some noble hops bittering, a hint of pine and a slight medicinal quality at the finish.  Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with slight oiliness to the texture and a crisp carbonation.  A decent brew - body is not too malty; however, the lingering medicinal bitterness in the flavor profile is a bit much.","Jwale73","Aug 30, 2014"

3.95,7.6,4.25,4.25,3.75,3.75,4,"The beer pours a paler, straw yellow with golden highlights, forming a lovely, eggshell white head above the beer with nice lasting power. When splashed against the sides of the glass, the beer leaves thin, sheet-like strands of lacing on the glass, reminiscent of Smutty’s Farmhouse Ale. In body, the beer is spotlessly clean and clear, with just a touch of haze. On the nose, the beer smells deliciously spicy, with a nice citrus/white grape character balancing out the spicy hops. Bready malt gives further finesse to the smell, lending it a balanced, Germen-esque twist that separates it from other IPL’s I’ve smelt. This beer has plenty of hops, but they are balanced and deliciously delicate. As it warms, I get a scent of nettles and a cool spring meadow. I like the scent. On the tongue, the beer tastes fruity up front, transitioning into a bready sweetness that is balanced by a healthy, herbal bitter bite that eventually dries out the finish. Slight acidity does begin the sip, and puts a vinous pop to the mouth. In flavor, the beer begins as sweet Riesling, swiftly gaining a bready, nearly rye-like spice that then plunges into grassy citrus with nuances of hay, and a faint kick of pale malt. The spice develops peppery hints, moving from green pepper flesh, to white pepper spice as the beer warms. In the mouth, the beer feels medium bodied, with a crisp-though-heavy mouthfeel and middling carbonation that gives the tongue a nice fluffing, and a slight prickle. When the beer leaves, the tongue is left with a resinous sheen of spittle, while the mouth feels dry and bitter. In all, despite its heavier mouthfeel, the beer goes down bizarrely easy, making it far too easy to drink (I’ve put that to the test…). This is a lovely variation from the IPA’s-with-Lager-Yeast trend that IPL’s have been following as of late, and it actually piques my interest as to continuation of this style. Look at the complexity and subtlety that can be squeezed from milder/non-American hops used in abundance!","Maxwell","Jul 09, 2014"

3.82,4.1,4,3.75,3.75,4.25,3.75,"O: I personally enjoyed this beer, but I'm not sure if the average beer geek will get where this is coming from. These days 'IPL' automatically calls Jack's Abby and their Hoponius Union to mind, at least in this market. For good reason too, they basically created the style. This beer is not really a riff off of that approach though. It isn't boldly hoppy in the vein of a west coast IPA. It comes off more as a great big dortmunder lager with some nice supporting tropical hops. But the average beer aficionado still doesn't know much about the dortmunder style either, so marketing it that way wouldn't be any better really. I guess I'm rambling. Bottom line is that this is a good beer.","ryan1788a5","May 27, 2014"
