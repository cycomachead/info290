4.08,0,4.25,4.25,4,4,4,"In a blind taste test, not sure I could tell this apart from an IIPA, but it does have a bit of a hop-to-malt character with little taste in between. More malt-forward as it warms up, but IMO, it's best consumed cold. I feel like this beer was made to get you drunk on a nice, summer evening with no questions asked. 8.7%, but by the bottom of the bottle, you'll swear it was 11%. Good stuff.","do_ob","Apr 01, 2015"

Overall, a very enjoyable IPL, though not quite up to the standard of others (esp. those from Jack's Abby, which are the obvious gold standard).

The mouthfeel is chewy and oily with incredible balance and drinkability and a smooth, tangy, bittersweet finish.  Overall, this beer really shocked me.

For me, overtly, tropically hoppy beers like Dissenter - whether lager or ale - are pure bliss in a bottle.","biegaman","Oct 27, 2014"

4.25,4.2,,,,,,"Poured a lovely clear golden body with a thin cap of white foam. It looks quite typical for a lager, but very inviting. Scents of pine resin, vegetal, oniony hops, grapefruit peel notes of tropical fruit, and orange flesh and peel. Overall impression of aroma is of a nicely hop forward beer, that is most like an IPA, despite this being an imperial lager. Very nice and appealing. Flavor begins moderately bitter with notes of pine resin, oniony, earthy, vegetal hops and light grapefruit. In the middle, the same flavors continue, but grapefruit becomes more prominent, as do the earthy, vegetal hops. Finish is earthy, vegetal hops, grapefruit peel, pine resin, and a hint of faint alcohol. Aftertaste is pine resin, floral, bitter hops, light sweet Pilsner malt and grapefruit peel. Overall impression of flavor is of a wonderfully hoppy lager that is clean and thus showcases the hops. Very nice. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation and a somewhat resinous, drying mouthfeel. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a wonderful hoppy beer that is easy to drink and pleasant. Overall is an excellent beer that is hoppy in aroma and flavor, with a nice mouthfeel that aids the overall impression. Very nice and highly recommended.","Auraan","Oct 07, 2014"

4.27,4.7,4.25,4,4.5,4,4.25," The taste is very smooth with mild malt that leads to tangy tinge with herbal hop flavor bordering on dank with medium spice and gentle piney almost noble-type flavor with slight lemongrass which leads to sweetened grapefruit and mild orange zest flavor w/ mild pils malt backing up the hops well. There is only a slight grassy/peppery tinge in the finish as the alcohol is low and the malt seems a little sweeter/bitterness in balance as it nears cellar temp with resins giving a dry impression in the finish.  Overall I consider this an excellent India Pale lager with nice amount of alcohol and hop bitterness with nice dry crisp lager quality ..I would glady drink this again for sure!","Slatetank","Beers"

Like each member of the series, the label is alluring, bizarre, and beautiful.  Our first thought on the aroma was that it smelled just like their All Day IPA, but with a touch more sweetness.  But let’s be real, the most surprising thing about this beer is how dang heavy and full-bodied it is.  This, combined with the penetrating piney bitterness of the hops, makes for an intense beer.  All of this makes the drinker sit back on their heels a bit, allowing you time to discuss and pontificate.  We are pleased to have been able to try this offering, and feel it fits well amongst the Founders pedigree.  The aromas and flavors are bold to the last drop, and should appease all but the most obstinate of advocates.","TheBrewo","Sep 21, 2014"

Plenty of carbonation moving throughout the body. Aromas of resinous hops, with a richly sweet grapefruit character, subtle sugary and floral highlights, and a solid toasted backbone. Smells terrific. Flavors are resinous forward, with a blast of pine pitch, bitterness, grapefruit notes, hints of tropical fruits, floral highlights, and a toasted grain backbone once again.  The body is smooth and big, robust, but all the while remaining very drinkable.  The aftertaste is roasty and toasty, with a hops fingerprint all over, including a bitter and resin blend. The finish is smooth and light, with a subtle crispness.  Dangerously easy to drink.","GarthDanielson","Sep 20, 2014"

If they would throw this in 12 oz bottles and sell 4 or 6 packs of it, it would be a staple in my fridge. Pours light golden yellowish with a white head. Aroma is very clean and crisp with some sweet and citric fruitiness of some tangerines and grapefruit, a touch of some apricot,  floral, a little grassy, and a thin underbelly of some cracker. Flavor follows suit. Really enjoy the clean, crisp finish to this. A thinnish medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall love this beer even if I won't spend the $12 for a 750 ml bottle of it. Any time I see it on tap, though, I will continue to order it.","denver10","0"

This would probably work better as a lower abv IPL to reduce he malt and showcase the hops more.  Definitely glad I tried as this is a style I love seeing more of, but I probably wouldn't get this again (this year at least). However, If it were in a 12oz 4 pack for $12 then I might.

4.05,-0.7,,,,,,"750ml bottle served in a tulip.  Pours a translucent straw gold with a loose, quarter inch, white head that quickly dissipates into a sudsy mass towards the shoulders.  Nose is grassy with a trace of citrus and skunk.  There's also a suggestion of biscuit malts.  Taste consistent with nose - fortunately, the light skunkiness present in the nose is not present in the flavor profile.  Definitely a little more malt forward than a typical IPL; however, not much so.  Citrus, grassiness and biscuit malts coalesces nicely.  There's also a distinct noble hops bittering and a trace of ethanol that lightly lingers between quaffs. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a pleasant, even carbonation and a kiss of oiliness to the texture.  Nothing crazy here, but a solid representation of the style without being too malty.","Jwale73","Beers"

Fits the style of an American Double / Imperial Pilsner. Tastes of slight strawberry, strong citrus, hops, sweet malt, slight pale malt, hint of alcohol, and a hint of pine.

Strong carbonation without being fizzy and doesn't bite at all.  Starts sweet and gradually goes to the appropriate amount of bitterness leading to a nice hoppy dry, and very clean bitter finish.  Balance is perfect and it's CRAZY drinkable.  I was literally disappointed when I emptied this bottle.  If this were sold in six/four packs I would love it.  Nice job Founders!  This is a phenominal beer and an "Imperial IPL" like this holds breweries like Jack's Abby (the best brewery at lagering in my opinion) in check.  This is a great, drinkable beer that I hope isn't a one time brew.  Special thanks to Bin Ends Braintree for saving me a bottle.","AndyAvalanche","Aug 20, 2014"

Pours crystal clear pale golden color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of big tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, lemon zest, apricot, floral, grass, pine, cracker, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great complexity of bright citrus/tropical/pine hops and moderate pale malt balance; with great strength. Taste of big tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, lemon zest, apricot, floral, grass, pine, cracker, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Good amount of earthy pine/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, lemon zest, apricot, pine, cracker, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity of bright citrus/tropical/pine hops and moderate pale malt sweetness; with a nice malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent IPL. All around great complexity and balance of citrus/tropical/pine hops and moderate pale malt sweetness; and very smooth and crisp to drink for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Aug 15, 2014"

Not sure I'd buy this again with cheaper beers tasting a bit similar to this one, but this is still a World Class sort of Imperial IPA -- well, lager -- that deserves your attention.

Taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but with the addition of some pine hops, light floralness and melon. Mouthfee/body is medium, it's smooth and a bit creamy with moderate carbonation.

A clear, golden color, with a huge puff of frothy bone white head--three fingers in the glass at least--which simmered down to a thick layer, and eventually to a small collar, leaving random dabs of lacing on the glass. Lots of fresh fruity hops in the aroma up front, floral, giving way to an obvious bready malt nose, full of lager yeast. No amount of hops could hide the fact that this was a lager. Taste was pretty much full-blown lagertown, bready, yeasty, caramel, the hops bringing in a dull bitterness, and the freshness of the aroma just not carrying through into the taste. Some solventy booze heat in there as well, sensing every bit of the 8.7%ABV. Body was pretty big actually, and on the fuller side of medium, which I didn't much care for, chewy, syrupy, and obviously malt-driven to get that ABV up. Got exponentially worse as the beer sat / came up closer to room temp. This one just didn't do anything for me. Came off like an IPA that was way past its prime.","Rifugium","Aug 08, 2014"

4.21,3.2,4,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,"Overall I thought this was a good beer and I thought it was a very nice example of a hoppy Lager, it did a really great job at showcasing those great fruity hops and the clean lager base seemed to work well with the hop profile and it let the citra hops really shine. This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, clean, crisp, slightly oily, slightly sticky, not too filling and the taste did a good job of holding my attention, I think one glass would be a good amount for me, but I know I wouldn't have a problem drinking a full bottle, but that would be my limit and I think it makes for a nice beer to enjoy on a warm summer evening. What I like the most about this beer was the hop profile, it was very nice and it had all those fruity hop flavors that I love. What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, there isn't anything that I disliked or would change, it's fine just the way it is. I would buy another bottle of this before it's all gone, but I don't think I'll be clearing the shelfs of it especially for $11.49. I would recommend this beer to anyone who likes hoppy Lagers or just hoppy beers a general, I think it's pretty much a must try for all Hop Heads. All in all I was pretty happy with this beer, I was expecting good things since this is a Founders Backstage Release and they delivered a very nice and hoppy Lager. So far I think this is the best hoppy Lager I've had and it's for sure the best Lager of the summer, but it isn't a favorite Founders beer. Great job guys, I really like how the only thing that I can always expect from this series it that's it's going to be a great and unique beer and that's exactly what it was, keep up the hard work guys.","StoutHunter","Aug 04, 2014"

The sweetness was a bit much to start but it eventually came together nicely. Glad they went for a different route for this style than Jack's Abby.","Chico1985","Aug 04, 2014"

We decided that we have been spoiled by Fiddlehead Second Fiddle and that every IPA from here on out is going to be disappointing. Normally we consider Founder's to be among the top brewers in the Country. We still do, however Dissenter was not one of their best products. We would can it. No pun intended.","ricknelson","Aug 04, 2014"

I laugh at those who balked at the idea of Founders making a lager, because they nailed it with this one.","mjshearer1","Aug 02, 2014"

4.03,-1.2,4,4,4,4.25,4,"Its building bitterness is unrelenting as the hops grip the throat tightly and refuses to release. Gaining bitterness sip after sip, its grassy, herbal and woodish spices tighten their grip, weaving in citrus piths, leaf and grass along the way- en route to a piquant alcohol warmth that's indicative of its high strength. Its mild astringency is unavoidable with not malt taste or texture to buffer out the hop and alcohol rougher edges.","BEERchitect","Aug 01, 2014"
