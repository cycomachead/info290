4.11,6.2,3.75,4,4.25,4.25,4,"10% imperial pale lager that pours a slightly hazed orange gold color.  The aroma is of fresh citrus zest, green tea, apricot and honey.  The flavor has more of the intense orange citrus note, substantial bready malt, but bitter.  Alcohol is well hidden for a 10% imperial pils, but it's still there.  Hop flavor is plentiful with semi tropical notes and some herbal elements.  Full bodied, carbonated lager that is damn smooth.  Another winner from Mikkeller, solid hoppy strong lager.","Stinkypuss","Nov 19, 2014"

3.94,1.8,4,4.25,3.75,3.75,4,"330 ml bottle poured into a tulip glass. A cloudy yellow amber color with a reasonable amount of dingy white head and a rather sweet and rich aroma, concentrated pale malts and candied citrus/tropical fruits, orange, papaya, and peach with honey-like and brown sugar overtones and something else a bit more funky, almost like yeasty vitamin tablet. Does feature a power hop flavor that to my reckoning keeps up with that found in Hop Burn High, if anything the lemon, orange, red berry, salad green and camphorous spice flavors are even cleaner here despite the malts contributing ample sweetness. Rather boozy and here and there I get a solvent-like blast, although this does not overly detract from a lingering citrus peel (lime) and spicy hop finish. I do find myself enjoying the aroma more than the flavor per se. Rather thick bodied and carbonation is right where it needs to be, cutting the sweetness to some extent and lifting up the hops. I rather enjoyed this Hop Burn duo. Bold, spicy, rich, boozy beers well worth experiencing at least once.","CalgaryFMC","Jun 08, 2014"
3.28,-15.2,3.75,3.25,3.25,3.75,3,"NOTE: this beer is in no way a pilsner. It's an IPA brewed with lager yeast, and has more in common with those. It is not an imperialized pilsner.","errantnight","May 07, 2014"
3.85,-0.5,4,4,3.75,4,3.75,"A veritable hop tsunami that does a number on your senses. Looks great, while the aroma offers a fantastic smorgasbord of hop notes backed up by malt. The flavour is equally intense but with a leafy, vegetal edge to the bitterness that detracts a little from the experience. Lovely body. A memorable brew, but not one I'd want to drink every day. It made me realise that it is possible to overdo the hops. Nonetheless, an impressive lager that is worth sampling if you really love lupulus.","jazzyjeff13","May 06, 2014"

Not a sessioner by profile or ABV, but definitely different and overall solid.","BKBassist","Jun 03, 2013"

3.95,2.1,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Bottle: Poured a cloudy beige color lager with a large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of dry and citrusy hops is dominant with dry caramel malt base quite discreet. Taste is also dominated by herbal hops notes with quite dry notes and a medium citrusy finish. Body is quite full with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. The description is spot on with hops being the dominant flavour and honestly I could not have known that this was lager if it wasn’t for the label.","Phyl21ca","Oct 14, 2012"

4,3.4,4,4,4,4,4,"One of the strangely more agreeable versions of the style, the grand uptick in hopitude perhaps distracting me from the normal alcohol heat problems that I normally seem so pissy about. Anyways, this is verily a DIPA, but without the big caramel sweetness, for which you apparently have to switch over to the Hop Burn High to experience. I have, and it's a somewhat more full-on affair, I have to say, but one which should take very little away from this particular incarnation, which has much to offer all on its own.","biboergosum","Sep 05, 2012"

3.56,-8,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"O: I'm not sure what all the fuss is about. Sure, this is a rather solid imperial pilsner, but compared to some others (Southern Tier's Krampus, Rogue's Morimoto, Mikkeller's Draft Bear), it is relatively nondescript. I mean the flavors don't really separate for any length of time and there seems to be little integration of malt and hop flavors. All in all, I think what I'm getting at is that there just isn't a ton of depth here. If you're a diehard hophead you'll likely enjoy this lager, but it's not really doing anything for me.","mrfrancis","0"
