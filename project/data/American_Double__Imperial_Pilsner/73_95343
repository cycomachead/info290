Color was a deep-gold (SRM = > 5, < 7) with NE-quality clarity. The Unholy Trio of Midas, Mammon and Croesus did not suddenly show up. Instead, they were already here, just based on the beer's name! They are such punks. Nose had a scent of tropical fruits, especially coconut and papaya. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium. The taste was nothing like the nose, sadly. It was much more bitter, more towards citrus rind and some grass. Not bad, but not what I was expecting. Finish was dry, with some fusel alcohol heat.","woodychandler","Jul 23, 2014"

If there is a continuum of qualities with Commodore Perry at one end and Rye of the Tiger at the other, this IPL would comfortably be placed near the midway point between them. What this beer bears little resemblance to is traditional pilsner--rather, it is another iteration of this brewery's approach to IPAs, that happened to be brewed with lager yeast. The single greatest complaint that can be leveled upon it is the strength of this beer--excessive, considering the qualities present.","beagle75","Jul 29, 2013"

Aromas of grapefruit, lemon zest, pear, apple, grape, floral grass, cracker, bread, honey, light pine, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of hop, yeast, and malt notes; with good strength. Taste of grapefruit, lemon zest, pear, apple, floral, grass, cracker, bread, honey, pine, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, light fruits, floral, grass, cracker, bread, pine, honey, and earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of hop, malt, and yeast flavors; with good sweetness/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Overall this is a very nice India pale lager.

4.08,6.5,4,4,4,4.25,4.25,"Appearance is the gold hue you'd expect from a German lager. The aroma is unique, plenty of hops but with an almost sugary sweetness. The flavor is similar, a full-bodied hit of complex hops followed by a sweet aftertaste reminiscent of Munich lager (which, oddly enough, is among the most subtly hopped lagers out there). The mouthfeel is rich but not at all heavy, making this a complex but drinkable beer. I've tried Sam Adams IPL and Victory's Prima Pils but have never tasted anything that so purely melded the flavors of an IPA over a refreshing lager base. An ambitious experiment pulled off flawlessly.","HeightsEats","Jun 25, 2013"
