"My first gander into Imperial Pilsners. At 11% this beer should be boozy, but it's not. The mouthfeel is where this beer excels, and it where it wanes is its lack of hop character. Definitely a nice sipper, a little sweet for my current palate, but the lingering honey, orange, and cream soda notes are well executed. I've never tried the original -OBP, so I can't compare it."

"Ironically if this were called a wheatwine it would be rated probably alot higher and no one would bat an eye. Interesting aroma, hints of chemical and natural complexity, I really can't tell which. The flavor is golden when it comes to malt, with nothing else to balance and the honey just about crowns it. I just can't get past the fact that this is a pilsner and it 180s nearly everything I has hopes for when I cracked it."

"Overall- It's not bold for an 11% brew, and I'd certainly recommend having this as the first beer of the night, as the light toasty-honey-nougat flavor would be easy to lose and otherwise it's fairly plain. I'd have a second if I'd bought more than the one bottle... and stop there, this could be dangerous. I'm not sure how the brewers pulled this one off, but bravo- this could have easily been a sticky, sweet, boozy mess and it comes off as a pleasant well-balanced sipper. Even without any other double-honey 10%+ lagers to compare this to, I feel pretty strongly that this one would be significantly better than average."
"O - I received this beer as an extra in a trade and wasn't sure what to expect from this ""Pilsner."" It is brewed with honey, so I knew it would be sweet. The smell was nauseating, but the flavor was acceptable. Good fruit flavors and no sign of the 11% alcohol. I am glad it wasn't a bomber, because I was growing tired of it by the end of the 12 oz. pour. To be fair, it wasn't the worst beer I have tried and I always appreciate unique and experimental brews. I don't endorse this beer fully, but if you tend to like beers with some wine or cider characteristics, give it a try."

"This is a pretty interesting and exciting experiment. I kinda like it, and kinda don't. It's really hard to explain. I think 12 ounces is just too much (at least for me). The proper serving would be 3 or 4 ounces after dinner. I really think it should be tried though, it is a very creative and different beer."

"Overall: My wife liked it much more than I, so was happy to share. It's good, just a bit too sweet for my tastes."

"Overall: tasty and pleasant, but again nothing grand."
"O: Dumped down the drain after taking two sips. Interesting for sure, good if you want a quick buzz at 11%, but I couldn't drink it."

"Orange Blossom Pilsner Squared isn’t very good. It’s okay at best. Frankly, the orange and honey flavors just don’t work well with the Pilsner malt base. It’s also too big and too boozy. 11% abv is far too much for this one. As a novelty, I guess it’s interesting and perhaps worth a try. Stick with a single bottle if you can."
"Not a bad beer. Definitely can't tell it is 11% alcohol by the taste. I could see this working as a pairing with food."
"A sipper, and fairly pleasant. Sweet and good for dessert."
"I'm curious as to the point of this beer. The viscosity and alcohol completely ruin any chance of pilsner crispness and refreshing qualities. Not everything works if you ""Imperialize"" it, and this is a shining example."
"Why is this a Herbed/Spiced brew? American Strong Ale, all the way. It tastes like a super-powered Cream Ale. The beer is amber-orange, and has a very small wisp of white suds atop. The nose is slightly sweet with a good amount of grainy and spicy notes. The flavor is fairly boozy, though it is not unexpected given the ABV, and is lightly toasty and caramelized. It is not great but it is not bad at all. It is worth noting that the orange blossom honey is not noted."
"The only aroma suggesting this is a beer is a hint of graininess. Otherwise, it smells remarkably like a creamsickle. Thickish, syrupy and EXCRUCIATINGLY sweet. Some citric hops and husky grain flounder in a sea of marshmellow fluff and orange hard candy. I realize the honey the feature ingredient here, but this is overkill. At home it would have been a drainpour; at the bar, I left 2/3 of it untouched. Strong recommendation to avoid (unless you're a fan of underattenuated messes like Creme Brulee and Dark Lord; in that case, this may be a treat for you)."
"Overall - Wow, my first real drainpour. Ever. Seriously, I've powered through some pretty bad homebrews in my day, but my God, this is the worst beer I have had in a long time. The flavors were cheap and medicinal, the alcohol was certainly not well hidden, and it was overall just a painful experience. I want to wash it off my tongue with BMC."
"Overall a really clean and crisp beer with some potent flavor that really impresses the palate while remaining relatively calm. Im pretty impressed."
"Overall, a good, rich flavor that seems to work even at colder temperatures. I'd recommend having one or two."
"D: This goes down too easily and is most similar to a mild-flavored and weaker bodied wheatwine."
"Had this served from a bottle at Fifty brews in Orlando. Must say I prefer the original much more. This beer smells amazing but its taste is over the top. It feels syrupy in the mouth and is beyond sweet. It almost tastes like a mead not a beer. Overall this would not be a choice as despite the high alcohol content the level of sweetness is just too much."
"This 'pilsner' pours a deep golden hue with a tinge of red. No head no lacing. The smell is slightly sweet but mostly of booze. This beer has a strong flavor, mostly honey and alcohol. There is a slight taste of orange. Sadly, this beer has potential but doesn't deliver, it just gets you drunk and quick. Great to taste but you can only really have one... I made the mistake drank the four pak and had a major hangover. Try it..."
"Pretty interesting wildcard of a beer. It describes itself as a pilsner but there isn't really any pilsner to it. It's more similar to an imperial pale ale sans hops. Great beer, too strong to drink a lot of but totally worth trying."
"Decent but not sure if I can produce enough insulin to have another anytime soon."
"mobile review"
"A solid beer; I've never had anything quite like it, and I've had a lot of different beers. Definitely worth trying."
"I think they achieved what they were going for here, i'm just not sure how much I like it. The orange blossom honey comes across in a really clean way. Not a whole lot going on besides that. The alcohol is hidden in a creepy way because it's so light tasting. The body is a little syrupy and the carbonation low, which gives away the alcohol more than the taste. It's what I would call ""a bang for your buck beer"". Not great but if you don't really like the taste of craft beer and you want a cheap buzz, look no further."
"D: At first the alcohol is hidden, but a little farther into the beer will relieve how little drinkability this has."
"Drinkability: Decent enough for a dose. For me, the boost of carbonation saves this one, keeping what could be an overly sweet, cloying beverage about as drinkable as a simple, 11% ABV, honey-basted brew can be."
"Not sure where they were trying to go with this one, but it did not work well for me."
"A very good beer. And while it's not re-inventing the wheel with its flavor pallet, it's definitely one to still be reckoned with."
"On a side note I really enjoy the label art of the jacked and tan honey bee."
"Clear golden amber hue. Not much head to speak of. Honey dominates the smell. There's also a very faint orange, but really that's about the only scents that can be detected. You have to really sift through the honey to get to the other flavors. Sweet orange with hints of clove and caramel malts. You do get a sense of the alcohol towards the finish. But honey is what you are ultimately left with. Has a sticky somewhat syrupy feel. I didn't care for this after the first couple drinks, but it did grow on me. A little too sweet to drink very often, but it was a nice change of pace."
"TCB Orange Blossom Pilsner Squared has a few more positives than negatives... as beer. Thomas Creek Brewery should blow the doors off the joint and give serious consideration to OBP to the fifth power. That just might be some seriously bitchin' orange-honey liqueur."
"As to drinkability, I enjoyed it quite well. One serving, however, was my limit. It's fairly unique though, and interesting. So I guess the question is, would I buy more of these? Yes, I think so. It's charming in a way... a bit of a sipper, but pretty rich and entertaining."
"Bottle courtesy of DCHMELA- Deep orange pour with a frothy bleached white head. The nose is of orange rind and malts, candy sugars and honey. Tastes of sweet orange peel and syrupy sweet malts, straw and lots of honey. This one is all about the sweet orange flavours. I preferred this when it was really cold, as it becomes almost syrupy as it warms. Good in small doses. Thanks for the bottle Dave!"
"d: Thanks to tpd975 for this via my Nobody wants to see a beer geek naked BIF. This is pretty sweet, so even a 12oz bottle is suitable for splitting. I've never had anything quite like this, though it does remind me a bit of Troegs Scratch #10, the anise triple. Unique and worth trying, if you're down with OBP."
"Now that I think about it, maybe I should not be surprised that this Florida lager resembled a Belgian Ale so much. The yeast, a defining quality of many Belgian beers, would be totally different but one key similarity they share the addition of a non-malt sugar source for the yeast to feed on. Many Belgian beers add brewers sugars, this lager used fresh honey, so I can see how the resulting taste (after fermentation) might be similar"
"Tasted just like honey, almost too swee,t bordered on cloying, but it pulled it off, some orange in the back ground. Way better beer than i was expecting it to be."
"A Cloudy orange color with a thin white head,light carbonation,a little spotty lacing. Aroma is of sweet honey,malt and floral hops.Flavor is very sweet,fruity, sugary apples,oranges,and some thick caramel malt,thick heavy body ,with a sticky mouthfeel, slightly alcoholic in the finish. It took me a litte bit to warm up to this,a good brew and a fun try but a little too sweet for me,or to be very sessionable."
" Overall drinkability is rather poor, due to the taste. I'm glad i only purchased one single twelve ounce bottle. This will probably be a drainpour, joining the ranks of Bell's Cherry Stout."
"All in all, started off too intense and quickly mellowed into an excellent brew."
"The drink is silky-smooth and on the full side of medium-bodied. The brew is lightly-carbonated, and one bottle is more than plenty for me."
"The taste is surprisingly good at first, with juicy notes of melon flesh, sweet clover honey, caramel, and a kiss of German hops. However, the sweetness lingers along the back of the palate for too long, and takes on somewhat of an artificial saccharin note. Alcohol is very well-hidden. Great mouthfeel, too, with a crisp & bubbly medium body that borders on thick, but never becomes too syrupy or viscous. All in all, a pleasant surprise from a (quite honestly) mediocre brewery. I'd recommend this beer and probably have it again, although I can't really see myself wanting another anytime soon."
"It's probably not possible two drink more than two of these. Either the sweetness will do you in, or the booze will. At 11%, this is definitely a sipper."
"Had this one on-tap recently and enjoyed it, 12oz bottle into a Lucifer tulip, pours a crisp bubbly orange with a thin head. Aroma is alcohol, slight orange peel spice and a touch of burnt caramel. The taste is an interestingly strong blend of malts and orange spice with a kick of puckering bitter hops, the sad thing, however, is they don't seem to get along that well, especially swimming in all that alcohol. The beer is certainly heavy with a strong alcohol kick. This is one beer that was much better on draft."
"D- For the alcohol, this is pretty light. The sweetness is the only thing holding this back."
"Overall, I'm impressed. It's amazing that a beer this light and subtle could keep such a high abv in check."
"D 3.5 - A mega honey brew, worth a try, but not very session-able. Sip-able and share-able, but tough to do more than one. Interesting for sure to learn what mega honey does for brew recipes!"
"OBP2 Pours a crystal clear orange into my delirium tremens snifter. A slight off white head crackles and dissipates to a thin layer in minutes. At 11% this is not suprising. Sweet and malty in the nose with hints of honey. The flavor is sweet with a flash of alcohol which is warming on the tongue. There's a good amount of caramel malt in the flavor profile. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a decent amount of carbonation. All in all this seems to be a bit simplicitic. It is tasty, but there is nothing making me say wow. For 11% I want more flavor."
"Too sweet to drink much, but tasty on its own"
"Other comments: Pretty solid brew, though it does get a bit cloying after about half a glass and that was even when sharing a 12 oz. bottle with someone else!"
"This is not a commonly seen brew around here in Charlotte NC, I lucked out at the always impressive common market and had this sweet thing. This is miles away from the original orange blossom pilsner. It is darker hew in color and has a nice orange tinted white head. It has a nice citris, crisp smell with hints of honey and sweet malts. This beer taste very sweet with honey and malt as oppossed to the original which is leaning more in the fruit (orange) direction. There is some orange fruit in the flavor but the honey really dominates. This beer really reminds myself and others who had it with me, of a mead. It is strong in alcohol but the flavor really makes this heafty beer an easy drinker. I would highly recommend it to anyone, especially those who want to try high alcohol beers but are hesitant because of the overbearing tastes usually associated with them."
"12 oz bottle. Pours a burnt orange with 2 cm foamy off white head that thins out pretty quickly. Aroma of honey and alcohol. Initial flavor of sugar/honey. Flavor balances out slightly by the end, thankfully. Aftertaste is still kinda sugary, but short lived. Medium body, moderate lacing, light carbonation, and obvious alcohol. Overall, worth a try, and as long as its even a little chilled you can get just about anyone to try it."
"Overall- I must say, I am pleasantly surprised. I don't care for the the ""regular"" OBP at all, but I was at Total Wine and Liquor and saw this sitting in a special section of beers. While not brewed here, I still like to think of it as a hometown brewery and I'm always down with trying to support our local breweries. I applaud our boy for making an ""extreme"" beer and I will be picking up another four pack in the future."
"Overall- One of my favorites from this brewery. I have bought several six packs, so it's a nice one to have around all the time."
"Overall- This isn't a bad tasting beer. I had their other OBP and this one is a better beer by far. The overpowering honey taste is just too much for me."
"D: Not bad. They need to hide the alcohol a bit more for this one to live up to its full ability."
"Body is big, sticky, and smooth. The sweetness and strong boozey alcohol limits drinkability, but it does taste good. Definately something to share and sip on."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a golden orange color with an off-white head that possesses pretty decent lacing qualities. The aroma is very sweet with a lot of honey and just a touch of malt and alcohol with not much in the way of hops to note. The taste is very sweet and cloying with a lot of honey flavors. Overall, there is just too much sweet honey flavors, but I guess that was the point of this beer. Just not really my thing, a little too sweet for my taste. Overall, OBP 2 is not a bad beer, but not something I would purchase again."
"OBP 2 pours a hazy orange with a white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. There is a strong, sweet, honey aroma. It does smell like a much more intense version of the original. Sweet and very honey like, a much improved execution over the original, which seemed very light, almost macro like. This has body and full flavor, but if you don't like sweet, this might not be your beer. Pretty good."
"Poured into a pint glass. Dark straw yellow, almost orange color. Not much head, and even less lacing. Strong honey smell and flavor. Smooth mouthfeel. Better than the original OBP. As far as a pilsner go, this isn't. To me, it's more of a braggot. As far as a braggot, it's good. The original OBP is more of a step-up beer for those who want something better than a light macro, but this beer seems to appeal to the beer geek, though, I don't know too many beer geeks that seek an imperial pilsner. All in all, I'm glad I tried the beer, and since braggots and meads are difficult to find in central FL, I'll probably buy some more when I'm in the mood for that style."
"Poured into a snifter. OBP^2 pours a slightly hazy straw yellow with a hint of orange in the color. Nice white head that has a low retention, that leaves the nice halo effect, that eventually leads to decent lacing. Strong Orange Blossom honey aroma with some citrus hints, some biscuity and yeasty aromas as well. Strong honey flavor off the bat, that leads into some citrus flavors. I almost tastes like a watered down mead. Smooth mouthfeel, teases the palate, and has a high carbonation level at first, but mellows out over time. Definitely better than other, lighter version, but it just seems to be the same beer with less water and more honey. At 11 percent, this just makes me ask, why?"
