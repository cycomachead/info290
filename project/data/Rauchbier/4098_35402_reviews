"Drank out of a 1L MaB, but only poured a half liter. The nose is also overwhelming, though the scent itself is mild. HICKORY, HICKORY, HICKORY! Large amounts of lace after a moderate head of off white gobs. Attractive beer. Big white bubbles hang around after the head thins out. Smoked flavor is subdued and mellowed out with a maltiness reminscent of a watered down Old Chub malt profile. Carbonation is light to moderate, but with the smokiness and malt background, its fitting. I don't think my 5L will last until tomorrow...no work, no worries."
"Overall, solid and paired up well with some sausages and sauerkraut. Check it out if there, but wouldn't be the first on my list in their lineup."
"This was a very interesting beer, but I confess to struggling a bit in drinking it, and it is not a style that I would particularly go for."
