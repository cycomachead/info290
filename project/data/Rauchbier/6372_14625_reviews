"Smokey, malty, sweet aroma. Crystal clear deep amber. The smokey flavor lives up to its namesake but is not a nice balance in this beer. The malt flavor and body are too light. It would be a much better fit in a porter with deep roasted malts."

"Overall, this is a brilliant beer! I want one in the summer and spring when I'm grilling--why don't I have some brats with me right now?"

"Pours up to a moderate foam head and leaves bits of foam down the glass. Hazy amber color. Aroma is roasted nuts, biscuit and Munich malts. Flavor is more of the same, although intensity-wise this is reportedly weak for the style. Mouthfeel is light and refreshing, which is also on the low end of style. Overall, I give the beer a 4.5 because here is where I can say screw the style guidelines, I really like this beer."
""
""
"There's a soft smokiness, watery roastiness and touches of malt and nut.The taste is not rich enough, not robust enough for the style. It's still good and tasty but seems to miss the mark."
"O: If I had to introduce someone to a rauchbier, I think this beer would be a good choice because the smoky flavors are subtler and it's lighter in body compared to the standard German beers in this style. Needless to say, it goes down very easily."

"Pours dark amber, reddish tinted, with a thick 1/4 inch fluffy white foam. Smoky nose, mixed in malt. Taste is thin caramel with a fiery/smoky close. Little bit of bitter hangs out at the finish. Slightly sour. Smoke is a little off putting at the end."

"Served from the bottle into a standard shaker at the Pantry on 3/22/13. Pours a dark burnished orange like a worn sun-bleached oak barrel. There is a little cream colored head that dissipates quickly without much lacing left behind. The nose is off. It smells like a standard amber ale with hints of melted sugar and baked brown bread, but there is the smoke smell as well. They just don't work well together on the nose, and it reminds me more of just pure liquid smoke which is just a touch off-putting. The taste is not very smoky though. There is definitely a biscuit taste and some sweet caramel with just a touch of that artificial smoke flavor. Mouthfeel is medium. Overall this is just not working for me. Maybe the smoked flavor is more of a porter thing for me and I need to keep trying things, but I just didn't like it."

"It's very pretty in the glass. The aroma is not that of a rauchbier, so a huge ding. But the taste is great, and the mouthfeel is too. Another great Colorado beer."

"I thought this was a nice, more mild version of the style, the smokiness isn't so dominant that you don't have a difficult time tasting what else is here."

"Overall I thought this was a decent beer, not true to style enough to be called a Rauchbier, but for an Amber Ale I would say it was a little above average. This beer was pretty drinkable, it was really smooth, and the flavor did an ok job at holding my attention, I could drink two of these but I think that would be my limit. What I liked most about this beer was the flavor and aroma, they were the highlights of this beer and were both pretty balanced. What I liked least about this beer was the lightness of the smoke and the higher carbonation, I needed more smoke and less carbonation. I would be buy this beer again when looking for a lightly smokey beer, but I wouldn't buy it often, I recommend giving this beer a try, it might make for a good gateway Rauchbier. All in all this was a lightly smokey amber, what it lacked in intensity it made up for in drinkability. This was the second beer I have had from this brewery and it was better then their Chocolate stout, I thought it was a pretty solid beer and I wouldn't mind trying some more beers from this brewery."

"Overall, an ok rauchbier but far from the top in the style. I would drink it again, though, purely for the ease of accessibility and lack of rauchbiers on the market."

"o - pretty good beer, but there are much better examples of the style that are easy enough to come by. wouldn't turn it down if someone offered me one though."
""
""
""
""
"O- This is the first rauchbeir I have ever had, but it was a style I longed to try since I like other smokey things, so I can't tell you if it's a good example of it's style. However, it's well balanced, and come on it tastes a little like bacon. Who wouldn't like that? I was always told rauchbeirs were overbearing, so I don't know if they toned down the smoke, or if it's simply that I like smokey things."
""
"I went into this thinking it was going to be meh, but I was pleasantly surprised. Sure, it's not a very in your face rauchbier, but it's a well put together beer and tasty, despite being on the mild side for the style."
""
""
""
"A fine beer that could be sessionable, however, it lacks inspiration."
""
""
"I'd buy it again."
""
""
"This is a really nice easy to drink everyday amber lager. I certainly would not call it a rauchbier by any stretch of the imagination, but I would buy it again. Seeing as how it's a nice blend between two of my favorite beers (Eliot Ness and Fat Tire), this is a nice addition to our distribution."

"one of the better fort collins brews. has a fantastic nose of smoked malt and dried pitted fruit. described as a lager, there is nothing lager about what i taste here. smokey like a grill fire, slightly sweet like caramelized malts, and quite refreshing despite its heavy flavors. this beer is in excellent balance and the mouthfeel is just right. fuller bodied for a lager, and well carbonated. i could easily down a sixpack of these in a session any time of year. not as smokey as some of the traditional rauchbiers, but in that vein. this is great"
"Very interesting smoked beer. I like the flavors, but the lingering sweetness gets a little sickly after a couple glasses. Still, this is easily the best beer I've had from this brewery so far."
""
""
"I can't tell what to think about this beer. Is it an ale? Is it a lager? Do I even like it? I'm not really sure, but it's definitely worth a try. I might not buy it for myself, but I wouldn't turn it away if someone offered it to me."

"O: Glad I got to try it. There are no off flavors and I did enjoy it, but it's not something I'd seek out. I may be in the minority here, but I wish a lot of the rauchbiers I've tried featured the smoke more as a main character, rather than an extra. Maybe all the smoked Texas barbecue I grew up with has desensitized me."
"This is very drinkable and would make a nice cold weather beer. Overall, though the flavor is mild and not very complex."
"Pours a nice dark tinted amber/copper colored ale with an off-white foamy head that stays pretty well throughout the session. Funky aroma. I am getting smacked in the nostrils with some smoked meat which is making me hungry. Meaty and campfire smoke abounds. There are some green olives and malt in there too. I think it's great! More smokiness on the taste and there is still some meat along with slight coffee and roastiness. Slight band-aid aftertaste which is a little putting-off. Overall I enjoyed my experience with this beer. I wouldn't say it is one of the greatest, but it has a lot going on and I enjoyed the session."
"Medium bodied with a prominent spice character up front that takes away from what little smokiness is underneath. Hints of cinnamon and brown sugar along with faint bitter hops that are slowly countered by a sweet malt backbone. Very faint smokiness but it is completely overpowered by the other characteristics. Lots of sweet caramel along with some biscuit and toffee. As it warms the smokey elements become more evident but are still considerably weak."
"Overall a very solid smoked lager. This is well worth trying if you are a smoked beer fan."
"Overall, balanced well but too subtle on the smoke. Easy enough to drink."
"A very nice smoked lager that's about as formitable as Negra Modelo except with a balance of smoke aroma and flavor that's careful not to dominate the brew."
"Very dark amber in appearance, no cloudiness at all, single finger cream-colored sticky head, nice lacing. A bit too thin in body, smells of mild bacon-ey smoke with a medium strong malt underneath, and tastes exactly the same as the nose, only with a heavy emphasis on the sweet malt. Did I mention that the smoke is really mild for a Rauchbier? This seems like its meant to be an intro to the style for those unfamiliar with it... Nice and mild, but not what I want when I seek out a rauchbier."
"Overall, it tasted really good. I would drink this again for sure."
"Pours a clear dark copper orange with a 1 inch off-white head that settles to a thin film. Small dots and streaks of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of roasted malt and some smoke/campfire aromas. Taste is of roasted malt, smoke flavors, and a coffee grounds aftertaste. Mild bitterness on the palate after each sip. Good carbonation with a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good American take on a rauchbier style that is much more mild than any of the others I have tried so far."
"O- Quite bland and meh."
"Dr: Very drinkable for a rauchbier, but then it really isn't one. It's quite affordable in any case, and while it won't please hardcore fans of the style, it would make an excellent introduction to the style for newcomers before plunging them into Schenkerla. It's certainly worth a spin, and I admire the brewery's boldness in trying to capture an American mainstream market with this."
"Overall: Very good smoked lager. Highly recommended if you like smoked beers"
"O: This is a nice beer, but it's nowhere near as intense as Schlenkerla, more like Spezial if we're going German. Caldera's is better domestically, but frankly hardly any brewers make this style so it's always nice to see."
"A"
"Cheers."
"This lager pours brilliantly clear deep red with garnet hues and a sticky off-white head. The aroma is moderate-high peaty, smoky malt, a bit biscuity, spicy, and sweet - very inviting. The flavor is moderately malty, earthy a bit spicy, maybe from hops and malt, a sweet caramel flavor comes through at the swallow. The beer finishes quite smooth and rather balanced. The carbonation and body are both moderate. Overall a well crafted tasty brew--worth a try. One wish would be the flavor to come through a bit more intensely like the nose."
"O: A nice smoked beer for those who don't really want to drink liquid bacon. It's not too heavy like many rauchbiers and isn't overwhelmingly smoky."
"O: This is a tasty smoke beer but it lacks complexity and does not stick out in any way."
"A decent beer and a good introduction to the smoked variety but as a rauchbier lover I really hoped for a more intense experience"
"A medium copper color with light carbonation and little foam. The aroma has a mild smokiness reminiscent hickory chips in a fire pit. The taste has a nice maltiness but I was expecting a little denser body, which seems a tad watered down, probably from being produced on the level it is. It has promise up front with the aroma but is weak on the follow-through."
"A unique brew but really not what I'm looking for in an enjoyable beer. Smokey qualities are adequately demonstrated but without much of a hop presence to balance the malty sweetness it begins to get flat and unpleasant. FCB could deliver this one a bit better."
"D: A great brew, and an excellent choice for someone looking to get into smoke brews. Z's smoke is subtle, but easily perceived, so that it will give the drinker a good idea of what smoke is all about without overwhelming them. All-in-all, this is a very well balanced brew that deserves some attention."
"The verdict - I personally did enjoy this beer at all. I was very disappointed with it after getting excited to see it in my local store. It tasted very similar to Three Skulls Buccaner Bacon, which was also not very good."
"Let me preface this review by saying I didn't think the beer was bad and I enjoyed it, but when I was told by the bartender it was a rauchbier and then tried it I felt let down. Poured a reddish copper with minimal head that stuck around and died slow and left lace ring. Had a bittery, watery smell for some reason and some sweet malts but not the smokey smell I expected. Taste follows the same as instead of a smokey, bullish malt beer I get a rather lightly sweetened bitter pale ale, it seems, as a light-to-medium body passes over my tongue w/ sharp hoppy bitterness and hints of roasted malts mixed w/ minor sweet caramel. It finishes dry and was alright to drink but they missed the ball on this one."
"(D)- I am no a fan. I am appreciate a good smoked beer, but I am not sure what this wants to be."
"Odd that this comes from Fort Collins which brews such great beers. Their Rocky Mountain IPA is one of my favorites and is an undiscovered gem."
" D- This beer is undrinkable with a great nose, and a nice malt flavor buried under the awful peat smoke/chlorine phenol quality. I love rauchbiers and this is not one. It is to harsh to drink."
"Drinkability is bad. I can't finish this beer. I finish every beer I start. I normally love Fort Collins, but I would not recommend this beer to anyone."
"Its an odd beer, definitely one for a campfire side. You could basically suck of a charred piece of wood and get the same effect."
"D: Tasty, but forgetful. A good change up, but not interesting enough to be a regular purchase. Want more smoke."
"DRINKABILITY Pretty good,No heat,no over abrassive elements at all. Smoke isn't too big to make it a repeat drink."
"This beer pours a deep amber color with a head of off-white foam that reduces to a film on the surface. The aroma of this beer is mostly of caramel, but if you dig real deep you can pull out the smoke aroma that is supposed to be there. There are also hints of ginger and cinnamon. The taste is much lighter than I would have expected, there is an initial bitterness that is immediately followed by a sweet caramel flavor. The aftertaste is where the smoke comes in and it's rather obvious on the aftertaste palate. Honestly it's not nearly as strong as I was thinking that it would be on the overall palate. The palate is odd to me. Everything seems to be there, but still it seems thin in the body. This is a drinkable beer, nothing overall wrong with it, but it's a stoically unimpressive. Good beer not great."
"D- drinkable yes, as there's nothing particularly aversive, but there are better smoked beers out there, won't be seeking this out again."
"Overall- Fairly drinkable for a smoked brew and nicely done if you dont want to be completely overwhelmed with smoke in a rauchbier. More smoke in the nose than in the flavor. This would make a nice compliment to chili, or even a great ingredient in a pot! Would be a fun beer to pair with BBQ or other foods as the light smoke would play well and not overwhelm the food. Worth a try."
"This is a nice beer. Not great, but it does drink well and I feel it would work nicely as a fall beer, especially around a campfire. This would pair awesomely with any grilled fare."
"D - Fort Collins has had a lot of brews that I have enjoyed a lot...this version of a Rauchbier isn't terrible, and it is something that anybody should try. There are certainly areas that could be improved, but overall I was quite impressed by it.."
"Mouthfeel is creamy, smooth and finishes with a sweetness yet semi dry finish."
"This is a solid brew, and an interesting idea to make a rauchbier out of an amber lager rather than a darker, sturdier brew, but it works well here."
"Burnt orange color....nice smoked malt aroma...relatively subtle but noticable....Body is about medium but firm...nice smoked malt flavor...a bit of caramel as well....clean tasting...excellent drinker...well done..This would be an excellent summer BBQ beer."
"D - Well I got two and they are sadly gone but I have to agree with everyone if you never had a Rauchbier this was a pretty darn good one."
"Such a unique lager...everyone should try this once just to experience it."
"An excellent pairing with grilled, smoked, or BBQ'd meats."
"Like drinking a BBQ."
"Buy Again? Yes."
"D: This is a nice and safe Rauchbier. Its light flavor makes it a good intro to the style for the newcomer. A nice pickup."
"Pours an orange brown color with a medium sized peachy head. A mild smokeyness in the nose which is very dominated by a sweet malt note. Some further smokeyness in its flavor as well, again very mild. Good active carbonation helps its drinkability. A style not explored by many US brewers for a reason, this offering was average at best."
"Would I buy more of it? - I might, I just might."
"D- Very good with a meal. On it's own, this might be a little too unique to really session with."
"Certainly an interesting beer... I kinda dig it. The smoke flavors are not overpowering, making this an interesting change of pace from a normal amber ale. Based on this beer, I'd be interested in trying more rauchbiers."
"The burnt orange colored body was topped with a small head, and the overall presentation was typical amber lager. The aroma was malty and mellow with the smoke only evident with some deep breaths. The taste is where this beer fell apart for me. All I got was slightly smoky flavor and sweetened water like industrial malt taste. Not particularly interesting in the approach except the hint of smoke. Pretty thin in the mouth as well with a zap of carbonation like soda water. Not a very good imitation of the Bamberg classics."
"Pours a nice clear coppery amber with a decent, if not persistent, off-white head. Aroma is strong and malty with smoky, fruity and caramel hints. Mouth-filling flavor is malty and slightly fruity with a hint of caramel and a whisper of sweetness. Texture is very smooth and minimally tingly."
"Value: $8.99 a sixer at my joint. On sale. Good deal I guess if you like this style."
"Pours a rich coppery amber with a very miniscule white froth for a head, which dissappears pretty quickly regardless of its lack of body. The smell is of malts with a barbecue chicken backbone. Honestly, I was hoping for more smoke, but, hey, them's the breaks. The taste pretty much follows the nose, but the smoke is thankfully more pronounced, bringing the desired complexity missing from the smell. The mouthfeel is a little on the slick, watery side, but this does serve as a foil to the smoke, leading to an overall high level of drinkability."
"I just love rauchbiers. This is not the best I have had but it is certainly a winner. Pours a lucid orange color. The nose offers faint smokiness and a touch of charred wood. The taste is heavenly with a well balanced smoked meat goodness that goes down smooth but not overpowering. Certainly enjoy this with some smoked gouda or smoked sausage."
"Bottle from Agassi. A decent serviceable lager and rauch. Light smoke. Pours moderate yellow body with lots of white bubbly head. A mild smoke aroma. Decently drinkable,thanks to the caramel bit not delicious. Average mouthfeel.Appropriate carbonation."
"D-very drinkable the flavor while being very pallatable (a standout for the style) seems restrained which combined with the body make for a good session beer though im not sure that many would choose it"
"Nice sweet and smoky malt aroma. The smoke is dialed down and approachable. Flavor is similar, sweet and a hint of smoke with a trace of dry bitterness. The aftertaste lingers for awhile, mildly dry and campfire wood smoke. Feel is a little watery as the carbonation escapes. Decent enough, seems like a nice beer for a Rauch beginner, or for a Fall night by the fire."
"Drinkable, a sipper for me, but would go oh so well with some choice meaty/ cheesy foods. I actually like this style quite a bit, at least from what I can tell from Fort Collins version. I understand there are smokier versions out there; I'm curious to try them at some point. I'm kind of excited that I like this style, seeing as how it may not be the most popular with everyone. Good stuff, Fort Collins."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew is a deep amber color with nice red tint when held to the light. The head is less than a finger and leaves nearly no cap and no lacing. The aroma is smoky and has some hints of caramel and thick malts. The taste is extremely overwhelmed by smokiness. The bottle states the malts are dried over an open fire. This seems to overpower the entire brew. The carbonation is nice and there is some balance with hops in the finish, but it is very hard to get over the initial taste that just lingers. I am glad I purchased this as a single as I am not going to have again."
"Beer poured a clear amber with a white head that is barely hanging on in mid glass. Nose is smoked malt, but not overwhelming as one might think. Taste is strong on smoked malts initially with an unexpected decent bittering hop finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and lightly carbonated. Overall drinkability is pretty good, the beer is initially strong on the smoke but becomes more agreeable to the palate as the bottle is consumed."
"It is drinkable, quite drinkable, I need another to sparkle that aftertaste away!"
"Pours a clear copper color with a large off-white head that had excellant retention before settling to a thick cap. A good amount of sticky lacing is left on the glass. Aroma has the appropriate amount of smokey charactor. A touch of sweetness is lingering underneath the smoke. The smoke goes a bit mild in the flavor. We don't want to offend the masses type of way. Still quite noticable. A touch of sweetness balances things out. I would of liked a bit more smoke to bring this up to good grade levels. The body seems a little thin. By far the weakest component of this beer. A more sessionable Rauchbier as several of these could be consumed without getting tired of the smoke. The real good Rauchbiers makes one compare them to ham or bacon, cannot do that with this one."
"Thanks again to whoever sent this to me, sorry I took so long to get to it... Normally, I don't appreciate smoked beers and this one was really pretty nice."
"D - A really good smokey beer. I wish I had some vegetarian riblets from Morningstar Farms."
"Medium bodied, with an appropriate carbonation level. Surprisingly easy drinker. Just a subtle kiss from the smoke in the finish. Very, very pleasant surprise."
"Drinkability: While not a bad beer, this one was a bit of a disappointment. The smoky taste is there, but the finish is harsh. I may have this again, but I think there are way better in the style."
"d- this is my first rauchbier, it's a very interesting style that i'm glad i tried, this won't be a regular drinking brew for me but it was very interesting and enjoyable, i'd drink this again but i'll stick to one per session."
"This beer pours a clear red color. The head is none existent. The aroma is smoke with a hint of caramel malt. It is a rather simple aroma. The taste is like the aroma. I like that there is a lot of smoke, but there isn't nothing else. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, and a smooth texture. Overall, this is a decent beer that could be a lot better if it had a more complex malt bill. I could drink it again, but there are better smoked beers out there."
"D - Good, better with some food though."
"- Note: smokiness seems to fade as you drink more of the beer, which could be good or bad depending on how much you like the smokey flavor."
"Taste is a little tame, but a nice semi-sweet lager. I feel like I'm describing a wine. Smoke flavor is far in the back backing up the amber flavor. Fruity around the edges. Definitely let down in terms of smoke flavor but I'm enjoying it. Mouthfeel is a hit as is drinkability, because it's a nice easy drinking, flavorful lager which is why I like this style. We used to get kegs of Rohrbach's Amber Lager in college and it was always a treat. Not sure if this is what they were going for here. I think there could be a nice imperial version of this in the making in my basement at some point..."
"D - Dry finish makes this a very drinkable amber in spite of the very present smoke. You can bet I order this if I see it on tap."
"Overall this was definitely in the bottom half of rauchbiers I've had however it may be a good gateway beer for those not so sure about smoked malt."
"The initial smokiness nods at Rauchbier, but I'd like to see a deeper smoke."
"This is a solid rauchbier, but I wouldn't put it up there with the Schlenkerla beers. Then again, I love a big ole' super smoky rauchbier so take that statement for what it's worth."
"D - Easy drinking with a nice flavor profile. Solid smoke presence that manages to stand out without being overpowering. I don't have a lot of experience with Rauchbiers, but enjoyed this offering quite a bit."
"drinkability is good - not an overpowering beer but a nice lager with a subtle smokey flavor"
"Overall this is a nice smoked beer that's subtle enough to be a beer to drink regularly and introduce people to the style."
"I love rauchbiers and could drink a couple of these pretty easily."
"D- I'm a big fan of smoked beers and this is another tasty one. Not my favorite, but an easy drinking one that I wouldn't mind having again. Would make an excellent tailgating/cookout beer."
"Pours a smokey, dark amber hue with just a little bubbling. OK lacing, with a quick ring of foam. Smokey, bready mlats ad a little bit of toasted oak and a little campfire. Caramel and bready malts with a dash of funky hops. Toasted barrel hits the middle, but fades away to the finish bringing back some dark caramel. The palate is very smooth and a touch of smoke. Since the smokiness is on the lighter side, this is a pretty sessionable rauchbier."
"Overall- Decent but nothing inspiring. Worth a bottle or 2."
"D: A decent mouthfeel and taste combination makes this beer pretty easy to drink. As more of the smokiness came out, it made the beer nicer. Decent smokebeer overall."
"D- I'm a big fan of smoked beers and this is another tasty one. Not my favorite, but an easy drinking one that I wouldn't mind having again. Would make an excellent tailgating/cookout beer."
"Notes: This was so welcomed at my latest grilling session. Smoky and flavorful,but not overwhelming."
"So far gotta love the Fort Collins lineup, these beers are excellent. I kept on passing on them for the longest time. They definitely need a rep in the Burgh these beer has potential to sell. Anyways, this smoked lager pours a beautiful amber ruby hue with a light off white cream colored head. Lacing is even and covers the edges of my chalice like a blancket between each sip. A great nose of mild smoked malts, with slightly charred wood and smoke bacon at the minimal. Herbal hops also play nicely with the smoked malt additions, classically American style. Flavor has a great round edge of smokiness with sweet amber and caramel malt lager characteristics again hop flavor comes through as herbal, yet the flavor that finishes the beer is the smoked malt kickin' through. Like an American version of Spezial Ruachbier, great stuff. It's not going to kick compared to an scherlenkerla bier but it's sweet to taste the German influences in American micros. Mouthfeel is a fuller bodied lager, soft carbonation with lingering smoked wood and lightly salted smoked meat components. Drinkability overall is wonderful a beer that I'm proud to represent every time I try to remember my Z beer in the alphabetical list in the database."
"D - Very nice, the smoke is readily apparent and adds a great deal of character to the hoppy amber lager body, but it does not overwhelm the palate. The smoke seems a bit more restrained than the German versions that I have had, but it has all of the same qualities and could be a good introduction to the style. A great example of the style."
"Enjoyable. :)"
"From a 32 ounce bottle/growler filled at DeCiccios in Ardsley, NY. Pours dark, ruby/blood orange tinged, amber, minor head and just a smidge of lace. Seems to be on the low carbonation side of things. Moderate smoke in the nose. Pleasantly malty brew, noticable, but fairly restrained levels of smoke. Complexity is enjoyable and this one would likely go well with some BBQ. Nothing amazing, but pleasant enough smoke up offering, worth a try for those with a taste for a smike infused, easy drinking lager."
"Unfortunately, the smokiness in the flavor is a bit more tame, but still tasty. Has a heavy caramely malt base that brings forth a sweetness that does not match really well with smoky and salty flavors. Overall though, it is a pretty impressive offering from FCB, probably the first I have had that I would actually buy a sixer of."
"Pours a golden orange with a one finger white head. Excellent retention and lacing. Aroma is of smokey Carmel malts and dark fruits. Body is light to medium with some carbonation. Taste is nicely smoked. Malty,and hints of dark fruits. Definitely worth a try."
"Z Lager pours a dark orange with a thin tan head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The flavor is quite malty and the smoke is quite noticeable but it isn't as strong as the smoke in some German rauchbier that I've had. Lots of caramel as this beer warms. Not bad, I could drink a few of these."
"This beer pours a gorgeous clear orange-red. Not much of a head to speak of, what is there recedes very quickly with a tiny little white film layering the top, very little spotty lacing left. Nose is of deep toasted malts and smokiness - reminds me of smoked bacon without much of the bacon smell. Taste is sweet at first, caramel malts lead the way, and then leads in to toasted malts and a great smoked flavoring. They've blended this nicely - perfect balance of sweet and smoked. Mouthfeel is a medium bodied, smooth beer, slightly creamy, nicely carbonated, slight aftertaste. This beer goes down far too easily - a definite can and will sit with it for an evening."
"The feel is lagery smooth, but with a creamy, ashy feel at the swallow. Smoky and pretty nice. Really a lager with hints of smoke rather than a true Rauchbier."
"Drinkability: Just the right amount of smoke layered onto a light, refreshing lager. Sort of the young kid brother of the Schlenkerla brews. Paired fairly well with the Fish n' Chips."
"I seem to consistently give beers from this brewery slightly better scores than other BAs do, and this beer is no exception. It's not so much that I think the beers are stellar, but merely that they are well made, often in unexciting styles, but not really extreme in any way. They are what they are, and what they are are simple, well-made beers. Now a Rauchbier might not fit the bill for that philosophy, but this one is relatively balanced and while there is some moderate smokiness, it isn't quite the salami taste that some of the style has. In other words its smoky enough to be interesting, but still accesible enough to appeal to someone who isn't used to the style. Brown with little head with a very light amount of malt, grain , and smoke on the nose. The taste is a bit smokier and maltier. Smooth and easy to drink. Not bad at all."
"D: Interestingly tasty beer with good balance. The smoke is not overdone so it doesn't taste like the bottom of an ashtray. I don't know about a session beer, but I'd definitely drink it again."
"12 oz. Orange/amber pour, good size white head. Strong malty aroma with hints of some smoke. Tastes reminds me more of a dopplebock, malty raisin and peat. Smoke is really just an accent here. Finishes some smoke and hops. Very drinkable, good example."
"Overall, a great beer that just misses on being legendary since the awesome smoke aroma and taste really start to fade halfway thru. As I noted earlier, mine was missing some head and lacing that others got so I may not have had a fresh one. Will need to re-try this one in the future and possibly re-review it. For now, still highly recommend. As is, it would be a player in the rotation. If the smoke sticks around longer, it could be a major player."
"D - Overall not a bad beer I just like a more smokey meaty flavor in my smoked beers but its still an enjoyable beer to drink good with food from the grill"
"12 oz., slightly under-filled bottle with no freshness date. It pours a crystal-clear amber, with a thick finger of noisy, tan head that reduces to a thin cap and leaves little lacing. Sweet and smoky bacon in the nose, with a dash of darker or crystal malts. Clean flavor profile, with spicy hops, a mild bitterness, pleasantly smoky malts, and a nice sweetness to back it all up. It has a lightish, dry body with a crisp tingle that makes this beer very easy to drink. I loved this one - incredibly balanced and insanely drinkable. If I had to critique it, I would desire a more robust smokiness, but as it is, it's a very approachable and refreshing rauchbier. Make sure you grab at least two bottles if you see this one."
"This is definitely an acquired taste. I've had other smokey tasting beers, but this was the first true Rauch."
"Pours a clear amber color. 1/4 inch head of an off-white color. Decent retention and decent lacing. Smells strongly of roasted malts, smoke, and later a strong lager aroma. Fits the style of a Smoked Beer. Mouth feel is of smooth and crisp. Average to low carbonation level present. Tastes of smoke first off then, toasted malts, and then some sweeter caramel (maybe). Finishes off with a yest cleanliness (lageresque). Of the smoked beer I've had, this is by far the best. The smoke flavor is noticeable, but not overpowering which is an easy error to make, as far as I've read. Still not a great beer, but very good for it's category."
"Pours a copper color with the tiniest little head to it and zero lacing. Smell reminds of being a t campground when I was younger.. some nice smokiness, but not overpowering. Nice smooth and creamy mouthfeel and nice body. Tastes like someone blew some smoke up a lager's ass (literally, except I mean this in a good way). Very easy to drink.. I was actually surprised that it doesn't taste as smokey as it smells and felt maybe it could have used a tad more taste. My first time having this style and I would def want to try more of it."
"Poured out into a pint glass. Slightly hazy amber/brown, reddish tint, one thumb off-white head fades over a minute or so. Nose is liquid smoke and corn chips. Taste is barnyard hops, generic cereal grains, and metal, with a mild lingering campfire smoke. The smoke definitely comes through on the nose a lot more than the taste. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both average."
"Don't drink and review."
"Mouthfeel is a pretty strait forward lager body. I guess for smoked beers, I lean more towards porters and the such."
"D: While not as smoky as one may hope for, this does make for a nice drinking lager that is highlighted with just enough of a smoky presence to appreciate. Fans of rauchbier may be let down a bit expecting a barn burner like aecht schlenkerla, but this can still appreciated for its clean ,though light flavor and can easily be session material."
"Z is a decent beer, a good one even, but nothing stands out at all. I would enjoy this with a grilled beef dish, but its never going to blow me away. Decent effort and worth picking up, but I probably won't be buying it again."
"My first smoked amber, and don't know what to expect, but Fort Collins always makes some good brews, so here goes. Pours bright red with a fairly dense one and a half finger tan head. Retention is good with a couple of outcroppings of lace left behind. Smells of sweet malts, nuts and caramel with a smoked undercurrent. Tastes sweet and malty at first, then some earthiness and faint notes of spice come into play. The smokey affect shows itself furtively in the aftertaste. It's light-bodied, with a quick burst of carbonation bubbles upon a good shake. Not bad for my first smoked amber, but I can see I need to try some more before I jump to any major conclusions."
"A very nice little beer. Mild smoke character but adding interest and well integrated. Surprisingly sweet on the finish but just pulls it off. Medium to light bodied, slick and well done mouthfeel. I would appreciate a little more spritz both in the glass and the mouth but not worth a ding. Bready in the middle, smoky up front, and a sweet linger on the finish. The way the savory aspect of the smoke wonderfully dissipates into this balancing sweetness is really nice. Some caramel in the nose and honey in the mouth. Probably the lightest smoke smoked beer Ive ever had but an enjoyable drink. Cheers to Ft Collins and Andrew for the sample. Drinkability is great for a smoked lager."
"Taste is initially fruity and sweet. Quickly moves to a smokey and lightly hopped spiced finish. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium. Has a more subtle kiss of carbonation that pushes the flavor forward at a moderate pace rather than overwhelms. Drinkable and improved when paired with various meats. I enjoyed it with some lamb chops."
"Pours a nice clean/clear dark golden amber color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some nice smoke notes, and some spice. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, smoky, with some spice. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a tasty brew, not too much smoke."
"Essentially this beer is a light brown ale with a weak head designed to be a vehicle for ""smoked""flavor. If you are looking for a chance to drink ""smoke," here it is. Otherwise the beer is essentially nothing remarkable. The only reason these numbers are so high is that it is not offensive in anyway. I bought this a mixed case and would not buy it again."
"The taste is pretty subtle too, there are some slightly roasted notes, no real peatiness that I can discern, yes there is a bit of smokiness, but nothing that makes a statement. The beer is quite light bodied, a bit carbonated, and just a watered down smoked beer. It isn't unpleasant, just not great. There is a slightly drying mouth puckering finish, but overall the beer is just too sweet, too light, and too watery to be taken seriously."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a flavorful beer that doesn't overdo the smokiness. It's a good beer to drink when you want something a little different."
"D: I have a tough time drinking Rauchbiers without eating a hearty meal. This one went well with a bbq pulled pork sammie!"
"D - Though perhaps not as cohesive as it's German counterparts, this is a great stab at the style and is more than worthy. Drinkability is decent as the smoke doesn't overpower you. While the flavor might be a little weak, it's still quite good."
"Drinkability is moderate. The flavor is fine, but smoked beers are a strange animal to consume. I'm certainly glad I gave this another chance though, as the first time I had it I despised it. This go around, it's not so bad."
"D - If I were a restaurant owner I'd be sure to keep these in stock with my pork, beef, and chicken. Excellent drinkability with any meal."
"Side note: Many of the people at the brewery that day (mostly a gang of Harley riders) commented that it tasted like either bacon or BBQ potato chips."
"A decent Rauchbier; however, nothing too impressive in terms of flavor, especially in comparison to a full-flavored German. Not a bad alternative though for a late summer or early autumn brew."
"Pours a clear, bright amber color with a 1/3 inch, creamy head that retains pretty well. Decent lacing. Smells of smoked meat and hickory notes. Tastes of more smokiness, smoked meat/fish, maltiness with a touch of bittering hops, strong smoky finish but not over the top, kind of thin. Mouthfeel is a tad thin to medium bodied, slightly dry finish. Fairly drinkable and pleasant to drink. Pretty solid brew but nothing amazing."
"After having this beer before, this bottle just doesn't taste right. I bought it as a single, and I have a feeling this is an old bottle. I will buy this beer again in the near future and edit my review as needed."
"I couldn't finish this beer. It poured a nice brown-gold color and had some interesting scents. When I drank it, all I tasted was SMOKE! It made my turkey sandwich taste like smoked turkey, which was cool. Other than that, I quickly tired of the overwhelming smoke flavor of this beer and gave it a drain pour."
"Served in a nonic. Poured a translucent amber with a half inch off-white head embedded with tiny ringlets. Eventually formed a broken skim of foam; some strands of lacing during the session. No smoke evident in the nose; picked up primarily malt and a hint of caramel. Smokey flavor dominates in the mouth; picked up some peat and hickory on this one, as well as a little hops towards the end. Light and lively mouthfeel with a fairly dry finish with not much of an aftertaste. Decent drinkability, but not quite sure of the style as this is my first smoked beer."
"D - Any BBQ and I'll take 10."
"D: Easy to drink, not my favorite style but a nice beer."
"D: One is enough for me. Its just too smoky for my taste. It was interesting and would pair well with some ribs, but just not my style. 2.5"
"nice and snappy, it's a good beer, really solid beer I am planning on pouring a glass of scotch to drink along side this one."
"Opinion: This is a pretty good beer. It is mild in supporting flavors, but the flavor overall is clean and accentuates the smoke flavors pretty well. It is not overly phenolic, which definitely adds to its drinkability. I imagine that it would go well with a lot of foods, so I wouldn't mind trying it again for that reason alone."
"D- I could enjoy this beer perhaps more with some red meat or something off the grill. I don't know. I wouldn't say its bad, but I don't think I like the style all that much."
"Fort Collins seems to delivery a solid lineup of brews. Cheers."
"Would like to get my hands on another one of these some day after the smoke has cleared."
"Tasted (in Iowa!) on 5/23/08."
"Poured a deep clear orange with a quickly reducing head. a bit of lacing later on. Smells of sweet malts, not much else. I enjoyed this, mouthfeel is like a regular lager, a bit thin but the smokiness is pleasant. I like rauchbeers in a very linited quantity, this is more drinkable. A nice change and seemed to go well with very sharp cheese."
"Pours a somewhat foggy sunset orange hue with a one finger off-white head that quickly dies down to a thin layer of bubbles. A fair amount of stick remains on the sides throughout tasting. Smell consists of lightly charred wood, smoked grains, and some caramel malt. That's pretty much it in the nose, pretty basic. Taste begins with a funky sweetness followed by a very weak smoked birch. Malts and grains come forward midway on the tongue. Aftertaste has a tiny bit of smoked meats, but is mostly bland and watered down. Light to medium body with a creamy feel. Carbonation is subtle, and pleasant. This definitely isn't a Rauchbier, so I guess the classification of it being a Smoked Beer is fitting. Either way, I don't like where it's going. Nothing I would suggest seeking out, not sure I understand this beer...? I'm hoping I run across the Rogue's Smoke Ale someday to see how that one matches up."
"Poured a 12oz beer into my Chimay chalice. Pours a amber red with a thin head that has absolutely no head retention at all. The aroma reminds me of caramel malts, smoke, chocolate, toffee, and a slight smell of copper pennies. The taste is odd. The smoke really comes out in flavor but not in a great way. The smoke is really mild, but it kind of sits on the back of the throat and affects every other taste. Caramel comes out and their is a slight metallic taste that follows the smoke. It's really odd. The mouthfeel is much fuller than I expected. I have drank this at the brewery many times and always found it easy to drink (might be because I had always had a flight and a couple pints) but out of the bottle is just tastes off. I remember these flavors in the draft version but not as pronounced."
"This is a heavier body lager that cloys. Mouthfeel is good and this is a great beer to serve with food."
"Poured a clear copper color with a small light tan head. Smell is of caramel and dry. Can't pick up much smoke in the nose. Taste is upfront sweet and thick. Subtle smokey notes really compliment the taste. The smokey notes remind me of smoked pork or jerky, not over the top smokey like some other smoked brews. The body is pretty hefty for a lager."
"Smell is of light smoke on top of malt and clean mineral water. The taste of smoke is there but not obnoixious at all. The smoke brings out an almost woody character to the malts and give a nice touch to the overall palate. Feel is clean and crisp. This is a good beer to have with BBQ and stands alone on its own. I would have this again, but I would have to be in the mood for it. I don't always want smoke in my beer, but I enjoyed this."
"D. Fairly drinkable, will have again if its still on tap there in the future."
"Drinkability - rauchbier is a specialty beer for me, I can't drink them often or many at a time. I would like to have this around, though, for weekend cookouts and such."
"Drinkability: I had this one by itself and that was a mistake. This one needs some bbq with it. It got be a chore at the end, but I enjoyed the style."
"A mild smoke-beer - going towards a Rauchbier. Too many samll detractors to be really enjoyable, though it's a worthy effort."
"The beer is generally drinkable, but I feel too many would give you an overwhelming smoky-aftertaste."
"D: Didnt know abv but didnt pick up any alcohol warmth. I guess drinkable in that not too smoky but the food really overpowered any flavors in this beer which really shouldnt happen. Not a favorite. A true medicore beer."
"Decent mouthfeel, albeit very light and watery with a fairly good level of drinkability due to the modest ABV and lack of cloying flavors... For an excellent sample of the style, try Rogue's Smoke Ale or anything from Aecht Schlenkerla..."
"Picked up a single bottle from The Palidades in Jersey City. My first offering from this brewery and just purchased it for a taste of something different. The beer poured a glowing amber color with really bright spots. Relatively small thing head on top, leaving the glass after the first few sips. After a first taste, I could already taste the smoke. The smoke was similar to those of fire roasted charcoal and smoked meats. There was also a malty caramel quality and a faint hop presence. Mouthfeel was a little better than average as this beer was rich and almost creamy. Drinkability suffered due to the smoked flavor which to me, was over the top. I did find this beer to be exciting and new, but nothing more. Surely worth a try for the experience!"
"Poured into a standard pint glass a deep amber/brown with almost no head to speak of,smoke is light in the nose but is there along with some light chocolate and a little of a sour component.Again light smoke flavors up front with ahefty carame and chocolate sweetness melding into a touch of earth and lingering smoke again in the finish.Its ok but a little light handed with the smoke not bad but not one to go out and look for."
"Drinkability: this would be a great beer with some BBQ. As a stand alone it is interesting but not a session beer. Definitely worth a try."
"This beer has a most definitive taste to it, the smokiness in the flavor tastes almost like smoked meat. It has a nice dark amber color and has decent mouthfeel. But that taste and the smell associated with it can easily put off the unprepared drinker. If you know what you're looking for, than it's a great beer, as my friend comments. If not, then it's best you skip this one."
"12oz. brown bottle served in a shaker pint. Pours a hazy amber with a quickly dissipating head. Sweet caramelized sugar with a little smoke in the aroma. Very sweet on the start. A slight noble hop bitterness. The smoke flavor is pretty subtle. I like more smoke in a smoked beer, so it was a little lacking to me."
"D - This is a pretty good beer. I liked it better than the Rauchbier that I tried."
"The overall drinkability just wasn't there, though. After having one, I felt that I was in no hurry for a second one. A good, unique brew, but I can't see drinking it on a regular basis."
"In the mood for a rauchbier as the seasons change, I found a pleasant surprise, as Shop-Rite Liquors added the Fort Collins brewery to its shelves...translucent brownish orange body with a white, thin yet resilient head upon a cascade of bubbles--quite lively...wicked cedar smoke to the aroma, reminiscent of a smokepit summer night...toasted something is present too...medium bodied, with a swift start to finish and a familiar smokey end on the back of the tongue...aggressive on the sides of the tongue, but subsiding quickly...a well-balanced taste, not dominating in any aspect...not sweet, but substantial...I have not heard much of this brewery, but I enjoyed sessioning this and imagine pairing it with grilled foods in the summer and spicier fare all year round...."
"Rounded out my evening session with this beer. I had never had anything from them before, but was lucky enough to pick up a mixed sixer of their and this was the first one I was going to try out of it. This poured a nice decent brownish amber color with a small off white head that quickly faded leaving behind only traces of what was left. The smell was rather intriguing. Smelled like a Dopplebock, full of smoked aroma and a deep underlying sweetness, this had a very full body to it. The flavor followed suit nicely with a full on smoked flavor and a lovely lightly hopped finish to it. Traces of caramel rippled throughout adding just the right amount of sweetness to it. Overall this actually surprised me; the deep flavors of wood aged smokiness took me completely off guard and give this a profile I did not expect to find. Definitely quality ale and something I would look forward to trying again in the future. Very full and very nice this one will surprise you in a very good way."
"D: For a smoked beer this is very drinkable. Never had a smoked lager before. Definitely different."
"Light to medium body,tangy,leaving a dry feel at the end. Could drink a couple,not a beer i would drink all night."
"Picked this up on a recent trip to Iowa. Beers with smoke flavors seem to be somewhat rare, so I try them whenever I see them. This is a pretty good beer that doesn't overdo the smokiness. I'll have it again!"
"BACONBACONBACON! Had this brew on draught at the brewery. Color was a faded brown with a off white head that left rather quickly leaving a great lacing. I love the rauchbier style, eventhough I can't drink them often. Not only does bacon come out of this, but a beautiful caramel flavor hit my palate rather strong."
"Pors a orange-ish/ copper color with a small white head. Aromas of a smoked malt, kind of like beef jerky. In the taste, malty and a small smoke flavor. A smooth malty mouthfeel and a smokey aftertaste. Nice smoke aroma also not to big in the taste, lighter but good."
"Drinkability: Wow, am I ever impressed. I like a good, but restrained, smoked beer and this fits the bill to a tee; almost a smoked Marzen, in some respects"
"D - A lighter amber lager and slightly forced smoke-wise, but still worth a try."
"A perfectly made beer. Great job."
"Z Lager is one of the best beers from this brewery that I've had yet. There aren't too many American craft brewers who will even attempt a rauchbier. I suspect that there considerably fewer who could brew one this competently. This stuff would be a perfect match for a pulled pork sandwich, baked beans and cole slaw. Is it lunchtime yet?"
"The beer poured a crisp amber with a thin head that diminished to nothing. The aroma was a blend of malts and smoke. The taste was a good blend of caramel malts and smoke in a unique balance, nothing spectacular, but very good for what it is. The beer is light and enjoyable if you appreciate smoke flavor in beer. This would make a decent session beer, but is nothing I would seek out."
"After looking at some other reviews I am wondering if I got a really bad batch, but this was easily the worst beer I have ever had. Poured a clear copper color with little to no head and no noticable lacing. Smell is like cigarettes and carmel malts. Taste is really bad. I would describe it as something like cigarettes and iced tea. I could barely manage a few sips before it met the drain."
"Overall impression: Not bad - better with food than on its own."
"Z Lager was amber in color with an off-white head. The head was soon reduced to a thin layer that stuck around, leaving a little lacing behind. The aroma was smoky with some malt in the backround. The taste was smoke over nice malt base, a little sweet upfront, but more balanced in the finsh. The body was medium with medium carbonation. Drinkability was good. It's a good beer and would be great with BBQ."
"Good stuff."
"The taste is woody with notes of smoke and roasted malt. The smoke, to me, is more noticeable midway through and in the finish where it *does* have a bit of harshness to it but, all in all, I like this brew and find it pretty drinkable."
"Drinkability is high. This is a very mellow rauch sort of beer and would pair well with tropical fruits, soft cheeses, strawberries, pear, etc"
"What a pleasant treat, here I was expecting a bland macro-wannabee, that'll teach me to open a beer blind (not really, because the surprise was really nice as well). Smooth drinking and smoky a real treat. The smokiness leans towards the Spezial side of the Rauchbier spectrum (lightly smoky), so I would certainly welcome more smoke character, but as is, this strikes a really nice balance."
"12 ounce bottle."
" A little flat, maybe I got a bad batch."
"The body is hard to really indicate, but I would say more of a medium feel. Overall the beer has too much going on and needs to blend more of the flavors."
"I paired it with a non-smoked cheese - Cahill's Porter and it stood up perfectly."
"A bit of a let down from a usually solid brewery."
"A somewhat decent lager although Im not a huge fan of the style. Has a good dark body and the malt is not to sweet. One of the better ones Ive had from them. The smoked part is what gets me. I dont know if they used extract or not? I has the overwhelming taste of Liquid Smoke. I could see some people really digging this beer but once youve cooked with Liquid Smoke, the taste never really goes away."
"The beer pours an amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice pale and light crystal malt scent that is semi-sweet with some peated malt in there as well. The smoke aroma is mild, but noticeable. The taste is great. It has a smooth ""amber lager"" flavor with peated malts added for a mild smokey taste that is out of this world. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn fine rauchbier. I can't get enough of these beers anyway, but this one is good. It's an easy drink and it's an enjoyable one."
"Drinkable but more a BBQ/smoked meat beer than a session beer"
"The smell is very sour with a bit of sulphuric smoke. Lots of berries, but they seem to only make the smell worse. The taste contains a lot of DMS and sulphuric smoke that lingers forever. Lots of fruity bits, but nothing hides such a disgusting flavor. I've enjoyed every other beer I drank from Fort Collins, but this one is plant food."
"Funny note here. One of my cats jumped up and took a sniff of my drink (probably hoping it was milk). A couple tentative whiffs before one deep inhale. She looked like she was about to rub the edge of her mouth on the glass to 'scent it', but instead, she looked at me with danger in her eyes. One moment she stood on the destk glaring and the next she was turning the corner into the spare bedroom."
"Had this at the brewery yesterday. Appearance is a dark amber with some ivory foam, little lacing. Aroma screams SMOKE! - wood and pipe tobacco blended. Like burning leaves mixed with burnt sugar. Initial taste is of smoky biscuits, malt, crackers and not too much hops. Middle has bitter chocolate, burnt hamburgers and malts. Body is medium to light, with enough carbonation. Might be good with a barbecue meal, but on its own, I would pass."
"Flavor is smoke and caramel with a crisp finish that leaves a bit of smoke on my palate. A very smooth and easy to drink beer that isnt just smoke smoke and more smoke. tasty!"
"Pours a clear copper color with a small light tan head. Smell is of caramel and dry. Can't pick up much smoke in the nose. Taste is upfront sweet and thick. Subtle smokey notes really compliment the taste. The smokey notes remind me of smoked pork or jerky, not over the top smokey like some other examples. The body is pretty hefty for a lager. Very nice and drinkable. A nice session drinker."
"Medium in body, with a lively carbonation. This is built as a drinker, edged with smoke instead of drowned in it. As much as I enjoy the full strength rauchiness, this is a beautiful, restrained example. Incredibly food frendly."
"Quite easy to drink, though the phenolic presence is a bit distracting. Otherwise pleasant."
"Starts out with light sweetness, honeyed biscuit malt, and candied yams. Moderate smoke flavor comes in the middle, along with some spicy Germanic hops. Finish is bittersweet with lingering smoke. I really like the smokiness. Pretty big body for this type of beer; coats the mouth nicely too. I want to go to this brewpub!"
"Overall, this was similar to a lot of FCB's offerings (sweet and smoky and a little thin)."
"Coppery-reddish hue with a touch of tawny-brown highlights, this does have a lovely color, the slightly off-white head reached a modest half finger in height. The head retention was respectable; a soapy collar remained throughout consumption. Subsequent lacing was spotty and nominal. The bouquet lacks in potency. Upfront is a sweet, soft maltiness then a distant note of smoky peat emerges and towards the very end I could smell a suggestion of salty ham. The sweetness was a bit much for me to call the aromas inviting but the sweetness didnt repel me either. The first sip ended any concerns about the sweetness. The palate is simple but pleasant. Initially a lackluster maltiness slowly gives way to flabby ham and peat, a bit of sweetness, a little salty too. The smokiness is negligible and scarcely noticeable at the finish. This is a respectable Smoked Beer. It has all of the qualities of a lager, clean, crisp, and refreshing. The mouthfeel was decent, moderate carbonation but it is firm enough, medium in body. The flavors are complex enough for me to want to drink this again. I could match this up with simple BBQ, pulled pork sandwiches, or even burgers. This would be a good option for a local. I only purchased one 12-ounce single of this in Fort Collins; I could have got a six-pack of this one. While it is not groundbreaking it is worth trying, especially if you are curious to try a beer from FCB."
"I did polish off a 1.0 so obviously this brew was pretty damn drinkable!"
