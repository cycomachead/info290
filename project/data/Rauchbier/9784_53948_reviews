"D-really nice beer. Great food beer. I would drink this again."
"Wow, the taste is awesome, it's smokey but also very rich malty with a light hoppy/smokey finish. Very nice crisp an smooth mouthfeel with a dry finishthays really good. One of the best rauchbiers I've ever had."
"Its always nice to have a local version of this style. Its rich, satisfying and definitely something that you'll want to savor slowly and sparingly."
