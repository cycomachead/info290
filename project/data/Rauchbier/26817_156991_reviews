"This one's got the look that's perfect considering the style, with a sweet and chocolaty aroma. The flavor remarkable pulls off exactly as the name implies - it's very reminiscent of tobacco, oak smoke, and that sort of citrus flavor one gets from flavored cigars. The hops involved are somewhat herbal in nature, almost a touch of menthol hiding in there. One of the most unique beverages I've ever experienced."

"On tap at Freebridge Liquors in Phillipsburg, NJ.   Very small pour, but enough to get a good understanding of the beer.   This is my first experience with a Rauchbier, and I am a bit of a newbie to smoked beers in general, but this was very good.    An aroma(and to some extent, taste) of weed dominates this beer, there is very little orange flavor,  I found it at the back end, but if I wasn't looking it would have gone by unnoticed.   A very unique beer to me, and something I would make the effort to purchase on a regular basis if I had the chance."

"The concept is well executed and I loved it for that, but a couple will be enough. I like it much more than most smoked beers but you only get so many beers in your life."
"It seems I had a switched draft line; what I drank was more like a coffee stout and had neither orange nor smoke.  I was surprised at the time given the name, but now reading reviews I'm sure of it."
"Solid. But not much orange"

"Pours dark dark brown with a tan leathery head. Swisher, starts smokey and ends with a nice little citrus burst. Pretty interesting beer."

"From a fresh growler fill from the brewery. Orange zest but not in your face. Amazing beer but I personally think this beer shines on cask. Creamy, with peat notes and a body that gymnast."

"Fucking DANK. Orange is a really nice touch this year. Leather, weed, orange."
"Nice original smoke beer."

"I've had my share of the sticky icky before, in both blunt and non-blunt form, so I understand what Carton was trying to emulate with this beer. It just fell a little short for me. I feel it could be improved by dialing down the hops and boosting the smoked malts. Perhaps the thin body is its biggest flaw, so making it a little more full bodied would provide more support for all of the bold flavors it's trying to achieve. Two thumbs up to Carton for creativity, just not my favorite beer from them."
