4,1,4,4,4,4,4,"Nice - if only every lager had this much character! Well-balanced flavour with a good malty backbone. The smoke is obvious but not overwhelming. Well worth trying if you like smoked beers.","jazzyjeff13","Jan 30, 2012"
4.12,4,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Apparently this beer style is second to David Hasselhoff as far as being loved by Germans, intriguing… Served from bottle with a cork that had a moldy base into a Mikkeller oversized wine glass. Poured a massively dark brown basically black with a minimal khaki colored head. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, smoked malt, smoke, and ham. The flavor was of sweet malt, smoke, ham, milk chocolate, and dark chocolate. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. I can see why Germans love this style of brew as it is one of my favorites out there too. The smokey tones come through very nicely on this brew and are quite refreshing. I was quite concerned upon inspecting and smelling the cork. Note for future openers of beers with moldy corks; DO NOT SMELL IT! Really glad this didn’t translate into the beer at all. A definite must try if you get the opportunity to do so.","thagr81us","Jan 17, 2012"

The smell of the beer isn't heavily smoked which I personally like. There is a light hop aroma along with the roasted malts on the nose just beyond the smoke. The taste isn't overly smokey either, it's a got a strong hoppiness to it than anything else I think. Perhaps it's the bitterness from the dark malts I'm getting. The mouthfeel is lighter than I expected it to be. Overall it was pretty good, I'm not sure if I'd seek it out again.","Knapp85","Mar 30, 2011"

3.58,-9.6,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Beer is medium to light in body with a nice midpalate full of hickory smoke. The finish is mildly bitter and has an odd almost tannic quality to it. This is why I think the bottle was old, I think it may have been slightly corked. As the beer waremed up it got a little more bitter and started tasting like cork. The smoke and mild sweetness seemed to be unaffected by late corkiness but it did distract and detract from the overall experience of the beer.","drabmuh","Oct 05, 2010"
4,1,4,4,4,4,4,"Cool looking 25 oz bottle, rating this from memory. Pours a cola brown with a medium head. Quite smoky and malty in the nose, some European hops, a touch of bacon grease.

3.85,-2.8,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Flavor matches the aroma well, kicking up the hops and alcohol a notch but the malts are still on-point. Soily chocolate, peat, and smoke combine with a resinous, green ethanol presence on the finish. Very carbonated, perhaps too much so, with a warming note from the alcohol. Medium mouthfeel and somewhat dry on the palate. Overall, Dog Schwarz is a bit boozy to be drinkable, but this is easily one of Flying Dog's better beers.","wagenvolks","Beers"

3.96,0,3,4.5,4,4,3.5,"With a highly aggressive pour you get a momentary head of close to a finger but zero retention and soon enough the dark brown froth is all gone, no real lacing. Pitch black liquid, not even a hint of color to be found, the liquid does look pretty clean though. Caramel, molasses, brown sugar, lots of sweet wood smoke without any archness, raisin, cherry, currant fruit in keeping with the other scents, given the type of scents found, dry presence in your nostrils, dusty cocoa powder wins out in the end. Medium-bodied, bottom heavy with the weight it has, anchors itself on your tongue. The smokiness gets close to being salty, aided by elevated graininess and pumpernickel notes. As expected, chocolate, coffee, caramel and molasses the primary mover, dryness does not have a negative impact on the vibrancy of these flavors. With more sips a pork rind perfume develops. Carbonation trifling, hard to say if it even tries to motivate. Smokiness hard to wash out of the mouth which is, after all, the point. (Cork and wire)","farrago","Dec 29, 2009"

Pours black with a nice velvety dark tan head, size about two fingers that lingers around for a awhile. Nose is roasted malt with some smoke notes. First sip...upfront the flavors are roasted malt, raisons, some coffee, and a nice background smoke flavor. Mid glass the beer is less complex, mostly malt and smoke notes. The end of the glass and the smoke is in the front of the beer. The mouth is good, not to heavy with just the right amount of carbination. A good beer, excited to pour a second glass.","gosurfobx","Dec 02, 2009"

4.22,6.6,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Reviewing them side by side is the only sensible way to choose between Weizenbock and Dog Schwarz as the best of the Flying Dog Wild Dog series (of those that I've had so far).

Head quickly morphs into a swirly coat, with bubbles at the rim, with lasting sticky lace. Aroma is smoke and dark fruits.

It tasted like smoke and oak and peat and roasted coffee, with some burnt barley and a bit of molasses. It was fairly thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a bitter smoky aftertaste. Overall this had a nice rich flavor with great body. It had tons of smoke, of course, but it wasn't too overwhelming, and the peat flavors made this seem more like scotch. The alcohol was hidden quite well, but this is still more of a sipping beer due to the bold flavors. This beer would be perfect with a BBQ cookout.","Pencible","Aug 22, 2009"

4.1,3.5,4,4,4.5,3,4,"The excessive carbonation can be a bit annoying at first, luckily some persistent, aggressive swirling brings this down to a reasonable level. The initial, hard carbonation accentuates a burnt, roast vegetal note (that I find in some roasted grain / malt heavy beers) that is a touch off putting, but remains fairly light and does disappear as the carbonation does. In the end this beer is quite enjoyable, I like how the light smokiness makes this a rich tasting brew (even though the aroma is a touch too flat, though still enjoyable). Definitely another solid Wild Dog beer from this brewery.","Gueuzedude","Beers"

Sure, it tastes kind of like bacon, but like a good rauchbier, there's more to it. I'm reminded of the smell of cedar planks on the grill for a toasted wood flavor.

I personally would have liked to have had a bit more smoke in the taste but hey, that may just be me. On a side note, while I liked this for the most part, IMHO, this is not worth the $15-17 per bottle that most places are selling it for. They need to release this in six-packs and make it a fall release.","Kegatron","Apr 07, 2009"
4.85,22.5,4.5,4.5,5,5,5,"A good variant of the Rauchbier. Generally found in amber beers out of Bamberg, Germany, they create a mouthful of beef jerky and bacon.

Enough hops to keep it honest though, but just barely. Just a hint of smokiness through the finish. Excellent drinkability. ABV non-existant. Maybe the best Schwarzbier/Rauch I've had.

The taste was plein de smoke along with some fruit. Although a smooth mouthfeel, this one just isn't that drinkable to me. I do not like smoky beers and this one definitely isn't worth its $17 price tag. Go ahead and try this one if its free but you're better off not wasting your money.","deliriumfest","Jan 20, 2009"
4.52,14.1,4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Alcohol is masked nicely, letting the smoke, ham, sweetness and coffee intermingle and linger on the tongue. By far the best beer I've had from Flying Dog. A little overpriced, but worth the experience.","cbl2","Jan 19, 2009"

4.47,12.9,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a cloudy and opaque dark brown/black, thick tan head forms, drops some nice lacing, settles to a thick ring, great retention, looks real nice. Smell is awesome, very smokey, some caramel and biscuity malts, chocolate, roast, iron, very malty, light bit of spicy alcohol, perfect smokiness. Taste is similar, but also real nice, lots of smoke, caramel, roast, toasty malt, light fruit, raisins, some iron, real beef jerky smokiness, very clean flavour, really nice. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, buttery smooth. Great smoked beer, perfect amount and very drinkable. A real treat. Thanks Carl!","Viggo","Jan 10, 2009"
3.03,-23.5,4,3.5,2.5,3.5,3,"Appearance is good. Dark and smokey looking, with a decent head of tan bubbles. Smell is very smokey with a bit of dry malt and no really noticable hops. Taste is bacon grease... that is the only thing I can describe it as. Mouthfeel is pretty decent, low carbonation and medium in body. Drinkability is ok.","supercolter","Jan 06, 2009"
4.38,10.6,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I also have difficulty categorizing this beer. The label says it's a Smoked Double Lager, and calls it a Schwarzbier, but I have to agree with the previous reviewer and say that it is a Rauchbier. It's a dark brown color with beautiful red highlights. A thick tan head that left a bit of lacing. Once you catch a whiff, there's no doubt it's a Rauchbier. Very strong, but pleasant, smoke aroma. The smoke is less noticeable in the taste, where the malt predominates. Just an incredibly smooth beer, one that I want to get more of.","lordofthewiens","Beers"
4.47,12.9,4.5,5,4.5,4,4,""Second only to David Hasselhoff in the hearts of Germans, the Schwartz style was originaly brewed in the Eastern German state of Thuringia. Our brewers took this obscure black lager and sexed it up a little hoff-style by brewing a robust smoked double-schwartz."","sideshowrob","0"
