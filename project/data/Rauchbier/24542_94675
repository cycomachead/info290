3.12,-13.8,3.5,2.75,3.25,3.5,3,"This had me at its stylistic description: a rauchweizen.  Right on, right on.  It pours a mostly clear garnet topped by a finger of sandstone foam.  The nose comprises buttery biscuit backed up by a hint of beech smoke.  Hm.  The taste holds notes of cracked wheat, light orange zest, mild dry toffee, clove, and mild beech smoke.  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel.  Overall, this beer was a bit of a disappointment to me.  The smell is too vague for its own good, the smoke character is barely there, and the weizen character is subdued.  You can't see it, but my head is hanging a bit here...","TMoney2591","Nov 16, 2014"

3.65,0.8,,,,,,"A pleasant, and approachable version of this most heady of German brewing styles - the Weizen character as notable as the meaty smoke, for the most part.  Easy to drink, until the unchecked sweetness catches up to you, and you start to think about that as yet unused fire pit simulacrum you just procured.","biboergosum","Aug 02, 2014"

3.67,1.4,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.75,"O: This beer didn't seem as heavy on the mouthfeel compared to other Rauchbiers and I think this was because the beer is branded as a ""Rauchweizen"" and is brewed with a combination of wheat and barley malts. For this reason, it is rather drinkable.","metter98","Mar 25, 2014"

3.29,-9.1,3.5,3.25,3.25,3.5,3.25,"Served in a 0.3 liter stange, a murky, rusty brown color with a small beige head, minimal lacing. Bready, malty aroma, light roast. In the taste, caramel sweetness, bready malts, banana esters, honey ham. A little weird, but not necessarily bad. Medium body, and pretty easily drinkable, especially when paired with good German food. Decent overall, but not really worth a second visit.","Rifugium","Feb 28, 2014"

3.44,-5,4.25,3.25,3.5,3.5,3.25,"Flavors of charred malt, burnt caramel, somewhat nutty and lightly bitter in the aftertaste. Body was full, fairly smooth and creamy in feel. Left more of an impression of a roast malt brown ale. This was an odd one, couldn't really get into it though I love Rauchbiers across the whole spectrum.","emerge077","Jan 19, 2014"
3.47,-4.1,3.75,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"The initial taste is fairly neutral but the finish is strong--smoky with lots of wheat present. The body is thin and the carbonation elevated. The aftertaste is short lived and a bit sour. Interesting because it is different, but not enough to seek out. It's rare, so I would order if you find it.","smcolw","Jan 14, 2014"

3.32,-8.3,3.5,3.25,3.25,3.75,3.25,"Pours a murky orange-brown with a foamy orange-tan head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and smoke aromas. Taste is much the same with smoke and metallic flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of smoke bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer with some decent aromas and flavors.","UCLABrewN84","0"
