The taste is also smokey, leather, soy sauce and sweet. Palate it thin, low carbonation. The beer is lighter than you could expect, due to sweet character very drinkable.

4.01,13.3,3,4.5,4,3.5,4,"This one pours a light bodied milk chocolate brown with a billowing three finger, very carbonated and active mocha head. Like most of their 12oz bottles, this one appears to be a little too carbonated. The nose is full of chile pepper, leather, and peat. It's very intriguing. I'm glad it holds its own on the pepper front. The flavors are smoky, dry, leathery, has some bark to it, and earthy musty pepper. It's interesting. It's peaty. The peaty characteristic is it's greatest strength. It drinks lighter in body than you'd think, because of the carbonation. It's effervescent. Overall this was a nice smoked beer. It was pretty well balanced between the peat, earth, and pepper. Solid beer from De Molen.","aasher","Sep 22, 2012"

2.37,-33.1,4,2,2.5,3.5,1.5,"Smoked beer with chili peppers...what could go wrong? Dark brown in color with an off-white head. Intensely smokey with lots of roasted malt, mild char, and maybe a bit of dark chocolate. Interesting, the chili peppers aren’t all that strong. The smoke is just as strong on the palate is on the aroma. A touch of peat to go along with all the char and ash. Maybe even a bit of glue, a moderate spiciness, and some burnt nuts. Not very pleasant.","womencantsail","Jun 24, 2012"

3.99,12.7,5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"330ml bottle. ½ pint shaker glass. Enjoyed on jun´12. Pours dark amber in color, headed by dark beige, copious & rocky foam. Crown is lasting, creamy & flavorful. Shows aromas of roasted malts, burnt chocolate & peat smoked malts as well as roasted bacon & peppery hues. Subtle underlying floral notes. Sweet/sour flavor at first sip with intense burnt bread & smoky touch. Flavor seems to be smooth by roasted malts but spicy/smoky hues win the match. Suntuous bitter & kind oily palate. Medium body, moderate carbonation. Dry sour fruit/bitter finish. Odd beer!","GONZALOYANNA","May 29, 2012"

3.45,-2.5,4.5,2,4,3,4,"Looks-wise this gives the overall impression of a malted milk ball; dark, thick, chocolatey brown with a big, sandy, beige head. The aroma is mostly a hickory-like smoke, molasses, Band-Aids, a drop of honey, and unfortunately little else. However, the flavor is nice, and has a fair amount of nuance, although it's too try and thin to really savor. Lots of chocolate, some whisky-like smoke, dates, walnuts, and oak – rich and savory. As for the chilli? It's there, but it's very, very subtle – at first you just get its flavor, which integraes well with the smoke, but over time it steadily builds to a satisfying heat that warms the whole mouth. Pretty good, but imbalanced and just a little uninteresting – there are similar and much better beers available from Mikkeller, Black Isle, and Rogue.","soulgrowl","Jan 19, 2012"

4.22,19.2,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"It's funny: I came to the Local Option looking to try a different De Molen smoked beer, only to find it kicked and this one freshly tapped. Fair trade to me. It pours a dark black-brown topped by a finger of cream-white foam. The nose comprises campfire, smoked honey-baked ham, caramel and toffee. This is what I'm talkin' 'bout right here! Tasty. The taste brings in more of the same, with a lighter bit of toffee and more of a beech-leaning smoke, as opposed to the woodsier campfire of the smell. Still pretty tasty. The body is a light medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a slick feel. Overall, a damn fine bit o' smoky goodness. Good times.","TMoney2591","Oct 13, 2011"

More smoke, better smoke if you'd ask me as in the side by side Schlenkerla tasted more like an ashtray and the Rook & Vuur like smoked sausage. It has way more body, but of course a higher ABV as well. Looked great, when down easy.","johnnybravo","0"
