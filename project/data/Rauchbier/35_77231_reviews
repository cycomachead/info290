"Enjoyed in  snifter, this smoked bock pours a brilliant hazy copper with a firm white head and nice lacing.  Nose of smoked malts, caramel, raisins, and more smoke.  Flavors of sweet caramel up front, very rich, moderate smoke to the aftertaste with figs and raisins.  Alcoholic warming and lots of smoke.  With age the smoke dissipates, but still pretty strong with a goodly mouth feel, very wet but coating.  Decent, big, but decent."

"O- the smoke is big throughout, making it hard to drink the entire bomber. However it paired nicely with some brick cheese and summer sausage. I think this style is better tackled with some food. Overall, worth a try!"

"Atmosphere is okay. Nice foamy head, but no real lacing. Nose is roasty and bacony. Malt grains, smoked in peat, balanced with bitter and some odd sweetness. Overall, this is an okay quaff."

"great brew. High ABV and you can definetely taste it. I have not had any true Rauchbiers but this one tastes like a great cross betweens SA doublebock and Wee Heavy, which I freaking love. The smoke is there, not overpowering like in a wee heavy but enough to give the beer a nice flavor. I let this brew sit out 1 hour before I drank it and it was very tasty."

"O - A pretty darn good beer. I really view this more as a doppelbock w/ some smoke rather than a Rauch. Very suprised it's ranked as low as it is. Not quite as good as Sam Adams' Double Bock, but it's still a quality beer. Lot's of taste, lot's of power, and pairs well with food. Highly recommend for any fans of bocks/doppelbocks or extreme beers."

"O- Kind of a miss on this one. Not special."
""
"Pretty good overall, but a bit too sweet for my taste. I enjoyed the smoke though."
""
"Poured into ceramic stein. Allowed head to develop and stayed for a good while."
"Overall, a curious and unique melding of styles, but not of the caliber as the Schlenkerla rauchbiers."

""

"Overall: I probably wouldn't buy it again but sometimes the Sam single bottles are surprisingly good. Just not this one"

"Samuel Adams Cinder Bock is a very clear, dense, copper beer with a soft, fluffy, yellowed foam that has great staying power. It's mostly smoke in the aroma, but a tart malt is detected as well. It smells a touch sweet. It's very full bodied and smooth with a creamy, chewy finish. The flavor is much like the the aroma: smoke and tart malt. There's a slightly sweet, herbal flavor that's somewhere between cola and a cough drop. Smoke is the dominant flavor here. When combined with the malt, it comes off as umami. There's a sort of salmiakki aftertaste. This is reasonably bold and complex. It's a sipping beer with a lot of character. There are subtleties to it, but the overall flavor is quite bold."
"Not sure how old this is but I think batch - 1's smoke has faded."
"O- If I have to taste band aids this is the least offensive of the kinds but it grows stronger and stronger with each sip. I think there is a tasty beer in this bottle with nice hints of malt sweetness but it is well hidden in the loud salty bacon, band aid flavors. It was a bit to rough to finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, pretty good. It's also dangerously drinkable for nearly 10%."
"Overall: I really liked this beer. I actually happen to like peat smoked beer and it is very hard to find and this beer has a good balance of smoked peat and a caramelized malt that I love. I would buy again if I can find it."

"Overall – This is a rather enjoyable brew. It has a good blend of toast, smoke, sweet, nut and booze with a chewy and thick body that suits the flavors rather nicely."
""
""
""
""
"I poured this beer into a glass, it has a red amber color body with a 2' tan creamy head to it. The aroma is of a smoky, malty ness to it. The taste has a rich deep smoke flavor followed by a sweetness malt on the back of the tongue. The mouth feel is bold and full, it grips the taste bud very well with the smokyness and sweetness. Overall this is a really good beer, great flavor and balance. Great job Saumel adams."
""
"O: This beer definitely feels somewhat filling (like a doppelbock) but manages to hide its alcohol extremely well. It's a good selection if you want something that is like a meal in itself but isn't too smoky."
"Beer is heavy in body, with carbonation of medium intensity, leading to a slightly fizzy mouthfeel that foams up quickly, leading to a latter-half feel that is smooth and somewhat creamy. Ethanol can be felt in the nostrils and back of throat, which is somewhat disappointing given the malt intensity in this beer."
"Sweet smokiness all the way through from the nose through the taste, like backyard barbeque brisket that’s been smoking under coats of sauce all day. Nice creamy head, deep red color. Not a taste I’d want all the time but a good beer in that style. Sweetens dramatically as it warms."
""
""
"Overall, good beer but it could be a little less sweet."
"O - Was pretty surprised how easily this is to drink and the sweetness at the end. This has been one of the best bocks i have tried and if i saw this on tap i would venture to try it again. The smoke and initial taste on this is kinda strange but when the aftertaste hits it starts to become pleasant."
""
""
""
""
""
"Beer is medium in body, a little sweet, a little smoky, not over the top, a decent beer by my estimation. THe finish is nice as well, not dry. I'd consider having it again."
""
"O: a bit too smokey for my taste, but certainly not over the top for a rauchbier."

"Nice ruby color but no head to speak of. My main impression is that this is a very sweet Bock! The smell is sugary instead of smoky--not ideal--and the base beer is also too much caramel and booze for me. Nice hickory-beech smoke, but I would turn the sweet-sticky characteristics down a LOT before I would drink this beer again. Glad to see the attempt at the style, though!"
""
""
""
""
"In summary, a promising nose that leads to disappointment in the mouth. My best suggestion would be to dry it out some more by about 20% with additional noble hopping, so that the malts present less like a milk chocolate bar with a pile of cigarette ash on top. The breadiness that exists needs to be brought into the foreground and accentuated with the smoke. I'd give this one a pass unless you are morbidly curious what controlled cellaring smoke degradation would do for it."

"I poured from a bomber into a tulip, dark pour with a very large white head, light lacing. Ton of smoke on the nose. Lots of roasted, smokey flavors, thick and chewey. Full bodied, good carbonation, the 9% abv is well hidden. A very enjoyable rauch beer from SA."
"This was possibly my most anticipated of the single batch releases thus far, save for Verloren. Let's get our smoke on, shall we? This stuff pours a clear russet-amber topped by a finger of ashy cream foam. The nose comprises mild beech smoke, light caramel, and a twinge of cocoa. The taste is a surprising barrage of sweetness, with caramel, light cocoa, and buttercream melding with some mild-though-substantial booze to form a harsh assault on the tongue. Throughout, a vein of mild smoke pervades, a mixture of hickory and beech, but it never comes close to even matching the sweetness nor does it ever get to stand on its own. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation, a lightly syrupy feel, and a fairly dry finish. Overall, a decent rauchbier, but one that comes across too sweet and not-smoky-enough for its own good."

"I love a good smoked beer. This one is a dark amber color with an off-white head. Nice clarity. The aroma is fantastic....campfire...wood, smoke, charcoal, and some underlying roasty malts. Sweet at the foretaste, with more malt character. Great balance. This beer avoids the pitfalls of a lot of smoked beers...that is, it's not hollow, astringent, or acrid. It's a really enjoyable and well made smoked beer. Great body, and very easy to drink."
""

"Sorry, Jim. This is not my idea of a rauchbier proper. A bruiser of a bock, sure. A lot of flame, but no meatiness that I'd enjoy. It didn't blend."
""
""
"Overall, pretty rich and tasty. Would go great with cheese and snack foods."
""
"O: These SA small batch beers have been pretty damn hit or miss, haven't they? This was pretty bad, to the point where I couldn't finish it - hell, I needed something to clean my damn palate with just to get the taste of fart out of my mouth. On the plus side, it's a few tweaks away from being OK...so...uh...keep at it Sam Adams, I guess."
"This beer started out well but lost its lustre as consumption contunued. I'm not exactly sure what it is ... perhaps the yeast? I'm not a fan of belgian beers and this seemed to have some of those belgian taste qualities. I certianly don't get any ""rauch"" flavors as the style catagory would suggest."
""
"O:I had it with marshmallow. Makes sense, right? Smoky cmpfire beer and a marshmallow? Don't you judge me."
"Not a bad beer from what I'd consider an overrated brewer. Loose around the edges, but not a bad beer. High ABV that's reasonably well hidden. You can smell and taste the ABV, but it kind of sneaks up on you. Overall, between average and good."
""
""
""
"Pours a two finger cream head that fades to a ring leaving some lace. Nice crystal clear amber color. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Smoky nose and flavor is sweet peat and some smoke. Would go well with a barbeque. Higher ABV is hidden. $7.00 for a 22oz bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
""
""
"Wonderfully creamy and smooth mouthfeel. Overall, a really tasty beverage but not quite smoky enough for me to consider this a true Rauchbeer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall. Probably a bit much, but a good overall beer. Nice one Sam."
""
""
"Overall- Interesting beer. I could not see myself drinking alot of this but it was definitely worth trying."
""
""
""
""
""
"6/9/13 update - aged a second bottle for nearly a year. Hasn't changed very much, perhaps a little less smokiness and heat. Balance is very good. Give it another .05 - .10 overall."
""
"Beautiful dark amber color in the glass with an off white head that settles to a thin layer of film with some lace. The aroma is a bit light but I do get a solid caramel malt base with a touch of sweetness on top of that, reminiscent of ripe fruit. The whole thing is tied together by a touch of light smokiness, not a campfire smoke but a nice sweet smokiness. The taste is sweet bready malt somewhat thick with a bit of the alcohol apparent. The smoke is right there too my first thought was of bacon or at least the smell and taste of smoked bacon, that thought fades but only slightly as the meaty character does persist. This is a pretty thick beer as the carbonation is low and it has a drying smoky finish with the evident alcohol. Overall this is definitely interesting. I'm not a huge fan of rauchbiers but the smoke in this one is balanced pretty well with by a good malt character and the high alcohol content seems to help too. If only the smoke character wasnt as meaty I think this beer would be more enjoyable."
"I think this would go good with some ribs and cornbread. Definitely not something to quaff, more of a sipper to go along with a nice dark Churchill on the deck."
""
"A good starting spot, with some smaller improvements this could be really good."
""
""

"RJT"
"GOOD, NOT MUST HAVE!"
""
"Mouthfeel: This is a very smooth and easy drinking beer but it has a richness to the mouthfeel that makes it even better drinking than a lot of bocks that tend to be on the heavy side."
""
"O: While I am not one to leave a glass unemptied, I am not terribly impressed. this is nothing I would seek out again in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, this is a solid smoked beer to drink for a while if you’re in the mood for the style."
""
""
"decide to try something different with this review . since there is two suggested glasses i thought it would be fun to try this beer in both glasses mug and stange . appearance is the same , for aroma i prefer the aroma in the stange and for the taste and mouthfeel there is no difference . i cannot wait to try the other beers in this same batch series from sam adams"
"O- not too shabby, but overall, not something I'd buy again"
""
""
"Full-bodied, warming, lightly effervescent. Warming up improves this beer a lot, really allowing the smoke to come out. Moved the smell and taste scores up 1/2 point each because of it, though they are still down from the competition."
""
"This was the most unusual (and unpleasant) flavor I have ever tasted in a beer. Way too smoky for my taste. While I love many of the Sam Adams varieties, this beer is among my least favorites. I would definitely not recommend this one. The ABV at 9.4% is enticing but the flavor is a turn-off."
""
""
""
"D - Nicely done, it is a touch too sweet for my taste and this element becomes a bit cloying towards the end. However, the smoke is nice and the dark malt works well with it. Not quite Schlenkerla, but a good attempt."
"Overall: sweeter than others I have had which doesnt really balance the beer but makes it different from others I have had in the genre."
"Kind of forgettable for the style. Pretty much what one would expect from reading any reviews of rauchbier, but not really a great example of the style. The high abv for such a low price helps out, but really not even a good introductory beer for the style. Certainly NOT a session beer."
""
""
"O - A strange beer but still enjoyable. I bet this will pair well with rich cheeses. Couldn't drink this on a regular basis, but would make a nice session beer in the middle of winter."
"Poured a 1.5"" rusty beige head of medium life. The body is burnt umber brown in masstone but a nice deep amber held to the light. It smells of rich malt and mild smoke. Then the taste flips that around with medium rich malt and dominant smoke. I've had a few other smoked beers and while others have that deep porter-like belly satisfaction this one I find more of a refreshing easy drinking version. I quite liked it, and it's one of the better limited release experiments from the makers of Sam, so I don't quite get why it didn't score better with others."
""
""
""

""

"Overall I enjoyed it, but I would definitely only drink about 6-8 ounces of it, before it became sickly sweet. Worth a try though. Cheers!"
"Nice effort from Sam Adams. It has all the makings of a great smoked beer but this thick and oily 9.45 ABV brew is just a bit too much for my tastes."
"O: Overall strong malt presence, mid level amount of smokiness, more malty sweet, generally easy to consume with a alcohol that will creep up on you."
"Poured into a large brandy snifter. Pours clear dark amber with a tall, biege head that dissipates at a moderate pace. Some lacing is left on the side of the glass as the head dissipates. Some bubbles can be seen rising from the bottom of the glass. Not much head is left at the top after dissipation. Mild smokiness hits the nose up front. There are sweet malts and some hops in the aroma as well. The smokiness is more intense in the flavor than it was in the aroma. It has a sweet malt background with spicy hops. It's well balanced with some alcohol taste. Even for 8.4%, the flavors are balanced enough to prevent this from tasting too boozy. I find I get used to the smokiness as I continue drinking this beer. The body is medium to full with adequate carbonation to liven this beer. The drinkability is high for a high ABV sipper. The beer is smooth. Overall, this is a great beer. I haven't tried many examples of this style, but I've been looking for a reason to like this style and explore it more. Good job for helping me on my journey, Boston Beer."
"D - Very drinkable. Nice Rauchbier with some good smokey flavor and enough body to balance out the flavors."
""
"It pours well and looks great. The aroma is extremely inviting. The mild hop leaves for an interesting aftertaste, but the nose is a faint spicy smoke, the taste is of a campfire, and the finish is a complementary heavy earth note of toffee and maybe roasted nuts before that touch of hop aftertaste finally kicks in."
"This is clearly the best out of the bunch of Limited release beers this year that I've had so far (haven't had The Vixen or Third Voyage yet). I wish it had more smoke, more on a Schlenkerla level. I would buy this year round if it were in 6 packs. Great beer! Highly recommended."
""
"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours crystal clear reddish copper color with a nice 2 finger dense cream colored head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Some decent spotty lacing on the glass, with a good amount of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of caramel, wood, smoked meat, molasses, raisin, biscuit, earth, pepper, herbal, and toffee. Very nice aromas with nice balance and complexity. Taste of caramel, smoke, wood, toast, molasses, raisin, prune, earth, pepper, toffee, biscuit, and herbal spiciness. Lingering notes of smoke, wood, molasses, caramel, raisin, bread, toast, earth, and herbal on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic balance of smoky flavors with the fruitiness and malts. No cloying sweetness at all, fairly clean on the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a fairly creamy and slick mouthfeel that is quite nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a warming present on the finish. Very smooth to sip on. Overall this is a damn nice smoked Doppelbock. Great flavor balance and smoothness. I really have no complaints on this one. Really well done and very enjoyable."
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
""
""
""

"Fortunately the base beer is good after the smoking; the rauch adds little to the experience."
"Overall: I liked this much more than I thought I would, and it would be a great choice for the cellar."
"D: This was a very nice rauchbier that had plenty of character, but not over-the-top smoke. The scent and taste were nicely balanced, and the body was excellent. The alcohol was well hidden, and the finish was smooth, so it was very easy to drink. Perfect beer for a cookout or camping. Recommended."
""
"Taste is somewhere in between a SA Chocolate Bock and a Shiner Smokehaus. Just waaay to sweet for this kind of style...hell, any style really. One could only dream it would be like a Schlenkerla Urbock, but that is not even in the same galaxy, not to mention ballpark. I have been moderately impressed with whatever this series of 22 oz beers BBC has been putting out lately (Tasman, Griffins Bow, Dark Depths, etc..), but this one is the bottom of the dung heap for me. Too sweet, overly sweet, not enough smoke and did I mention ridiculously sweet? Dont think I can finish one on my own...Im afraid I might wake up with type I diabetes."
"Pours a dark reddish copper color with a hlaf finger head which recedes to edging and leaves little to no lace. The aroma is of caramel malts and a hint of smokiness. The aroma of the smokiness gets stronger as the beer warms. The taste starts off with a caramel malt taste. The middle has the taste of toffe, brown sugar, and dark fruits. The very end of the beer is smoke, again the smokiness gets stronger as the beer warms. The mouthfeel is sticky and lowly carbonated. Overall it was an okay beer, it seemed to be more of a bock than a rauchbier. The smokiness is more subdued than what I expected."
""
"O - Highly enjoyable. A great hybrid. (rauchbier/double bock)"
""
"Note: Dopplebock/Rauch Light"
"The taste was surprisingly more of the same. I wasn't aware it was going to be a smoky beer. All I knew is it would be a bock. I mean, it had a goat on it and rauchbier isn't something I've heard of before. The beer is VERY sweet, VERY malty, and definitely smoky. But not at all overly so. It smells a bit like it might be peat-smoked even though there's no indication that it is, but that would explain that garbage smell. So would highly fermented malt heaviness, though, I suppose. This beer has a lot of doppelbock qualities. It doesn't taste like what the description of rauchbier describes. The smokiness is not too upfront and well balanced with sweet maltiness. The name and flavour would indicate to me that this is part doppelbock, part rauchbier. I'd say it's more on the doppelbock side, but that's just me. Damn if the combination isn't delicious as hell. Love the big malty sweetness of it, even if it is a bit sticky, almost cloying. Love the alcohol burn. And love that unique flavour added by the rauch (smoke). I would HIGHLY recommend this to other lovers of big, sweet beers."
""
""
"Too much smoke IMO so I can easily say it was not balanced at least for me. Thankfully this is a big beer so it can take a few lumps, good to sip but there is no way I could see finishing this bottle off during a long session. Asking you to try it would be a dare if you are not into smoked beers, even if you are it might be a challenge."
""
""
"Appearance is a warm carmel color. Not opaque. The aroma is a strong bacon odor, very smoky. Good lacing and a nice settled head. Taste is a sweet smoke flavor with a hint of cinnamon. The texture is a little syrupy but not overbearing. Would pair nicely with a banana creme brulee or anything with bacon. I liked the beer but it is a little too smoky for my tastes."
""
""
"22 oz poured into pilsner glass. Appearance is a dark copper with a decent head thatdinished to about 1/4 inch. Good lacing. The smoke stands out first in the aroma but is definitely not overwhelming. It's followed by toffee and maybe some kind of spice. Tastes very pleasant and surprisingly smooth considering the abv. The smoke is very subtle which is nice and the beer is well balanced. I usually don't like smoky beers this much because they're always too smoky but this beer was very well done."
""
"o: I appreciated the subdued smoke which didn't overwhelm a top-notch d-bock. Excellent offering at a reasonable price."
"Overall, a tasty bock. Easy to drInk. I like the smokiness.!no alcohol present. Nice."
""
""
""
"Overall: A solid brew. There isn't really much to say. The masking of the high alcohol is impressive. Another solid Sam Adams beer."
"Again, I haven't had too many rauchbiers so I don't know what to look for, but I found this brew pretty enjoyable. This was a nice ""gateway"" beer for the style, so I think that I'll need to add more on to my ""beers to drink"" list."

"From the 22 fl. oz. bottle, Batch no. 1. Sampled on April 23, 2012. It was served at about 47-48 degrees Fahrenheit. It pours an attractive medium to dark amber with ruby red highlights flickering in the light along with a long lasting, foamy beige head. There are caramel and other malts on the nose along with an inviting smokiness, light yeast, and a touch of alcohol. The body is medium to bold. The taste is just as smoky as the aroma with a full bitterness, well-integrated alcohol, and and a near dry ending. A likable beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - first off I love rauchbiers so this one was right up my alley. The flavor was awesome, the body was spot on, and the aroma was very inviting. Almost equal to the German rauchbiers. Highly recommended!"
""
"O: I've had better Rauchbiers in my life, but this was still quite good. The Sam Adams taste profile worked well in this setting."
"DOA"
"In order for me to give a perfect score in any category of a beer I have to be wowed and in awe of it and I gotta say I was both in the pour of this beer.Poured a rich deep bronze with a perfectly formed cremay one finger light tan head that has held thru the duration,just perfect color and definition and creaminess in the head.The aromas don't bring so much promise with some hardwood smoke and mild sweetness.That creamy head translates in the feel with a creamy coating feel,very nice.A nice mix of sweet caramel and anise flavors and more subtle upfront smoke,the smoke plays a larger role in the finish.Hey I love this hybrid,the smoke is somewhat assertive as is the doppelbock toasty sweetness and warming notes,I loved it!"
"Medium body, with lower carbonation. Alcohol is hidden well. While not overly smoky, the base dopplebock here is really good. Well made."
"Boston Beer Company did a credible job with Cinder Bock. My hopes were honestly not all that high. It’s a pretty decent collision of a Rauchbier and a Doppelbock. The smoke and malt flavors seem to fight for space. If the smoke flavor were a little lighter, the problem would be solved. Not a bad beer though. If you’re into smoky beer, check it out."
"I like that Samuel Adams is experimenting with smoked malts and I hope they do more. I like their rauchbier and hope maybe they'll do a smoked porter. This beer is very well made, adventurous, and thoughtful beer. I would prefer more smoke malts and maybe less alcohol, but an enjoyable taste nonetheless."
"Just ok for me... I didn't dislike it, so don't get me wrong here. I just.... felt like it could have been a lot better? Not enough smoke for my tastes..."
""
""
"Pours a clear, amber color. 5/4 inch head of an off-tan color. Great retention and good lacing. Smells of smoke, sweet malt, hint of pale malt, hint of caramel malt, and a hint of hop. Fits the style of a Rauchbier. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of smoke, sweet malt, slight roasted malt, hint of pale malt, hint of hop, hint of caramel malt, and slight alcohol. Overall, good smoke blend: good aroma, body, and feel."
""
"Overall- A very sweet and almost dessert-like Rauch. I agree that this one has very little that reminds me of a bock, I suppose the uber-maltiness could make a case for it, but after the smokiness has had its way, those qualities have morphed into something completely different. I really enjoyed this beer, and would have it again."
"Amber pour with a very thick tan head that recedes to a thick lasting cap. Aroma of sweet smoke and caramel malt. Lots of thick, broken lacing. Tastes pretty much like the aroma - smoke and sweet caramel. Smooth a drinkable, smoke is not over bearing, which I like. Another Very good offering from the small batch series."
""
"Pours a clean reddish to amber color with a light tan head. In the aroma, small fruitiness and a note of smoke. In the taste, mostly fruity, and a small smoke that gets larger as it warms up. A smooth and medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a dry fruitiness in the aftertaste. More fruit presence than smoke, it is just ok though."
"Pours a clear, dark mahogany with a thick, fluffy and rather persistent pale tan head. Malty aroma has a strong yeasty overtone and a hint of - is that beef jerky? Flavor has a malty core with tones of smoke, barbecue and caramel and a hint of yeast. It's almost like drinking a well-smoked sausage. (Ugh - I'm a vegetarian, but this is beer!) Smooth texture has above average body and some decent fizz. Like barbecue? Try this one!"
"Pours a stunning deep red color with a tiny head. Aroma is malty and smoky, with just a bit of alcohol popping up. The taste is actually ... well-balanced? The smokiness really takes the sweet edge off of what I'm assuming is a fairly similar recipe to their Imperial Series Double Bock. I can still taste the sweetness, but it's not cloying like I found their double bock. The mouthfeel is on the heavier side of medium-bodied, and the drinkability is pretty alright. Overall, it's a solid smoked beer that's a good break from the smoked porters and lagers that dominate the market."
"Alcohol ends up being more of an issue in the feel than the flavor (where it's well masked), not quite going so far as to impart astrincency but close enough to detract. Otherwise thos doppel has a pretty big body with some smoothness to it, and depth is no issue."
""
""
"Poured into a shaker pint glass. Pours a medium coppery amber. Fine two finger light tan head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of light malt and smoke. Flavor is roasted and caramel malt, sweet dark fruit with a nice smoke overlay. Finish is malt and smoke. Very nicely integrated. Medium to heavy bodied with pleasant creaminess. Nicely balanced and enjoyable."
"Overall: A pretty nice double bock with smoked flavor enhancements. The smoke is a complimentary flavor instead of overpowering everything, and I think it works pretty well. It didn't feel as strong as the ABV."
"Overall this brew does a good job of mixing the Rauchier and Bock styles. Watch out for the 9.45 ABV content because it will hit you at the end of the glass."
""
""
"O: Another one that surprises me from sam adams. Pretty good and I'll be looking for more of these specialties."
"The body was average, perhaps a bit thin for my tastes, for a Bock. Drinkability will depend on your tolerance for the smoke. If you like it, you'll find this beer very drinkable, if not not as much. Overall, a good, solid brew that's worth a shot if you see it. I'm happy to see a large brewery like BBC stepping out and making some of these lesser known styles available to a wider audience. Congrats to 'em!"
"Pours a rich brownish color, sticky lacing of slightly off white foam. Aroma is earthy, smokey, sweet and strong. In the flavor, caramel, toasted and smoked malts are all apparent right away. Decent bready notes that give it that Bock-ish style. There is a mild spicy hop and spicy alcohol flavor. Still, remains smokey all the way through with some bbq/smoke cured meat flavor. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, a little slick but well carbonated. Overall, a good strong smoked beer, it will kick your ass though."

"Overall, I'm torn because this is a unique beer - or at least I've never had the style. I'm glad I tried it, and it was interesting. But the look and mouthfeel were disappointing. I love BBQ, but maybe not in a beer, I guess."
"Pours reddish brown with thin ring of white foam. Some lacing. Smoky smell, notes of bacon/firewood. Flavor opens with a campfire smokiness and slowly fades into a sweet malty taste. Some toffee/caramel underneath. Good carbonation - tasty, smokiness is a touch strong and gets to be a bit much at the end."
""

"O: The taste was very disappointing after a nice aroma. The beer is too sweet and boozy. I wish the bready malts and smokiness was turned up quite a bit and the sweetness was turned down a lot."
"Overall, I quite like this and have found this new series from BBC to be quite impressive."
"Smoky flavors up front with a hint of cooked vegetables. Sweet malts fill in and take over mid-palate. Caramel, cookie dough, and rummy fruits mingle. Charred, smoky, woody flavors near the finish. Lingering smoke and caramel. Full bodied, syrupy feel. Slightly warming. Overal a very tasty mix of smoke and sweet."
"Ok. Like the combination, but not sure it works very well. This is one that I would have to wait a while before having again. Worth a try."
""
"Carbonation resides on the low side and it has a body somewhere between medium and full, it's almost a bit sticky. Overall I would say this beer is quite good, I enjoyed it thoroughly."
"Taste begins with rich malt sweetness, tannins and some smoke in the middle, and a dry alcoholic close. Mouthfeel is pretty slickery, and drinkability is okay. Wanted more smoke, but not everyone wants Schlenkerla levels like me. Anyways..."

"O: One of Samuel Adams' better creations. Well made and eminently drinkable."
"It's fair game to say that Doppebocks are among the earliest examples of ""extreme"" beers. If so, then this Sam Adams example makes ""extreme"" out of ""extreme"" by boosting the alchols up a few degrees and weaving in the smoky elements of traditional Rauchbiers. Still, I would prefer the beer to demonstrate a drier and toastier body like Ayinger Celebrator or a more succulent sherry-like version of Weihenstephaner Korbinian because the molasses sweetness in Cinder Bock gets a little one-dimensional and ""Americanized"" for me."
"Yet another well-made strong beer from Boston Beer. A little pricey at $8.99 for the 22 oz bottle."
"Overall: Better than it's bonfire predecessor but just like that beer this one does have a purpose besides making your face squirm, I would definitely use it in a marinade which it probably would excel in. I have had worse beers in my life but with the label of Sam Adams this is by far at the bottom of the list. If I had a slogan it would be ""looks good taste morbid"""
"Either way, at $4.99 this is a really affordable bomber and well worth the money spent."
"Overall: A pretty solid take on a Rauchbier. The smoke is very noticeable but not overwhelming and blends well with the malts."
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Pretty nice feel, and it does drink lighter than ~9.5% ABV. Very flavorful but it stays reasonably drinkable. Pretty good rauschbier. Admittedly I'm notl experienced with this style, but this beer is pretty nice and not over the top in smoke flavor, which I appreciate."

"o - Overall a nice rauchbier. The nose is a little one dimensional but the taste is really nice; it's lightly smokey and fruity. Would have it again."
"The beer pours a deep red color with a tan head. The aroma is definitely that of a smoked beer. I get a ton of meaty BBQ-like smoke, as well as a little bit of roasted malt. The flavor follows suit. There are a lot of burnt malts, as well as as good dose of smoke and a little bit of sweetness from the toffee or caramel malt. Still, this beer is all about the smoke and it definitely delivers on that front. I don't get any alcohol, which is surprising since the beer is nearly 10 percent. Medium, creamy mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Overall – not a bad tasting brew at all, and decently interesting to sample."
"My first encounter with a Rauchbier. It's intriguing, but the alcohol was a little overpowering and the metallicy aftertaste was a turnoff."
"The ABV totally killed what would otherwise be a nice bock. Noticable alcohol flavor and burn; just not needed."
"Overall, a nice and drinkable beer, especially at this ABV and for this style. The rauchbier notes are not overdone at all, but they could be a bit more, however they blend nicely with the bock notes. Nicely done and good for the price. Not sure if I would get it regularly, but definitely something I'm glad I tried."
"A decent, if not strong Rauch beer. The smokiness is not too overpowering to still get a decent idea of this beer's bock backbone. However, I'm finding it to be getting a bit too sweet as I get further through this brew."
""
"This is a very dark copper-brown beer, with a small head that fades away to nothing at all very shortly. Smokiness comes through in the nose, sharply phenolic, without much maltiness. The taste on the other hand, is very heavily malty, together with harsh fusel alcohol notes. Smoke is certainly present, but this beer lacks the superbly tasty smokiness of the classic Schlenkerla. It would be better represented in a less strong beer, I think."
"It's nice and clear in the glass with not enough head. Maybe the next (warmer) glass will be even better. I would recommend this for comparing with Heller-Trum, THE rauchbier. It is real close."
"Overall, I like the beer, despite my problems with the style. The smoke notes here are still too strong for my tastes, but they are nicely balanced (except in the aftertaste) by lovely, sugary dark fruit esters, and for most of the mouthful neatly complement the brew. So well made is the beer that even subsequent mouthfuls don't lose their potency or nuance, assuring a smooth drink for the entire bottle. Worth trying."
"O-At the end of it the flavor was too off for it be enjoyable, their Bonfine Rauch was better than this."
""
"O: Judging it as a Rauchbier, it's definitely up there. I can imagine trying to get the right balance of smoke, sweet, and bitter can be tricky."
""
"Enjoyable, medium-bodied. Maybe a little on the sweet side. I liked it."
"O - This has good drinkability. It has nice flavor, and I could easily have a few pints of this. Overall, I think this is a solid beer and a nice example of the style. The booze is well hidden for being as high as it is. I just think this is a nice and interesting beer. I recommend trying it out. I would buy it again."
""
"I was a little wary on this one because I don't get into rauchbiers too much, but this was definitely a balanced and deliciously pleasant surprise. Pick it up if you're looking for a unique and tasty beer."
"A very interesting rauchbier creation. I didn't find the smokiness particularly noticeable in the taste (like some of Bamberg's best rauchbier offerings), but the complex taste and exceptionally smooth mouthfeel makes this beer stand out, to me. No, this isn't a Schlenkerla, but this is its own unique take on the rauchbier style."
"Overall: This may be my favorite Sam Adams brew. This beer is a combination of two styles that really do not combine within the brew, but take separate turns at being excellent.The rauchbier aspect is dead on--similar to Aecht Scherlenkerla's Urbock--and the dopplebock that follows almost has more of a sweetness that I associate with an English barleywine. The alcohol is scarily barely noticeable. This one is right up there with the best I have had this year. I would not take this over Scherlenkerla's Urbock or Marzen, but for a cheaper US treat, I would stock this on a regular basis."

"D: im a sucker for smoke and this brew does not disappoint. smokey-sweet flavors makes for one of the biggest rauchbiers i have ever had."
"Not bad but uninteresting overall. Not much complexity and a bland smokiness, rauchbiers are not known to be easy drinking but a bomber of this solo is a haul."
"I approve."
""
""
"I enjoy this rauchbier. You might too. It's not an authentic German example but it comes really damn close and ups the ABV in the process!"
""
""
"Prost!"
"Overall I like these new additions to Sam Adams, they are kind of fun and different from the normal offerings. This one is another nice addition to the group."
""
"O: a good choice - not a heavy beer, but with some kick (abv-wise) - smooth drinking and enjoyable"
"This is one I will be again and put some away for later on"

"Beer is a bit thick with very little carbonation."
"Overall this is an enjoyable beer-- I don't think I'd choose it as an example of a bock. But regardless of its strict adherence to a particular style-- it's still an enjoyable beer for it's perhaps offbeat whim of smoke."

"22oz bottle purchased at Shaw's in North Hampton. Pours a amber-red crystal-clear body with a good inch of khaki-colored head that sticks to the sides of the glass leaving some rather nice lacing. Smoke, banana, and nut waft from the aroma. Wood/smoke, banana, nut, and caramel hit the palate. Full bodied with moderate carbonation. Definitely a bit of a sipper, but Damn tasty and definitely disappears before I wish it had."
"overall: I'm pleasantly surprised. Interesting experiment, well executed, and more importantly, a tasty brew."
"I would recommend splitting the bottle with a buddy though as the flavors are pretty massive and intense and can wear ya out."
"Overall, an interesting and great tasting beer."
"Poured into a 16 oz Stella glass. Pours a mahogany with a fluffy white 3 inch head, leaves some lacing. I will be honest not a beer I am familiar with. Smell smoked peat. Taste is just as aggressive, unfortunately I can't get anything else out of it. This is one of those styles, that amazes me it has a following."
"3.5 D: Really good looker and smeller. After that, it's still a decent beer."

"O: This is far from my favorite Samuel Adams offering. Perhaps if the presence of smoked malt were a little more noticeable, this beer would be a winner, but as is, it's a bit rough. Maybe I just don't like the way Samuel Adams handles bocks, but this is not what I typically look for in the style."

"O: Another solid hybrid-style beer from SA. You definitely get both bock and rauch characters, and they combine to make a surprisingly good overall beer"

"Tried a little bit of a sample at the EBF. The beer poured out looking really nice. It has a red color with some shaded of brown in it. The smell of the beer is super smokey. The taste of the beer is too smokey I think. I wasn't digging this ones flavor too much. The mouthfeel was surprisingly heavy I thought. Overall this beer was didn't go over too well with me mainly because of the flavor. I prefer the Bonfire Rauch that came in the Autumn variety pack more."
"Poured from a bottle into a stemmed pilsner, the beer is a bright, crisp, slightly hazed chestnut-auburn coloring with a thin, small bubbled, off-white head that rests a very low eighth of an inch. Aromas of campfire charcoal and darkly sweet caramel flood the nose. The beer carries the smoked qualities directly into the taste, with a meaty and charcoal burst of flavors on the forward tongue, followed by more subtle and sweet characteristics, including carmel and toffee. Very smooth and almost creamy in mouth, the brew has a subtle aftertaste of toffee and cream, with just a hint of smoke. The finish is quick for the most part, with a bit of the smokey ""residue"" remaining on the roof of the mouth and the back of the tongue. Good venture into the world of Rauchbier for BBC. Not a bad beer at all."
