"I mean.. It's the strangest beer ever. It's pure smoked meat on the nose, and the taste is salty, smokey dark German ale. Very odd."
""
""

""

"Overall: What a great beer, gotta try this one with some good BBQ- can't imagine it could get much better than that."
""
""
"Overall - I used to think all rauchbiers tasted like campfires, but my palate has shifted and I must say I love this beer.  4.5 paws."
""
""
"Smooth almost creamy mouthfeel with thin carbonation but just enough dryness at the end."
"This beer is very good and one of my favorite smoked beers, but one of myfavorites in general."
"O = I like to imagine myself having one of these in a wooden stein as I sit in front of a roaring fireplace in an old world tavern.  Rich, decadent and meaty, this is the perfect cold weather beer, and a perfect companion for BBQ and smoked meat.  My first example of a rauchbier, I will be searching out more examples of the style in the future."
"Yum!  Smokey and a little sweeter than their usual release.  Best enjoyed in the hallway at the Schlenkerla while sitting at a table and watching the tourists come and go in a great rush!"

"As a sidenote, I gave a 1/3 to my friend who doesn't usually venture away from pale lager. His first reaction was ""wow, it tastes of bacon!"" He seemed to like it though, so take from that what you will. Personally I really enjoyed it, although the powerful flavour would make it difficult to get through much more than half a pint in one sitting."

"Paired with Wisconsin Extra Sharp Cheddar and Garlic Salami"

"0.5l 06/2015. Pours a bright, dark, ruby brown with a creamy tan head which lasted well and left some excellent lacing. Aroma of smoked bacon and charred wood. Medium sweetness and lots of different smoky flavours. Medium full body. Smooth texture. It was like drinking a packet of 'Cheese & Bacon Ball' which I found quite off putting initially but quite enjoyable by the end. 8."

"All that fun beer talk aside, tastes like good smoked Italian meat made out with a bock beer."
""
"500 ml bottle into pine glass, no bottle dating. Pours slightly cloudy deep reddish brown color with a 2 finger dense and rocky light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice dense soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of huge wood smoke, caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, oak, light chocolate, light char, herbal, and oak/smokey earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, smoke, and earthy hop notes; with great strength. Taste of big wood smoke, caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, oak, light chocolate, light char, herbal, and toast/smokey earthiness. Light herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of wood smoke, caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, oak, light chocolate, light char, and herbal/smoke earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity and balance of dark/bready malt and smoke flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Very clean on lager flavors as well with zero estery notes present. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and fairly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely incredible rauchbier style. All around outstanding complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt, smoke, and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth to drink. A highly enjoyable offering."

"Rich russet brown, fluffy off-white head. Maple bacon gristle, BBQ smoke deliciousness. Sweet malt and smoky goodness."
" It poured a dark but clear copper/brown with a massive foamy head. The pungent smell of bacon, beef jerky and smoked Gouda hits your nose! I can understand how it would be a turn off, but for me it worked. The taste was surprisingly malty and sweet. However, the finish has a bitter, dry and smoky finish which lingers in your taste buds. A very robust, full bodied and filling beer; one is quite enough. Overall, I would have this one once in a while and with a hearty meaty meal. I'm glad I tried it and I hope to get to know more of this style."

"Smoke beer not my thing"
""
"Edit: had on tap 12/28 - smoke more pronounced in taste, but I am not sure how old the keg is (likely not a popular beer at the location I was having it).  Will keep my review as is."
""
""
""
"This is a great smoky beer. Very drinkable. Beers like this remind me that I need more imports."
""
"A perfectly integrated Rauchbier.  This is truly how the masters of the style integrate such pronounced flavors into an almost delicate, and certainly delectable beer.  Really, really fantastic.  If I rated this only to style, it might earn 5.0s across the board."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I prefer the Märzen over this without question. It's lighter on the palate and more drinkable. My least favorite so far from a brewery with otherwise world class beers."
"great with spicy lamb pizza."
""
""
""
"This beer pours a beige fine thick stable foam and a dark brown body. Smell is smoke. Taste is smoke as well but with a great malty backbone. It is like eating smoked pork on a slice of bread. Even better if you combine with pork. If you dig smoke in your beer and like malt, it doesn't get better than this one"
""
""
""
"Wow.  The appearance isn't particularly special, but everything else is.  The smoky aroma fills my nose, with subtly sweet accents.  The smoke isn't overpowering, but it is very present.  The flavor is led by the wonderful liquid smoke, which just seeps into my mouth.  Layered throughout is that subtle sweetness, which is mostly present on the back end.  Very low bitterness.  Given the flavors it is also incredibly clean and drinkable.  Silky smooth and delicious.  Not quite sure what this beer is lacking to make it a ""5"."
""
""
""
""
""
"Not quite as tasty for me as the marzen, but still quite enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Hoppier than the Marzen but still has the smokiness"
""
"Taste is defined by its huge, warm smokiness. This goes along with burned malts, also toffee and pine. Even more intensive and sweeter than the ""Schlenkerla Märzen", but all in all quite similar, which is, in this case, not a bad thing. Smoked maltiness lingers on the tongue for a while, but not too intensive. Carbonation is well in balance with the overall medium-body, not too notable, adding up to a slightly too sweet and otherwise smooth mouthfeel."
"Pours a lovely dark amber with a distinct dark ruby cast that is slightly darker than their Marzen variant . Good head, lacing and retention. Outstanding nose of meaty bacon like smoke against an underlying dark fruit (plum, fig) note over a slightly sweet base. Medium body with a creamy slick texture.  Normal carbonation with a bit of effervescence on the finish.  Compared to their Marzen variant, Urbock has slightly less head characteristics, slightly more carbonation and more body and texture.  The superb flavor profile is even more outstanding in that it obtains a higher degree of balance by being slightly sweeter and coats the tongue with a slick layer of bacon like smoke.  The flavor profile is a masterpiece of intensity, balance and complexity. The delicious smoke character is always present, but never overpowering. It begins with a campfire bacon like smoke over a moderately sweet background that has dark fruit characteristics. The middle allows the hops to impart a low level bitterness that has a citric note as it effervesces. The finish is less dry than the Marzen, somewhat crisp, slightly sweet and leaves you with a touch of dark fruit and a lingering smokiness as if you've sitting around a campfire. World Class and ever so slightly better than the Marzen variant."

"THE quintessential rauchbier!! Mild smoke in the nose with a nice malty character. Starts off with a nice toffee flavor that is quickly usurped by the smokiness... And man is it smoky. Mild hops bitterness on the finish... Barely noticeable through the smoke. Very nice!"

"Picked this up with hesitation, as I had yet not had a rauchbier I liked. This was the gamechanger. Pours a deep, rich mahogany with a one-finger or so head. Deep smokiness in the nose, which corresponds to the flavor. Like delicious slow-smoked pork, with just a hint of malty sweetness. A bit effervescent on the tongue, almost overwhelming the taste profile. But overall, very very good."

"Overall: This is a magnificent beer. I was truly impressed with how the malts and smoke complimented each other in this beer. Rather than the smoke being overpowering or playing second fiddle to a sweet Bock beer, both flavor elements combined in a truly masterful brew. The ABV on this one isn't too high at only 6.6%, but if you LIKE a Rauchbier, this one will really sneak up on you since it is so smooth and easy to drink. A must try."
""
"This is hard to describe, but it's well worth tasting. The intense smoked malt is ever-present, but it's a good example of how a crazy flavor can work in a beer. Not expensive. From the 500 ml bottle purchased at Bottleworks in the Wallingford neighborhood of Seattle."

"Like many a good german beer, this beer is complex, creamy with low to medium carbonation, a smooth finish, and very clean. The beer is like a camping trip or a Thanksgiving ham in a bottle."
"What's especially impressive about Urbock is that, despite its dominant smoke flavors, it doesn't send me into ""smokey bacon and barbecued meats"" land. Sure, those flavors are present, but there's a sophistication in this beer's flavor profile that is absent from any of the other smoked beers I've tasted in this style. I think that the malty backbone of the duppelbock style deserves some of the credit. But most of it goes to the brewers at Aecht Schlenkerla, who have produced something special here."
""
"Been looking forward to this beer for a long time! Pours a bark root beer brown with a big foamy tan head that recedes to a 1/4 inch cap. Aroma is alder smoke big time over a mild beery underpinning. Smooth going down, the adler smoke is not as evident in the taste as the aroma but very very nice indeed mixed perfectly with a caramelly malt and tiny grassy hop flavor. Eminently drinkable. The 16.9 oz is disappearing quickly! Spectacular with pork."

"Uber alles, this does seem to have a bit of a lighter, booze-lifted essence, that is at once reminiscent of Bocks and actively burning beechwood fires. Still, one hell of a sturdy, gritty, and of course eye and palate-watering smoky deal. Veritable truth in advertising, that cannot be denied, and if there was any homeland beer that Rammstein should hold close to heart, it would be this."
""
"Sorry beer peeps, I just don't get the smoke beer-thing. Looked nice, a dark brown with a small head. Aroma was a sweet and potent smokiness. I gave it the benefit of the doubt as I really like smoked meats in general. Unfortunately, the smoke flavor was just too much for me. I definitely don't want it as part of my beer. I get that a lot of people might enjoy these, not me. Looked like a decent beer, mouthfeel was pleasant but that overpowering smokiness was just a killer."
""

"Good smoke beer, but to me it doesn't stand up to the Maerzen. Now patiently awaiting the 1 December release of the Oak smoke."

"O: I like this beer. I would drink it again. This is a must try if you like smoked rauchbier."
""
""
""
""
"unbelievably spectacular. This beer has a wonderful ""smokiness"" that is truly unique. The taste hits you with hints of wood, caramel, and bacon. This is a medium bodies beer that has a smooth feel and is very easy to drink. I loved this beer and it has become a new favorite of mine."
""
"Beer is medium to medium-heavy in body, with carbonation of medium-low intensity, resulting in a mouthfeel that is lightly foamy (1/3) and smooth (2/3), a bit more carbonation would be ideal, but this is still quite good for the smooth, smoky flavors embodied in this particular lager and the style in general. Closes dry, with heavy stickiness lingering on the palate and lips."
""
""
""
"Overall: An extremely smoky rauchbier that is bound to turn off many, but should be experienced just for the experience. If I were on a liquid diet and was craving barbecue, I'd stock up on this stuff."
""
""
"The best Schlenkerla, and also the last one that I needed to try."

"O-a really well-done Rauchbier, great blend of flavors"
"500ml bottle served in a willibecker. Pours a deep brown with ruby highlights around the base when backlit. Head is half an inch, loose and cream-colored and dissipates into a sudsy slick that coalesces around the edges. Nose reveals smoked meat and a suggestion of raisins or prunes in the background. Taste is much more rounded and pleasantly subdued than suggested by the nose, with the smokey quality not so tied to the meat character. Mouthfeel is light-medium with an easy carbonation and a creamy texture. Overall, not my favorite Schlenkerla beer, but age could be a factor here."
"I love this brewery. Because it kicks ass. Another am amazing rauchbier."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - overall a very unique flavor is what is so impressive. It is a very bold attempt and though not really a session able brew, serves as a great reminder of different stylistic approaches."
"Overall- Damn fine beer and a good introduction to the style. I will be trying Brauerei Heller-Trum's variations on this particular beer."

"Pours with a nearly white creamy head over dark amber liquid with slight hints of garnet red. Nose is intensely smoky...so much so that I can smell the smoke emanating from the glass 1&1/2 feet away from me as I jot down the tasting notes! The taste is wonderfully smoky, sweet & pungent with excellent mouthfeel, not much in the way of hoppiness here, but when there's this much flavor packed into a beer like this it's hardly missed! Finishes long with huge notes of smokiness with sweet malts coming in behind. Just a fantastic example of the Brewers art here! For the novice: try it, if you don't like it...try it again. It may take 3 or 4 bottles, but once you acquire the taste it's nothing short of one of the greatest drinking experiences you'll ever have!"
""
""
""
""
""
"For anyone else who is apprehensive about them, this is an excellent one to try the style with."
""
""
""
""
"Overall – Lightly sweetened BBQ taste in a glass here. Roasted, smoked with a bit of char, sweet and delicious."
""
""
""
"Pours a translucent, clear mahogany color with a voluminous bone colored head. Excellent lacing through out the drinking left on the sides of the glass. For the aroma, I picked up some fruit esters underneath the wonderful charred wood scents. After a taste I found it to be similar to that of smoked Gouda cheese, meat, some hoppiness, with a soft bready finish. Very complex. Something about the mouth feel reminded me of a menthol cigarette. Nice and light bodied, for the seasoned connoisseur of smoked beer."
""
""
""
"Plenty of others have already pontificated long and hard about this fine brew, I agree with most of them (that scored it high and liked it)."
""
"Appearance: dark caramel with a light beige head. The strong smell bacon hits you immediately; like fat-back bacon frying over an open campfire with hickory smoke in the air. Taste follows the smell but surprisingly not as strong, like liquid smoke; smooth for such a complex beer. Full bodied with medium carbonation. This is an intense beer that takes you to the edge without going over. I'll definitely try this again but next time with a nice serving of BBQ'd baby back ribs!"
""
"Anyways, not as dry on the end. Still damn good!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: If you've ever been curious about ""Smoked Beer", this is the original. And the best. What a well crafted beer, it tastes like a beef jerky beer. Pairs extremely well with dutch cheeses, the flavor is so satisfying that I could sip on this all day. Will be buying this whenever I see it. This has moved into my top 10, and perhaps into my top 5 after a few more tastings. As a huge fan of Hefeweizens and Kölsch beer from Germany, there is a similar taste down to the yeast, and this takes all the smoothness and craftsmanship and adds a whole new level of flavor. Please, do yourself a favor and buy a bag of your favorite beef jerky and one or two of these and make an evening of it."
""
""
""
"The taste follows the nose both in smoke and sweetness. The sweetness blends into smoked meats. The smokiness blends into sweet grains. A well blended and tasty array, there's a robustness but its countered with a ease of drink. Love it!"
"O- I had no clue what I was getting in to with this beer but its surely worth your money."
"Would do again, and keen to continue exploring their other beers."

"Overall a very unique and tasty beer. An acquired taste and not an everyday beer, but an amazing melding of smoke and beer. I'd love to try this in its hometown of Bamberg one day!"
""
""
"Overall, high marks for this one. Not something I would buy super often but when I am looking for something weird and relaxing I'll snag one. Or if I'm trying to throw someone a curveball I'll recommend it."

""
""
"Personal Rate: 4"
"O- This is definitely a beer to seek out. I love smoke and smoked foods, so I had been hunting this one down for a long time. If you love smoke and you love beers with complexity and a lot of flavor, this is your beer!"
"O- Best beer I've had in the style. Tasty, smooth and smells like heaven...er...bacon."
""
""
""
"O - I couldn't help but compare this one to their marzen. I didn't get the depth of flavor out of this one that I found in the marzen, although the taste is still good and well balanced. It's impressive how they get that much smoke presence while still maintaing depth and complexity. This one also finishes with a much stronger hop bitterness than the marzen which some might like."
""
""
"Overall a brilliant beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Really delicious. Not as sweet as I recall the Marzen being. Incredible smoked beer. Really gives smoked beer an incredible name. Really warming without being to sweet/high in alcohol. Love this."
""
""
""
"I’m really surprised at how much I enjoyed this. The smoke wasn’t as intense as I anticipated and tasted just right. Nice to MEAT you, Rauchbier."
""
"O - From Bamberg, known for their Rauchbier, comes this iconic brew, expertly blending bold and complex smoke aromas with malty sweetness for a pleasing and unique pint. While balanced to me, it remains polarizing to some, but always worth a try. If unfit for consumption for some, it remains a wonderful beer to cook with!"
""
""
""
"O: Another winner from the guys over in Bamberg. A little light in the feel, but plenty of smoky, woody goodness. Not cloying in the least bit. Excellent"
"Overall: I think that once I get used to Rauchbiers and smoked beers in general, I would have to admit this is a good one. I'll have to try a few less intense ones first and try this one again some day."
""
""
""
"Overall: I love rauchbiers, and I've had a lot of them, including everything from Schlenkerla numerous times. This is my favorite, and IMHO, THE best rauchbier out there. Rating to style, I just don't know where I would knock it down. It knows what it is and it does it perfectly. It deserves a 5."
"O: I'm lucky enough to have 3 craft been bars here that have thousands of beers between their coolers and taps and a beer store with several hundred beers as well. I've tried countless beers over the years and come to love a handful that I'd recommend to anyone, but this is leaps and bounds better than anything I've had before. It was a little pricey at $5 a beer (retail store, not a bar) but well worth it. My only complaint is how fast it goes haha."
"I'm a big fan of smoked beers, and this beer is one of the premier examples of what a strongly smoked beer can be. The beauty of this particular beer is that the undeniably smokey flavor and smell can be so well-tamed and balanced with the other malt and hop notes (primarily the malt). Yes, it is definitely about the ""rauch", but there is so much more with this beer, and so you get some honest balance and complexity with the style. A deservedly prime example of the best of this type of beer and well-worth the experience."
""
""
""
""
"O: I am convinced that Schlenkerla is starting to spoil me with their rauchbiers. Take it from a man who normally dislikes bacon - this is excellent."
""
"Overall a fun beer with some interesting charachteristics. The Marzen version was similar but I thought it was better. The urbock seemed a little light overall which let some more agressive notes comes through in the taste and finish. Certainly unique."
""
""
""
""
""
"I had all three smoke variations at a recent testing and this is the one that stood out the most. As with all three Schlenkerla smoke beers, the rich smokey aroma is something close to heaven. The dark color gives us Americans visions of barbecue, but that is not where the taste goes. Smooth milk chocolate and caramel set off this urbock. If you search, the smoothness may even tell your brain that vanilla is present. With the smoke as its backbone, it creates an interesting mix. A smokey caramel taste continues into the aftertaste which lingers because of a mildly thick mouthfeel. Smoke beers are not for everybody, but there is little doubt who makes the best. This is their best offering."
""
""
""
"Note: Pairs very well with a robust, high-quality cigar."
"Taste-Smoked malt, liquid smoke, caramel, honey ham, charred beechwood. A bit of a dry finish and all wonderfully balanced strong flavors. Not for everyone, but classically crafted and a great match for smoked or BBQ'd meats, or just to sip slowly on a cool night by a warm fire."
"Poured into a glass mug. Pours dark brown with a light tan head. There is some visible ruby colored light visible along the edges of the glass. The head retains very well. The smoked malt hits the nose right up front and it's quite prominent. It's that nice campfire smell and it's bready. The smoked malt hits the nose right up front and it's quite prominent.

""
""
"If you're looking for a smoked beer to try - look no further. I'm not a huge fan of smoked beers, but I'm starting to think that maybe it's because I haven't had the right ones yet. The smoked flavor was clearly present and on the forefront, however it was not so strong that the beer was harsh or undrinkable. Great balance."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is a bit deceiving until you remember that such a rich and powerful aroma is coming from a 6.6% ABV beer. It's rather light but creamy enough to be enjoyable. Overall, how could you top this beer? Not sure it's possible as this one pretty much defines the style. American craft beer drinkers are used to getting this much flavor and aroma from their big bold stouts and barley wines, but lets not forget even in a modest 6.6% package, you can be blown out of this world."
"Wish it were cheaper than $5, could drink this often."
"Pours a super dark brown with pure ruby highlights when held up to the light. Thin creamy tan head. Aromas hint of BBQ and some brown sugar. Taste begins with a smoky molassas, then an ashy charcoal middle, and an earthy, creamy finish. Mouthfeel is rich, perfect. Overall an amazing beer. I love the smoke component. This is probably closer to the taste of beers of centuries past than other modern interpretations."
""
"Overall a great beer very original and tasty. I don't think it was quite as good as the marzen but still worth looking out again."

"Review from 5/2010 notes. Poured into a Nostradamus flute glass.Pours deep ruby red with a thin, quickly dissipating tan head. Aroma of wood smoke, sweet malt. Flavor is smoky with a medium caramel malt and fruit start, light, somewhat dry malt middle and smoky with a hint of hop finish. Light to medium bodied. Side-by-side comparison with the Marzen. This one has more assertive flavors overall. Nice beer. This is the beer that introduced me to Rauchbiers; thanks Schlenkerla!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very nice but without the meaty complexity, sophistication and seemingly gentle force of the doppelbock."
""
"O -- Overall I would rate this beer higher in the taste and overall enjoyment categories if it had just a touch of sweetness from malt, as a good Bock will have. As it is, this is classic Franconian Rauchbier for anyone looking to sample the style. Some call it an acquired taste, but Brauerei Heller keeps the smokiness mellow and tasty without hitting you over the head."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Flavor is, naturally, very much smoke, with some nicely charred wood in there, too. It's a rich and strong flavor profile, and will instantly drive anyone away who doesn't already love smoked foods. For me, this is absolutely a treat and a beer I wish I could get easier around here. Will be drinking more of these in the future, as soon as I can get my hands on them!"
""
""
""
"Overall, not nearly as smoke dominant as most rauchbiers I've tried. This bottle has been in the fridge a couple years, so it may have mellowed. Worth a try!"
""
""
""
"Overall, this is quite a fine rauchbier. It feels strangely anachronistic, because its old-world suggestions stand out against modern-day America; it brings to mind a bygone time. Recommended to all dark beer lovers, or anyone seeking something a little bit different. Prost!"
""
""
""
""
"O- A very interesting beer. I could see this being very good with some good meats or cheese. Not sure I would drink this on it's own again ever again though. It is very intense and almost overpowering at first. But moves into being very drinkable after the first few sips. A very solid beer."
""
""
"O- An interesting beer. Glad I picked one up. Would go great with smoked meats."

"An easy drinking, comfortable beer, suitable for winding down after a stressful day."
"O: Excellent beer, excellent drinkability. The best Rauchbier ever! :)"
"Dark beer, not much head, slow ring and lost of sudsy lace. Smells like smoke. Lots of smoke. Ok, some bacon too. Taste like smoke. Lots of smoike. Ok, some bacon too. Mouth is medium, good carb, balance way out of whack. I wouldn't try this again, but I was glad to experience."

""

Reminds me a lot of the country outings I'm accustomed to during summer and autumn. Some may not like this, but I do and I appreciate it's quality as well as the class Brauerei Heller possess."
""
""
"O: No alcohol can be observed in either the smell or the taste which makes this beer easier to drink. Due to the intensity of the smell, I'm not sure I could drink more than one of these in an evening but it is a beer I definitely enjoy. The smell really reminds me of a good BBQ pit."
""
""
"O: As is the case with all of Aecht beers, you'll either like them or not. This is a pretty solid, drinkable beer."
""
"O - A very interesting style. It is more drinkable than I remember. I'll use this as a measuring stick for craft interpretations of the style."
""
""
"very drinkable. daydreaming of its fresh excellence."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: good beer. Paired with BA's brown ale beef and barley soup recipe and it was a damn fine pairing."
""
"It has a very smokey aroma, almost like I was near a bbq because there was a slight sweet smell. Its head is a light brown with decent head retention and nice lacing down the glass. The beer itself was brown and murky, but yet it was still enticing. As for the taste it starts upfront very smoky and ends with a slightly burnt taste. I had a medium mouthfeel and the smokiness would not stick around forever. Overall a good beer and I would also like to experiment cooking with it."
""
""
""
"O: I enjoyed this a lot more than I thought I would, as I usually am not a big fan of smoke-based beers. This beer though presents additional character that accents the smoke and provides a unique flavor experience."
""
""
""
""
""
"locally, they would become a staple!"
"Overall- Glad I tried it. Before this I had never had a Rauchbier and always wanted to try one. I prob wouldnt spend the money on this one again but its one Id reccomend having under your belt."
""
""
""
"Overall: I really enjoyed this beer, as I can get a few smoke beers here in SLC, but not many. The smoke beer style is a take it or leave it for a most people, I would think. If you have an adventurous friend they may enjoy sharing this beer. I do enjoy the style, although one is enough."
"A first rate rauchbier. This is what all other smoke beers should aspire to. Smokey and smooth with loads of sweet malt. I really enjoyed the smoke meat presence. Well worth seeking out if you enjoy smoke beers or are just looking for a change of pace."
""
"Pours a crystal clear dark brown with a 2 inch foamy tan head that settles to a film on the top of the beer. Thin clumps and streaks of lace cling to the glass on the drink down. Smell is all about the smoke but in a more subtle was than the Marzen: smoked meat, smoked cheese, campfire, etc. I am getting a slight whiff of malt if I search for it. Taste is also of the aforementioned smoked items with a nice sweet malt that supports everything. The smoke flavors aren't as powerful in the aftertaste compared to the Marzen, leaving more of a sweet and subtle roast flavor. This beer has a nice mouthfeel with a solid body and a crisp amount of carbonation. Overall, this is a very good rauchbier and hands down my favorite of the Schlenkerla beers I have tried thus far."
""

""
""
"o - i think this beer would be a great pairing at a barbecue, but it also does very well on its own. I was a little apprehensive when I first smelled it, but it tastes pretty damn good."
""
""
""
""
"O - This was a very unique beer. I loved how overpowering the smoke was, but beneath it was a the complexity of a bock. might drink again."
"For a bock (not my favorite style) I definitely like this. The smokiness is present but not overpowering and the alcohol is well hidden. I'm not sure I can say this is my favorite of their rauchbiers but this is good and worth having. If you like bock, it might be an interesting take on the style to add some smokiness."
""

""
""
"Poured deep dark brown, creamy tight little head and some very decent lacing much nicer than what I usually get from the bottle. aroma of smokey BBQ, meaty, bacon, smoke, delicious. Taste is just as it smells. nice balance between sweet meaty BBQ and a slight bitter aftertaste that leaves the palate clean and ready for food or the next sip. Lighter on the tongue than you'd expect and smooth as can be. Overall this is a beer experience, one that helped to change my own attitude as to what beer could be. It is one of my all time favourites."
""
"O:If you enjoy smoked foods this pairs very well."
""
""
""
"Just smelt the empty glass 15 minutes after drinking - smells like a BBQ pit !"
""
""
""
"O: Delicious. Much more complex than its Weizen brother, with a less assertive barbecue character and more of a noticeable malt presence. Really a perfect beer for this time of year. Thanks a lot to Brandon/pixieskid for bringing this back for me from Bamberg!"
"Nice rauch beer but I’m not as much of a fan as I used to be. Seems more like a novelty than anything else; I quite enjoy smoked beers but prefer the smoke to be more of a component of the overall taste than the heavily dominant flavor these days. Once in a while, though, this is just what the doctor ordered. Pair it with the right foods and it's perfect."

"500 ml bottle. Served in a mug, the beer pours a reddish/brown color with about a half inch light tan head. Head retention is decent, with a small amount of lacing. Aroma is strong, it smells mostly like smoked meats and malt, along with some bready malt and wood. The taste is similar to the aroma, it's mainly smoked meats/malt, but there's also some wood, caramel malt and a bit of sweet dark fruit noticeable, too. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy with moderate, soft carbonation. I think it's a pretty good overall brew, I'd buy this again in the future."
""
""
"O- A nice, warming beer; perfect for winter. Decent complexity and suprising drinkability given its strong smokiness"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very nice camp fire aroma is carried through into the beer. The wood flavor is present but not overpowering; it is pleasant. This is a very enjoyable beer for cold weather."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is it for rauchbiers. I don't need others, this one will do just fine."
"Pours a dark mahogany with thin off-white head that fades quickly. Aromas is of smoke, fairly meaty campfire-forward, with a heavy caramel malt profile. Smoky, but not as much as I hoped/expected. Guessing it's an older bottle. Taste is right in line with the nose, smokey, but not overly so, with a strong caramel malt backbone. Medium-bodied with a smooth mouthfeel and good carbonation. Overall a nice Rauchbier, but I think I need to track down a fresh bottle. I was expecting a smoke-bomb."
"O: An interesting beer. Jury is still out on how much I enjoy it. Right now I'd put the Alaskan Smoked Porter above it as far as smoked beers go. I will try again though! Definitely with some bbq or cheese"
"Prost!!"
"I wouldn’t expect a beer with this much smoke flavor to be so damn drinkable. This glass is vanishing way too fast. I will say that I’d enjoy an imperial version with some chocolate malt to mix with the smoke."
"I really loved this beer, but this is also my first of its style. And while I've had a wide variety of beers, this one is quite unique."
"Overall I think I like this beer better than the marzen. It is a lot more in your face with the smoke and I will definitely seek it out again."
"D- Was a little more impressed by the taste than the Marzen but like it this beer is still heavy; leaving you weighted down and feeling like a meal in itself."
"Note: Given the early responses to this thread http://beeradvocate.com/forum/read/4151434 I might give this one another shot."
"I have had this in the bottle and out of the tap at the brewery. Of course the tap is better. It has a dark brown/red body with an odd colored head I want call off-white but that would not be exactly right. There is Lots of foam. The aroma is very much like an old smokehouse with a little bit of sweetness to finish it off. This is one of their smoother not going to make you gag if you are new to smoked beer styles. Just like all of their beers it will have that ham bacon taste. The mouthfeel is on the heavier end of medium. I only recommend smoked beer especially if you are new to them with meals or for late night sessions."
"Overall: Love it, bacon in a glass. Love the Schlenkerlas."
"Well, I feel like a Schlenkerla fanboy, but, damn, I love these smoked beers. They are head and shoulders above everything other smoked beer out there. So good."
"Picked this up at total wine for about $4."
"Overall: Excellent beer overall. I am new to the world of Rauchbiers, but I've liked what I've had so far. I don't see how they can get much better than this. Highly recommended."
"This is the measuring stick for Rauchbiers. Supremely drinkable stuff, I only wish it weren't so expensive where I live..."
"BACON!!!! Deliciousss!!! Filling space requirements! !!"
"Overall seems to work and feel better on tap slightly."
"Pours a really dark brown w/ nice carbonation and little lacing. Nice one finger cocoa head which disappears quickly. Nose is fairly amazing... especially for the style. Smoke... and then more smoke, followed by beechwood, bacon, split pea soup. Really nice, and not overpowering nose. Taste is really good- a little more balanced than the nose. Fairly similar to the nose except the taste of hops in the background. Malt as well on the aftertaste. Feel is medium to medium full with a fairly thin finish. Overall- this is a great beer, there's a reason it's #2 for the style. Cheers."
"O-great smokey rauchbier, I have heard that this was the standard, I was not disappointed."
"Overall, this is an excellent rauchbier. Expertly balanced and a pleasure to drink."
"Overall, this was a treat. I wouldn't hesitate to purchase again. I can't say if this is great for the style, but as an intro to smoked beers, it worked for me."
"D- An intense smokey experience while still retaining bock-like malt sweetness. Very tasty and im sure an excellent pairing for a lot of foods."
"Needs a little carbonation. Feels very watery and thin."
"O - A very smokey yet a very nice dark beer. I haven't tried it yet, but I think this beer would be great with a nice grilled steak or BBQ."
"A great medium bodied delicacy which I highly recommend as a must try for any beer advocate."
"O: Forgettable, wouldn't get it again. It isn't bad, just wanted something different from the Marzen."
"Overall, the smoke is just right and a solid malt balance to clean it up, clean flavors and somewhat dry finish are nice."
"If drank in moderation, paired with the right cheese and bread/crackers, this could be one of the most enjoyable experiences you could have with beer. I will definately be splitting a bottle of it with my father later this year."
"O/D-Definitely a individual style. Worth a try. I just could never see myself craving a rauchbier. Not my style I guess. Couldn't finish."
"a great beer, not something you could drink pint after pint of, but still easy drinking. look forward to more of the schlenkerla offerings."
"Pairs okay with (veggie) burgers, but even in that context it didn't really sing."
"O: I was surprised this didn’t really remind me of smoked meat. Obviously there is no fishiness to the beer, but I just can’t get my uncles fresh smoked salmon with its salty and smoky flavors out of my head. Overall this was enjoyable, and I look forward to seeking out more beers of the style."
"O - Not a sessionable beer, but perfect to savour over 45 minutes on a cold night. This is only the second rauchbier I have tasted, and it's uniqueness and quality hit me like a mallet. I'll have my eyes peeled for them from now on but this is a tough act to follow."
"Overall: The smoke wasn't as intense as I expected and the bitterness was stronger. I would have liked a little more smoke and to dial the bitterness down just a bit. Another solid offering from this brewery."
"This was the first smoked beer that I ever got ahold of. The style was new to me so I wasn't sure of what to expect. The beer poured out as a dark brown with a generous amount of head on it. The head settled leaving a touch of lacing on the glass. The smell reminded me of bacon, it's had the smokiness of fresh cooked bacon and that was about all on the nose. The taste of the beer was also smokey and even what I found to be a little salty. The mouthfeel was smooth but the flavors kept the drinkability to a minimum for me. Overall I have to say that for a smoked beer it really has those elements all over it. It's not really my favorite style all that much. It is good for those who like them."
"As to be expected this beer is amazing to pair with the right foods."
"O - I had this when i first started drinking beer, and Ive been a fan since. Truly an epic rauchbier. I plan to have some of this in Bamberg soon. If you havent had Rauchbier before, split a bottle with a friend or two (and some meats and cheeses). Its worth the experience."
"Bottle purchased from Chan's in Destin and poured into a Willibecher pint glass. Beautiful dark red with a big head that laces wonderfully. I immediately love the smell. Not so much bacon, but to me, smoked brisket. Smooth, malty, nice bitterness, surprisingly drinkable. I was intimidated by this style, but I am so happy to have finally gotten hold of one. Mouthfeel is remarkably lighter than I expected. Slightly oily, not extremely carbonated. Fairly clean and smoky finish and an absolutely delectable aftertaste. I will buy several next time I go to Destin."
"Pours a dark brown, off white head. Aroma is of deep smokey malts, bacon, cured pork, oaky smoke. The flavor is of smoked malt, bacon, alittle caramel and soft tea like hop flavor. Mostly just the astringent smoke. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a long lasting smokey finish. Overall, similar to the Aecht Schlenkerla Marzen, ashy, charcoal, bacony rauch goodness."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied, and smooth. Delicious savory sipper."
"This was a sipper, an I could never do 2 in a row, but this was just great. Took me a long time to get into and appreciate the style. Shows you that you have to keep trying, as I would have missed out on something spectacular."
"Drinkability: awesome and great for pairing with foods"
"Overall: Tough beer to judge and for me definitely more of a ""food"" beer. The smoke components can wear you out quickly but they are a welcome novelty. Absolutely would recommend with grilled meats - couldn't think of a better pairing than Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Urbock and ribs."
"O: This is great! It's a new taste experience for me. Would probably be wonderful with BBQ pork."
"Unique style and enjoyable, though not an everyday beer for me."
"O: If you love smoked foods, and BBQ what is not to love about this beer."
"I've been working on trying new beers and this one did not disappoint in the least bit. I could kill some of these on a winter night, fittingly by a bonfire. Aasher just informed me of its smoked ham-like taste, which i can't believe i didnt catch onto."
"This beer was shared with zep9865 during a mini tasting. It poured a dark, dark brown with a one finger off white head that laced the glass. It smells of smoked ham, wood chips, and oak. It's full on ham and is close to Krebs Smoked Porter and the Alaskan Smoked Porter in terms of the nose. The flavor is a little subdued compared to the aromas. It has good flavor and is very heavy on the ham, but subdued compared to other smoked beers that I've had. I do enjoy this one however. It's the lightest smoked beer that I can say that I really like. This is like hog light in a bottle. It drinks between light and medium in body and leaves behind a very ham like aftertaste and is very moist. It's a likable beer and worth a try for sure."
"I will buy it again."
"O: Unreal"
"O-My first Rauchbier and it was delicious!"
"-Cheers"
"I think the smoke is a bit much in this guy, more of a novelty experience than enjoyment but again it paired well with food."
"D: im a sucker for this style so im loving this. if you like smoke, smoked meats, smoked cheese, smoked anything you will like this beer. great representation of the style from one of the best rauchbier makers."
"pours like a solid dark lager with a off white head and a nice clear copper body. and as i was expecting the smokey bomb of a noted ""bacon"" smell i got a nice interesting foreground of munich that was quite beery but not something heavy handed. not bacon but apples and peat malt. and beechwood. palate was quite lean but with a nice carbonation that feel like a lager. had a latitude but it was rather quick from beginning to end. palate of smoked malt, dextrose, munich, apple malty and a ardbeg scotch without the citrus notes. the meatiness is there but its let off into something quite grainy. this is still a beer and a great great great food beer."
"O - I was pleasantly surprised with this one, having been disappointed by the first couple German beers we tried. Bump up in score for the ridiculousness of the smell. Wish I could give it a 10 for smell."
"Very good, and one I'd highly recommend if you want to try a smoke beer but have been scared off by the smell."
"Pours dark, mahogany wood brown with a nice uniform light-tan head. Instant smoky overdose in the nostrils, like walking into a smokehouse. Very malty with taste is pure essence of wood grilled beef jerky. Hard to get over the thick smoke, but when paired with some sharp cheddar I changed my tone a bit. When I say ""paired with sharp cheddar"" I actually meant chased the fucker with four cheese Cheez-Its, but the flavor combination speaks for itself, just works."
"O: One of the best representations of a smoked beer that you can get. The german's always do it right when it comes to smoked beers."
"D - I could drink 2 of these, but not really sessionable. I would imagine that it tastes great with a barbecue pairing."
"D - This seems like something that must be paired with food. I like it, but it seems like it should serve a complimentary role to a meat dish. So that's what I'm going to do. Pretty drinkable."
"Every sip of this takes you deeper beneath Bamberg where this taste (and SMELL) has been oozing out of for centuries."
"This is the quintessential Rauchbier."
"Nice flavors, but couldn't have many of these. The smoked flavor is only nice in small doses and can get overwhelming after a while."
"I've been becoming more and more a fan of smoke beers, and this has tipped the scale. Maybe it's just a phase, but I'm in love."
"An awesome, unique German lager. Definitely an acquired taste but underrated in my book. I liked this much better than their Marzen rauchbier."
"Man, do I loves me the smoke! Even better that I get to revisit this old smoky favorite. It pours a sunset russet-brown topped by a finger of dirty white foam. The nose comprises smoked bacon, toffee, and clean cedar. The taste puts a bit more char into the smoke and a touch more cedar into everything. The toffee is toned down a decent amount, allowing the slightly maple-y smoke to run as wild as it wants. The body is on the lighter side of medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a lightly drying finish. Overall, a very nice bit o' rauch, a classic indeed."
"A nice pleasant surprise. But, if for some reason you don't care for smoked bacon, this is not a beer for you, for sure!"
"Drinkability : a nice beer in the German Rauchbier style."
"drinkability is great. great balance. excellent smokey character that balances really well with the base beer. definitely my favourite of the schlenkerla lineup that i've had. tasty rauch!"
"Mouthfeel is great, medium to full bodied with low carbonation. Silky smooth going down, really nice stuff."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass. Poured deep ruby and clear. Medium-sized head is creamy and white in color. Aroma is distincively deep and roasted with sweetish smoked ham-like malts, some ash and a hint of hops. Rich flavor is full of smoked, sweetish malts and the finish is medium bitter. Some sourish, coffee-like roastedness in the finish too. Palate is supersmooth and silky, medium bodied and slick. Fuller and more biter than märzen. Can't say this is my style."
"Still, an interesting drink. I may even try it again way down the road (perhaps after trying less intense smokebeers?). Especially if I had the right cheese and someone to split it with."
"Maybe I should just go back to APA's or IPA's"
"D: It has the body and flavor of a considerably higher in alcohol beer. Really just a pleasure."
"DB- Very nice smoked beer. High in the smoke level but the rest of the beer makes for a balanced, enjoyable experience."
"Purchased in 12/2010 Prague, pivotéka časy.Pravděpodobně-mean I do not like this style of beer, awful bitter taste. I bought 0.5 liters and I drank only 0.1, I had to dump the rest. I'll have a bitter beer, but this is extreme. RECOMMENDED PSPil am from the same brewery as weizenbock and I enjoyed it"
"D - Very nice, the combination of the rich, sweet bock malt character with the smoky malt creates something that is almost like a stout or smoked porter. This beer seems more toasted and smoky than what I have had from Schlenkerla in the past and it has a high level of sweetness that helps to balance out the intense smoke. This is well worth trying, though I would stick with the marzen if given a choice of the brewery's beers."
"Dark, tawny brown color, mostly clear and brilliant but a good amount of yeast floats around. Thinnish tan head leaves a long-lasting haze on the surface. Good amount of active carbonation. Intense smoke aroma; meaty and earthy. Rich, robust malts create a slightly sweet odor. The flavor is not quite as smoky; instead of overpowering, the smoke complements a sweet and complex malt profile. Slight floral hop flavor with a nice balancing bitterness. Light to medium in body with a substantial yet airy mouthfeel. The intensity of the smoke aroma was a bit off-putting at first but the flavor of this one is a great mix of smokiness and malt sweetness, with just enough hop bitterness to balance it all out."
"Drinkability - Quite nice."
"d - A very good example of a rauchbier, it's insanely smokey and bacony. I enjoyed it, and would have it again."
"paired with some extra sharp wisconsin white cheddar"
"1 pt. 09 FL. OZ. bottle. Pours a black color with a small head. Some lacing. Great aroma. Smells of mesquite, A1 steak sauce, barbecue sauce, and smoke. Taste is a bit more subdued than the aroma but still very flavorful. A smoky, barbecue flavor to it. Some sweet maltiness as well, but it mostly tastes like camping. I don't find Rauchbiers to be all that drinkable but this one is somewhat easy to quaff, considering. Very good rauchbier."
"D: This beer is fascinating and I bet goes very well with BBQ. The initial smokiness is intense, but mellows within a few minutes. I don't know why so many fellow beer geeks hate this style. It's very unique and highly enjoyable. Give the true liquid smoke a try! ;)"
"Reviewed on 4/27/2010. Bottle. Pours a dark clear brown with a thick tan head. Aroma of smoked meats, charred malt, smoke. Flavor of sweet meats with a smoky, charred body and charred malt finish. A sweet, meaty, smoky, hearty palate. I enjoyed this one more than the Marzen. Very nice smoked."
"M/D - medium thin mouthfeel, dry and drinkable. A personal favorite."
"D - A slow sipping beer while your palate warms up to it, but well worth the journey."
"The body is medium and feels somewhat watery. Overall this is a top notch rauchbier, definitely the best I have tried to date although I have often stayed away from this style in the past."
"D- Great beer, loved every minute of it, of course I love me a smokey bacon BBQ beer and this is one that tops the cake for me."
"A full flavoured bock without those raw alcoholic flavours with a very mellow and elegant smoke, way better than the bottled version. Asking the publican regarding this, he thought it might be because of the cask and the freshness (this beer was filled just a few days ago),"
"D: an acquired taste, great with grilled meat."
"Drink it warm and slow"
"Medium-bodied, lightly carbonated. Drinkability is good."
"For as bold a taste & smell as this presents, it's very easy-drinking. I think the mouthfeel has a lot to do with it, & the bold flavor subsides a bit, mellowing out. Great beer!!"
"Drinkability - wow. When a beer is this intense, for the drinkability to be this high is a true achievement, taking near-perfect balance. Just a phenomenal beer, and like pretty much everything they put out, an absolute benchmark of the style."
"Overall this beer is well balanced and delicious, surprisingly easy to drink too. I thoroughly enjoyed drinking this."
"Overall - This was actually my first time trying a Rauchbier, and I honestly have to say this is a new style I've fallen in love with. However, it's very unique, and will probably come as an acquired taste for many. Nonetheless, something tells me I'll be coming back to this one regularly during the Winter, and enjoying some sausage or bratwursts with it!"
"drinkability: Good stuff. Not sure I'll be loading up on it, but glad i tried it."
"Drinkability: Rauchbiers are certainly unique brews. I've never known a beer that tasted and smelt like meat. This is the first rauchbier I've had but I'll certainly be looking to try more of them in the future."
"I can understand why this beer is so revered, but it's not something I can drink a lot of. In small quantities it's very enjoyable."
"Drinkability is a little lower with the sticky finish, minerality salty flavor, and heavy smoke which are all tolerable but knock it down a bit."
"drinkability; heavy but tasty enough for one to drink this in quantity but it will lose some of its richness, best to enjoy only a few at a time."
"One of the world's greatest breweries!"
"D- drinks well enough, but it doesn't leap out and scream for more"
"Final notes, Quite a good beer overall. Looks and smells wonderful and is very potent. Tastes pretty good, and feels very good, but one of these will be more than enough."
"D: Very drinkable, though I find one glass to be sufficient. This brewery sets the standard for German rauchbiers. Highly recommended."
"Pleansantly surprised with this, I really liked it!"
"This one is a winner"
"Nose is incredibly smoky, mesquite wood. Dark, almost opaque body. Taste is overpoweringly smoky (but good!) with very faint apple and heavy malt. Complemented by smoked Gouda, for obvious reasons. Mouthfeel is almost insubstantial, not the focus of this beer. Highly drinkable, especially with cheeses."
"D- I opened this on a day I grilled a beef tri-tip roast for optimal tasting conditions, but I still couldn't handle this beer. I only made it 3 or 4 sips in before moving on to something else. The smoke flavor was so strong that it overpowered anything else. The similarity to Liquid Smoke didn't help at all either. It was much smoother than I thought it would be so if I was really in the mood for a nice cold glass of smoke this would probably be what I would drink. Obviously this isn't a style I have learned to appreciate yet, but I do see how someone might enjoy this."
"Drinkability: This is my first rauchbier, and I really like the style. I love smoked gouda cheese, and this basically tastes like smoked gouda cheese+beer. Fantastic."
"D-GREAT beer. This is a classic smoked beer. Not overly smoky at all. I would have this beer again."
"d- Quite drinkable, not sure I could drink it everyday but I could certainly try."
"D- Pretty intense smoke flavor with this one, so it's definitely no session beer but is a nice sipper. Would probably be great with some nice dark bread and an aged swiss style cheese."
"Drinkability - This is truly a unique beer, however, this beer has a definitely overpowering smokiness that needs to be paired with a meal to truly enjoy it. Not a daily drinker, but definetly one for special occasions."
"Pours a clear, dark brown color. 1/3 inch head of a pale tan color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of smoke, sweet malt, and a hint of roasted malt. Fits the style of a Rauchbier. Mouth feel is slightly smooth and clean with an average carbonation. Tastes of strong smoke, sweet malt, slight roasted malt, hint of yeast, and hint of grain. Overall, a very good Rauchbier."
"Drinkability: This is a fine beer but I've found with this one as I do with most of the smoked beers I've tried, the smoke conceals some of the things I enjoy in a bock. This was worth a try and I did enjoy it, but that said I'll probably not repeat it very often and given a choice I'd go for the Helles lager from the same brewery since in that beer the smoke is more subtle and for me is better integrated with the rest of the flavors."
"At the Cloverleaf Tavern, Caldwell, NJ. Poured a deep mahogany brown, near-black, with less than one-finger of beige head. Smelled like liquid kielbasa; roast malt, toast, biscuit, smoke, and even some bitter chocolate and coffee came through in the nose. The taste was immensely smokey at first, with a malty dissolve, and a slight coffee finish, with a smoke aftertaste. Thicker yet more carbonated than expected, which eased the intake commensurately. Truly an excellent specimen of the style, if not the bellwether."
"D - This beer is so potent in flavor, that it becomes taxing rapidly."
"I have nothing to add chaps other than get some!!!"
"I will have no problem finishing this bottle, and I will continue to seek out more like this. Being the first Rauchbier I have had, I have a feeling this one sets the bar pretty high."
"This one has a nice cherry-stained wood appearance, clear, with some tan rocky head that leaves a little lacing. Pretty color, better head than the marzen. Smell is ok, some smokiness and some nuttiness, though it is quite muted. Taste is pretty good, some nice charred smoke flavors with some nuttiness and a bit of maltiness in there. My only complaint is that the smoke flavors aren't quite as rich and flavorful as some other rauchbiers I've had--this one flirts with the ashy side of smoke, which I do not like. It doesn't go quite as far on the ashiness as Weyerbacher's Fireside Ale, but it's not perfect. I'm looking for flavors of roasted pork, BBQ, etc. Medium mouthfeel, clean and light on the palate, without moving too fast to get any flavor. Decent drinkability, though the ashiness came out as the bottle came along, making it a bit tougher toward the end."
"Monument to balance and drinkability for the style. I need to line up some of the other releases from this brewer to tease out the differences."
"Overall an interesting beer and one that would have totally taken me by surprise if it weren't for Fort Collins Brewery and their Z lager."
"After taking a shot at Aecht Marzen a while ago, and after finding myself in a rather smoky mood at the liquor store, I thought I'd give this one a try. Glad I did, too. It retains the phenomenal, meaty, charred scent characteristic of Aecht's brews, but with a slightly richer flavor that's more in line with what one would expect of such a well-presented beverage. Mouthfeel, again, is slightly more watery than I'd hope, but still drinkable, and the taste lingers pleasantly in the mouth for a while. Would probably buy again."
"Beer is medium to light in body and the smoke is the dominant flavor in here. It finishes pretty cleanly and the smokiness kind of lingers in your mouth but not as an aftertaste. There is some mild caramel in there if you can see past the smoke. Overall its pretty good. Not my favorite of the bunch but a damn fine one."
"Singles were 30% discounted so I picked this one up because I've always wanted to try it, but the price tag had always scared me off. Very pleasantly surprised, nice smoky flavor without being too over-the-top. Definitely reminded me of smoked ham. Mmmm ham beer."
"D - What an experience this beer is. A+ all the way."
"D: As with the marzen this is a crazy experience. Delicious stuff, the ultimate BBQ beer. Every BBQ restaurant should have this stuff in bottles. Went well with a charcoal grilled Memorial Day burger."
"The beer pours dark red with a tan head. This is an awesome looking beer. The aroma is lots of meaty smoke with a little roasted malt. The flavor is heavy on the smoke with some darker malts and some dark fruits mixed in as well. As the beer warms, the smoke becomes more intense. Medium mouthfeel and low-medium carbonation."
"D: The beer has enough flavor to probably stand up on its own, but it's likely best paired with foods such as barbecue."
"Having recently had a rauchbier on tap at the other side, this one caught my eye today in the beer store. 16.9oz brown bottle. Pours a chestnut brown with visible carbonation and small whitish head that quickly dissipates. The smell is great, smoky as expected immediately calling to mind backyard bbq's and fireplaces. Taste follows especially up front but back end has some smoother maltiness. Agree with other reviews that mouthefeel is somewhat thin and would not be able to go for more than 1 of these, but an excellent beer nonetheless."
"At first I felt that I would not be able to finish this beer, but the tongue gets used to the smoky flavor and it becomes more and more welcome with each mouthful. Although I completed it, I'm not sure I'd order another. Perhaps this is just not my style."
"I poured into a pint glass to three fingers of tan head. It is brown. The aroma is smoky like barbeque. The taste is smoky as well with some burnt caramel malt. The mouthfeel is medium. It is another good rauchbier. This one is more subtle than the marzen. I preferred the stronger smokiness of that one. I did confirm my suspicion. This beer is great with grilled meat!"
"D: a great beer for a few ounce glass, but a little more than that (especially without an accompanying food pairing) and this will get overwhelming."
"3.5 D: This is my first true Rauchbier and it's quite a ride. The smoke flavor is massive and I probably wasn't prepared. I'll try to find a bunch more of these, then come back to this one and see if I feel any different about it."
"Med/carbonation, light bodied and oh so drinkable. Very well balanced and the smoke isn't overpowering in the slightest. Overall very enjoyable and pleasantly surprising."
"M/D: Seems very light, and would need to be consumed with the right foods. I just couldn't get into this beer. It was somewhat overwhelming in taste and smell. I attribute that to my lack of exposure to this style. I would like to try again, now that I know what to expect."
"D: Hard to say. I could enjoy the smoke sip after sip, but the aftertaste is wearing on me. I haven't seen any mention of this issue in the other reviews I've read, so I'll chalk it up to this bottle. I would love to try it again, especially from a different source."
"While it makes me thirsty, it does beckon sip after sip. Not that I have shelves full of options in this style, but this just became my go-to Rauchbier!"
"To me, this is a great beer experience. I let my wife, mother-in-law and father-in-law take a sip and let's just say the ladies weren't into it. You will definitely be wowed by this and it is an acquired taste to be sure. I'm actually really digging this brew. I just popped my smokebeer cherry with this, but I am already anxious to try more Rauchbier to see how this measures up."
"Another winner from this brewery. I dare say all their beers seem to pretty much taste the same to a degree, but when they taste this good..who cares? That familiar bacon, roast, bushfire smokiness. Perhaps not as pronounced as some of their other beers. No hop action to speak of but that doesn't matter. A medium weighted body, hardly any bitterness but lovely dry smokiness all the way down. Lovely stuff."
"In my adventures and travels 5 years ago I came across a small town in Germany named Bamberg I was there with the 173rd Airborne this town is know for its exceptional smoked beers. Now at first you might think smoking a beer sounds crazy but let me tell you have a big old plate of jager schnitzel with a few of these.... so heavenly... I'm not going to go into detail about this beer but I must tell you its is a must for any beer connoisseur for the sheer experience."
"Very interesting in a very good way. Curious to see what other Rauchbiers are like."
"D- What an outstanding beer! I hope I make it to Bamberg someday to test the drinkability of several Rauchbiers. Its amazing that despite the oddity and intensity of the style, this is a beer that I want served by the liter."
"Feel and Drinkability: Body is heavy with low carbonation as befits the bock part of this. Can't ask more from the feel aspect of this, it can't be beat. This is one hell of a drinkable beer, its easy to drink...I love it. The only problem is though I'd like to drink more than one of these, after a while the taste buds become used to the smokiness and smoked meat that it offers and it becomes less potent and mind blowing as I near the end of the bottle. The palate becomes accumulated to it. However this is prolly the fourth or fifth bottle I've had in the span of two months. For a single beer that costs about six dollars thats pretty regular. Definitely give this a try, hugely worth it. I'll always be coming back to this beer...Its a shame that this was my first smoked beer, it being one of the best I'll be disappointed with all others I try...."
"D- This is a nice beer huge nose and smokey flavor it would be great with nice meal or like I drank mine sitting by the fire. I don't think of it as a session beer,my eyes might start watering."
"Notes: Certainly a brew not ready for all palates, occasions, or even smoked sessions, but quite the awesome beer in any case. Knowing what is coming, and in the right moment this can be wonderful. It´s not rough around the edged, not at all, but there is nothing shy about the German smoked profile here."
"D: Fairly easy to drink, there are a ton of flavors going on here, and letting this warm up a lot helps all the flavors to meld together and mix nicely. Nice beer that is great in the winter, and would pair nicely with just about any strongly flavored meat. Recommended."
"D- I don't find any rauchbiers to be very drinkable... but this one goes down a bit easier than others I have tried. Still, one bottle is enough for me in a sitting."
"D- starts of pretty tasty, but at about half way through it gets a bit cloying"
"Mouthfeel, if you don't enjoy the taste, its hard to enjoy whatever complexities may be evidence from throwing a roasted pig or something into the boil. Drinkability, this is damn challenging."
"The pour produces garnet-like dark brown fluid with reddish hue topped by contrasting light tan creamy head that dissipates forming thin yet firm film. Smoke & soot from burnt wood is by far the most prominent aroma followed by melanoidins, subdued prunes and well masked soft alcohol. The smoky, bitter and prune like sweet fruity flavors of the smooth, creamy and slightly greasy fluid correspond to the aromas. Excellent, without any harsh, burnt or charred flavors. This brew brings a sensation of small cooking chambers blackened from smoke & soot that were in use in ancient times and can still be seen in preserved rustic farm houses. An interesting beer, to say the least."
"500ML bottle poured in dimpled mug - Big beer, hardcore smoke! Lots of malt, smoke and alcohol with sausage like smokey flavour. Comes with all the expected aroma too. Great experience! Creamy tan head pours about 2 fingers and quickly settles with some lacework. Sweetish, full body with lots of roasted malt and caramel. Bittersweet finish."
"D: Well this was certainly a unique beer experience that I'm glad I tried, but not one I'll be trying again anytime soon (Rauchbier in general). This really wasn't my style, but I couldn't really pan it as it seemed to fit the criteria of the style in general. It really did deliver on the description, so if you think you'd like it, give it a try!"
"This was my first foray into the style of smoked beers. The beer wasn't that bad, but the smoke profile was definetly what you would call an acquired taste. Perhaps if that smoke flavor were more subdued, this would have been a more enjoyable experience, but it was too overpowering for me to be enthusiastic about exploring this again anytime soon."
"Drinkability is really very impressive considering the super high smoke character - it tastes very traditional/natural and not at all like ""Liquid Smoke."""
"This beer pours extremely smooth with a tan head that lasts forever. I had read about the beer before so I knew it was smoky but I had no idea that it would taste as my vegan friend put it, ""like liquid bacon."" I thought the smoked beers I have tried before were representative of the style but this blew them out of the water. The others, Stone, Alaskan, anything else purporting to be smoked has nothing on Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier. It took some getting used to but I thoroughly enjoyed this beer"
"Pours a ruby brown color with a one finger off tan head with good retention. Smell is smoky, much like smoked ham with some sweet malt. The flavor is smoky and sweet, and still reminds me of smoke ham. Some caramel is present in the flavor. Very much a malt lovers beer. Very smooth and easy to drink, low carbonation, and medium bodied. Many have said Rauchbiers are an acquired taste, but I acquired a taste for them right away. Very drinkable."
"Poured a ruby reddish brown with one finger head that slowly died. An intense roasted, smokey malt smell that has obvious ""meat"" smells as well. A dry, smokey, meaty taste in a thick body but maintains a smoothness that borders on creamy and is not overpowering. In fact, a good balance between the smokiness and some sweet malts as well as a hint of dark fruit is noticeable making this a very enjoyable beer that is great to sip on as it finishes nice and clean."
"I'm a fan, time to look out for more rauchbiers from this brewery."
"Pours a pure black darkness. Bit of white head but not a ton, even with a vigorous pour. Lacing is intense with a pure sheet of foam sticking to the sides. Smells very smoky as expected. Taste is less smoky than expected but incredibly refreshing and light for the style. Hints of caramel and brown sugar. Mouthfeel is very light for such a dark beer. Drinkability is good but hampered by the strong smoke presence. Very enjoyable beer."
"Poured into a shaker pint. Rich clear copper color and a nice tan head that slowly turns to a film. Good lacing. This is one beer I could sit around all night just to inhale the aroma which is just like walking into a smokehouse filled with bacon. Its really smooth with a barely able to detect bock taste. A wonderful smokey after-taste. Makes me want to run out to my local rib joint for a rack."
"Taste is nice, toasty fruitiness with raisiny spice, some prune, light fruity-alcoholic sweetness, accompanied by light but persistent smokey quality, complementing everything. It is mostly dry but with light sweetness before dryish finish and faintly sweet aftertaste. It has a light herbal toasty bitter hint, as well."
"D: a fascinating brew with an amazing flavor. This is one of the smokier rauchbiers I've come across. Worth seeking out."
"D- how do i get this in my bar? and who is the local distributor? i've had 3 beers from this brewery and i know, i KNOW that when i get a bottle of the marzen i will have an immediate stiffy. like sushi, if one can get over any taboo that may be associated with this style, squash any fear or apprehension, it will ultimately result in one of the most pleasurable drinking experiences life has to offer. not a session beer for me, but one hell of a beautiful thing."
"Great beer, if of course completely DOMINATED by the smoke. With some thought and consideration, other qualities become apparent. Poured with very little head and a tiny bit of lace. Color is an almost opaque dark, aged cherry wood. Aroma is as stated above Smokey and then some malt and that's about it. Flavor's the same with a little malt and dark ripe fruit sweetness. Body is decent and so is carbonation. Finish is pretty much smoke. And then there's the smokiness. Don't notice the alcohol much. Pretty good beer within the narrow class. Not a session beer unless you're a smoke fanatic."
"Overall, this is the classic rauchbier. I would rank just above their marzen and way above the weizen. Most highly recommend especially if you want to try the rauchbier style - might as well start at the top. For me, I love the style but the meaty aroma and flavor would be too much after one so this is an every couple months style. When I want to have a rauchbier this one will jump to front of mind for sure. Rotation - not avail in TX so got as an extra. If avail here, I'd have every couple months. As-is, keep trading for it. Definite on-tap if I can find it."
"Pretty much the same thing as the Marzen. I probably could not tell the difference between the two. This one might have a little more sweet malt, but it is hard to tell. This is a world renowned brewery, and their beers are without a doubt worth a try. I am just not the biggest Rauchbier fan. A must for fans of the style though."
"this is my first review...im half thru with this beer and all i can say is wow!...i typically drink lighter beers like a good crystal wissbier...i am a avid bbq er and love smokey flavor..this is like drinking the smokey flavor i usually have to wait all day to taste after smoking ribs to get...not a beer id drink every day but ill be drinking this one alot more"
"Poured into a snifter. No head, and barely any bubbles on top, but the color and clarity are great, sorta deep brownish-red, kinda soy sauce colored, but brilliantly clear. Aroma of sweet smoke, faint milk chocolate and blackstrap molasses. Flavor comes in with chocolate, a sorta light milk chocolate, clean smoke and a great mineral-slate character, like smelling someone's fireplace while walking around outside during a wet winter. Wow that's a little much huh? Finishes with a nice clean crisp bitterness that leaves the palate clear and ready for another sip. Perfect body, and easy to drink, although as much as I love this beer, I don't think I'd be up for 3 or 4 of these in an evening, the smoke could get oppressive."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is one beer that does the smoked flavor quite well and would be one of the first beers I'd look for if I were in the mood of that kind of beer."
"One of the best smoked beers available."
"Overall; very nice to drink, especially with food, but more of a ""once-off"" beer really."
"Reading the description of a Rauchbier, this beer is very true to the style, so I had trouble rating this one. It's definitely worth trying as this is a unique bee style. However, I don't think I could drink more than one of these at a sitting."
"D - I could drink this all night another excellent Rauchbier from Aecht Schlenkerla a beer that everyone should try at least once"
"again, awesome with food.. having some with homemade pizza now, and it is the perfect accompaniment."
"Overall this is the biggest smoked beer that I've had and I will certainly revisit it again at some point in the future. Not as well-balanced as the marzen but if smoke is what you're looking for then look no further."
"The taste and smell are amazing. There is smokiness with a bit of pork, like smoked sausage. The flavor is not overwhelming though and would allow you to drink a couple of these without killing your tastebuds. Great effort."
"MF&D - Slightly oily, but very drinkable. I don't think I would want to drink these all day, but 1 or 2 serves as a nice fall treat."
"Deep amber with a thin, tan head with good retention. Great lacework too! On the nose, this is glorious. Smoky bacon with a great brown sugar/caramel character, lending an almost BBQ like aroma. Mild tobacco smoke is also present. The opening flavors are smoky with a woody, smoky bacon character with a prominent earthy hop bite. Excellent. Mild sweetness with caramel and brown sugar mid palate, before a dry, smoky finish. Medium in body with high carbonation, a touch higher than it needs to be. This beer is a joy to drink, especially this fresh!"
"This is really good stuff!"
"A tad disappointing given the reputation but still a good, smoky beer. The beer is a dark mahogany-red with a slowly dissipating head. The aroma is smoky but more restrained than expected. It's the smoke aroma of a subtle refined smoked meat. It's complex and sweet; malt manages to peak out from the smoke. The flavor is good and smoky without being completely dominated by meat or smoke. The malt is a bit lighter and simpler than expected, but there's more hops and bitterness. It's warm with notes of fruit (berries), sweet coffee and citrus. The mouthfeel is a tad thin but not too bad. I do enjoy a smoked beer, though, and this one is fairly delicious."
"Notes: I am new to smoked beers and on my first impression I was a little put off by the smell because of the strong bacon scent. I was pleasantly surprised by the smooth yet complex taste of the beer. I wouldn't defiantly go out of my way to taste this again."
"Very smooth drinking medium body, especially since it is so smokey. Huge smoked malt flavor with hints of oatmeal, chocolate malt, barbecued bacon, charcoal and subtle hop presence. The smokiness is not overbearing and I actually wish there was more of it. This beer is awesome!"
"Pours a clear rich mahogany in color with a bit over a finger of tan head. Aroma is dominated by a nice smoky character that is moderately strong and is at times reminiscent of bacon. There is a good malt presence in the background. Taste is much like the aroma. The character is mostly smoky with malty and toasty undertones. The character of this beer is fairly reminiscent of a marzen with some nice smoky aroma and flavor. Mouthfeel is pretty good with medium body and moderate-high carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good. Overall this beer is easy to drink with great complexity and plenty of flavors to keep things interesting."
"Cheers!"
"MF&D - this is a full flavour beer, but it has a medium body. though it is undoubtedly a small problem, i would have wanted the beer to have more of a body my increasing the carbonation a little more. the beer is just above flat, the head is testimony to that. Im not saying this beer should be a big frothy and bubbly lager, but I think it needed more carbonation to make the mouthfeel a bit more lively and to thicken out the body in general."
"D- This beer is amazingly drinkable as I could easily throw back a few mugs and still crave more. This is definitely up there on my favorites list."
"This beer pours a clear, deep reddish brown, with a half inch light tan head. Head recedes rapidly but leaves nice sporadic sheets of lacing on the glass. Nose is pure campfire goodness! Nice smokiness, hint of bacon but not too overpowering as you can pick up on caramel malts and just a touch of hops. Taste is quite nice. Smoked flavoring is a given. At first it's about all you taste...bottled campfire, but it's not as heavy on the smokiness as the Marzen. The emphasis on the malts, mostly caramel come through much more as the beer warms a bit, woody taste and a touch of I think maple is in here. There is definitely a sweeter finish too it that linger on the tongue. Medium bodied, medium carbonation, a bit of an oily feel to it. This is a great beer. It actually worked quite well with some smoked cheddar and bread.. perfect dinner blend for me last evening!"
"It's a smoked beer for sure and a good one. The brewery has their own smoked takes on certain styles and this is certainly drinkable. I would not drink more than one in a sitting but this is more subtle than their other offerings."
"The mouthfeel is light and acidic, but there is some creaminess. I could easily drink multiple of these especially during an oktoberfest party."
"the mouth feel is decent. the malty-ness gives this beer a full body and mouth feel. like i said, this beer would go great with a meal of smoked meat or cheese."
"Overall, this beer is definitely not everyone's cup of tea. However, for someone like me who enjoys a smoked beer every now and then, this one is hard to beat. I have never had a beer that was so robust in flavor and aroma. Every ingredient was noticed and was used to perfection."
"Over a decent beer with some unique flavors, worth trying."
"d) I had this by a fire watching a movie. Superb. Not sure I could put more than 500mL away in a sitting, but this is a superb beer regardless."
"drinkability is ok - the beer drinks nice but is not something i would drink more then one of in a sitting"
"the taste is more malty than the nose suggests. try this beer. one of the good rauchbiers that I've had"
"D: A very interesting beer. Not for everyone, but I enjoyed it. Would pair wonderfully with some BBQ, sausage, or sharp and smoky cheese."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied and slick with good carbonation."
"D: I would love to buy this beer again to have it with a steak or pork roast, but I wouldn't buy this to drink in my leisure. A very, very good beer though."
"D - This is tough. The beer is nice to drink and is something I want to drink but it is odd and not something you want to have more than one of."
"Sure enough, it has a bacon-like taste to it. Nice bitter aftertaste. Great beer."
"Clear, dark ruby amber with a dense creamy sand colored head that melts slowly leaving fine lace behind. The nose is pure smokey goodness, kind of like smoked ham or bacon soaked in german lager. The flavor is pure campfire,very heavily charred malty sweetness with a faint charcoal bitterness. Medium bodied with light, fine carbonation. A really big and good beer."
"I enjoyed this thoroughly, but it was just too intense for a high drinkability score. Impressive in small doses."
"A deep but clear mahogany brown-black with a moderate fizzy head of a grey brown color and weakly laced at best. The aroma brings strong smokey winelike quality, burnt oak, deep and luscious, speaks of ham and licorice clove and molasses. Quite nice and complex! The taste suggests lots more smoke over molasses in a near full bodied brew with some malt sweetness. A luscious feel to the tongue, smooth and edible. There's a coffee bean bitterness. Not a session brew but highly enjoyable, big time unique and a flavorful experience. Don't miss trying this smokey treat, great with the left over ham, mmm...."
"D: Perfect with smoked sausage. The lighter smoke flavor makes this beer a bit easier to take all alone. But it still goes best with smoked meats and heavy cheeses. A very nice beer."
"This is a bit thinner than expected. I'm enjoying this, and thinking of some interesting food pairings. But, I can't help thinking this should have just a little more body."
"Drinking though this is probably the smoothest of the Schlenkerla Rauchs - although it's been a long time since I drank the Marzen, and really you'd have to have them all lined up in a row to really compare them because the smoke is always the dominant factor. This one though is pretty well-balanced and very drinkable."
"Still, this is an impressively robust rauch. One that leaves everything up to the smoke character, and you have to appreciate it for that."
"Drinkability/Notes: What a unique beer, a standard bearer for the Rauchbier style. Nice and smoky with charred meat and fire embers and hints of dark fruit hidden in the wonderful smokiness. A great beer to sip, would be ideal sitting by the fireplace or around the campfire or bbq. Easy to drink with alcohol well hidden. A fantastic change of pace beer and a beer the everyone should at least try once, though I will definitey buy more of this. Highly recommended, seek and enjoy."
"I have a little cold so I think thats why I cant smell the ""intense"" smoke like everyone else can. damn..."
"Conclusion: This is a damn weird beer, my first of the style; it's odd, delicious, awesome!"
"Drinkability - One of these is highly drinkable especially if paired well with food. However more than one might let palate fatigue set in."
"decent."
"The aftertaste changes from sweet malts to a more dry bitterness mixed with smoke. Although there is a lot af flavour it still is a very drinkable beer."
"Smokie... Smokie. Looks great, smells, smokie. Taste is good, until the after. If you like smokie beers this one is good for you. I don't prefer it so much. Mouthfeel is alright. Drinkability is no so great because of the smoke. Having said all of that, I do have to give props for this unique beer. I would drink it daily but I did give it decent marks because of the difference."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- As if this beer hasn't already won me over, the mouthfeel only adds to the experience and allows the nuances of smoked malt, molasses, and hops to unfold their bountiful properties. A classic in every regard, there's something to be said for this brewery's absolutely stunning offerings."
"Drinkability is very low for me. I'm glad I tried the style but it isn't for me. Based on the taste I'm sure that this is a great representation of the stylye, but again, not for me. Maybe I'll revisit it in a couple years but for now, no thanks."
"Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Urbock is a mouthful. Not just the name, but the beer as well. It's got a really nice, unique smoke flavor. I think that's the extent of its purpose. It's probably typical for the style. I don't have any prior experience for comparison. For what it is, it's good. I can't say it's something I'd seek out frequently in a beer. But, it's definitely very nice and should be experienced by every BA at least once."
"Taste: Smokey beef jerky flavor followed by a nice bitter finish. Smokiness stays on your palate for awhile. Really lovely stuff."
"My favorite smoked beer, fo sho."
"Definitely a different experience. If you love bacon or pork you will like this beer. Could go very well with similar tasting foods or smoked cheese. A must try for any real beer fan."
"Overwhelmig aroma of wood fireplace at first, then a smoked sausage aroma. No visible head, and no lacing. Taste is very smoky. Cant really discern any other flavor. Lingers on the palatte. Might work with the proper food pairing. Certainly not a drinkable beer in my opinion. Review numbers wil bear in mind that skoked beer probably is not my favorite."
"Drinkability: I feel sort of bad giving this all fives, but truth be told I believe this is the benchmark for my favorite style. If I could have one beer for the rest of my life this is it. The smoke is not subtle--it is amazing. The other flavors are very complex. This hides the alcohol well. Everything a rauch should be. Everything a beer should be. This is the beer for me."
"I liked it a lot. I found it very drinkable and well balanced."
"The smoke taste is quite powerful. I've found that drinking them before smoking is not as pleasurabe as after."
"D= Like all of the Schlenkerla Rauchbiers, this one is hugely smoky yet still retains a high drinkability. Recommended for those wanting to experience a true German smoked beer."
"Drinkabilty- To me this is a beer that would be ideal with good spicey food or some great summer bbq food, to me of their three main beers by this company this was by far the best and if I try again it would be this one with food paired up."
"D - Very full unique flavor with this beer. If you want something different, this is it. While I dont think I would drink more than one of these at a time, I would definitely keep this in the rotation. I've been wanting to try a Rauchbier for a while, and I have to say I wasnt the least bit disappointed. Highly recommended!!!!"
"Bottle. Poured a very dark brown with a creamy, off-white head that dissipated quickly but, left extensive lacing on the glass. Intense aroma of smoke when poured. Good flavor of malt with smoke flavor intense but, not so it overpowers the malt flavor. Clean and not too heavy on the palate. Excellent."
"Drinkability- not sessionable, imo, but I find myself wanting to try these beers with a wide range of food types, to see what works and what doesn't."
"The Rauchbier poured darkly into my tulip glass, settling with a minimal light head. The aroma wafting from the glass was amazing, beaming with richly layered alder-smoky cherry malt with a cola-tinged edge and dark fruit esters. Powerful and sublime. The taste matched the aroma but was less sweet than expected. Well balanced delicious cola-tinged alder-smoked malts, again with dark fruit notes and now some bacon undertones. Nice levels of hoppiness and cola lingered in satisfying finish. Carbonation and a medium smooth body rounded out the flavors perfectly. Excellent!"
"One day I'll make my pilgrimage to the Brauerei in Bamberg to sample Franconia's famous specialty fresh vom Fass, but until then, the bottled imports continue to serve as a reminder to mark that one on the calendar."
"D- This was quite good but I found it to be a bit less drinkable compared to the Aecht Maerzen. I will definitely have this again, though."
"D- very drinkable; I love rauchbier."
"Oh, and forewarn your significant other about the particular strain that is the rauchbier fart."
"Mouthfeel was smooth up front but ends with some zippy carbonation, not too much though."
"Hard to choose between this and the Marzen, both are great. Got to love the Rauch."
"The drink is light-bodied, very well-carbonated, and a superb drinker if you can stand all the smoke. I love it, and could drink the Aecht Schlenkerla family of rauchbiers all day, any day."
"There is really nothing else like this in the world. Awesome."
"Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Urbock pours a dark brown with a thin off white head from a brown half liter bottle. The aroma is very smoky with a touch of sweet malt. The taste is very smoky with a touch of sweet malt as well. Worth a try, but won't be to everyone's taste."
"As smoked beers go, this is one of the best. Deep brown pour with a lighter brown head that dissipates into a constant ring. Great lacing. Aroma is exactly the same as the smell of a charcoal barbeque grill when you first open it to light it. Bacon, malt, and oak are mixed nicely in the flavor. Not as overpowering as the Marzen version. I only wish this one was easier to find."
"D- This is my very first rauchbier. Smells and tastes great but this is more of a novelty drink to me than something that I could enjoy regularly. Not as drinkable as most lagers... I like it though and would buy it again."
"Supposedly the gold standard of rauchbiers, but I prefer Surly Smoke."
"Nice mahogany color, but not much of a head. The nose has a huge smoked malt presence over sweet malts. Taste is a nice balance of smoke and dark malts. Medium body matches style well. A good exampel of the style. Huge smoke presence. Nice example of the style."
"Ruby to brown. Pretty big head on this one that leaves some decent stringy lacing. Smell and taste are all straight woody smoke. Literally a burning campfire in a bottle that completely overtakes anything else that might be in there. Interesting at first but pretty one-dimensional. This is a taste I only want so much of. Smooth chewy mouthfeel though. Drank with my Thanksgiving turkey. I feel like this really needs to be paired with some big pungent cheeses or charred meat."
"Poured a nice brown color with hints of ruby and a small tan head that dissipated quickly. The aroma was pure smokiness. Flavor is dominated by the woody smoke flavor, but a bit of grain and caramel maltiness are detectable. Mouthfeel is of a medium-bodied beer. I found it very drinkable and enjoyed it immensely."
"D: all I need is a platter of pulled pork and some sweet BBQ sauce"
"Complex standout beer."
"Notes: I can think of little better for a campout in front of a fire. I mean it would be a bit like drinking the campfire itself but I think that it would be great."
"I really enjoyed this experience. I went in a little nervous and came out wanting more. Such a unique style."
"drinkability is great. this is a very managable rauchbeer, without the harsh smokeyness that some can exhibit. for a BA who loves the smoked notes, this ones could have been a bit more assertive in taste, but in the end it pays off with a more balanced profile on the palate. a solid rauchbeer. cheers!"
"this is definitely the more robust and smokey of the schlenkerlas, and more akin to what i was hoping for in a smoked beer. nice, but an acquired taste nonetheless."
"Drinkable in the colder seasons, by the fire, in my opinion and certainly worth a try. Solid 4's across the board!"
"Drinkability: Perhaps Schlenkerla has slowly worked me up the smoke scale to the point where I find this both pleasant and keenly drinkable, but, well, I find it both pleasant and keenly drinkable."
"The sweetest of the Aecht beers. The aroma is sweet as well as smokey. The appearance is a deep maroon brown and the head is smaller than the other Aecht beers. The sweet flavor in this one is similar to molasses. The palate could be a bit thicker. Overall this is the best of the Aecht smoke beers but still very smokey."
"Pours a pleasing chestnut brown with ruby highlights and a nice tan head that (unfortunately) doesn't stick around for to long. The smell reminded me of a nice Islay Sotch, like Ardbeg or Laphroaig. Pungently smokey, I like it. The taste is fantastic! Smoked pork, nutty cheeses, a slight fruitiness, followed by a slight alcohol warmth. Love that smokey aftertaste. Lightly carbonated with smooth mouthfeel and a medium body that is on par for the style. I'm going back tomorrow for a rack!"
"first rauchbier... Pours a clear reddish brown with dense tan head that fades to a thin layer. Smell: smoked gouda, smoked pork, tavern ham, blackened/charred, bonfire. Taste: same smokiness, roasted malt, caramel, a little coffee, munich malt, slight graininess. Mildly sweet with perhaps a hint of spicy/grassy hops at the end of the sip. Nice carbonation for a somewhat creamy, medium body. This is quite tasty, it would pair well with a wood fire in the fireplace (not here), a hunk of cheese and crackers, and someone to split the 500ml with."
"When i first tried this beer I took a smell, then a sip, then I walked away from it. I was horrified. Then i said to myself I have never tasted anything like that in my life and decided I had to man up and drink it. Beer pours a dark burnt brown color. Smell... the smell is what got to me at first. Strong odor of campfire and beef jerky. The taste complements the smell very well. Acrid jerky, ham, and burnt log taste. Sounds unappealing but is very common for this style of beer. I made the mistake of making this the first rauchbier I ever tried. Start with the Helles and work your way up to this one. I give it a low drinkability based on personal preference. A perfect beer to share and experience with someone looking to swim in unfamiliar waters."
"D: A nicely done beer, and an intriguing and tasty style. I could enjoy another bottle once I was done this one. Quite good."
"The smell and initial taste are very reminiscent of a smoked cheese. Not sure if I like it, but I don't hate it. Definitely can taste some smoke that compliments the hops in a unique way. Has a strong malt flavor; one of the most original beers I have drank in a while, but doesn't exactly hit my go to list. I would drink it again and be happy; it would probably get better with the next beer now that I have a better idea what to expect. Does have a similar taste to some other Alt beers I've had in a sort of bitterness at the end."
"THIS WAS BEAUTIFUL THOUGH >>> DEFINATELY HAVE AGAIN!"
"D - This is a fantastic rauchbier and one of my favorites. However, it is a bit strong to session this one, even if it is so wonderful."
"D: Fantastic beer, very drinkable. Finally, a terriffic smoked beer to compare all others to."
"This was my first smoke beer and WOW! I was not prepared for this. Pours dark brown with an offwhite head with nice thin lacing. Smell is huge, smoked ham and bbq. The taste is smoky salty sweetness and smoked meat. This beer has medium body and is nicely carbonated. I was happy drinking the pint size bottle but I don't think I would drink another one especially with the high price tag. Not something I would drink on a regular basis but certainly worth a try."
"D: The smokiness gets to you quickly. Very good overall, but suffers a little bit on drinkability in the end."
"this was my first smokebeer. it was not as dark as i imagined. i used a goblet & there was no head but i dont know if this is because i poured it slow or not. it took me longer than usual to finish this & determined that smokebeer isnt for me although i didnt hate it. mouth feel was lighter than expected not thick like a stout. this beer would probably go well with something from the charcoal grill. this is also my first review."
"Overall - Another excellent rauchbier from Schlenkerla... definitely recommended..."
"Easily the most interesting beer I've ever had, I'll most likely give this beer and the style overall another chance, but the smokiness was more then I had bargained with"
"Highly recommended."
"D- A half-liter will do fine for me, though I would like another. Paired well with the bratwurst I had for dinner."
"Pours a deep deep brown color with an average white head that settled into a light ring. The aroma is of smoke, smoke, and more smoke. There are seared meat and jerky aromas, charcoal, wood, anything that resembles a grill or campfire. A big smoke and meat flavor punches upfront but the Urbock has a malt backbone that punches back, unlike their other offerings. Nice char flavor, along with wood and peat, and rounded out with a lightly roasted malt. This is what I imagine an old, old, old, old school beer tasting like. The feel is still fairly light for such a strong flavored brew. It has soft carbonation with a sweet (and savory) finish. I feel that I should be eating a leg of cow or something. The pinnacle of smoked brews, can't get more smokey, except for the other brews in their lineup. This one is tops due to a nice malt presence. Can't drink a lot of these but look forward to having one by my fire pit come colder weather."
"In short, this is a bacon beer, it looks smells and tastes like liquid bacon."
"D: Very good I thought, once you get used to the style and this brand especially, all others will pale by comparison. Multiples may be limited but one or two will be sure to leave you satisfied for the night."
"Drinking this was an experience and it's unlike anything I have tried before. I doubt I would ever buy it again, but it is certainly worth one try for any beer geek."
"Smokey treat indeed! Wow I'm constantly amazed at how diverse beer can be and this one is amazingly out there. Aroma is heavily smoked malty and meaty, how could this not deserve a 10. Pour is dark and opaque creating a fluffy off white head leaving generous amounts of lacing. Mouthfeel is creamy and surprisingly delicate. Flavor is in step with the aroma. Smokey and rich and so good. Next time I'm picking up some meats and cheeses and having one hell of a go at it. Incredible."
"The style to me doesn't have inherently high drinkability but this is comparably quite smooth. Enjoyable in the right setting."
"This is my first Rachbier, and I have to say it's way up there on my list of favorite styles. The smokey flavor compliments the bock flavors well. This brewery has two others available in the Mid Atlantic: the Marzen and a Weizen. Can't wait for the Marzen. Beware if you're vegetarian - one whiff of this and you'll find yourself in the car on the way to the gas station to grab some Oberto! Recommended."
"Taste: Sweet and roasted malts turn into smoke quickly. Leather and sausage are evident. Finish is very smoky, and sends a bit of the flavor back up into the nostrils after swallowing. However, this smokiness isn't like breathing in a campfire, but more like standing in a meat smoker and sticking your tongue out. Very distinct, and not for the faint of heart."
"Thin whisp of a head, nut brown ale color. Dark rich flavors help to balance out the smoke. Goes great with roasted or cured meats and nuts. At first you think the smoke is going to be overwhelming but it always seems to be in the background adding to the complexity of the beer. Very well made and very consistant. Something I would think in this style of beer to be very difficult. Though widely available locally a rare beer. Would like to see this in a cork enclosed 750ml for aging."
"Pours a deep ruby brown, and smells of smokey outdoors. Quite an incredible smell that makes you want to eat some smoked sausage. Has a decent off-white head that sticks around and leave lacing. The flavor is quite like the smell, a little bit of metallic, yet really smokey and tasty. This is a great example of the style, and should be sought out if you have never had a smoked beer. It is quite strong tasting with a medium to heavy body. I don't think I could drink too many of these, and my mouth tastes like I smoked a cigar when I'm finished with the bottle."
"D : I loved this beer and wish I could easily get it on draft here. I've had it in the bottle but that in no way compares to the goodness on tap."
"The rauchbier's from Schlenkerla are all good beers for certain occasions, and the ur-bock has proven to be a great match with grilled meat this Memorial Day"
"Finely, smoothly carbonated. A bit of slickness. A pleasure to drink."
"D: I love rauchbiers and this is another damn fine one from them. That said, 1 or 2 at a sitting is the limit with the urbock. The marzen or the weizen? i could have more"
"Overall, this is a really nice smokedbeer. My favorite of the Schlenkerla brews, pairs nicely with a smoked cheddar and french rolls."
"The finish is very smooth and its quite drinkable. I'll have to give the other styles a chance and see what other flavors stand out that make them different."
"We got a shipment of the Marzen at my store and people always give me a strange look when I say the beer tastes like smoked sausage. So I was very excited to try the Urbock because the Marzen was so delicious. I enjoyed it slightly chilled in my Warstiener mug. Poured a thick reddish brown color. The nose was delightful with wonderful smokey malts and a bit of an earthy quality. The taste was heavenly with sweet smoke and peat staying silky smooth on the tongue with a clean finish. One hell of a beer!"
"good drinkability the smoke doesn't hinder things in the way you might think, and as you drink it recedes a little letting other flavors shine. the best rauchbier i've had to date."
"d: I'm not often in the mood for smoked beers, but this is one I'd like to have again."
"D - For what the beer is it is a work of art, but can only be truely appricated once in a while."
"This poured a dark and clear tan with fluffy white head. It had an interesting smell like smoky malt and oak. It tasted even more interesting like hickory smoked ham or bacon, with salty roasted malt flavors. It was slightly thick with some carbonation and a smooth yet strong smoky aftertaste. Overall this was extremely unique, like drinking a black bean and ham soup with a porter base. Weird."
"This beer pours a dark mahogany color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into thick, chunky lacing. The aroma is of smoke, bacon, and caramel. The taste has more caramel in it than does the aroma, and it masks some of the smoke, and bacon. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with a silky texture. Overall, this is a great beer. I will certainly drink this again with some good BBQ."
"A wonderfully dark and very smokey beer, blackish with a foam head. Malted down and average mouthfeel. Hot dog in a bottle. Understated carbonation. To me, over the top on the smoke, I can take more moderation, but appreciation for the craftmanship of what it is."
"D- This is my first experience with a rauchbier and it was very enjoyable. I can't say I will be craving this type of beer every week, but I will definitely try this beer again."
"The only real negative is the price, it's always about $3.99 per bottle no matter where I find it (in the USA). Still a very solid beer and a necessary purchase if you're into rauchbiers."
"Well, what can I say? It's a smoked beer. If you didn't want a smoked beer, then you shouldn't have bought it. I'll reiterate the sentiments of many of the other reviewers and say that this is definitely not an everyday beer. However, on the right occasion, I imagine it could be downright blissful. The ""age"" of the bottle didn't seem to do this sample any harm, although I can't know for sure, as I've never had a ""fresh"" one. Nevertheless, this is still a damn good beer. Recommended, provided you know what you're getting into."
"Really good beer, I don't know why I haven't tried this sooner."
"As this beer warms the malts begin to shine. In my opinion, they were a little heavy handed with the smoked malts but it was a good beer none-the-less. The marzen is still my favorite from Aecht Schlenkerla."
"The only problem was a slight mustiness that is present. Im not sure if that is normal or not."
"I got this bottle from Discount Liquor in Milwaukee."
"I really enjoyed the taste. But even this bottle grew tiresome to drink. I think it's just too much smokey flavor."
"Finish is dry and smokey, carbonation is modest. Pretty mellow and easy to drink."
"M&D: mildly spritzy and softly textured, this beer drinks absolutely great, smooth, and refreshing, with a full body yet very little hint of alc. Having tried the draught version last month at the NWAF 2008 that was spot-on, I first had some reservation about this bottled version; but now it's proved to be almost just as nice. For me this is a more-ish smoked beer, and a brilliant drink."
"Drinkability: If you like a smokebeer, not too hard to knock a couple of these back."
"Prosit!"
"From a brewery that specializes in world-class smoked beers, this, along with their Marzen, are probably some of the best smoked beers in the world... this one certainly lives up to the reputation, pours a jet-black, ebony color with slight-tan head... smell is all smoked flavors, with dark, warming, grainy, fish-like aroma... taste is very thick, rich, and full of intricate smoked flavors... as expected, the smoked flavor is very pronounced and hard-hitting, it really comes through... would be a great beer to pair with meats and other smoked foods, perhaps sushi... an all-around, outstanding brew... good mouthfeel, average drinkability due to the rich, thick flavor... very flavorful brew... an amazing depiction of the style... if you like smoked beers you will love this one... can't get much closer to a great representation of the style... Recommended..."
"D - Not for everyone but personally I love it. Not something to drink all the time, just a treat every now and then."
"Pours a deep brown with thin tannish head. Nose is a little smokey but not that much, I really had to sniff to get some good nose. Taste was smokey the moment it hits the mouth and down. It tasted of smoke and something else I could not put my finger on. Someone below aid ham and that seems pretty close. Some type of meat. Overall,it lived up to its name and it was different for me. Good beer and a great beer for a change of pace."
"Bottle: Poured a deep brown color ale with a big foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma is totally dominated by smoked ham notes with some malt. Taste is also dominated by some smoked bacon notes with some nice malt backbone. Body is full with limited filtration and good carbonation. I am not sure if I am getting used to drinking smoke beer but I thought this went down better then the marzen that I had a year or two ago."
"Pours deep, deep brown with slight hints of red. Very nice three finger head, tan with brown highlights. The aromas are subtle, hints of smoked, candied fruit. The beer is very smooth. Smoky, raisin like flovors. The beer is not deep with flavor, it seems a bit hollow. The finish is thick, almost like a barley wine. Its a decent brew."
"D = This is a very particularized beer for me: I really like it but can only imagine a couple occasions where I would choose it because its style is so distinctive. Not for everyday drinking but is tasty."
"D: My first true experience with this style and it was not bad at all, really met my expectations of the style though I can't say this is a beer I'd reach for every time the time drinking this was enjoyable."
"I love smoked meats, the smell of smoke. I own a smoker and get grilling quite often. So naturally i thought smoked beer! that sounds great! wrong. Ladies and gentlemen this is the first beer i have ever, EVER! poured down the drain. smelled good though, smoky"
"D: Light body, moderate ABV and complex flavors with a clean finish. That's a nice recipe for a very drinkable beer."
"Personal score- 88/100"
"D: Obviously, this would be perfect with some good BBQ but also good on its own. Couldnt drink every day but a nice treat."
"Overall, I love the smokiness that comes through. I don't like the off notes in the nose and taste. I'll have to try this one again sometime."
"I had a hard time drinking more than 8 oz of this. Do not get me wrong..I liked it...but plan to buy this one for a bbq....and serve small amounts in a snifter glass to everyone."
"Poured this into my Great Taste of the Midwest Glass because it's the only cylinder shaped glass I have and I don't want to pour this into a 2 liter mug. Pours a dark brown color with a thick light brown head. The lacing is strong. Smell is sweet burnt wood that reminds me of pork. There is also a small background of sweet dark malts. The taste is smokey burnt flavors with a slight roasty maltiness. Really reminds me of smoked pork. Mouthfeel is good and smooth. Overall, this is a great beer and I will have this again...I've loved making BBQ sauce with it."
"A nice one to pair with the obvious - smoked meats. My favorite of the three Rauchbiers I've had from this brewery. Drinkable for style, though still a ""special occassion"" brew."
"Poured a very dark brown, almost black with a thin head. The nose is of smokey sausage up front, but it is maltier on the back end, even slightly winey. Taste is similar. Slightly spicy and nicely smokey up front without being overpowering, then a hit of dry malt with a touch of sweetness, and a deep smokiness on the finish. Complex interplay of the malt and smoke make this beer delicious and intriguing. Very smooth mouthfeel, medium bodied. Very nice example of a Rauchbier, and although smokey, it is kept nicely balnced so that the tastebuds aren't quickly worn out. A killer food beer."
"Dark brown with amber highlights and a dense, creamy one-finger head. The nose is dominated by a campfire smokiness and just beyond is some floral and fruity notes here and there, and a little alcohol ester. Smoked malts really cover the regular malt characters initially but some sweetness comes through as it warms. Tartness in the background, light anise notes, earthy, and bitter hops ate the end. Burnt sugar to molasses sweetness becomes more evident. The finish is primarily smokey flavors, chary, and bitter. Nice full mouthfeel with a creamy build and a crispness just before its gone."
"Drinkability - Definitely a good pairer. About to have some chili with this. I would love this by the campfire or any BBQ."
"Highly recommended!"
"This beer is a pretty solid Rauchbier. Poured a dark amber color with a small, tan head. Unfortunately, there was very small retention and no real lacing worth mentioning. The smell was very nice and smoky, reminding me of wooden embers being snuffed out at the end of a big bonfire. The taste was equally as smoky, reminding me a little bit of burnt bacon and again, the taste of the embers. The mouthfeel was nice and full-bodied and it went down pretty smooth. While I am usually a fan of Rauchbiers, halfway through this one I was not really enjoying it so much anymore. It did not really have me asking the bartender for another one. I would definitely give it a go, especially when I was out camping."
"All in all, the only problem is that it's such a treat that I couldn't see myself drinking a whole lot of it."
"Opinion: This beer is a nice experience. It is not one that I would drink all the time...not even if I lived in Bamberg, but it has a unique flavor that I would certainly like to try somewhat frequently to keep my palate in check. It is not for the faint of palate, but it is a stamp in history that everyone should at least try once to see if they either love it or hate it."
"It definitely was a new flavor for me and I loved it, especially with the sausages we were eating at the time. This one is a great addition to my beer collection and flavors I can add to the list."
"Definition of a rauchbier in my opinion, if you're interested in the style this is the one to get."
"Taste is quite unique and special, I think I am drinking a bbq smoked liquid or something. Of course you feel the smoked malt presence of the beers, followed by some spices and shy hops. Everything is surrounded by a shy but warming alcohol flavours."
"I would recommend pairing this with a plate of smoked salmon or meats, smoked cheeses and dark bread."
"-Oelergud"
"Less smoky in the flavor, as, I believe, is usually the case...but this is a good thing. There is an amazing balance between the smoke and the rich malty qualities that makes this really remarkable."
"Got a light? The pour was a darker brown color with amber highlights. A good pour left a foamy head that had limited retention. The nose is interesting with a grainy malt presence that mixes with the smokiness of the beer. The smoke is unique with more of a meaty or jerky like aroma to it. The taste is different from what the nose would indicate. There is a sweet malt flavor upfront with some almost molasses like tastes to it. The smokiness is still there with a more meaty flavor but balances well with the beer overall. A light roasty finish only accentuates the meaty presence. The body is full with a under attenuated feel. The carbonation is light but does leave a smoke finish that is great for a BBQ afternoon in the backyard."
"Somewhere there is probably an old German man who puts away six of these with dinner. He is a much, much bigger man than me."
"The alcohol is only at 6.5%, yet this beer drinks much bigger than that; it has really captured what in my mind is a chewy Bock like character. I have been semi-regularly brewing a Rauch Märzen because of sampling this and Spezial's beer fresh at the source. I have been toying with brewing a Bock version for the last couple years and this has sealed the deal; I definitely need to brew a couple kegs of this up. This is just so damn tasty and wonderful."
"D: This is what a smoked ale is all about. Big on flavor and big on smoke. I love this style and this is the standard for all others to build upon. Recommeded."
"Nevertheless the entire flavor experience is such that I find this beer quite enjoyable and Id gladly order another bottle. But I wouldnt walk a mile for it."
"I bet this beer would be bad ass with some smoked pork product. I don't eat pork, but I might try pairing and/or marinating it with some beef sausage one of these days."
"pours out of the half litre bottle a deep garnet colour, with a thick but fine head. very little laciness. intense smoke aroma. not overpowering but definitely the star of this brew. some underlying maltiness; sweet notes of caramel and chocolate. the charred flavours and smokiness in the taste profile intermingle quite nicely with a neatly balanced malt bill. sweet toffee and caramel...some choco and coffee flavours on display...all accompanied by the all ever present delicious smokiness that makes this bock beer outstanding. it's layered and complex. mouthfeel is about perfect, and the body is about perfect for a bock style. finishes dry. drinkability is very good, although one might want to pair this with some sort of cured meats and bold cheeses. on it's own, a half litre or maybe a full litre might be enough at one time. i like this beer and will revisit it again under the right circumstances. yummy stuff."
"D: I needed a long time to warm up to this style. As I have grown to appreciate it, I find that few beers are so filling but the smokiness is definitely an acquired taste."
"D: God, I love these beers."
"Dark, maple syrup amber-brown with a creamy, persistent, light khaki head that laces well. Nose is wonderfully smoky! Smoked ham and other assorted meats come to mind. Delightful. Campfire works too! I can pick up some caramelly malt amidst the smokiness, but it's a bit one-dimensional. Sweetish malt flavors up front, before the smoky meat settles in. I really like the sweet/smoke/salt dynamic in this beer. Finish is smoky and slightly bitter. Yum! Medium bodied with a smooth, gentle feel. Very good beer."
"Drinkability: a perfect beer for BBQ beef or ribs. But by itself it is still a nicely drinkable beer."
"Poured from a 500ml bottle into my Imperial pint glass a dark amber-brown color with about two fingers of off white head. Smells of smoked ham, smokey bacon, beef jerky, roasted toasty malts. Tastes almost just as it smells. Smoked meaty flavors prevail with a nice touch of malt sweetness. Medium bodied with a slightly bitter, smokey aftertaste. Another great rauch from Schlenkerla. I enjoyed this beer with a nice, smokey pulled pork BBQ sandwich. It paired beautifully."
"The smoked aroma is extra meaty on this one. Tall, froathy cream colored head holds strong. Dark chestnut colored beer with an amber hue. Chocolate and dark malt in the flavor along with some smoked wood towards the finish. Moderately sweet with just a hint of hop bitterness in the finish. The marzen was the first for me so I compare the other smoked beers to it. The smoked aroma is stronger, but the taste is weaker. Don't get me wrong, there is plenty of flavor, but it's less intense. My recommendation is have at it."
"wow, gotta go buy another one of these."
"Unlike their smoked marzen, which is too concerned with putting up a proper front of beeriness to really let loose, Heller-Trum's smoked Urbock cranks the smoke up to 11. For those of us who like a SMOKEY smoke beer, this one is a must-try."
"This paired soooo f'in welll with: Hickory Farms smoked summer sousage with Hickory Farms Smoked Cheddar and Swiss on Top , on Ritz crackers. MMnn , damn good!!"
"Also this beer cooks very well. I made a excellent batch of Chili with this beer."
"Drinkability is only average for this powerful beer. The flavors are delicious but this sytle easily overpowers the palate after one bottle."
"This is a fantastic beer. If you are not a smoker, do not hesitate to try it - although it definitely smells like smoke, it is more like wood-fired oven smoke than , say, cigars or cigarettes. A very good example of the style, likely the best I have had outside of Germany."
"What an amazing beer. I was blown away by the Weizen but that did not prepare me for this wonderful flavor. I can't wait to try the Marzen!"
"A big, distinctive brew that nevertheless seems well balanced. Not too sweet and not too bitter, but still full in body and flavor. A beer that really delivers loads of flavor without slamming you on the head with big sweet malt or bitter hops."
"It also paired very well with my homemade barbeque ribs. Hell yeah!"
"This is probably not for me. Perhaps it's just that I don't find smokey things particularly attractive. I'm sure, with some experience and practice, I could learn to feign interest in it, but I doubt I'll give this style much of a chance."
"Overall if you do not like smoke beer this is a try, to say you have had, otherwise. If you like smoke beer this is a nice interpretation of one a must have."
"The flavor is a blend of the traditional bock characteristics which are tasty on their own (bready malts, some spice, alcohol) plus a full blown hickory smoke flavor. Very assertive and powerful. As a one-shot, this is great. Any more than one, however, and you may become sick, both of the flavor and to your stomach. Still, it tastes awesome and is a really unique and great brew."
"I have been putting this one of for a while in fear of how it would taste. Turns out, it's pretty darn good. I think I will have to get more of this during the summer time while I'm grilling meat."
"Warm, chewy mouthfeel..but then it tastes like I'm eating a piece of meat, so why shouldn't it feel like it too? Definitely an acquired taste as the description states. Decent drinkability, but I doubt I could drink more than one on a night."
"Very easy to drink with smoked sausages, the prototypical smoked beer."
"Had this on tap at the Map Room in Chicago, and its the beer i remember the best because of how interesting and delicious it was. Poured very dark into a Schlenkerla glass with big lacing and a large white head. Odor was of smoke, hickory wood and malts. Taste is fantastically jerk-o-licious. super beefy smokiness. Nice malt underneath makes it so its not just a one-trick pony. Im always amazed when i have a good rauchbier about how you can make a beer taste like this. Very full and excellent drinakability. Makes me think i'm sitting by a fire. mmmm."
"Pours a darkish brown/red without much head. Lacing shows up down the glass. Smell is of smoky meat. Extra smokey bacon was my first thought. Tastes of smoke and a little malt. Has a slight peaty flavor. Really quite smokey. Slight bitter finish. This is my first Rauchbier and boy is it like nothing else. Still not sure if it is a style for me. Drinkability is limited because of the strong smoke. If you like real smokey flavors, I think you would really enjoy this. It was a little too extreme in the smokiness for me but I am glad I tried it."
"it's fairly bitter, actually, and there's a good amount of malty sweetness floating around under the smoke flavors. the smoke is prevelent enough that i can't really imagine what the beer would taste like without it, but i doubt it is meant to be a beer with a smokey hint. it's a smoke beast and i love it!"
"Another great smoked beer from this brewery. Quite similar to the marzen - with a little less overall smokiness (if that's possible), a slight notion of hops, and a bit sweeter at the finish. Quite enjoyable and drinkable."
"Note: Everything here, save the drinkability, was reviewed ""to style."" It's taste was not a ""pleasant"" smokiness, unlike the aroma."
"Drinkability: I'm gonna do this again, but not terribly often. This is a very interesting libation that will be reserved for special, and smoky occasions here at Chez Jeff."
"What a stupid concept for a beer style. ""Let's make a beer that tastes like burnt meat."" I like it though. It works... somehow."
"this drinks a lot easier with some BBQ or some other complimentry food. & add another ,5-1 point when you drink this in Bamberg on draft/outta the barrel. Drinking a half liter at the source with a nice schweinhaxen & some other Franconian goodies takes it to a straight across the boards 5. This the gold stanard for rauch biers IMO, although they have serveral respectable rivals in Bamberg. Had this bottled many times in Germany & this bottle was as good as any I had there! A world classic"
"Pours a deep reddish brown color with a large off-white head. Smells strongly of smoke, reminds me of bacon. Like the smell the taste is dominated by the smoke flavor. A friend once said the beer reminded him of liquid bacon. The mouth is pretty good, with good carbination. A good introduction to smoked beer but not for everyone."
"I love this beer with brats, or any grilled meat. Also try it as a turkey marinade/basting liquid.... works quite well. Great beer from an old-world style. This one beer makes me wish that there were more Rauchbiers available."
"Overall I am surprised and might have to try this style again sometime"
"Drinkability/notes: Quite excellent, although not a session beer. Would likely pair exceptionally well with barbecue or smoked meats, and strong cheeses."
"As far as the style goes, I would say this is one of the better smoke brews I've had."
"D: It's fairly bold, but the drinkability is decent."
"Drinkability is not bad, great for the style. Prosit, MK"
"I must say the mere mention of smoke in the description of this one was what drew me in. Very intriguing at first until I took a whiff of it. Extremely strong smell of liquid smoke, which for some may make it unbearable. Very dark brown/almost black in color with very little foam or lacing albeit the glass given to me was much too small for the 0.5 liter bottle. As for taste and mouthfeel, this was my first smokebeer, so I was taken aback by the flavors a bit. If you can get past the intense burnt wood smell, you will notice that the beer itself is rather smooth, malty, and quite crisp. Very light on the tongue yet chewy at the same time if you can believe that. As for drinkability, this is definitely not a session beer, and it should definitely be paired with something grilled on the backyard BBQ. The smokiness would go well with steaks and ribs; its crispness and levity would go well with chicken and pork. Overall though, at $8 a bottle, once and done is enough for me."
"The first time I reviewed this beer (above), I was not ready for or expecting the intense smokey flavor of a rauchbier. I recently revisited this one, and enjoyed it much more than I thought I would. I am starting to develop a taste for rauchbiers...as long as you know ahead of time what to excpect, Schlenkerla's Urbock is a damn fine brew. I have re-evaluated my scoring (originaly I gave this 3.5,4.5,3.0,3.0, and 1.5 respectively for a score of 3.25."
"Drinkability: Drinkable both as a bock and as a smokebeer. Malts and smoke balance each other well, and neither overwhelms the palate. Slightly lighter body supports the complex cross of flavors. Sessionable for smoke beer fans"
"Overall a pretty tasty smoked bock. I think I prefer New Glarus' Smoked Rye Bock with its complexity but this is tasty nonetheless. A bottle or two would probably be it for me though."
"Delicious maltiness and unique mesquite, smokey character. A nice full-flavored bock on its own, but the smoked barbecue quality makes this one quite dynamic."
"THIS CRAP WAS HORRIBLE!!"
"Pleasing appearance, with ruby red highlights in the midst of coffee-dark brown, with a wheat-colored head that sticks around in the form of a substantial ring. Huge smoke aroma, like smoked gouda cheese dominates, but there's a discernable sweet malt backing typical of any German bock. On the palate, the smoke is there and up front, but the initial taste of this beer is quite sweet, with bock-y malts (molasses, big time) showing through. The smoke mixes well with those malts in the mid-palate, while the finish switches with a snap over to pure smoke. The finish holds on for a while. Pretty smooth mouthfeel, owing to the huge malt component, but drinkability, without a food to match this with, is pretty low. Without that, the smoke is a bit much for me to down a whole 500 ml bottle."
"drinkability: damn good"
"The pour is dark brown, almost black. For some reason, I was thinking this would be like a maibock .... yes I was very suprised when I smelled what reminded me of a smokehouse. Surprised, but very pleased. I love smoked beers. Initial taste reminds me of the skin on a burnt sausage. I get raw unsweetened caramel as well, and maybe a hint of burnt sugar. Mouth is medium. I could certainly see myself buying this again from time to time. I greatly enjoyed this beer."
"A very nice beer, the smoke does not dominate the taste. This is suprisingly accessible."
"($3.59 / 16.9 oz. wider brown Euro style bottle)"
"Drinkability: Medium-low. A bit thick for more than 1 small serving. A good experience, but not overly drinakable after one."
"Drinkability: I don't like this quite as much as I liked the Aecht Schlenkerla Marzen, which I feel was a little bit more complex. Still, this isn't bad and is great for cooking (thanks to pixel for the awesome barbecue sauce recipe!)."
"16.9 ounce bottle. Bottle says 6.5% ABV."
"This is a great beer to go along with stews, chilis, BBQ and cigars. Whenever I'm at a good beer bar, I can't leave without having one."
"Big half liter German bottle with no freshness date. It pours an amber/copper color with some hefty carbonation that builds up to a finger of tan head that is creamy and leaves a nice thin layer of foam. The aromas are beechwood smoke, smoked salmon and bacon, along with some pale malts and faint hops. It leaves lots of smoke on the palate, along with a big malt sweetness, sweet smoke, toasted malts, and faint spicy/leafy/green hops that contribute a mild bitterness. The body is medium to full and quite smooth, with the taste leaving a long finish. My second offering from this brewery and I must say I prefer their Märzen over this one. However, any rauchbier is a welcome change of pace, especially from Heller-Trum."
"Poured a clear deep rich amber with a fluffy quite sticky two finger white head,whoo the smoke is huge on the nose like black forest ham smokey with hints of brown sugar but man Iam tellin ya its like smoked ham unbelievable.Now Iam the first one to say Iam not a big fan of smoked beers....yet they still intrigue me,drinking this was like drinking a smoked ham hock with an underlying brown sugar-like sweetness but not overly sweet a nice almost salty finish.This woud have to be the perfect pair with hickory smoked pork I mean what could be better I could see basting a shoulder with this,unique and I enjoyed this beer....somewhat."
"I could drink a ton of these."
"I wouldnt say that Ive become obsessed with smoked beers, but I have recently become utterly fascinated with them. Ive had the Schlenkerla Marzen dozens of times, but this was my first taste of the Urbock. The aroma is welcomingly smoky. Fresh and intense (my wife said that she could smell it from several feet away when I opened the bottle). Wonderful. The intensity, however, isnt great enough to overwhelm a rich malty aroma thats hidden underneath. The color is a deep amber-brown with a sticky tan head. Similar to the aroma, theres smoke at the center of the taste (its got a peppery tingle on the tongue), but it doesnt completely eclipse the malt. Good sweetness and a notable malt flavor. Bitterness is in the finish, but you cant really taste the hops through the smoke. I love these beers."
"This is a beer with good drinkability especially if you are into this style of beer. Truly a treat."
"Thanks to Rick for popping the bottle."
"Drinkability for me is unfortunately low. I like the beer very much, but it's just one of those items I'd like 10oz of, rather than 20oz. It's one of those beers that would make a good one to split at the end of the night, but this is the opposite of a session beer, IMO."
"Pours a translucent brown with a nice tan head. The aroma is intense, with big roasted malt, smoked bacon, floral hops and some slight sweetness. The flavor is also initially roasty, followed by some big smoked meats (bacon, beef jerky), some coffee, caramel, floral hops and some alcohol. The mouthfeel is on the light side but appropriate for the style, with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good for a beer with a huge malt profile. This is my first rauchbier, but it was excellent...nothing gimmicky about this beer."
"All of these Rauchbier's by Schlenkerla are worth trying, yes similar in taste in style but very pecuilar in their own right."
"A good beer, almost tastes like a stout but feels alot lighter and looks like a brown ale. I'd love to drink this beer again."
"Poured from a bottle overflowing with foam into my New Belgium globe glass. It is a ruby/almost black and started off with a tan, creamy head that just didn't last very long, although leaving a chunky lacing. Could have fooled me into believing that this was a stout. My first whiff of this hit me as if I had a glass full of bacon. The more my nose gets acclimated, the more I smell the dark, sweet malts and some herbal hops. Tastes like a campfire with a sweet, malty backbone and good bittering hops in the finish. Kind of hard to pick out complexities in this as the smoke is so forceful, although the malt is sturdy enough not to let the smoke completely take over. Alcohol becomes a bit apparent as it warms. Still, this is tasty. Mouthfeel is creamy and does not weigh the tongue down. Delicious and unique beer."
"Mouthfeel is quite pleasant- I could see sitting around doing some serious rauchbier drinking with friends, or having this as a great compliment to a really good steak or a Christmas ham. Much easier to drink than the Marzen- they are each highly recommended in their own way."
"Great brew, one of the best smoked beers out there. Very drinkable (even with an intense, but smooth smokiness) and damn tasty. Highly recommended. I think Ill have to pick up their Marzen Rauchbier tomorrow"
"First Rauchbier since I quit smoking. Still didn't make a difference this was powerful smoke. Nice brown-red white a sticky white head and some lace. A smell of campfire clothes and malty sweetness that has plenty of presence. Wild and phenolic it is like a fire racing across my touch burning out any other tastes. Nice sweetness in the aftertaste balances the smoke rising from my tongue. A body like a good bock no complaint. A little challenging in the first few sips but rewarding and pleasing the rest of the way through."
"Drinkability: Overall this made for a very nice beer, but only a beer that would be only good once in a while. No way I could drink this on a regular basis. It's too thick with smoked meats."
"D: Eminently drinkable, more because of the smokey smoothness than in spite of it. I'd very much like to make this a regular with smoked foods and grilled meats."
"Drinkability: I'm going to say that this is not one I'll often return to. It doesn't work as a session beer, and I don't think that is its aim."
"Overall -- this is a whole lot of beer. Intensely flavorful, rich, and complex. Not an every day beer, but it might be great for special occasions. Next time I have one of these, I will have it with smoked ham on dark rye with some nutty swiss and good spicey German mustard. Mmmm. I was pleasantly surpised."
" Should be a great addition to a marinade. If this is beechwood flavor, i need to get some to grill with."
"All in all, far and away the most interesting beer I have ever tasted... the style is utterly unique and a distinct slap to the palate. I will endeavour to seek out more of this style."
"Drinkability is the only drawback. This is an acquired taste. Fortunately, I am one who loves this style but even I can only have so much. This is a very welcome departure from some of the most prevalent beer styles. Every beer lover should try this at least once."
"Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Urbock is the Big Kahuna, the Head Honcho, the Top Dog; not only of the Brauerei Heller-Trum lineup, but of all rauchbiers the world over. It manages to combine an eye-watering, palate-flooding amount of smokiness with a superbly crafted urbock, the result of which is a transcendant drinking experience that one is unlikely to find anywhere else."
"A nice tan head forms on top of a very dark brown beer. Light barely penetrates on the edges. As with all of Schlenkerla's beers, the aroma explodes out of your glass. Filled with an intense smokiness that dominates and imparts a meaty aroma as a result. In the background is a definite malt background holding everything together. The taste is more of the same delivered on a wave of startlingly strong carbonation. An intense smokiness...let's call it bacon. The malt base comes through in the finish with a slight sweetness and seems to hold everything together. After the swallow, these tastes wrap around your tongue like a blanket, ensuring their enjoyment for a long time. If you enjoy rauchbiers, this one goes down very easily. My preference is for their Marzen because it seems to have a more complex malt element, but this is a great beer in its own right. That said, this beer is more drinkable than the marzen. The all important question is not nature vs nurture, it's savour vs session!"
"I still think i prefer the Maerzen over this, as the smokiness is not quite as dominant in this one. Also the maerzen seemed to have a stronger hop profile than this, though I last had it ultrafresh at the Tavern in Bamberg, so my opinion may be skewed there."
"Obviously unique, but also classy in its advertisement and execution. This is the beer that defines its style much like Urquell and Guiness- no other explanation is needed."
"Its one of those beers to me thats well crafted and well put together but it just doesn't completely work. It's like trying to make smoked cherries. Good beer for the style just not sure this style is good."
"D- This is a very interesting beer. It think this is one of the most intense smoked beers I've had. The bock characteristics are missing or at least overshadowed by the smoke. Nice to sip but not a session beer."
"Comments: I am totally blown away by this beer. Totally bold, over the top, and it doesn't pull its punches. The flavors are incredible. I do not want to have this with food because I don't want to disturb the flavors. Heck, this IS food. I can drink this all day and night."
"The beer pours a deep burgandy color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is awesome. It has an intense smokey aroma that is complimented with crystal and roasted malts. The taste is awesome as well. It has a smooth creamy flavor that boasts of crystal, chocolate, and peated malts. This is one tastey beer. It goes down easy and finishes slightly sweet with that dry smokiness. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn fine beer. I love the aroma and the taste; a great sessions beer."
"Pours nicely, a dark garnet highlighted color, clear, with a fluffy cloud-like head of over an inch. Nice laces, fairly thick on one side of the glass. Whew, meaty, salty aromas, slight fruitwood. Mouthfeel is airy and fluffy, light with restrained carbonation. A brief sense of caramel maltiness and a bit of nuttiness, and then comes the overpowering rich fireplace of smoked sensations, tangy and beefy, pickled antelope sausage, jerky with leather and oak chips. Scorched earth bitter finish. Just well-done, I really like the monster flavors with the cotton candy light-bodied mouthfeel -- its a cool-as-friggin'-hell combination that floats like the smoke from a mid summer fire pit at the campground. These Schlenkeria beers are hellaciously smoked beers! As usual with Rauchbiers, I do have a problem drinking more than one."
"Drinkability- Well, this was my last attempt ever I think at a Rauchbier. I wanted to go out in good fashion by trying a highly rated one. This proves that Rauchbiers or smoked beers are not my cup of tea. I wanted to give it good makrs, because you are supposed to rate accoring to style, which this one hits dead on. But I just can't. If you like smoked beers, go for it, it's all yours. An aquired taste to be sure."
"Cola colored when poured, with some garnet highlights. Frothy head yields some pleasant smoke shed aromas. I enjoyed the full chewy mouthfeel. Smooth cool malt ends in tingly smokiness. At 6.6 abv, this is one to not go bonkers on, but if you do, it wasn't so hot that you be in pain later. The style is one that grows on you. I think for me though , one glass or half is enough."
"Mid sized bottle w/o freshness dating. Pours a deep, rich shade of dark honey maple, tan head, minimal lacing observed from my sample. Nose is clearly and boldly the expected and yearned for smoke. Big and flavorful brew. Smokey, oily, greasy- ahhh, all the best qualities in a beer! I'm sure this style is not for everybody, but I enjoyed a bottle, with some BBQ chicken, would be great with most types of BBQ fare. Fine quality brew, great with meats and hearty foods."
"Although the smoke is the dominant character, it is a little more subdued than the marzen. This actually falls somewhere between the marzen and weizen."
"This beer kicks ass. The Germans know how to brew a mean ass Rauchbier. Pours out to a dark amber color with a nice dense cloud like tan/cream head. Aroma is very smoke-like, as can be expected. Also noted were elements of rich, roasted malts and an earthy overtone. One can tell that this is a serious brew, for the true beer lover. Flavor is badass, with tones of smoke, herbs, and a slight sweetness. Nearly perfectly balanced. Finished with an almost tangy note of smoke that seemed slighly salty. A truely amazing beer. Very drinkable as well. Highly recommended."
"Having this beer is an experience, not simply having a drink, and it definitely is not for everyone. As for me? Well, I think it's a very nicely crafted brew."
"The mouthfeel is medium which helps make this a good food beer. Does a great job of washing down the smoked salmon and cheeses I'm pairing this one with."
"Extraordinarily unique...a malty thing, dominated by the smoke and it's tenacious associations...."
"This is my first Rauchbier and all I can say is WOW! This is one interesting beer. When poured it appears a dark murky brown. Very much like a dark doppelbock. It's tan head quickly dissipates and leaves a sticky rim that leaves a lot of lace on my glass. The aroma is very rich and malty and the smoke... I love the smoky aroma. The taste is smooth an malty and dominated by the smoky malt. When I say smoky I mean a smokiness that is almost mind blowing. I am in love with this brew and consider it a must to have around."
"Continuing to exhale as I sipped provided a glimpse of hop bitterness before I became overcome (again) by smoke as this delectable Urbock fades away like a campfire slowly dying out in the wee hours of the morning. The residual taste in my mouth is almonds...the BBQ ones...I swear."
"Overall i say this one is extremely drinkable. from some reviews i have read, it seemed like people said its wither good or bad. i say this one is one to try, and i love it. i think its one i could drink all day long."
"1 pt. 9 fl. oz bottle. Pours out a clear dark amber color. Big smoke aroma, like smoked salmon and smoked ham. The first time I had this beer, I thought the smell was nasty and out of place in a beer, but I have come to enjoy it. That same smoke aroma is also found in the flavor, along with a big maltiness. These flavors complement each other beautifully. No hop flavor. Drinking one of these is great, but I wouldn't call this beer drinkable. Goes well with grilled meat."
"I have been warming to the smoked beers more and more in the past year. I may even have to brew one myself. This beer poured a rubied dark brown color wtih a lack of head. The nose is big smoke. It smells like jerkey or smoked meat to me. Very intense and full. The Flavor is very much what the nose gave me. The smoke is so big, it is hard to get the nuances of the beer underneat the smoke. I really like it. Wow. The feel is a light moderate with a light carbonation. I really like the big smokyness in the beer. I have now had this beer 3 times and it gets better each and every time."
"Dark caramel in body with orange hues around the edges. Head was nearly white and settled somewhat quickly. A couple of floaties where seen doing what they do bestfloating around. I was skeptical about the ability for a beer to really smell like smoke. I was expecting some heavily toasted malt flavor, but low and behold this really does smell like smoke. There is quite a distinct hickory and oak wood smoke to this and reminds me of some of the local barbeque pits I have around home. Additionally there is a quite recognizable sweet malt aroma which is highlighted by some dark fruit essences. The taste is quite unique and immediately biting on the tongue which covers up some of the initial flavors. Regardless of that I detect essences of the ripe dark fruit which was in the aroma and only some subtle flavors of backwoods campfire. The smoke flavor doesnt come through in the main body of this beer but towards the finish after the biting sensation has all but passed. Good flavor overall but I was expecting a bit more in the smoke in the flavor department. Mouthfeel is very heavy and it definitely feels that way in my stomach. The extremely heavy mouthfeel brings the drinkability down a bit. This is definitely a beer to try due to its uniqueness."
"In the right mood and with the right food this brew is awesome! I will buy this again and again."
"Note: I also sampled their marzen. While slightly lighter and a bit less sweet overall, the two taste so similar I saw no reason to review it. Either will do nicely."
"Overall, a drinkable brew, but I think I would have to set my limit as one or two 20oz. brews in a sitting."
"Has a Smokey barbecue aroma, with a smooth mouthfeel. I tasted almonds and subtle hops. After trying the Weizen first I was thought that the Urbock would follow suit and be disappointing. Well, I wasn't greatly impressed. I did find this brew to be much smoother and less aggressive in terms of that Smokey flavor. This would go well with a burger or barbecue"
"This is one great looking brew.... Clear Mahogany with rising bubbles and a head that appears ""alive"". Both big and small bubbles and what appears to be a layer a grease on the head. Smoked pork heavy in the aroma, yum!! The taste is a great mix here. There is sweet caramel maltiness, charcoal smokiness, and and nice dose of salty bacon fat to finish things off. Very big on taste here. Mouthfeel is good, but the carbonation sometimes gets in the way of the taste i'm longing for. Drinkablity - Not very drinkable to be honest, but a great beer nonetheless."
"I wasnt sure what to expect since this was my first rauchbier but it was surely a pleasant experience. There will certainly be a return trip to Brauerei Heller-Trum's products."
"Flavor is light on the smoke, which is just right. Smoke beers that taste like cigarettes and burnt meat or too overdone. This one is extremely well balanced between sweet malts, dark fruits, a clove spiciness and roasted game. If I didn't pour this myself from the bottle I would have sworn it was from the cask. Great smooth mouthfeel with only mild carbonation. Exceptionally well done."
"Deep mahogany to brown color. White foamy head disappears fairly quickly to a thin ring. Aroma seems like a cross between campfire and beef jerky. Can a beer really smell like this? Yes! Sweet malt flavor. Subtle smokiness. Very little hop flavor or bitterness. This beer is all about the malt and the sublte smoke. Based on the aroma, you would think the smoke would dominate, but this is not the case. Medium body, moderate carbonation. Drinkability may suffer, but this is a fantastic beer. Great with smoked meats and cheeses. Try this one for sure."
"Overall: While I really am taken with this style, it remains so potently smokey that I can only take in one and not all that often. So the drinkability takes a minor hit. Still, Brauerei Heller-Trum has certainly mastered this style of beer and has a devoted fan. Everyone should try this particular beer at least once."
"This is a very drinkable beer! I am very surprised. I had this with a nice meal and I would highly recommend this beer to anyone. The smoke may be too much on its own, but with food it is just the right amount. The bottle disappeared much too quickly and I was looking for another, that I did not buy since I didn't think I would like it. DAMN! live and learn."
"Drinkability and Overall: This is one of the most interesting beers I've had to date. Powerful and agressive. Some people will probably be turned off, especially those of a weaker palate, but I love it. The richest tasting brew my taste buds ever came across."
"So, overall, this was a challenge to taste and a weird one. Not for the faint of heart. This cannot be drunk without food,especially smoky or BBQ foods. It will NOT be for everyone. It does have a flavor that sticks with you and makes you keep taking a few more sips (I guess it's like learning to like blue cheese). But really, I can't imagine finishing what's in my glass, much less having more than one. I can't say it was really for me."
"This was a frustrating beer for me. The all-too-brief sweet malt flavor and chewy texture made me want more, but the incredibly heavy liquid-pork flavors that dominate and finish the beer made it very difficult for me to get through the bottle. A taste I'm not sure I care to acquire."
"Appearance: Murky mahogany brown with a nice sized tan cream head leaves fine evenly dispersed lacing, not bad. Aroma: Smoked pork you choose variety sausage, bacon, etc. However, this one seems to be much more complex then the Marzen and Weizen from Aecht Schlenkerla. A huge undertow of malt here the bock presence along with alder wood smoking process equals appetizing. Taste: Doesn't destroy or ruin your palate with the smoked meat varieties it opens a whole new realm of balanced flavor between the herbal German hops and bock variety malts with underlying fruit notes masked with the smokiness just tastes incredible. Smoked meats still flow along your palate yet it's not overdone within the Urbock, but definitely a beer you have to be in the mood for. Mouthfeel: Medium body smoked malts give it a heavier tone carbonation is smooth going down. Drinkability: Pure flavorfulness of the malts makes this a slow sipper, however it can still become an addicted oddity of the beer world. The heavily smoked malts start to call out to you and the cravings come for this flavor and then all of a sudden many American micro versions of a rauchbier can never be smokey enough. That's when you make your way back to the beer store to hunt down some Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier straight outta Bamberg."
"Drinkability  This is a big, smokey, classic German Rauchbier with tons of port flavors."
"A truly BIG, exciting, interesting, very tasty beer."
"The color of this brew is a deep mahogany, creating a .25 inch mocha colored head after pouring, that dissipates from the center of the glass after 5 minutes, although remains around the edges through the experience. The nose has a moderate malty - smokiness that is similar to a tea called Lapsang Souchong, a tea that is prepared over smoldering pine needles. This particular brew's malt is smoked over smoldering beechwood logs to impart its smoky nose and flavor. The smoky flavor is pronounced and forward, much more so than the nose would suggest. The aftertaste lasts upwards of 1 minute+ The structure of this beer is akin to a brown ale, but an underlying acidity brightens the taste and allows the flavors to emerge from its smoky / peaty confines. The mouth feel is lacking a bit of weight and roundness, but its composition does allow for spirited and effortless consumption, surprisingly so for a brew that has such profound and intense flavors. I would robustly recommend this brew based on the premise of its pure, unadulterated and unusual style. A perfect accompaniment to winter stews and well seasoned meat dishes. This is one of the few Rauchbier's (Smoke Beers), which are prepared and brewed in house start to finish. A superb example of the style!"
"Prosit!"
"Acquired via trade. The last Smoked beer I had was the Alaskan Smoked Porter. Damn that was a good beer. This? Not so much. The beer is a nice dark brown color with a medium beige head and thin lacing. The aroma is equal parts ashtray smoke and Purina Beggin Strips. Medium-bodied with a very smoky character, as a matter of fact it dominates everything else in the beer. The finish is more of the same. I think my wifes question of why I smelled like a cigarette (I dont smoke) after drinking it about sums it up. Its just too much."
"Bottle. Bacon, salamy, mixed in with grassy, herbal flavours. The bottle i had may have been a bit old, some stale flavours came though, may have been a bit old, still enough flavour to keep me interested. I think i still prefer the weizen and Marzen versions, this is still very nice though."
"Beautiful color that can be best described as burnt amber. The body was clear and was topped with a foamy tan head. The head thinned out, but never quite died. The aroma is that of an intensely smoky grill sprinkled with sugar. The sweet and acrid smell hit me at an arms length and nearly put me into a higher orbit with its intensity every time the glass touched my lips. The taste was just as good as the smell with a caramelized sweet maltyness and a smoky bitterness. There were some mildly grassy hop presence, but that was only a secondary pleasure. The mouthfeel was full and satisfying, and the smoky aftertaste lingered on forever. Very good and intricate beer that is the best of the Rauchbier offerings in my opinion."
"The mouthfeel is lighter than expected and clean with that hint of smokiness lingering. I could easily have gone to a second, but would not make a steady diet of the Rauchbiers. This was a well-balanced Rauch."
"This poured out a very dark brown with a reddish hue and a small tan head that was the result of an aggressive pour. The small head quickly falls to a coating of bubbles leaving not much in the way lace. HOLY SMOKES, is all that came to mind when I first poured this. The smell of the smoke quickly filled the room leaving not much else the way of smell besides a faint trace of smoked meat I believe was bacon. Following in suit was thee smokiness that dominated the flavor. I started to detect slightly sweet dark fruity malt notes as well as a bit of caramel as this warmed and some of the smoke died down. A bit of a smoky aftertaste lingers around after each sip. This was about lighter medium bodied and hard good carbonation and a smoky coating feel to it. Pretty drinkable stuff once the smoke mellowed out, definitely a beer I would have to be in the mood for. Overall an excellent beer that delivers on the rauchbier experience. I would like to try it next time with some smoked meat as the scent and flavor would seen to go perfectly with it."
"This is my first experience with smoke beer. I was not disappointed. This stuff poured a dark brownish red colour with a really nice 25mm or so head that stayed for a while. The smell is absolutely awsome. Not an unpleasant smoke smell like burning leaves or something, but a meaty smoke smell like a hickory smoked ham or ribs or something. Very delicious smell indeed. The taste wasn't what I was expected as I have heard only bad about this stuff. I thought the taste was fantastic. Like taking a sip of a nice Oktoberfest type brew while having a mouthful of ham and bacon. Who wouldn't like that?! Very impressed; will buy again."
"Poured a deep brown with ruby highlight, lightly cloudy. White head gives up without much fuss. The smell is a delectable chocolate and smoke. Almost a smoked rib meat or smoked bacon scent. The taste is a hint of chocolate malt, a bit of caramel malt, then a lot of smoke, then a bit of hops bitterness, then a bunch more smoke. Oh, simply heaven. The mouthfeel is just about right - not too thin, not too thick, delightfully in the middle. Smoky without being astringent, just a enough sweetness to balance it all out. A fantastic beer, and the inspiration of my next batch of homebrew!"
"This beer poured a medium brown color with auburn red highlights. Head is on the small side but I do see a decent amount of bubbles rising to the top. The aroma reminds me a of big breakfast with sausage, eggs, bacon, and toast. Awesome! The taste has less of a smokiness than the aroma. The initial flavor is of a nonsweet malt like barley but there is a sweetness behind the initial malt base akin to a chocolate/caramel mixture. I notice a oak like flavor in the base of this beer. The finish is more smoky and it lingers. The balance of smokiness to sweetness is very good. I could see this pairing amazingly with any smoked meat. Much more balanced and tastier than I remember the marzen being."
"A very good beer, the best of theirs IMHO."
"Smooth, medium body with nice light carbonation. A good smoked beer, but nothing I'll be craving anytime soon."
"Drinkability is a very high. Very obvious smoke flavor, which I truly enjoyed, repeatedly. This beer is absolutely fabulous with bratwurst or other smoky meats & strong flavored foods. A ""must try"" beer."
"Don't let the smoke scare you, this is a dangerously drinkable brew. This beer is truly transcendental. This brew and Coheed makes me wonderfully happy. I love the Marzen the best of the bunch, but any beer from Schlenkerla has been touched by god. Seek out, drink up, and be merry. Simply amazing."
"Drinkability is a good question. Not a beer I would want to drink everyday, but it is more drinkable than you would think. I have many good ideas for cooking with this, Rauchbier poached Salmon is just one of them."
"Ruby brown. Generous off-white head receding to a big ring. Aroma is heavily smoky, youve got to like this aspect. Theres just tons of ham, bacon, pork. Its intensely meaty and feels like a meal in itself, very expressive and one that you can smell from far. In this ragard, this can do wonders as a welcome home beer or a barbecue apetizer. It remains rather sweet too with its maple suggestions, peppery and salty, theres even leather and woody flavours in there. This is pretty complex with tons of character. The oldest sharp smoked cheddar youll come across. Body is medium-thick, fulfilling with a bit above average carbonation. Mild bitterness in the finish balances from the rather sweet malts. Fantastic. Probably the smokiest beer on the planet and it will never get on your nerves. Actually, I wished some brewery would make something smokier and as pleasant than this, but this is an old mans daydream. Nevertheless, this remains the father of smoked beers and an experience to enjoy as often as possible. A truly unique product of great appeal."
"The flavor too is, well, smoky. But considerably less so than the aroma, and mostly toward the finish. At the start (after you've given your palate a few sips to acclimate), the malt has a much sweeter character. As it warms, this develops notes of bitter chocolate. The smoke really kicks in at the finish, leaving a dry, almost salty feel in the mouth. Full bodied and *very* full-flavored. This is truly a beer to be experienced! But let it warm a while, and give yourself time to enjoy it -- trust me, you'll get over the smoke! (And in transcending the smoke, ye shall truly come to love it...)"
"Overall: This is the King of Smoked Beer, and with good reason. The only smoke beer I've ever had that was better was the peat-smoked Adelscott, from Fischer. I love smoke beers with a passion, and you should too."
"Not an everyday ""beer", but WOW!, what an experience! Their website is <http://www.smokebeer.com>"
"This beer really combines the smell and the taste, and the result is great."
"This beer was awesome."
"Hmmm... as I get to the bottom of the glass, it does seem a little more astringent. The smoke seems to get stronger with every taste. I can see why this isn't such a good everyday beer."
"I was quite mixed on this beer. Considering it's my first time having a rauchbier, I was expecting a smoke beer. But this was pure smoke. I think Todd said it right, you either like this type or you don't. Sorry, but I for one don't. Poured out a dark brown color with very little carbonation. Smell. Yikes, all smoke, very little malt. Taste. Like eating a big fat sausage. Call me crazy, but the smoke flavor is a little too big. This beer isn't for my liking."
"$2.99 a bottle"
"Got a great thick light tan head when I poured it. Dark amber brown color ( smokey?). Couldn't get much to tie down on a specific aroma out side of the smoke. I'm sorry I can't help but but describe this as smoked sausage beer. there was some hop bitterness on the finish but I kept looking for bacon floating in the the beer the smokyness is that strong. I guess if you like that flavor in a beer ( very strong ) you might not mind drinking a few. But not I."
"This is a good rauchbier."
"Full of flavor but with lager ease and drinkability. In fact, the high drinkability of this beer was the most impressive, especially given its highly unique take on smoked malts. A perfect example of a ""wow"" beer. A must try with food - mine was with juicy pork fillets, collard greens, and green beans. Be sure to let it warm up a little before you open it and some more while in the glass, thus this deep beer can grow on you. In great shape, too, for an imported bottled beer; its seasonal status probably helps with that."
"Drinkability: Not as powerful as the märzen, but I still loved this so. This first sip is the hardest and the rest are pure heaven. I can see why sentimental value kept this brewery alive. Grilling season commences soon.. I best get some more of this stuff."
"16.9oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a deep ruby red color with one finger of head. There is just a little lace left on the glass. The smell is almost exactly like the Schlenkerla Rauchbier Marzen: very pungent smokey aroma, with just a little bit of caramel sweetness. The taste is also fairly smoky, and a little maltier than the marzen. A little bit of hops on the finish, but overall the smoke dominates. The mouthfeel is just a little light on the tongue. The drinkability is fairly good as well. A darn good Rauchbier!"
"I can see where many would not like this beer. I enjoy it a lot and yet I don't think I could have more than 1 or 2 at any one time. It is dark ruby in color with a huge smokey aroma. The aroma is the first thing you notice from the time you open the bottle until you have cleaned your glass. It reminds me of a smoked ham and bacon. A friend suggested that it smleed like beef jerky. It is very malty with some caramel sweetness that explodes into smokey taste. It finishes fairly clean and does not linger. I could not tell if there was much hop character or bitterness to the beer because all I get is smoke."
"Next time I want a smoked beer, I'll go for the Stone Smoked Porter. This one is more like a liquified smoked sausage, or drinking the water you just put out the campfire with..."
"if brown little smoked sausage tied up with string are a few of your favorite things than you probably will really enjoy this beer. This is not everyone's beer, but for fans of smoked beer, this one has it down to a perfection. This dark brown beer pours pretty smooth with a nice little head that dosen't stick around. The smell is like standing in a smoke house at a bar-b-q. I really enjoyed this beer, it drinks like a meal, slow sipping smoked brautwurst beer. The smoke flavor is perfect, meaty and not in any way mediciny or like fake smoke in a bottle taste like a lot of smoked beers sadly taste like. For those who don't like beers this smokey...i bet it would be great for marinating...this would make beer brauts even tastier...Still I enjoyed drinking this one....it probably will put hair on your chest..."
"This beer is one that you will either love or hate. I loved it. The beer is a mysterious dark brown/black that pours with a slight head. The nose is full of smokiness, and the taste is one of smoked ham/bacon with a big malty underpinning. The smoke becomes less shocking as I made my way through the beer, or perhaps my palette was just overwhelmed. I don't know if I could have more than one of these beers at a sitting, but I wouldn't need to - it really is a meal in itself."
"My favorite of the smoked beers. A style I'm learning to appreciate."
"Clearish dark reddish brown color with a small beige foamy head that fades out quickly leaving some good sticky sheets and strings of lace. Aroma is quite unique with a smokey twinge rendering some hints of bacon, bar-b-que sweetness, and wet ashes. Not much else really comes through but the smokened senses which isn't all that bad but would have liked to seen some more complexity within the aroma with some malts or something. Taste is sweet and tangy with a smokey character that adds subdued salty meats, touches of bar-b-que or mustard sauces, charcoal, and jerky. Overall its not really coming across as anything else but smoke for character, which is fine, but I'd like to see an already good beer then add touches of smoke then take a subpar beer and add lots of smoke to cover up the fact that its really not all that good to begin with. And thats what I'm perceiving with this. Feel is lightly creamy with tangyness and quite smooth and close to medium bodied but has some slight watery notions late in the finish. An OK beer to have an occasion but more or less I think I'll use it to marinate and cook up some porkchops or steak with. I think it'll work very well in that department."
"Let me start off by saying that I never really loved smoked beers before. Well, this one almost changed my mind. This is a murky dark brown liquid with a short-lived tan head of bubbles. The aromas are pure smoke, caramel and chocolate malts, and other roasty bock-like notes. The taste is smoky, but remains very bock-like and malty with a lot of complexities in the flavor profile. The mouthfeel is creamy, but a bit too chewy and the drinkability is good as well. This is a good beer all across the beer, and now I can appreciate smoked beers more. They are still not my favorite, but this one was damn good."
"Definitely a unique beer. This is like drinking pureed beef jerky; now I love jerky (though my beer habit kills my funds for jerky), so this is a definite treat. Quite good, and I'd certainly have this one with barbeque or other such smoked meat."
"An amazingly bizarre yet interesting style; who knew beer could jog such a vivid blast from the past? Maybe it's my German heritage, but I could definitely sit around sipping this all night and reminiscing with good friends and family."
"For the style, and excellent example -- good to have every once in a while when you're in the mood."
"Nice crystal clear amber to light brown color with a soapy beige head. Nose of a pot belly stove in a cabin. Salami, smoke, and malt dominates the aroma profile. Rather malty tasting despite the big smoky nose. Rather crisp and refreshing. Nice malty bock base in this beer, I'd expect that even if it wasn't smoked, it'd be a world class bock on its own. I could think of a thousand food items that would accompany this beer beautifully. Effervescent and clean. I'd seek this one out again (with some smoked venison jerky and gouda next time though :))"
"Notes: I never imagined a beer could taste meaty..."
"Be careful, a good burp might bring the flavor back for up to a few hours after trying this beer. ;-)"
"This pours a rich dark teak color, and despite a rather hard pour, the mostly large bubbly head dissipates, forming a thin beige ring with very little lace. A wonderful smoky malt and slight hop and faint alcohol aroma lasts a fair amount of time, eventually giving way to a pleasant morning after campfire smell. Full bodied and lightly sweet and amply hopped. Robust Maltiness blends well with citrus and spicy hop bitterness. This is an acquired taste that I've acquired while tasting and rating this fantastic brew!"
"Great aroma! Smoky molasses malts, barbecue, smoked sausage, oily. Ruby brown clear beer with small off-white head. Considering the aroma, the smoky taste was quite subdued - nice malty sweetness, like a bock. Light sweet finish and tinge of smokiness that I thought was less pronouced than in the maerzen. Mild-medium carb and light oily body. Very nice rauchbier, but not as smoky as the maerzen. Went great with smoked sausages and ham for dinner."
"Sweet malt aromas with some smoke, not nearly as much as their marzen which is much more the way I prefer it. Brown in color with some red highlights a small amount of creamy head. Bacon does come through in the flavor but not enough and is quickly overcome by the sweet malt. Pretty nicely complex. If you have to decide between this and the marzen, my word of advice would be to stick with this if you like more malt and less meat and go with the marzen for more meat and less malt."
"This is probably my new favorite beer. I tried this at my local beer store at a tasteing. The smell is sooooo magnificent. If you wanna know what it smells like, go to a deli or cook something on the grill. The taste is just as good. The biggest suprise of this beer, was it's magnetism at a sorority party I went to last night. Seemed like every 5 seconds, some chick was asking me if they could ""taste my smoke beer"". I let a few have it and they were hooked. Maybe this could be the next beer at the college parties? Maybe not. You can get a 12pack of natty for $5 and this stuff is $3 a bottle. Oh well, we can all dream... can't we?"
"Originally sampled on 26 June 2002. This beer has the beautiful aroma of the best deli you've ever been in. It's the perfect accompanyment to sausages & smoked meat. Very unique. Either you'll really like it, or you'll pour it down the drain. This is definitely not for everyone, but that just means more for me."
"Dark brown color. Medium white foamy head. Aroma is smoked gouda. It sort of like drinking a liquid glass of smoked gouda wrapped around a rasher of bacon. The initial smokiness is somewhat overwhelming, but after the first few sips it settles down into a smoky malty beer. The smokiness is well balanced by the maltyness. Nice beer, if you don't like smoke, don;t bother with this beer, but if you do try this one. World class. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is smoky and slightly bitter."
"This is the third Aecht Schlenkerla I've tried and probably the mildest and most balanced of the trio. Same smoky presence as its brothers but perhaps a little less powerful. Nice brown color with thin but dense tan head. Tastes on the sweet side but a terrific balance overall."
"The taste was similar but I also was picking up some sour fruit flavors and a nice dry hop bitterness. Medium to full bodied with a dry finish. Ultra flavorful. This is a nice treat to enjoy once in awhile or to have with a steak."
"Quite an extraordinary beer nonetheless  flame grilled by medieval dragons no doubt."
"This beer begs to be paired with cheese and meat. I love cooking with it too."
"16 oz. bottle. Murky brown color, tannish bubbly head. Dense, foamy head didn't stay long. Charcoal and smoky aromas ease into your nose. Not overwhelming at all. Smooth smoked wood smell just like the Marzen from this style. Taste is more harsh and acidic, not as smooth. The sourness is more pronounced. Big smoky presence all the way through. Slight stirring of the glass revives the head, and releases some smoked wood smells again. Smoky taste lingers more in this one. Hot aftertaste and burbs that could melt butter from this one. A decent beer once a year or so, the other one was much more smooth. Not a beer to guzzle."
"Loses points for drinkability, as I don't think I would want more than one in a sitting."
"This beer was poured into the glass a simple medium brown color until it was held to the light, then the ruby red showed through. The head was brown/beige in color, and the lace slid down the glass almost the whole way to the finish. The aroma was of leather and smoke, like a smoked ham or salmon, that is it. The taste was nice, it had flavors of smoke, charcoal and some slight fruit all the way through it. Some malt caramel did take place in my mouth but was overshadowed by the smoke. At the end the only flavor I said to a guy next to me at the bar was “beef jerky” It tasted like a good/great beef jerky. I liked it, it was a good finish to a nice session of drinking fine beer. The flavor lasted in my mouth till I got to my car. Not an everyday beer, but worth getting when available."
"The pour a murky garnet to almost brown color, the head dinosauric in size, the texture frothy and as it decays, leaves behind large sheets of fine lace. ""Smoky to the MAX!"" and I like it, hints of malt and caramel sweet, a real treat to the nose as well as the palate. Start is ambrosial, the top middling in its feel. Perkily acidic and the hops masterful and pleasant in their bite, very dry and somewhat sweet aftertaste, if you like Smoked beers, this is a must try."
"A very complex beer. Intense smokiness, at times the flavor inspires me, but sometimes it is just too smoky, I am a newcomer to this style, and it is a big sort of flavor, the smokiness dominates the smell, and aftertaste. Perhaps I am reviewing this too hastilly. It is a great beer, but I am not completely used to the intensity of this smokiness and at times it crowds my ability to taste other flavors. I will re-evaluate this beer on a periodic basis as I become accustomed to the style."
"1 pint, 9 fl. oz. bottle.  Ruby to brown colored in appearance.  Before I even drink the beer, the aroma is smoke filled.  It reminds me of smoked salmon or smoked cheese. First sip - wow!  Smoked gouda definitely, charcoal.  Some sweetness present, roasted flavor.  A slight bitter aftertaste.  You would have a tough time chug-a-lugging this beer.  Hard to rate because it so unique.  Choose when you're looking for a change and want something different.  I just checked out the website they list on the bottle and saw that they sell 5 liter party kegs of this stuff in Germany."
"The body appears clear through a very deep mahogany-brown color. The creamy ivory head holds quite well and leaves some nice lace. The aroma is of rich Beechwood smoke. The body is full with a gentle carbonation, giving it a very creamy mouthfeel. The flavor is richly malty upfront with a lot of sweet caramel and toffee (and even a touch of chocolate?), then backed by a good dose of bitterness as it heads towards the swallow. It finishes dry with a solid bitterness and a lingering smoke character. Unlike some of the other Schlenkerla beers, the Urbock can build on the palate with its big malt, dense bitterness, and intense smoky character. Still, the smoke is so well balanced against the rich malt & hop that it never really takes center stage. This is not a quaffing beer, rather, it should be enjoyed leisurely. Absolutely worth trying. Exceptional."
"Udderly delightful."
"Very dark brown beer tinted red with a thin, off-white head. It smelled very smokey in a wood-smoked-ham kind of way. It had a real nice flavor, smokey of course, with a medium malty body and a nice hoppy bite. It was fuller in flavor than the wheat version, and probably would have stood alone even without the smoke. The smoke made the brew taste a bit salty. If I were to picture the flavors in my mouth (this sounds really strange but hang in there) the smoke would be on top, the malt on the sides, and the hops down the middle. I am proud to say that this beer turned my girlfriend onto smoke beers! Right now I feel like buying more wood for my smoker and smoking myself some turkey or ribs! Very good beer."
"Cheers to VENOM for the sample!"
"Definitely an acquired taste. Very intense smoked aromas, followed by an even more intense smoke taste; pungent. Dominating smoky flavor doesn't allow for additional tastes to be realized. Drinkers of this beer pursue as a love/hate relationship, there are no medians. The drinkability gets a 1.5 I could be more objective but I'm giving that rating solely on preference."
"Pours a ruby/dark amber color with a thin tannish head that sinks fairly quick.  Huge smokiness that almost reminds me of smoked bacon with a bit of caramel sweetness mixed in.  Sweet caramel and a touch of chocolate before the smoke took over command of this brew.  In the smokiness I definitely get a smoked bacon flavor or just smoked pork in general and it is definitely giving me a craving for some right now.  Mouthfeel on this one is a bit thinner than I would like it to be and that brings down the drinkability of this one a bit but it is an otherwise nice brew and could be fabulous with some smoked eats."
"Though I'm not particularly a fan of smoke flavored beers, I enjoyed this brew. The color is a very attractive deep amber brown. Good looking head with nice lace. Predominate, assertive smoke aroma but not overtly so. Smokey malt flavor, that becomes a tad sweet as it warms. The sweetness balances the smokiness fairly well. An interesting changeup brew, one that, IMHO, would be better paired with food."
"The appearance of this beer is lovely - deep scarlet red. Very nice clarity. Some little bubbles form a nice little peninsula in an otherwise headless surface. I love this aroma. Great smoke characteristics. Almost like smelling a campfire from a distance. Woody and dry. This is a nice tasting brew. Not for the weak however. I don't think the smokiness here is quite as strong as say a Batch 5000, but it is nice. A little more subdued. Quite a bit of sweetness coming through too. Probably from the bock style backbone of this rauchbier. (Maybe that is why I prefered the Batch 5000 a little more than this. Less sweet from what I remember.) The body of this is medium to full. Maybe a little syrupy sweetness coming through. Beer conosieurs do need to give this a try."
"Notes: An obvious acquired taste. Love it or hate it. I love it but it is not a brew that I could drink more than once in a while. I love to visit it especially when I am having BBQ or any kind of grilled meat. I paired it with some cheeses, aged sharp cheddar and a ripe sheep’s milk cheese."
"Looks are deceiving with this beer, it looks like a normal dark malty German bock. But once you get whiff, you know this is a smoked beer and is like smelling your clothes after a weekend of camping and sitting around the fire. The big malty bock backbone and the strongish alcohol flavor match very well with the smoked flavor. Easier to drink than the Marzen. A bottle of this would make a great lunch with some smoked fish, radishes, onions, bread and cheese."
"This beer is heaven in a glass. An outstanding package of malt and smoke with neither overpowering the other. This bock is an impressive beer that is just a bigger and better version of their Marzen. This beer is good and easy drinking (for a smoke lover)!  Great with eats..  jawohl, tastes like a gut smoked cheese haha."
"Dark ruby in color, with a thin head.  The clarity is excellent and is indicative of ample lagering. As with their Marzen, the powerful smoked beechwood aroma dominates. A rich, decocted melanoidin aroma can be discerned beyond the heavily smoked malt.  It's quite full bodied, and although the aroma would indicate liquid smoke sausage, pronounced Munich malt flavors manage to balance the smoke flavor.  Although hop flavor is negligable, hop bitterness does a good job to balance the fairly complex malt flavors and is actually fairly high for a bock.  The finish is clean and surpisingly dry. This is a tremendously flavorful brew.  I would love to make a spicy chili using this beer as a base."
"Based on the aroma and initial smokiness upon tasting, you'd think that the whole experience would just be too much.  But then the smooth bountiful malt flavors kick in to tame its mischavious brother.  The bock characteristics are evident and welcome.  Overall, a superb beer drinking experience, though I couldn't see myself drinking more than one in a sitting, thus the low drinkability score."
"3"
