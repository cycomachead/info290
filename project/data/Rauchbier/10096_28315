The appearance was a rich clear amber and a decent white head was present. The scent was somewhat smokey, but not dominate. The taste was decent, malt and grain present with tinges of roast/smoke.

Fits the style of rauchbier. Mouth feel is smooth and clean with an average carbonation level. Tastes of smoke, sweet malt, slight roasted malt, slight earthy malt, hint of grain, and a hint of hops.

The smell is of mesquite BBQ, with hints of green apple, cocoa, and plums. The taste begins with a subtly sweet maltiness, allowing the smokiness to build up behind. That maltiness is what lingers in the aftertaste, though, rather than the smoke, as would be expected. The medium body, coupled with the overall sweetness, makes for a more drinkable rauch than usual.","TMoney2591","Jan 17, 2010"

3.54,-7.8,3,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Picked up a single bottle at Nikki's Liquors in RI. Poured into my nonic pint glass a clear golden amber color with a quickly vanishing off-white head. Smells mildly of smoked malts and burnt caramel with a unique taffy like sweetness. Tastes of sweet, brown sugar coated smoked ribs. The smoke is mild and not overpowering. A bit thin in body with medium carbonation. It did not take long for my glass to become empty. Worth a try if you see it.","ClockworkOrange","Feb 16, 2009"
4.15,8.1,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"But where this shines like I mentioned before is its drinkability. It is so balanced and actually really feminine for a beer of this style. I could easily but back a sixer of this. I guess I was dreaming of a bit more smoke.","bryanbrick","Jan 18, 2009"

3.85,0.3,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Amber brown color, with pretty hues of orange and yellow found at the bottom edge of the glass. It has a sweet aroma, a mix of smoked meat and sweet pale malt. It's mellow. The taste is a surprise to my expectations. Not very smoky, but not very intense, a surprise given its 6.5% listed on the bottle. There's some juicy meat flavor found, but it's leans more towards a helles lager. No odd flavors either. A good rauchbier to be had, and one that paired well with homemade churrasco.","DoubleJ","Dec 30, 2008"
4.4,14.6,4,4,4.5,4,5,"Poured a 12oz bottle into my New Belgian globe. This beer pours a dark caramel with just a slight off white head that completely disappeared leaving no remnants left behind in my glass. The aroma is distinctly smoked barley. Not that fake liquid smoke aroma that you find in so many rauchbiers. Its not overpowering but it is definitely the most distinctive aroma in it. A nice meaty smoke. The flavor is just a really subtle smoke complement very well by a sweet caramel malty backbone. The mouthfeel is a very light and smooth but just a little to dry for me. I can honestly say that this is the first Rauchbier I have truly enjoyed.","hwwty4","Dec 07, 2008"
3.77,-1.8,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Strong copper color with some light ruby and hay colored highlights. Very light tan, two finger head after a zealous pour. Pretty good retention and some sticking after each sip. Smokey bread and old world candy aroma, the hops and yeast combine to add a touch of spicy fruit to the nose. Starts with soesoft, campfire toasted malt that give a note of fruity coffee cakeRoasted plums mix with a faint peppermint hop lingering in the back of the tongue. Medium, smokey smooth body. Maybe not sessionable in my book, but still a drinkable beer.","scruffwhor","Dec 06, 2008"
3.45,-10.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"This beer pours a murky ruby color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into nice lacing. The aroma is of caramel, and toffee malt with a smoke undercurrent. The taste is a bit smokier than the aroma, and there is still a solid malt presence. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a lot of carbonation which seems to slightly get in the way of the taste. Overall, this is a decent rauchbier that I could drink again, but there are better examples out to be had.","KarlHungus","Nov 29, 2008"

An interesting style done fairly well. I love rauchbier, but I'm not sure I like it in a lager form. It would be good for an introduction to the style for those unfamiliar.

I chose the Sam Adams Uber-glass for the occasion of my 1st Brazilian craft beer. Everything about this beer was spot-on, it's as if they re-bottled something from Bamburg.

Flavors like camp fire roasted caramel covered nuts, and smoked meats combine to form a slight woody flavor with enough malts coming through to really forms a tasty balanced smoked lager. A touch of alcohol and sweet ripened plums combine but the lingering smokiness is killer really great brew. Texture wise I get fine even carbonation even a bit bubbly medium bodied ale with lingering presence on the palate due to the dry smokiness.

4.52,17.7,4,4.5,4.5,4,5,"The beer fills the glass with a deep copper hue. the finger of very bubbly head falls quickly to a quarter inch over top, though a constant stream of bubbles helps to keep it stationary there. The color is very brilliany and clarity is fantastic. Even before getting near, I get excellent sweet smokey notes wafting towards me. Taking a closer smell, I find a nice and delicate smokey character, with a more mild sweetness playing below that. The sweetness from the smoke and the malt play well together and are hard to tease apart. The first sip brings a reserved smoke character with a solid bready and slightly grainy malt base that hits directly after the smoke. The smoke then kicks again before fading to a very bready finish. There is excellent balance between smoke and malt here. There is even just a hint of a hop bitterness on the finish. I definitely get a lot of the base beer without feeling I lost any of the rauchbier character that I love. This is excellent. Mouthfeel is moderate with a light to moderate carbonation. A little more carbonation would be nice, but that is just my personal opinion. Overall, this beer is impressive from start to finish. I'm used to smoked beers with a very dominant smoke. I think I may like the balance of this more than others I have had. I will be having this one again.","kmpitz2","May 29, 2007"
3.92,2.1,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and maybe a touch sticky from the sweet malts, with a pretty darn good drinkability.","RedHaze","May 22, 2007"
4.33,12.8,4.5,4,4,5,5,"Drinkability - this is an ideal candidate for an introduction to the style. Not over the top smoked like a Schlenkerla rauchbier but definitely enough to get a feel for the style. Beer tasting candidate for certain. Perhaps the most sessionable smoker I've had.","brewdlyhooked13","May 17, 2007"
4.27,11.2,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"The mouthfeel is moderately heavy for a lager (which I like) and somewhat creamy. Unlike a lot of Rauch beers, I could drink a few of these in a row, but more because of its great balance and not because it lacks a notable smokiness.","Tbone","Beers"
3.31,-13.8,2.5,4,3,4,3,"If blindfolded, I believe I'd most closely compare it to a Scotch Ale in flavor. It is a subtly smoky beer which might make it a good introduction to the style.","smcolw","0"
4.2,9.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Thank you to Todd the beer guy at McKean and Charles in Waldoboro for getting me to try this. I never would have tried it without his suggestion, and then I would have really missed out. This is a great, almost phenomenal, beer. A 12oz bottle, Batch 06, poured into a pint glass. Dark amber color, small head. Faint campfire smoke aroma, with a some fruit. Very pleasant. Fruit, malt taste, with the faint smoke flavor coming in afterwards. Very subtle, very comfortable. Truly a beer to enjoy. I need to see if Tully's carries this, because I don't get up to Waldoboro that often.","lordofthewiens","Apr 09, 2007"
4.08,6.3,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"In spite of the fact that my bottle says Defumada Smoked Lager, I'm pretty confident that we're talking about the same beer. And what a beer it is! This Brazilian offering can hold its head high among the world's best rauchbiers. I love being surprised like this.","BuckeyeNation","Mar 22, 2007"
4.4,14.6,4,4,4.5,5,4.5,"I feel pretty confident that, once word gets out about this and its more available, it will become one of the best of its style/genre. Just a fantastic beer, truly a barreled spirit in 11oz form, complete with the smoke. If you like single malts, bourbon or whiskey with a little charcoal in the background, some caramel up front, stone fruits here and there, and a big chewy finish I cannot recommend this enough. A new member of my personal Top 10, perhaps Top 5. Seek this out & enjoy!","BuckSpin","Dec 28, 2006"
4.05,5.5,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Overall, a better session candidate than bigger Rauchbiers like Schlenkerla, Spezial, and Rauchenfelser. Very clean and inviting.","emerge077","May 04, 2006"
