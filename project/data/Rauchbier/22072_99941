4,9.3,,,,,,"Starting things off at a lovely new local-ish bar with a rauchbier I thought had passed me by long ago.  It pours a clear topaz-sienna topped by a half-finger of dirty ash foam.  The nose comprises hickory-smoked honey-glazed ham, caramel, light charcoal, and a hint of pear.  The taste brings in more of the same, the ham character droned out a bit by some extra smoke and caramel.  The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda drying finish.  Overall, a very nice rauchbier, nice and heavy on the smoke without overdoing it.  I approve.","TMoney2591","Jun 26, 2014"

3.59,-1.9,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.75,"Served on tap at the brewery. The appearance is a clear amber with thin head. The nose is exactly as the nose would imply... tons of smoke. The aroma is straight campfire with some caramel and amber malts in the background. The taste is more of the same, tons of wood, char, campfire, and smoke. The body is light with medium carbonation. Overall, this beer certainly features the flavor and aroma of smoke very well. I would say that it dominates the beer and the malt and hops are tough to pick out as a result.","homebrew311","Oct 17, 2013"
