"Pours a very dark amber with abt a 1/4 inch pearly head. Smell is strong of smoke and caramel. Taste is also heavy smoke with almost a beef jerky smoked pepper taste, finishing with dark fruits."
"Pours a cloudy medium amber.  Normal head volume, above average retention and lacing.  Excellent nose of wood smoke with distinct cherry like sweet notes.  It lacks the meatiness of the Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbiers and is lower in intensity.  Light medium body with a somewhat oily texture.  Normal carbonation with a bit of effervescence in the finish.  The flavor profile is outstanding and follows the nose in regard to Aecht Schlenkerla  Rauchbiers (no meat, less complex and less intense).  It begins with a burst of smoke over a sweet cherry note.  The middle is a subtle bitterness with an ashy quality over caramel sweetness.  The finish is a slow fade of smoky sweetness with a slight alcohol note.  A very good offering, especially for style introduction purposes, but not in the same league as Aecht Schlenkerla."
"So far I'm concerned, Aecht Schlenkerla is the epitome of Rauchbier. Most brewers and beer writers (and evidently Beer Advocates) agree. So I tend to base my opinions of smoked beers on how they compare and, if I didn't know any better, I'd swear this southern Oregon town was actually part of Upper Franconia. Caldera's Rauch Ãœr Bock fairs very well indeed."

"WOW. Picked this up on a whim from the corner store and I am super impressed. It's pretty much an ideal version of the style. Sweet hickory roasty campfire goodness."

"Reminiscent of barbecue. Interesting flavor and smell."

"Overall this is a very tasty rauchbier. Sweet malt and savory smoke play perfectly together. Right up there with the standard Schlenkerla Rauchbier Urbock. Glad to see that Rose Petal mess wasn't an indicator of the rest of the Kettle series."
""
"O: I really liked this rauchbier as I felt that the smoke was quite powerful, but not overdone. It seems like it would go well with BBQ food."
""
""
"Overall, an excellent rauch and one of the better non-German examples I have had. Very drinkable."
"The smokiness is tad diluted in the taste but it is still vibrant enough to satisfy. The cherry kicks in to balance everything off with a modest bitter bite at the finish. The Bros are right on when thy give this one a ""World Class"" rating. This may be the highest rating I have ever given a beer on Beer Advocate."

"dark caramel color with a nice inch thick head. smell is of candied...smoked ham. mmmm. taste is quite sweet up front and follows with a tad bit of smoke. extremely palatable. lovely, actually. very light bodied but it doesn't detract. very much recommended"

"I'm a sucker for smoked beers, this is a good one, I actually want MORE smoke flavor, but this is a damn fine balanced beer and if you like smoked beers (especially in the bamburg vein) definitely check this out"
"Overall: Good beer and excellent representation of the style. Surprisingly well-balanced, as even in German versions of this style the smokiness overpowers almost everything else. Worth a taste and a good beer for a change of pace."
"OA: Pleasantly surprised! I didn't have high expectation for this going into it, but I'm happy to have tried it. Not a style I'm going to buy regularly, but I'll certainly return to the style (maybe to pair with some vegan food :D )"
"A very well done beer that is traditional like Schlenkerla's beers."

"It's hard to rate this beer and that's because I didn't like it. I don't have time to write a full review so I will edit this later but for those who are interested this was an intensely smokey beer. The smoke flavor was over powering and I didn't enjoy it - which is odd because I would bathe in a smokehouse if I could! For some reason it just didn't work for this beer."
"For me this is not a beer I can drink more than a few gulps out of the glass. However, I did use the rest of this brew to cook with. I had made a smoked gouda and cheddar cheese dip for serving with soft pretzels. I added the remainder of the beer and it came out fantastic! the dip didn't last the first quarter of the football game last week."
"This is a very easy-drinking beer to relax with. Given its relatively high alcohol, it could be dangerous, but nevertheless, quite enjoyable."
"Overall: This beer paired excellent with the beef jerky. I would say that this beer will pair great for smoked cookouts: steak, chicken, sausage. This is an excellent representation of the American Rauch Beer. I think Caldera Brewing Company did an excellent job."
"overall: A great Rauchbier, but not as good as the originals from Bamburg, Germany. Still, this is a great brew that any beer advocate would enjoy, great roasted smokey flavor that pairs well with smoked foods and beef jerky. I will gladly buy this again, as I am a huge fan of Rauchbiers."
"Overall, this is fantastic. It's well balanced and has all the great smoked qualities I love. After this beer I feel like I've sat around a campfire. An entire 22 ounce bottle might be a bit much for this flavourful beer though."
"I would certainly have this beer again. I will need to remind myself to really take time with it to get a full experience. Not many beers take you in so many directions as this rauchbier manages to do."

"From the 22 oz bottle bought at Best Damn in San Diego. Label says grains are smoked with cherry and beech wood. Definitely one of the best smoked beers I've had.Rich and sweet with a fragrant smokiness."
"O- Very tasty, aromatic and all-in-all a good, not great, highly drinkable beer."
"Review from 8/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a deep red/orange amber with little head and no lacing. Aroma of smoke and fruit. Strong smoke start with an average lager body. Light flavors of malt and fruit are overwhelmed by smoke, which leaves a chemically aftertaste, like burning electronic components. I didn't really enjoy this beer. I'm a fan of smoked beers, but the finish on this one was just way off for my taste. My experience was so much different from most others that I may have to revisit this beer in the future to see if I got an off bottle."

"O - I'm really surprised that it's not too sweet. I really like the mouthfeel, it's not too thick and syrupy to me, and the look is welcoming as well. The smell isn't incredibly smokey, nor is the taste, but it's enough to make you want more for sure. Just a great Rauchbier, I'd definitely pick this one up again. Cheers!"
"o: Not bad at all, in fact pretty dark good. It was a bit warm i think a few degrees colder would make for an even enjoyable experience."

"O: One of the more peculiar smoked beers I've ever had. Good, but not exceptional."
"Pours a murky light brown with a 1 inch fizzy tan head that settles to a film on the top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip back into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of smoked meat, smoked cheese, campfire smoke, etc. Taste is of smoked meat/cheese, campfire smoke, wood, and a slight cocoa/coffee flavor on the finish. The aftertaste is also cocoa/coffee with just a hint of the smoke flavors. This beer has a crisp level of carbonation with a bubbly mouthfeel. Overall this is a very good rauchbier from Caldera that has a bit of a different flavor than German rauchbiers."
"Feel is standard, smooth, but went flat quite fast."
""
"Very good example from Caldera here. Excellent use of the smoke with its subtleties..."

"A ruby pour with a half finger, off white head. Opaque. Smells like bacon it's so smoky. Very much a wood smoked scent, great on an autumn night. The flavor is full but not overbearing, smoky with a hint of sweetness. I dig this a lot, will seek out other rauchbiers for some comparison."
"This is delicious for the first 6-8oz, then it gets to be a little much. I imagine after having this a few times, you appreciate the flavors more. Maybe I should've picked a tamer rauchbier to be my first"
"O: I had heard some good things about this beer and it certainly lived up to my expectations. It's a very well crafted beer where the smoke asserts itself, but doesn't drown out everything else. I'll pick this up again without a doubt."
"Aroma and flavor alone are mouthwatering. Bravo. More please!!!"
"A flavorful brew. Strong smokiness is tempered by the rich caramel malt qualities. A real winner that could bring the non-smoke lover around."
"Great Rauchbier!"
"This was quite delicious. The pour made it seem a little lacking in carbonation, and while indeed it was light in carbonation I think it would have been awkward if it had been heavier considering the taste profile. This beer does such a good job of hitting the sweet and savory side of smoke. Nice big campfire smoke smell and taste without any roughness to it, with a nice smoked bacon savory sweetness. This is easy to drink and just downright delicious, would love to have a keg of this by my desk."
"Overall, this is a really well made smoked lager. The nose is wonderfull. But the beer turns out to be plenty drinkable, I usually am a one and done with smoked beers, not this one. Another great offering from Caldera."
"Best brew I've had in a while. First I've had from this brewery, if their others are even close to as good as this I won't be disapointed."
"Poured into a 1/2 liter stein a deep rich amber/bronze with a fluffy one finger head that took its time fading.Sweet smoke,brown,sugar,a bit of alcohol in the nose,mellow and sweetish,I found it appetizing.Cherry wood sweetness and light peppery spice in the nose,its gentle sweet smoke instead of in your face,mellow but assertive enough.A real nice smoked bock beer,I will grab a few of these this fall while eating alot of smoked meat off my smoker."
"O- Not too complex because of the intense smoke taste but it works excellent in this beer. I will definitely be picking this up again."
"Overall: If you love the idea of smoked anything actually you will love this beer. It is hands down one of the most smoky beers I have had to the point where it almost looses balance like say Alaskan smoked porter or Ass kisser smoked porter. However if you are into smoked beers this one is a must try"
"Overall at some point in trying this beer You Will Say Holy Shit! It is Unlike any any beer I've had and any smoked beer for that matter. Its very interesting but Good. Although it very hard to drink alot of it. Definitely a bottleshare."
"I could smell it all day. As far as drinking it, I'm cool with 1oz at a time, its that intense. If you like smoked beers, then check this out. If not, stay away. I kind of like them, trying to get into them more, so I'd try it again next time, but for now, I'm not worthy."
"A wonderful effort overall. I wouldn't go so far as to say world class, but the brew does have a nice bit of elegance which always gets more points from me. And the smokiness carries a lot of power without being too heavy."
"Overall its not bad, but as far as a rauch, feels like to much of that peated taste, dont know if I would pick it amongst other smoked beers."
"If I hadn't stuffed myself with Chinese food earlier in the night, I may have been more tempted to overdose on Rauch Ur Bock. Only kidding, I have a good idea when to stop. Warning, you may be temped buy more bottles after you try your first. In short, superb."
"D-Simply put--->OUTSTANDING! Quite possibly one of the finest Rauch beers I have had the pleasure of imbibing! This is a beer I wish I would have tried sooner so I could have gone out and stocked up on. Well done Caldera, this is a beer you should be VERY proud of!"
"Overall a really nice and interesting beer. I saw this on the shelf and hadn't tried anything yet from this brewery but looked interesting. Figured I would try it. It was really a nice beer. It definitely had a lot of smoky and meaty flavor to it! Very interesting and nice beer overall, I would drink it again."
"A good warming smoky beer."
"D/O: This Oregon-brewed rauchbeer develops some of the most intense woodsmoke essence encountered thus far, but it may be at the expense of the strong lager that is its base. Deciphels of the imports from Bamberg would find this beer's intensity surprising--if not off-putting--but it does struggle to leave any impression other than aggressively pungent woodsmoke."
"Complex enjoyable smoked. Tasty rich malt,caramel, woody,spicey, and balanced. Leans a tad to sweetness rather than bitterness. The smoke is significant in the aroma but not overwhelming. Above average mouthfeel. Yellow coloured body. Most drinkable.Thanks Augustgarage."
"This beer pours a dark amber color, with a perfect size head that did dispate quickly. The smell is strongly of malts, and a smokyness. The taste starts off very malty, smoked flavors, then finishs with a smoked sausage like flavor. The aftertaste is strongly of a smoked meat; and the flavor stays on your palette for some time, also nicely carbonated. Overall fantastic beer, very odd, but still enjoyable."
"The smoke was pretty intense. I enjoyed it okay, but I'll have to try some other Rauchbier to compare..."
"I'm not usually one to say this, but it's almost a touch malt-forward. Not that it's a bad thing. I think this is probably my favorite domestically produced Rauchbier I've had the pleasure of tasting. It really hits on all cylinders. A touch sweet and malt forward, but all in all, it does what it's going for and works beautifully. Definitely worth seeking out."
"Drinkability is really quite good for such a smoke bomb. No doubt inspired by Aecht Schlenkerla, with the body and color of the marzen, but the punch of the ur bock, it one of the best stateside examples of the style, which is rarely attempted and even more rarely successful. I have to say, this was really good, and with just a touch less phenols, would be up a notch easily."
"It was still a beer that I'm glad I grabbed. They don't make many in the style anyways."
"Notes: I'd be interested to see exactly how they brewed this beer. The smoke seems more of an extract additive than natural smoke. A bit much for me. However, a 12oz bottle would have been more appealing for one sitting and it has nothing to do with the moderate ABV. Its a rich SOB."
"Great beer. Loads of smoke and very authentic."
"D - A good beer. There are not too many smoked beers made, so for that reason alone I tried it. Well worth it, though it was not my favorite smoked beer."
"I found this a little difficult to drink at first due to its uniqueness, but grew accustomed to the pungency. This is a nice sipper if given a chance and I'm really glad I tried it. Recommended."
"I envy anyone who has access to growlers of this - the drinkability is superior as well as the flavor."
"A - a great Rauchbier, one I could enjoy frequently if it weren't such a large bottle, the mid 7% hinders it slightly too, but this was great to share and I loved the complexity of bock malts w/ smoke and smoothness from the lagering. It is a beer I would like to see more brewers attempt, this is a good representative of the style."
"So smoky, so tasty ... Love the different woods used on the malt. Alcohol is clean and nearly hidden until halfway through the bottle, a big quaff!!"
"M + D: Body feels a little lighter in the mouthfeel, but seems to pick up a little weight after going down, however little sense that might make. The alcohol content is perhaps a little high, but a little slower sipping never hurt anyone. Not a bad take on the style, though I think I personally would have enjoyed it better if the actual smokiness were a touch more robust."
"A beer that performs as advertised, smoke meat and lager all in one, not really a style I want more than one of but still tasty."
"This beer pours a very clear and attractive shade of ruby brown. Much less dark than I had anticipated, and carrying a diminutive, but attractive head of parchment foam that leaves very nice lace. The smoky aroma of this beer is very nice. It smells like the smoke that would waft from the smoker at a little restaurant in my home town of Traverse City, Michigan. Porky, sweet and delectable with notes of brown sugar. I suddenly have a huge craving for an ""all meat mess."" The flavor is also quite nice in that the smoke is not too overpowering. Other flavors include sweet dark malt, brown sugar, a bit of cinnamon and leather. Quite nice and well blended. The body is medium with a mouthfeel that seems a bit sticky, but is pretty good. Surprisingly drinkable, and would be great (of course) with BBQ. Not the first smoked beer I have had, but the first I have reviewed. This one makes me want to seek out more."
"D: This is the best of the Kettle Series I've had. A very well made rauchbier, in the same league as Schlenkerla at a cheaper price. Rare style too. Good job Caldera."
"D: Despite a heavenly aroma and feel and good flavor, this 'only' can muster a 4.0, simply due to a hefty alcohol girth. It's a touch on the sweet side (ur-bock) but the smokiness is well done. Sure it's worth a glass (or two) and is one I'd definitely have again."
