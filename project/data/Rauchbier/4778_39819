2.82,-9.9,3,3.5,2.5,2,3,"Sweet cherry wood, bacon (almost gamey) and milk chocolate on the nose; a very promising start. The palate has a fair bit of fizz and unfortunately this keeps the flvaours under wraps. Certainly underfruited when compared to the nose, and only a touch of milk chocolate pokes out. The Germans are a much better option even if they cost more.","Stew41","Jul 07, 2010"
3.3,5.4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"The bottle says this is a smoked dark ale, rather than a lager as is usually the case with a traditional rauchbier. Either way, it is an easy drinking, if ultimately unmemorable smoked beer.","LittleCreature","Feb 04, 2010"
2.94,-6.1,3.5,2,3,2.5,4,"All and all this beer is an exact example of Schlenkerla made for the mass Australian market, it could be improved craft beer wise by adding more captivating malts.","Tonygleeson","Nov 04, 2009"

3.42,9.3,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"d: Light on smoke for the style, but the chocolate notes made up for it. Not bad overall.","DIM","Jun 18, 2009"
3.48,11.2,4,3.5,3,4,4,"I'm not convinced there is a better Rauchbier brewed in Australia - this makes a very decent stab at the style. It really lacks fullness and sweetness on the palate, but otherwise very decent.","lacqueredmouse","Mar 04, 2009"
3.36,7.3,4,3,3.5,3,3.5,"D - This isn't too bad for the style. It has a reasonable amount of flavour and isn't overbearingly smoky. I can't see myself drinking lots and lots of this, but I can't see myself sessioning any Rauchbier.","dgilks","Aug 19, 2008"
1.95,-37.7,3.5,1,2,3,2,"That is not to say it isn't a well made beer though, just not to my taste.","Macca","Jul 17, 2008"
3.55,13.4,4,4,3.5,3.5,3,"An interesting beer. A unique mix of flavours, that whilst being enjoyable and somewhat compelling, doesn't actually add to the drinkability of the beer. And by the looks of the other reviews it seems they may have finally sorted out some of the earlier ""problems"". Give it a go.","koolk","Nov 28, 2007"
2,-36.1,2,2,2,2,2,"Brown to black in colour, almost completely flat, strange aroma (maybe slightly infected or oxidised). More or less no smoke aroma, and very little flavour at all. Had to pour it out.","foles","Beers"
3.26,4.2,3.5,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"D - Apart from the smell, which I suspect may be from too high a fermentation temp, this is a decent enough beer. Interesting yet not too full on like some other Rauchbiers can be.","brendan13","0"
