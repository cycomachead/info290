2.81,-18.1,4,3,2.5,3.5,2.5,"Just came on tap at my job. So it pours up a nice cloudy rust color with a lil decent white crown. Aromas consists of very faint malts, and absolutely NO smokiness or pork or any traditional Rauch aromas. Tastes of pretty damn sweet malts, a kiss of hop backdrop, and NO smokiness. Not impressed here. The medium-leaning-to-full body was great and the carbo was nice and crisp. It wasn't a terrible brew. A little too sweet in my opinion. But they sell this too you saying it keeps in the old Germanic Rauch tradition. But I've had quite a few Rauch brews FROM Germany and this wasn't like them. Sorry Circle. Not this time....","stumac","Oct 03, 2012"
