"Pours pale yellow and fizzy with a delicate off-white froth.  Smells peaty and smoky with light fruits in the background.  Sweet and fruity up front with an herbal hop bitterness sneaking in quickly before subtle smoked malts present themselves.  After a few pulls the smokiness starts to linger and excite the senses, but never never really kicks off.  Light bodied and easy going all the way.  Really digging the fact that Southern Star tackled this oh too rare style, but this one needs to grow some balls."
"Overall, exceptional. This is a keeper and will be in my fridge again."
"Way too much carbonation, I was burping all night."

"D/O- The only outstanding flaw I see here is Southern Star's Rauchbier is all but one dimensional. Take a clean pilsner and throw in 10% beechwood smoke malt...A good one to introduce others to the world of smoke. Thanks for the style want kojevergas!"

"Overall: A well done beer. Not going to have any trouble with the squat 1 pt. 1 oz. bottle, but there isn't much of a Wow factor, which again is a nice execution of a style that so often goes overboard."
"C+"
"This is a medium to light bodied brew with a crisp feel. Light yet enjoyable smokiness and very enjoyable without being overbearing. Smoked beers are not something I crave and sit down and plow through any real quantity of however this one I could probably go back for more."

"Decent attempt, but not exceptional; a few tweaks could make this an outstanding rauchbier."

"Thanks to fatsbelvadere for sending this in the HR Derby BIF. Poured from the bottle into a worthy burger snifter. Smells like hot dogs. A little bit of pork also. Probably the lightest raunchbier I've seen in awhile. 2 finger head dissipated real quick. Not digging the taste. Missing the campfire or pork/bacon taste I love. There's just a weird acidic smoke flavor. Disappointing, as its hard to find this style."

"Atmosphere is really nice. Bubbly white head, lots of carbonation. No lacing. Nose is malty and smoky... not much else. Light malt, with a nice hop, all wrapped up in a nice smoky blanket. Overall, this is a good quaff."

"Pours an orange color, some clarity, somewhat hazy. Soapy finger of tan color, dissipated quickly. The aroma was meaty, with more of a ham note and a bit of backing malt sweetness. Not very complex, but pleasant. Smoky notes on the taste, but ample malt sweetness up front that sort of take away from the smoke, making the smoke a bit muddled. Body was on the medium side at best, with a slight prickly bit of carbonation.. High drinkability, but could really use a more smoky smell and flavor to make this a real Rauch treat. Worth trying though as its not a style that is typically inundated and its more that decent."
"Smoke is a little lighter on the flavor than Id hoped, but it still has some terrific smokiness and meaty flavors. The grain is maybe a little too light, the mouthfeel suffers a bit because of it, I fear. This is definitely not quite up to the standards set by my homies in Bamburg. There is not a whole lot of complexity here, but the smoke flavors are nice and the beer maintains a clean, graininess all the way through. I could drink a lot of this, but not at the price point it is at currently - can this shit and sell it for $8 a four-pack….fine, but don’t charge $6 a pint for it."

"Poured into a glass mug. The beer pours hazy dull golden with a fizzy white head that doesn't dissipate very quickly. The beer has the campfire smell with wood smoke and there is some nice caramel malt sweetness in the nose as well. It reminds me of a nice smoked ham. The flavor of this beer takes me back to Aecht Schlenkerla Lagerbier, but it isn't as clean and it's smokier. Those smoky notes come through strongly in the flavor and there's some nice malt sweetness too. There's some hop bitterness in the back end playing with the smokiness. The body is light with moderate carbonation. The finish is dry and the smokiness lingers in the mouth. The drinkability is very high. This is a very good beer."

"A nice effort for sure, just not my style."
"Pours a pale yellow, cloudy body, with a creamy white head, lasting, good sized. Ham aroma, some smoke, some malt, sweet. Crisp taste, smokey ham. Creamy mouthfeel, clean aftertaste. A little too much after a while."
"Nice. I'm a fan of smoked malt in my beers and this seemed pretty darned spot on for the Rauchbier style. I wish they would can this on a regular basis, as I would definitely trade for some more."
"Pours a cloudy golden yellow color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, nice smoky notes, with some spice. The taste is malty, with some nice smokyness to it, slight spice thrown in. Medium body. Drinkable, I like this one, not bad at all."
"this brew pours up a clear golden color with a small white head. the nose is straight smoked pork sausage. the taste is very smokey, smoked meat, subtle sweet malts, faint hops. medium bodied, low carbo, very smoothe. A very sessionable Rauchbier. But that raises the question: Is it possible to buy a sixer of a Rauchbier and sit and enjoy? Can one person really enjoy drinking a light, easy smoked pork-flavored beer as a session? I dunno..."
"This has to be the most odd beer that I have ever tasted. I passed it around the table just to see what others thought. I got various descriptions. Smoked salmon, bacon, and salami were the words that they used. It smells like smoked meat it tastes like smoked meat. This may be the Rauchbier style. So if you are looking for that in your beer, this is the one. If not, I would look for something else to sip on."
"Very nicely done!!!"
"Overall, a very good example of the Rauchbier style. It's good to see a rauchbier available in Texas."
"I enjoyed this at the brewery for the Oktoberfest party. Not bad at all, but I think I need to be more familiar with the style. I hope to try some more of this in the near future."
"D - I've only had a few other rauchbiers before this one and I must say that it fits the style good compared to the others I've had this is a good beer to drink with grilled food worth trying"
