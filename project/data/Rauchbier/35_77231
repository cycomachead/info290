Flavors of sweet caramel up front, very rich, moderate smoke to the aftertaste with figs and raisins.  Alcoholic warming and lots of smoke.  With age the smoke dissipates, but still pretty strong with a goodly mouth feel, very wet but coating.  Decent, big, but decent.","Brutaltruth","Nov 29, 2014"

Not quite as good as Sam Adams' Double Bock, but it's still a quality beer. Lot's of taste, lot's of power, and pairs well with food.

4.11,15.1,5,4,4,4.5,4,"Samuel Adams Cinder Bock is a very clear, dense, copper beer with a soft, fluffy, yellowed foam that has great staying power. It's mostly smoke in the aroma, but a tart malt is detected as well. It smells a touch sweet. It's very full bodied and smooth with a creamy, chewy finish. The flavor is much like the the aroma: smoke and tart malt. There's a slightly sweet, herbal flavor that's somewhere between cola and a cough drop. Smoke is the dominant flavor here. When combined with the malt, it comes off as umami. There's a sort of salmiakki aftertaste. This is reasonably bold and complex. It's a sipping beer with a lot of character. There are subtleties to it, but the overall flavor is quite bold.","yesyouam","May 05, 2013"

2.95,-17.4,3.5,3.5,2.5,3,3,"This was possibly my most anticipated of the single batch releases thus far, save for Verloren. Let's get our smoke on, shall we? This stuff pours a clear russet-amber topped by a finger of ashy cream foam. The nose comprises mild beech smoke, light caramel, and a twinge of cocoa. The taste is a surprising barrage of sweetness, with caramel, light cocoa, and buttercream melding with some mild-though-substantial booze to form a harsh assault on the tongue. Throughout, a vein of mild smoke pervades, a mixture of hickory and beech, but it never comes close to even matching the sweetness nor does it ever get to stand on its own. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation, a lightly syrupy feel, and a fairly dry finish. Overall, a decent rauchbier, but one that comes across too sweet and not-smoky-enough for its own good.","TMoney2591","Oct 31, 2012"

The aroma is a bit light but I do get a solid caramel malt base with a touch of sweetness on top of that, reminiscent of ripe fruit. The whole thing is tied together by a touch of light smokiness, not a campfire smoke but a nice sweet smokiness. The taste is sweet bready malt somewhat thick with a bit of the alcohol apparent. The smoke is right there too my first thought was of bacon or at least the smell and taste of smoked bacon, that thought fades but only slightly as the meaty character does persist. This is a pretty thick beer as the carbonation is low and it has a drying smoky finish with the evident alcohol. Overall this is definitely interesting. I'm not a huge fan of rauchbiers but the smoke in this one is balanced pretty well with by a good malt character and the high alcohol content seems to help too.

Some lacing is left on the side of the glass as the head dissipates. Some bubbles can be seen rising from the bottom of the glass. Not much head is left at the top after dissipation. Mild smokiness hits the nose up front. There are sweet malts and some hops in the aroma as well. The smokiness is more intense in the flavor than it was in the aroma. It has a sweet malt background with spicy hops. It's well balanced with some alcohol taste. Even for 8.4%, the flavors are balanced enough to prevent this from tasting too boozy. I find I get used to the smokiness as I continue drinking this beer. The body is medium to full with adequate carbonation to liven this beer. The drinkability is high for a high ABV sipper. The beer is smooth. Overall, this is a great beer. I haven't tried many examples of this style, but I've been looking for a reason to like this style and explore it more. Good job for helping me on my journey, Boston Beer.","acevenom","Jun 14, 2012"

Lingering notes of smoke, wood, molasses, caramel, raisin, bread, toast, earth, and herbal on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic balance of smoky flavors with the fruitiness and malts. No cloying sweetness at all, fairly clean on the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a fairly creamy and slick mouthfeel that is quite nice.

It smells a bit like it might be peat-smoked even though there's no indication that it is, but that would explain that garbage smell. So would highly fermented malt heaviness, though, I suppose. This beer has a lot of doppelbock qualities. It doesn't taste like what the description of rauchbier describes. The smokiness is not too upfront and well balanced with sweet maltiness. The name and flavour would indicate to me that this is part doppelbock, part rauchbier. I'd say it's more on the doppelbock side, but that's just me. Damn if the combination isn't delicious as hell. Love the big malty sweetness of it, even if it is a bit sticky, almost cloying. Love the alcohol burn. And love that unique flavour added by the rauch (smoke).

Flavor has a malty core with tones of smoke, barbecue and caramel and a hint of yeast. It's almost like drinking a well-smoked sausage. (Ugh - I'm a vegetarian, but this is beer!)

The smokiness really takes the sweet edge off of what I'm assuming is a fairly similar recipe to their Imperial Series Double Bock. I can still taste the sweetness, but it's not cloying like I found their double bock. The mouthfeel is on the heavier side of medium-bodied, and the drinkability is pretty alright.

The alcohol is scarily barely noticeable. This one is right up there with the best I have had this year.

Perhaps if the presence of smoked malt were a little more noticeable, this beer would be a winner, but as is, it's a bit rough. Maybe I just don't like the way Samuel Adams handles bocks, but this is not what I typically look for in the style.","mrfrancis","Feb 10, 2012"

The smell of the beer is super smokey. The taste of the beer is too smokey I think. I wasn't digging this ones flavor too much. The mouthfeel was surprisingly heavy I thought. Overall this beer was didn't go over too well with me mainly because of the flavor. I prefer the Bonfire Rauch that came in the Autumn variety pack more.","Knapp85","Feb 05, 2012"
3.67,2.8,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Poured from a bottle into a stemmed pilsner, the beer is a bright, crisp, slightly hazed chestnut-auburn coloring with a thin, small bubbled, off-white head that rests a very low eighth of an inch. Aromas of campfire charcoal and darkly sweet caramel flood the nose. The beer carries the smoked qualities directly into the taste, with a meaty and charcoal burst of flavors on the forward tongue, followed by more subtle and sweet characteristics, including carmel and toffee. Very smooth and almost creamy in mouth, the brew has a subtle aftertaste of toffee and cream, with just a hint of smoke. The finish is quick for the most part, with a bit of the smokey "residue" remaining on the roof of the mouth and the back of the tongue. Good venture into the world of Rauchbier for BBC. Not a bad beer at all.","GarthDanielson","Feb 05, 2012"
