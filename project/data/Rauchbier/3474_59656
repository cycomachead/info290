3.72,1.1,3,3.5,4,4,3.5,"22 ounce bottle. Served in a mug, the beer pours a slightly hazy orange/amber/brown color with a half inch light tan head that fizzled away pretty quickly. Not much lacing at all. Aroma is pretty much all smoked meats/malt (bacon), along with a bit of wood. The taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes mostly like smoked malt/meats, and there's also some wood and an apple juice flavor noticeable too. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and coating with a decent amount of carbonation. I think it's a solid brew, it's definitely worth trying.","bluejacket74","May 10, 2012"
3.08,-16.3,3,2.5,3.5,3,3,"Tried hard but couldn't enjoy it. I don't know if the word Bacon on the label messed with my head but the first hickory filled sip had me thinking a slice of bacon had slipped into the bottle. Had to pour out the rest and move on to a beer of known quality and/or likability.","Vierenner","Jan 02, 2012"

3.29,-10.6,3,4,3,3.5,3,"Just not the beer for me. I can appreciate the concept and the attempt, the final result leaves me wanting more than it can deliver. One pour is enough and then time to move on.","kzoobrew","Jan 12, 2011"
4.03,9.5,2.5,4.5,4,3,4.5,"D- Very high drinkability for me. Very happy I have another one. The taste isn't too heavy, but the smell is dank. I am very glad this one delivered. Bacon beer baby!","backfat","Dec 05, 2010"

3.45,-6.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The body of the beer is just shy of medium. I think a little less fizzyness would improve the drinkability. I would certainly grab another bottle of this should I see it great bang for the buck at $5.00 a bomber.","nlmartin","Nov 07, 2010"

4.05,10.1,4,4,4,4.5,4,"M/D - Mouthfeel is about perfect, coats the tongue but still light and goes down smoothly. Very drinkable for the style and worth a look for rauchbier fans.","mwa423","Jul 28, 2010"

4.32,17.4,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Not a huge fan of smoked beverages other than Alaska's smoked porter and a few other smoked porters. So i was surprised when i found myself enjoying this more than i expected to. Smells like smoked bacon right off the bat for me. it marries well with the bock style. very impressed.","mazdarx","Beers"
