Smoke waves throughout, combining with hops to create a sensation of char. Fairly complex, this seems to be less smoky than their other beers, from what I recall...in flavor, anyway. A little more bitter than I'd prefer. Becomes herbal as it warms.","barczar","Saturday at 08:02 AM"

4.21,-1.2,4,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,"Good smoked beer. Poured into an Amstel pint mug. Muddy brown color with a lot of light coming through. Big, antique white head with slightly better than average retention and broken bands of lacing on the mug. Aroma is great. Smoky with some sweet malt underneath. Taste is exceptional as well. The smoke is the dominant flavor but it does not overpower the senses. Behind the smokiness  is a fairly light crisp lager that is slightly sweet. Very drinkable.  Mouthfeel is light like a lager should be and crisp. The smokiness is not overdone, you could drink a few of these.  An outstanding beer.","JayQue","Friday at 06:34 PM"

4.22,-0.9,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"500 ml bottle into pine glass; no bottle dating, but is a recent release. Pours lightly cloudy deep ruby red color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of huge wood smoke, caramel, toast, brown bread, brown sugar, light char, herbal, pepper, light pine, and herbal/smokey earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/bready/smoked malt and earthy hop notes; with great strength. Taste of big wood smoke, caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, light char, herbal, pepper, light pine, and herbal/smokey earthiness. Fair amount of herbal/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of wood smoke, caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, light char, herbal, pepper, light pine, and herbal/smokey earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready/smoked malt and earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Very clean on lager flavor with zero yeast ester notes present. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and slightly creamy/sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome hoppy Rauchbier style. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready/smoked malt and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 29, 2015"

4.12,-3.3,4.25,4,4,4.5,4.25,"Served in .5l willibecker at Track 84. Pours a deep mahogany with a dense, quarter inch, off-white head. Nose is smokey with some caramel notes - definitely a smoked meat quality, but not as apparent as in some of the other Schlenkerla beers that I've had. Taste expresses smoked pork, some earthy char at the back and some caramel which is a bit more toasty than sweet in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is medium-light in body with a crisp carbonation and a touch of dryness at the finish. Overall, a bit more subdued than the Marzen and drinks easier, somewhat akin to a smokey brown ale; however, I have to say that if I'm going for a Rauchbier, I'd have to go with the Marzen.","Jwale73","May 17, 2013"

Was a bit worried about how the taste would be, but man was I blown away... it tastes like a campfire, but it's also delicious. Smoked meat and bacon flavors come through and it's flavorful and incredibly well balanced. Goes down smoothly with a great finish.

Aside from the dark amber color, it's also a crisper and a touch lighter. The smoked malts are cleaner. As in, this beer doesn't just taste like bacon, it has a dusty flour and bready malt undertone to is. The dark malts are hard to pull out, but there's a slight hit of smooth caramel malt.

The aroma is smoky with some charred wood, smoked meat, and a mild maltiness... mostly it smells of sweet aromatic smoke and thatâs just fine. The flavor is surprisingly dry and bitter while maintaining that strong smoky character I hate to say smoked meat again as this does not actually taste like meat, but rather a bit like the smoke flavor you get with a very high quality smoked meat. The beer has a nice chocolate note to it as well, and this is perhaps one of the most complex of the Schlenkerla lineup. A real treat, I canât wait till it comes around next year.","BieresDesMoines","Jul 19, 2011"

There's a little bit of sweetness, too. Light on the tongue, less sweet than Schlenkerla's marzen or ur-bock, this is sort of like a session rauchbier. Unlike their helles, the meaty, woody smoke character doesn't hold any punches here; it's the dominant flavor, with a bready, toasted malt backbone rounding out the flavor. I really enjoyed this one on the whole, possibly my favorite from this brewery behind their excellent helles.","largadeer","May 12, 2011"

The nose carries a light amount of oak as well as what is reminiscent of oak. Light malt with a bit of toast. Smoke is not overwhelming. Smoke hits the palate really well in the flavor--not overpowering, but definitely the dominant character. Light woody and earthy characteristics and a bit of toasted malt. The mouthfeel is really nice--a bit of smoke as well as an almost-creamy texture. Really, really well done. One of the best smoked beers I've come across.","Thorpe429","May 10, 2011"

This one isn't as smoky/meaty as the others; they've turned down the smoke/charrness to let the hops peek through as this beer is light, smooth, and there's a touch of sticky sweetness all in there - but yes, mainly a smoky beer with a dry finish.

Obviously smoked beers tend to be something that most people either love or hate, but I have always thought that a few bad examples have given the whole style a bad name. This beer, even more than the rest of the Schlenkerla lineup proves that theory with its balanced and masterful use of smoke in the beer's flavor profile. It blends so well with the malt and turns a pretty standard lager into something truly extraordinary.

Lacing is sticky and almost leaves sand like bubbles on the glass, then leaves a creamy swirl in the body of the liquid. Aroma is certainly smoky and toasted. Campfire and beef jerky, both peppered and kippered come to mind. Taste is backed by a bit of malt sweetness but the smoked flavor dominates. No my favorite style, really hard to review a beer in a style I don't love but I can't imagine drinking more than one of these in a sitting even if this style is your favorite.","KickbacksSteve","Jul 01, 2010"
4.05,-4.9,4,4,4,4.5,4,"All the carbonation seems to have been knocked out of this beer during its service from the tap, so it is quite smooth feeling, but it still has some viscous heft to it. The smoke flavors are more subtle than the aroma would have suggested, but it is still the dominant note (especially in the finish). Up front there is a nice, sweet maltiness that helps to balance the smoke. There are almost some berry like flavors to this beer; perhaps from the maillard maltiness that is not really caramel, but definitely rich. Flavors of umami and peat-smoke (even though this is beechwood smoked malt) are also noticeable here. This is definitely a beer that has a big smoke character to it, but I am a sucker for beers like this so it definitely hits the spot.","Gueuzedude","Jun 27, 2010"

Slightly nutty with lots of toasty malt and bready yeast notes contributing to the full body with a surprisingly strong oak presence and some nice crisp hop bitterness. The hop presence was much more prominent that I had expected and it was a very pleasant surprise. Although these other flavors are present, this beer is still dominated by smoked malt. Lots of smokey campfire flavor with hints of bacon, barbecue, charcoal and burnt toast. As in the nose, there are a lot of different elements contributing to the complexity of this beer. In one sip you get smoke, oak, nut, caramel and bitter dry hops all complimenting each other without anything becoming to overpowering, even the smokiness.

There is quite abit of bitterness in the mix as well that adds to the intrigue, the bitterness especially makes this far from one dimensional. The taste is similar with a great herbal bitterness that nicely balances the smoke. Very complex with all sorts of things changing moment by moment- bitter, sweet, smokey, herbal, woody. Mouthfeel is a bit woody and tannic which also plays well with the smoke and cuts through the big flavors. Extremely enjoyable. I must have had six of these over the week it was on.

ItÂs less intimidating then some of the others out there, smoke wise, but the chewy meatiness is just great. What a unique mouthfeel!","DaPeculierDane","Mar 31, 2006"

DonÂt get me wrong, killer beer, I could drink it all day, but compared to the other rauchbierÂs from the same brewery itÂs mediocre. Sort of the Aecht Shlenkerla baby rauch.","taez555","Mar 19, 2006"
4.54,6.6,4,5,4.5,4,4.5,"Poured in a big wine glass, it had a strong aroma of sweet smoke. Not bitter smoke, or woody smoke, but sweet. One of the best smelling beers I have ever encountered. The head was moderate and somewhat grayish in color, the beer fairly dark in the glass. A milder taste than other rauchbiers I've had, sweeter, hoppier, gentler, but still undeniably smoky and strong. Another poster mentioned being reminded of toasting marshmallows by the fire and that is the perfect way of describing the blend of flavors. Very drinkable and not too strong, it would have been easy to down the whole glass, but it was worth a slow drink.","charlieg","Mar 18, 2006"

I was deeply dissapointed when the growler was finished. Guess I'll have to wait until next year - or brew my own.","Longstaff","Mar 28, 2005"
