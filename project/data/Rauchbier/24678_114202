3.73,9.7,3,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,"Overall I thought this was a pretty nice beer and I thought it was a nice and pretty unique example of a Rauchbier, I thought the fruit aspect worked well with the lighter medium smoke and the combination was somehow a little refreshing which i liked, it's like a smoked beer for the summer. This beer had pretty good drinkability, it was smooth, pretty crisp, slightly crispy, strangely refreshing, not filling at all and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, I don't think I would mind drinking a couple pints of this and like I said i think it makes for a good warmer weather Rauchbier. What I liked the most about this beer was that the smoke was at just the right level and I also thought the mouthfeel and drinkability were pretty good, those were the highlights of this beer. What I like the least about this beer was that more of those Vivant yeast flavors didn't come through, I think that would make this beer just a little better. I would buy this again if I had the chance, it's just the type of Rauchbier I want to drink in warmer weather and I would recommend this to most people, I think it's worth trying at least once. All in all I was pretty happy with this beer, it was just about the same as I remember it and I just think it's another tasty and unique beer made by Brewery Vivant. It isn't my favorite Rauchbier, but it might be the most drinkable one I've had and it's the only one that I would call a little refreshing. It's not my favorite Vivant beer, but it's got a solid place in their specialty lineup. Nice job guys, this was a very solid and unique Rauchbier, keep up the good work.","StoutHunter","Apr 17, 2014"
