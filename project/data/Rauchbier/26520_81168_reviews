"O - I enjoy S&D more.  The coffee compliments the smokiness, but there was some underlying sweetness that turned me off."
""
"The coffee and hint of smoke really make this beer delicious. This is perfect on a cold evening by the fire."
""
"Excellent coffee nose, not subtle coffee taste, but very good."

"Smoky malts seem to awake more as I drink the beer but the coffee is most of the show here as it seems just as strong as the malt base. I have always been a fan of the base beer and I am now just as big of a fan of this iteration. Fresh coffee and Rauchbier means good."

"Smells decent, light hint of smoke, little bit of coffee. Pretty much same with the flavor, with occasional hints of light chocolate. I just now got a little toasted coconut on the end. Slight bitterness lingers for a bit. I've had Smoke and Dagger a handful of times, but probably variations of it more than the original. I'd really like to compare it to this side by side. Solid beer overall, anyway."

"It won't change your life, but it is a good take on getting a coffee beer and making it seemingly cleaner and more light bodied in character. I do wish there were more smokiness and representation of the yeasty profile at hand - it gets a little drowned out overall. Can't say its my favorite from these guys, but can't say there's anything particularly wrong with it."
"500ml bottle served in a stange. Pours the color and clarity of cola with a fizzy, one inch, tan-colored head. Head eventually settles into a 1/8th inch cap with some residual strands of lacing left in the wake of the receding brew. Nose suggests chocolate malt, roast and a hint of coffee. Taste is roasty with a metallic quality in the forefront. Chocolate character is almost non-existent and the overall flavor profile comes off a bit watered down. Finish is slightly bitter and lingers between quaffs. Mouthfeel is light and a bit watery with a prickly carbonation. Overall, I have to say that I'm a bit disappointed by this one. Definitely not getting a rauchbier vibe either - not sure if it is classified correctly."
"Pours dark brown with a medium foamy tan/mocha head. Aroma has dark chocolate, roasty malts, and a slight woody note. Flavor still has plenty of dark chocolate but adds nice roastiness, mild coffee notes that help cut the sweetness, and must the faintest hint of woody smoke. Mouthfeel is full and the finish lingers to a blend of coffee and faint dark chocolate."

"Regular Smoke and Dagger is great, the cask version of this one is just ok, not all that exciting."

"O - Decent, but I wouldnt actually get this again, there's much better coffee beers out there, this one isnt smooth and refined as you'd want it, but hey, I'm sure there's people who would prefer this over some others"
"This is a very good rauchbier that benefits from the addition of coffee. But the enhancement is not particularly profound. Smoke & Dagger is already a great beer. This is simply a nice spin on it. Worth a try."

"This is the first time a JA beer has left me disappointed."

"O: Solid beer but unimpressive, in my opinion. Nothing special and a tad disappointing. Tastes and smells like they just took the base beer and dumped in some coffee concentrate. Jack's Abby doesn't make a bad beer and rarely makes a mediocre beer but this is a case of a mediocre offering from them."
"This bottle was graciously laid on me by Jamie M during a Lancaster visit. He knows I'm a fan of All Things Lager. If I had an issue with this really fine beer, it would be that it verges on being out of balance, although the combination of pronounced flavors don't obscure its lager basis. Although cold this evening, the weather isn't quite bad enough to warrant drinking this hefty and delicious black lager. Flakes may be necessary."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is crisp easy reinking and enjoyable. A nice subtle difference from the base brew. If I was going to complain about anything with this, it would be that after having the regular smoke and dagger just before drinking this, the coffee inclusion was almost undetectable. Thanks again Heath for this one."

"O: Smoked beers are easily my most hated style. This one has a decent sweetness to it to help balance out the acrid smoke (like the base beer). The addition of coffee helps even more and adds some nice complexity at the same time. I feel that the coffee could be a little stronger and it would really set this brew apart, but Jack's Abby isn't huge on making adjuncts over the top so I understand."

"O -- Really good. Cheers."

"O - Overall I am relatively shocked here. I am used to home runs from Jack's Abby and this one, with the watery mouthfeel and shockingly mediocre appearance...at a loss for words. I guess every brewery has its flukes but yeah, let down by this one."

"From the new batch, poured from the bottle into a Tree House snifter. Bought the coffee that they used from Red Barn also, but that's for coffeeadvocate.com. Pours nice and dark, smell of roasted coffee and faint smoke. About a finger head, and that was from a pretty vigorous pour. No retention to speak of, no lacing either. Taste is awesome, roasted coffee up front, mild smoke (not nearly as much as i would like, but this isn't targeted to a rauchhead like me.) Very easy drinker, and a definite upgrade from the regular version. I don't know how often they are planning on bottling this, but definitely pick one up!"

"I recalled the regular smoke and dagger not having as much smoke, and there's not a LOT of coffee notes, but its still quite nice."

"Had this one at a recent tasting while Mississipping was in town! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller taster flute. Poured a massively dark red-brown with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, powdered chocolate, roasted malt, cream, and coffee. The flavor was of sweet malt, cream, coffee, milk chocolate, and earth. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. Based on the other brews from Jack’s Abby that I’ve had, they have the aroma aspect of beers absolutely nailed. Nice notes of sweetness and roastiness from the coffee going on kept this one really well balanced and enjoyable to the nose. The flavor had some of the same notes, but it just wasn’t as robust and well balanced as the aroma going on. Still definitely worth your time trying if you get the chance."

"O: More smoke than coffee in this one. Nothing dominates too much though, and execution is quite good. A well crafted brew for sure that was certainly very interesting/unique. Definitely worth trying, though I certainly prefer jacks hoppy lagers."
""
"Overall, I really enjoy this beer for the style. It's one of the better coffee beers I've had and isn't an overpowering stout. Better than regular Smoke and Dagger too!"

"Overall pretty good, nice coffee addition, the nutty malts are nice as well, coffee is fairly fresh with no burnt flavors, and the smoke is just in the right balance. A good beer but nothing to write home about."
"Pretty drinkable. I should have bought more than one. Good but not great stuff. Nice change of pace from the regular S & D."

"What an interesting beer. I like the idea, coffee with the S&D makes perfect sense, but I almost wish it was bigger. The coffee doesn’t overpower, but the lager really doesn’t give it enough backbone. You almost need a double or imperial S&D to give it some more girth. Otherwise the clean lagered body with the coffee just makes it taste like watered down coffee. Great coffee, but watered down. It’s still a really great beer though, despite what might read like my negative review. Kudos to JA for pushing the envelope. Who makes a coffee rauchbier?"
