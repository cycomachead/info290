4.1,4.9,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Got in a BIF from ZebraCakez. 12 ounce bottle into lager glass, bottled on 11/24/2014. Pours crystal clear deep reddish brown color with a 1 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big chocolate, cocoa, coffee, wood smoke, toast, dark bread, herbal, and roast/smokey earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of roast/bready malt and smoke notes; with great strength. Taste of chocolate, cocoa, coffee, wood smoke, toast, dark bread, herbal, and roast/smokey earthiness. Fair amount of roast/herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, coffee, wood smoke, toast, dark bread, herbal, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and robustness of roast/bready malt and smoke flavors; with a great roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Very clean on lager flavors with no yeast ester notes present. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a very smooth, fairly crisp, and lightly bready/chalky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent smoked schwarzbier style. All around great balance and robustness of roast/bready malt and smoke flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 19, 2015"

AROMA: background sweet and roasted malts from the base beer with coffe and chocolate notes. faint smoke notes with balance towards the base beer. some DMS is present. APPEARANCE: dark with a ruby color tint. average tanned head with good retention. TASTE: roasted coffe-like notes with a touch of pleasant and balanced smokiness. some sweet chocolate notes also present. low bitterness with a dry finish. PALATE: medium-low with medium-low carbonation. OVERALL: a good marriage between a dark lager and smoked malts, that would benefit with a bit more smokiness.","titvs","0"

It's bitter coffee up front and a clean, crisp finish that leaves a resiny hops bite on the back palate. The description of it being a cross between a rauch and a schwartzbier is apt. The smokiness is there, especially on the nose, but it's not all in your face. The flavor and body are much more schwarzbier.","Gwalchgwynn67","Jan 08, 2014"

I like that complexity of this, especially for a lager. jacks abby has really redefined what it means to be a lager, and beers like this are a perfect example of their crusade against convention.","StonedTrippin","Dec 19, 2013"

The label mentions that this skirts the line between porter and schwarzbier and I see why - the blend of chocolate, smoke, grainy acidty and German hop character brings to mind just that. Medium-light in body and with a medium-high level of carbonation, this feels quite good on the palate. The carbonation does thin out the mouthfeel a little bit, though. Smoke and dark chocolate linger on the finish. Very nice.","DefenCorps","Dec 06, 2013"

This poured a very dark color with little head. Very malty and caramels smell, and the taste doesn't disappoint. Nice crisp taste and the hints of smoke are not overwhelming which I like.

It is a roasted malt paradise for the eyes and for the palate. The full bodied taste is not heavy and the mouthfeel is silky and smooth. There is a touch of hop floral on it that livens the dark flavors but doesn't compete with them. It has the faintest touch of fruit. Another great beer from Jack's Abby.","utopiajane","Nov 10, 2013"

The aroma brings a deep toasted brown bread and chocolate malt medley with a bit of a juniper bite over the top. Very appealing. The flavor comes on with a fairly sharp grassy hop tang which is immediately followed by a charcoal malt idea. This is definitely a bit brighter and more bitter than I anticipated with subtle smokey qualities. It's a tad thin in feel but offers a brisk carbonation in what otherwise is a medium-light bodied beer. There's a vague chalkiness but nothing negative. This generally strikes me as a grassy, vegetable sort of brew with a good smokey-malt theme that makes for a decent overall result. A bit too grassy for my tastes, but not bad at all.","Durge","Jun 20, 2013"

The nose is like a campfire, heavily smoked with layers of hickory, ash, and roasted malts. The taste meets the palate with some caramel malt character which brings a little sweetness before the smoke cuts through. Roasted malts and smoke take turns as it finishes with heavy woody smoke character. This is a very flavorful and smokey rauchbier, lots of depth in the flavor. The mouthfeel is somewhat thin with moderate to high carbonation. Overall, a winner, especially if smoked beers are your thing.","homebrew311","Dec 10, 2012"

4.38,12,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This beer is named after Jack’s Abby’s two brewery cats, Smoke and Dagger. It pours a very dark brown color, bordering on black, but sits in the glass as just plain clean black with a light white fluffy head that has the barest hints of tan in it. On the nose, the beer smells nicely smoked with rich beechwood notes and slight chocolate and black coffee. The beer smells very much of woodsy smoke, but the smell still carries the clean lager aromatics that are expect from the style. I was hoping for a little more pungency, but now that the beer is before me I think too much smell would off-put its lager qualities and ruin the beer. On the taste, the beer is richly layered with woodsy smoke. In the initial gulp there is big Beachwood notes that are slowly enveloped with rich smoke and then roasted chocolate malts, and then rich dark coffee, all the while shinning with the rich complexities of the beechwood. In the middle of the taste the chocolate malts do provide a slight burp of sweet that borders on strange, but is quickly enveloped by the other complexities of the beer, and dutifully managed. Citrus is also present in the taste as a faint ghost that haunts the latter half of the swallow. The aftertaste of this beer is light with Beechwood smoke and hints of coffee, but nothing more. This beer is meaty with flavor, and deliciously easy to sip. On the mouth, the beer feels thin, crisp, and refreshing, as all lagers should. Carbonation is effervescent but not prickly, working to nicely cleanse the palate and ready it for another sip. After each sip the mouth is left only slightly dry with woodsy smoke and with the faintest hints of sticky saliva griming the tongue and roof of the mouth with the sweet smoke taste. Overall this beer is another success from Jack’s Abby, I think I like it more than the version brewed with coffee, as this beer stands perfectly on its own, and I feel that the coffee cuts through some of the complex flavors of this beer. This beer is very drinkable and completely worthy of a try, with great locally sourced ingredients and an even better taste. It even pairs well with Gorgonzola cheese! Try this beer!","Maxwell","Nov 09, 2012"

3.95,1,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Overall, this is very nice fare, boasting a well-rounded, nicely balanced, and flavorful body that is everything a schwarzbier should be, with a tantalizing touch of smoky peat added that pushes the flavors to wonderful heights. It’s not necessarily a beer that brings anything new to the style, but instead prefers to set itself aside by being simply a finely-crafted example, and a model of understated perfection in craft.","jondeelee","Beers"

After the fireworks settle, you end up with a thick, dense, creamy tan head. Looks great, and always fun to watch. Aromas of coffee and chocolate, both roasted bitter and creamy, with a toffee highlight. This smells like a sweettooth satisfier. Flavors are roasted and slightly smokey initially, with a nutty and coffee backbone. The smoke continues throughout as there is an unveiling of charcoal and campfire qualities that take over the palate. Toffee sweet intertwines through the palate as a highlight and backbone at the same time. The body is light and crisp, almost to the point of being watered down. Great, coating cling along the glass as you drink. The aftertaste is smokey, with a dose of the rich, sweet background flavors. Smooth, creamy and clean finish, this is a tasty brew. Very drinkable and very tasty.","GarthDanielson","Sep 03, 2012"

4,2.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a very dark brown with a fluffy off-white head. Smell is a nice mix of roasted malt, chocolate and smoke that all blend together quite nicely and none of the aromas are too overpowering. The smoke is more prominent in the flavor than in the nose, but still doesn't overpower as the roastiness and chocolate hold up against the smoke nicely. Interestingly, the more I drink the less smoke I taste and the more the roasted malts come through, not sure if that's a product of the warming or just getting accustomed to the smoke flavor. Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this comes off as a nice, smokey schwarzbier. I'm impressed that the schwarzbier characteristics shine through as well as they do and balance out the smoke nicely. I like this one more than the Cascadian Schwarzbier as I feel like the smoke suits the beer better than the hops do.","starrdogg","Aug 09, 2012"

4.03,3.1,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Smoke & Dagger pours jet black, with a surprising three and a half fingers of khaki colored foam. Head retention is very good, and lacing, while night quite sheet-like, is very good. The nose has a nice balance between roasty grains and smoke, though I'd say the roast leans more towards coffee than chocolate. The flavor profile is more of the same. The front end is a nice, smooth black coffee, with some subtle chocolate undertones. Smoky, BBQ type flavors then begin to creep in and build in intensity, eventually taking over the beer completely by the finish. The body is sturdy, while maintaining a dry enough finish to avoid becoming overly full or rich. The carbonation has a little bit of pep to it, but stays on the lower end of the spectrum. Smoke and Daggers was my first Jack's Abby brew, and I definitely dug the smoky schwarzbier vibe.","axeman9182","Aug 07, 2012"

3.68,-5.9,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"500ml bottle served in a Reissdorf stange. Pours the color and clarity of cola with a loose, 2.5 inch, khaki-colored head that sizzles and pops as it slowly fizzes down to an 1/8th inch cap. Thick, textured swaths of lacing are revealed during the tasting. Nose expresses hints of chocolate and roast with the merest suggestion of smoke towards the back end. Taste follows nose; however, it all comes off a bit watery and closer to a Schwartzbier than a Rauchbier in my opinion. Mouthfeel is light in body and starts off with an almost silky feel at the tip of the tongue, but quickly yields to a more watery consistency. Carbonation is assertive without being prickly or gassy. Overall, this beer is lacking in the smokiness I've come to associate with the style, and I'm actually okay with that - I didn't realize this was a Rauchbier when I purchased it. That said, a decent brew, but definitely closer to a Schwartzbier than a Rauchbier and there are better examples of Schwartzbiers out there if that is what you are looking for.","Jwale73","Jul 02, 2012"

4,2.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Toasty dark roasted malt, but not overdone. The slight sweet note is pushed aside as this brew finishes crisp. Coffee, a little smokiness, mild bitterness, smooth malt. Highly drinkable and medium bodied, but maybe on the light side of that. Enjoyable and refreshing. Worthy.","OtherShoe2","Apr 21, 2012"

After only having 2 of Jack's Abby's beers, I can already say they are one of the best breweries in the state and even all of New England.","VelvetExtract","Apr 18, 2012"

4.2,7.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Mouthfeel is solid- medium light body (can't say light cause it's a dark beer) with a light and smooth lager carbonation. The more you drink, the more the smoke comes through. This would be excellent with anything grilled.","Hopdaemon39","Apr 18, 2012"

3.83,-2,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Poured a 1.5"" cappucino head with long life. The body pours dark but clear but in masstone it's a deep umber brown verging on coffee. The smell is very mild and mainly roasted malt. Taste is much weaker than I was expecting but has the crispness of a lager, a touch of smoke, and a little roasted malt. And easy drinking enjoyable and not boring lager.","MoreThanWine","Apr 06, 2012"

4.03,3.1,4.5,4,4,4,4,"O: Pretty simple rauchbier. I'm honestly not a fan of smoked beers at all but this one isn't overpowering. The smoke doesn't just taste like liquid smoke either, tastes like hickory BBQ. The chocolate and coffee compliments it well too.","Dope","Apr 05, 2012"

4.05,3.6,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Very drinkable, this is not a smokey beer at all. While the smoke exists, it really is merely to complement the other flavors, not overpower them. If you want a smokey rauchbier, you'll be disappointed. I, however, really appreciated the subtly, balance, and immense drinkability.","rinhaak","Feb 26, 2012"

4.07,4.1,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"O - This was a really nice Rauchbier that was super-easy to drink for a style I find hard to have much of. I would say this is more of a lager with some smoke qualities added in there. Good stuff, would drink again.","Sean9689","Feb 05, 2012"
4.27,9.2,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"D - A very good and authentic Rauchbier. This isn't the most sexy style of beer, and I was a bit apprehensive about having 2L of Rauchbier. I needn't have worried about it, as I returned to this for numerous refills during the course of the Super Bowl.","MasterSki","Jan 29, 2012"

4.17,6.6,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Overall nice, smoke is done well without the heavy smoke flavor, not too bitter or tannic either, and nice soft malt and lager flavors, nice oats and even a hint of chocolate coming late. Much different than anything I've had before I think, and done fairly well. They easily could have gone overboard on anything, but didn't. Perhaps a touch more of the lager flavors and crispness would have been nicer.","jlindros","0"

3.62,-7.4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"I was graciously given a growler from a friend who made a visit to the brewery last weekend. He knew my affinity for dark beers. Poured into a tall beer glass. Super dark black body. Great looking white head forms with a vigorous pour, but that soon fades. The body looks a bit undercarbonated once the beer has sat for a bit. The smell is a wonderful aroma of campfire smoke. The taste is great too. Love the earthy, peaty aroma. But I get less smoke flavor as I drink, and more of a burnt-end brisket taste. While BBQ is not a bad thing, it's more charcoal flavor than smoke. Mouthfeel was a bit thin, but that's what I expected from a smoked lager. Overall it's a decent beer, and I liked it better than the Red Lager or the IPL. This one just seemed more unique. A nice intro the brewery and I wish them well.","morebeergood","Aug 15, 2011"
