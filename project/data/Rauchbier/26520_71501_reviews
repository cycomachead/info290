"o: I am surprise how much I like this beer. Especially considering how little I like beechwood. I will definitely keep more of an eye out for this style."
"The feel of this beer is light but boarders a medium bodied beer. There just is a smoothness that helps this beer be very drinkable it is easy to drink it pretty fast."

"Very nice, but doesn't blow you away."

"This is one of the best rauchbiers I have ever had.  The smoke is very subtle and blends in nicely to the lager.  Highly recommend this one."
""
""

"Wonderfully drinkable brew with almost enough smoke quality and medium body. Taste improves as it warms."

"Yes what new four yesterday"
"Got in a BIF from ZebraCakez. 12 ounce bottle into lager glass, bottled on 11/24/2014. Pours crystal clear deep reddish brown color with a 1 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big chocolate, cocoa, coffee, wood smoke, toast, dark bread, herbal, and roast/smokey earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of roast/bready malt and smoke notes; with great strength. Taste of chocolate, cocoa, coffee, wood smoke, toast, dark bread, herbal, and roast/smokey earthiness. Fair amount of roast/herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, coffee, wood smoke, toast, dark bread, herbal, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and robustness of roast/bready malt and smoke flavors; with a great roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Very clean on lager flavors with no yeast ester notes present. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a very smooth, fairly crisp, and lightly bready/chalky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent smoked schwarzbier style. All around great balance and robustness of roast/bready malt and smoke flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"Smoke & Dagger should prove once and for all that smoked beers can be perfectly palatable and easily enjoyed by all. It is a soft, well-rounded offering that aught to have barbecue lovers, especially, trampling over one another to buy by the case full. This self-proclaimed Schwarzbier/Rauchbier hybrid may not be German-born, but it's Bundesliga caliber talent for sure."
"The Rest:  A solid lager with a nice twist of some smokiness, while still being quite balanced."

"Overall: A good beer, but one that I think BA mislabels. In the Rauchbier category, this beer fails on many accounts, but as a Schwarzbier, this one is pretty tasty. I'd buy this again, but it isn't my favorite from Jack's Abby."

"Pours into a becker a roasted chestnut brown with a half finger light beige head atop.Smoke,caramel,brown sugar,and German malts in the nose with that light tinge of iron.Smoke up front on the palate but not in your face a little earth and some brown sugar-like sweetness to round it out.A pretty solid rauchbier good smoke without being overbearing."
""
"Flavor matches the nose, dark malt, hint of smoke, some cocoa, mild bitterness, no hop flavor, note of coffee and cola.  Creamy mouthfeel.  Really good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This brew fits my tongue very well, very pleased. Would buy this again."
""
"The best non-Schlenkerla rauch I've had. I'm a big fan!"
""
""
""
"O: the smoke is nicely done, not overwhelming; I would have like a little more hop flavor, but it's still really nice;"
""
"O - The carbonated version of this beer is pretty good, but nitro makes this brew great.  I find that carbon dioxide can make smokiness taste slightly acrid,  much like getting campfire smoke in your eyes.  But the nitrogen lets the roasty and toasty notes give the beer extra depth and warmth."

"Review based on the BJCP2008 guidelines (style 22B). AROMA: background sweet and roasted malts from the base beer with coffe and chocolate notes. faint smoke notes with balance towards the base beer. some DMS is present. APPEARANCE: dark with a ruby color tint. average tanned head with good retention. TASTE: roasted coffe-like notes with a touch of pleasant and balanced smokiness. some sweet chocolate notes also present. low bitterness with a dry finish. PALATE: medium-low with medium-low carbonation. OVERALL: a good marriage between a dark lager and smoked malts, that would benefit with a bit more smokiness."

"O: [4.00] I like the smokey flavor and the sweetness of the malts.  The mouthfeel is smooth and enjoyable.  I haven't had a beer from Jack's Abby that wasn't above average.  This is not an exception.  It is not my favorite beer from Jack's Abby - but it is still worth repeating."

"Outstanding.  Closest thing to an authentic German smoked lager yet."

"This is a very tasty Rauchbier (Black Lager according to JA), eminently drinkable and approachable. A great choice for a slightly darker beer on a hot day."

"O: This is a great treat beer. I would absolutely buy this any day."
""
""
""
"A little involved of a beer for a hot day, and a little thin to be a great winter beer. Hell of an autumn beer though."
""
""
""
""
""
"I would equate this almost to a brown ale/light porter. Just beautiful stuff. A love how much complexity they could squeeze into this beer."

""

""
""
"O: This beer to me is ¾ schwarzbier and ¼ rauchbier. This combination works so well here in Smoke & Dagger. Drinkable and with tons of flavor, this could be a great session beer. The unique profile of this beer makes it ripe for some great food parings. If you see this give it a try."

"O - Great beer. Highly recommended."

""

""
""
""
""
"Left me wanting more, Great finish."
""
"Pours murky cola brown with a thin tan head. Nose is chocolate malt, subtle dry smoke, and a real light cherry sweetness. The taste is really drinkable, with light smokiness, a bit of dark cherry, more chocolatey malt, and a dry, roasty bitter finish. Smooth and soft in the mouth, with just enough carbonation. Really easy drinking, smooth and quenching. Excellent."
"Dark brown with ruby edges and a short, dense cap of dark tan foam. Lots of lacing. Looks nice! Smoky aroma that mellowed after some time in the glass, rich malts, biscuity and slightly nutty, faint hop notes. Moderate bitterness with sweet maltiness, more biscuit, nutty finish with mild smoke. Really clean yeast profile. Medium bodied with creamy carbonation, off-dry. I quite enjoyed this beer. The smoke character is generally mild, which works for me."

"Pitch black with just a hint of ruby on the edges. Aromas of roasted coffee and dark cocoa nibs. Very nice balance of hoppy character and malty sweetness. It's bitter coffee up front and a clean, crisp finish that leaves a resiny hops bite on the back palate. The description of it being a cross between a rauch and a schwartzbier is apt. The smokiness is there, especially on the nose, but it's not all in your face. The flavor and body are much more schwarzbier."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very well crafter beer with an excellent balance of flavors; the smoke flavor builds as you enjoy the beer but the other elements come through as well. The brew combined the best elements of Smoked Porter and Schwarzerbier."
""
""
""
""
""
"fun beer from jacks abby, sort of a cross between a schwarz and a rauchbier, being a darker smoked lager type. medium brown color to this with great carbonation, a one inch off white head, and picture perfect ring lacing as it drinks. the nose is not as smoked as I anticipated, more spiced than smoked really, with some chocolate malt and a range of other well toasted grains. lager yeast abounds. the flavor is still only lightly smoked, subtle, especially in a rauchbier context. darker malt gives some earthy character without a ton of sweetness, and there is an astonishing lack of body for the color, a really nice feature lending to drinkability. well carbonated and the finish is light smoke and wintery spice, a nice combination. not much hops though, but they aren't really missed. I like that complexity of this, especially for a lager. jacks abby has really redefined what it means to be a lager, and beers like this are a perfect example of their crusade against convention."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"this beer is done right in pretty much every way.  the smoke is very subtle but detectable,  the body is  a perfect balance  of dry, sweet, and thick.  it's not too bitter or over hopped.  to me,  this is like a single strength plead the fifth with a hint of smoke.  it's become a regular buy for me  and deserves more than the 88 score that it had at the time  of my review"
""
"O - Excellent beer, this is an incredibly smooth full flavored and balanced beer. It has the smoothness of a black lager with the touches of a porter."
""
"Overall this is a tasty brew with smoke quality that pairs nicely with the roasted malts."
""
""
"The palate opens with a blend dark chocolate, smoke and a little coffee. Dark caramel sweetness is present, along with a robust bitterness. The label mentions that this skirts the line between porter and schwarzbier and I see why - the blend of chocolate, smoke, grainy acidty and German hop character brings to mind just that. Medium-light in body and with a medium-high level of carbonation, this feels quite good on the palate. The carbonation does thin out the mouthfeel a little bit, though. Smoke and dark chocolate linger on the finish. Very nice."
"Overall - Tasty, but after the Fire in the Ham, not quite as good."
""
""
"One finger of resilient tan head on a dark brown brew. Smells of caramel, plum and a bit of spent grain. Tastes of more caramel and black licorice and has a slight smokiness. Light to medium and edgy going down. Becomes more woody and smoky as it goes. Fine, fine drinking on a snowy Vermont eve."
""
""
"O - I picked this up because it is from Jack's Abby, not because it is a Rauchbier, which is a new style to me. This is the sort of beer that makes me want to further explore a style. Recommend, also goes great with food!"
""

"Well made. Tasty. Deft touch with the smoke. Worthy of a try."
""
"Had on tap at Champions. Seems Jacks Abbey is everywhere these days. This was billed as a smokey dark beer, which I am always hit or miss with. This poured a very dark color with little head. Very malty and caramels smell, and the taste doesn't disappoint. Nice crisp taste and the hints of smoke are not overwhelming which I like. I could have a couple of these. Like this a lot"
""
""
""
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is pleasantly smokey but with plenty of other character to take in as well. Very easy drinking and crisp. Thanks again for this one Heath."
"This is a fantastic beer that is lighter than you might expect and yet still has all the beechwood smoke flavor you want. It is a roasted malt paradise for the eyes and for the palate. The full bodied taste is not heavy and the mouthfeel is silky and smooth. There is a touch of hop floral on it that livens the dark flavors but doesn't compete with them. It has the faintest touch of fruit. Another great beer from Jack's Abby."

"overall - I don't get any of the chocolate malt indicated on the label, but still a good dark lager."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Best smoked lager I have had so far (I typically don't like them). This beats out their Lawson's collab for sure, that one had a little cloying to it. I could drink several of these brews."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I love how easy this is to drink. I find most smoked beers difficult to drink in excess, cumbersome to the pallet, if you will. I'll be heading to the fridge for another immediately following this review, if that tells you anything."
""
"Another good offering from the boys in Framingham."
""

"Great beer. Unique style. Perfect for early fall. Kind of like a porter but different."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

"The beer is murkier than most black lagers I've had from these parts. Its a dense Boston fog of a beer, again perhaps not something entirely pleasurable but it socks you in and asks you to study, to read and to think. The taste lingers like the winters and tastes damp in your mouth for a while like the spring. Overall I'm a fan. I think this is a great place-based beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Note: Manufactured on April 15, 2013"
"It definitely feels like a bigger beer than I am used to for schwarzbier lagers but that's not a bad thing. This is their take. It's also smoky which is not quite appropriate for the style either. However it's a easy to drink beer, interesting flavor, and very satisfying."
""
""
""
""
"o - overall a decent smoke beer, but fairly watered down."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a great beer with a lot of character and very pleasant qualities. I really enjoy the smokiness. Despite being heavy, I feel that this beer can be enjoyed any time of the year. I highly recommend it."

"Like the aroma, the taste has a good smoked malty character that is lightly sweetened and finishes clean. Yes, I would have it again."
"O - i'm a sucker for these beers. big on flavor, not as filling. could session this. yum."
""
""
"O-interesting blend of styles, a little porter, a little dark lager, did not get a lot of smokiness in this"

"A really solid beer, simple flavors but executed nicely. Really dug it."
""
""

"A dark, murky brown colored brew with a modest but stubborn light tan colored cover and decent lacing, this brew served chilled in a pint glass is looking pretty inviting. The aroma brings a deep toasted brown bread and chocolate malt medley with a bit of a juniper bite over the top. Very appealing. The flavor comes on with a fairly sharp grassy hop tang which is immediately followed by a charcoal malt idea. This is definitely a bit brighter and more bitter than I anticipated with subtle smokey qualities. It's a tad thin in feel but offers a brisk carbonation in what otherwise is a medium-light bodied beer. There's a vague chalkiness but nothing negative. This generally strikes me as a grassy, vegetable sort of brew with a good smokey-malt theme that makes for a decent overall result. A bit too grassy for my tastes, but not bad at all."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall an excellent brew, sort of a beer Frankenstein, blending elements from a few styles (rauchbier, schwarzbier, and smoked porter); the finished product is a smooth, flavorful beer. proves you don't need an imperial to deliver and onslaught of character. while i wouldn't count any of the aforementioned styles among my personal favorites, smoke and dagger does work for me, and though it won't earn a spot in my regular rotation i will definitely be back for more in the future."
""
""
"O - Smoke and lots of lager yeast."
""
""
"O - It's impressive that Jack's Abby only makes lagers and find ways of making lagers taste absolutely nothing like a lager. Smoke & Dagger is no different and tastes like a different style of beer. It's a pretty solid and a favorite of mine by them when the weather puts me in the mood for a black lager. Will definitely purchase this again."
""

"High C+"
""
""
"Deep brown head, decent ring of whiteish head, good amount of lace here too. Smell is of roasted malts, chocolate and smoke, a little bit of liquorice, a mild but noteable hop presence as well here, bit of a dark bread note as well. Taste is of dark malts and chocolate, well roasted malts, lightly bitter, a bit of anise as well, roast-chocolate finish and aftertaste. Lightly carbonated with a medium-full body, a bit of an oily feel as well. Awesome stuff here, great flavours and really drinkable, worthy of revisits for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I enjoyed this beer - the smoke flavors are quite pleasant and really add to the beer without being overwhelming or having too much of an iodine flavor. The beer was easy to drink and I had no problem putting down a 22 oz bottle on my own - in fact, I wish there was a little more of it to drink. Would pair very nicely with meats."
""
"Overall: I liked this more than I expected and would definitely have it again. A nice dark lager that would be perfect with barbecue."
""
"Dark brown, tan head. Light roast and chocolate on the nose, along with some lightly bready and doughy notes. Taste is chocolatey, roasty, lightly sweet, smoke is peripheral. Lager yeast qualities come through. Medium light body, perfectly medium light carbonation. More of a schwarzbier, and perhaps the best I've ever had."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a curious melding of several styles; schwarzbier, porter and rauchbier. I think they all worked together very well, but this is kind of one-time beer that I wouldn't probably seek out again."
"I split a bottle of this with Goblinmunkey7 roughly a year ago, and this bottle is even better than I remember. There are some nice smoke and chocolate notes here, in an impressive amount of balance. Another winner from Jack's Abby."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"With a touch of confusion, I can see why the beer doesn't settle on a set style when a blend of well-tested recipes will obviously work better. Jack's Abby proves that there's a ton of imagination that if not bound by the ""rules"" of beer making."
""
""
"Light body with some decent soft carbonation. Easier to drink rauchbier, with the smoke being subtle but flavorful and not in your face."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"16.9oz bottle. Pours a dark cola color with very little head. Some lacing. The aroma is rich with some smoke, roasted malts, and earth. The taste is a nice mix of smoke, roasted malts with some earth and hints of chocolate . Has somewhat of a cola taste at the end. Nice roasty/smokey flavor. Heavy mouthfeel. This beer certainly does taste like a mix of a Schwarzbier and a Smoked Porter. Nicely done. Overall, a great autumn beer but it drinks just fine year round."
""
""
"O: A nice, easy-going smoked schwarzbier with a restrained smokiness that goes well with the roasted malts and dark fruits. At under 6%, this is an easy-to-drink dark beer"
""
"Cheers!"

""

"I love everything about this beer. I love that Jack's Abby makes such wonderfully unique lagers, and that it's a neighborhood brewery for those of us in the Boston area. The 1/2 liter bottle and label are beautiful, and the color and aroma are great. What's exceptional for me was the mouthfeel, so very smooth and silky, and the taste is great. Drinking this beer was a treat!"

"Pours with a four-finger, khaki head that fades slowly leaving some lace. Black color, hints of mahogany highlights. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Nose is light smoke and chocolate and flavor is smooth baked chocolate with hints of smoke. $3.50 for a 500ml bottle, from Giles Fine Wine Arlington, MA."
""
"I just found out that there's a peanut butter of this beer which I now must have."

"Overall: I really enjoyed this beer. I was super easy to drink and quite interesting. I would definitely have more in the future."
""
""
"O – This is a great smoked beer. It smells nice and tastes great with much more complexity than expected from the nose. This is really tasty and very drinkable, especially for a smoky beer like this."
""
""
""
"Poured a deep brown with two fingers of rich creamy tan head that thinned quickly, but plenty of foam clung to the glass. Aroma was a whiff of smoke, maybe a little malt underneath. Not much there, really. But the flavor really popped in a nice little surprise package. Definite smokiness, definite roasted malts, some chocolate tones in the dark sweet area, nothing dominates and very well balanced. A little bitter on the finish, but carbonated well enough to brighten things up and make it lively. Crisp and clean. A very balanced, enjoyable brew."
""
"This is one of the best American-made lagers I've had. I love the dryness combined with the malt complexities, all in a highly drinkable package. The other Jack's Abby brews I've had have been somewhat underwhelming, but Smoke & Dagger is excellent. (4.5)"
"Received in trade with cbeer88- thanks man! Appearance is a deep auburn with crimson highlight, layer of tan head with plenty of sticky lacing. The nose is like a campfire, heavily smoked with layers of hickory, ash, and roasted malts. The taste meets the palate with some caramel malt character which brings a little sweetness before the smoke cuts through. Roasted malts and smoke take turns as it finishes with heavy woody smoke character. This is a very flavorful and smokey rauchbier, lots of depth in the flavor. The mouthfeel is somewhat thin with moderate to high carbonation. Overall, a winner, especially if smoked beers are your thing."
""
""

"O: Havent had many black lagers or rauchbiers, but I like this one. Theres a smoky aspect but its not overpowering. A solid session brew that I think would be easy to like."

"This beer is named after Jack’s Abby’s two brewery cats, Smoke and Dagger. It pours a very dark brown color, bordering on black, but sits in the glass as just plain clean black with a light white fluffy head that has the barest hints of tan in it. On the nose, the beer smells nicely smoked with rich beechwood notes and slight chocolate and black coffee. The beer smells very much of woodsy smoke, but the smell still carries the clean lager aromatics that are expect from the style. I was hoping for a little more pungency, but now that the beer is before me I think too much smell would off-put its lager qualities and ruin the beer. On the taste, the beer is richly layered with woodsy smoke. In the initial gulp there is big Beachwood notes that are slowly enveloped with rich smoke and then roasted chocolate malts, and then rich dark coffee, all the while shinning with the rich complexities of the beechwood. In the middle of the taste the chocolate malts do provide a slight burp of sweet that borders on strange, but is quickly enveloped by the other complexities of the beer, and dutifully managed. Citrus is also present in the taste as a faint ghost that haunts the latter half of the swallow. The aftertaste of this beer is light with Beechwood smoke and hints of coffee, but nothing more. This beer is meaty with flavor, and deliciously easy to sip. On the mouth, the beer feels thin, crisp, and refreshing, as all lagers should. Carbonation is effervescent but not prickly, working to nicely cleanse the palate and ready it for another sip. After each sip the mouth is left only slightly dry with woodsy smoke and with the faintest hints of sticky saliva griming the tongue and roof of the mouth with the sweet smoke taste. Overall this beer is another success from Jack’s Abby, I think I like it more than the version brewed with coffee, as this beer stands perfectly on its own, and I feel that the coffee cuts through some of the complex flavors of this beer. This beer is very drinkable and completely worthy of a try, with great locally sourced ingredients and an even better taste. It even pairs well with Gorgonzola cheese! Try this beer!"
""
"O: Solid brew, finds the right balance of smoke, roast, and sweetness. Drinks more like a smokey porter to me but nonetheless, another solid offering from JA."
"Overall, this is very nice fare, boasting a well-rounded, nicely balanced, and flavorful body that is everything a schwarzbier should be, with a tantalizing touch of smoky peat added that pushes the flavors to wonderful heights. It’s not necessarily a beer that brings anything new to the style, but instead prefers to set itself aside by being simply a finely-crafted example, and a model of understated perfection in craft."

"Taste begins with a shot of smoke, goes quite sweet in the middle, coupled with a shot of citrus, and then closes with a light bitterness. Mouthfeel is smooth, and drinkability is great. Seemed maybe too sweet, but it came together nicely for me in the end."
"pour is dark black with a tan head and some larger bubbles. Nose is light malt and chocolate notes with a light grain and herbal hop. Taste is a good, full flavored dark chocolate and light roast to it. Stout like favors with a lighter body and grainy hoppy finish. Dry clean finish and well carbonated."
""
"Overall, way above my expectations for another smoked beer. I usually hate smoked beer, but this was enjoyable with its many stout-like qualities."
""
"O: Another solid beer from JA. Though it would be smokier, but it wasn't over the top and blended nicely with the rest of the flavors."
""
""
""
"A balanced beer with very light smoke and a bit thin for my tastes. I would just like more of all aspects of this beer."
"Poured on nitro-tap and served in a tumbler pint, the beer is a dark, rich, ruby-hazelnut coloring that comes with a decent cascade. After the fireworks settle, you end up with a thick, dense, creamy tan head. Looks great, and always fun to watch. Aromas of coffee and chocolate, both roasted bitter and creamy, with a toffee highlight. This smells like a sweettooth satisfier. Flavors are roasted and slightly smokey initially, with a nutty and coffee backbone. The smoke continues throughout as there is an unveiling of charcoal and campfire qualities that take over the palate. Toffee sweet intertwines through the palate as a highlight and backbone at the same time. The body is light and crisp, almost to the point of being watered down. Great, coating cling along the glass as you drink. The aftertaste is smokey, with a dose of the rich, sweet background flavors. Smooth, creamy and clean finish, this is a tasty brew. Very drinkable and very tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o - Overall a pretty good beer; kind of reminds me of Guinness Light with a hint of smoke. Tons of roasted malts and chocolate along with light smoke, and easy to drink. Would like to have again, and would jump to have it again on nitro-tap."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a very dark brown with a fluffy off-white head. Smell is a nice mix of roasted malt, chocolate and smoke that all blend together quite nicely and none of the aromas are too overpowering. The smoke is more prominent in the flavor than in the nose, but still doesn't overpower as the roastiness and chocolate hold up against the smoke nicely. Interestingly, the more I drink the less smoke I taste and the more the roasted malts come through, not sure if that's a product of the warming or just getting accustomed to the smoke flavor. Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this comes off as a nice, smokey schwarzbier. I'm impressed that the schwarzbier characteristics shine through as well as they do and balance out the smoke nicely. I like this one more than the Cascadian Schwarzbier as I feel like the smoke suits the beer better than the hops do."
"Overall, this is a nice beer that I would happily drink again."

"The label describes this as somewhere between a schwarzbier and a smoked porter, which is a lengthier but more accurate description than a rauchbier; the smoke is quite tame here. That being said - pretty great beer and very easy drinking, lots of porter-like flavors while maintaining that lager feel. Another winner from Jack's Abby."
"Smoke & Dagger pours jet black, with a surprising three and a half fingers of khaki colored foam. Head retention is very good, and lacing, while night quite sheet-like, is very good. The nose has a nice balance between roasty grains and smoke, though I'd say the roast leans more towards coffee than chocolate. The flavor profile is more of the same. The front end is a nice, smooth black coffee, with some subtle chocolate undertones. Smoky, BBQ type flavors then begin to creep in and build in intensity, eventually taking over the beer completely by the finish. The body is sturdy, while maintaining a dry enough finish to avoid becoming overly full or rich. The carbonation has a little bit of pep to it, but stays on the lower end of the spectrum. Smoke and Daggers was my first Jack's Abby brew, and I definitely dug the smoky schwarzbier vibe."
"The pour is a dark amber color with an off-white head. Strong smoke aroma to this, but still plenty of malt sweetness. Good caramel, toffee, and toasted bread aromas. A light woodiness to it. The flavor is sweet and malty with a nice smokiness. Light wood and salt notes, plenty of toast and caramel malts. A light chocolate flavor to it as well."

"Overall: Nice and chocolaty rauch. Ranks right up there with the best I have had being produced in the states. The chocolate element distinguishes this beer from others in the category. Probably my second favorite from the brewery only behind Leisure Time lager."
"Pours a solid dark brown with a huge creamy off white head that persists forever. Smells of bread and chocolate mostly with a hint of smoke and coffee. The flavor has little bit more roast and coffee than I expected. Huge notes of chocolate and caramel in each sip with a light smoky essence in the background. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet slick mouthfeel. Very flavorful, smooth easy drinking dark lager. Its nice that they didn't go overboard with the smoked malt like everyone seems to be doing these days."

"Not smooth or refreshing. I figured it'd be great for a hot summer day, but it didn't quite hit the spot. Good, but not memorable."

"O: Not as complex as I was expecting, but still good and highly drinkable. Really love the mouthfeel. Definitely something to experience, I can't think of any other American breweries doing a beer like this. Easily worth a buy, especially at the very fair price of $2.99 a bottle (the four pack is even more economical)."
"500ml bottle served in a Reissdorf stange. Pours the color and clarity of cola with a loose, 2.5 inch, khaki-colored head that sizzles and pops as it slowly fizzes down to an 1/8th inch cap. Thick, textured swaths of lacing are revealed during the tasting. Nose expresses hints of chocolate and roast with the merest suggestion of smoke towards the back end. Taste follows nose; however, it all comes off a bit watery and closer to a Schwartzbier than a Rauchbier in my opinion. Mouthfeel is light in body and starts off with an almost silky feel at the tip of the tongue, but quickly yields to a more watery consistency. Carbonation is assertive without being prickly or gassy. Overall, this beer is lacking in the smokiness I've come to associate with the style, and I'm actually okay with that - I didn't realize this was a Rauchbier when I purchased it. That said, a decent brew, but definitely closer to a Schwartzbier than a Rauchbier and there are better examples of Schwartzbiers out there if that is what you are looking for."

"Another excellent offering from Jack's Abbey. A fine introduction to the more potent Rauchbiers out there."
"O- This was a good smoked beer from Jack's Abby. I didn't like it nearly as much as Hoponius Union. It is one of the better rauchbiers I've had but definitely not the best. The beer is very easy to drink has a nice aroma, a well-balanced taste, and a pleasant feel. The only thing it could have used a tiny bit more of is a little bit more flavor. Other then that this beer was definitely a good quality rauchbier. At $11.50 for a 4-pack of 500ml bottles (or $3.25 for a single) you can't go wrong. I definitely recommend giving it a try."
"O: All that adds up to one really good beer. Jack's Abby does it again!"

"Smoke and Dagger is fantastic, and at $2.50 a pint at the local packie? I'll have another!!"
"Notes: This big boy is all malt and very drinkable and very tasty. Cheers."

"4.0 D: Solid beer with a great nose and taste. Super drinkable and well rounded."

"O: An easy to drink rauchbier. I would have this again. Thanks Michael."
""
"Tastes like a porter with some semisweet chocolate. Again, the smoke is modest but present. Dry and lasting aftertaste of bitter dark malts and spicy hops. Relatively thin bodied with a high level of carbonation."
""
"A really well crafted, tame Rauchbier. This offering has certainly opened my eyes to Jack's Abby."
""
"Not nearly as smoky as most Rauchbiers I have experienced but still has a good roast malt flavor. I will definitely pick this one up again in the future."
"Tap: Poured a dark black color ale with a dark brown foamy head with good retention and some light lacing. Aroma of light roasted malt with light smoke notes and some dry black chocolate. Taste is an interesting mix between black chocolate and smoke with light lactose notes. Body is slightly fuller then average with medium carbonation which suits the style. Well brewed and somewhat unique. I would love to have a more regular access to this beer."
"Drink- Overall it was pretty good, wasnt the best nor the worst. Great layered flavors but doesnt punch you in the face."
"Toasty dark roasted malt, but not overdone. The slight sweet note is pushed aside as this brew finishes crisp. Coffee, a little smokiness, mild bitterness, smooth malt. Highly drinkable and medium bodied, but maybe on the light side of that. Enjoyable and refreshing. Worthy."
"O: B"
"O/D-Second Jack's Abby brew I have had. This one was also a damn steal at $2.30-ish for a half liter. This beer has actually turned me on to a style I don't like very much. After only having 2 of Jack's Abby's beers, I can already say they are one of the best breweries in the state and even all of New England."
"Smokiness is quite mild and palatable. If you've never tried a rauchbier, not a bad first one to try."
"Mouthfeel is solid- medium light body (can't say light cause it's a dark beer) with a light and smooth lager carbonation. The more you drink, the more the smoke comes through. This would be excellent with anything grilled."

"Poured a 1.5"" cappucino head with long life. The body pours dark but clear but in masstone it's a deep umber brown verging on coffee. The smell is very mild and mainly roasted malt. Taste is much weaker than I was expecting but has the crispness of a lager, a touch of smoke, and a little roasted malt. And easy drinking enjoyable and not boring lager."
"Mouthfeel is light and velvety smooth. Overall, a very tasty beverage sure to please any smoked beer fan."
"O: Pretty simple rauchbier. I'm honestly not a fan of smoked beers at all but this one isn't overpowering. The smoke doesn't just taste like liquid smoke either, tastes like hickory BBQ. The chocolate and coffee compliments it well too."
""
"Cheers!"
"Very drinkable, this is not a smokey beer at all. While the smoke exists, it really is merely to complement the other flavors, not overpower them. If you want a smokey rauchbier, you'll be disappointed. I, however, really appreciated the subtly, balance, and immense drinkability."
"O: very good for a rauch Bier but i think i would group this more in the smoked Porter category.... But a great use of smoke just the same... Not overwhelimg but in their just right for balance."
""
""
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this beer was an excellent complement to pastrami sandwich and overall is a very good smoked beer."
"O - This was a really nice Rauchbier that was super-easy to drink for a style I find hard to have much of. I would say this is more of a lager with some smoke qualities added in there. Good stuff, would drink again."
"D - A very good and authentic Rauchbier. This isn't the most sexy style of beer, and I was a bit apprehensive about having 2L of Rauchbier. I needn't have worried about it, as I returned to this for numerous refills during the course of the Super Bowl."

"I highly recommend this beer for rauchbier lovers, its delicious."

"Another fabulous beer from Jack's Abby. Almost runs the fine line between black lager and mildy smoked porter. The meaty smoke flavor in this beer is absolutely stunning. Good stuff."

"D-Just an awesome beer. So clean and yet so flavorful. I would not only drink this again but I would seek it out."
"The boys at Jack's Abby have another winner with Smoke & Dagger. While the mild smokiness had me comparing this beer more to a schwarzbier than a rauchbier, this is a damn fine brew nonetheless."

"Overall nice, smoke is done well without the heavy smoke flavor, not too bitter or tannic either, and nice soft malt and lager flavors, nice oats and even a hint of chocolate coming late. Much different than anything I've had before I think, and done fairly well. They easily could have gone overboard on anything, but didn't. Perhaps a touch more of the lager flavors and crispness would have been nicer."
"O: went very well with the bbq I had at Redbones. Definitely would drink this brew again."
"I was graciously given a growler from a friend who made a visit to the brewery last weekend. He knew my affinity for dark beers. Poured into a tall beer glass. Super dark black body. Great looking white head forms with a vigorous pour, but that soon fades. The body looks a bit undercarbonated once the beer has sat for a bit. The smell is a wonderful aroma of campfire smoke. The taste is great too. Love the earthy, peaty aroma. But I get less smoke flavor as I drink, and more of a burnt-end brisket taste. While BBQ is not a bad thing, it's more charcoal flavor than smoke. Mouthfeel was a bit thin, but that's what I expected from a smoked lager. Overall it's a decent beer, and I liked it better than the Red Lager or the IPL. This one just seemed more unique. A nice intro the brewery and I wish them well."
"O - Overall this was a pretty nice lightly smoked beer. Good appearance and malt characteristics make this a definate have again brew."
"This was a great beer. I usually don't go for Lagers but these guys are definately doing things right."
