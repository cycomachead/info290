3.26,-0.6,4,3,3.5,3,3,"a decent pour for the style as it settles in and gives off a nice two finger head tha slips down the sides of the glass effortlessly.aroma was smoked to high heaven, but rather one sided, some touches of a cough syrup like smell coming off it as it warmed, not sure what that was, but hints of grain buried underneath as well. The flavor was surprisingly good though. Rich notes here of peat and malted grains, nice roasted touches and a very nice and well balanced grain bill. Definitely a very nice flavor and it took me off guard, the feel was a bit thin and one sided, but still not terrible.","mikesgroove","May 16, 2009"

The head vanishes in less than a minute. Smells and tastes of very mild smoke, maybe I use the Schlenkerla rauch's as a standard, but this is barely kissed with smoke.

The nose is mostly munich malt, biscuity in a way, with some toffee sweetness and a bit of hickory. The taste is more like a dark lager than a rauchbier. Has some maltyness to it, and a bit of well, malt. Nothing else here. No smoke, no rauch, no fun. Has a medium body and slightly carbonated mouthfeel. Fairly drinkable, but a terrible example of the style.","dherling","Feb 05, 2007"
4.1,25,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Clear, Medium amber/orange with a small, creamy, off-white, slowly-diminishing head. Smell is of lightly smoky malts supported by some light citrus from the hops, some very light earthy yeast, and caramel. Taste is more of the same except with more piney hops than the citrus in the nose. It has a medium body, dry texture and soft carbonation. This is very good for a rauchbier, because it lets the smoke aroma and flavor stand out without being overpowering or fake-tasting like so many other rauchbiers Ive tasted. Very easy drinking and enjoyable.","ski271","Beers"
3.92,19.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"A delicate smokiness enhances, and also acts as a counterpoint to, the gently caramelish maltiness of Saranac's Rauchbier. It pours a clear, glowing amber-copper body beneath a short head of creamy ivory. Beechwood smoke is found in the nose, but it doesn't leap out at you; and when some of the sweetish malt from below peeks through it takes on the mouthwatering scent of bacon! It's crisp in the mouth with a delicate, medium-light body and fine-bubbled, median carbonation. The carbonation helps to bring out the smokiness, and cut through the maltiness. The flavor is initially fairly light on smoke, but as you progress through the glass it builds on the palate, increasing its presence. It's lager-like, clean and just a touch sulphury underneath. The malt is lightly caramelish, a touch sweet, honeyish, and backed by some grassy and spicy hops. The smokiness runs the gamut from smoked meats, and ham specifically, to Scotch wiskey. It's drying, and in combination with the jagged bitterness, leaves the palate mostly scrubbed of malt. Smoke lingers, and it's kind of cigar-like, but not nearly as full or harsh. Well done! Nicely rounded with a good balance and an appropriate level of smokiness. Worth trying!","NeroFiddled","0"
3.05,-7,2.5,2.5,3,3,4,"12oz bown bottle with no freshness date. Pours a crystal clear medium light amber with a poor head and lace. Rather weak smelling. Caramel malts are present mixed with a slight hop floralness and an even slighter smokiness. Upon tasting, caramel notes are up front mixed with a decent hop flavor but very little smokiness. As a rauchbier it is poor but as a traditional lager its not bad. I'll give it average on taste because its a decent lager but poor as a smoked lager. Its is a very drinkable beer though. It tastes like they took their typical lager and added just a tiny bit of smoke.","sabrills70","Jan 14, 2007"

3.09,-5.8,3.5,2,3,3,4.5,"Pours an extra clear golden copper hue. A dense vanilla-colored head of three fingers shows good retention and produces some spotty lacing. Pale lager malt and light German floral hop nose, no noticable smoke aroma. Biscuity malt flavor upfront, followed by rich Munich and toasty Victory malt. Clean but malty marzen yeast character. Dry aftertaste with faint noble hop bitterness but not much flavor and the slightest hint of peat/wood notes. The light medium-body and mild carbonation add a crispness that accentuates the vauguely earthy mouthfeel. Finishes clean and dry with weak traces of charred wood and a humble malt residue. As far as German amber lagers go, this is highly drinkable and unique; but it's really lacking the true smoke taste and aroma of a traditional rauchbier.","PBRstreetgang","Dec 30, 2006"

It has a dry, malty scent that boasts of Munich and a bit of peated malt. The smoke scent is faint. The taste is decent also. It has a very average taste with a bit of Munich and very little peated malt. It's light and easy drinking, but lacking in character. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with good carbonation. This is an average brew. It's run of the mill. I wonder why these guys even bother with making such poor examples of the styles.

The aroma is of malt mostly, maybe some smokiness but I am having a hard time picking it up. The malts seem to remind me of caramel. The taste is interesting, definite malt flavors come through at the start with a slight smoke flavor that comes bout in the middle and sticks around for a bit. Over all it is a pretty good brew, not sure how it would stack up with others within the same type category but I would suppose that it is a nice intro to this style. I feel that Saranac his hit the mark based on what I have seen them produce in these limited batches, nice addition to the 12 beers of winter while introducing people to different beers.","Stimack","Dec 23, 2006"

This was an excellent tasting lager and much better than Saranac's Adirondack Lager. The smokiness was barely noticable but perhaps that's what makes this an all around good beer. Would serve this beer at bar-b-ques and with other smoked foods. I'm eager to try some true German made rauchbiers with the stronger smoke flavors after this one. Sarancac should add this to their regular lineup.","rohrbachsfan","Dec 14, 2006"
3.36,2.4,4,3,3,4,4,"Saranac rauchbier is a clear amber beer with a shallow white head. The aroma is full of soft, melanoidin-laden malt. Theres a very modest hint of smokiness behind the malts. Its a mild and simple smoke sensation, one that seems like more of an afterthought than a centerpiece. The taste is similar, with lightly-roasted (and a bit smoky) malt flavors. The finish is moderately dry, with a slight bitterness. Soft and round mouthfeel, with lower than average carbonation. This is a pretty good beer, but Id like a Rauchbier to have a lot more smoke character. This one is far too restrained.","Suds","Dec 13, 2006"

A very light fruity aroma. A nice robust taste as it hits the 'buds. Not as carbonated as it looked from initial viewing, definately could be a little more carbonated, imo. Mouthfeel was good, pretty drinkable. Doesn't leave a very pleasant after taste. Pretty well drinkable, taste did start to fade as beer warmed up (might just be me), something I have never experienced before.

Aroma has malts that come with upfront caramel and a touch of smoked malts just barely evident. Flavor is clean with mild smokey flavor and leafy tobacco hop tones that blend well together overall a mild mainstream rauchbier better than nothing but by no means comparable to a true rauch from Bamberg. Mouthfeel is medium bodied evenly carbonated not much else going on in the complexity region. Drinkability is decent but by no means is this a rauchbier and flavors don't blend that well overall I'm not impressed by this effort.","WVbeergeek","Dec 02, 2006"

Not that I'm a rauchbier convert, but this time the "smoke" flavor was more like the traditional "roasting" I was used to.
