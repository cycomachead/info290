It pours a mostly clear sunset rust topped by over a finger of thick dirty cream froth. The nose comprises light toffee being dominated by a strong (though still nowhere near o'erbearing) beech smoke, coming off almost like a mutedly honey-smoked ham. This one, though, is earthier than most German rauchbiers I've had, with a twinge of wet soil and dark greens seeping into the background. It's meek and doesn't hurt the overall smokiness much, but it is noticeable. The taste brings in more of the same, with this earthiness toned-down to a nice mild grassy quality. The smoke isn't exactly strong, but it's in no way subtle. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a somewhat slick feel. Overall, a damn fine rauchbier. It's not as good as the Schlenkerlas, but it definitely comes very close.","TMoney2591","Nov 17, 2011"

It seemed like the perfect day for a deep, smoky rich beer, instead of a porter, as I had some great lamb meatloaf awaiting me. Instead, a bright coppery pour to dark honey lager looking 0.5l stein came my way with a fluffy white 1 finger head on board. The white lace stuck about in small pockets and minimized on top as I drank. I thought that the aroma would be smoky as well, but only in a subtle "if you were looking for it, you'd notice it" kind of way. Likewise with the flavor; only a subtle smokiness that rounded off the malt flavors in this exceptional near dunkel lager. Fresh, crisp and a bit bubbly to the mouth, this is one you could drink & drink & drink...and watch your smile grow. A damn fine surprise!","selecter70","Apr 06, 2010"

The aroma is milder and more refined than other rauchbier that I've tried, mostly Schlenkerla. Spezial's Lager tends more toward rich caramel and fruity malt. The smoke doesn't make the beer feel old or hammy. It's more like a fresh, mesquite-ish accent to a nice malty lager.

Nice peaty and smoky flavor, but not as intense as a typical rauchbier. Since this is a lager, I feel that the brewer wanted to tone that aspect down a bit so that it retained some of the drinkability of a lager. That is the quality that I liked the most: it had that smoky flavor, but was easy to drink in a big German beer mug. Light enough body, but had just enough malt behind it to make it a sturdy brew. A nice beer for smoked beer lovers, and a nice beer for lager drinkers - best of both worlds. Paired nicely with my pasta with sage and pumpkin cream sauce.","morebeergood","Feb 03, 2010"

The foam doesn't have a lot of staying power, reducing to a small solid cap quite quickly, but it does leave a decent amount of lacing. Smells sweetly malty initially, but a light woody smoke aroma hits soon after. Surprising fruitiness that's I haven't found in many lagers. The taste is equally nice: quite malt concentrated, but not overly sweet. The smoke flavor is quite mild and works well to dry out the malt. Interesting slightly tart finish. Thickish feel.

It has a reddish color with a head equal to that of Schlenkerla, but a much more subdued smell, which is indicative of the taste. It's very easy to drink and the typical Rauchbier taste is only noticed after taking a swig, not during. Spezial definitely doesn't have the same impact as Schlenkerla, but it certainly is a beer worth drinking if you want to drink a much easier Rauchbier.

The flavors were at first toasted malt and dry grain with a little hop bitterness in the middle quickly followed by the finish which is all peat smoke.

There was very little fizz, and it had a lot of thickness in the body that made it feel heavy when in the mouth, but had a very smooth overall texture.

Easily the lightest Rauchbier I've had, which is not a bad thing. This would pair nicely with some very mild cheese, some onion soup, a toasted deli beef sandwich, or some mild sausage. Nothing spectacular, but a nice, easy to drink beer that could be a great transitional Rauchbier for those looking to ease into the genre.

Was presented with an amber color with orange highlights. Had a good sized slightly off (hedging to tan) white head that had nice retention and left a good amount of lacing down the side of the glass. The aroma is very pleasant as the smokiness shows through along with what I perceive as a nice malt scent. The taste is really where the smokiness comes out, seems to have the flavors that would go along with smoked meats minus the meats, kind of like a smoker before food is added. I know that there are other beers out there that have a more smoke filled profile but I think that this one has the balance that is needed for this type of brew. Besides the smoke flavors I am able to pick up the malts that seem to give a sweet taste while having a nice dry finish. Overall this is a very easy drinking brew, this would easily be a great session brew in my book if you like this type.","Stimack","May 01, 2007"

Clarity is as good as it gets, and carbonation is not apparent in the glass. Nose brings a moderate smokeyness, with a moderate toastyness and bready sweetness behind it. The base and the smoke are both nicely sweet. Flavor initally hits with a nice sweet smokeyness. Not big and bold like other German rauchbiers, but enough to let me know what I'm drinking. This fades and lets a very nice and mild bready and toasty malt character shine through, finishing with a revisit of smokeyness after the maltyness fades. Mouthfeel is a light moderate with a solid moderate carbonation. This one is nice. It's not a smoke bomb that brings about the images of jerkey or chops, but I think it makes it more drinkable.

I guess it's just one of those aquired taste beers. Just like I love IPA to the max beers, others can't tolerate them. OK....Poured a brownish, reddish hazy color with virtually zero head whatever. It left next to no lace also. The smell was a bit pungent. I've always read the reviews of "barnyard" type scents and never understood. Now I have a bit of an understanding. UGH, didn't enjoy the taste at all. Mainly because of the smoky overtones. Next to zero carbonation and tasted like a pair of used sweatsocks that have been soaking in some aged iced tea. Sorry, but not my kind of beer. I'm sure it's a perfectly good one for the smoked beer fans out there though. So, pay no attention to my rating unless you dislike smoked beers like I do.","GClarkage","Aug 24, 2004"
3.55,-4.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Ok another Rauchbier from Bamburg.. Umm what happened? Did they lose he smoke? Pours a nice dark amber brown. With a host of floaty things.. Smell is malty but oddly not smoky. Taste is more like a Heavy dunkle lager.. with just a touch of smoke. This beer reminds me of Stones Smoked Porter.. It says it has smoke but Im trying to find it.. Some one give me a cigarette so i can have some smoke with my smoked bier. Its a tasty brew, but it aint that smokey.. I love the Aecht Schenkerla Rauchbiers.. but this one falls so short of them its not even funny.. Its like Schlenkela is Marlboro and this bier is Marlboro Ultra lite. Its tasty in a Malty almost Martzen way, but not gonna be smokey enough for Rauch lovers.","TinusTime","Aug 23, 2004"
3.92,5.9,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"This brew has a dark amber/copper body with a tan head that ran away from me. Slight smokey aroma on top of a malty lager scent. Kinda reminds me of a dark euro lager with smoke hints, slight hop flavor, nice level of maltiness. Med to light mouth. Not as intense on the smoke as say the rogue, makes this beer much more appealing to mainstream beer drinkers, i would think.","Tballz420","Aug 10, 2004"

4.5,21.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Tasters may compare this to the Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier beers ( which come in marzen, wheat and urbock stylesÂstyles also brewed by Spezial.) The Lager is sweeter, has less alcohol, and less-assertive smokyness. The roastyness added interest.","sparkydoyle","Jun 08, 2004"
4.42,19.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Poured into a tall pilsner glass from the 25 oz bottle, it delivers a clear, deep-amber/copper body with an orangeish glow and some golden highlights at the base of the glass. Plumes of very tiny, somewhat effervescent bubbles stream upwards towards its creamy ivory head. The head retention is very good and it holds well and leaves some nice lace about the glass. The aroma displays a distinct, but nicely restrained, Beechwood smoke over a grainy maltiness. Very nicely done! There are some examples that push the limits, and there are some that hold back a bit too much, but like the finest examples of the style this one is right on. The body is medium; and combines with a very fine-bubbled, median carbonation it gives a lightly crisp and then smooth mouthfeel. In the flavor, the Beechwood smokiness is wrapped within a blanket of distinctly grainy, lightly toffee-ish malt. It's very well balanced between the two; and backed by a firm bitterness that becomes more solid at the swallow, leaving it to finish dry with some rising, spicy hops and just a mild touch of lingering smoke. Although some tasters might believe that this is a bit restrained for the style, that's far from the truth. Not all Bamberg rauchbiers are as bold as the best known examples; and in fact, this is a perfect example of the very drinkable and balanced dunkle lager that you might find at a tavern, hotel, or keller in the area. Its smokiness does not build on the palate after a few litres, and it retains its lightly sweet and grainy maltiness. Very nice! An excellent example of an authentic Bamberg-style rauchbier that's absolutely worth trying!","NeroFiddled","May 31, 2004"
3.74,1.1,3,4,4,3,3.5,"Pours a deep copper hue that is a bit cloudy and has about and inch tall white head. The head dissolved fairly quickly into a light bubbly cap on the beer with almost no sign of lacing. There is definitely a smoky scent detectable but it does not completely dominate the aroma. Some malt sweetness stood out as well with hints of spiciness detected. The taste is very similar to the smell with a definite smokiness with sweet malt and a slight hoppiness present. The finish was dry and smoky which hung around in the mouth for a while. This has a good medium body and a very smooth drinking beer. This was my first experience with a Rauchbier and I am very intrigued by the style. It has a great unique taste and would defiantly recommend this to anyone who has not tried the style.","meathookjones","May 24, 2004"
3.95,6.8,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Not as complex as it could be, but this is an interesting and historical style that I really enjoy. This oozes charcoaled beechwood malt, from start to finish. Very pleasant to sip.","merlin48","Mar 31, 2004"
3.82,3.2,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Clear, amber in hue with noticeable highlights of copper and maybe a splash of bronze. A foamy white head of a half finger formed but failed to hold long. It quickly faded to a bubbly collar. Subsequent lacing never transpired. Honestly I was expecting a darker, more mysterious looking beer. I like surprises. The smokiness of the nose was obvious but light, the aromatics from the malts displayed a soft smoked meat/beef jerky/campfire baked beans with lots of bacon characteristics. Behind these smells laid a suggestion of lager airiness, maybe a hint of hops too. The potency is modest. The invitation is clear enough. Lets drink! Upfront on the palate the smoky qualities of the beer are found. Cured bacon/ham notes, a beechwood campfire off in the distant, and a hint of wet wood. These qualities are all pleasant. None of them are loud, maybe I am being greedy but I was looking for more, still no complaints. In the middle and especially at the finish this beer nearly sheds its smoky start and becomes a lager like a Pils or a smaller Helles. The hops really slice through the heavy malty qualities, that seems Pils like but there is also a faint suggestion of non-cured malt that lends itself to resemble a Helles. The main point is the smoky flavors fade away. This beer would work wonders with many meaty, BBQ dishes. The start of the beer matches the flavors of fire-cooked food but the end of the beer is crisp enough to lift away the residual heft, this allows for consumption of ÂnewÂ flavors. The aftertaste grows more hammy and smoky. Tacky too, in the mouthfeel, I wonder if a bit more carbonation would help. Regardless the mouthfeel is good. This is plenty drinkable but not too challenging, i.e., smoky. I liked it, IÂm glad I tried it; I now know what to expect. If you want to get smoked-out, skip this and go for an Aecht Schlenkerla, if I want a clean German lager with a Rachbier background I would select this. I purchased a 500 ml bottle in Iowa City. Worth trying.","bditty187","Mar 17, 2004"

Aroma: Great kilned malts, awesome air of smoked meat like a jar of beef jerky good stuff in my opinion. Taste: Mild compared to the other famous Rauchbier of Bamberg, but so tasty at the same time. Great crisp lager with nice malt character finishes nice and smokey but doesn't overwelm the palate, nice mixture of flavors. Mouthfeel: Medium to light in body solid carbonation, good stuff overall. Drinkability: Can't complain I could picture being in Bamber at the brewery located on the river drinking this on tap, would be such a treat.","WVbeergeek","Jan 28, 2004"

3.9,5.4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Dirty amber color, murky, minimal white head rapidly turns into a ring. Aroma is surprising by it's low intensity. It's nevertheless packed with subtleties. The smokiness here seems to be expressed through leather hints. There's also a cerealic thing going on here. In mouth, this is very easy to drink, intensily malty and refreshing. Above average carbonation and lagerish thin-medium body. Highly drinkable, but not as expressing as I had hoped.","Rastacouere","Dec 19, 2003"

4.12,11.4,4,4.5,4,4,4,"This beer pours with some viscosity. It creates small bubbly tan head above the slightly hazed light copper beer that literally vanishes before my very eyes. The aroma reminds me of camping in the Wisconsin northwoods. Damp and smoky...wet leaves. I like it a lot. The smoke is very subtle on the nose. On the buds this one hits the spot. The smoke is intertwined nicely with some slightly bitter hop tones a toasty vienna like malt foundation. No ashtray here...just a nice drinking rauchbier.","Bighuge","Dec 09, 2003"

3.9,5.4,4,4,4,4,3.5,"Beautiful golden orange color with a foamy, bubbly white head. Smell is of a distinct smokiness most akin to smoked salmon with some caramel thrown in for good measure. Only moderate smokiness penetrates through the palate, leaving notes of bready malt, caramel, lightly spicy hops, and smoked meat. Medium-bodied, lightly carbonated with a smooth, round mouthfeel. Drinkability is good for the style, but this beer is still a little much for me to regularly drink. Nonetheless, an attractive rauchbier with lots of character that would be perfect with your next barbecue.","Jon","Beers"
3.75,1.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,"Turbid orange based gold color with nice thicket of white head. Smoky nose to some extent, definitely not overwhelming. Smells more of a quality lager with a slight smoky nose. Almost as how one's clothes smell the day after being around a campfire (minus, of course, the humanly stenches of day-old clothing :^) I feel some smoked beers can be a little taxing in the drinkability department, but this one has the sublty to send it's drinkability sky high. A plethora of culinary delights could be paired with this beer.","crookedhalo","0"

4,8.1,4,4,4,4,4,"A nice copper color pours with a good cream/ tan colored head. First aroma is of a hoppy spiciness (a bit surprising, in a good way), but then a background smokiness kicks in, and soon becomes all you can smell. Good amount of body to this brew, nice solid malt presence accompanied by a bit of malt sweetness, very nice. Finishes with a smoky finish, that soon infuses the whole taste of the beer from start to finish. The smoke is reasonably subdued though. Not quite as good and hearty as when sampled fresh at the brewery, but if this is all you can get don't miss it.","Gueuzedude","Jan 12, 2003"

Poured a dark straw color, with about the prettiest head I've ever seen: nice, creamy, and rounded (this was in a half pint glass, not a true pint glass, however). The aroma was woody, sweet/fruity, and of course smokey. Taste was actually slightly sweet and mild, followed by an all smoke finish. The adjective that comes to mind for this brew is mild...the smoke flavor is not overwhelming. Not a style I would go for normally, but certainely worthy of a half pint, which wasn't bad drinking. pat","PatandDavid","Oct 14, 2002"

4.17,12.7,4,4.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Clear bronze hue w/ copious flecks of yeast aggregates. Thick, slowly disappating off - white head. Beechwood smoke aroma is surprisingly mild compared to other rauchbiers and is well integrated in the aroma-- toasty Vienna and /or Munich malt is discernible & light crystal malt sweetness is there as well. Although expectedly smoky in flavor, the smoke is well calculated & isn't overbearing. Rich, nutty, perhaps decocted malt aren't hidden and since the body is light this rauchbier is quite drinkable. The smokiness almost seems to dissapate, and malt flavors become more assertive as I drink this brew. Hop bitterness is moderate and pleasant, while the hop flavor is herbal Hallertauer. Finishes, clean and crisp, w/ a mellow and fading smokiness. This is the most drinkable rauchbier I've had-- it wet my appetite for smoked food. I will now comb the pantry.","marc77","0"
