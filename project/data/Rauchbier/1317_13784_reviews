"A friend gave me a growler of this as a housewarming gift. This was definitely among the best smoked beers I've ever had. Poured into a pint glass, a cloudy, dark, bronzed brown with a patchy off-white head. Smelled like some kind of awesome barbeque of beer, with the smokey aroma pretty much dominating all. Big taste of smoked meats, heavy on the malts, woody, earthy, with just a hint of piney hops making it through once the smoke has mellowed a bit. Medium mouthfeel, chewy, lots of character. Very drinkable for the style, however, I really have to be in the mood for a beer this smokey. I like it alot, just have to be in the mood."
"I had this one at the Princeton locaton on 1/19/08. When I was there it was called a Rauchbock with a 7.3% ABV. I'm sure it's the same beer. The color of this beer was dark burgendy mixed in with some mahagony brown. It had a long lasting head of white foam that left behind a small white film, plenty of white foamy rings, and quite a few streaks of white lace. It had a heavy aroma of olives, smoke, smoked wood, peat, and smoked meats. The aroma was so heavy you could just smell the beer as they were pouring it. I thought that since the aroma was strong, the taste was going to follow suit. That wasn't the case. Instead, the taste had a medium powered kick of smoked meats, olives, smoked malts, and just plain and simple smoke. It was a medium bodied beer with a short lived aftertaste of smoked meats and smoked malts. Usually the aftertaste of a Rauchbier lingers on for quite a long time, but this aftertaste felt like it just gave up. I would say that this one is worth a shot. You usually don't find that many Rauchbier brewpub beers. If I saw it again, I would give it another shot."
"I'm a big fan of rauchbier, and this is one of the best I've had. Fantastic smell - a smokier sausage-flavor instead of the usual bacon/maple bacon scents. Great taste as well, delivering on all the promise of the smell while true to the style of beer. A little ""lighter"" than usual rauchbiers in the mouth, but that detracts only a little from the finish. Great effort, and one to seek out if you like or want to try this style beer."
"Lightly crisp mouthfeel, and it finishes slightly dry. The smokiness lasts briefly on the tongue. If this is on tap when you visit you must try it. Only wish I could have had a slab of BBQ ribs with this."
"Reccomended as this rauch can bridge the gap between an intro for the beginner and a tasty treat for the road traveled pro."
"Smell is of smoke. Very strong, even for me with my limited sense of smell. Taste is of hickory bacon and smoke. Not as intense Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Marzen, but that is a very good thing. The smoke isn't subtle either. Smooth and drinkable as all get out."
"The BA who likes a good brown or stout, and has not found a rauchbier to their liking would do well to seek this out."
"Wow! They advertise that this is brewed with 99% smoked malt but it doesn't come off nearly as smokey as that suggests. It's clearly a Beechwood smoked malt, and I think they're using Weyermann's, but in any case, it works! Its clear copper body rests beneath a thin head of bright white foam that drops shortly to just a collar. The nose is distinctly Beechwood smoked grainy malt. The body is medium and it's crisp in the mouth with a standard carbonation. The flavor is malty and smokey with some floral and spicy hops and a touch of sulphur that accentuates its solid bitterness. It finishes short and dry with just a slight residual smokiness - well done!!! It's very enjoyable on its own, and it pairs exceptionally well with most cheesy dishes including their grilled pizza appetizer! Worth trying."
