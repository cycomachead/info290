"Taste: Again, woody, caramel, smoky, like burnt mesquite and caramelized campfire wood. Very mellow and pleasant. Certainly a lovely brew, faithful to style and light enough to enjoy anytime. This particular night (rainy, cold, before a Watter show) was perfect!"

"D/O- Overall, just a tad sweeter than I'd like from a rauchbier personally. Other than that really no complaints. This is a beer I wouldn't mind drinking in bunches on a fall night."
""
"Comes off as a milder rauch with some marzen character.  Decent but not really bringing the goods or really interesting to me."
"Taste is lightly smoky, nutty toasted malt comes through as well. Finishes dry, and is light to medium bodied with ample carbonation. Overall a nice easy-going rauchbier that would be a good intro for the style. Pretty drinkable and actually refreshing which is rare for the style."

"A decent rauchbier, not overpowered by the smokiness."

"This is pretty good.  It's not nearly as aggressive and intense as it's Bamberg counterparts, but it's no slouch.  I'd consider it to likely be a more accessible entrance into Rauchbier."

"This 'Rauchbier' (Smoked beer- type of beer with a distinctive smoke flavor imparted by using malted barley dried over an open flame) pours a very dark drown with ruby highlights, almost black in color actually with a thin beige head. Spotty lacing was seen when sipped. The aroma is very pleasant of German roasted malts, yeast with a light hint of smoke. The taste starts out a little salty (NOT overdone at all) with some dark bread with a light hint of smoke that wasn't over done at all. Very nice and goes down very easy. No harsh or bitter aftertaste at all. Perfect carbonation and medium-bodied. Never had this style of brew before and really liked it! Have to say I was very impressed! Prosit! :)"

"Overall - The label describes this as ""subtly-smoked"" and it succeeds there, a pretty decent rauchbier that doesn't overwhelm and delivers some solid ol' fashioned German lager flavors."
""
"Out of the box, nice, this rauchbier doesn't just rely on heavily smoked malts, but has tasty hops and a great Munich-style helles malt sweetness. Still, if you want that rough barbecue aftertaste, this isn't the right beer for you."

"D- Looks and smells great. Has a nice level of smokiness and malt sweetness/bitterness levels. Let down by this thin finish. Overall, very drinkable though."

"This is a weird beer. Although I'm still within the best by date, I fear this bottle may be past its prime."
"Drinkability: This strikes me like a bit of a smoked English pale ale combined with some German ale characteristics. It is different from other rauchbiers I have had. Could have several. A very good brew."
"0.5l bottle, best by 19 Feb 2010 (a little late...). Pours a completely clear golden-orange color, creamy off-white head, decent lacing. Aroma is caramel malts, wheat, wood, slight smoke and bacon. Flavor is pale malts, a bit of caramel, fruity, and some smoke. Mouthfeel is light to medium with a dry finish. Decent beer, I tend to like this level of smoke, but it could use more smoke and more backbone."
"D- High- I would drink a growler of this and not be sick of it. The attenuated smoke levels do this beer a favor- impossibly drinkable."
"Overall, a well rounded and balanced beer. Enough smoke to keep things interesting without over doing it."
"The beer pours a dark golden color with a thick frothy off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a light, pale and Munich malt scent along with a mild smoked character. The taste is decent as well. It has a light pale malt flavor with some moderately sweet Munich malt notes. The Rauch malt is quite assertive. It's a nice smokey flavor. It's too bad the rest of the malt bill is lacking. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low/medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an above average rauchbier, but nothing exceptional. It's easy drinking, but not too interesting."
"50cl bottle. Pours clear yellow-copper with a huge, fluffy white head that won't die. Thick lacing when it finally does. Light smoked malt aroma with nice fruitiness. Grainy and earthy. Full, malty taste with some light smoked grain. Somewhat fruity and a bit sweet; hoppiness at the end combines with smoke to dry it out. Not the kind of beer you sit and search out all of the minute complexities of, even though they're definitely present. The kind of thing to drink and enjoy, and drink some more. Great rauchbier."
"Very drinkable, moderate in ABV, and complex."
"M&D: due to the good level of bitterness and chewy-hop palate, on top of superb carbonation that makes the bier as soft as refreshing, I find this Rauchbier probably the most drinkable/quaffable amongst those I've ever tried! After trying three rauchbier recently, I really really long to fly to Bamberg in the near future to taste these smoked nectar on cask/tap!"
"All-in-all not a bad beer. Personally, when it comes to Rauchbiers, I say bring on the funk. The smokier the better."
"BB 01-02-07. Nice and good lasting head and a bronze golden beercollor. Nose is combination of smoked maltyness and citrussy hops that give it a fresh twist. Smoke very obvious also in taste that's nice and round and full of flavour. Moderate bitterness fitting the brew that's marzen like and shows bit of sweetness. Low carbonisation fitting the brew and overall very enjoying beer that's quiet Schenkerla like but bit smoother and rounder."
