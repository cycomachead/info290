3.92,-3.2,3,4,4,3.75,4,"Pours a cloudy medium amber.  Normal head volume, above average retention and lacing.  Excellent nose of wood smoke with distinct cherry like sweet notes.  It lacks the meatiness of the Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbiers and is lower in intensity.  Light medium body with a somewhat oily texture.  Normal carbonation with a bit of effervescence in the finish.  The flavor profile is outstanding and follows the nose in regard to Aecht Schlenkerla  Rauchbiers (no meat, less complex and less intense).  It begins with a burst of smoke over a sweet cherry note.  The middle is a subtle bitterness with an ashy quality over caramel sweetness.  The finish is a slow fade of smoky sweetness with a slight alcohol note.  A very good offering, especially for style introduction purposes, but not in the same league as Aecht Schlenkerla.","tillmac62","Dec 23, 2014"

So I tend to base my opinions of smoked beers on how they compare and, if I didn't know any better, I'd swear this southern Oregon town was actually part of Upper Franconia. Caldera's Rauch Ãœr Bock fairs very well indeed.","biegaman","Dec 22, 2014"

Strong smoke start with an average lager body. Light flavors of malt and fruit are overwhelmed by smoke, which leaves a chemically aftertaste, like burning electronic components. I didn't really enjoy this beer. I'm a fan of smoked beers, but the finish on this one was just way off for my taste.

4.07,0.5,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"This beer pours a very clear and attractive shade of ruby brown. Much less dark than I had anticipated, and carrying a diminutive, but attractive head of parchment foam that leaves very nice lace. The smoky aroma of this beer is very nice. It smells like the smoke that would waft from the smoker at a little restaurant in my home town of Traverse City, Michigan. Porky, sweet and delectable with notes of brown sugar. I suddenly have a huge craving for an "all meat mess." The flavor is also quite nice in that the smoke is not too overpowering. Other flavors include sweet dark malt, brown sugar, a bit of cinnamon and leather. Quite nice and well blended. The body is medium with a mouthfeel that seems a bit sticky, but is pretty good. Surprisingly drinkable, and would be great (of course) with BBQ. Not the first smoked beer I have had, but the first I have reviewed. This one makes me want to seek out more.","zoso1967","Jun 29, 2010"
4.04,-0.2,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"D: This is the best of the Kettle Series I've had. A very well made rauchbier, in the same league as Schlenkerla at a cheaper price. Rare style too. Good job Caldera.","Halcyondays","Jun 05, 2010"
4.14,2.2,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"D: Despite a heavenly aroma and feel and good flavor, this 'only' can muster a 4.0, simply due to a hefty alcohol girth. It's a touch on the sweet side (ur-bock) but the smokiness is well done. Sure it's worth a glass (or two) and is one I'd definitely have again.","msubulldog25","May 04, 2010"
