2.43,-30.6,3.5,3,2,2,2.5,"O: I've really been disappointed with Starr Hill's selection, and this did nothing to lift the mediocrity. Everything they brew feels unnecessarily watery and tastes like not much, and this was no exception.","the38raven","Beers"
3.65,4.3,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a clear golden body with creamy never say die head that leaves lace as it slowly descends. A smokey, but not too smokey (i.e. beef jerky) smell and I can detect a hint of sweetness. Taste is more of the same as this medium-bodied beer isn't as dry or cutting as other smoke beers, but has a good smoke profile and also some sweet caramel and other sugary malts poke through. Not as ""smokey"" as other rauchbiers and the profile of the beer is a little generic but overall I enjoyed this one.","clayrock81","0"
4.05,15.7,4,4,4,4.5,4,"O: Good rauchbier. Sweeter than expected; soft and undemanding. The smoke is secondary, but always in the background. Recommended. I would drink again.","AgentMunky","Jan 09, 2011"
4.16,18.9,3,4.5,4.5,3,4,"Simply put, this is one of the highlights on Starr Hill's roster of beers.","WMEugene","Apr 01, 2009"
4.3,22.9,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"One dimensional, perhaps, but it doesn't pretend otherwise. A good beer to make a convert out of your mainstream-beer loving friend (although you should ask yourself if someone who loves mainstream beer is really your friend). Not recommendable for people who don't like smokey flavor, but if you do, you're in for a treat!","zaphodchak","Dec 27, 2008"
3.52,0.6,3,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Overall beer is decent, perhaps a little too much smoke character with not enough balance on the malt side.","rugerj","Nov 12, 2008"
3.5,0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pretty smooth. A somewhat creamy feel, with a medium body.","TheMistler","Beers"
3.5,0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Drinkability: A very interesting beer, but not from a style I care too much for. That being said, I still enjoyed this one, and would be more than happy to give it a try again, though I fear availability will be an issue. Alcohol is completely hidden, despite its level. A good fall-time beer.","CrellMoset","0"
