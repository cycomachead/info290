4.32,2.1,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.75,4.25,"Turbid, muddy brown appearance with an off white head of one finger that fades at a glacial pace. Smells of smoky, cured meats - summer sausage, bacon, beef jerky and pepperoni. The cured meat aromas from the nose carry over to the palate in only the slightest manner which is probably a good thing. I get smokey, toasted malt followed by a nice shot of acidity to keep this very drinkable. The mouthfeel is incredible - rich, thick and creamy. New Glarus' and Lakefront's rauchbiers are the only I've previously had - both were good but nothing special. Black Husky's is easily a step or two above - this is a must try if you're into smoked beers.","bound4er","Dec 01, 2014"

4.83,14.2,4.75,4.75,4.75,5,5,"O - I was warned about this beer by the owner and brewmaster, Tim about a month before opening it. His exact words escape me but essentially, Smoke Monster isn't usually supposed to turn out this way. I can't speak to how Smoke Monster normally turns out but, whatever he did to ""mess it up", I sure hope he kept track of, because Smoke Monster is not only one of the greatest smoked beers to hit my lips, it's already on my list as favorite beers of the year and one that won't soon be forgotten. The rich, creamy texture is something to behold - if it can be replicated (and actually isn't nitro'ed)...let's just say Left Hand's techniques will be reckoned with. Smoke Monster is just simply amazing.","BeerFMAndy","Feb 28, 2014"
