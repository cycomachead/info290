4.58,30.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.75,4.75,"This pours the color of a well-made craft lager: like a clear gold-tan with no hint at all of the flavor explosion in store! Smells like a campfire, tastes like smokey band-aids, and if that’s your thing (as it is for me) then you’ll enjoy it. Otherwise, avoid. More for me!","elNopalero","Jan 03, 2014"

3.51,-0.3,3.25,3.5,3.25,4.75,3.5,"This beer pours clear light amber color with a frothy white head. The beer tastes as it sounds. It is a smoked lager. The smoke is the domiant flavor and is still quite light. There is a slight oak character as well as a touch of BBQ. Other then the smoke this beer seems like a plain old lager. It has a light malt backbone and a subtle grain character. The Lager yeast is obvious and also attributes to the flavor. This beer is balanced, easy drinking, and pretty well done. It is also quite safe and boring.","TwelveOunces","Dec 29, 2012"

3.85,9.4,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours a clear light golden color with a very thin head that doesnt stick around for long. The nose is slightly smokey with a bit of meat. Touch of malt in the background. Flavor adds in a good touch of smoke and hits the crisp malt quite well. Nice balance and not overly smoked. Light to medium body with good carbonation and a smokey finish. Tasty. I like it.","Thorpe429","Jun 21, 2010"
1.71,-51.4,3.5,2.5,1.5,1,1,"Reviewed on 6/24/2010. On tap at Eccentric Cafe. Pours a clear orange with a small white head. Aroma of mild smoke and malt. Flavor of smoke, tons of leather, and tar. Very thin palate and overall this was a gross, disgusting beer (and normally I am a fan of smoked beers). Would not recommend!!","LilBeerDoctor","Jun 07, 2010"
3.78,7.4,3,2.5,4.5,4,4,"Drinkability: This is really good, and would be great for outdoor evenings from the summer throughout the fall; moderate ABV allows for plenty of drinking it, but I would personally limit it after a bit as the smokiness may become a bit much after a while. Solid though, glad I got to try this unique beer.","bamadog","May 23, 2010"
3.34,-5.1,3.5,2,3.5,4.5,4,"The mouthfeel and flavor of the beer are both substantially better than expected. Full bodied with a prominent spicy, hoppy character ip front that is slowly countered by a sweet caramel malt backbone which has a nice smokey presence that lngers into a long dry finish. Subtle hints of charcoal, BBQ, bacon, campfire and butane. The smokiness bcomes more evident as this beer mares and really shows in the finish but I wish it was a touch more intense. Nicely balance bur not one of the best examples of he style.","corby112","Apr 17, 2010"
3.48,-1.1,4,3.5,3.5,4,3,"Conclusion: The first few sips of this I was pretty sure I hated...it grew on me as I drank it and I reconciled myself to the fact that this was not a smoked meat kind of rauchbier. Overall, decent, I might give it another try.","BedetheVenerable","Beers"
3.92,11.4,3,3.5,4,4,4.5,"it's a grainy, sweet lager with well-executed bitterness. the smoke flavor is strong and thoroughly Bambergian, though more woody than meat product. that's a funny thing to say about a beer, you might say...i always think of those wonderful Bamberg rauchbiers as bacon in a glass, but the smoke in this one seems more like woodfire than smoked sausage","bruachan","0"
