"Holy liquid smoke!  I felt like I had been sitting near a camp fire from the smells and taste coming from my glass."

"Nose is way too medicinal. Taste is peaty, bitter, and medicinal. Finishes enjoyable with a good smokey aftertaste. I know this is a rauchbier but what the heck is with the medicine flavor."

"Clearish medium amber pour into a 33cl glass, with a small white head that retained as a small ringlet. Biscuity malt aroma with a nice scent of a fresh burning campfire. A nice smoky malt flavor here that wasn't too potent or overdone, making this an easy-drinking rauchbier; lesser notes of toasted bread and maybe a faint whisper of leafy hops. It wasn't a full-blown smoked ham like some rauchbiers, but I think that's a good thing. I have to kind of be in the mood for a smoked beer, and even then, one is usually enough. This one was light and palatable enough for me to want to go back for more."

"Pours an amber-brown color with an eggshell colored head and good carbonation. Good lacing through consumption. Smells smokey yet some sweetness is present via the nose. Taste reveals some caramel or candy up front and then finishes with a long smokey flavor. A definite favorite from Victory."

"Drinking this from a tap at Good-Ta-Go in Chambersburg, Pa. Beer has a decent color. The taste is definitely a bit smoky and reminds me of hot dog / grill water but not in a bad way by any means. We dont have much experience with smoked beers but this is unusual but drinkable."

"Overall, what we liked best about this beer was the flavoring through the aftertaste, and the creamy feel. The smoke was pervasive throughout, adding depth to the flavoring and the nose, but it avoided becoming overwhelming, which we appreciated. The beer remains light and highly drinkable, and is rather comforting, but it does, at times, border on cheapness."

"May be spot on for the style..I dont know.. I can only say for smoked beer its not great in my opinion.. I have used liquid smoke in cooking and thats what I taste.. It gets a little better as it sits.. but still tough to palate."
"Overall: still trying to get into these smoked beers. This one is good once you start to get through it."
"D - Boldly smoky but surprisingly drinkable. The malty, Octoberfest like base works well with the smoke and softens it's slightly medicinal character."
"Definitely hits the sweet spot if big-time smoke is what you're looking for, but lacks the depth of the Aecht Schlenkerla rauchbiers. A pint was plenty here, not bad though."
"Overall, it's a bit too sweet for my tastes and it's light bodied, but it sure does feel true to style, and would certainly substitute for Schlenkerla nicely."
"O - Enjoyable beer, wouldn't mind having it again. The flavor is a good example of the style and it's pretty easy to get down."
"O-i don't know what it is but i really like this. its just such a unique taste, and its very full flavored. i definitely wouldn't mind having a lot of this. in fact, i might have to come back to this bar soon so i can get some more."
"On a guest tap at Fatheads Cleveland. A little disapointing, as I like anything smoked, but still drinkable. I was hoping to growler this. Very smoke,and a little too much like inhaling at a public BBQ, not getting much else complexity. Average mouthfeel, served at correct temperature."
"It is delicious, starts with a burst of sweet toasty malt then fades into the strong but not overpowering smokiness that lingers like the memory of bacon on an otherwise dastardly morning. It just stays, telling a story. Medium bodied, a damn fine lager. I hope to see this around NY a bit more often."
"O - I think this has good drinkability. I can see how a lot of people would not like this style of beer if you weren't expecting the smokiness, but I for one really enjoy it. Overall, I thought this was a really nice rauchbier, and I hop I get a chance to drink it again. Give it a shot if you come across it."
"Pours a clear copper, nice sized foam and lace stickage. Aroma of smoke cured meats and beechwood smoked malt. Follows through in the taste with a nice smoked profile, bbq meats, ham and charcoal. Beefy. Tasty. Medium bodied feel, good carbonation level. Overall, a tasty rauch but not for the faint palate."
"There is a very strong smoke flavor - borderline overwhelming. The smoke overpowers any sweetness, all I taste is an ashy flavor. Honestly, I don't really get the appeal of rauchbiers..."
"Pours a clean yellow-ish color with a small off white head. In the aroma, bacon and smoke, with hints of a lager in there somewhere. In the taste, beef jerky and smoked pork. A smooth and light bodied mouthfeel, with a dry cabin fire and smoked pork kind of aftertaste. Still a lager but nice smoke, pretty damn nice."
"This is a beer with a real smoky taste and smell. The color was orange-gold, with a light foamy head. I feel it would be better consumed along with food (which I didn't have at the time), in order to balance the strong flavors. Probably would be good with BBQ, smoked salmon, or strong cheese. I could barely finish one pint and did not enjoy it. I'll always remember what a Rauchbier is after this pour."
"D - eminently drinkable, but the smoke builds up on the palate - a sipper, for sure"
"I quickly looked his beer up on my phone and it appeared to be either new or on tap only. I sampled one ounce of this and was drinking liquid smoke. I could not drink a full one. My friend is bold and orders a tall goblet of Scarlet Fire and can't finish one on his own. so I help him out AND review it. Color is copper-orange, slighty cloudy, and the head and lacing are like that of wine, so none. Aroma: smoke. I can't smell anything but smoke, like jerky. The taste is only that of smoked malt. This beer is way overdone on smoked malt and needs to go back to formula. Sorry, Victory."
"D: The beer isn't that difficult to drink because the smoky aroma and taste is not overpowering."
"Overall this wasn't as smooth as some of the better-known smoked beers but I still enjoyed it. Worth a shot."
"Pours a deep brown with a tan head and a bit of lacing. Nose brings a good dose of smoke and a little bit of earth. Taste is smoky but not overly so. Not a huge amount of other flavors and lacking in the leafy character of many beers of the style. Feel is fairly light and a bit dry. Drinks really well with great body and a not overpowering level of smoke."
"D: not really engrossing enough for me to revisit, mainly because of its simplicity and watery character"
"The bottom line - don't have to learn the hard way not to let this pass by. Try it if you have the chance. You'll be GRATEFUL too! Get you some before you end up DEAD!"
"Schlenkerla Marzen was the first rauch I had and I loved it. I suppose I more or less judge any other rauch against that. The Schlenkerla is art. A lot of domestics are okay but off-balanced. With Scarlet Fire, I found a domestic rauch that's very well-balanced, not trying to push any envelopes within the style, and crazy easy to drink."
"Overall a tasty smoked beer."
"D: The Scarlet Fire is an excellent smoked lager with a prominent, but not overwhelming smoke flavor. Easy to sip on, but not for long term drinking."
"Good mouthfeel with good drinkability. Glad I tried this one but I would not actively seek this one out in the future. Barely above average overall."
"This beer is confusing. When I first taste it, I think, medium bodied but by the time I swallow I think it was quite watery. There isn't really any bitterness or sweetness to it. Some moderate to low body in the front and it finishes cleanly. Some of the smoke character is left as a late or even a slight aftertaste and the smoke builds the more you drink. Overall its a pretty decent rauchbier. Could use some beefing up though."
"This guy's been a Want since I learned it existed. Luckily for me ChurchKey's draft list is badass. The pour results in a clear copper/amber with about half a finger of white foam on top. Good start, right? Well, the honeymoon ends when I smell the thing. Whatever is there is very faint, unlike any rauch or smoked beer I've had before. There's a tinge of smokiness, as though the grill wasn't working properly. There's also an intimation of wheat. That's about it. The taste comes off similarly. There's a light smoked ham flavor, along with some wheat bread and a vague dull bitterness. Frankly, according to my tongue, this is one of the weakest smoky beers I've ever had. That said, it's not bad-tasting, just not what it claims to be. The body is pretty light, with moderate carbonation and a smooth and moist feel. Honestly, not a bad brew overall, but I expected better from Victory."
"D-this has a nice smokey presence toit with a good balance of sweetness from the malts and hops in the back.. has some good stuff going on here."
"Pours a clear ruby red. Good carbonation. Smells of attractive hickory smoked flavor. Bartender said this was a one off but it smells &tastes great. Wish they would offer this more. Flavor I'd almost liken the malts and taste to are flavors on a BBQ grill with ham or rib flavor. Excellent for any beer drinker who loves ribs, wings, or any BBQ. I really like this. Wish I could get a sixer. I can see if some are turned off as this one probably has a smaller audience than most beers."
"Mesquite smoke aroma. Taste is similar smoke with a Carolina tang/Memphis sweet hybrid BBQ sauce mish mash sweetness. Underlying fruit which seems out of place. Pharmaceutical huskiness with swallow. Mouthfeel is a little juicy."
"Really drinkable, I downed my pint in no time. Good beer overall."
"The smoked ham aftertaste really lingers in my mouth and makes it salivate, and because of this dominating taste, does not get high marks from me for drinkability. I was intrigued to try it when I read the description of this brew, but probably wouldn't get it again unless it was paired well with a meal."
"Poured into a tulip from a growler obtained yesterday and kept in the fridge. Pours a dark caramel red/amber with a finger-width head with substantial retention. Aroma is caramel, toffee, some bready malt and a suggestion of smokiness from the smoked malt. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with medium carbonation, not too heavy, in anticipation of watching some AFC/NFC championship football. The taste, however, is a different story. Taste is caramel, toffee, whole-grain bread, toast, light charcoal, and a light astringent smokiness. I expected a dark, roasty smokiness from this beer, but the smoke is merely a background note. No hop presence to speak of. Overall this beer is not one I would try again. I saw ""smoked malt"" on the Victory brewpub menu, and after trying Stone's smoked porter, I have to try any smoked beer. Next time I will be more discerning."
"Drinkability: As for drinkability, this is a fine beer but more of a curiosity for me. I don't mind the smoky flavor and would drink it again if offered, but I don't think this is a preferred style for me so I won't go out of my way to have it again. I think for me this a good representative of an unusual style but not something I feel the need to seek out and have again."
"0.4 litre glass at the brewpub"
"Pours a clear golden amber color with thin white head. Aroma was kind of week, not as smokey as I would like. Flavor was also weak, watered down with only a faint hint of smoked malt. Very disappointing."
"This beer poured a golden color with a slight redness to it. The carbonation was too much and resulted in a nice enough head but nothing really note worthy. The aroma had a smokiness that couldn't be missed and a sweet maltiness that pretty much dominated any real hop complexity. The taste was a very upfront smokiness that I thought was more aggressive than the Sly Fox Rauch. Still a very well balanced beer."
"Overall this was an odd one for me. Not bad at all, just very different. The spiciness of the profile really took me off guard on here. I would have no issue with trying this one again, it was just a bit weird is all."
"Leave it to Victory to nail another German style-awesome, just awesome take on this one."
"Notes:Great balance and a really good beer. I liked it and I really did not detect any sausage flavor or meat taste.I don't think I would have minded though. Overall,I will have this again."
"Pours a clear amber. Fairly mild smoked nose. Flavor is a nice meaty smoked thing. Nice pronounced flavor. Nice ride for the tongue. Well balanced on the smoke. Feel is good. Drinkability is high. This is a rauch that more than the average person could go on. There's no abrasive smoke on it and it's well balanced enough that you can quickly go through it."
"D - this is a good beer, but the smokiness sort of limits its drinkability/sessionability. Still, I enjoyed it and would order again. It's just not something I could drink a lot of."
"I love BBQ (real BBQ, slow smoked pork), but had a real hard time with this beer. Too smoky, no complexity. If you like smoked beers, you will like this one. But, I'm not liking smoked beers, so I don't like this one."
"D- I have been drinking this beer since it went on draft at Frisco's, won't quit until its gone."
"The beer poured a clear, dark amber with a thin, white head into a pint glass. A slightly sweet smell of yeast, with no discernable smoky aroma. A very nice smoke flavor, not overpowering, with a very smooth finish with a very low hop profile. Very refreshing and drinkable. An accurate representation of the Rauchbier style, in my opinion."
"Tried this on tap at Tria. Pours a hazy rust like color. Had a slight smell of burnt wood chip soaked in chick pea brine. The taste was that of a four day old italian hoagie covered in liquid smoke. Not for me at all. It was tought to get down but good for the style. I just don't like Rauchbier."
"The taste haunts me, just beyond accurate description. I am eager for another."
"D: This is a good alternativfe to a marzen style especially coming out of the winter months. It remind you that BBQ weather is around the corner. Alway a good style with grilled sausage and the like and this is spot on. This is an easy drinking rauch with a well blended smoke flavor."
"It arrived with a big, off-white head that slowly reduced to a light coating of wisps. The color was a hazy, light-orange. The nose had a great smoky sweetness to it, not unlike hickory-smoked bacon, if that is your thing. It's definitely mine. The mouthfeel was on the thin side, but it still had a nice effervescence. I really got a jolt of smoke on the tongue and the lingering smokiness on the finish was just what I had dreamt about. Smoke 'em if you've got 'em, boys and girls!"
"I applaud Victory for keeping things new and exciting, and also going Smoke Free as of this past week."
"D: Very drinkable with a low abv. Check this out while it lasts and enjoy a bit of Bamberg in Pennsylvania Dutch country."
"For the record, this was the first time I've tried this style, and while many say it's an acquired taste, I must have acquired it right then and there. My fiancee, who isn't a huge beer drinker also found this to be quite enjoyable."
" Did pair well with a buffalo chicken pizza and chicken cheese steak."
"Overall a very drinkable brew. I would have liked a bit more smokiness in the aroma but flavors were right on the mark. Not over powering like a lot of the smoked beers. A nice soft balance with the hops in the role of complementing the malts. Another nice job from Victory of a little seen style in the States."
"Nothing like a pint of liquid beef jerky on an empty stomach, I think to myself, as I now belch up some smoky goodness. It poured a dark copper/amber color, with a thin head, that was gone before I even started drinking. Granted, I let the beer sit for a while first. It smelled of malt and sticky caramel. The taste was surprisingly mild for the malty smell, and full of smoky flavor. It finished with a slight bitterness that only lasted a second. This beer was very light, and very drinkable. I could have easily had more, if only I had more to eat first. It would have gone great with smoked gouda."
"Although I will admit not to be a HUGE fan of this style, I was pleasantly surprised when one of our locals (Monty's Krown Lounge, Rochester, NY) wrangled a host of Victory offerings recently. A very nicely balanced smokiness that fades as the pint goes down. Altogether extremely pleasant quaffing experience. I've been told that authentic German rauches a much more smoky to the point of chewing on charcoal, which is probably why this is not a huge style category, even in the Fatherland. This little tipple is most likely a good entre into the style. I will probably seek out a few more for investigation and experimentation."

"Very clear, reddish beer. Not as smokey as one might expect. The taste seems to mostly come from the hops. Sort of a Hop Devil Lite. Very drinkable and enjoyable. Nuanced. From what I have observed, it's a crowd pleaser. Maybe it's the name but lots of people are attracted to trying it, and they like it, a lot."
"Draught @ Victory's Brewpub. Light copper in color. Not much head. Taste may be a hair lighter than some of their other beers, but this still has a full maltiness, as well as a little smokiness to it. A fine session beer. Another beer to make the trip there worthwhile!"
"Prost!"
