I drank this beer out of a pint glass: it has a deep amber color with a strong head but when put against the light you can see the lightness to it. A very cool color. The smell was amazing: i felt like I was sitting next to a bonfire! However, after finishing half my glass, I was about done. The after taste of burning wood overwhelmed the overal positive taste of the beer, which was moderate at first but then got way too strong. A huge fan of Samuel Adams and their autumn harvest beers, I was disappinted by this. Will be sticking to Octoberfest and Harvest Pumpkin for the fall season from SA.","Eando35","Jul 29, 2013"

The smell of the beer was lightly smoked with I liked. There was enough smoke in there to tell you it's a Rauch but not too much that it makes me wanna gag. The taste was good too I though. Nicely balanced flavors of the malts and the smoke. The flavors weren't salty like some beers in this style. The mouthfeel was pretty typical of Sam Adams, it's a drinkable brew for sure.

Thin mouthfeel. Subdued, watery flavor overall. This was disappointing. Rauchbier is a style I really enjoy but there isn't a whole lot of it out there.

You don't have to search for the tastes as the smoked malts hit the taste buds right away. Has a great body and texture to go along with its unique taste.

The first thing that comes to mind from the aroma is... apple? It smells smokey, like burnt pine, but the fruity smell is really strong. It's medium bodied and pretty smooth. The finish is dry and clean. It tastes smokey and resiny, but it's not over the top. There's a tart flavor that's fruity and malty. The smoke comes later in the taste and lingers through the finish. This is pretty tasty and pretty manly. I approve.","yesyouam","Oct 16, 2011"

The aroma has sweet malt and smoke. The taste start fairly mild almost seemingly light bodied. Then the sweet malt and smoke take over to finish the beer. Bonfire is easy on the pallet and does not linger. Thelower ABV helps to make the beer enjoyable and session worthy. Overall a decent beer.","WoodBrew","Oct 07, 2011"

I haven't had a lot of this style but this seems to be the most user friendly Rauchbier I have had and it would make a good introduction to the style, if this is too smokey for you, then Rauchbier's might not be your style. What I liked most about this beer was the flavor, it was smokey, but not overly so, and the aftertaste was full of caramel malts instead of having that smoke linger in your mouth like I find with most Rauchbiers. What I liked least about this beer was the aroma, it needed more smoke to it, just by a aroma alone it would be hard to pin point that this is a Rauchbier, most Rauchbier let you know what your in for just by the aroma, this one didn't. I will be buying this beer again, I wish I could get it in six packs, but I guess I will have to deal with only being able to get two at a time in the fall mixed pack. I recommend this beer to anyone who wants to give this style a shot, the Rachbier veterans may want a more robust and smokey beer, but if you are just starting off then this is the beer for you. I had no clue what Samuel Adams could do with this style of beer, but I have to say that I am pretty impressed with their effort and I think that this beer will open a lot of people eyes to the wonderful world of Rauchbiers, it would be awesome if they make this available in six packs next year, I know I would keep some in the fridge all fall if I could.","StoutHunter","Sep 29, 2011"

With a smoke beer, I anticipate a potent smokey flavor. Why else would you call it a smoke beer? Bonfire Rauchbier produces a watery fruity taste with disguised hints of the smoke flavor. The mild aftertaste produces the greatest sense of the smokey flavor, but still fails to live up to the standards of other smoke beers. There is a greatest sense of tart fruits than anything else in the flavor. For a rather robust beer style, this is far too mild.","JohnnyHopps","Sep 24, 2011"

Smells like wood smoke, on second wiff it smells more like cheap smoked meat, not off putting but not super appetizing. The smoke smell is found in the taste as well, it dominates a mild hop and medium malt body. Drinks well. Mild carbonation boils finely off of back of tongue, some of the smoke taste makes its way through my nose. Overall an interesting because I am not familiar in the style.

The aroma is full of roasted malts, clove and a nice smokiness. The taste puts the initial smoke in your mouth that fades quickly with a rich molasses and malty notes.

It's certainly no Aecht Shlenkerla, but I would say a great introduction into this style that is probably off-puttiing to non-craft drinkers out there. I am glad that BBC is doing styles like this and I think it really is helping people drink what they normally would not, since more likely than not this will the first rauchbier most people ever try.

3.68,9.9,4,3.5,4,3,3.5,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, the beer pours a chestnut brown coloring that carries a big, puffy, fluffy, chunky yellow-ish head that weighs in around an inch and a half. The nose is sweet and rich, with meat like characters, and a hint of charcoal. The beer has a very unique flavor, and it can best be described (by me, at least) as an all beef hotdog freshly cooked over fire. Wow, very unique. The meaty flavor also coincides with a slightly greasy and slick feel in mouth, which completes the palate picture in my mind. The aftertaste is semisweet and slightly smokey, and the beer finishes quickly, with a slight tangy sweet linger at the back of the tongue. Interesting.","GarthDanielson","Sep 11, 2011"

Pours a crystal-clear amber body with nearly an inch of light tan head that dissipates rather quickly. Smoke and wood dominate the aroma with some malt, nut, and vanilla notes. Wood and smoke dominate the flavor too, with vanilla, nut, and caramel notes in the background. Medium to light in body with moderate carbonation. A fairly easy drinker. I will admit that I am not a huge fan of the style, but this one is balanced and nuanced and doesn't clobber you over the head with the smokiness. An interesting addition to the fall lineup.","MrHurmateeowish","Sep 10, 2011"

This one pours clear mahogany colored with fizzy, bubbly, tan head that dissipates pretty quickly but leaves a solid layer atop the beer. The aroma is malty, lots of bread and caramel. As it opens up the smokiness comes out. It's neither too subtle nor too bold. I've certainly enjoyed smokier offerings but this is a pretty good balance. The flavor is a bit more up front with the smoke. Meaty and earthy, with a touch of malty sweetness. Full bodied, a bit flat as far as carbonation goes though. Something different but tasty for Sam Adams and a good beer for a rich hearty, meal.","goldbot","Sep 10, 2011"

Nice toasted smell to it. Taste is medium bodied, the smokiness really shines through. Reminds me of drinking a nice beer by a campfire and feeling the ashiness (in a good way) of being near the open flame. Good use a tad more flavor, but the mouthfeel and creaminess of it are perfect.

3.8,13.4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"I've been waiting for the Harvest Pack to come out, just so I could try this one. Let's do it: It pours a clear copper topped by a finger of relatively short-lived dirty tan foam. The nose comprises mild hickory-smoked ham, caramel, and a touch of maple syrup and molasses. The taste amps up the smokiness of the ham, whilst still keeping the sweetness of the caramel and maple syrup around in good measures. The smoke becomes darker, more pronounced the further you indulge in this liquid. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a rather lightly syrupy feel. Overall, a nice little rauchbier, not up to the levels of the Germans, but still a generally enjoyable experience.","TMoney2591","Sep 04, 2011"

3.77,12.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Overall: While something of an Americanized take on the style (slightly different smoke character, less malt depth/intensity) this is actually a pretty ballsy little number from BBC. Definitely a nice addition to the fall variety pack!","BedetheVenerable","Sep 02, 2011"

In the flavor, a meaty smoke taste, undertones of caramelized malt and brown sugar. Even balance, mild tea like hops are on the outskirts of flavor town. Not intense, but for those not used to the style I can see it being so. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and thin.

4,19.4,4,4,4,4,4,"O - A very nice Rauchbier. Probably the most approachable and sessionable of the style that I've had.

Black Lager, Pumpkin, Boston Lager, Irish Red, Bonfire, Oktoberfest. Not a bad beer in the variety pack, this just happens to be the new release, pours a deep mahogany ruby tinted brown color with light beige head forming thick and leaving behind intricate lacing. Aroma has a nice air of smoked malts, a bit of charred wood, smoked meat but really compared to some of the German Rauchbiers out their this comes of mild with the smokiness the other elements that come to play included a nice caramel roasted toffee darker malt profile and light herbal hops. Flavor wise this beer is nice especially with smoked meats enough sweetness to balance but rich with smoked malts to add another level of complexity to whatever you're eating. Medium bodied big fall seasonal definitely wouldn't mind pairing this with a bonfire, perfect cooler weather beer too bad it's still August and balmy.

3.97,18.5,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Overall a decent effort, but I could use more of everything. More smoke, more spiciness and a bit more bitterness from the hops, more real malt character instead of the subdued sweetness that poses in its place.","afdempse","Aug 19, 2011"
1.81,-46,3,2,1.5,1.5,2,"This is the shortest review I've written. This beer completely rubbed me the wrong way. The fact that it probably won't rate as the worst beer I've reviewed is a testament to how bad some other beers can be, but this is in no way good. It tastes like campfire hotdogs. Good for hotdogs, bad for beer.","Kooz","Aug 16, 2011"

2.69,-19.7,4,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,"Let me start by saying Sam Adam's Rauchbier is a smoked ale. That being said, it should turn a few people off right away. I'm generally not a fan, but it was in the Fall Harvest pack, and I won't turn away new beer. It's a darker color, not anywhere near porter, but still darker than your usual ale. The first sip tastes of smoked wood immediately followed by heavy malt. The mouthfeel reflects this flavor; very heavy and coats your entire mouth. If you are a fan of the smoke variety, I do expect you will like this, but if you're like me you should let this one ride.","dkoehler42","Aug 13, 2011"

4.12,23,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Overall: Excellent beer overall. While this is my first Rauchbier, I must say this beer is really good. I'd be pleasantly surprised if they get much better than this. I'd say it would be worth getting the Sam Adam's Fall Mix Pack just for this one.","adam42381","Aug 11, 2011"
4.3,28.4,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"D - as a huge fan of rauchbiers, my review is a bit biased. This is definitely one of the better Sam Adams brews in my opinion. They really nailed the traditional rauchbier profile! Considering that we don't get very many smoked beers in my area, I easily welcome this brew!","beeragent","Aug 09, 2011"

3.85,14.9,3,3,4.5,3.5,4,"A style often underrepresented, this beer is an absolute home run. This smokey meaty Rauchebier has all bases covered. Smokey enough to make your eyes water.","HoustonTX","Aug 05, 2011"
