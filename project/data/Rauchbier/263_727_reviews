"This was a fantastic beer. FIrst rauchbier. Looking forward to trying more. They totally nailed all the flavors with this beer."

"Pours a clear, dark brown with a creamy, two-finger head that dissipates to a thin ring, leaving lots of lacing in its passing. The smell is of smoked ham and treacle, roasted malt and caramel. The flavor reflects the aromas in perfect harmony. Moderate carbonation and silken mouth feel round out this classic Marzen based rauchsbier. A very enjoyable experience to be repeated before too long, especially with Surly Smoke now on the shelves."

"O - Not my cup of tea, but an extraordinarily well executed beer, which hits exactly the notes it  promises.  Surprisingly restrained, all told.  Strikes me as having interesting potential for use with a cheese plate or accompanying BBQ."

"Dark brown, clear beer with a heavy smoky aroma. It’s taste is malty with a light hoppy bitterness. The smoke dominates the aroma. Light brown and long lasting head. Light bitter flavor with a long smoky finish. Texture and mouthful is OK and not too watery."
"What can I say?  I have enjoyed this in the summer, winter and fall.  Smokey and enjoyable.  I recommend at least three half liter servings before condeming the nasty smokiness."
""
"Overall: This could be a 'Marmite' beer - you either love it or hate it. Me? I love it - I like smoky things,  and whilst I have beers with smoky elements to the flavour profile (think stouts and so forth) none are as 'complete' as this. It's very much malt (and smoke) driven, so there's nothing much for the hop-heads but even so, it's different enough to be worth a try for anyone."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Was better than I expected - some sweetness in with the smoke.  Just not my favorite style."
"Tastes and smells like barbeque char. Chocolate malt flavor comes through as well. Good stuff."
"Outstanding beer with very good smell and taste"

"O:  again -- wild.  it's got some of that peaty scotch ale thing happening, and the smoke is ever-present, but there's nothing over the top here, either.  the malt offers just enough sweetness to keep it from tasting like a burnt oak log.  a different experience but one worth having."
""
""
""
"16.9 oz. bottle from Cost Plus. Big white head on a ruby brown body. Nose of yeast with a hint of smoke. Mellow smoked wood flavor supported by a pleasant caramel malt body. Flavorful. Incredibly smooth and drinkable - no astringency despite the smoke. The almost dry finish is somewhat crisp and leaves a touch of biscuit like sweetness and a lingering smokiness. Excellent!"
""
""
"Bottle. Pours a dark, clear brown color. Thin tan head. Aroma is thick, smoky and rich. A very sincere peaty aroma combined with a campfire and smoked meatiness. The flavor isn't as intense, and I am appreciative. The peat, campfire and smoky bacon give way to some slight malt and general beer flavor. The body feels fuller because of the scent and flavor intensity. Not much of a Rauchbier lover. This one falls right in line with the rest of them for me. Hey, at least this brewery go full bore and christens you with smokey meat and peat. Don't love it but I suppose I respect it."

"Pours a pretty deep reddish-mahogany in color with a good 2 finger foamy off-white head. Finally settles down to just along the sides of the glass after a good 30 minutes. Some spotty sticky lacing is seen when sipped. The aroma is of smoked roasted malts for the most part. The taste is pretty much the same with a very light hint of caramel malts in the mix also. The smoke is not over done though but it is there. Really no bitter or harsh aftertaste to speak of. Medium-bodied with perfect carbonation. Overall it was different but OK."
"Overall: Another great beer from Schlenkerla, but not as good as the Urbock in my experience. I really enjoy the more pure campfire smoke in the Urbock than the meaty smoke in this one."
""
""
"May be my favorite beer overall.  Surprising since the first time I drank it (at the brewery) I found it, actually, kind of gross.  The smoke is delicious, but not overwhelming.  It has a nice smooth almost creamy feel with a medium body.  This is great paired with German fare, preferably something pork with strong fllavors.  Priceless experience if you can enjoy a liter of it at its source."
""
""
"Delicious. The smoke is well balanced with the sweetness and hops. I was hestitant to try this after other mediocre smoked beers. Back to back with Beau's Rauchstack."
""
"I like smoked food, but I can't handle this."
""
"Didn't care for the aroma of smoked meats."
""
""
"O - A great place to start for anyone wanting to taste a mildly smoky beer. While this is good, I prefer it's stronger cousin, the Rauchbier Urbock."
""
""
""
"O – I have a very hard time with smoked beers / rauchbiers, usually because the smoke component is way too strong and in your face. However, this actually is very balanced, and you can still tell there was a base beer in there somewhere with the caramel sweetness of the marzen.  An excellent version of rauchbier."
""
""
""
"This was my first Rauchbier and I was very impressed. I loved the smokey nature of it and the depth of its flavor."
""
"Like drinking a bonfire. Smoked malts used to make this beer take out all chocolate and malty flavor. Great mouth feel and very unique flavor."
""
""
"This poured a nice clear dark liquid with a dime sized tan head. The nose is smoke, bbq ribs smoke with a hint of malt. The taste is surprisingly less smoky with an earthy quality to it. There is a bit of sweetness that comes through as you let the beer linger. The carbonation also lingers a bit on back of the tongue helping to balance the beverage out. I was expecting a little more smoke but am I happily surprised with how balanced and tasty it is."

""
"They weren't kidding when they classify this as a ""smoked beer"". Drank straight from the bottle, reminded me of smoke kielbasa around a campfire. Pleasant beer to drink. Very crisp and easy to drink beer."

"50 cl bottle (bb 11/2014) into a tulip glass. Clear ruby brown body, medium tan head that settles  down quickly, little lacing. The smell is subtle smoke and sweet malt. The taste starts off with smooth toasted malt, followed by gentle smoke with a hint of coffee, finishing dry with a grassy hop bitterness, leaving an aftertaste of coffee-like bitterness and pleasant smoke. Medium body and carbonation. Overall a pleasant beer specialty, just the right amount of smoke in the taste. Easily drinkable, would have this one again."
""
"Superb."

"Seriously had a ""I want to freeze it in the winter and skate on it. Then thaw it in the spring time and drink it."" moment."
""
""
""
"Tastes of smoked wood and ham, carbonation supports the intense taste very well, piney wood tastes get stronger while the beer warms up. A sweet, crunchy roastiness defines this beer for me. Gets supported by a throughout pleasant malt body, which lets the smoke flavor stand out, both go together very well. Enjoyable, warming finish, whith some salts in it."
""
"A clear step below the Urbock in my opinion. Not as rich or complex; still smoky and tasty nonetheless."
""
""
""
"Pours a lovely dark amber with a distinct dark ruby cast.  Very good head, lacing and retention.  Outstanding nose of meaty bacon like smoke against an underlying dark fruit (plum, fig) note.  Light medium body with a somewhat slick texture. Slightly below normal carbonation with just a touch of effervescence on the finish.  The flavor profile is a masterpiece of intensity, balance and complexity.  The delicious smoke character is always present, but never overpowering.  It begins with campfire bacon like smoke over a slightly sweet background that has dark fruit characteristics.  The middle allows the hops to impart a low level bitterness that has a citric note.  The almost dry finish is somewhat crisp and leaves you with a touch of biscuit like sweetness and a lingering smokiness as if you've sitting around a campfire.  World Class."

"There's a reason this is the classic smoked beer. Utterly delicious."

"Ruby colored with great clarity and a solid 1-finger head. If you're looking for complexity, look elsewhere. This is about one thing and one thing only, the smoke. It's not subtle but it's not overpowering either. Actually quite drinkable and highly enjoyable. Drink this one with some smoked meats or while sitting around a campfire. A really well crafted brew that harnesses the smoke flavor instead of letting it go wild. Do not fear the rauchbier. Embrace the rauchbier."

""
""
"Definitely worth a try.  Smells like the inside of my Weber Smokey Mountain Cooker.  Smoke smell and flavor is NOT subtle at all.  I should be drinking it while eating smoked ribs, a pulled pork sandwich or a bbq chicken pizza.  Note to self:  this needs to be the liquid added in 3 2 1 ribs"

"I had never seen a smoked marzen before finding this. I brew my own smoked marzen on that account. I would highly recommend this beer. I will still beer my own-having one right now to compare the flavor-as it is more cost effective."
"A personal favorite. Love love love!"
"O: Very different and quite tasty. Layers of flavor come out as it warms."
""
"500ml bottle. Pours dark clear brown with a minimal beige head. Has a pleasant barbeque pit smokiness on the nose with some toasted malt and grains underlying on the taste. A medium body on the palate with moderate carbonation. Finishes with a toasted malt, earthy grains with a gentle smoked campfire flavor. A very good drinking and enjoyable brew."
""

""
""
""

"This one, I reckon I could possibly drink another bottle of, back to back. Delightful it is."
"Great beer! Brown color, mid-sized off-white head. Aroma of smoked ham and malt. Taste is similar to aroma with smoked wood notes. Medium body and carbonation. Moderate bitterness in smoked and roasted aftertaste"
"Well crafted beer."
""
""
""
""
"Review based on the BJCP2008 guidelines (style 22A). Bottle 50 cl - Batch LTK. AROMA: very present smoked aroma reminiscent of burnt wood. Very faint malt aroma with no esters and no hop aromas. APPEARANCE: dark ruby color and translucid. rich and creamy tanned head with medium-low retention. TASTE: smoky flavour balanced with a slight sweet malty background. clean lager profile. very low bitterness. finishes medium-dry. PALATE: medium-low body with low carbonation. OVERALL: a nice example of a Bamberg speciality."
""
"Overall, very delicious, characterful, and refreshing. The aroma is especially intriguing, though the flavor is more subtle, particularly after a few sips. On the whole however, I must say that this is a very satisfying and memorable beverage."
"Overall - Really pleasantly surprised with this one. I wouldn't say it's ""sessionable"" unless you really love smoke, as swigging a smoked liquid is pretty odd to me. One was good, maybe I'd do 2, but I don't think I'd want to knock 3-4 of these back. However, it's actually quite light feeling and the smoke never gets overwhelming. This is a masterfully crafted, delicious beer; I truly enjoyed it."
""
"Classic beechwood smoked bier. Effectively crisp and lighter than you'd expect. Tastes like you're eating a steak out of the smoker."

"O: A real gem among Rauchbiers!"

""
""

"Poured a great deep reddish brown into a Pint glass, half finger white head and nice lace. Aroma showed the smoked hops right away with a somewhat malted background, taste was malty sweetness followed by a flow of smokey rich bitterness with each sip. Mouthfeel is medium/light and makes for an easy drink, the smokey waves mellow as it warms and some hops begin to show through with a slight bitterness. Overall this is a very solid beer and one that I'm very glad I picked up!"

"beautiful flavours, great and lingering mouthfeel and a tradition that I hope stays for good. The definition of craft/artisanal beer"
"Overall: For sure one of the most unique beers I have ever tasted, not a huge fan of the style, but from reading the description it really seems to nails it. I think the rating are all over the place for this beer because the style is pretty different and maybe not the most palatable for everyone. I could see this being a very good cheese paring beer though."

"O: Oh God, what an excellent beer. One of the more full and complex lagers out there. Glad to see that a few of the Bamberg breweries are still cranking out traditional smoked beers, and doing a world-class job of it. This is world-beating stuff. An absolute must-try for any serious beer aficionado."

"My first smoked beer. Chestnut in color with a small fizzy white head that disappears quickly. Smokey and meaty in aroma with some freshly tanned leather. Taste is malty with a lingering flavor like bark and grain. Mild bitterness finishes very dry. Mouthfeel is light and watery with medium-low carbonation. An interesting beer. The quality seems fine, but it may take a few of these to develop my palate for them. My first one was not that enjoyable and I have tried most styles."
""
""
""
""
""

"ASR poured an attractive chestnut brown colour with a large, slightly off-white head that lasted for several minutes before fading to a 1/8"" cap of foam, leaving some modest lacing and spotting down the glass. Its aroma was strong and made up of wood smoke and back bacon. The beer's flavour was distinct but somewhat more subtle than its aroma, beginning, continuing and ending with wood smoke, with a mild bitterness noticeable at the finish. Both the smokiness and slight bitterness continued as a long lasting aftertaste. I found the carbonation to be quite moderate but well suited to the beer, and would describe ASR as medium bodied. Though I was a bit nervous at the start due to past experience with a couple of overpowering smoky beers, this was a refreshing change of pace. Not a style that I would drink every week, but a bit of a flashback to a bygone age when all malt for brewing in Germany was dried over a wood fire, and quite reasonably priced at $3.15 per bottle."
""
"O: my first experience with the rauchbier style, though not my first smoked beer. That being said, I have had better smoked beers but overall this was an enjoyable drink. More of a winter or early spring beer than any other time I would think."

""

""

""

"Pours a nice dark brownish red with a decent head that dissipated fairly quickly. Smells smokey of course and the taste is a bit smokey but not nearly as strong it smells. Was a fairly easy beer for me too drink. It's got a lot going on but not so much that it feels too complex. Was a simple beer IMO. I enjoyed it very much but it does take a little getting used to."
""
""
""
"Overall: very good, but not something I will drink often... prefer to share this pint with a friend in the winter months"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Quite literally the best beer I've ever tasted. Smooth, but very very full and rich taste without being overwhelming. The smokey tones really make this beer unique. For those of us that like dark and complex beers, this is an absolutely wonderful experience."

"Overall I thought this was a pretty good beer and a pretty good example of the style, I haven't gotten that Smoked meat flavor in many smoked beersand I thought that it worked well with the campfire smoke aspect and it helped the smoke not wear on the palate. This beer had pretty good drinkability, it was smooth, clean, fairly crisp, not filling, and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, I thought the smoke would start to wear on me, but it doesn't and I think I could drink a couple pints of this but that may be my limit. For some reason I think this would be a nice fall time beer, maybe because of the smokey aspect. What I liked the most about this beer was the balance in the taste, the smoke really showed up, but it wasn't too overpowering and it let some of the nice Marzen flavors come through. What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, there isn't anything that I can of think that would improve this beer, it's good just the way it is. I would buy this beer again when I'm in the mood for the style and I would recommend it to anyone who likes smoked beers. I like the style but in my experience some of them wear on me quickly with the harsher smoke flavor, but this beer kept all aspects pretty balanced and it was more drinkable than i thought it would. This beer made a good first impression for Aecht Schlenkerla, I'll be looking for more of their beer and so far this is my favorite traditional German Rauchbier, Nice job guys, this is one tasty and drinkable Rauchbier, keep up the good work."

"Overall this brew is overhyped in my opinion. Its a work of art, but the scent just destroys it. It smells like piss, I'm sorry but it does. I'm going to try and finish it though, we'll see where my opinion takes me towards the end of it."
""
"Overall- Pretty good beer that is a very good example of the style. Aecht Schlenkerla is definitely where it is at for rauchbiers. Definitely worth a try even if you don't like smoky beers. This is sweet and fruity enough that it might just change your mind."
"The rauchbier had toasty, camp-fire, tobacco tastes and surprisingly medium-body smoothness and it deliciously complemented the smoky fish chowder and salty crackers I ate for dinner."
""
"I didn't even want to have a 6th sip let alone eat something."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is the best German brew ever in my humble opinion. Pours the color of brown sugar, you immediately smell the smoky aroma. Delicious. Mouthful is substantial but not too full. The taste is smoky brown sugar, like a perfectly cured ham. This is my favorite German import, cannot get enough. It is perfection."
""
""
""
"Overall: Sexy bacon beer. Fo real. Try it."

"This is one of my favorite beers, being the premier example of a rauch beer. Easy drinking, almost a session beer."
"- Taste- Smoked meat! Was unable to adequately decipher all of the complex flavors but the smoked meat is what stands out initially. Not too heavy a beer. Each sip I could only describe as ""intriguing"". There is more than a smokey meat flavor and smell but it will take further ""investigation"" for this beginners palate to unravel the intricacies of this beer. Given its history, it is at very least a MUST TRY for any beer lover. It is easy to see how one of these could be enough for a beer drinker, but it is equally easy to see how one could become slave to the uniqueness of this style of beer. I for one have no choice but to delve deeper into the mysteriousness of the flavors and smells of these beers."

""
""
""

"O: Granted this is my first Rauchbier, but this beer is great. Great change up from the normal and the smoked pork flavor is phenomenal !"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The work of masters, this beer is a beer opera of deep emotional taste."
""
""
""
""
""
"Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier's Märzen has the kind of complex flavor profile to which even days of repeated sipping and note-taking couldn't do justice. The addition of roasted malts makes this beer darker than most Märzens, but their presence is perhaps what makes this beer so outstanding. I'll be sure to pick up another bottle next year."
""
""
"Ges. gesch. rauchgeschmack!"
""
""
"Full disclosure...I mentioned I bought this among a few other Marzens around Oktoberfest, but this one was still around only because it just looked like something I wouldn't really like. So it's safe to say I was very pleasantly surprised by the aroma and flavor. Would go great with any smoky gouda, sausage or grilled meat."
""
""
"OVERALL : I've known people who felt the smoke in this brew was overwhelming, but to me it's nearly perfectly balanced. Everything works amazingly well. The smoke attack quickly calms down and the fruit profile slowly begins to dominate, although always leaving a healthy amount of room for the smoke. I haven't had many rauchbiers, but I keep coming back to this one. Great stuff."
""
""
"Overall 4.0: Definitely not for the unadventurous, this beer is unusual and highly rewarding. Smooth, refined and certainly not something that was brewed as a ""one off"" or an experiment, this brew is expertly balanced and just fantastic. It matches perfectly with certain foods: the slight bleu cheese taste led me to try it with bleu cheese and I was very impressed with the results. If you find it and are on the fence, invest the paltry amount of money and try this brew out."

"On tap at Millwright's Tavern in Simsbury, CT. Amber color, but two tone colored, a bit darker toward the top. Thick fine head that settles out slowly and leaves sheets of lace up the sides of the glass. Malty and rich aroma. Rich flavor of biscuit malt laced with peat smoked malt. Good balance, rich and malty with a nice even smokiness. Rich and full mouthfeel. been wanting to try this one for a while, and pleasantly surprised to see it on tap right in my home town. Very good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-This is a really tasty example of the style. The smoke is strong, but it never overpowers things, and provides a nice complex flavor. The flavors are balanced and smooth. Even though the feel is a little soft and heavy, drinkability is high, as well."
""
""
""
"O: an amazing beer. Like a fine bordeaux rather than a big brooding Shiraz or Zin. So much taste and complexity without being aggressive. A recalibration of my tastebuds."
"Look, this is the my first of the style, and if this beer is supposedly as good as others say it is, it will be my last. It pours a nice color with a medium head and very good lacing. The smell is all smoke--so much so that I can barely taste the ""bacon"" and ""meat"" that others rave about. But then again, if I wanted to smell meat, I would buy meat. The taste, in my [maybe naïve and unsophisticated}opinion is drowned out by smokiness. Some reviewers have congratulated this beer for its complexity and for the smoke flavor for being nuanced, but what I find is smokiness that has gotten out of control. I love a beer with some character, and there's nothing more attractive than a beer that compliments both a campfire and a steak at the same time. But this just seems to go too far and in the process loses the complexity that some are convinced that it has."
"O: Amazing beer. My first Rauchbier and I absolutely loved the style. One of the few really great beers I've had in a long time."
""
""
"Recommend to try."
""
""
""
"O- A truly unique beer, yet it manages to be more than just a great aroma. The sweeter aspects of the beer are completely unexpected after the intense smoky nose and ham and bacon hints and this makes the beer all the more impressive. Easily could become a regular beer for me."
""
""
""
""
""
"Smoke dominant, but with enough malty sweetness to counter. Very intriguing flavor profile. Would go great with bbq."
""
""
"This is a perfectly balanced, flavorful beer that makes no apologies for being the cream of the crop. I can't imagine anything making it better, except for possibly getting it fresh at the source, which would be something worth striving for."
""
""
""
""
"A smoked Marzen beer is always an interesting choice, I had to try this one. This pours a medium brown color with a thin head. The aroma has that classic smoked grain smell which always reminds me of bacon. The texture is smooth due to low carbonation. Very unusual flavor not quite sure what to make of this one other than interesting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not as bacon tasting as other Rauchbiers I've had. Pretty good but not something I'd have without food."
""
"Overall a very tasty beer. The smoke flavor is just enough not overpowering. A very tasty brew although an occasional one for me."
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer still impresses me. Rich meaty smokiness that to me palate never gets overwhelming. The only thing I could hope for would be a bit more bitterness on the finish. But otherwise this is a standout, waves of flavour and still really good drinkability, probably not for everyone. I'm a fan of smoked things in general, but the offerings by Schlenkerla take it to a new level. Excellent Rauchbier."

"500mL bottle with an abv of 5.1%. Pours a dark brownish black with over an inch of frothy light tan head. Some lacing. The aroma is nice and smoky. Smells like smoked meat with some smoky malts and burnt wood. Earthy. The taste is a bit more subdued than the aroma. Smoked meat with some burnt wood and beechwood chips. Burnt wood and roasted malts. Earthy and woody but with a good sized amount of malts. Slightly sweet at times. Light but creamy mouthfeel. This is a style I love but can't find a whole lot of. Overall, solid Rauchbier I'll be buying again."
"500 ml. bottle, red - amber colour, with a small off white head with not much retention and a small ring of lace. Smell of smoked salmon domintaing it all in the beginning, with some notes of malts, caramel and toffee later. Light creamy body, taste of smoked salmon, but malts are more noticeable here: toffee, caramel. It will be great of course with a smoked salmon of some other smoked fish, but great too with sausages. Not for everyone's palate (maybe even for mine), but a good beer indeed."

"I was somewhat apprehensive about the smoke in this, as I am fairly new to the whole rauchbier thing, but those fears were allayed as the masters from Bamberg crafted a ride that welcomes you with subtlety and nuance instead of bashing your face in. The background of a stellar märzen (a style I'm not usually that big on), combined with a gently dominant smoke makes this a very good beer and an excellent introduction to the style. I suppose they're the benchmark for a reason"
""
""
"I don't think making a better rauchbier is possible, the smokiness in this beer is amazing and I would love to pair this with some smoked meats."
""
""
""
"O: I'm having a pepperoni, bacon and jalapeno pizza with this beer, and the combination is great! Maybe a little one dimensional to have on it's own, but the lingering smoke flavor melds great with the savory, spicy pizza."
""
""
""
"EDIT - had to revise this yet again, as I revisited and the taste and mouthfeel are great of the style. Just a get beer that is balanced, smoke heavy but never overwhelming."

"I am glad that for my first try I got one of the best examples of the style. I can't say that I would have it again and I can't even finish the bottle. It's strong but not harsh."

"Overall – Quite a tasty Rachbier with a huge smoky nose but yet rather palatable and pleasing blend of flavors beyond just smoke."

"Atmosphere is pretty good. Nice hue, good head, and a little lacing. Roasty and malty and smoky nose. Bacon is prominent. Roasted malt, bitter pecan, all wrapped up in a smoky blanket. Overall, this is a good quaff."

"500 ml bottle into pint glass, no bottle dating. Pours fairly clear medium reddish brown color with a dense 2 finger cream colored head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Dense spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of huge smoked wood, caramel, brown sugar, toast, bacon, ham, light roasted malt, brown bread, and smoked earthiness. Fantastic aromas with very prominent smoke character; with great balance and complexity of malt and smoke notes. Taste of smoked wood, caramel, brown sugar, toast, ham, brown bread, bacon, floral, light roasted malt, light clove, and smoked earthiness. Lingering notes of smoked wood, ham, caramel, brown sugar, toast, light roasted malt, brown bread, and smoke earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of malt and smoked flavors; with nice robustness and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent Rauchbier style! Great balance and complexity of smoke and malt flavors; and very smooth to drink. A highly enjoyable offering."

"On-tap at Brauerei Heller-Trum Schlenkerla on 4/8/2013. .5L served in a willbecker. Pours a deep mahogany with a creamy, 1.5 inch off-white head that settles into a consistent skim leaving delicate curls of lacing as it recedes. Nose is smokey - wood smoke initially, followed by roasted/smoked meat. Taste starts off roasty, with the smoke settling in shortly thereafter; however, there is also a touch of malty sweetness and a slight buttery quality that is nicely integrated into the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is light in body with a slightly watery texture and an even, smooth carbonation and a hint of dryness at the finish. Not my go-to style, but pleasantly quaffable and pairs nicely with quaffable."
""
"This is my frist smoked beer and the smell reminded me of summer bbq. The head was small not to thick whit a nice dark amber color, for it being a smoked beer it was really smoth and crisp very refreshing as well. The flavours were well blance and well rounded the smokines was not overwhaelming."
"Would I buy this beer again? Yes."
"The finish is that of dry, woody charcoal and mild, but earthy hops. If you are a fan of Rauchbiers, this is one of the finest examples of the style."
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours a very dark orangey brown with a slight off-white head of tight knit, small bubbles. The beer’s body is dark but seems clean except for a slight malty haze. On the nose, the beer smells of big bacon and smoked pork, mixed with notes of smoked hickory. On the tongue, the beer tastes of savory smoky malt, faint bitters from the roasted malt, and slight sweet malt. Flavors begin with smoky malts that move quickly into bacon and smoked salmon with a touch of smoky wood. As it warms, some slight dark fruit notes can be detected in the malts. The finish moves into notes of canned cat food mixed with more notes of big bacon. The aftertaste is light salty bacon on the tongue. In the mouth, the beer feels medium to heavy in body, with a smooth carbonation the slips over the tongue, leaving the mouth a little thick with a dry bacon feel with some slight saliva running from the tongue from acidity. Overall, I like this beer. It is a classic rauchbier and fills all the requirements of the style. It does leave a slight cat food flavor in the mouth, which is a little odd as I notice it more and more, but it is still tasty and displays the smoked malts well."

"Very focused on the smoke obviously but lets the other flavors play out. The aroma is much stronger in smoke than the flavor. The aroma has more of a bbq smell, while the taste has more of a smoked grass flavor. Awesome if you like smoked beers."
"Taste is the same..smokey sweet malts. So nice. Its smoked flavor is so smooth and balanced. Glad I revised this. Its awesome."
"My palate has definitely changed over the years, because I really enjoyed this beer."

"Overall, I have to say that I'm seriously relieved. I think this is a beer that pairs better with some pretty strong foods, bbq'ed meat especially. I tried this with a tandoori chicken pizza, and it was great. I would actually try this smoke beer again, which is a first for me, because all the other smoke beers I've had were way too smokey."
""
"Drinkin this with my corn dog Amanda. Dark brown in color with ruby edge and a faint white head. Aroma is pork, smoke, char, light malt. Flavor is same as nose with fruity yeast esters, nice hop balance. Very well balanced. Crispy carbo, light bodied. Very deelish"
""
"When I first started trying new beers, I picked this one up not knowing what it was. I saw a guy walk in to the liquor store, make a bee-line to this beer, grab 4 and leave. I presumed it was good and bought one as well. When I got around to trying it, I hated it! I have definitely matured my palate, because this is an excellent beer, especially for what it is."
"I believe I liked the Urbock a little bit more, although I'd really have to try them back to back just to be sure, and I think I might do that soon. I remember loving the thick and creamy body of the Urbock, and the flavors popped a bit more. This one might have a better nose, though. Either way, both are quintessential examples of the rauchbier style."

"The nose was quite impressive, and a bit intimidating, but it did not translate to the taste. Though that is not to say that taste was a let down, as it was still enjoyable and combined with the mouthfeel, made it easy to drink."
""
""
""
"As strong as the smokey, BBQ scents are the taste is relatively tepid. Smokiness pervades but the meaty flavors are not there. A bit of wateriness strikes the tongue at an in opportune time and smothers the finish. I do like the taste and it finishes easy and refreshing but I had hoped the taste would emulate the scent and it did not."

"Notes: Actually was surprised at how accessible the beer is. I could easily see myself putting down a second in the same sitting, the smoky profile is not palate fatiguing in the least. Great food beer and a must try style IMO."
""
""
""
""
"It pours a dark clear red with a tan head. The head recedes to leave a thin layer of foam that leaves excellent lacing. The aroma is distinctivly smokey, but the malt peaks through at times. The taste is not nearly as intense as the aroma. Malt and dark chocolate eventually fade to reveal a sweet, delicate smoke flavor. The mouthfeel is wonderful. It is surprisingly light bodied, leaving a crisp and clean feeling with low carbonation. Very strange, but very good"

"Another excellent Rauchbier from Aecht Schlenkerla. Has a really nice balance between the Marzen's sweet maltiness and smoke. This is freakin' tasty!"
"Oh yes this is a beer. No telling how many of these I had in my couple days in Bamberg."
"A neat shape-shifter of a beer, this one is - the initial aromatics are so pungent, that I could see lesser mortals turning away at this point. However, if one persists, a more agreeably smoky, malty offering emerges, one that is actually rather drinkable, and even enjoyable. Also, a bit of an appropriate metaphor for tonight's supposed end of the world theatrics."
""
"O: not a beer to be taken lightly, definitely pair with a strong flavored food. amazing late night beer with ass-kicking (but well balanced) smoke flavor."
"O - I loved this, but then again, I really like this style. Definitely the best Rauchbier I have ever had. The American attempts don't hold a candle to this German beast. (I'm looking at you Sam Adams) This is the real deal."
""
""
"O-maybe the best rauchbier i've had. it just has the perfect amount of smoke to it. a lot of rauchbiers i've had were more like novelty beers. you try them when you want to impress your friends with something unique, but not this beer. this is a good beer to sip, or quaff, by the fire on a nice relaxing night. the flavors are complex, but mellow. the smoke is there, not as a punch in the face, but as a nice reminder of all those good times you've had by a nice fire."
""
""
""
""

"O - This is the iconic German example of a style that few make, and even fewer do well. When in the mood I would absolutely get another of this. And the price and availability make that very likely."

""
""
""
"O- I have to admit i just review 3 belgians through out the day and though i was craving any thing but a belgian, i don't think it affected this review. All and all it was a great beer. My only complaint was that it was more like a brown then a marzen. I tasted no sweet malts, as i would expect from a marzen/ocktoberfest. I was very nutty, which taste wise, complemented the smokiness. Style wise forced me to lower the score one this awesome brew."

"An amazing beer!"
""
"Not a good beer at all, this one had such a strange and unusual taste that it wasn't enjoyable at all. It was a hard one to get your head round as it basically tasted like a ham or broth and nothing like a beer for the most part. There was a smoky flavour in there but it wasn't a beer that I liked at all."
"O- this might be my favorite marzen to ever touch my glass... even though this is a rauchbier this really puts a damper on all marzens to touch my lips.... this is a hearty fall/winter beer to keep you warm even though the ABV is low"

"my only regret was not drinking this with my BBQ beef ribs last night, poor timing but great beer. the best brew out of my Advent Calender so far far, not sure if it was worth the 100$ but I'd pay a few bucks to drink another one of these"
"O- medium body and carbonation. A favourite for me, because it is drinkable and unique."
""
""
"Poured into a glass mug. Pours fairly clear dark caramel brown with an off-white head. I can see plenty of bubbles in the beer and along the side of the glass. The head retreats slowly. This beer definitely smells smokey and earthy on the nose. The smokiness in the nose is not overpowering in the flavor. I pick up some of those sweet malts. It's a little earthy. The body is light to medium with moderate carbonation. The finish is fairly clean and the drinkability is high. This is an excellent beer."
""
""
""
"Taste is definitely woody-smoky, with a tinge of sweet malts underneath, just enough around the edges to add some balance. This is a tasty, drinkable, and positively a unique experience that any serious beer advocate needs to try."
""
"The only other Schlenkerla beer I've had is the Urbock and as expected, this one is incredibly similar. First sip is smokey but not as overpowering as the aroma is. It plays the leading role but the sweetness of the malts plays a nice secondary role. Hints of brown sugar and caramel before the inevitableness that is the Schlenkerla savory smoked meat finish. The biggest difference between Märzen and Urbock would be in the body, with the lighter alcohol of the Märzen being noticeable in the mouthfeel."
""
""
""
""
"This brew poured a really dark brown with a one finger white head. The carbonation on the brew was moderate. The nose was exactly what I wanted from a rauchbier…lots of smoke and bacon. And there is absolutely nothing wrong with smoke and bacon. This was a really pungent nose, but one I enjoyed. The taste again is filled with smoke and bacon. There was also a hint of malt in this brew. The one thing that really shocked me on the beer was how thin it was and how mild the carbonation was. A beer with big flavors likes this should really be a little thicker, in my opinion. But, that’s my only complaint. This was also a nice session brew that was really drinkable and unique. I would definitely have this again, but it’s not for the faint of heart."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I am pleased with the beer. It's great for food pairing and it's a great introduction to smoke beers."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Fabulous, especially compared to what rauchbiers I've had so far. Smoke is strong, but nicely compliments other malt flavors in the beer. Most smoked beers I can barely have one of, but I could drink a few of these. Fabulous."
""
""
"O: Pleasantly surprised but ze Germans do all of their beer right. A joy to drink. This style may not be for everybody but it's most likely one of the best offerings."
"O: nice, Bamberg style brew."
""
""
""
""
""
"Nevertheless, of the few that I have tried, this one is by far the best. That thick, smoky flavor gives way to some sweet malts and caramel. The Marzen aspect of the beer definitely comes through a little, but it's smothered in smoked ham. Might go well with some sharp cheddar or BBQ. But putting down 500mL of this alone proves to be a bit more difficult."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Though the friend I'm with doesn't like this beer, since his palate cannot wrap itself around this bold style, I really like it. I will admit that I've only tried Sam Adams' version but as a beer, on itself, it holds up very well"
""
""
"O: If I didn't follow the suggestions of herrburgess and drink this as my first beer of the night, I likely would have gone ""LOL BACON SUX I NO LIEK THIS BEER"" and given it something along the lines of a 2.55 overall. Luckily, I took his word seriously, and the beers I had before helped smooth this out brilliantly. It's one of those beers that works better the more you drink it, allowing me to see it for the incredible beer that it is."
"O: My first venture into rauchbiers was truly unforgettable; what an outstanding beer. I’m not sure how wide the interpretations of this style go, but anything that can beat this in complexity, aroma, and drinkability would be nothing short of superb."

"Best rauchbier ever. My girlfriend and I pick up a bottle every month or two. 5.0"
"This beer is surprisingly drinkable but it almost feels like a gimmick beer were one to forget history. It suffers from being this unique and not having many beers (at least commercially accessible) to compare and establish a referential so the fear of underestimating this beer is present. Nonetheless it's something everyone should try."

"Overall: This beer is a classic for a reason. On its own it's a fun beer to drink and as a beer drinker it is really in the top 20 beers you really -have- to try, but it'd be really great skillfully paired with food or use in preparing BBQ (not with BBQ, but, like in a preparation). For some reason I want pan-seared scallops paired with this to give an overall smokiness to the dish or something like that, where the beer could add that smoke flavour to the food. It's really versatile and if you haven't had it, you really ought to."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Definitely worth seeking out to have at least once."
"O: a good beer, overall. I'm not too familiar with the style, but the super smokey aspects are tasty."
""
"O- Clean and somehow simple beer despite it's peculiar character. Has more to it than the not so complex flavour suggests, in terms of balance, drinkability, pure smoked feel. Briefly: not super tasty, but definitely perfect"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Of all the smoked beers that I've had, this one is definitely the most pure and clean tasting. It reminds me of winters at home."
""
""

"The smell is reminiscent of hickory smoked bacon and has a hint of almonds. Dark, clear amber color and absolutely perfect cream colored head. Low carbonation and balance make this one an easy drinker."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D- as a marzen, it's amazing. As a rauchbier, it's smoked out amazing. I've been wanting to try this one for some time, but honestly didn't expect it to be this good. The smoke isn't so overbearing and without the smoke it would be one of the best marzens in my shiny brown marzen book. Metaphor."
""
""
""
""
"The smoke almost takes over the 10 foot radius around the opened beer. It really hit me when I popped the cap. Its a full hickory, almost oaky smoke. Like BBQ type smoke. The taste is dominated by the smoke. very oaky, and dominated by the wood. Its the tale of an unbalanced rauchbier."
"all in all another smoke beer to fall in love with, though this one may be for those with a more delicate taste."
""
"Review from 5/2011 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Deep hazy, ruby red with a one finger, long lasting head. Smoky sweet malt aroma. Smoky with a light bitter malt start, somewhat dry light malt middle and smoky with a hint of hop finish. Light to medium bodied. Side-by-side with the urboch. The marzen does not show much of its malt body, smokiness is dominant throughout. I like the urbock better because it is more complex. This is a decent, light flavored rauchbier if the urbock is not available."
""
"Overall. This is quite a mild and refreshing beer. Not what I was expecting based on previous smoked beer experiences. Everything seems so ballanced and besides the smoke, other sublte flavours come through. Best of the style so far for this guy."
""
""
"O - Something done very well that I really enjoyed. Totally unique and I would love to try more. It is not something you'd likely session, but it tastes delicious."
""
""
""
"Poured from a brown 16.9 oz. bottle. Has a very dark brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of smoked meats. Taste is unlike anything I have had before. Smoke, bacon, meaty, I can see where it would appeal to some but I was unable to finish it. Feels medium bodied and unpleasant in the mouth and overall I did not enjoy it at all."
"Consumed from an Aecht Schlenkerla pint glass, this makes an excellent choice for relaxing with friends while eating grilled hot dogs on a hot day. Would be awesome while camping or fishing."
""
""
"Mahogany brown in color with deep red hues and good clarity. Pours with a thick, light beige froth that dissipates to a wispy cap but leaves plenty of sticky lacings on the glass. Smells like smoked ham in a glass. Smoke malt aroma dominates throughout. On the heavier side of medium bodied with a silky smooth feel. Smokey flavor throughout but mostly upfront. Bitter hop flavors are introduced thru the middle that transition to a brief toasty, marzen-like maltiness. If smoked is your thing, you'll like this. However, it's not mine."
"O:This is the perfect beer for a single-malt scotch lover. Highly recommended and a must for rauchbier fans"
"O - For the first Rauchbier I try, this beer is really interesting. Flavours are nicely blended, making a very drinkable brew which would pair perfectly with a grilled meet."
""
""
"O: Absolutely delicious. What can I say? This would be perfect with eggs, sausage, and pancakes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I've never had a Smoked or Rauchbier before, but after having this I think I may have fallen in love this style. It's flavors are rich and smooth which compliment it's easy-on-the-palette feel. Plus it tastes like smoked bacon (In a good way!)."
""
"D: I'm not a regular rauchbier drinker but I do enjoy the occasional one, and this is definitely one I'd pick up again. Mellower taste transition from smokey to plums were real pleasing."
""
""
"I have little experience with Rauchbier, but this was definitely interesting. More refreshing than I would have thought. I really got the summer weekend-hotdog association with this beer. Im going to take one of these camping this summer!"
""
""
"D - Nice, but I would tire after 1 or 2."
""
""
""
"I can’t say I’m a huge fan of the smoked Marzen, but this was a very nice taste experience."
""
""
"overall almost a perfect beer for the style i guess when you make rauchbier this long you really can get it down but wow what a fantastic beer"
""
"A rauchbier is one of the most distinct of beer flavors. Aecht does this better than anyone else I know of, and their märzen version can only be challenged by their urbock version for top-of-class in this beer style."
""
"Overall Im glad I was able to find this at a local store, but I won't seek it out again for myself, but probably to share with others."
""
""
""
""
""
"No head smells like beef jerky taste like a campfire or beechwood lingers in the cup as well has a heavy mouthfill it stays in your mouth after a few swallows I wouldn't recommend this beer it has a very bitter taste but the smoke makes it hard to get past anything else the smell hits you right away not a good beer"
"The best smelling beer I have ever smelled in my entire life. It has such a smoked flavor that the aroma can come off as sort of a liquid bacon, ham, smoked salmon, teriyaki chicken smell. Delicious. The taste is less magnificent, but its smokey and does not have a heavy mouthfeel. The brown color is also pleasing to the eye and corresponds nicely with the smell."
"This beer was very surprising to me. It had a smoked smell which I have never smelled in a beer before. That being said, before I drank I did not think it would go down smooth. Surprisingly, this beer went down VERY smooth, and it tasted good, which was very enjoyable. It has a light head and it is a nice dark color."
"Overall: This is a decent beer due in part to the fact that I do not prefer a smoky flavor when it comes to beer. But this smokiness flavor does bring in a lot of complexity when tasting and smelling it because it is out of the ordinary."

"poured this into my tulip and let it sit for a minute and my wife asked if i had smoked summer sausage out! this beer pours out a deep brown ith some ruby highlights. a half finger of creamy off white head slowly settles to a nice ring with little lacing. smell and taste are amazing, both are filled with a nice smoked sausage flavor that is complimented well with a nice body full of malt. mouthfeel is kinda thick and chewy but goes down easy with a soft dry smoky finish. i cant believe it took me so long to try a rauchbier, but i bet it wont be that long before i try another one."
"Overall / Drinkability: Quite drinkable. At first I was a little bit concerned due to the interesting smell (the phenol) but the more I drank, the more I liked it and the more drinkable it became. Went fantastic with pork chops and green beans, and I think would go really well with a variety of other meat dishes. I think that the smoke is just right. Too much and it could really overpower everything, but here - nicely balanced. Prominent, but not domineering. A very good beer overall and again, nicely drinkable."
""
""
"Poured into small German glass bier stein, deep copper hues, but you can't see through it. Two finger head fades to short head, with some lacy stickiness on the side of the glass. Called ""bacon beer' by the Americans in Germany, the first whiff gives on the impression of smoked pork. The smoke definitely comes through in the flavor, dominating the dark beer notes, leaving a bitter taste on the back of the tongue. Not for the faint of heart, but definitely for the adventurous. Probably helps that I just finished a plate of german wurst, noodles and vegetables."
""
""
"One finger light tan head in one glass, minimal head in the other, quick dissipation in both, broken layer of head on former and a small ring around edge of glass in latter. Medium brown clear body, a few streams of bubbles visible rising around the edge of the glass. Holy Smokes (or in the words of John Michaelsen, Good Grief!), smoke bomb on the nose, fairly sweet malts for balance, floral hops absolutely subsumed by the smoky aromas, one of the most unique smelling beers on planet earth. The smoky profile continues taste-wise, more smoky wood than ashtray, fairly sweet in the middle, typical Marzen profile except for the smoke, faint floral hops on backend. Mouthfeel is medium, good effervescence. Not something I could drink all the time, nor finish the entire bottle by myself.Only downside is this beer absolutely trashes your palate, tried to refresh with a DIPA and I still tasted the smoke until halfway through that beer! An absolute must for lovers of smoky beers, the benchmark that all Rauchbiers (along with the Urbock) must be measured against."
"O: If you like smoked/rauch beer, this is it. Great smokey tones go with this incredibly easy drinking marzen, which is medium body and big flavor. Will buy this any time I need a rauchbier fix."
"This is a unique beer. I will pair this one with food next time. If you like it try it again. If you don't at least you can say you have had the world famous rauchbier by Schlenkerla."
""
""
""
""
""
"Well, this is the best smoked beer I have had, easily. It has notes of BBQ, honey-baked ham, and campfire smoke. So if that's your thing, I can't imagine anything better. That said, this beer style is NOT for me, and I am not into this beer at all."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it was my first Rauchbier, so I'm not sure what to say. That being said, it was far too much smoke for me to drink alone. I'm likely to split my other, or to wait to open it until I do some cooking."
"O -- Excellent! Rauchbiers are my new kick and I look forward to enjoying this one often with spicy foods."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Buy it today. Not a six-pack, this one you should savor."

""
"I poured from a bomber into a nonic, dark pour with a medium white head. The aroma is lots of smoke, some saltiness, bacon. A lot of smoke, cured meats, bit of malty sweetness. It finishes with more smoke. The body is full, good carbonation. Not everyday beer, nice change."
"Overall - Very nice, easy to drink beer. Not quite as smokey flavored as i figured judging from the smell. Would be a killer beer to eat meat with or smoke a cigar with. Alcohol is masked very well, its a little pricey but other then that, well done."
""

""

""

"Overall: The body of the beer is light and the finish is really strong. This is one of the better smoke beer I have tried; nonetheless, it is still difficult to drink."
""
"Gettin' back to my smoky roots with one of the first rauchbiers I tried. It pours a clear sunset garnet topped by a finger or so of sandy tan foam. The nose comprises rich, woody, almost barbecue-like smoke hanging like a heavy pall over some sweet, creamy caramel. Good times, indeed. The taste brings some even darker smoke, but beyond that keeps things pretty steady. Smoky indeed! The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a pretty dry finish. Overall, one of the best rauchbiers out there. 'Nuff said."
"Avant garde guys like me should check out Joachim Gies 'Whispering Blue'"
"Drinkability- Smoky, woody, with a balancing malt foundation. This beer has great character and balance and is an incredibly easy drinking beer. The perfect pint for a cold New England fall night."
""
""
"Half litre bottle poured into pint glass. One and a half finger tanned head which went quickly. Dark mahogany colour, clear at the edges, cloudy in the middle. Very distinct smell, was like being in a room full of smoked ham. Strong malty smoked taste. Not too much,going on apart from smoke. Was surprised by the high amount of carbonation."

"Poured from bottle into DFH snifter. Pours a dark brown but transparent color- billowing white head on top, nice retention. Smell- peaty campfire, sweet malts. Nothing overpowering here. Taste- sweet smokiness, maybe a hint of cherry or sweet fruit on the front of the palate. On the end, some roasty bitterness. This is a well balanced, nice beer. I am not generally a fan of rauchbier, but this one is really nice."

"Great beer all around with just the right amount of smokeyness."
"O: A really solid brew I will be getting this again!"
"D: i call this smoke mild, but im sure to most this is still pretty smoky. great balance between smoked and non-smoked malts. the dry finish makes this brew easy for me to revisit."
"Pretty tasty stuff, and definitely a nice change of pace from what I usually drink. I haven't had a lot of smoked beers, but it's not hard to see why this one is so highly acclaimed. I'll probably get this again at some point... except I have never seen it stocked at a local liquor store, so this might be my only bottle for quite a while."
"O: This is what a smoked beer should taste like. The smoke is ever-present but not overwhelming. Obviously not for someone who's not a fan of the rauchbier style, it's by far the best that I've ever had."
"D- I've had these beer on several occasions on-tap and in the bottle but have never rated it. Among Rauchbeers this is the leader of the pack in terms of originality and taste. The beer however is relatively heavy and hard to drink more than a few without feeling weighed-down."
"Well dang-- I remembered this as better than it is now, etc. etc., story we've all heard (and told) before. I've just spoiled myself on the nicest rauchs I can get my hands on, I guess, but the original still stacks up."
"I am really glad I decided to try this again. Now I am wanting to try more rauchbiers and wish more were available."
"All in all, I was glad for the chance to expand the horizon on my journey to learn more about beer. If you've never tried a smoked beer before, it's definitely worthwhile to experience the flavor at least once. However, I would recommend picking up a single bottle to try. While I would partake of a smoked beer again, it's not on my ""must drink again soon"" list."
"Really is an acquired taste and my wife hates this beer (we've been to Bamberg a few times). I am not a smoked bacon guy, nor do I smoke or eat much smoked ham or cheeses, but I do like this beer."
"I enjoyed this beer. I'm not sure I woud want to drink it all the time, but is is unique and very well-made."
"This one and the Urbock are my two favorite from Schlenkerla. I might have to go with this one though. I might be being bias too. I love Marzen and this is an interesting twist. On the other hand the smokiness sort of drowns out some of the traditional Marzen traits. It has a dark brown body with a bit of orange hue. The aroma is not as Marzen like; this is the main thing that takes a backseat to the smokiness in the beer. It has that old smokehouse scent just like all their beers. The taste is meaty and there is subtle sweet roasted malt flavor before the smoke sets in. The body is medium and this is a great heavy meal beer."
"Could be my senses aren't ready for these flavors in a beverage. But in reviewing the style, I think it's a top notch representation. Lots of Smoke & Wood, and not much else."
"wow, like drinking a campfire. pours a slightly transparent deep brown. smells like a scotch ale on steroids, peat smoke? mmmm. extremely intense smoke smell and smoke flavor through and through. on the heavier side of medium bodied, insanely unique beer. never had anything quite like this, could imagine it going amazing with some grilled pork loin. a must try this fall..."
"This was perfect for an afternoon of grilling. The smoke added another level of complexity to the beer along with the good depth and complexity to begin with. This was a really good beer that was very easy to drink"
"Enjoy."
"Poured a clear, dark brown with a fluffy khaki-colored head. Wonderfully smoky aromas mingle with dark German malts, and a distinctive baked brown bread character. Smoke is very nice, walks the line between ""campfire"" and ""meat"" nicely. Taste is quite similar to the nose, the smoke character is delicate and sweet, and compliments the bready malt profile nicely. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, with a touch-over-medium body and good carbonation. I could easily sip on this all day, anytime, but on a cool Fall day? Nothing is better."
"Overall a really nice marriage of two styles, one of my favorite Oktoberfests every year."
"Overall: Great looking beer, the smoke was strong, but not completely overpowering. I'd have another. I was excited to see this on cask."
"Pours a black brownish color which only allows light around the edges with a tan one finger head. The head gives way to gobs of lace up and down the glass. The aroma has a big smoky aroma. The smoke smells like a camp fire with some spice present. The taste follows suit with a caramel malt backbone and then a big smokey flavor. The bbq flavor along with spice and beef jerky become more pronounced. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated. Overall a great beer, nice big smokey aroma and flavor. The beer becomes more enjoyable as you go."
"Pours dark brown with a mocha head that fades fast. Smell has huge smoke with some sweet notes. The smoke flavor is layered, a mix between barbecue and fireplace. The flavor starts somewhat sweet and moves into the smoke flavor which isn't overpowering but still the main focus. The smoke lingers in the aftertaste and stays on the palette. The mouthfeel is medium/light, smooth and enjoyable. Overall a great beer, the smoke was done well with the complex flavor."
"Thinner medium body, higher carbonation, a little watery on the tongue, dryness lingers. Really interesting and tasty smokiness, although the body wasn't great."
"Overall a superior rauchbier."
"Very enjoyable. It was much easier to drink than I expected. I would totally have this again."
"overall - definitely a unique style, and interesting to try. Not so sure I will seek out again though."
"Malty aroma has a fruity and floral overtone and a hint of hickory smoke. It pours a dark, barely translucent brown with a thick, velvety, yellowish tan head that looks a lot like the head on a property poured crater of Guinness. Flavor has malty, fruity, and hickory smoke tones - whoa, is that BACON I taste? There is also just a hint of caramel. Body is a bit lacking, but texture is still fairly fizzy and leaves a tasty finish."
"O: A unique experience as I have never had a smokebeer. Would be a good selection if on a camping trip or enjoying a crisp and cool autumn day."
"A classic representative of the rauchbier style: warm, tangy, and not overpowering."
"OK, this is the Rauchbier others are measured by. Still I think it could gain from a little more hops and forest fire."
"A smoked marzen, perhaps the standard-bearer for the style. It pours a rich, dark brown color with a wonderfully smokey aroma. A big bouquet of smokey goodness that surprises on the palate. It’s not as bold tasting as one might expect, rather the smokiness comes across as mellow and well-balanced. It doesn’t drop out nor does it overpower, rather the notes are there and remain present as it warms much like a mild-tasting Scotch. The carbonation holds up and its effervescence helps the smoke come across. I’m a big fan of smoked beers so count me as a fan of this one."
"Light, but unique. A greater concentration of flavors would improve this for me. The wateriness was disappointing. "
"this was the first smoked beer i have ever drank so it holds a special spot in my heart, but i think i have had better smoked beer. and the smoke flavor seems to be more that of a hardwood rather than a fruit wood."
"the one i've definitely had the most. the easiest to find and in my opinion the meatiest. there is the harvest apple note that makes it have the sweetness of applegate bacon. pour is amber with a very slight off white head. nice built of something much creamier than expected. a benchmark. if i was on a desert island and i had to choose one rauch it would be from this brewery. the only distinct difference is the meat you're suggestively eating with it. this i would say it just right for chinese bbq pork. light sweet... like grain savory. mineral smoke dry."
"Overall: If you haven’t had a Schlenkerla Rauchbier, you need to. Period. End of sentence. Fin. That’s all folks."
"Overall a very smoky and interesting beer. I enjoy it a lot, but it is not for everyone"
"O: I was blown away by this when I had it almost 10 months ago, but now that I've had it a few more times and delved into the style a bit, I'm sure this is top notch."
"O: Overall, quite tasty. It may be a little overpowering on the smokey side, but it is delicious none the less. Perhaps a good introduction to the style, but I don't think I'd be too likely to have a few in a row. Maybe one of two, but I'd stop there."
"From a bottle, pours a clear dark burgundy with a nice head. Nose is smoked meat tending toward ham, salt pork, not so much bacon in this case. Salty and light, pleasant. Mouth is soft, smoked ham, very light somehow, airy. I picture cubed hunks of artisan ham here. Yep, artisan ham. Fluffy with an appropriate bittering hop near the finish. Dry. Nice stuff."
"O - Very satisfying to nurse at home on a cold night. Very similar to the Urbock in every way to my palate and like the Urbock, is pretty unforgettable."
"Overall: Smoked beers; you hate them, or you like them. We had a tasting with 4 people, I was the only one that didn’t drain-pour this one. One of the better ones on the market!"
"O: Really nice beer. This is the first true Rauchbier i've had and it was really good. T He only thing I can say is that the mouthfeel is a little thin after that huge campfire scent. Its not bad, just thought I would get something bigger. However, I can't really judge as I am new to the style."
"D-I like that this Rauchbier/smoked beer isn't overwhelmingly rich; I find this really aids the drinkability as the smoke qualities bring in a richness of their own"
"It was a little thin, but a nice warmth and dry finish. Overall it was delicious. This is a sipper to enjoy with a smokey meal. Perhaps a meatlovers pizza?"
"Overall a very nice Rauchbier with solid smoke taste, and pretty affordable to boot."
"This brew pours a deep mahogany hue with average carbonation that leaves behind an one finger head and sporadic lacing,the smell is WOW straight out smokey woodfire and crispy burnt bacon,it has a medium bodied very drinkable mouthfeel with tastes of burnt bacon,smoked wood,candied fruits and finishes with a pleasant spicy hop dryness and overall a beautiful example of the style and truly tasty would buy again."
"D: While I really like this beer, I would think drinking more than one in a session would be detrimental to my palate and might destroy my ability to taste anything else while enjoying multiples of this beer."
"O: The aroma is so overpowering it almost makes you not want to drink more. But when you force yourself to drink more its amazing. Like it for the experience but hate it for more than a once a year beer."
"EDIT: I will have to admit that this has grown on me a little since my visit. I still prefer the one from Spezial, and wish I could get it more readily, but this is still a beer I randomly crave here and there. The bottled version still has more smoke than the draft one, but it's tasty nonetheless."
"T:"
"One quick note on pairing. I would NOT pair this beer with smoked foods (i.e., pulled pork, briscut or cheese)! It is impossible to appreciate the smoke character when paired with smoked foods. I was at the American Royal in KC last year and decided to bring both the Aecht Urbock and Marzen to taste with some smoked pork shoulder a buddy of mine was entering. The shoulder ran roughshod over the beer. The beers both tasted like above average dark German lagers. Just my two cents."
"Pours a clear dark brown with a 1 inch light tan head that fades to a thin cap. Thin rings of lace and random splotches of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smells of smoked meats, campfire, and band-aids. Taste is of smoked sausages, liquid smoke, band-aids, and roasted malts on the finish. The bitter smoke flavors fade quickly after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very interesting beer. This is the first of the style that I have had and it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. I would try other rauchbiers in the future."
"Poured from a 500 ml bottle. A dark brown brew with a sizable head and some lace sticking to the glass. Aroma of most delicious bbq meat and smoke, obviously from the beechwood smoked malts. A lush caramel underbody is a great palate for the smoke to dance on. Malty, roasty, smokey, fantastic. Kind of tastes like how a dying fire smells. There is a subtle malt sweetness that works with the smoke. Malt comes off roasted, a seperate flavor from the smoke. Hops are lightly bitter, but barely percievable until the finish. There is a lingering smoked meat flavor that sticks with you as it sticks to the beer. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, carbonation is about right, moderate. Overall, a great Rauch, epitomizes the style. Went well with grilled steak quesadillas and smoked poblano salsa."
"The ""Marzen"" nuances may very well get lost here, but so what."
"O: A very nice rauchbeir, though I was done about half through the glass. As I drank on, the smoke seemed develop a more chemical-like aspect to it which hindered the drinkability a bit."
"In short: a sweet, Vienna-type malt based beer with bacon-like smoke character."
"Pours very dark amber/red with a fluffy 2.5 fingers of tannish head. Lace was ample. Out the gate theres a huge smoke presence; open camp fire, cooking a whole sh*t load of bacon. It's smoky like that. There's a subtle nutty, malt aroma in the back. That smokiness carries over abundantly into the taste. There's a bit of a spicy, bready note in there, and after the smoke clears, theres a rich maltiness in the back fighting for stage presence. The lesser side of this is the feel...bit to far on the light end of things. Overall though, solid Rauchbier, though probably my least favorite so far of the Aecht Schlenkerla Rauch's."
"Deep brown, ruby tones in the light, 2 fingers of off white head, some lacing on the glass. Smell is of BBQ, campfire smoke, bacon, smoked malt, lots of smoke here bottom line. Taste is smokey, wood, campfire like, bacon/ham, lightly bitter in the aftertaste. Light to medium weight, nice light carbonation, good feel. Great brew, awesome with bbq meat and cheese or any type of food really"
"This brew poured out as a brown color, there was a decent head at first but went away quickly. The smell of the beer is a super smokey, It was like being near a fire or something. The taste brought the same smoked strength onto the tongue for a salty bacon-like experience. The mouthfeel was pretty smooth though and was drinkable enough to finish my glass. The beer overall isn't really my favorite style. I think sometimes the smoke is too much and it hinders the brew. I try to give each of these a fair chance."
"O/D - Smoother than you'd think. Not exactly a warm summer patio beer but it has its place and for such a rare style, it seems well put together."
"D: It's hard to gauge how easy this is to drink. On one hand, it's a bit of an acquired taste as is usual for the style; on the other, it's superbly balanced with a nuanced flavour profile. With that said, it's unquestionably worth buying if only for the experience, and an excellent Rauchbier altogether."
"overall quite fine, an excellent beer with interesting and delicious smoke flavor"
"This by far is the best Rauchbeer I've ever had. A true example of brewing finness."
"This is a man's beer."
"( 38/50, 5.1% alc/vol, Home) Beautiful red with a slight hue of brownish orange at the bottom. Deep and somewhat clouded by suspended sediment. Traces of yeast still in the glass. Head is sticky, brown and laces nicely. No carbonation to be seen though. For a beer that has been sitting in my fridge for a year, it smells awesome. No trace of the dreaded cardboard oxydation. Then again, it smells so powerfully of smoked ham, riverbed rocks, some oak and firewood that even age cannot surely harm it. The flavours of firewood last forever. You drink this and immediately remember those camping nights, the hot rock stoves of scandinavian baths and the warm plates of bavarian ham. Smoked flavours, oak, finesse. The age has served this beer extremely well. Taken down a notch, this smoked beer is actually very easy to drink. Not too complex, but still very nuanced. Cold, somewhat inactive drink. Not too sure about this one as a winter beer. Glides very well and does not linger too long. Apart, of course, of the burnt firewood, ashes on rock texture that lingers forever. Medium to thick ashen body. Mostly lifeless though. As far as rauchbier goes, this aged version of schlenkerla's marzen is impossibly beautiful, fine, nuanced and full of rock-smokey firewood. Not too harsh nor lasting, it dies nicely, and timely due to age. Not meant to be this soft, but I love it even more this way."
"Served from bottle into a Spaten Optimator dimpled mug. Poured a deep reddish brown with a half finger off-white that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, smoke, ham, and pork. The flavor was of roasted malt, smoke, ham, pork, and slight bacon. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty nice brew. Definitely had a great smoked meat flavor aspect going on in this one. I really needed to have BBQ with this brew. It would have made me appreciate it soooo much more. Seems like all of the Rauchbiers I've had lately make me want BBQ. Maybe it is a sign... Great flavor and aroma going on here. A definite must try for any Rauchbier fan or smoked meat fan out there without a doubt!"
"O- You know, it's just not my thing, but I've graded this one with style in mind as I feel like this is a pretty good example, if you read up on what the style is about. If rauchbiers are your thing, this one probably ranks up there. Good for the style (other than the mouthfeel was a letdown), and a good enough experience I guess."
"O=This is great, I'm glad it is readily available where I live"
"Could be the difference in my preference b/w weizen and marzen (I like weizen beers better and liked it better overall). Good taste and aroma, I'm a bit bothered by the lingering hop grassy taste at the finish."
"O - This has good drinkability. This is my first rauchbier, and I have to admit, I was a little nervous to try it. It is definitely a very interesting beer. It has a nice smokiness that I thought worked really well with the toasted malt background. I could definitely see this one pairing really well with food. I am looking forward to trying more beers of this style, and I would definitely drink this one again."
"Drinkability: awesome and great for pairing with foods"
"O- Highly drinkable and absolutely delicious. Drinking this beer really puts you in the mood for a barbecue. This beer is all about the smoke and it's always nice to see a beer really focus on one simple characteristic and do it perfectly"
"Drinkability: One amazing beer that must be had by all beer lovers. I know alot of people don't like smoke beers but this may be the one that turns there opinion around. Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier is the most authentic of any Rauchbier's I've ever had. It's smooth, smokey, and easy to sip. I've yet to try this with some smoked BBQ but I can imagine it is amazing. Very glad I tried this and look forward to trying many more beers from the cellars of Schlenkerla in Bamberg."
"O: Probably my favorite from the brewery."
"Pours pretty dark, good amount of head. Smells malty and pretty smoky. Tasting it tastes like a bonfire in my mouth, its very smokey no joke. Not bad either but its kind of boring its just a TON of smoke with some malts and it feels like it could use some other kick. Otherwise glad I bought this beer."
"O: This wasn't as bad as I had remembered it being, but I still wouldn't drink more than a few ounces of it."
"I can't think of a better beer for a barbecue. Pairs amazingly."
"O: A very interesting and unique beer. Much more palatable than anticipated. Successfully fills both roles as a rauchbier and a marzen. Probably not a favorite, but would have again."
"O- Overall it was not very enjoyable to drink at least for me. Felt like I was drinking bacon juice."
"Drinkability is ok. Based on the smell alone, I thought this was going to be much worse, but the smokiness in the flavor, although powerful, is well-balanced with the rest of the flavors."
"I liked the beer, and I want to try it again with some German sausage or roast saurbraaten. I just don't want a splinter from all the charred wook making this (just a joke, that isn't possible)."
"Overall on tap or in the bottle this beer just delivers in spades. Super drinkable and just meets expectations in feel all around."
"Poured a clear medium brown with an average sized off-white creamy head that was mostly lasting and had fair lacing. The aroma was of smoked malts a moldy yeast with a heavy note of smoke and meat (Like a smoked ham). It tasted a little acidic that had a mild malt flavor and an intense smokey flavor from start to finish with the flavor lingering on the taste buds for a long while. Mouthfeel was light to medium in body and watery yet creamy in texture with a soft carbonation. Overall a very different brew than what I am used to, kind of like drinking liquid smoke. Not all beers are for everyone and this one is definitely not for me!!"
"Very impressed with my first smoked beer and did not allow personal tastes to shy me away. Not very thirst quenching nor crisp in the least bit but agree that this should be paired with fatty foods, maybe meats but i enjoyed half of it before some crispy chicken artichoke pizza made it all the better. I will buy this again as a treat or to break someone else into smoke beers."
"This is a surprisingly drinkable beer that may be a bit of an acquired taste. I think it would be best paired with some smoked meats (turkey butts or something) and you could maybe even make it a night with some rice and things."
"I expected a 2 x 4 of smoke to the head but what this beer gave me was more subtle, clean and light than expected. Sometimes less is more."
"This is a fantastically crafted smoke beer. Pretty tasty on its own, but it pairs phenomenally with so many foods-a great beer to have on hand at all times."
"M/D: The mouth feel is a bit watery although nice and coating. No alcohol flavor with a nice mixture of sweet and smoky bitterness. The smoke intermingles perfectly with the light bittering hops and sweet base. This is the best smoked beer I've tried so far. The smoke flavors don't muddle the beer and instead refine it to a nicely balanced sweet and smoky experience."
"Fairly easygoing and drinkable with a low ABV at 5.1%, although the beer is not something I would pick for a session. I would drink this again, and would be curious to see how it pairs with food."
"I was supprised at how good this beer tasted. Not only was this my first BA review, this was my first Rauchbier and I'll admit to being a bit intimidated by the ""smokebeer"" label. The smokey characteristics are quite subtle, and lend themselves to a fine brew."
"Given the circumstances, I would happily drink a boatload."
"D: Highly drinkable. I presume your tastebuds slowly acclimate to the smokiness and after one of these, the next would become more highly drinkable."
"D: One of my favorite beers probably because the smokiness aromas and flavors drive me crazy. Overall, the beer makes my mouth water and then settles in quite nicely and pairs well with cheese such as gouda."
"This is a good beer, great with wings, smokiness is almost overwhelming. Tasty treat but not an every day drinker"
"Poured from 12 oz bottle into a tulip glass. Pours a thin beige head, over a clear reddish brown black body. Aroma is primarily smoke, with a bit of grilled meat, and sweet malts. Taste initially is toffee, then balanced by smoke and then mild hop bitterness Mouthfeel is relatively light, carbonation low. Smoked beers are interestingly different from each other. This one is a campfire in a glass. Can't stay this is my style of beer."
"D: Very easy to drink. Could go very well with barbecue food."
"Drinkability: nicely drinkable beer that goes perfectly with BBQ. Easy to quaff this beer."
"500 ml bottle. Served in a mug, the beer pours a clear ruby red/brown color with a couple inch frothy off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both pretty good. Aroma is mostly smoked meat/bacon, and some bready malt. Taste is pretty much the same as the aroma, it's mostly smoked meat and some roasted malt. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a little bit coating with decent carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, it's very smooth and easy to drink. This is one of the better rauchbiers I've tried, and would definitely buy this again. I thought it was a pretty good brew, I loved the smokiness in both the taste and aroma."
"Pours a dark brown/mahoghany, clear with a few fingers of eggshell head which leaves some good lace and moderate retention. Couldn't imagine how that could be improved, great look to it. Nose is smoked everything: ham, sausage and meats of all kinds. Barbecue-esque, with an underlying caramel sweetness of some sort to complement. Taste is smoke from the get-go, rich malts, barbecued and smoked meats on the palate are adequate but not extensive and overpowering. Smoke still in the finish, solid feel to it and I'd definitely have another. Can't wait for barbecue season to roll around, the pairings I'm coming up with as I drink this are driving me nuts."
"Overall this is a wonderful beer on every level. The look, smell and taste all come together to make you feel right at home in Bavaria - even when you´re thousands of miles away."
"D: This brewery sets the bar for rauchbiers. When I have a hankering for a rauchbier, Schlenkerla brews are the first thing that comes to mind."
"Based on the smell, i was expecting more ""in your face"" smoky flavor, but was I WRONG. There is no smokiness at all in the flavor, and it is surprisingly very smooth and clean. a beautiful beer."
"D: I would like to do some food pairings with this but I don't really care for it by itself."
"Drink - Well, I gave it a shot. This is definitely not the style of beer for me. I see that others have mentioned how well this beer compliments certain foods.. but to me, this beer is a food on its own. It actually tasted like meat. I tried to get through the bottle but unfortunately I had to drain pour. I even had to break out my last Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale just to cleanse my palette."
"Overall for the style, excellent beer and would drink again."
"I have to think that drinking more than a pint of this beer in one sitting is difficult for anyone and the flavors are so powerful."
"I am fond of Smoked beers. This one is a treat as a once in a while thing but too Bacon heavy for regular drinking....that and I like to find the BEER in my glass so going TOO Bacon or Coffee,or Grapefruit, or Bourbon,and losing the beerness,is not ideal"
"I am utterly shocked at how well this drinks. I will have zero problem finishing this bottle alone. The flavor is perfect and the smoke does not overwhelm at all. This is top notch for the style and easy to drink to boot. Great beer that everyone needs to try at least once."
"Pours a murky brown colour with hints of amber. Thick white head, with some nice lacing. Really nice head retention. Smells quite smokey, almost similar to the smoke from bacon, so any beer that reminds me of bacon is a plus. I believe the other stuff I'm smelling is similar to salty caramel. Flavour has some sweetness, but the aftertaste is quite smokey. Smooth carbonation level. I'm really enjoying this beer now."
"Note: 5.1%"
"Seriously, if you ever have the opportunity to try this beer do not hesitate. Extremely tasty, amazing smell, and it even looks good to boot!"
"This pours a very dark brown with a thick head and lots of lacing. The first thing I noticed was the heavy smoked scent. I immediately got excited because I love that smell and I couldn't wait to taste how it would translate into a beer. I was not let down! There was a heavy, yet not overpowering (in my opinion) taste of smokiness. It blended well with the maltiness of the underlying beer and the hit of hops in the background. It isn't something I would drink every day, but I have had a couple since my first taste."
"Among the 6 other taste testers on the beer in my group, I was the only one that enjoyed it: and boy did I ever- ranked as one of my all time favorites it has an outstanding smell, the initial taste is an earth shaker. If you like smoky flavor- please don't die before you sample this. Outstanding from start to finish- I can't rain enough accolades on this gem."
"This is one of the first rauchbiers that I tasted, and remains one of my favorite. Pours a dark ruby with low head retention. Smells like campfire with a subtle malt background. Tastes like bacon! Mouthfeel is perfectly smooth. Really one of my favorite German beers."
"D - Excellent. Easy to drink and hits the Rauchbier notes perfectly (it is the original apparently)."
"Drinkability - Wow - the beech wood smoke is absolutely awesome. Unfortunately, the Marzen beer style is too bland for me personally. I guess that is what makes this beer so awesome - wonderful beech wood smoke in a beer style that let's the smoke be the highlight."
"D: Good beer for times when longing for the outdoors, childhood memories and for occassional novelty beer. Nice, nice beer. Not among the top of the smoke beers IMO. Although, having been to Geramany, the rauchbier's are much better there."
"Overall this is a decent enough beer, but not one that I would really feel the desire to drink again."
"I liked it but apparently no one else I was with could really appreciate this one. Pours inky black with a tall, white head that lingers. The smell is indeed smokey. It almost seems like the smell is ridiculously strong, since my friend across our small table said he could smell smoke when I poured this brew. In reality, it was malty and smokey, and the taste was much the same. Smoke is the dominant thing here, people. If you somehow came upon this brew and were unaware that this was a large component of the beer, you would completely thrown, I think. To be honest, several hours afterward, I would ""taste"" the smoke smell in the back of my throat. It has a smooth mouthfeel, but due to the unusual experience with the overwhelming smoke-quality, I'd say it's not an easy beer to drink. I'd order it again, but it absolutely scared my friends off and would not recommend it to people who are not used to strong and/or odd beers."
"TRY THIS BEER IF YOU LIKE MARZENs or SMOKED BEERS!!!!"
"D: Pretty easily drinkable, especially if you like smokey brews."
"500 ml bottle. Pours chestnut with a big, fluffy, off-white, long lasting head. Lots of lacing. Aroma is rich smoked (lox) malt with hints of piny hops. Medium, smooth body. The flavor is initially a sweet smoky malt, brown sugar balanced by earthy, piny hops. Long lasting, balanced finish. Great beer."
"Wow a three finger head of light brown head with lots of clinging lace. Color is a 28 on the SRM chart. Smell of smoke, chocolate, coffee, and fruit. Taste of chocolate, smoked fish, coffee, caramel, and malt. Very rich and full in my mouth, a great creamy texture. Very fine flavor and really fills my sense with pleasure, I will have to pick up more my next beer buying adventure."
"Pretty big and sweet for a Marzen. For such a non-traditional (or more traditional, actually) beer, spectacularly balanced, layered and drinkable. I've forgotten the smoke by the 3rd sip. Is this the best smoked beer out there?"
"The body is comfortably weighted and moderately carbonated. Very smooth tastes and soft spice notes in the finish. The smokey bacon, roasted honey and fried pork fat flavors that dominate the aroma is one thing but the smooth translation from nose to the taste and the smooth finish brings this beer together very nicely."
"Poured into a Spaten 0.5l mug. Served at cellar temp. Fizzy carbonation, sounds like soda, and the brown body looks like root beer. Smell is probably the most unique you'll find in a bottle. It reminds me of a smoldering campfire, or a smoked ham at Easter. Just wonderful; anything smoked is just plain better. Taste is a bit more subtle than the nose would portray. Lots of notes of bacon, wood, peat, and ash. Also, this beer is not very chewy, as it is quite smooth on the palate. It became a bit more mellow as it warmed to room temp. Granted, I like this beer a lot, but it's not one to drink several at a time. The smell and flavor could be overpowering if you are not in the right mood. But one bottle is a perfect size to enjoy. I dare you to find a better made rauchbier. There is a reason this one is called the original."
"I was not expecting to like this beer so much. Really delicious. I served it warm as I am currently freezing my ass off. I was anticipating liquid smoke, as in tremendously oversmoked. But actually it has delectable smoky tones to the beer. camp fire ashey wood flavors. A wonderful base beer under the rauch flavor. It would have been successful beer regardless of the smoked malt addition. Caramel dark malt character. Good germen yeast with what tastes like a perfect fermentation. would definitely have another sometime."
"Great beer for the style. Easy drinker although I might tire of the smoke after a few. Well worth a try."
"CHEERS!!"
"Wow I really like this. Awesome beer for the style. Much smokies and bacon-like than Mikeller Beer Geek Bacon."
"Drinks: easily, despite the potent flavor and aroma. Schlenkerla has long been my favorite rauchbier for the simple fact that they do it better than anyone else. No other brewer can deliver the complexity and the pure, unadulterated liquid smokiness and drinkability I find in these."
"Overall, this is an excellent beer. I recently read about this beer and its history in Brew magazine and read of this bacon flavor. I just figured, ""sure it's maybe a hint of bacon."" But no, this is more of a dominant characteristic of the beer. As much as I enjoyed this, I can't say this will be a frequented beer by me. This might be something saved for special occasions during the winter time. Overall, I highly recommend trying this one."
"D - Just flat out amazing taste!! It just doesnt get any better than this as far as rauchbiers go. Full flavor, body and aroma. Its all here. Highly sessionable. I really wish Texas would start importing this."
"Pours a dark, clear, brown ruby colour with a good amount of head in the Samuel Smith pint glass. A lot of smoke flavours as one would guess with this beer. A good malty finish to go along with the smoked flavours. Drinks down pretty smooth and the smoke isn't overpowering at all as I was worried about. Decent beer."
"D: This is a smoked beer that is not over the top smoke to the point that it would not be enjoyable. Good example of the style."
"This beer is exceptionally beautiful to pour. It's a dark mahogany with ruby tints and a pillowy off-white head which lasts throughout most of the beer. The smell is fantastic, predominated by smoke-cured meats, caramel and a faint hint of graininess. The taste is very good. Smoke-cured meats predominates but is not overpowering. Also present are caramel and toasted grains with a hint of sweet maltiness. This is a very well crafted rauchbier. The mouthfeel is spot-on, but drinkability, well, it ""is what it is"". I prefer this beer solo without food and when I drink it, one is enough."
"Drink well my friends."
"The mouthfeel was smooth, but not overly carbonated. As for drinkability, I can't see myself having more than one at the moment. The smoke seems to be a touch overpowering, but I would definitely try this beer and again other rauchbiers for that matter."
"Pours a clean deep copper color with a light tan head. In the aroma, smokey, woody, and a mixture of beef and pork. In the taste, light smokey wood, like a nice dry campfire. A smooth ad medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry, faint campfire aftertaste. It is like drinking next to a campfire with a small fruit hint."
"D - Smoke really dominates every aspect of this beer. While I enjoy a well-balanced smoked porter like Alaskan, I felt that the malts are too smoked and burnt for a Marzen."
"Very very tasty, like Highland Park scotch in beer form."
"Taste: A little smoke caramel malts and hops at first. The malt and hops subside and the smoke really shines in the aftertaste."
"D: This was my first Rauchbier, and it didn't disappoint!"
"Pours a moderately dark copper color with an off white head. The nose brings smoke, smoke, and smoke. Smoked wood chips and a bit of char; almost meaty. The taste confirms this latter scent, as this really starts to taste like bacon that's been a tad bit overdone. Mouthfeel is nice and smoky with a pleasant finish. Considering what it is, this drinks really well."
"D - It's a delicious high quality beer but I can only drink one in a sitting."
"DB- A lighter smoked beer. I would like a bit more smokey malt but still enjoyed it."
"I want more, fantastic beer which rarely gets better."
"Pours a clear, dark amber color. 5/4 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of strong smoke, sweet malt, and slight roasted malt. Fits the style of a Rauchbier. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of strong smoke, slight roasted malt, sweet malt, slight yeast, and a hint of hop. Overall, good appearance, aroma, and body."
"This is the beer that saved smoke beer for me. Instead of smelling just like a lit fireworks punk like the first sample in this case the smoke balances with other smells and flavors. Taste-wise I'm getting bacon and smoked cheeses. Although I wouldn't want this every night I pretty much enjoyed the Marzen. A unique and quality product."
"Mouthfeel is very creamy and medium-bodied. Basically almost finished with my pint as I complete this review. What an example of the rauchbier style, especially as my first. Officially my new favorite German beer. Gonna keep this beer in mind for any upcoming bbq's- damn."
"The smell was great, taste was good, I wish it was more smoky, harsh and thick, but it is what it is. I question the freshness coming from the dusty ol import shelves. On the expensive side for a German import, still stoked to try the other ones."
"I guess this is what rauchbiers are like. I generally like smoked things, but the combination of the smoked meats with the sweetness got to be too much for me quickly. Very interesting, but I didn't find it very drinkable."
"A very intriguing beer and one I'd like to try again, and/or other examples of this unique style. I think I'll be revisiting this beer as the colder months approach."
"I really didin't think I could drink this smoked stuff but when consumed in the context of this ancient restuarant in this really neat medieval town, I was hooked."
"Yes it is drinkable, but the excitement would be gone as the flavors disappear the further you get into it as it is difficult for the palate to keep up the characteristic identification of your initial sips. I would recommend 1 at a time."
"Brownish red with one finger head, quickly fading. Aroma is malty with overtone of smoked meats. Opens with sweet, caramel maltiness; spicy hops bitterness at the back; smoke on the edges of the aftertaste. Medium body, decent carbonation. Easy to drink."
"D: Good drinkability, though I might personally be worn out by the burnt malt/wood finish after a few. Still, a solid, well made beer."
"Creamy carbonation could be upped a little."
"I must say that if your in the mood for smoke nothing hits the spot like a Schlenkerla."
"D - Goes down pretty easy, but the flavor is so overpowering and strong that I can't see myself wanting a second. Not a bad thing, just don't let the 5% ABV make you think you're going to session this. A great example of the style and an enjoyable beer all around."
"D- I definitely want to try this one again, as I previously tried their weizen and I was a big fan. Not sure I'd do multiple smoked beers in an evening as the flavor profile is pretty strong and I'd be satisfied with 1."
"D - Really not that hard to drink, it makes for a great marinade as well as pairing with grilled food. I like it a lot for what it is but again, it's pretty one-dimensional."
"Medium-bodied and very drinkable."
"This one needs a second review!"
"This is probably the most interesting beer I've ever had. To be honest, I didn't care for it much the first time around (mostly because of poor food-pairing). The second and subsequent tastings have been more rewarding. Give it a chance."
"Drinkability: Strangely alluring. Wasn't completely sure about this beer for the first half, but then I just wanted more and more."
"It can be hard to pair this marzen with food, but it can also be easy. Richly smoked cheeses, roast beef, ribs, pulled pork sandwiches, fried potatoes, and absolutely anything barbecued is a natural match for this magnificent beer. No doubt, it is one of my favorites, and will always have a place in my fridge."
"On-tap at Redlight Redlight in Orlando, FL. Pours a dark brownish color with a light tan head. The aroma is fantastic! A lot of smoked malts dominate the nose. The taste like the aroma is deliciously smokey! This beer is great in the bottle and even better on-tap!"
"D-very interesting beer, quite smoked and meaty but enough balance to it that is seems to work very well together and be enjoyable. Plus, after the onslought of acidity and vinegar of La Folie 05 there was a need for malt!"
"Drinkability: This is damn good stuff. Very unique and very tasty. I was unsure how I would react to the smoky qualities and the bacon (and not because I'm a vegetarian), and I'm pleased to say I thoroughly enjoyed both."
"Notes: Overall it's an interesting beer but its not one that I could see myself drinking much of."
"D: overall marzen style is very drinkable, strong smoke makes for a good grilling brew"
"This was poured into a Weihenstephan glass with about two and a half fingers of light tan head atop a black body. It smells very strongly of smoke with some malts seeping through. Upon tasting, I find the smoke very bacon-like but it's all I can taste! I nice moderate-bodied beer with low-med carbonation I can't drink one after another. Quite tasty though. I like Schlenkerla's helles lagerbier better, because of the lighter smoked flavour, I can taste other parts of the beer better."
"All around really good. I think this is going on my list of things to pick up again in the future."
"D: A very smoked Rauchbier. Either you'll love it or hate it. I had my first one a couple of years back - then I hated it. This time it's a lot better."
"D-this is one of those beers that you will either love or hate. A really great and different style to try."
"To drinkability, this is a beer I just couldn't finish. Not even on a bet."
"Drinkability: this beer is good, but it's a bit much to consume a lot of. I'm going to enjoy this bottle, but I don't think I'm likely to ever have two in a sitting."
"Medium bodied with a fair amount of fine carbonation. Feels pillowly and soft in the mouth. The first time I had this it was a bit of a shock, but after giving it some time and a second chance knowing what I'm getting into, this is a damned good beer. This is a drinkable piece of living history, the process of malting the barley over a beechwood fire dating back to a time before someone had the idea of malting the barley in a kiln. I think I want to hunt for more rauchbiers."
"There is nothing-- and I mean nothing-- like a beer from Schlenkerla. The marzen, like all other beers from this brewery, is rank with smoke from top to bottom, from beginning to end. And let us not leave out the salted ham, the salami, the tobacco, the prosciutto... the entire pig, smoked on a rod, slowly, without the apple in its mouth (which I find so silly, anyhow...). If you're careful you'll detect some light hops at the end which adds just a nip to the beer. On the whole it's softer and loftier than the urbock, but not as light as the lager (both worth your $6). An acquired taste, perhaps, but one which is worth acquiring. You cannot go wrong."
"This is by far one of the most unique beers I've ever tried. I REALLY wanted to like it, but I couldn't. Again, ""It's not you, baby, It's me."""
"The beer pours a hazy reddish brown color with a tan head. The aroma is very smokey with some meaty notes. I also get a little dark fruit in the aroma. The flavor is smoke, roasted malt, chocolate, dark fruit and ash. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. This beer was similar to the Urbock, but I feel this one was a little less smoky, but also more complex in the flavor department."
"Dark, murky brownish/red swamp color in body with floating off-white fluffy head. Aroma of ham, meats, woodchips, smoke, tobacco, spice, and black pepper. More subtle in flavor than it looks: ham, meats, smokiness, slight tobacco towards the finish, bacon, hops without the bitterness towards the finish as well. Medium in body with a rather refreshing mouthfeel and taste. A tasty brew that quenches a strange thirst for a cigarette with your bacon and eggs."
"Overall, this is a beer that scares people. I was and had some preconceptions from a tasting decades ago. This smells harsher than it is, and it is a far cry from liquid bacon. Great balance allows for the drinkability. Might be tough to do more than one at a sitting, but this is very special beer. Worth the try, by far."
"Pleasant and unusual."
"One thing I will say is that the smokey flavor tastes more authentic than I have had in American beers, so they probably did this right."
"very drinkable and goes down smooth. this is a well constructed beer that is true to style. i'm not normally into smoke flavors in my beer, but i would definitely buy this again."
"It would be hard to find something about this beer that I DON'T like, other than the fact it's not sold in six packs near me! A truly fine beer."
"D - A great introduction to Rauchbier but falls short of the Urbock."
"This is a very special and unique beer. The enjoyment of this beer depends on what you drank before it, what you are eating to accompany it, and what your mood is. I was not in the most adventurous mood, so I could not enjoy it as much as I did before. Still, overall good beer, highly recommended"
"D - first time I had this beer about 3 years ago i couldnt finish it, palette has luckily changed for the better, will be trying their other versions"
" This is an amazing beer. A whole new world of flavor for me. A definite gouda cheese accompaniment. Might also consider using this in a chili or black bean dish. Great experience!"
"Real easy to drink. Would buy this again. Would suggest it to someone to introduce them to Rauchbier."
"overall, i feel like this beer was a brand new experience for me. i loved it."
"D - Well I couldn't say that I could toss back a whole lot of this beer, but I would enjoy a pint or two, especially with some BBQ meat! Very good, I'd like to try others of the style but I'd definitely go for more American craft brews before this one."
"A unique style of beer but definitely not my favorite. Mouthfeel is light and medially carbonated. Drinkability is good because of it's light body but i can't help relating the taste and smell to leather. Oh well. Give this beer a try if you have the chance."
"Pretty smoky but I guess that's the style. Would love to have this next to a nice chili or even in it. Hard to imagine drinking pints of it though, the smokiness would just be too much."
"D- went down like water- smoky, thick, delicious water"
"Best smoky beer, and smokiest, I've ever had and I'm sad being an ocean away from having it on tap."
"Overall - Outstanding - this is the classic rauchbier. This is especially enjoyable after trying a good bock or doppelbock to put the difference into perspective, or paired with bacon or beef."
"D: This beer was very easy to drink. The aroma and taste are intriguing by themselves, but I could definitely see paring this up with German food (landjäger immediately comes to mind) or barbeque."
"D-a good beer but the style is not among may favorite and while it good to enjoy one on occasion there no way i could drink this all night"
"I'm a big of fan of darker-looking beers, and this beer is almost perfect in that respect. Leaves a nice thick head, too. Unfortunately, the flavor wasn't quite as thick and rich as I was expecting- I don't think anything on earth could live up to that smell. It's still pretty delicious and hearty, though. I'll probably buy a few other Aecht beers, if only to smell them."
"I paired this with an aged gouda. I think it worked well."
"D- Certainly a beer for a barbeque/meat dish. I remember having this beer a few years ago and being completely overwhelmed by the smoke. This time around i can appreciate the smoke while noting the underlying marzen malt flavours making the beer much more accessible and not all about one flavour. Lovely stuff!!"
"D: I wasnt too excited about drinking this as its not really my favorite style however this really grew on me the more I drank of it...a very drinkable beer."
"It could certainly be considered a session beer. None of the flavors are ever overwhelmingly strong so it's really a pleasure to drink. That said, you've gotta like the taste of smoked meats to get into this."
"Cheers to the LCBO for actually importing something interesting. I can't see too many people enjoying this one, but I'm loving it. I don't know if I'd ever want to session this but I'd be happy to drink it regularly."
"it. I would love to pair this up with some grilled brats and burgers."
"The on-tap experience is worth to travel to Bamberg!"
"While great by itself, would be an obvious pairing for all manner of meats, BBQ'd, smoked or otherwise."
"D= 4.0 (non-session) I could drink this beer next to a campfire all night. The best of its style thus far along my smoked beer journey. It has everything that a smoked beer should have. A true must try for those who have not tried it before."
"Dark copper/brown color with ruby highlighting. Pretty thin light tan head, but it does have some staying power. Lots of smokiness in the aroma. Reminded me of a strong smoked cheese and smoked salmon. Smoke dominates the flavor as well. Has some bitterness in the finish, but I'm really having trouble discerning much beyond the smokiness. This stuff is super smooth and goes down very easy. I wish I'd have drank this with my philly sandwich I had for lunch. I'm generally not much for beer with food, but I think this would be perfect with the right meal."
"Pours a dark molasses brown color with some moderate tan head that fades rapidly. Bubbles a little... seems carbonated like a soda. Smell is huge as soon the bottle is opened. At first it's almost all smoke, like smoked pork or bacon. Rolls into some darker malts, but still big smoke. Taste follows with some smokeiness and chocolate malt, very interesting. I've never really had anything like this, and I really like it. The smoke is big, though not overpowering. The rye toast/roasted malts come come through as it warms. Big flavors, really good. MF is a bit thin, though not overcarbonated as I expected. Great drinkability, very smooth and interesting. Great beer."
"pours a murky, chocolate color with a one finger tan head. BOOM! that smell hits ya. right away, im reminded of my summer quests involving over smoked venison meat. haha. beef jerky, strong hickory? (it says beechwood on the bottle but it smells just like hickory to me), leather, sausage, pepper, tons of spices and clove. oddly appealing to me. like picking up a dirty shirt and smelling it twice. thankfully the taste is not as strong as the aroma. smoke on the water. light, malty, and slightly sweet. BBQ beer for sure. unique and cool. i wouldn't call this one a sipper, more like a sniffer. ha. get this one if you see it."
"Served with a sticky, fluffy head of two fingers, tanned, over a mahogany body. Not much lace. Nose is strongly bacon-like, with notes of open flame and burned wood. Slight sweetness in the flavor that's not present in the nose, some roasted barley in there. The rest of the flavor is heavily smoked, lightly bitter. Herbal hopping component is also noted. Light body with high carbonation. Not so easy to drink due to the unusual nature of the beer, but a solid drink for when you're in the mood for a super-smoky sip."
"Very drinkable--I recommend this one before a meatlover's pizza or some german sausage. Excellent beer."
"Happy Mardi Gras!"
"Notes: I really liked the smoked meat aspect of this beer, but it seems like that would be a bit more subject on the person. I could see this going well in the summer with a barbecue or just some meat in general."
"Overall, this rauchbier delivers. If you're looking for a smoked marzen, then look no further. This brewery hits the nail on the head in terms of staying true to the style. Definitely give it a try if you're at all interested in this type of beer."
"Overall, this brew is a contender for best in class. Plus, it goes great with/in BBQ."
"Mouthfeel is nice, although the brew is not quite as thick as the smell might lead one to believe. Nice overall combination of carbonation and smoothness. Drinkability is excellent. A great late morning/early afternoon hearty smoke bomb!"
"Something to drink by the fire!"
"D: I wouldn't be able to drink this unless I'm in the mood for it. As a breakfast beer paired with the obvious bacon I could see this being even better. All in all, it tastes good and if you like or want to try out a smoked beer this is the one."
"D - This one really challenges the senses... It's an enjoying offering and one that I'm happy I tried, but I'm not sure it's repeatable or one that I would seek out purposefully seek out in the future..."
"Looks like a beautiful marzen: dark amber color and a large white head. The head quickly collars and dies. Smells like a hickory tree campfire. Tastes like a rich and malty marzen with mesquite BBQ flavors. I love this beer."
"Poured into a wheat type glass. Dark mahogany with light tan head the hangs around very slowly disapates. Laces somewhat. That great smokey aroma masks any others that might be present. This was the best of the three rauchbiers Aecht offers here. As much as I loved the bock, I thought this was a better melding of smoke and flavors. If you are only going to sample one of these make sure it is this one."
"taste is of smoke, smoke, smoke, malt, wood, oily feel, each taste is a little better than the last, it is shocking at first and then as your taste-buds form to the unique taste it mellows out and is quite pleasant."
"Feel and Drinkability: Light leaning towards medium-light in body. Much lighter than what the color would leave you to believe. Spritzy carbonation for something that you'd not thing to have higher and spritzy carbonation. Feels great in the mouth. Levels of the carbonation are in agreement with the weight of the body. It all works. Very nice. Definitely something to check out."
"I was once at a fancy shmantsy Indian restaurant, and ordered a curried lamb shank. The waiter suggested a smoked Shiraz from India to pair it with. At first I was put off (not knowing much about smoked drinks at the time) and it turned out to be perfect. That's something I'd like to try this with. The sweetness of this beer (and I loves me sweet beers!) needs to be balanced with something spicy, I think. Or maybe some intense German food like a good Bratwurst with spicy saurkraut...just thinking..."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, very good representation of style, to me this style is something you have to really be in the mood for or have a good food pairing to go with it, but this beer is the one that you'd want to go for at that time."
"D-GREAT beer. This is a classic smoked beer. Not overly smoky at all. I would have this beer again."
"Drinkability: Enjoyable. I will be drinking more of these."
"As it stands, I'm cooking pulled-pork sandwiches tonight, so I'm adding some of this to the cooking pot to spice it up."
"D: The classic of the style and the beer to have if you want to now what rauchbier is all about. A throwback to the early lagers and one of the most traditional flavours you're going to get."
"Will definitely be buying again."
"the color of a persian sunset over the elburz mountains, the smell of that alder smoked grain punishing the room like my kitchen at 8 with the best bacon around. i want this beer for breakfast. i guess i just want this beer not to be gone."
" If you are worried about drinking liquid BBQ sauce---fear not, this brew is an amazing balance of perfect execution. Malt, carbonation, yeast, and smoke all play a dominant role yet all work together. What an amazing and traditional brew. I now must find the Ur-bock!"
"I love this beer! All those sharp flavors combine in an enjoyable assault on the taste buds. And the nose kicks ass!"
"Pours a clear ruby brown with a fluffy, slightly off-white head that leaves a heavy residual head that allows heavy lacing down the glass. Aroma is smoke, roast, salty bacon. Flavor is sweet, toasty malt forward with smoke and salt and a sweet finish. Slightly bready. Medium-full bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation. Considering the smoke character, this beer is highly drinkable and well engineered. Well done Smoked, and not as over-the-top as a fresh Alaskan Smoked Porter."
"D: Good drinkability if you can handle the strong smokey smell and flavor."
"D – Very complementary to certain foods, and extremely delicious as a stand-alone."
"I only gave the drinkablilty a 3.5 considering I couldnt drink much of it. One bottle was just about right but I would definately drink it again."
"D- definitely a smoked beer. almost so over the top that it becomes a novelty. something id come back to sometime down the road but not for a while."
"I was really looking forward to this one after reading the reviews. In short, a must try. But, I couldn't drink more than one. It poured a beautiful dark amber with a 2 inch creamy head. It smelled of smoke. Like others have said, imagine the smell of a BBQ. The taste was OK. VERY unique. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't incredible either. The aftertaste is what turned me off. It really left a taste of smoke in my mouth that I couldn't help but associate with a tailgate. Hours later, I still tasted it. Overall, this is a ""must try at least once"" beer."
"I remember this beer being awesome from the gravity feed barrels at the brewery in Bamberg. I still enjoy it, but needs to be paired with some robust food."
"Only had one or two other rauchbiers, but this one was great, and really makes me want to explore this category more."
"This beer is drinkabile despite its intense smell. The dry finish doesn't linger."
"This is a very smooth beer to drink. Not too much carbonation, medium bodied. The sweetness of this beer comes through more as it warms. I would buy this again."
"God I love these beers. If you like things smoked (cheese, salmon, ribs, BBQ sauce etc) you can't go past this. Mind you, it isn't some kind of novelty beer. This has structure, balance and flavour in spades. Beautiful smokey, tar, coffee on the nose with a very pleasant dry, charcoal-like presence on the palate. Enjoyed this with a rump steak with wild mmushrooms and peppercorns and it rocked the house."
"D - Goes down very smooth for me. Might be a tad rich to have too many."
"D - Good to have one drink but more than one is a little bit pushy because you feel like you ate more than a pound of bacon."
"Not bad at all. I am just not a huge fan of Rauchbier's I guess. I really appreciate the craft that goes into a beer like this. Though I prefer the smoke flavor to compliment the malt, not the other way around. If you like the style, or interested in any way this is the place to start."
"MF&D - Medium bodied and smooth. My clear cut favorite from Aecht Schlenkerla. Give it a try."
"The weird thing, I love grilling, bacon, sausage. Just not as part of my beer. Who knows, maybe I'll try this again when my palate is more developed. Heaven knows SN porter and stout were tough for me 10 years ago, now I love them. . ."
"At the same time there is none of that ale staleness but a crisp refreshingness mixed with sweet malt flavours - OUTSTANDING"
"Final Thoughts: Certainly a good experience, and I would recommend trying it at least once. If I wanted something odd, I'd buy it again sure. Really though, there isn't much I'd pair this beer with and seems to be more of a novelty then anything. Try it, it's certainly different."
"From my experience (about half a dozen different smoked beers), i could barely finish a glass of Rauchbier. But i'll have no problem going trough this 500ml bottle. Amazing."
"This is an extraordinarily unique beer style that I've never had before. I've heard that people generally either really hate it or love it, and I definitely love it. I couldn't drink too many of these in a row, though, because of the strong smokiness. This is a great sipping beer."
"Thanks Bobsy for another great beer."
"To be honest I hate this style and didn't like this beer, but I did it because it's always good to be open. Based on the reviews and comments on other rauchbiers this is exactly what they taste like and is a good reproduction."
"So this is probably the best rauch I've ever had and I may be coming around on this style and these beers because I finished it and I understood it. I still didn't rank it as high as most but I think I'm beginning to understand the general appeal."
"Pours a very dark brown. No head, minimal lacing. Oily surface. Smell is pure smoke. Smells like charcoal plus good pork bbq. Front is puuure smoked bacon. Back doesn't taste much different than the front. Very nice mouthfeel, not thick, but substantial. Overall really good if you can get it and love pork."
"D: Excellent for sipping. The taste is too strong for more than one."
"The complex smokiness, the malty sweetness and the, relatively, light lager character creates a wonderful mélange that makes for a very drinkable and moderately complex beer. I imagine that I could easily quaff a couple of pints of this beer, one after another."
"Much more drinkable than the bottled version, this one is fairly complex and definitely unique. If you're going to try a rauchbier, it has to be one from Bamberg."
"D - I can't really do this, maybe it's an acquired taste, maybe I'll acquire it, but for now I like my meat on a plate."
"The taste is light for a rauch. Its smokey and porky but there are some definite malts there with a little sweetness. The sweetness to some might make it more drinkable but to me its distracting from what I really want, which is hardcore smokiness."
"Nice chestnut brown/coppery color. Low aroma-slight smokey quality. Trace of a caramel/nutty note. Malty flavor with a nice, moderate level of smoke. Touch of hop bitterness to go with it. Good body for a maerzen. Very drinkable beer. My German friend tries to scare me off of the smoke beers as he hates them. I find this quite enjoyable."
"D- This was the perfect beer for sitting out on my deck watching the leaves fall. Awesome beer for this time of year and I'll definitely pick some up the next time I'm going camping."
"D - I think I really need to move to Bamberg Germany Rauchbiers are one of my favorite beers and Aecht Schlenkerla is the brewery that all other Rauchbiers should be judged by I could seriously drink this stuff all day and all night a must try"
"O: Excellent beer, excellent drinkability. That's what you can expect from an Aecht Schlenkerla"
"I want to thank my friend Jim for giving me this beer as this was a great and unique brew that I could enjoy once or twice a year. This beer is not for everyone, but for the adventurous beer drinker this is a must try beer as it was so aromatic that it almost overwhelms the senses, but the flavor is very good and not nearly as dramatic as the smell. A very good beer which is a nice one to sip and savor. I can imagine this going quite well with some bread and cheese."
"Overall, this is an excellent beer, especially for drinking in the fall and cooler months. I'm gonna run down to the store first thing tomorrow and a grab a few more of these. Highly recommend."
"The best rauchbier I've tasted. You certainly have to be in the mood for one of these, but when that time comes, this is the most delicious, not to mention drinkable, of the lot. Perfect for the autumn season."
"I hate to slam a beer, but this was amazingly bad. I've had a smoked porter before and didn't like that either, but this was far worse. My wife said it ""smells like Band-Aids"" and she has a point. This beer smells smoky (obviously) and at the same time medicinal. For me, it was like someone scooped up the coals of a burned down building and made a tea out of them by steeping them in beer. Truly awful."
"D = Despite all its merits, I simply don't see myself drinking this beer more than once a season. It's a terrific flavour to be sure, but rarely one I'm looking for in my glass. Well worth the experience, however, and certainly one I'd recommend for one up to the challenge."
"Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with low to medium carbonation. Perfect body, glad I've started to like Rauchs again because they are great."
"Truly a unique, delicious, must-try beer experience!"
"Notes - Give smoked beer a shot at least once. It's very unique and if you are looking for something different this is a great place to look. This beer has evoked words such as meat, wood, jerky etc. Aecht Schlenkerla Marzen is an earthy and hearty beer and probably the best of the Rauchbiers. This one is worth it."
"D: again, i know i'll have to come back to this once i've tried more rauchs, but definitely tasty and sessionable. going great with my extra sharp cheddar mac and cheese."
"A very good rauchbier. This style isn't for everyone but the well controlled smoke character in this example make it a quite drinkable version."
"This beer is an aquired tast - but very damn good and tasty. I would drink one of these and move to another, but not for a bad reason. This is a great brew that is meant to be sipped and enjoyed. Nice."
"If you like the Rauchbier style, this is your brew. Very smoky. Hints of smoked ham or bacon found in the aroma, translating into a very smoky flavor that is well balanced with the malts. Not much hoppiness to speak of. Very drinkable since the smoke flavor isn't overbearing. I'm a fan."
"Had a half-liter bottle with my burger at the Farmhouse in Emmaus, PA. I remembered this beer being super-smokey, and I was not mistaken. It's not like most American smoke beers, however, that drink like liquid bacon (not that that's a bad thing). This flavor is rich with smoked wood flavor more in line with what you get in home-made jerkey - it's a big, but smooth roasted taste that reminds you of a fireplace. The malt provide sweet, crust and caramel background, but mostly just props up the smoked beechwood. The body, despite the strong flavor, is very drinkable. Overall, this is a classic rauchbier."
"Dark brown with a thin beige head with good retention and nice lace. On the nose, it's deep and roasty, meaty and savory, almost sausage-like. Mild caramel sweetness is present. The palate opens smoky in a way that reminds me of smoking wet wood, with an earthy hop character. The hops work very well with the smoke, enhancing the experience. Smoky and meaty, this stuff is great. Light in body, and the carbonation is a touch higher than it needs to be. The finish is solid - dry and smoky - but could use a little bit more character. Thoroughly enjoyable, this beer is pretty excellent"
"D - While I do enjoy this, the taste is a little too strong to take repeatedly."
"D - Not bad for a smoky, hammy-ass beer. This is a novelty for sure, but overall I like it."
"Pours a clear dark brown with ruby highlights and a creamy beige head that recedes to a cap but sticks around forever. Smells like a brisket that's been smoking away for 14 hours. Well actually it smells more like the smoke than the brisket. I strain and maybe think I find some caramel or toffee underneath, but the smoke is powerful and hides anything else that is in there. I now understand why some people say smoked smells like bacon. The taste is rich malty and creamy with a heavy hand of smoke. There are some sweet malts in there; caramel, toffee, and maybe some brown sugar in the taste. Lightly carbonated, medium body. I would have to say this must be an acquired taste. I can appreciate it for what it is, but I can't imagine myself enjoying many of these. I think its very well done, but not for me."
"This is the second smoked beer i have had and it was much better than the first (stone smoked porter). Has a rich amber color and smells like a barbeque. Has some serious drinkability, but at the same time could not see myself drinking more than two of these 16 oz'ers. Even though its the 2nd smoked beer I have head, you can just tell that just among the best. I was very surprised by this one and highly recommend this one for curious drinkers."
"This is a beer everyone should try. very peculiar. I'd probably buy one or 2 again in the future just for somthing diffrent, but this is definitly not my favorite style."
"Pours a dark brown with a thin tan head. Nose has beige head. Nose has big smoke presence over crisp malts, toffee and caramel. Taste also quite smokey yet still well balanced. Clean body is quite refreshing. I'm really starting to enjoy this style and these guys do a great job."
"Sat on the patio with The Cantankerous for this one and watched the birds playing in the woods behind our house. The smell of the Aecht Schlenkerla was especially pleasing. Surprised by how much I liked this."
"This beer was poured into a pint glass. As the coloration is that of deep brown color it is actually a good deep red tone to it as well. The smell of smoke aroma is the over tones of smell. It reminds me of meet curing to be jerked. The taste is that of smoke and nice deep caramel tones as well. Makes me want to try more smoked beers."
"Pours a very dark amber with 2 finger head of barely off-white foam. Leaves quite a bit of lacing on the glass. As soon as you crack this beast open you know you are dealing with something a little different. You don't even have to breath through your nose and you can easily pick up on the smokiness in the nose. I can't fight my way through it, all I smell is delicious smokey... nay very smokey bacon. Taking a sip, I am immediately thinking of a delicous roast beef dinner with gravy. What the hell is this, dinner in a bottle? Finish is a little bitter but the smoke remains in your mouth long after you have taken a sip. Another noticable feature is a bit of a metallic taste. The bottle is labled as a marzen but you could easily lie to me and tell me it is something else. I guess if you took away the smokey flavor it might taste like a marzen but I am too caught up in the beefy taste to tell what it is. About all this beer has to offer that is like a marzen is the color, and even that looks like it has been set on fire and burnt a little."
"My first experience was an explosion of dark wheat colored, thick foam all over - a mess. The color was a beautiful mahogany amber with cola highlights. The smell was VERY dominate smoked or even burnt wood aroma, maybe cedar with a slight chocolate accent and other potent spices. The taste was the same as the smell. Mouthfeel - deep medium-bodied and smooth. Drinkability - It was real good, but the smokiness was a little overpowering."
"This is a unique beer that every BA should try at least once."
"One of a kind beer that is well worth the high price. Makes me remember why I so enjoyed living in Germany for four years."
"D - I'm still developing a palate for this style, but I really liked this beer. I can't say that I'd be able to put away several pints at a sitting, but paired with the right smoky/spicy foods, this beer provides a unique drinking experience."
"D- Moderately high. The smoke can get to you, but for me, I f'ing LOVE this beer. In my opinion, this is a unique, fantastic, and one-of-a-kind beer that is prefect for stretching your concepts of what a beer can be. Although it's an old-world technique, this beer can hold its own and even teach a thing or two to modern brewers. Fan-f'ing-tastic, my passion for this beer is almost unrivaled. One of the best beers I've ever had."
"recommend it. Great for the style but not everyday."
"As for mouthfeel, it is light and fairly smooth, but I can practically sense the carcinogens suspended in this as I swallow. Needless to say, drinkability suffers because of the offputting flavors. Definitely a unique experience, and surely an acquired taste - one I can't really see myself trying to hard to develop."
"Not my favorite beer, but fits the style well and will make fans of this style very happy. Don't think you would throw back more than one of these per night though. Fun to try."
"I really enjoy various amounts of smoke in a beer. This one has the most of any that I've had and I like it. This is one of those beers that I like but wouldn't want every day (like Sculpin) but once every two weeks would be pleasant."
"Overall, an interesting and complex beer that I think every beer fan should try at least once to see if they like it. I would drink another if given the opportunity."
"Overall I'm surprised. I'm not a fan of smokiness and yet I kind of really dig this beer. Huh."
"Very drinkable - if the smell doesn't bother you, you can out down many of these. A unique style definietly worth trying."
"Mouthfeel is crisp with a moderate amount of carbonation present. Flavor is smoke, smoke, meat, smoke, smoked meat, slight bitter hops, and smoke. Wow. I was a little hesitant going into this one, but I dig it. I wouldn't want to drink one after the other, as it is a bit different, but I can drink this one plenty fine."
"Smoked BBQ does not do much for rauchbiers, as I first imagined. I have found chili to be really tasty with it though."
"Would go well with grilled or spicy foods. I couldn't drink more than one in a sitting though. Definitely something different and worth a try."
"Don't know what took me so long to try this beer. I think other smoke beers I have tried were not nearly this good, so I wasn't interested. I highly recommend this one, and I will be having it again soon..."
"The smoke is really light and not overpowering. The sweetness is upfront, reminds me of BBQ. Spicy and very complex in the middle. The malt is thick and rich, lightly hopped. Finishes clean, not grainy, sweetness is on the tip of the tongue and extremely dry throughout. Taste lingers until the next sip. I see why Dad loves this. He was based in Bamberg in the 50's and 60's. The bier garden is the place to try this if you are ever in Bamberg."
"50cL bottle into a half maß."
"A joy to drink but not all the time."
"D - Goes down very smooth! The smoke does not seem to negatively affect drinkability. In fact, this would be amazing paired with some smoked sausages or ribs!"
"When I first had this beer as a teenager I was utterly horrified that a beer could be smoked, then again I didnt know German at that age, so Rauchbier was inaptly translated as something-or-other-beer. but now, I knew what was coming and I can say that I love it."
"Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Marzen is a great experience; however a little goes a long way. I'm glad I tried it; however I may not go back for more."
"This beer poured a dark amber/brown with a head that was generous but lighter in color than anticipated. Aroma is of smoke/bacon. Taste is the same. Mouthfeel is very nice. I like this the best of the Schlenkerla smoke beers. Still this is not something I could session on a regular basis."
"The taste, ehh, not so much. its too thin, if this was an ale and not a lager i think i would like it better, but al i taste is smoke, no malt and the mouthfeel is too thin. Good, well made beer, but not my cup of tea."
"This beer pours a deep brown with a lot of red highlights to it - almost amber in color but too deep to really be amber. A two finger of tan head that recedes to a nice 1/4 cap, nice lacing left behind. Nose is reminiscent of a campfire! OK, campfire and bacon - I was practically salivating at this point. Taste is - if I could bottle a campfire this is exactly what I would think it tasted like. Deeply smoked malts are the basis of this beer - start to finish, with saltiness to the taste. Reminds me of smoked bacons and hams. Nice mouthfeel, rather creamy, mildly carbonated. This is a beer that I could drink for a good session. It's not everyone's cup of tea, but it's a damn fine beer for me!"
"And, also compared to the Urbock, it has a more mild taste to it with more carbonation. Zesty, almost candy spice taste to it."
"wow, what a beer. quite complex and layered. while its got the smoke down pat, it doesnt stop there. plenty to contemplate while you sip and let the beer warm. seriously enjoyable."
"Pours dark brown color with huge tan head. Retention is very good. Smell - very smoky, malty, quite nice. Taste - smoky again, some caramel sweetness, finishes slightly bitter. Very smooth and rich, fairly balanced, quite drinkable. I liked this one, it would make good session beer."
"D - Another surprise! With all that smoke, it still goes down nice and easy. Maybe couldn't down many of these by themselves, but with some bratwurst or some ribs, hell yeah; keep it comin'!"
"The beer pours a dark wine-ish brown with some nice lacing. The aroma is wood smoke from a campfire with a touch of smokehouse pork. However, these smoke flavors don't entirely crowd out the solid malt backbone. Heller-Trum does an excellent job controlling the meaty potential of the beer. The flavor is similarly good and affords some interesting insight into the historical practices of brewing. It's good that German brewers maintain these older styles. The malt is sweet and lush with a crisp touch of bitterness in the finish. The beer has a pleasing mouthfeel, smooth and round. Drinkability is definitely a case of personal preference, but it's not a heavy beer to drink despite the depth of flavor."
"D- This is a very nice full flavored beer with some nice depth and smoke was only one flavor of many. The band-aid notes were very soft and pleasant much more so than beers with to much peat smoked malt. I would be interested in trying to pair this beer with food."
"First smokebeer. Pours a deep red. Smells much like a camp fire and smoked sausage. The taste is actually much more subtle, you can taste the malts and the smoke taste is much more mild on the palate. It leaves a pretty great taste in your mouth like chewing on a beef jerky. Great for certain occasions and probably only have one of these each time."
"Overall this is a well done Rauchbier - it's not too overdone with the smokiness but it's still front and center. Definitely worth a shot."
"Half liter bottle poured into my dimpled mug. Appears a dark ruby / brown color with an inch of dense lingering light ecru foam. Nose and tastes is of a smokey campfire, freshly fried bacon, Seltzer's Lebanon Bologna (a regional PA thing) really comes to mind due to the welcoming caramel sweetness that creeps in from the malt. There is a pleasant spiciness as well reminiscent of smoked peppered ham. About a notch better than medium bodied with ample carbonation."
"As you aerate it in your mouth, the smokiness appears. It is smooth, not think, pleasent in the mouth and interesting to drink and discuss."
"Very smooth, the bacon flavor may hold some up."
"From the 1 pt. 09 fl. oz. bottle with no date or lot number available. Sampled on April 27, 2009. Outside temperature of 70-degrees Farenheit. The pour is a slightly cloudy brown with a tremendous amount of foamy tan head that bubbles until the end and never really goes away. The aroma is spectacular like nothing else I have smelled. It is like smoked cheddar cheese. Malts and hops play second fiddle to the amazing smoky aroma. The mouthfeel is medoium to bold and kind of creamy. The taste is an intricate balance of smoked malts and wheat. This is probably the best wheat beer I have ever had."
"I've always really liked the beer from this brewery, and I think they set the standards for Rauchbier for everyone else. These beers are international treasures and should be appreciated for what they are. Pours a slightly reddish dark brown with a very loosely beaded head that fades to a ring. Absolutely scrumptious aroma of ethereal woodsmoke and tangy malt. The taste has plenty of that same woodsmoke as well as a slightly sour graininess and a long bitter, almost tannic finish. At mid taste the malts are smooth and creamy. Quite lovely, and very firm. Great by itself, but a wonderful food beer. Try it with somke roast pork and potatos or with some sharp cheddar cheese."
"Overall, a remarkable brew. Very happy I picked this one up. The smoked meats in the nose really get the salivary glands going. Nothing overpowering and very well balanced. Paired this with some cheddar cheese and man was that ever good. It would be interesting having another rauchbier and compare the two, but unfortunately, this is the only one available in my area, atleast for the time being. Don't be intimidated by the fact that this is a smoked beer. Highly recommended."
"Bone white head, very thin with a pool of large bubbles in the middle, no lacing to be had. Dark brown to mahogany red in hue, close to full transparency, though, very consistent hue. Like, duh, the nose is very smoky, like a dry kindling fire, crispy bacon, touch of molasses like slow roast pulled pork, some pine resin as well, toasty sourdough, solid nuttiness too, some grape to cherry fruit scents, no citrus really. Light to medium-bodied but that smokiness is so bodacious it just fills the mouth. Bacon, beef jerky, saltlick quite obvious. It's interesting to taste a liquid so woody yet with no hint of oak barrel treatment. There's a light bitterness which teases out a moment of white grapefruit. Conversely, not without sweet notes of molasses, honey and caramelized brown sugar. Green raisin to fig fruit in minute portions. The finish swirls with persistent smokiness, it doesn't leave until you intentionally put something else in your mouth to tame it."
"Recommended."
"D: Changed by mind the more I drank as I got more familiar with the smokey flavor. This would be a great beer to drink if you're munching on a snack tray."
"D -- I can tell you that, when fresh, Rauchbier is highly drinkable through an evening of stube-hopping around Bamberg. I've never tried more than one bottle in a sitting here in the States, but I just might soon."
"Dark brown, clear liquid, with an offwhite fluffy head. Strong bacon smell, covering everything but a hint of woodsiness. The beef jerky taste just keeps coming. Upfront there is some bready maltiness, but then the jerky takes over and lingers in the finish. Very intriguing, but not as rich and balanced as their fastenbier."
"Very unique beer. Would love to have one of these next time I'm having pastrami or some good smoked barbecue"
"I could drink this all night, so long as I was hungry, and in the mood for an exceptionally tasty beer."
"A nice light brown color, some ruby highlights, dark in the middle, fairly clear, with a thin 1cm head. Loose bubbles, collapses to a thin swirl, very little lacing. Looks about how I'd expect. Smell is definitely is smoked, very smoked, but this one is more woody than the first I tried, and much less meaty, still some burnt pork, like BBQ, but with a distinct malt sweetness underneath. Again, a good smell for a rauchbeir, though its hard to look past the fresh wood smoke smell, like ashes. The taste comes across first with the woody smoke, like eating smoked meat, without the meat underneath. Definitely a very interesting taste, but I think this one is much more palatable for me than other rauchbiers, and I think this one is what thay're all shooting for. I really only get wood smoke though, sometimes like cooked meat, sometimes like raw wood pulp, there's a light malty finish with a bit of sweetness, but nothing impressive. The smoke is king here, and its pleasant. The carbonation is nice, makes it more interesting for me, otherwise this is kind of like liquid smoke. It's in a nice place between thick and thin, good body though. The drink is nice, I suppose very good for a smoked beer and the alcohol doesn't get you, but in the overall scheme of beers, this just isn't easy to drink. I'm interested in the flavors, though I think that lasts briefly, and the one-dimensionality will force me to slow down and lose interest. Worth a shot for those who are interested."
"Drinkability - a tasty brew if you like your smoke cold and wet. As the temps begin to warm, this is the push I need to get the smoker ready for the season's first conquest, a ten pound brisket. Chomp!"
"d- For the fact that I was scared of this beer and the smell of bacon and smoky ham, I could drink these all day. At 5.4% I could really have a number of these."
"All together very pleasing. I was worried I wouldn't appreciate the flavor, but like everything else smoked, I seem to love this beer. I'm now glad I got their wheat rauchbier too."
"D - I will be buying more of this. It was more than a pleasure to drink. This would go very well with a veggie burger grilled on an old coal bbq topped with caramelized onions."
"An interesting change of pace, but one that didn't deliver as hoped. It didn't complement the sausage I had with it as well as most other beers I've had in the past. Specifically, there wasn't much of an interplay of flavors, just an overpowering smokiness."
"O: I am very preferrential to this beer. While Marzens are probably my favorite style, the addition of the Rauch malt to this makes it even better. Smokey, but not over the top. Take the chance - give it a try."
"Conclusion: Great rauchbier! It's beers like Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier that make beer tasting so exciting, inspiring and fascinating! Dark red liquid with tan lacing and coffee and tobacco smell. Smokey overall smell/aroma/flavor, but not overwhelming compared to other brews in the style. Smoked ham, salty meat dishes and coffee are the greatest characteristics of the taste. Would work great with (obviously) smoked dishes, pork and fish (smoked mackerel comes to mind) or even ye ole' BBQ."
"Overall, I really couldn't stomach much of this beer. It felt like drinking bacon grease or something. It was interesting, and fun to try, but not a beer I can drink much of."
"overall- when i saw this at the local corner store i almost screamed with excitement. I only found out about these recently. My girlfriend said it best: ""It's like two of your favorite beers got together and had a baby"". If you like marzens and/or rauchbiers be sure to get as many of these as you can."
"But seriously, finish is nice with a little smokey aftertaste. I have had other marzens and this one by far is one of the best, although it is more of a Rauchbier. Drink slow unless you want your burps to smell like the Pit's at Cooper's B-B-Q in Llano, Texas (I miss that place)"
"Drinkability: I love rauchbier and this is one of the kings...Not quite as good as their urbock, but an excellent example of the style."
"Again, maybe my tastebuds were weird that night or maybe it was a bad bottle."
"D- Read about the style and it says acquired taste, well isn't that the truth."
"D= Very smoky but also very drinkable. I have to be in the mood for this stuff, but when I am, this is the real deal for me."
"Mouthfeel - really smooth and lightly creamy with low carbonation that suits the style. Feels great going down. I don't think a highly carbonated smoke beer would work."
"beer feels more like an interesting change of pace than a session beer. The more I drink it, the more I'm not sure the smoky flavors are all that desirable in a beer."
"Drinkability- I imagine this could be a good sipping beer paired with the proper foods, not something personal I could see drinking often or alot but definitely and interesting try"
"This is an interesting one - it looks, smells, and tastes like a standard Dunkel, say König Ludwig, but it has a really powerful, and enjoyable, smokey aftertaste, for all the world like decent Hessian Ahle Wurst. I tried the bottled version but I'm sure the smoke-bomb is even stronger on tap (and Bamberg looks like a great spot for a beer holiday). I'm still not sure whether to view this as a novelty beer or a precious classic, but if you're a fan of cured meat and good beer and you'd like to see the two combined, then Schlenkerla Rauchbier is for you!"
"If you're not among the initiated, you won't want to come near this. Not a session brew but this BA wouldn't have a problme enjoying more than one in one sitting. A wonderful treat."
"d) Lovely drink.... I haven't consumed more than one at a time, so not sure of the long-term effects of smokiness."
"D-This is not somethin I could drink very often but it is a very unique brew."
"mouth is suprisingly clean, maybe slightly dry. Drinks really really slow. It might take me a while to finish this one. but Damn it's a good beer. I'm thinking it would be good to make a chili or Ham and Beans with."
"D-I must say I am not a huge smoked beer fan so while I greatly appreciate the history and tradition of this style I do sruggle to get a whole pint down."
"Very tasty stuff. Went down real easy. This was my first rauchbier and will definitely not be my last. Pretty well balanced and great drinkability. You gotta try this stuff if you have not already. Yum."
"Eric"
"8/4/7/4/15 (3.8/5)"
"D-Not too alcoholic, and very light on the palate. After the first couple, smoke taste stops being so overwhelming and the taste is not quite as enjoyable, but still definitely drinkable."
"D - HIGH. At less than 6%, very nice. For a person that grew up in the wilderness, very good beer. Right at home. For the baby, forget it. This is a man's beer. Better go find a Miller Lite."
"Who needs coffee stouts for breakfast when you can drink this instead? Or have this with a coffee stout for breakfast without having any food? Downright yummy....now I want more 'lil smokies and German deli bacon."
"d=3.5"
"(rated 5/17/2007)"
"This beer is bottled bacon. Everything about it is smokey. Pours dark mahogany with a decent tan head. Aroma is...smoked bacon. The taste is...smoked bacon. There is some decent malt flavor and it does drink very smoothly. I might have this again if I'm having meat and cheese for dinner. It is pretty good, but I can't really see drinking this on a regular basis."
"Mouthfeel is quite decent; far from watery and with nice carbonation. Somewhat dry thanks to the smoke. Overall a very nice beer from a style that I wasn't sure I would like."
"4 M&3.5 D: a very pleasant drink overall, but I must say that if drinking it alone, it could become boring after just one pint... Or, is it because the beer has expired after all when I tasted it?? Gotta revisit this bottle version."
"Pours a very dar brown with white head. Aroma of roasted malts but dmoinated by a smokey charcoal bbq scent. This beer has a very complex taste that is dominated by a smoked charcoal taste. Burnt malt accompanied by hickory bbq. Very unique and original but not for everyone."
"D - too much for me, would only want one of these at a time. goes good with a contrasting sharp aged cheddar but would probably compliment a quality smoked meat at a bbq but worth trying. Look forward to a Rauchbier in bbq season."
"Somehow this seeming novelty really works as a delicious and drinkable beer...quite a surprise. The smoke is strong but not overwhelming or ashy. Great fun and well worth seeking out. Definitely appropriate for sipping by a roaring fire, and would be interesting to pair with smoked or sweet foods."
"This is the best Rauchbier I have had. If you like the style, you'll like this brew."
"D: This beer was a definite change of pace for me. Drinkability is tough for me to judge, as I'd have to be in just the right mood to drink another one of these. However, the beer seems an excellent example of the style. I enjoyed the beer best when I started drinking it alongside heavy cheeses."
"I studied in Bamberg, Germany for a year and this was by far the best and most distinct beer to come out of that famous brewing town. Many brews in Europe and abroad have tried to replicate this recipe, but it's quite exceptional. The color is mostly brown with some reddish-brown elements and a rather large head. The smell is immediately the first thing to truly reach your senses and smells like bacon or pork. It goes down smooth and has exceptional taste, but beware it definitely leaves a strong reminder in your mouth long after consumption. I highly recommend drinking this beer with a traditional German pork dish, such as Schweinebraten, Wuerstchen or Haxe. The beer can also be used to flavor foods when cooking. This beer is truly one of a kind."
"It's easy to see why this is regarded by many as the prototype of smokebeer. Pleasantly coincidental is the fact that under all the smokescreen, this savory treat is also a pretty damned fine Marzen. Aecht Schlenkerla's smoky brew is fullish in body with a creamy feel, mild carbonation, and great drinkability."
"This beer pours a redish brown with an beige colored head. There was good lacing on the glass. The aroma had a great smoky, earthy smell to it. The taste was again smoky and almost tastes like some variation of smoked bacon with a sweet malt background to it. The mouthfeel was just what it should be. The strong smokey flavor would make it difficult for me to drink very many of these in one sitting."
"This is my first of the style and I am rating it as best I can but damn this stuff is different. Really interesting style and I think I might have to get another of their offerings."
"D.- Very approachable for this style of beer. Not a session brew, but rather a sipper on a cold night or with barbecue. For those who have not tried a smoke beer, I highly reccommend they try this one."
"Great spicy food or cigar brew."
"Purchased this at Wine And Spirits Shoppe At Bradley Park in Columbus, Georgia. Beer is dark amber in color. It smells very smoky with a little malt in the nose. Wow it tastes very good. The taste is less smoky than the aroma. It is well balanced and fine tasting. A surprise to say the least. I would never have believed a smoke beer could be so fun to drink. Very diverse."
"Thanks to NASH for the bottle!"
"The aroma is very smokey and covers any other smells that might be there save a hint of malt. The appearance is dark brown and the head is persistent. The flavor is also very smokey and not unlike beef jerky. The palate was not as thick as I wanted but still its not thin. A very unique beer that's a must try, like it or not."
"M + D: The lighter side of a medium body... finishes very smooth and refreshing. This makes for a wonderful session choice on a chillier fall day (granted, today was NOT one, but it would have been all that much better had it been!)"
"As a big fan of dark German-style lagers I found the mouthfeel to be maybe a bit light for my taste. But overall this is a brilliant rauchbier; an enjoyable sipper!"
"D: I don't think I could have more than one bottle on its own; perhaps i'd make it into my second with some fine bbq to go along with it"
"Pours a leather brown body with two-finger tan head with minimal lacings. One of the strongest smells ever from a beer; incredible smokiness. I took a few big whiffs and ended up with stuff like smoked meat (think Slim Jims), mints, roasted malts mixed with spices, just a beer you have to smell to believe. So is the taste, to be honest. It is real smooth and creamy, almost full-bodied, yet there is this smokey, dry, almost processed meat taste to it (and I mean that in a good way). THere are hints of sweet and roasted malts and dark fruits, but the smokiness really comes through on this beer but it is reasonable; the backbite is dry but not overly dry and your pallete is killed like this is a DIPA or anything. I wouldn't mind this beer again, but one is enough for me. It took a little getting used to."
"D - My second true Rauchbier. I liked this much more than their weizen, probably because I had it with food (a sirloin steak), and my palate for smoked beers is evolving."
"I didn't think that a smoked flavor would mix well with beer but I am somewhat surprised here. This beer does an excellent job of being what it's supposed to be.Poured a nice dark reddish/gold appearance with thick off-white/dark yellow head and lots of lacing. The hints of smoked meat, ham??? are very present but not over powering. Unique is the word and thats goood."
"Drinkability: An enjoyable beer, a smoke-minded treat even, but not one I could down on a daily basis. Such a smokey, bacon-laden flavor and aroma that it might be even more recommended to friends of the Jewish persuasion. Paired well with some chicken pan fried noodles. The driver refused to partake in the beer once he smelled it."
"The taste is more complex, with smokey grain, Lapsang Souchong tea, up front, soon mellowing and joined by light toasted grain, hay, cola, general toasty-herbal-spice dunkel qualities. The smokeiness lingers, though lightly, after the finish. It's light in body, but tatsy, interesting, and drinkable, with the smoke just tame enough and just balanced enough so as not to be overpowering."
"D: Pretty drinkable smokey flavored beer. This would go very well with a good meat dinner."
"It is strangely drinkable. I highly recommend trying it."
"Drinkability is pretty good if you like smokey beers lacking subtlety. If you wanted a Märzen with a hint of smoke, you'll be disappointed. I like the fact that it's so robust and not that strong, only 5.1% ABV on my label. Still, not something I'd want to drink all night, one is enough for me. I wanted to like this more then I did, I've only had their Urbock previously, and preferred the darker malts with the smoke for a more balanced palate. Hey, at least we know there weren't any rats in the grain!"
"This is an outstanding smoked beer. The nose is reminiscent of a Hungarian smokehouse that I used to patronize in Bridgeport, CT (without the paprika of course). It is unbelievable how well-balanced this beer is. Although I was expecting the smoke taste to overwhelmingly prevail, I find that the malt comes right through as well. This is certainly not a session beer, but will nicely compliment any barbecued food you bring to the table!"
"D: This is a an odd case. It's not like other beers, but it's complex and drinkable. I haven't had that many rauchbiers, but this one is by far the most interesting."
"Poured a clear brown color with a small tan head that faded fast. Smelled of steak and meat, a little A1 sauce in there. The taste was the same, I picked up a lot of smoked flavors and a steak or burger merinade. Some smoked wood going on as well. It had a very clean finish, nothing lingered for a bad aftertaste. Smooth and easy to drink."
"This is a very unique and special beer. It has a dark brown color. Its aroma is pretty strong but not strong enough compared to its taste. It will surprise you the first time you try it: It tastes more like bacon and ham than beer. Trying it a couple will get you addicted as you will often feel the need to have this delicacy. It goes perfectly with meat (it won't change your taste) but you can also drink it alone. If you can handle the strong taste, then there is no limit in how many of these you can have in one drinking session."
"I'm not sure that beers of this style are really my favorites, but this is definitely a rauch done right, which I could definitely see myself enjoying at the right place. A campfire, barbecue, or smoked cheese complimetary for sure."
"D - This is a wonderful rauchbier and lives up to it's 'classic' status. I've had this beer on previous occasions and this tasting is just as good as previous. I would love to travel to Bamberg and have it close to the source."
"Notes: This is my first real Rauchbier and it really is different. I am not sure that I am a big fan of the style but this seems like this is a good example of the style. Note added later: I have thought about this beer for weeks after tasting it. There have only been a few that stuck in my memory like this one. I am upgrading the taste (I can STILL remember it!) for that reason from 4.5 to 5.0."
"Could not think of a more appropriate beer to enjoy with an authentic German meal, preferably with lots of meat that matches the smokiness of the beer."
"A: Acorn brown, spots of cottony foam around the edges - 4.25, T: Holy geez is this smoky, lots of smoke and strong scents of the smoky sausage from some good gumbo, earthy woods - 4.50, T: Though smoke is still the dominating factor, it is less noticeable on the tongue than the nose, the caramel malt manages to find a way through all the smoke, lots of wood, mildly dry -4.25, M: Silky 4.00, D: Overall, a very enjoyable beer, intensely smoky - 4.25"
"A deep, dark amber color, with a three finger thick, cream colored head forms on top. The head laces slowly down the glass. The smokiness is an incredible scent, it blends itself with a malty sweetness and doughiness. There is no real hop aroma in this beer. The malt hits the palate with a mild sweetness and the smoky flavor, that dominates and envelopes around every taste bud. Then a surprisingly mild citrus bitterness finishes the taste out. A very smooth feel, with a mild crispness, and is very silky along the palate. This is an incredible beer, there are styles that you have to taste from the source, this beer is it. Throw this at some smoked ribs or a pulled pork sandwhich. Plus, why doesn't barbaque places have this beer on tap or bottle."
"Smoke all the way, from the moment you open the bottle you can really feel the smoke hit you. The beer guy at whole foods that recommended this beet said, ""some people said it tasted like drinking an ashtray but i disagree"". By just smelling the beer I thought of smoked bacon, dunno I even felt weird about drinking something that smelled like bacon. The looks are ok, thin lace over a ruby colored body. Taste is good, it definitely does not taste like meat or an ashtray, it does taste like an oktoberfest covered in smoke. Some sweet malts. Medium body. Good overall, not my favorite style but fits the style perfectly."
"pours into my liter mug with a deep chestnut brown color and a relatively tight cream head. as I poured I picked up the melanoidin malt that is what a marzen is all about. Upon further investigation the malt aroma starts out fully as a smooth smoke and then gives way, though lightly, to malt. Flavor is all malt up from with medium body and and more smoke at swallow. After it's warmed I'm not sure if I've found a bit of hops in the finish of it it's just the smoke. it's has a medium intensity and I notice it more as I breath out. Nowhere near as rich as i expected (this is my first Schlenkerla) but so far is rather drinkable. Nice brew!"
"Glad I tried it but once will be enough"
"Drinkability is high if you like beers like this. Not really my cup of tea but it is nice to try something different every once in a while."
"Taste & mouthfeel: Very smoky up front, but not as dominant as the aroma suggests. Malt provides a good balance, though it's not overly sweet. A nice bold hop bitterness melds pleasantly with the smoke in the finish. The light body and crisp carbonation make this one surprisingly drinkable."
"This beer pours a semi dark amber with a 1 fingered head with no lacing. The smell! WOW it smells like bacon, like hickory smoked bacon, very original to my palate for a beer but intriguing. The taste is of bacon and malts with hardly any hops flavor. The mouthfeel is pleasant and the carbonation level is nice. Its a nice novelty beer/gag joke (that actually tastes good) but not something I would drink alot of. I got one of these for my brothers wife who puts mayo and bacon on everything she eats! :D"
"This one was interesting. I'd never had anything like it before. Very tasty and a perfect pairing with sweet BBQ or a smoked turkey sandwich."
"Slightly warming in the throat. Smooth medium bodied brew. Very light effervescence. I really like this style but the other offerings from this brewer are better, the Weizen somewhat, the Urbock much more so."
"A fine beer, and unique to me. The flavor is not overpowering by any means, but I can only do so much smoke."
"Overall, an excellent that I highly recommend. Great example of the style. Only wish it was available here. Would be part of the semi regular rotation if here. Since it's not it's a definite pickup every time I go to Indy. Look forward to others by them."
"D- What an amazing beer. Easily drinkable and will pair amazingly with meats. I intend to always have a couple of these in my fridge. Wow..."
""
"Had on tap at the old bierhall in Bamberg. The beer is clear dark copper with interesting highlights. The head is thin & tan and slightly rocky. The smell is smoke, burnt caramel, pepper, and hops. And smoke. And more smoke. It tastes of warm scotch, caramel, a touch of mint, and a smoky but not overpoweringly so finish. Plus more smoke. The mouthfeel is slick & very smooth but just a bit watery. Very little carbonation. It is drinkable beer, with a good balance of sweetness & smoke. After a while, the smoke builds up & its just too much for me. Rauchbiers are interesting but they are for someone else. If you like them, go to Bamberg. You won't be dissappointed."
"D: Pretty good, barring the alcohol tingle."
"I only have only had one other Rauchbier, which was from the same brewery, and I prefer that one. The other one tasting more like beef jerky rather than bacon. This one isn't bad, seems to be balanced without having overpowering smoke flavor. I think the smokiness goes better with the thickness of the ""bockier"" beer. Recommended."
"Although the beer is excellent, that smoky taste is too much for more than one beer."
"not as flavorful and complex as i had imagined in my mind. oh well."
"Pours a dark brown color with ruby highlights with a dense off-white head the quickly dissipates into a light ring. The aroma is of liquid smoke, charred soy marinated meat, wet burnt wood. Big smoke flavors, charred malt, roasted meat, a touch of soy sauce; the total campfire experience. The feel is fairly light for such a heavy flavored beer. I would like to have a little more malt body to help handle the intense smoke flavors. Great smoke flavors in this brew. It pretty much emcompasses the whole beer. I would like to see a heavier (non-smoked) malt to balance the smoke and add some additional flavor."
"Had this at Novare Res in Portland. Served in a seidel, it was a dark brown color with red highlights. The head was off-white and thick, and left some great lacing. The aroma was definitely smoky, in a good way, as well as some caramel. The taste echoed the aroma. There was a little mild hop taste later. A smooth, enjoyable beer."
"This is a good beer, session beer no, tasty beer yes!! May have the strongest smoke taste of any smoked beer I have ever had."
"D: I can't wait to have a few of these with ribs or pulled pork. I wouldn't want more than a few, but hard to stop once you start."
"M/D-This has a bite on the front and after that it goes down smooth. The smoke scent is something that for me is too overwhelming. I would like to try the other brands before giving up on this one."
"I concede that Rauchbier isn't my style of choice, but the flavor is intriguing to say the least. Dusty, earthen malts up front are followed by a blast of beefy smoke. A kiss of green, peppery hops light up the back of the palate on the finish. Body is lighter than I anticipated, but is smooth and semi-creamy, with a perfect carbonation level. This was a good beer experience, and one I look forward to having again. I'd love to see how this Rauchbier pairs with some grilled meat or dark chocolate."
"I love smoked food and this is just the absolute perfect pairing for a night outside with some friends and a smoker. Wonderful."
"Never had a beer like this. I read the other reviews and was scared to try it because of the ""smoky"" taste. I actually like the smoky taste. The smoke is more of an aftertaste. You taste the smoke more when you breath out after a sip (kind of weird). I'll pick this one up again."
"Edit: had to lower my drinkability score; on a more opinionated note I found it harder to drink this as it warmed and the flavors intensified, just a bit too intense for me and not sessionable, turned into a sipper... however, again because this is such an interesting style and more likely a great interpretation of it, it is a decent brew, just not something I would look too hard for, but if I was at a bbq this would be a nice surprise to accompany some well cooked meats..."
"Tastes very similar to smoked meats (bacon comes to mind), some hop bitterness and sweet malts."
"drinkability on most rachbiers won't ever be more than a 4 for me, they're too potent, but usually and in the case of this one, it's not in any sort of negative way, it's just stops you from gulping it. keeping this in mind though, the urbock beer by this brewery is better and more potent smoke-wise in my opinion."
"This is surprisingly drinkable. I thought would have trouble choking it down, but the way the smoke presents itself is extremely approachable. I doubt I'd drink it often, but it was well worth the price of admission."
"drinkability is great. this is a very distinct and unique brew. the smoked flavors give it a meaty profile, while the malts balance out the spice from the smoke. the aftertaste is reminiscent of beef jerky. this could very well be a polarizing brew because of the flavors present, but the proportioning and profile are excellent nonetheless. cheers!"
"D: Sure its a bit like a meal but it is incredibly smooth and surely hit or miss to most. You either love it or hate it and I love it. An all time favorite."
"D - This is an unusual and very savory beer. It is an excellent example of the style, and while it may be a difficult taste to aquire, it's a great beer when you're in the right mood."
"D: An interesting beer for something different. Not something I'd drink every day, but I'd love to have another with some smoked sausage and German potato salad."
"Drinkability: Quite drinkable, with somewhate less smokiness than the bottled version, and a great balance of smoke with the hops. Beautiful beer fresh from the casks and a world class experience at Heller Trum in Bamberg..."
"This is not a style I care to delve much more deeply into. Some beers are an acquired taste. This is not one I think I care to acqure."
"Pours a dark ruby hue with a one finger light khaki colored head that dies down to a fluffy layer of bubbles. Spotty lacing is left on the sides of the glass. Smell is beef jerky and campfire smoke with a hint of sweet molasses. Lots of roasted grains and a bit of caramel malt in the nose as well. I have never smelled anything like this before, let's see how this one tastes. Taste begins with a smoked kielbasa that was cooked while tailgating truthfully in the parking lot of Ralph Wilson stadium. Midway a bit of brown sugar sweetness tickles the tongue, ending with a charred oak like aftertaste that's on the dry side. Medium to full body with a creamy smooth feel. Carbonation is fairly low, but fits the beer very well. This beer really improves as it warms, the flavors seem to be more pronounced. To be honest, before I even opened this bottle I wasn't sure if I would be able to finish this beer. I would be in heaven if Dinosaur BBQ downtown had this on hand. Drunken Spicy Shrimp, Tres Hombre, and Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Marzen may just be the perfect combination...I may have to get another bottle of this and some Dinosaur take out VERY soon."
"D: Very good drinkability making for a great smoky treat. The first time I had this I was literally shocked by the pronounced huge flavor. Now having and enjoying this beer and style several times it is perhaps one of the finest and smoothest by nature and a prime example. Extremely smooth and easy to consume once you are accustomed to its unique and straightforward flavor and only gets easy and better after every tasting."
"I tried this beer on January 28, 2008 at ""Smokeless Joe's"" in Toronto. The beer poured a brownish-black into the glass with minimal head, and an 'oily' look. The aroma was smoked wood, as well as some roasted malty tones. The mouthfeel was light bodied, almost watery, yet creamy, with little carbonation. The flavour was very much like burnt bacon and burnt coffee."
"M- full body with a medium carbonation"
"If I ever get another bottle of this brew, I will definately mix it to try some improvements. It is not enjoyable to drink this pure. You might as well lick an ashtray."
"I've saved this bottle for my 100th review and now i'm glad that I did.This pours dark and almost purple looking until held to direct light then it reveals deep mahogany with lots of red,the cap is almond and leaves polka dot lacing as it dissapates.The smell is almost all smoke(like a jumbo smoked turkey leg) with hints of fresh cut oak timbers and leather.This tastes like smoked ham and suttle clove,it's mostly malty with burnt tobacco notes,the flavors sound overwhelming but are anything but,this is a medium body brew,not heavy like I expected,I am impressed."
"This is my first experience with a rauchbier, and might be my only for awhile as it looks like this is the only rauchbier carried by my local Total Wine. It was easy for me to evaluate this beer based on my own tastes, but I really couldn't compare it in context. It was a highly unique and enjoyable experience, far out of the realm of most beer I'm used to, and wouldn't mind trying more."
"yumm-o a tasty, smoky treat maybe not the best for warmer times but a nice addition to a fall or winter meal."
"Overall, the smoke flavor could have been toned down for me personally. Not sure how this stacks up against other beers of this style because it is only my second."
"Finish is clean as you would expect from a lager. Suprisingly this would be a good session beer."
"A beer unlike any other I've had. I'd love to try another rauch."
"D_A nice rauch but not quite as good as the festbier of theirs."
"I first saw this style of beer at Total Wine in Fort Myers, FL. As I attempted to pronounce the phlegm inducing, tongue twister of a name I thought to myself, ""Smoke beer? Is this going to taste like dear old Grandma Abigail's ashes?"" It was nothing like that at all! I slowly poured the rich tawny brew into a pilsener stlye glass (I had never heard of rauchbeir before then so I had no idea what vessel to enjoy it in.) I put my nostril up to the rim and inhaled deeply. Fresh smokey hardwood wafted into my nose. It reminded me of a summer barbeque with weiners on the grill. I took a swig and swished it around my pallet. What a symphony of smoked meat flavoring and faint oak. It was absolutely delectable! I had never experienced anything close to it. Now I live in Gainesville and I am totally craving the Jimmy Dean goodness that is rauchbeir. I have already ordered a case for the liquor store I work at."
"D - Very special and different would go great with a BBQ, but would not pick this beer to drink one after the other."
"A very nice rauchbier, that I recently had the privelege of trying in a party ball (miniature keg). For my PA people, you can get them at SHANGY's in Emmaus for $22.00. Francisweizen and I are enjoying one right now. Strong rich smokey flavor. Very mellow, warm mouthfeel. One of the tastiest marzens I have had. The initial flavor comes smooth and slow, and builds to a full, minutely bitter finish. If you are in the market for a nice Rauchbier, this is probably one of your best options."
"This is a very interesting beer/style. I really enjoyed it. Not an everyday beer, but it's a nice novelty treat. Would pair perfectly with some southern pork BBQ, smoked whitefish, or maybe a smoked Gouda & crackers."
"Clouds of smoke in the flavour, which although peculiarly meaty, has a fairly light mouthfeel. There's a prominent graininess (that'll be all the smoked Bamberg malt) and really not much else other than wave after wave of smoke. Decent level of carbonation. Overall, this is a bit of a one-dimensional beer, but what a dimension! I imagine it would be perfect with sausages and by the fire on a cold night. Sounds like I'll be taking this with me next time I go camping!"
" Very unique to my palate and highly enjoyable."
"Smooth and easy drinkin' despite the extreme flavor. Medium body and perfect carbonation."
"Drinkability is decent for me, I could have one more but then I would be done with it."
"Cheers"
"Even though not everybody is going to like this bier, the style is worth a try."
"Drinkability: The taste is such that it's hard to imagine drinking several in one sitting. It's great to test one's palate to, but the smoked character of this beer makes it difficult to enjoy without some sort of food, or alone multiple times. Very very good overall in one sitting, however..."
"Drinkability: This is my first foray into the realm of the Rauchbier. It was very interesting, and not totally uninviting. I'm glad I chose the malty Marzen version. It's an acquired taste, and I think that (given time) I can get to where I really appreciate it. I paired this with some grilled/smoked Andouille sausage, which was a PERFECT compliment to the Rauchbier."
"from City Beer Store in S.F. Poured a rich dark brown in a weizen glass with a nice light tan head. Good lacing too. Smell was very reminiscent of salted and peppered beef jerky and smoked bbq, and although it was very obvious, it wasn't as extremely overpowering or offensive as I feared. I found it extremely enticing and the taste was not a letdown either. The base of the beer itself was smooth, perfectly malty and sweet with a touch of lingering smokiness and light bitterness in the finish. It was very full flavored, not overdone and perfectly crisp from the carbonation, and I was shocked at how drinkable this stuff was. I expected this to be a letdown b/c I was quite excited to try it, but I was very pleasantly surprised. Very good, and I can't wait to try the other 2 varieties."
"D - I truly love this beer. I can imagine how perfect it would be with pulled pork bbq and smoked ribs, unfortunately I currently only have baked potato pringles. I need more, and you need to try it. Just do it."
"The lack of complexity, and the overriding campfire-smoker taste, somewhat hinder the drinkability. Yet this isn't bad by any means. It's worth a try, and went well with a good slice of pepperoni pizza (I wish I had some anchovies on it, which probably would have been great with this Rauchbier.). I don't know how often I'll grab this or any other smoke beer but, if someone offers me a cold Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Marzen, I won't say no. Fear not."
"I couldn't finish this beer. I'll be sure to keep away from beers labeled ""smoked"" in the near future. Maybe when I'm older I'll revisit them. And maybe I'll look for ones in smaller bottles."
"Taste is not too bad but funny thing is the nose strangles the flavour. I can tell I'm drinking a particularly flavoured lager but then the smoke kicks into my nose and I lose the flavour. Maybe that's the point. I'm getting hints of that smokey bacon flavour on the front palate and a bit of toastiness. The back palate (which is disappointingly short) is where the hops lie, and it would be quite underwhelming in flavour if not for the fact that the back palate is where the aroma comes blundering in. Overall an interesting brew. I certainly couldn't drink masses of it but it's an experience, and not a bad one."
"Like I said earlier, if I'm in the mood for something a little off the beaten path this is what I pick up. This is one world class rauchbier."
"Drinkability- Astoundingly, I could drink lots of this at any barbecue cookoff or any other meat eating activity. But to not be food racist, I'm sure this would pair well with smoked mushrooms as well."
"There was a strong but smooth smoke aroma immediately upon opening the bottle. It has a very pretty reddish brown color, and a thin off white head that dissipates quickly. Smells like bacon on a campfire. Very smooth mouthfeel. The smoky flavor gives way to a buttery, nutty flavor that hangs in your mouth long after finishing the beer. This is the most drinkable rauchbeer I've had, and definitely one of my favorites."
"Plenty of smoke, but perfectly integrated. Very tasty and balanced beer, with no shortage of character."
"Poured a 22oz into a Chimay Chalice (2 pours). Poured a dark brown with ruby highlights and a nice 1 inch head that dissipated quickly and left no lacing. Aroma is smoked meats, like oak smoked bacon, slight saltiness. I thought the taste was very 1 dimensional. I get the salty, smokiness but not much more. The smoke is a bit overpowering. It doesnt highlight the beer, it overwhelms it. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with light carbonation. I think this is a dont miss if youre a big smoked beer person."
"I think this is the first 5 I gave anything on flavor. That is because within it's style category I cannot imagine it improving any more. Also - I had it fresh on tap across the street from the brewery! A warm buffed and oiled woodsy brown with a pillowy off-white head. Aromas of juicy munich malt, campfires, and a hint of sulphur. Flavors of smoked pork, charred wood (but without bitterness) and the finely tooled leather belt they used to jam in my mouth during my childhood fits. This is incredible stuff, and is certainly not for everyone. Bottled bacon is an aquired taste."
"D: Highly drinkable for a rauchbeer and I feel a better than the urbock."
"Brown body with amber highlights. Little head to speak of. Aroma is all smoky wood. Virtually no malt - just burning wood. Flavor is also heavy on the smoky notes. some malt comes through, but pretty much all smoke. Mouthfeel is solid. Drinkability is OK, but a little more rich malt sweetness to balance the dry smokiness would be nice."
"Pours deep brown with reddish hues. Nice two finger tan head. A nice aroma off the top of smoked sausages (I never thought the smell of sausage would be good in a beer). First sip is very nice, a hint of sweetness followed by a lemon sharpness. The flavor in the beer mellows as the beer warms. The drinkability is ok, very filling, I don't think I could drink more than one. When all is said and done, an extremely tasty brew."
"This one will definately be revisited, interesting I think. I was expecting something on the lines os smokey scotch whisky, which I love (think Lavagulin or Talisker). The smell was promising, just enough smoke with malts. All I get on the pallete is smoke, like a barbecue or smokehouse, or my fireplace. I would probably enjoy aout 4 oz of this at the right time. To me this is definately not a quaffer. I will try it again paired with food."
"Pours a orange-tinted amber topped by a just not-quite-white head as you'd expect from a classic marzen. One has to prepare for the smoky aroma with a hint of malt. It was disconcerting until I thought of the smokiness I'd expect from a nice single-malt Islay scotch or a smoked, dry-aged Schwarzwalder ham. With that in mind, the smokiness is a nice rich flavorful smoke that complements the marzen remarkably well. Unlike some other flavored beers, this one does not skimp on the base beer. The melanoidin maltiness comes through the cloud of hardwood campfirey smoke and smooths the edges of the smoke and light hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is typical marzen, and while it would otherwise be a dangerously drinkable beer, the smoke flavor would wear out its welcome."
"Drinkability: I had about two sips before my carcrash fascination wore off and I pushed it back to my friend."
"A powerful beer, not something for everybody, but something that's worth seeking out. I will definitely be drinking this again."
"Drinkability? It's a rauchbier. An occasional indulgence at best, but an enjoyable one when you do go there."
"Overall, this is an interesting style. I like the smoked flavors and aromas, but I would be hard pressed to drink more than one of these unless maybe I was trying to finish a honeybaked ham."
"I purchased this bottle in Bamberg after visiting the brewery. Pours a dark ruby red with big clingy head. Smoke aroama is very present but not offensive. After a few swigs one becomes acostemed to the smoke and you can tell this a very good marzen. Nicely balanced malt falvor with a hop bitterness. I had this beer with some smoked salmon and it was fantastic. Very easy drinking and pure joy to consume."
"My first ever smoked beer, and I'm not really sure what to say... I have nothing to compare it to, so this review is a little more different than usual... Appearance-wise, this strongly resembles a stout, although not entirely as dark... A brownish-cocoa color that pours with a nice head... Smell is very smoky, as would be expected from what is called a ""smoked beer""... This definitely does taste very smoky, with a distinct smoked flavor dominating the palate... Tastes somewhat liked smoked fish... and is very different from anything I've ever sampled... An interesting brew that certainly deserves recognition for its unique aroma and flavor... This is a good brew, but not sure if I'd want to drink more than the 1.09 fl. oz. that the bottle provided, as the taste can be somewhat overpowering at times... All in all, definitely worth a try and very unique..."
"this one however tastes rather like a light stout (good dryness) with some smoked ham addition .... I am having it with some black forest ham ... just a delicious pairing ..."
"D - Any more than one in a session would be too much but it's a top notch beer that I would recommend to someone wanting something different to the usual fare."
"D: I love a Rauchbier and this is top notch"
"Finally, there's a bit of an acidic of even iodine note in the very back of the flavor. Of the two, I prefer the Marzen, but both are great. No yeast in this bottle either."
"25 oz bottle from The Lighthouse in Manchester. Dark brown-red translucent body with a good half inch of off-white head. Smells malty, peaty, and smokey. Tastes malty at first, but quickly goes to peaty and ashy... For the style, this is spot-on, and I suspect it'd pair greatly with a smoked Gouda or pork sausage. As it is, it's a bit overwhelming by itself for my taste. Nevertheless, nearly flawless and well-crafted for sure. It is what it is..."
"Wow. I have to keep in mind that I'm reviewing this beer with the strict consideration of its style. I didn't think that a smoked flavor would mix well with beer but I am somewhat surprised here.I make my own jerky in a smoker and this beer also has the same kind of odor as smoked beef and venison. This beer does an excellent job of being what it's supposed to be.The beer has a nice dark reddish/gold appearance with thick off-white/dark yellow head and lots of lacing. It almost tastes just like my jerky as well minus the spicyness. But there's also a sweet kind of malt flavor as well. Maybe a little nutty, too? Not too thick, nor weak. Just right. This seems to be to be a special kind of beer that you only have one of as a treat while watching Family Guy and eating sharp cheddar cheese before you go to bed. I like this beer WAY better than the first time I had it about five or six years ago. Much better than I remember. Very good rauchbier."
"D: I never keep more than a bottle in my place because that is all you need. One of these is a nice departure but I could never envision myself having more than one. Definitely different a worth a try though."
"500 ml bottle from Bevmo. This beer pours a very dark bark brown, with a cream colored head that slowly dissipates. The aroma is very strong with smoke and roasted malts. Flavor is very smoke forward, there is a character of smoked kielbasa, bacon, coffee and some earthy notes. Hops are well integrated and barely noticeable(no surprise considering the strong smoke flavor). The mouthfeel is silky but thin, carbonation is light but adequate. Finishes long with more smoke flavor. Overall I really like this beer, it has big bold flavors. Recommended"
"D: The classic smoke flavor of Schlenkerla is one that most seem to either love or hate. Personally, I enjoy the complexity and flavor it brings forth, transforming an everyday Marzen into a smoky delight."
"Taste of smoked sausage and smoked fatty fish. A light bitter combined with a maltbitterness on top of a light maltbase. The smoke sets the character of this beer and although the smoke is not sharp or burned, it lays a small layer of smoke in my mouth. Body is quite thin and carbonation is low. Aftertaste is lingering smoke."
"S: This is a very rich beer that should be a one-per-night sort of thing. I can't see myself drinking a lot of this at all. It drinks fairly slowly because of the richness."
"was cooking out today & keeping in the spirit, decided to do a rauch; this beer pours a dark copper color w/ a slight head that dissapates quickly decent lacing; a smoky sweetish aroma, hard to tell whats under the smoke, but it is pleasant; more smoke here w/ some hop flavor, a slightly caramel note; nice med body, clean finish w/ a smokey aftertaste that gently lingers, not overpowering at all, tho it gets a bit much towards the end; this beer went well with my brats & hots and is a very drinkable rauch indeed..."
"I really like the beer. Incredibly drinkable. Smoke is not overpowering at all. The malt sweetness and light hop twang add complexity. I am a big fan of anything smoky, and this beer is no exception. Had with some BBQ chicken wings and sharp cheddar, which made a very nice pairing."
"Mouthfeel was a bit chewy, lingering on the tongue for a few seconds. A good beer, certainly worth a try, but not sessionable by any means."
"I think I've found a new favorite! This smells like a good ol' southern bbq! Very porky/beefy aroma and a very smooth taste. Super dark, super rich and a wonderful treat. I can't even describe it, but I defintely spent about 10 minutes with my nose buried in the glass just enjoying the smell. This beer is a true masterpiece!"
"D - Could anything possibly be better with a sausage and cheese plate? I love rauchbiers...in fact, it's one of my favorite styles and this is a prime example of how drinkable a rauchy can be. Although I like the more powerful and assertive Urbock, this one is slightly more drinkable although much less complex. I need to do a side by side tasting of all the Aecht-Schlenkerla rauchbiers with a big ass give box of all of those cheeses and sausages from Swiss Colony. That would be heaven."
"First taste: Overwhelmingly rich flavor takes over the palate. This beer is huge on taste.. Besides being smokey there is a bitterness like walnuts which ends with a big grain flavor. In a way I wish there was more to say about this beer but the simplicity and notable balance in it's character speak for itself."
"Highly recommended - a true tasting experience with brew craftsmanship to be awed."
"Drinks very easy, great raucshbier, a little more restrained (for better & worse) than the urbock, yummy!"
"The first taste is incredibly strong, in both a good and bad way. It truly pleases the taste buds and is quite smooth, but the smokiness of the beer somewhat overpowers any other tastes at first. After a few sips, the flavor starts to mellow a little bit and the beer's fullness truly comes through. All in all, it's not necessarily a beer I would search out, and certainly one to drink too many of, but a tasty beer nonetheless."
"The beer is recognizably well crafted and skillfully balanced... still, it can be a little overwhelming - off-putting even - on first try. It is perhaps the most acquired taste of all beer styles. It took me a bit of time to appreciate Rauchbiers, but I love them now. And those brewed by Brauerei Schlenkerla are unquestionably the best out there. Whether you end up loving or hate it, trying Rauchbier promises to be a unique experience."
"Taste is wildly earthy and untamed, like the outdoors. Campfire smoke, and more smoke, sausage, some sweet malty caramel notes to balance, heathery sweetness as well. Some cocoa bitterness and lots of woody flavour as well with a good crackery malt base. Mouthfeel is awesome with a smooth, soft water feel, mellow, carbonation is just spot on, very mild and subtle. Light sticky driness in the finish, but creamy in the mouth. Well done, and I wish I had access to this beer in MB, it's just a natural pairing for so much good Eastern European food!"
"Had this one at a friend's beer-tasting session. First one on the list. Appearance is brown with a smallish head, a light touch of lacing. Nose is bacon, tons of of smoked malt. Likewise, the taste is smoked malt. Interesting, cause it's highly smoked but also very smooth. Meat flavors come through also. Almost no hops. Medium body. A tasty and unique one."
"Deep brown and clear with reddish and burnt orange highlights. Fine beige foam settled quickly to a thick ring and thin layer of bubbles. Sticky, fine lacing. Smells like a combination of a camp fire and smoked meat. Really burnt and smokey. Mild bitterness with plenty of sweet malt, notes of caramel and brown sugar before the smokey flavour kicks in at the finish. Lightish body with moderate carbonation, solid mouthfeel. Although the smoke is strong in the aroma, it's really balanced nicely in the flavour. Rauchbiers really aren't my thing, but this one has a nice balance that I like without sacrificing the smoke. Still, it smells like smoked bacon. Maybe next time I should try it with Sunday brunch?"
"Drinkability is higher than I would have thought. I can see drinking a few of these on a winter night in Bamberg. Nice beer, nice style."
"D: Obviously a true smoked beer is going to suffer at least a little on drinkability. But, for the style, its unexpectedly smooth."
"Appearance is a rich dark brown with a thin head that dissapates quickly. Aroma has a lot of definate smoke, reminds me of smoked ham. Tastes like it smells, woody and smoky. Mouthfeel is more on the lighter side with good body. A good one to try if you like smoked meats or just to experience a good German smoked beer."
"This is a great representationn of a smoke flavor in its proper place that enhances a beer's flavor rather than act as a cheap gimmick. Would pair well with some salmon, but would have difficulty holding up against most BBQ sauces. Definetly worth a try especially if you've never given a rauchbier a go."
"[ serving type: bottle ]"
"The rauchbier is the style that could easily be horrible if ill-tuned, but this one is right on the money."
"Set a pile of old clothes on fire, extinguish it with a bucket of water and drink the runoff."
"D. Not great. However, over in Germany is was often said that you must have more than one. Follow the first with a shot of schnapps and then it gets better."
"Another excellent rauchbier from the masters of smoked beer. There's not much more to write, other than drink some!"
"Pours a very dark reddish hue. Looks black until you hold it up to the light. Solid 2 inch off-white head leaves free form lacing while making a hasty exit. The aroma is almost exclusively of smoked meats. Like jerky and smoked salmon. More powerful than I had anticipated. But I like it. The taste is the same. Very smoky, and all I can think about is how much I love smoked salmon. This beer brings back memories that have nothing to do with beer. I like that. There is some definite hop bitterness in the middle, and I don't get any sweetness until the very end. Very interesting brew. Love the smoke, but there is something in the aftertaste that I wish would just leave me alone. Something in there just doesn't belong, imo. There is also a slight abrasiveness on the tongue. But this is still a very good beer, and I'd definitely purchase it again if my smoke-tooth starts harassing me again. Can't help but wonder what a touch of this could do for a nice homemade bbq sauce. Or maybe a marinade. Overall, I'm impressed."
"to go with the Rauchbier the last time. Shrug..."
"D- This is the ultimate beer to enjoy with barbeque. As with the style, I think it should be enjoyed sparingly and correctly. Highly recommended."
"Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Marzen was a mahogany in color with an off-white head. The head had decent retention and left some lacing. The aroma was dominated by smoke. The taste was sweet malt with plenty of smoke with some bitterness towards the long, smoky, dry finish. It was medium bodied with fairly mild carbonation. Drinkability was good. It's a nice beer with a good smoke flavor. It's definately worth a try."
"-Oelergud"
"D= Depending on one's desire to let this go a bit flat for a while and then drink it slightly warmed down, it's super and could even be a nice session-beer if one could afford it."
"I've had smoked beers, not even rauchbiers, that smell all too much of spent wood or ashcans. Not here though, as the smoke is deep, rich, and woody, delivering the notable edge of controlled combustion. On it's own, it's fairly drinkable, but with virtually any assertively savory food, it becomes a luscious companion. So I'll split the difference and say it's plenty good. And the whole time, it's like you're drinking a pint of brewing history."
"Overall, I like it, I think it would go well with some game meat. Stronger flavoured cheeses like an aged white chedar too. Or with kielbasa."
"My first German rauchbier, and I'm hooked. As for drinkability, you feel like you have gotten your protein for the day with just one, but it goes down very easy. Would drink lots if I could afford it."
"T/M/D- This a really unique mouth feel....big round and smooth malts....the beer is extremely easy to drink, medium bodied and filling...smokey and meaty almost a liquid beef jerky feel...It is really unique and wonderful....if you don't like it on first taste you will appreciate it when you finish the bottle. Not something for everyday, but definitively something I will return too."
"D: If I want a smoky-tasting beer, i'm going for this one. Really, it's like no other beer I've had; even smoked malt porters come nowhere near this. I wouldn't have this all the time, but would definite recommend it for a try (under the premise that it's S-M-O-K-Y)."
"It boured a sparkling red color with a medium amount of head from a mini-keg. It had a salty, smokey, meaty smell. It was downright bacon-like in flavor, but I wish had more beer character. I felt the beer-flavor in this beer was totally overwhelmed by this bacon flavor. It had a salty mouthfeel, like a mouthful of seawater. Not very drinkable."
"Overall drinkability: this is one of my favorite beers. Most people either love it or hate it. If you enjoy smoked foods and don't mind this flavor in your beer then this is one to try. Typically I will have no more than one in an evening as any more seems like too much of a good thing..."
"The smell is very interesting and unique, but it doesn't translate as well into the flavor. Still nice and enjoyable, but a bit excessive at times. (I'd rather be eating that smoked ham right now!) Nevertheless, I still think that this is definitely a beer worth trying. And I'd consider having it again, especially when I had some discerning friends over."
"This is coming from someone who loves black licorice, so take that as you will. If you don't like Schlenkerla, that just means more for ME!"
"Oh god...what was I thinking. This is a smokebeer. I don't know I didn't catch that before. I smelled and tasted like bacon. I am not a fan of bacon. The pour was ok. It was a light brown really. However, the hint of smoke or as I call it bacon was just over powering. After my first sip I was tempted to pour it out. However, I stuck it out and was left with the same feeling. It wasn't that good."
"Pours a dark brown color, nice carbonation, nice two finger creamy head which lasts a long time, nice sticky lacing throughout the drink. The nose is malty, smoked big time, toffee, and caramel. The taste is malty, smokey, with nice touch of caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, the taste reminds me of sardines, so because of this I would not buy again."
"500ml bottle purchased from LCBO in Toronto. Pours a clear, medium brown with no head and a bit of carbonation. Aroma reminiscent of a smoky fireplace. Taste is of malts, quickly replaced by a smoky aftertaste, which is not as dominating as I was fearing. The beer went down pretty nicely in the end, and I must admit I was a bit terrified about drinking this one based on some of the reviews I read. On the other hand, my wife just told me that I smell like cigarettes. Not my cup of tea (or pack of smokes), but interesting to try. Would love to see what their smoky weizen is like."
"B'ham UK"
"Taste follows through with the nose, although there is a rich porter-like quality of mild hops, barley, and molasses. Mouthfeel is excellent. Full, creamy without being cloying, and smooth without being watery. Drinkability is high, although this style might not agree with everyone, and I think about 1 beer will do it for me because of the intensity. For the style, though, this is a very good 'bier.'"
"Pours mahogany/red with a loose ring of a head on it. Jerky and smoke odor is weaker than expected. Taste is spicy, meaty beef and smoked gouda. A little bitter. Kind of like drinking water that several cigars have been extinguished in (if you can imagine that in a good way). Drinkable because its interesting enough to keep drinking it but not too weird to make you want to stop."
"Dark cloudy brown pour, small bubbly head. Aromas dominated by a citrusy hickory smokiness- some malt present but fleeting. Taste was surprisingly fruity- great malt flavor in the background while the smoke wasnt overdone. No unpleasant aftertaste, though I would have liked some more hop flavor to balance the malt. Almost like a stout in its mouthfeel- smooth, silky and slightly carbonated- very easy going down but like most most smoked beers the palate suffers from overload after a few of these."
"Dark but translucent, with nice red and brown hues. Slight head. Nose is smoky, oily malts. Taste is pleasant, like nice roasted coffee beans and toasted smoky malts. Mouthfeel is good, and so is drinkability. Good beer for the style. I'd like to marinate some fish in this stuff."
"The taste is sweet and smoky at the same time. It reminds me of the smoked salmon you get in slices at home. I suppose this would go with a cuisine like that, or to balance out a sweet dessert."
"Taste is liquid jerky, a bit of alcohol. Chewy, yet smooth. Is not as thick as it looks or smells. Drank very well. Good for pairing with grilled meats, I'd imagine"
"Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Marzen pours a dark copper color with a tan head from a brown 50 cl bottle. The aroma is dominated by smoke. The flavor is also quite smoky, as one of my friends put it, it tastes like the drippings from a barbeque. That may be a bit of an exageration, but it sure is smoky. I think you either like this beer or you don't, there probably isn't a lot of room to be on the fence on this one. I like it, if you like smoke beers, this is definitely one you should try."
"Drinkability is quite good and this is the one Rauchbier I would suggest for someone new to them or even for a BMC drinker. Probably a perfect Barbecue beer; cook with the Urbock and drink this one."
"Pours out a clear brown that turns more rusty when put to the light. Head is far from exceptional, but is made up of a series of fine bubbles. Smell is initially of smoked ham, but underneath it all is malty and clean like a good lager. As with the aroma, with the taste, the flavor is at first a punch of smoke, but there is depth to the malt that holds its own. Bready and nutty with a faint noble hop appearance. Finishes clean with a nice bitter kick. Mouthfeel isn't very heavy and the carbonation is mellow. Great session. I like this way better than the Urbock."
"This is the most drinkable Schlenkerla that I've tried so far and my favorite rauchbier to date. This paired very well with some pepperjack cheese but I'm really looking forward to bringing it along to a BBQ."
"D: An easy-to-drink beer, the smoke is a nice finish that does not overpower the tastebuds."
"A nice beer to drink in front of a fireplace or just to get in a ""rustic"" mood."
"This beer pours a clear ruby red color. The head is three finger in height, and recedes very slowly into thick lacing. The aroma is like a camp fire, all smokey and warm. The taste isn't nearly as smokey as the aroma, but is still heavily so. The smoke, however, is balanced out nicely my malt. The mouthfeel is a touch lighter than medium bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this is a fine rauchbier that I will certainly have again."
"i'll have another."
"drinkability is good. i think the smoke beer is a bit of an acquired taste, and probably not for everyone, but i'm enjoying it."
"Overall this would go good with some smoke cheese and some beef. Unless you like smoke beers, this is a try beer."
" Wavz"
"Drinkablity: It's awesome. Not the most drinkable beer, but well worth a try."
"This also paired very nicely with homemade, smoked barbeque ribs."
"D: Easy to drink, perfect pairing with smoked meats, I love it with sausage like all other Heller-Trum rauchbiers."
"If you know what you're getting into, love barbecued food (enough to drink it), or want a completely new beer experience, try this rauchbier. Personally it was a little too much for me to handle, and has probably made me gun shy toward other rauchbiers out there. I'll stick to the American smoked."
"This is a beer that begs to be consumed with food. It's a most unique style. This would obviously pair well with smoked foods like salmon, BBQ ribs and grilled sausage. The style is probably an acquired taste and I think it takes a few times to ""get it"". But once you do... wow, it's amazing."
"Drinkablity: This is one unique brew , and a superior example of the Rouchbier marzen style. This beer would pair great with smoked fish like mullet or grilled shark steaks , as well as any smoked or meats grilled over wood coals."
"The clerk at Grapes and Hops where I picked this up said (of this beer) that ""you either love it or hate it. I'm kind of ambivilant about it."" I think I'm more in the like category. This is amazingly different and tasty, but not really for everyday consumption. I also feel a coronary coming on from just tasting this brew. Only for the adventurous (and carnivorous), but they shall be rewarded."
"This is a great accompaniment to a smoked sausage or other meats. A nice fall barbecue beer. I've had it alone, and it's good for what it is - can be a bit much, but to complement the right food, it's very good."
"While not a session beer, this will certainly make a regular appearance in my cellar. It's very drinkable, even with such a robust smokiness. This would be beautiful to drink while eating some rare beef..."
"Poured into my quasi-stange (a 14-ounce ex-plum jam jar). My bottle is labeled as containing 5.1% abv, a negligible difference from the 5.4% stated on this website. Clear dark russet with a lumpy cloud of khaki foam. Smells unmistakably like a toasted sandwich with shaved smoked ham and melty smoked gouda (God, I bet that sandwich would pair superbly with this beer). Deeper whiffs reveal a bit of a worty malt scent, but really the only aroma that matters here is the smell of meaty smoke. This smoked pork flavor powerfully introduces the taste and lingers throughout the middle of the sip, at which point the faint hops and bready malt flavor of the Maerzen beer comes through briefly. Then a rather strong mineral taste seeps in, lasts through the finish, and then disappears in a cloudy, smoky aftertaste that lasts about half a minute. Sticky webs of lacing hang about. After a bit, the smoke flavor takes on more of a ""been breathing through my mouth at a campfire"" character. Medium body, slightly chewy, overall dry mouthfeel. This is really unlike any other beer I've ever tasted. I've had smoked porters before, but they ain't got nothin' on the smokiness of this specimen. It's truly fascinating. It strikes me as something I'd only crave from time to time, and only on certain occasions. Nevertheless, I could see this beer really growing on some folks' palates and becoming a regular choice for everyday drinking. Simply put, a fascinating beer."
"This beer poured a very dark amber/brown with a thick tan head. It definitely smelled of sweet smoke and slightly malty. The taste is malty and sweet with a heavy smoke flavor. The mouthfeel is full but not chewy. This is far more drinkable than I was expecting in a smoked beer and Id consider it highly drinkable."
"It a very tasty beer, but I think it would be best to save this one for the right occasions. Not really a session beer."
"This beer is fairly dark and there was a thin head. The smell features the smoke flavor prominatly as does the taste. The style profile states this type of beer may taste like smoked meat and this is evident as well. This beer tastes like smoked salmon. The mouthfeel is fairly smooth and the drinkability is good. A very different type of beer."
"A clear, dark copper pour with some crimson highlights makes for a unique color. Fine, off-white head persists rather nicely. The dominant smell is of smoke--the real sort of wood smoke that evokes an open fire or heavily smoked bacon. Sweet malts peek through a bit as well. Taste starts out with a sweet maltiness that quickly bows to a smokiness that is full and rich but not overly assertive, especially for this style. Dry in the finish, with a pleasant crispness. The mouthfeel is nicely balanced for such an ""unbalanced"" beer--not too chewy or clingy but not too crisp to betray the malty foundation of the style. More drinkable than I would have expected, even when compared to beers outside the style."
"A good choice and certainly worth getting again. Not to mention this would make a premium marinade."
"This is my first ever Rauchbier and I have to say its a very unique style. It would most likely be an exellent choice to pair with a hearty, meaty meal."
"Overall, a very interesting beer. I wouldn't call it drinkable. Just too much smoke taste to drink too many. Also, very important to match with the right food. Certainly some BBQ or a good hamburger would work."
"Drinkability/notes: Excellent and very drinkable, the smoke notes are somewhat restrained, quite distinctive."
"Absolutley delicious. I have had quite a lot of the Ur-Bock, but this is by first Baptising in Märzen. I feel this smoke flavour profile is much, much stronger in this than the Ur-Bock. It poured about the same colour, a brownish - red bronze with a slight chill haze and off white head that dissolved in a few seconds leaving a lovely looking blanket of frost about the surface. Smell was camp fire smoke, bacon, and sweet malts such as one would expect from a good Oktoberfest bier such as Paulaner. Taste was more smoke and a bit drier than the Ur-Bock, with less sweet of a finish than the Ur-Bock, as well. I think I prefer this to the Ur-Bock, which unfortunately, I have easier access to than this. Mouthfeel is very smooth with a great weight to be a Märzen, even with the smoke. Rauchbier would easily be in my top five favourite styles, and I believe I just found my favourite rauchbier. Wunderbar!"
"Now I'm not usually a fan of marzens, but when it's coupled with this bombastic smoked flavor, it's much better (to me). The sweet, smooth, crisp marzen flavor definitely is there, but it's overshadowed by the smokiness which enhances it, I think. I'll definitely be trying more of these Rauchbiers in the very near future."
"Pours crystal clear mahogany with half inch of creamy head that slowly recedes to film and medium lace. Smells fragrantly smoky, a bit greasy, grainy. Light malt sweetness on the front of the tongue. Slightly chewy grains in the center. Finishes with very clean and appetizing smokiness that isn't overwhelming. The dichotomy between the smoke and cool clean finish is shocking at first, but quite mouth-watering after a few sips. Taste light and well-balanced between cream and carbonation. My favorite of the Heller-Trum beers so far. Delicious and easy-drinking."
"Mouthfeel is ultra-smooth with a nicely sweet malt backbone that is surrounded by the sensation of smoked ham bits that appear in Cambell's soup (Bean w/ Bacon comes to mind). I tried this about two years ago, and poured the bottle down the drain, considering it undrinkable. Fast forward to today, and I find it amazing. One of the smoothest beers I've encountered, while the smoke and malt sweetness pair nicely."
"Pours medium-to-dark brown wtih about 3/4-finger head. Only two apparent smells are dark roasted malt and smoked pork. You may think you dont want your beer smelling like meat but this ones kosher, believe me. Thin and watery on the tongue, moderate carbonation - the smoke flavor picks up immediately before youve even had a chance to swallow. Tastes almost entirely of smoky, roasted malt - almost no hop presence whatsoever (nor any trace of meat flavoring, thank Whomever). Altogether extremely smoky, but not in a ""burnt"" sort of way. I could probably drink a number of these in one sitting. Maybe not quite a session beer, but something that I can imagine myself jonesing for in the future."
"Mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side, but the drinkability is higher than I was expecting. This is only the second true Rauchbier that I've had, and I can't believe how good it is. I have a couple more different ones to sample, and now i can't wait to try them."
"Overall a fairly drinkable beer, quite drinkable for a rauch, and entirely inoffensive. Marzen, the Workingman's Rauchbier."
"Drinkable: Not as complex in development as the Schlenkerla bock, but this is definitely a drinkable and sessionable rauchbier. Lighter flavors showcase the smoke, but facilitate easy consumption. I prefer the flavor of the Urbock, but admire the easy-drinking agreeableness of this beer."
"a damn fine brew...worth a trip to bamberg on its own"
"($3.59 / 16.9 oz. wider brown Euro style bottle)"
"I sniffed, thinking that it was alot like smoked salmon, and took a sip. Not bad, like an overly smokey BBQ, with some tobacco and ashy backgrounds. Thought that it would require some more sweetness or complexity in there to make it more drinkable. Nice to sample, don't know if I'll be coming back to it. It would make an excellent backbone to a BBQ sauce."
"D - Really good stuff. Drank the second half of it with some smoked cheddar, which worked well. I could see how this would be great with bbqed meat."
"We did, however, put the beer to good use as a marinade for our barbecued chicken. Now that I can handle."
"This is great, I wish there were more smoked beers around. I've been drinking them up lately, but there arent many others. Guess I'll have to buy this whenever I want a smoke fix."
"Zum wohl! MK"
"Overall this is an interesting beer. I don't think I'd like to drink a lot of this straight up, however I think the flavors in this beer will be excellent to cook with."
"This pours a clear dark brown with a small tan head that disappears quickly. The smell is a smoked wood BBQ aroma that makes your mouth water. The taste is a mesquite wood BBQ. This is like liquid babyback ribs. Malt and molasses are also in this beer. It's almost like a bbq sauce. The m/f is medium with the flavors all mixing well. A wonderful tasting and smelling beer for summer BBQ's. Bring on the ribs."
"Overall I liked this beer fairly well. I'd recommend trying it at least once, and I'd love to have it again with some smoked baby-back ribs. Not something I'd want to enjoy over and over again, though."
"I rated drinkability as 3.0 only because I'm too much a virgin to drink more of this tonight...but I will try it again and probably re-rate when my tongue grows up."
"The mouthfeel is"
"overall- ive been really anxious to try a rauchbier since i love the smoke flavors in beer. I was not dissapointed at all. However, i was dissapointed that i didnt pick up the other two versions of this beer. While this may not be everyones favorite beer, its definitely unique and something every beer lover should at least try."
"Drinkability: I won't finish this bottle. This is either a taste I have not yet acquired, or the beer itself just isn't enjoyable enough. I'll likely try the style again in the future to see if I like it more, but this one is mediocre at best."
"Hand carried back from Kansas City, MO."
"And if you do get some make sure you buy an extra bottle to cook with. The lady friend is making some BBQ sauce as we speak with it that's awesome!!!"
"The first taste was good, but it did not taste as smokey as it smelled. It had a nice malt flavor with little to no hops. It was thicker than normal, and had a fairly nice mouthfeel. The smell and the taste just seemed very different. Should give it a try if you have never had a smokey beer, it is very interesting."
"Overall- As far as smoked beers go, this one kicks ass. I can't say I've had one like this. Definetly worth trying at least for the novelty of it."
"Drinkability: When I first took a sip of this, I thought, man... this is good, but I'm not sure I can finish it! But the more I drink, the more I like this. I wouldn't mind having another, and I really look forward to pairing this with meats."
"D: Still VERY smokey. A little overwhelming. I couldn't drink many of these."
"Give this one a try!!"
"Mouthfeel is medium to full. Not as heavy as its sister beer. Drinkability is excellent. The lighter mouthfeel and meaty smoke flavor makes this one unique and highly quaffable. I really like this, just don't know how often I'll pick it up. I've been sitting on this one for a while."
"I paid just under $3.00 for a 1 pint 9 oz bottle, and poured it into a pint glass. It looked kind of like an English brown ale, reddish brown and clear with a thick tan foam on top. But the smell was way different. Smelled like a camp fire more than anything, but also a little like smoked ham. It doesn't sound right for a beer, but it worked for me. Tasted smoky and malty, and was very carbonated. From now on I'll recommend everyone tries this at least once."
"Finally got my hands on a rauchbier. I saw their lager at the store and woulda bought it as well if I had known that so few people had reviewed it. Anyway, from a big German bottle into a German mug, it pours a rich, deep copper with very active carbonation and an inch of khaki head that consists mostly of small bubbles and retains a quarter inch throughout, leaving some nice patches/rings of lace. The aroma is very smoky from the beginning - I can smell the wood they used, and the aroma reminds me of a good smoked meat or cheese. By the end there are notes of faint hops and clean malts, and the smoke seems to be sweeter, if that makes sense. The first sip kickstarts my bacon craving, which by end becomes a smoked salmon craving. The taste is highly smoky at the start with notes of spices, but I soon find notes of faint coffee and green, almost citric hops with a mild to medium bitterness that intensifies as I progress, as does a tobacco flavor which leaves the taste of chaw in my mouth. The mouthfeel is medium to full, and incredibly smooth and creamy for a lager, leaving a long finish that makes me want another bottle. It is surprisingly drinkable, as I was a bit hesitant of the style, but it is a wonderful beer that is totally unique to my palate. I must try their other offerings. A great deal at under $4 a bottle."
"I have been pretty fearful of smokebeers until now, and it turns out that this one, at least, is better than I'd hoped. Yes, it has a frightening smell of smoke and meat, but it's surprisingly quaffable! :)"
"Verdict: A very tasty example of a unique style. Recommended."
"D: After hearing a lot of buzz about these beers in the forums, I've finally popped my rauchbier cherry, and couldn't be happier. The character of this beer is incredibly unique. I'm drinking this beer by itself now and loving it, but I can't wait to try this with something off the grill."
"Pours a clear mahoganey with ruby edges and a small, light tan head. Smell...hmmm...woah! The nose is smoked bacon on a crisp Canadian morning. I reckon with a side of eggs and some strong coffee we'll be able to hunt moose and fish walleye all day. Amazingly strong smoked meat aromas. Faint caramel malt in there, but the smoke covers all else. Luckily, I like smoked meats. Smoked prosciutto flavors greet the mouth, alongside caramelized carrots and faint malt sweetness. Ham and campfire smoke throughout. More sweetness detectable in the long smoky finish. Medium-bodied with a surprisingly lively feel. Not liquid smoke, just really smoky and delicious beer!"
"This one is awesome...""on tap"" from a 5 liter mini-keg that was $22 at Shangys in Emmaus. This one kicks ass. Dark amber in colour with a lovely cascading head of foam that lasts and is thick and rich in itself. Aromas of smoked malts, and all things smoke as well as fruity balance and intriguing malt complexity. Sure its smoky but it is most certainly not one dimensional. Taste is smoky, fruity, and malty, with a nice bread character to it as well. Drinkability is AWESOME! Mouthfeel is medium bodied and lovely with very lively carbonation. I love this beer and this brewery very much these days!"
"Flavor is smokey and meaty. Salty too. Almost chewy. More than one of these would make me taste terrible... poor Anna. But still very palatable. All the flavors really linger in the mouth and I can still taste it well after the sip. Very full flavor--kind of takes over the head. I'd be wary of getting to close to the girlfriend after drinking one of these, but still quite tasty."
"Moderate pour into my 23 ounce pilsner glass yields a nice 2-finger off-white head over a clear mahogany body. Head fades to a solid ring with nice lacing. Aroma of smoked malt, deer sausage, some piney hops, toasted sourdough bread, smoked almonds. Fascinating. The taste is a nice Marzen light bitterness, with some floral hop notes. The smokiness is not as pronounced as in the aroma (or as in the Rauchbier Urbock): it's more in the background. Nice toasted malt notes, with some pine hops, then the smoke is in the aftertaste. Very pleasant. Mouthfeel is clean and crisp like a Marzen should be. At 5.4%, this is very drinkable, but I lowered the mark because of the price."
"I am really happy that my friend put this in my cart at the beer store. This is a fantastic brew. I love BBQ and think this would pair fantastically with some good slow smoked BBQ pork ribs. But the beer tastes like a meal in itself though too. I wish they carried this at Dinosaur BBQ. I will definitely seek out more beers of this style."
"Great stuff, this Rauchbier !!"
"D - As delicious as this is, it's way too heavy to be any kind of session brew. A special occasion, show-off-to-your-friends sort of beer. Also,hard to find around here."
"This is a fun beer! Rich smokey aroma and flavor. Not for the faint at heart. Makes me think of NC BBQ(Eastern). Great food beer, especially with smoked meats. Not something to quench your thirst with after mowing the lawn. Don't be a wuss, go try this beer."
"Drinkable, but I can't imagine drinking many of these, and only with the right food."
"Surprisingly complex. Really a lovely beer!"
"A better understanding of the style would probably give me a greater appreciation for this beer."
"This has to be the most fascinating things i've ever had. Being the first Rauchbier i've had, i'm very very fascinated. This looks good, dark brown with a nice amount of lacing. Smell is like, campfire. With hints of a smoked sausage, totally delicious. Taste is absolutely phenomenal. This would go so so well with a side of summer sausage. carbonation is just right and delivers the aromas just perfectly. Drinkability is pretty good, but for some the aftertaste might be a bit too much. Personally this ranks among the best i've ever tasted. Very unique and quite flavorful. I'm getting some of these next time I have a barbecue."
"Overall - An exceptional example of this style. Highly recommended !!"
"It's better to state this from the beginning: I prefer my cured meats on the side and not in the brew. The rauchbier poured with two fingers of beige foam. It has a nice brown color and smells of cured meats and burned wood. The taste is smokey, of cured meats and some metal with a bitter bite of hops in the end. It has a creamy mouthfeel although it feels a bit weird to drink. I think it is an interesting beer but drinking it will never be a habit of mine."
"I have had this many times before, but each time it is such an intense experience. Poured a nice deep brown with a slight head which dissipated fairly quickly. But of course the aroma and taste are the headliners here. I always associate this with the smoked gouda I love, only more intense. I think the smoked flavor overwhelms the other elements slightly in this one- there's probably a better balance in the urbock version- but I guess that's the point. The carbonation acts well with the high-medium texture to make it an enjoyable treat in moderation. I would probably only drink one, ideally paired with a big tray of sausages and cheese."
"I am enjoying this with a bit of smoked turkey on oregano triscuits; perfect combination I must say. Would definitely go well with smoked bbq sandwich or smoked kilbasa sausage."
"This is one incredible beer. Reminds me of my German heritage!"
"one of the worlds finest range of brews, and this is one of the picks of the bunch. in my book, you havent really drank beer until youve had at least one of these beauties, whether you end up liking it or not. in my all time top 10 easy."
"It's ok. Looks good, smells pretty much as expected etc etc. In general, an interesting rauchbier, but not distinguished enough for me. Just better than average in most regards, but still just a run of the mill brew as far as I'm concerned."
"Drinkability: Well, you either dig the smoke or not. This was my first Rauchbier, and I love the change of pace. I can really appreciate this style, however wouldn't picture myself drinking more than a couple of these just yet."
"I didn't drop the drinkability of this beer too much, since it's supposed to taste like it does, but I sure couldn't drink a lot of them (or even more than one, really). Definitely worth trying, but I don't think I'm a big fan, and I definitely prefer the lighter, more complex Bieropholie Calumet (reviewed earlier)."
"A very nice and well-balanced Rauchbier. A bit tame for the style--I'd give it to someone who's never had a smoky beer before to help ease them in."
"I think every BA should try this one (or a comparable Rauch). It's about broadening our experiences, afterall. The taste might be jarring at first, but I think that once you get over the initial shock, you'll realize that it's a reasonably smooth beer."
"Drinkabilty: I like the smoked taste, but I don't know if I could drink more than one of these at a time. Very good nonetheless."
"The flavour was a little dissapointing compared to the smell. Sure, it was very smokey, with a rich malty almost caramel character to it, but just not what I was expecting. Had a nice lingering malt and smoke flavour, with the smoke dominating, very easy drinking. Sadly, not as good as Rauchenfelser. On the funny side, the bar manager came out to see if we were enjoying our meals, sees that Tease is drinking the Rauch, and says something like ""Wow, you're brave, a very strong flavoured beer, I'm not too keen on it myself", but with more of a German accent."
"Enjoy the coming Autumn with many of these great beers."
"Here, it will smack you in the head. So it's very much a matter of taste. Personally, I love it."
"Slàinte!"
"Very enjoyable--more so that Aecht's other smoked beers. The Marzen displays a solid but subtle base for displaying the aromas and flavors of the smoked malt without competing with them. Smells like beef jerky. Tastes like beef jerky (when chased with a Marzen beer). Aftertase is basically the same. All characteristics show a moderate level of sweetness and smoothness that makes it incredibly easy to drink. Low alcohols keep this beer from becoming harsh or too soy sauce-like. Nice campfire aura about it. I do recommend, even though I'm not terribly fond of the style."
"The best smoked beer I've ever had, I prefer a little less smoke than this but why would I complain, most of the flavors are hidden by the smoke, and there is a smooth finish for session status."
"This beer felt good in the mouth, tasted intesting and good, and went down nicer than I could have ever before imagined. Hurrah. The Germans do it once again."
"drinability, is for me, limited, the smoked novelty seems to wear off fast, and, I just couldn't make this a session beer, it is unique, and interesting though, and I would certainly recommend tryin it out!...."
"So if you like meat really bad you will like this one."
"Smokebeer? interesting name on the top label had me intrigued. Poured into a pilsener glass the head was white and lacked lacing but the color was a nice dark red to brown and filtered. Big Smoked jerky smell / malty/ bit of coffee/caramel porter type background. The taste was very new to me. This is the last of the 6 bottles I picked up recently and I've had the same feeling each time I gobbled one. The smoke flavour is nicely crafted and not too overbearing but it would be tough to drink more than one of these at any one time. I found it went nicely with some pepperoni sticks and sharp tilamook cheese w/ crackers."
"The beer pours a dark amber/brown color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It smells like beef jerky. I can't get enough of these beers! The taste is great as well. It has a deep, smokey flavor that's laid over pale and crystal malts. It goes down smooth with a dry lager yeast finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn fine beer. I love the aroma and taste. I wish this style was more available; a good drinker."
"Definitely, along with its brothers the Urbock and Weizen, the gold standard for the German rauchbier. There's no doubt as to the nature of this beer...smoke and lots of it, but it still manages to have a nice balance of sweetness. Quite nice, and one I will have again"
"drinkability: so drinkalbe. First Raunch and i'm oh so ready for more(a trip to bamburg). wish i could find it easier and wish it wasn't 4.50 a pint bottle, but hey i will get this again( and try to bock) after a day of DIPA drinkng yesterday, this is so refreshing and easy to drink it's bringing a smile to my face. to me it wasn't hard to get into at al .... .. i loved the first sip!"
"This was my first-ever rauchbier. I had no idea what to expect when I opened the bottle. Poured a chocolate brown. A slight head bubbled up, disappearing after a few seconds. It smelled like a smokehouse, and had a slight taste of bacon. I'd imagine that this would be great with a quality piece of gouda cheese. Not something that I'd like to drink every day, but it's worth trying."
"drinkability: certainly easier than some other smoky brews"
"Cant wait to try the others from Aecht."
"Overall: Relatively drinkable and not so smoke-laden that the other characteristics of the brew didn't come out as it warmed a bit. I'm not sure the style is for me, but it's worth trying once."
"This was so tasty and drinkable, i wish i could get this back home as I could see myself drinking this on a regular basis"
"It poured an almost black color but was a actually a dark brownish color. The beer had a small amout of foam that disappeared quicky and left just a small amount of lacing in the glass. The beer had a strong aroma of smoked meats with a just hint of sweetness. The smell will surprize you if you never had a Rauchbier before. This is a beer that tastes like it smells. You get plenty of that smoked meat taste with a small amount of sweetness that goes down smooth. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with some carbonation. You also will get a smoked meats aftertaste that lingers on after you drink it. This type of beer that is good for a once in a while treat, but not every day. This is a style of beer that every beer drinker should try for themselves."
"I paired this with some smoked salmon and avocado over field greens with a chinese style dressing and it was very satisfying."
"A wonderful beer. The next time I have one of these, it will be paired with some home smoked meat."
"Drinkability: This beer is just lovely. I suppose people either love or hate Rauchbiers. I love them. This beer alone made the confusing drive to Bamberg worth it. Excellent in all ways."
"Overall, this is a very interesting beer. I don't know that I'd order it if other favorites of mine were available, but within the style, well, this seems to be a very, very good rauchbier. AN excellent place to start if you want to explore the style."
"Drinkability: Not a style I could expect even existing, but oh so good. I'd definitely try another smoked beer, so it was an overall pleasant experience. Really I can't believe how much this beer tastes like meat. I had been told, but I didn't truly believe. Well this beer will definitely put hair on your chest."
"BB 24-6-05. This is how a rauchbier should be. Good presentation with yellowbrown head and darkdarkbrown beercolor. Nose is very smokey and with that maltycaramellic. Taste is as smokey as beer can be also and with that a fullness of taste. Sweetmalty, caramellic, citrussyfruity and roast all in one. After a while you think you were near a fireplase cause the smokey taste just stays forever. Great brew having also fine carbonation to make mouthfeel great and can't leave it by one so drinkability is also more then ok!"
"Pours a deep red with an off white head with some staying power. Aroma is smoky but not quite as smoky as expected. A little note of sweet malt is present as well, but pork bbq definitely dominates the nose. Taste is nicely balanced with some sweetness melding well with the smoke. Although this is not a smoke bomb like Lafayette Brewing Co's Smokehouse Porter, it does hit the spot when you're craving that campfire taste."
"Drinkability is very good, I had no trouble at all polishing off the 16ouncer in no time. Was very tasty paired with one of my favorite snacks - Triskets, Horseradish, and sharp chedder."
"As a smoker this beer was not that good. It looked like a dark beer, but lurking inside was smoked meat and sweet breads. Seriously, I had some smoked sweet breads down in Argentina and this beer reminded my of what they tasted like. It had a strong smoked smell of campfire clothes, odd but enticing. It had a bitter charcoal hit to it as well that was not pleasing and a little bracing. There is some underlying sweetness but you can only taste them after your buds are readjusted to the smoke. Not bad enjoyable at times but have some cheese or something to gnosh on to make it more enjoyable as I found out half way through the galss."
"Smooth, medium bodied mouthfeel flows over the palate so easily I almost forget I'm drinking it. An intensly drinkable brew that is refreshing and a nice change of pace. If you enjoy smoked beers this one should be on your list!"
"Ut Vivat, Crescat, Floreat!"
"A remarkable experience, and unforgettable beer."
"poured a nice ruby with light tan head that didnt last to long, but did have some lacing. smokey aroma and flavor. finish mouthfeel got dryness that I didn't care for to much.I am not much into smoke flavor of anything. so I did not enjoy this beer that much"
"Dark brown in colour with a medium amount of carbonation. The aroma is a full on blast of malt and woodsmoke. The tastes are of smoked meats and grainy malts. The body is fairly full, and there's just the slightest amount of bitterness to keep things in check. Perhaps not to everyone's tastes, but I love this stuff. It's one of my regular purchases (or at least ""will be", as I hear it is being de-listed by the liquor marts here in Manitoba)."
"Appearance is really dark, with absolutely no light penetration. The smell is very original, almost like BBQ pork... The taste is the same way. I have never tried a beer like this, and it's amazing. It is almost like BBQ sauce with meat. You can tell the smoke that went into this beer. Thats about all I can say about the taste, its that if you have never had a Rauchbier before, this will be a real treat."
"Pours a deep ruby brown with a big frothy white head. This beer smells like a midsummer pig roast; like a well seasoned brisket; bacon frying, Easter ham! The smoke is overwhelming, not even a hint of anything else. Magnificent. I didn't even want to drink this beer, just swirl it in the snifter for hours. Tastes just like the nose, all smoke with just a little sweetness and a subtle sort of metallic tang. Medium body fits this beer to a ""T". Highly drinkable in vast quantities."
"Who put sardines in my beer? The oily, smoked fish aroma is much stronger than it tastes and is quite pleasant after a few sips. After my first sip I wondered how I was going to finish the bottle, after my last, I wanted another bottle. Went great with a hunk of Jarlsberg cheese."
"It's creamy and smooth, very easy to drink, and the smokiness is readily apparent. It reminds me of eating jerky. It's a bit fruity, but not very sweet, and it's reminiscent of the less bitter bitters I've had. I like it a lot. At this point I really wish I were eating barbeque."
"Clear mahogany tone. Bubbly beige head. Lace is sparse. Bigtime smoke hits the nostrils up front. Like a smoldering campfire. It's huge. But I like it. And there's sweet malt tones on the nose as well. Sweet, sugary malt backbone. Smoke is placed everywhere you look. Thick cigar tar. Pipe residue. Oh yeah, there's a presence. This marzen base doesn't quite work as well as their bock base, but it's still good. The body is big and full. Carbonation seems appropriate and on the light side. Enjoyable."
"Acclaimed in Michael Jacksons Great Beer Guide it is said to pair well with smoked ham or sausages. If I could live my life over the one thing I would surely change was having Schlenkerla in place of the Lonestar with the succulant pig we roasted in S. Texas earlier this month. We followed this with Stone Smoked Porter - never thought I would find a Stone lacking in the flavor catagory. Never say never."
"The medium mouthfeel and carbonation make this a very drinkable brew, especially when paired with smoked salmon."
"Tastes meaty. Thin, but not lacking in flavor. Some buttery feeling. The smoke wafts across the scene: I'm sitting on the porch munching the last of the wrinkled apples that over-wintered in a barrel down cellar. The missus is frying up some early dandelion greens with bacon. I could till some compost into the garden plot, or I could sit back and relax with a good beer -- this beer. Tasty. Earthy. Mellow."
"Mouthfeel is full and creamy, with a medium body. I would like to try this beer on it's own, without food to see if it still tastes as good. I really enjoyed this one."
"The taste is actually much smoother than I expected. Drinks very easily and is refreshing. I really expected a beer that I could chew on. Some day I will go to Bamberg and try this on tap."
"Saw the bottle in the cooler and had to try it. A good looking bottle has to have good beer in it. Not at all what I had expected. I love Stone Smoked Porter. I figured since this was a German offering it had to be as good if not better. Alas, there are some things the Germans aren't good at. The pour looked real good, deep dark with a light head. The carbonation seemed nice. I'm not a fan of high carbed brews like Saisons. Then came the nose. Wow! I've thrown wet newspapers on a fire that had a better smell. A cross between Kipper snacks and smoked oysters. While I love both of those, that kind of smoke flavor doesn't work here. The taste, the same, that same nauceous smoke is on the tongue now. The mouth was extremely light. I had a hard time with this one so, needless to say, drinkability didn't impress me at all. I've had other smoke brews since, always going at them a little gun shy after this. However, none have been this bad. I'll stick to a Stone from now on."
"Drinkability: This is not a beer. It is a snack. Treat it with caution and enjoy."
"Thin mouthfeel, just washes around in your mouth - i was hoping for big and beefy, but at least it makes for good drinkablity, this could be a session beer."
"A dark ruby red/light brown in color; the aroma hits you like a vapor-rub. Dark roasted malts, chocolate are the undertones, a massive smoky-charcoal smell; invigorating and enjoyable, reminder of smoked salami or smoked ham. A clinging murky white head with some round patches also should be noted. Color me happy and ready. Malt based, yet nearly chewy, has some sweetness that is easily detectable. Smoky  unique flavors that leave you scratching  bacon, ham-like flavorings and even some caramel flavorings. The body becomes a bit spicy and sweeter towards the bottom of the pint glass. Medium bodied with yet more offerings  some dark, dark roasted malts and coffee beans as it warms to near room temperature. Enjoy at just below room temperature; complex, tasty and very enjoyable!"
"Drinkability and Overall: This not your average beer. If you want something new and different give this (or any Rauchbier) a shot. The smokiness is not for everyone, nor is it for everyday, but you're in the mood this beer could hit the spot. This is not a session brew, and I don't think it was meant to be one. This is a beer to ponder with."
"I tried this beer in a Brooklyn Beer House who had just gotten it on tap. Knowing little about Rauchbier; I was surely excited and loved the dark brown color of the brew when it was served; hardly any foam to show. The smell made me chuckle already, and the first zip made me shake. I thought I just ate pork-roast. It is surely unique; but definetly no drink you can enjoy an evening long. One with a harty meal would be all I can imagine!"
"A dark brown beer with amber highlights. Has a small off white head. There is a strong robust smokey aroma, like opening a pack of smoked meats, with a hint of sweetness in the back. The smokey flavor rolls smoothly over your tongue. The finish has a nice snap of hop bitterness."
"Pours a dark brown with a coppery red in the light. The head is thick and light tan, with ample lacing. Smell... Whoa! Smells like smoked sausage! I'm on a diet right now, and to smell something like this right now is wonderful. Very strong, could smell it from a foot away at least. Taste was definitely smokey, but lighter than expected. Some malts and quite a bit of hoppy bitterness as well, the finish is primarily smoked sausage... :) It's like I ate a plate of sausages, but I didn't... Mouthfeel was surprisely light and quite refreshing. I would drink this again... but not all day as long as this diet is going... :("
"Very good!"
"Very drinkable, especially late at night watching a good movie."
"This is not a brew to consume in mass quantities. I don't know if I'd enjoy this alone, but it compliments artisinal cheddar chees quite well."
"16.9 ouncer, poured a rich shade of almond, tan head, clear, malty smokey nose, taste here obviously is smokey. Basically tastes like a smoke house. Interesting, complex stuff, I doubt this brew is for everybody, but as I like smoked food, smoking foods and BBQ in general, I enjoy this stuff. I doubt I'd enjoy more then one or two."
"Very easy drinking and a nice rauchbier aroma, but the taste is lacking oomph."
"The mouthfeel was thinner than I expected but otherwise enjoyable. I couldn't make this a session beer without overdosing on the smoke, but I love the occasional journey into the rauchbier realm."
"By far my favorite of the Schlenkerla line. The Urbock is overwhelmingly smoky, and the Weizen is just light smoke with few hefeweizen notes. This is the most balanced of the beers."
"Cheers"
"Try everything."
"16.9 ounce bottle."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, where it formed a 1"" tan head over the dark reddish amber brew. Head is dense, and hangs around after half has dissipated, with good lacing. Aroma is all about da smoke. Smells like something well-smoked off the grill, which is cool, since it's always nice to get what the name advertises. Taste is surprisingly of sweet malts initially, and then the smoke aroma/taste comes on in. A pleasant turn of events, there's more to this one than meets the eye, err, nose. The main observation I am presented with is ""watery"". Mouthfeel and drinkability are both great for the style, which can sometimes take things a bit too far, and forget the whole idea is a drinkable end product. I am pleased to say this is one smoked beer I could revisit over and over."
"The beer poured a clear dark amber with a tan head. The smokiness was very apparent and even assertive, but not overwhelming. Enough to remind you of beef jerky or smoked sausage. The flavor follows along with the aroma. Smokiness throughout, yet it is not harsh and remains an easy drinking rauchbier."
"One inch of noisy, tan foam condenses. A clear, dark, red-brown beer: pretty. Smoked ham in the nose with sweet malt underneath. Smells just like winter nights growing up. Wow. The front is tangy and charcoaly. Middle is full with a little chocolate in the malt. Finish is smoky, meaty, grainsy, hoppy with a little sugar. Wow again. Delicious. The smoke is strong, but not intrusive. The malt is very nice (though it could be even more assertive, I think). I really enjoyed this one."
"A brown/gray color with a full tan head and sticky lace. Aroma is smoky sweet and earthy. Flavor is sweet, smoky and roasted. Palate is light bodied, with low effervescence and a dry and slightly acerbic finish. An interesting style with a decent balance of sweet, smoke and hops."
"This brew turns aroound my opinion about smokey beers. The ones ive had before were not as well done as this, great brew."
"Interesting to say the least, and this beer exceeded my expectations. That's the reason for the high rating, cause I really don't like rouchbier."
"Pours a copper dark brown clear color, with a quick tan head. Smells like mesquite chips. This is a great german beer that would go well with BBQ ribs or smoked turkey legs. Good smoked meaty smell. If you don't like the smell, go no further. I on the other hand love a good smoked meat, the taste of this beer did not let me down. Sweet, mesquite wood flavor. Slightly coffee aftertaste. Somewhat watery in texture, I thought it would be more like a stout. Makes me think of camping or burning leaves. Wouldn't just drink this beer alone. This is definetly a food beer. I hope this one or one similar is at the next german food tasting that I attend."
"Beer is good. Happy smokey beering."
"Amazing beer. Poured out to a dark brown colour, with a medium brownish white head. Medium low carbonation. Amazing smell; inital odor of sweet smoke is followed by hints of earth, malt and roasted hops. Flavor was like no other beer I have ever had. Strong flavor of smoke, with earthy overtones, with the nuances of bacon. Yum. When they say smoked beer, they mean it. Full mouthfeel is not a turn off, as it doesn't go down heavy or make you feel like there is a brick in your stomach. Maybe not an everyday beer, but nevertheless one of the greatest beers I think I have ever had. Highly Recommended."
"The mouthfeel is very smooth in this full bodied beer. The finish is of subtle smoked meat, which is actually really good. Who would have thought that a lager could be made to taste so full flavored? Such an interesting beer, and a refreshing change from the regular malt/hop ales. Ill get it again for sure. It goes great with beef jerky, which is what I ate with it."
"Drinkability? I'll drink it. But I feel like I should be eating beef jerky, too. Maybe it would be nice with a full country breakfast."
"Dark brown with heavy ruby influences, when held to a light it keeps its depth of color in the middle but it became shiny-ruby around the edges. The head was foamy and bubbly; at the apex it was a modest finger in height. The head retention was decent; it faded to a soapy collar, foamy in the middle with naked pockets, thicker on the outside. This collar lasted a very long time but the subsequent lacing was nonexistent. The first time I took a sniff of a Rauchbier I thought it was awful. Now, my mouth waters and I find the smoky aromas so damn inviting. The Marzen has some potent smells of smoked ham and bacon, charred fat, beechwood campfire smoke. Damn it is lovely, the complexities all fall into some general categories but it is undeniably complex. I swear at the very back is a suggestion of malt. Inviting. While the nose is loud, the palate is quit the conversationalist! The beer is perfectly balanced and so wonderfully constructed that it is a sin. The true smoky qualities are really only found in the aftertaste, it is like exhaling a fine cigar. Upfront is some ample maltiness, juicy. In the middle come the bacon, ham, and fatty flavors. I dont think they are quite as bold as they are in their Urbock, still if youre not use to the style it will still be a bit much for you, IMO. Somewhere after the meat and before the smoke is a fleeting moment of true Marzen maltiness. I am impressed with the bitterness in the finish, it seems more than just astringency from the roast maybe there are some hops (but most likely not). Regardless the palate is damn yummy. The mouthfeel is okay, I wish there was a little more bulk on the tongue and some more carbonation. Still with a medium body and moderately low carbonation I am not complaining. I purchased a bottle in Burnsville, MN. I will buy more in Iowa City or KC as I have learned to love the style. Wonderful. Bring on the BBQ!"
"John"
"You definitely have to like the Rauchbier style to like this one. Tastes really good, but not one I could slug back more than one of, it's just too smoky, especially in the finish, not very refreshing but a strong example of the style."
"for me, it's a once-in-a-while beer. not something i'd drink every day but it was definitely an enjoyable drink."
"I'm not sure how well ASRM would match up with really smoky BBQ. It seems to me that the powerful flavor of the food would render the somewhat more fragile flavor of the beer moot. Best to enjoy this one without accompaniment, as I'm doing now. I don't know yet if anyone makes a more impressive rauchbier, but I'm plenty satisfied with this one."
"What a deep amber colour. Beautifully dark and red with a white cloud floating atop it. Lots of sticky lace on the glass. Mesmerising to see. Hmm, barbecue. Smells a bit like smoked meat, with even a bit of ham smell. Odd for a beer, but it's making me hungry. Smoky malt sweet smell. Very slight hop aroma behing the ham. First sip tastes like roasted pork. Second sip, and it tastes like a beer. A beer smoked inside a meathouse beside salmon and whole ham. Almost a meal drink. Aftertaste is a bit hoppy, with more smoked salmon than ham. Odd, but nice. I can understand why people would hate this beer. Hey, some people don't want roasted swine in their beer. Thick, full bodied mouthfeel leaves the stomach pleasantly plump. Not drinkable in a short period of time, but something that will be drunk again."
"Definitely one to try."
"If you're not familiar with these Franconian rauchbiers, you owe it to yourself to try one. At least, enjoy reading this brewery's website for its informative and rewarding explanation of the style."
"Poured a rich reddish-copper (almost like crystal cola) in the glass. A 2 finger tan fine pored head sprang up but reduced quickly to only a ring on the glass. Not overly carbonated. overriding aroma is of smoke...good food processing smoke like birch or hardwood...reminiscent of westphalia ham. The first gulp the smoke overpowers your senses..all go blotto on the smoke signals...but after you have a sip or two or you finish a couple of pieces of cheese or oysters, the smoke power wanes and you get the mellow character of this delicate marzen lager...and it is delicate... with lots of subtle complexity (well made) you just dont get there on the first couple of gulps because it's cloaked by the smoke. All in all this is a toughie of a beer to slot...great german beer but perhaps too damn strong on smoke for some to be useful for anything else than a drink with similar strong tasting foods to off set them....like Jalapeno-infused anything or a strong tasting fish meal....I really like this beer and I drink it on its own in a session with out food but then I'm a marzen junke and Bamburg smoked marzen is a real treat for me....I had smoke taste up my nostrils and on the palate the next day...and loved it!"
"My memories were of a beer which was much more intense on all levels of appreciation. I remember it more rounded without being heavy and, although smoke dominated past samples, more of the caramel and malt expressed themselves. I must have gotten an old bottle."
"This is my first rauchbier and it won't be my last. It's great in June and it's probably even better in December with some beef stew."
"Mouthfeel is nice and smooth with great carbonation levels, nothing overpowering. Leaves a slightly oily feel behind that reminds me of eating smoked salmon. Great hearty beer, perfect for a meal with burgers."
"From the bottle pours a deep rich mahagony color with an off white foamy head. The head disappeared quickly, and there was little lace on the glass. What an incredible smell. All I could really grasp was the smokiness. There may have been a hint of something else, but I could not find it. Taste was a nice rich maltiness followed a a nice amount of dry smoke. Seemed a bit thin, and not much carbonation. Overall, I thought this was a very interesting beer. It was rather smooth, and had a nice smoky flavor that was not too powerful, but was certainly there. Not very drinkable, but I would certainly like to pair this one up with some food."
"Well this is not my favorite style of beer for sure but wanted to give this one a try,pours a deep amber with pretty light head.Huge smokey aroma like being next to a bonfire almost,taste is deeply smoked like smoked ham or sausage the beer has decent dry ending.Smokey and slightly sweet harsh on the taste buds for awhile I am sure a classic example but not my thing.Gave it a good rating however knowing this one is about as good as it gets for the style."
"Taste is overwhelmingly smoky to my palate. I mean, I have had rauchbier before but only American versions. This is the smokiest damn beer ever. Smoked pork, smoked shrimp are the flavors that come to mind. As I slowly get my tongue around the smoke, it is a nice malty marzen in there somewhere. Not sticky but a smooth maltiness. A very defined cigar aftertaste but I like cigars so that's cool with me. Not too drinkable for me, a sipper for sure but an experience in itself. As a beer advocate, you usually have some sort of reference for a style but this beer is unique to me. A singular taste adventure that is not to be missed if you want to learn about beer."
"This beer is amazing. Rich in complexity, uniquely smoky but with an exceptional drinkability...never off-putting and wonderfully balanced. Ahhhh...happiness."
"Imperial Pint Bottle: This beer pours an almost clear, brown color. There was about no head to it, although it was a little carbonated. The aroma was smokey, even bordering on the aroma of smoked fish. Nothing else seems to be able to get through. The taste is smokey also. A bit of maltiness in the background. This just doesnt get it for me."
"A small offwhite head foams up and quickly fades to an edge layer. Aroma is smoke and smoke, similar to smoked sausage or cheese. The first sip reveals a smooth tingly carbonation and lighter body than I expected. Flavor is a brief hit of sweet malt followed by smokiness that lingers for a while in my mouth. This is a tasty brew if you like smoked food, otherwise avoid it. I am probably going to use this in my chilli next time I make a batch."
"This is one of the beers that completely changed my perceptions about what a beer could be. My brother takes a few of these with sandwiches when he goes ice fishing in Fargo. A deep dark appearance with a rich thick mouth feel are nice, but the flavor is really incredible. Rich smoke, like that found in smoked Gouda cheese overwhelms the palate (in a good way). A tasty meal in a bottle. I've found that the Marzen goes best with the smoked flavor out of the three Aecht Schenkerlas."
"This is a tasty beer if it's your cup of tea. I don't think it is something many people would like to consume in any quantity. It's rather filling, like a plate of good smoked German sausages. This would probably complement grilled meat. Time to fire up the grill!"
"Interesting beer to say the least. Try again with a German dinner to ensure a great evening."
"A nice foamy head on a mahogany color. The smell is wonderful: as soon as your nose gets close to the glass, you smell this incredible smoked bacon aroma. That was great. The taste was exactly what I expected from the smell: a great smoked bacon flavor, with a nice carbonation, and a slightly citric aftertaste that gives the beer a high drinkability and a very refreshing aspect. It's amazing to see what you can do with malts once they get smoked. A very good surprize for me. I definitely want to have this one again."
"Pours a medium brown ( it was hard to tell as the beer was poured into a krug) with a nice foamy tan head.. The nose is of sweet smoked meat. In the words of Homer Simpson mmmm bacon beer. Taste is quite nice with a bit of sweet malt at the beginning, then the wonderfully done smoked malt charging to the fore, it ends with just enough hops to dry out and cut the smoke. This went wonderfuly with the schnitzel I had, but to have it with some grilled meats or nice sausages would be heavenly. Mouthfeel was almost oily, but the carbonation provided enough so that the smoke didnt linger like a dirty ash tray. Drinkability is good. I wouldnt pound these all night, but a couple with food is a no-brainer. I will definately seek this out and order it again."
"Some people like this style some people hate it. I think I fall into the former catagory. On tap at the Toad, whcih was a pleasent surprise. Poured a hazy muddy brown color with a little bit of a grey head. Smelled of nothing but smoke. The kind of smoke that clings to your clothes after sitting around a campfire for a couple nights. Deep woody flavors and a bit of smoked salmos as well. Taste had more of that huge herby smokiness, but the finish was almost cracker like in its toastiness. very interesting blend of tastes. I would say that you should definitely try this beer even if you don't like smoked anything. it will be worth it."
"Smoked salmon. Smoked kippers. Smoked sardines. Smoke any seafood, I would guess, and you've got the aroma of this deep chestnut brown ale that arrived from the tap with virtually no head at all. The taste matched the smell; it started off with a tart, vinegar-like initial blast, heavily salted, all of which fortunately mellowed as the schlenkurla malts rose up and insinuated themselves towards the finish, at which point I was able to appreciate the underlying complexity of this ale. There's some forest foundation, like an old campfire, but also some subtle sweetness (a sweet and sour seafood dish, heavy on the sour, and cooked outside over an open fire--that's the best I can do)"
"Bottle  Poured an amber cleared type brew with a nice head. Aroma of smoke is extremely present, a bit too much for my liking. Taste is overpowered by smoke, almost like drinking a beer in a salmon smoker. This is not bad beer just very different from what Im used to drinking on a regular basis. This beer would be wonderful if it was accompanied by some sausages or even smoked salmon."
"Pours with a rich, creamy, off-white head that dissipates gradually; fair degree of stickiness before sliding back into the beer. Beer is a chestnut brown color with great clarity and a few swift streamers. Transparent and bright when held to light, with slightly orangish highlights. Aroma is of smoke--not tobacco, but food smoke. There's also a subtle salinity, suggesting smoked seafood (especially oysters) and further back, the heat of freshly sawn wood (cedar). Taste is more smoke but stunningly light upon the roof of the mouth, along with what I originally thought was cedar, until I read that the wood for the fire is beechwood--yes, beechwood is more accurate. Beef or venison jerky, liquid smoke, and very salty. I am new to the style, but I just don't see much diversity here and presently I got tired of the flavor. Mouthfeel is light and wet with a minerally finish and really not much aftertaste. As far as drinkability, I'm sure this goes great with smoked food, sharp cheese, etc. but on its own? I don't need another."
"Still . . . strangely . . . I found this beer very drinkable. I think this is a testament to the craftmanship."
"16.9oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a deep ruby red color, almost black at some angles, with three fingers of off-white head. There is lots of lacing left on the glass. The smell is nothing but smoke, very intense. Smells almost like burnt wood. Based on the smell, I thought the taste would be WAY too smokey, but suprisingly, it's not. It's got an absolutely perfect amount of smoked malt. It's not too subtle, but definately not overpowering. A hint of caramel in there, and just the slightest touch of hops on the finish. The mouthfeel is just a little light and oily. The drinkability is superb for a smoked beer. A really good offering. I'm looking forward to the other Schlenkerla brews."
"This beer is awesome! So easy to drink, it's like a meal in and of itself. I can't wait to get hold of their Urbock and Weizen. Delicious!"
"I have to give a benefit of the doubt by taking into account its type. And by the way, the bottle says 5.1%. Its smoke. Thought it would go well with smoked fish. b Maybe for cooking, for barbecue..hmm! the possibilities. There is a decent ale there and then there is the smoke taste. Worth trying once."
"The beer pours reddish copper in a Don de Dieu glass. Nice foamy head, it diminishes pretty fast though, but holds the glass fairly well. Surprising aroma, definitely a new class for me, meaty with bacon and ham, salty sausages. The flavors developments are quite unrivaled. Let me explain.. first that intense smokiness (long dry smoky/bitter finish)is kind of a guardian over the journey that tasting this beer is. It's also one of the not so typical beers that holds the 4 basic flavors. Mouth entrance is very malty and moderatly sweet with the body being medium to full. Then, those smoked malts develop into a salty (bacon is salty after all) taste. Slightly tart at the same time. The finish is intense and bitter, woody, earthy, peaty. I wouldn't drink this everyday, but I can see this doing wonders paired with multiple meals (pancakes, poultry, pepper beef etc.)"
"i really enjoyed the aecht schlenkerla rauchbier urboch so i decided to try out the marzen, it poured a nice medium brown with a medium tan foamy head...it wasn't as pungent as the urboch but the camp fire smell was definietly there as was the wonderful tasted of smokey meat...we paired this with a mild white cheddar on a cold night and it was excellent...i could drink it straight...but sip it slowly it's a savoring beer not a chugging beer. Nice balance of flavors just enough hoppinees and malt to balance the smokiness and definitely alot milder than the marzen. Definitely reommend pairing it with a mild to sharp cheddar or perhaps some gouda."
"pours a clear, pepsi-looking brown amber colour with a moderate head that fades rather quickly and is mildly sticky. smells terrific: smoked and burnt ham/pulled pork/bacon type smell. some earth here as well. a bit of malt detected in the back. awesome. taste is just like the smell, but more subdued. smokiness up front and at the dry finish, but the middle of this medium bodied brew is more of a sweet malt flavour. the taste is truly exceptional. the smoke is not overpowering yet still quite assertive, thus allowing this brew to reamin smooth and quite drinkable. i don;t know if i could enjoy this all night as a session brew, but a couple at the beginning or end of the night would be absolute heaven."
"Well, what can I say. This is definantly the most unique beer I have ever tried. However in this case it is not a good thing. This beer would make a wonderful cooking beer but for drinking it is possibly one of the worst I have ever tasted. The smell and flavour are just not something I want to drink. Very hickory smoked ham. Used to flavour a chili it would be wonderful, but like I said, as a drink the nastiest thing in the world. Literally like drinking smoked ham."
"Pours a clear dark chestnut brown with a tan foamy head. Smell is unremarkable with just a hint of noble hops. Taste is quite different than anything else out there. Clearly smoky with an assault of woodsy flavors on the palette that is reminiscent of food char grilled to the point of burning on a wood fired stove. Hint of citrusy sourness rounds out the taste a bit. Medium body and tangy mouthfeel. Lingering smoky aftertaste. Has to be enjoyed slowly like a fine cigar."
"This is a working beer  make sure you've got a ham sandwich, a decent burger or some sausage to go with it. Not for quaffing I would think, just a one off for a treat or special occasion."
"The taste. mmm. unlike the rauchbier weizen, which I could not find a word to describe it other than perhaps a beer with a piece of meat stuck into it, this one I can only describe as a beer with a piece of ham stuck into it. With some maltyness and perhaps a hint of bitterness at the end, no carbonation at all, the biggest trait of this beer is, actually, its meaty (hammy in this case) sort of taste, very strongly perceivable and pleasant to the palate. Definetly could drink packs of these. Hope I'll find them here in paris."
"Light and thin mouthfeel with a fair amount of carbonation. As with most smoked beers, I think one or two is plenty to my taste."
"This beer poured a clear, dark, coffee brown color with creamy, tan foam that persisted and clung to the insides of the glass. The smell was nicely smokey and malty. The taste was smokey and malty with hints of coffee and cocoa. Some hops came out in the finish. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy with medium body and low carbonation feel. It was relatively dry and clean with a lingering light smokey flavor. This was quite good, and the smoke was not overpowering. Very nice for breakfast."
"Poured a deep reddish brown with an off-white head. Smell reminded me of hickory. Very woody, absolutely lovely. Close your eyes, and you expect a sausage in the glass when you open them. The taste starts off very malty, but before the sweetness crescendos, the smoke kicks in and dries out your mouth. Has a very dry finish, not quite astringent, just very very dry. This is a definite barbecue beer. Give me a smoker, a couple pounds of red meat, and a keg of this stuff!"
"What a pleasant surprise this brew was. Very drinkable brew. Probably not a session beer, but a great change of pace that Ill definitely look for again in the future. With this review, I've now made it half way through the BA list of official beer styles."
"It poured a thick creamy very dark brown with no foam and lace. The smell of smoky roasted malts fill the nose, with spices that I couldn't place. The taste was of a thick. creamy and smoky bacon flavor that was very different than any other Rauchbier that I have ever had. Another pleasant surprise for my palate!"
"Drinkability  I doubt most people could finish this bottle, but if youre a fan of the smoke (rauch) flavor, this is a must try."
"What you hear is what you get.Nice big head, aroma reminds me of smoked summer sausage, nice smooth mouthfeel initialy an extreme smoked taste, but it does seem to recede. The only place I would think this beer apropriate would be if I were on on a camping trip, and the boys were resolved to have beer early in the morning, and they were frying a breakfast of eggs and whatever."
"Drinkability: Get some jerky and have a festival of smoked flavors!! I couldn't see myself drinking too many bottles in one sitting, but I can definitely see me having this again and again. Betcha this would make a kick ass marinade."
"Utterly gorgeous appearance, from the deep clear bronze hue to the big, thick, contoured tan head that stuck around for a long time and left magnificent lace. The nose smelled a bit like smoked salty fish - not an unpleasant thing, but a bit odd for a beer. The mouth was heavy and mildly carbonated, with a definite charcoal undercurrent. The taste is smokey, but reasonably mild. It has little in common with other Märzens, but is pretty darn enjoyable, as the malt contends with the smoke leaving a pleasant aftertaste generated from the mixture. No hops taste. A good, unique experience, this is not a brew I'd like to have every night."
"Appearance: Deep ruby tone with a very appeasing tan foaming fluffy head, exquisite lacing surrounding the pint. Aroma: Well, I know this sounds weird but this beer smells of a tender smoked bacon with semi sweet roasted tones barely creeping through, oh so unique just straight up different and the orginator of smoked bier. Taste: It's so strange drinking a mildly sweet liquid that has a big kick of smoked meat in the flavor doesn't seem like it should be drinkable or even blend together but it does. Mouthfeel: Medium body decent carbonation not a bad brew at all, definitely a new definition of smoked bier. Drinkability: Suprisingly goes down pretty well I think it's damn good such a complex flavor picking out smoked flavors still brewed in the same tradition this is pretty amazing stuff be ready for something new if you try it."
"Thx"
"I had the store order this special as I have been aching to try a real rauchbier. Poured a dark soda brown color with a very large head with medium retention. The aroma was unlike any brew I have tried before this - so strong and pungent I can smell it while it sits on the desk in front of me. Aroma consisted of a chalky mesquite smoke, reminded me of smoked salmon. Taste was really something else. The smoke flavors were immense, the same smoked fish, with a sweetness like smoked sausage. Also a slight hoppiness, and roasted coffee. I am glad to have tried this, I would have to say this was one of my favorite beers so far to sit down and review."
"Deep dark brownish red with a creamy tan head. Smell is overwhelmingly smoky. Woodsy campfire aromas, smoked meats, fish and cheese, everything smoky and wonderful. Seems as though my glass should be smoldering. Taste is smoky as well. A sweet malt Marzen flavor underlies the smoked pecan or apple wood. Touch of smoked hops, but mostly malt complexities. Smooth full smoky mouthfeel. Halfway through the glass I had some smoked cheese and sausage, and this beer went with them perfectly. Eating some smoked foods actually brought out more of the sweet flavors in the beer. Goes down very easy. I'd go back to this beer again and again. An amazing style."
"The quaff was smooth, dry... and then very smoky. If you've never had a smoked-malt beer, you have to try this one. Very long finish that leaves you hungering for a sausage. And I mean that very positively!"
"A very dark beer for a Marzen, a dark amber in color. This one is quite dry tasting, with a very pronounced smokiness to it. The dryness seems to accentuate and focus your tastebuds upon the smoke flavor. This beer has quite a good amount of Body, a certain fullness that comes through even though it is quite dry tasting. There is not much in the way of hop flavor, which is good, as it allows the subdued malt and, of course, the smoke to come through."
"All in all, I thought the nice hickory aroma was very appetizing, and it followed that the taste may be predominantly smoky. But, after a few sips, I could definitely make out the roasted malts as well as a bit of hop character. A very well balanced brew that is great for a few pints, but after that, you will probably want to move on to something else. That's not a knock, but rather, this is a specialty beer which really isn't intended for sessioning. :)"
"Oooh! This one is deliciously smoky. I have always been a bit hesitant with rauchbiers, but I really enjoy them, so maybe I will drop that fear. I will admit that it may be an acquired taste, but that smoke is excellent. It is not overpowering, but it is definitely in full effect. There is a pretty good balance with some sweet malts and grains in there. The carbonation is light, but enough to be crisp. The body is medium to full. It is smooth and very drinkable. I don't know if I would sit down to a bunch of pints, but a couple would be just fine."
"This beer pours a brown color with minimal head and lacing. The aroma is the weirdest that I've noticed - smells like honey hickory smoke barbecue sauce - wonderful aroma. The taste wasn't very good though. It tasted just like it smelled, but for some reason the taste wasn't good at all. Can't say much more, but the taste was terrible."
"See what I mean?"
"Pours deep mahogany in color. Smokey aroma hits me already. I went in for a closer inspection. Yup, it's smoke. There's no getting past that, if you don't like smokey aromas and tastes you might want to stay clear of rauchbiers. The taste is also smokey with a hint of malt sweetness underneath it all. This is a beer to drink with a big slab of meat. The smokey flavor is very intense and is better accompanying something rather than by itself. And if you don't like to drink this, it's a wonderful cooking beer. Try cooking some bratwurst in it."
"This isn't as good as it's brother, the Urbock, but it holds it's own. It's main differences were the taste and smell, which are two very important things. The smell wasn't as strong and had a bit more of a hoppiness to it. It still had the great smell of bacon, but just not as strong. The taste was similar to the smell. It had a definate hoppiness to it, but nothing way too overpowering. It's definately a great beer to try, but if you have the chance, go with the Urbock."
"Deep smoky aroma, like smoked sausage or bologna or other fatty smoked meats. Brown to darkish red in color with small off-white head. Medium carb with medium oily palate. Sweetish start (like a light maerzen) with medium hops character. Sweet smoky fatty finish and after. One of the best smoked beers I've tried (though I haven't tried many yet)."
"Ok, that first review was a few years ago and since then I have tried the Marzen numerous times and I really do love it. I have come to embrace the smokiness and almost crave it when smoking meats on the grill. I like the sweetness of the malts and how they balance the smoke flavors a bit. I would love to try this or the Urbock from the cask at the brewery."
"Non lingering and crisp....Impressive....Recomended"
"Overall: Quite amazing, it would make for a great English Breakfast beer; well with some Fried Eggs, Black Pudding, Baked Beans, Grilled Tomatoes and Fried Bread (and HP Brown Sauce of course). Now there's an idea....."
"This brew poured a small head of fine to medium sized light brown bubbles and a very dark brown, but still somewhat transparent, body. It has a very strong aroma of smoke about it and a very smooth smoky initial flavor that builds to an even stronger smoky finish. I rather liked it. The smoke was not too more for me as it was for some."
"Smoked bacon and other meat in the aroma... seriously, how can you go wrong with bacon? Ruby colored with a white head that fades faast. Smoked ham comes though in the flavor with the marzen characteristics coming through on the front of the tongue and initially in the profile. Very nice overall and something I would definitely consider buying again."
"Overall a very unique and delicious beer. Not a beer for every occasion or every pallet. It's deffinately an aquired taste. But a beer you shouldn't miss."
"WEll I am happy to say I am in the ranks oif those that like Smoked beer..this was a great.will try more of this style."
"Pours a clear reddish/brown, large tan head that slowly recedes to leave thick lacing. Aroms is strong with smoke, bacon, and some saltiness. Flavor starts of a bit sweet, middle comes the smoke, end is long and lingering with a smoked bacon flavor. Body is medium, fairly slick, minimal carbonation present."
"Poured a red brown with little head. Strong aroma of smoke and little else.As for taste, this is my first try of a smoked beer. I can't decide if this is good or not, because the smokiness is overpowering! There just doesn't seem to be anything else there. The smell reminds me of a campfire that has been doused with water, and the smell of the hot steaming coals. Not something I think I'd try again."
"I could smell the embers immediately upon opening. Wow! Super smoky and much more than the Weizen I tried recently. Dark and brown reminds me of a glass of coke with the ice melted. Same exact color. Short fluffy head but dissapears quickly. Taste is smoky, malty and sweet. I can't find any hops in this one. Again, aroma is real smoky like a smoked bacon or beef. I like this beer but I also am a fan of smoked foods. You'll most likely have to be in order to appreciate this style."
"I had the rauchbier weizen and was less than impressed. The smoke seemed stale and overpowered the rest of the beer. Here however, the smoke seemed to complement the beer more. I was reminded of grilled meat (of course not with a gas grill, those wastes of grills) and campfires. I could see this going well with a nice grilled steak or some fat grilled hamburgers, but I'm not so sure I could handle a lot of it."
"This brew poured a quick dissolving head and left virtually no lacing on the sides of my mug. It has a strong smoky aroma which absolutely turned me off. It had an aftertaste to it. It poured a dark amber color. It has too smoky of a taste for my personal enjoyment. I just could not acquire a taste for this brew."
"Pours to a brown/ruby color with a tan head that leaves good lacing. The aroma is smoky like a nice smoked fish or cheese. It just smells so delicious. It is like my cousin, STUBOBs grill when his is smoking up some good grub for us to eat during a tasting session. The flavor is smoky and malt. It is super smooth and relatively light in body. I wish I had some smoked cheeses, meats and fish to try with this beer."
"Brewed soley from smoked malt! It pours a clear, reddish-copper body topped by a creamy ivory head which holds well and leaves some nice lace. The aroma is of intense Beechwood smoke over a gentle maltiness. The body is medium; and combines with a fine-bubbled, median carbonation to give it a lightly crisp and then somewhat creamy mouthfeel. The flavor is drenched in Beechwood smokiness throughout, but starts malty upfront with a touch of toastiness/toffee, followed by a good dose of bitterness as it heads towards the swallow. It finishes long and dry with a solid bitterness and a lingering smoke character. Although its smokiness will surely build on the palate after a few servings (diminishing its drinkability), it's still satisfying from start to finish within the first glass. Very nice! A classic example of Bamberg-style rauchbier that's absolutely worth trying; although their Weizen version might make a better first-step for the uninitiated."
"Notes: Clean to the taste, smoke everywhere and the quintessential smoked beer that is imported to the US. It’s worth the $3 a bottle, an awesome pairing with a slow cooked Boston Butt a.k.a. pulled pork sandwich on an onion bulky roll. Even a contrast pairing of an aged sharp cheddar cheese would be nice."
"Deep brown to mahogoney in color. When held to the light a faint ruby glow emerges. Tan bubbly head, tight. Laces the glass somewhat. Smell is full on wood smokehouse. From first whiff to last drop, smokehouse flavors ease into your nose. Not harsh at all, but very pleasant. Taste is equally striking at first. Reminded me of smoked beef jerkey or perfectly smoked bbq ribs. Creamy sweet malt is also noticed. As you drink, the shock of the smoke wears out a bit, and more full rich malty beer flavors emerge. Toasted toffee sweetness. Nothing really lingers. Medium bodied, rich creamy feel. A striking and unique beer, would get a 5 for originality. Highly suggested, I can see where you either love these or hate these. I will try it again with a smoked bbq ribs or smoked German Sausage and saurkraut. Yea ! Definitley worth a try."
"It starts out well, with a nice brownish-amber color and decent looking head. However, the smell and taste of smoke are just a bit overwhelming. After expecting the malt flavor to catch up with the smoke flavor, disappointment set in about 2/3 of the way through the bottle after realizing it wasn't going to happen. The mouthfeel is decent, but the smokiness detracted from the overall drinkability. Maybe it's an acquired taste."
"The beer pours a murky ""Chill Hazed"" brown with a greathearted head that leaves a diaphanous lace to coat the glass. One of the best aromas that I have quaffed in sometime, its earthy, hints of smoke, peat, dark malts, caramel, and also light coffee like tones present. Front is malt and slightly sweet, the top middling in feel, the finish is pleasantly acidic, merrily hopped, quite dry and the smoky, peat like characteristics carry through to the end. A different beer, and something worth the try, for you ""Dark"" lovers."
"Rauchbier is truely an acquired taste... and I'm not sure that I have, as of yet, acquired the taste. That said, this was a very interesting beer... had it with some Jagerschnitzel at a local German restaurant. Brownish amber with a dense foam. Aroma of smoked meat and just a touch of sweetness (although you have to be looking for it, or you won't find it.) First sip, and whoa... smoked salmon in a bottle... but after a few sips (and as the beer started to warm) the smokiness mellowed and some of the marzen characterisitcs started coming through. The sweetness matched the smoky flavor pretty well. The body and carbonation are in the medium range. If you like smoked beer... you should love this beer... if you haven't had it, you owe it to yourself to try it."
"Drinkability: I couldn't have this everyday but what a treat to have with a good BBQ or smoked sausage and ham."
"Between this beer, their Urbock, and Weizen, I prefer this second to the Weizen. This was a very nicely balanced Marzen underneath the smoke. However, the complexity of the smoke layered on top of the wheat makes the Weizen that much more interesting."
"In my opinion, Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Marzen is probably the better out of the bunch. Pairs nicely with any grilled or cured meats."
"Smooth and a little thick going down.  An excellent post-dinner drink, I think."
"What a wonderful smokey aroma this beer has. Seems to fit in well in this fall season. I've been yearning for a smoke beer for quite some time now and am very glad this one didn't disappoint me. This beer definatly sets the tone for future Rauchbier tastings in the future."
"This would be all the better paired with a nice, hearty meal.  For some reason, rauchbiers always have me scrambling for the food (munchies from the smoke??).  A selection of cheeses paired delightfully with this tonight."
"Cheers to VENOM for the sample!"
"Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier A very smoked German marzen.  I had a small sample of this on tap, and thank god, because there was no way I could have finished a pint.  Heavily smoked flavor and aroma.  Do not think a roaring fire in your fireplace smoked, think great Chicago fire smoked.  Just a hint of molasses taste, but to me it way to much smoke. Not for the faint of heart.  I tweaked the numbers up, a little because this is clearly a well made beer, but It reminded me off dgging through my friends apartment after it had been burnt to the ground."
"This is a beer that you warm up to...much like an Islay Single-Malt Scotch like Laphroiag: ""There is a fine line between love and hate: about halfway through the bottle....."""
"Dark amber color, good head, delicious smoky aroma. This beer is very refined, with the smoke almost entirely in the attack, and a smooth malty finish. It does not have the animal fat taste in some smoked products, which is good, but also lacks the delectable, peaty, greeny qualities that can be found in scotch whisky, for example. Perhaps best with food, in my case, chicken sausages and Jarlsberg - which I think were a little too delicate since the smoke is quite robust. The smokiness mellows out as it sits in the glass, and also as your palate adjusts to it. It is a fine beer, even if the actual beer lying under the smoke flavors is a bit mild. Some coffee and liquorice hints. Low drinkability but that is symptomatic of the style in my opinion. It really does grow on you."
"the aroma is spine tingling, especially if you live in an area that appreciates smoked meats/fish and uses wood burning stoves in the fall and winter. the smoked taste aroma/taste dominates this fine brew. i should be drinking this in late october/november with some dried venison with my hunting buddies.  dark garnet hue but no lasting head at all.  nice caramel malt body and lingering smoke aftertaste.  a true unique german classic.  a brew i WILL revisit this fall to really soak in the seasonal atmosphere."
"Wow. Liquid smoke in a bottle. What a different experience this was. So much so, that I had to go out and get another bottle of it!  Very good. Drink this while eating something heavy, like a pot roast or venison. Very good."
"From the time I first tried this beer I was totally impressed. So unique and so rewarding. Very complex. Taste is a great toasted malt flavor and with the mixture of the smoke flavor, you have an exceptional beer. This is great alone or with very robust meal such as beef stew. The first thing that hits you is the instant smell of smoke. God I would love to tour this brewery!!!!!"
"Beautiful crystal clear garnet hue. A touch darker than the norm for a Marzen. Thin head, w/ fairly low carbonation for style. Huge beechwood smoked malt aroma dominates. Secondary to that raisiny, decocted malanoidin malty aromas are noticeable, but the rauchmalt dominates. Roasty & toasty malt flavors are prominent and are accompanied by a surprisingly assertive hop bitterness for style. All of this is combined with a rich, tasty rauchmalt smokey base. Medium bodied w/ a nice toasted malt and slight hop bitterness in the finish. Very complex beer with an assertive but well balanced rauchmalt flavor. That being said, you won't like this beer if you don't like smoked beers."
"Dark brown-black clear lager with a white bubbly head on top. Smells very smoky, but with the familiar sweet and clean german malt coming through, no hop odor in the smell (perhaps I couldn't smell it due to the smoke). Smooth, clean, and malty taste, with an unstoppable smoked character throughout. Looking past this, I taste a well crafted, and very clean German Lager. Very quaffable with some good old bbq spare ribs and pulled pork, it practically drank itself."
"Very interesting beer, actually tastes like smoked salami or something, although that might sound digusting, it actually works well."
"I do not like the smell from start, it smells like smoked kielbasa. I like kielbasa but this smell burned my nose hairs. I love Marzen beer but the smoked effect is not my style. I still recognize this beer is a clasic for the smoked type, that's why I gave it a curved score. It is smooth and goes down easy and the finish is also good, but that smell get's to me."
