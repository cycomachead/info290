"O - It has the makings of a great rauchbier. I loved the aroma, and the initial flavor was good. I didn't like the dry, bitter finish."

"O: This definitely wasn't my bag. The chemical/band aide affect in the taste left a lot to be desired. Pleasent to smell, not so much to taste. Didn't finish the bottle."

"22 ounce bottle. Served in a mug, the beer pours a slightly hazy orange/amber/brown color with a half inch light tan head that fizzled away pretty quickly. Not much lacing at all. Aroma is pretty much all smoked meats/malt (bacon), along with a bit of wood. The taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes mostly like smoked malt/meats, and there's also some wood and an apple juice flavor noticeable too. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and coating with a decent amount of carbonation. I think it's a solid brew, it's definitely worth trying."
"Tried hard but couldn't enjoy it. I don't know if the word Bacon on the label messed with my head but the first hickory filled sip had me thinking a slice of bacon had slipped into the bottle. Had to pour out the rest and move on to a beer of known quality and/or likability."

"Overall I am impressed with this beer. I am a big fan of rauchbiers and this one did not disappoint. I wonderful hearty beer perfect for a cold evening."
"Just not the beer for me. I can appreciate the concept and the attempt, the final result leaves me wanting more than it can deliver. One pour is enough and then time to move on."
"D- Very high drinkability for me. Very happy I have another one. The taste isn't too heavy, but the smell is dank. I am very glad this one delivered. Bacon beer baby!"
"glad I git to try this, but pretty rough to put down after a few sips."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The body of the beer is just shy of medium. I think a little less fizzyness would improve the drinkability. I would certainly grab another bottle of this should I see it great bang for the buck at $5.00 a bomber."
"Drinkability: A nice meal in a bottle.... One bomber satisfys."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is about perfect, coats the tongue but still light and goes down smoothly. Very drinkable for the style and worth a look for rauchbier fans."
" Keep making em, and Ill keep drinking em"
"Not a huge fan of smoked beverages other than Alaska's smoked porter and a few other smoked porters. So i was surprised when i found myself enjoying this more than i expected to. Smells like smoked bacon right off the bat for me. it marries well with the bock style. very impressed."
"D: Definitely something I would like to get again. I think I could drink a few pints of this, and try to figure it out a little better."
