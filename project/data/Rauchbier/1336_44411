4.1,12.9,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Mouthfeel is full bodied, coating, and probably well suited for pairing with a chili.","weeare138","Feb 02, 2010"
2.68,-26.2,3.5,3,2,3.5,3,"This beer has a pretty nice color to it. It was an attractive medium shade of brown with a slight head on it. The smell is quite smokey, kind of overpowers much of the other aromas that might be in there. The flavor is super smokey in my opinion. It's just too much for this beer. Some smoked beers are really tasty if they're gone right but I just feel this one was a little overboard. The mouthfeel was pretty good too, The flavor of this beer just didn't do it for me.","Knapp85","Nov 19, 2009"

3.25,-10.5,3,3,3.5,2.5,3.5,"D - Pretty decent Rauchbier overall, although it could benefit greatly from a more robust mouthfeel and more prominent hop presence. However, the flavor is pretty solid and, while it goes down rather easily, it's not terribly memorable.","ffejherb","Nov 14, 2008"
3.5,-3.6,4,4,3.5,4,2.5,"I should have stopped there with just one drink, but it's a growler so I am dedicated to the last glass. The more you drink this, the less enjoyable it becomes. Had I stopped this review after one beer, the rating would have been higher but that's not the case. The malt sweetness gets to be too overbearing. The amount of malt sweetness reminds me more of a maibock than rauchbier.","stakem","Oct 27, 2008"
4.15,14.3,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"D: This one works. Much like Jolly Scot, the fuller malt profile and lightly smoked flavor really work. Kudos to ABC for this one.","akorsak","Oct 18, 2008"
2.87,-20.9,3,3.5,2.5,2.5,3,"D: A very easy drinking beer, but I cannot really say that this was a very good example of a rauchbier. While the beer was fairly filling, the smokiness needed more of a presence in the beer to be a better rauchbier.","maddogruss","Sep 04, 2008"
3.44,-5.2,4.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The beer looked great and had a decent taste. I would definitely recommend giving this brew a try if it is on draft.","boralyl","Sep 02, 2008"
3.51,-3.3,4.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"I like my Rauchbiers a tab bit more smokier than this, but it's still a very good mildly smoky Rauchbier. I would be happy to try this beer again. If it's still on tap, it's worth a shot.","AltBock","Beers"
3.58,-1.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"This was definitley more ""Bock"" than ""Rauch"" but did still possess enough smokey quality and crisp enough nature to keep things balanced and fairly interesting. I didn't have too much of a problem finishing my mug.","Kegatron","0"
