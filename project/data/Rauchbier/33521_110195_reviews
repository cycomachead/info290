"Faint smoke on nose. Lite smoke on taste. Excellent!"

"I love smoked beer and this one is a real surprise, it at first seems very ordinary but the first taste hits like it was a beer brewed on the other side of the pond. The brewer absolutely nailed this one. and at 4.7% abv, I could see myself drink a lot of this in the possible future."

"Adventurous style: A pale rauchbier. This looks like any other Belgian, but things get interesting when you bring it to your lips. Big campfire nose. The light body can't quite stand up to the four-alarm smoke. Needs more of a malt backbone to firm this one up and give it some ballast. Props for creativity though."
