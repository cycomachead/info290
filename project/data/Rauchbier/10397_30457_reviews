"Overall a tasty user friendly smoked ale."

"Drinkability: The smell of this one is just amazing. The bitterness at the end is unique. This may be one of the best domestic rauchbiers I have had. I will look for this whenever I am in Pennsylvania. It is just a really great beer. Sly Fox continually impresses me with the high quality of the beers they churn out."

"This is my first time having this style so it's tough to review ''to style''. That being said, this is one delicious brew. I was expecting smoky flavors, which it has, but I wasn't expecting such a deep hardwood palate. There are also a fair amount of malt sweetness that pulls it all together. I would compare it to smoky version of a scotch ale, only with the refreshing qualities of a well crafted amber lager. This is certainly worth a taste if you happen upon it. Cheers!"
"Pours clear copper with big fluffy head. Aroma is strongly smoky. Flavor is clean and smoky, powerful yet delicate. Not overwhelming. It suggests leather and rich pipe smoke, not so much like a campfire, as with some rauschbiers.There is some butterscotch malt back there, but mostly smoke. Mouthfeel is quite delicate."
"Drinkability: this beer goes down smoothly and would go well with BBQ meats. Nice beer overall and worth a try."
"M&D--Both are excellent, as the active carbonation brightens and lightens this enough to keep it from being mouth-coating. It's fairly thin, thinner than the flavor profile would suggest, which is a necessary offset for such big flavors. Again, think BBQ, and not no barbecue chicken with like grilled scallions. Bring on the pulled pork, gentlemen! I'd drink this before the meat was on the smoker when I was getting the fire ready, during the smoking process when the meat and wood smells were mixing, and after it was through and I could gnaw my way through some bones. At 5.2 percent, I may just survive such an endeavor~! Great American take on the style. Tied with the Aurora IPA as my favorite brew tasted tonight (out of ten)."
"As expected, light hef on the body. Carbonation is a little too strong, (even after three weeks sitting in a bottle), but it works well with food. Maybe it's to keep the fat from congealing. :P"
"On tap, 11/16/08. The pint was delivered with a clear, deep amber (almost chestnut) body beneath a short head of white that fades shortly but somehow manages to leave walls of thin lace about the glass. The nose was smoky but not over-done. It's woody, clearly Beech, and just lightly ""bacon"" or ""BBQ"". Hints of caramel are present as well. The flavor follows suit, but there's more caramel than the nose suggests. The smokiness is flavorful, and an integral part, but not commanding and very nicely balanced. I was immediately surprised at how drinkable it was, and although I didn't have a second pint I surely could have. I paired it with the portobello sandwich and it complemented nicely. Well-brewed, superbly balanced, suprisingly drinkable and worth seeking out!"
"Drinkability: A very drinkable beer that provides a balanced amount of flavor. Unfortunately only available on tap."
"Overall a highly session able, tight little ale from Sly Fox. This is a style that can be done incredibly wrong if you are not careful, so it was refreshing to see another hit come out of them! Go check this one out while it is still available."
"I have this on tap at home, I was very happy to find a sixtel of this. It pours a dark clear amber with a nice white head. The smell was smoky, but not overdone I really like the way it seems to just be around to complement the sweet malt. The smoke is a bit more noticeable in the taste, it really is balanced nice with the malt. The body is almost full, there is a nice level of carbonation to keep the body on the light side of full. It is very drinkable, very smooth, the flavors just keep coming for the entire beer. Easily one of my favorite Rauchbiers."
"In the end, it's just a basic Rauchbier that you would give to somebody to try and get them into the style. For me, it was too light for a Rauchbier."
"Flavor is fiery smoke, with notes of cured meats and barbecue. There is a slight hop to cut in, but not too noticeable. Also a touch of alcohol is present in the flavor. Sly Fox has done a nice job of recreating this German style without ""Americanizing"" it too much. It's not quite as potent as some of the more famous German Rauchbiers, but that's not necessarily a bad thing here. Nice job with the style."
"D: This is a well crafted beer that is spot on to the style. I could definately have a few of these on crisp fall afternoons."
"Overall- A style I'm very starting to enjoy more than ever. Solid smokey flavor throughout. Good solid beer."
"Clear, light chestnut (deep amber with a reddish hue) with a short cap of white foam. Good retention and the fine bubbles showed some stickage to the glass. Very nice aroma, all malt and smoke. There were notes of caramel and peat, giving it a single-malt scotch character. Also a light ashiness, almost like a campfire. The smell was fairly mellow overall though. Solid bitterness was balanced by sweet malt and wood smoke (kind of like a ham). Many of the qualities of the aroma carried into the flavour, but the smokiness was more subdued. Medium/light body with lowish carbonation, some dryness and decent texture. I really enjoyed Sly Fox's interpretation of a rauchbier. I'm not normally a fan, but the balance worked for me."
